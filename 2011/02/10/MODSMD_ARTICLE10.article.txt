# WANDERLUST
## How it all started 
### Johnny Bartz 
As I wing my way across the
continental U.S. on a morning
flight to New York, I'm think
ing back on how my travel interest
came to be. Gone are the days of mid
dle school track practice when the
coach would quiz us on what type of
plane was passing overhead. Too bad,
because I was that kid who had memo
rized the list from the Northwest Air
lines in-flight magazine, impressing the
coach, yet probably leaving my team
mates slightly annoyed. Gone also are
the days when I regularly sat down my
little brother so he could learn the di
rect international flights out of Min
neapolis and truly comprehend what a
12-hour time difference was like.
Yes, planes had always fascinated
me, but it wasn't until high school that
I became engaged in "flyer talk." I
worked at a bakery and my favorite
customer was a Northwest employee.
Everyday she would come in to get
her whole grain raisin cinnamon roll
and we'd briefly chat about planes
the DC-9s were finally being phased
out, fuel efficiency of the A33os, 757s
being sent on trans-Atlantic ops.
There is a special sort of bond that
aviation enthusiasts share with one
another that is perhaps not as com
municable among those not accus
tomed to the jargon. Do you prefer
Boeing or Airbus? What do you think
about the new 787? Are you a fan of
the classic jumbo jet queen of the
skies, the overpowered 757-200 that
climbs like a fighter jet, or do you pre
fer the retro MD-80s?
Anyway, my customer led a glam
orous lifestyle meeting with Air
bus execs in France, jetting off to Am
sterdam just for dinner, spending a
long weekend in Monaco. TTris was in

credibly intriguing to me, and I gradu
ally made a realization: I too could fly
to Europe for the weekend if I want
ed to. Not every weekend, but this im
possible idea to a kid who was accus
tomed to just watching planes was
now well within reach.
I guess maybe it's not fair to say
that all of my travel inspiration came
from my classy customer at the bak
ery. I already knew the ins and outs of
booking cheap airline tickets, so 1 sup
pose it was only a matter of time be
fore I actually started buying them.
And let me tell you, once college
rolled around things did not go well
it was utterly macabre. I'll tell you
about my surprise trip to Italy in next
week's column, but first I should prob
ably give you the rundown for book
ing airline tickets. Search for fares on
Tuesdays. Airlines release fares every
Monday, and will often frantically
match each other's prices. Check back
often, because as I've said before, win
ter is a great time to pick up a great
fare, but it's almost over! Currently
there are domestic and international
fare sales on all major airlines, some of
which are only valid until the begin
ning of next week. For weekend trips,
try leaving on a Thursday, coming
back Monday or Tuesday, as these are
generally light travel days, meaning
cheaper fares will be available.
If you're traveling far, try booking
the long flight from a hub or focus city.
Then get yourself there on a discount
airline. For example, fares from New
York City to Europe are often a frac
tion of what they cost from any other
city since there is so much competi
tion from international airlines. An
other possibility is to fly directly to a
hub in Europe and buy your onward

leg on a discount carrier. With three
nonstop flights a day from SFO to
Heathrow, London is quite consis
tently the cheapest destination to fly
to in Europe. The airport is a night
mare, so allow for lots of commuting
time. Just as a warning, be sure you are
leaving from the same airport that
you arrive to the last thing you
want is to be traipsing around the UK
looking for podunk regional airport
to catch your Ryanair flight.
Yes, I miss the days where I could
lay out on my deck and identify
planes by the sound of their engines.
Lucky for me (and you too!), under
common wind conditions most in
bound traffic to SFO passes right over
Stanford, sometimes performing
spectacular banking turns, as they
turn to the northwest to line up for
runway 28R/L. See if you can spot my
personal favorite, the KLM MD-11
that passes Stanford around 1:25 p.m.
It's a spectacular sky blue aircraft
with a huge engine mounted at the
base of the vertical stabilizer and crisp
white winglets. KLM is actually the
last commercial airline to regularly
operate passenger MD-lls, so it's a
real treat to be able to see this beauty
in our backyard. Time is limited as on
March Ist the flight is upgraded to a
777-200ER and April Ist it becomes a
777-300ER for the summer.

you crane your head to the sky look
