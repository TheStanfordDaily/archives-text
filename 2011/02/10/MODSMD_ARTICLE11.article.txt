# I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY PROFOUND
## Stanford Rants 
### Robin Thomas 
At the start of last week, I sent
a few e-mail lists an invita
tion for students to anony
mously vent their biggest Stanford
related frustrations by listing them
on a Google Doc. There were over
100 individual responses (over 120 if
you include the trolls). From what I
read, students' complaints seem to
have fallen into a few big categories:
Lack of diversity
One student appeared to capture
many others' thoughts with the con
cise response, "Stanford is repressive
of discussions about class and so
cioeconomic status." Students are
frustrated with what passes for the
norm at Stanford, and many spoke of
hiding their beliefs and backgrounds
so as to avoid persecution. Those
who feel most antagonized seem to
be low-income students, Christians,
those with conservative viewpoints
and students who aren't attracted to
alcohol and the college party culture.
Academic structure
Some students hate the quarter
system. Some think, "academic ad
vising is a total joke." Engineers wish
they had more time to take classes
outside of engineering. "Financial
aid really hurts a large portion of
middle class students." IFIUM has
both good and bad points.
Social scene
Many, many students wish alco
hol wasn't such a staple of undergrad
life. Palo Alto and Stanford are too
expensive, and San Francisco is
much less accessible than Stanford
would like ProFros to think. There
needs to be a central hang-out loca
tion on campus; the "student center
sucks/almost does not exist." Also,
"the dating sucks."

Work ethic
"I'm tired of kids who know how
to test well, but have forgotten how
to learn," is a feeling echoed by
many. Pre-meds in particular have
gotten a bad rep: "Medicine is a hal
lowed profession. Treat it like a priv
ilege, not a game." And one respon
dent said Stanford students "only
care about the world when it will
help them get fellowships & scholar
ships, just like all those clubs they
joined in high school."
Attitudes toward life
This was the biggest section; it
seemed many students think Stanford
kids are too "success"-driven and not
relationship-driven enough, and then
those same Stanford kids complain
about feeling lonely. The "Stanford
Duck Syndrome" and "faking your
feelings" were also mentioned a great
deal, as were "ego" and "elitism."
Also, according to a few respondents,
students aren't activist enough:
"Whatever happened to protests?"
Health
At CAPS, there's "a lack of avail
ability of appointments [and] inef
fectiveness of said appointments."
At Vaden, "if you're not an athlete,
you don't matter." And the Bridge
"has good ideas but fails at making
people feel better..."
Biking
"For smart people, we ride bikes
like idiots." Also, "lighting around
campus sucks," as does parking.
Food
Several students want 24-hour
food, several want cheaper food, sev
eral want more options and the list
goes on.

Resident life
There were complaints of poor
hygiene and students disrespecting
custodial staff ("What, are you used
to having a maid or something?").
Several were disappointed with the
noisy party culture ingrained in their
dorms and poor leadership by
ResEd staff. A few were angry they
had never gotten a single.

And so on. You can imagine that

this article is a pretty small nutshell
to try to contain the emotion of a
hundred responses.
So why'd I set this thing up in the
first place?
Well, in fact, I think this place is
pretty great. I'd have left if there
weren't something more than career
prospects keeping me here. Let's let
one of the responses speak for me: "I
do have to say for all of the com
plaining I've done in an earlier post,
I would not have changed a thing
when deciding to come to Stanford if
I could go back in time."
But could Stanford be better?
Absolutely, just like everything and
everyone else. My big frustration is
hearing so many students having
the exact same conversations about
what's not working, and then seeing
so few of them actually do anything

about it they're too preoccu
pied, or shy, or risk-averse. So I
thought, "hey, everyone whining
separately isn't accomplishing any
thing. Maybe everyone whining to
gether will."
No, a Google Doc won't revolu
tionize this University. And I certain
ly don't have any big "Plan for En
acting Change." All I can really hope
from this thing is that a lot of people
will see it, it'll show some people
what others are thinking and it'll get
some people talking. And from what
the history books tell me, it's "getting
people talking" that's always made
the world turn.
