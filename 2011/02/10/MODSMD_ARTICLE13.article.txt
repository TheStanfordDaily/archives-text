## CARD'S WORK CUT OUT Softball opens season Friday 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Softball team
opens up the season with a double
header tomorrow at the Kajikawa
Classic in Tempe, Ariz. The Cardi
nal returns 12 letter-winners and
six starters from the 2010 squad
that finished with a 37-19 record
and was eliminated by Texas Tech
in the second round of last year's
NCAA Tournament.
Now carrying a preseason No.
18 ranking from USA Softball,
Stanford is poised to break
through on the national scene
with a handful of award-winning
players.
Junior infielder Ashley Hansen
has won her fair share of honors in
two seasons on the Farm, with two
First Team All-Pac-10 selections to
add to her National Fastpitch
Coaches Association Second Team
Ail-American honor as a fresh
man. She was also named one of
the preseason finalists for USA
Softball Player of the Year.
"It is an honor to be chosen but
as of right now, it means nothing. It
makes me more fired up to go
prove myself this season," Hansen
said. "I am much more focused on
winning a national championship
right now, and I am looking for
ward to contributing a lot to my
team."
Her head coach, John Rittman,
is entering his 15th season on the
Farm and boasts a career 599-277-3
record with 13 consecutive winning
seasons and 13 trips to the NCAA
Tournament. His .683 winning per
centage is one of the top marks in
Div. I. Rittman has also coached 15
Ail-Americans at Stanford and is
enamored by the consistency
Hansen has already displayed in
just two years for the Cardinal.
"Ashley Hansen is such a com
petitor and such a leader for our
program," Rittman said. "It seems
like she's been here for years al
ready because of her consistency

offensively, defensively, and her
work ethic and attitude. Those are
things you see everyday."
Hansen looks likely to start at
shortstop this year after moving to
second base to make room for
then-freshman Jenna Rich. The
pair formed quite an impressive
duo up the middle for the Cardinal,
combining for 78 total runs, 86 RBI
and 15 home runs while hitting .331
together.
Rich also worked her way into
the pitching rotation after an injury
to ace Teagan Gerhart midway
through the year and is expected to
feature in the circle for the Cardi
nal along with the senior Ashley
Chinn and the sophomore Ger
hart.

The younger sister of former
football-baseball double athlete
Toby, Teagan Gerhart is also look
ing to regain her form of early last
season when she threw three
straight no-hitters, including a per
fect game against Santa Clara. Un
fortunately, Gerhart was sidelined
by an arm injury and couldn't pitch
in the last 15 games. She still fin
ished with a 22-6 record and an
ERA of 1.65 good enough for
Second Team All-West Region
honors and a spot on the All-Pac
-10 Freshman Team.
"Whenever you lose a pitcher of
Teagan Gerhart's ability, there are
questions about where will she
come back," Rittman said. "Will
she start up where she left off? I do

know that she has done an out
standing job in rehab to get ready
for this season."
With the pitching staff intact
again, the Cardinal will still have to
find a replacement for one of the
top players in Stanford Softball his
tory, Alissa Haber. The graduated
senior outfielder was a four-time
All-American and four-time All-
Pac-10 First Team selection, finish
ing her collegiate career with the
Stanford record for doubles.
"Any time you lose three sen
iors, especially of the caliber of a
four-time All-American, a two
time Pac-10 Defensive Player of
the Year, a leader like [Shannon]
Koplitz, there are going to be ques
tions of who is [going to] fill in
those roles on our team," Rittman
said.
For the moment, it appears that
the defense is set. Redshirt fresh
man Tegan Schmidt is back from a
knee injury and taking Haber's
spot in right field with freshman
Corey Hanewich expected to start
in left. Junior Jenna Becerra will
move over to third base to replace
Koplitz and senior Melisa Koutz
will play first base. Junior Maya
Burns has transitioned from the
outfield to fill graduated senior
Rosey Neill's big shoes behind the
plate with Hansen, Rich and senior
Sarah Hassman up the middle at
short, second and center field.
"We have a great freshman,
Corey Hanewich, who can be a
dangerous weapon at the plate for
us. She'll add another great arm
and speed to the outfield and help
fill the hole left by Haber," Hansen
said.
The Cardinal is certainly going
to be a young team; in addition to
starting a true freshman, there will
be only two seniors starting, but
Rich said that this year is just like
any other.
"Each year is always going to be
different with the loss of veterans
and gain of newcomers. After los
ing three seniors from last year, we
have a young team this year. The
team dynamic may be different,
but that's expected year-to-year,"
she said. "And despite having a

Cardinal lineup will have a tough road ahead in the brutal Pac-10.
young team, we still have high ex
pectations."
According to Rittman, practices
with the new team have been going
extremely well and the team is
antsy to return to competition.
"We have really benefited from
this great weather and the team is
really just ready to play. Everyone
is tired of facing their teammates in
practice and are ready to face a
team in another uniform," Rittman
said. "I've been very impressed
with their attitude and work ethic
the team is really coming to
gether."
There will be little time to figure
things out for the young squad.
Stanford takes on Cal State North
ridge and North Texas on Friday
and then faces two perennial
NCAA Tournament contenders in
Nebraska and Portland State.
"I'm looking forward to seeing
what this team can do together,"
Hansen said. "We have a very tal
ented group of girls and this season
is where we can finally show off
what we can do. As a team, if we
each take care of ourselves and do
the little things, we will be playing
in Oklahoma City in June."
The Cardinal is slated to play a
grueling preseason schedule with
eight opponents that qualified for
the 2010 NCAA Tournament. Then
comes the Pac-10, which many ana
lysts see as the deepest and most
difficult conference in the country.
Stanford was sixth in the coach
es' preseason poll with defending
national champion UCLA and
runner-up Arizona splitting the top
spot.
Friday's season opener against
Cal State Northridge is scheduled
for 11 a.m. PST in Tempe, Ariz.
