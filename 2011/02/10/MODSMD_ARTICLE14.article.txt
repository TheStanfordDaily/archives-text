# STREAKING ALONG

### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
If a still-perfect conference record wasn't impressive enough,
Stanford women's basketball will have an opportunity to take
some major steps forward in Pac-10 history when it hosts Wash
ington State tonight.
The No. 3 Cardinal (20-2,11-0 Pac-10) tied its own conference
record for most consecutive wins with a 91-61 rout of Arizona last
Saturday, putting the team just one victory shy of an unprecedent
ed 49 straight. In another sizeable streak, Stanford completely
owns the all-time series against the Cougars (7-16,5-6), winning all
51 matchups. On top of that, the Cardinal is riding a 56-game home
winning streak.
"It's quite a record, and something that we can be part of histo
ry with," said sophomore forward Joslyn Tinkle. "So we're excit
ed."
Both teams are coming off strong victories, scoring over 90
points each. That's especially notable for WSU, which swept its
first conference series in over a decade last week in Oregon. Wash
ington State hadn't taken a two-game set in the Pac-10 since Jan
uary 2001, when it beat USC and UCLA at home.
The Cougars have shown resilience this season, approaching a
.500 Pac-10 record after winning only a pair of non-conference
games. And even then, their apparently mediocre record beguiles
their talent: according to rpiratings.com, WSU has endured the
18th-toughest schedule in the country.
Washington State has turned things around with a respectable
conference performance, and boasts the reigning Pac-10 Player of
the Week in Sage Romberg. The freshman scored 17 points off the
bench in the Cougars' come-from-behind, 67-64 win against the
Beavers last week, and put up 15 more in a 96-90 thriller over the
Ducks that saw five Cougars reach double-digit point totals.
"I feel like they've improved tremendous amounts," Tinkle
said about the Cougars. "Granted, they've struggled the past few
