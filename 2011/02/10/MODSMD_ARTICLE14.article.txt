# STREAKING ALONG
## 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
If a still-perfect conference record wasn't impressive enough,
Stanford women's basketball will have an opportunity to take
some major steps forward in Pac-10 history when it hosts Wash
ington State tonight.
The No. 3 Cardinal (20-2,11-0 Pac-10) tied its own conference
record for most consecutive wins with a 91-61 rout of Arizona last
Saturday, putting the team just one victory shy of an unprecedent
ed 49 straight. In another sizeable streak, Stanford completely
owns the all-time series against the Cougars (7-16,5-6), winning all
51 matchups. On top of that, the Cardinal is riding a 56-game home
winning streak.
"It's quite a record, and something that we can be part of histo
ry with," said sophomore forward Joslyn Tinkle. "So we're excit
ed."
Both teams are coming off strong victories, scoring over 90
points each. That's especially notable for WSU, which swept its
first conference series in over a decade last week in Oregon. Wash
ington State hadn't taken a two-game set in the Pac-10 since Jan
uary 2001, when it beat USC and UCLA at home.
The Cougars have shown resilience this season, approaching a
.500 Pac-10 record after winning only a pair of non-conference
games. And even then, their apparently mediocre record beguiles
their talent: according to rpiratings.com, WSU has endured the
18th-toughest schedule in the country.
Washington State has turned things around with a respectable
conference performance, and boasts the reigning Pac-10 Player of
the Week in Sage Romberg. The freshman scored 17 points off the
bench in the Cougars' come-from-behind, 67-64 win against the
Beavers last week, and put up 15 more in a 96-90 thriller over the
Ducks that saw five Cougars reach double-digit point totals.
"I feel like they've improved tremendous amounts," Tinkle
said about the Cougars. "Granted, they've struggled the past few

Sophomore forward Joslyn Tinkle and the Stanford women's basketball
team are looking to extend several streaks, including 48
straight Pac-10 wins, when the Card takes on Washington State.
years, but they've never really been
a horrible team. I feel like they've
brought in a lot of young, talented
players, and it's helped them.
They're big inside and they have
good shooters as well."
On a much shorter timescale,
Stanford has battled back from
some adversity of its own. The Car
dinal committed 20 fouls and 17
turnovers in a less-than-stellar win
at Arizona State a week ago, and
suffered through an eight-minute
stretch when no Stanford player
could find the basket. While the 72-
54 victory was a comfortable one by
most standards, it marked the Car
dinal's smallest margin of victory in
the Pac-10 season.
If anything, the stat sheet served
as a wake-up call.
"We always know what to expect
when we're playing ASU, they're a
very scrappy, aggressive, guard-ori
ented team," Tinkle said. "That's a
big weakness of ours, we're not
comfortable when teams are being
aggressive like that. So that's some
thing we've been trying to work on
and figure out this previous week,
it's a big goal of ours."
Stanford turned things around in
a big way for its match with Arizona.
After head coach Tara VanDerveer
took the players out for a team din
ner and ice cream on Friday, the
Cardinal came back and dominated

in a 91-61 pounding that, like WSU's
win over the Ducks, saw five players
break into double-digit points.
For a team that rotated its talent
ed through a somewhat fluid set of
lineups early on in the season, last
Saturday's win marks the latest in a
trend toward a more consistent
group of players getting called to
the court, at least at the outset. Se
nior point guard Jeanette Pohlen
has been locked in all year with 16.6
points per game and 44.7-percent
three-point shooting, as have junior
forward Nnemakadi Ogwumike
(16.2 points and 8.0 rebounds per
game) and senior forward Kayla
Pedersen (12.5 ppg, 8.2 rpg).
Nnemkadi's sister, freshman for
ward Chiney Ogwumike, has start
ed in all 21 games she's played in,
and is holding down that spot with
the conference's second-best shoot
ing percentage at 56.9. She's behind
only her sister, who's leading the
Pac-10 at 57.5 percent.
The fifth spot currently belongs
to junior shooting guard Lindy
La√üocque, who holds a team-best
2.8 assist-to-turnover ratio and
shoots at a 40.8-percent clip from
beyond the arc. For players like Tin
kle, who has the sixth-most starts on
the team with seven, this means the
chance of earning a spot in the rock
solid lineup may be getting a little
slimmer.
"That's something that took a
while, to get our really set-in-stone
lineup in there,"Tinkle said. "But on
any given night, whoever's playing
well will be out there [at some
point]... So for me personally ...
I'll focus on doing the best that I can
and take advantage of every second
that I'm out there."
Returning home for the first
time since Jan. 22, Stanford will tip
off with Washington State tonight at
7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
