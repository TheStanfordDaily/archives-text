# Defense key for Card's roadtrip
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
After collecting two wins and two loss
es during four consecutive games on the
Farm, Stanford men's basketball heads
north to face the Washington teams as the
second half of the Pac-10 season contin
ues.
Tonight the Cardinal (12-10,5-6 Pac
-10) will take another shot at Washington
State (16-7, 6-5), hoping to avenge last
month's 61-58 loss to the Cougars. The
upset sent Stanford back to earth after a
clutch win over Washington and marked
the first loss of a four-game losing streak,
so the Cardinal intends to alter its ap
proach this time around to enter the con
cluding portion of the season on strong
footing.
"We're seeing teams the second time
around now," said head coach Johnny
Dawkins. "We have to make our adjust
ments and get back to the basics."
Defense, for example, is a fundamental
that the Cardinal displayed strongly in the
beginning of the season and hopes to re
vive in time for tonight's game. Surprising
ly, Stanford dominated on the offensive
end and faltered defensively in last week
end's win over Arizona State. Dawkins
recognized the need for his squad to step
it up and focus on the defensive energy his
team previously demonstrated.
"We have to keep guys in front of us
and try to contest all the shots," he said.
"We didn't do a great job of that this
weekend, so we have to get back to play
ing sound defense and take pride in get
ting stops."
The second half of this matchup will be
particularly important, according to
Dawkins. He noticed that the team tends
to become stagnant toward the end of a
given game.
"You can't just settle, and I think we
did a good job during the first half of
mixing up what we were doing offen
sively," Dawkins said of the last time
Stanford faced Washington State. "In
the second half, the ball didn't go inside
as much. We have to be disciplined
enough to know when to take the shot
and when to drive it."
This is especially necessary against the
Cougars, as 11 of the last 13 games be
tween the two teams have been decided
by 10 points or less. In fact, the last time the
Card beat the Cougars in Pullman was a
67-65 overtime thriller in 2008.

But Washington State has been on a
decline recently, especially in comparison
with its solid 10-1 start. The team claimed
early victories over Gonzaga and Baylor,
but is just 6-6 since then, coming off a road
split with the Oregon schools.
Offensive aggression should be Wash
ington State's biggest weapon against the
Cardinal, with players like Klay Thomp
son (21.2 points per game), Faisal Aden
(13.6 ppg) and DeAngelo Casto (10.6
ppg) putting up big numbers this season.
Still, Dawkins expects junior guards
Jeremy Green and Jarrett Mann to match
the Cougars' top talents.
"They're our leaders in the back
court," Dawkins said of Green and Mann.
"We go as they go."
Dawkins was especially impressed
with the duo's showing against ASU last
weekend, and expects them to generate a
similar offensive output Green and
Mann, along with forward Josh Owens,
combined for 53 of Stanford's 83 points.
"When those guys are playing that
well, I think we are difficult to beat,"
Dawkins said. "We need to leam from the

last game and bottle that up, because
they can potentially play that well in a
number of games from here on out."
Though road matchups have been
tough for the Cardinal this season,
the team hopes its recent momentum
will be enough to compensate for
Washington State's home-court ad
vantage.
"We have the ability to bounce
back, and we understand the impor
tance of going to the next play with the
mindset that we have to get a win,"
Dawkins said about facing Washing
ton State the second time around.
"The coaching staff is doing a great job
of preparation. We already have a
good idea of who they are and what
we need to do to compete against
them."
Tipoff between Stanford and
Washington State is scheduled for 7
p.m. in Pullman, Wash.
