# Men's hoops needs more consistent
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
If you've been to a Stanford
men's basketball game this
year and saw something you
really didn't expect, you're not
alone.
That's because this year, even
more than the past few seasons, Stan
ford has no consistency.
A prime example mid-Janu
ary, Stanford enters a series with the
Washington schools looking to ex
tend its perfect home record. The
Cardinal is coming off a 10-point
loss to Arizona and now must take
on No. 17 Washington, which has
won six straight and nine of 10, scor
ing 87 points per game over that
span. So naturally, Stanford held the
Huskies to 56 points and snuck out
of Maples Pavilion with its biggest
win of the season. The Cardinal sud
denly had momentum and a buzz
about it, and the team carried that
over into its next game against
Washington State, holding a nine
point halftime lead. And just when
you thought all was well, Stanford
tanked in the second half as the
Cougars outscored the Cardinal,
38-26, for the win.
This inconsistency has marred
every aspect of Stanford's game this
season.The Cardinal started 9-4, then
went 1-5, then won two of its last
three. Both the offense and the de
fense have had moments of brilliance
and moments to forget at different
points this season.
In general, Stanford's saving
grace has been defense. The Cardinal
ranks in the top 40 nationally in scor
ing defense and recently went 10
straight games without allowing
more than 70 points. This streak was
then broken by Arizona, which is un
derstandable considering the Wild
cats are 20th in scoring offense.
What was less expected was Ari
zona State the Pac-10's bottom
dweller and one of the worst offen
sive teams in the nation coming
into Maples Pavilion on Saturday
and scoring 11 points above its season
average and shooting over 50 per
cent from the floor for the second
time all season.
This brings up an interesting ques
tion as to how good Stanford's de
fense actually is. At times it has been
excellent, such as the win over Wash
ington. On the other hand, the Cardi
nal only ranks 120 th in opponents'
field-goal percentage a mark that
puts the team just above the median
for the NCAA. Stanford is below av
erage in blocked shots per game and
is one of the worst teams in the coun
try in steals, so the Cardinal is certain
ly not your prototypical tough defen
sive team, but the players do play
solid team defense.
More than anything, though, the
inconsistency comes from the per
formances of the individual players,
and with Stanford's roster, this
should come as no surprise. The Car
dinal currently has zero seniors listed
on its roster, and nine of the 15 play
ers are freshmen. This youth, com
bined with the on-and-off success
from the team's more experienced
players, has caused most of the
team's inconsistency.
Last year's team, despite having
less overall talent and a 14-18 record,
had the one thing this year's team is
lacking: a reliable go-to player.
Landry Fields played every bit of that
role in 2009-2010, as he scored at least
14 points in all 32 games and shot at
least 50 percent from the field in half
of them. This kind of dependability is
crucial for the development of a
team, particularly a young team like
Stanford.
This year, though, the Cardinal
has no such go-to player. In fact, no
player has scored even five points in
every game. Stanford's leading scor
er, Jeremy Green, is shooting only 38
percent from the floor. Stanford's
leading rebounder, Josh Owens, has
been held to five or fewer rebounds
nine times this season. The other
starting upperclassman, Jarrett
Mann, has reached double digits in
points only three times all season (in
cluding twice in the last two games)
and has had more assists than
turnovers in only 10 of the team's 22
games.
And these are the most experi
