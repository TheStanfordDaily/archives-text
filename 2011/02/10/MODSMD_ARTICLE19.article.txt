# Card looks to stay perfect against SMU
## Stanford faces off with Mustangs 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
After passing its first major chal
lenge of the season with a 5-2 victo
ry over No. 4 UCLA, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team now pre
pares to host No. 28 Southern
Methodist University (4-1) Thurs
day afternoon.
Stanford (4-0) has proved that
despite its relative youth, it's well
prepared to take care of highly
ranked opponents. Freshman play
ers usually need time to become ac
climated to the pressures of playing
such a match, but this group appears
ready.
"They're really experienced play
ers already," said head coach Lele
Forood. "They've played on interna
tional stages and at Grand Slam
events. If they're intimidated by
UCLA in February, we're in trou
ble."
The experience Forood men
tioned is indeed impressive. Fresh
man Kristie Ahn has a career-high
singles ranking of 304, achieved in
June 2009 at the age of 17. She made
it to the finals of a $50,000 singles
event in Carson, Calif., before losing
to fellow American up-and-comer
CoCo Vandeweghe. She also faced
off against then-No. 7 Dinara Safina
in the first round of the 2008 U.S.
Open.
Fellow freshman Nicole Gibbs
has a career-high singles ranking of
356, achieved in September 2010,
and has played mixed doubles in the
U.S. Open with fellow American
Sam Querrey, ranked 17th in the
world on the men's side. The two
have partnered up in several ITF
events, including winning a $50,000
Pro Circuit tournament in Raleigh,
N.C. over the No. 3 seed duo of
Alexandra Mueller and Ahsha
Rolle by scores of 6-3,6-2.
With such promising futures on
the professional circuit, the girls
chose to attend Stanford for its team
dynamics and consistent level of
play.
"Having team practice is awe
some because there is no other
venue I know of where I have 10 girls
who play at a really high competitive
level, and who I can practice with
and feed off of every day," Gibbs
said. "That's been really helpful."
"The consistency of competition
in college tennis has been beneficial
to me also," she continued. "We play
so many matches that I'm really al
ways match ready. When I go to indi
vidual tournaments or professional
tournaments now, I'm playing really
well."
Still, the pair will lose occasional
ly, as it did this past weekend. Ahn
and Gibbs lost, 8-6, at the No. 2 spot
in doubles to UCLA's Hickey and

Jones. The team was able to rally
past that, eventually winning the
doubles point with victories at the
No. 1 and No. 3 spots.
"Kristie and I struggled a little bit
in the doubles, but obviously it did
n't have an impact on the overall
score," Gibbs said. "We were pretty
quickly able to shake off that loss. I
think we both turned around really
well and 1 think we were able to put
110 percent into our singles per
formance."
Faced with another tough oppo
nent in SMU Thursday afternoon,
the Cardinal will go into the match
prepared to fight against a worthy
challenger.
"SMU is a good team," Forood
said. "We saw them last year in the
NCAA Tourney in the earlier
rounds. They have some highly
ranked players in the top half of
their team so hopefully they'll be a
good challenge for our players."
As the top-ranked team in the
country and defending national
champion, the Cardinal knows that
teams like SMU approach each
matchup with Stanford with in
creased energy.
"You have to embrace it," Gibbs
said about the target on Stanford's
back. "It's something that just con
firms the fact that we're a really, re
ally solid team. At the same time, it
makes us work that much harder
knowing everyone else is in practice
thinking about how they're going to
beat Stanford in the next team com
petition."
Stanford women's tennis will
continue its march through the sea
son this afternoon against SMU at
1:30 p.m.
