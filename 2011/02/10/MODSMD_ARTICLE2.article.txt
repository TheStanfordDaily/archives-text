## Caltrain proposes to close stations 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
Caltrain officials proposed last
Thursday to shut down up to 16
train stations in the Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties, as one po
tential option to address the pro
jected $3O million deficit for fiscal
year 2011.
The budget deficit is due, in
part, to the fact that Caltrain is the
only Bay Area transit system lack

ing a permanent dedicated source
of funding. This lack of financial
backing results in a continuing
structural deficit, said Caltrain
spokeswoman Christine Dunn.
"A lot of people think public
transportation either profits or
breaks even," Dunn said. "But
what many people don't know is
that it's actually heavily subsi
dized. For example, the fare only
provides for about 44 percent of
the cost of the ride. The additional

56 percent has to come from other
sources."
Caltrain receives funds from
three primary sources: the San
Mateo County Transit District, the
Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority and the San Francisco
County Transportation Authority.
Recently, state cuts in public trans
portation funding have led to de
creased funding for Caltrain.

In an effort to manage the projected $30 million deficit for fiscal year 2011, Caltrain officials proposed to close up
to 16 of its least used train stations in Santa Clara and San Mateo.
"[Our] partners have had to re
duce their contributions," Dunn
said. "They are all transit agencies
struggling to provide core trans
portation services. We don't have
the same resources we've had in
the past."
According to Dunn, these shut
downs, in total, could offset the
deficit and leave an "affordable"
deficit of $4.7 million.
But with 74 percent of Cal
train's nearly 40,000 daily riders
relying on the commute to get to
work, Caltrain officials explored
several proposals to minimize the
impact that cuts would have on
passengers.
Stops slated for closure were se
lected because they were the least
used. These stops include South
San Francisco, San Bruno,
Burlingame, Belmont, San Anto
nio in Mountain View, Lawrence in
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara and Col
lege Park in San Jose.
Last week's proposal also
looked at eliminating weekend
and special event services, which
means the closure of three more
stations: the Stanford University
stop, which is only used during
football games; the weekend-only
station at Atherton and the week
end-only station at Broadway in
Burlingame.
Because this is the first time a

proposal for closure has emerged
for Caltrain, the commute provider
is unsure about how shutdowns
would impact "ghost" stations.
"[lt] depends on the station,"
Dunn said. "There's a large shop
ping area at California [Ave.],so I'd
imagine they might feel an impact.
However, we don't really know."
Moreover, Caltrain does not
have control over highways and
streets, and therefore cannot
change any impacts on vehicular
traffic. Current services provided
by Caltrain offset road congestion
by accommodating 300 million
passenger miles.
However, shutdowns are only
the first stage of a larger process,
said Dunn. Caltrain has its hands
full with other proposals, including
a 25-cent increase in one-way
fares, and day and monthly passes
across all zones. These increases
would be tacked on top of price
hikes implemented last year.
A public hearing will be held on
March 3 to solicit feedback from
residents and commuters.
Dunn said Caltrain's board of
directors is not expected to act
until April. Changes will be imple
mented by July 2, the start of Cal
train's fiscal year, in order "to get
the most financial benefit from the
changes," Dunn later wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
