## Caltrain proposes to close stations 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
Caltrain officials proposed last
Thursday to shut down up to 16
train stations in the Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties, as one po
tential option to address the pro
jected $3O million deficit for fiscal
year 2011.
The budget deficit is due, in
part, to the fact that Caltrain is the
only Bay Area transit system lack

ing a permanent dedicated source
of funding. This lack of financial
backing results in a continuing
structural deficit, said Caltrain
spokeswoman Christine Dunn.
"A lot of people think public
transportation either profits or
breaks even," Dunn said. "But
what many people don't know is
that it's actually heavily subsi
dized. For example, the fare only
provides for about 44 percent of
the cost of the ride. The additional

56 percent has to come from other
sources."
Caltrain receives funds from
three primary sources: the San
Mateo County Transit District, the
Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority and the San Francisco
County Transportation Authority.
Recently, state cuts in public trans
portation funding have led to de
creased funding for Caltrain.
