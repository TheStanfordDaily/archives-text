## Health care proposal to benefit students 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
The U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services proposed on
Wednesday new rules for insurers
that would offer students more of
the consumer protections created
by the health-care overhaul.
By defining college health-care

plans as individual coverage, the
proposed rules would bar insurers
from setting lifetime dollar limits
on student health plans, dropping
coverage of ill students due to pa
perwork mistakes and denying
coverage for students under age 19
with pre-existing conditions.
After the passage of the Af
fordable Care Act, college health
care plans were initially exempt
from some parts of the law, and in
dustry groups lobbied to keep
those exemptions. But under the

new proposed rules, students
would have more control of their
health care, said Health and
Human Services Secretary Kath
leen Sebelius.
"This rule would ensure that
these plans remain a viable, afford
able option for students while
guaranteeing that they are regulat
ed consistently and offer transpar
ent benefits to students," Sebelius
said in a statement on Wednesday.
