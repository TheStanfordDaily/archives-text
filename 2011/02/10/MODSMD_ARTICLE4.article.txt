# Patents complicate stem cell research
## Unclear policies cloud future of field 
### IVY NGUYEN TYLER BROWN EDITORS 
Though patents are meant to
encourage innovation, broad stem
cell patent protection could slow
research in the field, according to a
recent report by the Hinxton
Group, a body of scientists and
public policy experts who study
the ethical and legal challenges
surrounding stem cell research.
The report argues that policies
governing the sharing of intellec
tual property and scientific mate
rials, while beneficial in bringing
private investment into under
funded areas of research, may act
as legal tripwires. These policies
therefore have the potential to
slow innovation.
While assigning patent rights
for most inventions is relatively
simple because of their discrete
parts and manufacturing process
es, the task is less clear-cut in stem
cell research, where the debate
continues over what technologies
entire lines, methods for deriv
ing them or only clinical uses
should be patentable.
With its recent establishment of
the Institute for Stem Cell Biology
and Regenerative Medicine (IS
CBRM), whose new building fea
tures prominently on the School of
Medicine campus, the University
has millions of research dollars at
stake in this field.
Sharing research rights
Researchers must first make an
agreement with patent holders
when they use intellectual proper

ty not owned by their research in
stitution. So far, few Stanford re
searchers have had difficulty ac
quiring permission to use such in
formation, according to School of
Medicine professor and ISCBRM
Director Irving Weissman and bio
engineering graduate student
Blake Byers.
"Patent protection doesn't real
ly matter for academic research,
since we're in a nice bubble where
we can do research here irrespec
tive of where patents are," Byers
said.
Katharine Ku, director of the
Office of Technology Licensing
(OTL), confirmed that it's typically
easy to share intellectual property
between institutions for research
purposes.
"But when the technology is
commercialized for clinical use,
there can be a problem," Ku said.
Though Weissman's lab has not
yet encountered any licensing trou
ble to his recollection, the potential
for problems still exists, he said.
Because of the ambiguities in
stem cell patenting policy, "you
never know until you try to move
it into the sphere where you're
going to make [the technology]
useful clinically and therefore
commercially viable," Weissman
said.
That's when patent holders
take interest and could sue if the
new technology oversteps patent
restrictions.

An 'intellectual stranglehold'
Patent restrictions have been
an issue in the field of stem cell re
search since its very beginning,
when James Thompson, a Universi
ty of Wisconsin professor, isolated
the first human embryonic stem
cell.Thompson was granted patents
for three stem cell lines. Those
patents included not only how to
derive embryonic stem cells but
also all embryonically derived
pluripotent cells irrespective of the
method, allowing the patent holder
to essentially own all cells derived
from that line.
"That means that anybody in
possession of a stem cell line needs
to take a license from the patent
holder," explained Christopher
Scott, director of the Program on
Stem Cells and Society at the Cen
ter for Biomedical Ethics, who is
also a member of the Hinxton
group.
Such a broad patent becomes a
problem when the patent holder
"vacuums up" all intellectual prop
erty that might pose a competition
to their technology, a situation he
describes as an "intellectual stran
glehold".
"When technology [and] intel
lectual property are held so tightly
and not licensed broadly, it can hin
der a field," Scott said. "If you hin
der competition, you may hinder
progress to getting things to people
who need them."
Weissman calls the University of
Wisconsin's patents on embryonic
stem cells "far more restrictive"
than any other patent he knows,
and says that those restrictions af
fect the field's ability to move for
ward.

More 'socially responsible' policies
Although Ku said that few of
Stanford's stem cell patents are ac
tually licensed, Scott noted that
Stanford's "socially responsible"
licensing policies could be benefi
cial to research and development.
In the case of early biotechnology
research, Stanford followed poli
cies that encouraged the use of
technologies among a large group
of inventors or scientists a
move that launched an entire in
dustry, Scott said.
"Some argue that without that
broad licensing the biotech indus
try wouldn't exist," he added.
With Thompson's patents set to
expire in the near future, competi
tion within the field of stem cell re
search will begin to heat up. While
Scott holds that greater competi
tion is a good thing, Byers predicts
a less sunny outcome, one that is
already evident as the field ex
pands into studying new types of

stem cells. He speculates that be
cause the field is so crowded and
competition for patents is so high,
researchers might stall the process
of peer reviewing papers so they
can first claim their own patents.
"It's been almost exponentially
more difficult to get a stem cell
paper out in the last year and espe
cially around differentiation of em
bryonic stem cells," Byers said.
Clear and consistent policies for
stem cell patentability have yet to
be set. As the debate continues,
Scott said, the tension lies between
creating a competitive market with
in an intellectual framework versus
having a monopoly on the technol
ogy-
"lt's a hard line to walk," he
added.
Bigger challenges take precedence
Despite the roadblocks patent
related restrictions could cause,
researchers cited the historical
lack of federal support as the
greatest obstacle the stem cell
field faces.
"Intellectual property pales in
comparison to having the money
to do the research," Scott said. "If
you don't have the money, that,
basically, is a show stopper."
Under the Aug. 23 injunction
issued by U.S. District Judge
Royce Lamberth, which suspends
federal funding for human embry
onic stem cell research, the fu
tures of many federally funded
projects in the field are uncertain.
While researchers in California
have the support of the California
Institute for Regenerative Medi
cine to supplement missing fund
ing from the National Institute of
Health, Scott stressed the need
for federal backing.
"Though California has been an
exception to the rule, the funds
aren't going to last forever," he said.
"Since stem cells are so in vogue
and everybody's talking about
them, they think they're going to do
everything, so there are a lot of re
search dollars available," Byers
said. "But Obama still hasn't over
turned a lot of the restrictions Bush
has placed on embryonic stem cell
research." The Bush restric
tions have further stymied funding.
In his 25 years of studying bio
medical ethics, Scott said no other
field had such "a promising future
for potential therapies and treat
ments" and "was so complicated
with ethical, legal, regulatory, and
funding issues."
"Without federal policy that al
lows and encourages research on
embryonic stem cells," he conclud
ed, "it's going to be a really hard
field to move forward quickly."

derive embryonic stem cells but
also all embryonically derived
pluripotent cells irrespective of the
method, allowing the patent holder
to essentially own all cells derived
from that line.
"That means that anybody in
possession of a stem cell line needs
to take a license from the patent
holder," explained Christopher
Scott, director of the Program on
Stem Cells and Society at the Cen
ter for Biomedical Ethics, who is
also a member of the Hinxton
group.
Such a broad patent becomes a
problem when the patent holder
"vacuums up" all intellectual prop
erty that might pose a competition
to their technology, a situation he
describes as an "intellectual stran
glehold".
"When technology [and] intel
lectual property are held so tightly
and not licensed broadly, it can hin
der a field," Scott said. "If you hin
der competition, you may hinder
progress to getting things to people
who need them."
Weissman calls the University of
Wisconsin's patents on embryonic
stem cells "far more restrictive"
than any other patent he knows,
and says that those restrictions af
fect the field's ability to move for
ward.

More 'socially responsible' policies
Although Ku said that few of
Stanford's stem cell patents are ac
tually licensed, Scott noted that
Stanford's "socially responsible"
licensing policies could be benefi
cial to research and development.
In the case of early biotechnology
research, Stanford followed poli
cies that encouraged the use of
technologies among a large group
of inventors or scientists a
move that launched an entire in
dustry, Scott said.
"Some argue that without that
broad licensing the biotech indus
try wouldn't exist," he added.
With Thompson's patents set to
expire in the near future, competi
tion within the field of stem cell re
search will begin to heat up. While
Scott holds that greater competi
tion is a good thing, Byers predicts
a less sunny outcome, one that is
already evident as the field ex
pands into studying new types of

stem cells. He speculates that be
cause the field is so crowded and
competition for patents is so high,
researchers might stall the process
of peer reviewing papers so they
can first claim their own patents.
"It's been almost exponentially
more difficult to get a stem cell
paper out in the last year and espe
cially around differentiation of em
bryonic stem cells," Byers said.
Clear and consistent policies for
stem cell patentability have yet to
be set. As the debate continues,
Scott said, the tension lies between
creating a competitive market with
in an intellectual framework versus
having a monopoly on the technol
ogy-
"lt's a hard line to walk," he
added.
Bigger challenges take precedence
Despite the roadblocks patent
related restrictions could cause,
researchers cited the historical
lack of federal support as the
greatest obstacle the stem cell
field faces.
"Intellectual property pales in
comparison to having the money
to do the research," Scott said. "If
you don't have the money, that,
basically, is a show stopper."
Under the Aug. 23 injunction
issued by U.S. District Judge
Royce Lamberth, which suspends
federal funding for human embry
onic stem cell research, the fu
tures of many federally funded
projects in the field are uncertain.
While researchers in California
have the support of the California
Institute for Regenerative Medi
cine to supplement missing fund
ing from the National Institute of
Health, Scott stressed the need
for federal backing.
"Though California has been an
exception to the rule, the funds
aren't going to last forever," he said.
"Since stem cells are so in vogue
and everybody's talking about
them, they think they're going to do
everything, so there are a lot of re
search dollars available," Byers
said. "But Obama still hasn't over
turned a lot of the restrictions Bush
has placed on embryonic stem cell
research." The Bush restric
tions have further stymied funding.
In his 25 years of studying bio
medical ethics, Scott said no other
field had such "a promising future
for potential therapies and treat
ments" and "was so complicated
with ethical, legal, regulatory, and
funding issues."
"Without federal policy that al
lows and encourages research on
embryonic stem cells," he conclud
ed, "it's going to be a really hard
field to move forward quickly."

Though patents are meant to
encourage innovation, broad stem
cell patent protection could slow
research in the field, according to a
recent report by the Hinxton
Group, a body of scientists and
public policy experts who study
the ethical and legal challenges
surrounding stem cell research.
The report argues that policies
governing the sharing of intellec
tual property and scientific mate
rials, while beneficial in bringing
private investment into under
funded areas of research, may act
as legal tripwires. These policies
therefore have the potential to
slow innovation.
While assigning patent rights
for most inventions is relatively
simple because of their discrete
parts and manufacturing process
es, the task is less clear-cut in stem
cell research, where the debate
continues over what technologies
entire lines, methods for deriv
ing them or only clinical uses
should be patentable.
With its recent establishment of
the Institute for Stem Cell Biology
and Regenerative Medicine (IS
CBRM), whose new building fea
tures prominently on the School of
Medicine campus, the University
has millions of research dollars at
stake in this field.
Sharing research rights
Researchers must first make an
agreement with patent holders
when they use intellectual proper

ty not owned by their research in
stitution. So far, few Stanford re
searchers have had difficulty ac
quiring permission to use such in
formation, according to School of
Medicine professor and ISCBRM
Director Irving Weissman and bio
engineering graduate student
Blake Byers.
"Patent protection doesn't real
ly matter for academic research,
since we're in a nice bubble where
we can do research here irrespec
tive of where patents are," Byers
said.
Katharine Ku, director of the
Office of Technology Licensing
(OTL), confirmed that it's typically
easy to share intellectual property
between institutions for research
purposes.
"But when the technology is
commercialized for clinical use,
there can be a problem," Ku said.
Though Weissman's lab has not
yet encountered any licensing trou
ble to his recollection, the potential
for problems still exists, he said.
Because of the ambiguities in
stem cell patenting policy, "you
never know until you try to move
it into the sphere where you're
going to make [the technology]
useful clinically and therefore
commercially viable," Weissman
said.
That's when patent holders
take interest and could sue if the
new technology oversteps patent
restrictions.

An 'intellectual stranglehold'
Patent restrictions have been
an issue in the field of stem cell re
search since its very beginning,
when James Thompson, a Universi
ty of Wisconsin professor, isolated
the first human embryonic stem
cell.Thompson was granted patents
for three stem cell lines. Those
patents included not only how to
derive embryonic stem cells but
also all embryonically derived
pluripotent cells irrespective of the
