# Patents complicate stem cell research
## Unclear policies cloud future of field 
### IVY NGUYEN TYLER BROWN EDITORS 
Though patents are meant to
encourage innovation, broad stem
cell patent protection could slow
research in the field, according to a
recent report by the Hinxton
Group, a body of scientists and
public policy experts who study
the ethical and legal challenges
surrounding stem cell research.
The report argues that policies
governing the sharing of intellec
tual property and scientific mate
rials, while beneficial in bringing
private investment into under
funded areas of research, may act
as legal tripwires. These policies
therefore have the potential to
slow innovation.
While assigning patent rights
for most inventions is relatively
simple because of their discrete
parts and manufacturing process
es, the task is less clear-cut in stem
cell research, where the debate
continues over what technologies
entire lines, methods for deriv
ing them or only clinical uses
should be patentable.
With its recent establishment of
the Institute for Stem Cell Biology
and Regenerative Medicine (IS
CBRM), whose new building fea
tures prominently on the School of
Medicine campus, the University
has millions of research dollars at
stake in this field.
Sharing research rights
Researchers must first make an
agreement with patent holders
when they use intellectual proper

ty not owned by their research in
stitution. So far, few Stanford re
searchers have had difficulty ac
quiring permission to use such in
formation, according to School of
Medicine professor and ISCBRM
Director Irving Weissman and bio
engineering graduate student
Blake Byers.
"Patent protection doesn't real
ly matter for academic research,
since we're in a nice bubble where
we can do research here irrespec
tive of where patents are," Byers
said.
Katharine Ku, director of the
Office of Technology Licensing
(OTL), confirmed that it's typically
easy to share intellectual property
between institutions for research
purposes.
"But when the technology is
commercialized for clinical use,
there can be a problem," Ku said.
Though Weissman's lab has not
yet encountered any licensing trou
ble to his recollection, the potential
for problems still exists, he said.
Because of the ambiguities in
stem cell patenting policy, "you
never know until you try to move
it into the sphere where you're
going to make [the technology]
useful clinically and therefore
commercially viable," Weissman
said.
That's when patent holders
take interest and could sue if the
new technology oversteps patent
restrictions.
