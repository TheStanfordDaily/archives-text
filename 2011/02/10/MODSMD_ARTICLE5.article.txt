## Researchers create new heart cells Med school scientists use stems cells to treat heart disease 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Stanford researchers at the School of
Medicine can now march to the sound of a
different beat. In a study published yester
day, associate professor of neurobiology Ri
cardo Dolmetsch and his team unveiled a
technique that, for the first time, allows scien
tists to convert human skin cells to heart cells
and develop treatments for cardiac deficien
cies.
This novel approach, inspired by a similar
experiment conducted by Japanese re-


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
searchers four years ago, involves re
programming adult skin cells to a
stem-cell-like state, known as in
duced pluripotent stem cells (iPS),
so that they can "differentiate" into
other types of cells â€”in this case
cardiomyocytes.
The study focused on treating a
genetic disease commonly found
among autistic children and tested
20 different drugs on cells suffering
from irregular heartbeats, or ar
rhythmia.
Those suffering from Timothy
syndrome have overly lengthy
heartbeats, a symptom known as
long QT. Long QT, which is caused
by a deficient calcium channel and
occurs in one out of 7,000 people,
slows down heart rate by 50 percent.
A typical human heart generates 60
beats per minute. Sufferers of Timo
thy syndrome have an average lifes
pan of less than three years.
"Timothy syndrome is a life
threatening disorder for reasons not
understood," Dolmetsch said. "Part
of it was that the heartbeats were too
long and were fatal. We wanted to
understand all of the underlying rea
sons."
Using special dyes, Dolmetsch
can now examine the human heart
at a molecular level and determine
the exact source of Timothy syn
drome.

But he hasn't been the only one
trying to find a cure.
"Lots of drugs treat this rare dis
order [but] most don't work very
well," Dolmetsch said.
In fact, when researchers in Dol
metsch's lab tested some commer
cial drugs available to long QT pa
tients, they found that one such drug,
roscovitine, actually generated long
QT symptoms.
He noted that existing drugs
have been tested using cells from
mice. But the structural differences
between the human heart and that
of mice are too great to create accu
rate parallels in medicine. The nor
mal heart rate of a mouse is much
higher than a human, clocking in at
500 beats per minute.
"We're excited that this might be
a potential way of identifying new
drugs," said Dolmetsch of the latest
research.
"This is just the beginning of a set
of studies," he added. "A whole
bunch of papers will follow."
Dolmetsch and his research team
have already begun to recruit pa
tients with other problems, such as
velo-cardio-facial syndrome, a dis
order involving deficiencies on spe
cific chromosomes, and overlap car
diac arrhythmia, another long QT
disease.
"There are many things that you
can do with his technology," Dol
metsch added. "We can revolutionize
the way we study [disease] in people."
