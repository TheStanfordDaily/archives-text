## Report burns Palo Alto Fire Department 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
A report from the Palo Alto Fire Fighters' union
released Feb. 6 revealed that the city's Fire Depart

The Fire Services Utilization and Resources Study
report said the Fire Department "has become a stag
nant organization and management is struggling, due
in part to insufficient support staff."

Fire Department was positive, TriData Division, the
consultants with whom the union worked to publish
the report, listed 48 recommendations for improve
ment. Areas of concern included the training and de
velopment of officers, the need to merge two fire sta
tions and combining some fire administrative func
tions, wrote assistant city manager Pamela Antil in an
e-mail to The Daily.
The 190-page study also said the lapse between
dispatch time and turnout time how long it takes
for equipment to be ready for use at the emergency
site was too long.
Palo Alto Professional Firefighters' Union presi
dent Tony Spitaleri is confident that recommenda
tions on resource sharing could be put into effect im
mediately, but he said improving reaction times
would require additional studies and observations of
their impact on Palo Alto neighborhoods.
"We have a minimum requirement of people on
duty ... we want to look if that has an impact on how
resources are deployed," Spitaleri said. "This is an
issue that needs a lot of discussion. When you start re
ducing staffing level, the number of folks who re
spond to emergencies [or] when you start reducing
physicians, you put firefighters and citizens in jeop
ardy."
In addition, Spitaleri emphasized the importance
of improving dispatch, a problem area that will be
