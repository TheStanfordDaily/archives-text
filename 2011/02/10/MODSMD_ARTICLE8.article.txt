## EYE OF THE TIGER MOM Amy Chua's article on Chinese parenting roars across campus, inciting debate 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
There's been a lot of tiger hunting
over the Internet in the past sev
eral weeks. Tiger mom hunt
ing, that is.

In a pre-publication book ex
cerpt published in "The Wall Street
Journal," provocatively titled "Why
Chinese Mothers are Superior,"
Yale Law School professor Amy
Chua recounts her harrowing suc
cesses with traditional Chinese par
enting, which she calls a recipe for
"math whizzes and music prodigies."
Chua's bluntly earnest and highly
contentious "tiger mother" tenets have
stirred enormous Internet debate: her
WSJ.com article racked more than 7,700
comments and scored over a million views. It's
a rather crafty marketing strategy on behalf of
Chua, who is receiving free publicity, though
much of it comes in the form of displeased out
cries from those whom Chua calls "Western par
ents" expressing deep disgust for what they con
sider a militaristic and cruel parenting method
that is, in the long term, socially and emotionally
damaging.
So what exactly is it about Chua's memoir (not
a "Parenting 101" manual) that provokes "West
ern parents" to recoil so defensively?
According to some Stanford professors,
buried underneath the emotional outcry is a
deep American fear of the fragile future of the
United States' role in the global economy.
"We're in a period of great worry," said Hazel
Markus, a psychology professor. "We're concerned
about China's potential global dominance."
The results of multiple studies suggest that China's students
are academically outperforming the rest, confirming a general
unease with the U.S.'s declining role in global commerce.
Paula Moya, an english professor who co-teaches Introduc
tion to Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) with
Markus, remarked that the paranoia of "Chinese superiority" is
not entirely unfounded.
"There is a well-known [stereotype] of the academic excel
lence of Asian-Americans, who are scoring higher," Moya said.
"There was a recent study that showed that students in Shanghai
outscored the competition."
The scores that Moya is referring to came from the 2009 Pro-

gram for
International Stu-

dent Assessment
(PIS A), the results of which were released in December of 2010.
Sixty-three nations participated in the assessment. While Amer
ican students scored a respectable average 17th, 23rd, and
31st in reading, science and math, respectively students in
Shanghai outstripped the global competition by placing first in
all three categories.
Such results, Professor Markus believes, contribute greatly to

uic iinuuie uidbb giuwing icais> ui uic
United States' shrinking economic role.
"We have not only a fear of China, but also a
fear of child-rearing," Markus noted. "This applies
especially for middle class parents. [Chua] has hit a
nerve. We are worried about not only our place in
the world, but also about the future of our children,
which now seems rather shaky."
Chua's narration of her zero tolerance for
failure policy strikes a more personal chord with

those who acknowledge the potential risk ot long
term scarring, both physical and emotional, on the
child.
"There's the huge obsession that Asian par
ents seem to have with success," Ze Xiao 'll
said. "Yes, your kids will be academically and
financially successful on the outside. On the
inside, however, you could be screwing up
your kids' chance at happiness."
Xiao, however, also acknowledged
that Chua's fierce regimen (which in
cludes three hours of instrument practice
per day, no sleepovers and nothing less
than straight A's), though seeming to
gravitate toward an extreme, is relatively
tame in comparison to some of the Asian
parents she has seen.
"I can see why some parents would
be so sensitive about it," Xiao said. "But I've
seen worse parenting. I've definitely heard
of parents who beat their kids, so the article
didn't anger me so much."
On Stanford's campus, students who have
grown up with Westernized Chinese parents did
not find Chua's practices surprising in theory, but
were taken aback by how Chua put them into prac
tice.
"I kind of knew about the fierce Chinese mother
.hing," Chloe Yeung 'l3 said. "I grew up with Western
ized Chinese parents, but I have friends who went
through that kind of an experience, so what the article said
hit pretty close to home. I think what she's done is a little
over the top."
Many students, while disapproving of the cold strict
ness of Chua's parental method, may also find grains of
truth among her derogatory name-calling and stinginess
with privileges.
"A lot of children really are lazy," Yeung said. "There's
a book we read last year ["Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell]
that mentioned when you want to get really good at some
thing, you have to invest a lot of effort, which means a lot of
practice. It's a great way to gain a skill, even if you don't end up
wantinp to continue with it."

To some students, behind the veneer of the compassionless
drilling that Chua described lies a genuine belief that one's child
will succeed.
"I found myself agreeing with some of the points she made,"
Xiao said. "Especially how Western parents tend to 'allow' fail
ure the way Western parents let their kids fail while Asian
parents believe that their kids can do it, which is why they push
so hard."
Others, however, see the incited controversy as merely the re
sult of a clever marketing ploy that has taken advantage of the
tension between significantly polar Western and Asian cultural
practices.
"From what I can tell, it's mostly a self-promoting piece with
little real substance and more of a provocation for sales," said
David Palumbo-Liu, comparative literature professor and di
rector of Asian American studies.

Regardless of Chua's intentions in authoring her book, she
has undoubtedly sparked a much-needed discussion of cultural
stereotyping when it comes to parenting.
"We like to think that we've got it right," Markus said. "[But]
what's important for people to get out of this is that we need to
come to terms about accepting the cultural realities on parent
ingâ€” that there are multiple models for
parenting. Just because it looks
strict doesn't mean that it is
not a loving relationship." \

ure the way Western parents let their kids fail while Asian
parents believe that their kids can do it, which is why they push
so hard."
Others, however, see the incited controversy as merely the re
sult of a clever marketing ploy that has taken advantage of the
tension between significantly polar Western and Asian cultural
practices.
"From what I can tell, it's mostly a self-promoting piece with
little real substance and more of a provocation for sales," said
David Palumbo-Liu, comparative literature professor and di
rector of Asian American studies.

Regardless of Chua's intentions in authoring her book, she
has undoubtedly sparked a much-needed discussion of cultural
stereotyping when it comes to parenting.
"We like to think that we've got it right," Markus said. "[But]
what's important for people to get out of this is that we need to
come to terms about accepting the cultural realities on parent
ingâ€” that there are multiple models for
parenting. Just because it looks
strict doesn't mean that it is
not a loving relationship." \

There's been a lot of tiger hunting
over the Internet in the past sev
eral weeks. Tiger mom hunt
ing, that is.

In a pre-publication book ex
cerpt published in "The Wall Street
Journal," provocatively titled "Why
Chinese Mothers are Superior,"
Yale Law School professor Amy
Chua recounts her harrowing suc
cesses with traditional Chinese par
enting, which she calls a recipe for
"math whizzes and music prodigies."
Chua's bluntly earnest and highly
contentious "tiger mother" tenets have
stirred enormous Internet debate: her
WSJ.com article racked more than 7,700
comments and scored over a million views. It's
a rather crafty marketing strategy on behalf of
Chua, who is receiving free publicity, though
much of it comes in the form of displeased out
cries from those whom Chua calls "Western par
ents" expressing deep disgust for what they con
sider a militaristic and cruel parenting method
that is, in the long term, socially and emotionally
damaging.
So what exactly is it about Chua's memoir (not
a "Parenting 101" manual) that provokes "West
ern parents" to recoil so defensively?
According to some Stanford professors,
buried underneath the emotional outcry is a
deep American fear of the fragile future of the
United States' role in the global economy.
"We're in a period of great worry," said Hazel
Markus, a psychology professor. "We're concerned
about China's potential global dominance."
The results of multiple studies suggest that China's students
are academically outperforming the rest, confirming a general
unease with the U.S.'s declining role in global commerce.
Paula Moya, an english professor who co-teaches Introduc
tion to Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) with
Markus, remarked that the paranoia of "Chinese superiority" is
not entirely unfounded.
"There is a well-known [stereotype] of the academic excel
lence of Asian-Americans, who are scoring higher," Moya said.
"There was a recent study that showed that students in Shanghai
outscored the competition."
The scores that Moya is referring to came from the 2009 Pro-

gram for
International Stu-

dent Assessment
(PIS A), the results of which were released in December of 2010.
Sixty-three nations participated in the assessment. While Amer
ican students scored a respectable average 17th, 23rd, and
31st in reading, science and math, respectively students in
Shanghai outstripped the global competition by placing first in
all three categories.
Such results, Professor Markus believes, contribute greatly to

uic iinuuie uidbb giuwing icais> ui uic
United States' shrinking economic role.
"We have not only a fear of China, but also a
fear of child-rearing," Markus noted. "This applies
especially for middle class parents. [Chua] has hit a
nerve. We are worried about not only our place in
the world, but also about the future of our children,
which now seems rather shaky."
Chua's narration of her zero tolerance for
failure policy strikes a more personal chord with

those who acknowledge the potential risk ot long
term scarring, both physical and emotional, on the
child.
"There's the huge obsession that Asian par
ents seem to have with success," Ze Xiao 'll
said. "Yes, your kids will be academically and
financially successful on the outside. On the
inside, however, you could be screwing up
your kids' chance at happiness."
Xiao, however, also acknowledged
that Chua's fierce regimen (which in
cludes three hours of instrument practice
per day, no sleepovers and nothing less
than straight A's), though seeming to
gravitate toward an extreme, is relatively
tame in comparison to some of the Asian
parents she has seen.
"I can see why some parents would
be so sensitive about it," Xiao said. "But I've
seen worse parenting. I've definitely heard
of parents who beat their kids, so the article
didn't anger me so much."
On Stanford's campus, students who have
grown up with Westernized Chinese parents did
not find Chua's practices surprising in theory, but
were taken aback by how Chua put them into prac
tice.
"I kind of knew about the fierce Chinese mother
.hing," Chloe Yeung 'l3 said. "I grew up with Western
ized Chinese parents, but I have friends who went
through that kind of an experience, so what the article said
hit pretty close to home. I think what she's done is a little
over the top."
Many students, while disapproving of the cold strict
ness of Chua's parental method, may also find grains of
truth among her derogatory name-calling and stinginess
with privileges.
"A lot of children really are lazy," Yeung said. "There's
a book we read last year ["Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell]
that mentioned when you want to get really good at some
thing, you have to invest a lot of effort, which means a lot of
practice. It's a great way to gain a skill, even if you don't end up
wantinp to continue with it."

To some students, behind the veneer of the compassionless
drilling that Chua described lies a genuine belief that one's child
will succeed.
"I found myself agreeing with some of the points she made,"
Xiao said. "Especially how Western parents tend to 'allow' fail
ure the way Western parents let their kids fail while Asian
