## REALITY CHECK In Defense of the Busy 
### Alex Hicks-Nelson 
As I bear witness to ever more
Op-Ed and The New York
Times prophets, it becomes
increasingly apparent to me that
there is a certain disconnect between
those who are excessively burdened
with academics, and those that rumi
nate yearly on how to de-stress
them. While more tightly regulated
articles craft factoids, snippets and
reams of research into factors and
causes, The Daily's past is riddled
with quasi-useful stories about how
columnists have dealt with stressful
and busy times. Perhaps the most in
furiating prescription recommended
by peers through history this "ig
nore your deadlines and go have fun "
paradox has never been explicitly
challenged. Not to my satisfaction,
anyway, and I'm not so introverted
as to think I'm alone in my malcon
tent. I thought I'd take the time to
compile a few of the faults with this
silly tidbit of advice, in the hope that
we as a university might move be
yond such superficial jargon to a
more productive solution.

"Ignore your deadlines and go
have fun" necessarily attributes a
frivolousness to the deadlines of
your average Stanford student.
Sure, you have a paper due, but your
favorite band is swinging through
Palo Alto. You might never see them
again!... In Palo A1t0... But who
cares, it's just a paper, you need to
enjoy your life. On the flipside, this
particular paper could be worth a
hefty percentage of your overall
grade. You might get home too en
thralled by the memory of the awe
someness and forget all about the
paper, or do such a piss-poor job on
it that you are forced to rewrite it.
Maybe the professor is so sickened
by the work that they refuse to let
you rewrite it. Heck, there are class
es lurking out there with papers
worth 30-50 percent of your final
grade. Is this the type of deadline
that should be shirked? Even prob
lem sets, arguably the most tedious
form of busy work I've encountered
here on the Farm, add up. Missing
one might only minimally impact
your grade, but it will severely im
pact your understanding of the ma
terial. Last week's PS #5 could be
next week's exam question #7, and
there is no way to predict for such a
thing.
In the same vein, most advice-giv
ing Op-Ed writers take the stance
that their busy friends somehow are
oblivious to the fact that they are
busy and need a break. Now, I only
have a cursory knowledge of the
wide variety of majors, but as a pre

veterinary biology major, I can safe
ly say that no day goes by where I'm
just passively fulfilling my prerequi
sites. Most of them threaten to jump
start that apathetic part of me that
wants to major in underwater basket
weaving. Would I like to take a
break? Of course. It is always just a
matter of closing my textbook. Con
sidering how little of what we do ap
plies to our individual passions, I'd
say it is a testament to the resolve of
the Stanford student that we aren't
all out chatting with friends, plaiting
each others' hair and "bro-ing" it up
around the Oval.
Ultimately, I strongly believe
these misguided Op-Ed folks of yes
teryear have mainly missed the mark
by addressing students about their
lack of free time. When it comes
down to it, you didn't mandate 15
hours worth of studying for a three
unit class. You didn't teach a lecture
series such that office hours become
less of an option and more of a ne
cessity. It boggles the mind to think
that my fellow student, someone
who is just as bogged down by
exams, reading assignments, practice
work and other minutiae as I am,
could ever put more pressure on me
as an individual by saying that I need
to work harder to fit in more time for
myself. Here would be a perfect
place to introduce a mechanic alter
ing entity, something that could actu
ally enforce the boundaries on
schoolwork to help promote stu
dents leaving their rooms/the li
braries/whatever other little place
they've found to hide and scribble in.
Stanford itself, and not its student
body, should take charge of the hum
drum tomfoolery that is the unit to
effort ratio. Babbling at us does little
to change the nature of the machine,
over which we have paltry power.

Busy and want to commune from
your scribble location? Alex wants to
hear it! Email her with comments at

place to introduce a mechanic alter
ing entity, something that could actu
ally enforce the boundaries on
schoolwork to help promote stu
dents leaving their rooms/the li
braries/whatever other little place
they've found to hide and scribble in.
Stanford itself, and not its student
body, should take charge of the hum
drum tomfoolery that is the unit to
effort ratio. Babbling at us does little
to change the nature of the machine,
over which we have paltry power.

Busy and want to commune from
your scribble location? Alex wants to
hear it! Email her with comments at

No day goes by where I
am passively fulfilling
my prerequisites
