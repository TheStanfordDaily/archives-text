## EDITORIAL What to do about Caltrain 
### 
Caltrain moves an average of
44,000 passengers per week
day up and down the San
Francisco Peninsula. It is also an ex
tremely efficient form of transit,
covering 44 percent of its costs
through fares, a higher percentage
than any other Bay Area transit op
eration except for BART. Adminis
trative costs for Caltrain are among
the lowest of local transit agencies.
More importantly, Caltrain allevi
ates the need for 2.5 lanes of traffic
on local highways and requires
roughly half as much fuel per pas
senger-mile as automobiles.
Despite its importance and suc
cess, Caltrain is in trouble. Due to a
lack of dedicated funding, the com
muter rail line is facing the possibil
ity of a $3O million budget gap. Cal
train's proposed solution would
eliminate all weekend and non
rush hour service, as well as up to 16
stations. Instead of watching one of
the Peninsula's most important
public institutions flounder, local
governments, citizens and students
must work together to ensure that
Caltrain receives the level of fund
ing and respect it deserves.
Unlike other public transporta
tion systems, Caltrain is not funded
by a dedicated source such as a
sales or gas tax. In place of such a
source, Caltrain receives 34 percent
of its funding from three other
agencies: the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA),
San Mateo County Transit District
and City and County of San Fran
cisco. This year, however, the agen
cies are expected to reduce their
contributions by approximately
$lO million each in order to cover
their own financial obligations,
leading to the $3O million deficit.
There are many responsible
ways to approach this problem, but
none of them involve large cuts in
service. Elimination of weekend
service alone would force roughly
18,000 passengers to seek new
transportation options. The pro
posed cuts would make getting to
and from San Francisco Interna
tional Airport via train impossible
during afternoons, evenings and
weekends. Stanford students who
rely on Caltrain to access the air
port, as well as the city of San Fran
cisco, would have to buy or borrow
cars. Baseball fans also have reason

to worry. Without nighttime serv
ice, 417,000 passengers per season
would have to find alternate trans
portation to San Francisco Giants
games.

The VTA has proposed several
alternatives including selling some
of Caltrain's less active stations and
using money set aside for the inac
tive Dumbarton Rail project. The
VTA has also offered to pay back a
$7.4 million loan from Caltrain.
Taken together, these proposals
might be able to delay the most
drastic service cuts, but they are not
a long-term solution. What Cal
train needs is stable, dedicated
funding that is not conditional on
the goodwill and solvency of other
agencies.

A dedicated source of funding
for Caltrain is not just away out of
this year's budget crisis. By reduc
ing the variability of its revenues,
Caltrain will be able to plan and
make year-to-year investments
without worrying about large
deficits that do not result from
changes in its revenues or expendi
tures. Of course, nothing in life is
free, so where should this money
come from?
Paired with modest reductions in
weekend service, a broad-based tax
to meet Caltrain's budgetary re
quirements wouldn't need to be
large. Local governments should ex
plore funding Caltrain with a one
half to one-cent gas tax, which would
have the added benefit of reducing
traffic congestion and carbon emis
sions. Congestion and carbon emis
sions both impose huge externalities
on society. During rush hour in
urban areas, an additional car trip
can cost up to $2OO in other drivers'
wasted time. Climate change result
ing from carbon emissions will likely
cost trillions of dollars over the next
century. Pricing these ills would be a
good idea even if Caltrain were not
desperate for money.
Stanford University and the Bay
Area that surrounds it can rightly
claim to be wonderful places to live.
Part of what makes them great is
quick train service between San
Francisco and San Jose, and a re
grettable aspect of life here is traf
fic congestion on the freeways.
Keeping Caltrain service robust
should be one of the top priorities
for local officials.
