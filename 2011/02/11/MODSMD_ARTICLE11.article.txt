## Supporting ROTC Supports Queer Rights 
### 
A As The Daily reported in an
article titled "SSQL gathers
signatures to protest
ROTC's return" (Feb. 7), Stanford
Students for Queer Liberation
(SSQL) has been mounting a cam
paign against the return of ROTC
on the basis that the military still
discriminates against transgender
individuals. As queer students and
supporters of greater transgender
rights, we applaud SSQL's efforts to
draw attention to these issues. That
being said, we are concerned that
the antagonistic approach taken by
SSQL is not representative of the
larger queer community and may
halt further progress for queer
rights in the military.
The repeal of "don't ask, don't
tell" was an unquestionable victory
for gay rights advocates. It marks a
significant milestone in what has
been a recent and dramatic shift to
wards increased support for gay
rights. Rather than celebrate with
rest of the queer community, SSQL
simply moved the goal posts back in
its aggressive anti-military campaign.
For the first time in the history of
this country, representatives are
taking queer voices seriously. Their
consideration will do much to fur
ther social justice, but it merits a re
sponse of gratitude and reciprocal

action from the queer and allied
constituents. By continuing to an
tagonize the military, SSQL sends
the message that no serious conces
sions will ever satisfy the communi
ty. This kind of approach under
mines organizational credibility for
future advocacy work. Negotiation
requires compromise from both
sides, and SSQL refuses to acknowl
edge that reality. In doing so, they
obstruct further progress at the
Congressional level.
Allowing ROTC's return
demonstrates that the queer com
munity understands that progress is
a process and that it is willing to
continue that stepwise process, in
cluding promoting equality for the
transgender population. We must
be willing to work with those that
disagree with us if we are to have
permanent change.
Furthermore, Stanford Universi
ty, as a premier institution of learn
ing, trains the future leaders in prac
tically every field. Its students carry
with them the values of tolerance
and equality that are embodied in
its mission and forward-thinking
culture Stanford ROTC graduates
will be future military leaders who
are equipped not just with military
training but also the values of this
institution. Their courageous lead
ership will undoubtedly promote
progress from within the organiza
tion.

We would like to reemphasize
that the repeal of DADT is not the
final step in the struggle for queer
equality in the military. Transgen
der students deserve equal access
to ROTC's benefits, and we should
continue to press our leaders for

this legislation. We cannot expect
this change to be immediate. No
civil rights movement has ever hap
pened overnight. What we can do is
accept DADT's repeal as a step in
the right direction and use this
progress as a stepping-stone for fur
ther progress. We hope that the
queer community will recognize
the opportunity for exchange and
learning that ROTC's return will
bring and support the members of
our greater Stanford community
who will be the emissaries of our
values.
