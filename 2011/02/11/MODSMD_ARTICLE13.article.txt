# MARKS MY WORDS
## The 						S-Word: Part I 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Last weekend, I went to Vegas
for the second time in my life.
The first time, I was in 4th
grade and with my parents; this
time I was in the company of sever
al other 21 and 22-year-olds. While
I arguably should have come away
from the trip with a massive hang
over, a new tattoo and an im
promptu marriage, I instead came
away with a bad cold and a myriad
of thoughts about what it means to
tell someone that you go to Stan
ford.

My story begins with the obser
vation that people in Vegas like to
meet each other. The process is fa
cilitated by the fact that people in
Vegas are drunk at almost every
hour of the day, and this aptly
named "liquid courage" allows
them to make new friends (and
friends) without inhibition. As a re
sult, one is often asked, "Where are
you from?"
It was 10 p.m. on the day of our
arrival, and my friends and I were

in the elevator of Caesars Palace.
As we feverishly planned our de
parture forTao, we chattered giddi
ly and consequently made our
selves quite vulnerable to in
quiries. When the person in the el
evator asked us where we were
from, we all froze. The milliseconds
crept slowly by as we each won
dered what to say. At long last I
jumped in and said, "San Francis
co!"

In Vegas, saying that you're
from San Francisco is perfectly in
nocuous. One club promoter re
sponded with, "Oh, I used to live in
the Bay!," to which we chanted,
"Yay Areaaa" (a la E-40). A polite

employee of the Sapphire Gentle
men's Club described her longing
for the scenery of Monterey. A
group of 40-year-old men from Or
ange County tried to strike up a
friendly NorCal-SoCal rivalry
even as they offered to make us
drinks in their suite. We declined
the offer.

Alas, two of my friends had a
slip-up. One fateful night, over the
craps table of our hotel, one of my
friends answered the question all
too specifically. "Where're you
from?" "Stanford." Unfortunately,
she was mockingly nicknamed
"Stanford" for the rest of the night.
"Hey, Stanford, have you been to
Vegas before?" "Hey, Stanford,
want a drink?" "Hey, Stanford . . .

The next day, I blundered as
well. My friends and I were
strolling through the Bellagio
when a club promoter accosted us.

"Hey ladies, are you going out
tonight?" "Uhhh . . . yeah?" He
asked which clubs we had visited
the night before, promptly dis
missed them as "not really happen
ing" and began to laud his club,
The Bank, as our next destination.
Then he gave us his card.
Looking at the name, I realized
he was Arab and wondered if I
should try and strike up a conver
sation with him with my limited
formal Arabic skills. Seeing my
gaze fixed stupidly on his business
card, he finally jumped in and said,
"I'm Egyptian."
This was a big deal for two rea
sons: not only is Egypt a popular
news item these days, but also I'm
writing my senior honors thesis
about patterns of marriage among
Egyptian youth. So, like an idiot, I
exclaimed, "That's so cool! I'm
writing my senior honors thesis
about patterns of marriage
amongst Egyptian youth!" For
extra good measure, I told him that
I was studying Arabic in college.
The guy gave me one of those "I
really don't care that you're excit
ed" looks and then said in a not
quite-joking tone, "What, are you
smart or something?" I froze, again
for a few long milliseconds, before I
said, "Ha, no, I mean, I'm in college,
so I'm writing a thesis, it's not a big

deal, um ..." Note: the word Stan
ford never made an appearance,
but I might as well have said it at
that point.
His question has since stuck in
my mind. If I were "smart," would
that be bad? If I go to Stanford, is
that bad? In retrospect, telling him
about my honors thesis was a mis
take it is never tactful to volun
tarily demonstrate how smart or
accomplished you may be. But
does that demand that we as Stan
ford students should have to pur
posefully evade the "where're you
from" question? In an ideal world,
no. In this world? Maybe.
I've come to accept that it is not
something to make public. Reveal
ing the Stanford connection or
dropping the "S bomb," as some
say requires a lot of careful
thought. From now on I know that
my permanent default answer to
the "where're you from" question
will be "San Francisco," and, in
many a case, it will be the most ap
propriate answer.
They say that what happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas, and I'd like to
add an addendum: what is happen
ing in your life might not want to be
happening in Vegas ... especially if
what is happening in your life is
your college career at an elite insti
tution.

Last weekend, I went to Vegas
for the second time in my life.
The first time, I was in 4th
grade and with my parents; this
time I was in the company of sever
al other 21 and 22-year-olds. While
I arguably should have come away
from the trip with a massive hang
over, a new tattoo and an im
promptu marriage, I instead came
away with a bad cold and a myriad
of thoughts about what it means to
tell someone that you go to Stan
ford.

My story begins with the obser
vation that people in Vegas like to
meet each other. The process is fa
cilitated by the fact that people in
Vegas are drunk at almost every
hour of the day, and this aptly
named "liquid courage" allows
them to make new friends (and
friends) without inhibition. As a re
sult, one is often asked, "Where are
you from?"
It was 10 p.m. on the day of our
arrival, and my friends and I were

in the elevator of Caesars Palace.
As we feverishly planned our de
parture forTao, we chattered giddi
ly and consequently made our
selves quite vulnerable to in
quiries. When the person in the el
evator asked us where we were
from, we all froze. The milliseconds
crept slowly by as we each won
dered what to say. At long last I
jumped in and said, "San Francis
co!"

In Vegas, saying that you're
from San Francisco is perfectly in
nocuous. One club promoter re
sponded with, "Oh, I used to live in
the Bay!," to which we chanted,
"Yay Areaaa" (a la E-40). A polite

employee of the Sapphire Gentle
men's Club described her longing
for the scenery of Monterey. A
group of 40-year-old men from Or
ange County tried to strike up a
friendly NorCal-SoCal rivalry
even as they offered to make us
drinks in their suite. We declined
the offer.

Alas, two of my friends had a
slip-up. One fateful night, over the
craps table of our hotel, one of my
friends answered the question all
too specifically. "Where're you
from?" "Stanford." Unfortunately,
she was mockingly nicknamed
"Stanford" for the rest of the night.
"Hey, Stanford, have you been to
Vegas before?" "Hey, Stanford,
want a drink?" "Hey, Stanford . . .

The next day, I blundered as
well. My friends and I were
strolling through the Bellagio
when a club promoter accosted us.

"Hey ladies, are you going out
tonight?" "Uhhh . . . yeah?" He
asked which clubs we had visited
the night before, promptly dis
missed them as "not really happen
ing" and began to laud his club,
The Bank, as our next destination.
Then he gave us his card.
Looking at the name, I realized
he was Arab and wondered if I
should try and strike up a conver
sation with him with my limited
formal Arabic skills. Seeing my
gaze fixed stupidly on his business
card, he finally jumped in and said,
"I'm Egyptian."
This was a big deal for two rea
sons: not only is Egypt a popular
news item these days, but also I'm
writing my senior honors thesis
about patterns of marriage among
Egyptian youth. So, like an idiot, I
exclaimed, "That's so cool! I'm
writing my senior honors thesis
about patterns of marriage
amongst Egyptian youth!" For
extra good measure, I told him that
I was studying Arabic in college.
The guy gave me one of those "I
really don't care that you're excit
ed" looks and then said in a not
quite-joking tone, "What, are you
smart or something?" I froze, again
for a few long milliseconds, before I
said, "Ha, no, I mean, I'm in college,
so I'm writing a thesis, it's not a big

deal, um ..." Note: the word Stan
ford never made an appearance,
but I might as well have said it at
that point.
His question has since stuck in
my mind. If I were "smart," would
that be bad? If I go to Stanford, is
that bad? In retrospect, telling him
