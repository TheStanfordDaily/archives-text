# MARKS MY WORDS
## The
						S-Word: Part I 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Last weekend, I went to Vegas
for the second time in my life.
The first time, I was in 4th
grade and with my parents; this
time I was in the company of sever
al other 21 and 22-year-olds. While
I arguably should have come away
from the trip with a massive hang
over, a new tattoo and an im
promptu marriage, I instead came
away with a bad cold and a myriad
of thoughts about what it means to
tell someone that you go to Stan
ford.

My story begins with the obser
vation that people in Vegas like to
meet each other. The process is fa
cilitated by the fact that people in
Vegas are drunk at almost every
hour of the day, and this aptly
named "liquid courage" allows
them to make new friends (and
friends) without inhibition. As a re
sult, one is often asked, "Where are
you from?"
It was 10 p.m. on the day of our
arrival, and my friends and I were

in the elevator of Caesars Palace.
As we feverishly planned our de
parture forTao, we chattered giddi
ly and consequently made our
selves quite vulnerable to in
quiries. When the person in the el
evator asked us where we were
from, we all froze. The milliseconds
crept slowly by as we each won
dered what to say. At long last I
jumped in and said, "San Francis
co!"

In Vegas, saying that you're
from San Francisco is perfectly in
nocuous. One club promoter re
sponded with, "Oh, I used to live in
the Bay!," to which we chanted,
"Yay Areaaa" (a la E-40). A polite

employee of the Sapphire Gentle
men's Club described her longing
for the scenery of Monterey. A
group of 40-year-old men from Or
ange County tried to strike up a
friendly NorCal-SoCal rivalry
even as they offered to make us
drinks in their suite. We declined
the offer.

Alas, two of my friends had a
slip-up. One fateful night, over the
craps table of our hotel, one of my
friends answered the question all
too specifically. "Where're you
from?" "Stanford." Unfortunately,
she was mockingly nicknamed
"Stanford" for the rest of the night.
"Hey, Stanford, have you been to
Vegas before?" "Hey, Stanford,
want a drink?" "Hey, Stanford . . .

The next day, I blundered as
well. My friends and I were
strolling through the Bellagio
when a club promoter accosted us.
