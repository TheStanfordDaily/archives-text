# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## I Believe I Can Fly? 
### Kristian Bailey 
Since the fall of 2001, I've been
terrified of flying not for
fear of a terrorist attack, but
because of the violently destructive
force 9/11 demonstrated planes can
have. Living in Jamaica, N. Y., a mere
10 minutes from JFK, the noise of
planes making their landing ap
proach over my house frightened
me. As I fell asleep, I'd hear the
drone of engines getting louder and
louder, and each and every time, I'd
imagine that the plane was going to
crash into my backyard.
My fear deepened on November
12, 2001, when, just 15 miles from
my house, American Airlines Flight
587 crashed into a residential neigh
borhood, shortly after takeoff,
killing all 260 passengers and crew
and an additional five people on the
ground.

For months, I could not look at
the clock when it read 9:11, for fear
that it would doom me to die in a
plane accident. And, after many

sleepless nights, I worked up the
courage to tell my mother I didn't
want our family to go to San Fran
cisco the following summer. San
Francisco was the site of the 2002
National Bar Association confer
ence, which my father attended
yearly, and also the destination of
two of the four doomed 9/11 planes.

What bothered me so much
about this series of plane-related in
cidents was that so many individual
lives could be obliterated instanta
neously in a ball of fire and metal.
That, and imagining the thoughts of
the passengers onboard.
What went through the minds of

those on American Airlines Flight
11, the first plane to crash into the
World Trade Center, as they saw the
towers and realized what fate await
ed them? Did they die instantly?
Was there a metaphysical slowing
of time before the moment of im
pact?

Or what about those on AA
Flight 77 or United Flight 93, which
were crashed into the Pentagon and
a ditch in Pennsylvania, respective
ly? What did it feel like to plummet
towards the ground, knowing there
was no way out?

Air travel was and is touted as
the safest way to travel, which I
completely understand. What I
don't like about flying is knowing
that I can't escape if I need to, and
that, while 99 percent of us will get
to our destinations safely, the small
percentage who were unlucky
boarded their flights with the same

certainty that we do.
Even though there have been no
major plane crashes in the U.S.
since Flight 587, I've kept my fear
alive by reading about gruesome
disasters from years past. I'll leave
you to choose whether to look
these up on your own, but TWA
Flight 800, Egypt Air Flight 990
(both of which also took off from
JFK) and American Airlines Flight
11 bother me the most.

I'm not sure why I feed this fear.
(To make myself painfully aware of
my own constantly looming mortal
ity?) Nor am I sure why I, living in
New York City, chose to go to Stan
ford when I could've easily gone to
a school that didn't require flying.
Yet and get ready for a twist
flying is one of my favorite
things to do, and planes fascinate
me to no end.
In New York, whenever I had
time to kill between connecting
trains on the Long Island Rail
Road, I'd wander over to the Air-
Train station in Queens and look at
all the destinations of departing
flights. Moving to Long Island and
living directly under the landing ap
proach for European and other
westbound flights was a dream I
saw a constant stream of planes at
almost every hour of the day.
I remember seeing the Con
corde en route to JFK twice before
it was taken out of service in 2003.1
remember my first flight on a Boe

ing 111 and on a Boeing 747 (to this
day my favorite plane.)
Jetßlue and Virgin America are
my favorite domestic airlines, and I
live for the day when I can "Fly
Emirates," as their ads tell me to do,
aboard an Airbus A3BO, the double
deck, four-engine behemoths that
now grace the skies.
I think planes are sexy as is
everything else about flight: the
three-letter airport codes that are
associated with each airport: flight
attendants, who always seem so
professional and pristine; and even
particular airlines themselves.
The larger implications of
planes and flight human ingenu
ity, the interconnectivity of the 21st
century, and the sensation of almost
being able to fly are all fascinat
ing to me.
The sensation of flight the
thrill of hurtling down the runway
and always experiencing that mo
ment of hesitation over whether the
plane will lift off, and, once it does,
whether physics will realize it was
kidding and pull the plane back
down; experiencing turbulence and
thinking, "Is that all you've got?"
and then praying that the plane sta
bilizes; and the feeling of returning
back to the ground never ceases
to delight me.
So, for the foreseeable future,
my irrational obsession with flight
outweighs my rational fear of it, and
I will continue to fly.

Since the fall of 2001, I've been
terrified of flying not for
fear of a terrorist attack, but
because of the violently destructive
force 9/11 demonstrated planes can
have. Living in Jamaica, N. Y., a mere
10 minutes from JFK, the noise of
planes making their landing ap
proach over my house frightened
me. As I fell asleep, I'd hear the
drone of engines getting louder and
louder, and each and every time, I'd
imagine that the plane was going to
crash into my backyard.
My fear deepened on November
12, 2001, when, just 15 miles from
my house, American Airlines Flight
587 crashed into a residential neigh
borhood, shortly after takeoff,
killing all 260 passengers and crew
and an additional five people on the
ground.

For months, I could not look at
the clock when it read 9:11, for fear
that it would doom me to die in a
plane accident. And, after many

sleepless nights, I worked up the
courage to tell my mother I didn't
want our family to go to San Fran
cisco the following summer. San
Francisco was the site of the 2002
National Bar Association confer
ence, which my father attended
yearly, and also the destination of
two of the four doomed 9/11 planes.

What bothered me so much
about this series of plane-related in
cidents was that so many individual
lives could be obliterated instanta
neously in a ball of fire and metal.
That, and imagining the thoughts of
the passengers onboard.
What went through the minds of

those on American Airlines Flight
11, the first plane to crash into the
World Trade Center, as they saw the
towers and realized what fate await
ed them? Did they die instantly?
Was there a metaphysical slowing
of time before the moment of im
pact?

Or what about those on AA
Flight 77 or United Flight 93, which
were crashed into the Pentagon and
a ditch in Pennsylvania, respective
ly? What did it feel like to plummet
towards the ground, knowing there
was no way out?

Air travel was and is touted as
the safest way to travel, which I
completely understand. What I
don't like about flying is knowing
that I can't escape if I need to, and
that, while 99 percent of us will get
to our destinations safely, the small
percentage who were unlucky
boarded their flights with the same

certainty that we do.
Even though there have been no
major plane crashes in the U.S.
since Flight 587, I've kept my fear
alive by reading about gruesome
disasters from years past. I'll leave
you to choose whether to look
these up on your own, but TWA
Flight 800, Egypt Air Flight 990
(both of which also took off from
JFK) and American Airlines Flight
11 bother me the most.

I'm not sure why I feed this fear.
(To make myself painfully aware of
my own constantly looming mortal
ity?) Nor am I sure why I, living in
New York City, chose to go to Stan
ford when I could've easily gone to
a school that didn't require flying.
Yet and get ready for a twist
flying is one of my favorite
things to do, and planes fascinate
me to no end.
In New York, whenever I had
time to kill between connecting
trains on the Long Island Rail
Road, I'd wander over to the Air-
Train station in Queens and look at
all the destinations of departing
flights. Moving to Long Island and
living directly under the landing ap
proach for European and other
westbound flights was a dream I
saw a constant stream of planes at
almost every hour of the day.
I remember seeing the Con
corde en route to JFK twice before
it was taken out of service in 2003.1
remember my first flight on a Boe

ing 111 and on a Boeing 747 (to this
day my favorite plane.)

live for the day when I can "Fly
