# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## I Believe I Can Fly? 
### Kristian Bailey 
Since the fall of 2001, I've been
terrified of flying not for
fear of a terrorist attack, but
because of the violently destructive
force 9/11 demonstrated planes can
have. Living in Jamaica, N. Y., a mere
10 minutes from JFK, the noise of
planes making their landing ap
proach over my house frightened
me. As I fell asleep, I'd hear the
drone of engines getting louder and
louder, and each and every time, I'd
imagine that the plane was going to
crash into my backyard.
My fear deepened on November
12, 2001, when, just 15 miles from
my house, American Airlines Flight
587 crashed into a residential neigh
borhood, shortly after takeoff,
killing all 260 passengers and crew
and an additional five people on the
ground.

For months, I could not look at
the clock when it read 9:11, for fear
that it would doom me to die in a
plane accident. And, after many

sleepless nights, I worked up the
courage to tell my mother I didn't
want our family to go to San Fran
cisco the following summer. San
Francisco was the site of the 2002
National Bar Association confer
ence, which my father attended
yearly, and also the destination of
two of the four doomed 9/11 planes.

What bothered me so much
about this series of plane-related in
cidents was that so many individual
lives could be obliterated instanta
neously in a ball of fire and metal.
That, and imagining the thoughts of
the passengers onboard.
What went through the minds of

those on American Airlines Flight
11, the first plane to crash into the
World Trade Center, as they saw the
towers and realized what fate await
ed them? Did they die instantly?
Was there a metaphysical slowing
of time before the moment of im
pact?

Or what about those on AA
Flight 77 or United Flight 93, which
were crashed into the Pentagon and
a ditch in Pennsylvania, respective
ly? What did it feel like to plummet
towards the ground, knowing there
was no way out?

Air travel was and is touted as
the safest way to travel, which I
completely understand. What I
don't like about flying is knowing
that I can't escape if I need to, and
that, while 99 percent of us will get
to our destinations safely, the small
percentage who were unlucky
boarded their flights with the same
