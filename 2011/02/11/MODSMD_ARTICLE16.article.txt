The Stanford women's tennis team
took full advantage of a beautiful day
to come out firing, racing to a 7-0 victo
ry over a competitive SMU team.
With sophomore Mallory Burdette
in the lineup for the second straight
game, the No. 1 Cardinal (5-0) had its
full squad on display again. After prov
ing she had no rust in her 6-0,6-1 victo
ry over then-No. 36 Courtney Dole
hide of UCLA last Saturday, Burdette
was back to contribute to a very one
sided doubles victory. She and senior
Hilary Barte both defeated their op
ponents, 8-2.

"It's really good to be back," Bur
dette said. "Especially in that first
match against UCLA, I was a little
nervous. It turned out really well, but
today was a little bit of a struggle. Still,
I think it was good prep for Indoors
next week."

On Court Three, Stanford's ever
consistent squad of junior Veronica Li
and senior Carolyn McVeigh part
nered brilliantly to run away with an 8-
2 score and clinch the doubles point.
On Court Two, the freshmen tandem
of Kristie Ahn and Nicole Gibbs won
with an identical 8-2 score.

Singles proved to be a much
tougher test. Led by Marta Lesniak in
the top spot, the Mustangs (5-2)
proved to have fight in them through
out their lineup. Barte was able to pull
an upset over the Lezniak ranked
2nd in the nation with an impres
sive tiebreak performance in the 2nd
set, overpowering her to earn a 6-4,7-
6 (2) victory.
At the No. 2 position, Gibbs strug
gled early with her opponent. Frustrat
ed with her play in the first set, she was
able to turn it around early in the sec
ond set, returning to her dominant
style of play and eventually closing out
her opponent, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. After suf
fering a few close losses in the fall, a
come-from-behind win at the colle
giate level like this is a big mental
boost for Gibbs.

"The girl I played came out hitting
winners all over the place, and I was
surprised at first," Gibbs said. "It
caught me off guard because it didn't
look like she was going to have a game
that was that aggressive to that degree

when we were playing her in doubles.
"I came in with some assumptions
that ended up hurting me in the first
set," she said. "It took me a while to get
caught up to how she was hitting the
ball, but once I did, I feel like I made
the proper adjustments."
The only two players who appeared
to have an easier time with their oppo
nents were Ahn at the No. 3 spot and
McVeigh at the No. 5 spot. Ahn won, 6-
2, 6-2, with an excellent running fore

hand, while McVeigh was able to keep
up her strong momentum this year and
come away with a 6-3,6-1 win.
Sophomore Stacey Tan also closed
her match out in a tiebreaker, coming
back from multiple set points in the
breaker to eventually win, 6-4,7-6(7).
Finally, Burdette was last off the court
after fighting through her own strug
gles and her opponent's varying pace
