# Tough MPSF test ahead
## Card to host UC-San Diego, UC-Irvine 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After a weekend sweep through the
Chicago area, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team is back on the Farm in a re
turn to Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation play tonight against No. 12 UC
San Diego. The No. 4 Cardinal will face
off against No. 8 UC Irvine Saturday.
Playing ranked opponents is noth
ing new in the ultra-competitive MPSF,
in which 11 of the top 15 teams in the
most recent AVCA Div. I poll play. The
weekend sojourn in the Midwest saw
Stanford (8-2, 5-2 MPSF) square off
against Div. II Lewis and Div. 11l Loy
ola, but head coach John Kosty said the
experience and lessons learned were as
important as any game,
"I think we just had a great week
end all around," Kosty said. "Chicago's
a great town to play in, and it was good
for us to be in an environment that
most of the team is not used to, coming
from the warmer climates of Southern
California and Hawaii. But on the
whole, I think we handled ourselves
with great character.
"Most importantly, perhaps, we
played in two gyms that are known for
being hard on visiting opponents with
really loud, boisterous student sec
tions," Kosty said. "They were both
hostile environments, and I am really
proud of the fact that our guys handled
it all really well."
Even with the support of a home
crowd at Maples Pavilion, UC San
Diego (5-7, 2-4) will certainly be a
tough opponent, boasting a number of
experienced players with gaudy num
bers. Senior setter Phil Bannan set the
Tritons' career record for career assists

with his 3,893 rd in a loss to Pepperdine
last week. He has plenty of help from
outside hitter Carl Eberts and middle
blocker Calvin Ross.
Eberts is a redshirt sophomore
from Huntington Beach, Calif., and
leads San Diego with 119 kills on the
year. Ross, a 6-foot-9 senior, is having a

breakout season with 88 kills, a team
high 43 blocks and an impressive .462
hitting percentage.
"San Diego is another good, solid
team that digs a lot of balls and is
going to keep coming at you," Kosty

said. "In a rally-score game to 25,
that's a pretty good combination to
win."

Stanford will look again to sev
eral newcomers that have been
playing well lately. Freshmen out
side hitters Eric Mochalski and
Brian Cook have both been in the
starting lineup for the Cardinal with
fellow freshman outside hitter
Steven Irvin getting plenty of play
ing time as well.
"The freshmen have just been
great," Kosty said. "They have an in
tensity and knowledge and desire to
continually get better every day. It's
a reflection on their character and
also shows how well the upperclass
men are leading the way."
In the two wins over Lewis and
Loyola, Mochalski had 14 kills on
just 17 swings, while Cook added 15

kills and Irvin chipped in eight.
Playing every weekend under
stressful conditions has not been an
easy adjustment for the any of the
rookies, particularly because of the
physical demand on the players'
bodies.

"It's definitely been exciting for
us, but it's also been pretty hard for a
lot of reasons," Mochalski said.
"Cook, Irvin and I aren't really used
to this type of demand, but the
coaches, training staff are all looking
out for us."

Another weekend with Friday-
Saturday matches will test the
team's mettle as the season nears the
heart of conference play.
"The team that wins the MPSF is
going to be a team that is consistent,
night in and night out, and we are
continuing to work on that," Kosty
said.
"In men's volleyball, you don't
win national championships in Janu
ary or February," he said. "It's the
team that improves the most on the
season that will be able to go into the

NCAA tournament and win five in a
row."

UC Irvine (5-7,2-4) brings two of
the top outside hitters in the country
in Cory Yoder and Carson Clark.
The pair have combined for 356 kills
on the season, and Yoder's .460 hit
ting percentage is one of the best
marks in the country, particularly for
an outside hitter.
That leaves out two-time Ail-
American senior Jordan DeFault,
who has struggled a bit this year with
injuries, but certainly has the poten
tial to have a big match.
Currently fourth in the MPSF
conference standings, Stanford can't
afford to get caught looking ahead
to next weekend's showdown at No.
IUSC.

The match against UC San Diego
is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight at
Maples Pavilion, with the Saturday
match against UC Irvine slated for
the same time.

turn to Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation play tonight against No. 12 UC
San Diego. The No. 4 Cardinal will face
off against No. 8 UC Irvine Saturday.
Playing ranked opponents is noth
ing new in the ultra-competitive MPSF,
in which 11 of the top 15 teams in the
most recent AVCA Div. I poll play. The
weekend sojourn in the Midwest saw
Stanford (8-2, 5-2 MPSF) square off
against Div. II Lewis and Div. 11l Loy
ola, but head coach John Kosty said the
experience and lessons learned were as
important as any game,
"I think we just had a great week
end all around," Kosty said. "Chicago's
a great town to play in, and it was good
for us to be in an environment that
most of the team is not used to, coming
from the warmer climates of Southern
California and Hawaii. But on the
whole, I think we handled ourselves
with great character.
"Most importantly, perhaps, we
played in two gyms that are known for
being hard on visiting opponents with
really loud, boisterous student sec
tions," Kosty said. "They were both
hostile environments, and I am really
proud of the fact that our guys handled
it all really well."
Even with the support of a home
crowd at Maples Pavilion, UC San
Diego (5-7, 2-4) will certainly be a
tough opponent, boasting a number of
experienced players with gaudy num
bers. Senior setter Phil Bannan set the
Tritons' career record for career assists

with his 3,893 rd in a loss to Pepperdine
last week. He has plenty of help from
outside hitter Carl Eberts and middle
blocker Calvin Ross.
Eberts is a redshirt sophomore
from Huntington Beach, Calif., and
leads San Diego with 119 kills on the
year. Ross, a 6-foot-9 senior, is having a

breakout season with 88 kills, a team
high 43 blocks and an impressive .462
hitting percentage.
"San Diego is another good, solid
team that digs a lot of balls and is
going to keep coming at you," Kosty

said. "In a rally-score game to 25,
that's a pretty good combination to
win."

Stanford will look again to sev
eral newcomers that have been
playing well lately. Freshmen out
side hitters Eric Mochalski and
Brian Cook have both been in the
starting lineup for the Cardinal with
fellow freshman outside hitter
Steven Irvin getting plenty of play
ing time as well.
"The freshmen have just been
great," Kosty said. "They have an in
tensity and knowledge and desire to
continually get better every day. It's
a reflection on their character and
also shows how well the upperclass
men are leading the way."
In the two wins over Lewis and
Loyola, Mochalski had 14 kills on
just 17 swings, while Cook added 15

kills and Irvin chipped in eight.
Playing every weekend under
stressful conditions has not been an
easy adjustment for the any of the
rookies, particularly because of the
physical demand on the players'
bodies.

"It's definitely been exciting for
us, but it's also been pretty hard for a
lot of reasons," Mochalski said.
"Cook, Irvin and I aren't really used
to this type of demand, but the
coaches, training staff are all looking
out for us."

Another weekend with Friday-
Saturday matches will test the
team's mettle as the season nears the
heart of conference play.
"The team that wins the MPSF is
going to be a team that is consistent,
night in and night out, and we are
continuing to work on that," Kosty
said.
"In men's volleyball, you don't
win national championships in Janu
ary or February," he said. "It's the
team that improves the most on the
season that will be able to go into the

NCAA tournament and win five in a
row."

UC Irvine (5-7,2-4) brings two of
the top outside hitters in the country
in Cory Yoder and Carson Clark.
The pair have combined for 356 kills
on the season, and Yoder's .460 hit
ting percentage is one of the best
marks in the country, particularly for
an outside hitter.
That leaves out two-time Ail-
American senior Jordan DeFault,
who has struggled a bit this year with
injuries, but certainly has the poten
tial to have a big match.
Currently fourth in the MPSF
conference standings, Stanford can't
afford to get caught looking ahead
to next weekend's showdown at No.
IUSC.

The match against UC San Diego
is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight at
Maples Pavilion, with the Saturday
match against UC Irvine slated for
the same time.
