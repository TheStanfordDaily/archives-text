# Tough MPSF test ahead
## Card to host UC-San Diego, UC-Irvine 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After a weekend sweep through the
Chicago area, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team is back on the Farm in a re
turn to Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation play tonight against No. 12 UC
San Diego. The No. 4 Cardinal will face
off against No. 8 UC Irvine Saturday.
Playing ranked opponents is noth
ing new in the ultra-competitive MPSF,
in which 11 of the top 15 teams in the
most recent AVCA Div. I poll play. The
weekend sojourn in the Midwest saw
Stanford (8-2, 5-2 MPSF) square off
against Div. II Lewis and Div. 11l Loy
ola, but head coach John Kosty said the
experience and lessons learned were as
important as any game,
"I think we just had a great week
end all around," Kosty said. "Chicago's
a great town to play in, and it was good
for us to be in an environment that
most of the team is not used to, coming
from the warmer climates of Southern
California and Hawaii. But on the
whole, I think we handled ourselves
with great character.
"Most importantly, perhaps, we
played in two gyms that are known for
being hard on visiting opponents with
really loud, boisterous student sec
tions," Kosty said. "They were both
hostile environments, and I am really
proud of the fact that our guys handled
it all really well."
Even with the support of a home
crowd at Maples Pavilion, UC San
Diego (5-7, 2-4) will certainly be a
tough opponent, boasting a number of
experienced players with gaudy num
bers. Senior setter Phil Bannan set the
Tritons' career record for career assists

with his 3,893 rd in a loss to Pepperdine
last week. He has plenty of help from
outside hitter Carl Eberts and middle
blocker Calvin Ross.
Eberts is a redshirt sophomore
from Huntington Beach, Calif., and
leads San Diego with 119 kills on the
year. Ross, a 6-foot-9 senior, is having a

breakout season with 88 kills, a team
high 43 blocks and an impressive .462
hitting percentage.
"San Diego is another good, solid
team that digs a lot of balls and is
going to keep coming at you," Kosty
