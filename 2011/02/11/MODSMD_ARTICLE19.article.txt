# How do you define perfection?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
The Cardinal women's
basketball team has
n't dropped a game in
either the Pac-10
conference or its end
of-season tournament since Jan
uary 2009 (a narrow loss at
Berkeley). In comparison, none
of the Pac-10 men's basketball
teams has managed to come
close to a perfect record over the
same time period. Does this
mean: a) the Stanford women's
team is freakishly good; or b) the
standard of play in the women's
conference is worse (and thus
one team can more easily domi
nate)?
The honest answer to that
question is probably halfway be
tween the two: the Card is clear
ly a very talented team, but the
other teams in the conference
are not able to perform consis
tently at an equal level. Lack of
enough week-to-week competi
tion may even have hurt Stan
ford's aspirations in March and
April, when it has perhaps not
been fully prepared for the brick
wall of UConn for two years
running, despite the upset last
December. Maybe a few losses
earlier in the season would have
made some difference.
Now consider football. Ore
gon finished this year with a per
fect record and its second con
secutive Pac-10 championship.
In that time, the only team to ac
tually knock off the Ducks in
conference play was last year's
Cardinal. Looking further
afield, before the season-ending
bowl games, three of this year's
teams had perfect records, and
in the year before, five teams
could claim that honor. So, is col

lege football competitive? Were
those perfect teams truly spe
cial, or did they just play weak
opponents?
I wouldn't be the first person
to question the legitimacy of the
BCS Bowl system to wonder
how to decide which unblem
ished team should get to play for
a national championship but
it's not just the perfect teams
that could benefit from a fair

playoff system. In this year's
NFL regular season, not a single
team can claim to have won
every game they played. The
New England Patriots came
closest with 14 wins and two
losses, and the last time anyone
achieved such perfection, it was
the Patriots again, back in 2007.
The Green Bay Packers, Super
Bowl XLV champions, were tied
for eighth in their regular season
results at 10-6. Any college team
with the same results as this
year's best professional teams
would not even have figured in
the running for the big prize.
It does seem strange that we
demand so much more from col
lege students. The pros do play a
few more games in the regular
season, 16 compared to about

Finishing a season
unbeaten should
be no mean feat.
