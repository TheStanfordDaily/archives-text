# How do you define perfection?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
The Cardinal women's
basketball team has
n't dropped a game in
either the Pac-10
conference or its end
of-season tournament since Jan
uary 2009 (a narrow loss at
Berkeley). In comparison, none
of the Pac-10 men's basketball
teams has managed to come
close to a perfect record over the
same time period. Does this
mean: a) the Stanford women's
team is freakishly good; or b) the
standard of play in the women's
conference is worse (and thus
one team can more easily domi
nate)?
The honest answer to that
question is probably halfway be
tween the two: the Card is clear
ly a very talented team, but the
other teams in the conference
are not able to perform consis
tently at an equal level. Lack of
enough week-to-week competi
tion may even have hurt Stan
ford's aspirations in March and
April, when it has perhaps not
been fully prepared for the brick
wall of UConn for two years
running, despite the upset last
December. Maybe a few losses
earlier in the season would have
made some difference.
Now consider football. Ore
gon finished this year with a per
fect record and its second con
secutive Pac-10 championship.
In that time, the only team to ac
tually knock off the Ducks in
conference play was last year's
Cardinal. Looking further
afield, before the season-ending
bowl games, three of this year's
teams had perfect records, and
in the year before, five teams
could claim that honor. So, is col

lege football competitive? Were
those perfect teams truly spe
cial, or did they just play weak
opponents?
I wouldn't be the first person
to question the legitimacy of the
BCS Bowl system to wonder
how to decide which unblem
ished team should get to play for
a national championship but
it's not just the perfect teams
that could benefit from a fair

playoff system. In this year's
NFL regular season, not a single
team can claim to have won
every game they played. The
New England Patriots came
closest with 14 wins and two
losses, and the last time anyone
achieved such perfection, it was
the Patriots again, back in 2007.
The Green Bay Packers, Super
Bowl XLV champions, were tied
for eighth in their regular season
results at 10-6. Any college team
with the same results as this
year's best professional teams
would not even have figured in
the running for the big prize.
It does seem strange that we
demand so much more from col
lege students. The pros do play a
few more games in the regular
season, 16 compared to about

be no mean feat.
13, but that's their job.They are paid
a lot of money not to lose. They
don't have to worry about taking
classes they can just train and
play.
Finishing a season unbeaten
should be no mean feat. Arsenal
achieved this in 2004-05 to become
only the second ever 'lnvincible'
team in the top-flight of English
soccer. The other was Preston
North End in 1888-89. The best
thing that a playoff system might do
would be to make the perfect sea
son rare again. At most, just one Di
vision I school would be able to
achieve this each year (the national
champions), but even that wouldn't
be assured. There would be power
ful one- and two-loss teams around
the league that would certainly not
be pushovers, and tricky unexpect
ed challenges from all the confer
ences. There might even be the
chance for a rematch, and some se
rious payback, from a defeat earlier
in the season. The few teams that
did achieve this would etch their
names not just in school history, but
also in national lore.

What the University of Con
necticut women's basketball team
achieved over the last few years was
almost unbelievable. It remained
unbeaten for over two entire sea
sons, recording back-to-back na
tional championships with a 90-
game winning streak that took it
past the high water mark for any
winning streaks in the sport, set by
John Wooden's legendary UCLA
men's team in the 19705. By looking
just at recent regular season
records, there would seem to be lit
tle in common between UConn and
Stanford, the team whose wins
bookend that incredible streak. But
that comparison would do neither
justice. The Cardinal was clearly a
great team over that stretchout the
Huskies were a phenomenon, set
ting records that may never be beat
en. The fact that it was only UConn
that kept Stanford from writing its
own little piece of history in this era,
and that the Huskies still have only
lost to one team in three years, says
a lot about both.
Playoffs aren't just needed to
make the BCS system fair, but to
separate the good teams from the
truly legendary.
