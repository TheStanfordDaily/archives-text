Stanford hopes to develop a study
abroad program in the Middle East with
in the next few years, said Robert Sin
clair, Robert Burke Family director of
the Bing Overseas Study Program. The
Bing Program plans to first implement a
three-week summer seminar in the re
gion, hopefully in summer 2012, and es
tablish a center and a more extensive
program at a future time.
Currently, budget constraints are the
main obstacles for the program. Al
though the host country has not yet been
decided, the Bing Program has applied
for funding from the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE) and
expects to hear about the results in a few
months, Sinclair said.

"It is my strong hope that this [pro
gram] will come about," Sinclair said.
"We prefer sooner rather than later, but
that will depend on the budget situa
tion."

Sinclair also noted that student inter
est in the program is high, stating that he
has received several inquiries about the
program's development from student or
ganizations since the beginning of the
year.

"This is obviously a very hot topic
right now," he said.
Lisa Blaydes, an assistant professor of
political science who has done significant
research on politics in the Middle East,
mirrored this sentiment. She stressed the
importance of knowing about issues in
the region firsthand.
"A presence in the Arab world is im
portant for Stanford, especially consider
ing the many students studying Arabic,"
she said.

Blaydes said students are curious
about the history, politics and culture of
the region. She recognized that some
Stanford students find ways to pursue
abroad programs or research in the Mid
dle East independent of Stanford, usual
ly by partnering with other American
universities. But the addition of a Stan
ford-specific program would be benefi
cial, she said.
The recent uprising against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and the ensu
ing violence and tension has affected uni
versities' engagement in the region.
Many universities have taken students
out of their programs and home-stays in
the country.
Sinclair admitted that Egypt is no
longer a real candidate for the site of a
Stanford center.

According to Omar Shakir, B.A. 'O7,
J.D. 'l3, the conflict demonstrates the im
portance of a Stanford presence in the
Middle East in the first place. As an un
dergraduate, Shakir studied abroad and
did research for his senior honors thesis
in Egypt through a non-Stanford pro
gram. While he was able to coordinate his
trip relatively easily, he acknowledged
the importance of making such an expe
rience more accessible to students.

"It's an amazing place to be," he said.
"I like the history there ... there's so
much to learn."
Shakir's interest seems to reflect a
growing, nationwide interest in abroad

programs located in the Middle
East. The number of students from
American universities studying
abroad in Arabic countries in
creased 127 percent from 2002 to
2006, according to the online news
publication Inside Higher Ed.
Last Friday, Shakir coordinated
a demonstration in White Plaza
that showed support for the protes
tors in Egypt opposing Mubarak.

He stressed that despite the
regime's use of force, the move
ment is truly a popular, grassroots
endeavor.
Shakir remarked that political
conflict in Egypt hasn't decreased
student interest in learning in the
country, nor in the Middle East in
general. Many other major univer
sities, including Harvard, Prince
ton, Cornell and Northwestern,
have already established study
abroad opportunities in the re
gion.
