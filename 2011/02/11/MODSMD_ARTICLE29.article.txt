If midterms are throwing you off the prowl, don't worry. Green Library is a hotspot, especially halfway through the
quarter. Brush up on your chemistry skills and offer some help to the girl staring angrily at her problem set.

Coupa Cafe

2

Not a morning person? Neither are 99 percent of college
students. Stop by before your 9 a.m. class, and you
might find someone tired enough to say yes to your
spontaneous dinner offer.

Arrillaga Gym

3

Spring break is coming up, and that means it's
time to hit the treadmill. Fortunately, it's
packed with students trying to lose the
Freshman 15. Check out the ellipticals for one
to chat up.

The Circle
of Death

4

There have been quite a few accidents in the Circle of Death
lately, but that doesn't mean anyone is avoiding it. Try nudg
ing a cutie with your bike one morning and apologetically
ask if you can make it up to them with a date. 4

Always a classic choice, frat parties are filled with
random Stanford students looking for a fun
time. Now, grab one and get on the dance floor.
Don't forget your cheesy pick-up line.
