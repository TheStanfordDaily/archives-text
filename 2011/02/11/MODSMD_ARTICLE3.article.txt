floor, with 16 and 12 points, respec
tively. Junior guard Jarrett Mann or
chestrated the offense with confi
dence, tallying a career-high 11 as
sists. Powell also won the battle on
the boards with eight rebounds.
After a Powell fastbreak layup
gave Stanford a 2-0 lead just 49 sec
onds into the game, the Card (13-10,
6-6 Pac-10) would never trail. The
first half saw complete Cardinal
dominance, with Stanford leading
by as much as 18 with 4:27 left in the
half.

Stanford's bench had 12 points
in the first half to Washington
State's zero, with key contributions
from junior big-man Jack Trotter as
well as freshman guard Aaron
Bright and his classmates at for
ward, Josh Heustis and John Gage.
Stanford went into the break with a
convincing 45-28 lead.
The home team wouldn't go
down without a fight, however. Led
by junior forward DeAngelo Casto,
who shot 6-for-7 on the half, the
Cougars (16-8, 6-6) showed flashes
of brilliance, rallying in the second
period to trail just 56-55 with 8:38
remaining.

But despite outscoring Stanford,
34-30, and outshooting it 46.4 to
33.3 percent on the half, Stanford
was able to pull out the road victory
in the game's remaining minutes.
Powell displayed strong skills on
both sides of the ball, blocking, re
bounding and scoring, while both
Green and Mann were both consis

tent from the free throw line.
And it didn't hurt that Stanford
was red-hot from three-point land,
shooting a phenomenal 87.5 per
cent from behind the arc in the first
half alone, and a still-impressive
56.3 percent from three on the
game. That performance was in
sharp contrast to the Cougars' 16.7-
percent shooting from range. The
Cardinal, which has struggled from
the line at various points this sea
son, also shot a strong 16-for-19
(84.2 percent) from the charity
stripe. Defensively, the teams were
more evenly matched, with Stan
ford narrowly out-rebounding
Washington State, 31-28, but match
ing it on steals and blocks (five and
two, respectively).
Casto led Washington State with
22 points on 10-for-ll shooting,
while his classmate, forward Klay
Thompson, had seven rebounds and
15 points, well below his season av
erage of 21.2 points per game. Ju
nior guard Faisal Aden, who had 20
points in the Card's Jan. 18 loss to
the Cougars, was held to just three
points in last night's matchup.
On Saturday, Stanford will travel
to Seattle looking to sweep the sea
son series against a conference
leading Washington squad. Tip-off
against the Huskies is scheduled for
5:30 p.m. in Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion.

well as freshman guard Aaron
Bright and his classmates at for
ward, Josh Heustis and John Gage.
Stanford went into the break with a
convincing 45-28 lead.
The home team wouldn't go
down without a fight, however. Led
by junior forward DeAngelo Casto,
who shot 6-for-7 on the half, the
Cougars (16-8, 6-6) showed flashes
of brilliance, rallying in the second
period to trail just 56-55 with 8:38
remaining.

But despite outscoring Stanford,
34-30, and outshooting it 46.4 to
33.3 percent on the half, Stanford
was able to pull out the road victory
in the game's remaining minutes.
Powell displayed strong skills on
both sides of the ball, blocking, re
bounding and scoring, while both
Green and Mann were both consis

tent from the free throw line.
And it didn't hurt that Stanford
was red-hot from three-point land,
shooting a phenomenal 87.5 per
cent from behind the arc in the first
half alone, and a still-impressive
56.3 percent from three on the
game. That performance was in
sharp contrast to the Cougars' 16.7-
percent shooting from range. The
Cardinal, which has struggled from
the line at various points this sea
son, also shot a strong 16-for-19
(84.2 percent) from the charity
stripe. Defensively, the teams were
more evenly matched, with Stan
ford narrowly out-rebounding
Washington State, 31-28, but match
ing it on steals and blocks (five and
two, respectively).
Casto led Washington State with
22 points on 10-for-ll shooting,
while his classmate, forward Klay
Thompson, had seven rebounds and
15 points, well below his season av
erage of 21.2 points per game. Ju
nior guard Faisal Aden, who had 20
points in the Card's Jan. 18 loss to
the Cougars, was held to just three
points in last night's matchup.
On Saturday, Stanford will travel
to Seattle looking to sweep the sea
son series against a conference
leading Washington squad. Tip-off
against the Huskies is scheduled for
5:30 p.m. in Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion.
