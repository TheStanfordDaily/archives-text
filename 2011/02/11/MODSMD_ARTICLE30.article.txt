A mere five months after the launch of
their debut album, Finding Jupiter
returns with a big bang. Their 15-
track remix album, "East of Orion," does

"astro-not" disappoint.
No more Jetsons-esque puns, I promise.
Just had to get them out of my (solar) sys
tem.

Finding Jupiter, a Stanford punk rock
band, employed the talents of East Coast DJs
Maximalism and Danoteck to remix the
band's debut album, "Racing Against the
Sun." Guitarist and vocalist Sarah Masimore
'll describes the new tunes as "avant garde .
.. push[ing] some artistic boundaries by
taking rock to a place it rarely goes."
Indeed, their recent release is 56 min-

utes of experiments in sound. Each track

floats across several genres, with dubstep
meeting punk rock and acoustic guitar min
gling with 80s-esque synthesizers. The result
is a strong remix album that rivals the origi
nal, a rare dynamic.
The album starts strong with "Raze the
City (Seriously Mix)," an excellent blend of
fast-paced drums and spacey guitar effects.
Masimore's vocals are absolutely heavenly
when given a touch of reverb, a trend that
continues throughout the next 14 tracks.

Given the current dominance of dub
step, it's no surprise to find "Swing (Dubby
Mix)" on this album. While not as dirty as
the beats heard at many an EBF Happy
Hour, this dubstep remix is a success.

Finding Jupiter's punk rock vibe is surpris
ingly compatible with the super-slow reggae
sound of this track.

Another stellar track is "Seamless (No
Seams Mix)," a sexy, slow tune that puts

Thievery Corporation to shame. Spacey
synths, sultry vocals and a smooth and steady
drumbeat make this song a highlight of the
listening experience. Granted, I've never left
the Earth's atmosphere, but I imagine it feels
something like the sound of this song.

This album is awesome. It's reminiscent
of an hour-long party at a co-op on Jupiter,

with a few groovy aliens spinning tracks.
Maximalism and Danoteck successfully cap
ture the extraterrestrial aesthetic while man
aging to retain the most compelling ele
ments of the original tracks. It's not often
that a DJ can honor the assets of remixed
tunes, but the glory of Finding Jupiter's
funky punk rock shines through. If you're a
fan of punk rock, techno and outer space,
then "East of Orion" is for you.
