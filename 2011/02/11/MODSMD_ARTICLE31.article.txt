Love songs and lingerie are
undoubtedly two very crucial
aspects of Valentine's Day.
This may not be the case for
everyone, but music and underwear
are dynamic duo for Stanford's Mixed
Company's annual Valentine's Day
show, "Love Sucks," which takes place
this Friday evening, Feb. 11 at 7:30
p.m. in Toyon Lounge.
"Love Sucks" is Mixed Company's
biggest and raunchiest show of the
year and arrives just in time for
Valentine's Day. The show has been a

major part of the group's repertoire in
the 25 years since its founding.

In case the name "Love Sucks"
didn't hint at its anti-Valentine's theme
strongly enough, the catchphrase of
the show is "No dates allowed!" which
foreshadows the edginess and promis
cuity of event.

"We are the oldest co-ed and

arguably most attractive group on
campus. And we are aberrantly willing
to prove it by stripping on stage," said

The fun and risque theme is paired with
great music by the 17-person a capella group.
Mixed Company will be performing songs
including "I'll Be" by Edwin McCain,
"Everything" by Fefe Dobson, "The Chain" by
Ingrid Michaelson and numerous new num
bers.

Asperger is very pleased with the energy
that the new members of Mixed Company
have brought to the group and to "Love Sucks."
"It is going to make the show very differ

ent but a lot fun," she said.
"As a new member, I am excited to be part
of this tradition," said Cole Stites-Clayton 'l4.
"I am excited because all of our friends
can come see a big show with all types of
music," said Derrick Contreras 'l4.
Members will don appropriately scan
dalous attire ranging from boxers to corsets to
bathrobes.

"There may or may not be a onesie at the
show," Asperger said.
In between songs, the group will perform

love-themed skits, including a possible skit
based off the popular website "likealittle.com"
and another poking fun at Stanford's other a
cappella groups.
"It's all out of love," Asperger explained.
"We make fun of ourselves as well."
Stanford's Student Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC) will make a quick presenta
tion at the show to keep
with the sexual spirit of the
performance. Expect free
condoms to be distributed.

The show's fun reputation, the spirit of
the Mixed Company members and the overall
sexy vibe that accompanies the event's theme
indicate that although love may suck, the show
will not.
