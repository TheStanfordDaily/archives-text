Love songs and lingerie are
undoubtedly two very crucial
aspects of Valentine's Day.
This may not be the case for
everyone, but music and underwear
are dynamic duo for Stanford's Mixed
Company's annual Valentine's Day
show, "Love Sucks," which takes place
this Friday evening, Feb. 11 at 7:30
p.m. in Toyon Lounge.
"Love Sucks" is Mixed Company's
biggest and raunchiest show of the
year and arrives just in time for
Valentine's Day. The show has been a

major part of the group's repertoire in
the 25 years since its founding.

In case the name "Love Sucks"
didn't hint at its anti-Valentine's theme
strongly enough, the catchphrase of
the show is "No dates allowed!" which
foreshadows the edginess and promis
cuity of event.

"We are the oldest co-ed and

arguably most attractive group on
campus. And we are aberrantly willing
to prove it by stripping on stage," said
