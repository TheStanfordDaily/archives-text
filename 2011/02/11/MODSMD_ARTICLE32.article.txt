In "Biutiful"
(2010),
director
Alejandro
Gonzalez
Inarritu proves

masterful once again at capturing human
drama, revisiting themes from his previous
effort, the critically acclaimed "Babel"
(2006), and eliciting a haunting perform
ance from Javier Bardem as Uxbal, an
underworld figure seeking redemption for
himself as well as the recently departed.

Set within the dark, gritty underworld of
Barcelona (the dead giveaway is a momentary
shot of Gaudi's Sagrada Famflia from afar),
"Biutiful" is in many ways a continuation of
"Babel," creating a narrative founded upon
death, (mis)communication, family and glob
alization. But whereas "Babel" was split across
the globe, with the characters only connecting
tangentially, "Biutiful" remains rooted in Spain.
Uxbal, a middleman of sorts when it comes to
counterfeit goods and exploiting immigrant

labor, must deal with illegal aliens from Senegal
and China, all of whom are driven by greed.

Money is what holds their tenuous lives togeth
er, and yet all the while threatens to destroy
them.
Bardem, sporting a coif only marginally
better than the one he wore in the Coen
brothers' "No Country for Old Men" (2007),
captivates as a dying man trying to settle his
scores before leaving this life for the next. We
watch as Uxbal struggles to hold his family
together, making ends meet, while trying
hard not to completely rip off his foreign
clients, for whom he maintains a great ten
derness despite his constant demands and
threats. In addition to his duties of father-

hood, collecting payouts and bribing local
police, Uxbal also acts as a speaker for the
dead: laying a cool hand on the foreheads of
the recently embalmed, absorbing their last
thoughts and speaking with their families so
that they can part on peaceful terms.
This touch of magic realism is new for
Inarritu, whose signature style was formerly
one of shocking authenticity. However, the
spirituality of "Biutiful" is never fully
explored nor explained a slight disap-

pointment because at two and a half hours,
there is ample time. As engrossing as Uxbal's
journey is, the film occasionally loses its pull,
lapsing into a melancholic cycle to which
there is no apparent end. Money is glorified
as the saving grace, but in the cruel world of
"Biutiful," there is never enough to go

around, and when there is, it usually stays in
the hands of the least deserving.
But as polemical as Barcelona may be,
Inarritu saves it from self-righteous politi
cization by complicating the lives of the
immigrants. Rather than simply portraying
them as the poor disadvantaged, he incorpo
rates real human drama into their stories. Set
against this backdrop of survival in a new
place, there is a family rocked by a father's
deportation, a patriarch dealing with the

advances of a male co-worker and a young
mother coping with unbearable work condi
tions. In the end, it is a tale of human
endurance and not of racism, corruption or
any other concern that rears its head during
the course of the film.

Again collaborating with cinematogra
pher Rodrigo Prieto, "Biutiful" is both vibrant
and realistic, at times achieving an almost
documentary-like feel as the camera follows
Uxbal through the narrow streets of
Barcelona and into the modest, decrepit

apartment he shares with his two young chil
dren. This raw quality is what hooks the

viewer in and may leave him wanting when
the credits roll and ambiguity remains.
Redemption only exists in dreams, it seems to
suggest, while in life the most one can hope
for is forgiveness.
