CC-V T° matter what happens, you
I I never, ever give up." In dark,
J- cold, flooded caves, this is the
most important rule of survival. Produced
by "Avatar" auteur James Cameron,

"Sanctum" is the tale of a team of dedicated

explorers trapped in a cave, racing against
the clock for their very survival. Though it

lacks originality,

this thriller
incorporates
great camera
technique and
fleeting tear-

jerking moments

in a vivid, otherworldly adventure
A sentimental thriller directed by Alister
Grierson, "Sanctum" shows us the different
facets of humanity. The movie centers on a
son discovering his cave-explorer father and
their emotional journey as they get to know
each other better on an adventure into the
world's biggest cave in Papua, New Guinea.
After the cave is flooded and the only known
exit blocked, the team has to search for

another way out by going deeper down into
the caves. Death follows everywhere they go,

and bad fortune, bad judgment and bad
morals all come into play.
Detailed actions brilliantly convey the
inner struggles of the characters and suc
cessfully arouse sympathy or detestation
from the audience with heroic or shameful
actions from the characters. Australian
actors Richard Roxburgh and Rhys
Wakesfield convincingly star as father and
son. Wakesfield shines in particular.
Unlike Cameron's most notable proj
ects, "Sanctum" is oddly lacking in any
romance. There is no aching yearning
between Jack and Rose or Jake and Neytiri,
just pure adrenaline rush. Romantics will be
sorely disappointed the only sentimental
component of the film is the father-son
bond between Frank (Roxburgh) and Josh
(Wakesfield). Nevertheless, lack of a stronger
emotional comfort is just a minor setback,
since "Sanctum" does indeed deliver a
thrilling yet moving journey into one of the
least known places on earth as well as into
the cavers' hearts.
