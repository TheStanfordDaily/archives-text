Another year, another Valentine's Day
on the Farm. Now that I'm a junior, I
have a Valentine's evening tradition
established: a glass of wine with Juan, the
guy who works at the CoHo, followed by an
uncomfortable 20 minutes of wondering

why I went to the Synergy Valentine's party
and if I look as weird naked as the average
Synergy resident does. Last year, I made the
mistake of tacking on dinner at a fancy
restaurant with a bunch of girls; the place
was filled with couples, and the waitress (see
ing a table of kindred souls) explained as she
poured us another round of Arnold Palmers
that Valentine's Day hadn't seemed the same
since her boyfriend of six years dumped her
on her 27th birthday. But that doesn't have
to be you! This year, start your own
Valentine's tradition. Go to one of the many
quirky, super fun restaurants near campus,
places so un-romantic that the odds of see
ing people making out over a plate of pan
seared foie gras are about 1 in 8000. A few
good bets:

Chuck E. Cheese: Yes, really. Nothing says
"single and ready to mingle" like going to
Chuck E. Cheese on Valentine's Day with a
group of your closest friends. Skee-ball,
arcade games and screaming toddlers? It's
enough to make you forget that it's February

14.1 can't vouch for the quality of the pizza,
but the official Chuck E. Cheese's website
does have a sub-section labeled "Product
Recalls," so at least they care about food safe
ty. But be warned due to liability issues,
adult males cannot enter a Chuck E. Cheese's
alone, so be sure to go with friends! Located
at 2541 El Camino Real in Redwood City,
open until 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday
and 11 p.m. on the weekends.

Asia SF: If you're willing to go further afield
for Valentine's dinner, this is the coolest place
in San Francisco. Asia SF is an Asian fusion
restaurant with really solid food (I love the
banana beignets) and a great cocktail menu.
But more than that, Asia SF is a once in a
lifetime experience during dinner, scantily
dressed models on a central runway perform
a sassy burlesque show complete with lots of
awkward diner participation. The twist? The
girls in the show are all "gender illusionists,"
a particularly artful term the restaurant uses
for transvestite although you'd never

know unless someone told you beforehand.
It all makes for a provocative, wildly enter
taining night. Note: this is not a recommend
ed option for a first date with Bill O'Reilly.
Located at 201 9th Street in San Francisco,
open until 10 p.m. on Sundays, 11 p.m. on
Wednesday and Thursday, and 2 a.m. on the
weekends.

The Alpine Inn: Formerly known as
Rossotti's, this dive bar perched in the hills of

Portola Valley is steeped in Stanford lore
(although students don't seem to come here
as often anymore). The homey, wooden inte
rior is decked out with old Stanford memo
rabilia, and the worn, wooden picnic tables
are all carved up with initials, Greek letters
and other relics from a Stanford gone by.

When the sun is shining, the "beer garden"
out back is idyllic. This is an ideal place to
watch a football game with a mix of Portola
Valley old-timers and Silicon Valley yuppies
in spandex that have huffed and puffed their
way to the bar on $lOOO-dollar road bikes.
More importantly, the burgers here are actu
ally amazing; they're nothing fancy or com
plex, but the sparseness is what makes them

so refreshing and good (that, and the buns
are slathered in butter, which is awesome).
Located at 3915 Alpine Road, Portola Valley
and open until 10 p.m. every day but Sunday,
when they close at 5:30 p.m.

Some other good bets: Buck's in Woodside
(Brunch, decorated with crazy memorabilia,
the place where Silicon Valley VCs made
many of the tech bubble's most important
investment decisions); Nola in Palo Alto (a
fun homage to New Orleans with really good
Cajun food).
