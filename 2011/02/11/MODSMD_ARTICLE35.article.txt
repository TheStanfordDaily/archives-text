## Lively Arts: The Umbilical Brothers 
### — stav ZIV contact stav: sziv@stanford. edu 
Billed among dance and theater program
ming in venues across the nation and
around the world, the Umbilical Brothers'
performances can scarcely be described in
terms of dance or drama alone. Add physical
comedy, invoke vaudeville and garnish with
a generous helping of silliness to begin to
approximate what's in store.
Former acting school classmates, Shane
Dundas and David Collins have said they
learned together the "foundations of mod
ern performance: lack of confidence [and]
abject poverty." Upon "deciding that mime
classes aren't loud enough," they assembled
an act of their own, unequivocally louder
and certainly more outrageous, one that

would become the first of many. Initial runs
of their material produced the desired effect
laughter and the Umbilical Brothers
were born in 1990.

In the first year of their endeavor, they
won first prize at a stand-up comedy com

petition in Sydney and took grand prize in
Australia's "Star Search." The dynamic Aussie
duo had audiences rolling in their seats

throughout Australia and began touring
extensively, spreading hilarity in the United
States, Europe, South Africa and more. In
the past two decades, they have performed
in fringe, comedy and mime festivals, at tra
ditional theaters and Woodstock, the
Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night
with David Letterman and more.
"THWAK," created in 1999, was the first
of their productions designed specifically for
American audiences sans cultural transla
tion. That same year, they were listed in
Entertainment Weekly's "100 Most Creative
People in Entertainment," one of many
awards and distinctions they've garnered
over the years.
Called "an uproarious fiesta of carefully
choreographed mayhem," Dundas and
Collins weave their acute sense of comedic

timing, artistry with silence and sound
effects, and enviable physical control with a
propensity to clown around. The Umbilical
Brothers' strain of physical theater toes a
fine line between the intelligent and the
immature, resulting in a comical but clever
program with some explicit language and
references that might make parents wary of
bringing young children along.

In quite the poignant passage of friend
ly competition, the two brainstorm and
demonstrate endless ways to flip each other
off— from slingshot and windshield wipers
to "read between the lines." Their little tiff
dissolves as they ask the audience to suggest
various sports they could enact to creatively
give each other the finger, ending with a
ploy to give them the finger, which had
ostensibly flown beyond the footlights in a
sword fighting accident.
As they slip back and forth between
choreographed material and improvisation,
Dundas and Collins' comedic chemistry
never abates. Though they are not in fact
biological brothers, the ease of their onstage
antics would suggest otherwise.
Dundas and Collins will perform "THWAK"
in Pigott Theatre as part of the Lively Arts
season on Saturday, Feb. 12 at 5 p.m. and 9
p.m., and Sunday, Feb. 13 at 7 p.m.
