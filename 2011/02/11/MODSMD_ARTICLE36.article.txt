## 'The Sworn' lacks bite 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
Ever since "Twilight," it seems
like everyone and their
mother wants a piece of the
vampire-and-werewolf pie. Gail Z.
Martin takes it a step further, com
bining a whole host of fantasy
cliches in her latest novel, "The
Sworn." The main protagonist is a
reluctant king who happens to be
the most powerful sorcerer in the
land, graced with a number of
rare, hereditary magical talents and
inordinate good looks (complete
with striking green eyes). One of
his allies is a shamaness who could
have stepped from the pages of a
Marion Zimmer Bradley novel
into her pseudo-Sioux tipi. The

villain is a dark wizard who uses
blood magic and tampers with

tombs. And then, of course, there
are vampires. And werewolves. She
calls them "vyyash morn" and
"vyrkin," respectively, but that
doesn't make them any less "Team
Edward" or "Team Jacob;" what
saves them, barely, is that none of
them are romancing teenage girls
yet. "The Sworn" is the first
book in a new series, and this
reader, for one, would not be sur
prised if Martin tossed a vampire
human dalliance into book two.
The plot is arguably even
more cringe-worthy. "The Sworn"
opens with a lengthy italicized pro
logue that is nothing more than an
overly-dramatic whirlwind sum
mary of the backstory. This reader
would have been tempted to close

the book then and there if she did
not have a review to write. She
pressed on and found the rest of
the novel only marginally better.
The story was repetitive, trite and
poorly organized; it was, to top it
all off, plagued by inherent struc
tural problems. Martin made the
questionable decision to follow
multiple sets of characters in par
allel, each experiencing the same
threat in a different location. This
can be done well "The Lord of
the Rings" comes to mind but
Martin is no Tolkien. Instead, the
reader is left with the same story
being told three or four times in
disjointed installments, with not
nearly enough variation to make
the second or third retelling inter

esting. Add to this the unfortunate
fact that the various parties are in
communication throughout the
story, and the author's urge to have
them exchange letters describing
the events that have transpired,
and the reader is left to wonder if
perhaps Martin was pressed to
meet a deadline, or a word count.
Ultimately, this reviewer must
admit that she did not finish the
book; she merely hopes that she
has read and recounted enough of
it to spare any other potential
readers the experience.
