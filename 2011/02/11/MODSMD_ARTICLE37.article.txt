# Sarcasm "Mr. Sunshine:" A Case Study
## television WHAT TO WATCH NEXT WEEK 
### – liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Though Matthew Perry is
incontrovertibly the most
prominent cast member of
ABC's new half-hour comedy "Mr.
Sunshine," I'm more interested in
the path of actress Andrea Anders,
who plays Perry's love interest, the
marketing director Alice. Anders
returned to the arena of ABC com
edy on Wednesday in the
"Sunshine" pilot, having taken a
brief hiatus after the cancellation
of "Better off Ted" last spring. It's
interesting that ABC clearly likes
Anders (she's cute, blonde, slightly
sassy) and more so that the alumni
of "Friends" like her (she starred
opposite Matt Leßlanc in "Joey")
but that ABC and its viewers didn't
like "Better off Ted."

From the perspective of finan
cial success, "Better off Ted" failed

because its objective, to satirize

corporate culture and the cretins
who inhabit it, was humorous to
an insufficient audience. To an
avid fan of the show such as
myself— the disinterest of the

majority is ironic because corpora
tions and the products they sell are
the closest we come to universals
in our consumerist culture. The
lesson to take from the cancella
tion of "Better Off Ted" is that
satire and subtlety are not suited to
network television.

With "Mr. Sunshine," however, it
would seem that ABC has not fully

given up on these notions of com
edy, a position that is simultane
ously comforting and confusing.

The show centers on Ben Donovan
(Perry) and his position as manag
er of the Sunshine Center, a San

Diego sports venue. We find a pro
tagonist suffering from self-inflict
ed anhedonia and isolation in a

workplace populated by a delu
sional, self-medicating owner
(Allison Janney), her emotionally
and physically doughy long-lost

son, a former basketball star

turned unfailingly optimistic assis
tant and Anders as the co-worker
with benefits. In the pilot alone,
the circus literally comes to
town, revealing clowns with axes,
lost elephants, a musical and eth
nically offensive press conference,

and Hugo Reyes' new career as

a janitor. As you can see, we've
deviated significantly from

the simple hook of

"Chandler from Friends" and
offered audiences a potpourri
of the absurd, awkward and

borderline offensive,

As such, the show and its mar
keting valorize two antithetical
entities, the former glory of

Matthew Perry and the absurd
lack of realism in the support
ing characters. The result of
this mixture can be seen in the

show's title image: a sun in a
pastel sky with an unexpressive
emoticon face. This seeming
urge to revel in the contrary
via contradictions suggests an
artistic removal that most net
works lack. Perry represents

the traditional MO of network
television: safe, a little stale,
male, heterosexual, all charac-

teristics of the mainstream; the

supporting characters repre
sent a perverse addiction to what is
awkward and unfamiliar. The show
would have us identify with Perry
as the familiar actor and as the
rational character who has per
spective on all the crazy surround
ing him. However, I find myself
drawn to the latter, much in the
way that we appreciate Michael
from "Arrested Development" but
dress up as Tobias or Gob for
Halloween. It's great to see one of
the four major networks produce a
comedy with a sarcastic point of
view and a quirky sensibility, but I
need evidence of coherence for the
characters and the season. The

"Better Off Ted" had a thesis that
trickled down to write the jokes;
the "Mr. Sunshine" functions on a
bottom-up model, in which funny
ideas beg for the greater frame of a

selves in opposition to overarching
themes and conflicts of serials, but
content, especially humor, needs to
work towards a greater goal.
