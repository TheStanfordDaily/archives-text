# Roxy Sass's guide to getting laid on V-Day
## advice 
### â€” roxy SASS 
Valentine's Day celebrates
the execution of an early
Christian martyr around
A.D. 2000 as well as, in more modern
times, the draconian grip that
Hallmark holds upon men in rela
tionships around the world. But for
the true spirit of the holiday, Roxy
advises looking no farther than the
bedroom (or kitchen, abandoned
classroom, back alley, etc.):

Valentine's Day is a time to get laid
whatever it takes.

Roxy never backs away from a
challenge. Want to get a little bang
for your buck this Valentine's Day?
The various methods to unlock suc
cess and to unzip those jeans
lie below:
Jargon-laced pickup lines
Nothing makes that stud in your dis
cussion section perk up like a pickup
line that shows both a deep under
standing of the subject at hand as
well as a willingness to be his or her
subject at hand. Econ major, for
example? Roxy knows that if you toss
a few nonchalant observations about
the steady growth in his private sec
tor and solutions for addressing
inflationary issues, the point gets
across pretty well. Got eyes for your
hot CS ta? /* This method removes
all graphics objects from the canvas,
just as Roxy would like to remove all
clothes from your body. */
Shot-or-send... sans shot

Roxy often finds herself frustrated by
the lack of honesty in today's social
interactions especially via text.

You only have 160 characters, so why
waste them on platitudes and pleas
antries? "Let's get coffee sometime?"
No. "Let's have sex tomorrow?" Yes.
"Are you going out tonight?:)"
Lame. "When I find you at the party,

I'm going to do dirty things to you,
and you're going to like it?" Always.
"I'm kinda busy this week?"
Cowardly. "I actually would rather
date your neighbor?" That's more
like it. College is short; text the truth.
Roxy knows it might lead to some
enemies, but it's also more likely to
lead into someone's bed on the 14th.
Old school

A bouquet of roses is, in many cases, a
highly effective panty dropper. Get
some. (Roxy prefers poppies... just,
you know, for the record.) Girls: The
old adage that the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach is true, but just
so you know, focusing about 10 inches
below instead works pretty well too.
Ex-sex

Roxy's a proud woman, but not too
proud to admit that she has strayed
into this gray area on multiple occa
sions, usually when times are rough
and pickings are slim. Pros: it's an
easy lay and a bad idea, and when
Roxy knows something is just a little
wrong, it makes it feel that much
more right. Cons: it runs the risk of
post-liaison complications. As
always, Roxy's rule of thumb is to be
the guest, not the host, so that she
retains the ability to leave whenever
things shift from raunchy to awk
ward. Peg it and leg it, folks.
