# CARD STREAKS INTO HISTORY
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's basketball
team wrote itself into the record books
once again on Thursday night, cruising to
a 100-59 victory over Washington State.
With the victory, the Cardinal now holds
the record for most consecutive confer
ence wins in the Pac-10.
The No. 3 Cardinal has not lost a con
ference contest since Jan. 18,2009 and has
now eclipsed the prior record of 48 games,
set by Stanford from 1995-98.

Despite the lopsided score, the win
was a bit uncharacteristic for the Cardi
nal, which boasts a perfect 52-0 all-time
record against the Cougars.
Stanford struggled to stop the
Cougars' hot shooting early in the game,
and both junior guard Jazmine Perkins
and sophomore Carly Noyes were perfect
from the floor, combining to go 10-for-10
from the field in the first half.
The Cardinal's flat first half came as a
surprise, and the team couldn't just coast
if it expected to win its 49th consecutive
Pac-10 game. Stanford looked to be head
ing for another easy victory, though, after
opening up a 23-14 lead on freshman
