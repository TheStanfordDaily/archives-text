# CARD STREAKS INTO HISTORY
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's basketball
team wrote itself into the record books
once again on Thursday night, cruising to
a 100-59 victory over Washington State.
With the victory, the Cardinal now holds
the record for most consecutive confer
ence wins in the Pac-10.
The No. 3 Cardinal has not lost a con
ference contest since Jan. 18,2009 and has
now eclipsed the prior record of 48 games,
set by Stanford from 1995-98.

Despite the lopsided score, the win
was a bit uncharacteristic for the Cardi
nal, which boasts a perfect 52-0 all-time
record against the Cougars.
Stanford struggled to stop the
Cougars' hot shooting early in the game,
and both junior guard Jazmine Perkins
and sophomore Carly Noyes were perfect
from the floor, combining to go 10-for-10
from the field in the first half.
The Cardinal's flat first half came as a
surprise, and the team couldn't just coast
if it expected to win its 49th consecutive
Pac-10 game. Stanford looked to be head
ing for another easy victory, though, after
opening up a 23-14 lead on freshman

guard Toni Kokenis' three with 11:28
to go in the half.
But the Cougars weren't going to
give up that easily. Thanks to
Perkins' leadership, Washington
State charged back in the next six
minutes, attacking the basket suc
cessfully past Cardinal forwards
Sarah Boothe, a redshirt sophomore,
and Mikala Ruef, a sophomore. That
helped the Cougars take an improb
able 28-26 lead when Perkins nailed
a three with 6:51 to go.
But when Perkins punched, Stan
ford's Nnemkadi Ogwumike
punched back. The junior forward
did what she needed to do to help
Stanford take back its lead.

Nnemkadi Ogwumike scored
eight of the next 11 points for the
Cardinal, highlighted by a fast break
when senior point guard Jeanette
Pohlen bombed the ball downcourt
to senior forward Kayla Pedersen,
who lost the handle but still managed
to flip a no-look pass to a trailing
Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who laid it
home for a 35-28 lead.

Stanford's traditionally strong
defense also steeled itself when it
needed to, forcing the Cougars to
make bad passes and take even
worse shots. Washington State didn't
score for the last three minutes of the
first half, and the Cardinal took ad
vantage of the Cougars' troubles to
give itself a 46-32 lead heading into
the locker room.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said her team didn't come
out with a great sense of urgency in
the first half.

"With every team that we play,
you look at the final score, but to get
to that 40-point win you have to do
the work," she said. "I thought our
team came out a little casual, and we
were not as aggressive as we needed
to be early in the game."
However, the Cardinal made the
Cougars pay in the first five minutes
of the second half, which Stanford
has dominated in all but one game
this season, a 91-71 loss at DePaul
back on Dec. 16.
Stanford came out of the break
with a 28-7 run to snuff the Cougars'
chances for good just nine minutes

into the half.
The scoring didn't stop there, as
Stanford made an extraordinary
eight three-pointers on its way to a
54-point second half, its second-best
scoring output in the second half all
season on its way to the 41-point win.
Washington State head coach
June Daugherty praised her team's
effort and improvement and mar
veled at the Cardinal's strengths.
"I think they're the best in the
country," Daugherty said. "There's
no doubt in my mind.The thing that's
so remarkable about them is that
they continue to get better every
game. It's why I love being in the Pac
-10 it's a measuring stick every
time you play them."
Stanford's starters weren't as im
pressed with themselves, and they
said that 's the key that has kept them
hungry and successful this season.
"I actually think one of our best
qualities here is that we don't have
an arrogant air about ourselves,"
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said. "We
don't walk in and say 'Oh, we're
Stanford, let's just play, things will
work for us.' When things don't nec
essarily go our way and we're not
performing, it's a lack of concentra
tion ... I think we were too slow in
doing what we were supposed to do
and I think that's why we had a little
slump in the first half."
The Cardinal's "Big Three" were
their usual dominant selves, as
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had a game
high 19 points, Pedersen had 15 and
Pohlen had 12 points and a team
high eight assists.
Kokenis also had an excellent
night off the bench, shooting 5-for-6
to score 13 points, her season high.
Stanford's next test will be the
Washington Huskies, who comes
into Maples Pavilion on Saturday af
ternoon.
The Cardinal handled the
Huskies with an easy 80-51 victory in
their last meeting in Seattle, but the
girls in purple and gold come to
Maples on a hot streak.
Washington has won three of its
last four games over conference foes,
including a 60-49 victory over Cal on
Thursday night to help its confer
ence record to 5-7 overall.
Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. on Satur
day afternoon in Maples Pavilion.

team wrote itself into the record books
once again on Thursday night, cruising to
a 100-59 victory over Washington State.
With the victory, the Cardinal now holds
the record for most consecutive confer
ence wins in the Pac-10.
The No. 3 Cardinal has not lost a con
ference contest since Jan. 18,2009 and has
now eclipsed the prior record of 48 games,
set by Stanford from 1995-98.

Despite the lopsided score, the win
was a bit uncharacteristic for the Cardi
nal, which boasts a perfect 52-0 all-time
record against the Cougars.
Stanford struggled to stop the
Cougars' hot shooting early in the game,
and both junior guard Jazmine Perkins
and sophomore Carly Noyes were perfect
from the floor, combining to go 10-for-10
from the field in the first half.
The Cardinal's flat first half came as a
surprise, and the team couldn't just coast
if it expected to win its 49th consecutive
Pac-10 game. Stanford looked to be head
ing for another easy victory, though, after
opening up a 23-14 lead on freshman

guard Toni Kokenis' three with 11:28
to go in the half.
But the Cougars weren't going to
give up that easily. Thanks to
Perkins' leadership, Washington
State charged back in the next six
minutes, attacking the basket suc
cessfully past Cardinal forwards
Sarah Boothe, a redshirt sophomore,
and Mikala Ruef, a sophomore. That
helped the Cougars take an improb
able 28-26 lead when Perkins nailed
a three with 6:51 to go.
But when Perkins punched, Stan
ford's Nnemkadi Ogwumike
punched back. The junior forward
did what she needed to do to help
Stanford take back its lead.

Nnemkadi Ogwumike scored
eight of the next 11 points for the
Cardinal, highlighted by a fast break
when senior point guard Jeanette
Pohlen bombed the ball downcourt
to senior forward Kayla Pedersen,
who lost the handle but still managed
to flip a no-look pass to a trailing
Nnemkadi Ogwumike, who laid it
home for a 35-28 lead.

Stanford's traditionally strong
defense also steeled itself when it
needed to, forcing the Cougars to
make bad passes and take even
worse shots. Washington State didn't
score for the last three minutes of the
first half, and the Cardinal took ad
vantage of the Cougars' troubles to
give itself a 46-32 lead heading into
the locker room.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said her team didn't come
out with a great sense of urgency in
the first half.

"With every team that we play,
you look at the final score, but to get
to that 40-point win you have to do
the work," she said. "I thought our
team came out a little casual, and we
were not as aggressive as we needed
to be early in the game."
However, the Cardinal made the
Cougars pay in the first five minutes
of the second half, which Stanford
has dominated in all but one game
this season, a 91-71 loss at DePaul
back on Dec. 16.
Stanford came out of the break
with a 28-7 run to snuff the Cougars'
chances for good just nine minutes

into the half.
The scoring didn't stop there, as
Stanford made an extraordinary
eight three-pointers on its way to a
54-point second half, its second-best
scoring output in the second half all
season on its way to the 41-point win.
Washington State head coach
June Daugherty praised her team's
effort and improvement and mar
veled at the Cardinal's strengths.
"I think they're the best in the
country," Daugherty said. "There's
no doubt in my mind.The thing that's
so remarkable about them is that
they continue to get better every
game. It's why I love being in the Pac
-10 it's a measuring stick every
time you play them."
Stanford's starters weren't as im
pressed with themselves, and they
said that 's the key that has kept them
hungry and successful this season.
"I actually think one of our best
qualities here is that we don't have
an arrogant air about ourselves,"
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said. "We
don't walk in and say 'Oh, we're
Stanford, let's just play, things will
work for us.' When things don't nec
essarily go our way and we're not
performing, it's a lack of concentra
tion ... I think we were too slow in
doing what we were supposed to do
and I think that's why we had a little
slump in the first half."
The Cardinal's "Big Three" were
their usual dominant selves, as
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had a game
high 19 points, Pedersen had 15 and
Pohlen had 12 points and a team
high eight assists.
Kokenis also had an excellent
night off the bench, shooting 5-for-6
to score 13 points, her season high.
Stanford's next test will be the
Washington Huskies, who comes
into Maples Pavilion on Saturday af
ternoon.
The Cardinal handled the
Huskies with an easy 80-51 victory in
their last meeting in Seattle, but the
girls in purple and gold come to
Maples on a hot streak.
Washington has won three of its
last four games over conference foes,
including a 60-49 victory over Cal on
Thursday night to help its confer
ence record to 5-7 overall.
Tip-off is set for 2 p.m. on Satur
day afternoon in Maples Pavilion.
