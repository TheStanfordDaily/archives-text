## STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSU considers, debates special fees reform bill 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Special fees reform is on the minds of ASSU rep
resentatives, as a bill for significant reform is making
the rounds from the 12th Undergraduate Senate
(UGS) to the Graduate Student Council (GSC), and
back again.

The UGS will re-vote this coming Tuesday on spe
cial fees reform legislation originally passed at its last
meeting, both to incorporate friendly amendments
adopted at Wednesday's GSC meeting and to re
spond to questions of unconstitutionality surround
ing how the vote was conducted on previous notice.
The current legislation is a more comprehensive
version of a bill passed on Jan. 18 by the Senate, but
rejected by the GSC on Jan. 19. The GSC discussed
the new version of the bill Wednesday, but declined
to vote due to issues of constitutionality and lingering
concerns about the bill's efficacy at solving problems
in the special fees process.

While most student groups receive funding from
ASSU Senate and GSC general fees collected from
students, Volunteer Student Organizations (VSOs)
must rely on special fees for their larger budgets. As
stipulated by the 11th Undergraduate Senate, groups
must petition for signatures from 10 to 15 percent of
the student body to be on the special fees portion of
the spring ballot if they wish to grow their budgets by
more than inflation, which is approximately 1.5 per
cent.The bill under discussion would return the joint
by-laws to the way they were before, allowing student
groups to grow their budgets up to 10 percent plus in
flation without petitioning.

The bill, authored by Senate Chair Michael Cruz
'l2 and Appropriations Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2,
contains three main areas of reform: allowing student
groups to grow their budgets more without petition
ing, changing the reserve tax system on group savings
to a 100 percent formula instead of a tiered system
and releasing refunded students' information to
group leaders.

The bill would also set a timeline for the funding
committee chairs to decide on special fee policies.
"Critical reform includes getting dates and dead
lines specified in the ASSU bylaws," wrote GSC
Funding Committee Chair Krystal St. Julien in an e
mail to The Daily.
She added that the Senate and GSC should "not

just rely on the new elections commissioner to tell us
when to do everything every year."
The legislation was passed quickly at the Senate's
Tuesday meeting with little discussion, in part be
cause of timing pressures as election season ap
proaches. Declarations of intent for special fees
groups opened at 12:01 a.m. this morning. The Senate
will hold an "Appropsathon," a 24-hour series of
meetings with special fee groups, from Saturday to
Sunday during Dance Marathon. Recent legislation
pushed the new deadline for the submission of spe
cial fees declarations of intent, along with itemized
budgets, to Feb. 20, five days after the original dead
line.

Special Fee Refunds
Much of the debate around special fees reform is
centered on the refund rate, the number of students
who choose to request their money back from groups
on a quarterly basis.
The 2009-10 year saw an unprecedented rise in re
fund requests, causing the 11th Undergraduate Sen
ate to adopt its legislation. Cruz pointed to higher full
refund requests this past fall and questioned whether
the legislation was effective in stemming increasing
costs. The 11th Undergraduate Senate decreased the
period for requesting refunds from three to two
weeks.
Cruz said he does not expect the special fees fund
ing as a whole to rise under the new legislation and
does not expect the refund rate to decline.
Vazquez said he sees the legislation as geared to
ward VSO financial officers, "to let them know that
we're listening."
"You never know what's going to happen,"
Vazquez said.
He added that he doesn't see a trend in recent re
fund rates, but hopes the refund rate will drop if the
legislation is adopted.
"It will make the special fee system easier to nav
igate, more transparent and more accountable for
everyone," wrote former Alternative Spring Break
financial officer Minh Dan Vuong 'll in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Others, such as GSC co-chair and doctoral stu
dent Justin Brown, say that history shows that the
changes made by the 11th Undergraduate Senate
