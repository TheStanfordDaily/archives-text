## STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSU considers, debates special fees reform bill 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Special fees reform is on the minds of ASSU rep
resentatives, as a bill for significant reform is making
the rounds from the 12th Undergraduate Senate
(UGS) to the Graduate Student Council (GSC), and
back again.

The UGS will re-vote this coming Tuesday on spe
cial fees reform legislation originally passed at its last
meeting, both to incorporate friendly amendments
adopted at Wednesday's GSC meeting and to re
spond to questions of unconstitutionality surround
ing how the vote was conducted on previous notice.
The current legislation is a more comprehensive
version of a bill passed on Jan. 18 by the Senate, but
rejected by the GSC on Jan. 19. The GSC discussed
the new version of the bill Wednesday, but declined
to vote due to issues of constitutionality and lingering
concerns about the bill's efficacy at solving problems
in the special fees process.

While most student groups receive funding from
ASSU Senate and GSC general fees collected from
students, Volunteer Student Organizations (VSOs)
must rely on special fees for their larger budgets. As
stipulated by the 11th Undergraduate Senate, groups
must petition for signatures from 10 to 15 percent of
the student body to be on the special fees portion of
the spring ballot if they wish to grow their budgets by
more than inflation, which is approximately 1.5 per
cent.The bill under discussion would return the joint
by-laws to the way they were before, allowing student
groups to grow their budgets up to 10 percent plus in
flation without petitioning.

The bill, authored by Senate Chair Michael Cruz
'l2 and Appropriations Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2,
contains three main areas of reform: allowing student
groups to grow their budgets more without petition
ing, changing the reserve tax system on group savings
to a 100 percent formula instead of a tiered system
and releasing refunded students' information to
group leaders.

The bill would also set a timeline for the funding
committee chairs to decide on special fee policies.
"Critical reform includes getting dates and dead
lines specified in the ASSU bylaws," wrote GSC
Funding Committee Chair Krystal St. Julien in an e
mail to The Daily.
She added that the Senate and GSC should "not

just rely on the new elections commissioner to tell us
when to do everything every year."
The legislation was passed quickly at the Senate's
Tuesday meeting with little discussion, in part be
cause of timing pressures as election season ap
proaches. Declarations of intent for special fees
groups opened at 12:01 a.m. this morning. The Senate
will hold an "Appropsathon," a 24-hour series of
meetings with special fee groups, from Saturday to
Sunday during Dance Marathon. Recent legislation
pushed the new deadline for the submission of spe
cial fees declarations of intent, along with itemized
budgets, to Feb. 20, five days after the original dead
line.

Special Fee Refunds
Much of the debate around special fees reform is
centered on the refund rate, the number of students
who choose to request their money back from groups
on a quarterly basis.
The 2009-10 year saw an unprecedented rise in re
fund requests, causing the 11th Undergraduate Sen
ate to adopt its legislation. Cruz pointed to higher full
refund requests this past fall and questioned whether
the legislation was effective in stemming increasing
costs. The 11th Undergraduate Senate decreased the
period for requesting refunds from three to two
weeks.
Cruz said he does not expect the special fees fund
ing as a whole to rise under the new legislation and
does not expect the refund rate to decline.
Vazquez said he sees the legislation as geared to
ward VSO financial officers, "to let them know that
we're listening."
"You never know what's going to happen,"
Vazquez said.
He added that he doesn't see a trend in recent re
fund rates, but hopes the refund rate will drop if the
legislation is adopted.
"It will make the special fee system easier to nav
igate, more transparent and more accountable for
everyone," wrote former Alternative Spring Break
financial officer Minh Dan Vuong 'll in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Others, such as GSC co-chair and doctoral stu
dent Justin Brown, say that history shows that the
changes made by the 11th Undergraduate Senate
work and the previous mechanism
caused problems.
"We know what works the
current system," Brown said.
For groups with budgets as large
as $65,000, a 10 percent increase is
more than the $6,000 cap on total
funds for ordinary student groups.
"The problem is that a ten per
cent increase is pretty significant.
The tax on students would increase,"
said Anton Zeitsman 'll, appropria
tions chair of the 11th Undergradu
ate Senate.
Cruz described the bill as "open
ing one valve and closing another for
a net improvement for special fees
groups and for Stanford."
It would make "the process easi
er, allow [ing] for sustainable growth
that is keeping in line with increasing
costs," he said, saying that costs to
student groups increase faster than
inflation.

"We're subject to market forces
that inflation doesn't take into ac
count," Cruz said, adding that a full
explanation is "above my pay

grade."
Vazquez stressed that the group
budgets would still need to be ap
proved by the respective funding
committees before going on the bal
lot.
One aspect of the legislation
Cruz and Vazquez said would serve
to counteract the lower barriers to
budget growth would be the re
placement of the current, tiered sys
tem of reserve taxes. Under the leg
islation, if student group reserves
exceed their expenditures for the
previous year, 100 percent of the ex
cess would be applied as part of
their special fee funds, decreasing
the total amount budgeted by the
ASSU to the group for the next
year.
Release of Names
A controversial part of the legis
lation is the release of information
the names, SUNet IDs and
SUIDs of students who requested
special fees refunds to VSO fi
nancial officers, presidents and key
officers. This change would allow
group leaders to ensure that stu
dents who request refunds from
their group, and are thus ineligible
for the group's services, do not at
tend their events.

Until the 11th Undergraduate
Senate overturned the policy last
February, VSOs could request the
SUIDs of students who requested
refunds.
"I'm most excited about the re
lease of names," Vazquez said,
adding that student groups "have a
right to know who took money away
from them."

Zeitsman described the policy of
giving student names to group offi
cers as "nearly unenforceable."
While no mechanism is proscribed
in the bill, the enforcement would
be up to the discretion of the finan
cial officers.

Brown said several GSC voting
members were uncomfortable at
Wednesday's meeting about the re
lease of names, viewing it as a
"breach of privacy," even though the
University's legal counsel has given
the go-ahead.
Brown also said he feels many
GSC members believe "it will not go
over well with the student body be
cause of privacy" concerns.

The "Fundamental Problem" with
Special Fees
As the back-and-forth legislation
shows, debate over the complicated
special fees funding process is not

new. What recent debate allows,
however, according to Brown, is a
look at the fundamental problems
plaguing the process, on the exis
tence of which, at least, all represen
tatives seem to agree.
"The fundamental problem is
everybody can vote on a special fee
group [in the spring election] and
then request a refund [on a quarter
ly basis]," Brown said. "It's a catas
trophe waiting to happen."
"That's when you get into the fis
cal crisis that happened last year,"
Brown said.
"The bill that is being presented
does not fix that."
Brown said he is not sure yet
whether this shortcoming will affect
his vote.
"This is a learning opportunity
for every student on campus, regard
less if they're an American citizen or
not," Brown said. "It means you
need to be cognizant of the policies
being made."
Zachary Warma 'll, an 11th Un
dergraduate Senator and Daily staff
member, said he sees the legislation
as "inherently flawed" which is "dan
gerously infringing on people's
rights."
Warma said he sees the debate as
reflecting fundamental flaws in the

ASSU. "The ASSU doesn't do advo
cacy what the ASSU is about is
money," he said.

Warma added that he views the
legislation as a special interest bill,
supported by Senators elected by
particular VSOs and endorsing bod
ies, such as the Students for Color
Coalition (SOCC), which won 10
seats in the 12th Undergraduate
Senate.

"It's frustrating to see [different]
private interest groups dominate the
government alternating years,"
Brown said of the recurring debate.

"Governments like this are run
by special interest groups that's
true everywhere," Brown said.
"What we shouldn't see is one group
of individuals with a special interest
dominate the pockets of those who
don't agree with them.
Brown added that he views all
undergraduate "political parties"
negatively, regardless of their name
or agenda.
"We're Stanford students," he
said. "We can do better than this."
