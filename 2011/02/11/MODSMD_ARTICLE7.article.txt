### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
Writer in residence Lyonel Trouil
lot presented the "Everlasting Strug
gle Between 'We' and 'l'" in
Levinthal Hall yesterday evening.
Trouillot spoke about current chal
lenges in Haiti and how these chal
lenges manifest themselves in Hait
ian literature.
The Research Unit of the Division
of Literatures, Cultures and Lan
guages (DLCL) hosted the lecture.
Born in Port-au-Prince in 1956,
Trouillot studied law before becom
ing a journalist and novelist. He was
active in campaigning for democracy
in Haiti and wrote about how culture
functions within a nation. He is a pro
fessor of literature and poetry in
Port-au-Prince and has written sever
al novels, including "Les Enfants des
Beros" and "Therese en Mille
Morceaux." Trouillot was awarded
the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres
in June 2010.

At Thursday's lecture, Trouillot
described Haiti's current state as cat
astrophic, attributing this, in part, to
his belief that "Haiti never felt the ne
cessity to replicate principles of the
French Revolution."

In the late 19th and early 20th cen
turies, thinkers explored strategies
for developing a successful republic
in their writing. It was believed that
Haiti had to follow the model of
Western states and, in doing so, serve
as the model for Africa and other na
tions.

Today, one of the defining aspects
of Haitian society is a lack of a cohe
sive national identity, Trouillot said.
Haitian society is made up of a collec

tion of distinct groups of "others"
that often interact with hostility.
According to Trouillot, this divi
siveness has been reflected in litera
ture time and time again. The result is
a "Haitian novel" that consistently
lacks a sense of "we."

Novelists now are addressing this
lack of community in their art in
order to encourage togetherness. The
poet-author said Haitian poetry
often focuses on illustrations of
power and the role of the individual.
The country, he noted, is often depict
ed as a place of each man for himself,
a republic of puppets destined to un
ravel.
"Our country is still waiting to
come out of text to be reality," Trouil
lot said, referring to dreams for Haiti
that are imagined in literature.
Trouillot said he examined the
struggle between the "I" and the
"we" as well as the quest for individ
uality in each of his texts. From his
perspective, the most important as
pect of the writing process is "to dis
appear, to let the character develop
his or her voice," and to let different
voices expose the tension in polypho
ny.
Trouillot said his ultimate goal is
to "try to add a few verses to the his
tory of Haiti. By doing so, I want to
contribute to the larger poem of the
world."
In his novel "Street of Lost Foot
steps," Trouillot described Haiti's
landscape as "27,000 kilometers of
hatred and desolation."
However, he closed his lecture
yesterday on an uplifting note that
showed his pride for his land of ori
gin.
"Today, my 27,000 kilometers are
good enough for me," Trouillot said.
