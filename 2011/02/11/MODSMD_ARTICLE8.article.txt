## Novel SLAC images combine art, science X-ray shoots images on molecular level 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
The world's largest X-ray ma
chine is capturing images of some of
life's smallest compounds at one
quadrillionth of a second.
A collaborative group of re
searchers published two studies in
Nature on Feb. 3 that gave a first
look at femtosecond imaging of sin
gle particles and nano-sized crys
tals. Femtosecond imaging is a pho
tography technique that uses very
brief pulses.
Using the SLAC National Accel
erator Laboratory's Linac Coher
ent Light Source (LCLS). the group
obtained a 2-D picture of the
world's largest virus, the mimivirus,
in a single shot. The group also used
the LCLS to develop a 3-D image of
Photosystem I, a protein membrane
system involved in photosynthesis,
from nanoscale protein crystals.
The group's nanocrystallogra
phy experiment was a "proof of
principle," said Stanford physicist
and study co-author Marvin Seib
ert. When researchers compared
their LCLS image to its previously
known structure, they found that
the two images matched. This, in
turn, gave credibility to the process
of femtosecond nanoscale crystal
lography.
Prior to the development of the
femtosecond imaging, researchers
had to grow proteins in large crys
tals to photograph them with con
ventional X-ray sources. According
to Seibert, this process would take
up to 13 years to yield results.
"Crystallography is more art
than science," Seibert said. "It's lit
erally trial and error."
Conventional X-rays often can
only process large-scale crystals be
cause the rays destroy small sam
ples before they can be analyzed.
The beauty of femtosecond imag
ing, however, is in detecting beat de
struction.
This technology is photography
"taken to the extreme," Seibert
said.
"When you do high speed pho
tography, you have a dark image

and open the shutter just as a flash
of light illuminates the sample,"
Seibert said.
Similarly, "the photon pulse [of
the LCLS] comes along as a very
bright light that illuminates the
dark sample and diffracts onto de
tectors," he said.
The success behind the imaging
in the two experiments rested in
their ability to reduce the pulse to a
femtosecond.
The pulse lasts only a femtosec
ond and the photons diffract off the
sample before the molecule ex
plodes from the radiation. The
group can use the diffracting pat
terns to construct its image, because
damage to the crystal becomes de
tectable after the photons have
come in contact with the sample,
Seibert said.
Researchers compiled tens of
thousands of images to construct 3-
D images of proteins in nanocrys
tallography. The 2-D mimivirus
image, however, requires only one
shot, hence the name "single parti
cle" imaging.
The shorter time also allowed
the researchers to reduce sample
size.
"You don't need any crystal at all
[for the mimivirus]," Seibert said.
The 3-D proteins only require
very small nanoscale crystals, as op
posed to the one large crystal re
quired in the past.
However, nanoscale imaging is
not without its complications. Coor
dinating the samples, photon beam
and detector requires precision.
"It's not as extreme as a satellite
launch, but then again it is not as ex
pensive and not as many people
[are involved]," Seibert said.
Due to the success of these im
ages, the Coherent X-ray Imaging
instrument (CXI) is now being de
veloped specifically for imaging sin
gle particle and nanoscale crystals
with SLAC's LCLS.
"This will hopefully open up the
technique to image 3-D structures
from non-crystalline biological
molecules," Seibert said.
Currently, scientists know the
shape of only six of the 30,000 mem
brane proteins in the human body.
Thus, the CXI has the potential to
significantly enhance research's
