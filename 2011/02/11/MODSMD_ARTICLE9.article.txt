## FINDING FROSOCO Insiders from this far-flung community explore its significance 
### KADEN FREEMAN 
On the far west side of campus lies
a place that, for many Stanford
students, is shrouded in mystery,
existing only as an optional essay
question on the required fresh
man housing application forms. Rumors
abound that FroSoCo students are nerdy, in
troverted freshmen and sophomores hidden
away on the fringes of Stanford, but few know
exactly what the clever acronym is or what the
residence represents.
According to the Stanford University Res
idential Education website, FroSoCo, or
Freshman Sophomore College, "provides the
vibrant residential intellectual community of
a small, elite, liberal-arts college while provid
ing enhanced access to the academic re
sources of one of the world's premier re
search universities." But where did this idea
come from, and what exactly does that mean?
The program was implemented during the
1999-2000 academic year by John Bravman,
the former vice provost for undergraduate
education at Stanford. Bravman wanted to
add a residential component to undergradu
ate education at Stanford, and he did so by
combining two traditional Stanford dorms
Adams and Schiff to create the college.
Bravman acted as the college's dean until
2010, when he left Stanford to become presi
dent of Bucknell University. Dr. Nadeem
Hussain '9O took over Bravman's position
and now lives with his wife across the street
from the college.

Hussain, a philosophy professor, ex
plained FroSoCo as Stanford's version of the
colleges of Yale and houses of Harvard, which
themselves were inspired by the colleges of
Oxford and Cambridge. The goal was to give
students "at a big research university like
Stanford the feel of a small college," Hussain
said.

"[Schiff and Adams] weren't just stuck to
gether and given a label; they were given a
purpose," he continued.

FroSoCo sets itself apart from other fresh
man dorms by providing "social activities in
volving more than one dorm" and "an envi
ronment to get to know faculty better," Hus
sain said.

One way that it does this is by having a
much larger staff than other dorms. The stu
dent staff consists of eight College Assistants
(FroSoCo's version of Residential Assistants,
or RAs), two Residential Computer Consul
tants (RCCs), one Resident Media Coordina
tor (the only one on campus), one Peer
Health Educator (PHE), two subject tutors,
one writing tutor and an Oral Communica
tion Tutor. In addition, the Stanford faculty
involved with FroSoCo include two College
Directors (FroSoCo's version of Resident
Fellows) for each house, the College Program
Associate, the Director of the Oral Commu
nications Program and the College Dean and
his partner. These 24 staff members serve a
total of about 100 freshman and 60 sopho
mores, a much larger faculty-to-student ratio
than the typical seven or eight staff members
found in an 80 to 85-person freshman dorm.
FroSoCo utilizes these many staff mem

bers, plus a larger allocation of funds than
other dorms have, to provide social and aca
demic opportunities that are not offered else
where on campus. Such opportunities include
Dean's Dinners, in which different guests and
faculty take part in a one-hour open talk and
then a more intimate dinner with a dozen or so
FroSoCo students, who sign up on a first come,
first serve basis.

FroSoCo also offers the Sophomore Fel
lows Program, in which resident sophomores
teach unique non-credit classes for students.
Flussein described a recent class that focused
on gun control and culminated in a trip to a
gun range.
George Tsiveriotis 'l3, a FroSoCo alum
who now lives in a row house, said he chose to
live in FroSoCo his freshman year because "it
was the best of both worlds, with lots of fresh
man, but not all four classes just sopho
mores to guide you."
Though he chose to not live in FroSoCo as
a sophomore (all freshmen in FroSoCo can
automatically be placed there for their soph
omore year), he admitted that "most of the
people I hang out with this year are from
FroSoCo last year." He feels that FroSoCo is
quieter, more isolated and more introverted
than other freshman housing on campus, but
also noted the benefit of having the opportu
nity to meet everyone there.
"I feel more connected to it now that I
don't live there," he said, "and [l] would love
to go back senior year to staff."
Current Schiff residents Halsey Hoster 'l4
and Melis Tekant 'l4 described FroSoCo as a
good freshman residence due to the small

community the college offers. However, they
both agreed that while they aren't unhappy
with the choice, neither was sure if they would
do it again.
"It's harder to keep close friends who live
on East campus," Hoster said. "If you live in
FroSoCo, your closer friends are from FroSo-
Co."
The two girls described the typical FroSo-
Co student as an engineering major or techie
and said that most don't want to go out very
often. They feel "socially far away" from the
rest of campus and describe themselves as the
techie version of SLE kids, except that none
of their extra programming is required.
Cisco Barron 'O4, who will be one of the
new College Directors at FroSoCo next year
and is a FroSoCo alum himself, looks back on
his time at the college as a "very positive ex
perience." He described the students in
FroSoCo as "enthusiastic, engaging, free
thinking, tightly knit and quirky," and in his
new position next year hopes to "articulate
and disseminate" FroSoCo's vision "so more
students are aware of what we do and how we
do it."
While FroSoCo is much more intricate and
complex than one may initially realize, it may
still remain a mystery to many students in its
corner of the campus. However, the lack of
awareness goes both ways.
Most students at FroSoCo are "not sure about
how it is over at Wilbur or Stern," Hoster said.

add a residential component to undergradu
ate education at Stanford, and he did so by
combining two traditional Stanford dorms
Adams and Schiff to create the college.
Bravman acted as the college's dean until
2010, when he left Stanford to become presi
dent of Bucknell University. Dr. Nadeem
Hussain '9O took over Bravman's position
and now lives with his wife across the street
from the college.

Hussain, a philosophy professor, ex
plained FroSoCo as Stanford's version of the
colleges of Yale and houses of Harvard, which
themselves were inspired by the colleges of
Oxford and Cambridge. The goal was to give
students "at a big research university like
Stanford the feel of a small college," Hussain
said.

"[Schiff and Adams] weren't just stuck to
gether and given a label; they were given a
purpose," he continued.

FroSoCo sets itself apart from other fresh
man dorms by providing "social activities in
volving more than one dorm" and "an envi
ronment to get to know faculty better," Hus
sain said.

One way that it does this is by having a
much larger staff than other dorms. The stu
dent staff consists of eight College Assistants
(FroSoCo's version of Residential Assistants,
or RAs), two Residential Computer Consul
tants (RCCs), one Resident Media Coordina
tor (the only one on campus), one Peer
Health Educator (PHE), two subject tutors,
one writing tutor and an Oral Communica
tion Tutor. In addition, the Stanford faculty
involved with FroSoCo include two College
Directors (FroSoCo's version of Resident
Fellows) for each house, the College Program
Associate, the Director of the Oral Commu
nications Program and the College Dean and
his partner. These 24 staff members serve a
total of about 100 freshman and 60 sopho
mores, a much larger faculty-to-student ratio
than the typical seven or eight staff members
found in an 80 to 85-person freshman dorm.
FroSoCo utilizes these many staff mem

bers, plus a larger allocation of funds than
other dorms have, to provide social and aca
demic opportunities that are not offered else
where on campus. Such opportunities include
Dean's Dinners, in which different guests and
faculty take part in a one-hour open talk and
then a more intimate dinner with a dozen or so
FroSoCo students, who sign up on a first come,
first serve basis.

FroSoCo also offers the Sophomore Fel
lows Program, in which resident sophomores
teach unique non-credit classes for students.
Flussein described a recent class that focused
on gun control and culminated in a trip to a
gun range.
George Tsiveriotis 'l3, a FroSoCo alum
who now lives in a row house, said he chose to
live in FroSoCo his freshman year because "it
was the best of both worlds, with lots of fresh
man, but not all four classes just sopho
mores to guide you."
Though he chose to not live in FroSoCo as
a sophomore (all freshmen in FroSoCo can
automatically be placed there for their soph
omore year), he admitted that "most of the
people I hang out with this year are from
FroSoCo last year." He feels that FroSoCo is
quieter, more isolated and more introverted
than other freshman housing on campus, but
also noted the benefit of having the opportu
nity to meet everyone there.
"I feel more connected to it now that I
don't live there," he said, "and [l] would love
to go back senior year to staff."
Current Schiff residents Halsey Hoster 'l4
and Melis Tekant 'l4 described FroSoCo as a
good freshman residence due to the small

community the college offers. However, they
both agreed that while they aren't unhappy
with the choice, neither was sure if they would
do it again.
"It's harder to keep close friends who live
on East campus," Hoster said. "If you live in
FroSoCo, your closer friends are from FroSo-
Co."
The two girls described the typical FroSo-
Co student as an engineering major or techie
and said that most don't want to go out very
often. They feel "socially far away" from the
rest of campus and describe themselves as the
techie version of SLE kids, except that none
of their extra programming is required.
Cisco Barron 'O4, who will be one of the
new College Directors at FroSoCo next year
and is a FroSoCo alum himself, looks back on
his time at the college as a "very positive ex
perience." He described the students in
FroSoCo as "enthusiastic, engaging, free
thinking, tightly knit and quirky," and in his
new position next year hopes to "articulate
and disseminate" FroSoCo's vision "so more
students are aware of what we do and how we
do it."
While FroSoCo is much more intricate and
complex than one may initially realize, it may
still remain a mystery to many students in its
corner of the campus. However, the lack of
awareness goes both ways.
Most students at FroSoCo are "not sure about
how it is over at Wilbur or Stern," Hoster said.

On the far west side of campus lies
a place that, for many Stanford
students, is shrouded in mystery,
existing only as an optional essay
question on the required fresh
man housing application forms. Rumors
abound that FroSoCo students are nerdy, in
troverted freshmen and sophomores hidden
away on the fringes of Stanford, but few know
exactly what the clever acronym is or what the
residence represents.
According to the Stanford University Res
idential Education website, FroSoCo, or
Freshman Sophomore College, "provides the
vibrant residential intellectual community of
a small, elite, liberal-arts college while provid
ing enhanced access to the academic re
sources of one of the world's premier re
search universities." But where did this idea
come from, and what exactly does that mean?
The program was implemented during the
1999-2000 academic year by John Bravman,
the former vice provost for undergraduate
education at Stanford. Bravman wanted to
add a residential component to undergradu
ate education at Stanford, and he did so by
combining two traditional Stanford dorms
Adams and Schiff to create the college.
Bravman acted as the college's dean until
2010, when he left Stanford to become presi
dent of Bucknell University. Dr. Nadeem
