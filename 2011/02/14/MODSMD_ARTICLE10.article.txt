# VALENTINE'S DAY AROUND THE WORLD
## 
### JENNY THAT STAFF WRITER 
In the weeks leading up to Feb.
14, consumers are bombarded
with commercials and adver
tisements for chocolates,
restaurants and business ven
ues especially catered to the season
of romantic love. Couples plan for
this special occasion, with celebra
tions ranging from a fancy dinner for
two to extravagant gift giving to sim
ple card exchanges. Others, less en
thralled by the idea of a holiday
founded in romance, dub Valentine's
Day "Singles Awareness (or Appre
ciation) Day," appropriately abbrevi
ated to SAD.
But while many view Valentine's
Day as less of a "real" holiday and
more a product of blatant commer
cialism and Hallmark products,
Valentine's Day has a surprisingly
long and multicultural history.
Legends of Saint Valentine
Valentine's Day, named after one
(or more) Saint Valentine, finds its
beginnings in ancient Roman and
Christian tradition.
"Valentine's Day originate[d] in
the Middle Ages," wrote English
professor Michelle Karnes, who spe
cializes in medievalism, in an e-mail
to The Daily. "Or at least Valentine's
Day as it's associated with love. The
cult of Saint Valentine is much older
Valentine was a Christian martyr
of the third century, one who began
to be commemorated by the church
on Feb. 14 around the fifth century."
However, the exact story of Saint
Valentine is confusing, entrenched
deeply in the depths of age-old myth
and legend. One popular legend in
volves an imprisoned Valentine, who,
in love with his jailor's daughter, sent
her the first "valentine" card before
his death.The letter was signed "from
your Valentine," a signature that is
still popularly used today.
According to Karnes, Geoffrey
Chaucer, best known for writing
"The Canterbury Tales," made the
first reference to Valentine's Day as a
holiday celebrating love. In the Mid
dle Ages, people believed that Feb. 14
was the first day of the bird mating
season, a day appropriate for the
young to express their love.

"As far as we know, Chaucer
made the first reference to Valen
tine's Day as a holiday that's above
love, as a day when lovers choose
their mates," Karnes said. "He makes
the reference in one of his dream vi
sions, the 'Parliament of Fowls.'
There, he's referring specifically to
birds who choose their mates every
year on St. Valentine's Day."
Valentine's Day became an occa
sion for friends and lovers to ex
change handwritten letters of affec
tion during the 17th and 18th cen
turies. By the end of the 18th century,
printed, ready-made cards replaced
letters. They were a convenient way
to express one's feelings during a
time when public, direct love confes

sions were discouraged.
While Valentine's Day cards are
still popular according to the
Greeting Card Association, Valen
tine's Day is the second largest card
sending holiday shows of affec
tion between couples have expanded
to include dinner dates, chocolates
and flowers.
Chinese Valentine's Day (Double-
Seventh Festival)
The idea of a holiday celebrating
love is not exclusive to Western coun
tries. The Chinese have traditionally
celebrated a holiday similar to Valen
tine's Day called the Double Seventh
Festival, or Qi Xi Jie.
Qi Xi Jie is based on a Chinese
folktale involving a cowherd and a
spinning maid that fall madly in love.
Tragically, they are separated for
eternity by the spinning maid's moth
er, a goddess, who created the Milky
Way as a barrier to divide them. But
on the seventh day of the seventh
month, a flock of magpies create a
bridge for the lovers to unite for one
night.
Traditionally, the Double-Sev
enth Festival was an occasion to cel
ebrate women's works, rather than
to encourage young and rebellious
romance.
"Once upon a time, mainly
women came up to [the festival] to
plead for skills in embroidering and
weaving," Chinese professor Flaiyan
Lee said. "It was a time for women to
congregate, as they usually didn't get
to see other women all that often."
Although the Double-Seventh
Festival folktale is a "pan-Chinese leg
end," according to Lee, Chinese Valen
tine's Day is actually no longer as com
monly observed, especially with the
rising popularity of Western Valen
tine's Day practices in urban areas.
"Many Chinese will regard the
Western version of Valentine's Day
as more authentic," said Lee. "The
idea of a 'Chinese Valentine's Day' it
self is rather paradoxical because
while the Chinese had love stories
such as the [Double-Seventh myth],
these stories precisely exist because
there was no romantic love, given the
traditional family structure then."
"Now, romantic love has become
entrenched in modern China [be
cause it] has embraced Western
ideals," she added.
Valentine's Day and White Day in
Japan
As in China, Western Valentine's
Day practices have been incorporat
ed into Japanese culture, but with a
twist. On Valentine's Day, also cele
brated on Feb. 14, women present
men with homemade chocolates, and
the men return the favor a month
later on an occasion called White
Day. In recent years, this tradition has
expanded to include women giving
chocolates not only to their lovers,
but to other people as well.
"[Valentine's Day] used to be con
sidered an opportunity for women to
give their love to men," history pro
fessor Jun Uchida said in an e-mail to
The Daily. "But in recent decades
women have begun to give chocolate
to their male bosses, colleagues, even
teachers (called "giri choco" or
"chocolate out of obligation")."
Valentine's Day at Stanford
Fondly dubbed "Singles Aware
ness (or Appreciation) Day" by
many Stanford students, Valentine's
Day tends to have a relatively low
impact on students' lives, especially
given its arrival in the hectic middle
of the quarter and the high frequen
cy of singles on campus.
"It comes at a kind of bad time,"
said James Acevedo 'l3. "People
have been so busy with midterms;it's
hard for anyone to plan."

Nonetheless, Valentine's Day is
indeed existent on the Stanford cam
pus, be it Resident Assistants giving
single roses to their residents, or cou
ples at Stanford taking time out of
their busy schedules to commemo
rate the holiday.
"Last year, we had dinner in San
Francisco," Avecedo said. "This year,
we'll do dinner, too."
Some couples go above and be
yond the simple dinner date, spend
ing large sums of money on presents
for their significant others, planning
unique love-filled outings or simply
incorporating cultural traditions to
enhance the romantic experience.
"Although there's no rule or
Mexican tradition about it, there is
something special and very romantic
about serenading your partner with
a mariachi serenata," said Laura
Pulido 'l3, a member of Stanford's
mariachi ensemble. "It's acknowl
edged as something romantic that
everyone can appreciate,"
