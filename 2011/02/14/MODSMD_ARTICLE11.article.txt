## EDITORIAL ASSU Should Build on Special Fees Reforms, Not Scrap Them 
### 
Each year, millions of dollars in
special fees are given to a broad
array of student groups on
campus. This week, the Undergradu
ate Senate and Graduate Student
Council (GSC) will vote on aproposal
to reform the process by which these
funds are distributed. They should re
ject efforts to repeal the improve
ments made last year, but approve a
measure to close the loophole that al
lows students to enjoy free services
even if they request ASSU fee refunds.
Last year, seeking to lower the
number of students who request a fee
refund from the ASSU, both legisla
tive bodies voted to make it more dif
ficult for Voluntary Student Organi
zations (VSOs) to increase their spe
cial fees requests. Under those rules,
to request any budget increase be
yond inflation on the spring Special
Fees ballot, a VSO would first have to
collect the signatures of 10 to 15 per
cent of the student body. The Under
graduate Senate's Appropriations
Committee also tightened rules gov
erning VSOs' use of funds, for exam
ple, by restricting the use of students'
tax dollars to purchase food.
Opponents of last year's policies
have plenty of evidence to back their
criticism. Some groups, having decid
ed to take the plunge and petition the
student body for a larger budget, real
ized that asking for a 10-percent in
crease was just as difficult as asking for
100 percent, and ratcheted up their
budget requests accordingly. Like
wise, they argue that there is no reason
students who skim special fees ballots
are any more likely to scrutinize peti
tions. As a result, student groups with
the manpower to launch large peti
tion campaigns are almost assured of
securing a spot on the ballot.
Yet, by the most telling metric, last
year's policies have succeeded in
serving the student body. As predict
ed, the number of students request
ing refunds and the total dollar
amount of student refund requests
declined over the previous year,
lending credence to predictions that
stricter fiscal controls would improve
voter confidence and lower the over
all refund rate. Interestingly, the
number of students requesting a full
refund increased dramatically
that is, the number of students choos
ing to opt out of paying any money to
student groups, rather than funding
some but not others. While partial re
funders by definition have chosen
which groups to fund conscientious
ly, full refunds are likely the result of
an unprecedented effort by conser
vative groups last year to raise stu
dent awareness about the existence
of a refund policy. Since last year's
changes succeeded in lowering the
dollar amount of refunds, they ac

complished the stated goal of in
creasing overall voter satisfaction
with the ASSU's fiscal policies and
the current ASSU should think twice
before repealing them.
That said, all sides agree that the
system is still flawed in the following
respect: under current rules, a student
might vote to approve a group's spe
cial fees funding in the spring, request
a refund the following quarter, and yet
continue to use that group's services
fortherestoftheyear.Earlierthisyear,
the Undergraduate Senate sought to
reduce student refunds by shortening
the refund period from the first three
weeks to the first two weeks of the
quarter.Thiswasamistake.The ASSU
should lower the refund rate by re
warding financial participation, not by
erecting ever-stricter deadlines. One of
the proposed changes up for a vote this
week would provide such a solution.
By releasing the names and
SUIDs of those who seek refund re
quests to the groups they deny fund
ing, the ASSU can encourage more
prudent use of the refund option.
While requesting a refund is any stu
dent's right, continuing to enjoy serv
ices free of charge is not. Last year, the
Undergraduate Senate suspended
such releases of personal information
due to privacy and legality concerns,
but the University's Office of Legal
Counsel has since clarified that the
policy is legal.The ASSU should rein
state this practice, as long as sufficient
safeguards are included to ensure
that refund request information is
used only to limit services to those
who pay for them, not to intimidate or
harass those who opt out.
Ultimately, bringing down special
fees costs and restoring voter confi
dence in their elected representatives
will require addressing two inconven
ient truths that are beyond the ASSU's
control. First, student voters are rarely
diligent in their examination of the
special fees ballot. Evaluating group
budgets takes time and effort, and
Stanford students have proven simply
too busy to make informed decisions
As a result, virtually 100 percent of
special fees groups are approved each
spring. Second, the best defense
against wasteful VSO spending is not
some landmark reform, but the con
tinual scrutiny of each year's Appro
priations Committees.
Yet, the ASSU is not powerless It
can bend the cost curve down while
preserving the diverse community of
student organizations that thrive on
special fees By keeping those policies
that have proven successful and link
ing students' financial support for
VSOs with access to their services and
events, the ASSU can address some of
the flaws in a funding system that is es
sential to student life.

vative groups last year to raise stu

of a refund policy. Since last year's
changes succeeded in lowering the
dollar amount of refunds, they ac

complished the stated goal of in
creasing overall voter satisfaction
with the ASSU's fiscal policies and
the current ASSU should think twice
before repealing them.
That said, all sides agree that the
system is still flawed in the following
respect: under current rules, a student
might vote to approve a group's spe
cial fees funding in the spring, request
a refund the following quarter, and yet
continue to use that group's services
fortherestoftheyear.Earlierthisyear,
the Undergraduate Senate sought to
reduce student refunds by shortening
the refund period from the first three
weeks to the first two weeks of the
quarter.Thiswasamistake.The ASSU
should lower the refund rate by re
warding financial participation, not by
erecting ever-stricter deadlines. One of
the proposed changes up for a vote this
week would provide such a solution.
By releasing the names and
SUIDs of those who seek refund re
quests to the groups they deny fund
ing, the ASSU can encourage more
prudent use of the refund option.
While requesting a refund is any stu
dent's right, continuing to enjoy serv
ices free of charge is not. Last year, the
Undergraduate Senate suspended
such releases of personal information
due to privacy and legality concerns,

Counsel has since clarified that the
policy is legal.The ASSU should rein
state this practice, as long as sufficient
safeguards are included to ensure
that refund request information is
used only to limit services to those
who pay for them, not to intimidate or
harass those who opt out.
Ultimately, bringing down special
fees costs and restoring voter confi

will require addressing two inconven

control. First, student voters are rarely
diligent in their examination of the
special fees ballot. Evaluating group
budgets takes time and effort, and
Stanford students have proven simply
too busy to make informed decisions
As a result, virtually 100 percent of
special fees groups are approved each
spring. Second, the best defense
against wasteful VSO spending is not
some landmark reform, but the con
tinual scrutiny of each year's Appro
priations Committees.
Yet, the ASSU is not powerless It
can bend the cost curve down while
preserving the diverse community of
student organizations that thrive on
special fees By keeping those policies
that have proven successful and link

VSOs with access to their services and
events, the ASSU can address some of
the flaws in a funding system that is es
sential to student life.

Each year, millions of dollars in
special fees are given to a broad
array of student groups on
campus. This week, the Undergradu
ate Senate and Graduate Student
Council (GSC) will vote on aproposal
to reform the process by which these
funds are distributed. They should re
ject efforts to repeal the improve
ments made last year, but approve a
measure to close the loophole that al
lows students to enjoy free services
even if they request ASSU fee refunds.
Last year, seeking to lower the
number of students who request a fee
refund from the ASSU, both legisla
tive bodies voted to make it more dif
ficult for Voluntary Student Organi
zations (VSOs) to increase their spe
cial fees requests. Under those rules,
to request any budget increase be
yond inflation on the spring Special
Fees ballot, a VSO would first have to
collect the signatures of 10 to 15 per
cent of the student body. The Under
graduate Senate's Appropriations
Committee also tightened rules gov
erning VSOs' use of funds, for exam
ple, by restricting the use of students'
tax dollars to purchase food.
Opponents of last year's policies
have plenty of evidence to back their
criticism. Some groups, having decid
ed to take the plunge and petition the
student body for a larger budget, real
ized that asking for a 10-percent in
crease was just as difficult as asking for
100 percent, and ratcheted up their
budget requests accordingly. Like
wise, they argue that there is no reason
students who skim special fees ballots
are any more likely to scrutinize peti
tions. As a result, student groups with
the manpower to launch large peti
tion campaigns are almost assured of
securing a spot on the ballot.
Yet, by the most telling metric, last
year's policies have succeeded in
serving the student body. As predict
ed, the number of students request
ing refunds and the total dollar
amount of student refund requests
declined over the previous year,
lending credence to predictions that
stricter fiscal controls would improve
voter confidence and lower the over
all refund rate. Interestingly, the
number of students requesting a full
refund increased dramatically
that is, the number of students choos
ing to opt out of paying any money to
student groups, rather than funding
some but not others. While partial re
funders by definition have chosen
which groups to fund conscientious
ly, full refunds are likely the result of
an unprecedented effort by conser
vative groups last year to raise stu
dent awareness about the existence
of a refund policy. Since last year's
changes succeeded in lowering the

complished the stated goal of in
