## A
						Motion to Express Support for a Non-Binding Referendum 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
You have to love bureaucracy. Last week ASSU
President Angelina Cardona proposed that the
upcoming campus elections include what will es
sentially be a poll on the student body's opinion of the
ROTC debate.The "essentially" in that statement hides
a lot.
To do what CNN and Gallup do every day, but on a
smaller scale, Cardona has to wade through loads of ad
ministrative detritus. She had to author it, then send it
to be approved by a majority of both the Undergradu
ate Senate and the Graduate School Council, just to get
it on the ballot. Which all makes perfect sense procedu
rally for any measure that carries force, but not for
something that is essentially what Congress refers to as
a non-binding resolution. At least in Congress, these are
useless. Some notably insignificant examples: a 2007
resolution demanded withdrawal from Iraq, another
established National Pi Day and a third, a personal fa
vorite, articulated support for granting refugee status to
Haitian survivors of a 2008 hurricane. It didn't actually
make it legal for these refugees to enter the country, or
provide any resources for them, but at least we know
that Congress supports the idea ... in principle.
Furthermore, we're not convinced that the non
binding referendum (opinion poll) would even be an
accurate sample of the student body. Last year 5,804
votes were cast in the ASSU election across an under
graduate and graduate population of 20,838 a 28-
percent turnout. Freshmen and sophomores were vast
ly overrepresented, together accounting for 63 percent
of the undergraduate vote and 39 percent of the total
vote. All in all, not quite a representative sample.
More important, however, is whether this kind of
issue should ever be subject to public opinion. From
what we've heard of the debate so far, it seems that
those opposed to ROTC regaining access to campus see
it as an issue of rights, holding that while the repeal of
Don't Ask Don't Tell was enough of a liberalization to
warrant debate, the military's policy regarding trans
gender individuals is still discriminatory, which should
bar its return to campus. Simply put, they hold that the
equality rights of transgender people on Stanford cam
pus would be infringed by the return of ROTC.
The pro-ROTC camp has not used the language of
rights as persistently or as effectively, but its claims can
be framed in the perspective of rights just as legitimate
ly. Very simply this group is asking for the right to pur
sue a path of service in the United States Armed Ser
vices as part of its Stanford experience.
Temporarily put aside whether these rights claims
are legitimate and subsequently which violation would
be more significant: if we accept that this is an issue of
conflicting rights, we arrive at some interesting conclu
sions.
First: both groups are dealing with their on-campus
rights. Students can already be a part of ROTC at other
campuses a recent article in The Daily highlighted
several who are and the United States Armed Ser
vices bars service by transgender individuals. The out
come of our debate about ROTC's return to campus
won't change either of these facts, so let's drop the in

flated sense of grandeur and look at just the effects on
students on campus.
Second: both groups whose rights might be violated
depending on ROTC's fate on campus are small mi
norities. So any voting on the issue binding or other
wise is ostensibly the majority voting on the rights of
the minority. This should raise flags if you remember
the last civics course you took. One of the most basic
tenants of the American democratic system is that the
majority has no place in determining minority rights.
When there is a conflict between different groups'
rights, it is the role of a non-biased arbiter, or in our case
the Faculty Senate, to decide who has the more legiti
mate claim.
This question really doesn't affect most of us beyond
whatever impact ROTC would have on the campus
community as a whole a question about Stanford's
relationship to the ideals, values and culture of the
Armed Services, that is another issue altogether. It has
an undoubtedly huge impact, however, on those who
view the military's policy as invalidating their identity
and right to equality and those who are denied financial
support for their education and the right to begin a life
time of service to their country while at Stanford. The
rest of us have little at stake comparatively. So, instead
of putting the question to a campus-wide opinion poll
to which only 29 percent of the student body will re
spond, or drowning out any productive discussion with
protest and petitions, let's have a reasonable and civil
debate about the future of ROTC on our campus. Ulti
mately, we're not the ones who will or should
have the final say.

Those wishing to express formal or informal auxiliary
comments in support or opposition of the above motion
should post electronic mail to zhoberg@stanford.edu or
daveg4@stanford. edu.

If we accept that this is an
issue of equal rights, we
arrive at some interesting
conclusions
