# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Lesson of the week: gay people throw the best parties 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So on Saturday I went to San
Francisco for the San Francisco
Equality Awards, a banquet
event in which prominent figures in
the LGBT community are honored.
A staff member of Equality Califor
nia, the organization holding the
event, had read one of my columns,
and she liked it, so she offered me a
free ticket to the event. I, always a fan
of both free things and LGBT peo
ple, certainly obliged to attend the
banquet, which would be both free
and filled with LGBT folk. It was the
perfect combination.
The event was held at San Fran
cisco City Hall. Before you gradu
ate, my Stanford readers, you have
to visit San Francisco City Hall. It's
a gorgeous space. It's also a space
soaked in LGBT history Harvey
Milk, the first openly gay elected of
ficial in the country, was assassinat
ed in this building. The very room
where the dinner was held was

where the gay marriages happened
in 2005. Both events changed the
face of the fight for LGBT rights
forever. Hundreds of gay couples
had wed on the very steps I climbed
to get to my table. And I was lucky
enough to have dinner there. Just
the very thought overwhelmed me.
I admit I certainly wasn't accus
tomed to the finery. I rented a tuxe
do for the first time. (The invitation
stated that it was a "black tie" event.
For a while I thought I had to wear
a black tie, which I thought was kind
of weird. Fortunately, one of my res
idents corrected me before I made a
fool of myself.) I didn't have to
make my own drinks and imple
ment my Terra Happy-Hour
earned skill of pouring out a shot
(or two, usually two) by eye in
stead, waiters held trays with al
ready mixed drinks and glasses of
white wine, ready to be consumed
(which I did, heartily). The before

dinner cocktails also included hors
d'oeuvres I could not pronounce
and don't get me started on dinner.
I'll just say that it was certainly a
step up from the dining hall (sorry
Stern Dining). Afterward, there was
dessert and dancing, where, of
course, the DJ had to play Lady
Gaga. And after watching a room
full of lesbians sing to Katy Perry's
"California Gurls," I don't think I'll
be able to listen to that song the
same way ever again.
I also met many LGBT Stanford
alumni, from whom I learned that
apparently back in the day, 20 years
ago or so, there were less than 10
open LGBT people on campus. I
was glad to tell them we've certain
ly improved since then. (The saying
"Branner sucks" was prominent 20
years ago, as well.) It felt good to
connect with people like me. Over
all, it was a pretty amazing experi
ence. Yes, we are marginalized. We

can't get married either. But hell, we
can certainly throw a good party.
One of the people honored was
Victoria Kolakowski, the first open
ly transgender Superior Court
judge elected in the entire country
and who I am proud to say is the
judge representing my home coun
ty, Alameda County. She accepted
her award with grace she told us
how important it was for LGBT
people particularly transgender
people to hold positions of
power, to raise awareness, to be out.
When we do these things, people
notice. And when people notice,
there will be change. Don't just sit
there. Get out. Reach high. Take
risks. That's the only way we can get
anything done.
That moment, I told myself I was
going to do something important,
too something important enough
that both LGBT and the general
population are going to notice. It
was at that moment that I realized
that I didn't just want any job; I
wanted a job that helped LGBT
people, that would further our cause
and improve the lives of those who
will come after me. I realized that I
wanted to work for transgender
rights. Trans rights are decades be

hind lesbian and gay rights. Some
thing needs to be done. And I'm one
of those people who can do some
thing about it.
I know I have this column, that
I've got my writing. And one of the
pleasant surprises of this year is
how important this column has be
come, not only to me and my
friends, but to people outside of
Stanford, to transgender people
who are thirsting for literature that
reflects their experience. I can do
something with this. I've found what
I wanted to do no, it's not some
thing I want to do. It's something I
have to do. No matter what, it's
something I have to do. And no
body's going to stop me.

Cristopher has concluded that watching
elderly people dance to Lady Gaga is
the most adorable thing ever. E-mail
