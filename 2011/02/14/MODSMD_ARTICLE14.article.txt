## HUSKIES TAMED 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Two days after reaching triple-digit
points and setting the record for con
secutive Pac-10 victories, the Cardinal
found itself in unfamiliar territory as it
narrowly pulled away from a scrappy
Washington team on Saturday after
noon, managing to hold on for a 62-52
victory.

Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike led the struggling Stanford of
fense with 22 points, tying Washington
guard Kristi Kingma for the game lead.

Her sister, freshman forward Chiney
Ogwumike, had the best day from the
field, going 8-for-ll and scoring 21
points to go along with a game-high 10
rebounds.
Despite leading by only two points
late in the second half, the No. 3 Cardi
nal (22-2,13-0 Pac-10) capitalized on
free throws and second-chance oppor
tunities, bouncing back from 24 per
cent shooting in the first half to boost
its lead back into double digits. The
Cardinal's next-smallest margin of vic
tory to a conference opponent this sea
son came against Arizona State on Feb.
3, when it won by 18 in a 72-54 contest.
The Huskies (10-12, 5-8), who had
won three of their last four games, got
into serious foul trouble, committing
27 personals and losing four players to
foul-outs in the second half. Three

members of Washington's core
starting center Mackenize Argens,
starting forward Mollie Williams and
the Huskies' second-best scorer, center
Regina Rodgers (10.3 ppg) were
sent to the bench after less than 15 min
utes of total time on the court.
When asked how the game might
have ended without so many penalties,
Washington head coach Tia Jackson
didn't go so far as to say the Huskies
would have won.
"It's a mystery to everybody," she
said. "I don't know."
But the Huskies' trouble with the of
ficials certainly gave Stanford a boost
on a day it otherwise struggled to find
the basket. The Cardinal had 33 at
tempts at the free-throw line, where it
scored 23 points despite shooting at a
lower-than-normal 69.7 percent clip.
The team averages 75 percent shooting
from the line on the season, led by con
ference leader Jeanette Pohlen's 91 per
cent accuracy.
"Any time you give 33 free-throw at
tempts ... the fact that we kept it close
is by the grace of God," Jackson said.
Pohlen, a senior point guard and co
captain averaging 15.8 points per game,
didn't make much of an offensive differ
ence in Saturday's affair, going l-for-2
from the line and a miserable l-for-9
from the field, including 0-for-6 from
beyond the arc.
Nevertheless, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer gave Pohlen 28 min
utes of game time, citing her leadership
and defensive skills.
"We need Jeanette out there, peri
od," she said. "It doesn't matter if she's
l-for-90, she's out there, and she makes
a lot happen. She defends for us and she
has a very calming influence on every
one else."
The rest of the team struggled from
three-point land as well, going just 1 -for
-21. Senior forward Kayla Pedersen
who did manage to sink seven of her
eight free throws blanked on each of
her eight shots from range. She went 3-
for-13 from the field on a day when her
team shot just 36.5 percent.
Freshman guard Toni Kokenis
scored the lone three for the Cardinal
and played for 19 minutes, with Van-
Derveer frequently switching her out
for junior guard Lindy La√üocque, who
started the game.
Those back-and-forth substitutions
may have been an effort to respond to
Kingma, who went on an offensive
tear in the second half that left Maples
Pavilion in stunned silence more than
once. The junior point guard took
command of the Husky offense in the
second half when Stanford typical
ly pulls away in close games leading
every drive and doing most of the

Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike, above, shot 8-for-11 from the field with
21 points in an uncharacteristically close victory for the Card. The 10-point
spread was Stanford's tightest against any Pac-10 opponent this year.
work herself, dishing out just two as
sists while scoring 18 points. She
made five of her six three-point at
tempts, including a 25-foot bomb
that pulled Washington within 47-45
with just 6:11 to go.
It took until the 6:36 mark of the
second half for the Cardinal to score
its 46th point, a milestone it reached
at halftime against Washington State
on Thursday.
Nnemkadi Ogwumike wasn't
concerned with the poor shooting, es
pecially from the perimeter.
"We know what Jeanette is capa

ble of] we've seen her day in and day
out, and obviously Kayla gets the fire
going as well," she said. I have faith in
my guards, absolutely... this isn't
how they shoot, and I think everyone
knows that."
With the final road trip of the sea
son taking Stanford to Los Angeles
next weekend, VanDerveer is glad to
have the wake-up call.
"I like this a lot more [than a big
win]," she said. "It gets people's atten
tion about playing people a second
time, and I couldn't ask for a better
game to lead into our LA weekend."
Stanford faces USC on Friday at 7
p.m., and then travels to UCLA for a
match on Sunday at noon.
