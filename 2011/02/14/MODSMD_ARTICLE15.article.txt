# Card rebounds vs. UCI
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's vol
leyball team was on the verge of
dropping two straight home
matches for the first time in over a
year after a stunning 3-0 loss at the
hands of No. 12 UC-San Diego.
But with its back to the wall, the
Cardinal rallied from a 2-1 set
deficit and earned a weekend split
with a five-set victory over No. 8
UC-Irvine.
Freshman outside hitter Eric
Mochalski had another solid
game with six kills and a .455 hit
ting percentage, and junior libera
Erik Shoji had a typical, efficient
match with 12 digs. But the star of
the night for Stanford (9-3, 6-3
MPSF) was Brad Lawson.

The junior outside hitter from
Honolulu had a match-high 23
kills to go with a career-high 16
digs, neutralizing a very balanced
Anteater attack five UCI play
ers had at least 12 kills. Lawson hit
.442 with just four attack errors on
43 chances.
"I think it all boils down to
preparation," Lawson said. "I
spent a lot of time scouting
Irvine's attackers and also learned
from the mistakes I made against
UC-San Diego, which mainly in
cluded tentative serving and not
working to get my feet to the ball
when I was attacking.
"I even spent a little bit of time
watching the national champi
onship match from last year to
motivate myself and to see what

was going right for me in that
match, sol could transfer it over to
the match tonight," he said.
The match was extremely tight
throughout, though it didn't look
that way early. Stanford jumped
out to an 8-3 lead in the first set
and went on several more runs to
push the score to 14-6 on a Law
son kill. The Cardinal won the
first set as it continued to pull
away, 25-18.
But Irvine used several runs
early in the second set to get out to
a 10-5 lead and didn't look back as
it took game two, 25-20.
The third set would prove to be
a heartbreaker for the Card. The

game was very close with 10 ties,
and Irvine held a 20-17 lead be
fore two service aces from sopho
more outside hitter Jake Kneller
put Stanford up, 21-20, for the first
time since it led, 12-11.
After trading points, the score
was knotted up at 23-23 before
Irvine got a kill from junior out
side hitter Kevin Carroll to earn
its first set point at 24-23. Stanford
got some help from the officials
when Irvine's setter misplayed a
ball for a bad set to tie the score at
24, but another Carroll kill and an
attack error by senior outside hit-

victory helped the Card recover from a tough 3-0 loss against UCSD.
ter Spencer McLachlin put Irvine up
two games to one.
McLachlin struggled early in the
match, particularly in the third set,
when he had just one kill and a -.232
hitting percentage. But the Cardinal
captain stepped up with his team
trailing in the fourth set. After a kill
by Irvine's Cory Yoder knotted
things up at 8-8, McLachlin ripped a
kill off the block and didn't look
back, notching seven more kills in the
next 16 Stanford points, including
two consecutive kills to win the game
and push the match to a fifth set.
"We all have confidence in
Spencer's ability," said head coach
John Kosty. "Even if he may be play
ing poorly at times, we're very confi
dent that we're going to see the true
Spencer come through. And we did
in the last part of that match."
Irvine went up 2-0 in the fifth, but
by then, Stanford had regained its
lost momentum and used a four
point run with Mochalski serving be
fore putting the match away with a
Mochalski kill.
Saturday's match saw Lawson
square off with Irvine's Carson
Clark, one of the top outside hitters in
the country, but Lawson clearly got
the better of Clark with 23 kills to
Clark's 13 and a hitting percentage
over .300 points higher. But Irvine
senior Jordan DuFault, a two-time
All-American off to a slow start this
season, picked up the slack with 14
kills and a .414 hitting percentage.
Stanford overcame Irvine's depth
Saturday, but a plucky San Diego

squad shocked them on Friday.
The Cardinal never really threat
ened in the first set, and a five-point
Triton run put the game out of reach.
Game number two was much
closer but San Diego was red-hot
at the net and the game needed extra
points to decide the outcome. Stan
ford squandered two set points, and
the Tritons broke through on their
third match point to take the game,
30-28.
The loss seemed to break Stan
ford's resolve, as the Cardinal could
not find an answer for San Diego's at
tack. The Tritons hit an otherworldly
.477 as a team for the match Stan
ford hit .182.
"I think the biggest problems for
us were energy, preparation and real
ly just a lack of determination," Law
son said. "I think a lot of us went into
the match thinking that UC-San
Diego would just roll over, but like
we found out, every team is talented
in the MPSF this year."
The MPSF conference has had
every member ranked in the AVCA
top-i5 at some point this season, and
the top five teams all lost on Friday
night. Stanford is currently fourth in
the conference standings with plenty
of games to play.
"Like Coach Kosty said in our
meeting after the match [against
Irvine], we're at the point in the sea
son where it's either sink or swim,"
Lawson said. "And although we did
show tremendous heart on Saturday
night, from here on out we 're going to
have to play more consistent, focused
volleyball."
Next up is a trip to USC on Friday
night.

the country, but Lawson clearly got
the better of Clark with 23 kills to
Clark's 13 and a hitting percentage
over .300 points higher. But Irvine
senior Jordan DuFault, a two-time
All-American off to a slow start this
season, picked up the slack with 14
kills and a .414 hitting percentage.
Stanford overcame Irvine's depth
Saturday, but a plucky San Diego

squad shocked them on Friday.
The Cardinal never really threat
ened in the first set, and a five-point
Triton run put the game out of reach.
Game number two was much
closer but San Diego was red-hot
at the net and the game needed extra
points to decide the outcome. Stan
ford squandered two set points, and
the Tritons broke through on their
third match point to take the game,
30-28.
The loss seemed to break Stan
ford's resolve, as the Cardinal could
not find an answer for San Diego's at
tack. The Tritons hit an otherworldly
.477 as a team for the match Stan
ford hit .182.
"I think the biggest problems for
us were energy, preparation and real
ly just a lack of determination," Law
son said. "I think a lot of us went into
the match thinking that UC-San
Diego would just roll over, but like
we found out, every team is talented
in the MPSF this year."
The MPSF conference has had
every member ranked in the AVCA
top-i5 at some point this season, and
the top five teams all lost on Friday
night. Stanford is currently fourth in
the conference standings with plenty
of games to play.
"Like Coach Kosty said in our
meeting after the match [against
Irvine], we're at the point in the sea
son where it's either sink or swim,"
Lawson said. "And although we did
show tremendous heart on Saturday
night, from here on out we 're going to
have to play more consistent, focused
volleyball."
Next up is a trip to USC on Friday
night.

The No. 4 Stanford men's vol
leyball team was on the verge of
dropping two straight home
matches for the first time in over a
year after a stunning 3-0 loss at the
hands of No. 12 UC-San Diego.
But with its back to the wall, the
Cardinal rallied from a 2-1 set
deficit and earned a weekend split
with a five-set victory over No. 8
UC-Irvine.
Freshman outside hitter Eric
Mochalski had another solid
game with six kills and a .455 hit
ting percentage, and junior libera
Erik Shoji had a typical, efficient
match with 12 digs. But the star of
the night for Stanford (9-3, 6-3
MPSF) was Brad Lawson.

The junior outside hitter from
Honolulu had a match-high 23
kills to go with a career-high 16
digs, neutralizing a very balanced
Anteater attack five UCI play
ers had at least 12 kills. Lawson hit
.442 with just four attack errors on
43 chances.
"I think it all boils down to
preparation," Lawson said. "I
spent a lot of time scouting
Irvine's attackers and also learned
from the mistakes I made against
UC-San Diego, which mainly in
cluded tentative serving and not
working to get my feet to the ball
when I was attacking.
"I even spent a little bit of time
watching the national champi
onship match from last year to
motivate myself and to see what

was going right for me in that
match, sol could transfer it over to
the match tonight," he said.
The match was extremely tight
throughout, though it didn't look
that way early. Stanford jumped
out to an 8-3 lead in the first set
and went on several more runs to
push the score to 14-6 on a Law
son kill. The Cardinal won the
first set as it continued to pull
away, 25-18.
But Irvine used several runs
early in the second set to get out to
a 10-5 lead and didn't look back as
it took game two, 25-20.
The third set would prove to be
a heartbreaker for the Card. The

game was very close with 10 ties,
and Irvine held a 20-17 lead be
fore two service aces from sopho
more outside hitter Jake Kneller
put Stanford up, 21-20, for the first
time since it led, 12-11.
After trading points, the score
was knotted up at 23-23 before
Irvine got a kill from junior out
side hitter Kevin Carroll to earn
its first set point at 24-23. Stanford
got some help from the officials
when Irvine's setter misplayed a
ball for a bad set to tie the score at
24, but another Carroll kill and an
attack error by senior outside hit-

ter Spencer McLachlin put Irvine up
two games to one.
McLachlin struggled early in the
match, particularly in the third set,
when he had just one kill and a -.232
hitting percentage. But the Cardinal
captain stepped up with his team
trailing in the fourth set. After a kill
by Irvine's Cory Yoder knotted
things up at 8-8, McLachlin ripped a
kill off the block and didn't look
back, notching seven more kills in the
next 16 Stanford points, including
two consecutive kills to win the game
and push the match to a fifth set.
"We all have confidence in
Spencer's ability," said head coach
John Kosty. "Even if he may be play
ing poorly at times, we're very confi
dent that we're going to see the true
Spencer come through. And we did
in the last part of that match."
Irvine went up 2-0 in the fifth, but
by then, Stanford had regained its
lost momentum and used a four
