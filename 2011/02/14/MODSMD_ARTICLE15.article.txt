# Card rebounds vs. UCI
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's vol
leyball team was on the verge of
dropping two straight home
matches for the first time in over a
year after a stunning 3-0 loss at the
hands of No. 12 UC-San Diego.
But with its back to the wall, the
Cardinal rallied from a 2-1 set
deficit and earned a weekend split
with a five-set victory over No. 8
UC-Irvine.
Freshman outside hitter Eric
Mochalski had another solid
game with six kills and a .455 hit
ting percentage, and junior libera
Erik Shoji had a typical, efficient
match with 12 digs. But the star of
the night for Stanford (9-3, 6-3
MPSF) was Brad Lawson.

The junior outside hitter from
Honolulu had a match-high 23
kills to go with a career-high 16
digs, neutralizing a very balanced
Anteater attack five UCI play
ers had at least 12 kills. Lawson hit
.442 with just four attack errors on
43 chances.
"I think it all boils down to
preparation," Lawson said. "I
spent a lot of time scouting
Irvine's attackers and also learned
from the mistakes I made against
UC-San Diego, which mainly in
cluded tentative serving and not
working to get my feet to the ball
when I was attacking.
"I even spent a little bit of time
watching the national champi
onship match from last year to
motivate myself and to see what

was going right for me in that
match, sol could transfer it over to
the match tonight," he said.
The match was extremely tight
throughout, though it didn't look
that way early. Stanford jumped
out to an 8-3 lead in the first set
and went on several more runs to
push the score to 14-6 on a Law
son kill. The Cardinal won the
first set as it continued to pull
away, 25-18.
But Irvine used several runs
early in the second set to get out to
a 10-5 lead and didn't look back as
it took game two, 25-20.
The third set would prove to be
a heartbreaker for the Card. The

game was very close with 10 ties,
and Irvine held a 20-17 lead be
fore two service aces from sopho
more outside hitter Jake Kneller
put Stanford up, 21-20, for the first
time since it led, 12-11.
After trading points, the score
was knotted up at 23-23 before
Irvine got a kill from junior out
side hitter Kevin Carroll to earn
its first set point at 24-23. Stanford
got some help from the officials
when Irvine's setter misplayed a
ball for a bad set to tie the score at
24, but another Carroll kill and an
attack error by senior outside hit-
