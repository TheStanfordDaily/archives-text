Given a chance to complete
sweeps of the weekend and of
the season series against Wash
ington, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team failed to capitalize
as it fell to the Huskies on Satur
day evening. The usually de
fense-savvy Cardinal (13-11,6-7
Pac-10), which dealt the Huskies
(17-7, 9-4) their first Pac-10 loss
on Jan. 13, fell in an 87-76 deci
sion, giving up the most points it
has allowed to an opponent this
season.

Junior guard Jeremy Green
scored the first points of the
game on a jumper, but Washing
ton's senior forward Matthew
Bryan-Amaning would quickly
respond with a layup off a steal,
the first of many Cardinal
turnovers over the course of the
night.

"I thought [we] played well,"
said Stanford head coach John
ny Dawkins, despite the loss. "I
thought we turned it over a few
too many times, which led to
transition and easy opportuni
ties for them. And let's face it,
they're a very good basketball
team, and tonight we played
well."
Playing in front of a sellout
home crowd of 10,000, the
Huskies swiftly took control of
the game, though largely without
the contributions of standout
junior Isaiah Thomas, who
missed his first four attempts
from the three-point line. Bryan-
Amaning, senior guard Venoy
Overton and junior guard Scott
Suggs combined for 21 of Wash
ington's first-half points. Thomas
wouldn't remain scoreless for
long, however, coming alive in
the half's final 2:38 to score 14 off
four three-pointers and two foul
shots.
"He's a terrific player,"
Dawkins said. "He's one of the
best players in the conference,
