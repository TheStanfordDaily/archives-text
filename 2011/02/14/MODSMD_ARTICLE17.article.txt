## Green's 24 not enough in Seattle 
### CAROLINE CASELLI MANAGING EDITOR 
Given a chance to complete
sweeps of the weekend and of
the season series against Wash
ington, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team failed to capitalize
as it fell to the Huskies on Satur
day evening. The usually de
fense-savvy Cardinal (13-11,6-7
Pac-10), which dealt the Huskies
(17-7, 9-4) their first Pac-10 loss
on Jan. 13, fell in an 87-76 deci
sion, giving up the most points it
has allowed to an opponent this
season.

Junior guard Jeremy Green
scored the first points of the
game on a jumper, but Washing
ton's senior forward Matthew
Bryan-Amaning would quickly
respond with a layup off a steal,
the first of many Cardinal
turnovers over the course of the
night.

"I thought [we] played well,"
said Stanford head coach John
ny Dawkins, despite the loss. "I
thought we turned it over a few
too many times, which led to
transition and easy opportuni
ties for them. And let's face it,
they're a very good basketball
team, and tonight we played
well."
Playing in front of a sellout
home crowd of 10,000, the
Huskies swiftly took control of
the game, though largely without
the contributions of standout
junior Isaiah Thomas, who
missed his first four attempts
from the three-point line. Bryan-
Amaning, senior guard Venoy
Overton and junior guard Scott
Suggs combined for 21 of Wash
ington's first-half points. Thomas
wouldn't remain scoreless for
long, however, coming alive in
the half's final 2:38 to score 14 off
four three-pointers and two foul
shots.
"He's a terrific player,"
Dawkins said. "He's one of the
best players in the conference,

but also in the country. You're not really going to stop
Isaiah, you have to try to contain him as best you can."
Green carried the team both offensively and de
fensively on the half, leading the team with 12 points
and six rebounds. Freshman forward John Gage was
another bright spot for the offense, going 2-for-3 from
range for six points in his seven first-period minutes.
But despite the team's respectable 46.2-percent
shooting, Stanford's 10 turnovers combined with the
Huskies' eight three-pointers to give Washington a

48-31 halftime advantage.
"We got off to a late start a few times in the first half,
and that was difficult," Dawkins said. "We have to go to
counters, we need to go to our pressure releases more,
and we didn't really do that."
The Cardinal was more impressive in the second half
than the first, outscoring Washington 24-20, but the ef
fort was not enough to overcome the Huskies after the
lackluster first period. Stanford had a quick nine points,
including an Owens dunk and a Green three in the half's
opening minutes to bring the score within 12, but Wash
ington would turn around and widen the gap to 18.
"They made it hard for us to get into the offense, and
they turned defense into offense a number of times,"
Dawkins said.
The Huskies would take their largest lead of the
night, going 21 points up with 5:25 remaining before
Stanford with key contributions from its freshman
class staged a late-game comeback attempt. Gage hit
another three, followed by a layup and a jumper from
fellow freshman forward Anthony Brown. The Card
outscored the Huskies 11-2 in the game's final three min
utes, with six points from freshman guard Aaron Bright,
three from Brown and two from freshman forward Josh
Heustis.
Green earned his first career double-double, finish
ing with 24 points and 12 rebounds, his season and career
bests, respectively. Brown added 15 points on 5-for-8
shooting, and Owens had 12 points on 6-for-8 shooting.
Still, the Card looks to improve after the big loss.
"We've got to continue to get better," Dawkins con
cluded.
Four Washington players scored in double digits, led
by Thomas, who had 22 points on 6-for-12 shooting.
Bryan-Amaning had 15, Overton had 12 and freshman
guard CJ. Wilcox tallied 10.
Stanford will return to Maples Pavilion this weekend
for its final conference homestand. The Card will face
UCLA on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

Junior guard Jeremy Green, above, posted 24 points
and 12 rebounds for a double-double against
Washington. His efforts were not enough, however, to
stop the Huskies, who rolled past the Card 87-76.
