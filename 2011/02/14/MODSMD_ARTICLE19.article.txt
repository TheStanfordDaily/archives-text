# High hopes for Stanford baseball
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Today is a big day for many
Americans. It is a day in
which you think about
whom you love most, treas
ure them and celebrate
their existence.
No, I'm not talking about your
valentine, silly. I'm talking about your
favorite baseball team! Today is the
first official day of Spring Training, so
it is now baseball season! For hun
dreds of players it is a time to show
you belong on a Major League team
and for the fans of all 30 teams it is a
time of hope and irrational expec
tations. (Maybe only for 29 teams; the
Kansas City Royals mortgaged their
2011 season for the future.)
When I was deciding what to write
my column on this week, I figured I
could do something cheesy and dis
cuss the things I love most in sports,
since it is Valentine's Day and all.Then
I realized what I probably love most in
sports is that fresh-cut grass, sunshine
and optimism that comes with Spring
Training. (So we've been spoiled with
sunshine here in California all winter,
but the rest of the country hasn't been
so lucky.)
Even at Stanford, this week marks
the official start to the baseball season.
Sure, the team has been practicing for
quite awhile now but this week
end, the games begin.
After hauling in arguably the na

tion's top recruiting class two years in
a row now, this is one of Stanford's
most anticipated baseball teams in
years even more touted than the
2008 squad that went to the College
World Series. Depending on who is
doing the ranking, the Cardinal is
placed somewhere between 10th and
13th in most preseason polls, despite
a regional exit in last year's NCAA
tournament.
Offensively, freshman outfielder
Austin Wilson is being billed as the
top newcomer in the nation this year,
while sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, whose younger brother
Danny is a freshman on the team, has
been called a leading candidate to be
the No. 1 overall pick in the 2012
MLB draft. With those two cogs and
a cavalcade of other budding stars
such as sophomores Stephen Piscot
ty, Jake Stewart and Tyler Gaffney
and freshman Brian Ragira, the Car
dinal seems poised to score lots of
runs this season.
With all the hype surrounding the
program which was common
place in the 1980s through the early
2000s this is a big year for head
coach Mark Marquess to show he can
put a juggernaut of a team together
and not just a group of über-talented
recruits. Year-in and year-out, Stan
ford has just about as much talent as
any program in the country; whether
or not that talent translates into wins
depends on the season.
It won't be easy to meet, or ex

ceed, expectations this year. I am by
no means an expert of college base
ball scheduling, and I don't normally
like to go on the record with large,
sweeping claims. But I've got to think
that Stanford's schedule this year
must be one of the hardest in the his
tory of college baseball. The Cardi
nal's first three series of the year are
all against top-20 teams and all on the
road in different time zones (at Rice,
Vanderbilt and Texas). After that,
Stanford plays host to Michigan and
Long Beach State, neither of whom
are slouches. Then Stanford begins
play in the nation's toughest confer
ence, the Pac-10, which boasts six
teams in the preseason top-25.
To make matters more complicat
ed, Stanford has some question
marks with its pitching staff early on.
A few returning players are battling
injuries, and it remains to be seen how
highly-regarded freshmen like AJ.
Vanegas will perform. It will be inter
esting to see if and when Marquess
settles on a weekend rotation, as
there is a group of pitchers (senior
Danny Sandbrink, juniors Brett
Mooneyham, Jordan Pries, Brian Bu
sick and Scott Snodgress, sopho
mores Dean McArdle and Mark
Appel, and Vanegas) vying for the
three spots. (Note: Appel is expected
to be the team's closer, but could, po
tentially, see time in the rotation).
Having that kind of pitching
depth should be a great asset for a
team, so long as the pitchers know
their roles. To gain a rhythm, Mar
quess will want to solidify his rotation
early on.
Because of the hard schedule and
the week-to-week grind of the Pac-10,
a rocky start could spell doom for the

Cardinal. Conversely, a strong early
season could catapult the Cardinal
into the conversation of who the best
team in the nation is.
Either way, it doesn't matter how
you spend your Valentine's Day, be
cause you can remember it as the be
ginning of baseball season, and thus it
is great. And this weekend, when
Stanford takes the field at Rice, it will
officially begin for the Cardinal, and
we'll see if the team can live up to the
hype.

As he dreams about the upcoming
season, Dan Bohm can't help but no
tice that baseball diamonds are
vaguely heart-shaped. Also, dia
monds are a girl's best friend. Contin

Today is a big day for many
Americans. It is a day in
which you think about
whom you love most, treas
ure them and celebrate
their existence.
No, I'm not talking about your
valentine, silly. I'm talking about your
favorite baseball team! Today is the
first official day of Spring Training, so
it is now baseball season! For hun
dreds of players it is a time to show
you belong on a Major League team
and for the fans of all 30 teams it is a
time of hope and irrational expec
tations. (Maybe only for 29 teams; the
Kansas City Royals mortgaged their
2011 season for the future.)
When I was deciding what to write
my column on this week, I figured I
could do something cheesy and dis
cuss the things I love most in sports,
since it is Valentine's Day and all.Then
I realized what I probably love most in
sports is that fresh-cut grass, sunshine
and optimism that comes with Spring
Training. (So we've been spoiled with
sunshine here in California all winter,
but the rest of the country hasn't been
so lucky.)
Even at Stanford, this week marks
the official start to the baseball season.
Sure, the team has been practicing for
quite awhile now but this week
end, the games begin.
After hauling in arguably the na

tion's top recruiting class two years in
a row now, this is one of Stanford's
most anticipated baseball teams in
years even more touted than the
2008 squad that went to the College
World Series. Depending on who is
doing the ranking, the Cardinal is
placed somewhere between 10th and
13th in most preseason polls, despite
a regional exit in last year's NCAA
tournament.
Offensively, freshman outfielder
Austin Wilson is being billed as the
top newcomer in the nation this year,
while sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, whose younger brother
Danny is a freshman on the team, has
been called a leading candidate to be
the No. 1 overall pick in the 2012
MLB draft. With those two cogs and
a cavalcade of other budding stars
such as sophomores Stephen Piscot
ty, Jake Stewart and Tyler Gaffney
and freshman Brian Ragira, the Car
dinal seems poised to score lots of
runs this season.
With all the hype surrounding the
program which was common
place in the 1980s through the early
2000s this is a big year for head
coach Mark Marquess to show he can
put a juggernaut of a team together
and not just a group of über-talented
recruits. Year-in and year-out, Stan
ford has just about as much talent as
any program in the country; whether
or not that talent translates into wins
depends on the season.
It won't be easy to meet, or ex

ceed, expectations this year. I am by
no means an expert of college base
ball scheduling, and I don't normally
like to go on the record with large,
sweeping claims. But I've got to think
that Stanford's schedule this year
must be one of the hardest in the his
tory of college baseball. The Cardi
nal's first three series of the year are
all against top-20 teams and all on the
road in different time zones (at Rice,
Vanderbilt and Texas). After that,
Stanford plays host to Michigan and
Long Beach State, neither of whom
are slouches. Then Stanford begins
play in the nation's toughest confer
ence, the Pac-10, which boasts six
teams in the preseason top-25.
To make matters more complicat
ed, Stanford has some question
marks with its pitching staff early on.
A few returning players are battling
injuries, and it remains to be seen how
highly-regarded freshmen like AJ.
Vanegas will perform. It will be inter
esting to see if and when Marquess
settles on a weekend rotation, as
there is a group of pitchers (senior
Danny Sandbrink, juniors Brett
Mooneyham, Jordan Pries, Brian Bu
sick and Scott Snodgress, sopho
mores Dean McArdle and Mark
Appel, and Vanegas) vying for the
three spots. (Note: Appel is expected
to be the team's closer, but could, po
tentially, see time in the rotation).
Having that kind of pitching
depth should be a great asset for a
team, so long as the pitchers know
their roles. To gain a rhythm, Mar
quess will want to solidify his rotation
early on.
Because of the hard schedule and
the week-to-week grind of the Pac-10,
a rocky start could spell doom for the

Cardinal. Conversely, a strong early
season could catapult the Cardinal
into the conversation of who the best
team in the nation is.
Either way, it doesn't matter how
you spend your Valentine's Day, be
cause you can remember it as the be
ginning of baseball season, and thus it
is great. And this weekend, when
Stanford takes the field at Rice, it will
officially begin for the Cardinal, and
we'll see if the team can live up to the
hype.
