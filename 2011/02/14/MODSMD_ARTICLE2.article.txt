## Hennessy kicks off iDeclare 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
President John Hennessy and Rev
erend Scotty McLennan, dean of reli
gious life, led a discussion titled "Trans
lating Your Passions into Academia"
yesterday. The session kicked off iDe
clare Week, a newly established event
series designed to assist sophomores
with the major-declaration process.
The discourse led by Hennessy and
McLennan was a lively one, punctuated
with anecdotal accounts of their under
graduate careers.
Hennessy spoke about his long
standing passion for computer science.
He recounted the rewards of approach
ing computer science at a time when
the field was relatively new from an
electrical engineering background.
"I was interested in computers, but
[Villanova University] didn't have a
computer science major at the time,"
Hennessy said. "People interested in
computers either majored in applied
math or EE."
"When I went on to grad school to
study CS, most students came into that
class with a pure mathematics back
ground, which I was lacking," he added.
"It was a real scramble. There was an
other branch of mathematics I've never
had to do before, like group theory, and
I was excited to see if I could apply the
math concepts to computer science."
While Hennessy's academic inter
ests remained fairly constant, McLen
nan's undergraduate career was much
less linear, as his law school prospects
expanded to make room for his grow
ing interest in religion.
"I was trying to pursue a psychology
major and wanted to be a lawyer," he
said. "I was following my passions and
actually ended up being very interested
in religion. I ended up going to both di
vinity and law school."
McLennan acknowledged the diffi
culty that students face when con
fronting their parents with their deci
sion to pursue a "less-than-practical"
field of study.
"The parent piece can be hard," he
said. "I never forgot the day when my
dad said to me,'Oh, wait a minute, divin
ity school? I mean we're all religious,
but that's something you can do on the
side. Go get a real job!' I had to push
back on that a bit and show him my pas
sion for social justice."
Hennessy encouraged undergradu
ates to take academic risks while they
still can.
"You leant by doing," Hennessy
said,"[The undergraduate years] are a
time when you can afford to take risks.
It becomes much more difficult later
on, when you've already invested so
much time and money into a field you
want to switch out oi."
When one attendee asked about
what course students with multiple ac
ademic interests should follow,
McLennan strongly cautioned against
double majoring.
"To double major is to destroy the
concept of an undergraduate career,"
McLennan said. "That is, achieving
both breadth and depth in a particular
field. With a double major, you aren't
going to get the breadth and depth of
the two subjects."
President Hennessy agreed on this
point, adding that "overseas studies,
honors theses writing and independ
ently run research" truly make the un
dergrad experience worthwhile.
"Choosing a major is like going to a
dance," Hennessy said.'Tt's fun to have
a lot of partners to dance with but it's
nice to go home in the end with the
partner you're going to stick with."
