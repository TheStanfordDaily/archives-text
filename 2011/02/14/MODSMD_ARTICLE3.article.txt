# Dancing for awareness
## Dance Marathon proceeds will go to health program in Rwanda 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In what has become an annual tradition at
Stanford, more than 500 dancers, hackers,
moralers and observers packed into the Arrillaga
Alumni Center this weekend for the 24-hour
Dance Marathon. The event strove to raise AIDS
awareness and fundraise money to battle the dis
ease in Africa.
Though final fundraising figures were not pro
vided to The Daily by the time of publication,
Stephanie Morrison 'll, one of Dance
Marathon's co-directors, said in an interview with
The Daily on Saturday that she did not expect the
event to meet its goal of raising $lOO,OOO. The ex
pected drop from last year, when $178,000 was
raised, comes largely because FACE AIDS is no
longer matching Dance Marathon's contribu
tions.
"In the past, [FACE AIDS] has been able to
match, dollar for dollar, what our dancers raise,"
said Anand Habib 'll, another co-director. "Un
fortunately, this year they weren't able to do that.
We had to take on that extra burden of pushing
ourselves to really hit our goal."

As in years past, dancers pledged to raise $192
prior to the event. Ninety percent of Dance
Marathon's proceeds go to Partners in Health,
which will use the funds for a community health
workers' program in Rwanda. This represents a
change from previous Dance Marathons, where
the money raised went to a variety of Partners in
Health projects. The remaining 10 percent will go
to Bay Area Young Positives, which provides sup
port to HIV-positive young people.
"[Partners in Health] is taking the people who
are members of those communities, who know all
of those people who are being affected by
HIV/AIDS and utilizing them as employees of
their hospitals," Morrison said. "They identify the
community health workers, they cultivate that re
lationship and then they send those workers out
after they've trained them."
Morrison added that the $192 contribution
represents the amount of money required to train
one health worker and pay their salary for a year.
On the other side of the Alumni Center was
the "Hackathon," which is now in its third year.
Approximately 65 hackers worked on 15 projects,
mostly to benefit nonprofit organizations. Unlike
the dancers at Dance Marathon, the program
mers participating in the Hackathon didn't raise
money prior to the event rather, they partici
pated in projects ranging from biomedical re-

With a focus on dancing for a full 24 hours, Dance Marathon kept up the energy well into the night. An
estimated 90 percent of the dancers were freshmen, while upperclassmen worked in shifts to rally them.
search to helping recycle medical
supplies.
According to Sam King 'l2, one of
Hackathon's directors, the goal of the
event was twofold: to provide direct
services to worthy causes and to con
nect hackers to the possibilities for
public service in computer science.
King emphasized that, while
Hackathon and Dance Marathon
may seem to share little in common
other than a public service focus, the
connection between the two events
is very important.
"This is a 24-hour dance party, so
there's clearly a lot of energy in the
atmosphere," he said. "There's a lot
of cooperation with Dance
Marathon ... our sponsors all go
into the same account, so when an
organization sponsors us, they spon
sor Dance Marathon as a whole."
This year's Dance Marathon
turnout saw a significant decrease
from last year's numbers, which to
taled approximately 1,000 stu
dents. Morrison attributes this
drop to a renewed focus on keep
ing dancers at the marathon for the
full 24 hours. Previously, many
dancers would only stay for a short
time or not come at all.
Though having fewer dancers
makes it more difficult to raise
funds, Morrison explained that fo
cusing on retention served Dance
Marathon's goal of promoting
awareness of HIV/AIDS among
students.
"We wanted to have an event
with us symbolizing what people go
through with HIV/AIDS the

hardship of standing 24 hours," she
said. "Wanting to make sure our
dancers are here for the full 24
hours leans more toward the aware
ness side of things. It can be debated
which is more important , but I think
that this year it was very important
for us to make sure everyone was
fully engaged with the cause."
Habib explained that changes in
the registration process could also
be a factor in halving the number of
participants. In the past, student
only had to fill out a form when
they signed up for Dance
Marathon and had the option of
paying the $l5 registration fee
later. This year, they were required
to pay the fee upfront.
"We were working with a slight
ly tighter budget, so we didn't have
the luxury of separating the two ..
. that's probably the key factor in
why it's half of what it was last
year," Habib said.
"What we're doing today, over
the 24 hours, is an act of solidarity,"
he continued. "When you hit a criti
cal mass of people and you get that
much energy in the room, it's more
fun for everybody."
