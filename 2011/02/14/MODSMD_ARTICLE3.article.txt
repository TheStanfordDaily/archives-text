# Dancing for awareness
## Dance Marathon proceeds will go to health program in Rwanda 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In what has become an annual tradition at
Stanford, more than 500 dancers, hackers,
moralers and observers packed into the Arrillaga
Alumni Center this weekend for the 24-hour
Dance Marathon. The event strove to raise AIDS
awareness and fundraise money to battle the dis
ease in Africa.
Though final fundraising figures were not pro
vided to The Daily by the time of publication,
Stephanie Morrison 'll, one of Dance
Marathon's co-directors, said in an interview with
The Daily on Saturday that she did not expect the
event to meet its goal of raising $lOO,OOO. The ex
pected drop from last year, when $178,000 was
raised, comes largely because FACE AIDS is no
longer matching Dance Marathon's contribu
tions.
"In the past, [FACE AIDS] has been able to
match, dollar for dollar, what our dancers raise,"
said Anand Habib 'll, another co-director. "Un
fortunately, this year they weren't able to do that.
We had to take on that extra burden of pushing
ourselves to really hit our goal."

As in years past, dancers pledged to raise $192
prior to the event. Ninety percent of Dance
Marathon's proceeds go to Partners in Health,
which will use the funds for a community health
workers' program in Rwanda. This represents a
change from previous Dance Marathons, where
the money raised went to a variety of Partners in
Health projects. The remaining 10 percent will go
to Bay Area Young Positives, which provides sup
port to HIV-positive young people.
"[Partners in Health] is taking the people who
are members of those communities, who know all
of those people who are being affected by
HIV/AIDS and utilizing them as employees of
their hospitals," Morrison said. "They identify the
community health workers, they cultivate that re
lationship and then they send those workers out
after they've trained them."
Morrison added that the $192 contribution
represents the amount of money required to train
one health worker and pay their salary for a year.
On the other side of the Alumni Center was
the "Hackathon," which is now in its third year.
Approximately 65 hackers worked on 15 projects,
mostly to benefit nonprofit organizations. Unlike
the dancers at Dance Marathon, the program
mers participating in the Hackathon didn't raise
money prior to the event rather, they partici
pated in projects ranging from biomedical re-

With a focus on dancing for a full 24 hours, Dance Marathon kept up the energy well into the night. An
estimated 90 percent of the dancers were freshmen, while upperclassmen worked in shifts to rally them.
