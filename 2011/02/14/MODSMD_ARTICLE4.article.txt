## Student sees Egypt revolt firsthand University has limited contact with student in Cairo 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Egypt's political revolution has impacted the
Stanford community directly and indirectly as
events continue to unfold overseas.
According to University Registrar Tom Black,
there are no Stanford students "in active statuses
or in sponsored programs in Egypt." Students
who wish to study overseas outside of Stanford's
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) are re
quired to take a leave of absence, and the Univer
sity does not keep track of the whereabouts of
these students.
"On the one hand, technically, the student is
not a Stanford student," said BOSP director
Robert Sinclair. "If we know how to contact the
student, we would be, of course, interested in
doing so, but the primary responsibility lies with
those organizations that students are studying
with."
BOSP has dealt with crises in the past at sever
al of its campuses, such as the earthquake in San
tiago, Chile and the wildfires that threatened
Moscow last year. According to Sinclair, the pro
gram has "procedures that are executed immedi
ately" in the event of a crisis, but no such contin
gency plans exist for those who participate in non-
BOSP programs.
Currently, there is at least one Stanford stu
dent who is getting a close look as events unfold in
Egypt. Rachel Antonsen 'l2 took a leave of ab
sence between her junior and senior year and
studied at the University of Cairo through the
Center for Arabic Study Abroad, which is run by
the University of Texas at Austin. Her program
began in June 2010 and will continue through
May, under the condition that classes remain in
session.There is a possibility that these courses will
be canceled.
On Feb. 1, when a million protestors packed
into Tahrir Square in Cairo, Antonsen
ventured into the square.
"I found a peaceful, cooperative and
celebratory atmosphere with all social
strata of Egyptians present," she wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily.
She spoke with various protesters,
who asked her to communicate certain
messages to the American people.
"Tell people in America nobody
wants an Islamic government," Anton
sen said, relating her conversations with

numerous Egyptians. "Tell people in
America Muslims and Christians are
out here together. Tell people in Ameri
ca how civilized we are being; we are not
violent people."
"We know the difference between
American people and the American
government... ask them to speak out
against their government and support
what we are doing," she continued.
Antonsen added her own perspec
tive as well. In a subsequent Skype inter
view with The Daily, she said, "For me,
these [conversations] are much more
important than my daily life and deci
sion to evacuate from Cairo."
"My whole attitude toward political
participation is going to change," she

added. Antonsen evacuated to Jordan
on the evening of Feb. 5.
"I would say this was not as a result of
the protests which, as I mentioned, I
found safe, peaceful and thrilling," she
said. "Rather, it was because state-spon
sored media was circulating the idea that
foreign agitators were responsible for
the protests, and some ordinary folks
who are tired of disruption of daily life
believed these ideas and vented anger
on foreigners."
Antonsen's decision was prompted
by a friend's experience at a checkpoint.
"There was a kid, about fifteen, who
was super angry at [my friend] because
he'd gotten this impression from the
state media that foreigners has instigat-

Ed the protests," she said. "He was con
vinced that my friend was an Israeli,
even though he showed him his Ameri
can passport. He tried to ran off with his
passport, and then he tried to stab him."
Antonsen said that Arcadio
Morales, the residence dean for Stem,
Toyon, BOSP and off-campus under
graduates, contacted her on Feb. 4. He
checked to make sure she was safe, en
couraged her to register with the Amer
ican embassy and asked about her plans
for the near future. Apart from Morales,
Antonsen has not been in contact with
any other University official.

Antonsen and her fellow students in
Egypt struggle with the reliability of
news reports, as media in the region is

often politically biased.
Antonsen speculated that there was
"a power struggle" occurring in Egypt
because information was "so inconsis
tent." She also said she was unsure about
Egypt's future.
"The thing that everybody has al
ways been wondering this whole time is
that this movement is incredibly re
markable for the fact that it doesn't seem
to have a leadership, and it seems to be
relatively disorganized, except also very
effective somehow," Antonsen said.
"That works well if you're opposing
something, but how is it going to work?''
