## Student sees Egypt revolt firsthand University has limited contact with student in Cairo

Egypt's political revolution has impacted the
Stanford community directly and indirectly as
events continue to unfold overseas.
According to University Registrar Tom Black,
there are no Stanford students "in active statuses
or in sponsored programs in Egypt." Students
who wish to study overseas outside of Stanford's
Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) are re

these students.
"On the one hand, technically, the student is
not a Stanford student," said BOSP director
Robert Sinclair. "If we know how to contact the
student, we would be, of course, interested in
doing so, but the primary responsibility lies with
those organizations that students are studying
with."
BOSP has dealt with crises in the past at sever

tiago, Chile and the wildfires that threatened
Moscow last year. According to Sinclair, the pro
gram has "procedures that are executed immedi
ately" in the event of a crisis, but no such contin
gency plans exist for those who participate in non-
BOSP programs.
Currently, there is at least one Stanford stu

the University of Texas at Austin. Her program
began in June 2010 and will continue through
May, under the condition that classes remain in
session.There is a possibility that these courses will
be canceled.
