conference. The event featured
prominent neurobiologists, medita

control of their own well-being.
Carole Pertofsky, director of
wellness and health promotion serv

for organizing the event. She opened
Saturday's discussion with her col
league, Dr. Fred Luskin, director of
the Stanford Forgiveness Project.

neuropsychologist, delivered the
keynote speech. "Any kind of last
