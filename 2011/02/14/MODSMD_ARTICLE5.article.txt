# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Conference promotes student happiness 
### DANA EDWARDS STAFF WRITER 
A host of leading researchers and
campus luminaries presented at Sat
urday's Happiness Within Reach
conference. The event featured
prominent neurobiologists, medita
tion instructors, psychologists and
authors, who sought to educate at
tendees on the "science of happi
ness" and empower them to take
control of their own well-being.
Carole Pertofsky, director of
wellness and health promotion serv

ices at Vaden, was chiefly responsible
for organizing the event. She opened
Saturday's discussion with her col
league, Dr. Fred Luskin, director of
the Stanford Forgiveness Project.
"We live in a stressed out and
overwhelmed planet," Pertofsky said.
"We need to make a commitment to
healing ourselves and each other."
Luskin, who has conducted re
search internationally on the health
benefits of forgiveness and stress re
duction, emphasized the importance
of positive psychology, a field that
has gained popularity in the last

decade.
"If you focus on misery, you don't
lead a happy life," he said.
He proposed "how you feel in
Whole Foods" as a metric of happi
ness, quipping that if you're not over
joyed when surrounded by the abun
dance in the grocery store, you need
to work to become happier.
Dr. Rick Hanson, a renowned
neuropsychologist, delivered the
keynote speech. "Any kind of last
ing mental activity will leave traces

behind for better or for worse," Han
son said.
In light of this principle, he urged
people to "direct their attention skill
fully" in order to form the neural con
nections that lead to happiness. Hanson
added that, evolutionarily, happiness is
the natural state of the human brain
when a person is not threatened or ill.
In a panel discussion, Luskin
asked his fellow speakers what Stan
ford students could do to benefit
from happiness.
Dr. Kelly McGonigal, a Stanford
health psychologist, described the
importance of self-compassion. She
said self-compassion exercises have
been shown to increase success in
battling obesity, tobacco addiction
and procrastination.
"Each one of us needs to find
some unique, pro-social contribution
to the world to be happy," Luskin
said.
"It's one thing to understand all
these principles of well-being and sci
ence, it's another to embody the prin
ciples in your actions," echoed James

Baraz, a meditation instructor at
Spirit Rock.
Throughout the event, Pertofsky
sought to bring attention back to
Stanford students.
"Students at Stanford are the
focus of this conference," she said.
She was concerned that a great num
ber of students are overly stressed
and suffering from anxiety disorders.
Speaking on this topic, she cited the
"Stanford Duck Syndrome" as an ap
propriate metaphor.
"We don't just want to survive, we
want to thrive," Pertofsky said.
She noted that the psychological
health resources available to students
are directed only to those students in
serious crisis, thereby neglecting the
other 85 percent of the student popu
lation. Pertofsky is working, through
various campus venues, to start a
movement on positive psychology at
Stanford.
The presenters at Happiness
Within Reach agreed on the enor
mous importance of disseminating
knowledge on happiness and well
being.
"We need to teach our students
how to self-nurture," Pertofsky said.
