## Stanford HR taps David Jones as new head 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
David Jones, the associate vice
president for employee and manage
ment services, has been promoted to
vice president of human resources.
Jones will replace current head of
human resources Diane Peck, who
announced her decision to retire last
fall.
Prior to coming to Stanford in
2007, Jones worked at Catholic
Healthcare West, Harvard University,
Southern California Edison Co.,
Georgetown University, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons and Howard Uni
versity. Shortly after his promotion
was announced, Jones spoke with The
Daily about his upcoming job.

The Stanford Daily (TSD):How do
you plan to improve the services avail
able to Stanford staff members? What
have you done during your current
tenure to that effect?

David Jones (DJ):Well, first of all, I
think that continuing some of the pro
grams that began under Diane Peck
continuing and expanding our
leadership and management develop
ment program, focusing on employee
development will be cornerstones
of the things that I hope to work on.
Beyond that, I think that this kind of
leadership transition offers an oppor
tunity for reflection around future di
rection, so I hope to be meeting with
lots of people across the University to
hear about their hopes and dreams,
hearing about their concerns, hearing
about what's working, what's not
working. And because I serve the
community I don't serve myselfâ€”
my hope is that whatever we do will
support the mission of teaching and
research.

TSD:Has the recession had a signifi
cant impact on staff hiring and reten
tion? What plans are there for contin
uing to deal with its impacts?

DJ:In some ways it was negative
early on when we had to lay off 500
of our staff and that was a very
difficult decision to make since
that time, the University has been
performing much better. We have
seen greater grant money, we've had
some improvement in our budget
outlook and lots of talent around the
Bay Area is looking at Stanford as
their potential employer. We're
doing much better in terms of at least
attracting talent.
TSD:How will you continue to pro
mote diversity in hiring?
DJ:I think it's a really important
focus and I think it's imperative that
we always seek out the perspective of
a diverse staff as we look to address
the many issues that come our way
and we're stronger for doing that.
I'm going to continue the work of my
current boss. I think she's done a
