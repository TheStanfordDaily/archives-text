## LESSONS IN LOVE 
### HELEN ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
It may be true that all you need
is love. Still, your typical elite
university would probably
argue that you need a little (or
a lot) of math, chemistry and
philosophy thrown in as well. Do
minique Youkhehpaz'll learned this
lesson the hard way when she ap
plied to major in love through the In
dividually Designed Major program.
Love is a common aspiration for
most students, but it doesn't seem an
intuitive course of study. The idea
wedged its way into Youkhehpaz's
mind during the summer before her
sophomore year.
"I was thinking about the mean
ing of life, anticipating 'The Meaning
of Life' Sophomore College," she
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "I
was listening to the Beatles a lot. I re
alized that when I rephrased the
question, 'What is the meaning of
life?' to 'What makes life meaning
ful?' My answer was clear: love. I
knew I wanted to dedicate my life to
figuring out what it meant I decid
ed I want to study love as a means to
dedicating my life to learning how to
be love."
Even though she had a clear di
rection, implementing this plan
turned out to be more difficult than
she had anticipated.
"When I met with the head of the
IDM department, 1 was all but
laughed at when I stated that I want
ed to study love at Stanford," said
Youkhehpaz. "The woman I met
with told me not even to bother ap
plying; that I had no chance of being
accepted. I found it appalling that I
wasn't even encouraged to find away
for Stanford to accommodate or
somehow work with my interests; I
was flat out rejected."
After this discouraging experi
ence, Youkhehpaz turned to other
major options, floating from depart
ment to department. She tried inter
disciplinary studies in the humani

ties, but just as she was about to de
clare, the entire department was cut
for budgetary reasons. Then she
switched to feminist studies, but she
found that that it didn't offer her
enough flexibility. Finally, she ended
up in the anthropology department.
"Switching to anthropology, I had
to let go my ego's desire to graduate
from Stanford with the label 'Love
Studies,"' said Youkhehpaz. "Be
cause in the end, that's what it would
have been just a label. In their cur
rent state, Stanford's infrastructure
and departments have no way for me
or anyone to study love."
Still, she thinks that assimilating
the study of love into a more tradi
tional college curriculum would be
immensely beneficial.
"I think that if love were integrat
ed into academia, we would not feel
such a disjunction between our per
sonal and professional lives, and they
would not have to contradict each
other," she said.
In the world of education, the
emotional realm tends to take a
backseat. But this divide actually
makes very little sense, Youkhehpaz
argued.
"People dedicate their entire lives
for what they deem an academic
cause, becoming chemists, physicists,
sociologists, etc.," she said. "They
place an illusory barrier between
their personal life and academic/pro
fessional life. Perhaps they discover
some pioneering idea or technology
in their respective field. But at the
end of the day, they still have to come
home to their family or lack of fami
ly, however [dysfunctional]."
The practicality of an education in
love extends beyond the personal,
though, and into the global sphere.
"There is plenty of space in acade
mia to study what is wrong with the
world in psychology, sociology, in
ternational relations, economics,
earth systems, human biology,"
Youkhehpaz said. "We can easily ob
tain grants and enroll in classes to
study pain, suffering, violence, dis

ease and genocide. But what about
what is right with society? What
about studying love, and how its lack
or its miscommunication caus
es what we seem 'not to understand'
about society [like] violence, crime,
suffering?"
She consents that, at the moment,
love as a college major is probably
unrealistic.
"There simply aren't enough
classes explicitly related to love, or
professors with backgrounds in relat
ed subjects, for love to be studied in
an academic setting," she said. "For
now."
But she remains hopeful. She
thinks that if anything could serve as
"a point of entry for love in acade
mia," as she puts it, it is anthropology,
because of its immense breadth.
"Anthropology envelopes the
study of the entire world, the study of
the 'other,' of anything, really, tied to
a culture and a moment in time," said
Youkhehpaz.
Despite her claim that the formal

infrastructure to study love at Stan
ford doesn't exist, Youkhehpaz
seems to have had no dearth of love
related experiences that have fur
thered her education. She has stud
ied love unofficially by taking the
sophomore Introductory Seminar
'Love as a Force for Social Justice,'
'The Meaning of Life,' 'Value
science,' 'Liquid Flow,' 'lnterperson
al Relations,' 'Poetry' and' Beginning
Improvising.' In her extracurricular
life, she has participated in YES+

and is an active member of Project
Love.
And that's not even to mention
her experiences working on organic
farms and her six-month-long travels
through India, adventures that con
tributed significantly to her experi
ential knowledge of love. But
whether at school or far from home,
her personal mission to study love,
even in the face of academic opposi
tion, has changed her life.
"My life has turned upside down
and inside out," she said. "Love is the
driving force in all I that am and all
that I do."
