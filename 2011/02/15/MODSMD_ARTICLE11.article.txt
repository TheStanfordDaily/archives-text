## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Joshua Falk 
A study conducted by the Stan
ford Center on Longevity shows
that changes made to home envi
ronments result in weight loss for
obese children.
According to Dr. Thomas Robin
son, a professor in child health who

served as the lead author of the
study, 85 percent of the study partic
ipants reduced their weight by 10
percent or more after six months.
Drawing on the study's findings,
Robinson and his fellow re
searchers emphasized the impor
tance of using smaller dishes and
not eating while watching television
to combat obesity. They also en
couraged participants to substitute
junk food snacks with fruits and
vegetables.
To qualify for the study, children
had to be between eight and 12
years of age and qualify as obese ac
cording to standards set by the Cen
ter for Disease Control (CDC). One
hundred sixty families participated
in the study, which was hosted by
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
