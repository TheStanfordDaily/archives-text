## Romance IN THE Rain 
### SUZANNE STATHATOS 
There's something about
winter quarter: the air
chills, clouds loom, rain
showers and blankets bun
dle. Generally considered
the quarter of stress, the middle quarter is
typically characterized as a time when
Stanford students pile on the units, ac
tively seek out summer internships and
embrace quasi-hermit-like behavior.
Others, however, paint quite a differ
ent picture of campus life from January to
mid-Marc, deeming it a ten-week period
filled with romance and compassion. Fol
lowing the excitement of autumn quarter
and preceding the sunny jubilance of
spring quarter, many feel that despite the
cold, hearts may actually warm on the
Farm during this middle quarter. So the
question still stands: is winter quarter the
quarter of love, or is winter romance an
unfounded myth?
Human biology professor Anne Mur
ray, who teaches a Sophomore Introduc
tory Seminar entitled "Love as a Force of
Social Justice," encourages her students
to use kindness and compassion to help
others and enact change.
"I do believe in the power of love,"
Murray said. "People can use all the good
will and loving kindness that we can offer
because a lot of people are in very hard
situations."
Although it is offered only during
winter quarter, Murray's class pro
motes care and kindness through
out all seasons and quarters at A
Stanford.
"One of the goals of the fl
class is to provide students
with some knowledge of the
literature of love, as well as a
sense of the importance of
love as a key phenomenon
in creating community, _
connection and function- I /
al societies among hu- d

mans," she said.
Alongside biological, psychological,
religious and social perspectives of love,
Murray's seminar also discusses the kind
of love college students are most con
cerned with: romantic love, or eros. On
the subject of eros love at Stanford, Mur
ray has observed that relationships bud in
the winter but truly flourish in the spring.
"People get down in the dumps when
it's darker and there's not as much sun,"
she said. "In spring . . . people walk
around arm and arm, hand in hand.
[That] kind of eros love blossoms in the
spring, just as the blossoms come out."
Some students agree with Murray's
assessment that romance flourishes no
ticeably as the temperatures rise, citing
winter quarter as the time to settle down.
"I've noticed that a lot of relationships
start when the weather starts getting
nicer ... and spring starts in the
winter [quarter]," said
Pauline Santos 'l2, Cas
tano's Peer Health Educa
tor. "Wintertime is when m
people are looking for
companionship."
"In the fall, peo
pie are just
starting

to rekindle friendships ... [and] still get
ting back into the swing of school," Adri
an Fernandez 'll agreed. "Over the win
ter, people take heavy course loads, so
sometimes they want to just have some
thing more constant that can give them
support as opposed to something that
they can't rely on."
Additionally, Fernandez commented
on the "test" that occurs over the three
week break between fall and winter
quarter. If two people pass and the ro
mance persists despite the geo
graphic absence, the relation
-00 ship might move to the next
level.
\ "Sometimes you can tell
whether or not you like
somebody and whether or
J not they like you if you
maintain contact over winter
break," Fernandez explained.
With an abundance of cozy
chilly days and the unavoidable
j festivities of Valentine's
Day, it's not hard to detect
1 spells of romance on campus
/ in the winter. Carrie Levy 'll
remarked on the comfort of
cuddling, noting the content
ed feeling of "havfing]
someone to stay in with
on Friday night when
it's rainy outside."

With at least of quarter of Stan
ford life under their belts, students
may be less anxious about the beginning
of the school year and more familiar with
the students in their class, residences, ma
jors and student groups. Naturally, new
relationships may arise.
"People have settled into their re
spective niches," said Nathaniel Williams
'l3. "Once people are established ... I
think the potential to find a significant
other with similar interests is much better
than fall quarter or the Dionysian atmos
phere of spring quarter."
But, he notes, the flipside is also true.
"By winter quarter, the charm of being
here and living the Stanford lifestyle has
dimmed a bit," Williams said. "I think the
combination of the letdown of 10 uninter
rupted weeks of classes and stress and the
relatively stagnant social scene make rela
tionships seem much less appealing."
The busy nature of winter quarter can
also be non-conducive to relationships.
For the past two years, Eric Mefford, 'l2,
a Resident Assistant in Lantana, has
rowed on Stanford's crew team. As a re
sult, he described the winter as "very hec
tic" and "not conducive to romance."
"People don't have time," he said. "To
build a relationship, you need to put in a
lot of time and be willing to compromise
and experience another person's emo
tions. In winter quarter, people are usual
ly much more short tempered and fo
cused on what they need to do."
Amidst the fluttering flyers declaring
that "Love Sucks" and the Valentine's
Day serenades from various a cappella
groups, it still remains unclear whether
winter ultimately promotes relationships
on the Stanford campus any more than
the other quarters. However, one thing is
certain according to John Lu 'll.
"It's the season of cute things."
