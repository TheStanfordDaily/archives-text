## FRESHLY BAKED Candy is dandy... 
### Tim Moon 
Freshman year, I had my first
cavity. For 20 years, my robust
teeth had beaten off all attack
ers, bolstered by those yearly fluo
ride treatments that were always the
worst experiences of my year (with
all those flavors, it's incomprehensi
ble how none of them managed to
be tolerable). I have no idea why it
took me so long to get my first cavi
ty, or why I got one here despite my
dental hygiene habits being even
better than when I was a kid, but it
could be because of all the candy.
While my mom was far from
being an Amy Chua-style tiger
mother, she did keep me from eat
ing too much candy as a kid. For
most of lower school, my primary
source of candy was from the vend
ing machines at my parents' offices,
which I got to use every time I visit
ed them on school breaks to avoid
having to get a babysitter. I really
liked school breaks.
As I entered middle school and
high school, I became a little savvier
about getting my hands on candy,
asking my mom for a dollar "for the
Campus Shop" every other day or
so. Given that our Campus Shop
pretty much sold only pencils,
erasers and candy, I'm pretty sure
that my mom knew that her dollar
was going to support my candy
habit. Either that or she thought
that she'd raised a kid who lost his
school supplies daily.
I suppose that should have been
a warning sign, but completely mis
reading signs seems to be a habit of
mine, and with all the new freedom
I had in college, I could finally buy
(and eat) all the candy I wanted. If I
was picking up textbooks at the
bookstore, I'd add on a roll of Men
tos and a box of Mike and Ike's
those candy displays in the check
out lines are dangerous. If I hap
pened to be near Tressider, I'd pop
into TresEx and get a box of Dots.
One time, I even bought a five
pound bag of Haribo Gold Bears
from Amazon (the best gummy
bears, Black Forest and Trolli aren't
even close). That one might have
been a bit much.
Candy's delicious (except
licorice, which tastes like sadness),
and that's probably the biggest part
of why I like candy so much, but I
find myself liking it more and more
because of how much it reminds me
of being a kid again. Given that my
candy consumption was somewhat
limited when I was a kid, it's admit
tedly a strange connection to make,

but along with Lunchables and
desserts-masquerading-as-cereals
like Cookie Crisp and Oreo-Os,
candy always brings me back.
Having only a quarter and a half
to go before I graduate and enter
The Real World means I've got only
a quarter and a half left of being a
(really big) kid. I mean, sure, you
can go on about being "young at
heart" even as an adult and you can
still dress up at office Halloween
parties and you can bring your kid
to Chuck E. Cheese's and tell him to
flail about in the ball pit so that you
can jump in to "save him" and then
stay in there a bit to "cheer him up,"
but it's still not the same. Here, you
spend all your time with people
your own age, your main source of
stress comes from school and you
don't have to worry too much about
cooking or cleaning.
Most importantly, you can actu
ally act like a kid and get away with
it. We're all on our way to becoming
doctors, lawyers and business exec
utives, and Stanford's great for
preparing for those lives. But from a
(really big) kid's perspective, if you
want to view paradise, simply look
around and view it Stanford re
ally is like the best camp ever. I
never thought I'd be making friend
ship bracelets again, but that's what
I happily ended up doing with my
house just a couple of days ago, and
in a totally un-ironic way at that.
Have fun with things like these!
Dress up in costumes and eat, drink
and be merry with a whole house of
people at Special Dinners. You're
living with a whole mess of friends
get people together one night,
make popcorn, put on some scary
movies, whisper secrets in the dark
and do all that awesome sleepover
stuff that you loved as a kid. When
are you going to get these chances
again?

Oh, and eat more candy. Metab
olism's going to be slowing down
soon.

can jump in to "save him" and then
stay in there a bit to "cheer him up,"
but it's still not the same. Here, you
spend all your time with people
your own age, your main source of
stress comes from school and you
don't have to worry too much about
cooking or cleaning.
Most importantly, you can actu
ally act like a kid and get away with
it. We're all on our way to becoming
doctors, lawyers and business exec
utives, and Stanford's great for
preparing for those lives. But from a
(really big) kid's perspective, if you
want to view paradise, simply look
around and view it Stanford re
ally is like the best camp ever. I
never thought I'd be making friend
ship bracelets again, but that's what
I happily ended up doing with my
house just a couple of days ago, and
in a totally un-ironic way at that.
Have fun with things like these!
Dress up in costumes and eat, drink
and be merry with a whole house of
people at Special Dinners. You're
living with a whole mess of friends
get people together one night,
make popcorn, put on some scary
movies, whisper secrets in the dark
and do all that awesome sleepover
stuff that you loved as a kid. When
are you going to get these chances
again?

Oh, and eat more candy. Metab
olism's going to be slowing down
soon.

Tim needs to replenish his candy
stash. Help him out by letting him
