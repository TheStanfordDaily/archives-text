# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## Introverts Unite 
### Rachel Kolb 
To people who know me, saying
that I am an introvert comes as
no revelation. What might be
more surprising is how I struggle
with a measure of insecurity about
how my nature predisposes me for
real-world success. This past fall, I
stumbled across a 2003 article from
The Atlantic with one of the best def
initions of introversion that I've ever
read: introverts are people who find
other people tiring. The way we
recharge our batteries is by with
drawing into ourselves. I read this
description and just about whooped
in recognition. While I enjoy the
company of my friends, and while I
can be garrulous with my family, I
desperately need my daily dose of
alone time. I sometimes worry about
the degree to which I like being by
myself. After all, I'm at Stanford, sur
rounded by fascinating people, but
sometimes at the end of the day I
only want to clam up into my study
lair with a sign on the door that
reads, "Do not disturb."
To put it simply, too much social
interaction leaves me short-circuit
ed, yet Stanford is a place designed
for the open exchange that makes
academic innovation possible. I've
noticed a tension between my with
drawn, "studious" qualities and the
overall energy of the Stanford cam
pus. To be sure, private study is an es
sential part of being a Stanford stu
dent none of us would be here if
we didn't have the ability to retreat
into our own minds and focus. Yet in
terms of campus atmosphere, extro
version takes a dominant role. Out
side of the sometimes-daunting task
of speaking up in class, there is al
ways some colloquium or speaker
event to attend, or some student-run
activity, or some group-focused gath
ering to fill the leftover time. Come
interact ! all those neon flyers scream.
Come meet people and discover
something new\ Ours is an age of
continuous networking, an increas

ingly public sphere that offers less
and less space for self-reflection. In
many ways, it is an age not very con
ductive to introverts. And this ten
sion has made me ask: just what sort
of personality best fits into the aca
demic setting, or into any sort of
open discourse?
From a strictly school-based per
spective, I see two somewhat contra
dictory stereotypes at play. The first
encompasses the highly verbal peo
ple who, simply from their lack of in
hibition in sharing their opinions, gar
ner the most public attention. For me,
this "verbal vomit," so to speak, was
present even in high school, where I
remember a correlation between
teachers' favorites and the people
who said the most in class. These peo
ple were the ones more in line with
the extroverted mold, who had a
backwash of ideas that could domi
nate any conversation, sometimes
without regard for making sense. The
quieter students, the ones who mulled
over what they wanted to say but who
had to be prompted to say it, were
often less successful in defining the
mood of a class. Our world is a world
where the people who cannot keep
their ideas to themselves will tend to
dominate those who are more re
served do we not see this with po
litical lobbying, activist groups and
celebrities? What is more, our culture
tends to associate high verbal skills
with intelligence, when the attribute
in question might be no more than
sheer force of personality.
The second stereotype I imagine
in terms of the academic setting is
that of the bookworm. Being
"bookish" (if not quite "nerdy")
evokes visualizations of the classic
introvert. Granted, it might inspire
images of a stodgy Casaubon as
often as it does an obliging Cincin
natus, but nevertheless it fits well
with associations of deep thinking.
People respect, even romanticize,
individuals whose ideas are heavy

but whose words are few. If you
don't believe me, google John
Wayne. However, there are dangers
in this assumption just like there are
in allowing a single perspective to
dominate a conversation: how do
we really know that the man sitting
on that bench staring off into space
is probing unprecedented intellec
tual depths? He could just be bored.
From the flip side, how do we know
that someone is brilliant unless he
says something to prove it?
At this point, I'm tempted to
raise the question of which individ
ual can exercise the most influence
in the university setting, the social
magnet who always has an opinion,
or the more reticent, self-reflective
thinker. Of course, the answer is nei
ther. Both have their place, and true
innovative ideas require a mixture
of self-reflection and self-expres
sion. Introverts and extroverts can
be equally good at both, and so the
difference between these personali
ty traits seems to boil down to how
we process our thinking in a social
context. In the end, individual suc
cess may result from how well we
recognize and manage our natural
inclinations.
And, however charismatic an
image Stanford presents, I know that
I must be walking among some clos
et introverts. Go ahead, close that
door and breathe. Just don't forget to
come back out.

"introverts unite" is really an oxy
