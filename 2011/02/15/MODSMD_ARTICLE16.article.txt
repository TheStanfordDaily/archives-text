## "I know this is a stupid question, but.." â€“ The Problem of Women in the Classroom 
### Maya Kornberg '14 Daily Fellow 
I know this is stupid question, but.
.. " How many times have you
heard girls raise their hands in
class and open with this act of self
deprecation? Growing up, I heard
this a lot, and almost exclusively from
girls. It is a testament to the bigger
problem of negative gender stereo
typing and how it affects women's
self-esteem.
In her book, "Investigating Cul
ture," former Stanford professor
Carol Delaney writes, "Girls are so
cialized to talk differently than boys.
As a result, women's talk is more ten
tative and does not command the
same attention as men's speech."
These self-deprecating comments il
lustrate that women are less secure
and confident in their opinions.
Some examples that Delaney
gives are the rising intonation at the
end of sentences that are not ques
tions, tag questions such as, "that
looks okay, right?" and hedges such
as, "I kind of wanted to go." The
phrase "I know this is a stupid ques
tion, but..." is yet another example
of this, which demonstrates that lan
guage is very telling of women's so
cial positions and self-image.
This language mirrors the larger
problem of negative gender stereo
types. These gender stereotypes af
fect women so profoundly that they
perform less well and even learn in
formation less well. This is known as
negative stereotype threat, or a dis
ruptive concern, when facing a nega
tive stereotype, that one will be eval
uated on the basis of this stereotype.
Researchers at Indiana Universi
ty showed last year that women per

formed substantially worse on math
tests when they were subject to nega
tive stereotype threat. They also
showed that women were less capa
ble of learning new math concepts
and retrieving those that they had
learned from memory when under
stereotype threat. Professors Rydell
and Boucher write that stereotype
threat "leads to increased arousal, re
duced working memory capacity, and
increased emotional suppression, all
of which harm performance in the
negatively stereotyped domain."
For many women, math has a neg
ative connotation, and we have seen
time and time again that they are told
that their place lies in the humanities.
This stereotyping obviously affects
women's ambitions, performance
and confidence in their own abilities.
It can even cause them to exhibit
doubt in the way that they speak.
But does this problem exist here
at Stanford? Women make up half of
Stanford's student body, and they are
undoubtedly an intelligent and ambi
tious group. So does this gender
stereotyping affect Stanford's pro
gressive and successful campus?
The extent to which women at
Stanford are stereotyped in different
situations is debatable. Although
some may argue that sexism in the
classroom is no longer a problem on
progressive modern American cam
puses, there is no doubt that women
in college continue to feel less com
fortable sharing their opinions in
class than college-aged men, even if
the extent varies.
Professor Delaney notes in her
book that, "at college, it has been no
ticed that men tend to dominate
classroom discussions or perhaps
professors tend to pay more atten
tion to them."
It is true that since it first began at
the beginning of the 20th century, the
feminist movement has made huge
strides in the United States. Women
today are at an exponentially better
starting point for their careers than
their grandmothers were. I am also
aware that there is a good deal of
criticism attached to modern femi
nism. Feminists are often termed
"man haters," called ugly and ac
cused of using sexism as an excuse
for every imperfection in their lives.
Still, I argue that sexist stereotyping,
however subtle a form it takes today,
is a problem for the self-esteem of
women and subsequent success of
women internationally, including at
Stanford.
I am by no means arguing that all
inequalities in a classroom discus
sion boil down to gender, or that
every classroom and every female
student fails at her goals only be-

cause of these stereotypes. Instead, I
accept that Stanford is generally an
open and positive community, while
urging students to keep the sub
tleties of gender role stereotyping in
mind as they navigate through Stan
ford classrooms.
The war against stereotypes be
gins with those individuals threat
ened by them: in this case, women.
The answer lies in creating a strong
self-image and finding self-confi
dence despite these stereotypes. The
answer is to create an identity inde
pendent of that which society forces
upon us. I used to be apprehensive
about raising my hand in class and
started my questions with "I know
this is a stupid question, but..."
Today I choose to combat the ever
present gender stereotyping, and
raise my hand with confidence.

Professor Delaney notes in her
book that, "at college, it has been no
ticed that men tend to dominate
classroom discussions or perhaps
professors tend to pay more atten
tion to them."
It is true that since it first began at
the beginning of the 20th century, the
feminist movement has made huge
strides in the United States. Women
today are at an exponentially better
starting point for their careers than
their grandmothers were. I am also
aware that there is a good deal of
criticism attached to modern femi
nism. Feminists are often termed
"man haters," called ugly and ac
cused of using sexism as an excuse
for every imperfection in their lives.
Still, I argue that sexist stereotyping,
however subtle a form it takes today,
is a problem for the self-esteem of
women and subsequent success of
women internationally, including at
Stanford.
I am by no means arguing that all
inequalities in a classroom discus
sion boil down to gender, or that
every classroom and every female
student fails at her goals only be-

cause of these stereotypes. Instead, I
accept that Stanford is generally an
open and positive community, while
urging students to keep the sub
tleties of gender role stereotyping in
mind as they navigate through Stan
ford classrooms.
The war against stereotypes be
gins with those individuals threat
ened by them: in this case, women.
The answer lies in creating a strong
self-image and finding self-confi
dence despite these stereotypes. The
answer is to create an identity inde
pendent of that which society forces
upon us. I used to be apprehensive
about raising my hand in class and
started my questions with "I know
this is a stupid question, but..."
Today I choose to combat the ever
present gender stereotyping, and
raise my hand with confidence.

Sexual stereotyping is
a problem for the self
esteem of women
