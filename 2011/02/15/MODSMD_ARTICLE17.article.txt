## Open Letter to Political Leaders and the University Community 
### 
Martin Luther King Day and the recent shooting in
Tucson call us to consider how we each contribute
to peaceful political dialog in the U.S. It appears
that both shootings were the work of isolated individuals.
Nevertheless, all spiritual traditions affirm that our own
speech and actions can powerfully affect others for good
or evil.
Every politician and political commentator holds a
special trust for the welfare of all people, not just their
supporters. We especially invite our political leaders and
commentators to be mindful of how they help shape the
political dialog in the U.S. Specifically:
I.To hold in your hearts even those who oppose you.
Every person has valid hopes and fears, and you can sin
cerely wish them well even while opposing their policies.
2.T0 avoid inciting fear and hatred in your listeners by
avoiding suggestions that your opponents are less hon
est, less intelligent, or less patriotic.
3. To spend time framing the issues not just as us/them
and win/lose, but considering the possibility of win/win.
We realize that tactics which attack the honesty, intel
ligence, or patriotism of opponents often sway people in
the short term. But every religion calls us to value the
long term, where such tactics are corrosive to the well

being and trust of all people in the nation.
"We can contribute to the global community by treat
ing our opponents with compassion, or diminish hope by
dehumanizing our enemies. United, we can make any
dream a reality."
We call on the university community to aid positive po
litical dialog in the U.S. Many here have deep knowledge
of how to improve effective communication, increase em
pathic listening and compassion, nurture win/win negotia
tion, and build community. We encourage you to apply
that knowledge to this high cause.
In the words of Dr. King, "We must build dikes of
courage to hold back the flood of fear... Peace is not
merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which
we arrive at that goal."
