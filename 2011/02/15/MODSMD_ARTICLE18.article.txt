nastics team set off for a week
end of tough competition and
walked away with two more
wins and the best start in team
history.
On Friday, No. 2 Stanford
(13-0) joined No. 10 UCLA and
No. 6 Oregon State in the IGI
Chicago Style Invitational. As
the meet progressed, it looked
like the Bruins were going to
take the victory, as they placed
first on the vault, bars and beam.
Stanford's 49.150 trailed behind
the Bruins' team score of 49.200
on the vault, while Oregon State
picked up third with a 49.075.

Stanford taking second on the
bars and Oregon State taking
third, changing only when the
Card managed to tie UCLA for
first on the beam with score of
48.975.

when Oregon State took its first
win on the floor, with Stanford
trailing behind in second and
UCLA in third with a 48.850,

team's score down significantly.
After the battle ended, Stanford
ended up on top with a mark of
196.475. Oregon State took sec
