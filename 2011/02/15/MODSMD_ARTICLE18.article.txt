The Cardinal women's gym
nastics team set off for a week
end of tough competition and
walked away with two more
wins and the best start in team
history.
On Friday, No. 2 Stanford
(13-0) joined No. 10 UCLA and
No. 6 Oregon State in the IGI
Chicago Style Invitational. As
the meet progressed, it looked
like the Bruins were going to
take the victory, as they placed
first on the vault, bars and beam.
Stanford's 49.150 trailed behind
the Bruins' team score of 49.200
on the vault, while Oregon State
picked up third with a 49.075.
The pattern continued with
Stanford taking second on the
bars and Oregon State taking
third, changing only when the
Card managed to tie UCLA for
first on the beam with score of
48.975.
The Bruins' streak ended
when Oregon State took its first
win on the floor, with Stanford
trailing behind in second and
UCLA in third with a 48.850,
which fell below the leading
score of 49.225. The Bruins suf
fered three out-of-bounds de
ductions, which brought the
team's score down significantly.
After the battle ended, Stanford
ended up on top with a mark of
196.475. Oregon State took sec
ond overall with a 196.350, and
UCLA, despite three event wins,
took a very narrow third place
with a 196.300.
Although Stanford as a team
only placed first in one of the
events (the beam), the team's
performance at the invitational
included several individual first
places. Senior Shelley Alexander
placed first in the all-around
with a 39.375 as well as first on
the floor with a 9.900, redshirt

streak further as it beat both No.

taking third on the vault, but
continued to work its way up,

individual firsts were few for Stan

beam with a 9.900, and Morgan
again left the meet with a 9.900 and

victory on the floor. Stanford junior
Alyssa Brown earned her season
and career-best score of 9.900 on
the bars, as well as her season best
on the vault, also with a 9.900.
Sophomore Nicole Dayton also
walked away with a season- and ca

score of 9.850 on the vault. A fresh
man competitor for the Card,
