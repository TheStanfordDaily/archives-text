# Which college should you root for?
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Sports allegiances are rigid.
This is nothing new. But in a
university setting where
ideas of "change" are em
phasized across disciplines,
the intractable nature of fandom is an
aberration.
What's more: these loyalties are,
for the most part, dictated. There's a
remarkable lack of autonomy. Most
avid sports fans grow up rooting for a
particular team in a specific sport, and
while they can identify why they fol
low that club "my father's father's
father had season tickets," etc. it's
hard to pick out a specific moment
when they decided to become parti
san to that squad.
It's often not a choice, and it's pre
dominantly zero-sum. From just
about the moment I was born, my
aunt and my grandfather wrestled for
my allegiances. She backed the Yan
kees, Knicks and Giants; he followed
the Mets, Nets and Jets. They knew
that within each sport, only one team
could reign supreme. At some point
well before my first memories
my grandfather conceded on all
fronts. The "decision" was reflected
immediately: my baby pictures fea
ture a striking number of pinstripes.
Seven championships later, I don't
fault the choice, but my role in it was
decisively minimal.
We're born this way (hat tip: Gaga)
and little can change that.There are al
ways exceptions to the rule discov
ering a new sport later in life, for in
stance. The most predominant one is,
at the relatively old age of 18, pledging
loyalty to your university's athletics
teams. At Stanford, just days after ma
triculation, the new freshman class is
taken to its first football game. It's one
of the best environments of the year
thousands of newly initiated Cardi
nal devotees get their first Stanford
sports experience. And it's memo
rable, to say the least: days after the
2007 NSO game, I would meet one of
my now-close friends by approaching
him and (awkwardly, I assure you) say
ing,"You were one of those dudes with
an'S' on your chest in the front row.
Awesome." It didn't matter that Ore
gon outscored us 31-0 in the second
half during the actual contest, because
the game was the beginning of a collec
tive bond over Cardinal athletics.
There's just one problem. Many of
us come to the Farm with existing alle

giances to other big collegiate pro
grams. This may not be as much of an
issue for our friends at liberal arts
schools playing at the Division 111
level, but what happens when the
team you grew up supporting plays
the school you're currently attend
ing? This can be a particularly unap
pealing issue at Stanford. Most of the
student body did not grow up as Car
dinal diehards. A significant portion
of undergraduates comes from the
Los Angeles area, which can often
mean loyalties to UCLA or, more
often, USC. We count among us fans
of schools from all the major confer
ences, and with 35 Stanford teams
playing games across the country, it is
inevitable that loyalties will be tested.
My childhood school was/is Michi
gan. Shawn Crable's personal foul on
Troy Smith (look it up) is still, regret
tably, seared into my memory. Charles
Woodson, Steve Breaston and
LaMarr Woodley were my childhood
heroes, not Troy Walters or Tank
Williams. Fortunately, Michigan and
Stanford rarely compete. The Cardi
nal and the Wolverines have butted
heads this year, for example, in
women's water polo and gymnastics,

and will go at it in baseball in March,
but other contests are few and far be
tween.

But that doesn't end the question
who do you choose? and it
manifested itself differently last
month. Both Michigan and Stanford
were competing for Jim Harbaugh's
services; if he left for Ann Arbor, how
would I feel? I never hashed out a
good answer and, fortunately, didn't

need to. But, my example aside, com
peting college sports allegiances are
difficult (if not unknown) territory for
the average fan. Athletics loyalties are
not malleable, so how do you recon
cile? There isn't a one-size-fits-all re
sponse. I know that my dedication to
Michigan has waned over my four
years at Stanford; if they met in the
BCS title game, I'd be pulling hard
for the Cardinal. At the same time,
I have friends who grew up as Stan
ford fans, only to attend other Pac-10
schools and refuse to change their
rooting interests. There's a broad
spectrum of answers.
Ultimately, it's hard to judge. Un
less their team owner is Dan Snyder,
fans of professional sports franchis
es who switch teams or pick up a sec
ond squad later in life (that they feel
equally passionate about) will al
ways raise eyebrows. But the moti
vations at the collegiate level are
easier to calibrate, and, roundabout
as it may seem, that makes it more
difficult to act definitively one way
or another.
Unless you grew up a Golden
Bear. Then you have to choose.

who do you choose? and it
manifested itself differently last
month. Both Michigan and Stanford
were competing for Jim Harbaugh's
services; if he left for Ann Arbor, how
would I feel? I never hashed out a
good answer and, fortunately, didn't

need to. But, my example aside, com
peting college sports allegiances are
difficult (if not unknown) territory for
the average fan. Athletics loyalties are
not malleable, so how do you recon
cile? There isn't a one-size-fits-all re
sponse. I know that my dedication to
Michigan has waned over my four
years at Stanford; if they met in the
BCS title game, I'd be pulling hard
for the Cardinal. At the same time,
I have friends who grew up as Stan
ford fans, only to attend other Pac-10
schools and refuse to change their
rooting interests. There's a broad
spectrum of answers.
Ultimately, it's hard to judge. Un

fans of professional sports franchis

easier to calibrate, and, roundabout
as it may seem, that makes it more

Sports allegiances are rigid.
This is nothing new. But in a
university setting where
ideas of "change" are em
phasized across disciplines,
the intractable nature of fandom is an
aberration.
What's more: these loyalties are,
for the most part, dictated. There's a
remarkable lack of autonomy. Most
avid sports fans grow up rooting for a
particular team in a specific sport, and
while they can identify why they fol
low that club "my father's father's
father had season tickets," etc. it's
hard to pick out a specific moment
when they decided to become parti
san to that squad.
It's often not a choice, and it's pre
dominantly zero-sum. From just
about the moment I was born, my
aunt and my grandfather wrestled for
my allegiances. She backed the Yan
kees, Knicks and Giants; he followed
the Mets, Nets and Jets. They knew
that within each sport, only one team
could reign supreme. At some point
well before my first memories
my grandfather conceded on all
fronts. The "decision" was reflected
immediately: my baby pictures fea
ture a striking number of pinstripes.
Seven championships later, I don't
fault the choice, but my role in it was
decisively minimal.
We're born this way (hat tip: Gaga)
and little can change that.There are al
ways exceptions to the rule discov
ering a new sport later in life, for in
stance. The most predominant one is,
at the relatively old age of 18, pledging
loyalty to your university's athletics
teams. At Stanford, just days after ma
triculation, the new freshman class is
taken to its first football game. It's one
of the best environments of the year
thousands of newly initiated Cardi
nal devotees get their first Stanford
sports experience. And it's memo
rable, to say the least: days after the
2007 NSO game, I would meet one of
my now-close friends by approaching
him and (awkwardly, I assure you) say
ing,"You were one of those dudes with
an'S' on your chest in the front row.
Awesome." It didn't matter that Ore
gon outscored us 31-0 in the second
half during the actual contest, because
the game was the beginning of a collec
tive bond over Cardinal athletics.
There's just one problem. Many of
us come to the Farm with existing alle

giances to other big collegiate pro
grams. This may not be as much of an
issue for our friends at liberal arts
schools playing at the Division 111
level, but what happens when the
team you grew up supporting plays
the school you're currently attend
ing? This can be a particularly unap
pealing issue at Stanford. Most of the
student body did not grow up as Car
dinal diehards. A significant portion
of undergraduates comes from the
Los Angeles area, which can often
mean loyalties to UCLA or, more
often, USC. We count among us fans
of schools from all the major confer
ences, and with 35 Stanford teams
playing games across the country, it is
inevitable that loyalties will be tested.
My childhood school was/is Michi
gan. Shawn Crable's personal foul on
Troy Smith (look it up) is still, regret
tably, seared into my memory. Charles
Woodson, Steve Breaston and
LaMarr Woodley were my childhood
heroes, not Troy Walters or Tank
Williams. Fortunately, Michigan and
Stanford rarely compete. The Cardi
nal and the Wolverines have butted
heads this year, for example, in
women's water polo and gymnastics,

and will go at it in baseball in March,
but other contests are few and far be
tween.
