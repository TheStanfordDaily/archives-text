# Which college should you root for?

Sports allegiances are rigid.
This is nothing new. But in a
university setting where
ideas of "change" are em
phasized across disciplines,
the intractable nature of fandom is an
aberration.
What's more: these loyalties are,
for the most part, dictated. There's a
remarkable lack of autonomy. Most
avid sports fans grow up rooting for a
particular team in a specific sport, and
while they can identify why they fol
low that club "my father's father's
father had season tickets," etc. it's
hard to pick out a specific moment
when they decided to become parti
san to that squad.
It's often not a choice, and it's pre
dominantly zero-sum. From just
about the moment I was born, my
aunt and my grandfather wrestled for
my allegiances. She backed the Yan
kees, Knicks and Giants; he followed
the Mets, Nets and Jets. They knew
that within each sport, only one team
could reign supreme. At some point
well before my first memories
my grandfather conceded on all
fronts. The "decision" was reflected
immediately: my baby pictures fea
ture a striking number of pinstripes.
Seven championships later, I don't
fault the choice, but my role in it was
decisively minimal.
We're born this way (hat tip: Gaga)
and little can change that.There are al
ways exceptions to the rule discov
ering a new sport later in life, for in
stance. The most predominant one is,
at the relatively old age of 18, pledging
loyalty to your university's athletics
teams. At Stanford, just days after ma
triculation, the new freshman class is
taken to its first football game. It's one
of the best environments of the year
thousands of newly initiated Cardi
nal devotees get their first Stanford
sports experience. And it's memo
rable, to say the least: days after the
2007 NSO game, I would meet one of
my now-close friends by approaching
him and (awkwardly, I assure you) say
ing,"You were one of those dudes with
an'S' on your chest in the front row.
Awesome." It didn't matter that Ore
gon outscored us 31-0 in the second
half during the actual contest, because
the game was the beginning of a collec
tive bond over Cardinal athletics.
There's just one problem. Many of
us come to the Farm with existing alle
