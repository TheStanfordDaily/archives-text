## Wrestling ends regular season with a pair of upsets 
### â€“ Nate Adams 
Two days after defying expecta
tions in a 21-15 victory over then-
No. 17 Cal Poly, Stanford wrestling
wrapped up its regular season with
another upset on Sunday, defeating
then-No. 12 Arizona State by a
score of 28-11 on the Cardinal's an
nual Senior Day. With the pair of
wins, Stanford (9-9-1) finishes the
Pac-10 dual-match season at 4-2
and has plenty of momentum lead
ing up to the Pac-10 Champi
onships later this month. The Sun
Devils (5-11), meanwhile, dropped
to a disappointing 1-3 in confer
ence duals.
About 1,000 fans were on hand
in Burnham Pavilion for the begin
ning of the match, when a brief cer
emony was held in honor of Stan
ford's graduating senior class
Lucas Espericueta, Zack Giesen,
Justin Paulsen and Dylan Rush
which competed in its final home
match in Cardinal jerseys.
Redshirt freshman Jordan Gray
got things started for Stanford at
141 pounds, posting a 10-5 win over
ASU's Josh Sandoval. Gray had
four takedowns in the victory, his
eighth win of the season.
Stanford kept the pressure on as
true freshman Donovan Halpin
won a 14-3 decision over Carlos
Castro at 149 pounds. Following
that match, redshirt freshman Kyle
Meyer and junior Nick
Amuchastegui the No. 6
wrestler in his weight class in the
nation won matches by forfeit
at 157 and 174 pounds, respective
ly. That put the Stanford lead at 19-
3.
The Sun Devils got a big boost
from Anthony Robles at 125
pounds, who overwhelmed red
shirt sophomore Matt Sencen
baugh in an 18-1 technical fall.
Robles, a redshirt senior, is the na
tion's top-ranked wrestler in his
weight class.
Even with the late spark, it was
too little, too late for ASU, as Stan
ford closed out the match with sen
ior Justin Paulsen's 8-2 win over
Kalin Goodsite at 133 pounds.

Stanford now has two weeks to
prepare for the Pac-10 Conference
Championships, where top-per
forming teams can earn berths in
the NCAA Tournament. The
championships are set for Feb. 27
at Oregon State University.
