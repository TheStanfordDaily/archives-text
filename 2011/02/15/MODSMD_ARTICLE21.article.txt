## No. 8 Stanford wins in Berkeley 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday afternoon at
Cal's Hellman Tennis Complex,
the Stanford men's tennis team
downed its cross-bay rival to re
main undefeated on the young
season. The win is one of Stan
ford's biggest so far and serves as
a great way to go into what will
undoubtedly be the team's most
important week of the dual
match season.
No. 8 Stanford (6-0) used par
ticularly strong showings from a
pair of upperclassmen, junior
Ryan Thacher and senior Alex
Clayton, to help propel the team
to victory.
Thacher and his doubles
partner, junior Bradley Klahn,
got the match started with a dou
bles win over Cal's top doubles
team of junior Nick Andrews
and freshman Ben McLachlan
by a score of 8-3. After playing in
the doubles draw of the USTA's
SAP Open last week, where they
lost in the quarterfinals, Klahn
and Thacher used their big
match experience to gain an
edge over the younger Cal duo.

first point of all dual matches,

Junior Bradley Klahn won in doubles but lost his singles match in the Stanford men's tennis team's 5-2 win over rival
Cal on Saturday. The Cardinal won the doubles point in a tiebreaker before cruising to the win in singles.
doubles match on court three went
Cal's way. That left the point in the
hands of Clayton and his teammate,
senior Ted Kelly, who were locked
in a tight match with the Golden
Bears' sophomore tandem of
Christoffer Konigsfeldt and Sky
Lovill. The match went down to a
tiebreaker, tied at eight games
apiece, which the Cardinal ended up
winning, 7-1, giving Stanford the
match's first point.
In singles play, Thacher and
Clayton were both solid as well, de
feating their opponents in straight
sets and bringing the Cardinal
within one point of securing the
match. Sophomores Denis Lin and
Matt Kandath were both up for the
challenge, avenging their doubles
loss and securing the fourth and
fifth points for Stanford, assuring
victory. In the other two singles
matches, senior Greg Hirshman
fell to Cal's freshman Ben
McLachlan and Klahn, Stanford's
No. 1 player and the reigning

NCAA singles champion, suffered
his first defeat of the season to sen
ior Pedro Zerbini in a closely con
tested match.
Two weekends from now, Feb. 25
and 26, the Cardinal will travel
down to Los Angeles to do battle
with two of the top six ranked teams
in the country No. 2 USC and
No. 6 UCLA. Stanford, at No. 8, is in
prime position to move up the na
tional rankings with a strong show
ing in L.A.
