Cardinal (8-1) with a 0.6-second
win in the 200-yard freestyle relay,
breaking Stanford's streak of dual
meet wins that dated back to No
vember 2007.
The Golden Bears won 10 of the
16 events on the day, including
both breaststroke events and both
relays.
Stanford was led by its divers, as
senior Meg Flostage took first in
the one-meter and second in the
three-meter, while freshman
Stephanie Phipps took first in the
three-meter. The Cardinal also
took the top two spots in the 500-
yard and 1000-yard freestyle, with
senior Kelsey Ditto and freshman
Andie Taylor each taking first in
one and second in the other.
Next up for Stanford is the Pac
-10 Championships, where the Cardi
nal will have a chance to avenge its

loss. The competition will take place
Feb. 23-26 in Federal Way, Wash.
