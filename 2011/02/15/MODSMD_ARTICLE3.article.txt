## Law students tackle Three Strikes sentences 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Students at Stanford Law School are
fighting to change what is known as the
Three Strikes Law in the California criminal
justice system.
The Stanford Three Strikes Project,
founded in 2006, takes on clients who are fac
ing life sentences under the Three Strikes
Law, which mandates a 25-year to life sen
tence for third-time offenders. The third of

fense need not be "serious" or "violent" for
the law to be applied.
The Three Strikes Project has reduced
sentences in 15 cases over the past two and a
half years.
Shane Taylor, a current client, "struck
out" for possessing 0.09 grams of metham
phetamine valued at $lO, said Stanford Law
School student Susannah Karlsson 'll, who
is handling his case. His previous offenses
were attempted burglary and burglary, both
nonviolent offenses.

Of Taylor's first two strikes, one was the
result of attempting to purchase a pizza with
a stolen check. His third offense put Taylor
under the effect of the three strikes law.
"A pizza and $lO worth of drags resulted
in a life sentence," said Karlsson, emphasiz
ing the excessive nature of the punishment.
"It's amazing," said lecturer Michael Ro
mano, a Three Strikes Project co-founder.
"You start with one case and say, 'I can't be-
lieve that someone is serving a life
sentence for such minor crimes.'
Then you realize there are more."
The Three Strikes Project stu
dents recently held what Karlsson
called a "letter-writing party" in
which the group responded to
about 2,000 letters written by in
mates requesting for help. That
was only two-thirds of the mail
they currently hold.
"We try to do out best job to
triage those cases that we think are
the most disproportionate sen
tences," Romano said.
At the time of its creation, the
Three Strikes Law was designed to
punish career criminals, such as
sexual predators.
"When it was sold, it was about
violence and predators," Karlsson
said. "And that's not how it's being
used."
Karlsson likened the law in its
current manifestation to a "blunt
sword" used to "swipe at the most
vulnerable people in the criminal
justice system."
Although the Project is focused
on dealing with the law on a case
by-case basis, Romano and his stu
dents were recently hired by the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund to
work on reforming the law.
The Three Strikes Project is one
of 10 clinics at the Law School. Stu
dents apply to the clinics and work
under the supervision of licensed
attorneys.
"The clinics are modeled after
medical school internships," said
Romano. Apprentices shadow ex
perts and test their knowledge on
real clients.
Students beginning work with
the Three Strikes Project receive a
quarter's worth of units for full
time work without pay. After the
first quarter, they return to taking
regular classes with the option to
continue their work for units.
Romano noted that the Project
had both a pedagogic mission and
a social mission.
"There is no otsher clinic or or
ganization in the country that rep
resents this law," he said.
The students are concerned
with reducing their clients' sen
tences to terms more proportion
ate to their crimes.
"We're asking the court to reex
amine the sentence, pointing to all
the mistakes made along the way,"
Karlsson said.
Tyrone Miles, another client of
Karlsson's, is serving a life sen
tence for forging a $l2O check after
two nonviolent priors.
The process of appealing the

clients' sentences is long and bu
reaucratic. In Taylor's case, Karls
son filed a habeas petition, which
was denied. This denial was ap
pealed to the California Court of
Appeals in November. The attor
ney general recently responded,
and Karlsson is currently drafting
a reply.
Miles' case was denied in differ
ent stages of the state court and is
currently in the Ninth District Fed
eral Court of Appeals.
"Habeas petitions are least
likely to succeed," Karlsson said.
"There is a really high threshold to
win . . . you have to show some
thing is really bad and really wrong
to be able to get appeal."
"In a huge majority of cases,
prisoners file [habeas petitions]
for themselves and lose almost
every time," Karlsson said.
But Karlsson is optimistic
about the outcome of Taylor's
case.
"We hope that the court orders
argument, because that's an argu
ment we will win," she said. "All we
need to do is let Shane be heard."
