# Cardona names Cruz VP
## Cruz awaits confirmation by Undergrad Senate and GSC 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll
submitted a bill yesterday to the Under
graduate Senate and Graduate Student
Council naming Michael Cruz 'l2 as the
new vice president. The Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council will
vote to confirm the nomination this week.
Cruz will replace Kelsei Wharton, who

resigned from the
VP position after
sustaining an injury
that required him to
take the quarter off.
Cruz will have to
find a replacement
to take on his cur
rent position as
ASSU Senate Chair.
He plans to run elec
tions to fill the soon
to-be vacated seat.
Cardona said
consulting with the

executive committee was the first step to
appointing a new vice president. The exec
utive committee consists of the leaders of
the different ASSU bodies. Together, they
sought recommendations on VP qualities,
but did not generate specific candidates.
The ASSU leadership looked for a can
didate who would be an equal partner and
who could offer opinions on different is
sues. Finding a detail-oriented and hard
working individual was key, Cardona
noted.
"The leadership of the executive An
gelina, Kelsei and John Haskell ap
proached me about the position," Cruz
said. "They described the duties and roles
that I'd be undertaking and, after giving it a
lot of thought and time, I ended up deciding
to accept the position."
"We definitely decided that Michael was
a great choice because of his combination
of experience and the relationships that he
has already established with the cabinet
team, Senate and GSC all the core com
ponents of the ASSU," Cardona said.
Since accepting his new position, Cruz
has been updated on the senate's agenda.
"I've already been looping him in on
high-level administrator meetings," Car
dona said. "He also is up to date on the
work that we're doing with Judicial Affairs
and assisting them with their review, partic
ularly on the student input piece. We meet
daily to talk about what he's doing and
what I'm doing."
"He'll be an integral resource for our
cabinet," said ASSU Executive Chief of
Staff John Haskell 'l2. "He has a lot of
knowledge that, with Kelsei gone, was lost."
Cardona stated that Cruz's appointment
would result in a smooth transition, given
his longstanding ties with ASSU.
"Obviously, the role of VP is a lot of
work and there's no way that I can replace


Cardona and Cruz
Kelsei, but I'm hoping to help aug
ment and help in role of VP," Cruz
said. "I think the most difficult
challenge is making sure that the
process goes smoothly and that
new leadership is quickly appoint
ed in senate."
Cruz began his career in Stan
ford's student government as an
ASSU Executive Fellow and later
became deputy chair of the Ap
propriations Committee.
"I'm very excited about the po
sition and look forward to contin
ue serving the Stanford communi
ty," he said.
