## Campuses respond to protests Faculty and students hold rallies, talks after demonstrations in Egypt 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The youth-led protests that erupted in Egypt
over the past three weeks have elicited numer
ous responses at Stanford and at college cam
puses across the U.S.
Students on the Farm organized an on-cam
pus demonstration on Feb. 4 and participated in
solidarity rallies in San Francisco. History pro
fessor Joel Beinin delivered numerous talks on
the uprising, including one with political science
professor Lisa Blaydes.

Students and faculty at Yale, Harvard and UC
Berkeley have taken similar actions.
"On Monday [Feb. 7] we had about 60 Yale
students gathering on Beinecke Plaza in support
of the demonstrators in Egypt... basically de
manding that Mubarak step down and calling for
the Obama administration to more concretely
support the protestors in Egypt," said Vivian
Yee, editor in chief of the Yale Daily News.
Yale student Omar Muallah 'l2, president of
Yale Students for Justice in Palestine, was an or
ganizer of the student demonstration.
"The goal was to start thinking about what we
could do as Yalies and as Americans to help the
protestors in their struggle for a more dignified,
democratic existence," Muallah said.
Muallah also submitted an op-ed
piece to the Yale Daily News.
On the West Coast, some UC
Berkeley students reacted to the
Egyptian uprisings by participating
in the Feb. 4 rally in San Francisco.
Many Stanford students joined in as
well.
Furthermore, Cal students
staged a "die-in" in solidarity with
the protestors; participants laid
down on the ground and announced
the causes for their "deaths." The
demonstration aimed to raise
awareness about violence against
protestors and was followed by a
rally in which students spoke about
the significance of the uprising. The
political action committee of Berke
ley's Muslim Student Association
organized the events.
"At one point they sat in a circle
in the evening after the rally and
talked about their connection to
Egypt," said Emma Anderson, news
editor at UC Berkeley's Daily Cali
fornian.
One of the protestors had a
friend in Egypt who had been shot in
the eye during the protests. Fie
spoke to the students over the
phone, explaining what had hap
pened to him and what was going on
in Cairo.
"It was definitely very powerful
to the people who were there," An
derson said.
Berkeley students held a second
rally and a candlelight vigil for the
victims of the revolution on Feb. 7.
Anderson described the events
as "very personal," noting that
many of the attendees had direct
ties to Egypt.
Students, however, were not the
only ones to react to Egyptian
protests. In the upper echelons of
academia, Yale faculty published
numerous op-eds in The Yale Daily
News. Professors from Harvard and
Yale signed an open letter to
Obama calling for support for the
democratic movement and hosted
talks to discuss the situation.
President Obama declared in a
statement last Friday "the Egyptian
people have inspired us as they have
changed the world." His comment
came after Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak announced his res
ignation.

Yale and Harvard professors
also hosted a "teach-in" panel at
Yale Law School on Feb. 8 about the
recent unrest in Egypt. The Harvard
Institute of Politics hosted a talk
about what the situation means for
U.S. policy. Members of the history
and Near Eastern studies depart
ments at Berkeley hosted events as
well.
Adding to the academic dia
logue, professors have brought
news of developments overseas into
the lecture hall.
"A couple of professors have
begun incorporating the situation in
Egypt into their curriculum," said
Yee, noting that one professor com
pared the recent events in Egypt
and Tunisia to eastern European
movements in 1989.
"It's definitely something
they've been discussing in classes,"
Anderson said.
"In sociology classes, they talk
about the idea of solidarity," she
added. "In history classes, they talk
about the historical context. Bring
ing the current events into the cur
riculum is how professors have ex
pressed their involvement."
Although Stanford does not
have a study abroad program in
Egypt, Rachel Antonsen 'l2 was in
Cairo studying Arabic on a non-
BOSP program when the protests
erupted. She evacuated to Jordan
on Feb. 5. Students from Yale, Har
vard and UC Berkeley were also
evacuated from Egypt, following
the U.S. State Department's travel
advisory.
Students and faculty in the U.S.
showed their solidarity here, just as
their counterparts at various univer
sities across Egypt joined the move
ment in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Hun
dreds of professors from Cairo Uni
versity, as well as students from the
American University in Cairo
(AUC), where most foreign students
study in Egypt, congregated in the
square to support the Egyptian upris
ing.
Last Sunday morning, the first
day of classes after university clo
sures, students at the AUC held a
mass prayer for those killed during
the uprisings. Three hundred were
killed during the uprisings, according
to Human Rights Watch.
Students from Stanford and UC
Berkeley also attended a vigil in San
Francisco on Saturday to honor the
victims.
