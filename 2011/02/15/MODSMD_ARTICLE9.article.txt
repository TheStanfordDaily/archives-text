## University retains current AP policy 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
As the College Board prepares to roll out its revamped
Advanced Placement (AP) program in the 2012-13 aca
demic year, Stanford plans to retain its current policy on
AP credit, which is heavily biased toward the sciences and
mathematics.
The University currently accepts only fours or fives on
most tests. It requires students continuing in foreign lan
guage to take an additional placement test and does not
accept humanities or social science credit.
"The University's practice is to leave many of these de
cisions up to the individual departments," wrote Harry
Elam, vice provost for undergraduate education, in an e
mail to The Daily.
Credit for AP scores is especially important to students
majoring in science and engineering, who often have a
tough time fulfilling their requirements in four years. Chem
istry, math and physics credits can place these students out
of introductory classes and allow them to begin higher-level
material immediately.
"The vast majority of math majors do have 10 units of
AP credit from either AB or BC on their Stanford tran
script, but it is not a requirement for the major," wrote
Gretchen Lantz, undergraduate student services advisor
in the department of mathematics, in an e-mail to The
Daily.
"By and large, people use their AP scores to help them
decide which course to start in, following our general
guidelines, and this seems to work rather well," she said.
Brad Osgood, senior associate dean for student affairs
in the School of Engineering, concurs. He said AP credit is
considered to be "pretty reliable."
"If somebody did well on the AP Calculus test, we pret
ty much consider it to be equivalent to a college calculus
course, and they're ready to start at the next level," Os
good said.
He stated that AP credit also makes it easier for engi
neering majors to complete a co-terminal degree and
study abroad.
But Stanford's existing AP policy comes with draw
backs, including inconsistencies in the acceptance of for
eign language credits. All foreign language tests except

AP Latin require a score of five for fulfillment of the lan
guage requirement and the 10 units of credit earned.
Latin, however, accepts a four or five to fulfill the lan
guage requirement, but provides no transfer credit what
soever.
Meanwhile, the College Board is in the process of re
structuring the entire AP program to address subjects in
a more analytical way. Revamped courses are slated to
focus on over-arching themes and critical thinking. For
example, biology will be divided into four general themes,
and U.S. history will be separated into seven themes and
nine time-periods.
Revisions will begin with biology, chemistry, physics,
art history, European history, U.S. history and world histo
ry. Changes will also be implemented in the French and
German language exams. The math and English curricu
la, deemed more manageable in their current state, will
remain untouched for now.
According to Elena Stephenson 'l4, students are con
cerned about the type and amount of credits they receive.
Of the five tests she took, Stephenson only received cred
it for AP Calculus. Fler friends at other schools earned
credit for at least two or three tests.
"Math is the one I didn't really care about at all,"
Stephenson said. "If my AP Calc got me out of the Math
GER requirement, I would feel good about things ... I
got placed into Math 42, but it's not like I want to take
more calculus.
"I'm a fuzzy. I'm going to do something humanities re
lated, so I feel like a year of calc is more than I'm going to
need in my life."
Stephenson said she would have preferred to have AP
English Language and Literature count toward the
IHUM requirement.
Laura McMartin 'l4, who received fives on both AP
World History and AP Government, also expressed dis
satisfaction with the University's current policies with re
gard to humanities.
"It's frustrating that those tests count for nothing here,
regardless of your score," McMartin wrote in an e-mail to
the Daily. "Why does Stanford only give AP credit for
math, science [and] language tests and not humanities?"
