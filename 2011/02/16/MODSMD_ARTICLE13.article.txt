## Gazans stripped Author recounts personal and political problems in Gaza 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
In April of 2006, Palestinian blogger
Laila El-Haddad was reveling in a
rare moment of tranquility as she
looked out of her apartment window
at the civilians milling around a local

park across the street, enjoy
ing a quiet afternoon in the
calm Gaza sun. "There was no
chaos, uncertainty and vio
lence that grip our lives," she
wrote. "For a few moments,
things seemed normal."
Then the missiles explod
ed. Shells rained down on the
park and civilians no longer
milled, but fled for their lives.
That abrupt turn of events
didn't surprise El-Haddad
"It was just another Gaza
Friday," she wrote in her new

book, "Gaza Mom: Palestine, Politics, Par
enting and Everything In Between."
Blogger and pundit Laila El-Haddad,
her hair covered with a blue and white
hijab, engaged a small group of Stanford
students in a talk about the Gaza Strip that
alternated between anger, frustration and
sadness about the political state of the 25
mile war-torn stretch of land along the
Mediterranean Sea.
"What often happens in the case of Gaza
is that the personal gets displaced by the
political," said El-Haddad, describing her
efforts to bridge that gap in "Gaza Mom."
"Palestinians are pess-optimists. How do
you understand a situation that is ever
changing, where surviving itself is just an
act of resistance?"
The Gaza Strip, which borders Egypt on
the southwest and Israel on the south, east
and north, has been at the epicenter of the
decades-long Palestinian-Israeli conflict. For
the 1.7 million civilians and refugees who
call the violence-splattered occupied territo
ry home, political disillusionment and bor
der snafus are a part of every-day life.
El-Haddad was born in Gaza and grew

up in the Arabian Gulf, coming to the Unit
ed States for college and then graduate
school. She returned to Gaza as
a stringer for the Aljazeera Eng
lish website where she covered
the Gaza disengagement in

2005 and Palestin
ian parliamentary
elections in 2006.
She and her hus
band, who is a
Palestinian
refugee, are cur
rently living in the
United States
with their two
children, unable
to return to or
visit Gaza due to
the Israeli siege.

They, like thousands of others
of Palestinians are "languish
ing in legal limbo," El-Haddad
said.
"As Palestinians we spend
so much time waiting for
something for a war to
start, for a permit to be ap
proved, for a border to be
crossed," she said. "I wanted

to contribute to the Palestinian narrative."
After wrestling with whether her own
story was cause enough to begin a blog
"what right did I have to speak? I didn't re
ally have it that bad" El-Haddad began
sharing her first-hand experiences online to
show the "harrowing manifestations of oc
cupation."
Several of those experiences focused her
talk, such as the Palestinian civilian effects
of Israel and Egypt's blockade of the move
ment of goods and people in and out of
Gaza, saying that despite media reporting
of a humanitarian food crisis, the sanctions
represented a "siege of freedoms, not the
siege of food." Israel increased its sanctions
and restricted access in Gaza in 2007, after

the Islamic po
litical-militant
group Hamas won the
Palestinian 2006 elections.
"For us, it's a matter of freedom,"
she said. "We want to be able to live nor
mal lives and not have our lives dys-func
tionalized."
She got defensive with the audience
after fielding questions about what obliga
tion Israelis have to Palestinians in the first
place and the underlying motivations for
closing borders in the Gaza strip.
"There are always preconditions placed
on Palestinians and there are none on Is
raelis," she said, prompting a series of heat
ed follow-up questions by the audience.
"There is a great illusion that if one were
to open the borders that Palestinians will
run out of Gaza with knives and attack the
first Israelis they see. But if you talk to
Palestinians who have had children killed
by Israel and born the brunt of the occupa
tion, they say, I don't care about that. If you

ask them if they
bear Israelis hard
feelings, they say, no,
we would welcome
them into our house."
When asked about what
a viable endgame for the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict would
be, El-Haddad was unequivocal.
"A one-state solution that is dem
ocratic with rights for all is where it's
headed whether people like it or not,"
she said. "If Israel were to open the bor
ders, people would have no problem co
existing."

The talk was organized by Students Con
fronting Apartheid by Israel, a student-run
organization that has pressed for Stanford's
divestment from Israel. El-Haddad stopped
at Stanford as part of her two-week book
tour of California and Washington.

In April of 2006, Palestinian blogger
Laila El-Haddad was reveling in a
rare moment of tranquility as she
looked out of her apartment window
at the civilians milling around a local

park across the street, enjoy
ing a quiet afternoon in the
calm Gaza sun. "There was no
chaos, uncertainty and vio
lence that grip our lives," she
wrote. "For a few moments,
things seemed normal."
Then the missiles explod
ed. Shells rained down on the
park and civilians no longer
milled, but fled for their lives.
That abrupt turn of events
didn't surprise El-Haddad
"It was just another Gaza
Friday," she wrote in her new

book, "Gaza Mom: Palestine, Politics, Par
enting and Everything In Between."
Blogger and pundit Laila El-Haddad,
her hair covered with a blue and white
hijab, engaged a small group of Stanford
students in a talk about the Gaza Strip that
alternated between anger, frustration and
sadness about the political state of the 25
mile war-torn stretch of land along the
Mediterranean Sea.
"What often happens in the case of Gaza
is that the personal gets displaced by the
political," said El-Haddad, describing her
efforts to bridge that gap in "Gaza Mom."
"Palestinians are pess-optimists. How do
you understand a situation that is ever
changing, where surviving itself is just an
act of resistance?"
The Gaza Strip, which borders Egypt on
the southwest and Israel on the south, east
and north, has been at the epicenter of the
decades-long Palestinian-Israeli conflict. For
the 1.7 million civilians and refugees who
call the violence-splattered occupied territo
ry home, political disillusionment and bor
der snafus are a part of every-day life.
El-Haddad was born in Gaza and grew

up in the Arabian Gulf, coming to the Unit
ed States for college and then graduate
school. She returned to Gaza as
a stringer for the Aljazeera Eng
lish website where she covered
the Gaza disengagement in

2005 and Palestin
ian parliamentary
elections in 2006.
She and her hus
band, who is a
Palestinian
refugee, are cur
rently living in the
United States
with their two
children, unable
to return to or
visit Gaza due to
the Israeli siege.

They, like thousands of others
of Palestinians are "languish
ing in legal limbo," El-Haddad
said.
"As Palestinians we spend
so much time waiting for
something for a war to
start, for a permit to be ap
proved, for a border to be
crossed," she said. "I wanted

to contribute to the Palestinian narrative."
After wrestling with whether her own
story was cause enough to begin a blog
"what right did I have to speak? I didn't re
ally have it that bad" El-Haddad began
sharing her first-hand experiences online to
show the "harrowing manifestations of oc
cupation."
Several of those experiences focused her
talk, such as the Palestinian civilian effects
of Israel and Egypt's blockade of the move
ment of goods and people in and out of
Gaza, saying that despite media reporting
of a humanitarian food crisis, the sanctions
represented a "siege of freedoms, not the
siege of food." Israel increased its sanctions
and restricted access in Gaza in 2007, after

the Islamic po
litical-militant
group Hamas won the
Palestinian 2006 elections.
"For us, it's a matter of freedom,"
she said. "We want to be able to live nor
mal lives and not have our lives dys-func
tionalized."
She got defensive with the audience
after fielding questions about what obliga
tion Israelis have to Palestinians in the first
place and the underlying motivations for
closing borders in the Gaza strip.
"There are always preconditions placed
on Palestinians and there are none on Is
raelis," she said, prompting a series of heat
ed follow-up questions by the audience.
"There is a great illusion that if one were
to open the borders that Palestinians will
run out of Gaza with knives and attack the
first Israelis they see. But if you talk to
Palestinians who have had children killed
by Israel and born the brunt of the occupa
tion, they say, I don't care about that. If you

ask them if they
bear Israelis hard
feelings, they say, no,
we would welcome
them into our house."
When asked about what
a viable endgame for the Is
raeli-Palestinian conflict would
be, El-Haddad was unequivocal.
"A one-state solution that is dem
ocratic with rights for all is where it's
headed whether people like it or not,"
she said. "If Israel were to open the bor
ders, people would have no problem co
existing."

The talk was organized by Students Con
fronting Apartheid by Israel, a student-run
organization that has pressed for Stanford's
divestment from Israel. El-Haddad stopped
at Stanford as part of her two-week book
tour of California and Washington.
