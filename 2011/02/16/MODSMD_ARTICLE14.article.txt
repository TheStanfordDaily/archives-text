## EDITORIAL Bike Helmet Campaigns: What Works and What Doesn't 
### 
The reluctance of Stanford stu
dents to wear bike helmets is
not a new issue. It is raised
every year, and people continue to
wonder why such an intelligent and
informed community resists this
common safety practice. Bike hel
mets are made available, alarming
statistics are publicized and many
helmet promotion efforts are un
dertaken, usually with limited effec
tiveness. The strategy of persuading
students and decreasing the burden
of using a helmet is not getting the
job done. But members of the Park
ing and Transportation Services
(P&TS) Bicycle Program have real
ized this and taken the right ap
proach by developing a new pro
gram, one based on community
norms, shared goals and positive
peer pressure.

P&TS estimates that only 10 per
cent of undergraduate bicycle riders
wear helmets; the figure for gradu
ate students is twice as high at 22
percent, but still far from acceptable.
Ask students why they choose not
to wear a helmet, and you will hear
the same set of answers over and
over. Money spent on a helmet
could be used elsewhere. They are
inconvenient to carry around. It
takes time to go buy one. It messes
up your hair. But the most common
response, by far, is that wearing a
helmet is not the norm; this answer
usually takes a form such as "I don't
want to look like a geek" or "no one
else is doing it."
Given that this is the most popu
lar answer, it is not surprising that
prior attempts to address the prob
lem have been relatively ineffective.
Helmets are sold at a discount and
sometimes given out for free, pre
sumably to address the cost and
convenience complaints. Statistics
on helmet use, accidents and fatali
ties are emphasized, but just as the
majority of smokers are aware of
the danger that habit poses to their

health, students choosing to ride
without a helmet generally know
the risks they are taking. Similarly,
the introduction last quarter of
large, illuminated signs declaring
"Helmets Save Brains" is unlikely
to motivate the desired behavior
change.
These efforts should not be elim
inated, however, as they do provide
some benefit. A free helmet may
make the difference for a student
with financial constraints, just as re
membering an important statistic
might encourage a few individuals
to reach for the helmet hanging in
the closet. But these measures do
not address the core issue the so
cial norm against wearing a helmet.
The Bike Safety Dorm Chal
lenge, launched by the P&TS Bicy
cle Program last quarter, is a big step
in the right direction. Students
joined the Challenge by completing
a short bike safety quiz and taking
the Stanford Bike Safety Pledge,
which includes the commitment to
wear a helmet for every bicycle ride.
The program established a competi
tion between dorms to achieve the
highest rates of participation, with
the winning dorm receiving a bus
charter to Tahoe. Results of the
Challenge, released early this quar
ter, are very promising. Over 600
students from 40 dorms joined the
program, and several dorms
achieved participation rates above
80 percent. Two houses, ZAP and
Phi Sig, had 100 percent participa
tion. And to discourage cheating,
P&TS deployed Sprocket Man, its
bicycle safety promoter, who dis
qualified the dorm of any Challenge
participant spotted without a hel
met.

This program was successful pre
cisely because of its creative ap
proach. It operated not by convinc
ing students that they should wear
