# PARSLEY IS GHARSLEY
## Too Darn Many Student Groups 
### Robin Thomas 
So I come along with random lit
tle projects like the "Let's talk
about anything" doohickey.
They have no real name, no budget,
no meeting times, and no particular
structure. It takes maybe an hour,
tops, late on a Sunday night, for me to
spam six or seven e-mail lists with a
message that says, "Hey, this thing at
Stanford bugs me, what do you think
about this idea?"Then,to my amaze
ment, tremendous numbers of
strangers write back thanking me for
my "innovation" and "bravery" and
asking how they can help. Mean
while, all the well-established and
prolific student groups dedicated to
curing cancer and/or ending global
poverty get no attention. It's crazy
what's considered passe at Stanford.
How many "Projects" do we have
on campus now that are dedicated to
mental wellness? We've got Project
Love, Project Compassion, Project
Happiness, the Resilience Project...
and those are just the ones I can
name off the top of my head. That's
four projects dedicated to very simi
lar causes.
And how about our tutoring
groups? How many dozens of those
do we have? And how about envi
ronmental groups? You can hear
Stanford tour guides trumpeting to
their awestruck audiences that we
have, what, over 700 groups on cam
pus? But take away all the groups
that don't actually exist anymore, and
the groups that don't actually do any
thing, and the groups that are near
duplicates of each other, and you
have how many left? I've got five

bucks that says it's fewer than 40.
On my long list of "Bizarre Habits
That Stanford Students Have," near
the top is that whenever we see a
problem in the world or here at
home, or whenever we want to make
some kind of change at all, our gut in
stinct is to go create a new student
group. Or a committee, or an initia
tive, or a project. For some reason we
do this even if there's already some
thing on campus dedicated to doing
exactly what we want to be doing.
The result is that there are about half
a gajillion groups at the Activities
Fairs that all have the same cause but
are competing against each other for
tabling space. I remember going to
my very first Activities Fair looking
for a tutoring group, and being so
overwhelmed by the selection that I
ended up not joining any.
We've been bred, I think, to have
the attitude of "If you want some
thing done right, you have to do it
yourself." (How many times in high
school, when you were assigned a
group project, did you end up doing
all the work?) We think that this is
leadership. But I think it's a mix of
mistrust and pride.

You create the 300 th group for
"Good Cause X" because the way
you want to save the planet is inno
vative; surely none of the existing
299 groups have ever thought about
your idea. And you don't want to run
it by them first because, well, they
might screw it up, or they might steal
it, or maybe they won't think your
idea is as great as you do. Who cares
if they have more experience, re
sources, and networking history
than you do? You don't want to join
any of those old groups because
then you'll feel like you have to fol
low someone else's rules, and while
you know how to do public speaking
and grant-writing and self-promot
ing, you've never really been that
confident about actually working
with other people, and you'd kind of
like to put "created a new student
group" on your resume anyway. In
fact, it would be great if someone

could just give you a few thousand
bucks to work by yourself on your
Big Idea the way you know it ought
to be done.
The reality is the world has never
been changed by someone doing
anything by him or herself. And
while you might think your Big Idea
is the cat's pajamas, odds are there's
someone else at this school who has
an even better take on your vision
than you do.
So enough of this "leader" and
"follower" business. I think if you
want something done right, you
don't do it yourself; instead, you vo
cally be yourself and tell people
what's on your mind and see what
they think about it, and then, if
they're interested, you do it togeth
er. If you belie ve you need a new stu
dent group to do what you want to
do, you're selling everyone else
and yourself way too short.

my very first Activities Fair looking
for a tutoring group, and being so
overwhelmed by the selection that I
ended up not joining any.
We've been bred, I think, to have
the attitude of "If you want some
thing done right, you have to do it
yourself." (How many times in high
school, when you were assigned a
group project, did you end up doing
all the work?) We think that this is
leadership. But I think it's a mix of
mistrust and pride.

You create the 300 th group for
"Good Cause X" because the way
you want to save the planet is inno
vative; surely none of the existing
299 groups have ever thought about
your idea. And you don't want to run
it by them first because, well, they
might screw it up, or they might steal
it, or maybe they won't think your
idea is as great as you do. Who cares
if they have more experience, re
sources, and networking history
than you do? You don't want to join
any of those old groups because
then you'll feel like you have to fol
low someone else's rules, and while
you know how to do public speaking
and grant-writing and self-promot
ing, you've never really been that
confident about actually working
with other people, and you'd kind of
like to put "created a new student
group" on your resume anyway. In
fact, it would be great if someone

could just give you a few thousand
bucks to work by yourself on your
Big Idea the way you know it ought
to be done.
The reality is the world has never
been changed by someone doing
anything by him or herself. And
while you might think your Big Idea
is the cat's pajamas, odds are there's
someone else at this school who has
an even better take on your vision
than you do.
So enough of this "leader" and
"follower" business. I think if you
want something done right, you
don't do it yourself; instead, you vo
cally be yourself and tell people
what's on your mind and see what
they think about it, and then, if
they're interested, you do it togeth
er. If you belie ve you need a new stu
dent group to do what you want to
do, you're selling everyone else
and yourself way too short.
