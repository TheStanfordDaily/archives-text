# REALITY CHECK
## New GER required 
### Alex Hicks-Nelson 
This past Sunday was an excel
lent day to sleep in. Fewer
hours to dread Singles Aware
ness Day, more time away from the
ol' problem set routine, and skip
ping the annoyance of having to
cook or purchase breakfast. I'm
sure many of you out there were
contemplating the exact distance
from your bed to the floor, and
whether you should navigate that
gap yet.

For me, it was just another day at
Cubberley Library, working at the
circulation desk. Usually, it is great
to work on Sundays; I get to open
the library, shelve a few books, and
spend the rest of my time doing my
own work. Increasingly though, I've
been getting strange patrons. Peo
ple who don't know how the Dewey
Decimal System works, don't know
the call number or location of their

needed material, don't have their
student ID, don't have change for
the photocopier ... and are angry
at me about it.

Don't get me wrong: I love my
job. It is relaxing to set off through
the stacks, re-shelving each volume
in its proper place. I like to think
I've gotten quick about answering
questions pertaining to source ma
terial, the layout of the library, and
general goings-on here. I'm more
than happy to give you a tour of our
now earthquake safe facilities, or

show you where the best picture
books are in the curriculum sec
tions. I'll brave the harrowing mi
crofiche collections, track down an
elusive periodical, or even take a
field trip down to the basement to
find a book in storage.
What I could do without is the
sudden huff, the grimace and glare
of guests who dump their problems
on me. Countless times I've been in
structed to manually bypass the
checkout system and load a stu
dent's information and library code
from the database, as though the
person in question warranted jeop
ardizing my job. I've had people go
off on me because the book they
wanted from reserves got checked
out in the time it took them to get to
Cubberley, people berating me for

moving source material to an auxil
iary library, and a host of other un
fair and unreasonable accusations
and demands.
How do these rude, belligerent
individuals even get here? I can't
help wondering if Stanford saw the
true Mr. or Mrs. Doe as I watch
their cranky silhouette disappear
down the stairs. SAT scores, com
munity service work, AP classes, a
few extracurriculars and that's it.
How do you weigh someone's tem
perament? A central dogma of the
Stanford selection process is a
vague but attractive idea that ad
missions tries to craft a coherent
class dynamic. Make sure they have
enough people interested in the
arts, add dashes of exotic instru
mental geniuses, work in some pre
professionals, etc. While this might
mesh on paper, how are they to
know whether someone can func-

tion in the real world?
The short answer is, they can't
possibly know. Who could fathom
whether or not some student has
the common sense and empathic
power to restrain raging over a mis
placed journal? Stanford couldn't
possibly schedule interviews, even
if it could easily weed out some of
the blatantly offensive people. In
spite of itself, Stanford is forced to
hope and pray that applicants have
the genuine qualities associated
with their resume and not simply a
passion to get into college. Some
one who volunteered all through
high school, for example, could very

well have a genuine interest in help
ing those less fortunate. They could
just as easily know that colleges will
perceive them this way, and the col
lege application process has no real
remedy for such cases.
Instead of worrying over
whether or not applicants know
how to behave in public, we could
just go through the act of teaching
them how to function when they get
here, I would hope that, if you be
lieve your institution is training up
tomorrow's leaders, some consider
ation would be given towards de
veloping every facet of the individ
ual, especially that face which is
turned to the public for most of the
day. If any class is made mandatory
in the future, I think a pass/fail In
teractions class should be first on
the list. There is absolutely no rea
son to give someone the skills to
master academia without seeing if
they can handle basic human de
cency first.

Has anyone ever gone off on you for
not bypassing the system? Tell Alex
about it at ahicksne@stanford.edu.

How are they to know
if someone can
function in the
real world?
