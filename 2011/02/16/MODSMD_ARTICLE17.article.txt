# REALITY CHECK

This past Sunday was an excel
lent day to sleep in. Fewer
hours to dread Singles Aware
ness Day, more time away from the
ol' problem set routine, and skip
ping the annoyance of having to
cook or purchase breakfast. I'm
sure many of you out there were
contemplating the exact distance
from your bed to the floor, and
whether you should navigate that

elusive periodical, or even take a
field trip down to the basement to
find a book in storage.
What I could do without is the
sudden huff, the grimace and glare
of guests who dump their problems
on me. Countless times I've been in
structed to manually bypass the
checkout system and load a stu
dent's information and library code
from the database, as though the
person in question warranted jeop
ardizing my job. I've had people go
off on me because the book they
wanted from reserves got checked
out in the time it took them to get to
Cubberley, people berating me for
