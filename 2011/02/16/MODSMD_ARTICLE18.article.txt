# OP-ED
## The 						Cost of Free Money 
### VALERIA FEDYK '14 DAILY FELLOW 
Life was good. I passed my em
ployment drug screen, I met up
with my friend Dina, and I sat
under the sunshine at Tresidder sip
ping a delicious iced latte. To top it
off, I had just received a $3,500 check
in the mail. There was a small prob
lem I had no idea who the check
was from, since it was mailed from a
Cathy, issued by a Kelly, and signed
by an Olivia but hey, it had my
name in the "Pay to the order of"
line, so it legitimately belonged to
me.
Still, I reasoned that the sooner
this mysterious money made its way
into my bank account, the better. I
sprinted up the stairs to the nearest
Bank of America ATM, inserted my
card, inserted the check, held my
breath for three seconds and
voila I was $3,500 richer. Yes, life
was definitely good.
But as I left the ATM, something
didn't feel quite right. Maybe it was
the fact that I had no idea who the
check was from, or that it was issued
by a bank I never heard of, or that it
was mailed all the way from Florida
... wait, Florida, that sounded famil
iar ...
And I reluctantly remembered
my recent SU Post advertisement. I

was selling my fall quarter IHUM
books, and a John Malkinson from
Florida had offered to buy them. He
promised to pay by mailing a check,
and I agreed. After all, what dude in
Florida wouldn't be up for buying
three used $5 books required for a
particular IHUM Stanford class?
But when I returned to Larkin
and saw the "I made [sic] mistake
while writing the check please get
back to me after you cash it from the
bank" message from this John
Malkinson, I suspected he wasn't
after the $l5 used IHUM books
after all.
The next morning, I checked my
email and my stomach churned.
There was a request for my SU Post
Math book. There was another one
for my Spanish book. And even, in all
its glory, another request for the very
same IHUM books. All the requests
were from John Malkinson. It was
suspicious enough when he wanted
the IHUM books the first time, and
requesting a second copy along with
every other used book on campus
wasn't exactly helping his case.
So the next day, I did what I al
ways do when I have a serious prob
lem that I can't postpone any longer:
I called my parents.

"Hey, Mom," I began, trying to
sound as innocent and carefree as
possible.
"What's wrong?" How did she al
ready know I was in trouble? I made
a mental note to stop calling her only
in times of an impending apocalypse.
"I got this mysterious $3,500
check in the mail, so I immediately
deposited it into my account, and
now the dude wants the money back
..." That pretty much summed up
the situation.
"Back in Russia," my dad began.
"Some bandits would leave a wallet
on the ground and hide.Then as soon
as you picked up the wallet and took
the money, they would come out and
claim you took their money. Then
they would take your wallet and
everything that was in it both the
money you just picked up and any
thing you had before. There was just
no way to prove what had been
yours and what you had just picked
up."
I felt glad that I wasn't "back in
Russia," since I suspected I would
have been an easy target for that
neat trick. As I wondered how a
criminal could benefit from giving
me $3,500, my mom proposed a
"back in America" version:
"The check is fake."
Suddenly, it all made sense: John
mails me a fake check, says it was a
mistake, and asks for the money
back. I mail him real money, a week
later the bank discovers the check I
deposited was fake, and c'est la
vie I'm in jail for a criminal of
fense, not to mention down $3.5 K.
"That's not good." I voiced the
obvious.
"No, it's not. E-mail Bank of
America immediately to say that the
check was probably fake."
And after receiving another e
mail of "Go and cash the moey [sic]

from the bank and then send the re
maining balance" from John
Malkinson, I followed my mom's ad
vice, The $3,500 was promptly with
drawn from my account, and I was
told the matter would be settled as
soon as I visited my local Bank of
America branch.
Fortunately, the story ended well
enough. I opened a new bank ac
count, transferred my balance, and
adjusted the security settings. I did
get a 2:34 a.m. call from John
Malkinson soon after, which I
promptly returned at 4:00 a.m. the
following morning for some moral
revenge. But apart from that and a
friend request on Tagged a week
later, I haven't heard from John
Malkinson ever since. Life is good
again.
