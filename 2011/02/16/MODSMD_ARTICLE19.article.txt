## Going Paleo on the Stanford Campus

£ £ ~W That to eat" is a hot
W/ topic on everyone's
T V mind these days.
Whether the reason is economic,
environmental, ethical, tradition
al, for health, performance, con
venience or personal satisfaction,
everyone has to make the deci
sion. And it has become increas
ingly difficult.
In an article called "The Din
ner Divide" in Newsweek maga
zine last year, Lisa Miller argued
that food has become a fundamen
tal indicator of social status. "As
more of us indulge in our passion
for local, organic delicacies, a
growing number of Americans
don't have enough nutritious food
to eat," she wrote. Cheap food, by
and large, is bad food.
That got me thinking: if mod
ern agriculture has created this
problem, is the agricultural
"progress" reversible? The recent
popularity of the "Paleo" diet
to eat as our hunter-gatherer an
cestors did in the Paleolithic era
led me to wonder: Could I sur
vive as a hunter-gatherer on the
Stanford campus? I decided to try.
I set out to collect a daily serv
ing of calories (2000 kCal) with a
sufficient serving of protein (50g),
carbohydrates (300g), and fats
(65g). My only resources were
two maps, Trees of Stanford, Early
Uses of California Plants, my two
feet and an empty bag. Due to
seasonal constraints, I found my
options limited to citrus fruits,
pomegranates, acorns, and wild
game (squirrels, rabbits and rac
coons).

Collecting citrus fruits was by
far the easiest, because orange,
lemon, lime and tangerine trees
are abundant on campus. I did not
need to look at too many maps to
find them. To add variety to the
citrus, and supplement carbohy
drate intake, I was able to gather
ripened pomegranates.
Protein and fats were the hard
est to come across. It was evident
that I could hunt squirrels, howev
er firearms are expressly forbid
den on the Stanford campus, and I
didn't have the tools at my dispos
al to hunt, skin and gut a squirrel.
It became clear that, with my lim
ited resources, I was going to have
to rely on plants. Acorns were ac
tually a staple of many native Cal
ifornians' diets. Quercus agrifolia
(coast live oak) is the most prized
species.
Eating acorns is actually a fair
ly complex process, but I was up to
the challenge. If I were to eat
three pomegranates and three or
anges in a day, I would still need
about 30 g of protein to meet my
needs. Gathering acorns also
proved to be pretty time consum
ing. I spent about an hour and a
half collecting one pound of
acorns.
After collecting them, I had to
crack each shell individually and
remove the meat (about 2 to 3
hours for a pound of acorns). I
then mashed up the nuts a bit and
had to boil out the tannin. Tannin
makes the nut incredibly bitter
and mildly toxic to humans (and
some animals), because it slows
down the digestive process. In

order to remove the bitterness, the
acorns need to be boiled until the
water turns dark brown, switched
to a clean pot of water and repeat
ed 3-4 times.
After boiling the nuts, I put
them in a food processor to cre
ate a flour-like substance. I
thought at this point, that if I
could only cook nuts, I might as
well get creative and mix in vari
ous fruits. I cooked four different
acorn/water/fruit mixtures
(lemon and rosemary, orange,
pomegranate, and plain) in a pan
over high heat for 20 minutes.
This was a mistake: acorns do not
mix well with citrus. The lemon
and rosemary and plain cakes
were okay (edible at the least),
however the orange and pome
granate cakes were terrible.
I ultimately succeeded in my
goal of creating a full Paleo meal
off of the Stanford campus. With
a sufficient trap and knife, I could
have added squirrels or rabbits to
my diet, which would significant
ly cut down preparation time. My
approach was not the most effi
cient or convenient approach.
But I learned there are many re
sources in the world that are good
for our health and the environ
ment that do not exist in a store,
that we can take advantage of. I
felt much more connected to
what I was eating. And while the
taste of my meal left something to
be desired, the same could be said
of many meals on the Stanford
campus.

granate cakes were terrible.
I ultimately succeeded in my
goal of creating a full Paleo meal
off of the Stanford campus. With
a sufficient trap and knife, I could
have added squirrels or rabbits to
my diet, which would significant
ly cut down preparation time. My
approach was not the most effi
cient or convenient approach.
But I learned there are many re
sources in the world that are good
for our health and the environ
ment that do not exist in a store,
that we can take advantage of. I
felt much more connected to
what I was eating. And while the
taste of my meal left something to
be desired, the same could be said
of many meals on the Stanford
campus.
