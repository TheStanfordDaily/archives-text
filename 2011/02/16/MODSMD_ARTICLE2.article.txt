## Defaulted loan rates stay low Three-year default rate 1.3 percent last fiscal year 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Student loan defaults at Stanford
remain low, but recent made by the
Department of Education require
universities to measure their default
rates over three years instead of two,
which could reveal more students
missing payments. Under this new
calculation, Stanford's three-year de
fault rate is 1.3 percent, which mis
leadingly appears to have increased
from its two-year default rate of 0.8
percent, despite the fact that overall
default rates have not changed.
The default rate is the ratio of stu
dents who have defaulted against
those who took out loans. The U.S.
Department of Education requires
these statistics, and high default rates
could affect colleges' and universi
ties' access to federal funds.
Financial aid director Karen
Cooper said Stanford was "well with
in the established parameters for re
sponsibly managing federal funds.
"Across our whole population, we
can essentially count on two hands
the number of students who have
gone into default after entering re
payment within their first three
years," she said.
Recent adjustments to federal law
may obscure this fact.
"Now because you've expanded it
to a three-year cohort, the calculation
goes up a little bit, but I don't think it's
a reflection that Stanford students as
a whole are going to see a drastic in
crease in defaults," said Jack Ed
wards, director of financial aid at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
Typically, it takes 10 years to repay
a student loan making the minimum
payments.
"Adding that one more year to the
calculation gives you a bigger window
into what's going on with your stu
dents," Cooper said.
The number of undergraduate
students who take out loans in the
first place has fallen from between
2,000 and 2,500 students to between
900 and 975 students since the 2008-
09 school year. Just over 1,900 gradu
ate students have taken out loans, a
number that has been "pretty steady"
for the last four years, Cooper said.
Edwards noted that about 60 per
cent of GSB students take out loans
and that the default rate is consistent
ly under one percent.
"They understand how it can im
pact their credit, so they are very con
scious of it. They are business stu
dents, so they pride themselves of
having excellent credit."
Cooper said Stanford's relatively
low default rate isn't closely related to
work done by the financial aid office.
She attributed this success to "the
quality of students" at Stanford and
"the fact that they really do find good
