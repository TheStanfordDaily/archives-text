## BULLDOGS BESTED Men's tennis downs Fresno State, 5-2 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team remained
undefeated on Tuesday afternoon, defeating
Fresno State and the tricky weather condi
tions at the Taube Tennis Stadium. The No.
8 Cardinal (7-0) was able to gut out a tightly
fought victory over a feisty Bulldog team (4-
4) and a stiff wind, prevailing by a score of 5-
2.
Bradley Klahn, a junior and Stanford's No.
1 player, rebounded well from his first singles
loss of the 2011 season last weekend at Cal,
helping to lead the Cardinal to victory on
Tuesday. The reigning NCAA singles champi
on defeated the Fresno State senior from
South Africa, Rikus de Villers, in three sets.

With his normal doubles partner,
junior Ryan Thacher, sitting out, Klahn also
teamed up with freshman Jamin Ball to hand
ily defeat the Philippines's Francis Alcantara
and France's Jean-Charles Diame at No. 2
doubles, 8-2.
Cardinal sophomores Matt Kandath and
Dennis Lin both had excellent days as well,
each achieving victories in singles play and
teaming up to win in doubles. Both of their
singles matches went the full three sets. The
matchup was competitive, with four of the
singles matches going three sets.
This match took place at a very distinct
point in the schedule for the Cardinal, falling

After losing for the first time all season at Cal last weekend, Stanford's top player and defending national champion Bradley Klahn, above,
bounced back with wins in both singles and doubles yesterday. With the win, Stanford improved to 7-0 on the young season.
directly after its contest against rival
Cal and directly before the National
Team Indoor Championships, which
take place this weekend in Seattle,
featuring 15 out of the 16 top
ranked teams in the country.
Klahn had a lot to say about the
victory and where the Cardinal is in
its season.
"It could have been a letdown for
the team, what with playing Cal on
Saturday and the National Indoor
Tournament this coming weekend,"
he said. "So I thought we really
needed to come out and focus. Fres
no State played a good match, they
took four first sets from us, and we
had to battle back all day. I think the
confidence of our team really
showed itself out there."

Klahn also spoke briefly about
Stanford's big win over then-No. 18
Cal last Saturday, and how he felt
personally after suffering his first
defeat of the dual-match season
against Cal's No. 1 singles player,
Pedro Zerbini.
"It felt good to get back on the
court after Cal and my first loss of
the season, which was tough, but you
know, we still had a great team win,
and that's what's most important,"
he said.
After these last two wins, Stan
ford is in a nice position in the early
part of its season, sitting at 7-0 and
securely within the top 10 of the na
tional rankings at No. 8.
The team's mettle will be tested
this coming weekend up in Seattle,
starting on Friday afternoon when,
in the round of 16, the Cardinal is set
to battle the No. 11 Florida Gators.
