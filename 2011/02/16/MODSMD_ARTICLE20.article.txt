The Stanford men's tennis team remained
undefeated on Tuesday afternoon, defeating
Fresno State and the tricky weather condi
tions at the Taube Tennis Stadium. The No.
8 Cardinal (7-0) was able to gut out a tightly
fought victory over a feisty Bulldog team (4-
4) and a stiff wind, prevailing by a score of 5-
2.
Bradley Klahn, a junior and Stanford's No.
1 player, rebounded well from his first singles
loss of the 2011 season last weekend at Cal,
helping to lead the Cardinal to victory on
Tuesday. The reigning NCAA singles champi
on defeated the Fresno State senior from
South Africa, Rikus de Villers, in three sets.

With his normal doubles partner,
junior Ryan Thacher, sitting out, Klahn also
teamed up with freshman Jamin Ball to hand
ily defeat the Philippines's Francis Alcantara
and France's Jean-Charles Diame at No. 2
doubles, 8-2.
Cardinal sophomores Matt Kandath and
Dennis Lin both had excellent days as well,
each achieving victories in singles play and
teaming up to win in doubles. Both of their
singles matches went the full three sets. The
matchup was competitive, with four of the
singles matches going three sets.
This match took place at a very distinct
point in the schedule for the Cardinal, falling
