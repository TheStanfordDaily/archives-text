## Stanford football ticket sales up more than 200 percent 
### 
Stanford football is already
reaping the benefits of arguably
its best season in history. The
Peninsula Press reported yester
day that early sales of season tick
ets are up 206 percent from last
year.
As of mid-February, the Stan
ford ticket office had sold 1,400
new season tickets for the 2011 sea
son. Last year, it took until June for

Stanford to sell just 458 new plans.
Stanford finished its 2010 season
12-1 and ranked No. 4 in the nation.
The Cardinal defeated Virginia
Tech, 40-12, in the Orange Bowl to
close out its historic year. Although
head coach Jim Harbaugh left the
Farm for the NFL's San Francisco
49ers, star quarterback Andrew
Luck is returning to school for his
redshirt-junior season. He will like
ly enter the 2011 season as the Heis
man Trophy favorite.
In addition to last season's suc
cess, Stanford football has a mar

quee home schedule next season
featuring Cal, Oregon and Notre
Dame. Stanford also amped up
marketing because of last year's
play.
The Cardinal's fan presence
ranked ninth in the Pac-10 last sea
son, with about 40,000 spectators
per game.
