# Senior Swings
## 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Blessed with the leadership of its three-member senior class, this
year's women's tennis team appears poised to have an impressive
run through the 2011 season. Hilary Barte, Carolyn McVeigh
and Jennifer Yen lead the Cardinal this year, and have added an
element of maturity needed to balance a large recruiting class.
Each player does her part to add to the camaraderie of the team, which has
learned to follow their lead. They have developed a vibrant personality as
a group on and off the court.

"I'm not even sure I could put it
into words how much going to Stan
ford and the Stanford experience
has meant to me," Barte said. "Of
course tennis has been a big positive,
but it hasn't been everything. It's re
ally humbling and motivating to be
surrounded with such greatness
here."
McVeigh, from New Canaan,
Conn., played for King School dur
ing high school. She was ranked No.
1 in the New England under-18 divi
sion at the age of 14. A political sci
ence major, she came to the West
Coast to combine her love for tennis
with her academic pursuits. Overall,
she is 78-30 in singles and 75-27 in
doubles.
"It's a fitting way to end our careers
with us trying to lead the team togeth
er," McVeigh said. "It's also sad know
ing such an amazing experience and
journey is close to an end. It makes ah
the matches, each experience, that
much better because you have to
make the most of your last year."
Yen is a local girl, raised in Fre
mont, Calif, while attending Mission
San Jose High School. Pursuing an
engineering degree at Stanford, Yen
describes her time with her class as
being incredibly close.
"A huge part of it is that we got
thrown into everything together our
freshman year," Yen said. "It was al
ways just the three of us because we
were pretty silly and immature. We
relied on each other so much that we
became super tight. They're my clos
est friends and the most amazing
teammates."
Yen has a 35-20 career record in
singles and a 26-19 record in dou
bles. Her very first collegiate match
win came against UC-Davis' De
siree Stone, a 6-4,4-6,1-0 (10-3) vic
tory on Oct. 13, 2007. Last season,
she was undefeated in four dual sin
gles matches and combined with
four different partners to compile a
5-5 doubles record.
Barte has had a remarkable run at
Stanford. An international relations
major from Chatsworth, Calif., Barte
attended Harvard-Westlake High
School before moving to Northern
California. At Stanford, she has been
an Ah-American in singles and dou
bles every year she's been at Stanford.
She is a two-time First Team All-Pac
-10 honoree and one-time First Team
All-Pac-10 selection.

One of her favorite personal mo
ments, though, came when she
clinched the Pac-10 title in 2008.
"We were in a dogfight at home
against UCLA and it came down to
my match and Carolyn's match,"
Barte said. "I was in the third set and
I think Carolyn was in the second. I
was up 5-3, 40-30, and I hit the
biggest serve down the T. I aced her
to win the match, win the day and
win the Pac-10 title."

She has accumulated a 103-23
overall record in singles and an 89-
27 record in doubles, including a na
tional championship with Lindsay
Burdette. She has been granted nu
merous accolades, including ITA
National Rookie of the Year and
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in
2008, Pac-10 Player of the Year and
Pac-10 All-Academic Honorable
Mention in 2009, ITA National Play
er to Watch, Pac-10 All-Academic
Honorable Mention and NCAA
doubles champion in 2010.
The abilities of each of these
women have added to the storied
tradition of Stanford tennis. Their
time on the Farm has been well
spent so far, and with a season left,
they are out to prove what more
they can give. With only four road
games all year, this group of seniors
has the opportunity to make the
most of its time at home and fight for
a 17th NCAA championship. Even
if they don't win it again, though,
they are happy with their time here.
"Obviously tennis-wise, our goal
is to defend our championship," Yen
said. "But for me personally, I fell in
love with this program when I first
came here. I fell in love with the peo
ple, One of the things that makes me
want to go out there everyday is the
chance to be with this amazing
team."

has meant to me," Barte said. "Of
course tennis has been a big positive,
but it hasn't been everything. It's re
ally humbling and motivating to be
surrounded with such greatness
here."
McVeigh, from New Canaan,
Conn., played for King School dur
ing high school. She was ranked No.
1 in the New England under-18 divi
sion at the age of 14. A political sci
ence major, she came to the West
Coast to combine her love for tennis
with her academic pursuits. Overall,
she is 78-30 in singles and 75-27 in
doubles.
"It's a fitting way to end our careers
with us trying to lead the team togeth
er," McVeigh said. "It's also sad know
ing such an amazing experience and
journey is close to an end. It makes ah
the matches, each experience, that
much better because you have to
make the most of your last year."
Yen is a local girl, raised in Fre
mont, Calif, while attending Mission
San Jose High School. Pursuing an
engineering degree at Stanford, Yen
describes her time with her class as
being incredibly close.
"A huge part of it is that we got
thrown into everything together our
freshman year," Yen said. "It was al
ways just the three of us because we
were pretty silly and immature. We
relied on each other so much that we
became super tight. They're my clos
est friends and the most amazing
teammates."
Yen has a 35-20 career record in
singles and a 26-19 record in dou
bles. Her very first collegiate match
win came against UC-Davis' De
siree Stone, a 6-4,4-6,1-0 (10-3) vic
tory on Oct. 13, 2007. Last season,
she was undefeated in four dual sin
gles matches and combined with
four different partners to compile a
5-5 doubles record.
Barte has had a remarkable run at
Stanford. An international relations
major from Chatsworth, Calif., Barte
attended Harvard-Westlake High
School before moving to Northern
California. At Stanford, she has been
an Ah-American in singles and dou
bles every year she's been at Stanford.
She is a two-time First Team All-Pac
-10 honoree and one-time First Team
All-Pac-10 selection.

One of her favorite personal mo
ments, though, came when she
clinched the Pac-10 title in 2008.
"We were in a dogfight at home
against UCLA and it came down to
my match and Carolyn's match,"
Barte said. "I was in the third set and
I think Carolyn was in the second. I
was up 5-3, 40-30, and I hit the
biggest serve down the T. I aced her
to win the match, win the day and
win the Pac-10 title."

She has accumulated a 103-23
overall record in singles and an 89-
27 record in doubles, including a na
tional championship with Lindsay
Burdette. She has been granted nu
merous accolades, including ITA
National Rookie of the Year and
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year in
2008, Pac-10 Player of the Year and
Pac-10 All-Academic Honorable
Mention in 2009, ITA National Play
er to Watch, Pac-10 All-Academic
Honorable Mention and NCAA
doubles champion in 2010.
The abilities of each of these
women have added to the storied
tradition of Stanford tennis. Their
time on the Farm has been well
spent so far, and with a season left,
they are out to prove what more
they can give. With only four road
games all year, this group of seniors
has the opportunity to make the
most of its time at home and fight for
a 17th NCAA championship. Even
if they don't win it again, though,
they are happy with their time here.
"Obviously tennis-wise, our goal
is to defend our championship," Yen
said. "But for me personally, I fell in
love with this program when I first
came here. I fell in love with the peo
ple, One of the things that makes me
want to go out there everyday is the
chance to be with this amazing
team."
