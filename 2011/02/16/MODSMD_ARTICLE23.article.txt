Blessed with the leadership of its three-member senior class, this
year's women's tennis team appears poised to have an impressive
run through the 2011 season. Hilary Barte, Carolyn McVeigh
and Jennifer Yen lead the Cardinal this year, and have added an
element of maturity needed to balance a large recruiting class.
Each player does her part to add to the camaraderie of the team, which has
learned to follow their lead. They have developed a vibrant personality as
a group on and off the court.
