# Unrest in the Middle East and sports
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Take a glance at the serious
news right now, and you'll
see a growing revolution
spreading across the Arab
world. The governments of
Tunisia and Egypt have already crum
bled and, emboldened by those early
successes, there have been protests
breaking out across the rest of North
Africa and the Middle East. These po
litical uprisings might all seem like a
far cry from the world of sports, but,
should the revolutionary fever
spread, its implications could quickly
spread to the back pages of the news
papers.
Many of the authoritarian regimes
that are in the cross-hairs of the pro
testers have long been friends of our
Western democracies. Though they
did not share our free and democratic
values, they instead offered stability
and relative peace in the region, so
their existences were not just tolerat

In recent years, the Gulf States
have captured some pretty big sport

Though the first two nations provide
some framework for electing certain
positions within the government,
those countries are monarchies, and
unlike in countries like the U.K. or
Spain, the royal families wield consid

When it comes to putting on a
show, the Olympics in Beijing in 2008
were a great example of what ab
solute power can achieve. Plagued by
the problems of having to continually
justify its spending and actions to the
British people, I doubt that London
will come close to its predecessor in
2012.
When FIFA selected Russia and
Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022W0r1d
Cups, respectively, it made this point
clear. Not only did it select the least
democratic countries from among the
bidding nations, but the bid team
strongly criticized the freedom of the
press in one of those rejected nations,
England. Ironically, though, while
Russian TV might be expected to ful
fill its censorship obligations, in choos
