# Unrest in the Middle East and sports
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Take a glance at the serious
news right now, and you'll
see a growing revolution
spreading across the Arab
world. The governments of
Tunisia and Egypt have already crum
bled and, emboldened by those early
successes, there have been protests
breaking out across the rest of North
Africa and the Middle East. These po
litical uprisings might all seem like a
far cry from the world of sports, but,
should the revolutionary fever
spread, its implications could quickly
spread to the back pages of the news
papers.
Many of the authoritarian regimes
that are in the cross-hairs of the pro
testers have long been friends of our
Western democracies. Though they
did not share our free and democratic
values, they instead offered stability
and relative peace in the region, so
their existences were not just tolerat
ed, but endorsed. There are some big
benefits of dealing with such govern
ments, assuming you are happy to sus
pend your morals for a bit.
In recent years, the Gulf States
have captured some pretty big sport
ing jewels. Bahrain and the UAE now
both hold annual Formula 1 races, and
Qatar infamously won the right to
host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Though the first two nations provide
some framework for electing certain
positions within the government,
those countries are monarchies, and
unlike in countries like the U.K. or
Spain, the royal families wield consid
erable power.
When it comes to putting on a
show, the Olympics in Beijing in 2008
were a great example of what ab
solute power can achieve. Plagued by
the problems of having to continually
justify its spending and actions to the
British people, I doubt that London
will come close to its predecessor in
2012.
When FIFA selected Russia and
Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022W0r1d
Cups, respectively, it made this point
clear. Not only did it select the least
democratic countries from among the
bidding nations, but the bid team
strongly criticized the freedom of the
press in one of those rejected nations,
England. Ironically, though, while
Russian TV might be expected to ful
fill its censorship obligations, in choos
ing Qatar, FIFA has probably picked
one of the strongest supporters of a
free media. The tiny gulf state is home
to Al-Jazeera, the independent news
channel that broke the mold of Arab
TV and dragged it into the 21st centu
ry. Though it has a long history of fi
nancial support from the nation's
Emir, the fact that it has continually
angered all sides is testament to its
commitment to being balanced.
It is too early to tell how many
Middle Eastern countries will be af
fected by the current revolutionary
spirit and how deep these sentiments
will run, but there have already been
protests in Algeria, Yemen, Iran and
even Bahrain. While most people
would likely expect the Gulf States to
be reasonably safe, should more gov
ernments fall, all bets might be off

What seemed like wealthy, stable and
tightly controlled countries per
fect places to hold global sporting
events may become anything but.
Even if there were a painless tran
sition to democracy, there would be
no guarantees that the people would
be quite as supportive of the dreams
and ambitions of their former rulers.
When you are a king, it is your God
given right to blow your fantastic rich
es on whatever you want; when you
are a politician, it is much harder to
justify to your electorate why their
country should be throwing so much
money away building soccer stadiums
or racetracks.

The 2022 World Cup is a great ex
ample of this, because so much money
is required to develop and build ven
ues capable of holding matches dur
ing the scorching Qatari summer.
When the final game has been played,
the population will be left with nu
merous white elephant stadiums far
in excess of the capacity needed for

the sport in such a tiny country.
It may seem like an abstract com
parison, but one can see the same
double standards in sports organiza
tions as in the rush by Western gov
ernments to praise the fledgling
democracies that are taking over the
countries that were so recently ruled
by allies. It is impossible to separate
major organized sports from politics,
especially when these tournaments
are used to strengthen a ruler's posi
tion or placate his people, or even sim
ply act as another trophy in his dubi
ously acquired treasure chest. When
FIFA complains and punishes gov
ernment intervention in a nation's
football association, we should in re
sponse question FIFA's political lean
ings and influence.
Maybe we need a revolution.
