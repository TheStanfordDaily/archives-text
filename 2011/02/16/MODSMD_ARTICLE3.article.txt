# Faculty, sophs dine at iDeclare
## Dinner part of weeklong UAR, class effort for sophomores to explore majors 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Numerous Stanford luminaries
discussed academic exploration with
small groups of students at last night's
Sophomore Faculty Dinner in Paul
Brest Hall. Political science professor
Condoleezza Rice, a former Secretary
of State and former provost at Stan
ford, delivered the keynote address,
sharing her own experiences and ex
horting attendees to explore numer
ous disciplines.
The dinner was part of iDeclare
Week, which was organized and spon
sored by the sophomore class council
to help second-year students find a
major. The class presidents teamed up
with Undergraduate Advising and

Research (UAR), another sponsor of
iDeclare week, to assist sophomores
in the declaration process.
President John Hennessy and Rev
erend Scotty McLennan, dean of reli
gious life, hosted the week's first event
on Sunday afternoon. Other events in
cluded drop-in advising sessions at the
CoHo, where UAR advisors met indi
vidually with students to help them re
fine and focus their academic trajecto
ries.
"Coming into our sophomore year,
you have to find an academic footing
and an academic home," said Shane
Hegde 'l3, one of the sophomore class
presidents. "It's a very difficult
process."

Political science professor Condoleezza Rice spoke at Tuesday's
Sophomore Faculty Dinner. The dinner was part of iDeclare, an
event aimed at encouraging sophomores to declare a major.
"We hoped, as the sophomore
class presidents, to provide an op
portunity for students to initiate
that conversation," he added. "That
has been the impetus for iDeclare
Week and that's what has been driv
ing us."
"It's really just supposed to en
able sophomores with the resources
they need to make a good choice in
declaring a major," said Jason Lu
patkin 'l3, a member of the class
cabinet.
Hegde said the number of soph
omores who have declared their
major has not declined this year. But
the last five years saw a fairly high
percentage of sophomores finishing
their second year without having
declared a major, he noted.
"We would like for students to
really have opportunities to [de
clare] earlier, so they can begin gain
ing the depth that they need within
their department," he said. "That
has been the focus of this Universi
ty, in trying to structure a means for
students to really get after their de
partments early."
Last night's dinner seated eight
students and one faculty member at
every table, a move that aimed to
foster an open discussion on a wide
range of topics not necessarily tied
to choosing or declaring a major.
The 150 available spots were gone
45 minutes after registration
opened.
The personal stories of both the
speakers and the faculty members
at the tables appeared to resonate
the most with students.
"We sought to bring in faculty
who could connect with students on
a personal level and faculty who
were very accomplished within
their field," Hedge said. "We really
want to get to the individual behind
the face and the name."
Harry Elam, vice provost for un
dergraduate education, delivered
the first address of the evening,
building on the theme of turning ac
ademic passions into a major,rather
than letting career prospects or out
side influences dictate the declara
tion process.
"The task of declaring a major is
one that should be approached ...
not so much in terms of what you'll
be doing down the line in your ca
reer ... [but] what you're interested
in, and what's going to grab you and
what's going to excite you in what
you're doing now at Stanford," he
said.
Elam went on to relate his own
undergraduate experience at Har
vard, saying he chose his major in
social studies for the "wrong rea
sons." He explained he had original
ly been determined to go to law
school, but discovered a passion for
drama during his senior year and
went on to get a doctoral degree in
drama.
Rice's keynote address touched
on similar ideas, eschewing career
prospects or parents' desires in
favor of finding and following one's
true academic calling. She also dis
cussed the importance of interac
tion between the students and facul
ty, and encouraged students to seek
out faculty members in pursuit of
their academic goals.
"I hope that, in this four years,
you will worry less about what job
you are going to get when you get
out of here... and that you will
take these four years to make sure
that you have found your passion,"
she said. "Because once you have
found your passion, nothing is ever
the same."
Rice detailed how she entered
college as a concert pianist, abrupt
ly changing her academic focus in
her junior year. She told the atten
dees how she went through a num
ber of classes before taking a class
taught by an expert on the Soviet
Union. Inspired by that experience,
she went on to major in interna
tional relations with a focus on So
viet affairs.
"For those of you that have al
ready declared majors, that's terrific
maybe that means you have
found a passion," she said. "In any
case, I hope you keep looking, be
cause sometimes, your passion finds
you, rather than the other way
around."

Numerous Stanford luminaries
discussed academic exploration with
small groups of students at last night's
Sophomore Faculty Dinner in Paul
Brest Hall. Political science professor
Condoleezza Rice, a former Secretary
of State and former provost at Stan
ford, delivered the keynote address,
sharing her own experiences and ex
horting attendees to explore numer
ous disciplines.
The dinner was part of iDeclare
Week, which was organized and spon
sored by the sophomore class council
to help second-year students find a
major. The class presidents teamed up
with Undergraduate Advising and

Research (UAR), another sponsor of
iDeclare week, to assist sophomores
in the declaration process.
President John Hennessy and Rev
erend Scotty McLennan, dean of reli
gious life, hosted the week's first event
on Sunday afternoon. Other events in
cluded drop-in advising sessions at the
CoHo, where UAR advisors met indi
vidually with students to help them re
fine and focus their academic trajecto
ries.
"Coming into our sophomore year,
you have to find an academic footing
and an academic home," said Shane
Hegde 'l3, one of the sophomore class
presidents. "It's a very difficult
process."

Political science professor Condoleezza Rice spoke at Tuesday's
Sophomore Faculty Dinner. The dinner was part of iDeclare, an
event aimed at encouraging sophomores to declare a major.
"We hoped, as the sophomore
class presidents, to provide an op
portunity for students to initiate
that conversation," he added. "That
has been the impetus for iDeclare
Week and that's what has been driv
ing us."
"It's really just supposed to en
able sophomores with the resources
they need to make a good choice in
declaring a major," said Jason Lu
patkin 'l3, a member of the class
cabinet.
Hegde said the number of soph
omores who have declared their
major has not declined this year. But
the last five years saw a fairly high
percentage of sophomores finishing
their second year without having
declared a major, he noted.
"We would like for students to
really have opportunities to [de
clare] earlier, so they can begin gain
ing the depth that they need within
their department," he said. "That
has been the focus of this Universi
ty, in trying to structure a means for
students to really get after their de
partments early."
Last night's dinner seated eight
students and one faculty member at
every table, a move that aimed to
foster an open discussion on a wide
range of topics not necessarily tied
to choosing or declaring a major.
The 150 available spots were gone
45 minutes after registration
opened.
The personal stories of both the
speakers and the faculty members
at the tables appeared to resonate
the most with students.
"We sought to bring in faculty
who could connect with students on
a personal level and faculty who
were very accomplished within
their field," Hedge said. "We really
want to get to the individual behind
the face and the name."
Harry Elam, vice provost for un
dergraduate education, delivered
the first address of the evening,
building on the theme of turning ac
ademic passions into a major,rather
than letting career prospects or out
side influences dictate the declara
tion process.
"The task of declaring a major is
one that should be approached ...
not so much in terms of what you'll
be doing down the line in your ca
reer ... [but] what you're interested
in, and what's going to grab you and
what's going to excite you in what
you're doing now at Stanford," he
said.
Elam went on to relate his own
undergraduate experience at Har
vard, saying he chose his major in
social studies for the "wrong rea
sons." He explained he had original
ly been determined to go to law
school, but discovered a passion for
drama during his senior year and
went on to get a doctoral degree in
drama.
Rice's keynote address touched
on similar ideas, eschewing career
prospects or parents' desires in
favor of finding and following one's
true academic calling. She also dis
cussed the importance of interac
tion between the students and facul
ty, and encouraged students to seek
out faculty members in pursuit of
their academic goals.
"I hope that, in this four years,
you will worry less about what job
you are going to get when you get
out of here... and that you will
take these four years to make sure
that you have found your passion,"
she said. "Because once you have
found your passion, nothing is ever
the same."
Rice detailed how she entered
college as a concert pianist, abrupt
ly changing her academic focus in
her junior year. She told the atten
dees how she went through a num
ber of classes before taking a class
taught by an expert on the Soviet
Union. Inspired by that experience,
she went on to major in interna
tional relations with a focus on So
viet affairs.
"For those of you that have al
ready declared majors, that's terrific
maybe that means you have
found a passion," she said. "In any
case, I hope you keep looking, be
cause sometimes, your passion finds
you, rather than the other way
around."
