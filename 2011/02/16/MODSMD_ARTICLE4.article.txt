## Students want in-house draw change 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Slightly more than half of students who responded
to a Residential Education (ResEd) survey indicated
they would like to see a change in the in-house draw
process. These results are part of an ongoing inquiry
by ResEd to improve the in-house draw, the aspect of
the annual Draw that is the target of most student
complaints.
In the current Draw process, students are assigned
a randomly chosen number and rank their residences
of choice online. Those with lower draw numbers are

most likely to get into their residence of choice, k
Once students are assigned to their building, it is '
up to that residence's future staff to conduct the
in-house draw, where students meet to select their
rooms.
The way in-house draws are organized is large- J
ly left up to the new staff, and the process varies
across residences. Under ResEd's proposed
changes, the in-house draw would also be done on
line.

housing, has been working to gath
er feedback on the proposed
changes since the beginning of the
school year.
"We had several town hall meet
ings and met with ASSU leadership
during autumn quarter to get feed
back on this topic," Whitney wrote
in an e-mail to The Daily. "We
added these questions to the survey
to gather input from a broader au
dience."
The questions were part of the
annual housing survey, which also
asked students questions about the
quality of the services provided in
their residences. A total of 3,922
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents completed the housing sur
vey. Only respondents who had par
ticipated in the Draw current
sophomores, juniors and seniors
were asked to answer the question
about the in-house draw. Of those,
900 filled out responses to the ques
tions, and slightly more than half of
that number favored changing the
in-house draw.

Students seemed split in their
opinions about the potential
change. Irteza Binte-Farid 'l3, a
Toyon resident, said she supported
the possibility of doing room selec
tion online.
Binte-Farid's main complaint
about the in-house draw process
was the large amount of time some
residents took to choose their
rooms. Some residents, she said,
chose their rooms more slowly be
cause they were unfamiliar with the
process, delaying the entire process
for other residents.
"I think it would be less compli
cated than the current system, for
sure," Binte-Farid said. "It would be
more streamlined if it's online."
Others, however, were skeptical
of any improvement the new sys
tem could bring.
"It could be better, but I feel like
you'd spend just as much time
doing that one because you'd be
looking at all the rooms online,"
Toyon Resident Assistant (RA)
Wesley Dunnagan 'l2 said.
"I don't think I would like that
better," he added.
Whitney also noted a conflict be
tween the request for changing the
process and some of the students'
responses to additional questions

about the in-house draw.
"The survey indicated that stu
dents value the in-house draw
meetings as an opportunity to se
lect roommates, meet others from
the house and become familiar with
specific room spaces in the house,"
Whitney said.
Binte-Farid expressed ambiva
lent feelings about transitioning to
an online, in-house Draw.
"There is something to be said
about meeting your new neighbors
face to face," she said. "So maybe if
they compensated for that by hav
ing other gatherings or something,
then that would be fun."
Though this year's Draw will not
include a process through which
students can select their rooms on
line, Whitney said that option may
be available in the future. In the
meantime, ResEd will continue to
research how it can improve the
Draw process.
"We will continue to work to
gether to consider what parts of the
current Housing and Residential
Education processes to keep and
what might be improved [and] con
nected differently," Whitney said.
