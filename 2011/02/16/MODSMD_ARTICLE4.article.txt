## Students want in-house draw change 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Slightly more than half of students who responded
to a Residential Education (ResEd) survey indicated
they would like to see a change in the in-house draw
process. These results are part of an ongoing inquiry
by ResEd to improve the in-house draw, the aspect of
the annual Draw that is the target of most student
complaints.
In the current Draw process, students are assigned
a randomly chosen number and rank their residences
of choice online. Those with lower draw numbers are

most likely to get into their residence of choice, k
Once students are assigned to their building, it is '
up to that residence's future staff to conduct the
in-house draw, where students meet to select their
rooms.
The way in-house draws are organized is large- J
ly left up to the new staff, and the process varies
across residences. Under ResEd's proposed
changes, the in-house draw would also be done on
line.
