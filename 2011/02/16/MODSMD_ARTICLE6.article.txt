## Senate confirms Cruz nomination to VP position Constitutional Council rules also passed to clarify hearing process 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After achieving quorum half an hour late due
to senators attending the sophomore faculty din
ner, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate passed
four bills Tuesday. The bills amended the rules of
order of the Constitutional Council, instituted a

Senate transition, reformed the special fees
process and confirmed Senate Chair Michael
Cruz 'l2 as ASSU Vice President.
ASSU Executive Angelina Cardona 'll nom
inated Cruz Monday to replace Kelsei Wharton
'l2, who resigned after taking a leave of absence
following a bike accident at the beginning of the
quarter. After confirming Cruz as vice president,
the Senate opted to determine a new chair and
deputy chair to take office if the Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC) confirms Cruz today. Made
line Hawes 'l3 ran unopposed for chair and was
elected unanimously by a role call vote, Pat
Bruny 'l3 and Deepa Kannappan 'l3 ran for

deputy chair. Bruny was selected nine to five in a
closed ballot vote, with Cruz abstaining.
For Cruz to assume the role as vice president,
and for Hawes and Bruny to assume their new re
sponsibilities, the GSC must approve Cardona's
nomination with two-thirds consent.

The GSC will also likely vote today on the
special fees reform legislation passed Tuesday.
The Senate adopted a friendly amendment by
GSC members to the bill, stipulating that the
ASSU financial manager shall remind student
group leaders of the private nature of informa-
tion released about students who re
quest special fees refunds.
The Senate also passed a bill
amending the rules of order of the
Constitutional Council Tuesday.
Council member Mateo Wilmott 'll
stressed that, prior to Tuesday's bill,
very little guiding structure existed
to direct the Constitutional Council
in hearing cases.
"It was chaotic, really," he said.
All members of the Constitution
al Council stayed at Tuesday's meet
ing to participate in the discussion of
a bill on previous notice to "more
properly define the role of the
ASSU solicitors general."
Solicitor general Adam Adler 'l2
described the bill as similar to that to
amend the rules of order of the Con
stitutional Council as a mecha
nism to make filing cases concerning
actions by the ASSU easier for the
average student.
Members of the Constitutional
Council said the bill oversteps it
bounds.
Samir Siddhanti 'l2 likened the
bill to "a group of lawyers defining
how a courtroom is run."
Both bodies, at the suggestion of

the senators, agreed to meet in the
coming week to reach a compro
mise.
The Appropriations Committee,
after receiving nominations, mo
tioned for the Senate to give the "fi
nancial officer of the year" award to
Van Anh Tran 'l3, financial officer of
the Stanford Asian American Stu
dents' Association (SAASA). Ap
propriations Chair Rafael Vazquez
praised Tran's work and the Senate
agreed unanimously to grant her the

award.
Cardona announced at Tuesday's
meeting that her State of the Associ
ation Address will take place at 6
p.m. on Tuesday, March 8.
Amid the discussion about elect
ing a new Senate chair and deputy
chair and subsequent shifting of re
sponsibility, it was announced that
Carolyn Simmons 'l3 and Ben
Jensen 'l2 will be spending spring
quarter abroad, in Santiago and
Berlin, respectively. They will be the
last senators to spend a quarter
abroad while in office, due to legisla
tion passed last year prohibiting
study abroad for senators beginning
next year.
Advocacy committee chair
Robin Perani 'l3 is organizing for
and encouraging all of the senators
to get tested for STIs at Vaden on
Friday afternoon, as a model for the
entire student body.
"We're doing it for the whole
Stanford community," Perani said.
Showly Wang 'l3 also came by to
encourage the senators to attend the
Vagina Monologues. As promised,
she gave members of the Appropri
ations Committee free tickets to ex
press her appreciation.
All funding bills for the evening
were passed.
