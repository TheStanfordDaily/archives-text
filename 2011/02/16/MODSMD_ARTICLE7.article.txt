## Hecker seeks change in Korea policy Lecture recounts visit to nuclear facilities in Dec. 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
Last spring, Martin Hellman, pro
fessor emeritus of electrical engi
neering, organized a public lecture
series titled "Defusing the Nuclear
Threat," with the goal of educating
the campus community about the
risks associated with nuclear
weapons.
The lectures were held at Hewlett
Training Center and attracted 50 to
200 attendees each. Most of those
lecture-goers, however, came from
off-campus.
"It's hard to get students out of
their dorms to the teaching center,"
Hellman said. "So if the students
won't come to the mountain, we'll
bring the mountain to the students."
The solution? Bring the speakers
to the dorm, Hellman said.
That's what happened Tuesday
night when Siegfried Hecker, co-di
rector of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Cooperation
(CISAC) and professor of manage
ment science and engineering,
spoke at Florence Moore Hall's
lounge. Hecker was the first speak
er in a three-part series that ad
dresses possible ways of eliminating
the threat of nuclear weapons.
Hecker, a former director of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory,
focused his talk on what actions the
United States could take to deal
with North Korea's nuclear pro
gram.
He provided a brief history of
the diplomatic relations between
the two countries, and described his
most recent trip to North Korea,
which received significant media
attention last November when
Hecker returned with news that the
country had built a state-of-the-art
uranium enrichment facility.
"It was shockingly modern,"
Hecker said. "Everything else I had
seen in North Korea's nuclear facil
ities looked like [it was built in the]
sixties, Russian-style or forties,
fifties American-style. But this
thing was modern."
Prior to the trip, he suspected
North Korea had performed urani

the country would only have a
dozen centrifuges. He ended up
seeing 2,000.
"It literally blew my mind,"
Hecker said.
However, he emphasized that
this was not a discovery, as it has
been portrayed in the press, but
rather the culmination of six years
of relationship building.
Hecker has visited North Korea
every year since 2004.
"It wasn't a shot in the dark that
we discovered; it came from six pre
vious visits," he said. "We had paved
the way with them. They trusted us
to tell the truth, to report those ob
servations truthfully. And we did."
Hecker also showed pictures
from his previous visits a girl
standing by a kiosk, adults walking
down the street carrying cell
phones —in hopes of dispelling
common misconceptions about
North Korea.
Hecker indicated that the real
threat behind North Korea's nu
clear program isn't necessarily a
nuclear attack, but an accidental
mishap or the export of this tech
nology to another country.
Instead of pushing for com
plete denuclearization of the
North, an approach the U.S. has
taken in the past, he suggested
that we work to improve our rela
tionship with the country through
a plan he called "three no's for one
yes."
During his visits, Hecker be
lieved North Korea would agree
to not build any more bombs, not
improve any of the bombs they
currently have and not export any
more nuclear technology. In re
turn, the U.S. would be obligated
to address the fundamental inse
curities in the country.
"Unless we understand North
Korea more broadly, and not just
through the typical U.S. nuclear
lenses, then we are never going to
be able to roll back and solve the
North Korea nuclear program," he
said.
But Hecker saw hope for a
bright future. This hope, he said,
came in the form of a boy wearing a
baseball cap turned backwards.
"He's probably about 11 years
old," Hecker said. "Do you think
when he's 21 years old they are
going to keep him from everything
like they are people from now?
There's no way."
Even though yesterday's event
was held in a dorm, there was still a
strong showing of non-students.
"I must say in the five years I've
been here at Stanford, it seemed to
be that the students keep getting
younger every year," Hecker said.
"I must say, tonight is a bit of an ex
ception."
The lecture series will contin
ue next Tuesday when Barton
Bernstein, professor emeritus of
history, will discuss the meaning
of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the
Florence Moore lounge at 7:30
p.m.

yes."
During his visits, Hecker be
lieved North Korea would agree
to not build any more bombs, not
improve any of the bombs they
currently have and not export any
more nuclear technology. In re
turn, the U.S. would be obligated
to address the fundamental inse
curities in the country.
"Unless we understand North
Korea more broadly, and not just
through the typical U.S. nuclear
lenses, then we are never going to
be able to roll back and solve the
North Korea nuclear program," he
said.
But Hecker saw hope for a
bright future. This hope, he said,
came in the form of a boy wearing a
baseball cap turned backwards.
"He's probably about 11 years
old," Hecker said. "Do you think
when he's 21 years old they are
going to keep him from everything
like they are people from now?
There's no way."
Even though yesterday's event
was held in a dorm, there was still a
strong showing of non-students.
"I must say in the five years I've
been here at Stanford, it seemed to
be that the students keep getting
younger every year," Hecker said.
"I must say, tonight is a bit of an ex
ception."
The lecture series will contin
ue next Tuesday when Barton
Bernstein, professor emeritus of
history, will discuss the meaning
of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the
Florence Moore lounge at 7:30
p.m.
