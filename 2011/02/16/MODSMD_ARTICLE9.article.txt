lion.
The design includes basketball
courts, lockers, showers and fitness,
wellness and recreation spaces. It

tion is planned to begin this summer
and conclude in September 2012.
SAL 3, a climate-controlled stor
age facility located in Livermore,
will double its storage capacity from

umes under this new plan.The proj
ect will cost $14.8 million. SAL 3

versity library system and serves
both the main campus and Hopkins
Marine Station Library.
Construction is expected to begin
in fall 2011 and finish in the fall of
2012, pending the project's design
approval in April and its combined

project and construction approval in
June.
