## SEEING GREEN The 						Climate (Dis) Connection 
### Holly Moeller 
Few people embody scientific
glamour more than my friend
Jeff who dropped in two weeks
ago on his way home from a two
month research mission in Antarcti
ca. Aboard Swedish and American
ships, Jeff towed an underwater cam
era recording footage of the Southern
Ocean sea floor. So, in addition to de
rigueur snapshots of Adelie penguins
and towering icebergs, Jeff has a col
lection of king crab portraits.
The problem is that the crabs
aren't supposed to be there.
The hefty claws of the king crab
are more familiar to your dinner plate
than they are to animals on the
Antarctic sea floor, which have
evolved thinner shells and exposed
juicy body parts over 40 million years
in the absence of crabs. Now, warming
ocean temperatures (increased by
nearly two degrees Fahrenheit in re
cent years) have allowed crab popu
lations to creep pole-ward into waters
once too cold for their metabolisms,
nearing shelf waters where they can
decimate the local community.
Most of us are more familiar with
invasive species introduced directly
by humans, like cane toads, zebra
mussels or, here in California, the
mighty eucalyptus. Indeed, the most
worrisome predictor of the Southern
Ocean's future comes from Norway,
where scientists introduced the red
king crab (hoping to produce a fish
ery rivaling Alaska's "deadliest
catch"). Today, the crabs expand their
range by 50 km per year the dis
tance between Stanford and San
Francisco clear-cutting the seabed
as they advance.
But today, climate change
whether you ascribe to its anthro
pogenic drivers or not (hint: you
should) —is boosting temperatures
and shifting rainfall patterns, produc
ing dramatic changes in "natural"
communities as plants and animals
adjust ranges and behaviors to com
pensate.
Biological responses come in sev
eral forms. First, as Jeff and the
Antarctic crab team observed, warm
ing temperatures can drive species in

vasion. Second, climate change can
shrink habitat. That's the hypothesis
behind worries over polar bears,
which hunt on dwindling ice pack,
and emperor penguins, whose mor
tality spikes during low-ice years.
Third, climate change can alter an or
ganism's phenology the timing of
its life history events, like mating or
flowering by shifting environmen
tal cues relative to the calendar year.
Such changes decouple delicate
ecological balances fine-tuned over
millennia. Spring arrives earlier and
autumn later. Birds, whose migra
tions are often timed to capture a rich
spring insect boom, are among the
hardest hit: a recent study of 100 Eu
ropean migrant birds found that birds
that weren't heading north sooner
had declining populations. But some
species,able to jump-start their clocks
with the shifting season, were doing
better than ever.
Closer to home in North America,
vast tracts of dying trees herald the
climatic release of native insect pests.
The spruce beetle can now complete
its life cycle in one year instead of two,
so its population boom is decimating
Alaskan forestry stands. The moun
tain pine beetle, which has devastated
25 million hectares of trees in Canada
and the U.S. Rocky Mountains in the
last decade, is also enjoying warmer,
drier conditions which weaken the
defenses of the trees it drills.
Of course, the relationships be
tween these shifts and climate change
are not always clean. Yes, in the lab we
can show that many organisms grow
faster under higher temperatures.
And the changes we're witnessing are
generally consistent with the predic
tions we'd make based on climate fac

tors. But, as any scientist will tell you,
in the real world biology is messy.
As with Europe's birds, different
species can adapt and shift ranges
at different rates. Some will bene
fit from the new conditions —at
least for now. Others will be left be
hind, or not be affected at all. All, of
course, still face a multitude of other
threats: habitat loss, overfishing, pol
lution, ocean acidification, and so
forth.
How do these issues compare to
climate change? In combination,
they are certainly wreaking havoc on
the world as we know it. In my mind,
the more pressing worry is this: How
fast can humanity adapt, and what
critical parts of our earthly life sup

port system will we succeed in sav
ing?
On Jeff's last day in California, we
drive north to Muir Woods, trailing
carbon dioxide emissions behind us,
to the place where the redwoods
stand hundreds of feet tall and hun
dreds of years old. Here, in this cathe
dral of light and shadow, the world
stands still for just a moment. I try to
forget that fog feeds these forests
during the dry months (providing 40
percent of the trees' annual water
supply) and that fog frequency is
down 30 percent in the last half-cen
tury (most likely due to climate
change). Because these forests are
part of my life support system, and I
cannot imagine a world without
them.
