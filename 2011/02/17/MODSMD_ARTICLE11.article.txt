# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Indie Music Is on (Arcade) Fire 
### Shane Savitsky 
Text from a good friend of
mine on Monday afternoon:
"So did you wet yourself
when Arcade Fire won last night?"
My response: "The Grammys are
so mainstream, dude."
As you may know. Arcade Fire's
"The Suburbs" won the Grammy
Award for Album of the Year on
Sunday night. The win was a mas
sive coup for the independent music
scene, especially since the nomina
tion alone was considered some
thing of a surprise. You could tell it
was a big deal when my Twitter feed
absolutely exploded in the space of
about four and a half minutes. Even
Kanye got in on the action, saying,
"Arcade fire!!!!!!!!!! There is
hope!!! I feel like we all won when
something like this happens!"
It goes without saying that I've
been a huge Arcade Fire fan for the
past half-decade. Their three al
bums stand among my all-time fa
vorites. I finally saw them live in Big
Sur in October at a 300 capacity
show. It changed my life. They're
that good, so the shocked reaction
from the general public kind of took
me by surprise. Were they that
much of a long shot? Furthermore,
did anyone even look at their com
petition for Album of the Year? To
refresh your memory: Lady Gaga,
Eminem, Lady Antebellum, and
Katy Perry. Just for reference, here's
a bit of the chorus from Katy Perry's
"Peacock": "Come on, baby, let me
see what you're hiding underneath /
I wanna see your peacock, cock,
cock / Your peacock, cock." I'm re
ally not making that up. According
to the Grammy Awards, that song
was part of one of the five best al
bums of the year. When you throw
in the fact that a documentary
about Justin Bieber grossed over
$3O million at the box office this
weekend, my only response is:
"America, you scare me some
times."

I know that my feelings about
music don't really correlate with
those of the general public. (My ob
session with Kesha remains a no
table exception.) As a fan of indie

music, I tend to listen to artists who
are lesser known by definition. Yet
this Arcade Fire thing continues to
confound me. They sold out two
consecutive nights at Madison
Square Garden last summer one
of which was simulcast on Youtube!
They're kind of a big deal, but be
cause their music isn't played on
Top 40 radio stations, they remain
unknown to a huge portion of the
general public.
Arcade Fire isn't the only indie
artist making big news these days
either. Another of my favorite
bands, LCD Soundsystem, an
nounced that they would play their
farewell show at Madison Square
Garden in early April. Considering
I'll be home for a long pre-Oxford
spring break at that point, I figured
I would try to get tickets. No dice.
Somehow they managed to sell out
the Garden in the space of roughly
10 seconds. Once again, my Twitter
feed was blown up. Theories
abound that ticket brokers some
how rigged the Ticketmaster sale.
Whatever the case may be, I didn't
get any tickets. Truly heartbreaking,
I know.
I don't mean any of this as some
sort of snobbish hipster critique on
mainstream recognition for my fa
vorite bands. I'm not going to stop
listening to Arcade Fire because
they won a Grammy. (I don't think I
can really talk, considering the Ar
cade Fire poster on my dorm wall is
hanging next to a Taylor Swift one.)
Instead, what I'm trying to say is
that the rise of the Internet has
started to blur the line between
"hip" and "mainstream" and it's
all for the better. Flopefully the ini
tial confusion and backlash by the
