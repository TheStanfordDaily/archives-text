## Ciao Italia! 
### Johnny Bartz 
Perhaps it was last weekend's
memorable Casa party, or just
nostalgia of my freshman year,
but this week I'm sharing my first
foray into spontaneous international
travel. My upperclass partner-in
crime had gone abroad to Florence,
and one day while in my sad and de
ranged state mourning her loss, I
serendipitously came across a very
cheap flight to Florence. My room
mate certainly thought I was crazy,
but his approving "go for it, Johnny"
was all I needed. Logically, I booked
the flight right in the middle of the
quarter Valentine's Day week
end. Soon enough my phone was
"lost," I came down with a "really
bad cold" and I winged my way
across the Atlantic for some wine,
gnocchi and gelato.
I'll never forget that memorable
flight to Munich on a Lufthansa
A346. I had pulled an all-nighter
right before in order to finish up
some assignments, or maybe I was
"getting on Europe time," of course
warranting an extra bout of "social
izing." If you show up exhausted to a
long-haul flight, you'll be more like
ly to sleep, right? Just be sure to stay
awake for the meal service!
I was a bit taken aback when I
was greeted in German upon em
barking the aircraft. Was my Ger
man heritage fooling this flight
crew? Or perhaps it was the flair of
my European style. Regardless, I
nodded, pretending to know exactly
what the flight attendants were say

ing, and played along with their
game. Later, I flawlessly ordered ein
bier. Knowing fully well the need to
rehydrate in the dry cabin air condi
tions, I ordered wasser. There is a
choice of waters? Remember Ger
man conversation class, Johnny!
Ahh of course mineralwasser
bittel Huge mistake. Sparkling water

not the most rehydrating. Not los
ing face, I pretended as if sparkling
water were exactly what I had want
ed, all the while growing ever thirsti
er. Let's just say that after 11 hours of
this behavior the descent and re
pressurization was less than pleas
ant. Stupid freshman Johnny.
Upon arrival in Florence it was
night, I overcame my fear of taxi

drivers, attempted phoning my
friend to no avail, and yet, soon with
crisp Euros in hand and a less crisp
Google printout map, I met my
friend for a glass of Chianti on the
Duomo steps. What I was thinking
not bringing a jacket to Europe in
February, I may never know, but
after a few days and the acquisition
of a quintessentially Italian puff
jacket with fur collar, I "walked and
talked" like a "local."*
*(Just my perception, not actually
true).
Florence is small, so in a couple of
days you can hit up all the must sees
sweeping views from the top the
Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, the Medici
palace, Galileo's house, kiss your
sweetheart in the Boboli Garden.
Leave a bit of staring time at the Uf
fizi's Botticellis, not to mention the
required appreciation of the mascu
line beauty of Michelangelo's David
at the Galleria dell'Accademia. Note
that the Academia, as well as many
other museums, is closed on Mon
days. A free and always open gallery
of Renaissance sculptures is the Log
gia del Lanzi in the Piazza della Sig
noria. Be sure to check out my fa
vorite work Rape of the Sabine
Woman from a variety of angles.

You can easily and cheaply subsist
on gelato and panini.
Head up to Venice, just a few
hours by train, and lose yourself in
the fairytale land amongst candy
cane striped poles, bridges, and
canals. Water taxis are great, but be
sure you know exactly which one
you're supposed to get on! The
Modern Art museum is awesome.
Browse Venetian glass shops, but re
member it's tacky to take too many
pictures. If you go during carnevale,
be prepared to don a mask, ball
gown or cape, and revel in the carni
valesque celebration. Remember:
no white socks, tennis shoes or
shorts. The dress code is always
trendy chic. Scarves in the winter are
a must. If it's sunny, you should prob
ably invest in a pair of brightly col
ored sunglasses, but try not to pay

more than 5. Also, as I've learned,
don't jump into other people's "pea
cock displays." Yes, I was wearing my
lime green one-piece ski suit with a
Brazilian flag cape. No, the sparkly
purple-feathered person did not
particularly appreciate my jumping
in front, diverting the tourist atten
tion unto myself. I can only imagine
the look of disgust below that white
porcelain mask.
Power trips may be short, but they
are exciting, if you are up to the chal
lenge. I'm still happy with my deci
sion to go to Italy as a birthday pres
ent instead of throwing an insane
birthday party for myself Yes, consid
ering my naivete, my trip should have
been a disaster, but working against
the odds, I learned some travel les
sons that hopefully you won't have
to. In the end I ended up dancing in a
club alongside Coolio, which I con
sider an epic win.

Perhaps it was last weekend's
memorable Casa party, or just
nostalgia of my freshman year,
but this week I'm sharing my first
foray into spontaneous international
travel. My upperclass partner-in
crime had gone abroad to Florence,
and one day while in my sad and de
ranged state mourning her loss, I
serendipitously came across a very
cheap flight to Florence. My room
mate certainly thought I was crazy,
but his approving "go for it, Johnny"
was all I needed. Logically, I booked
the flight right in the middle of the
quarter Valentine's Day week
end. Soon enough my phone was
"lost," I came down with a "really
bad cold" and I winged my way
across the Atlantic for some wine,
gnocchi and gelato.
I'll never forget that memorable
flight to Munich on a Lufthansa
A346. I had pulled an all-nighter
right before in order to finish up
some assignments, or maybe I was
"getting on Europe time," of course
warranting an extra bout of "social
izing." If you show up exhausted to a
long-haul flight, you'll be more like
ly to sleep, right? Just be sure to stay
awake for the meal service!
I was a bit taken aback when I
was greeted in German upon em
barking the aircraft. Was my Ger
man heritage fooling this flight
crew? Or perhaps it was the flair of
my European style. Regardless, I
nodded, pretending to know exactly
what the flight attendants were say

ing, and played along with their
game. Later, I flawlessly ordered ein
bier. Knowing fully well the need to
rehydrate in the dry cabin air condi
tions, I ordered wasser. There is a
choice of waters? Remember Ger
man conversation class, Johnny!
Ahh of course mineralwasser
bittel Huge mistake. Sparkling water

not the most rehydrating. Not los
ing face, I pretended as if sparkling
water were exactly what I had want
ed, all the while growing ever thirsti
er. Let's just say that after 11 hours of
this behavior the descent and re
pressurization was less than pleas
ant. Stupid freshman Johnny.
Upon arrival in Florence it was
night, I overcame my fear of taxi

drivers, attempted phoning my
friend to no avail, and yet, soon with
crisp Euros in hand and a less crisp
Google printout map, I met my
friend for a glass of Chianti on the
Duomo steps. What I was thinking
not bringing a jacket to Europe in
February, I may never know, but
after a few days and the acquisition
of a quintessentially Italian puff
jacket with fur collar, I "walked and
talked" like a "local."*
*(Just my perception, not actually
true).
Florence is small, so in a couple of
days you can hit up all the must sees
sweeping views from the top the
Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, the Medici
palace, Galileo's house, kiss your
sweetheart in the Boboli Garden.
Leave a bit of staring time at the Uf
fizi's Botticellis, not to mention the
required appreciation of the mascu
line beauty of Michelangelo's David
at the Galleria dell'Accademia. Note
that the Academia, as well as many
other museums, is closed on Mon
days. A free and always open gallery
of Renaissance sculptures is the Log
gia del Lanzi in the Piazza della Sig
noria. Be sure to check out my fa
vorite work Rape of the Sabine
Woman from a variety of angles.

You can easily and cheaply subsist
on gelato and panini.
Head up to Venice, just a few
hours by train, and lose yourself in
the fairytale land amongst candy
cane striped poles, bridges, and
canals. Water taxis are great, but be
sure you know exactly which one
you're supposed to get on! The
Modern Art museum is awesome.
Browse Venetian glass shops, but re
member it's tacky to take too many
pictures. If you go during carnevale,
be prepared to don a mask, ball
gown or cape, and revel in the carni
valesque celebration. Remember:
no white socks, tennis shoes or
shorts. The dress code is always
trendy chic. Scarves in the winter are
a must. If it's sunny, you should prob
ably invest in a pair of brightly col
ored sunglasses, but try not to pay

more than 5. Also, as I've learned,
don't jump into other people's "pea
cock displays." Yes, I was wearing my
lime green one-piece ski suit with a
Brazilian flag cape. No, the sparkly
purple-feathered person did not
particularly appreciate my jumping
in front, diverting the tourist atten
tion unto myself. I can only imagine
the look of disgust below that white
porcelain mask.
Power trips may be short, but they
are exciting, if you are up to the chal
lenge. I'm still happy with my deci
sion to go to Italy as a birthday pres
ent instead of throwing an insane
birthday party for myself Yes, consid
ering my naivete, my trip should have
been a disaster, but working against
the odds, I learned some travel les
sons that hopefully you won't have
to. In the end I ended up dancing in a
club alongside Coolio, which I con
sider an epic win.
