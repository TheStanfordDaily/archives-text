# OP-ED
## It's all fun and games... until you call it a Fiesta 
### DIANA MARQUEZ DE LA TORRE '11 
I opened my email Tuesday and
read "Fiesta at Men's Basket
ball." My gut instinct told me to
ignore the email, or delete it, but I
gave it the benefit of the doubt, and
opened it anyway. Was I surprised by
what I saw? Not really, but I was def
initely disappointed. Of course the
Sixth Man Club would be hosting a
taco bar, and they would be handing
out free sombreros before the bas
ketball game what else could "fi
esta" mean?
It may seem inconsequential.
After all, it is just a themed celebra

tion like any other. But it's really not.
Hosting parties and events centered
around ethnic and racial traditions
can easily turn into disrespectful
gatherings. What happens when
someone shows up to the event in a
poncho? A fake Pancho Villa mous
tache? Singing la cucaracha? Flash
ing a green card? Or doing that stu
pid sound people make when they
try to imitate Speedy Gonzalez?
The line between offensive and
just-for-fun is blurry and I expect
more thoughtfulness from the Stan
ford Athletics Department and the

Sixth Man Club. Events like this lead
to problems like last year's "Comp
ton Cookout" in UCSD where stu
dents dressed up in chains and ate
chicken and watermelon to cele
brate Black History Month. Similar
ly, a lesser-known incident occurred
at a "Taco and Tequila Party" at the
University of Illinois, where students
arrived at the party dressed up as
pregnant girls and illegal aliens. This
type of event is an open invitation
for students to celebrate negative
stereotypes and showcase their ig
norance about other peoples' tradi
tions and cultures.
I don't know what the Sixth Man
Club was thinking when they decid
ed that hosting a "fiesta" would be a
good marketing strategy to bring
out basketball fans. Even more trou
bling is the fact that someone from
Stanford University's Athletic De
partment had to approve of the
party in order for it to be sent out in
their official student newsletter. I
don't know if the Sixth Man Club
also got an approval from the Stu
dent Activities and Leadership
(SAL) office for this event, but as
they are a registered student group,

I expect that they did. How can the
same office that finds a party named
Hot Prowl offensive not think the
same about a taco and sombrero
pregame called a Fiesta? Next time,
I suggest sticking to less controver
sial themes.
I know tacos are delicious and
easy to serve to large crowds, but
using my culture to celebrate some
thing completely outside of its tradi
tions is insensitive. Why can't you
serve tacos and call it a pregame? Is
it necessary to include sombreros, a
traditional garb of my people, and
call the event a Fiesta? The theme is
completely unnecessary and cheap
ens the culture of many Spanish
speaking countries.
And don't even get me started on
Cinco de Mayo ...
