## CARDINAL BASEBALL ON THE ROAD AGAIN Stanford heads to Houston to start 2011 race for Omaha 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
With a full starting rotation returning and
an elite recruiting class coming to the Farm
for a second straight year, Stanford baseball
will begin its season with high hopes in a
three-game series at Rice this Friday
through Sunday.
After finishing fourth in a strong Pac-10
Conference in 2010, the squad will try to im
prove on last season's 31-25 record.
Though Stanford finished out of the final
rankings after dropping its first two games in
last year's NCAA Regionals at Cal State
Fullerton, the Cardinal begins the season
ranked No. 16 nationally in the USA Today
Coaches Poll.
The team is not quick to buy into the high
preseason marks, however.
"I think that this early in the season, it's

hard to tell which teams are going to be
good," said senior catcher Zach Jones. "The
worst season that we've had since I've been
here, we were ranked in the top 10 [before
the season], and ended up not even making
the playoffs."
This year's optimistic ranking is in part
due to Stanford's incoming freshman class,
which Baseball America considers best in
the country. Among the highly touted new
comers are outfielder Austin Wilson, utility
man Brian Ragira, pitcher AJ. Vanegas and
infielder Danny Diekroeger, whose older
brother, sophomore Kenny Diekroeger, led
the Cardinal in batting average (.336) and
RBIs (41) last year.
At Bay Area Media Day on Feb. 3, head
coach Mark Marquess indicated that Ragira
and Wilson will have opportunities to play in
starting roles early on.
Despite the new group of impact players

joining the team, Jones doesn't expect chem
istry to be an issue.
"We mesh really well together," he said.
"The nice thing about Stanford is that every
one lives on campus, so we see a lot of each
other on the field and off the field. We've
gotten pretty close over these past five or six
months that we've been together."
The incoming freshmen will help fill a
strong lineup that consists almost entirely of
returning sophomores, a group Baseball
America ranked as the second-best recruit
ing class before last season.
Because of the Cardinal's skilled
younger players, Jones will likely be Stan
ford's only upperclassman position player
on the field.
"I've had to take more of a leadership
role this year and lead by example," Jones
said. "A lot of the guys coming in didn't
know the system, and how we play, and what
the coaches expect of us."
The Cardinal pitching staff is also fairly
young. Alex Pratcher, who led Stanford with
six wins in 25 relief appearances in 2010,
joins reliever Danny Sandbrink as one of
only two seniors. Stanford's starting rotation
does boast two juniors, Brett Mooneyham
and Jordan Pries, who pitched exclusively as
starters last season.
Marquess expects experience to be key,
as pitching is bound to be a large factor in the
tightly packed Pac-10.
"There's one strong favorite, and that's
UCLA, and that's basically because of their
Friday and Saturday pitchers," Marquess
said at Media Day. "[Juniors] Gerrit Cole
and Trevor Bauer are as good as they get.
Nobody's going to match them on Friday
and Saturday. They're the two best college
pitchers in the country and they're on the

same team."
In the preseason coaches' poll, Stanford
was picked second behind UCLA in the
Pac-10, which featured eight different teams
in the postseason last year.
"We were all deserving —we were all
ranked number-one or number-two seeds
for the most part," Marquess told the media.
"We had two teams in the College World Se
ries: UCLA and Arizona State. It was as
strong as the league has ever been, and to be
honest with you, it's probably as strong, if not
stronger, this year."
Stanford won't start playing Pac-10
games regularly until the beginning of
April, but the Cardinal will face arch-rival
Cal in the home opener next Tuesday at
5:30 p.m.
The Cardinal went 3-1 against Cal last
season, sweeping the Golden Bears in a
three-game series at Sunken Diamond in
April. But this year's Cal team likely in its
final season after budgetary issues have
forced the athletic department to cut base
ball as a varsity sport —is determined to
make the most of its opportunities in 2011.
