# INDOOR CHALLENGE
## 
### CHRISSY JONES 
With a still-perfect record and
good momentum coming off a 7-0
victory over Southern Methodist
University the Stanford women's
tennis team heads to Charlottesville,
Va. this weekend to compete in the
2011 ITA National Women's Team
Indoor Championships.
The Cardinal (5-0, 0-0 Pac-10)
looks to capture victories over other
top-ranked programs that it typically
does not face during the regular sea
son.
Currently ranked at No. 1, the
Cardinal will play as the top seed in
this weekend's indoor champi
onship, where it will be joined by a
slew of nationally ranked foes, with
14 of the top 25 teams coming to Vir
ginia.
Senior Hilary Barte was excited
about the strong competition.
"The fact that the schools we play,
such as Florida, UNC and Duke, all
have extremely high caliber teams is
very exciting, and at the same time
challenging," Barte said. "It's basical
ly going to be similar to the NCAA
tournament. I think it will improve
our team to get this practice earlier in
the season."
The tournament will begin with
16 top-tier teams and will be con
ducted in a typical dual match for
mat, with a group of three doubles
matches counting for one point, and
six singles matches counting for one
point each.
But there is one major factor dif
ferentiating this tournament from
the Cardinal's usual matches.
"We have been practicing indoors
the last couple of days, both because
of the dreary weather and because
the tournament is, of course, in
doors," McVeigh said. "The ball trav
els faster without wind and outside
conditions, so we've been hitting in
side to get most closely acquainted
with the different conditions."
"We have been focusing on both
doubles as well as real point situa
tions in preparation," Barte added.
"As always, we are looking to im
prove individually and as a team
week-in and week-out."
However, the fast-paced condi
tions might help the Cardinal, which

McVeigh describes as a "typically ag
gressive team dependent on deep,
powerfully hit balls."
McVeigh describes her personal
style as more of a counterpunch
strategy anyway.
"I tend to play relatively far be
hind the baseline and counterpunch
more, with higher elevation on my
