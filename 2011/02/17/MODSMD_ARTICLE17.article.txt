# I have a dream...that all fans are created equal

### Jacob Jaffe 
Why do you like one
team more than
any other?
It's a simple question for any
level of sports fan, yet the number of
reasonable responses is staggering.
Everyone has a favorite team, and
most sports fans have several fa
vorites across multiple sports. Clear
ly it's something we all do.
So, why?
The most common response is
something like "I grew up there."
Obviously, this makes a lot of sense:
if you grow up in Boston, you're a lot
more likely to root for the Red Sox
than the Royals. Advertisements
are all around you, the stadium is
nearby, the games are televised.
Why not root for them?
I can certainly relate to this phe
nomenon, having spent the first 18

years of my life in Southern Califor
nia. The first baseball games I ever
went to were Angels games, and I've
rooted for them for as long as I can
remember since the days of
Chuck Finley, Gary DiSarcina, Jim
Edmonds, blue uniforms and every
one recognizing that Anaheim is not
Los Angeles. I have never wavered
on this, and I cannot imagine ever
switching allegiances, no matter
how many Bay Area fans stop talk
ing to me when I mention 2002.

The location-based reasoning has
several corollaries like, "I live in Pitts
burgh, but my dad's always been a big
Giants fan," "I'm from Seattle, but my
family is all from Dallas, so I like the
Cowboys" and "I go to Stanford,
duh! "Again, who's to say that rooting
with your family is wrong? Most (but
certainly not all) sports fans receive
their first exposure to sports from
their families, so it's natural to contin
ue their rooting interests. And of
course, almost any sports fan roots for
his or her college team.
For me, this reasoning had a major
impact on me, because I have been a
Stanford fan since birth. While obvi
ously I now root for the Cardinal as a
student first, I was foremost a son of
two Stanford alums growing up. As
Wyndam discussed earlier in the
week, it's hard when your favorite col
lege team from childhood clashes
with your current college team. Luck
ily for me, those are both Stanford, so
I can root doubly hard without ques
tioning it.
Beyond the "it's-been-with-me
since-birth" logic, though, things
change a little. People will accept you
as a Yankees fan even if they feel

that cheering for the Evil Empire
should be punishable by firing squad
if you come from New York. If
your whole family has gone to USC,
they can't be surprised that you root
for the Trojans (although they can still
make sure you know what a rotten
hellhole U$C is and rejoice in every
failure of your pitiful excuse for a
school, all while wearing Biggest
Upset Ever shirts).
Still, many people feel that these
from-birth reasons are the only legiti
mate ones for liking a team. But what
makes your reason for liking one
team "legitimate"? Is it necessarily
true that growing up in Green Bay is a
better reason for supporting the
Packers than liking green and yellow?
I say no.
When I tell people that I'm a Colts
fan, people invariably question my
choice. No, I'm not from Indianapolis
or Baltimore, and no, nobody else in
my family likes them. In fact, I've
never been to Indianapolis or Balti
more, and I've never seen a Colts
game in person. My question is: why
does this make me any less of a fan
than someone who grew up in Indi
anapolis?
I started cheering for the Colts a
little more than a decade ago because:
1) As mentioned before, I live in
southern California, far enough away
from the Chargers that I wouldn't
consider them a "hometown team,"

so I had to choose for myself, 2) I real
ly liked Peyton Manning from his
days at Tennessee, and I loved the
Colts' style and 3) Yes, I'll admit, blue
is my favorite color, and I like the
blue-and-white combo.
The decision to root for them was
truly my own, and it was not based on
any fair-weather fandom (the Colts
hadn't been to a Super Bowl since the
days of Johnny Unitas). Not living in
the Indianapolis market, I had to
work to follow the team, and I still do.
I'm not pretending I know more
about the Colts than anyone in the
world, but I do follow them pretty
closely and I have confidence saying I
follow them more than most Indi
anapolis natives. As far as I can tell,
that is at least as legitimate as my rea
son for supporting the Angels.
As I see it, who cares why you
started rooting for a team? Maybe it's
because you grew up there, maybe it's
because you like the mascot, maybe
it's because your uncle knew the
owner, maybe it's because your girl
friend likes the team or maybe it's be
cause your boyfriend hates the team.
However it started, if you're pas
sionate about that team, you're a real
fan in my book.

because you like the mascot, maybe
it's because your uncle knew the
owner, maybe it's because your girl
friend likes the team or maybe it's be
cause your boyfriend hates the team.
However it started, if you're pas
sionate about that team, you're a real
fan in my book.

Why do you like one
team more than
any other?
It's a simple question for any
level of sports fan, yet the number of
reasonable responses is staggering.
Everyone has a favorite team, and
most sports fans have several fa
vorites across multiple sports. Clear
ly it's something we all do.
So, why?
The most common response is
something like "I grew up there."
Obviously, this makes a lot of sense:
if you grow up in Boston, you're a lot
more likely to root for the Red Sox
than the Royals. Advertisements
are all around you, the stadium is
nearby, the games are televised.
Why not root for them?
I can certainly relate to this phe
nomenon, having spent the first 18

years of my life in Southern Califor
nia. The first baseball games I ever
went to were Angels games, and I've
rooted for them for as long as I can
remember since the days of
Chuck Finley, Gary DiSarcina, Jim
Edmonds, blue uniforms and every
one recognizing that Anaheim is not
Los Angeles. I have never wavered
on this, and I cannot imagine ever
switching allegiances, no matter
how many Bay Area fans stop talk
ing to me when I mention 2002.

The location-based reasoning has
several corollaries like, "I live in Pitts
burgh, but my dad's always been a big
Giants fan," "I'm from Seattle, but my
family is all from Dallas, so I like the
Cowboys" and "I go to Stanford,
duh! "Again, who's to say that rooting
with your family is wrong? Most (but
certainly not all) sports fans receive
their first exposure to sports from
their families, so it's natural to contin
ue their rooting interests. And of
course, almost any sports fan roots for
his or her college team.
For me, this reasoning had a major
impact on me, because I have been a
Stanford fan since birth. While obvi
ously I now root for the Cardinal as a
student first, I was foremost a son of
two Stanford alums growing up. As
Wyndam discussed earlier in the
week, it's hard when your favorite col
lege team from childhood clashes
with your current college team. Luck
ily for me, those are both Stanford, so
I can root doubly hard without ques
tioning it.
Beyond the "it's-been-with-me
since-birth" logic, though, things
change a little. People will accept you
as a Yankees fan even if they feel

that cheering for the Evil Empire
should be punishable by firing squad
if you come from New York. If
your whole family has gone to USC,
they can't be surprised that you root
for the Trojans (although they can still
make sure you know what a rotten
hellhole U$C is and rejoice in every
failure of your pitiful excuse for a
school, all while wearing Biggest
Upset Ever shirts).
Still, many people feel that these
from-birth reasons are the only legiti
mate ones for liking a team. But what
makes your reason for liking one
team "legitimate"? Is it necessarily
true that growing up in Green Bay is a
better reason for supporting the
Packers than liking green and yellow?
I say no.
When I tell people that I'm a Colts
fan, people invariably question my
choice. No, I'm not from Indianapolis
or Baltimore, and no, nobody else in
my family likes them. In fact, I've
never been to Indianapolis or Balti
more, and I've never seen a Colts
game in person. My question is: why
does this make me any less of a fan
than someone who grew up in Indi
anapolis?
I started cheering for the Colts a
little more than a decade ago because:
1) As mentioned before, I live in
southern California, far enough away
from the Chargers that I wouldn't
consider them a "hometown team,"

so I had to choose for myself, 2) I real
ly liked Peyton Manning from his
days at Tennessee, and I loved the
Colts' style and 3) Yes, I'll admit, blue
is my favorite color, and I like the
blue-and-white combo.
The decision to root for them was
truly my own, and it was not based on
any fair-weather fandom (the Colts
hadn't been to a Super Bowl since the
days of Johnny Unitas). Not living in
the Indianapolis market, I had to
work to follow the team, and I still do.
I'm not pretending I know more
about the Colts than anyone in the
world, but I do follow them pretty
closely and I have confidence saying I
follow them more than most Indi
anapolis natives. As far as I can tell,
that is at least as legitimate as my rea
son for supporting the Angels.
As I see it, who cares why you
started rooting for a team? Maybe it's
because you grew up there, maybe it's
because you like the mascot, maybe
it's because your uncle knew the
owner, maybe it's because your girl
friend likes the team or maybe it's be
cause your boyfriend hates the team.
However it started, if you're pas
sionate about that team, you're a real
fan in my book.
