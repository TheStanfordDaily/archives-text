# I have a dream...that all fans are created equal

Why do you like one
team more than
any other?
It's a simple question for any
level of sports fan, yet the number of
reasonable responses is staggering.
Everyone has a favorite team, and
most sports fans have several fa
vorites across multiple sports. Clear
ly it's something we all do.
So, why?
The most common response is
something like "I grew up there."
Obviously, this makes a lot of sense:
if you grow up in Boston, you're a lot
more likely to root for the Red Sox
than the Royals. Advertisements
are all around you, the stadium is
nearby, the games are televised.
Why not root for them?
I can certainly relate to this phe
nomenon, having spent the first 18

years of my life in Southern Califor
nia. The first baseball games I ever
went to were Angels games, and I've
rooted for them for as long as I can
remember since the days of
Chuck Finley, Gary DiSarcina, Jim
Edmonds, blue uniforms and every
one recognizing that Anaheim is not
Los Angeles. I have never wavered
on this, and I cannot imagine ever
switching allegiances, no matter
how many Bay Area fans stop talk
ing to me when I mention 2002.
