stretch looking for its fifth home
conference victory.
The Cardinal squares off against

GAME NOTES: Sta nfo rd wi 11 attempt to
avenge a 68-57 loss to the Bruins in
January on Thursday night at Maples
Pavilion. The Bruins have won nine of
their last ten games and are in second
place in the Pac-10, just one game
behind Arizona.
league-leading defense that has al
lowed just 0.97 points per posses
sion. In conference play, UCLA has
held opponents to 44 percent
shooting overall and 32 percent
from the three-point range, both
good enough for second place in
the Pac-10.
In the first matchup on Jan. 22,
the Cardinal stormed to a 22-8 lead
with a little over 10 minutes remain
ing in the first half. However, they
were unable to maintain that mar
gin, going 2-for-18 from the field for
the rest of the half as UCLA came
back to trail by one at halftime.
UCLA then went 25-for-33 from
the free-throw line in the second
half and the Cardinal was
outscored, 42-30, in the second peri
od.
UCLA's well-balanced offense
has five players who average 10 or
more points per game. In last
month's matchup, Malcolm Lee
scored 23, Tyler Honeycutt had 16
and Lazeric Jones went for 17.
The Cardinal will look to the im
proved play of junior guard Jeremy
Green to help them knock off the
Bruins this weekend.
After a January in which he av

eraged 11.6 points per game and
shot just 32 percent from the field,
Green has bounced back in Febru
ary, shooting 53 percent from field
goal range and scoring more than
20 points in four straight games.
Stanford Coach Johnny
Dawkins attributes Green's resur
gence primarily to better prepara
tion.
"I credit it to his work ethic, to
his dedication to the game. Fie did a
lot of studying the game and learn
ing more about himself as a player,"
Dawkins said. "Sometimes you find
more about yourself through adver
sity than at any other time. He's be
coming a better all-around player
because of what he experienced."
Dawkins noted how he's had to
face unique on-court challenges in
this Pac-10 season.
"He's now being guarded by
other teams' best defenders

who, last year, always guarded
Landry Fields," Dawkins contin
ued. "He's learned to free himself
better and create better offense for
himself."
Another indication of a strong
finish by the Cardinal has been the
maturity and leadership of junior
guard Jarrett Mann.
Dawkins noted several signs of
Mann's progression over the course
of the season.
"Mann has gotten better all sea
son," he said. "He's probably the
most selfless player on the team
from a standpoint of what he's
called upon to do. He started off
[last year] as a wing player and con
verted to a point guard, and then
this year played off the ball and
now he's back on the ball. Yet, the
young man has never wavered. He
asks 'what can I do to help the
team?"'
The Cardinal also looks to win
the turnover battle, as UCLA
coughs the ball up on a conference
worst 23.2 percent of possessions in
Pac-10 play. Conversely, the Bruins
struggle to force turnovers, only
doing so 16.8 percent of the time,
the conference's second-worst per
centage.
Tipoff is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight
at Maples Pavilion.

GAME NOTES: Sta nfo rd wi 11 attempt to
avenge a 68-57 loss to the Bruins in
January on Thursday night at Maples
Pavilion. The Bruins have won nine of
their last ten games and are in second
place in the Pac-10, just one game
behind Arizona.
league-leading defense that has al
lowed just 0.97 points per posses
sion. In conference play, UCLA has
held opponents to 44 percent
shooting overall and 32 percent
from the three-point range, both
good enough for second place in
the Pac-10.
In the first matchup on Jan. 22,
the Cardinal stormed to a 22-8 lead
with a little over 10 minutes remain
ing in the first half. However, they
were unable to maintain that mar
gin, going 2-for-18 from the field for
the rest of the half as UCLA came
back to trail by one at halftime.
UCLA then went 25-for-33 from
the free-throw line in the second
half and the Cardinal was
outscored, 42-30, in the second peri
od.
UCLA's well-balanced offense
has five players who average 10 or
more points per game. In last
month's matchup, Malcolm Lee
scored 23, Tyler Honeycutt had 16
and Lazeric Jones went for 17.
The Cardinal will look to the im
proved play of junior guard Jeremy
Green to help them knock off the
Bruins this weekend.
After a January in which he av

eraged 11.6 points per game and
shot just 32 percent from the field,
Green has bounced back in Febru
ary, shooting 53 percent from field
goal range and scoring more than
20 points in four straight games.
Stanford Coach Johnny
Dawkins attributes Green's resur
gence primarily to better prepara
tion.
"I credit it to his work ethic, to
his dedication to the game. Fie did a
lot of studying the game and learn
ing more about himself as a player,"
Dawkins said. "Sometimes you find
more about yourself through adver
sity than at any other time. He's be
coming a better all-around player
because of what he experienced."
Dawkins noted how he's had to
face unique on-court challenges in
this Pac-10 season.
"He's now being guarded by
other teams' best defenders

who, last year, always guarded
Landry Fields," Dawkins contin
ued. "He's learned to free himself
better and create better offense for
himself."
Another indication of a strong
finish by the Cardinal has been the
maturity and leadership of junior
guard Jarrett Mann.
Dawkins noted several signs of
Mann's progression over the course
of the season.
"Mann has gotten better all sea
son," he said. "He's probably the
most selfless player on the team
from a standpoint of what he's
called upon to do. He started off
[last year] as a wing player and con
verted to a point guard, and then
this year played off the ball and
now he's back on the ball. Yet, the
young man has never wavered. He
asks 'what can I do to help the
team?"'
The Cardinal also looks to win
the turnover battle, as UCLA
coughs the ball up on a conference
worst 23.2 percent of possessions in
Pac-10 play. Conversely, the Bruins
struggle to force turnovers, only
doing so 16.8 percent of the time,
the conference's second-worst per
centage.
Tipoff is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight
at Maples Pavilion.
