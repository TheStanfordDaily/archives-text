# University tightens photo policies
## Authorities increase restrictions on commercial photos 
### DANA EDWARDS STAFF WRITER 
The University recently stepped
up enforcement of its photography
policy, leaving photographers un
certain about whether they are
technically allowed to photograph
Stanford landmarks. Security
guards patrolling the Main Quad
and other campus landmarks have
been instructed to question the in
tent of individuals with professional
camera equipment.

Jeff Keller, a local photography
enthusiast, was tweaking the set
tings of his professional-grade cam
era atop a tripod in the Main Quad
on Feb. 9 when he was approached
by two security personnel and asked
to leave. Keller runs "The Digital
Camera Resource Page" (DCRP), a
photography review website. He
took photos in the quad to test the
image quality of his new camera and
later posted the test results online.
"I take the same picture in the
hallway of the Main Quad with dif
ferent cameras, at the same time,
with the same conditions, and I've
been doing it for at least 10 years,"

Keller said. By taking photos
from the exact same spots and con
trolling for external factors, Keller
allows his website visitors to accu
rately compare the resolutions of
different digital cameras. The Main
Quad shots and those taken from
four other locations around campus
have been DCRP's hallmark
method of comparison for over a
decade.

The security guards who stopped
Keller instructed him to contact as
sociate director of University Com
munications Kate Chesley for ques
tions regarding the policy. The poli
cy states "commercial [photogra
phy] requests are not compatible
with the teaching and research mis
sions of the university and with its
non-profit status."
In a letter to Chesley, Keller re
quested permission to continue tak
ing photos on Stanford's campus, ar
guing "these photos are never
resold" and are not of commercial
value. Chesley rejected his request.
"Although you are not selling
the photographs, your site is of a
commercial nature," Chesley wrote
in an e-mail to Heller. Chesley em

phasized that the photo policy is not
new, but that enforcement had in
creased recently.
"The amount of commercial
photography we have been experi
encing recently simply has become
unsustainable, especially given
Stanford's strict privacy policies,"
she said.
Lisa Lapin, associate vice presi
dent of communications, said Stan
ford has a "simple, compelling legal
reason" to prevent commercial
photography and that photogra
phers have become a "nuisance."
As a private trademark, Stan
ford "wants to protect its brand,
image and identity from unautho
rized use," Lapin said.
"Stanford has become unbeliev
ably popular," she added. "Now we
have all sorts of entities trying to af
filiate themselves with Stanford. We
don't want anyone to profit from a
perceived affiliation with us."
Similarly, the University does
not want to be negatively impacted
by appearing to endorse institutions

Security guards will now be required to patrol campus landmarks and question
visitors with professional camera equipment about their motives. In an effort to
increase enforcement of photo policies, commercial requests will be denied.
