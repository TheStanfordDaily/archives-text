# University tightens photo policies
## Authorities increase restrictions on commercial photos 
### DANA EDWARDS STAFF WRITER 
The University recently stepped
up enforcement of its photography
policy, leaving photographers un
certain about whether they are
technically allowed to photograph
Stanford landmarks. Security
guards patrolling the Main Quad
and other campus landmarks have
been instructed to question the in
tent of individuals with professional
camera equipment.

Jeff Keller, a local photography
enthusiast, was tweaking the set
tings of his professional-grade cam
era atop a tripod in the Main Quad
on Feb. 9 when he was approached
by two security personnel and asked
to leave. Keller runs "The Digital
Camera Resource Page" (DCRP), a
photography review website. He
took photos in the quad to test the
image quality of his new camera and
later posted the test results online.
"I take the same picture in the
hallway of the Main Quad with dif
ferent cameras, at the same time,
with the same conditions, and I've
been doing it for at least 10 years,"

Keller said. By taking photos
from the exact same spots and con
trolling for external factors, Keller
allows his website visitors to accu
rately compare the resolutions of
different digital cameras. The Main
Quad shots and those taken from
four other locations around campus
have been DCRP's hallmark
method of comparison for over a
decade.

The security guards who stopped
Keller instructed him to contact as
sociate director of University Com
munications Kate Chesley for ques
tions regarding the policy. The poli
cy states "commercial [photogra
phy] requests are not compatible
with the teaching and research mis
sions of the university and with its
non-profit status."
In a letter to Chesley, Keller re
quested permission to continue tak
ing photos on Stanford's campus, ar
guing "these photos are never
resold" and are not of commercial
value. Chesley rejected his request.
"Although you are not selling
the photographs, your site is of a
commercial nature," Chesley wrote
in an e-mail to Heller. Chesley em

phasized that the photo policy is not
new, but that enforcement had in
creased recently.
"The amount of commercial
photography we have been experi
encing recently simply has become
unsustainable, especially given
Stanford's strict privacy policies,"
she said.
Lisa Lapin, associate vice presi
dent of communications, said Stan
ford has a "simple, compelling legal
reason" to prevent commercial
photography and that photogra
phers have become a "nuisance."
As a private trademark, Stan
ford "wants to protect its brand,
image and identity from unautho
rized use," Lapin said.
"Stanford has become unbeliev
ably popular," she added. "Now we
have all sorts of entities trying to af
filiate themselves with Stanford. We
don't want anyone to profit from a
perceived affiliation with us."
Similarly, the University does
not want to be negatively impacted
by appearing to endorse institutions

Security guards will now be required to patrol campus landmarks and question
visitors with professional camera equipment about their motives. In an effort to
increase enforcement of photo policies, commercial requests will be denied.
that reflect poorly on it. The photo
policy also seeks to protect the pri
vacy of the students and faculty,
some of whom might be exploited
by photographers.
"The Main Quad is not a public
park," Lapin said.
Controversy surrounding the
policy does not chiefly revolve
around the ban on commercial pho
tography per se, but how "commer
ciality" is defined.
Keller acknowledged that Stan
ford, as a private institution, re
serves the right to prohibit any kind
of photography. But he rejected the
notion that his photos present a
threat to Stanford's image or its ac
ademic mission.
"Enforcement is uneven," Keller
said. "Stanford needs a clear, more
realistic way of determining what
commercial photography is. If I did
n't have a tripod, I wouldn't have
been noticed."
Keller also questioned how
Stanford security guards could
identify whether a person was
shooting for commercial reasons.
On the one hand, someone with a
tripod and a high-end camera could
simply be shooting photos for his
own use. Someone with a point-and
shoot camera could post his photos
on "a blog that generates money
from advertisements," Keller said.
"The bottom line is there is no
shooting in the Quad or Memorial
Court without permission, no mat
ter what the purposes or who the
sponsor or who you are," said
Megan Miller, communications
manager at the Stanford Institute
for Creativity and the Arts (SICA).
"It just isn't allowed."
In an e-mail sent to the Stanford
photography mailing list. Miller
warned students against violating
the photo policy. List members re
sponded with concerns about the
policy's legitimacy, one joking that
he would file a request to take a pic
ture with his iPhone.
"After a debriefing with some

communications staff, I felt respon
sible to let everyone know about the
policy, so they wouldn't get in trou
ble," Miller said.
So who really can photograph in
the Main Quad?
Technically, every person needs
permission, but security personnel
do not prevent tourists and students
with small personal cameras from
taking snapshots. Everyone else
including news agencies, commercial
photographers, students shooting for
academic purposes and people with
professional-grade equipment
must file requests.
Requests are sometimes granted.
But commercial requests will
nearly always be denied, with sever
al notable exceptions. If a Stanford
alumnus, faculty member or student
wants to get married, professional
photographers may document the
wedding; weddings with non-Stan
ford affiliated individuals are barred.
"That way, it makes it more
meaningful for the brides and
grooms that do have an affiliation,"
Lapin said.
