## Biomarker linked to knee pain Med school "truth serum" helps to explain discomfort 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine identified a biomarker for
pain associated with cartilage injury
in the knee. The biomarker can fa
cilitate the diagnostic process and
reduce costs for patients.
According to Gaetano Scuderi,
professor of orthopaedic surgery
and leader of the research team, the
knee joint has two crescent shaped
menisci comprised of cartilage.
Menisci are often torn by physical
activity or natural degradation, but
these tears are not always painful or
noticed.
While surgeons can use MRIs to
try to discern the root of a patient's
knee pain, MRIs often cannot dif
ferentiate between inflammations
