## Biomarker linked to knee pain Med school "truth serum" helps to explain discomfort 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine identified a biomarker for
pain associated with cartilage injury
in the knee. The biomarker can fa
cilitate the diagnostic process and
reduce costs for patients.
According to Gaetano Scuderi,
professor of orthopaedic surgery
and leader of the research team, the
knee joint has two crescent shaped
menisci comprised of cartilage.
Menisci are often torn by physical
activity or natural degradation, but
these tears are not always painful or
noticed.
While surgeons can use MRIs to
try to discern the root of a patient's
knee pain, MRIs often cannot dif
ferentiate between inflammations

from natural degeneration and a
full-fledged tear.
"Traumatic and degenerative in
juries look the same on MRI,"
Scuderi said. "In a 50-year-old, we
can't tell the difference."
However, correctly identifying a
cartilage tear is only one obstacle.
Sometimes, patients sustain pain
after corrective surgery because
the tear is not actually the root of
pain.
"Sometimes you would think
you did a great job but the patient
still had pain," Scuderi said. "Why
did this person not get better when
another person did?"
According to Scuderi, MRI
scans of people with no previously
known knee problems sometimes
reveal incidental meniscus tears.
Since an imaging study cannot

identify pain due menisci tears,
there must be another responsible
mechanism, he said.
"Tapping the joint for biomark
ers is more likely to tell us of actual
processes inside the joint rather
than an imaging study which tells us
anatomy," Scuderi said.
This new biomarker assay acts as
a "truth serum" to identify the
source of the patient's pain. The
study took a sample of synovial
fluid in the knees of 30 patients with
pain, mechanical symptoms and
MRI findings consistent with
menisci tears. Synovial fluid was
also aspirated from 10 asympto
matic patients those with no
knee pain, despite imaging evi
dence of menisci tears.
The study found comparatively
high levels of fibronectin-aggrecan
complex in those patients with pain
in contrast to asymptomatic pa
tients. As a result, fibronectin-ag
grecan complex was deemed a bio
marker for knee pain related to
menisci tears.

According to the study, protein
biomarkers can be utilized as diag
nostic tools, prognostic indicators
and candidates for future drug ther
apies.
In a clinical setting, this bio
marker could effectively differenti
ate knees with pain-inducing
menisci tears that are responsive to
surgery from knees with only natu
ral cartilage degradation.
This is especially beneficial to
older patient populations. For this
group, MRIs "are a waste of time
because they always show degener
ation," Scuderi said. A biomarker
test offers a cheaper and more spe
cific identification of pathology.
The research team includes re
searchers at New York University,
the University of Pittsburgh,
Jupiter Medical Center in Florida
and Cytonics, Inc. It hopes to image
the molecule noninvasively as op
posed to aspirating it for assay.
