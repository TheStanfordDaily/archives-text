The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) unanimously confirmed for
mer Senate Chair Michael Cruz *l2
as the new ASSU Vice President
Wednesday and passed most com
ponents of a special fees reform bill
authored by Cruz.
When introducing her bill to
nominate Cruz as vice president,
ASSU President Angelina Cardona

choice" and said he had been in

Stanford career.
Cruz resigned as senate chair at
Wednesday's GSC meeting, and will
replace former vice president Kelsei
Wharton, who is currently taking the
quarter off. At Tuesday's Senate
meeting, former Senate Deputy
Chair Madeline Hawes 'l3 was se

nine to five vote, the Senate selected
Pat Bruny 'l3 to serve as deputy
chair.

The GSC also passed three of
four main components to special
fees reform legislation. The first
component, which stipulated a time
line for the creation of special fees
policies, passed unanimously. It also
changed the reserve policy for stu
dent groups, allowing them to hold in

100 percent of their expenditures in

co-Chair Justin Brown and Addy
Satija, one of the GSC's program
ming coordinators, voting against it.
"I find your position on this in
credibly disrespectful of their time,"
said GSC Secretary Erik Lehnert,
arguing that student group leaders'
busy schedules make petitioning dif
