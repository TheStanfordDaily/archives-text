## Tuition hike will not hurt financial aid Aid resources unaffected by board's 3.5-percent increase 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
The increase in tuition, room and
board costs for the 2011-12 academ
ic year, approved by the Board of
Trustees at a meeting early this
month, may not have significant
ramifications for financial aid.
The 3.5 percent price hike will
apply to both undergraduate and
graduate students, with the excep
tion of law students, who will see a
5.75 percent jump. This puts next
year's undergraduate tuition at
$40,050 and room and board at
$12,291, compared with this year's
$38,700 and $11,876, respectively.
The increase is reminiscent of last
year's 3.5 percent rise in costs.
Campus Health Services Fee for
fall 2011 will be bumped up to $173
per quarter, reflecting a similar 3.5
percent increase.
