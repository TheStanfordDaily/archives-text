## Tuition hike will not hurt financial aid Aid resources unaffected by board's 3.5-percent increase 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
The increase in tuition, room and
board costs for the 2011-12 academ
ic year, approved by the Board of
Trustees at a meeting early this
month, may not have significant
ramifications for financial aid.
The 3.5 percent price hike will
apply to both undergraduate and
graduate students, with the excep
tion of law students, who will see a
5.75 percent jump. This puts next
year's undergraduate tuition at
$40,050 and room and board at
$12,291, compared with this year's
$38,700 and $11,876, respectively.
The increase is reminiscent of last
year's 3.5 percent rise in costs.
Campus Health Services Fee for
fall 2011 will be bumped up to $173
per quarter, reflecting a similar 3.5
percent increase.
Students on financial aid will not
be impacted by these changes as
long as their financial situation has
not changed, said director of finan
cial aid Karen Cooper.
"Every year students reapply for
financial aid and we assess their eli
gibility," she said. "As long as circum
stances haven't changed in their
family, then I estimate they will have
the same estimated family contribu
tion as last year, and therefore will
have more eligibility for aid."
In fact, the financial aid budget
will expand to $122 million to offset
the jump in tuition and room and
board fees. According to Cooper,
this will take place despite a "slight
decrease" in applications for finan
cial aid this year. This expansion in
financial assistance only represents
a one percent increase from the cur
rent $llB million.
"Our financial aid budget is al

ways created with the caveat that
we are need-blind in our admission
process and need-based in our fi
nancial aid process," Cooper said.
"We have a commitment to meet
the demonstrated need of all the
students that enroll. Even though
we have a $122 million budget, if we
need more, we will spend more."
Financial aid will remain unaf
fected partly because it is funded by
the University endowment, not the
tuition. Tuition covers 57 percent of
the University's general funds
budget, said Board of Trustees
Chair Leslie Hume.
"This is a balanced tuition in
crease, it is going to enable the Uni
versity to achieve the recruitment
of faculty and salary increases that
we would like to do, as well as grad
ual reinstatement of positions that
when the recession hit were
frozen," Hume said in a previous
press briefing.
Only international students,
whose financial aid is not need
based, and students with financial
responsibility will be affected by
the rise in costs.

"For all students, both continu
ing and current students, we've in
creased the amount of student re
sponsibility by $250," Cooper said.
"By that, I mean the student's ex
pectation to work during the sum
mer or during the academic year
has been increased by a total of
$250."
Many students expressed apathy
toward the tuition increase.
"It sucks, but I'm assuming the
Board isn't just gratuitously raising
tuition," said Sharad Bharadwaj
'l4. "It's to pay for professors, stu
dents and good programs."
"I'm not that worried about it,
because the increase in financial aid
will take care of the students who
it's going to affect the most," said
Greg Greiner 'l4.
Regardless of their approval or
disapproval, students acknowledge
that their opinion will not change
what has happened.
"Honestly, there's nothing I can
do about it" said Eva Hellman 'l4.
