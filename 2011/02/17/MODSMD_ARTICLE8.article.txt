## Researches discover how to make radios listen 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Cassandra Feliciano 
Stanford students can now speed
on the information highway thanks to
researchers in computer science and
electrical engineering who have de
veloped the first wireless radios that
can simultaneously send and receive
signals, making these devices twice as
fast as already existing ones.
"Textbooks say you can't do it,"
said Philip Levis, assistant professor of
computer science and electrical engi
neering, in a press release Monday.
"The new system completely reworks
our assumptions about how wireless
networks can be designed."
Although radios know exactly

what they transmit, these messages
are often much louder than ones from
surrounding devices. As a result, each
has to take turns in "talking" in order
to be heard by the other. But the new
devices work in very much the same
way as the brain, filtering out its own
sounds in order to better "hear" the
other radios.
These machines, built by three
electrical engineering graduate stu
dents — Jung II Choi, Mayank Jain
and Kannan Srinivasan took sev
eral months to construct.
The team, which also includes
Sachin Katti, assistant professor of
computer science and electrical engi
neering, is currently working to com
mercialize their product by increasing
both the strength of the transmissions
and the distance they are able to travel.
Such improvements will make the
technology more useful for Wi-Fi net
works.
