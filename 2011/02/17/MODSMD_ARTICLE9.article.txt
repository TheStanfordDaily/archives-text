## A
						Suite all-nighter 
### CAROLINE CASELLI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A 11 necessary preparations have been made: the post-dinner nap taken,
/\ the over sized mug full of strong black coffee consumed and the aptly
/% named "Jet-Alert" caffeine pills and 5-Hour Energy drink placed
/ 1 ominously on the desk in front of me. With a Spanish presentation to
rehearse and memorize by tomorrow afternoon, an already-late
problem set to conclude and a three to five-page paper (... 2.75 with some creative
spacing) to conquer, I plan to accomplish what I've amazingly managed to avoid thus
far in my junior year the all-nighter.
Having successfully procrastinated away the evening, I glance down at my tortoise
shell watch, knowing that this workathon must commence in the near future. The hands
point perfectly to midnight, and for a brief second I snicker to myself about how cliche
that seems. Then, the unmistakable feeling of dread sinks in.
"I should have started this earlier," I think to myself, imagining all of my more or
ganized, better-time managing classmates finishing up their assignments and settling down
to some television on Netflix right about now. "This is going to suck."
Full backpack slung over my shoulder, I walk into the common room of my suite to
find my three living companions joyously sharing a freshly popped bag of buttery popcorn
and circulating a bottle of Yellow Tail chardonnay. Several handfuls and a depressing zero
sips later, however, it is off to the Suites computer cluster for me the CD-Rom on my
Mac is making some very unfriendly noise and refusing the software disc required for my
p-set. An inauspicious start.
I trudge through the brisk air toward the cluster, and Governor's Corner is (if pos
sible) even quieter than usual, aside from a brief yelp coming from an unlit game of pick
up basketball on the FroSoCo court. Lights are still on in most students' rooms as they
work quietly at their desks, and I enviously detect a hint of weed smoke as I walk by one
of the four Suites residences.
When I arrive at the computer cluster, it is just me and the girl in the yellow peacoat.
She looks up at me with an expression of quasi-irritation as I come into the room, prob
ably annoyed that she now has to silence her music. It's 12:22 a.m., and I can't even fig
ure out how to load the software on one of the cluster computers, nonetheless start the
assignment. Expletives about the uselessness of computer clusters, RCCs and Mac CD-
Roms are filling my head as grumpiness and semi-heavy eyelids already begin to set in.
After some 10 minutes of dumbly staring at the screen, I finally realize that
the software is already installed on these computers. Hallelujah! I make a mental
note to take back my premature RCC cursing.
The glee is short lived. I am trying to follow along with the notes that my TA
sent me, but all of these software commands make me feel like I'm reading
a foreign language. When my boyfriend calls me at 1:06 a.m., I still haven't
1 figured out how to open the data set that I need to analyze. Yikes. But alas
now at 1:27 in the morning the data is open! I can now start the prob
lem set.
The next hour passes pretty uneventfully, and I guess I've gotten fair
ly absorbed in STATA, the statistical analysis software that I've come to
realize is kind of cool in a super nerdy way. Yellow peacoat girl stands up
' to leave, and out of nowhere "All by myselffff" starts playing in my head (a
Google search tells me that this is Celine Dion's voice that I have random
ly drawn out of my subconscious memory).
No longer feeling the judgmental stares of my counterpart in the computer
cluster, I quickly check my Facebook and Twitter, and have a moment of soli
darity with Tennessee Titan Chris Johnson who so eloquently tweets, "Ima try n
stay up all night." I contemplate commenting on a comment on Facebook, but snap
