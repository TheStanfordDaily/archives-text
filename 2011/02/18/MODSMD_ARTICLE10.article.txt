## Housing expands key card access Three dorms join ongoing effort to improve security, efficiency 
### NARDOS GIRMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As part of a larger effort to enhance campus
safety and security. Student Housing recently
installed ID key card access in Manzanita
Park, Mirrielees and Toyon Hall, replacing the
traditional lock-and-key system.
The card systems, which were introduced on
Jan. 31,2011, allow students to enter their dorm
buildings with their Stanford ID cards.These re
cent additions are only part of an initiative that
began three years ago with the introduction of
ID card access systems to freshman residences,
Rodger Whitney, executive director of student
housing, wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"While Stanford has not had serious securi

ty problems, there was an increased awareness
that safety was of utmost priority campus
wide," Whitney said. "We wanted to be proac
tive rather than reactive."

Feedback and concerns from students also
played crucial roles in the implementation of
the new changes as well as in previous card ac
cess projects at other dorms. Both students and
resident fellows were surveyed prior to the
project's execution and have been involved
throughout the process.

"This year specifically, feedback indicated
that students were eager to have card access in
stalled and/or in use at their residences," Whit
ney said.

The reaction from students since the pro
ject's implementation has been generally posi
tive. Kafi Hemphill 'l3 said she appreciated the
convenience of the new system.
"I didn't like it at first, but I really like it
now," Hemphill said. "It has made it easier to
get into the dorm quickly."

Manzanita resident Robi Bucayu 'l3
voiced a similar opinion about the efficiency
of card access. However, the new system has
also elicited a number of criticisms. Some stu
dents, including Hemphill, were disgruntled
that the system changed partway through the
year.

Another complaint about the new key card
system deals with Student Housing's decision
to add an alarm system that sounds if dorm
doors are propped open. This feature was orig
inally installed to improve safety.
"The use of door alarms has enabled a high
er security level for residents," Whitney said.
"Doors are no longer accidentally or inten
tionally left open, which means that individu
als who do not belong in a residence have a
much harder time gaining access."
In the case that a door alarm goes off, the
dorm staff is alerted through text messages.
Housing Building Managers, custo
dial staff and Housing Access Spe
cialists are notified and instructed
to follow the University's pre
scribed course of action. The Hous
ing Access Response Team
(HART) is also available after
hours.

But the door alarms have re
ceived mixed reviews from stu
dents.

Toyon Resident Assistant (RA)
Colin Campbell 'll found the alarm
change to be a great improvement.
"Before, you had no idea if the
door was propped open, and now it
can't be propped open for more
than [a few] seconds without the
alarm going off," he said.
Hemphill, however, found the
alarms to be somewhat of a hassle,
"I don't think propping dorms

open was a large problem to begin
with," she said. "And now, if you
leave the door open for a moment
too long, the alarm goes off."
Although building access tech
nology has steadily spread at Stan
ford, students shouldn't expect to
have key card access systems for
their rooms any time soon.
"The University does not plan
to install card access at student
room doors in the near future,"
Whitney said. "We do intend to
continue installing card access at
perimeter doors of housing facili
ties."

Governor's Corner is next in
line to have card access systems in
stalled. The Row, which is under re
view, may follow suit.
In light of safety concerns this
quarter, these recent changes to
building access were seen by most
students as welcome improvements
to convenience and security.
