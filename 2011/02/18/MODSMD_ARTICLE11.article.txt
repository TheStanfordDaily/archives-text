## EDITORIAL Hide Yo Wife, Hide Yo Frosh: In Defense of All-Freshman Housing 
### 
Beginning in the 2009-10
school year, Wilbur and Stern
(with the exception of the
theme houses Okada and Casa Za
pata) switched entirely to freshman
housing. According to conventional
wisdom and survey data, all-frosh
houses better promote community
and rapport with dorm mates than
four-class houses do. Yet, some have
argued that four-class dorms pro
vide their own benefits; benefits
which disappear when the majority
of freshmen are secluded in a bub
ble within the bubble. While advo
cates for four-class dorms are right
to cite advantages for academic ad
vising, they are flat wrong when it
comes to improving alcohol safety.
In theory, four-class houses are a
great opportunity for informal peer
advising, both academically and on
a personal level. Upperclassmen
have insider knowledge about class
es, majors, research and other op
portunities that faculty advisors or
academic directors cannot provide.
On a personal level, upperclassmen
can provide guidance regarding typ
ical Stanford struggles, such as be
coming more involved in campus
activities and how best to balance
work and fun.They also have the po
tential to be exceptional role mod
els, especially when it comes to re
sponsible alcohol consumption.
Even for those in all-frosh houses,
having upperclassmen in the same
dorm complex makes them much
more accessible than they would be
otherwise.

Unfortunately for advocates of
four-class housing, those theoretical
benefits do not always pan out in
four-class houses. Many upperclass
men were not looking to live with
freshmen again, but settled for a
four-class house in the draw. While
some enjoy the enthusiasm of fresh
men, others avoid them. Most im
portantly, upperclassmen actually
tend to be poor role models for the
freshmen who emulate them. Con
trary to popular belief, four-class

houses produce some of the most
dangerous drinking habits, and
freshmen are often more cautious
than their older counterparts. In
deed, upperclassmen, and in partic
ular sophomores, have accounted
for most of the increase in alcohol
transports this year. In addition, liv
ing with older students makes it eas
ier for freshmen to obtain alcohol.
Having older students around also
makes instituting and enforcing
rules about alcohol much more dif
ficult.

Alcohol safety should be a high
priority when it comes to formulat
ing housing policies. A recent study
from AlcoholEdu showed that Stan
ford students are high above nation
al average in terms of number of
shots typically taken and amount of
pregaming. According to Ralph Cas
tro, associate director of Vaden
Health Promotion Services, of the al
cohol transports over the last four
years, 100 percent had consumed
hard liquor and 95 percent had
pregamed. Upperclassmen tend to
think that freshmen are naive and
therefore make poor decisions, but if
the mentors from whom they learn
are generally making poor decisions
as well, how can we expect better re
sults from four-class houses?

Critics are justified in arguing
that the restructuring of Wilbur and
Stern has denied many freshmen
the opportunity to build relation
ships with upperclassmen and de
prived them of invaluable academic
guidance. As a community, we
should have more opportunities for
freshmen to be advised by those
with more experience, particularly
for academic purposes. However,
before we can look to four-class
housing as a solution, upperclass
men themselves need to become
more responsible role models when
it comes to alcohol consumption. In
the meantime, Stanford is right to
house its newest students away from
the corrupting influence of upper
classmen.
