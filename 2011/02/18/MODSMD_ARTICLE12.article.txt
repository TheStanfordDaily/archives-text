# OP-ED
## The 						fine line between insensitivity and disrespect 
### JOEL SANDLER, B.S. '10, M.S. '11 
For those of you who have
never received an e-mail blast
from me, I am the President of
the 6th Man Committee. Yesterday
I was unsurprised to see an opinion
written by a fellow student under
the title "It's all fun and games ...
until you call it a Fiesta." The op-ed
was critical of the 6th Man Club's
upcoming "Fiesta Night," labeling it
as "insensitive." While I would like
to personally apologize for offend
ing anyone, I think the message be
hind the event is being lost and I dis
agree with the stance that we should
prevent events like this at Stanford.

First of all, let me state for the
record that I am sorry that the au
thor and others may have felt
"cheapened" by the theme for the
event. I totally understand the sen
timent that it seems unnecessary to
associate tacos, sombreros and the
word "Fiesta" with basketball. And
I definitely sympathize with the fact
that such events can quickly go
wrong: first come sombreros, next,
mustaches. Of course these objec
tions were foreseeable; so what
could we have been thinking?
I think the author is ignoring the
venue and purpose of the event. It
is not being held on the Row to cel
ebrate drunkenness at the cost of
another culture, as so many events
admittedly are (take "Internation
al Progressives" or "Cafe Night,"
for example). It is about bringing
together a community of fans over
good food (tacos), music (played

by Mariachi Cardenal), fun prizes
(sombreros) and, best of all, some
exciting Stanford basketball
(against U$C). Obviously, if one
measures the event by whether it
fulfills the traditional standards for
a fiesta, it will come up short. But
that is not to say the event is inher
ently insensitive or disrespectful.
Although it is our responsibility to
preserve Stanford as a respectful
environment, this event, which has
the best of intentions, seems a very
misplaced focus for the author's
ire.

While the author may not have
realized this when formulating her
opinion, it is not the Stanford ad
ministration that is the object of her
criticism but students like me. The
members of the Committee plan all
of the events for 6th Man, come
early and stay late for every game,
flyer weekly, go to dorm meetings,
sell t-shirts for charity and support
the women's basketball team. We
volunteer full-time to support
men's basketball and to make the
student experience at games even
better. In my mind, this really begs
the question of who is being insensi
tive and/or disrespectful.
In any case, Fiesta Night will go
on! Shameless plug:
Stanford men's basketball vs. USC
Fiesta Night
6:30-9:30 p.m., Maples Pavilion
Hope to see you there!
