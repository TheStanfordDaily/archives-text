## TMI? NEI. 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
For those of the earlier gener
ations TMI is an acronym
for the expression "too much
information." It is usually uttered
to halt a conversational trend, and
it is often exclaimed in shock or
protestation. I have heard it
shrieked most often when people
go too far into the realm of the sex
ually explicit, but also in reference
to things like descriptions of vio
lence and gore or narrations of
bodily functions such as bowel
movements.

Rather than provide sample an
ecdotes of situations in which my
friends gave me TMI about their sex
lives, I'm going to explore the realm
of the opposite NEI (not enough
information). Yes, I made it up my
self just now. But you should totally
spread it around.
Anyway, picture the following
conversation between two people
who pass by each other outside
Meyer Library:
"Hey, how're you doing?"
"Hey! I'm good . . . how're

you?"
"I'm good!"
Then what happens? Sometimes
the two people part ways there,
maybe even feigning some excuse
for departure. "Oh, I have to run

now, but good to see you!" Occa
sionally the conversation continues,
but in my experience at least, it goes
haltingly at first, like a car that has
stalled and needs to be restarted.
"So, um, how're classes?" But the
damage has been done. What dam
age, you may ask?
NEIH! The issue with answering
only "good!" to the "how're you?"
question is that it sets a very low
precedent for the level of informa
tion sharing that will take place in
the conversation. It's the lowest TMI
the highest NEI. Each person an
swers the minimum "good" or "fine"
or "okay" and moves on with their
lives. And who would break the
cycle? If you pose the question and
the other person says "good" in re
sponse, are you going to tell the per
son all about your life? Probably not.
The person said "good," so you'll say
"good" too, right? It's the cycle of
NEI.
In my mind, this recalls the ques

They probably
wondered why I
provided so much
information
