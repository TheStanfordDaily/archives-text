## TMI? NEI. 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
For those of the earlier gener
ations TMI is an acronym
for the expression "too much
information." It is usually uttered
to halt a conversational trend, and
it is often exclaimed in shock or
protestation. I have heard it
shrieked most often when people
go too far into the realm of the sex
ually explicit, but also in reference
to things like descriptions of vio
lence and gore or narrations of
bodily functions such as bowel
movements.

Rather than provide sample an
ecdotes of situations in which my
friends gave me TMI about their sex
lives, I'm going to explore the realm
of the opposite NEI (not enough
information). Yes, I made it up my
self just now. But you should totally
spread it around.
Anyway, picture the following
conversation between two people
who pass by each other outside
Meyer Library:
"Hey, how're you doing?"
"Hey! I'm good . . . how're

you?"
"I'm good!"
Then what happens? Sometimes
the two people part ways there,
maybe even feigning some excuse
for departure. "Oh, I have to run

now, but good to see you!" Occa
sionally the conversation continues,
but in my experience at least, it goes
haltingly at first, like a car that has
stalled and needs to be restarted.
"So, um, how're classes?" But the
damage has been done. What dam
age, you may ask?
NEIH! The issue with answering
only "good!" to the "how're you?"
question is that it sets a very low
precedent for the level of informa
tion sharing that will take place in
the conversation. It's the lowest TMI
the highest NEI. Each person an
swers the minimum "good" or "fine"
or "okay" and moves on with their
lives. And who would break the
cycle? If you pose the question and
the other person says "good" in re
sponse, are you going to tell the per
son all about your life? Probably not.
The person said "good," so you'll say
"good" too, right? It's the cycle of
NEI.
In my mind, this recalls the ques

They probably
wondered why I
provided so much
information

tion of who moves first in the game
of conversation (thank you, game
theory). If you're answering the
"how're you?" question first, you
set the precedent. If the other per
son is answering first, they set the
precedent of how detailed the con
versation should be, and initial
precedents can be hard to change.
However, it is possible to change
the game. If you decide to add in a
tidbit like, "I'm good, I just got out
of a midterm!" you've implicitly
given permission for the other per
son to also add an additional piece
of information. I've seen this hap
pen many a time when asked
how I'm doing, I provide one little
sentence of description, ask how
the person is doing in return and re
ceive one little sentence of descrip
tion. It brings to mind the idea of
raising the price of a good in an
auction I've raised my "bid" in
the conversation, so I force the
other person to raise theirs too.

Okay, no more economics. The
point is that these little one-liners
are the most important aspect of

the casual run-in. Even if the only
thing you gain from that interac
tion is hearing that the other per
son just had a midterm or is really
tired or is going to an interview, it's
one more way you're involved with
their life and one more way you can
feel connected to them. Plus it's
conversational ammunition for the
next time you run into this person
if you remember what they said
before, you can bring it up in the fu
ture and ask about their interview
or nap or post-midterm ecstasy.
Now, what do you do when you
ask, "how're you doing?" first and
the person says "good" in re
sponse? I dare you, when they ask
you in return, to volunteer a tidbit
or two. They may have set the bar to
the highest level of NEI (is this
catching on?), but you don't have
to keep it there. In this situation, I
usually go ahead and volunteer a
few things. Sometimes it's as egre
gious as:
"Hey [name], how're you
doing?"
"I'm good, Miriam! How're
you?"
"Oh wow. This week is killing
me. I have a ton of work, and then I
had to scramble to find a good topic
for my Daily column. Now that's
over, but I still have a midterm this

week. At least this weekend will be
good! You should definitely check
out this big show on Saturday
called Rhythms. Sanskriti is putting
it on in Memorial Auditorium, and
it features 14 difference student
performance groups..." etc.
I usually take the other person

aback at first. After all, they prob
ably wondered why I volunteered
so much information. But then the
best part happens. If the person
clearly isn't dashing off to another
engagement, they often readjust
to the new, lower level of NEI that
I've set, and then we have a real

conversation! No more monosyl
labic answers we have a good
exchange until one of us really
does have to leave.

Was this columns TMI on NEI?
