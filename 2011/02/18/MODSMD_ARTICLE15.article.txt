# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## This Weather Sucks 
### Kristian Bailey 
Yesterday, for the first time I
can recall all year, it was
colder at Stanford than all
the major cities on the East Coast. It
was 58 degrees and partly sunny in
Cambridge, Mass., 62 degrees and
sunny in New York and 70 degrees
and sunny in Washington, D.C. Un
acceptable.
Like most Mac√üook owners, I
have the weather widget on my
dashboard. But my dashboard is
set up to show me the forecast for
four different cities at once: Stan
ford, New York City where I'm
from Cambridge and New
Haven where my best friends go
to school. When our forecast is so

count the number of Facebook sta
tuses I posted along the lines of,

"LAYING OUT IN 70-DEGREE
WEATHER IN JANUARY. SO
HAPPY" or "SUCH A BEAUTI
FUL DAY!!!"

So, imagine how I feel now that I
can't brag.
On Monday afternoon, some
thing about The Axe & Palm
seemed strange to my friend and me
as we walked over from our dorm
we soon realized that we could
n't remember seeing it in cloudy
weather. Tuesday night, the sound
of wet, squeaky shoes against the
floor was foreign enough to cause
me to stop briefly and wonder what
noise I was hearing.
As I left the Daily building that

to see an unfamiliar sight: rain
falling in a continuous motion. I did
