# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## This Weather Sucks 
### Kristian Bailey 
Yesterday, for the first time I
can recall all year, it was
colder at Stanford than all
the major cities on the East Coast. It
was 58 degrees and partly sunny in
Cambridge, Mass., 62 degrees and
sunny in New York and 70 degrees
and sunny in Washington, D.C. Un
acceptable.
Like most Macßook owners, I
have the weather widget on my
dashboard. But my dashboard is
set up to show me the forecast for
four different cities at once: Stan
ford, New York City where I'm
from Cambridge and New
Haven where my best friends go
to school. When our forecast is so
much better than it is on the East
Coast, I take a screenshot of the re
ports, post it to Facebook and tag
all of my friends.
I know not a nice thing to do,
but I've only done this twice ...
And I think my caption from my
Jan. 14 upload says what I felt best:

"Sorry I kinda had to do this ...
it's just too good."
My freshman fall was catego
rized by excellent weather a hot
September and October, 70 degrees
during Big Game Week and 60 in
December. Nice as the fall may
have been, the first half of winter
quarter really outdid itself. Sure, it
was cloudy the first few weeks, but
no one can say that hitting 72 de
grees in late January and 79 degrees
in February is not phenomenal.
Beyond my rare photoblogging,
my friends back on the East Coast
can tell you I've not otherwise been
humble about our gorgeous weath

er this year. I can't even begin to
count the number of Facebook sta
tuses I posted along the lines of,

"LAYING OUT IN 70-DEGREE
WEATHER IN JANUARY. SO
HAPPY" or "SUCH A BEAUTI
FUL DAY!!!"

So, imagine how I feel now that I
can't brag.
On Monday afternoon, some
thing about The Axe & Palm
seemed strange to my friend and me
as we walked over from our dorm
we soon realized that we could
n't remember seeing it in cloudy
weather. Tuesday night, the sound
of wet, squeaky shoes against the
floor was foreign enough to cause
me to stop briefly and wonder what
noise I was hearing.
As I left the Daily building that
same night, I opened the backdoor
to see an unfamiliar sight: rain
falling in a continuous motion. I did

n't know what to do my instinct
was to retreat back inside, thinking
I could wait out the rain but then
I realized I just had to bear it.
So, I turned my scarf (the days
may be nice here, but the nights are
cold), into a shawl and sped back to
Flo Mo. My Facebook status that
night was: "Rain?! How do I deal
with this?!"

If you're on the East Coast and
are reading this, you're probably
thinking the same thing one of my
friends at Penn commented: "OH
NO NOT RAIN ANYTHING
BUT THE RAIN." But really, Ger
ren, this weather sucks.
Imagine trying to bike in the rain
your legs, perpendicular to the

falling rain, get much wetter than
they would if you walked, and your
jeans consequently feel like death.
If you're biking against the wind,
you can't see a thing and blindly
hope you won't crash into another
cyclist, the poles that close off
streets to cars or a car itself. And
even during the day, your hands
freeze against the cold and wet han
dlebars. It's truly Stanford's biggest
first world problem.
I've been told by many an upper
classman that I've been spoiled by
this winter I am fully aware of
this and wholeheartedly embrace it.
I've successfully worn shorts each
month I've been at Stanford, and I
haven't had to shovel any snow
(and New York has had a particu
larly nasty winter this year).
Yesterday during lunch, my en
tire dorm stared through the win
dows of the dining hall in awe. We
didn't understand how anyone

could want to go outside in such a
downpour. I could easily see how, in
a normal winter, after two or three
days of rain, class attendance might
drop.
Harvard and Yale might have
seasonal affective disorder (SAD),
but that's not what we signed on for,
right? Seasonal depression belongs
on the East Coast.
My pride was at stake in this
weather my friends never would
have let me live this down if they
discovered it before I pointed it out
myself. But I beat them to the chase.
And anyway, they can have their
one nice day. They're not the ones in
a position to complain that a fore
cast of 50 degrees and rain in Febru
ary is bad.

Hey East Coast, you've got some
snow headed your way in the next
week! If you 're mad, send some Kris
tian's way at kbailey@stanford.edu.

er this year. I can't even begin to
count the number of Facebook sta
tuses I posted along the lines of,

"LAYING OUT IN 70-DEGREE
WEATHER IN JANUARY. SO
HAPPY" or "SUCH A BEAUTI
FUL DAY!!!"

So, imagine how I feel now that I
can't brag.
On Monday afternoon, some
thing about The Axe & Palm
seemed strange to my friend and me
as we walked over from our dorm
we soon realized that we could
n't remember seeing it in cloudy
weather. Tuesday night, the sound
of wet, squeaky shoes against the
floor was foreign enough to cause
me to stop briefly and wonder what
noise I was hearing.
As I left the Daily building that
same night, I opened the backdoor
to see an unfamiliar sight: rain
falling in a continuous motion. I did

n't know what to do my instinct
was to retreat back inside, thinking
I could wait out the rain but then
I realized I just had to bear it.
So, I turned my scarf (the days
may be nice here, but the nights are
cold), into a shawl and sped back to
Flo Mo. My Facebook status that
night was: "Rain?! How do I deal
with this?!"

If you're on the East Coast and
are reading this, you're probably
thinking the same thing one of my
friends at Penn commented: "OH
NO NOT RAIN ANYTHING
BUT THE RAIN." But really, Ger
ren, this weather sucks.
Imagine trying to bike in the rain
your legs, perpendicular to the

falling rain, get much wetter than
they would if you walked, and your
jeans consequently feel like death.
If you're biking against the wind,
you can't see a thing and blindly
hope you won't crash into another
cyclist, the poles that close off
streets to cars or a car itself. And
even during the day, your hands
freeze against the cold and wet han
dlebars. It's truly Stanford's biggest
first world problem.
I've been told by many an upper
classman that I've been spoiled by
this winter I am fully aware of
this and wholeheartedly embrace it.
I've successfully worn shorts each
month I've been at Stanford, and I
haven't had to shovel any snow
(and New York has had a particu
larly nasty winter this year).
Yesterday during lunch, my en
tire dorm stared through the win
dows of the dining hall in awe. We
didn't understand how anyone

could want to go outside in such a
downpour. I could easily see how, in
a normal winter, after two or three
days of rain, class attendance might
drop.
Harvard and Yale might have
seasonal affective disorder (SAD),
but that's not what we signed on for,
right? Seasonal depression belongs
on the East Coast.
My pride was at stake in this
weather my friends never would
have let me live this down if they
discovered it before I pointed it out
myself. But I beat them to the chase.
And anyway, they can have their
one nice day. They're not the ones in
a position to complain that a fore
cast of 50 degrees and rain in Febru
ary is bad.

Hey East Coast, you've got some
snow headed your way in the next
week! If you 're mad, send some Kris
tian's way at kbailey@stanford.edu.
