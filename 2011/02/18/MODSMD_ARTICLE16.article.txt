## ONE MORE TIME STANFORD HEADS TO L.A. ON FINAL PAC- 10 ROAD TRIP 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After a relatively flat weekend
against the Washington schools, the
Stanford women's basketball team
will head south to Los Angeles for its
final road trip of the Pac-10 season
this weekend.

The No. 3 Cardinal (22-2, 13-0
Pac-10) looks to break out of a recent
mini-slump in Southern California
after it shot a season-worst 36.5 per
cent from the floor against Washing
ton last Saturday and trailed Wash
ington State midway through the first
half.

Even though Stanford managed

to extract two victories and stretch its
winning streak to 15, the perform
ance was far from the Cardinal's usu
ally dominant standard of play this
season.

But the Los Angeles schools gen
erally bring back some good vibes for
Stanford. In a two-game set at
Maples Pavilion in January, the Card
punished then-No. 8 UCLA (21-2,
11-1), 64-38, before trouncing USC
(15-8,7-5), 95-51.
Despite the performances against
the Washington teams, freshman for
ward Chiney Ogwumike said that the
Cardinal is focused and upbeat about
the last road trip of the regular season.
"It's a huge weekend for us," she
said. "Because going on the road is al
ways difficult, our approach is really
focused this weekend in particular."
First up for the Cardinal is the
USC Trojans, who have gone 3-2
since the last meeting with Stanford
but have a lineup of scorers that are
daunting to any program.
Guards Briana Gilbreath, Ashley
Corral and Jacki Gemelos all average
at least 11.7 points per game, and
Gilbreath is eighth best in the Pac-10
with 15.1 points per game.
The three guards combined for 27
points in last January's matchup
against the Cardinal, and Chiney Og
wumike said that more good play can
be expected from the Trojans and the
rest of the Pac-10.

"When you play in the Pac-10,
everyone knows you, they see you,
they scout you for the whole year, so
it's much more difficult to play in this
conference," she said. "We demand
excellence on the court, so people are
going to play their best game against
us. We have to come focused and con
centrate."

If the Cardinal can capture a vic
tory on Friday night, it will lock up a
first-round bye in next month's Pac
-10 tournament, but even with a victo
ry over the women of Troy, the con
ference title is still not a sure thing.
The No. 9 UCLA Bruins, Sunday's
hosts to the Cardinal, have only lost
one game in the Pac-10 the 64-38
loss at Maples Pavilion last month.
Chiney Ogwumike said that both
the Trojans and Bruins will be look
ing for revenge, a motivation that the
Cardinal cannot afford to overlook.

"We know that we executed very
well against them the first time, but
we know that the second time they're
going to come back stronger and
more studied," she said."[UCLA is] a
very hungry team, and they've
haven't lost a Pac-10 game besides us,
so we have to execute our game and
know our scouting report."
