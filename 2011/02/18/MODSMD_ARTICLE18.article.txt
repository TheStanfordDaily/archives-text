As I have written be

I belong to a small
class of fans who
love hockey. It's
fast paced, action packed and

brawled with one another
throughout the contest, an even
tual 9-3 win for the Isles. There
were 65 penalties, 346 penalty
minutes, 10 ejections and a goalie
fight. The stage for the showdown
was set in an earlier game be
tween the two teams, when Pens
goalie Brent Johnson broke a cou
