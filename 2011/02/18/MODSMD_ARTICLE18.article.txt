# The 						NHL is losing the fight

As I have written be
fore in these pages,
I belong to a small
class of fans who
love hockey. It's
fast paced, action packed and
viewer friendly, but the sport and
its highest league, the NHL, are
struggling mightily to grow and
gain fan support here in the U.S.
Part of the reason for these strug
gles is hockey's tradition of "fight
ing" on the ice, when two players
drop their gloves and go at it in an
old-fashioned fistfight. Most
teams employ enforcers whose
sole job is to rough up opposing
players.
Before last week, I was in the
ranks of the apologists for this as
pect of the sport. Sure, fighting
might turn off some fans, but it is
woven into the fabric of the sport.
Even without fighting, hockey is a
violent game, with players slam
ming into each other at high
speeds.
I'll even admit that there's

nothing that riles up the crowd at
a hockey game quite like a fight,
and elated cheers or disappointed
groans ripple through the arena
once the brawl has concluded, de
pending on the outcome. I myself
have often been in those ranks,
cheering on the Devils' enforcers
as they sought to bloody up oppo
nents.
Yet the events of a Feb. 11
game on Long Island between the
Pittsburgh Penguins and the New
York Islanders have irrevocably
turned me against fighting. It must
be banned from the NHL now if
the league hopes to salvage its
image and appeal to the broader
American sports consciousness.
To give a brief summation of
that game, the teams basically
brawled with one another
throughout the contest, an even
tual 9-3 win for the Isles. There
were 65 penalties, 346 penalty
minutes, 10 ejections and a goalie
fight. The stage for the showdown
was set in an earlier game be
tween the two teams, when Pens
goalie Brent Johnson broke a cou

pie of bones in Isles goalie Rick DiPi
etro's face during a goalie fight. After
the fight, fines and suspensions were
handed down to both teams.

The fallout from that game illus
trated clearly to me the main reason
why fighting should be tossed in the
trash: the only time hockey gets any
extended coverage on Sports Center
is around these types of brawls, feed
ing the negative image of hockey as a
game for brutes, rednecks and Cana
dians. Any given hockey game is lucky
to get five minutes of airtime on
ESPN's flagship program, but the
videos of this fight were replayed over
and over and over.

Over on the Internet, videos of
three or four fights going on simulta
neously on the ice headlined major

sports websites, while a chorus of
columnists decried the violence that
the sport had devolved into. When
Penguins owner Mario Lemieux
called out the NHL for a lack of
toughness in going after the perpetra
tors, it made headlines once again.

In order to further illustrate the
need for a ban on fighting, let's com
pare last week's brawl to another fa
mous altercation: the 2004 Pacers-
Pistons fight in Detroit, famously
prompted by a fan throwing a cup of
Diet Coke at Ron Artest. True, the
Malice at the Palace did a good deal
of damage to the NBA's image, but
the league took swift and decisive ac
tion against all involved, including
handing down suspensions to nine
players.

More importantly, that fight was
viewed as an aberration, sparked by a
couple of idiotic fans and one particu
larly hotheaded player. By contrast,
the Islanders and Penguins fought
each other in a systemic way as en

tire teams for an extended period
of time. The brawl is the natural out
come of the NHL's fighting culture:
when enforcers step over some un
written line (as they sometimes do),
the opposing team feels a need to re
spond with violence in kind.
The NHL needs to clean up its
image in order to expand, and ban
ning fighting would be an excellent
start. For too long, the sport's brutish
side has obscured what it has to offer
to the American fan. Hopefully, we'll
be able to look back on Feb. 11,2011
as a crucial moment in hockey's evo
lution, when it finally turned away
from violence and embraced the ele
ments that make the sport great.

Kabir likes to watch NHL fights
from the relative safety of his dorm
room. But if you are in the mood to
talk hockey, lumberjack competi
tions or anything else Canadian, send

viewed as an aberration, sparked by a
couple of idiotic fans and one particu
larly hotheaded player. By contrast,
the Islanders and Penguins fought
each other in a systemic way as en

tire teams for an extended period
of time. The brawl is the natural out
come of the NHL's fighting culture:
when enforcers step over some un
written line (as they sometimes do),
the opposing team feels a need to re
spond with violence in kind.
The NHL needs to clean up its
image in order to expand, and ban
ning fighting would be an excellent
start. For too long, the sport's brutish
side has obscured what it has to offer
to the American fan. Hopefully, we'll
be able to look back on Feb. 11,2011
as a crucial moment in hockey's evo
lution, when it finally turned away
from violence and embraced the ele
ments that make the sport great.

Kabir likes to watch NHL fights
from the relative safety of his dorm
room. But if you are in the mood to
talk hockey, lumberjack competi
tions or anything else Canadian, send
