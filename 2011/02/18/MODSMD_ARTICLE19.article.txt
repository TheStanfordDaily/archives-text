## Softball heads to Sin City 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Stanford Softball went 4-1 at the
Kajikawa Classic in Arizona last
weekend, the only loss coming at the
hands of Nebraska in extra innings.
Now the Card is back on the road for
this weekend's UNLV Louisville
Slugger Desert Classic in Las Vegas,
where the competition promises to be
even stiffer with the likes of No. 23
BYU, No. 9 Hawaii and No. 3 Ten
nessee all on the slate for Stanford.
The Cardinal required just five in
nings to dispatch Nevada and CS-
Northridge in Tucson last week, thanks
in part to an offensive attack that pro
duced 38 runs in five games. Junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen and sopho
more second baseman Jenna Rich both
have matched high preseason expecta
tions early in the season.
Hansen led the team with a .611 bat
ting average that included two triples,
and Rich hit two doubles, smashed four
home runs and tallied 13 RBI on the
opening weekend.
The season opener also featured the
return of sophomore pitcher Teagan
Gerhart from an arm injury that side
lined her for the latter part of last year.
Early returns were very promising as
Gerhart went 1-1 with a 0.82 ERA and
16 strikeouts on the weekend. Senior
counterpart Ashley Chinn was 3-0 with
16 strikeouts.
Coach John Rittman was pleased
with the debuts of his two freshmen
starters, designated player Danielle
Miller and left fielder Corey Hanewich
Miller hit two home runs and had
five total hits and five RBI, while
Hanewich hit a home run in her first
collegiate at bat and finished the week
end with two bombs.
Stanford kicks off the Desert Clas
sic with a doubleheader today against
Utah State and Portland State.The first
pitch is scheduled for 11:15 a.m.
