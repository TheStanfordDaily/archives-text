## Stanford contemplates NYC campus Site may house applied science, tech center

University President John Hennessy
announced during yesterday afternoon's
Faculty Senate meeting that Stanford is
investigating the invitation to establish a
New York City campus focused on ap
plied science and technology.
The University is "exploring" the pos
sibility, said spokeswoman Lisa Lapin
ahead of Thursday's meeting.
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced in December
that the city was seeking a "world-class
university" to partner with and build an
engineering school on public land. The
idea grew from the city's concern over at
tracting technology companies and jobs
to New York, which lacks a top graduate
school in engineering.

"This is sort of a first for us," Lapin
said. The idea is "still in the exploration
stage," she added.

"I think remembering that we are a
university that serves this nation, and I
think we need to take a page out of the
President's State of the Union address,"
Hennessy said when asked about the ad
vantages of such a center. "I think the
challenge in the U.S. is to create more
centers of innovation and vibrancy,
which this university is qualified to un
dertake."

U.S. News and World Report ranked
Stanford's engineering school second be
hind M.I.T. in 2010. The school's doctoral
programs in computer science, electrical
engineering and mechanical engineering
boast top rankings by the National Re
search Council, according to the school's
website.

Hennessy stressed that this would not
be a satellite campus operating similarly
to those hosted abroad with typically
one revolving faculty member pres
ent each quarter but an actual
second Stanford campus.
In addition to Stanford's 8,180-
acre home campus, the University
maintains Hopkins Marine Station
in Monterey, Calif., a program for un
dergraduates in Washington, D.C.,
and 11 overseas programs.
He said that initially, there would
be at least computer science and
electrical engineering departments
that would "admit faculty and stu
dents in an integrated fashion with
the University."
These departments would serve
as building blocks from which the
campus could expand over time. The
initial concept envisions hosting 25
faculty members, 125 Ph.D. students
and 250 masters students from the
School of Engineering and the Grad
uate School of Business, according to
a press release shared at the meeting.
According to Hennessy, much of

the response thus far has been posi
tive, but officials will discuss finances,
academic considerations and other
factors before reaching a final deci
sion.
"The time is coming when univer
sities will be in more than one loca
tion ... and I believe the institution
that figures out how to make it work
and make it work well will be in a sig
nificantly valued position," Hen
nessy said.
A team from Stanford, along with

representatives from approximately
15 other universities, attended an in
formational meeting with city offi
cials on Feb. 1 to learn more about
the project. Hennessy reiterated that
this project is "very much a competi
tion."

Official expressions of interest
are due by Mar. 16.
