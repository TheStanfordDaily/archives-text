University President John Hennessy
announced during yesterday afternoon's
Faculty Senate meeting that Stanford is
investigating the invitation to establish a
New York City campus focused on ap
plied science and technology.
The University is "exploring" the pos
sibility, said spokeswoman Lisa Lapin
ahead of Thursday's meeting.
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced in December
that the city was seeking a "world-class
university" to partner with and build an
engineering school on public land. The
idea grew from the city's concern over at
tracting technology companies and jobs
to New York, which lacks a top graduate
school in engineering.

"This is sort of a first for us," Lapin
said. The idea is "still in the exploration
stage," she added.

"I think remembering that we are a
university that serves this nation, and I
think we need to take a page out of the
President's State of the Union address,"
Hennessy said when asked about the ad
vantages of such a center. "I think the
challenge in the U.S. is to create more
centers of innovation and vibrancy,
which this university is qualified to un
dertake."

U.S. News and World Report ranked
Stanford's engineering school second be
hind M.I.T. in 2010. The school's doctoral
programs in computer science, electrical
engineering and mechanical engineering
boast top rankings by the National Re
search Council, according to the school's
website.

Hennessy stressed that this would not
be a satellite campus operating similarly
to those hosted abroad with typically
