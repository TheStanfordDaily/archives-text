The Stanford men's tennis team heads to
Seattle this weekend for its biggest test of the
young season, the ITA National Indoor Champi
onships. At 7-0 (1-0 Pac-10), the team is off to its
best start since 2002.
The Cardinal is seeded seventh in the 16-
team tournament, which will stretch from today
through Monday. The tournament is single-elim
ination but features a consolation bracket, guar
anteeing teams the opportunity to play at least
three matches.
Stanford is looking to avenge what was a poor
showing in the same tournament last year, when
it was trounced by Texas in the opening round.
The Cardinal has been on a roll through the
early part of its schedule this year, though, and
looks primed to present a tough challenge to the
lOth-seeded Florida Gators, Stanford's first
round opponent.
The Cardinal is on the same side of the draw
as No. 2 seed USC, and if both Pac-10 rivals win
their first matches, they will be pitted up against
each other in the quarterfinals on Saturday in
what would inevitably be a hard-fought match.
However first, Stanford has to take care of a
Florida team that is full of talent, but perhaps
somewhat unaccustomed to playing indoors due
to the prime tennis conditions that the state of
Florida provides. The Cardinal will be looking to
take advantage of this discrepancy in indoor
playing experience.
Leading the Stanford team as it tries to make
a statement against the best teams in the country
this weekend will be junior Bradley Klahn, the
team's No. 1 player and the reigning NCAA sin
gles champion.
Klahn spoke about the upcoming tourna
ment and what it means to the team.
"The National Team Indoor Championships
is a great tournament to really see where we
stand versus the top teams in the nation," he
said. "The top teams are all in it, and these are
