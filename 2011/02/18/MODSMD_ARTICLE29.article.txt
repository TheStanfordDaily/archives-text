## Grammy Performances 
### 
The 2011 Grammys brought its regular dose of
crazy fashion (Nicki Minaj's leopard explosion, |
Rihanna's weird toilet scrub dress), crazy upsets
(Arcade Fire wins Album of the Year!) and just gen
eral crazy (check out Gaga's alien pod). Interspersed
in all that were some mighty fine performances by J
some of the industry's finest around right now.

Opening with a strings-only rendition of "Nothin' On You," Mars stole
the show with a grin-inducing doo-wop version of "Grenade" that
added a rock 'n' roll edge to his typically smooth croon. Janelle Monae
amped up the energy afterwards with a frenzied "Cold War."

Cee Lo and Gwyneth's performance of "Forget You" (oh, censorship)
was utterly delightful. The stage was an explosion of color, peppered
with Muppets and topped off by Cee Lo's wackadoodle costume — a
chainmail headpiece and ridiculous, feathered bodysuit — paying
homage to Elton John's 1977 "Muppet Show" appearance.

The three acts were a fantastic tribute to folk music. Mumford & Sons
took the stage first with an exhilarating, banjo-strumming take on
their single, "The Cave." Next up were The Avett Brothers with a rous
ing "Head Full of Doubt, Road Full of Promise." Dylan strutted
onstage to end the performance with a throaty "Maggie's Farm,"
backed by Mumford & Sons and The Avett Brothers.

Their first performance, "Month of May," was bit chaotic between the
epileptic lights and BMX bikers, but the Montreal rockers, fresh off their
surprise Album of the Year win, toned down the sensory overload for the
much stronger "Ready to Start" which closed out the night.

As per her usual fashion, Lady Gaga arrived at the Grammys in a bizarre
alien egg contraption that made more sense when she hatched out of it
during her performance of her new Madonna-esque single, "Born This
Way." Other than the pod, Gaga, clad in a demure (for her) mustard yel
low ensemble and "I Dream of Jeannie" ponytail, kept things relatively
low-key, focusing more on choreography than spectacle.
