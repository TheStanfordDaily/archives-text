## Pledge pilot class slated as optional ResEd continues dialogue with leaders in Greek life 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
Following conversations with leaders
in both fraternities and sororities, Resi
dential Education (ResEd) plans to
launch a new class this spring for new
pledges in the Greek community. Plans
to implement an educational compo
nent to the pledging process were initial
ly met with complaints by members of
the Greek community because of a cited
lack of communication with Res Ed.
According to Amanda Rodriquez, as
sistant director of Residential Educa
tion and Greek Program Advisor, a one
unit course, Athletic 1: Alcohol & Flealth
in College Life, will likely be offered as
an optional pilot program for new
pledges.
The proposed course will explore
health and wellness topics "particularly
relevant to the Greek community," Ro
driguez wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
This initiative will be part of a larger
University effort to enhance new
member education and program
ming.

Potential course topics include
alcohol consumption, hazing, sexu
al assault and relationship abuse,
strategies to address the bystander
effect, responsible part hosting,
leadership training, philanthropy
and an overview of Greek life. The
course aims to offer comprehen
sive information to pledges across
campus, complement existing
pledge programs and encourage
partnerships between different
Greek councils.
Residential Education met with
Greek presidents and the head of
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
after news of the class broke. It
continues to collaborate with fra
ternity and sorority presidents to
shape and develop the pilot pro
gram.

However, there is confusion and
uncertainty among students sur
rounding the class.
At a presidents' meeting with
representatives from ResEd and
Vaden Health Center, Greek presi
dents did not seem to support
Res Ed's original proposal to insti
tute a mandatory, one-unit class this
spring.

"The opposition is from the ra
pidity with which it happened," said
Brian Tolkin 'l2, president of the
Sigma Nu fraternity.
Theta Delta Chi president Cody
Sam'l2 echoed Tolkin's sentiments.

"It was just so fast and we weren't
involved in the planning of it," he
said. "Mandatory, spring quarter just
isn't going to work."
The presidents met again last
week with Rodriguez, as well as
Ralph Castro, associate director of
Health Promotion Services (HPR)
and Jarreau Bowen, a health educa
tor at HPR. Castro and Bowen are
scheduled to teach the Alcohol &
Health course.

At the meeting, several Greek
presidents voiced their concerns.
Rodriguez said useful feedback
from that meeting resulted in the de

cision to make the course optional.
According to Katie McKeon 'l2,
president of Delta Delta Delta, Cas
tro and Bowen told students that the
course would make Stanford a pio
neer; no other American college has
a mandatory class for credit for
Greek pledges.
Although McKeon said she sup
ported the idea of expanding educa
tion for pledges, she noted that rep
resentatives from Vaden already
come to specific houses and individ
ual chapter meetings for education
al programs.

"This would make sense for them
because it would consolidate their
work into one class, but that doesn't
necessarily mean it will be effec
tive," she said.
Other concerns range from the
logistics of the class to the way it may
affect potential pledges' perception
of Greek life. Sam noted that it
would deter people from rushing.
Tolkin said it would be difficult to fit
600 people into a single room for the
class, which is scheduled to take
place in Cubberley Auditorium.
Brandon Mischel 'l2, president
of Kappa Alpha, observed that ath
letes generally have practice on Fri
days at the same time the class is
slated to take place.
On the whole, Greek presidents
seemed frustrated because details
about the class have yet to be re
leased. One president who request
ed to remain anonymous noted that
ResEd appeared to be "winging it,"
as it was unable to provide any
specifics about the course syllabus
or format. Bowen also said he has
yet to see a syllabus, and the course
is only four weeks away from imple
mentation.

However, Rodriguez said "Resi
dential Education/Fraternity and
Sorority Life is working with a
smaller group of presidents to re
view a possible curriculum" in the
hope that the program will produce
positive results.
"It is a priority for the University
that new member education and
programming be enhanced in com
ing years, and we look forward to
working with student leaders from
the Greek community to pursue
these endeavors," she said.
