## Pledge pilot class slated as optional ResEd continues dialogue with leaders in Greek life 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
Following conversations with leaders
in both fraternities and sororities, Resi
dential Education (ResEd) plans to
launch a new class this spring for new
pledges in the Greek community. Plans
to implement an educational compo
nent to the pledging process were initial
ly met with complaints by members of
the Greek community because of a cited
lack of communication with Res Ed.
According to Amanda Rodriquez, as
sistant director of Residential Educa
tion and Greek Program Advisor, a one
unit course, Athletic 1: Alcohol & Flealth
in College Life, will likely be offered as
an optional pilot program for new
pledges.
The proposed course will explore
health and wellness topics "particularly
relevant to the Greek community," Ro
driguez wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
