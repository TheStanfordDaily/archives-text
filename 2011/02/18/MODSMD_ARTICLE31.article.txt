## Calafia stretches itself too thin

Y ■ ie average American has
eaten some 1,500 peanut but
-A- ter and jelly sandwiches
before he or she graduates high
school; that is almost one sandwich
every four days since birth. The secret
to such an addicting recipe is to not
spread the ingredients too thin a
couple heaping globs of the magic at
the top of the food pyramid. Calafia
Cafe does not seem to have that part
down though. By trying to please
everyone and going too wide, they
spread themselves too thin and don't

shine on any dimension.
The cafe (as distinct from the
Market A-Go-Go side) is a cute
restaurant for a relaxed lunch or a
relatively upscale dinner for those in

a bit of a rush. The decor is well done
and provides an inviting atmosphere,
despite the commotion in the
kitchen.
After sitting down, it's easy to
notice that the menu has no clear
direction and is overly eclectic. Amid
mainly American cuisine, there are
large Asian and Latin influences that
tend to come out fairly mediocre. For
example, the duck dumplings are
easily forgotten. They are almost
deep fried, lending a particularly
heavy feeling to the duck. The
Enchilada Special is well plated, but,
similar to the dumplings, the dish
takes on a heavier feel than necessary
with the sour cream and does not
provide commensurate flavor. The
Really Angry Pork Tacos are simply
unbalanced. The "anger" is derived
from a pinch of minced, pickled
