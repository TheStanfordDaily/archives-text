## Calafia stretches itself too thin 
### — joshua GLUCOFT contact josh: glucoft@stanford. edu 
Y ■ ie average American has
eaten some 1,500 peanut but
-A- ter and jelly sandwiches
before he or she graduates high
school; that is almost one sandwich
every four days since birth. The secret
to such an addicting recipe is to not
spread the ingredients too thin a
couple heaping globs of the magic at
the top of the food pyramid. Calafia
Cafe does not seem to have that part
down though. By trying to please
everyone and going too wide, they
spread themselves too thin and don't

shine on any dimension.
The cafe (as distinct from the
Market A-Go-Go side) is a cute
restaurant for a relaxed lunch or a
relatively upscale dinner for those in

a bit of a rush. The decor is well done
and provides an inviting atmosphere,
despite the commotion in the
kitchen.
After sitting down, it's easy to
notice that the menu has no clear
direction and is overly eclectic. Amid
mainly American cuisine, there are
large Asian and Latin influences that
tend to come out fairly mediocre. For
example, the duck dumplings are
easily forgotten. They are almost
deep fried, lending a particularly
heavy feeling to the duck. The
Enchilada Special is well plated, but,
similar to the dumplings, the dish
takes on a heavier feel than necessary
with the sour cream and does not
provide commensurate flavor. The
Really Angry Pork Tacos are simply
unbalanced. The "anger" is derived
from a pinch of minced, pickled

habanero peppers that still overwhelms the other
wise boring tacos with their spice. By not pairing
the peppers with other strong flavors and ingredi
ents, the tacos just fade away.
Calafia also offers a wide range of vegetari
an options, but these, in general, are a disaster.
For example, the Spinach Dragon Noodle Bowl
does not seem to bother with trying to look
appetizing. The only divergence from what
appears like a yellow mess of curry is a few
sprigs of parsley that also stand out too much in
flavor. The dish is relatively bland and has a ter
rible texture. The Tofu Lentil Loaf is a complete
miss as well. The loaf itself is intensely dry, and
the texture isn't saved by the miso mushroom

gravy. Only an acute peppery flavor comes
through from the loaf or the accompanying
mashed potatoes.
The vegetarian sides fare only slightly bet
ter. The Carrot Almond Salad has no flavor to it
except that of plain carrots and carries with it an
almost fetid smell from the rice vinegar. The
same vinegar also causes the toasted almonds to
become soggy and gives the whole dish a dis
pleasing mouthfeel. The Butternut Chilijack is
surprisingly under-seasoned. While not a bad
option, it is a far cry from providing the feelings
normally associated with a warm bowl of chili
on a cold day. The Ginger Mashed Yams have a
nice ginger kick to their creamy texture and are

certainly among the best vegetarian options;
unfortunately they're only a side.
The generic American options are generally
the strongest on the menu. The Fiery Bottom
BBQ Pork Bowl was well balanced and delicious.
The BBQ sauce has a mild but sufficient spiciness
to it and never comes off as overwhelming. The
bed of brown rice, yams and spinach round off
the bowl nicely with a bit of sweetness and a
fluffier texture that doesn't leave you lethargic like
BBQ often does. Wolfgang's Pizza is certainly tasty
but not exactly culinary mastery; it's difficult to

miss when presenting a bed of
pesto, cheese and fatty red
meat (duck), but there was

nothing particularly interesting or subtle about
the flavor profile.
After wading through the real misfires, there
are a handful of good plates at Calafia that could
satisfy you. In the end though, nothing stands
out, and you would not be remiss to pass this
over in your time at Stanford. In general, it's in
the "middle of the road."
