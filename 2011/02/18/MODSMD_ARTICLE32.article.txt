## STATION CAFE IN SAN CARLOS: Food So Good, It Shouldn't Be Allowed 
### â€” evie DANFORTH contact evie: erdanfor@stanford. edu 
Have you ever loved
the bread offered in a
restaurant's bread
basket so much that you dis
cretely tucked all the pieces
into your dining companion's
purse for later use and then

asked the waiter for refills? I hadn't until I ate
lunch at Station Cafe in San Carlos, a cafe that
just opened in November. All quarter,
Stanford's Program for Ethics in Society has
been feeding me weekly, in-class lunches
catered by the Station Cafe (full disclosure: the
program coordinator's husband owns the
place). And although I'm all for actually learn
ing in class, going to a seminar every

Wednesday knowing that really, really good
food lies in wait has become a major weekly
highlight. And after a month of watching oth
erwise tame ethics honors students (aided and
abetted by our instructor, himself a tenured
professor of political philosophy) rhapsodize
about lemon-blueberry tarts and argue about
who gets the last of the parmesan cheese, I
knew I had to go straight to the source.
Station Cafe could be closer to campus,
but the drive up El Camino is straightforward
and not really longer than an In-N-Out run.

Plus, driving up to San Carlos is a
nice break from University
Avenue and Town and Country's
eerily tidy, Disneyland-like quali
ties. As an added bonus, the cafe is
literally across the street from the
San Carlos Caltrain station, mak-

ing it a convenient pit stop for all you train-rid
ing enthusiasts in the Stanford community.
Inside, the place looks like the kind of
casual, cute bakery you could find in any
European country that's embraced the welfare
state and whose people sit for hours lingering
over espresso, arcane philosophical discussions
and deserts with hard-to-pronounce names.

The sun was shining, so we decided to nab a
table in the small but very pleasant outside area
although it was hard to leave the gleaming,
incredibly fancy-looking espresso machine
indoors, which had a magnetic quality for a
coffee nerd like me.
Station Cafe's menu is simple and brief,
restricted largely to pizza, pasta and salad offer
ings; for people overwhelmed by the total glut
that is the 20-something page Cheesecake
Factory menu, this makes for a great change.

The salads are all excellent I especially liked
an avocado, orange and almond concoction

that we devoured dur
ing one in-class session
on the ethics of online
anonymity. For our
lunch at the cafe,
however, my friend
and I ordered heav-

ier but equally
amazing dishes a plate of prosciutto mixed
with fresh pear and parmesan cheese for her
and fusili pasta in a classic tomato sauce with
capers, sundried tomatoes, spinach, olives and
sausage for me. Both were really amazing; in an
age of molecular gastronomy and fusion foods
that take the paradigm way too far (Korean
tacos, anyone?), it becomes easy to forget the
value of basic foods prepared well and with
really good ingredients. Their addictive bread

fresh and homemade, but not some kind of
crazy nouveau take on bread by any means,
serves as further testament to the power of

food that's just simple and really yummy. The
best part of Station Cafe, however, comes at the
end of the meal their deserts are straight up

amazing. The actual offerings seem to change
from day to day, but whoever is cooking them
deserves some kind of highly prestigious
award. The unequivocal favorite, however, are
the zepolle, a kind of Italian doughnut think
flaky, puffy pastry coated in coarse-grained
sugar. At only $0.75 each, these zepolle are, in
the words of an anonymous Ethics in Society
student, "so good it shouldn't be allowed."
Honestly, I think that's a quote that applies to
the entire establishment. Station Cafe is defi
nitely worth trying.
