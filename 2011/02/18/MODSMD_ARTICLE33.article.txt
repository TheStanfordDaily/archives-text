## 'Monologues' charms with winning cast 
### â€” eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
Nobody talks about vaginas. The word is
avoided in conversation it's to be spo
ken in hushed voices and accompanied
by giggles or shouted as the punch line to a dirty
joke or waved like a battle flag by the kind of mil
itant feminists that many refuse to take seriously.
But with "The Vagina Monologues," Eve Ensler
singlehandedly turns this social norm on its head,
making the vagina a symbol of empowerment
and strength and independence and womanhood
while maintaining enough wit and hilarity to
charm even the most cynical of viewers. The
exceptional student cast channels the humor,
directness and poignancy of Ensler's words to
make for a truly memorable experience. And the
fact that the "Vagina Monologues" are based on a
series of interviews with real women each
monologue is either a true story for a single
women or a compilation from several only
acts to heighten the empathy of the audience,
strengthening both the humor and the tragedy of
the piece.

Most striking about the show was the range
of topics: the monologues varied from laugh-out
loud funny to empowering to downright devas
tating. When Morgan Duffy'l3 ranted about her
"Angry Vagina," her alternating cold sarcasm and
white-hot fury brought about howls of laughter
in the audience, and Leslie Brian 'l2 was met by
raucous laughter as she mused about her eccen
tric experiences in a "Vagina Workshop." And yet,
as soon as you'd grown comfortable and you felt
like you knew exactly what kind of a show you
were watching, you would be abruptly yanked
out of your comfort zone and thrown into the
profound, the tragic and the alarming. I got chills
when the women performed a speech from the
transgender perspective, I trembled as I watched
Belinda Chiang's 'lO deeply disturbing account of
a girl who had been gang-raped for days by six
soldiers, and I'm certain that I was not alone. The
show was uncompromising and wild; it refused
to be predictable.
One might expect this inconsistency to take
you out of the moment, but the vast range was

much of what
made the show
really work: it
never lingered on
tragedy long
enough to feel
preachy. Instead,
it made its
impression,
painted a single
absolutely heart
breaking
moment that the
audience could
truly believe in
and then whisked
us away to an

equally believable moment of hilarity. The con
trast between each monologue didn't make them
undermine each other to the contrary, they
helped to build on each other, overlapping to cre
ate a single multifaceted feeling, a sort of summa
ry of the female experience.

A few high points: Lyn Mehe'ula's 'll mono
logue from the perspective of a queer woman
with a history of sexual abuse was one of the
most compelling and believable performances of
the night, and Ariel Mazel-Gee's 'l2 account of a
female-only sex worker (in which she writhed
and kicked her way through impressions of
increasingly absurd female orgasms) was undeni
ably hilarious.
At the end of the night, despite the small size
of the Wednesday audience, "Vagina
Monologues" was compelling enough to easily
melt away any cynicism and reluctance; the audi
ence was quick to laugh and though initially
quiet and reluctant shouted along when the
show called for audience participation. "Vagina
Monologues" had no need for complex props or
costumes; it got by on the charm of its cast and
the truly authentic feel to its material. Whether
you're seeking an educational and empowering
experience or just looking for a laugh, head to
Cubberley tonight for the final show and you will
find what you are looking for.
