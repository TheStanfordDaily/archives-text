"Taboos" is one of the latest plays by
Stanford scientist-turned-playwright
Carl Djerassi. It explores the conse
quences of nontraditional birth
everything from the use of sperm
donors to in vitro fertilization and
how that affects the modern definition
of parenthood. The story is set in
modern-day San Francisco and
Jackson, Miss. By creating a story
about five adults, two families, several
different ideologies and a handful of
children, Djerassi writes a very mod
ern, intriguing play about what it
means to be a parent in the face of
new reproductive technology.
The play begins with Harriet and
Sally, a lesbian couple, meeting on
their first date in San Francisco.
Harriet, a doctor, is confident and
witty from beginning, while Sally, a
TV reporter, is more soft-spoken and
easily flustered. Their conversation
starts out awkwardly but quickly
moves into witty rapport, establishing
a relationship that, a few time skips
later, becomes a domestic partnership.
The couple, mainly at Sally's
insistence, decides to have a baby. To
do so, they enlist the help of Harriet's
brother, Max, to be the sperm donor.
Things are simple enough until Sally's
conservative brother Cameron arrives
in San Francisco from Mississippi. He
immediately takes issue not only with
Sally's "unnatural" relationship with
Harriet but also their unconventional
means of pregnancy.
Controversial or not, Sally and
Harriet's first child is born, and all
seems well until Harriet starts feel
ing left out of their marriage.
Meanwhile, back in Mississippi,
Cameron and his wife Priscilla strug
gle to become pregnant and begin to
look at other options like in vitro.
Cameron, who has begun visiting his
sister in San Francisco more often, has
become more open-minded about
their unusual relationship, unlike his
staunchly religious wife.
Things take a turn for the com
plicated when Harriet and Cameron
secretly make a deal Cameron will
donate sperm to Harriet so she can be
a mother as well, and she will donate
eggs to Cameron so that Priscilla can
undergo in vitro fertilization. Soon,
two more babies, biologically twins
but born to different mothers, are

born, and the complications between
the families ensue.

Throughout the play, the conflict
of different beliefs is strongly present.
Cameron and his wife Priscilla are

often seen praying and quoting the
bible, while Harriet and Sally make
noticeably more rational arguments
for equality. Although the glaring con
trast between liberal San Francisco

and conservative Mississippi seems a
touch cliche, it serves the purpose of
exploring how different ideologies
react to the issues at hand in the play.
More interestingly, the play

explores implications of nontraditional
birth and parenthood. For example, if
one woman donates an egg but anoth
er carries the child to term, who can be
called the mother? Can a man be a

biological father but officially just an
uncle? What is the best option for the
children created out of such unions?
Although the play raises more ques
tions than it answers, it certainly is
enough to get the audience thinking.
The tone of the play carried the
themes well. Although it was very dia
logue-heavy and mostly serious, witty
dialogue and stinging one-liners were
sprinkled throughout the 90-minute
performance, lightening the mood
and keeping the audience engaged.
The acting throughout the play
was strong. Chloe Bronzan stood out
especially, portraying Harriet as a

character who was at once confident
and insecure, and forced to balance
her own desires with what was best for
her growing family. Courtney Walsh
also shined as Priscilla, who, in stark
contrast to Harriet, stood up for tradi

tional Christian family values and also
fought for her opportunity to be a
mother.
"Taboos" is a fascinating, witty
and entertaining exploration of the
implications of nontraditional birth.
Djerassi does an excellent job of
expressing many of the issues, compli
cations and emotions surrounding
this issue through his characters.
