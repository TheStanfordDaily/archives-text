cc -w-Am Number Four" is a new movie by
I director D.J. Caruso, whose previous
-M-movies include "Disturbia" and "Eagle
Eye." It is neither a particularly good movie nor
a very memorable one and suffers from being
too generic. On the plus side, though, it does
feature some pretty, pretty people.
"I Am Number Four" is about a teenager,
John Smith a.k.a. Number Four (Alex Pettyfer)

who is real
ly an alien
with special
powers. He
is on the
run with
his warrior

protector Henri (Timothy Olyphant) from evil
aliens. When John senses the death of "Number
Three," he and Henri go on the run again this
time to Paradise, Ohio where John meets love
interest Sarah (Dianna Agron) and nerdy side
kick Sam (Callan McAuliffe).
The movie is unoriginal and lacks direction
and tone. For the first half of the movie, it does
n't seem to be able to decide whether it wants to
be a high school romance or if it wants to be

more of an action-adventure movie. There are
elements of science fiction in it, too, such as a
brief history of the alien races, but it all seems
casually tacked on. The characters can't even

keep their backgrounds straight. Henri men

tions that only Number Four and Number Nine
have powers, but that's clearly not the case when
Number Six (Teresa Palmer) shows up. All the
aliens have fake-looking swords that glow,
though, so I honestly was not expecting much in
that department.
"I Am Number Four" borrows heavily
from other popular movies. The evil aliens
resemble Lord Voldemort. Some of John's pow
ers are Jedi-like; he even uses a Darth Vader
death grip a few times. At times, "I Am Number

Four" really feels like a checklist of popular
movie cliches. Romance between the girl and
the mysterious new kid? Check. Rebelling
against parental authority? Check. Even though
John is in grave danger and must keep a low
profile, he insists on attending school. High
school drama? Absolutely. Even though the
stereotypes are painfully obvious (i.e. obligatory
school bully, the outcast, etc.) at the school,
everyone still feels the need to constantly talk
about their social status. The result of the com

bination of all these cliches is not the ultimate
popcorn flick but a movie that limps along.
It's not all bad though some of the per
formances keep the movie interesting. Pettyfer is
pretty flat, but his co-stars Agron and Olyphant
are both pretty charismatic. McAuliffe is also lik
able when he's not spewing off dialogue to fur
ther the plot.
At its best, "I Am Number Four" is a light
hearted action movie that doesn't take itself too
seriously. It gets into an okay groove toward the
end and has a few good moments, but every-

thing seems to fit together too nicely.
Coincidences happen too frequently. The visual
effects are not that great and are only a small
step up from the visual effects seen in the aver
age action TV show.
Ultimately, though, it just feels too generic
and panders to a high school audience. Why not
explore themes that are not cliche? John devel
ops quite the penchant for using his Darth

Vader grip it would have been interesting to
see a movie about that. Sam was raised by his
dad who believes in aliens, so growing up, Sam
thought that believing in aliens was the norm
I'd rather see a movie about that.
