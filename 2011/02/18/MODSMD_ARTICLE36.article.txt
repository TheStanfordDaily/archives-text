Most students only pull all-nighters to
study for midterms or write papers.
However, those participating in the
Stanford Campus MovieFest loaded up on caf
feine and spent Monday night putting the final
touches on their competing films.
Organized by members of the Stanford
Film Society, Stanford Campus MovieFest
(CMF) is an opportunity for amateur filmmak
ers to create their best five-minute film in just a
weeklong process. Competitors submitted their
productions on Tuesday and await the screening
event and judging results on Sunday night. First
place winners receive an iPod Touch or Nano
and an invitation to the International Grand
Finale in June.
Campus MovieFest, now a worldwide event,

originated at Emory University less than a
decade ago. Since then, the festival has expanded
to cater to over 50,000 students per year, supply
ing high-quality equipment to each participant
to produce a film.
"The materials they give you are awesome,"
said Casey Stewart 'l3, an organizer of Stanford
CMF. "It's a great opportunity to work with
some nice stuff"
Stanford has not hosted CMF since 2008,
but the Stanford Film Society made its return a
priority.
"The decision to bring CMF back was col
lective," said Jennifer Schaffer'l4, an Intermission
writer who also led the Stanford CMF team. "We
have been trying really hard to build a more solid
and noticeable film community on campus."
"It was one of our main goals this year,"
added Sam Pressman 'll, co-director of the Film
Society.

Despite the three-year gap, CMF has had
"an amazing response" this year, according to
Schaffer, handing out all 50 sets of equipment in
under three hours. However, the process of film
making was a long and arduous one for Stanford

students in the middle of the quarter, with many
difficulties along the way. With just seven days to
produce a coherent, five-minute story, many
filmmakers made the decision to work in groups
in order to finish their tasks and drew inspiration
from previous material.
"I filmed with my friend we have a com
pany, Polynice Pictures, together," said Pressman,
who also created a movie for the festival. "We
watched a film in a class with our favorite profes
sor that sparked our concept."
Some participants also felt the pressure of
having just a week to complete their films, espe
cially in the midst of midterms.
"It's almost kind of unreasonable to ask for
five minutes in a week... that's a substantial
amount of time for just one week, and I really
only have this weekend," said Tayo Amos' 14,
who teamed up with her roommate to produce a
film.

However, others
expressed gratitude for the
regulations, arguing that it
catalyzes the artistic process
that is often delayed due to

classwork
"I think there's value in time constraints.
Having a deadline and a competitive feel and
being forced to make it happen is a beneficial
thing for creating art," Schaffer said.
Although the filmmaking process is often
perceived as ritualistic, sticking closely to a script,
participants enjoyed the constant improvisation
their filmmaking entailed.
"It leaves you to be creative. Yesterday, I was
filming and could only get two of my friends out
to San Francisco to do a scene, so we had to grab
people off the street. It was a cool experience,"
Pressman said.

Pressman also added that he enjoyed creat
ing a short film instead of a longer piece.
"The short film allows you to explore one
