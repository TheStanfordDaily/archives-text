## Brentano thrills and moves audience

String quartets play chamber manic, which has always been
intended for relatively small audiences. After the concert, the
Brentano String Quartet's second violinist, Serena Canin,
remarked that the group usually plays in smaller venues than
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, one of the largest on campus, which was
almost three-quarters full on Sunday afternoon. However, the
warm sounds of the stringed instruments created such a homey
atmosphere that any doubts about the perhaps unsuitably large
turnout were immediately and happily forgotten.

The concert opened with a series
of four Renaissance-era pieces by
Orlando Gibbons and the well-known
William Byrd. The quartet's enormous
talent was obvious not only in each
member's mastery of his instrument,
but also in how it managed to stay
perfectly in sync even in pizzicato sec
tions, which are notoriously difficult
for any music group without a con
ductor. Historically, string quartets
came after the Renaissance era, but
that didn't prevent the Brentano String
Quartet from effortlessly transporting
the audience 400 years into the past.
No Brentano String Quartet con
cert would be complete without a
Beethoven string quartet given that the
group's name comes from the proba
ble name of Beethoven's mysterious
"Immortal Beloved," a woman whose
identity to this day remains unclear.
They played op. 135, the F major quar
tet, to great applause at the end of the
first half of the concert.
The second half of the program
a series of short pieces, each about four
minutes showcased the quartet's
impressive ability to switch between
distant genres with great ease. Each

piece was different from the previous:
the program jumped from a piece by
eyebrow-raising Charles Ives (made all
the more so due to the fact that it was a
scherzo) to the beautiful second move
ment of Tchaikovsky's D major quartet
to an arrangement of Robert Pete
Williams's "I've Grown So Ugly," which
involved the cellist slapping her instru
ment to create sounds one wouldn't
ever expect to hear from a stringed
instrument. When that last piece was
over, the audience erupted in giggles.
The quartet manipulated the
audience's emotion with the skill of a
great cellist bowing his instrument,
from the sadness of Tchaikovsky to
the playfulness of Williams, to the sec
ond Dvorak waltz, the sunniness of
which would have had this author up
and happily waltzing in a heartbeat.
Though the audience was mostly
geriatric, at the end of the two hours
there was no languor in the audience's
leaping to its feet for a thundering
ovation. It seems that Stanford
unequivocally thinks the more string
quartet concerts, the better! As will any
other venue fortunate enough to be on
the Brentano String Quartet's tour.
