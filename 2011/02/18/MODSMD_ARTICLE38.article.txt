## Stegner Reading: Nina Schloesser and Ryan Teitman 
### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
It was 7 p.m. on a Wednesday, and it was raining
outside, but the Terrace Room in the English
building was packed, and for good reason.
Stegner Fellows Nina Schloesser and Ryan Teitman
each read from their recent works the former from

the first chapter of a novel-in
progress and the latter several
poems to a warm and enthu
siastic audience who was not
disappointed.
Schloesser started out hesi
tant, quiet, with what could have
been a slight accent, reading
with her head down she
needn't have. The subject matter
was unorthodox her protago
nist was a slightly insecure,
novice pickup artist at a gay bar
and the introduction some
what protracted, as she spent
quite some time developing the
main character's psychology, but
as soon as she got to the action

of the story, Schloesser had the audience chuckling at
the character's awkward and increasingly desperate
antics. She finished her excerpt to resounding
applause and even, if it may be believed, a few catcalls
Teitman's poetry drew from his experiences as a
journalist and his first-hand knowledge of several
cities. His reading was bookended by an ode to his
childhood hometown of Philadelphia and an equally
nuanced depiction of one of San Francisco's well
known secrets, the Sutro Baths. Some of his other

poems are influenced by art, including one that was
inspired by a maker of stained glass windows and
another by Gustave Moreau's painting "Orpheus," on
loan to the de Young Museum from the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris. His audience listened in rapt atten-

tion to his words, some even sit
ting with their eyes closed, slight
smiles on their lips, as if picturing
the images he painted in their
minds' eye. As one audience
member remarked after the read
ing, "I'll have that image of a
burning hawk seared into my
mind forever."
Indeed, despite the lateness of
the hour and the long commute
that some of the audience had
ahead of them there were quite
a few people who had come down
from San Francisco nearly the
entire room stayed afterwards to
personally congratulate Schloesser
and Teitman on a fine night's

work. Said Teitman of the crowd, "I think it's won
derful that the department provides this space for us,
and everyone in the creative writing community is so
supportive. We had a great turnout tonight." If this is
the quality we come to expect of these readings, then
we may expect Stegner Fellows to continue to read
for a full house.

I'll have
that image of a
burning hawk
seared into my
mind forever.
