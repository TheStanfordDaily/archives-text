## Man vs. IBM Supercomputer

CC >f r " Watson, come here.
I\ /I I want you!"
Fittingly, these were the first
words to be communicated via tele
phone, when the device's inventor
Alexander Graham Bell called, literal
ly, upon his friend in 1876. If this were
an English essay, I would dissect the
use of the imperative and its implica
tion that humans demand new tech
nology; I would argue that the prox
imity of the pronouns, separated by
the small verb "want," highlights not
only the ability of machine to bring
men together but also the intrinsic
similarity of man to his creation.

What does all of this have to do with
the TV shows we know and love and
their human-centric content?

This week, "Jeopardy!" called
upon technology to sate its viewers'
desire for the inspiration of extreme
intelligence, the suspense of competi
tion and the drama of favorites and
underdogs. Monday, Tuesday and

Wednesday evening, Alex Trebek
played referee to a heavyweight intel
lectual title match between former
champions Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter and newcomer Watson, the
IBM supercomputer. Named for the
founder of IBM, Thomas J. Watson,
Watson tied Rutter on the first night
of play and trounced his opponents
on Tuesday despite botching the
"Final Jeopardy" in the hopes of win
ning one million dollars and validat
ing years of development.

The Watson avatar that towers
imposingly next to Jennings and
Rutter is metonymic of 16 terabytes
of RAM, housed in an offsite com
puter the size of 10 refrigerators. Into
that computer, IBM scanned approxi
mately one million documents:

books, movie scripts and entire ency
clopedias. The computer receives the
question via text and breaks down
Jeopardy's notoriously labyrinthine
language into discrete units before
searching its own content, not the
Internet, for the answer.

While the details of what makes
Watson tick are fascinating, I'm more
intrigued by what this phenomenon

means to reality television and the
desires of American audiences. James
Cameron's "Avatar" bridged reality
and animation with the Na'vi, entic
ing viewers with the ambiguous state
of its actors. "Jeopardy!" never fea-

tures actors reciting lines and playing
roles, but the show is not without its
characters: the patient condescension
of Alex Trebek, the lazily smug inten
sity of Ken Jennings. The show even
returns from its first commercial

break with each contestant sharing a
story of his or her regular humanity.
In 2011, when you throw a super
computer into the mix, Watson, too,
must participate in this cult of
human potential that "Jeopardy!"
enshrines. Watson's predecessor, Deep
Blue, defeated chess grandmaster
Gary Kasparov in 1997, when the
narrative was of the differences
between computers and humans.
Watson's presentation on the show
suggests that this technology seeks to
optimize human behavior, not render

it obsolete.
For example, Watson is palatable
visually, standing as a regular plasma
screen between his two human com
petitors as opposed to overpowering
them. When Watson thinks, we see
dots connect on a globe much in the

way our synapses fire, so that we
know he is thinking, even if his reac
tion time would suggest otherwise. As
Watson delivers his answer, we see his
percentage of certainty, which is
communicated in humans by pauses,
vocal tone, and facial expression.
IBM, and surely the "Jeopardy!" pro
ducers, has designed Watson to dis
play simultaneously his equivalence
with and superiority to humans.
Such a combination renders Watson
inherently attractive to viewers.
If we've reached the point where
a computer can be an attractive pro
tagonist, can we replace human con
testants and actors with technology?
Movies from the 1980s such as "Short
Circuit" emphasize the camaraderie

of man and machines and the
desire of the latter to enter the
world of the former. In three
nights of "Jeopardy!," Watson
occupied more screen time than
Jennings, Rutter or Trebek,
demoting those three celebrities to
supporting roles. Do we treat Watson
the same way we did Jennings in his
heyday we marvel at his success
while secretly hoping he'll prove falli
ble? For me, the answer is no. As
much as this television event centers
on the nature of "Jeopardy!," ulti
mately this is a showcase for IBM and
its human engineers. We can't root
against something man has created,
and, as a result, technology will never
fully replace human actors on televi
sion, reality or scripted. These forms
of storytelling require complementa
ry elements of good guys and bad

guys and immerse the reader in their
created worlds. If a computer or
avatar were the star of a television
show, audiences would be immersed
in the technology rather than the
story and thus would never believe an
antagonist. Watson has become a
sensation on "Jeopardy!" because he
is writing his own story, the story of
human progress. Because even an
HBO miniseries isn't long enough to
cover all of that.

played referee to a heavyweight intel
lectual title match between former
champions Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter and newcomer Watson, the
IBM supercomputer. Named for the
founder of IBM, Thomas J. Watson,
Watson tied Rutter on the first night
of play and trounced his opponents
on Tuesday despite botching the
"Final Jeopardy" in the hopes of win
ning one million dollars and validat
ing years of development.

The Watson avatar that towers
imposingly next to Jennings and
Rutter is metonymic of 16 terabytes
of RAM, housed in an offsite com
puter the size of 10 refrigerators. Into
that computer, IBM scanned approxi
mately one million documents:

books, movie scripts and entire ency
clopedias. The computer receives the
question via text and breaks down
Jeopardy's notoriously labyrinthine
language into discrete units before
searching its own content, not the
Internet, for the answer.

While the details of what makes
Watson tick are fascinating, I'm more
intrigued by what this phenomenon

means to reality television and the
desires of American audiences. James
Cameron's "Avatar" bridged reality
and animation with the Na'vi, entic
ing viewers with the ambiguous state
of its actors. "Jeopardy!" never fea-

tures actors reciting lines and playing
roles, but the show is not without its
characters: the patient condescension
of Alex Trebek, the lazily smug inten
sity of Ken Jennings. The show even
returns from its first commercial

break with each contestant sharing a
story of his or her regular humanity.
In 2011, when you throw a super
computer into the mix, Watson, too,
must participate in this cult of
human potential that "Jeopardy!"
enshrines. Watson's predecessor, Deep
Blue, defeated chess grandmaster
Gary Kasparov in 1997, when the
narrative was of the differences
between computers and humans.
Watson's presentation on the show
suggests that this technology seeks to
optimize human behavior, not render

it obsolete.
For example, Watson is palatable
visually, standing as a regular plasma
screen between his two human com
petitors as opposed to overpowering
them. When Watson thinks, we see
dots connect on a globe much in the

way our synapses fire, so that we
know he is thinking, even if his reac
tion time would suggest otherwise. As
Watson delivers his answer, we see his
percentage of certainty, which is
communicated in humans by pauses,
vocal tone, and facial expression.
IBM, and surely the "Jeopardy!" pro
ducers, has designed Watson to dis
play simultaneously his equivalence
with and superiority to humans.
Such a combination renders Watson
inherently attractive to viewers.
If we've reached the point where
a computer can be an attractive pro
tagonist, can we replace human con
testants and actors with technology?
Movies from the 1980s such as "Short
Circuit" emphasize the camaraderie

of man and machines and the
desire of the latter to enter the
world of the former. In three
nights of "Jeopardy!," Watson
occupied more screen time than
Jennings, Rutter or Trebek,
demoting those three celebrities to
supporting roles. Do we treat Watson
the same way we did Jennings in his
heyday we marvel at his success
while secretly hoping he'll prove falli
ble? For me, the answer is no. As
much as this television event centers
on the nature of "Jeopardy!," ulti
mately this is a showcase for IBM and
its human engineers. We can't root
against something man has created,
and, as a result, technology will never
fully replace human actors on televi
sion, reality or scripted. These forms
of storytelling require complementa
ry elements of good guys and bad

guys and immerse the reader in their
created worlds. If a computer or
avatar were the star of a television
show, audiences would be immersed
in the technology rather than the
story and thus would never believe an
antagonist. Watson has become a
sensation on "Jeopardy!" because he
is writing his own story, the story of
human progress. Because even an
HBO miniseries isn't long enough to
cover all of that.
