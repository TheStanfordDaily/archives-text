shooting from the field. Junior
forward Josh Owens added 12
points and five rebounds while

Brown contributed 15 points
and four rebounds.

NOTES: After a tough 69-65 loss at home
to UCLA, the Cardinal will have to re

against USC tomorrow night. The Tro
jans are coming of a tight road win over
Cal, 78-75. Stanford is currently tied for
seventh in the Pac-10 standings, half a
game back of USC, with just a few

Though the Cardinal finished
with 44-percent shooting, Dawkins
felt it was lackluster.
"A lot of times our lulls on of
fense carry over to the defense," he
said. "Our kids are thinking about
what just happened on the other
end. We got to work on that going
forward."

Jeremy Green went on a tear
near the end, getting the Cardinal
back in the game, scoring 16 points
in the final five minutes.
With about six minutes left in the
game, the Bruins led, 57-42, and
seemed prepped to coast to victory.
However, the Cardinal went on a
big final run, scoring on eight
straight possessions late to cut the
lead to 66-62 with one minute re
maining. After a missed UCLA free
throw, it appeared the Cardinal
might be able to cut it to one.
But on the ensuing possession,
Jeremy Green drove to the basket
and had the ball stolen. After yet an
other missed Bruin free throw, the
Card had another chance wasted as
Green's three-pointer rimmed out.
Both teams jostled for the rebound,
but the Bruins came up with the ball
on the ground and put the game out
of reach with two more free throws
in the last 10 seconds.

Nelson's free-throw shooting
was especially important in the final
stretch. While the Cardinal desper
ately tried to get back in the game

late, he sank free-throw after free
throw, making seven of eight in the
final minutes.

When asked about the last pos
session, Green took responsibility
for Stanford's missed chance.

"I got a decent look at the three,"
he said. "It's on me to make that
shot. And on the previous one, I
turned the ball over. It's on me."

Turnovers were a big key in the
game, as both teams coughed the
ball up frequently. Hie Bruins fin
ished with 17 turnovers while the
Cardinal had 12.

Up next for Stanford is USC,
which bested the Cardinal, 65-42,
last month in Los Angeles. The Tro
jans are a game ahead of Stanford at
fourth place in the Pac-10 with a 7-7
conference record and are coming
off a tight victory on Thursday night
over Cal.

Stanford and USC tip off on Sat
urday at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.

NOTES: After a tough 69-65 loss at home

seventh in the Pac-10 standings, half a

Stanford trailed by 16 against the visiting UCLA Bruins before a late rally led by junior guard Jeremy
Green's 21 second-half points. Fellow junior guard Jarrett Mann (22) had a game-high six assists.
minutes."
Though the Cardinal finished
with 44-percent shooting, Dawkins
felt it was lackluster.
"A lot of times our lulls on of
fense carry over to the defense," he
said. "Our kids are thinking about
what just happened on the other
end. We got to work on that going
forward."

Jeremy Green went on a tear
near the end, getting the Cardinal
back in the game, scoring 16 points
in the final five minutes.
With about six minutes left in the
game, the Bruins led, 57-42, and
seemed prepped to coast to victory.
However, the Cardinal went on a
big final run, scoring on eight
straight possessions late to cut the
lead to 66-62 with one minute re
maining. After a missed UCLA free
throw, it appeared the Cardinal
might be able to cut it to one.
But on the ensuing possession,
Jeremy Green drove to the basket
and had the ball stolen. After yet an
other missed Bruin free throw, the
Card had another chance wasted as
Green's three-pointer rimmed out.
Both teams jostled for the rebound,
but the Bruins came up with the ball
on the ground and put the game out
of reach with two more free throws
in the last 10 seconds.

Nelson's free-throw shooting
was especially important in the final
stretch. While the Cardinal desper
ately tried to get back in the game

late, he sank free-throw after free
throw, making seven of eight in the
final minutes.

When asked about the last pos
session, Green took responsibility
for Stanford's missed chance.

"I got a decent look at the three,"
he said. "It's on me to make that
shot. And on the previous one, I
turned the ball over. It's on me."

Turnovers were a big key in the
game, as both teams coughed the
ball up frequently. Hie Bruins fin
ished with 17 turnovers while the
Cardinal had 12.

Up next for Stanford is USC,
which bested the Cardinal, 65-42,
last month in Los Angeles. The Tro
jans are a game ahead of Stanford at
fourth place in the Pac-10 with a 7-7
conference record and are coming
off a tight victory on Thursday night
over Cal.

Stanford and USC tip off on Sat
urday at 7:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
