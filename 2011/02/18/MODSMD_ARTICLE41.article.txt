## ROXY SASS It's a small world after all 
### — roxy SASS 
Roxy's no fool: she knows that,
for almost all things, bigger is
better. Everything's exciting
when there's more of it more
intrigue, more shirtless boys on sunny
days, more cushion for the pushin',
more money and even more prob
lems (who doesn't love a little
drama?).

But one thing that Stanford has
yet to embrace more of is the number
of undergraduate students per class
a figure that has hovered around
1700 for years. And when there's a

bone to be picked about an issue like
that, you know who to call: Roxy Sass.
Roxy remembers being a fresh
man: The campus was her oyster, and
its aphrodisiac qualities were kicking
in. So many new faces, so many peo
ple to meet, so many boys who had
recently gone through pre-college or
Turkey Drop breakups and were
looking for some platonic and slight
ly-less-platonic comfort. Roxy's social
circle was mostly her freshman dorm
mates, and while the inevitable dorm
cest was awkward, she only had to

look outside the confines of Wilbur to
meet some fresh faces that were bliss
fully uninvolved in the web and were
more than willing to be blissfully
involved with her.

A few years down the line, how
ever, the story's different: Roxy knows
that through casual socialization,
introductory classes and the stalkery
wonder of Facebook, the faces in your
class start to look very familiar, and
after a few rounds of hookups and
breakups, stuff gets a little more com

plicated.
Roxy has found a few occasions
where this is to her advantage: an ami
cable ex is, after all, only a few row
houses away and usually down for a
brief rekindling. But when she meets
someone new, the unfortunate truth is
that it's rarely someone new. He's dated
that girl she knows; she used to hook
up with his freshman year roommate.
Friends hit on friends' exes, bad

breakups break up groups of friends as
well and hey—Roxy's even had the
pleasure of finding a couple of
hookup-history buddies: that is, girls
whose paths through Stanford bedfel
lows have an awful lot of overlap with
her own. And that, friends, is a special
type of bond that can only occur after
years in a limited dating pool.
But lest this be too dismal, Roxy's
got some advice: if you'd rather avoid
the tangled web that is a class by its
junior or senior year, date grad stu
dents until you're old enough to date
freshmen. Roxy knows plenty of TAs
who she'd like to have grade her work
week after week. And while her

cougar-ing days are far ahead of her,
Roxy's also not above getting a little
practice on the hunt with the Class of
2014. Watch out, ffeshmeat: there's a
new sheriff in town.
