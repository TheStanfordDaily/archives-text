# Trojans roll, card rolls over
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford laid a collective egg in its highly an
ticipated Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
showdown at No. 1 USC, getting blown out in the
first two sets before coming up a bit short in the
third and final game, ultimately falling in a 3-0
sweep.
The No. 4 Cardinal (9-4,6-4 MPSF) has had a
rough time recently in the MPSF, going 2-2 in
their last four conference matches, and it got no
easier against the conference-leading Trojans (7-
1,7-1).

Senior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin had a
good game with a team-high 11 kills, nine digs and
a .364 hitting percentage, while outside hitter
Garrett Dobbs, a redshirt junior, provided a nice
boost off the bench with six kills on nine attempts.
But besides junior outside hitter Brad Lawson's
10 kills, the Cardinal couldn't find any offense,
Stanford had 15 attack errors to USC's eight,
and the Trojans' .407 hitting percentage was al
most double the Cardinal's .213.
USC had five players with at least five kills, led
by outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who had a match
high 12 kills on just 18 attempts with no errors for
a .667 hitting percentage. Two-time AVCA Ail-
American Murphy Troy had an off night with just
seven kills on 20 attack attempts, but it was plen
ty to get past the Cardinal defense that struggled
to sideout all night.
