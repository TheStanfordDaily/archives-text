### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Stanford laid a collective egg in its highly an
ticipated Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
showdown at No. 1 USC, getting blown out in the
first two sets before coming up a bit short in the
third and final game, ultimately falling in a 3-0
sweep.
The No. 4 Cardinal (9-4,6-4 MPSF) has had a
rough time recently in the MPSF, going 2-2 in
their last four conference matches, and it got no
easier against the conference-leading Trojans (7-
1,7-1).

Senior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin had a
good game with a team-high 11 kills, nine digs and
a .364 hitting percentage, while outside hitter
Garrett Dobbs, a redshirt junior, provided a nice
boost off the bench with six kills on nine attempts.
But besides junior outside hitter Brad Lawson's
10 kills, the Cardinal couldn't find any offense,
Stanford had 15 attack errors to USC's eight,
and the Trojans' .407 hitting percentage was al
most double the Cardinal's .213.
USC had five players with at least five kills, led
by outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, who had a match
high 12 kills on just 18 attempts with no errors for
a .667 hitting percentage. Two-time AVCA Ail-
American Murphy Troy had an off night with just
seven kills on 20 attack attempts, but it was plen
ty to get past the Cardinal defense that struggled
to sideout all night.

The men's volleyball team fell flat in its showdown with No. 1 USC, despite the best efforts of
junior Erik Shoji (above). The two-time Ail-American libero had 10 digs in a 3-0 road loss.
Junior libero Erik Shoji had 10
digs, and junior setter Evan Barry
had 30 assists, but Stanford was out
blocked 17-2 and was in trouble
from the middle of the first set.

After trading points early on, the
Cardinal took an 8-7 lead, but it
would be the last Stanford lead
until midway through the final set.
USC went on several runs as it ran
away to a 25-15 margin in set one.
The second game wasn't close
after the first few points, as the Tro
jans hit .632 in the set with four kills

from Tri Bourne.
Stanford finally got its act to
gether in the third game, and after
trading points early on, clung to a
17-14 lead after an attack error
from Austin Zahn. But the lead was
short-lived. USC went on a six
point run to put the game, and the
match, out of reach.
Coach John Kosty couldn't find
an answer to Stanford's problems,
and the Cardinal freshmen, who
had recently been providing a big
boost to the lineup, fell flat on
Thursday. Starting outside hitter
Brian Cook did not register a kill
and had three attack errors for a -

.249 hitting percentage. Fellow
freshman outside hitter Eric
Mochalski had just one kill, and

even a solid contribution from
freshman middle blocker Denny
Falls (three kills, one block) were
lost in the carnage of Stanford's
third road loss in four conference
matches away from home.
The Cardinal will need to re
group quickly to get ready for its
matchup against Pepperdine, which
will face No. 15 Pacific tonight be
fore hosting Stanford on Saturday
night.
The No. 9 Waves are just 2-5 in
MPSF play, but recently defeated
USC, 3-2, last weekend. The match
is set for 7 p.m. from Firestone
Fieldhouse.
