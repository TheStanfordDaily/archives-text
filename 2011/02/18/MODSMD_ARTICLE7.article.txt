## UNIVERSITY PG&E pipelines still under question Company reports lines' marked improvments 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford officials have been in
contact with PG&E representatives
since the utility company named
four sections of pipeline running
along Junipero Serra on its list of
top 100 sections for maintenance
last September.
The PG&E compilation was pub
lished in an effort to increase trans
parency following the San Bruno
pipeline explosion. It said the Ju
nipero Serra pipes face risk of po
tential corrosion.

According to Stanford officials,
PG&E has since assured Stanford
that the pipes are not dangerous,
but has not yet released detailed in
formation on the pipes' background
and maintenance history. The Uni
versity currently faces a waiting
game with PG&E until Mar. 15, the
date by which the company said it
would send information from an
ongoing report. PG&E will present
that report to the Public Utilities
Commission on the same day.
The pipes in question run by Sand
Hill Road, on either side of Ju
nipero Serra past faculty backyards,
near the golf course and down Page
Mill Road. PG&E has had full con
trol over their care since the 19305,
when the pipes' first sections were
installed.

While it came as a surprise to
Stanford officials to see these pipes
on the maintenance list, they have
"no information the pipes are dan
gerous," said Assistant Vice Presi
dent of University Communica
tions Lisa Lapin.
"[PG&E] has generally been re
sponsive when they have the infor
mation," Lapin added. "Sometimes
they themselves are trying to an
swer the same questions."
Immediately after the report was
released, Stanford met with PG&E
representatives to find out as much
information as possible.
According to PG&E spokesper
son Joe Molica, the pipes were put
on the list for "potential of corro
sion." He said PG&E has since fixed
the issue by adjusting the cathodic
monitor system an external elec
tric monitor for corrosion on the
pipes.
The Top 100 Maintenance List
"looks for long range evaluation
and planning purposes," Molica
said.
But it does not signify immediate
danger.
"We thought the corrosion may
be a bit higher [on the Junipero
Serra pipes] than at other places,"
he said. "We adjusted the cathodic
monitor and recent analysis has
shown marked improvement. There
is no further action needed for ex
ternal corrosion."
Molica also emphasized that
pipeline monitoring at PG&E is a
24-hour, seven day per week
process.
Stanford's questions to PG&E

focused on the types of pipes along
Junipero Serra, when they were last
inspected and their condition,
Lapin said. The Mar. 15 report will
reveal the maintenance records and
history of the pipes, among other in
formation.

Lawrence Gibbs, assistant vice
provost of environmental health
and safety, has been monitoring the
issue closely since the report first
came out. He has also kept nearby
homeowners informed about any
updates and has forwarded any
homeowners' questions on to
PG&E.

"It remains a concern because
we're still looking for more data,"
he said. "If this was something we

felt was a more imminent need, we
would have pressed [PG&E] even
more."
Palo Alto, San Mateo and other
surrounding areas are also in the
process of questioning PG&E
about pipes potentially requiring
maintenance in their areas. Any le
niency PG&E had been awarded in
the past by the state utilities com
mission an accusation recently
put forth by California state repre
sentatives is long gone.
"One of the things to come out of
this will hopefully be much more in
formation about transmission pipe
safety, not only here but in the
whole country," Gibbs said.
Any plan of action Stanford takes

is contingent on the information
contained in the forthcoming re
port. However, since PG&E docu
ments revealed after the San Bruno
explosion illustrated instances of
faulty record keeping, falsified re
ports and delayed inspections, there
is concern that some questions will
remain unanswered come March.

"The hope and expectation is that
they have all the records there, and
if they don't we'll have to find out
how they will ascertain that infor
mation," Gibbs said.
"We're following the investiga
tion very closely," Lapin added.
