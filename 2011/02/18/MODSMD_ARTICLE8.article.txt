## FacSen discusses libraries, health care 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate convened Thurs
day afternoon to discuss three topics: the
possibility of a New York City campus
dedicated to engineering and computer
science; the impact of the Health Care
Reform Bill on faculty and staff mem
bers and the future of the University's li
braries.

Vice President for Business Affairs
Randy Livingston and Professor of
Medicine Arnold Milstein presented a
report the legislative impact of the
health care bill, placing the emphasis on
the rising costs of health care,
Livingston said the University cur
rently offers five health plans to employ
ees and their dependents: Kaiser, Pacifi-
Care, Health Net, PPO and HDHP
PPO.

"The costs have been rising quite
dramatically," Livingston said, referring
to the fact that the compounded annual
growth rate (CAGR) is between 12 per
cent andls percent.
"What health care reform, at least for
us, does is introduce a number of ele
ments that will actually, in short run, add
a burden of additional costs," Livingston
said.

One such burden stems from an in
crease in the number of people covered.
Stanford will see approximately 400 de
pendents added to its health care roll
this year since the Health Care Reform
Bill allows children to be covered under
their parents' plan up to age 26.
In addition, some of the bill's costs
are directly borne by individual faculty
and staff members. For instance, faculty
and staff are no longer entitled to get re
imbursement for over-the-counter med
ication, and health spending accounts
are capped at $2,500. The health bill fur
ther includes a special excise tax on cer
tain health benefit plans, effective 2018.
According to Livingston, the Univer
sity will concentrate on the dual objec
tives of improving the health of employ
ees and dependents and slowing the
growth of healthcare costs.
