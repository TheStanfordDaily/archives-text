## FacSen discusses libraries, health care 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate convened Thurs
day afternoon to discuss three topics: the
possibility of a New York City campus
dedicated to engineering and computer
science; the impact of the Health Care
Reform Bill on faculty and staff mem
bers and the future of the University's li
braries.

Vice President for Business Affairs
Randy Livingston and Professor of
Medicine Arnold Milstein presented a
report the legislative impact of the
health care bill, placing the emphasis on
the rising costs of health care,
Livingston said the University cur
rently offers five health plans to employ
ees and their dependents: Kaiser, Pacifi-
Care, Health Net, PPO and HDHP
PPO.

"The costs have been rising quite
dramatically," Livingston said, referring
to the fact that the compounded annual
growth rate (CAGR) is between 12 per
cent andls percent.
"What health care reform, at least for
us, does is introduce a number of ele
ments that will actually, in short run, add
a burden of additional costs," Livingston
said.

One such burden stems from an in
crease in the number of people covered.
Stanford will see approximately 400 de
pendents added to its health care roll
this year since the Health Care Reform
Bill allows children to be covered under
their parents' plan up to age 26.
In addition, some of the bill's costs
are directly borne by individual faculty
and staff members. For instance, faculty
and staff are no longer entitled to get re
imbursement for over-the-counter med
ication, and health spending accounts
are capped at $2,500. The health bill fur
ther includes a special excise tax on cer
tain health benefit plans, effective 2018.
According to Livingston, the Univer
sity will concentrate on the dual objec
tives of improving the health of employ
ees and dependents and slowing the
growth of healthcare costs.
Milstein said two initiatives, the
Be Well Program and preventative
care, are in place to address the first
goal. He also expanded on the idea of
a Stanford-based Care Management
Program. One central component of
this program is an A-ICU that pro
vides intensified care for thelO per
cent of the insured who are most
fragile.

Milstein also sees a role for Stan
ford Hospital & Clinics (SHC) and
the Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital (LPCH) within this framework.
In combination, these efforts could
effectively reduce long-term health
care costs and improve the health of
Stanford faculty and staff.
With regard to cost control, Liv
ingston cited several considerations
and potential solutions.
"We've really come to the conclu
sion that Health Net and PacifiCare
are no longer effectively doing man
aged care," he said, noting that the
University may drop these two plans
in favor of a new self-insured plan.
"We've really come to the conclu
sion that Health Net and PacifiCare

are no longer effectively doing man
aged care," Livingston said.
Adding to the problem is the fact
that Kaiser doesn't really have com
petition and "manages under the
umbrella of the costs" of the other
plans, he said.
Following the health care discus
sion, University Librarian Michael
Keller and John Bender, professor of
English and comparative literature,
reported on the future of Stanford's
libraries.

According to Bender, the Univer
sity discovered in the fall of 2007 that
Meyer Library had to be demolished
"for reasons of earthquake safety."
Meyer currently houses academic
computing, a large number of library
staff and, most importantly, the East
Asia Library (EAL).
This revelation of Meyer's seis
mic unsoundness led to the creation
of the Marrinan Subcommittee,
which was tasked with investigating
the future of the East Asia Library. A
second subcommittee, known as the
Sommer subcommittee, convened
early in 2009 to look into the propos
als put forth by its predecessor.
According to Bender, the Som
mer subcommittee recommended
that Stanford maintain a substan
tial collection of physical books on
the Farm, build a new library to

house EAL and invest in the digi
talization of its resources, among
other things.
But two developments coinciding
with the Sommer investigation have
expanded the University's options
with respect to its libraries. The first
was the construction of Stanford
Auxiliary Library 3 (SAL3).The sec
ond was the announcement that the
Graduate School of Business would
vacate GSB South.

GSB South has since been put
forth as a potential new home for
EAL. Provost John Etchemendy
said a cost-benefit study is currently
underway.

"We haven't made a decision
about whether the contents of
Meyer will in fact go into GSB
South," Etchemendy said. "Yes, we
spent $1 million [to study the op
tions] ... to make sure we don't
make a mistake."

Tentatively speaking, the cost of
transferring the contents of Meyer to
GSB South may "be on the order of
$5O million," he said.The timeline for
the decision of the future of the li
brary is six months into the future.
The construction of another building
to house EAL remains a possibility.
