"Seeking to understand 'why they hate us', the US military adopts a new strategy of
cultural awareness to win over the hearts and minds of the Iraqi and Afghan people.
Controversy erupts when academics embed with combat troops and the war comes home
to the university" (www.humantenainthemovie.com). The film traces the decisions
made by humanitarian and social science student and scholar Michael Bhatia, who was
recruited to the Human Terrain program by the US military and became the first US
civilian killed in Afghanistan. It raises important but difficult questions about the role of
social scientists in the contemporary era and will be of interest to students from a wide
range of disciplinary backgrounds.
RSVP and questions: jess.auerbach@stanford.edu
Drinks and light snacks will be provided.
Hosted by the Department of Anthropology.
