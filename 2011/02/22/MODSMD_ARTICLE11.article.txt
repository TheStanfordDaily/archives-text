## An Argument Against ROTC's Return, from an Actual Transgender Person's Perspective 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So currently Stanford has been
arguing about the return of
ROTC (Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps), the student branch of
the U.S. military. ROTC was at Stan
ford until the 19705, before it was re
moved from campus. The repeal of
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell," which
would allow gay and lesbian people
to serve in the military, has revived
the debate on ROTC. Many stu
dents argue that since the military
doesn't discriminate against gay
and lesbian people anymore,
ROTC should come back. Also,
both The Stanford Daily and The
Stanford Review have printed opin
ion pieces on the ROTC's return.
The Stanford Review's Jan. 31,
2011, editorial, "No Excuses Left
for ROTC's Ban," stated that trans
gender people will benefit from the
military's return to Stanford, be
cause if we let more open-minded
people in the military, eventually

transgender people will be allowed
to join.
It was while reading that editori
al I realized that there was no trans
gender voice within this editorial, or
within any of the opinion pieces
presented in any Stanford publica
tion so far. And if transgender issues
are going to be at the center of an
issue like the military, then some
transgender person is going to have
to get a word in thus, this week's
column.
So there has been the argument
that transgender people are not
able-bodied due to the fact that

their physical bodies don't match
up with their minds. Transgender
people have Gender Identity Disor
der, people claim. Gender Identity
Disorder is a mental illness, which
makes trans people unsuitable to
serve in the military.

But this is not a matter of mental
illness. I don't disagree that many
transgender people go through a
period of mental and emotional dis
tress. For some people, it lasts for
years. However, it doesn't last for
ever. Our emotional pain doesn't
ruin us or make us unable to live our
full potential. In fact, it makes us
stronger. It makes us never take
anything for granted. It makes us
work harder on our bodies and our
minds. It makes us more deter
mined. It makes us leaders. Now
who wouldn't want someone with
this drive to work for them? The
