# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## An Argument Against ROTC's Return, from an Actual Transgender Person's Perspective 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So currently Stanford has been
arguing about the return of
ROTC (Reserve Officer Train
ing Corps), the student branch of
the U.S. military. ROTC was at Stan
ford until the 19705, before it was re
moved from campus. The repeal of
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell," which
would allow gay and lesbian people
to serve in the military, has revived
the debate on ROTC. Many stu
dents argue that since the military
doesn't discriminate against gay
and lesbian people anymore,
ROTC should come back. Also,
both The Stanford Daily and The
Stanford Review have printed opin
ion pieces on the ROTC's return.
The Stanford Review's Jan. 31,
2011, editorial, "No Excuses Left
for ROTC's Ban," stated that trans
gender people will benefit from the
military's return to Stanford, be
cause if we let more open-minded
people in the military, eventually

transgender people will be allowed
to join.
It was while reading that editori
al I realized that there was no trans
gender voice within this editorial, or
within any of the opinion pieces
presented in any Stanford publica
tion so far. And if transgender issues
are going to be at the center of an
issue like the military, then some
transgender person is going to have
to get a word in thus, this week's
column.
So there has been the argument
that transgender people are not
able-bodied due to the fact that

their physical bodies don't match
up with their minds. Transgender
people have Gender Identity Disor
der, people claim. Gender Identity
Disorder is a mental illness, which
makes trans people unsuitable to
serve in the military.

But this is not a matter of mental
illness. I don't disagree that many
transgender people go through a
period of mental and emotional dis
tress. For some people, it lasts for
years. However, it doesn't last for
ever. Our emotional pain doesn't
ruin us or make us unable to live our
full potential. In fact, it makes us
stronger. It makes us never take
anything for granted. It makes us
work harder on our bodies and our
minds. It makes us more deter
mined. It makes us leaders. Now
who wouldn't want someone with
this drive to work for them? The

military is missing out on a small
but potent subset of the population.
We deserve to be empowered
and create change for ourselves.
The only way that the military can
be improved for us transgender
people is if we are allowed to par
ticipate ourselves and make choic
es for ourselves. The National Cen
ter for Transgender Equality, the
premiere national transgender ad
vocacy organization, has released
a statement in solidarity with ef
forts to prevent the return of
ROTC to Stanford on the basis of
continued discrimination against
transgender people. How do publi
cations like The Review feel as if
they are more competent to decide
what is "best" for transgender peo
ple than transgender students and
transgender activists who have
been working on transgender jus
tice for decades?
Also, the ROTC members of
Stanford will have to take their
ROTC activities and training for
academic units. ROTC will basical
ly become equivalent to class for
them. This is a blatant violation of
the non-discrimination policy,
which includes gender identity. If
Stanford were to allow ROTC to
return to campus, Stanford would
be violating its own policy and tak
ing a step back in its support for

transgender people.
Have the Review state its argu
ment to the transgendered young
people who want to join the mili
tary. Its editorial told them that
they cannot change the military
themselves, that their voices do not
matter, that if they want change,
they need to shut up and let other
people do it for them. Non-trans
gender people matter and have
more power. But just because I take
up a small minority of both the
queer community and the general
population does not mean I am no
one. I am a human being. We have
been marginalized for so long, in
both the general and the queer
community, and I am sick of it. Why
should my existence somehow be
less legitimate than somebody else
simply because of a matter of statis
tics?
Placing transgender people into
one group and telling us what's for
our own good tells us that we are
not capable of making change our
selves. This is a blatant insult to our
humanity. I refuse to be told to sit
quietly and let people who do not
know me tell me what I should and
should not do. I reserve the right to
speak my opinion as a human
being. Only I know what is truly
good for me, and only transgender
people know what is good for them
selves. Thus, I say NO to the return
of ROTC to Stanford.
