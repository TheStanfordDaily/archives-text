## I Support Planned Parenthood 
### NATALIE GOODIS '11 
On Jan. 24, The Unofficial
Stanford Blog posted a pic
ture of me handing out free
condoms in White Plaza to cele
brate the anniversary of Roe v.
Wade. Excited to share the news, I
sent out the link to family and
friends. Within a half an hour, I re
ceived a reply from my mom: ''Oh
well, I guess my daughter won't be
president."
Like the photo of President
Obama smoking marijuana in col
lege, the photo of me in a t-shirt that

says, "I am Pro-Choice" could lose
me a nice chunk of the country's
vote. Women's reproductive rights
have been the subject of ongoing
debate since forever. But today, this
issue deserves our attention be
cause the efficacy of one of the most
important healthcare providers to
women across America is at stake.
Four bills most prominently,
the Title X Abortion Provider Pro
hibition Act introduced by Repre
sentative Mike Pence (R-IN) re
cently passed by the Flouse of Rep

resentatives, dared to cut funds
from health care providers that also
provide abortion care with private
funds. Never mind that federal
funding does not directly fund abor
tions. Apparently, it's even too dan
gerous to let organizations like
Planned Parenthood, that provide a
myriad of other crucial health care
services to women, receive any fed
eral support at all.
In 2009, three million women
visited one of Planned Parent
hood's 800 healthcare centers.
Those women received not only
family planning counseling and
contraception, but also breast and
pelvic exams, lifesaving cervical
cancer screenings, STI exams and
postpartum care. For six out of
every 10 of those women, centers
like Planned Parenthood were
their only source of healthcare of
any kind, not just a convenient
place to grab a free condom. That's
because 85 percent of them live
right at the poverty line, and two
thirds lack health insurance.
On that sunny morning in White
Plaza, I would often stuff two or
three condoms into the hands of a
passerby, but I knew that at Stan
ford, condoms aren't hard to find.
We are so lucky to have services
like the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, the Women's Com
munity Center and Vaden Health
Center that provide many of the
same services as Planned Parent
hood to students on campus. But
not everyone goes to Stanford.
Stanford students often think
that because the campus is over
whelmingly liberal, participating in
activism on behalf of reproductive
health issues is unnecessary. This is
not the case. It's time for students at
our university to get over our ob

session with the Stanford bubble
and pick up the phone. As the vote
goes into the Senate, we must let
our elected representatives know
how we feel about this issue. Pick
up the phone and call your senator.
Pick up the phone and call your
parents and tell them to call their
senators. Leave a message. It takes
30 seconds.
President Obama was elected
even though he smoked pot. I'm
okay giving up my dream of becom
ing president if it means that mil
lions of women around the world
are guaranteed the life-saving
health services that they deserve.

We are so lucky to
have places that
provide many of the
same services as
Planned Parenthood
