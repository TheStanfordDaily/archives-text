## INDOOR CHAMPS Card takes tourney to remain unbeaten 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The last time these two teams
met, Stanford won the 2010
NCAA title. This time, the No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team
(9-0) again defeated No. 2 Flori
da, 4-2, to win the prestigious
midseason ITA National Team
Indoor Championships.
"This team, we have a bull's
eye on our back," said head coach
Lele Forood. "We've now played
through a lot of tough competi
tion and won. I think we're han
dling the ranking and the expec
tations pretty darn well."

The Cardinal went into the
weekend playing very well. The
team blanked No. 28 SMU for its
third shutout in five matches and
had a convincing 5-2 victory over
No. 4 UCLA to prepare the team
for the stacked lineup at Indoors.
The teams competing in this tour
nament included nine of the top
10 teams and 16 of the top 20.
"It was a grind," said sopho
more Stacey Tan. "Four matches
one after another against the best
teams in the country, getting used
to East Coast time ... I felt like
competing against different
schools was kind of like NCAAs

again. It was cool to get into that
mindset."
The team's first opponent was
Arkansas, but Stanford, with its
five ranked players, overpowered
the Razorbacks quickly for a 4-0
win. In the next round, Stanford
faced No. 8 Michigan. A surprise
upset at No. 1 doubles came when
the 22nd-ranked team of Brooke
Bolender and Denise Muresan
upset Stanford's third-ranked
squad of Barte and Burdette, 8-3.
The Card proceeded to drop the
doubles point, but fired off four
quick singles victories to win the
day. Barte got her revenge over
No. 8 Muresan, 6-2,6-4.

"Their doubles was really solid
on courts one, two and three," said
freshman Kristie Ahn. "I think we
got outplayed on one and three,
which doesn't happen very often,
but they were really prepared. In
this tournament, every time [we
lost doubles,] we weren't freaking
out. We knew they still had a long
way to go."
Now playing in the semifinals,
Stanford was up against a very tal
ented No. 4 North Carolina team
that included the No. 6 doubles
team of Shinann Featherston and
Lauren McHale and the No. 13 sin
gles player in Zoe De Bruycker.
Regardless, the Cardinal blanked
the Tar Heels, 4-0. No. 3 Barte/Bur
dette defeated No. 6 Feather
ston/McHale, 9-7, to clinch the
