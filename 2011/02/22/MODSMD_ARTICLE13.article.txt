## INDOOR CHAMPS Card takes tourney to remain unbeaten 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The last time these two teams
met, Stanford won the 2010
NCAA title. This time, the No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team
(9-0) again defeated No. 2 Flori
da, 4-2, to win the prestigious
midseason ITA National Team
Indoor Championships.
"This team, we have a bull's
eye on our back," said head coach
Lele Forood. "We've now played
through a lot of tough competi
tion and won. I think we're han
dling the ranking and the expec
tations pretty darn well."

The Cardinal went into the
weekend playing very well. The
team blanked No. 28 SMU for its
third shutout in five matches and
had a convincing 5-2 victory over
No. 4 UCLA to prepare the team
for the stacked lineup at Indoors.
The teams competing in this tour
nament included nine of the top
10 teams and 16 of the top 20.
"It was a grind," said sopho
more Stacey Tan. "Four matches
one after another against the best
teams in the country, getting used
to East Coast time ... I felt like
competing against different
schools was kind of like NCAAs

again. It was cool to get into that
mindset."
The team's first opponent was
Arkansas, but Stanford, with its
five ranked players, overpowered
the Razorbacks quickly for a 4-0
win. In the next round, Stanford
faced No. 8 Michigan. A surprise
upset at No. 1 doubles came when
the 22nd-ranked team of Brooke
Bolender and Denise Muresan
upset Stanford's third-ranked
squad of Barte and Burdette, 8-3.
The Card proceeded to drop the
doubles point, but fired off four
quick singles victories to win the
day. Barte got her revenge over
No. 8 Muresan, 6-2,6-4.

"Their doubles was really solid
on courts one, two and three," said
freshman Kristie Ahn. "I think we
got outplayed on one and three,
which doesn't happen very often,
but they were really prepared. In
this tournament, every time [we
lost doubles,] we weren't freaking
out. We knew they still had a long
way to go."
Now playing in the semifinals,
Stanford was up against a very tal
ented No. 4 North Carolina team
that included the No. 6 doubles
team of Shinann Featherston and
Lauren McHale and the No. 13 sin
gles player in Zoe De Bruycker.
Regardless, the Cardinal blanked
the Tar Heels, 4-0. No. 3 Barte/Bur
dette defeated No. 6 Feather
ston/McHale, 9-7, to clinch the

doubles point, and Stanford had
wins on courts one, two and four in
singles.
In the final, Stanford faced No.
2 Florida, who came into the
match at 10-0 for the season. The
Gators' singles lineup includes
five ranked players: No. 7 Allie
Will, No. 19 Joanna Mather, No. 31
Olivia Janowicz, No. 36 Lauren
Embree and No. 40 Alex Cercone.
The two programs appeared des
tined to meet in the finals in a
matchup of No. 1 versus No. 2.
Despite struggles at the second
spot, the Cardinal managed to win
the doubles point, a reversal of
what happened last year in the
NCAA finals when the Gators
took the doubles. Barte/Burdette
recorded an upset of the No. 1
team of Will and Sofie Oyen, 8-5.

On court three, McVeigh/Tan de
feated Cercone and Janowicz, 8-6.
Florida recovered from the dou
bles by quickly winning matches at
the second and sixth spots to go up,
2-1. McVeigh lost in straight sets, 6-
1,6-1, and Burdette lost to Embree,
6-4,6-4.
"She lost to a longtime nemesis
who is a very good player," Forood
said. "[Embree] played No. 1 for
them last year. [Burdette] got down
early in both sets and then came
back, but couldn't quite get there in
the end."
Stanford's phenomenal fresh
men delivered, though, coming off
the court in succession to put Stan
ford back on top 3-2. Ahn finished
with a 6-4, 6-2 win. Gibbs won a
tiebreaker and then took a 7-6 (2),
6-3 victory for the lead.
"I had never been this pumped
before," Ahn laughed. "My hand
was shaking after the first set and
after the match."
Perhaps one of the stars of the
weekend, Tan then clinched the

tournament on court five with a 7-
5,3-6,6-4 victory.
"Stacey was fabulous the last
few days," Forood said. "She had
some big wins the past few days. She
was really composed and really
won the mental battle against her
opponents. It was a great weekend
for her.
"It was a nice experience, espe
cially since we won it," Forood con
tinued. "It's the kind of thing
where you play a bunch of big
matches back to back. You have
different people get in with singles
and doubles, and it feels like a
great team effort when you finish
this tournament. We're a young
team, a talented team, clearly, but
you have to go through a few chal
lenges too."
Stanford will host Oregon and

taking on the Ducks at 1:30 p.m. on

weekend playing very well. The
team blanked No. 28 SMU for its
third shutout in five matches and
had a convincing 5-2 victory over
No. 4 UCLA to prepare the team
for the stacked lineup at Indoors.
The teams competing in this tour
nament included nine of the top
10 teams and 16 of the top 20.
"It was a grind," said sopho
more Stacey Tan. "Four matches
one after another against the best
teams in the country, getting used
to East Coast time ... I felt like
competing against different
schools was kind of like NCAAs

again. It was cool to get into that
mindset."
The team's first opponent was
Arkansas, but Stanford, with its
five ranked players, overpowered
the Razorbacks quickly for a 4-0
win. In the next round, Stanford
faced No. 8 Michigan. A surprise
upset at No. 1 doubles came when
the 22nd-ranked team of Brooke
Bolender and Denise Muresan
upset Stanford's third-ranked
squad of Barte and Burdette, 8-3.
The Card proceeded to drop the
doubles point, but fired off four
quick singles victories to win the
day. Barte got her revenge over
No. 8 Muresan, 6-2,6-4.

"Their doubles was really solid
on courts one, two and three," said
freshman Kristie Ahn. "I think we
got outplayed on one and three,
which doesn't happen very often,
but they were really prepared. In
this tournament, every time [we
lost doubles,] we weren't freaking
out. We knew they still had a long
way to go."
Now playing in the semifinals,
Stanford was up against a very tal
ented No. 4 North Carolina team
that included the No. 6 doubles
team of Shinann Featherston and
Lauren McHale and the No. 13 sin
gles player in Zoe De Bruycker.
Regardless, the Cardinal blanked
the Tar Heels, 4-0. No. 3 Barte/Bur
dette defeated No. 6 Feather
ston/McHale, 9-7, to clinch the

doubles point, and Stanford had
wins on courts one, two and four in
singles.
In the final, Stanford faced No.
2 Florida, who came into the
match at 10-0 for the season. The
Gators' singles lineup includes
five ranked players: No. 7 Allie
Will, No. 19 Joanna Mather, No. 31
Olivia Janowicz, No. 36 Lauren
Embree and No. 40 Alex Cercone.
The two programs appeared des
tined to meet in the finals in a
matchup of No. 1 versus No. 2.
Despite struggles at the second
spot, the Cardinal managed to win
the doubles point, a reversal of
what happened last year in the
NCAA finals when the Gators
took the doubles. Barte/Burdette
recorded an upset of the No. 1
team of Will and Sofie Oyen, 8-5.

On court three, McVeigh/Tan de
feated Cercone and Janowicz, 8-6.
Florida recovered from the dou
bles by quickly winning matches at
the second and sixth spots to go up,
2-1. McVeigh lost in straight sets, 6-
1,6-1, and Burdette lost to Embree,
6-4,6-4.
"She lost to a longtime nemesis
who is a very good player," Forood
said. "[Embree] played No. 1 for
them last year. [Burdette] got down
early in both sets and then came
back, but couldn't quite get there in
the end."
Stanford's phenomenal fresh
men delivered, though, coming off
the court in succession to put Stan
ford back on top 3-2. Ahn finished
with a 6-4, 6-2 win. Gibbs won a
tiebreaker and then took a 7-6 (2),
6-3 victory for the lead.
"I had never been this pumped
before," Ahn laughed. "My hand
was shaking after the first set and
after the match."
Perhaps one of the stars of the
weekend, Tan then clinched the

tournament on court five with a 7-
5,3-6,6-4 victory.
"Stacey was fabulous the last
few days," Forood said. "She had
some big wins the past few days. She
was really composed and really
won the mental battle against her
opponents. It was a great weekend
for her.
"It was a nice experience, espe
cially since we won it," Forood con
tinued. "It's the kind of thing
where you play a bunch of big
matches back to back. You have
different people get in with singles
and doubles, and it feels like a
great team effort when you finish
this tournament. We're a young
team, a talented team, clearly, but
you have to go through a few chal
lenges too."
Stanford will host Oregon and
Washington State this weekend,
taking on the Ducks at 1:30 p.m. on
Friday at Taube Tennis Stadium.

The last time these two teams
met, Stanford won the 2010
NCAA title. This time, the No. 1
Stanford women's tennis team
(9-0) again defeated No. 2 Flori
da, 4-2, to win the prestigious
midseason ITA National Team
Indoor Championships.
"This team, we have a bull's
eye on our back," said head coach
Lele Forood. "We've now played
through a lot of tough competi
tion and won. I think we're han
dling the ranking and the expec
tations pretty darn well."
