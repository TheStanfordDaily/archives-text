# Where did Maples mojo go?

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
It's too bad I don't know the first
thing about NASCAR, because
someone younger than me won
the Daytona 500 yesterday.
That's a pretty darn good story
that I am ill-equipped to write, so in
stead I, and you, am stuck with my
usual rants.
In case you hadn't heard and
you probably hadn't the Stanford's
men's basketball team hosted the Los
Angeles schools this past weekend.
Attendance at both games was under
5,900. Maples Pavilion, the beautiful
little arena that the Cardinal calls
home, seats almost 7,400 people at ca
pacity. That's 1,500 empty seats. That is
unbelievable.
Statistics like the ones I just pre
sented used to be unthinkable. In
fact, when I was a freshman in 2006-
07,1 had to camp out the night before
the UCLA game in order to get a de
cent spot in the student section. Fans
were packed three deep in each row
of the all-standing student section.
When Stanford hosted UCLA
Thursday, you probably could have
showed up at halftime and stood in
the front row at center court. What
happened?
It's not as if that 'O6-'O7 team was
all that much better than this year's
team. In 'O6-'O7, the Cardinal men's
basketball team was likely the last
team in the NCAA Tournament and
got absolutely annihilated by
Louisville in the first round. Plus,
back then, Sixth Man membership
actually cost money (I think it was
about $7O for the season). Before one
game either that season or the next, I
asked Steve Lavin, who is now the
head coach at St. John's but at the time
was an ABC announcer, what some of
the best atmospheres for college bas
ketball were in the country. Without
hesitation he said Stanford was right
near the top. Not anymore.
Today, the student section is free
and still empty. Maybe if the Athletics
Department still charged for those

seats people would feel they needed to
get their money's worth and actually
show up but probably not.
So what changed?
To be honest, I'm not entirely cer
tain. Sure, Stanford was consistently
one of the nation's top teams in the
early 2000s and now hasn't been par
ticularly good since 2007-08. But an
electric home atmosphere also helps
a team improve. It makes recruits
want to come to campus and gives the
team a discernable home-court ad
vantage.
Maybe students and fans have de
cided to support other Stanford
teams instead of the men's basketball
team. After all, the men's basketball
team is actually one of the school's
worst-performing athletic programs
right now. I don't know if that is the
case, however, because I believe that
more students and fans are interested
in basketball than just about any
other sport.
Right now, the Cardinal has a very
solid freshman class, so perhaps at
tendance will improve along with the
team over the next few years. But
even so, it would be nice if fans would
consistently support the team even if
it were struggling (Note: I'm not say
ing the team is necessarily struggling;
in fact, I believe Stanford is definitely
improving).
Regardless, I think that interest in
men's basketball is the sort of thing
that could snowball. If small groups of
people start going to games more con
sistently and being rowdy, more fans
will come because packed basketball
games are incredibly fun for fans.
The Maples Pavilion Wikipedia
page describes the student section as
"raucous," which right now is essential
ly an indictment of Wikipedia's credi
bility. There has been nothing raucous
about Stanford home games for a few
years. How about students make home
games raucous again? It will be good
for the team and fun for all.

Daniel Bohm conveniently forgot to
mention how many games he has
been to in the past few seasons. Invite
him to stand next to you at the last
home game of the season at
