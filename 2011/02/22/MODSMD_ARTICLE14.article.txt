# Where did Maples mojo go?

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
It's too bad I don't know the first
thing about NASCAR, because
someone younger than me won
the Daytona 500 yesterday.
That's a pretty darn good story
that I am ill-equipped to write, so in
stead I, and you, am stuck with my
usual rants.
In case you hadn't heard and
you probably hadn't the Stanford's
men's basketball team hosted the Los
Angeles schools this past weekend.
Attendance at both games was under
5,900. Maples Pavilion, the beautiful
little arena that the Cardinal calls
home, seats almost 7,400 people at ca
pacity. That's 1,500 empty seats. That is
unbelievable.
Statistics like the ones I just pre
sented used to be unthinkable. In
fact, when I was a freshman in 2006-
07,1 had to camp out the night before
the UCLA game in order to get a de
cent spot in the student section. Fans
were packed three deep in each row
of the all-standing student section.
When Stanford hosted UCLA
Thursday, you probably could have
showed up at halftime and stood in
the front row at center court. What
happened?
It's not as if that 'O6-'O7 team was
all that much better than this year's
team. In 'O6-'O7, the Cardinal men's
basketball team was likely the last
team in the NCAA Tournament and
got absolutely annihilated by
Louisville in the first round. Plus,
back then, Sixth Man membership
actually cost money (I think it was
about $7O for the season). Before one
game either that season or the next, I
asked Steve Lavin, who is now the
head coach at St. John's but at the time
was an ABC announcer, what some of
the best atmospheres for college bas
ketball were in the country. Without
hesitation he said Stanford was right
near the top. Not anymore.
Today, the student section is free
and still empty. Maybe if the Athletics
Department still charged for those
