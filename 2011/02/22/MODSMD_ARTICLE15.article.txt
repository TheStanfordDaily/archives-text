# REPELLING RICE
## Stanford takes series from Owls 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
opened the 2011 season the
right way this weekend, taking
two out of three games from
Rice down in Houston.
The Cardinal (2-1), ranked
No. 13 to start the season by
Baseball America, captured the
series over the No. 18 Owls (1-2)
with a 5-3 win on Friday, a 7-1
loss on Saturday and a 6-2 victo
ry on Sunday.
The weekend was highlight
ed by excellent pitching es
pecially from the Cardinal
bullpen and the impressive
power of some new starters in
the Stanford lineup.

Sophomore righthander
Mark Appel opened up the se
ries on the mound in his first
career Friday start and did not
have an easy task in front of
him. The lineup Appel had to
face featured third baseman
Anthony Rendon, last year's
National Player of the Year,
who had a .394 batting average
and 26 home runs in the 2010
season.

However, Appel did well to
shut down the Owls' potent
lineup, pitching five and two
thirds innings while giving up

only two runs and holding Ren
don to a 0-for-4 night at the
plate.
Down 2-1 after six innings,
the Cardinal turned its offense
on, sneaking around the base
paths to score on an error and
then on a double play to take a
3-2 lead.
The decisive blow in Fri
day's contest came in the top
half of the next inning though,
when sophomore first baseman
Justin Ringo clubbed an inside
fastball high into the night sky
and over the right field fence
for a two-run home run.
Junior lefthander Scott
Snodgress came in and closed
the game out for the Cardinal,
allowing one run to score on a
wild pitch before settling down
and getting the final strikeout
and the win.
The game was especially im-
