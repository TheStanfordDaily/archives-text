# REPELLING RICE
## Stanford takes series from Owls 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
opened the 2011 season the
right way this weekend, taking
two out of three games from
Rice down in Houston.
The Cardinal (2-1), ranked
No. 13 to start the season by
Baseball America, captured the
series over the No. 18 Owls (1-2)
with a 5-3 win on Friday, a 7-1
loss on Saturday and a 6-2 victo
ry on Sunday.
The weekend was highlight
ed by excellent pitching es
pecially from the Cardinal
bullpen and the impressive
power of some new starters in
the Stanford lineup.

Sophomore righthander
Mark Appel opened up the se
ries on the mound in his first
career Friday start and did not
have an easy task in front of
him. The lineup Appel had to
face featured third baseman
Anthony Rendon, last year's
National Player of the Year,
who had a .394 batting average
and 26 home runs in the 2010
season.

However, Appel did well to
shut down the Owls' potent
lineup, pitching five and two
thirds innings while giving up

only two runs and holding Ren
don to a 0-for-4 night at the
plate.
Down 2-1 after six innings,
the Cardinal turned its offense
on, sneaking around the base
paths to score on an error and
then on a double play to take a
3-2 lead.
The decisive blow in Fri
day's contest came in the top
half of the next inning though,
when sophomore first baseman
Justin Ringo clubbed an inside
fastball high into the night sky
and over the right field fence
for a two-run home run.
Junior lefthander Scott
Snodgress came in and closed
the game out for the Cardinal,
allowing one run to score on a
wild pitch before settling down
and getting the final strikeout
and the win.

pressive for Appel, who was forced
to be the Friday starter after two
junior pitchers Brett Mooney
ham and Jordan Pries were
scratched from the lineup with in
juries.
The Cardinal was unable to fol
low up the solid performance on
Friday night with a comparable ef
fort on Saturday though, as the
team lacked any timely hitting in a
7-1 loss.
Stanford's offense was all but
shut down in a nice effort from Owl
starter Matthew Reckling, who
threw six shutout innings and gave
up only four hits.
Reckling's performance stood in
contrast to Stanford's junior starter
Chris Reed, who struggled with
command and gave up four runs in
the bottom of the second and three
runs in the bottom of the third.
However, junior A.J. Talt had a stel
lar performance out of the bullpen,
sidearming his way through three
and one-third innings without giv
ing up a hit or a run.
The only offensive highlight of
the day was when freshman right
fielder Austin Wilson blasted a solo
shot in the top of the seventh inning
that rocketed over 350 feet to clear

the left field fence.
With the series tied 1-1 heading
into Sunday's contest, the Cardinal
called on sophomore righty Dean
McArdle to bring the series home.
McArdle, who went 5-0 last sea
son, gritted out five tough innings,
giving up only one run after a bases
loaded, no-out situation in the top
of the first inning.

From then on, the story of the
game was left up to the Cardinal
freshmen. Stanford took the lead
and never gave it up after rookie
first baseman Brian Ragira ripped
an RBI triple into the right field gap
in the fourth inning, which was
promptly followed by a Wilson sin
gle that scored another run to make
the lead 3-1.
McArdle then handed the ball to
fellow righthander Danny Sand
brink, who closed out with four in
nings of solid pitching, only giving
up one run of his own.
Sandbrink also got a little help
from the youngsters when fresh
man second baseman Lonnie
Kauppila hit a solo shot that barely
cleared the left field wall in the sev
enth inning, Wilson had another
RBI single, and Kauppila brought
another run home on a fielder's
choice to notch the 6-2 final tally.
The two wins stretched the Car
dinal's all-time record against Rice
to 9-3, and set Stanford off on the
right foot for a tough season where
it will face off against eight of the
top 25 teams in the nation.
The Cardinal will return to the
Farm to host California in its home
opener at Sunken Diamond today
at 5:30 p.m. before heading to Van
derbilt for a three-game series start
ing Friday night.
