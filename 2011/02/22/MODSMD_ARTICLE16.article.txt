## Cardinal shut down by Trojans 
### CAROLINE CASELLI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a disheartening 69-53 loss to visiting
USC on Saturday evening, the Stanford men's
basketball team failed to pick up a win in its
final conference homestand of the season. The
Cardinal (13-13, 6-9 Pac-10) extended its los
ing streak to three games and fell to eighth in
the Pac-10 standings.

USC (15-12,7-7), which beat Stanford, 65-
42, and held the Card to 22.2-percent shooting
in Los Angeles last month, effectively shut
down the Cardinal's offense once again,
though this time on the road at Maples Pavil
ion. The Trojans have been responsible for
Stanford's two lowest-scoring conference
games this season, limiting Stanford to 42 and
53 points, respectively. Junior guard Jeremy
Green, who had five straight 20-plus point
games prior to Saturday night, was held to just
11 points in light of USC senior guard Marcus
Simmons' stingy defense.
"Jeremy is such a scoring threat that guys
are going to focus on him," said freshman for
ward Josh Huestis. "He's a focal point of de
fenses every single game. No matter where he
goes, he's got someone on him."
Though Stanford opened the game on a 7-
3 run, including a three-pointer from freshman
forward John Gage in his first collegiate start
and a dunk from Green, USC quickly took
control of the game. USC junior forward
Nikola Vucevic racked up seven early points,
aiding the Trojans to a 13-12 lead with 15:24 re
maining in the first half. The Cardinal wouldn't
lead for the remainder of the game.
"I thought we started off the first half well,
to be quite frank," said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "They're a good team. They
get after you defensively and are really, really
quick. I think as they started to wear us down
a bit, it took a toll on us."
After a decent start, however, Stanford
couldn't get anything going throughout the
middle of the first half. Led by Vucevic and
redshirt senior forward Alex Stepheson, USC
went on a 22-4 run Huestis scored all four
for Stanford on back-to-back plays to ex
tend its lead to 30-16. After trailing by as much
as 18 in the first half, Green, along with redshirt
junior forward Josh Owens, freshman forward
Anthony Brown and freshman guard Aaron
Bright, gave the offense some life and nar
rowed the deficit to single digits (40-31) at
halftime.
"I tried to find holes in the defense, things
like that," Huestis said. "When they tried to
throw two guys at Jeremy [Green], the
matchups went in our favor."
Stanford's momentum did not continue
into the second half, with the Trojans pulling
away yet again. After USC junior guard Jio
Fontan sunk a three followed by two foul shots
from Vucevic, the Trojans took their largest
lead of the night, 65-45, with 5:31 remaining.
The Card only scored two field goals in the
game's final 10:30 a jumper from Green
and a layup from Owens with free throws
constituting Stanford's remaining eight points.
"It was a tough shooting night for all our
guys tonight," Dawkins said. "When that hap-
