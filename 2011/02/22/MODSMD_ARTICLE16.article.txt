## Cardinal shut down by Trojans 
### CAROLINE CASELLI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a disheartening 69-53 loss to visiting
USC on Saturday evening, the Stanford men's
basketball team failed to pick up a win in its
final conference homestand of the season. The
Cardinal (13-13, 6-9 Pac-10) extended its los
ing streak to three games and fell to eighth in
the Pac-10 standings.

USC (15-12,7-7), which beat Stanford, 65-
42, and held the Card to 22.2-percent shooting
in Los Angeles last month, effectively shut
down the Cardinal's offense once again,
though this time on the road at Maples Pavil
ion. The Trojans have been responsible for
Stanford's two lowest-scoring conference
games this season, limiting Stanford to 42 and
53 points, respectively. Junior guard Jeremy
Green, who had five straight 20-plus point
games prior to Saturday night, was held to just
11 points in light of USC senior guard Marcus
Simmons' stingy defense.
"Jeremy is such a scoring threat that guys
are going to focus on him," said freshman for
ward Josh Huestis. "He's a focal point of de
fenses every single game. No matter where he
goes, he's got someone on him."
Though Stanford opened the game on a 7-
3 run, including a three-pointer from freshman
forward John Gage in his first collegiate start
and a dunk from Green, USC quickly took
control of the game. USC junior forward
Nikola Vucevic racked up seven early points,
aiding the Trojans to a 13-12 lead with 15:24 re
maining in the first half. The Cardinal wouldn't
lead for the remainder of the game.
"I thought we started off the first half well,
to be quite frank," said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "They're a good team. They
get after you defensively and are really, really
quick. I think as they started to wear us down
a bit, it took a toll on us."
After a decent start, however, Stanford
couldn't get anything going throughout the
middle of the first half. Led by Vucevic and
redshirt senior forward Alex Stepheson, USC
went on a 22-4 run Huestis scored all four
for Stanford on back-to-back plays to ex
tend its lead to 30-16. After trailing by as much
as 18 in the first half, Green, along with redshirt
junior forward Josh Owens, freshman forward
Anthony Brown and freshman guard Aaron
Bright, gave the offense some life and nar
rowed the deficit to single digits (40-31) at
halftime.
"I tried to find holes in the defense, things
like that," Huestis said. "When they tried to
throw two guys at Jeremy [Green], the
matchups went in our favor."
Stanford's momentum did not continue
into the second half, with the Trojans pulling
away yet again. After USC junior guard Jio
Fontan sunk a three followed by two foul shots
from Vucevic, the Trojans took their largest
lead of the night, 65-45, with 5:31 remaining.
The Card only scored two field goals in the
game's final 10:30 a jumper from Green
and a layup from Owens with free throws
constituting Stanford's remaining eight points.
"It was a tough shooting night for all our
guys tonight," Dawkins said. "When that hap-

pens, you have to find other ways to
win. You have to get to the free
throw line, you have to get to the bas
ket, you have to make plays in other
ways, and that's where our maturity
has to be."
Owens led the way for the Card
with 13 points on 6-for-10 shooting
and seven rebounds. Freshman for
ward Dwight Powell finished the
game with 10 boards and Green tal
lied 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting.
Huestis had the best game of his
Stanford career, scoring 11 points on
4-for-5 shooting and grabbing five
rebounds.
For the Trojans, Vucevic led all
players with 19 points, 14 rebounds
and three blocks. Three of his team
mates also scored in double digits:
Stepheson with 15, redshirt senior
guard Donte Smith with 13 and

freshman guard Maurice Jones with
10.
Stanford shot only 33.3 percent
on the evening, with an especially
lackluster second half in which the
team shot 20 percent from the field
and went 0-for-ll from behind the
arc. USC shot 53.2 percent from the
floor and 57.1 percent from long
range on the night.
"It was just tough," Huestis said.
"It was a rough shooting night for
everybody. We just have to get back
into the gym and get better."
"Basically, we have to get better
as a team," Dawkins agreed. "I think
that it showed tonight, and I think
that it was good for our players to see
that. It's all about improving from
here on out, both individually and
collectively."
In desperate need of a win, the
Cardinal will travel to Corvallis,
Ore., where it will face Oregon State
on Thursday at 6 p.m.

The Card only scored two field goals in the
game's final 10:30 a jumper from Green
and a layup from Owens with free throws
constituting Stanford's remaining eight points.
"It was a tough shooting night for all our
guys tonight," Dawkins said. "When that hap-

pens, you have to find other ways to
win. You have to get to the free
throw line, you have to get to the bas
ket, you have to make plays in other
ways, and that's where our maturity
has to be."
Owens led the way for the Card
with 13 points on 6-for-10 shooting
and seven rebounds. Freshman for
ward Dwight Powell finished the
game with 10 boards and Green tal
lied 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting.
Huestis had the best game of his
Stanford career, scoring 11 points on
4-for-5 shooting and grabbing five
rebounds.
For the Trojans, Vucevic led all
players with 19 points, 14 rebounds
and three blocks. Three of his team
mates also scored in double digits:
Stepheson with 15, redshirt senior
guard Donte Smith with 13 and

freshman guard Maurice Jones with
10.
Stanford shot only 33.3 percent
on the evening, with an especially
lackluster second half in which the
team shot 20 percent from the field
and went 0-for-ll from behind the
arc. USC shot 53.2 percent from the
floor and 57.1 percent from long
range on the night.
"It was just tough," Huestis said.
"It was a rough shooting night for
everybody. We just have to get back
into the gym and get better."
"Basically, we have to get better
as a team," Dawkins agreed. "I think
that it showed tonight, and I think
that it was good for our players to see
that. It's all about improving from
here on out, both individually and
collectively."
In desperate need of a win, the
Cardinal will travel to Corvallis,
Ore., where it will face Oregon State
on Thursday at 6 p.m.

Freshman forward Josh Huestis (above) had the best game of his young
Stanford career, scoring 11 points on 4-for-5 shooting. The rest of the team
did not fare as well, particularly on the offensive end, in a 69-53 loss to USC.
With a disheartening 69-53 loss to visiting
USC on Saturday evening, the Stanford men's
basketball team failed to pick up a win in its
final conference homestand of the season. The
Cardinal (13-13, 6-9 Pac-10) extended its los
ing streak to three games and fell to eighth in
the Pac-10 standings.

USC (15-12,7-7), which beat Stanford, 65-
42, and held the Card to 22.2-percent shooting
in Los Angeles last month, effectively shut
down the Cardinal's offense once again,
though this time on the road at Maples Pavil
ion. The Trojans have been responsible for
Stanford's two lowest-scoring conference
games this season, limiting Stanford to 42 and
53 points, respectively. Junior guard Jeremy
Green, who had five straight 20-plus point
games prior to Saturday night, was held to just
11 points in light of USC senior guard Marcus
Simmons' stingy defense.
"Jeremy is such a scoring threat that guys
are going to focus on him," said freshman for
ward Josh Huestis. "He's a focal point of de
fenses every single game. No matter where he
goes, he's got someone on him."
Though Stanford opened the game on a 7-
3 run, including a three-pointer from freshman
forward John Gage in his first collegiate start
and a dunk from Green, USC quickly took
control of the game. USC junior forward
Nikola Vucevic racked up seven early points,
aiding the Trojans to a 13-12 lead with 15:24 re
maining in the first half. The Cardinal wouldn't
lead for the remainder of the game.
"I thought we started off the first half well,
to be quite frank," said Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins. "They're a good team. They
get after you defensively and are really, really
quick. I think as they started to wear us down
a bit, it took a toll on us."
After a decent start, however, Stanford
couldn't get anything going throughout the
middle of the first half. Led by Vucevic and
redshirt senior forward Alex Stepheson, USC
went on a 22-4 run Huestis scored all four
for Stanford on back-to-back plays to ex
tend its lead to 30-16. After trailing by as much
as 18 in the first half, Green, along with redshirt
junior forward Josh Owens, freshman forward
Anthony Brown and freshman guard Aaron
Bright, gave the offense some life and nar
rowed the deficit to single digits (40-31) at
halftime.
"I tried to find holes in the defense, things
like that," Huestis said. "When they tried to
throw two guys at Jeremy [Green], the
matchups went in our favor."
Stanford's momentum did not continue
into the second half, with the Trojans pulling
away yet again. After USC junior guard Jio
Fontan sunk a three followed by two foul shots
from Vucevic, the Trojans took their largest
lead of the night, 65-45, with 5:31 remaining.
The Card only scored two field goals in the
game's final 10:30 a jumper from Green
and a layup from Owens with free throws
constituting Stanford's remaining eight points.
"It was a tough shooting night for all our
guys tonight," Dawkins said. "When that hap-

pens, you have to find other ways to

Owens led the way for the Card
with 13 points on 6-for-10 shooting
and seven rebounds. Freshman for
ward Dwight Powell finished the
game with 10 boards and Green tal
lied 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting.
Huestis had the best game of his
Stanford career, scoring 11 points on
4-for-5 shooting and grabbing five
