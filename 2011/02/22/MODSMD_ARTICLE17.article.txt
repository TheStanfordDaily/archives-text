### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Making the most of its final road trip of
the regular season, Stanford women's bas
ketball pulled away in the second half of
two crucial Pac-10 contests last weekend,
beating USC 78-64 and No. 9 UCLA 67-
53. The pair of victories ensures a semifi
nal berth in the Pac-10 Tournament for
No. 3 Stanford (24-2, 15-0 Pac-10) and
marks a significant step toward earning a
10th consecutive regular season champi
onship.

After losing by more than 40 points in
Maples Pavilion last month, the Trojans
(16-9, 8-6) put up a major fight in the
Galen Center on Friday, keeping the Car
dinal on its toes with just a two-point lead
at the half.
"USC came out, and it looked like they
wanted to slow the tempo a little bit," said

Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"They were more physical this time
around."
The Cardinal opened the second half
on a 12-2 run, led by senior forward Kayla
Pedersen and her classmate, point guard
Jeanette Pohlen.The duo scored 17 and 19
points, respectively, and both shot over 50
percent from the field.
"Both Kayla and Jeanette, both sen
iors on our team, they made big plays for
us and really battled," VanDerveer said.
"They did what they needed to make us
successful."
Their performance is especially en
couraging following the pair's lackluster
performance in a 62-52 win over Washing
ton on Saturday. Pohlen shot just l-for-9 in
that game, and Pedersen was 3-for-13.
"After playing Washington and seeing
how physical they were with us, we pretty
much expected that for the rest of the sea
son," Pohlen said.
The seniors' return to form was timely
for Stanford, which lost Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike to a sprained right ankle in the sec
ond half against the Trojans. At the time of
her departure, the junior forward led the
team with 16.8 points per game.
Despite initial optimism from Van-
Derveer, Nnemkadi Ogwumike wasn't
