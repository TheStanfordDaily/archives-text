# STANFORD EXTENDS CONFERENCE LEAD
## 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Making the most of its final road trip of
the regular season, Stanford women's bas
ketball pulled away in the second half of
two crucial Pac-10 contests last weekend,
beating USC 78-64 and No. 9 UCLA 67-
53. The pair of victories ensures a semifi
nal berth in the Pac-10 Tournament for
No. 3 Stanford (24-2, 15-0 Pac-10) and
marks a significant step toward earning a
10th consecutive regular season champi
onship.

After losing by more than 40 points in
Maples Pavilion last month, the Trojans
(16-9, 8-6) put up a major fight in the
Galen Center on Friday, keeping the Car
dinal on its toes with just a two-point lead
at the half.
"USC came out, and it looked like they
wanted to slow the tempo a little bit," said

Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"They were more physical this time
around."
The Cardinal opened the second half
on a 12-2 run, led by senior forward Kayla
Pedersen and her classmate, point guard
Jeanette Pohlen.The duo scored 17 and 19
points, respectively, and both shot over 50
percent from the field.
"Both Kayla and Jeanette, both sen
iors on our team, they made big plays for
us and really battled," VanDerveer said.
"They did what they needed to make us
successful."
Their performance is especially en
couraging following the pair's lackluster
performance in a 62-52 win over Washing
ton on Saturday. Pohlen shot just l-for-9 in
that game, and Pedersen was 3-for-13.
"After playing Washington and seeing
how physical they were with us, we pretty
much expected that for the rest of the sea
son," Pohlen said.
The seniors' return to form was timely
for Stanford, which lost Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike to a sprained right ankle in the sec
ond half against the Trojans. At the time of
her departure, the junior forward led the
team with 16.8 points per game.
Despite initial optimism from Van-
Derveer, Nnemkadi Ogwumike wasn't

against UCLA (22-3,12-2), as soph
omore forward Joslyn Tinkle got the
call when the lineups were an
nounced.
While the seniors made all the
difference two days earlier, Stanford
got a huge boost from a pair of fresh
men at Pauley Pavilion on Sunday.
Toni Kokenis, a rookie guard, played
37 minutes and scored 13 points off
the bench, while starting forward
Chiney Ogwumike, Nnemkadi's
younger sister, led the team with 18
points and 15 rebounds.
"We affectionately call our fresh
man 'babies,' and our babies grew up
today," VanDerveer said. "Toni and
Chiney had just fabulous games, re
ally just so poised, making big free
throws and making big plays all
game long."
The younger Ogwumike scored
13 after halftime, when Stanford was
in a 28-28 deadlock with the Bruins.
In their last meeting, the Cardinal
held UCLA to just 15 first-half
points in a 64-38 victory.
VanDerveer, who said she was
working with an unusually small and
agile lineup in the absence of
Nnemkadi Ogwumike, told the
team to start driving the ball to
Chiney in the post.
"A lot of times when Chiney is
out there, the ball is going to Nneka,
and Chiney's getting the O-boards,"
VanDerveer said. "And in this par
ticular game, without Nneka,

Chiney was our number-one low
block presence. In the first half, we
didn't really do a good enough job
getting her the ball, and I don't know
if she understood that's what we
needed.
"But at halftime, it was made
pretty clear," she continued. "This is
what you have to do."
The Cardinal jumped out of the
gate in the second frame, extending
its lead to 47-37 on a Kokenis three
pointer. The Bruins, meanwhile, shot
just 19-for-61 from the field, includ
ing a miserable 9-for-32 after half
time.
Stanford is the only Pac-10 team
to defeat UCLA this year, and Van-
Derveer still holds the Bruins in high
regard.
"They have a great team and a
great season," she said. "We could
easily play them again in the Pac-10
Tournament, and they're going to go
on and do really well in the NCAA
Tournament."
The Cardinal made quick work
of UCLA in their last postseason
meeting, dealing the Bruins a 70-46
loss in the final game of the Pac-10
Tournament last March. Like last
season, the conference champi
onships are set to be played in Los
Angeles next month.
In the near future, though, Stan
ford will play its final two-game se
ries of the regular season against
the Oregon schools this weekend.

slate against Oregon State at 7 p.m.

able to return for Sunday's game
against UCLA (22-3,12-2), as soph
omore forward Joslyn Tinkle got the
call when the lineups were an
nounced.
While the seniors made all the
difference two days earlier, Stanford
got a huge boost from a pair of fresh
men at Pauley Pavilion on Sunday.
Toni Kokenis, a rookie guard, played
37 minutes and scored 13 points off
the bench, while starting forward
Chiney Ogwumike, Nnemkadi's
younger sister, led the team with 18
points and 15 rebounds.
"We affectionately call our fresh
man 'babies,' and our babies grew up
today," VanDerveer said. "Toni and
Chiney had just fabulous games, re
ally just so poised, making big free
throws and making big plays all
game long."
The younger Ogwumike scored
13 after halftime, when Stanford was
in a 28-28 deadlock with the Bruins.
In their last meeting, the Cardinal
held UCLA to just 15 first-half
points in a 64-38 victory.
VanDerveer, who said she was
working with an unusually small and
agile lineup in the absence of
Nnemkadi Ogwumike, told the
team to start driving the ball to
Chiney in the post.
"A lot of times when Chiney is
out there, the ball is going to Nneka,
and Chiney's getting the O-boards,"
VanDerveer said. "And in this par
ticular game, without Nneka,

Chiney was our number-one low
block presence. In the first half, we
didn't really do a good enough job
getting her the ball, and I don't know
if she understood that's what we
needed.
"But at halftime, it was made
pretty clear," she continued. "This is
what you have to do."
The Cardinal jumped out of the
gate in the second frame, extending
its lead to 47-37 on a Kokenis three
pointer. The Bruins, meanwhile, shot
just 19-for-61 from the field, includ
ing a miserable 9-for-32 after half
time.
Stanford is the only Pac-10 team
to defeat UCLA this year, and Van-
Derveer still holds the Bruins in high
regard.
"They have a great team and a
great season," she said. "We could
easily play them again in the Pac-10
Tournament, and they're going to go
on and do really well in the NCAA
Tournament."
The Cardinal made quick work
of UCLA in their last postseason
meeting, dealing the Bruins a 70-46
loss in the final game of the Pac-10
Tournament last March. Like last
season, the conference champi
onships are set to be played in Los
Angeles next month.
In the near future, though, Stan
ford will play its final two-game se
ries of the regular season against
the Oregon schools this weekend.

Making the most of its final road trip of
the regular season, Stanford women's bas
ketball pulled away in the second half of
two crucial Pac-10 contests last weekend,
beating USC 78-64 and No. 9 UCLA 67-
53. The pair of victories ensures a semifi
nal berth in the Pac-10 Tournament for
No. 3 Stanford (24-2, 15-0 Pac-10) and
marks a significant step toward earning a
10th consecutive regular season champi
onship.

After losing by more than 40 points in
Maples Pavilion last month, the Trojans
(16-9, 8-6) put up a major fight in the
Galen Center on Friday, keeping the Car
dinal on its toes with just a two-point lead
at the half.
"USC came out, and it looked like they
wanted to slow the tempo a little bit," said

Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"They were more physical this time
around."
The Cardinal opened the second half
on a 12-2 run, led by senior forward Kayla
Pedersen and her classmate, point guard
Jeanette Pohlen.The duo scored 17 and 19
points, respectively, and both shot over 50
percent from the field.
"Both Kayla and Jeanette, both sen
iors on our team, they made big plays for
us and really battled," VanDerveer said.
"They did what they needed to make us
successful."
Their performance is especially en
couraging following the pair's lackluster
performance in a 62-52 win over Washing
ton on Saturday. Pohlen shot just l-for-9 in
that game, and Pedersen was 3-for-13.
"After playing Washington and seeing
how physical they were with us, we pretty
much expected that for the rest of the sea
son," Pohlen said.
The seniors' return to form was timely
for Stanford, which lost Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike to a sprained right ankle in the sec
ond half against the Trojans. At the time of
her departure, the junior forward led the
team with 16.8 points per game.
Despite initial optimism from Van-
Derveer, Nnemkadi Ogwumike wasn't
