# Struggles in Seattle
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis
team had an up-and-down week
end at the ITA National Team In
door Championships in Seattle,
going 1-2 against quality oppo
nents. The No. 7 Cardinal fell on
Friday to No. 11 Florida, defeated
No. 2 USC on Saturday and lost to
No. 16 Georgia on Sunday.

Such erratic play is uncharac
teristic of the Stanford team thus
far this year the squad was off
to a perfect 7-0 start before this
weekend, its best opening since
2002. Consistency has been an im
pressive aspect of the team so far
this year, but was disrupted during
the weekend tournament.
Friday's match versus Florida
was a tight one from the very be
ginning. The Gators claimed the
early doubles point when courts

two and three went the way of the
Gators, and from there, Florida
was able to build a substantial 3-
1 lead by winning two of the first
three singles matches. Stanford
refused to go away, though, and
fought back as seniors Greg Hir
shman and Alex Clayton posted
clutch wins for the Cardinal. Tied
up at 3-3, the outcome of the con
test came down to the third set of
the No. 1 singles match.
Stanford junior and reigning
NCAA singles champion Bradley
Klahn, ranked No. 7 nationally in
singles, had battled back against
Florida's ninth-ranked Alexandre
Lacroix to hold a 2-1 lead in the
pivotal third set. Lacroix stormed
back, winning five of the final six
games to clinch the set, the match
and the victory for the Gators.
The Cardinal showed great re
solve on Saturday, bouncing back
from its tough loss to Florida by
posting its most impressive victo
ry of the year, a 4-3 nail-biter over
USC. This contest also came
down to a final, three-set match,
this one occurring at court four,
where sophomore Denis Lin was

pitted against the Trojans' Emilio
Gomez.
Gomez fought to force the
third set by winning the second,
and, like Klahn did the day before
him, managed to carry that mo
mentum into the close final set.
But Lin remained strong, holding
off a final charge and securing the
victory for Stanford with a 6-3
third set win. Lin had a great day
against USC, winning the point
clinching matches in both singles
and doubles.
On Sunday, Georgia was the
team pulling off the upset, defeat
ing the Cardinal by a score of 4-2.
Stanford was down early on, as the
Bulldogs jumped out to a quick 1-0
lead with wins on courts one and
three during doubles play.
Stanford momentarily had
the score tied after Hirshman dis
posed of his opponent on court
five, but it was fleeting, as the
Bulldogs posted victories on
courts two and four, over senior
Ryan Thacher and Lin, respec
tively. Klahn kept the Cardinal in
the match with a straight-set win
on court one over No. 24 Javier
Garrapiz, before sophomore
Matt Kandath fell to Bulldog
freshman Hernus Pieters on court
six, thereby clinching the victory
for Georgia.
The stiff competition in Seat
tle gave the Cardinal a gauge of
its current place in the collegiate
tennis landscape.
"We had a good win against
USC but also lost some close
ones," said freshman Jamin Ball.
"We're right there with the best
teams, we just need to get a little
better. The sky really is the limit.
Our next five matches are all
against top-15 schools which will
be a good, tough test for us."
That stretch will start this
weekend as the squad heads down
to Los Angeles for two difficult
road matches: at No. 6 UCLA on
Friday and then against USC on
Saturday.
