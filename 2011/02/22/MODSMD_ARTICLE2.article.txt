# STUDENT LIFE
## Class of '11 starts job hunt Some seniors look beyond CDC listsings, career fairs 
### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
Many current seniors are
branching out to different career
paths after graduation, looking be
yond Career Development Center
(CDC) listings and career fairs in
their job search.
"Students seem to be more open
to alternative types of careers dur
ing a recession," CDC Director
Lance Choy wrote in an e-mail to
The Daily.
Choy noted that applications to
Teach for America and the Peace
Corps have increased in the last two
years. But the most common way
for students to find jobs is to use
their personal networks, he said,
stressing the importance of con
necting with alumni.
Alii Stuppy 'll, a psychology
major who plans to pursue a career
in clinical psychology, hopes to
complete a research fellowship next
year.
Stuppy said she was interested in
clinical psychology, but hasn't had
much exposure to it at Stanford.
"I don't really have the best idea
of what clinical psychology entails
from Stanford, which is more re
search oriented," Stuppy said.
She emphasized the importance
of gaining research experience for
those interested in pursuing gradu
ate studies in psychology.
Chemical engineering major
Abraham Berhane 'll hopes to se
cure an entry-level position at a
pharmaceutical company. His long
term goal is to work in research and
development in biotechnology.
"Right now I'm focusing on try
ing to find a job for next year,"
Berhane said. "A lot of [the search]
has just been Googling top pharma-
ceutical companies in the area."
Berhane said he found positions
despite the economic downturn.
His professors often provided ad
vice on where to look for openings.
Outside of the sciences, many in
dustries have taken a hit in the eco
nomic downturn, among them en
tertainment and advertising, Choy
said. But some students haven't
been deterred from pursuing arts
careers.
Juliann Ma 'll, who is majoring
in music and minoring in creative
writing, hopes to continue her musi
cal training and take a stab at a ca
reer as a concert pianist. She has ap

plied for a Fulbright in Paris and to
music schools on the East Coast.
"The most important thing for
me is doing something I love," Ma
said. "I would like to see how far my
music career can go."
At the same time, Ma is well
aware of the challenges that musi
cians seeking performance careers
face.
"It takes a lot more than just
training and performing," she said.
"It has been in my considerations
for a long time to get a job or some
thing much more secure than being
a concert artist.
"If that's what I'm good at, I
should just try it," she added.
Olivia Haas 'll, an English
major, would eventually like to
work in theater, film or television.
For Haas, the first stop after gradu
ation is the MFA Playwrights'

Workshop at the Kennedy Center
in Washington, D.C.
"The resources and connections
through Stanford are actually pret
ty remarkable for someone with my
interests," Haas said.
She emphasized the importance
of being proactive and reaching out
to potential employers. For Haas,
one key resource was the Stanford
Institute for Creativity and the Arts
(SICA), through which she com
pleted an internship with the Public
Theater in New York last summer.
For students pursuing careers in
the arts, flexibility is key, Haas said.
"I both enjoy and am terrified of
the uncertainty and the unknowns,"
Haas said. "That's just part of the
process."
