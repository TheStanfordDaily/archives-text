### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Noted speaker Arthur Emery discussed the
story of Guantanamo Bay detainee Abu
Zubaydah, a Saudi citizen whom the United
States government mistakenly suspected of A1
Qaeda involvement, last night at the Law
School.
Abu Zubaydah has been imprisoned in
Guantanamo Bay for nine years.
Former President George W. Bush claimed

Abu Zubaydah was one of the three top leaders
in A1 Qaeda. Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of de
fense under George W. Bush and a former
Hoover fellow, believed he was a senior A1
Qaeda official who had been intimately in
volved in a range of activities.
However, recent evidence has suggested
that Abu Zubaydah was ideologically opposed
to A1 Qaeda, Emery said. In 2000, Zubaydah's
Khalden camp was told that it either had to sup-

port At Qaeda rule or close.
"Abu Zubaydah, number three
in A1 Qaeda, and his camp was
closed by A1 Qaeda?" Emery said.
"It's incredible to believe that the
U.S. government believed that
when he wasn't involved in A1
Qaeda from the very beginning."
Emery argued that Guan
tanamo Bay's location is incredibly
strategic.
"It's outside of the United States
U.S. laws can't control it," he
said. "It's not a part of Cuba be
cause it's land-leased from Cuba.
It's really a black hole for justice by
law."
When the FBI first interrogated
Abu Zubaydah, its goals were to
gain his confidence in order to gath
er actionable intelligence.

"Beating someone until they
talk doesn't give them incentive to
talk," Emery said. "It gives them in
centive to shut up."
The FBI recognized this, where
as the CIA did not, he added. CIA
interrogators subjected Zubaydah
to waterboarding in an attempt to
obtain information. Emery de
scribed Zubaydah's situation as "a
world of torture and human de
basement."
"This is what we allowed, and we
continue to debate whether it is jus
tified," he said. "You can't do that to
a human being and still think of
yourself as a human being."
"We have to stand up and say we
won't let our country be this sort of
bastion of destruction in the
world," he said.
The event was co-sponsored by
Amnesty International.
