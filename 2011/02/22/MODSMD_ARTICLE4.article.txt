# WINNING BIG IN VEGAS
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
For the Stanford softball
team, the UNLV Louisville
Slugger Classic was an oppor
tunity to prove it belonged
among the nation's best. The
No. 18 Cardinal made quick
work of Utah State and Port
land State in the opening dou
bleheader on Friday, split a
pair of Saturday games by
knocking off No. 23 BYU be
fore falling to No. 9 Hawaii
and then topped off the week
end with a big 5-0 upset win
over No. 3 Tennessee.

Stanford (8-2) showed
flashes of brilliance over the
weekend and certainly justi
fied its lofty preseason rank
ing by hanging with Hawaii
and then shutting down a po
tent Tennessee offense thanks
to pitcher Ashley Chinn's one
hit shutout on Sunday.
Chinn, a senior, struggled
at times last year with her con
trol, but appears to have put
those issues to rest with a mas
terful performance against the
Volunteers.
