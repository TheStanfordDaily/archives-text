# WINNING BIG IN VEGAS
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
For the Stanford softball
team, the UNLV Louisville
Slugger Classic was an oppor
tunity to prove it belonged
among the nation's best. The
No. 18 Cardinal made quick
work of Utah State and Port
land State in the opening dou
bleheader on Friday, split a
pair of Saturday games by
knocking off No. 23 BYU be
fore falling to No. 9 Hawaii
and then topped off the week
end with a big 5-0 upset win
over No. 3 Tennessee.

Stanford (8-2) showed
flashes of brilliance over the
weekend and certainly justi
fied its lofty preseason rank
ing by hanging with Hawaii
and then shutting down a po
tent Tennessee offense thanks
to pitcher Ashley Chinn's one
hit shutout on Sunday.
Chinn, a senior, struggled
at times last year with her con
trol, but appears to have put
those issues to rest with a mas
terful performance against the
Volunteers.

Senior pitcher Ashley Chinn (above) had a dominant pitching performance in the finale of the UNLV
Louisville Slugger Classic to help the No. 18 Stanford softball team take down No. 3 Tennessee. The Card
beat the Volunteers and No. 23 BYU and lost only once, to No. 9 Hawaii, in the five-game tournament.
with production from all over the
lineup to back the player affec
tionately known as "Chinny" by
her teammates. Junior shortstop
Ashley Hansen had three hits, and
freshman designated player
Danielle Miller got things started
in the first inning with a run-scor
ing single.
Freshman left fielder Corey
Hanewich gave Chinn some breath
ing room in the fifth inning when
she doubled in two more runs.
That was plenty of support for
Chinn, who threw her first com
plete game of the year and im
proved to 4-0, lowering her ERA
to 3.54. The righthander used a
continuing mix of pitches to keep
the Volunteers offbalance, striking
out six and retiring the last 14 bat
ters in a row.
"1 think the biggest thing that
helped me in yesterday's game
was staying relaxed and confi
dent," Chinn said. "We were all
pumped for that game and 1 really
just wanted to go out there and get
the job done for the team. I was
feeling very confident yesterday,
from start to finish," she said.
"And [associate head coach Trisha
Ford] and [catcher Maya Burns]
did a great job with pitch calls. I
felt confident and aggressive with
each pitch I threw."
The Card started off the tour
nament hot in a game against
Utah State that featured plenty of
offense on both sides. The presea
son Ail-American Hansen had
four hits, including a double and
her first home run of the season. It
came as part of a Cardinal hit pa
rade four players had multiple
hits, including four each from jun
ior Sarah Hassman and Hansen.
Sophomore pitcher/outfielder
Teagan Gerhart hit her second
home run of the year, and in all,
Stanford banged out 19 hits and 18
runs in the 18-10 victory, short

ened to six innings by the eight
run rule.
But the bats seemed to fall
silent after the initial offensive ex
plosion. It took a masterpiece
from Gerhart (BIP, SH, IR, 088,
9K) in the nightcap against Port
land State and some timely hitting
from the pitcher herself in extra
innings to knock off the Vikings, 3-
1, in eight innings.
Gerhart again carried the load
against BYU, going the distance
while giving up just one earned
run. She had plenty of help from
second baseman Jenna Rich. The
sophomore from El Segundo,
Calif., didn't waste any time in
putting Stanford on the score
board, smacking a 1-0 pitch over
the wall in right-center field with
two outs in the first inning for a 1-
0 lead.
The Cougars equalized in the
bottom half of the inning, but Ger
hart hit a two-run home run to
deep center field to put the Cardi
nal on top for good. BYU pulled
within one run after errors by
Hanewich and Hansen allowed
three unearned runs to score. But
Rich homered again in the top of
the seventh inning to provide the
final 7-4 margin.
Facing a tough Hawaii team in
the second game of the Saturday
doubleheader was a difficult
matchup for the Card, especially
because the Rainbow Wahine sent
their junior ace, Stephanie Rick
etts, to the circle.
Ricketts didn't disappoint; a
home run from Miller was the only
blemish on the San Jose native's
pitching line.
Stanford finished second be
hind Hawaii in the tournament,
and will look to build off this early
season success as it hosts the Stan
ford Nike Invitational this week
end.The Cardinal opens the three
day tournament with a double
header on Friday against Mem
phis and North Dakota State at
Smith Family Stadium.

Sophomore Teagan Gerhart (above) did damage on the mound and in the
batter's box for the Cardinal, pitching a pair of gems and driving in multiple
runs over the weekend to help No. 18 Stanford Softball to a 4-1 record.
For the Stanford softball
team, the UNLV Louisville
Slugger Classic was an oppor
tunity to prove it belonged
among the nation's best. The
No. 18 Cardinal made quick
work of Utah State and Port
land State in the opening dou
bleheader on Friday, split a
pair of Saturday games by
knocking off No. 23 BYU be
fore falling to No. 9 Hawaii
and then topped off the week
end with a big 5-0 upset win
over No. 3 Tennessee.

Stanford (8-2) showed
flashes of brilliance over the
weekend and certainly justi
fied its lofty preseason rank
ing by hanging with Hawaii
and then shutting down a po
tent Tennessee offense thanks
to pitcher Ashley Chinn's one
hit shutout on Sunday.
Chinn, a senior, struggled
at times last year with her con
trol, but appears to have put
those issues to rest with a mas
terful performance against the
Volunteers.

Senior pitcher Ashley Chinn (above) had a dominant pitching performance in the finale of the UNLV
Louisville Slugger Classic to help the No. 18 Stanford softball team take down No. 3 Tennessee. The Card
beat the Volunteers and No. 23 BYU and lost only once, to No. 9 Hawaii, in the five-game tournament.
with production from all over the
lineup to back the player affec
tionately known as "Chinny" by
her teammates. Junior shortstop
Ashley Hansen had three hits, and
freshman designated player
Danielle Miller got things started
in the first inning with a run-scor
ing single.
Freshman left fielder Corey
Hanewich gave Chinn some breath
ing room in the fifth inning when
she doubled in two more runs.
That was plenty of support for
Chinn, who threw her first com
plete game of the year and im
proved to 4-0, lowering her ERA
to 3.54. The righthander used a
continuing mix of pitches to keep
the Volunteers offbalance, striking
out six and retiring the last 14 bat
ters in a row.
"1 think the biggest thing that
helped me in yesterday's game
was staying relaxed and confi
dent," Chinn said. "We were all
pumped for that game and 1 really
just wanted to go out there and get
the job done for the team. I was
feeling very confident yesterday,
from start to finish," she said.
"And [associate head coach Trisha
Ford] and [catcher Maya Burns]
did a great job with pitch calls. I
felt confident and aggressive with
each pitch I threw."
The Card started off the tour
nament hot in a game against
Utah State that featured plenty of
offense on both sides. The presea
son Ail-American Hansen had
four hits, including a double and
her first home run of the season. It
came as part of a Cardinal hit pa
rade four players had multiple
hits, including four each from jun
ior Sarah Hassman and Hansen.
Sophomore pitcher/outfielder
Teagan Gerhart hit her second
home run of the year, and in all,
Stanford banged out 19 hits and 18
runs in the 18-10 victory, short

ened to six innings by the eight
run rule.
But the bats seemed to fall
silent after the initial offensive ex
plosion. It took a masterpiece
from Gerhart (BIP, SH, IR, 088,
9K) in the nightcap against Port
land State and some timely hitting
from the pitcher herself in extra
innings to knock off the Vikings, 3-
1, in eight innings.
Gerhart again carried the load
against BYU, going the distance
while giving up just one earned
run. She had plenty of help from
second baseman Jenna Rich. The
sophomore from El Segundo,
Calif., didn't waste any time in
putting Stanford on the score
board, smacking a 1-0 pitch over
the wall in right-center field with
two outs in the first inning for a 1-
0 lead.
The Cougars equalized in the
bottom half of the inning, but Ger
hart hit a two-run home run to
deep center field to put the Cardi
nal on top for good. BYU pulled
within one run after errors by
Hanewich and Hansen allowed
three unearned runs to score. But
Rich homered again in the top of
the seventh inning to provide the
final 7-4 margin.
