## Humanities Ph.D.s face job crunch Hiring freezes and budget cuts reduce positions open to doctoral students 
### ZOE LEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although some on campus attribute hav
ing a Stanford degree to cushioning many of
the recession's effects on employment, doc
toral candidates studying the humanities still
face a number of difficulties.
"Hiring freezes because of budget cuts, es
pecially at state universities, have made a dif
ference across the board," said English pro
fessor Ramon Saldivar, who works as a job
placement officer for his department's doc
toral students. "There are definitely 30 per
cent almost 40 percent fewer jobs than
last year."
However, the picture for Stanford gradu
ates is not nearly as bleak as for students from
other programs, Saldivar said. Of the 12 doc
toral candidates in the English program grad
uating this year, only three are likely to not
find a job placement, a number Saldivar said
was "not unusual."
"Our graduate students are, of course, con
cerned about the job market," he said. "They
worry about it with some anxiety, but they're
also optimistic they'll be okay. The record
shows there's good reason for the optimism."
The tightening of the job market over the
past several years, however, has caused a
backlog of job applicants, pitting older gradu
ates who didn't find employment against re
cent graduates. This increase in the number of
applicants combined with a slashing of posi
tions has created a tougher job market.
Many doctoral candidates hope to earn a
tenure-track position in academia, but univer
sities have learned to get by with fewer hires.
"At this stage, it's fairly daunting," said Ben
Miller, a third-year doctoral candidate in phi
losophy. "Even if you're quite good in your
year, there might be all these people from the
year before who've had an extra year to polish."
Philosophy students face a disadvantage
that other humanities departments may not,
Miller said.
"The Stanford name doesn't so obviously
have the same kind of pedigree [in philoso
phy]," he said.
Stanford's location creates a "distinct out
sider feeling," since the American Philosophi
cal Association is situated in the East. As a re
sult, many job interviews take place there as
well.
Although Stanford graduates might fare
better than others, the tight job
market has added lag time between
graduation and finding a job. Many
graduate students now have to
apply over several consecutive
years before being hired, said assis
tant professor of English Saikat
Majumdar, who also works as a
placement director for English and
Modern Literature students.
While this lag provides students
with extra time to perfect their re
sumes and publish more of their
work, it also adds a heavy burden
for those who do not have a steady
salary in the meantime.
Reacting to employment con
cerns, more doctoral students in the
humanities chose to apply to post
doctoral fellowships or become ad
junct professors. According to Ma
jumdar, there are distinct disadvan
tages for those who choose the latter
track.
"An adjunct professorship does
n't pay much, it doesn't leave much
time for research," Majumdar said.
"A postdoc is a full-time position. It
has a better salary."
Faced with seemingly bleak op
tions, some students have shaped
their plans more creatively to be
come more attractive candidates in
the world of academia. Students in

"newer or more marginal fields"
such as minority literature or digital
humanities often have greater em
ployment success that those who
study more traditional topics, Ma
jumdar said.
But he also noted that students
should not necessarily change their
field of study for the promise of
higher future salaries.

"You should do what really ex
cites you, so I don't think you
should define your scholarship for
marketability," he said. "But that
said, it doesn't hurt to look exter
nally. You have to have a dialogue
between the two."
