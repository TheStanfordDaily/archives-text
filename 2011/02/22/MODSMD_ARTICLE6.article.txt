## Nurses vote in favor of strike authorization 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ An Le Nguyen 
Nearly 90 percent of unionized nurses who
cast ballots Feb. 17 voted in
favor of strike authorization against Stanford
Flospital and Clinics (SHC) and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH).
The Committee for Recognition of
Nursing Achievement (CRONA) urged its
member nurses to approve strike
authorization in response to an ongoing con
tract dispute with the two hospitals.
"Last December, the nurses rejected a ten
tative agreement," CRONA
President Lorie John wrote in a press release.
"When we asked the hospitals to
make what for them would be minor revisions,
but which are important and
objectionable to the nurses, they refused."
"We hope that the hospitals will now listen
to our concerns so that a strike
will not have to be called," Johnson said. "The
ball is in their court."_
In order to obtain strike authorization,
CRONA leaders needed at least
two-thirds of their approximately 2,700 nurses
to vote in favor of the move. Last
Thursday's vote saw 77 percent of the mem
bership vote "yes."
