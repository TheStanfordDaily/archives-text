## FRESHLY BAKED I Eat At Restaurants That Don't Even Exist Yet 
### Tim Moon 
When I saw a piece in The
Guardian on the similari
ties between foodie-ism
and indie rock, I did a double-take
somehow they'd stolen my idea!
We 11... I guess it's not actually
that hard to see the parallels. Indie
fans like discovering new bands (or
even listening to bands that don't
even exist yet); foodies like discov
ering ethnic hole-in-the-walls and
being the first to post about them
on Yelp. Indie fans pooh-pooh Top
40 pop music produced by the big
labels, perhaps admitting to liking J.
Bieber in an ironic or "hey look,
I'm not that snobby" way. Foodies
talk all sorts of smack about Olive
Garden and other chains, perhaps
admitting a weakness for McDon
ald's fries (you can say what you
want about McDonald's, but those
fries are perfect). Indie fans are all
about "authenticity" and turn their
backs on bands that "sell out";
while foodies compete to find the
"most authentic" dining experi
ences and denigrate Food Network
"sellouts" like Bobby Flay and
Emeril.

And like indie fans, foodies can
be really annoying. I should say that
I'm probably a bit of a foodie my
self, although it's not a term that I
like to associate myself with. When
you think of a foodie, you probably
imagine food-obsessed crazies who
lug DSLRs into restaurants and let
their food get cold while they snap
photos for their blog, culinary
snobs who insist on knowing the
provenance of everything they're
eating and can never just enjoy a
meal for what it is, or people who
waste too much time hunting
around for their next meal and who
are attracted like flies to buzzwords
like "artisanal," "house-made,"
"local," "seasonal." Sometimes, I
come across a blog written by one
of these Ã¼ber-foodies and wonder
how surreal it must be to be at one

of these dinners where all the
guests are other bloggers, showing
each other their cameras and using
phrases like "upon mastication" to
describe their eating. (I'm not even
joking about that last one it's a
catchphrase of sorts for one partic
ularly pompous food warrior.)
Just as Arcade Fire's Grammy
win shows how indie music has
been moving slowly into the main
stream, a lot of the attitudes em
braced by foodies have been em
braced by non-foodies. Chains like
Chipotle are moving toward using
naturally raised meats and local
produce, big bad Wal-Mart is stock
ing more organics and more and
more people are discovering new
restaurants and recipes through on
line communities like Yelp. At the
same time, there's a contingent of
foodies who mock these small
steps, either having a very indie
like fear of McNugget-scarfing pro
les entering the foodie ranks or
being dissatisfied with anything
that's not authentic/local/seasonal

Like Indie fans,
foodies can be
really annoying

enough for them. Snooty foodies,
we'll call them, the equivalent of "I
listen to bands that don't even exist
yet" indie fans.
This makes no sense! What ex
actly is the problem with having
more people appreciate good
food? I mean, sure, having more
people know about your favorite
restaurants might mean that you
have to wait longer, but that's cer
tainly preferable to having it go out
of business. And so what if it's a big
chain that's pushing its way into
local and organic? If foodies want
people to eat more local and organ
ic food, having the support of a big
chain that a lot of non-foodies like
is certainly going to be more help
ful than another blog post about
how Americans need to get their
act together.

There's also a (completely un
derstandable) growing backlash
against foodie-ism, driven in a
large part by people's dislike of the
somewhat ridiculous heights that
foodie-ism has been reaching and
of the snooty foodies that embody
these worst traits. This is really too
bad, because while there's a lot
about foodie-ism that probably
can't be integrated into the main
stream, there's also a lot that can,
and that can really benefit every
one. Things like eating locally and
seasonally, eating humanely raised
animals, supporting local restau
rants over chains, trying food from
different cultures, making food
something to think about and take
pleasure from rather than just
something to shovel into our
mouths.
So, you know, think about food.
But not too much.

Tim is trying his best not to become a
snooty foodie. Tell him what not to do
