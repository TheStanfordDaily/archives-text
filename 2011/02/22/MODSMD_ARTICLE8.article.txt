## FRESHLY BAKED I Eat At Restaurants That Don't Even Exist Yet 
### Tim Moon 
When I saw a piece in The
Guardian on the similari
ties between foodie-ism
and indie rock, I did a double-take
somehow they'd stolen my idea!
We 11... I guess it's not actually
that hard to see the parallels. Indie
fans like discovering new bands (or
even listening to bands that don't
even exist yet); foodies like discov
ering ethnic hole-in-the-walls and
being the first to post about them
on Yelp. Indie fans pooh-pooh Top
40 pop music produced by the big
labels, perhaps admitting to liking J.
Bieber in an ironic or "hey look,
I'm not that snobby" way. Foodies
talk all sorts of smack about Olive
Garden and other chains, perhaps
admitting a weakness for McDon
ald's fries (you can say what you
want about McDonald's, but those
fries are perfect). Indie fans are all
about "authenticity" and turn their
backs on bands that "sell out";
while foodies compete to find the
"most authentic" dining experi
ences and denigrate Food Network
"sellouts" like Bobby Flay and
Emeril.

And like indie fans, foodies can
be really annoying. I should say that
I'm probably a bit of a foodie my
self, although it's not a term that I
like to associate myself with. When
you think of a foodie, you probably
imagine food-obsessed crazies who
lug DSLRs into restaurants and let
their food get cold while they snap
photos for their blog, culinary
snobs who insist on knowing the
provenance of everything they're
eating and can never just enjoy a
meal for what it is, or people who
waste too much time hunting
around for their next meal and who
are attracted like flies to buzzwords
like "artisanal," "house-made,"
"local," "seasonal." Sometimes, I
come across a blog written by one
of these Ã¼ber-foodies and wonder
how surreal it must be to be at one

of these dinners where all the
guests are other bloggers, showing
each other their cameras and using
phrases like "upon mastication" to
describe their eating. (I'm not even
joking about that last one it's a
catchphrase of sorts for one partic
ularly pompous food warrior.)
Just as Arcade Fire's Grammy
win shows how indie music has
been moving slowly into the main
stream, a lot of the attitudes em
braced by foodies have been em
braced by non-foodies. Chains like
Chipotle are moving toward using
naturally raised meats and local
produce, big bad Wal-Mart is stock
ing more organics and more and
more people are discovering new
restaurants and recipes through on
line communities like Yelp. At the
same time, there's a contingent of
foodies who mock these small
steps, either having a very indie
like fear of McNugget-scarfing pro
les entering the foodie ranks or
being dissatisfied with anything
that's not authentic/local/seasonal

Like Indie fans,
foodies can be
really annoying
