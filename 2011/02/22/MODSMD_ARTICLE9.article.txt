# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## Out of Sight, Out of Mind

What was she thinking?"
"I think he thinks that you ..."
"You know, I think I've finally
figured him out."
I am convinced that we spend
much of our time and speculative
energy imagining the contents of
other people's minds. After all, we
are relatively familiar to ourselves,
but the other half of an interactive
exchange feels foreign to us and
therefore fascinating. The question
of how we understand unknown
minds seems to be such a strong
preoccupation that it affects not
only our personal deliberations, but
also many academic fields, at least
peripherally. Art and literature try
to express it, neuroscience tries to
explain it through investigating
consciousness and the mind-body
conundrum, computer science tries
to imitate it, philosophy tries to
apply it to issues of ethics and sub
jective experience.
Yet, if we are so interested in un
derstanding other people's minds,
why aren't we better at it? Even at a
place like Stanford, with the afore
mentioned areas of study as well as
student groups dedicated to cham
pioning alternative worldviews, any
curiosity we have about other peo
ple still comes into tension with our
tendency toward self-preoccupa
tion. Over the last few weeks, I've
had several experiences that have
emphasized to me how surprisingly
different two individuals' appraisals
of the same event can be. It's not
that one of those accounts is truer
than the other, not exactly. It's that
neither of these individuals has ac
cess to any personal lens besides his
own. I keep being reminded of the
old adage that there are two sides to
every story. This is one of those
head-nodding, yes-I-know truths
that each of us has likely heard from
a young age, but that doesn't make
it any less easy to forget.
Stanford students are exemplary
for their concern about a variety of
worldviews, and it seems that part of
receiving a liberal arts education is

learning to think about different is
sues from multiple perspectives.
But in the sphere of our social lives,
we sometimes struggle to embrace
this paradigm of mental flexibility.
In away, our college environment
encourages a self-preoccupied,
Kurtz-like mentality: my problem
set, my paper, my athletic activity,
my resume, my future career. The
real world is little different, and so
we could all very well keep living
our lives in reaction to our own sub
jective experience. We are curious
about others, yes, but at the same
time very self-interested, especially
in situations of high personal invest
ment or emotional pressure.
So, fair enough. In a social con
text, the emotions of the moment
can make us blind to anything out
side ourselves. This statement
strikes me as oversimplified. Emo
tional systems, in themselves, con
tribute to essential components of
social understanding, such as empa
thy. There's a reason why "I know
how you feel" can be such a power
ful contributor to building rapport
in a relationship. And there's a rea
son why public messages frequently
use emotional appeals to change
our perceptions. Emotions can pro
vide a framework for understand
ing someone else in away that ra
tional facts cannot.
Maybe it isn't only our emotions
that block us from understanding
the other side of the story. Maybe
it's simply that we don't know the
whole story, and that if we did, we
wouldn't be as likely to jump to con
clusions. When we lack knowledge,
all we can do is project ourselves
onto others. This problem seems to
be particularly relevant in our age
