## BBQ, Beer & Bulls One student's account of a Stanford Special Dinner 
### SUZANNE STATHATOS 
It was a dreary evening last Wednes
day night, and life seemed to be set
tling down along the Row. Most stu
dents were settling down in their
rooms for a night of homework, but
as I walked into Sigma Chi, it was a differ
ent story. The party was just starting to pick
up at the fraternity's Special Dinner.
As I walked into the house, I was hit by
a wave of the Wild West. In line with the
theme, some students were fully adorned
with feather headdresses, war paint and
fake tomahawks, while others sauntered in
their chaps and blue jeans. Cowgirls sport
ed plaid and daisy dukes. There were even
rodeo girls, bucking bulls and armadillos.
Toy guns snapped to settle the masses.
To outside observers, this might seem
like a deviation from your normal campus
party. But at Stanford, Special Dinners
have become a hallmark social event.
Garrett Delgado 'l2, a social chair at
Sigma Chi, explained how the frat came up
with this Special Dinner's theme: Wild West
Wednesday.
"For themes you just need to find the
best combination a good set of drinks to
match the event, [something] fun to dress
up for and something people will get excit
ed about," Delgado said. "If you have those,
everything falls ... into place."
Having successfully escaped the cowboy
sprawls, I made my way across the sea of
plaid and war paint to grab my mason jar. I
bolted to the kitchen to help myself to the
food, and it was a heavenly sight. Shoulder
to shoulder with other hungry guests, I
made sure to grab a slab of barbequed
chicken, mashed potatoes and coleslaw.
"Since it was Wild West themed, we saw
it fit that we should get our cook Emese
Legeny to make some barbequed chicken
and mashed potatoes," said Connor Lan

man 'l3, also a social chair at Sigma Chi,
and my date for the night. "We knew our
legendary chef could satisfy the hungry col
lege students."
After filling my plate and my mason jar,
I looked for a place to sit. The main living
room was beginning to fill, so I plopped my
self at the wooden table in the foyer of the
house. Across from me sat a cowgirl. An ar
madillo sat on my left and the county sher
iff sat on my right.
Unfamiliar with the guests there, I shyly
introduced myself to others.
"So, what do you think so far? Pretty
awesome, huh?" I said, trying to strike up
conversation.
"Special Dinners are awesome house
events!" said Alice Avery 'l2. "They bring a
fun, themed party atmosphere and especial
ly good food to what would be a typical din
ner, and are a great way for houses to bond."
"Special Dinners in general are without
question the most enjoyable social events
you'll find on campus," agreed Nick Men
doza 'l2.
The dinner table chatter was abruptly
interrupted by loud clacks of silverware
against plates. The clatter developed into a
roar as guests looked around confusedly. In
the midst of this pandemonium, the consul,
or president, rose.
"Welcome to Sigma Chi's Special Din
ner!" he bellowed. After a few minutes of
introductions, each of the brothers stood
one-by-one and introduced their dates.
I could feel myself growing nervous as
the line of introductions approached me.
Lanman told me to turn around, away from
the table, so that others could see me. My
face blushed, and I waited in anticipation of
how he would introduce me.
"Men, from Pasadena, California, I pres
ent to you the lovely Suz," Lanman said. I
smiled from ear to ear as the guys erupted
in a hail of "Suuuuzzz." I could not feel
more welcomed.

My glee continued throughout the
evening. As I finished up the rest of my
food, Lanman stood atop the table and an
nounced the ultimate surprise. This is what
he had been setting up all week. "In order
to make Special Dinner special, there has
to something unique about it," was all he
had told me.
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure
to present to you, the one, the only, mechan
ical bull!" Lanman shouted.
The doors burst open, and sitting on top of
the bull, holding on with all his might, was
A Flo TAor-lzor '1

Andre De Decker 13.
The night really picked up
at this point. Thi
mechanical bull
became a focal
point of the
party, prompting
a challenge of
who could stay
on the bull the
longest.
Men and
women mounted
the bull only to see how long
they could keep their
grasp. Students
flew through the
air and crashed
onto the boun- I
cy mat sur- 1
rounding the
bull. The rest of
the evening was
dominated by dancing,
bull riding and drinking
all in good humor.
"It went extremely well," Lanman said.
"It was ... one of the best parties I've ever
been to at Stanford. The only rule at the
party was to have fun, and everyone had a
great time."

It was a dreary evening last Wednes
day night, and life seemed to be set
tling down along the Row. Most stu
dents were settling down in their
rooms for a night of homework, but
as I walked into Sigma Chi, it was a differ
ent story. The party was just starting to pick
up at the fraternity's Special Dinner.
As I walked into the house, I was hit by
a wave of the Wild West. In line with the
theme, some students were fully adorned
with feather headdresses, war paint and
fake tomahawks, while others sauntered in
their chaps and blue jeans. Cowgirls sport
ed plaid and daisy dukes. There were even
rodeo girls, bucking bulls and armadillos.
Toy guns snapped to settle the masses.
To outside observers, this might seem
like a deviation from your normal campus
party. But at Stanford, Special Dinners
have become a hallmark social event.
Garrett Delgado 'l2, a social chair at
Sigma Chi, explained how the frat came up
with this Special Dinner's theme: Wild West
Wednesday.
"For themes you just need to find the
best combination a good set of drinks to
match the event, [something] fun to dress
up for and something people will get excit
ed about," Delgado said. "If you have those,
everything falls ... into place."
Having successfully escaped the cowboy
sprawls, I made my way across the sea of
plaid and war paint to grab my mason jar. I
bolted to the kitchen to help myself to the
food, and it was a heavenly sight. Shoulder
to shoulder with other hungry guests, I
made sure to grab a slab of barbequed
chicken, mashed potatoes and coleslaw.
"Since it was Wild West themed, we saw
it fit that we should get our cook Emese
Legeny to make some barbequed chicken
and mashed potatoes," said Connor Lan

man 'l3, also a social chair at Sigma Chi,
and my date for the night. "We knew our
legendary chef could satisfy the hungry col
lege students."
After filling my plate and my mason jar,
I looked for a place to sit. The main living
room was beginning to fill, so I plopped my
self at the wooden table in the foyer of the
house. Across from me sat a cowgirl. An ar
madillo sat on my left and the county sher
iff sat on my right.
Unfamiliar with the guests there, I shyly
introduced myself to others.
"So, what do you think so far? Pretty
awesome, huh?" I said, trying to strike up
conversation.
"Special Dinners are awesome house
events!" said Alice Avery 'l2. "They bring a
fun, themed party atmosphere and especial
ly good food to what would be a typical din
ner, and are a great way for houses to bond."
"Special Dinners in general are without
question the most enjoyable social events
you'll find on campus," agreed Nick Men
doza 'l2.
The dinner table chatter was abruptly
interrupted by loud clacks of silverware
against plates. The clatter developed into a
roar as guests looked around confusedly. In
the midst of this pandemonium, the consul,
or president, rose.
"Welcome to Sigma Chi's Special Din
ner!" he bellowed. After a few minutes of
introductions, each of the brothers stood
one-by-one and introduced their dates.
I could feel myself growing nervous as
the line of introductions approached me.
Lanman told me to turn around, away from
the table, so that others could see me. My
face blushed, and I waited in anticipation of
how he would introduce me.
"Men, from Pasadena, California, I pres
ent to you the lovely Suz," Lanman said. I
smiled from ear to ear as the guys erupted
in a hail of "Suuuuzzz." I could not feel
more welcomed.

My glee continued throughout the
evening. As I finished up the rest of my
food, Lanman stood atop the table and an
nounced the ultimate surprise. This is what
he had been setting up all week. "In order
to make Special Dinner special, there has
to something unique about it," was all he
had told me.
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure
to present to you, the one, the only, mechan
ical bull!" Lanman shouted.
The doors burst open, and sitting on top of
the bull, holding on with all his might, was
A Flo TAor-lzor '1

Andre De Decker 13.
The night really picked up
at this point. Thi
mechanical bull
became a focal
point of the
party, prompting
a challenge of
who could stay
on the bull the
longest.
Men and
women mounted
the bull only to see how long
they could keep their
grasp. Students
flew through the
air and crashed
onto the boun- I
cy mat sur- 1
rounding the
bull. The rest of
the evening was
dominated by dancing,
bull riding and drinking
all in good humor.
"It went extremely well," Lanman said.
"It was ... one of the best parties I've ever
been to at Stanford. The only rule at the
party was to have fun, and everyone had a
great time."
