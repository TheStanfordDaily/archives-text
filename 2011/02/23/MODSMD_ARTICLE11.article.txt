## EDITORIAL The 						Endowment Strikes Back â€“ Now Show Us the Money 
### 
Politics revolve around budg
ets: who decides who gets how
much, and when? It turns out
this question was pretty important
this week if you were a union work
er in Wisconsin or cared about the
survival of Planned Parenthood.
Judging by the lively dialogue on
campus about these two issues,
Stanford students consider state
and federal budget processes to be
as worthy of their attention as study
ing or complaining about the rain.
For all this interest in government
spending, however, there has been a
conspicuous lack of public objection
to Stanford's own budget priorities,
even though students often com
plain about their myriad effects.
Nevertheless, this editorial
board urges the Provost to reprior
itize the interests of current stu
dents by increasing budget alloca
tions to the offices of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion (VPUE) and the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs (VPSA).
These two departments house a
critical mass of the front-line staff
that meet with and work directly
for students on a daily basis. VPSA,
which oversees Vaden, the Regis
trar, Residential Educational, our
Educational Resource Centers,
and Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL), and VPUE, which in
cludes Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR), Bing Over
seas Studies Programs, the Center
for Teaching and Learning and all
Freshmen and Sophomore specific
programs, endured disproportion
ately heavy cuts when the endow
ment fell, and current students
have paid the price.
Take student advising, for exam
ple. Faced with the terrifying
knowledge that their choice of
classes and major will determine
the course of the rest of their lives,
incoming freshmen are told to con
sult with a pre-major advisor or
Academic Director. Flowever,
these advisors are ill-equipped to
help undeclared students navigate
tough, big-picture decisions. In
deed, survey data have shown that
when asked to name one aspect of
Stanford that most disappointed
them, most students cited the poor
quality of academic advising.
There's no easy answer to the
problem of advising, but one prom
ising solution was axed in 2009. Up
perclassmen may recall that they
used to enjoy the services of Head
Peer Academic Counselors,
staffers whose positions no longer
exist thanks to budget cuts. Rather
than making an appointment with
an advisor with only distant memo
ries of undergraduate life, students
used to be able to walk down the
hall and speak with a trained advi
sor who could relate personally to
academic concerns. That more stu
dents than ever are failing to de
clare a major by the end of their
sophomore year is just one sign

that advising has suffered since
VPSA was forced to cut HPACs.
While the launching of iDeclare
Week has lent a sense of urgency to
the problem, it ignores the underly
ing cause: the need for reinvest
ment in student advising.
Advising is not the only aspect of
student life that has suffered be
cause of cuts to VPSA. Scheduling
appointments at Vaden has be
come more difficult as they have
eliminated staff positions. As a re
sult, students have had to wait
longer to access professional men
tal health and wellness services,
even after the ASSU named men
tal health and wellness top student
priorities.
Cuts to VPUE have also posed a
threat to crucial programs: it may
alarm any student who has enjoyed
a Bing Trip overseas to know that if
BOSP budget officers had not been
able to lock in favorable currency
exchange rates during a brief dollar
rebound, the Bing program may
have suffered reductions in its of
ferings. However, cuts did force the
closure of the popular two-week
Overseas Seminars, to the dismay
of many students who could not
otherwise afford to study abroad
for a quarter.
Of course, when they cut funding
to VPUE and VPSA, the Universi
ty Budget Committee was in an un
enviable position. Stanford's en
dowment and annual donations
suffered significant losses. The ad
ministration even froze salaries. In
such an environment, budget cuts
were painful but understandable.
However, times have changed.
The university's financial fortunes
have improved dramatically within
the past fiscal year: the endowment
rose nearly 10 percent to approxi
mately $13.8 billion, while Stanford
led the world in fundraising, secur
ing nearly $6OO million in gifts. As a
result, the administration has ap
proved unrestricted allocations to a
litany of "high priority" budget
items, such as department endow
ment reserves, financial aid, en
dowment mitigation, a modest
salary increase program, covering
costs for new buildings opening this
year, and augmenting the Universi
ty reserve. Why have VPUE and
VPSA, which cut more than any
other departments when the en
dowment was down, been left off of
the list of budget priorities now that
we're back in the black?
The administration's preference
for long-term stability has consis
tently trumped the interests of cur
rent students. Surely, the adminis
tration's interest in long-term sta
bility is legitimate. However, the
lack of student input during the
budget process has led to an exces
sive gutting of programs and servic
es that benefit students now, even
as Stanford enjoys a rosier financial
position than virtually any univer
sity in the world. We deserve better.

Academic Director. Flowever,
these advisors are ill-equipped to
help undeclared students navigate
tough, big-picture decisions. In
deed, survey data have shown that
when asked to name one aspect of
Stanford that most disappointed
them, most students cited the poor
quality of academic advising.
There's no easy answer to the
problem of advising, but one prom
ising solution was axed in 2009. Up
perclassmen may recall that they
used to enjoy the services of Head
Peer Academic Counselors,
staffers whose positions no longer
exist thanks to budget cuts. Rather
than making an appointment with
an advisor with only distant memo
ries of undergraduate life, students
used to be able to walk down the
hall and speak with a trained advi
sor who could relate personally to
academic concerns. That more stu
dents than ever are failing to de
clare a major by the end of their
sophomore year is just one sign

that advising has suffered since
VPSA was forced to cut HPACs.
While the launching of iDeclare
Week has lent a sense of urgency to
the problem, it ignores the underly
ing cause: the need for reinvest
ment in student advising.
Advising is not the only aspect of
student life that has suffered be
cause of cuts to VPSA. Scheduling
appointments at Vaden has be
come more difficult as they have
eliminated staff positions. As a re
sult, students have had to wait
longer to access professional men
tal health and wellness services,
even after the ASSU named men
tal health and wellness top student
priorities.
Cuts to VPUE have also posed a
threat to crucial programs: it may
alarm any student who has enjoyed
a Bing Trip overseas to know that if
BOSP budget officers had not been
able to lock in favorable currency
exchange rates during a brief dollar
rebound, the Bing program may
have suffered reductions in its of
ferings. However, cuts did force the
closure of the popular two-week
Overseas Seminars, to the dismay
of many students who could not
otherwise afford to study abroad
for a quarter.
Of course, when they cut funding
to VPUE and VPSA, the Universi
ty Budget Committee was in an un
enviable position. Stanford's en
dowment and annual donations
suffered significant losses. The ad
ministration even froze salaries. In
such an environment, budget cuts
were painful but understandable.
However, times have changed.
The university's financial fortunes
have improved dramatically within
the past fiscal year: the endowment
rose nearly 10 percent to approxi
mately $13.8 billion, while Stanford
led the world in fundraising, secur
ing nearly $6OO million in gifts. As a
result, the administration has ap
proved unrestricted allocations to a
litany of "high priority" budget
items, such as department endow
ment reserves, financial aid, en
dowment mitigation, a modest
salary increase program, covering
costs for new buildings opening this
year, and augmenting the Universi
ty reserve. Why have VPUE and
VPSA, which cut more than any
other departments when the en
dowment was down, been left off of
the list of budget priorities now that
we're back in the black?
The administration's preference
for long-term stability has consis
tently trumped the interests of cur
rent students. Surely, the adminis
tration's interest in long-term sta
bility is legitimate. However, the
lack of student input during the
budget process has led to an exces
sive gutting of programs and servic
es that benefit students now, even
as Stanford enjoys a rosier financial
position than virtually any univer
sity in the world. We deserve better.

Politics revolve around budg
ets: who decides who gets how
much, and when? It turns out
this question was pretty important
this week if you were a union work
er in Wisconsin or cared about the
survival of Planned Parenthood.
Judging by the lively dialogue on
campus about these two issues,
Stanford students consider state
and federal budget processes to be
as worthy of their attention as study
ing or complaining about the rain.
For all this interest in government
spending, however, there has been a
conspicuous lack of public objection
to Stanford's own budget priorities,
even though students often com
plain about their myriad effects.
Nevertheless, this editorial
board urges the Provost to reprior
itize the interests of current stu
dents by increasing budget alloca
tions to the offices of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion (VPUE) and the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs (VPSA).
These two departments house a
critical mass of the front-line staff
that meet with and work directly
for students on a daily basis. VPSA,
which oversees Vaden, the Regis
trar, Residential Educational, our
Educational Resource Centers,
and Student Activities and Leader
ship (SAL), and VPUE, which in
cludes Undergraduate Advising
and Research (UAR), Bing Over
seas Studies Programs, the Center
for Teaching and Learning and all
Freshmen and Sophomore specific
programs, endured disproportion
ately heavy cuts when the endow
ment fell, and current students
have paid the price.
Take student advising, for exam
ple. Faced with the terrifying
knowledge that their choice of
classes and major will determine
the course of the rest of their lives,
incoming freshmen are told to con
sult with a pre-major advisor or
Academic Director. Flowever,
these advisors are ill-equipped to
help undeclared students navigate
tough, big-picture decisions. In
