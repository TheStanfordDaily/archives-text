# I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY PROFOUND
## Everyone Else's Lives Suck, Too 
### Robin Thomas 
Last Thursday The Harvard
Crimson published a letter,
written by an anonymous stu
dent, titled "I Am Fine." You can
read the whole article at
http://bit.ly/iamfine, but here's an
excerpt:
"I feel like I should remember the
first time I came close to committing
suicide, as if it's something along the
lines of a first kiss...
"You're not supposed to attend
Harvard and get depressed. You're
supposed to attend Harvard and
take advantages of opportunities...
I was the exception. I was the one
who was incapable of handling all
the wonderful opportunities that
Harvard presented me with ...
"The reality of the situation, how
ever, is that this is not the Harvard
that many students must wake up to
and battle every single day ... On a
campus where the need for assis
tance is too often perceived as a flaw,
the student body has a tendency to
rely on variations of'l'm fine: And,
at a college where so many students
already have far too much on their

plate, it's understandable that most
don't press the question further."
Wow. Sound familiar?
It does to all the elite university
students like you who have com
mented on and forwarded the let
ter, thanking the nameless author,
saying, "Holy cow, I thought I was
the only one feeling this way."
What a goofy society we've
made for ourselves. We've got all
these people walking around feel
ing lonely and depressed, thinking
they're the only ones feeling lonely
and depressed.
Let's take you for instance, dear
reader. What depression are you
smothering with a smile? What
problems and fears and struggles
have you been bottling up, thinking

you're the only one experiencing
them? What emotions have been
tearing at your heart, having no
other outlet, because you're so cer
tain that no one else could ever un
derstand how you're feeling?
Food for thought: there are few
things more self-centered than
thinking that you're alone in your
pain.
How egotistical, to think that
you're the one single person who
has problems like yours. How stuck
on yourself you must be, to think
that there isn't anyone around who
could possibly comprehend and re
late to your pain.
So you don't know what you'll
be doing when you graduate. So
you're failing a class, or have no clue
what your passion is. So you feel
lonely because you don't have a
girlfriend or boyfriend, or because
everyone else in your dorm likes to
drink and you don't. So you're wor
ried about money, or you have a ter
rible family life, or you feel so frus

trated and hopeless with your
screwed up self that your heart feels
like lead and you don't know how
to face another day.
Do you honestly think you're so
special that you're the only one
feeling that way?
There are a lot of really smart
and compassionate students at this
school; do you really have so little
respect for them that you won't
trust them not to negatively judge
you for your imperfections?
It's fine to hurt. But get over the
delusion that you're the only one
hurting.
Even among the absurdly afflu
ent and ambitious and seemingly
perfect students here, there is
someone who knows exactly what
you're going through. Odds are one
of those someones lives in your
dorm. And 100 percent of the peo
ple around you can relate to you in
that they also know what hurting
feels like. You don't need to go to
CAPS or the Bridge to find sup
port; just knock on your next-door
neighbor's door.

Because, see, everyone knows
what it means to feel broken, and
stuck and disconnected. That's be
cause everyone knows what it
means to be human. And like you,
everyone is desperate for re
minders that someone else is
human too. And with every smile
you keep plastered to your face,
and with every "I'm fine" with
which you lie, you're denying some
one else the relief that comes from
that reminder.
If you're afraid to tell someone
something, I think it's a pretty sure
sign that you should tell them.
There are few greater compliments
you can pay another person than
being completely emotionally hon
est with them. It tells them that you
trust them to not disrespect you, to
not think less of you, to not baby
you and try to take responsibility
for you.
When you trust someone to ac
cept you as the imperfect human
that you are, it's the sincerest way of
saying you accept them. In my
book, that's called love.

Nothing makes a columnist's week
like getting a message from a reader,
even when the reader completely dis
agrees. E-mail Robin at robthom

Food for thought: there are few
things more self-centered than
thinking that you're alone in your
pain.
How egotistical, to think that
you're the one single person who
has problems like yours. How stuck
on yourself you must be, to think
that there isn't anyone around who
could possibly comprehend and re
late to your pain.
So you don't know what you'll
be doing when you graduate. So
you're failing a class, or have no clue
what your passion is. So you feel
lonely because you don't have a
girlfriend or boyfriend, or because
everyone else in your dorm likes to
drink and you don't. So you're wor
ried about money, or you have a ter
rible family life, or you feel so frus

trated and hopeless with your
screwed up self that your heart feels
like lead and you don't know how
to face another day.
Do you honestly think you're so
special that you're the only one
feeling that way?
There are a lot of really smart
and compassionate students at this
school; do you really have so little
respect for them that you won't
trust them not to negatively judge
you for your imperfections?
It's fine to hurt. But get over the
delusion that you're the only one
hurting.
Even among the absurdly afflu
ent and ambitious and seemingly
perfect students here, there is
someone who knows exactly what
you're going through. Odds are one
of those someones lives in your
dorm. And 100 percent of the peo
ple around you can relate to you in
that they also know what hurting
feels like. You don't need to go to
CAPS or the Bridge to find sup
port; just knock on your next-door
neighbor's door.

Because, see, everyone knows
what it means to feel broken, and
stuck and disconnected. That's be
cause everyone knows what it
means to be human. And like you,
everyone is desperate for re
minders that someone else is
human too. And with every smile
you keep plastered to your face,
and with every "I'm fine" with
which you lie, you're denying some
one else the relief that comes from
that reminder.
If you're afraid to tell someone
something, I think it's a pretty sure
sign that you should tell them.
There are few greater compliments
you can pay another person than
being completely emotionally hon
est with them. It tells them that you
trust them to not disrespect you, to
not think less of you, to not baby
you and try to take responsibility
for you.
When you trust someone to ac
cept you as the imperfect human
that you are, it's the sincerest way of
saying you accept them. In my
book, that's called love.
