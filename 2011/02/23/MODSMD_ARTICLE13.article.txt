# I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY PROFOUND
## Everyone Else's Lives Suck, Too 
### Robin Thomas 
Last Thursday The Harvard
Crimson published a letter,
written by an anonymous stu
dent, titled "I Am Fine." You can
read the whole article at
http://bit.ly/iamfine, but here's an
excerpt:
"I feel like I should remember the
first time I came close to committing
suicide, as if it's something along the
lines of a first kiss...
"You're not supposed to attend
Harvard and get depressed. You're
supposed to attend Harvard and
take advantages of opportunities...
I was the exception. I was the one
who was incapable of handling all
the wonderful opportunities that
Harvard presented me with ...
"The reality of the situation, how
ever, is that this is not the Harvard
that many students must wake up to
and battle every single day ... On a
campus where the need for assis
tance is too often perceived as a flaw,
the student body has a tendency to
rely on variations of'l'm fine: And,
at a college where so many students
already have far too much on their

plate, it's understandable that most
don't press the question further."
Wow. Sound familiar?
It does to all the elite university
students like you who have com
mented on and forwarded the let
ter, thanking the nameless author,
saying, "Holy cow, I thought I was
the only one feeling this way."
What a goofy society we've
made for ourselves. We've got all
these people walking around feel
ing lonely and depressed, thinking
they're the only ones feeling lonely
and depressed.
Let's take you for instance, dear
reader. What depression are you
smothering with a smile? What
problems and fears and struggles
have you been bottling up, thinking

you're the only one experiencing
them? What emotions have been
tearing at your heart, having no
other outlet, because you're so cer
tain that no one else could ever un
derstand how you're feeling?
Food for thought: there are few
things more self-centered than
thinking that you're alone in your
pain.
How egotistical, to think that
you're the one single person who
has problems like yours. How stuck
on yourself you must be, to think
that there isn't anyone around who
could possibly comprehend and re
late to your pain.
So you don't know what you'll
be doing when you graduate. So
you're failing a class, or have no clue
what your passion is. So you feel
lonely because you don't have a
girlfriend or boyfriend, or because
everyone else in your dorm likes to
drink and you don't. So you're wor
ried about money, or you have a ter
rible family life, or you feel so frus
