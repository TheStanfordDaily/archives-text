# REALITY CHECK
## Being ____ at Stanford, Part One 
### Alex Hicks-Nelson 
Rummaging through my
inbox, it occurs to me that
most of the mailing lists I'm
on don't provide me with exceed
ingly valuable e-mail. People asking
for baking supplies, informing simi
larly interested people about
events, guilt-tripping others into at
tending talks, guarantees of food to
lure underclassmen out of their
dorms. All pretty standard. But one
e-mail caught my attention, or
rather, bit my retinas and refused to
let go. "You don't understand what
I go through being ... BLACK AT
STANFORD" it asserted. I mulled
over the subject and punchline. I
put it in my "Interesting" folder.
"Being Black at Stanford" looks
to be a collection of interviews with

various people around campus, in
the spirit of CNN's "Black in Amer
ica." Its self-proclaimed goal is to
"display the perspectives and expe
riences of the Black Community at
Stanford" and "not only promote
further understanding of Black ex
periences, but also foster conversa
tion regarding diversity on cam
pus." The poster includes several
melanin-rich faces in front of the
Stanford "S," looking in pixilated
splendor off to the left.
I'm not even sure how to re
spond to the prompt "what's it like
to be black at Stanford." Honestly, I
haven't been anything else at Stan
ford, so I don't have much to com
pare it to. It's strange to think that
being a certain color here is some

how radically different from being
that color out in the real world. Why
can't I see Stanford from the point
of view of another race? I can see
the world from several different
races' perspectives. Most likely it's
the issue of time. I don't necessarily
have enough exposure to any indi
vidual aspect of life here for very
long, so I don't brood over what
could possibly go differently. Class
es end, roommates change and I
rarely, if ever, see the same person
twice in a day.
Really, one of the only constants
throughout my time here at Stan
ford, as a black person, has been the
black mailing list. A separate entity
from the black community (though
you'd never know this from reading

some of the threads posted to it),
the Diaspora was my fate upon
choosing to attend this school. It's
usually a very productive list. I get
kept up to date on opportunities
from the Society of Black Scientists
and Engineers, see what the black
pre-meds are up to, get another
venue for buying/selling textbooks
and receive invitations to top-notch
discussions on topics pertaining to
the black community on campus
and abroad.
And sometimes, it's not so pro
ductive. I've traipsed across conver
sations about whether or not we as
a community should stick up for
Michael Vick, how to make sure
Antoine Dodson costumes are per
ceived correctly on campus, why

selling chocolate vaginas to raise
money is racist. Now, I'm not saying
that opinions can be wrong, but it is
frustrating to have so useful a forum
exploited for vehement, small-scale
issues that make little to no sense.
Maybe it's just the nature of the
beast: you see a couple people wear
ing bandanas and waving rolled up
pieces of paper on campus, you
jump to making generalizations
about the state of your race in the
world. Stanfordians are very fond of
extrapolating events into the larger
concepts they stem from, a knack
that improves papers but sets up sit

uations where people are actively
looking to apply large-scale an
swers to small-scale problems.
This willingness of people to
identify transgressions wouldn't be
an issue if there were counterpoints
and other mediatory methods in
place to ensure that people don't
just run willy-nilly around, trying to
apply last night's reading to every
thing indiscriminately. Sadly, the
Diaspora is what its members make
of it, and the thread about Michael
Vick won't get any new angles in it
until someone throws some in
there. In many ways, being black

and on the Diaspora is a constant
game of checking to make sure you
aren't being lumped into an opin
ion you don't agree with. Silence
can be consent. I can't, however,
watch the list 24/7. There are times
when I can't respond to anything
for days, and can only impotently
hope that someone out there has
my opinion and the spare energy to
do our views justice with a post. At
times, I wish the Diaspora were
connected to other such mailing
lists around the country, such that
the Stanford bubble didn't section
people off from reality along racial
lines as well. A moderator wouldn't
be half bad either.

Have a chatlist that represents you?
Vent to Alex about it at ahicksne
