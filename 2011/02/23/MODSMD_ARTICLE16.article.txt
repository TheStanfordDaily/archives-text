## WAVES PARTED 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Two nights after getting swept
on the road against No. 1 USC, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
didn't let a dangerous Pepperdine
team take advantage of its home
court in a 25-14, 25-18, 25-19 dis
mantling of the No. 9 Waves on the
road that coach John Kosty said
might have been the Cardinal's
best match of the year.

No. 5 Stanford (10-4,7-4 MPSF)
rode a balanced offensive attack to
the victory, with four players regis
tering at least six kills. Senior out
side hitter Spencer McLachlin had
a game-high 10 kills on just 15 at
tacks for an outstanding .600 hit
ting percentage. Junior outside hit
ter Brad Lawson also had nine kills
on 14 attacks, and junior middle
blocker Gus Ellis had eight kills on
14 attacks.The trio combined for 27
of Stanford's 37 kills and hit .512
collectively.
In all, the Cardinal made quick
work of a Pepperdine team that
was coming off a five-set upset of

USC last week Saturday's
match took just one hour and 12
minutes to complete.
Despite its offensive success, it
was defense that enabled the Card
to dominate the match. Ellis had
six blocks as part of a motivated
blocking effort from the team. The
Cardinal out-blocked the Waves,
10-4.5, fresh off a game against
USC in which the Trojans general
ly had their way at the net and out
blocked Stanford, 8.5-1.
"The coaching staff went to
great lengths to break down Pep
perdine's offensive scheme which
allowed [freshman Eric] Mochals
ki and me to anticipate the setter's
tendencies and put up big blocks,"
Ellis said. "The team did such a
great job serving our opponent ag
gressively, that Pepperdine's setter
was forced to slow down the of
fense, making it much easier to
block."
Controlling the net really paid
off, as Pepperdine (5-6,3-6) hit just
.139, the lowest opponent hitting
percentage for Stanford thus far in
MPSF play. It also helped that
Stanford hit .492 as a team, its high
est mark on the year.
Early on, it looked like Pepper
dine might make a real game of it,
holding an early lead in the first set
and staying tight with the Cardinal

midway through the match. But
Stanford put together a string of
runs led by the attack of McLachlin
and Lawson and the blocking of
Ellis to pull away and take the first
set going away, 25-14.
Game two was nearly identical
to the first game, with Pepperdine
hanging tight until about midway
through, when attack errors took
their toll on the Waves.
Game three was a bit of a differ
ent story, as Pepperdine finally
fought back and got the crowd into
the match. But with the score at 13-
10, senior captain Jordan Inafuku
really stepped up and helped Stan
ford seize control from the service
line with two service aces. The re
serve libero came in as a serving
specialist throughout the night and

had nine serves without a service
error, including the two consecu
tive aces in set three.
The road win broke a remark
able cold streak against Pepper
dine. Stanford had not won in Mal
ibu since 1997, a stretch of 13 con
secutive road losses to the Waves.
Halfway into the season, the
MPSF race is shaping up to be as
tight as ever, with Stanford now sit
ting in fourth place, two games be
hind conference-leading USC.
There are plenty of opportunities
to move up, with 11 conference
games remaining before the MPSF
Tournament at the end of April.
"The MPSF is once again good
from top to bottom, and every
weekend means we face two quali
ty opponents," Kosty said. "The
conference will be a fight just to get
into the playoffs and once you get
there it is all about winning five in a
row. Just like last year it will come
down to the last weekend."
The Cardinal also gets to host
two of the teams (No. 3 Long
Beach State and USC) currently
ahead of it in the standings. First,
though, Stanford will take on No. 7
UCLA Friday at 7 p.m. at Maples
Pavilion.

Gus Ellis, center, led the Cardinal with six blocks in the win over No. 9 Pepperdine. The fifth-ranked Cardinal bounced back from a three-set loss to
USC by dismantling the Waves in straight sets. Coach John Kosty said the win may have been Stanford's most complete performance of the season.
