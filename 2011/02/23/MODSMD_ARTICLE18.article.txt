### â€“ Nate Adams 
If Cal baseball won't be returning to
action next year, Stanford baseball set
the tone in the rivalry's final year of
competition last night with a 3-2 win in
its home opener. Junior pitcher Jordan
Pries got the win for the No. 8 Cardinal
(3-1), striking out four batters over
four scoreless innings in his 2011
debut. Sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger went 2-for-4 at the plate
and knocked in two runs as Stanford
edged the No. 17 Golden Bears (2-1).

second baseman Lonnie Kauppila
kick-started a rally with a stand-up
double. The Cardinal scored two runs
in the inning, but the outburst was sti

Jake Stewart grounded into a bases
loaded, 4-6-3 double play.

was making his collegiate debut. The
right-hander got into trouble early, get
ting behind in counts and allowing two
runs on a bases-loaded walk and a sac
rifice fly. He settled down afterwards,
tossing two scoreless frames.
Junior pitcher Scott Snodgress got
the call in the eighth, getting out of
trouble twice en route to his first save
of the season. The lefty walked three
and allowed one hit, making the most
