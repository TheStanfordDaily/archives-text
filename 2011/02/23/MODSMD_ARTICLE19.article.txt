# It's time for FIFA to protest

As pro-democracy
protests continue to
rock the Middle East,
sporting events
across the region are
being affected. Most prominently,
Formula One's season opener, the
Bahrain Grand Prix, was canceled,
with thousands of protestors occu
pying the central square in the capi
tal, Manama.
F1 officials cited security con
cerns in choosing to cancel the
Bahrain event, but have left open
the possibility of rescheduling the
grand prix for later in the season,
when and if things quiet down. In
smaller news, FIFA and the African
football federation, CAF, have
rescheduled matches slated for
North Africa, especially in Egypt
and Tunisia.

with the protestors' aims.
Before I go further into explain

stantly strive to be de-politicized,
and have to stay away from politics
at all times. Sure, international
sports federations should try to be
impartial and not meddle in politics
most of the time, but sometimes, ex
traordinary circumstances warrant
intervention.
We also cannot ignore the politi
cal implications of sports, and the
fact that they are often used to make
political statements. The reason the
F1 race in Bahrain was canceled was
because the protestors explicitly tar
geted it. China made a political
statement with the 2008 Olympics in
Beijing; Brazil will make a state
ment with the 2014 World Cup and
2016 Olympics; and (more nefari
