# It's time for FIFA to protest
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
As pro-democracy
protests continue to
rock the Middle East,
sporting events
across the region are
being affected. Most prominently,
Formula One's season opener, the
Bahrain Grand Prix, was canceled,
with thousands of protestors occu
pying the central square in the capi
tal, Manama.
F1 officials cited security con
cerns in choosing to cancel the
Bahrain event, but have left open
the possibility of rescheduling the
grand prix for later in the season,
when and if things quiet down. In
smaller news, FIFA and the African
football federation, CAF, have
rescheduled matches slated for
North Africa, especially in Egypt
and Tunisia.
As my colleague Tom Taylor
opined last week, the events in the
Middle East engender questions of
how well these countries can pull off
global sporting events, like an F1
race or the FIFA World Cup (which
is headed to Qatar in 2022). Howev
er, I think FIFA, Formula One and
other global sporting entities should
seize the opportunity to use the
power of their sports and make an
unequivocal statement in support of
democracy, aligning themselves
with the protestors' aims.
Before I go further into explain
ing this position, I must rebuke the
argument that sports have to con
stantly strive to be de-politicized,
and have to stay away from politics
at all times. Sure, international
sports federations should try to be
impartial and not meddle in politics
most of the time, but sometimes, ex
traordinary circumstances warrant
intervention.
We also cannot ignore the politi
cal implications of sports, and the
fact that they are often used to make
political statements. The reason the
F1 race in Bahrain was canceled was
because the protestors explicitly tar
geted it. China made a political
statement with the 2008 Olympics in
Beijing; Brazil will make a state
ment with the 2014 World Cup and
2016 Olympics; and (more nefari

ously) Hitler attempted to demon
strate Aryan superiority at the 1936
Berlin Olympics, but was embar
rassed by Jesse Owens' victories.
Sporting federations themselves
have also made statements in the
past, most famously by excluding
South Africa from most interna
tional competitions during the
apartheid era.
The main organization that can
have an impact is FIFA. Soccer is
undoubtedly the global game, and
the World Cup is the world's most
watched sporting event (no, it's not
the Super Bowl). The organization
has also gotten a lot of criticism late
ly from the sporting press for
awarding the next two World Cups
to authoritarian regimes, so now
would be a good time to burnish its
credentials by joining Middle East
ern protestors in demanding a rep
resentative form of government.
Part of the reason that FIFA can
and should make this statement is
that it is basically untouchable. No
national soccer federation will ever
withdraw from it to do so would
shut a country out completely from
international competition. People
aren't going to stop playing soccer
anytime soon, either. Even national
governments don't have this kind of
power, but instead of using it, FIFA
is simply failing to comment on the
situation. Of course, FIFA has been
happy to cash checks from authori
tarian governments before, and is
keeping out of the fray to ensure the

continued flow of money.
Formula One, the global auto rac
ing circuit, is also failing to take ad
vantage of its chance to push real
democratic change. At a minimum,
F1 could have canceled the Bahrain
Grand Prix unequivocally for this
season, as a token of support for the
protestors; instead, it has left open
the possibility of the event returning
to the country once it stabilizes.
Throughout the whole affair, Formu
la One has treated the deaths of pro
testors and the actions of the govern
ment as a large inconvenience, pub
licly bemoaning the financial hit it
will take from having to start its sea
son a couple weeks later.
Not supporting democracy is
one thing, but F1 is showing con
tempt for the basic human right to
not get shot by your government, all
in the interest of making a quick
buck.
Come on, guys. That's just cold.
