## Negative reviews sell books Study finds that bad reviews lead to better new book sales 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
For lesser-known or new authors,
bad publicity may actually be good
news. According to a recent study co
authored by Stanford Graduate
School of Business professor Alan
Sorenson and Wharton Business
School professor Jonah Berger, B.A.
'O2, Ph.D. 'O7, bad reviews can dra
matically boost sales.
Earlier studies showed how pub
licity through product reviews can
affect sales. The researchers found
out that giving books bad reviews
could lead customers to assume the
book was bad, thereby significantly
reducing sales. However, because
negative information usually cuts
down the number of product re
views, consumer opinions alone can
not explain why bad publicity may
actually increase product sales.
"Any publicity is not always good
publicity, as the old adage goes,"
Berger wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "But there were also cases
where even negative publicity
seemed to help sales, so it was inter
esting to think about when it helps
versus hurts."
The overall study consisted of

three mini-studies. The first study in
volved the examination of a 2001-
2003 dataset of weekly national sales
for 244 fiction titles reviewed by The
New York Times. By measuring the
size of sale spikes in the week follow
ing the release of each book review,
the study showed two main points:
positive publicity benefited all titles
and the bad publicity only helped
lesser-known and obscure authors.
According to GSB professor
Baba Shiv, familiarity with a product
plays a crucial role when a consumer
makes decision.

"The more familiar something is,
the bigger a chance it will be incor
porated into the [customer's] deci
sion," Shiv said.
The familiarity has an impact on
all brands and products. Bad public
ity, while damaging to well-known
products, provides lesser-known
products with more consumer expo
sure. These two processes often
work against one another behind the
scenes during the decision-making
process.
"Familiarity, by itself, is a positive
emotion," Shiv said. "On the other
hand, you'll have negative emotion
associated with bad publicity."
"Let's say you've got bad publici
ty or bad press on one of your new
brands," Shiv said. "On one hand, it's
making your brand look familiar,

which is associated with positive
emotion and at the same time, it's
eliciting negative emotion towards
the brand, which comes from the
bad publicity."
Whichever wins out in the con
sumer's mind depends on the "decay
rates" of these two emotions, a phe
nomenon that the second study in
vestigated. The decay rate is the rate
at which the impact of an emotion,
positive or negative, disappears.
The second study looked at the ef
fects bad publicity had in well-known
and obscure books over time. Some
subjects looked at glowing and nega
tive reviews for a well-known book
by John Grisham and reviews for an
obscure, made-up title.
Subjects who read negative re
views of well-known books were less

likely to buy the book. Negative re
views of unknown books, however,
did not affect whether or not the
subject was likely to purchase it.
"What is going on here," Shiv
said, "is that the positive emotion is
coming from familiarity, which is a
much stronger positive emotion,
while the negative emotion is al
ready gone."
"In the case of a well-known
brand, the familiarity is already
there," he said.
Shiv explained that "the decay
rate of negative emotion will be
much slower" for these brands,
whereas negative publicity "gener
ates much more negative feelings."
