## Stanford overcomes Ishino injury for win 
### BROOKE DAVIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the No. 2 Stanford women's
gymnastics team defeated No. 24
Arizona 195.300 to 194.675 last Fri
day, the Card lost its most dominat
ing competitor, fifth-year senior,
Allyse Ishino, to an ankle injury.
The Cardinal beat the Wildcats in
every event, save for Ishino's injury
during her floor routine.

Ishino's injury is expected
to keep her off of the mats for three
to five weeks, but her ankle will
most likely be strong enough by the
NCAA Championships in mid-
April. Before rolling her ankle, Ishi
no earned a three-way tie for first
on the bars with two of her Stanford
teammates, junior Nicole Pechanec
and freshman Kristina Vaculik, who
both matched her score of 9.850.
As a result of Ishino's injury,
Stanford's floor score waned signif
icantly, as she earned a 6.000, unable
to finish her routine. Even so, Ari
zona's 49.000 did not prove suffi
cient enough to overtake the Cardi
nal in the end, and Stanford edged
the Wildcats for victory.
Stanford's 195.300 score was ac
tually the Card's lowest team score
all season, but that doesn't mean
Stanford didn't take anything away
from the competition. Stanford
competitors took first place in every
single event.
On the vault, senior Shelley
Alexander, junior Alyssa Brown
and sophomore Nicole Dayton tied
for first, each with a score of 9.850.
Yet another three-way tie occurred
on the bars with Ishino's,
Pechanec's and Vaculik's victories.
In the rest of the events, each Stan
ford victor stood solo.
Junior Alyssa Brown placed first
on the beam with a score of 9.825,
sophomore Ashley Morgan fin
ished first on floor with a score of
9.875 and the all-around victory
went to Alexander, who earned a
combined score of 39.150.
Even though the string of 9.900
scores from last week's meet at the
Chicago Style, against Michigan and

Nebraska, came to an end, Stanford
still managed to stay strong and un
defeated. Several Cardinal competi
tors matched their season-high
scores in various events.
Senior Danielle Ikoma scored a
9.800 on floor, a score she hasn't ob
tained since the Pac-10 Showcase,
where Stanford placed first. Simi
larly, Dayton also matched her sea
son-high score of 9.850. On the
vault, her season high of 9.850 is
also her career high, a score Dayton
actually also received at the Chica
go Style meet.
With yet another 9.850, Vaculik
matched both her season and ca

reer-high scores on the bars. Her
only other 9.850 on the bars was
also earned at the Chicago Style
meet on Feb. 11. Only a freshman,
Vaculik is an example of the all
around talent on the Cardinal
squad, ranging all over each of the
four classes.
Stanford has now beaten Ari
zona in 11 of the last 13 matchups.
This coming Sunday, Stanford is
scheduled to compete against Ari
zona State on Stanford's Senior
Day at Maples Pavilion at 2 p.m.
