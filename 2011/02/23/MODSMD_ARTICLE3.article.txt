# East Asia Library seeks move
## GSB explored as possible option for book relocation 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
Initial plans to demolish Meyer Library by
2012 may be postponed for up to three more
years. The University is exploring the possibility
of moving the contents of the library into the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) South
Building in the meantime.
This announcement came during a joint
presentation given by John Bender, chair of the
Committee on Libraries (C-LIB), and Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
In the fall of 2007, Meyer was deemed "seis
mically unsafe" in a campus-wide seismic retro
fit study. The study found that the library would
most likely be an unsafe environment in the
case of an earthquake.
According to Andrew Herkovic, director of

communications and development at the Uni
versity Librarian's Office, seismic concerns
about Meyer Library were inherent in its shape
and design. The University faced the choice of
either razing or retrofitting the building. After
completing a cost calculation, officials quickly
ruled out the latter option.
"It was considered and rejected on the basis
that it would cost more than it was worth,"
Herkovic said.
With Meyer's demolition now scheduled for
2015, the University began to consider what
ought to happen to the library's contents. Meyer
currently houses academic computing services,
library internal technical services and the East
Asia Library.
Preliminary plans were drafted in 2007 to
construct another library slightly south of the
current site, close to the Law School. However,
the planned library was smaller in scale and only

had the capacity to house the academic comput
er service function of Meyer. It did not make
room for the East Asia Library, whose books
were to be stored at the Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary 111 (SAL 3), an off-campus library in Liv
ermore, under this plan.
Bender said the East Asia collection, which is
the fastest growing collection at Stanford, works
in Meyer, and includes many manuscripts that
are "not easily digitalized."
"There have been very strong feelings from
our faculty in those areas," Bender said.
"It was important to keep these manuscripts
on campus to those who study "languages in
non-Roman characters," he added.
This sentiment made SAL 3 storage a less at
tractive option. As a result, the Academic Coun
cil Committee on Libraries convened a subcom-
mittee, headed by Michael Marri
nan, professor of art and art history,
in January of 2008 to look into what
effect that Meyer's demolition
would have on the accessibility of
printed materials.
A second subcommittee, chaired
by Matthew Sommer, professor of
history, was formed shortly after the
Marrinan subcommittee presented
its report to Faculty Senate in 2009.
The Sommer subcommittee, as it
was henceforth called, was tasked
with investigating the libraries issue
more deeply.
Bender said two main findings
came from these committees. First
and foremost, it was concluded that
there should be a "new building
centered on the East Asia Library."
Secondly, it was agreed that approx
imately the same number of books
should remain on campus.

A new possibility emerged when
the Business School announced its
move to the new Knight Manage
ment Building, thereby leaving
GSB South vacated.
Bender said that GSB South
would be a "great fit for the East
Asia Library."
"The old Jackson Library is a
beautiful piece of work space,"
Bender said. "It's something we
might even imagine a donor being
attracted to."
"You might not love it from the
outside," he added, "but it's actually
a very nice space inside. It has a lot
of character and a lot of interesting
spaces that could be used in good
ways by the libraries."
But the University must address
several complications before GSB
South can become the new home to
the East Asia Library.
According to a C-LIB report,
some of these challenges include
GSB South's "distance from the
central traffic corridor used by stu
dents," its limited number of eleva
tors and its lack of a loading dock.

Another critical factor is the antici
pated loss of central campus stack
space resulting from the move.
The C-LIB report also enumer
ated possible benefits. For instance,
the Registrar could utilize some of
the "existing classroom space on
the site" and the University could
open "a food service operation, to
better serve students who will use
the new facilities 24/7."
Herkovic said the University re
mains hopeful that the move will be
successful.
"We are optimistic that GSB
South would be a great home for
these operations," Herkovic said.
"We really want this to happen and
we really don't know of an alterna
tive. We are putting a lot of energy
into making sure that this is a suc
cess if the money and the approval
all work out."
Last year, an outside consultant
was hired to study the fit of the GSB
South Building. The study exam
ined whether the building could ac
commodate operations currently
held at Meyer Library.

Now, the University is conduct
ing a cost-benefit study. Herkovic
estimated that the cost study would
be completed by early summer.
"It won't be a simple figure,"
Herkovic said. "It will be some
complex menu of options to retro
fitting the building."
Herkovic said the University
would make a final recommenda
tion concerning the project and
then seek approval from the Board
of Trustees. If approved, GSB South
wouldn't be ready for occupancy
until 2013. It would take another
two years to finalize the transfer of
materials and personnel from
Meyer to the GSB South.
Etchemendy said that $1 million
has been spent to study the move so
far. He estimated that the move
from Meyer to GSB South would
cost approximately $5O million.
"We want to make sure we find
the right location for the East Asia
Library," he said.

"There have been very strong feelings from
our faculty in those areas," Bender said.
"It was important to keep these manuscripts
on campus to those who study "languages in
non-Roman characters," he added.
This sentiment made SAL 3 storage a less at
tractive option. As a result, the Academic Coun
cil Committee on Libraries convened a subcom-
mittee, headed by Michael Marri
nan, professor of art and art history,
in January of 2008 to look into what
effect that Meyer's demolition
would have on the accessibility of
printed materials.
A second subcommittee, chaired
by Matthew Sommer, professor of
history, was formed shortly after the
Marrinan subcommittee presented
its report to Faculty Senate in 2009.
The Sommer subcommittee, as it
was henceforth called, was tasked
with investigating the libraries issue
more deeply.
Bender said two main findings
came from these committees. First
and foremost, it was concluded that
there should be a "new building
centered on the East Asia Library."
Secondly, it was agreed that approx
imately the same number of books
should remain on campus.

A new possibility emerged when
the Business School announced its
move to the new Knight Manage
ment Building, thereby leaving
GSB South vacated.
Bender said that GSB South
would be a "great fit for the East
Asia Library."
"The old Jackson Library is a
beautiful piece of work space,"
Bender said. "It's something we
might even imagine a donor being
attracted to."
"You might not love it from the
outside," he added, "but it's actually
a very nice space inside. It has a lot
of character and a lot of interesting
spaces that could be used in good
ways by the libraries."
But the University must address
several complications before GSB
South can become the new home to
the East Asia Library.
According to a C-LIB report,
some of these challenges include
GSB South's "distance from the
central traffic corridor used by stu
dents," its limited number of eleva
tors and its lack of a loading dock.

Another critical factor is the antici
pated loss of central campus stack
space resulting from the move.
The C-LIB report also enumer
ated possible benefits. For instance,
the Registrar could utilize some of
the "existing classroom space on
the site" and the University could
open "a food service operation, to
better serve students who will use
the new facilities 24/7."
Herkovic said the University re
mains hopeful that the move will be
successful.
"We are optimistic that GSB
South would be a great home for
these operations," Herkovic said.
"We really want this to happen and
we really don't know of an alterna
tive. We are putting a lot of energy
into making sure that this is a suc
cess if the money and the approval
all work out."
Last year, an outside consultant
was hired to study the fit of the GSB
South Building. The study exam
ined whether the building could ac
commodate operations currently
held at Meyer Library.

Now, the University is conduct
ing a cost-benefit study. Herkovic
estimated that the cost study would
be completed by early summer.
"It won't be a simple figure,"
Herkovic said. "It will be some
complex menu of options to retro
fitting the building."
Herkovic said the University
would make a final recommenda
tion concerning the project and
then seek approval from the Board
of Trustees. If approved, GSB South
wouldn't be ready for occupancy
until 2013. It would take another
two years to finalize the transfer of
materials and personnel from
Meyer to the GSB South.
Etchemendy said that $1 million
has been spent to study the move so
far. He estimated that the move
from Meyer to GSB South would
cost approximately $5O million.
"We want to make sure we find
the right location for the East Asia
Library," he said.

Initial plans to demolish Meyer Library by
2012 may be postponed for up to three more
years. The University is exploring the possibility
of moving the contents of the library into the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) South
Building in the meantime.
This announcement came during a joint
presentation given by John Bender, chair of the
Committee on Libraries (C-LIB), and Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
In the fall of 2007, Meyer was deemed "seis
mically unsafe" in a campus-wide seismic retro
fit study. The study found that the library would
most likely be an unsafe environment in the
case of an earthquake.
According to Andrew Herkovic, director of

communications and development at the Uni
versity Librarian's Office, seismic concerns
about Meyer Library were inherent in its shape
and design. The University faced the choice of
either razing or retrofitting the building. After
completing a cost calculation, officials quickly
ruled out the latter option.
"It was considered and rejected on the basis
that it would cost more than it was worth,"
Herkovic said.
With Meyer's demolition now scheduled for
2015, the University began to consider what
ought to happen to the library's contents. Meyer
currently houses academic computing services,
library internal technical services and the East
Asia Library.
Preliminary plans were drafted in 2007 to
construct another library slightly south of the
current site, close to the Law School. However,
the planned library was smaller in scale and only

had the capacity to house the academic comput
er service function of Meyer. It did not make
room for the East Asia Library, whose books
were to be stored at the Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary 111 (SAL 3), an off-campus library in Liv
ermore, under this plan.
Bender said the East Asia collection, which is
the fastest growing collection at Stanford, works
in Meyer, and includes many manuscripts that
are "not easily digitalized."
"There have been very strong feelings from
our faculty in those areas," Bender said.
"It was important to keep these manuscripts
on campus to those who study "languages in
non-Roman characters," he added.
This sentiment made SAL 3 storage a less at
tractive option. As a result, the Academic Coun
cil Committee on Libraries convened a subcom-
mittee, headed by Michael Marri
nan, professor of art and art history,
