# East Asia Library seeks move
## GSB explored as possible option for book relocation

Initial plans to demolish Meyer Library by
2012 may be postponed for up to three more
years. The University is exploring the possibility
of moving the contents of the library into the
Graduate School of Business (GSB) South
Building in the meantime.
This announcement came during a joint
presentation given by John Bender, chair of the
Committee on Libraries (C-LIB), and Universi
ty Librarian Michael Keller at last Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
In the fall of 2007, Meyer was deemed "seis
mically unsafe" in a campus-wide seismic retro
fit study. The study found that the library would
most likely be an unsafe environment in the
case of an earthquake.
According to Andrew Herkovic, director of

communications and development at the Uni
versity Librarian's Office, seismic concerns
about Meyer Library were inherent in its shape
and design. The University faced the choice of
either razing or retrofitting the building. After
completing a cost calculation, officials quickly
ruled out the latter option.
"It was considered and rejected on the basis
that it would cost more than it was worth,"
Herkovic said.
With Meyer's demolition now scheduled for
2015, the University began to consider what
ought to happen to the library's contents. Meyer
currently houses academic computing services,
library internal technical services and the East
Asia Library.
Preliminary plans were drafted in 2007 to
construct another library slightly south of the
current site, close to the Law School. However,
the planned library was smaller in scale and only

had the capacity to house the academic comput
er service function of Meyer. It did not make
room for the East Asia Library, whose books
were to be stored at the Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary 111 (SAL 3), an off-campus library in Liv
ermore, under this plan.
Bender said the East Asia collection, which is
the fastest growing collection at Stanford, works
in Meyer, and includes many manuscripts that
are "not easily digitalized."
"There have been very strong feelings from
our faculty in those areas," Bender said.
"It was important to keep these manuscripts
on campus to those who study "languages in
non-Roman characters," he added.
This sentiment made SAL 3 storage a less at
tractive option. As a result, the Academic Coun
cil Committee on Libraries convened a subcom-
