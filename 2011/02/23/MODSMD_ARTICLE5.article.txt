## Senate passes three bills, discusses special fees 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate
Senate passed three bills Tues
day and discussed special fees.
One bill instated Neveen
Mahmoud 'll, the current serv
ice chair in the executive cabi
net, as the next Stanford Stu

dent Enterprises (SSE) finan
cial manager. Mahmoud de
scribed herself as a "big vision
person" and stressed her famil
iarity with SSE's objectives.
The other two bills, authored
by Rebecca Sachs 'l3, clarified
the rule governing the an
nouncement of official meet
ings 72 hours before their start

time and granted senators up to
two excused absences per quar
ter, in addition to the already
allotted two unexcused ab
sences from Senate meetings.
If a senator has three unex
cused absences, it may be
grounds for expulsion. Previous
ly, there was no guideline for ex
cused absences. Under Sachs'

bill, the Senate will follow Uni
versity staff policy.
Special fees updates
The Appropriations Commit
tee's update turned into a
lengthy discussion of special
fees, particularly the Stanford
Flipside's budget proposal, which
included a Segway for distribution.
The senators questioned
whether the proposal was serious
and discussed its potential ramifi
cations.
Some entertained the idea that
the Flipside may be trying to
make a statement about problems
in the special fees policy, particu
larly whether or not students take
the time to look at group budgets.
"I personally don't believe
that students take the time to
look at budgets," said Appropria
tions Committee Chair Rafael
Vazquez 'l2.
"Whether it's a joke or not, if
we pass it, they will have a Seg
way," newly appointed Senate
Chair Madeline Hawes 'l3 said.
"If the Segway does pass, then
I think there's a flaw in our sys
tem," added Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3.
In an interview with The Daily,
Flipside president Jeremy
Keeshin 'l2 said the humor publi
cation's approach to special fees
was the best chance "to really get
people to start looking at special

fees budgets."
During his update, Elections
Commissioner Stephen Trusheim
'l3 briefed the Senate special fees
progress thus far. Student groups
were required to submit special
fees budget information this past
Sunday.Trusheim reflected on the
data in light of special fees reform
legislation recently passed by the
Senate and Graduate Student
Council (GSC).
The total amount of funds re
quested increased 11.9 percent
this year, Trusheim reported. If
the student body approves all of
the submitted budgets, he pre
dicts that activities fees would be
roughly $270 per year for under
graduates and $45 per year for
graduate students, not including a
buffer amount included to pro
tect groups with high refund
rates.
Of the 55 groups seeking spe
cial fees, 10 groups reduced their
budgets from last year and 10 re
quested approximately the same
amount, given inflation. Ten
groups are petitioning the stu
dent body to appear on the ballot,
with the approval of the Senate
Appropriations Committee. Six
groups are petitioning the stu
dent body without a seal of ap
proval from the Appropriations
Committee.

"Every group has a right to be
on the ballot if they are petition
ing," Trusheim said in response to
senators debating the merits of
adding advisory notices to the
ballot.

Other business
The Senate also discussed a
resolution expressing support for
Stanford's transgender communi
ty. Many senators expressed dis
comfort due to the lack of specif
ic language in the bill and ques
tioned whether it might be inter
preted as a political statement
concerning ROTC's potential re
turn to campus.
The Senate will revisit a bill
defining the role of the ASSU So
licitors General next week. The
bill has been a source of disagree
ment between the Constitutional
Council and the ASSU Solicitors
General.
With the encouragement of
ASSU Executive Angelina Car
dona 'll, the Senate moved to
delay the start of next Tuesday's
meeting to 8:30 p.m. to enable
senators to attend the Judicial Af
fairs town hall meeting at 7 p.m.
All funding bills for the evening
were passed.
