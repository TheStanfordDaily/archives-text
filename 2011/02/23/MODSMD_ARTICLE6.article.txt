## Marguerite bus routes to change New routes to reduce inefficiencies, vehicle emissions, operating costs 
### ANN TYLER MOSES STAFF WRITER 
Beginning March 1, the Stanford Mar
guerite shuttle system will undergo ex
tensive changes intended to improve effi
ciency for its riders, make better use of its
budget and decrease its environmental
impact. Every line, except the Arden
wood Express and Menlo Park routes,
will have adjusted times, stops or routes.
The changes developed in response to
a series of surveys sent last fall, said
Brodie Hamilton, director of Parking and
Transportation Services (PT&S).
"We started off with the idea that
maybe there's a better way to run the
routes, so there aren't as many duplica
tions," Hamilton said.
He cited the multiple routes that cater
to the Palo Alto train station as an exam
ple of inefficient duplications.
"Based on two rounds of review by
the campus community, we came up with
what we're planning to implement, which
will create system efficiency and an asso
ciated reduction in vehicle emissions and
operating and maintenance costs,"
Hamilton said.
In perhaps the most drastic revision,
Line A will disappear. Line B, to be re
named Line X traveling counter-clock
wise and Line Y traveling clockwise, will
replace Line A on the west side of cam
pus. A new C Line will cover the current
Line A's east campus stops.
The VA hospital line, to be re
named Line V, will cover the cur
rent C Line service to the Califor
nia Avenue Caltrain Station. The
SLAC line will take over the C Line
route to Searsville Road and Oak
Road.
The Midnight Express, which
currently travels in only one direc
tion, will become the counter
clockwise Line N and clockwise
Line O.
Hamilton stressed that though
the changes seem substantial, a typ
ical rider's route will not change
significantly. It may, in some cases,
become even more efficient.
"The changes that are being im
plemented will still allow people to
get to the same places that they got
before," he said. "The route may
have a different name, or in some
cases they may need to make one
transfer."

Hamilton said this is the first
major review and overhaul of the
shuttle system to be enacted in his
10 years at Stanford.
In order to facilitate a smooth
transition to the new system, PT&S
also revamped its website. One fea
ture allows Marguerite riders to
find the new line that will best cor
respond to the route they currently
take.
PT&S will also host five presen
tations and question-and-answer
sessions about the new system this
week. It plans to send out an elec
tronic update to the Stanford com
munity as March 1 approaches and
encourages commuters to call if
they have questions. PT&S will
provide maps and schedules at all
Marguerite stops, rather than just
20 of the stops, once it transitions to
the new system.
"We went into this saying, 'is
there a smarter way to do this, from
a budget, environmental, traffic
standpoint?" Hamilton said. "And I
think we've come up with that
smarter way that's going to have
less impact through emissions and
cost less as well."
