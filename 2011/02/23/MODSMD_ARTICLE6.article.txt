## Marguerite bus routes to change New routes to reduce inefficiencies, vehicle emissions, operating costs 
### ANN TYLER MOSES STAFF WRITER 
Beginning March 1, the Stanford Mar
guerite shuttle system will undergo ex
tensive changes intended to improve effi
ciency for its riders, make better use of its
budget and decrease its environmental
impact. Every line, except the Arden
wood Express and Menlo Park routes,
will have adjusted times, stops or routes.
The changes developed in response to
a series of surveys sent last fall, said
Brodie Hamilton, director of Parking and
Transportation Services (PT&S).
"We started off with the idea that
maybe there's a better way to run the
routes, so there aren't as many duplica
tions," Hamilton said.
He cited the multiple routes that cater
to the Palo Alto train station as an exam
ple of inefficient duplications.
"Based on two rounds of review by
the campus community, we came up with
what we're planning to implement, which
will create system efficiency and an asso
ciated reduction in vehicle emissions and
operating and maintenance costs,"
Hamilton said.
In perhaps the most drastic revision,
Line A will disappear. Line B, to be re
named Line X traveling counter-clock
wise and Line Y traveling clockwise, will
replace Line A on the west side of cam
pus. A new C Line will cover the current
