## Pugliese shares bio writing work 
### CATHY ZHU 
Stanislao Pugliese, professor of Italian his
tory at Hofstra University, spoke last night at
an event co-hosted by the Andrew W. Mellon
Fellowship and the History Department. Al
though history is often seen as an attempt to
portray events impartially, Pugliese argued
that in historical narratives "honesty is a duty,
but impartiality is a dream."
He began his talk with a personal narrative
about the circumstances leading to his works
before launching into a reading of his two bi
ographies on Italian politicians Carlo Rosselli
and Ignazio Silone. Pugliese then challenged
the audience to "find the link between the per
sonal anecdotes and what ends up on the
printed page."
The author admitted that a combination of
chance and personal connection led him to
choose Rosselli and Silone as biographical

subjects.
While pursuing his postdoctorate at City
University of New York, Pugliese was drawn
to the narrative of anti-fascist Italy, which, in
turn, led him to write a biography on Carlo
Rosselli. Rosselli was founder of the Italian
political organization Giustizia e Liberta (Jus
tice and Liberty).
When his novel, "Carlo Rosselli: Socialist
Heretic and Antifascist Exile," won the 2000
Premio Internazionale Ignazio Silone,
Pugliese became interested in the prize's
namesake, Ignazio Silone, an Italian author
and politician.
Describing his interest in Silone, Pugliese
said he felt "a kind of moral obligation, per
sonal obligation, to this story of a young man
who threw in his lot with the landless peas
ants."

Stanislao Pugliese, professor of Italian history at Hofstra University, spoke Tuesday at a lecture
on his experiences in biographical writing. According to Pugliese, who has written
about several famous Italians, it's difficult to write an impartial biography.
