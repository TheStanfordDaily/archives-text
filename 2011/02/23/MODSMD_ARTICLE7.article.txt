## Pugliese shares bio writing work 
### CATHY ZHU 
Stanislao Pugliese, professor of Italian his
tory at Hofstra University, spoke last night at
an event co-hosted by the Andrew W. Mellon
Fellowship and the History Department. Al
though history is often seen as an attempt to
portray events impartially, Pugliese argued
that in historical narratives "honesty is a duty,
but impartiality is a dream."
He began his talk with a personal narrative
about the circumstances leading to his works
before launching into a reading of his two bi
ographies on Italian politicians Carlo Rosselli
and Ignazio Silone. Pugliese then challenged
the audience to "find the link between the per
sonal anecdotes and what ends up on the
printed page."
The author admitted that a combination of
chance and personal connection led him to
choose Rosselli and Silone as biographical

subjects.
While pursuing his postdoctorate at City
University of New York, Pugliese was drawn
to the narrative of anti-fascist Italy, which, in
turn, led him to write a biography on Carlo
Rosselli. Rosselli was founder of the Italian
political organization Giustizia e Liberta (Jus
tice and Liberty).
When his novel, "Carlo Rosselli: Socialist
Heretic and Antifascist Exile," won the 2000
Premio Internazionale Ignazio Silone,
Pugliese became interested in the prize's
namesake, Ignazio Silone, an Italian author
and politician.
Describing his interest in Silone, Pugliese
said he felt "a kind of moral obligation, per
sonal obligation, to this story of a young man
who threw in his lot with the landless peas
ants."

Stanislao Pugliese, professor of Italian history at Hofstra University, spoke Tuesday at a lecture
on his experiences in biographical writing. According to Pugliese, who has written
about several famous Italians, it's difficult to write an impartial biography.
Just as his choice to dedicate
his academic career to Italian
studies was the result of his even
tual decision to embrace an "in
betweenness" of Italian and
American culture, Pugliese want
ed to write about Silone due to
their shared cultural background.
Pugliese also asserted that im
partiality is impossible in biogra
phical narratives.
"If it is true that in some sense
every work is autobiographical,
biographical works must be even
more so," he said.
Pugliese saw his own work as
an effort to counter two trends in
biography writing: the tendency
of biographies to degenerate into
900-page laundry lists of subjects'
lives and the presumptuous use of
the omniscient voice. Pugliese
also encountered these very prob
lems in his own writings.
"After 10 years of reading doc
uments ... I could not get to the
essence of my subject," he said.
He described his frustration
over being unable to "completely
understand" Ignazio Silone, In an
interview with Silone's wife,
Pugliese found that even she did
not understand who Silone was
after living with him for 40 years.
From this experience, Pugliese
realized that the role of biogra
phers was not to provide the om
niscient authority on the life of a
character, but to provide a narra
tive to the story.
Pugliese encouraged students
in the audience to work on what
they loved and warned that pas
sions can turn into obsessions. He
went on to describe how his re
search on Silone haunted him dur
ing the 10 years in which he draft
ed the biography.
"I never slept so well as I did
the night after I handed in the
manuscript," he concluded.
