## Budget proposals seek education cuts 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
President Barack Obama's 2012
federal budget plans to cut $2O bil
lion in Pell Grant funding for the
coming year and $lOO billion over
the next decade, among other cuts.
The GOP budget also proposes
large slashes to education.
The GOP measure plans to cut
the maximum Pell Grant to $4,705,
which represents a $845 reduction
from the current $5,550 allotted to
students. Obama's plan seeks to cut
other features of the Pell Grant in
order to keep the grant at its current
level.
According to the Stanford Uni
versity Facts website, 17 percent of
undergraduates received Pell grants
in the 2009-2010 academic year. Fed
eral Pell Grants are awarded to
"needy" students who have not re
ceived their bachelor's degree.
Awards range from $4OO to $5,500
per calendar year.
Obama's budget looks to end a
three-year experiment that allows
students to qualify for two Pell
Grants in a calendar year and use
those funds for summer school.
Other cuts will eliminate the govern
ment subsidy that pays the interest
on graduate student loans. Under
graduate students, however, will still
be able to take advantage of that
government subsidy.
The three-year experiment
aimed to encourage more college
graduates to attend graduate school,
but the Department of Education
found that the program did not
achieved its goal.
Since 2008, the Pell Grant pro
gram has experienced a higher num
ber of applicants due to the econom
ic crisis and the growing number of
students attending college. It now
faces a $2O billion deficit.
"We're making some tough
choices to protect the Pell Grant,"
said Justin Hamilton, press secretary
for Education Secretary Arne Dun
can to the Associated Press.
Without these steps, the maxi
mum Pell Grant could decline by
$2,500 "at a time when the cost of
college is skyrocketing," Hamilton
said.
