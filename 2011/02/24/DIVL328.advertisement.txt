VISITING SCHOLAR
On behalf of Stanford's Student National Medical
Association (SNMA) and the Center of Excellence
in Diversity in Medical Education (COEDME) we
would like to invite you to our Pfeiffer Visiting
Professor Lecture Series. As one of the minority
groups participating in this lecture series, SNMA
selects a distinguished African American physician
leader to share their story on the work they have
done to combat health inequities.
This year in celebration of Black History Month,
SNMA have chosen Dr. Henri Ford who will
present on the topic, "Answering the Call to
Action: Response to the Haiti Earthquake of
January 12, 2010." Dr. Ford is the Vice President
and Surgeon-in-Chief at Children's Hospital Los
Angeles and the Professor of Surgery and Vice
Dean for Medical Education at Keck School of
Medicine, University of Southern California. Dr.
Ford was scheduled to be our Pfeiffer Speaker last
year, but when the devastation of Haiti's
earthquake occurred, he felt deeply driven to go
to Haiti to help those in need. There is no doubt
how powerful his experience was and we would
love for you to hear his inspirational story. Haiti is
still in great need of help and there is more we
can do to help with its recovery.
