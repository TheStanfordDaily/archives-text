## Home away from home 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
As Parents' Weekend ap
proaches, students antici
pate exchanging hugs with
family members on the
Farm and easing some of
the homesickness that might have set
in since winter break. However, the
middle of the academic year can be
tougher for international students,
who after the bustle of activity that
came with International Student Ori
entation (ISO) in the fall, experience a
slump in international community
building programming.
John Pearson, director of Bechtel
International Center, the same center
that organizes ISO, identified more
sustained yearlong programming as
"an area where Bechtel has got to
start playing a bigger role."
"I think we need to step in next
year and start offering social and pro
grammatic events," Pearson said.
Every year since 1985, a small
group of freshmen descends upon the
Farm in early September, just days be
fore NSO begins, to begin ISO, three
and half days of programming organ
ized specifically for Stanford's 493 in
ternational undergraduates. ISO is
filled with beach trips and scavenger

hunts as well as more practical activi
ties, such as information sessions on
immigration and financial aid for in
ternationals.
Fresh-faced, overwhelmed and full
of questions, the freshmen interna
tionals take their multicolored pass
ports at the start of ISO to Bechtel In
ternational Center, an enclave near
Tresidder Union, to be introduced to
Stanford, where internationals make
up 7.1 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
These students are much like their
fellow freshman, with the exception of
one subtle difference: their home ad
dress doesn't come with a state name
and zip code.
After ISO, students diffuse into the
general population and must learn to
navigate both Stanford and America
at the same time.
"It's very different being an inter
national student," said Isabella
Sanchez 'l4. "Most of the people are
very different from who you are, and
the international community is not
that big."
The vast majority of internationals
at Stanford, 86 percent, are graduate
students.
"Compared to other colleges, 493
is a pretty decent number," said Brett
Wines 'l2, 2010 ISO Coordinator.

"But if you think about it, it's actually
not very many."
This number does not include stu
dents with dual citizenship, students
with U.S. citizenship who studied
overseas or students who are green
card holders.
According to Pearson, internation
al students face a set of unique chal
lenges.
"The number one challenge is
English," he said. "It's not that we as
sume international undergraduates
can't speak English; it's the use of
English 24 hours a day."
For other students, the pace of the
quarter system and classroom culture
can be a source of anxiety for students
accustomed to other teaching meth
ods.
"It was difficult adjusting to the
culture ... sometimes I feel like I
don't get them [American students].
We value different things," Sanchez
said.
Bechtel tries to address students
concerns like these during ISO, but
also provides other forms of sustained
support throughout the rest of the
year, such as special outreach regard
ing tax issues, campus work or winter
break housing and a special fund to
help with winter break programs for
undergraduates who don't go home.

"A lot of offices on campus are
aware of the fact that adjustment is a
special issue for internationals," Pear
son said. "The dorm communities
ResEd [Residential Education] cre
ates, especially for freshmen, help
tremendously."
One of the main goals of ISO is to
give internationals a chance to be
come acquainted with each other in a
more low-key setting before the flurry
of NSO begins.
"It is completely student-run by
people who know what internationals
feel, because they're the ones who
know how hard it is to overcome jet
lag, how hard it is to come to a country
where you don't know anybody," said
Aki Kobashi'l2, an ISO 2010 Coordi
nator.
Many international students credit
ISO for giving them opportunities to
start meeting other students the very
first day they set foot on campus,
which might also be their first day in
the United States.

"I think it's good that we meet both
the internationals at ISO and our

dorm," said Valeria Fedyk 'l4. "I made
my first friends at ISO, and they're still
some of my best friends."
Bechtel's main focus, especially
since 9/11, is to assist students with
regulatory issues, such as issuing visas
and maintaining legal status.
One downside of having an inter
national status, however, is the restric
tions one might face when trying to
find jobs and internships.
"Can they do it?" Pearson asked.
"Yes. [But] can they do it as easily as
American students? No ... and this
can affect the Stanford experience."
Meanwhile, these 493 representa
tives from around the world from
the Middle East to the Pacific Basin to
Northern Europe are finding their
place within a new country and a new
school, all the while adding their expe
riences to a welcoming student body.
"This is such a diverse campus,"
Pearson said, "and international stu
dents are a very important part of it."

As part of International Student Orientation (ISO), new freshmen gathered on Sept. 12, 2010 to participate in
social and informative activities, such as beach retreats, scavenger hunts and academic workshops.
