## SEEING GREEN Trust me: I'm your friend. 
### Holly Moeler 
Did you know environmental
ists are on OPEC's payroll?
Last week, my grandmother
forwarded me an e-mail with that
stunning punchline. Here's how the
logic flowed: the United States has
tremendous oil and gas reserves in
the Bakken Formation, beneath the
rangelands of Montana and South
Dakota. Although these reserves
could ensure our energy independ
ence, no one has heard of them, and
they're not being tapped. Why? Be
cause OPEC, fearing loss of its ter
rorism-funding revenue, is paying
environmental watchdog groups to
block development.
As something of an armchair en
vironmentalist (I get mail from the
Sierra Club and the non-wrestling
WWF, anyway), I was stunned
not least because I'd never heard of
the Bakken Formation myself. Per
my grandmother's request for a sec
ond opinion before she forwarded
the e-mail onward, I dug a little
deeper.
Yes, we've known about the
Bakken Formation for 60 years. Yes,
we've known that some extractable
oil is there. But we've only recently
(in 2008) increased our estimates of
the recoverable volume to four bil
lion barrels (compared to the U.S.
consumption rate of seven billion
barrels per year).
The Bakken has been under de
velopment since 2000, with a flurry
of activity following recent techno
logical advances and increased vol
ume estimates. Hardly any media
attention outside the local news (ar
ticles primarily focused on the
dearth of women in towns glutted
by young men hunting black gold)
has been paid. An off-the-cuff poll
of friends and coworkers brought
up blank stares.
Yet, behind the scenes, oil flow
ing from the Bakken has actually in
creased our domestic production
even after disasters like the BP spill
last year led to drilling suspension
in the Gulf of Mexico. Technology
and infrastructure have been the
rate-limiting steps (it takes time to
lay pipes and work up to capacity),
not environmental filibusters. In
deed, the "environmentalist" line
far from being controlled by
OPEC oil dollars has consistent
ly favored energy security for the
United States. It turns out that
home-grown renewables wind,
solar and the like are even more
secure (because they won't run out)
than fossil fuels, and better for the
environment, too.
So how do e-mails like this one,
which boasted an impressively long
string of "FWD:"s before my grand
mother's note to me gain so
much momentum when they are so
off base?
Part of the reason is our informa
tion saturation. We're bombarded
with sound bites, each trying to be
sexier or more provocative than the
one before. Details are trimmed,
facts are cherry-picked and the
message's recipient rarely has the
time or inclination to check up on
the story's veracity.
What happens when stories con
flict? Naturally, we tend to identify
with the source that confirms our
existing views. The modern media
diffused over hundreds of TV
stations, thousands of websites and
millions of chain e-mails makes
it easier than ever to filter out con
flicting messages by subscribing
only to "conservative" newsfeeds or
listening exclusively to "liberal"
podcasts.

As an ecologist relying on the
goodwill of humanity to fund my re
search and keep my study subjects
alive, I'm worried about our in
creasing tunnel vision. Humanity's
gravest challenges overpopula
tion, climate change, biodiversity
loss and so forth are as complex
as they are frightening. Most of us
don't spend our free time wrestling
with the morality of reproductive
rights, pinning down the difference
between "climate" and "weather"
or considering the acreage of rain
forest cleared to plant the coffee
bushes for our daily pre-class jolt.
Unfortunately, ignorance leads only
to temporary bliss. And many angry
e-mails.
How do we begin to talk with
each other, instead of past each
other?
First, by building trust. How
many times do you turn to those
you know and love for advice?
When has a steadfast opinion been
swayed by the words of someone
you respect? Why will you listen pa
tiently to your roommate but switch
off the television commentary?
These interpersonal bonds are
critical for our sanity and for our
wisdom. One brain cannot hold all
the knowledge of humanity, so we
must rely on others to help us gath
er and parse data. That said, think
for yourself. Scrutinize the facts, and
check your sources. If you can con
vince yourself, you'll never fear op
position, because you'll be able to
see why the differences of opinion
arose. You will be able to change
your own mind freely, without par
roting back someone else's dogma.
So keep an open mind, and keep
having open conversations. Trust,
but verify. And call your grand
mother: she loves you, and you'd be
surprised what she'll let you get
away with. Including convincing her
not to forward that e-mail.

Did you fact check this column? If so,
send your corrections and other com
ments to hollyvm@stanford.edu. Oh,
and "Hi, Grandma!"

How do we
begin to talk
with each
other, instead
of past
each other?

Did you know environmental
ists are on OPEC's payroll?
Last week, my grandmother
forwarded me an e-mail with that
stunning punchline. Here's how the
logic flowed: the United States has
tremendous oil and gas reserves in
the Bakken Formation, beneath the
rangelands of Montana and South
Dakota. Although these reserves
could ensure our energy independ
ence, no one has heard of them, and
they're not being tapped. Why? Be
cause OPEC, fearing loss of its ter
rorism-funding revenue, is paying
environmental watchdog groups to
block development.
As something of an armchair en
vironmentalist (I get mail from the
Sierra Club and the non-wrestling
WWF, anyway), I was stunned
not least because I'd never heard of
the Bakken Formation myself. Per
my grandmother's request for a sec
ond opinion before she forwarded
the e-mail onward, I dug a little
deeper.
Yes, we've known about the
Bakken Formation for 60 years. Yes,
we've known that some extractable
oil is there. But we've only recently
(in 2008) increased our estimates of
the recoverable volume to four bil
lion barrels (compared to the U.S.
consumption rate of seven billion
barrels per year).
The Bakken has been under de
velopment since 2000, with a flurry
of activity following recent techno
logical advances and increased vol
ume estimates. Hardly any media
attention outside the local news (ar
ticles primarily focused on the
dearth of women in towns glutted
by young men hunting black gold)
has been paid. An off-the-cuff poll
of friends and coworkers brought
up blank stares.
Yet, behind the scenes, oil flow
ing from the Bakken has actually in
creased our domestic production
even after disasters like the BP spill
last year led to drilling suspension
in the Gulf of Mexico. Technology
and infrastructure have been the
rate-limiting steps (it takes time to
lay pipes and work up to capacity),
not environmental filibusters. In
deed, the "environmentalist" line
far from being controlled by
OPEC oil dollars has consistent
ly favored energy security for the
United States. It turns out that
home-grown renewables wind,
solar and the like are even more
secure (because they won't run out)
than fossil fuels, and better for the
environment, too.
So how do e-mails like this one,
which boasted an impressively long
string of "FWD:"s before my grand
mother's note to me gain so
much momentum when they are so
off base?
Part of the reason is our informa
tion saturation. We're bombarded
with sound bites, each trying to be
sexier or more provocative than the
one before. Details are trimmed,
facts are cherry-picked and the
message's recipient rarely has the
time or inclination to check up on
the story's veracity.
What happens when stories con
flict? Naturally, we tend to identify
with the source that confirms our
existing views. The modern media
diffused over hundreds of TV
stations, thousands of websites and
millions of chain e-mails makes
it easier than ever to filter out con
flicting messages by subscribing
only to "conservative" newsfeeds or
listening exclusively to "liberal"
podcasts.

As an ecologist relying on the
goodwill of humanity to fund my re
search and keep my study subjects
alive, I'm worried about our in
creasing tunnel vision. Humanity's
gravest challenges overpopula
tion, climate change, biodiversity
loss and so forth are as complex
as they are frightening. Most of us
don't spend our free time wrestling
with the morality of reproductive
rights, pinning down the difference
between "climate" and "weather"
or considering the acreage of rain
forest cleared to plant the coffee
bushes for our daily pre-class jolt.
Unfortunately, ignorance leads only
to temporary bliss. And many angry
e-mails.
How do we begin to talk with
each other, instead of past each
other?
First, by building trust. How
many times do you turn to those
you know and love for advice?
When has a steadfast opinion been
swayed by the words of someone
you respect? Why will you listen pa
tiently to your roommate but switch
off the television commentary?
These interpersonal bonds are
critical for our sanity and for our
wisdom. One brain cannot hold all
the knowledge of humanity, so we
must rely on others to help us gath
er and parse data. That said, think
for yourself. Scrutinize the facts, and
check your sources. If you can con
vince yourself, you'll never fear op
position, because you'll be able to
see why the differences of opinion
arose. You will be able to change
your own mind freely, without par
roting back someone else's dogma.
So keep an open mind, and keep
having open conversations. Trust,
but verify. And call your grand
mother: she loves you, and you'd be
surprised what she'll let you get
away with. Including convincing her
not to forward that e-mail.
