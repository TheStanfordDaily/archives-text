## Stanford Flipside, Your Words Speak Louder Than Your Actions 
### MEGAN KANNE '12 COLETTE POSSE '12 
The Stanford Flipside has recently begun a
Special Fees petition in order to bypass the
ASSU's rejection of their original budget.
The Flipside staff argue that they have decided to
include a Segway in their budget as away to bring
to light the absurdity of what they see as other
groups' wasteful spending.
We would like to make an appeal to the Flip
side staff: asking students for money you do not
need in order to protest that very act is NOT the
way to go about making this statement. You have
a popular publication. Use words as your tool to
change opinion; do not engage in wasteful spend
ing yourself.
It is the job of the ASSU Appropriations
Committee to negotiate with groups' financial

officers to cut the budgets down as much as pos
sible and to make sure groups' budgets are not
hidden to Special Fees voters. It is fair to say
that at least the vast majority of wasteful spend
ing in student groups is filtered in this process.
Obviously, the Flipside knows this from experi
ence.
On the other hand, remember this when you
look through other groups' budgets: just because
something is expensive does not necessarily
mean that it is wasteful. As the financial and mar
keting staff of Cardinal Ballet, we understand
this (tutus are not cheap), and the Flipside must
understand this as well.
Flipside: if you have a problem with a group's
budget, contact that group's financial officer di

rectly or talk to the Appropriations Committee.
If they do not budge, let your criticism be known
in your publication maybe a few hundred
swayed opinions on the part of the student body
will change that group's mind on that one line
item in their budget.
We love the Flipside, and we would love to
vote for an ASSU-approved budget that is not
wasteful. Please lose the Segway and start using
your publication to get your word out. Stanford
students: please understand that when you sign a
Special Fees petition, you have gone beyond the
realm of a joke and into making decisions about
real money.
