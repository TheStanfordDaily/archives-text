# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Hi, Mom! 
### Shane Savitsky 
Quick, you'd better stash that
handle of Smirnoff some
where inconspicuous. Tell
your roommate to dismantle that
massive tower of PBR empties that
he's been accumulating. Oh, and
that case of original Four Loko that
you've been waiting to break out?
Shove it somewhere deep under
your bed. Honestly, you probably
haven't vacuumed since November,
so you should do that now, too.
Why? It's that time of year again:
Parents' Weekend.
Ah, yes, the time each year when
our beautiful little Stanford bubble
gets popped for a few days so our
parents can experience the fun and
relaxation of The Farm. Stanford or
ganizes a bunch of cutesy events for
our parents to attend and finishes
the whole grand gesture by making
sure to ask them for even more
money. You know, on top of the
$55,000 they already pay annually
to send us here.
Stanford also makes a habit of
scheduling this thing in the middle

of February every year, ostensibly
so we can say,"Look! The weather is
so much better than Harvard's.
We're in California, remember?"
Ah, but we've even somehow man
aged to screw up that fact this year.
The San Francisco Chronicle re
ported this week that the Bay Area
has its first chance for measurable
snow since 1976 this weekend. Un
less your dad is Tony Montana, no
one is going to be enjoying the
weather on campus this weekend.
Seriously, you thought Reunion
Homecoming was bad? Parents'
Weekend is pushing that to the ex
treme. Even if alums are too busy
day-dreaming about their debauch
erous glory days, they at least know
how to navigate campus. Parents'
Weekend is like the blind leading
the blind. Throw some rain and cold
in there, and people might get man
gled in a Circle of Death confronta
tion in the next few days.
Now, don't get me wrong. I may
hate the idea of Parents' Weekend,
but I dig it in practice. It's the only

time I can ever get my mom to come
to campus. She's in the Bay Area
relatively often, but she's a flight at
tendant. Obviously, 12-hour lay
overs in San Francisco don't neces
sarily mesh well with a three-hour
time difference and a six-hour flight
the next day. Invariably, I end up
heading into the city for a nice Ital
ian dinner. No complaints here.
But still, my mom hasn't been on
campus in over a year, so I'm psy
ched to show her everything new
here at Stanford. Case in point: Ike's
Place. My weekly trip there is a
mess of emotion. I'm always pretty
certain the line won't be long. Then,
on arrival, I'm part disappointed
and part terrified at how massive it
is. As my wait time approaches an
hour, I get increasingly pissed off. (If
I manage to spot Andrew Luck
skipping the line and grabbing his
phone order, I always kick myself
for not doing the same. They always
say that he's smart on TV. They're
right.) Finally, I get to order ex
cept I then wait another 20 minutes
for my sandwich. Yet, everything is
forgotten once I take that first won
drous bite. In terms of sharing Stan
ford experiences with my mom, this
is my first priority. The (really great)
classes I'm taking this quarter?
Meh, eating comes first.
Oh, and my mom always brings a
friend of hers with her when she
comes to visit for Parents' Weekend!

I hate the idea of
Parents'weekend,
but I dig it in
practice

This reduces the need for me to
babysit her during her time here and
thus reduces the possibility of us get
ting into a fight. During freshman
year, she brought along one of her
best friends, Anita (also a flight at
tendant). I somehow became acute
ly worried that people would think
Anita was my mom's girlfriend (we

do go to school in California, after
all). This led to Anita introducing
herself to people as my "second
mom" for the next few days.
Parents' Weekend, it's always in
teresting. Oh, and if you happen to
see me leading my mom around
campus over the next few days, feel
free to blame her for bringing the
cold with her from Scranton. I
know 1 will.

herself to people as my "second
mom" for the next few days.
Parents' Weekend, it's always in
teresting. Oh, and if you happen to
see me leading my mom around
campus over the next few days, feel
free to blame her for bringing the
cold with her from Scranton. I
know 1 will.
