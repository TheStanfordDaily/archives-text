The Stanford women's basketball team
returns to the Farm after knocking off the
Los Angeles schools last weekend in its
final road trip, securing itself a first-round
bye in the Pac-10 Tournament in the
process.
The No. 2 Cardinal (24-2,15-0 Pac-10)
knocked off USC, 78-64, on Friday night,
then rallied to beat No. 9 UCLA, 67-53.
The two victories solidified the Cardi
nal's spot atop the Pac-10 conference,
helping it to a 2.5 game lead over UCLA
with just three games left in conference
Play-
Stanford was without star forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike in Sunday's contest
with the Bruins, and the Cardinal fresh
men rose to the occasion.
Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike
did her best sister act, rolling to 18 points
and 15 rebounds, while freshman guard
Toni Kokenis had 13 points, two assists
and three steals.
"Our young players really stepped up,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Chiney really put the hammer down, she
scored inside, rebounded and got to the
free throw line, and Toni Kokenis came in
and gave us a big lift."
Despite a shaky start, Chiney Ogwu
mike's 13 points in the second half showed
that despite her youth, she could rise to the
occasion at any time.
"We knew we made a lot of mistakes in
the first half. We weren't playing as well as
we could have, and we weren't being as ag
gressive as we could have been," Ogwu
mike said. "[VanDerveer] told me, you're
going be the one to go on the block and go
to work."
