The Stanford women's basketball team
returns to the Farm after knocking off the
Los Angeles schools last weekend in its
final road trip, securing itself a first-round
bye in the Pac-10 Tournament in the
process.
The No. 2 Cardinal (24-2,15-0 Pac-10)
knocked off USC, 78-64, on Friday night,
then rallied to beat No. 9 UCLA, 67-53.
The two victories solidified the Cardi
nal's spot atop the Pac-10 conference,
helping it to a 2.5 game lead over UCLA
with just three games left in conference
Play-
Stanford was without star forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike in Sunday's contest
with the Bruins, and the Cardinal fresh
men rose to the occasion.
Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike
did her best sister act, rolling to 18 points
and 15 rebounds, while freshman guard
Toni Kokenis had 13 points, two assists
and three steals.
"Our young players really stepped up,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Chiney really put the hammer down, she
scored inside, rebounded and got to the
free throw line, and Toni Kokenis came in
and gave us a big lift."
Despite a shaky start, Chiney Ogwu
mike's 13 points in the second half showed
that despite her youth, she could rise to the
occasion at any time.
"We knew we made a lot of mistakes in
the first half. We weren't playing as well as
we could have, and we weren't being as ag
gressive as we could have been," Ogwu
mike said. "[VanDerveer] told me, you're
going be the one to go on the block and go
to work."

GAME NOTES: Stanford ran its winning streak to 18
games after a sweep of the Los Angeles schools last
weekend, and returns to the Farm to take on Ore
gon. The Card soundly defeated the Ducks 91 -56
in their last matchup in Eugene back in January.
The Cardinal finish the regular season with three
games at Maples before the Pac-10 Tournament in
March.

Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike (above) buoyed the Cardinal in place of her injured sister this
past weekend, scoring 18 points and pulling down 15 rebounds against No. 9 UCLA.
Ogwumike also mentioned that
games where the Cardinal is missing
a star player can be a blessing in dis
guise, especially because the team
has been a little slow out of the gates
lately.
" [Struggles] are part of what hap
pens midseason for a team, and I
think that losing an integral person
in a game keeps us on our straight
track," Ogwumike said. "It keeps us
motivated, and we do things based
on our teamwork, not based off of
our individual capacities."
The Cardinal's next challenge
will be against the Oregon schools
once again, with the Oregon Ducks
coming into Maples Pavilion first on
Thursday night.
The Ducks (12-13, 3-11 Pac-10)
look to be the Cardinal's next vic
tim, as the girls from Eugene have
lost nine of their last 10 games dating
back to Jan. 13.
Oregon has two potent scoring
threats in guard Nia Jackson and for
ward Amanda Jackson, who average
17.0 and 16.4 points per game, re
spectively. However, even with the
one-two punch of Jackson and John
son, the Ducks shoot just 37.6 per
cent from the floor and give up 76.6
points per game.
Last time against the Ducks,
Stanford cruised to a 91-56 win, with
Oregon shooting 25.0 percent on the
game and a dreadful 3-for-32 from
three.
Additionally, Chiney Ogwumike,
one of the freshman heroes from
this weekend, had 18 points and 12
rebounds in the trip to Eugene.
Despite her confidence in the
team's ability and her dominant play

in lieu of her sister, Chiney Ogwu
mike said that she still feels that she
has a lot to learn in this postseason
run, but has a strategy for getting
better.
"I still feel heavily like a fresh
man at all times," she said. "In the
games, the only way I can get my
mental capacity is by telling myself.
.. it's players against players, not
class against class."
Ogwumike also said that now
that the Cardinal had a little dis
tance ahead of UCLA, they could
relax and play their best basketball.
"At this point, we know that not
all games are guaranteed, we know
that we want to win a Pac-10 cham
pionship, we want to win a Pac-10
tournament championship and we
want to win a national champi
onship," Ogwumike said. "Basically,
clinching the bye, yeah, we are al
most there, but we still have to exe
cute. There's not a lot of time left, so
we just want to pull it together
soon."
And although Ogwumike and
VanDerveer both have suggested
that this team still has away to go to
live up to their perfectionistic stan
dards, the Cardinal bumped its way
up to No. 2 in the national polls this
weekend behind No. 1 UConn,
who the Card has already beaten
this season.
Ogwumike said the snub for the
number one spot was not in the Car
dinal's mind heading down the
stretch.
"I think that everything's due in
time, it'd be nice to have it, but it's
not what we're worried about," she
said.
The Cardinal and Ducks tip off
Thursday night's contest at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
