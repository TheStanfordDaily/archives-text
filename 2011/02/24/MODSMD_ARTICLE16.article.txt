# FIGHT TO THE FINISH
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
With the final four games of the
season quickly approaching, the
Stanford men's basketball team has
few remaining chances to snap the
recent losing streak and conclude
the year with a winning record.
The Cardinal (13-13,6-9 Pac-10)
will face Oregon State (9-16, 4-10
Pac-10) Thursday night in Corvallis,
with the opportunity to complete a
season sweep of the Beavers and
gain a little momentum for the
matchup with Oregon on Saturday.
The prospect of finishing sixth in
the Pac-10 is within Stanford's
reach, but the team will have to pro
duce some strong road finishes to
earn the spot.
In order for Stanford to pull off a
victory, the team will have to make
serious adjustments to the offensive
effort it displayed against USC last

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal need a strong
finish to its season to end the year with a
winning record, and the Oregon State
Beavers have had their struggles lately, with
only Iwo wins in their last 12 games. Should
the Cardinal win out in its conference sched
ule, it can finish as high as 6th in the Pac-10.



SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman John Gage (above) has played a big roleforthe Card
lately, averaging 6.5 points per game in the last eight games, as
well as earning the first start of his career against USC.
Saturday.
The Card went just 6-for-30 from
the floor in the second half and
scored a mere 22 points in the final
20 minutes, causing Stanford to fall
short of the Trojans by a wide mar
gin of 69-53.
The loss to USC, along with two
previous losses to UCLA and Wash
ington, has put the Cardinal in a rut,
but Oregon State has faced the
same recent misfortune and is riding
a four-game losing streak. In fact,
the Beavers are just 2-10 since
sweeping the Arizona schools dur
ing the very first weekend of confer
ence play.
Defense is not Oregon State's
strong suit, as the Beavers have al
lowed an average of 71.8 points per
game, as well as 45.7 percent shoot

ing from its opponents.
Stanford looks to capitalize on
this by feeding the ball to freshman
guard Anthony Brown and fresh
man forward Dwight Powell, who
put up a solid offensive showing
against the Beavers the first time
around. Brown secured eight re
bounds and racked 21 points on 7-
for-11 shooting, and Powell was 3-
for-3 with nine points in the
matchup back on Jan. 29.
The pair of rookies, along with
several other Cardinal freshmen,
has been especially key for Stanford
in recent weeks, filling the starting
rotation and coming off the bench
to combine for 52 points and 36 re
bounds over the last two games.
At one point during Saturday's
game with USC, head coach Johnny
Dawkins had five freshmen on the
court at the same time. Dawkins has
also incorporated at least two fresh
men in the starting lineup for over
half of Stanford's games.
Finding the right starting combi

nation has proven to be a struggle
for the Card, as there has been little
game-to-game consistency for the
first five to step on the floor. In fact,
Saturday's combination of junior
Jarrett Mann, junior Jeremy Green,
Brown, freshman John Gage and
junior Josh Owens was the eighth
different starting lineup of the sea
son.
Dawkins is expected to utilize
this same group against the
Beavers, especially because of
Gage's success in his first outing as
a starter. They will look to put an
early stop in the efforts of Jared
Cunningham (13.5 ppg, 49 assists,
71 steals) and Calvin Haynes (9.8
ppg, 79.1 FT shooting), who will be
the main offensive forces for the
Beavers.
Tip-off is scheduled for 6 p.m.
PST in Gill Coliseum in Corvallis,
Ore.
