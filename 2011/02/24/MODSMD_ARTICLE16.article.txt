# FIGHT TO THE FINISH
## 
### LAUREN TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
With the final four games of the
season quickly approaching, the
Stanford men's basketball team has
few remaining chances to snap the
recent losing streak and conclude
the year with a winning record.
The Cardinal (13-13,6-9 Pac-10)
will face Oregon State (9-16, 4-10
Pac-10) Thursday night in Corvallis,
with the opportunity to complete a
season sweep of the Beavers and
gain a little momentum for the
matchup with Oregon on Saturday.
The prospect of finishing sixth in
the Pac-10 is within Stanford's
reach, but the team will have to pro
duce some strong road finishes to
earn the spot.
In order for Stanford to pull off a
victory, the team will have to make
serious adjustments to the offensive
effort it displayed against USC last

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal need a strong
finish to its season to end the year with a
winning record, and the Oregon State
Beavers have had their struggles lately, with
only Iwo wins in their last 12 games. Should
the Cardinal win out in its conference sched
ule, it can finish as high as 6th in the Pac-10.
