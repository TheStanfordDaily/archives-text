## Softball returns home for Nike Invitational 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford Softball team re
turns to Smith Family Stadium this
Friday, opening up the 2011 Stanford
Nike Invitational.
The No. 16 Cardinal (8-2) hosts a
tournament that includes No. 24
Kentucky, Colorado State, Memphis,
North Dakota State and UC Davis.
The tournament comes after a 4-1
weekend for Stanford in the UNLV
Louisville Slugger Desert Classic in
Las Vegas, where sophomore Teagan
Gerhart had a great two-way week
end, hitting .500 with two home runs
and going 3-1 as a pitcher.
Stanford's weekend in the desert
saw the Card defeat No. 23 BYU and
No. 3 Tennessee, with senior pitcher
Ashley Chinn tossing a one-hit
shutout to knock off the Lady Volun
teers.
The Cardinal will once again
lean on its excellent pitching, as
both Gerhart and Chinn have four
wins and one complete-game
shutout under their belts this sea
son. Gerhart is 4-2 with a 1.17 ERA
and 35 strikeouts, and Chinn is 4-0
in four starts with 33 strikeouts of
her own.
Offensively, the Card has been
solid so far as well, as starters Ash
ley Hansen, Jaquilyn Edwards and
Sarah Hassman all have batting av
erages north of .400.
Stanford opens up the weekend
against Memphis and North Dako
ta State with a doubleheader start
ing at 1:30 p.m. Friday afternoon.
