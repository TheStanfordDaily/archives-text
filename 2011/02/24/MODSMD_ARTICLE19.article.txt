# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Cardinal plays host to MPSF rivals 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball
team kicks off the second half of its Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation season this
weekend, playing host to two top-10 oppo
nents No. 8 UCLA on Friday night and
No. 3 UC-Santa Barbara on Saturday
night.
The past few weeks have been an up
and-down ride for the Cardinal (10-4, 7-4
MPSF). The team opened the regular sea
son with a big home sweep of then-No. 2
B YU, but then split a road series in Hawaii.
The Cardinal went on a three-game win
streak by defeating Pacific at home and
then sweeping Loyola and Lewis College
in a non-conference road trip to Chicago.
However, Stanford couldn't keep up the
momentum and was stunned in a home
loss to UC-San Diego
"UCSD played well and truly beat us,"
said Stanford head coach John Kosty.
"Every match in the MPSF is important
and demands your very best."
Last weekend, Stanford was badly over
matched in a 3-0 loss at USC before rally
ing to victory in the second match of the
weekend, snapping a 13-match losing
streak on the road against Pepperdine.
In all, the Cardinal has played six week
end series and split five of them, a statistic
that could be attributed to the parity in the
MPSF 11 of the 12 teams in the confer
ence are currently listed in the AVCA Di
vision-I rankings.
But despite the difficulty that playing in
the MPSF presents, Kosty still isn't satis
fied.
"We need to keep improving our con
sistency with every practice and game," he
said. "The MPSF is always good from top
to bottom, and it's a given that every week
end means we will face two quality oppo
nents."
UCLA (8-8) comes into Friday's match
with a 3-7 MPSF conference record, but
they have a lot to play for. The Bruins are
within reach of the Bth conference spot
the last entry into the season-end
ing tournament and a potential
NCAA berth. Led by outside hitter
Weston Dunlap, the Bruins split a
series with Hawaii and are a very
dangerous serving team, ranking
second in the MPSF with 1.31 aces
per set.
Stanford trails UCLA in the all
time series by a wide margin (61-
15), but has had recent success with
three-straight home victories.
On Saturday, Stanford wel
comes in red-hot UC-Santa Bar
bara (9-6, 7-5) and will have its
hands full against middle blocker
Dylan Davis and outside hitter
Scott Slaughter, who leads the

MPSF in hitting percentage at .490.
The Gauchos' solid play has led
them to their highest ranking since
Feb. 19,2007.
UCSB also leads the all-time se
ries against the Cardinal 42-27, with
a few of those losses coming at the
hands of Kosty, who was a standout
player with the Gauchos in the
1980s. However, Stanford won the
last meeting between the two teams
last April, 3-0.
Junior setter Evan Barry is
fourth in the MPSF with 10.96 as
sists per set, and two-time All-
American junior libero Erik Shoji
is second in the conference and
sixth in the country with 2.52 digs
per set.
The match against UCLA tips at
7 p.m. Friday at Maples Pavilion.
