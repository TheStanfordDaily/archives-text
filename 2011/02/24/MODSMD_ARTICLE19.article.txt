## Cardinal plays host to MPSF rivals 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball
team kicks off the second half of its Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation season this
weekend, playing host to two top-10 oppo
nents No. 8 UCLA on Friday night and
No. 3 UC-Santa Barbara on Saturday
night.
The past few weeks have been an up
and-down ride for the Cardinal (10-4, 7-4
MPSF). The team opened the regular sea
son with a big home sweep of then-No. 2
B YU, but then split a road series in Hawaii.
The Cardinal went on a three-game win
streak by defeating Pacific at home and
then sweeping Loyola and Lewis College
in a non-conference road trip to Chicago.
However, Stanford couldn't keep up the
momentum and was stunned in a home
loss to UC-San Diego
"UCSD played well and truly beat us,"
said Stanford head coach John Kosty.
"Every match in the MPSF is important
and demands your very best."
Last weekend, Stanford was badly over
matched in a 3-0 loss at USC before rally
ing to victory in the second match of the
weekend, snapping a 13-match losing
streak on the road against Pepperdine.
In all, the Cardinal has played six week
end series and split five of them, a statistic
that could be attributed to the parity in the
MPSF 11 of the 12 teams in the confer
ence are currently listed in the AVCA Di
vision-I rankings.
But despite the difficulty that playing in
the MPSF presents, Kosty still isn't satis
fied.
"We need to keep improving our con
sistency with every practice and game," he
said. "The MPSF is always good from top
to bottom, and it's a given that every week
end means we will face two quality oppo
nents."
UCLA (8-8) comes into Friday's match
with a 3-7 MPSF conference record, but
they have a lot to play for. The Bruins are
within reach of the Bth conference spot
