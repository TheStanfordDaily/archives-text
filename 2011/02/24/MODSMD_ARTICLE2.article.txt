## DAPER to leave Roble gym Stanford Drama and Dance slated as new tenants 
### ISAAC GATENO 
Tentative plans are in place for
the Department of Athletics, Physi
cal Education and Recreation
(DAPER) to vacate Roble Gym.
Stanford Drama and Dance Divi
sion are slated to take over the
space,
"It seems to be the general plan
that DAPER will be moving out of
Roble, and Drama/Dance will have
use of the spaces in Roble that they
are vacating," Drama Department
chair Peggy Phelan wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
Don Intersimone, director of Fa
cilities and Capital Planning, con
firmed that DAPER would vacate
Roble's locker rooms, showers and
swimming pool.
"Drama will have the opportu
nity to make use of [those spaces],"
Intersimone said.
He added that this development
would "provide additional flexibili

complex."
Roble Gym has deteriorated
since its 1931 opening. Last August,
Santa Clara County officials shut
down the main performance space,
Roble Studio Theater, due to safety
concerns. Phelan said a study to
bring the space up to code is cur
rently being conducted, but added
that it made little sense to fix the
theater without undertaking a
major overhaul of the building.
"The need for more theater and
performance spaces here is ab
solutely urgent," Phelan said.
There are only a few perform
ance spaces for theater on campus.
Prosser Studio and the Nitery both
seat fewer than 100 people. Pigott
Theater seats 194, and Memorial
Auditorium (MemAud) seats 1,705.
"MemAud is too big for the
kinds of experimental works I think
universities should be pursuing, and
the acoustics are not ideal," Phelan
said.
The size gap between Pigott The
ater and MemAud is one big issue
for the Drama Department and stu
dent groups such as Ram's Head
Theatrical Society and the Stanford
Shakespeare Company.
"We cannot make a great show
highlighting student performances
and put it in a lecture hall," Phelan
said.
The problem of finding perform
ance space is not exclusive to the
ater groups. The Dance Division
similarly lacks "a good space with
