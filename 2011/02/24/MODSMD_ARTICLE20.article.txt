# Can sports keep our lives civil?

After turning quite serious last
week, I wanted to write some
thing a bit lighter this week. But
it's becoming harder and hard
er to do that in light of recent
developments in North Africa. There is cer
tainly no lack of entertaining sports on TV to
comment on, especially with the Cricket
World Cup in full swing on the Indian sub
continent, but my attention is dragged away
by more important events elsewhere.
As I write this. Colonel Gaddafi is still
managing to hang on to power in Libya, but,
while the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt
were generally (and surprisingly) bloodless,
the situation in Libya looks increasingly dire
for its people. There are numerous reports of
military forces and mercenaries killing civil

countries where mass demonstrations or

brate successes, people can experience the
power of popular movements and realize
how difficult it can be for any government to
control such huge numbers. Some reports in
