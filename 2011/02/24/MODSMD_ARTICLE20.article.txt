# Can sports keep our lives civil?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
After turning quite serious last
week, I wanted to write some
thing a bit lighter this week. But
it's becoming harder and hard
er to do that in light of recent
developments in North Africa. There is cer
tainly no lack of entertaining sports on TV to
comment on, especially with the Cricket
World Cup in full swing on the Indian sub
continent, but my attention is dragged away
by more important events elsewhere.
As I write this. Colonel Gaddafi is still
managing to hang on to power in Libya, but,
while the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt
were generally (and surprisingly) bloodless,
the situation in Libya looks increasingly dire
for its people. There are numerous reports of
military forces and mercenaries killing civil
ians and increasing warnings that "crimes
against humanity" may be being committed
across the country something Gaddafi
himself has practically confirmed in rambling
televised threats.
The idea of watching, playing or talking
about a handful of people chasing a ball
around a grassy field seems futile in compari
son to this. But is it? Can sports play a positive
role in such a situation?
They certainly can. Sports have been used
by regimes to bolster their support, deflect at
tention from local problems and distract dis
enchanted youths from getting involved in
politics. Should Gaddafi successfully quash
the current uprising, it seems certain that he
would try to use the Africa Cup of Nations
soccer tournament that Libya is due to hold
in 2013 to energize and unify the country
under his rule. But this approach doesn't al
ways work. Sports may be apolitical, but in
countries where mass demonstrations or
unions are restricted or banned, they can
offer a unique way for people to join togeth
er en masse. By crowding together to cele
brate successes, people can experience the
power of popular movements and realize
how difficult it can be for any government to
control such huge numbers. Some reports in
dicate that soccer fans in Tunisia and Egypt
may have been instrumental in the
successful demonstrations there.
However, the mob mentality of
large groups of fans is not always well
directed. There are indications that
some supporters are joining together
to back Gaddafi, and in the lawless
vacuum created by large crowds, bru
tal things can take place. It is not with
out reason that soccer hooligans have
a bad image. The objectionable ac
tions of a small few, though, shouldn't
tarnish the impact of sports in gener
al. Beyond providing a nursery for
fledgling political movements, they

can also offer embattled people with a
televised glimpse of normality and
the simple chance to forget their wor
ries for a short while and get fully en
grossed in a game.
Sports can also break down barri
ers and bring disparate people togeth
er. Your political opinions and cultur
al or class background mean little on
the playing field sports are a great
equalizer and you can suddenly
find yourself engaging with people
that are far outside your own circle.
English and German soldiers infa
mously, and unbelievably, called a
truce to play a game of soccer in no
man's land between the trenches one
Christmas during the First World War.
This bridging of separate worlds
has perhaps even had international
connotations. It may be a little ex
treme to say that the growth of inter
national sport may have helped pre
vent conflict, but as countries have be
come more intertwined with trade
and diplomacy, the chances of major
confrontation off the field seem to
have lowered.

Sports certainly offer a viable al
ternative to official diplomacy, not
just in bringing countries closer to

gether, but also through its figure
heads. Major athletes, like film stars,
can be so widely followed and re
spected that they challenge most po
litical dignitaries for influence and
popular support. Also, because they
are identified more with their profes
sion than with any particular ideology,
they may be heard by those from all
sides of the political spectrum and can
talk openly without having to guard
what they say. As the world's response
to the crisis in Libya remains cagey,
with leaders unable or unwilling to
throw their full support behind either
Gaddafi or the revolution that seeks
to remove him, there is a great oppor
tunity for such stars to take a stand.
The sporting world is undoubtedly
relevant to the current situation in
Libya and can positively affect its
people. Hopefully when that world
officially visits the country for the
Africa Cup of Nations tournament in
2013, it will be to celebrate an event.

Tom Taylor just wants someone in a
position of power to offer him free
tickets to the Africa Cup of Nations.
