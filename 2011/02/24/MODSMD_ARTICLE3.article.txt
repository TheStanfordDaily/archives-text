# Start-up buys college essays
## Stanford wary of plagiarism potential 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students looking for an extra buck
or two can now earn cash by uploading their
personal statements to the Essay Exchange. The
new website says it aims to give disadvantaged
high school students access to a cheap alterna
tive to college counseling, but University offi
cials are skeptical.
Started last August by three Harvard Busi
ness School alumni, the Essay Exchange pays $2
to current and former students at 25 elite uni
versities every time a prospective applicant
reads their admission essay.
Despite a slow start, the Essay Exchange
gained popularity by advertising on Facebook
and by word-of-mouth promotions from on
campus representatives. Since its launch, the
website has gathered approximately 700 essays,
including 128 essays from the Farm. Stanford is

the second largest contributor after Harvard.
The Essay Exchange's Stanford representa
tive, D'Shai Hendricks 'l4, said the majority of
these essays came from the current freshman
class.
"Initially, when I sent out the first e-mail,
most people were confused about what it was,"
Hendricks said. " Later, most people basically
understood it's three minutes of your time, and
it's an opportunity to make money."
"The [website] was founded on the premise
that college admission is unfair," said Essay Ex
change co-founder and CEO Rory O'Connor.
"Our goal is to make personalized college in
sight more accessible and more affordable."
According to O'Connor, part of the website's
success comes from the idea that quantity
makes quality.
"We offer a better selection," O'Connor said.
"The main advantage we have over books with
application essays is that our selection is grow
ing, and the options are changing all the time."
In fact, the website's virtual writing tutor is so
personalized that high school students can
search for personal statements that best match
their individual backgrounds. Students are
given a preview of each essay before they decide
whether or not to buy it. Individual essays can
be purchased for $7.50.
In the past, websites like the Essay Exchange
have been criticized for allowing plagiarism.
O'Connor, however, was confident that this
problem could be avoided. His website does not

allow users to copy, cut, paste or print personal
statements.
"We have talked to over 100 admission offi
cers," O'Connor added. "We're willing to work
with them so that all of the essays are in their
college admission department."
According to Stanford Director of Admis
sion Bob Patterson, representatives from the
Essay Exchange have not contacted the Univer
sity. He further noted that the website raises a
red flag for plagiarism.
"When we read completed essays, we are
able to discern if the essay was written by the ap
plicant by making connections with the addi
tional information the student provides," he
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
Patterson said the University is engaged in a
"discussion about what we want to do in the fu
ture" to combat plagiarism in the college appli
cation process.
One possibility is partnering with outside
vendors who run authenticity checks on the ad
mission essays, he said.
For others, the problem goes beyond plagia
rism, and some college counselors remain un
convinced by the Essay Exchange's stated pur
pose.
"I don't think the inspiration for it truly came
from any desire to level the playing field, since it
doesn't level the playing field in any substantive
way," Alice Kleeman, a college counselor at
