## Stanford, NYC describe vision for campus 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Universities across the globe
are going public to respond to
New York Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's invitation to create
an applied sciences campus in the
city. At the same time, school offi
cials and city representatives are
elaborating on their vision of a
New York City campus, as the
Mar. 16 deadline for "expressions
of interest" approaches.
The request for expressions of
interest, announced last Decem
ber, marks the first leg of a world
wide search for an institution that
will facilitate the expanding tech
nological sector.
While Columbia and New

York University are already lo
cated in the Big Apple, "there is
still room to grow," said Julie
Wood, vice president of public af
fairs at the New York City Eco
nomic Development Corpora
tion (NYCEDC).
NYCEDC research, which in
cluded extensive dialogue with
the business community and
other universities in the area,
showed that the city needed to
focus on three key elements. First
and foremost, the research under
lined the importance of technolo
gy-enabled jobs for future
growth. It concluded that strong
local research institutions were
the best means to achieve this. Fi
nally, the research indicated a
need to improve the city's aca

demic sources in science, technol
ogy, engineering and mathemat
ics (STEM) fields.
"Part of what has gotten us
through the recession better than
other cities around the country
has been ... our diverse econo
my, and we need to insure that the
city is home to a variety of indus
tries that can weather up-and
down cycles," Wood wrote in an e
mail to The Daily.
She said NYCEDC hasn't re
ceived any written proposals yet.
However, 20 schools from four
continents have voiced interest
byway of attending a program in
New York detailing the mayoral
staffs vision for the campus.
Cornell, Purdue, the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology

(MIT), New York University
(NYU) and the Indian Institute
of Technology in Mumbai have
publicly announced that they are
working on "expressions of inter
est."
"The several animating ideas
at work, in both the city's call for
proposals and the response of
other institutions, have long been
a hallmark of NYU's approach
and thinking," Lynne Brown, sen
ior vice president for university
relations and public affairs at
NYU, wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily.
"In many ways, the effort is al
ready an affirmation of the direc
tion NYU has already embodied
in its Global Network University,"
Brown said.
Stanford has tentatively thrown
its hat in the game.
"We haven't turned [an expres
sion of interest] in, but there are
people working on it," said Dean of
Engineering Jim Plummer. "It's not
a commitment; we're saying that
we're interested."

Stanford is looking to propose a
center that relies heavily on re
sources from the School of Engi
neering and the Graduate School of
Business. This vision corresponds
with the Big Apple's ambitions of
becoming a global center for tech
nical innovation.
Plummer said a New York City
campus would be an important ex
perimental opportunity.
According to Plummer, many
academics have toyed with the idea
that, in as little as 20 years, many of
the top universities will have re
mote campuses. Nevertheless, the

University is unsure whether or not
the Stanford culture itself can be
replicated elsewhere.
"To be honest, Stanford and
other top flight universities are
not lacking in opportunities to
build branch campuses," Plummer
said. "A number of us believe that
it will happen. Rather than try to
do this somewhere else in the
world, it's better to do it in this
country."
Still, the monetary costs of such
a development would be substan
tial, Plummer said. That cost has
yet to be determined by Stanford

and NYCEDC.The latter said that
New York City would apportion a
significant part of its annual budg
et for the project.
Once the first-round responses
are received, NYCEDC will main
tain constant communication dur
ing the evaluation process with "a
more targeted and specific Re
quest for Proposal" slated for re
lease this summer. Wood said.
Final decisions will be made by
the end of the year.
