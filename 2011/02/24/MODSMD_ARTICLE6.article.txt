## Rumsfeld criticizes Rice, Bush admins Memoir holds top officials responsible for Iraq war 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld levels criticism at top members
of the Bush administration, including cur
rent Stanford professor and former
provost Condoleezza Rice, in his new
memoir "Known and Unknown."
The memoir, released Feb. 7, contains
a comprehensive account of Rumsfeld's
life and political career, including his role
in the Iraq war while serving under
George W. Bush.
While Rumsfeld acknowledges some
tactical errors on his part, he also lays
blame at the feet of other high-ranking of
ficials. He takes aim at Rice in her capaci
ty as both national security advisor and
secretary of state, saying she did not push
the president to make firm decisions on
war strategy.
"The core problems the NSC (Nation
al Security Council) faced resulted from
the effort to paper over differences of
views," he writes.
According to political science profes
sor Kenneth Schultz, however. Rice's effi
cacy may have been impacted by an inter
nal power struggle between agencies.
"There were serious divisions within
the administration, particularly between
the Defense Department and State De
partment, and ultimately the people at
the Defense Department wielded the
bulk of influence over decision making,"
he said.
Furthermore, Schultz says, the concil
iatory nature of the national security ad
visor position limited Rice's ability to
make demands.
"It would have been Rice's job as na
tional security advisor to insure the presi
dent was getting views from different
players," Schultz said. "Her primary onus
was to coordinate information from dif
ferent agencies. The general view was that
the process was a bit dysfunctional."
Rice, who is also a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, declined to comment.
