## Rumsfeld criticizes Rice, Bush admins Memoir holds top officials responsible for Iraq war 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld levels criticism at top members
of the Bush administration, including cur
rent Stanford professor and former
provost Condoleezza Rice, in his new
memoir "Known and Unknown."
The memoir, released Feb. 7, contains
a comprehensive account of Rumsfeld's
life and political career, including his role
in the Iraq war while serving under
George W. Bush.
While Rumsfeld acknowledges some
tactical errors on his part, he also lays
blame at the feet of other high-ranking of
ficials. He takes aim at Rice in her capaci
ty as both national security advisor and
secretary of state, saying she did not push
the president to make firm decisions on
war strategy.
"The core problems the NSC (Nation
al Security Council) faced resulted from
the effort to paper over differences of
views," he writes.
According to political science profes
sor Kenneth Schultz, however. Rice's effi
cacy may have been impacted by an inter
nal power struggle between agencies.
"There were serious divisions within
the administration, particularly between
the Defense Department and State De
partment, and ultimately the people at
the Defense Department wielded the
bulk of influence over decision making,"
he said.
Furthermore, Schultz says, the concil
iatory nature of the national security ad
visor position limited Rice's ability to
make demands.
"It would have been Rice's job as na
tional security advisor to insure the presi
dent was getting views from different
players," Schultz said. "Her primary onus
was to coordinate information from dif
ferent agencies. The general view was that
the process was a bit dysfunctional."
Rice, who is also a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, declined to comment.
But history professor Jack
Rakove warns that Rumsfeld's
writings should be viewed with a
cautious eye,
"Historians are universally sus
picious of memoirs," Rakove said.
"The great danger of memoirs is
that they're inherently self-serving,
and they can be selective."
Rumsfeld does acknowledge
several of his own strategic mis
takes in his memoir. He writes with
regret that he did not stop L. Paul
Bremer, the chief administrator of
Iraq at the beginning of the war,
from disbanding the entire Iraqi
army, despite military recommen
dations to the contrary. The move
was part of a U.S. effort to undercut
Iraqi socialist influence after the
overthrow of Saddam Hussein
"I was told of Bremer's decision
and possibly could have stopped it,"

Rumsfeld writes.
Rumsfeld further admits that he
and other Bush officials overstated
the certainty that weapons of mass
destruction would be found in Iraq,
recalling in particular an instance
where he told a television reporter
the weapons were around Tikrit
and Baghdad.
"While I made a few misstate
ments in particular the one men
tioned above they were not
common and certainly not charac
teristic," he writes.
Accompanying the memoir is a
trove of previously classified docu
ments, released on Rumsfeld's web
site. They offer a glimpse into back
room policy discussions; one memo
from a senior Rumsfeld staff mem
ber, for example, reveals that Bre
mer told Rumsfeld of his decision
to disband the Iraqi army four days
before signing the order on May 23,
2003.

Rakove notes that these docu
ments hardly form a complete
record of the events that transpired
during Rumsfeld's time in office.

"What other documents are not
being released? Is the release selec
tive?" he said. "If a few documents
are missing, we're missing part of
the picture."
Schultz remarks that the book's
title, "Known and Unknown," is a
nod to the complexities of historical
documentation as well as the uncer
tainty that drove much of Rums
feld's decision making.
"A major critique of Rumsfeld's
policies is that the war planning
seemed to rely on very optimistic
assumptions of what would happen
[in Iraq]," he said. "These optimistic
assumptions led to the small de
ployment of forces and an unrealis
tic timetable for postwar rebuild
ing. A good leader knows that there
are uncertainties and there will be
unforeseen contingencies, and you
have to plan for that, not use uncer
tainty as an excuse for things having
gone wrong."
