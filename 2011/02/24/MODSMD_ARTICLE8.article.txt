## Graduate Student Council prioritizes finances 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Finances were the main order of business
at last night's Graduate Student Council
(GSC) meeting.
The body approved event funding for
three student groups and additional funds for
two Graduate Student Programming Board
(GSPB) events. GSPB requested $l5O for
beverages on Trivia Night and $2OO for Grad
Night Out, which is set to take place Mar. 11
at the Nuthouse. Both funding requests
passed.
In addition, the GSC discussed discrepan
cies that appeared on two groups' balance
sheets. GSC funding chair Krystal St. Julien, a
graduate student in biochemistry, said one

group requested funds for an event but actu
ally allocated the money to an entirely differ
ent one. A second group that had been grant
ed "thousands" of dollars for programming
expenses spent half of its allocation on food,
he said.
St. Mien declined to reveal the names of
either group. She said that the financial dis
crepancies have not been investigated, and
that they are not necessarily an attempt to de
fraud the ASSU.
The GSC discussed the best way to ascer
tain an explanation for the discrepancies, but
reached no resolution on the issue. One pro
posed solution, sending the groups before Ju
dicial Affairs, was discounted because of how
lengthy that process would be. Ryan Peacock,
a member of the executive cabinet and a grad

uate student in chemical engineering, ex
pressed a desire to keep the proceedings off
the record until the GSC had completed a full
audit of both groups' records.
The GSC also debated two bills. The first
sought to add three sections to Article IV of
the ASSU Joint By-laws. The sections are de
signed to clarify the role of the ASSU Solici
tors General. Jlie changes will make it easier
for students to file a grievance with the ASSU,
with the Solicitors General serving as repre
sentatives for either side in any case. The bill
passed with a 9-0-2 vote.
The GSC's second bill was a move to con
firm Neveen Mahmoud 'll as the ASSU's as
sociate financial manager, after the Financial
Manager Selection Committee nominated
her for the position. Mahmoud appeared be

fore the GSC and explained her experience
and qualifications for the position, as well as
the initiatives she sought to bring to the
ASSU. The GSC delayed the vote on Mah
moud's confirmation to next week's meeting.
Assistant commissioner for graduate elec
tions Jonathan Bakke, who is a graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering, delivered an
elections update at the end of the GSC's
meeting. Of the student groups requesting
Special Fees, only six are joint groups serving
both the undergraduate and graduate com
munities. Club Sports was the only joint group
required to petition for a Special Fees in
crease.
