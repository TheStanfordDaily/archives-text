# MARKS MY WORDS
## Stop ... the Ellipsis 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
In my feverish attempts to avoid
the pages and pages of reading I
have every week, f find myself
on Gchat with my friends all too
often. The other night, as 1 wiled
away the minutes of an all-too-long
study break, I paused . . . There
were so many ellipses! In contrast
to the academic paper pulled up on
my computer screen, the Gchat
window was characterized by more
three-letter acronyms, a lack of
proper capitalization and a host of
little dots clustered in groups of
three.

What is the new, evolving ellip
sis? To answer this question, think
about the extent to which we com
municate with the written word. Ig
nore the laments that students are
not writing as well as they used to; in
terms of the sheer amount of writ
ten communication, it seems as
though young adults today rely on
writing to talk to each other more
than they would have done a gener
ation ago. I've heard stories. Appar
ently, back in the day, if you were
writing to a friend, you were proba
bly writing a letter. You sat down
and spent a long period of time ar
ticulating your thoughts in a large
body of text.
Today, messages to friends travel
instantly and have consequently
grown shorter in length. Much
shorter. "Dinner?" "Party tonight?"
"Kk." As our writing is transmitted
more quickly to our friends, we have
simultaneously condensed the size
of our messages and altered the pat
tern of our writing. From what I've
observed, our conversational writ
ing more and more closely mirrors
the way we speak.
And now for the ellipsis. There
are, admittedly, several uses of the
ellipsis. I most frequently use the el
lipsis for, as it is described on
Wikipedia,"an unstated alternative
indicated by context." Let's say I
were watching the new music video
for "Hold It Against Me," and I
chose to tell someone, "That video
was ... interesting." My ellipsis be
trays that something else crossed
my mind first, that I caught myself
and opted not to say, "pretty creepy,
plus I don't think she's a very talent
ed dancer."

There is also the exasperated el
lipsis. In response to an outlandish
request that begs an answer of
"NO," an ellipsis implies something
akin to "are you serious?" or "what
do you think my answer to your stu
pid question is?" One morning on
Gchat, a frugal friend asked me if
she could have my quarterly alloca
tion of services provided by the
SHPRC. Then she asked whether I
could go and get them for her even
as she specified a list of brands and
flavors. She got a " ..." in response.
These are what I would deem
strategic ellipses, not to be confused
with the filler ellipses. In order to
define the filler ellipsis, allow me to

showcase the habits of Elon
(anonymous name). Elon uses A
LOT of ellipses. In any sort of writ
ten communication, be it messages
on Gchat, in e-mails with friends or
in texts, Elon refuses to use com
mas, semicolons, or even periods. A
typical paragraph written by Elon
contains about one ellipsis per six to
eight words.
What's the big deal, you ask? So
what if ellipses are his preferred and
only form of punctuation? If our
writing increasingly mirrors our col
loquial speech, which I think is true,
then the use of the ellipsis is a writ
ten expression of our pauses and si
lences in conversation. When speak
ing with a friend, no one is complete
ly fluid and graceful; we naturally
stumble for the next word, throw in
a couple "like"s and substitute ges
tures and sounds for real words.
Those are our spoken ellipses.
Here's the problem. Because our
day-to-day communication by writ
ing looks more and more like our
manner of speaking, there is un
doubtedly an influence by our writ
ing upon our speaking, especially
given that most of us text and Gchat
each other all day. Is our colloquial
manner of writing really starting to
affect our speech? Yes. Without a
doubt. Examples include: saying
"lol," saying "omg," saying "lmfao."
(Don't do this.)
The ellipsis is another example
of the way in which our writing
feeds our speech patterns. People
are starting to use the ellipsis when
they talk. This is manifested in sev
eral ways: pausing, using a lot of
filler words, playing up the "awk
ward" silence. A conversation starts
with a long, "Sooo ..." or contains
lengthy pauses; statements come
across hesitantly and lacking in con
viction; a conversation loses struc
ture when its participants are used
to trailing off...
I think we lose out when our con
versations are punctuated by el
lipses. We lose the habit of thinking
quickly on our feet, of being articu
late and of using the right word at
the right time. From an academic
standpoint, I guess this could harm
students' abilities in the realm of
oral presentations. From any sort of
conversational standpoint, it makes
conversations lackluster, slow and
prolonged. Would you want to read
a paragraph full of ellipses? I would
n't want to have a conversation like
that either.

quickly on our feet, of being articu
late and of using the right word at
the right time. From an academic
standpoint, I guess this could harm
students' abilities in the realm of
oral presentations. From any sort of
conversational standpoint, it makes
conversations lackluster, slow and
prolonged. Would you want to read
a paragraph full of ellipses? I would
n't want to have a conversation like
that either.

In my feverish attempts to avoid
the pages and pages of reading I
have every week, f find myself
on Gchat with my friends all too
often. The other night, as 1 wiled
away the minutes of an all-too-long
study break, I paused . . . There
were so many ellipses! In contrast
to the academic paper pulled up on
my computer screen, the Gchat
window was characterized by more
three-letter acronyms, a lack of
proper capitalization and a host of
little dots clustered in groups of
three.

What is the new, evolving ellip
sis? To answer this question, think
about the extent to which we com
municate with the written word. Ig
nore the laments that students are
not writing as well as they used to; in
terms of the sheer amount of writ
ten communication, it seems as
though young adults today rely on
writing to talk to each other more
than they would have done a gener
ation ago. I've heard stories. Appar
ently, back in the day, if you were
writing to a friend, you were proba
bly writing a letter. You sat down
and spent a long period of time ar
ticulating your thoughts in a large
body of text.
Today, messages to friends travel
instantly and have consequently
grown shorter in length. Much
shorter. "Dinner?" "Party tonight?"
"Kk." As our writing is transmitted
more quickly to our friends, we have
simultaneously condensed the size
of our messages and altered the pat
tern of our writing. From what I've
observed, our conversational writ
ing more and more closely mirrors
the way we speak.
And now for the ellipsis. There
are, admittedly, several uses of the
ellipsis. I most frequently use the el
lipsis for, as it is described on
Wikipedia,"an unstated alternative
indicated by context." Let's say I
were watching the new music video
for "Hold It Against Me," and I
chose to tell someone, "That video
was ... interesting." My ellipsis be
trays that something else crossed
my mind first, that I caught myself
and opted not to say, "pretty creepy,
plus I don't think she's a very talent
ed dancer."

There is also the exasperated el
lipsis. In response to an outlandish
request that begs an answer of
"NO," an ellipsis implies something
akin to "are you serious?" or "what
do you think my answer to your stu
pid question is?" One morning on
Gchat, a frugal friend asked me if
she could have my quarterly alloca
tion of services provided by the
SHPRC. Then she asked whether I
could go and get them for her even
as she specified a list of brands and
flavors. She got a " ..." in response.
These are what I would deem
strategic ellipses, not to be confused
with the filler ellipses. In order to
define the filler ellipsis, allow me to

showcase the habits of Elon
(anonymous name). Elon uses A
LOT of ellipses. In any sort of writ
ten communication, be it messages
on Gchat, in e-mails with friends or
in texts, Elon refuses to use com
mas, semicolons, or even periods. A
typical paragraph written by Elon
contains about one ellipsis per six to
eight words.
What's the big deal, you ask? So
what if ellipses are his preferred and
only form of punctuation? If our
writing increasingly mirrors our col
loquial speech, which I think is true,
then the use of the ellipsis is a writ
ten expression of our pauses and si
lences in conversation. When speak
ing with a friend, no one is complete
ly fluid and graceful; we naturally
stumble for the next word, throw in
a couple "like"s and substitute ges
tures and sounds for real words.
Those are our spoken ellipses.
Here's the problem. Because our
day-to-day communication by writ
ing looks more and more like our
manner of speaking, there is un
doubtedly an influence by our writ
ing upon our speaking, especially
given that most of us text and Gchat
each other all day. Is our colloquial
manner of writing really starting to
affect our speech? Yes. Without a
doubt. Examples include: saying
"lol," saying "omg," saying "lmfao."
(Don't do this.)
The ellipsis is another example
of the way in which our writing
feeds our speech patterns. People
are starting to use the ellipsis when
they talk. This is manifested in sev
eral ways: pausing, using a lot of
filler words, playing up the "awk
ward" silence. A conversation starts
with a long, "Sooo ..." or contains
lengthy pauses; statements come
across hesitantly and lacking in con
viction; a conversation loses struc
ture when its participants are used
to trailing off...
I think we lose out when our con
versations are punctuated by el
lipses. We lose the habit of thinking
quickly on our feet, of being articu
late and of using the right word at
the right time. From an academic
standpoint, I guess this could harm
students' abilities in the realm of
oral presentations. From any sort of
conversational standpoint, it makes
conversations lackluster, slow and
prolonged. Would you want to read
a paragraph full of ellipses? I would
n't want to have a conversation like
that either.
