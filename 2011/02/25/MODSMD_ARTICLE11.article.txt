## FREE FALLING STANFORD DROPS CLOSE GAME AT OREGON STATE 
### NIC REINER-PARRA 
In the highest-scoring game the
men's basketball team has played all
season, Stanford coughed up a sec
ond-half lead and fell on the road
Thursday night at Oregon State, 87-
80. With the loss, the Cardinal extend
ed its losing streak to four games and
solidified its position in eighth place
in the Pac-10 as the regular season
winds down.

Oregon State (10-16,5-10 Pac-10)
snapped its own four-game losing
streak with the victory, and its 87
points were the highest total the team
has put up in the Pac-10 this season.
The Beavers were on fire all night,
making a crisp 62 percent of their
shots from the field. They also had a
very balanced attack, with five players
scoring in double figures, led by soph
omore guard Jared Cunningham, who
had 21 points on 6-of-8 shooting, and
senior guard Calvin Haynes, who
chipped in 14.
Oregon State's freshman guard
Ahmad Starks scored the game's first
basket to take a 2-0 lead at 19:38, but
Stanford, powered by junior guard Je
remy Green's hot three-point shoot
ing, went on an early 14-4 run to lead
by eight with 16:27 left in the first half.
After Oregon State cut the lead to 14-
12 with 15 minutes to go, the Cardinal
(13-14,6-10) reeled off another big 11-
0 run to take a commanding 25-12
lead halfway through the first period.
The Beavers fought back to within
two, trailing only 33-31 with 3:27 left,
but the Cardinal was electric from be

yond the arc in the first half, making
eight three-pointers and extending its
lead to 41-35 at the break.
Green, coming off his first
mediocre game in over a month, got
hot early. After last Saturday's 11-
point showing in the loss against USC,
he nearly reached that total in the first
three minutes, scoring eight points off
two three-pointers and a layup he
finished the game with 24 points off 9-
14 shooting.
But Green's excellent night was

not enough to repel the Beavers, who
began to take control in the second
half. Oregon State took just its second
lead of the game (49-47) with 14:40
left in the second half, pushing ahead
on two free throws from forward Joe
Burton. The teams traded blows the
rest of the way, with Stanford appear
ing to retake control twice with leads
of 60-52 at the 12-minute mark and
65-58 with 10 minutes to go.
