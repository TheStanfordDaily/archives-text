# CARD ENTERS PAC-10 PLAY
## 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off claiming the title at the
ITA National Team Indoor Cham
pionships in Charlottesville, Va.,
this past weekend, the women's ten
nis team looks to keep the momen
tum rolling with matches against
two Pac-10 rivals, the Oregon
Ducks and the Washington State
Cougars, this weekend.
Not only will Stanford (9-0) have
the opportunity to continue its un
defeated season, but it will also have
the chance to increase its home win
ning streak of 169 consecutive vic
tories on the Farm, an NCAA
record.
After a 4-0 sweep of No. 16
Arkansas in the first round of the
ITA tournament last week, the No.
1 Cardinal went on to defeat No. 5

Michigan 4-1 the next day. In the
semifinals, the team zoomed past
No. 3 North Carolina, setting up a
much-anticipated final between the
Cardinal and No. 2 Florida, who
Stanford beat 4-3 in the NCAA fi
nals last year. Sophomore Stacey
Tan clinched a hard-fought three
set match, propelling Stanford to
the championship by the score of 4-
2 last Monday.
"I was so inspired watching all
my teammates fight for each point
of the match," Tan said. "That really
helped me work that much harder
to do my best in my match. The vic
tory was a great confidence builder
for our team moving forward."
It's back to the grind now for

traveled to Virginia arrived back on

campus Tuesday after hours of wait
ing due to delays and canceled flights
on the East Coast. Sophomore Mal
lory Burdette, who played in the No.
2 slot over the weekend, described
the 30-plus hour journey back to
Stanford as "a break to catch up on
work, but now we have returned and
are focusing on upcoming matches.
"We usually focus on ourselves as
opposed to worrying about who we
are playing," Burdette continued.
"Preparation for this weekend will be
like any other. We only lost the dou
bles point one day, but we will defi
nitely go back to the drawing board
with doubles and hopefully tune our
singles play up. I think that we have
played a lot of tennis over the past
week, so it's important to remain
physically healthy as well."
This is especially true for Bur
dette, who was out for the first three
matches of this season. Since return
ing to the court just a few weeks ago,
she has improved steadily and this
weekend marked her first time play
ing at No. 2 for the Cardinal this sea
son.

"Although I was a little nervous,"
Burdette said, "having three solid
performances was a huge step for
ward for me confidence-wise going
into this weekend."

She also hopes that Stanford can
capitalize off the fact that Oregon

and Washington State both practice
indoors, yet will be forced to play out
side in the matches this weekend on
the Farm. Wind frequently becomes a
factor when players aren't used to
compensating for it.

TTie Ducks have a 6-2 record enter
ing conference play, although they
have yet to beat a ranked opponent
and lost to No. 24 Oklahoma and No.
73 Minnesota earlier in the year. But
they have won two straight matches
and have gotten big performances
from their freshmen. As always, Ore
gon will be a tough Pac-10 opponent
that Stanford cannot afford to under
estimate.

Likewise, the Cougars are sitting
pretty at 8-2 in non-conference
matches, but recently lost a close
match to No. 44 Boise State and have
just one win over a ranked opponent,
an upset of No. 73 BYU in Utah.They
went on a five-game win streak to
open the season at home, but are 3-2
in their last five matches. More press
ingly, they will be playing their third
match in three days including two
against top-five opponents when
they arrive at the Farm on Saturday.
The match against Oregon is slat
ed for today at 1:30 p.m. with the sec
ond match against Washington State
scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m.
With rain (and potentially the first
snow in the Bay Area in decades) in
the forecast, both matches at the
Taube Family Tennis Center are sub
ject to delays and postponement.

and have gotten big performances
from their freshmen. As always, Ore
gon will be a tough Pac-10 opponent
that Stanford cannot afford to under
estimate.

Likewise, the Cougars are sitting
pretty at 8-2 in non-conference
matches, but recently lost a close
match to No. 44 Boise State and have
just one win over a ranked opponent,
an upset of No. 73 BYU in Utah.They
went on a five-game win streak to
open the season at home, but are 3-2
in their last five matches. More press
ingly, they will be playing their third
match in three days including two
against top-five opponents when
they arrive at the Farm on Saturday.
The match against Oregon is slat
ed for today at 1:30 p.m. with the sec
ond match against Washington State
scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m.
With rain (and potentially the first
snow in the Bay Area in decades) in
the forecast, both matches at the
Taube Family Tennis Center are sub
ject to delays and postponement.
