### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fresh off claiming the title at the
ITA National Team Indoor Cham
pionships in Charlottesville, Va.,
this past weekend, the women's ten
nis team looks to keep the momen
tum rolling with matches against
two Pac-10 rivals, the Oregon
Ducks and the Washington State
Cougars, this weekend.
Not only will Stanford (9-0) have
the opportunity to continue its un
defeated season, but it will also have
the chance to increase its home win
ning streak of 169 consecutive vic
tories on the Farm, an NCAA
record.
After a 4-0 sweep of No. 16
Arkansas in the first round of the
ITA tournament last week, the No.
1 Cardinal went on to defeat No. 5

Michigan 4-1 the next day. In the
semifinals, the team zoomed past
No. 3 North Carolina, setting up a
much-anticipated final between the
Cardinal and No. 2 Florida, who
Stanford beat 4-3 in the NCAA fi
nals last year. Sophomore Stacey
Tan clinched a hard-fought three
set match, propelling Stanford to
the championship by the score of 4-
2 last Monday.
"I was so inspired watching all
my teammates fight for each point
of the match," Tan said. "That really
helped me work that much harder
to do my best in my match. The vic
tory was a great confidence builder
for our team moving forward."
It's back to the grind now for
Stanford, as the eight players who
traveled to Virginia arrived back on
