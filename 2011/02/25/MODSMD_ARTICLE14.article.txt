# Jaffe takes NCAA over NBA all day, everyday
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
The NBA trade deadline just
passed, and the league has
been turned upside down
thanks to a number of
blockbuster, and in some
cases head-scratching, trades. I've fol
lowed the NBA much more closely
than I have in the past few years, and
after watching a slam dunk over a car
and absurd performances from all
kinds of players, I have come back to
the simple conclusion I've known all
along.
College basketball is better than
the NBA. There, I said it.
Yes, I know that NBA players are
the best of the college game and that
the talent level in the NBA is un
questionably better than in college. I
know that the thoroughly pointless
one-and-done rule has taken away
from the continuity of the college
game and harmed everyone in
volved (except John Calipari). And I
know that most sports fans ignore
college basketball until March Mad
ness and that players like Leßron
James and Blake Griffin are only
boosting the NBA's popularity.

But no matter how much I watch
the NBA, I can't help but think that
the pure basketball involved is worse
than in college. And recently I've fi
nally discovered the reason why
NBA basketball is not as fun to me:
NBA players are too athletic and too
talented.

Of course, in professional sports,
the appeal is supposed to be that the
players you see are the best in the
world at what they do. The difference
with basketball, though, is that talent
can lead to a less-aesthetically pleas
ing result.

Case in point: Leßron. He is
clearly one of the best players in
NBA history and maybe the most
athletically gifted individual ever to
play basketball. Some of the dunks
and midair adjustments he makes
are breathtaking. Still though, if you
watch a whole game of Leßron's,
what do you see? Maybe a couple
disgusting dunks in transition
(against weaker defense than most
middle-school players) and about 20
fadeaway 24-footers.
The long fadeaway jumper is ex
tremely difficult and impressive, but
I can't say it is particularly fun to
watch. Sure, one or two can make
you marvel at the player's skill, but
when five possessions in a row in
volve one player taking the ball up
the floor, dribbling outside the three
point line for 18 seconds and then
taking a contested jumper, it doesn't
particularly matter to me if the shot
goes in or not, because I've already

changed the channel.
See, when NFL players play real
ly well, they make pinpoint passes,
miraculous catches, crazy jukes and
shoestring tackles. When MLB play
ers play really well, they make diving
catches, disgusting pitches and hit
monster home runs. The way basket
ball is set up. NBA players have no
incentive to play team basketball
when they can just do it all by them
selves.
Compared to college basketball,
NBA players have less time to shoot,
get all the advantage on offense (the
rules take away zone defense, under
the-basket charges, etc.) and are ca
pable of making ridiculous shots, so
there's no need for traditional plays.
And no, "iso" doesn't count as a play.
While college basketball might
not give you as many eye-popping
feats of athleticism or staged dunk
contests (jumping over a car: cool,
but not that cool), it gives you some
thing more. Players set off-ball
screens (yep, they exist), make the
extra pass, cut to the basket... you
know, they actually play basketball.
Other than the occasional high
light-reel play, what else does the
NBA provide over college? All I see
are a whole lot of egos.
I mean, what's the better atmos
phere for a basketball game: hun
dreds of students jumping and
screaming in unison, or Jack Nichol
son screaming at the refs about a call
he doesn't understand? What in the
NBA can match the passion of fight
ing to get off the bubble? Don't even
say trying to get into the playoffs.
What can match a Duke-UNC game?
Lakers-Celtics isn't even close.
I'm sorry, but even the most excit
ing NBA Finals game doesn't feel as
passionate or as intense as a Cinderel
la run through March Madness, or
even a 15-seed hanging with a two
seed. That's the one thing about col
lege sports that pro sports can never
match, and the NBA doesn't get any
where close.
Oh, and I didn't even mention
traveling.
