# CARD LOOKS TO REBOUND
## Stanford hopes to avenge loss at ITAs 
### ALEX ECKERT 
The No. 7 Stanford men's tennis
team travels to Los Angeles this
weekend to face a pair of formida
ble Pac-10 rivals in No. 5 UCLA and
No. 9 USC.
The Cardinal (8-2) is hoping to
bounce back from two tough losses
at last week's ITA National Indoor
Championships, where it went 1-2
against some of the top teams in the
nation in Florida and Georgia.
However, the Los Angeles schools
may provide even stiffer competi
tion.
Stanford will first take on UCLA
(9-1) this afternoon.The Bruins had
a strong showing at last week's tour
nament, going 2-1 and beating the
same Florida team that handed the
Cardinal its first loss of the season
just two days earlier.The Bruins will
be looking to prove that they are
the team to beat in the Pac-10 this
season.
Then, at 1 p.m. tomorrow, the
Cardinal will face two-time defend
ing national champion USC. The
Trojans (8-2) will certainly be
amped up for the match after Stan
ford took the first matchup between
the two rivals 4-3 in a hard-fought
match last weekend. Plagued by in
juries early in the season, it is tough
to say how good this year's version
of the Trojans can be.
Head coach John Whitlinger has
no illusions about this weekend.
"Any time you go to L.A., no
matter what kind of team I've been
a part of over 25 years, it's always a
challenge," Whitlinger said.
"They're just very good; they play
well at home, and they have their
crowd."
While he recognizes that the
matches won't be easy, Whitlinger
views this weekend as another op
portunity for the team to gain valu
able experience against elite teams.

"I'm looking forward to two very
competitive, tough matches. When
you play top-10, top-five competi
tion, it can only help to give you an
idea of where your team's at."
According to Whitlinger, Stan
ford still has plenty of work to do
after losing to Florida and Georgia
at last week's tournament, but he
believes the losses will help moti
vate the team going forward.
"Every match we played in Seat
tle was very close and could've gone
either way," Whitlinger said. "I
don't think they've lost confidence.
I think they're just a little upset we
couldn't pull off all the matches that
we played."
The Cardinal hopes to carry the
consistent play of defending NCAA
singles champion junior Bradley
Klahn (16-5 record this year), soph
omore Denis Lin (12-4) and senior
Greg Hirshman (12-3) into this
weekend. Hirshman appears to
have turned a corner in his game, as
he is currently riding an impressive
four-game win streak.To beat teams
of UCLA and USC's caliber, how
ever, all of the players will need to
step up.
While matches between top
teams can be indicative of the sea
son to come, Whitlinger was also
wary of putting undue emphasis or
pressure on these early-season con
tests.
"Like I tell the guys, you don't
get too high with the wins or too low
with the losses, so no matter what
happens, we're trying to get better
and improve and get ready for
May," he said.
The NCAA men's tennis season
is a long one, and as one of the top
teams in the nation, Stanford has
chosen to focus on the long-term
goal of winning an NCAA champi
onship.
That being said, this weekend's
matches feature traditional Pac-10
rivalry hype combined with the
usual excitement of top-10
matchups.
