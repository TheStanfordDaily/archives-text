## Student store gets new space Ribbon-cutting ceremony at noon 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford Student Store opened the
doors to its new home in Tresidder Union
today. Preparations for the store's launch
have been in the works since summer of
2010 and will culminate in a ribbon-cutting
ceremony at noon.
According to project manager Kelly
Rohlfs, the total cost of the new Student
Store was $297,000.
"Design began in June 2010, and con
struction started October 2010," Rohlfs
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "We had
expected to complete construction in early
January but ran into problems that were a
result of previous renovations."
Raj Bhandari M.S. 'lO, CEO of Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE), which
oversees the Student Store, said the proj
ect was held back due to construction re
quirements and the need for permit ap
proval.
"Looking at the project, we ended up a
little bit late but still fairly within the scope
of what we imagined it to be," he said.
The delay, in fact, may prove to be a
business-sawy plan.
"We made a strategic decision to open
up [during] Parents' Weekend," Bhandari
said.
He hopes to see "parents come join
their students exploring the new store for
the first time."
Walking into the new Student Store,
customers will notice several prominent
features. One such feature is the introduc
tion of pivoting display doors, which were
custom-designed to showcase merchan
dise and to keep the store secure during
closing hours.
According to Bhandari, the Student
Store also features "a monitor display
demonstrating life here at Stanford."
"We designed the store so it could be a
retail incubator," said Peter
Claassen, project manager at Hill
house Construction Company, Inc.
Project planners designed the
store to give its managers "the op
portunity to do different merchan
dising," Claassen said.
While classic Stanford apparel
will remain on the shelves, the Stu
dent Store is diversifying its mer
chandise.

"We're definitely expanding; we
have a lot of new stuff," said store
manager Olivia Witter 'l3. "We
have men's and women's items that

are little trendier, a little bit more
vintage, a little bit more fashion
able than just our classic sweat
shirts."

Student input played an impor
tant role in this respect and in oth
ers.

"Working with the architect, the
students made all the decisions re
garding the layout of the store, dis
play cabinets and walls, colors and
lighting," Rohlfs said. "They even
suggested adding the new door to
the back patio which was a great
idea.
"They also made decisions on
how to spend their money, for ex
ample, using carpet in the store
rather than adding funds to the
project."
Nevertheless, planning for the

store came with several complica
tions.

Rohlfs noted that dealing with
the original terrazzo floor was the
biggest challenge of the construc
tion process.
"After removing the old carpet
in the lounge area, we discovered
the floor needed a lot of costly re
pairs that exceeded the project
budget," Rohlfs said. "We struck a
balance by repairing and refinish
ing the terrazzo in the halls and
placing carpet in the store."
"It's been a process, definitely,
but it's rewarding to see the store
now," Witter said.

ASSU and SSE celebrated the
store's completion in a launch
party last night.
"I don't think that many people

understand that the Student Store
is completely, 100 percent student
run and that all of the proceeds go
back to student groups," Witter
said. "It's a non-profit organiza
tion; I think that's just something
special about it that sets it apart
from the Bookstore."
"I think the new location will
help people recognize us more on
campus," she added.
Bhandari expressed similar op
timism about the new store, which
will resume regular business hours
starting Monday. The store is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
"Our goal is to be the showroom
of Stanford," he said.
