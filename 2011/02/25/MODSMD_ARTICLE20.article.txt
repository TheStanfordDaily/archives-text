## Oscar Snubs

hear their names called in the Kodak Theatre when they announce the winner, some won't even hear theirs listed with the nomi
nees. Intermission is here to lend a consoling back rub to those sadly snubbed by Oscar with a coveted spot in our weekly Top 5.

With the 83rd Annual Academy Awards airing this Sunday, Feb. 27, we can
anticipate the customary mix of glitz, glamour and stars. But while a lucky few will

1

Actor: Ryan
Gosling,
"Blue Valentine"

It seems unfair to honor Michelle Williams but not
Gosling when their performances relied so heavily each
other. Williams rightfully deserves her nomination, but
her exasperated Cindy wouldn't be half as compelling
without Gosling's frustrating yet endearing Dean.

Director:
Christopher
Nolan,
"Inception"

Nolan is overdue for a directing nod after his near-perfect
track record of mind-bending hits. "Inception" was the

Supporting
Actor:
Andrew Garfield,
"The Social
Network"

Andrew Garfield was the
heart and soul of "The
Social Network." Without
his complex blend of
cockiness and vulnerabili

ty to ground it, the film's humanity

would have been lost some
where in between Sorkin's fast

paced dialogue and Trent
Reznor and Atticus Ross's
dark ambient score.

Animated

"Tangled"

addition to the Disney canon. While it may have had a shot at a
Best Animated Feature nom in a weaker year, it'll just have to settle
on a nom in the Best Original Song category (for "I See the Light")
instead.

"Tangled" was a surprisingly pleasant and thoroughly entertaining
