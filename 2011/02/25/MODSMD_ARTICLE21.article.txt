## Guitar Zero 
### 
When I was a sophomore
in high school, the orig
inal Guitar Hero
changed my life. Like many other
Stanford undergrads I've seen at
drunken rock sessions, I felt like a
god as I raced through expert mode
with that plastic, click-clacky guitar
in my hands. Sure, it was simple and
it was silly, but it was something
totally new, and it opened the flood
gates for a whole generation of
would-be losers to joyously kid
themselves into feeling musically
competent. Forgive me for saying so,

but it was really a beautiful
moment for gaming.
Things have changed since
then. Just last week, mega-publisher
Activision which immediately got
on board with the small-time Red
Octane after the first game sold over
1.5 million copies announced the
unceremonious death of the "Hero"
franchise in a corporate earnings
statement.
So what happened?
The truth is, Activision had it
coming. When you release a stagger
ing 19 "hero" games in half a decade,
fail to provide a solid online solution
for updating and importing songs,
gouge prices on sets of minimally
upgraded peripherals, saturate the

market
with garbage like last

year's Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock
(Metacritic 72) and drag five entire
studios into working on one proper
ty, your brand name's reputation will
go to hell, and so will your sales.
People get laid off, gamers get shod
dy products and whole segments of
the industry crumble to pieces. It's
not a pretty picture, but with big
name publishers like Activision,
Electronic Arts and Übisoft, it's
becoming all too common.
I don't want to see that happen

to intellectual property that I care
about, and I don't want the industry
to thrive on iteration more than inno
vation. So in the interest of thought
experiments and, well, venting my
frustration, I have some advice to
offer for a couple of franchises that
have seen better days.
Let's start with the Microsoft
exclusive, Fable a series that often
finds itself in the company spotlight.
It's always suffered from a bit of an
identity crisis, but with its third
installment, Fable has backed itself
into a painfully paradoxical rut.

Lionhead tried to make an epic,
sprawling RPG accessible to everyone
and their mother, and in "streamlin
ing" the genre they managed to
remove the HUD, menus, meaningful
character growth and virtually any
gameplay innovations.
Lead designer Peter Molyneux
made his name by jumping from idea
to idea with every game he made, like
the PC classics Populous and Black &
White. The downloadable market has
made this business model more

appealing than ever, and Lionhead

would do well to work on smaller

projects. It's worked out fantastically
for the like-minded innovators over
at Double Fine Productions, which
spreads small design teams over mul

tiple, bite-sized projects at once.
How about this one? Final
Fantasy. It needs no introduction, but
it does need a serious makeover. Last
year's 13th entry in the vaunted
Japanese role-playing franchise
looked beautiful and sold fairly well,
but it disappointed series veterans
with its painful linearity. That game
just had a direct sequel announced,
while the series' foray into the online
space continues to puzzle gamers
with the abysmal Final Fantasy XTV
(Metacritic 49).

When series creator Hironobu
Sakaguchi was still at Square Enix,
Final Fantasy games were less about
visual splendor, featuring open and
epic worlds while walking a delicate

line between exploration and deep
storytelling. We can't expect this for
mula to work perfectly in the HD era,
but Square Enix would please a lot of
gamers by taking a few pages from its
own history books and from the
open-ended, western RPGs that are
dominating this generation.
It's not impossible to keep a
franchise healthy over a long period
of time. Just look at The Legend of
Zelda, a hallowed franchise that cele
brated its 25th anniversary just last
Monday. Nintendo doesn't fool

around with outsourced development
studios; they only release a game
when they're good and ready, and
they've kept the same core of talent
producer Shigeru Miyamoto,

director Eiji Aonuma and composer
Koji Kondo for almost 20 years.
With only a few missteps (see: Link's
Crossbow Training and those awful
interactive cartoons on the Phillips
CD-i), the franchise has consistently
showcased new hardware and added
gameplay innovations while staying
true to a simple formula and main
taining its loyal fan base.
Not every franchise can be like
Zelda, But even so, Activision's rough
handling of Guitar Hero should stand
as a reminder for other publishers that
quantity can never replace quality.

to idea with every game he made, like
the PC classics Populous and Black &
White. The downloadable market has
made this business model more

appealing than ever, and Lionhead

would do well to work on smaller

projects. It's worked out fantastically
for the like-minded innovators over
at Double Fine Productions, which
spreads small design teams over mul

tiple, bite-sized projects at once.
How about this one? Final
Fantasy. It needs no introduction, but
it does need a serious makeover. Last
year's 13th entry in the vaunted
Japanese role-playing franchise
looked beautiful and sold fairly well,
but it disappointed series veterans
with its painful linearity. That game
just had a direct sequel announced,
while the series' foray into the online
space continues to puzzle gamers
with the abysmal Final Fantasy XTV
(Metacritic 49).

When series creator Hironobu
Sakaguchi was still at Square Enix,
Final Fantasy games were less about
visual splendor, featuring open and
epic worlds while walking a delicate

line between exploration and deep
storytelling. We can't expect this for
mula to work perfectly in the HD era,
but Square Enix would please a lot of
gamers by taking a few pages from its
own history books and from the
open-ended, western RPGs that are
dominating this generation.
It's not impossible to keep a
franchise healthy over a long period
of time. Just look at The Legend of
Zelda, a hallowed franchise that cele
brated its 25th anniversary just last
Monday. Nintendo doesn't fool

around with outsourced development
studios; they only release a game
when they're good and ready, and
they've kept the same core of talent
producer Shigeru Miyamoto,

director Eiji Aonuma and composer
Koji Kondo for almost 20 years.
With only a few missteps (see: Link's
Crossbow Training and those awful
interactive cartoons on the Phillips
CD-i), the franchise has consistently
showcased new hardware and added
gameplay innovations while staying
true to a simple formula and main
taining its loyal fan base.
Not every franchise can be like
Zelda, But even so, Activision's rough
handling of Guitar Hero should stand
as a reminder for other publishers that
quantity can never replace quality.
