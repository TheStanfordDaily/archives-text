## Guitar Zero 
### 
When I was a sophomore
in high school, the orig
inal Guitar Hero
changed my life. Like many other
Stanford undergrads I've seen at
drunken rock sessions, I felt like a
god as I raced through expert mode
with that plastic, click-clacky guitar
in my hands. Sure, it was simple and
it was silly, but it was something
totally new, and it opened the flood
gates for a whole generation of
would-be losers to joyously kid
themselves into feeling musically
competent. Forgive me for saying so,

but it was really a beautiful
moment for gaming.
Things have changed since
then. Just last week, mega-publisher
Activision which immediately got
on board with the small-time Red
Octane after the first game sold over
1.5 million copies announced the
unceremonious death of the "Hero"
franchise in a corporate earnings
statement.
So what happened?
The truth is, Activision had it
coming. When you release a stagger
ing 19 "hero" games in half a decade,
fail to provide a solid online solution
for updating and importing songs,
gouge prices on sets of minimally
upgraded peripherals, saturate the

market
with garbage like last

year's Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock
(Metacritic 72) and drag five entire
studios into working on one proper
ty, your brand name's reputation will
go to hell, and so will your sales.
People get laid off, gamers get shod
dy products and whole segments of
the industry crumble to pieces. It's
not a pretty picture, but with big
name publishers like Activision,
Electronic Arts and Ãœbisoft, it's
becoming all too common.
I don't want to see that happen
