## A 						real taste of India

India controls more than 40 percent of the
nearly three billion dollar world spice mar
ket. India's concentration in spice agricul
ture is driven by the demands of its cuisine
India consumes 90 percent of what it grows.
Junnoon continues the tradition of flavorful
cooking and pairs it with real culinary talent
to produce a fantastic dining experience. There
are vast regional differences in Indian cuisine
that make Junnoon hard to categorize, but it
can be described as an eclectic, modern Indian
restaurant incorporating elements from
throughout the sub-continent. Fortunately, the
geographic differences are expertly navigated
and everyone, vegetarian or omnivore, should
be able to find something he or she enjoys.
The restaurant manages to have an attrac
tive decor without being intimidating. In gen
eral, Junnoon is best for a nice dinner with a
good friend or perhaps a second date.
Cooking a thick piece of meat is among
the more difficult tasks in the kitchen; high
temperatures for short periods help the meat
retain moisture but can end up searing it and
leaving the inside raw, while lower tempera
tures ensure thorough cooking but can dry the
meat out. Junnoon masterfully handles the
challenge with both red and white meats as

well as fish. The Chef's Award-Winning
Halibut, despite its less-than-humble name, is
certainly one of the strongest dishes on the
menu. The halibut is cooked perfectly and
served with a coconut-ginger sauce that is
divine. A small mound of fluffy semolina acts
as a sponge to help collect the last drops of
ambrosial sauce. The Basil Malai Chicken
Tikka is unbelievably juicy and tender. The
accompanying cold dip carries a bit of pep
pery kick that contrasts well with the chicken.
And the Tandoori Lamb Chops, succulent in
their own right, are plated with amazing mint
chutney that compliments both the red meat
and the accompanying mashed potatoes.
Junnoon is also able to produce several
strong vegetarian options to balance its meat
selection. The Baby Corn Saag is tasty and not
too heavy; the baby corn provides an interest
ing variation in texture. The Goan Cauliflower
and Ginger Soup is subtle but a secret gem.
The top notes are almost entirely cauliflower,
but you exhale a pleasing ginger perfume.
Junnoon also does excellent variations on
Indian vegetarian street food that make for

some very pleasurable eats. For example,
Junnoon's Signature Tangy Semolina Shells,
high-end Pani Puri, are beautifully plated and
have an array of textures in each bite that give
them an incredible mouth-feel. The Veggie

Frankie Wrap, a
refined version
of a typical
street sandwich,
is scrumptious
and savory; the

complex flavor
profile really separates it from its quotidian
origins.
Junnoon offers a variety of naans, some
of which are substantial enough in their own
right and others meant to compliment its
selection of raitas and chutneys (dips). The
Onion-Pepper Kulcha is fairly hearty with a
nice bit of crunch from the onions. The
Classic Naan and Lachha Paratha each have
their own fluffiness and subtly sweet tones that
make them delicious but allow a raita and
chutney topping to stand out. The Fresh
Cranberry Chutney is delectable and perfectly
balances the sweetness of the cranberries with
sour tamarind and mustard seed spice. The
Garlic Chili Chutney is fantastic, although it is

not as spicy as advertised; it has a pro
nounced garlic flavor that harmoniously
collaborates with dried mangoes to produce
a wonderful spread. The Spinach Raita is
not particularly exciting but may save your
life should you order the Shrimp Vindaloo.
The Shrimp Vindaloo, perhaps the hottest
dish on the menu, provides the fire neces
sary for those looking for that experience in
Indian food. The entrees intensity comes on
slowly, and the leftover sauce begs to be
scooped up with any leftover naan or
paratha.

Junnoon has managed to assemble a
menu that is extremely versatile; fans of
Indian food will certainly leave satisfied, while
the less adventurous can find comfort in
some of the more modern adaptations. After
I recently broke the $2O barrier at the CoHo
for lunch, I've decided to make the lunch spe
cial for Stanford students at Junnoon part of
my usual rotation. Junnoon is "definitely
worth trying" and absolutely don't forget
to try the Warm Carrot Halwa for dessert.
