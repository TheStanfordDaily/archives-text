The red couch came from a dumpster.
Well, to be fair, it came from the free
store of sorts that is the Ditch That
Dumpster campaign. So, yes, it's recycled. In
fact, with that story in mind, one could very
well think that the scribbles in black Sharpie
which cover the armrests come from its past
owners. Except they're not scribbles: they're
autographs from the performers on The Red
Couch Project, a new student initiative begun
last year in Kimball Hall which aims to pro
mote musical performance on campus. So
don't be afraid to sit on it in fact, be excited.

The setting is Kimball, third floor, in a
corner single facing Campus Drive. Roughly
once each week, a Stanford student performer
sits on the red couch, surrounded by recording
equipment, and plays an intimate 15-minute
gig which is subsequently lightly edited and
uploaded onto the student group's You Tube
page. The masterminds behind the project are
Emma Sedivy'l2, artistic director, Stephen
Henderson 'll, technical director, and Jeffrey
Gerson 'l2, publicity man
ager. The project has fea-

tured notable campus acts such as Nimbleweed
and Jamaica Osorio.
Inspired by the concept of NPR's Tiny
Desk Concerts, informal gigs behind All Songs
Considered host Bob Boilen's desk, Red Couch
was originally christened Kimball Tiny Couch
Concerts. It has since moved away from the
image of a single-dorm event and toward a
more encompassing image, not just across
campus, but across the global networks
attached to social media.
"The idea is to get the artists themselves
involved with the marketing of the event," Jeff
explained. "The strength of the event lies in the
personal ties the performer has."
Take Ohioan Rebecca Richardson 'l2, for
example. Richardson had had no previous
recording experience before she appeared on Red
Couch. Once her 15-minute video was uploaded
onto You Tube and a Facebook marketing cam
paign begun, viewership of Red Couch's
