The red couch came from a dumpster.
Well, to be fair, it came from the free
store of sorts that is the Ditch That
Dumpster campaign. So, yes, it's recycled. In
fact, with that story in mind, one could very
well think that the scribbles in black Sharpie
which cover the armrests come from its past
owners. Except they're not scribbles: they're
autographs from the performers on The Red
Couch Project, a new student initiative begun
last year in Kimball Hall which aims to pro
mote musical performance on campus. So
don't be afraid to sit on it in fact, be excited.

The setting is Kimball, third floor, in a
corner single facing Campus Drive. Roughly
once each week, a Stanford student performer
sits on the red couch, surrounded by recording
equipment, and plays an intimate 15-minute
gig which is subsequently lightly edited and
uploaded onto the student group's You Tube
page. The masterminds behind the project are
Emma Sedivy'l2, artistic director, Stephen
Henderson 'll, technical director, and Jeffrey
Gerson 'l2, publicity man
ager. The project has fea-

tured notable campus acts such as Nimbleweed
and Jamaica Osorio.
Inspired by the concept of NPR's Tiny
Desk Concerts, informal gigs behind All Songs
Considered host Bob Boilen's desk, Red Couch
was originally christened Kimball Tiny Couch
Concerts. It has since moved away from the
image of a single-dorm event and toward a
more encompassing image, not just across
campus, but across the global networks
attached to social media.
"The idea is to get the artists themselves
involved with the marketing of the event," Jeff
explained. "The strength of the event lies in the
personal ties the performer has."
Take Ohioan Rebecca Richardson 'l2, for
example. Richardson had had no previous
recording experience before she appeared on Red
Couch. Once her 15-minute video was uploaded
onto You Tube and a Facebook marketing cam
paign begun, viewership of Red Couch's


COURTESY VINNEY LE
You Tube channel increased exponen
tially thanks to heavy viewership in her
home state. The same effect was appar
ent when the project formed a part
nership with the Stanford Soundtrack,
with an opportunity for one of the
performances to be featured as a spe
cial track on the compilation. Viewers
were asked to vote for their favorite

performance by "liking" it on
Facebook. With the incentive of having
their recording on a formal release,
performers probably contributed to
the spike in Red Couch's number of
Facebook friends, which increased to
485 during the voting stage.
But the real magic of Red Couch
does not come from its popularity on
the Internet (although it has cultivat
ed a fan base which spans as wide as
the BOSP campuses). Although the
organization is definitely invested in
bringing the experience of live per
formances to the virtual world, the
strength of the organization lies in
the ease and comfort the artist finds
in the setting. The project strives for a
feeling of veracity in the recordings
according to Henderson, the back
ground noise from the natural envi
ronment of a dorm isn't removed
during the editing, because it would
take away from the real experience.
The intention is to create a deliber
ately unpolished sound which show

cases the performers as they really
are. In its intimacy, TRCP represents
the more laid-back, refreshing energy
of a live set than what you'd be able
to get at on-campus venues like the
CoHo. The focus is on creating an
accessible environment in which the
invisible boundary between audience
and performer embodied by the ele
vated stage dissolves. Red Couch
instead creates a community of musi
cal appreciation that lasts not only for
the duration of the performance, but
is preserved in the digital media
which define our generation. Red
Couch manages not only to present
artists at their best, but also to attract
its audience members in their natural
habitat: the Internet.
One of the goals of the project is
to capture the musical scene of
Stanford as experienced by the stu
dents, and it really has. Not only has
it created a much-needed personal
space for performance, but it has cre
ated a middle ground for busy
Stanford students to experience the
wealth of musical ability around
them. "Good music should be lis
tened to," Henderson said. And so it
shall be even if it's on You Tube.
