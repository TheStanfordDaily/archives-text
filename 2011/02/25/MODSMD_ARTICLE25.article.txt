Somewhere, and at any
given moment, a host of
blues-lovers swoons over

Adele. At just 22, the
singer/songwriter has almost sin
gle-handedly incorporated soul into main
stream music. With a powerful voice and artful
composition, Adele speaks to music lovers of
all backgrounds through her introspective bal
lads. Her second studio album "21" flawlessly
continues a reign of sophistication for the mas
terful artist.

"21" wastes no time on frilly opening
interludes. The first track and single, "Rolling
in the Deep," jumps right into the heart of the
album. Bolstered by a thumping bass, a driving
guitar strum and a host of background singers,
Adele warns, "There's a fire starting in my
heart." The track is followed by another of the
strongest of the album, "Rumour Has It,"

which attacks a former paramour and his poor
choice of substitute.

Clearly, "21" has a common theme. After
releasing "19," her debut album focusing on the
wistful nuances of breakups, Adele let her anger
ferment. Two years and 11 tracks later, her emo
tions have finally found an outlet; the album
smolders as song after song addresses the count

less problems with men as Adele sees them.
In proportion to the accusatory lyrics, "21"
hosts a number of bittersweet pieces as well.
"Do You Remember" is a gorgeously mournful
ballad ruminating on a failed relationship, while
"Set Fire to the Rain" is more frustrated than
angry, an upbeat song that helplessly wonders
why everything went wrong. One of the star
components of the album, "One and Only,"

pleads with a man to realize her love for him;
reminiscent at first of Otis Redding, the piece
digresses into a 1960s soul-sister-esque chorale,
spotlighting the singer's sorrowful crooning.
"21" ends on a pretty note; "Someone Like

You," a piano driven work of art, closes the
album with a wistful goodbye to her object of
desire and, perhaps, her hopelessly conflicting
emotions regarding him.

In every way, "21" is an astoundingly
sophisticated album. Adele refuses to pepper her
lyrics with catchy euphemisms to attract heart
broken preteens; from the first beat, she throws
out accusations and fights dirty. "21" features no

electronic sounds to construct the perfect dance
party song. Instead, she sticks to jazz instru
ments. Whether the songs are piano driven,
most noticeably in "Turning Tables," or steered
by gentle guitars, as in her cover of The Cure's
1989 single,"Love Song,""2l" stays grounded in
the world of naturally produced sound.
The only downfall of the album is its
monotony in theme. At 22, Adele creates music
far beyond her years; but of course, she is only
22 and still retains that typical, wholehearted
focus on men. While her approach is more
sophisticated than most, and she clearly has no
kitschy, cliched love stories at the forefront of
her mind, Adele might benefit from a broader
range of topics. However, she plays the role of
the scorned lover wonderfully, leaving "21" not
nearly as annoying as albums of other song
writers of the same age.

Mainstream as her music is, Adele refuses
to become mainstream herself. "21" is a brutal
ly honest album that stays true to her soulful
style. Never one to futilely chase pavements,
Adele's refined musical sense plants her firmly
on a path to success. She might be unconven
tional, but that voice and those lyrics will take
her anywhere she wants to go.
