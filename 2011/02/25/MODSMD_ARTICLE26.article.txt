cc -w- -y nknown" (2011), featuring a juicy
I cast and gripping suspense, is a
V/ compelling rendition of the arche
type of one man's quest to discover his true iden
tity. The film does have some immediately obvi
ous, albeit minor, setbacks, including unnecessar
ily lengthy scenes and extensive similarities to the
movie "Taken" (2008), in which "Unknown" star
Liam Neeson also played the lead.
American biology professor Martin Harris
(Liam Neeson) flies to Berlin for a conference,
accompanied by his wife Elizabeth (January

Jones). Upon arrival, he discovers that he left his
suitcase at the airport, and rushes back in a cab
driven by Gina (Diane Kruger). However, a fate
ful accident occurs on the road the cab

plunges into the river. Harris survives, but dis
covers that he has been seamlessly replaced by an
imposter not even his own wife recognizes

him anymore. With no one to turn to but Gina,
Martin has no choice but to involve her in his
dangerous quest to reclaim his identity.
After watching the trailer, viewers are struck
by the film's plethora of unanswered questions.
Who is the imposter? Who is pulling the strings
backstage and why? The answers, unfolding
over a nail-biting 113 minutes, exceeded my
wildest expectations. At first glance, the premise
of the film is slightly unconvincing—profes
sional assassins are somehow unable to kill a uni
versity professor, and an imposter manages to
fool Martin's own wife but the second part
justifies it all. It's a conspiracy and it just
might blow your mind.
Even the subplot a romance between
Martin and Gina is suspenseful. Martin
waltzes into Gina's otherwise ordinary life and
pretty much ruins it all for her. The audience is
tempted to believe that he is the worst thing to
ever happen to her, but is he really? The ques
tionable existence of an unlikely romance con
tributes to the uncertainty in the film. Would
Martin choose his wife, to whom he is fiercely
loyal, or would he reciprocate the interests of

Gina, the girl who saved his life?
Starring some well-known actors, includ
ing Liam Neeson ("Schindler's List"; "The
Chronicles of Narnia"), Diane Kruger ("Troy";
"National Treasure"), Bruno Ganz ("Downfall")
and Frank Langella ("Frost/Nixon."), this movie
does not want for acting chops. However, what
detracts from their strong performances is the
dearth of screen time accorded the supporting
roles, especially in comparison with Neeson's
character. Just like his previous thriller movie

"Taken," "Unknown" is a one-man show from
start to finish.
One last minor flaw is the protracted nature
of certain scenes intended to create suspense; for
example, it takes much too long for Martin to try
to grab a pair of scissors in a scene where he is
tied to a bed. This problem may simply be a defi
ciency in editing; fine-tuning aside, "Unknown"
is a movie worth watching.
