## In its second year, Snowchella brings fun, music to Stanford 
### â€” jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
Tickets for Coachella sold out
in record time this year, but
this Friday, Stanford students
can attend Snowchella for free. The
second annual Snowchella, hosted by
Stanford Concert Network, Sigma Nu
and Kappa Kappa Gamma, is this
Friday at 9:30 p.m. on Sigma Nu's
front lawn.
Playing at this year's event will be
OCD: Moosh + Twist, an up-and
coming rap group from Philadelphia.
Though OCD are still high school
seniors, they've been gaining a lot of
exposure on the East Coast and will be
talking with major record labels in San
Francisco while they're out west. Their
mixtape drops March 7.
"They have a sound similar to
Chiddy Bang," said Joey Mezzatesta
'l2, one of the event's coordinators.
He explained that, like Chiddy Bang,
OCD samples popular songs, includ
ing "some pretty cool alternative rock
music."
The next performers will be the
cleverly named Pance Party, a San
Francisco-based DJ group that recent
ly opened for Dada Life in San
Francisco.
And headlining the event will be
AC Slater, a DJ from Brooklyn who

runs his own record label,
Trouble and Bass, and has
just completed his world
tour.
"It should be different
from your typical frat
party," Mezzatesta said. "The
tempo last year was very
active, fun and upbeat.
People were really into the
music and what was going
on."
"[Snowchella] was very
successful last year," said
Abigail Andrews 'l3, anoth
er coordinator for the event.
"This year, we focused more
on publicity and made sure
our marketing materials
were top notch."
After Snowchella's
great success last year,
drawing in a crowd of
roughly a thousand music
loving Stanford students,
Sigma Nu and Kappa were
eager to bring the event
into its second year with a
bang. The Stanford
Concert Network provided
the majority of the funding
for the musicians, booking

fees, sound equipment and set up,
while Sigma Nu provided the venue.
Both the fraternity and Kappa pro
vided additional funding for the tent
and stage.
Snowchella doesn't just bring
music to campus; it also brings aware
ness. Like last year's event, Snowchella
2011 will benefit Support for
International Change (SIC), an organ
ization that trains American college
students in HIV education and places

them in Tanzania's rural villages. Many
Stanford students have spent their
summers working with SIC, which
offers students committed to global
health and rural development issues
the opportunity to work with local
HIV education workers and
Tanzanian university-level students.
Applications for working with SIC this
summer are open until March 4.
This year, the Snowchella coordi
nators are working on raising more

awareness about SIC by tabling in
White Plaza this week, selling t-shirts
and products made by HIV support
groups in Tanzania. "We're really mak
ing SIC a bigger component of our
publicity efforts this year, connecting
the cause with Sigma Nu and Kappa,"
said Andrews, Kappa philanthropy
chair.
