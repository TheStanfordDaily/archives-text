## 'Pillowman': Pitch black comedy 
### — eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
CC rr he Pillowman" is probably the funniest show
I've ever seen about child murder.
That's not to say that the show is a comedy—
though it was consistently clever and frequently hilarious,
this production is primarily a supremely dark drama, a
macabre exploration of the human psyche in which
author Martin McDonagh takes a hard look at life and
death and all the stuff that happens in between. It's a play
full of death and torture and hysteria, which makes it
extremely hard to pull off, but in my opinion, the
Stanford cast and crew fully succeeded.

"The Pillowman" is about an interrogation; a writer

and his mentally disabled brother are
accused of the murder of several chil
dren who were killed in very specific,
graphic ways ways that were careful
ly spelled out in a few of the protago
nist's stories. It opens with a fairly stan
dard good-cop/bad-cop routine and
then proceeds to mockingly acknowl
edge the cliche and cast off any sem
blance of comfortable familiarity,
plunging the viewer into unforeseen
depths of depravity.
The plot itself is fascinating, but
what sets this play apart is the relation
ships between characters, whose interac
tions constantly defy expectation. The
two cops seem to share the rapport of an
old married couple, all comfortable

familiarity and aggravation and nagging, juxtaposed with
the context of the excessively brutal torture that they are
visiting upon their prisoner. It is here that the show finds
much of its humor: between discussing several graphic
murders, the cops enter a harmless sort of domestic dis
pute. Still more intriguing is the growing relationship
between the writer-protagonist Katurian and his interroga
tors, which vacillated between oddly comfortable banter
and raw, violent cruelty. These very believable and consis
tently clever interactions gave the show a freshness and

provided for a startling contrast that
prevented the audience from growing
desensitized to the darkness of the
piece.
The most remarkable scenes for
me, though, were the scenes in which
Katurian's short stories are recited and
performed for the audience. The entire
mood would change; the lights would
be warm, and Katurian would glow
from within as he spoke even as,
behind him, children were tortured

and buried alive. The result was allur

ingly eerie and entirely effective.
Two actors stood out for me,
though the entire cast surpassed all
expectations. Nathaniel Nelson 'lis por
trayal of Michal was wholly compelling
and surprisingly believable, forcing us to
love the character despite being given
more than enough reasons not to.
Perhaps even more impressive was
Harley Adams 'l2 (playing Tupolski),
whose erratic mood swings could con
trol the room; the character's rapid
switches between convincingly friendly

laughter and white-hot rage were
incredibly unsettling.
"The Pillowman" is, in short, the
darkest dark comedy that you'll ever
come across. It weaves the perfect bal
ance of morbidity and humor, using
very real characters and the vehicle of
storytelling to explore the dark recesses
of the human psyche. If you're at all
intrigued by human nature or fascinat-

Ed by death, or at least have a decent
sense of humor, I urge you to head
over to Prosser Theater at 8 p.m. to
experience the show for yourself.
