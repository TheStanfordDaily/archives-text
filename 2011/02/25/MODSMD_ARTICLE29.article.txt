Sunday night, the NBA shocked
analysts when its annual All-Star
Game, billed as a battle of Leßron
vs. Kobe, drew 9.1 million viewers. The
largest audience since 2003 turned out
to watch their favorite athletes and
sports personalities face off in a familiar
arena but in unfamiliar combinations:

nowhere else will you see Kobe and
Carmelo playing on the same team.
Perhaps the viewers' own stake in the
game, since they voted for the initial line
up, compelled them to tune in.
On the same night, the newest sea
son of CBS's original flagship reality pro
gram, "The Amazing Race," also pulled
in 9.1 million viewers. However, that fig
ure represents a decline of 14 percent
from last year's season opener. The
decline is particularly compelling
because of this season's similarity to the
AH-Star Game: subtitled "Unfinished
Business," the newest installment brings

back 11 couples from previous seasons
to race once again for $1 million.
Coincidentally, or more likely not, this
comes as the reigning Emmy Award
winner for Outstanding Reality-
Competition Program "Top Chef?' hav
ing broken up the seven-year "Amazing
Race" monopoly, enters the latter half of
its own "all-stars" season. Though the
two shows are often lumped together as
the best quality reality programming,

their forays into the "all-star" setup have
highlighted their adherence to the tropes
of reality television.
"Top Chef All-Stars" began with 18
of the most beloved contestants from
the previous seven seasons of the cook
ing competition, from foxy Fabio to
crazy Carla. With the exception of som
melier Stephen from season one, all of
the contestants were unified in their
indisputable talent Marcel, despicable as
he maybe, was arguably more creative
than line cook Hon; Richard Blais s loss
to Stephanie, the first female winner in
season four, remains inexplicable. Both
"Top Chef" and "The Amazing Race"
claim that these new seasons were
designed to give second chances—to

redeem Carla for suvee-ing her meat,
Angelo for getting sick, Zev and Justin
for losing a passport, Margie and Luke
for not drinking enough water. Noble as
this justification may be, the short half
life of reality television fame leaves me
asking, do these "characters," because yes,
they are characters and not people, exist
outside the context of their respective
seasons? "Top Chef' in particular pur
ports to be a merit-based competition
having little to do with luck, but the very
conceit of the "All-Star" season seems to

be that merit itself, cooking talent,and a
subjective barometer of merit, a panel of
judges, are both fallible. The "All-Star"
season will vindicate one contestant and
leave 17 others all the worse for wear. For
example, jennifer, arguably the most
professionally successful contestant as
chef de cuisine under Eric Ripert, turned
combative and cocky in the new season.
Alternatively, "The Amazing Race:
Unfinished Business" incorporates those
motivations into the fabric of its show.
The returning teams have been selected
because their narratives as people and as
former contestants can carry over to a
new season. Because the contestants on
"The Amazing Race" offer no specific
talent other than determination and

enthusiasm, the "Unfinished Business"
model should work well because that
desire is amplified. The abstract chal
lenges don't change, a conceit that
enables the contestants to apply knowl
edge from the last cycle or deepens
their tragedy by repeating the same
mistakes. Ron and Christina, the
father-daughter pair plagued by ver
bal abuse in season 12, have returned
to beat their second-place finish and
their reputation of dysfunction.
Notably, the engaged or dating couples
whose relationships were in tatters at
the end of the race are missing from
the roster. There seems to be a con
tradiction in that omission that
the teams displaying the most
humanity in their season are not
invited back, but the teams stymied
by fate are. At the same time, howev
er, the teams are chosen for their

personalities, their status as stereo
types of humanity.
These reality shows are imple
menting what sports organizations
like the NBA, NFL and MLB discov
ered decades ago: that competition
needs narrative and characters to
heighten its cultural power. It's easy
enough within a single season to cre
ate by editing antagonism, triumph,
tragedy and suspense, but, when the
audience knows the strategy, why
should they come back? Now that
the novelty of purist reality competi
tion has worn off "Fear Factor"
was cancelled long ago, after all
alternative programming turns to the
pre-packaged narrative of character
and edges closer to scripted program
ming. The uncertainty of competition
does not command an audience with-
