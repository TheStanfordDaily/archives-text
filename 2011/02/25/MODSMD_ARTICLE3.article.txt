## Yu urges end to N. Korea nuke program 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Myung Hwan Yu, former South Kore
an minister of foreign affairs and trade, ar
gued that North Korea's nuclear weapons
program must be shut down at yesterday's
lecture on "The North Korean Nuclear
Program and Inter-Korean Relations."
Yu, a 2010-11 visiting scholar in the
Stanford Korean Studies Program, said a
nuclear-armed North Korea is a major
threat to its neighbors and to the United
States. His talk focused on North Korea's
nuclear program, its upcoming leadership
change and relations on the Korean
Peninsula.
North Korea detonated a nuclear
weapon in 2006 and conducted a second
test in 2009. Yu said North Korean leader
ship maintains that the country needs nu
clear weapons as a deterrent against for
eign aggression.
But he noted that more should be done
to ensure that North Korea is disarmed.
"It's time for all concerned to take
more aggressive and intrusive steps to
shut down Pyongyang's nuclear pro
gram," Yu said. "It is a direct threat to
most of East Asia as a whole and to the
United States, as well."
Yu highlighted recent aggression by
North Korea in the past year, including
last March when a torpedo struck a
South Korean naval ship. Forty-six per
sonnel were killed in the attack, which
Yu attributed to North Korea. Last No
vember, North Korea also shelled
South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island,
killing two soldiers and two civilians.
"Such reckless brinksmanship will
not change South Korea's policy to
ward the North and will further isolate
North Korea from the international
community," Yu said.
According to Yu, it is entirely up to
the North Korean leadership to decide
whether or not it wants a better rela
tionship with South Korea.
"North Korea is at a crossroad," Yu
said. "If it continues to keep the door
closed and develops nuclear weapons,
there will be no outside help, which
North Korea badly needs to feed its
people.

"The starving citizens will no longer
follow their leader, as nuclear weapons
cannot feed them."

Last Monday, Reuters reported
that a third nuclear test is likely. Ac
cording to South Korea's Yonhap
News Agency, tunnels are being dug

near the site where North Korea con
ducted its two prior tests.
When asked about the test, Yu said
the international community should do
more to discourage it, including impos
ing further economic sanctions.
Yu said there would likely be a lead
ership change in North Korea next
year. Kim Jong-un, son of the current
North Korean President Kim Jong-il,is

widely expected to become the coun
try's next ruler. Yu doubted North
Korea would see an uprising akin to
those that have happened in the Mid
dle East and North Africa.
"We cannot compare North Korea
with North African countries or other
countries," Yu said. "It's very unique. I
don't think we can expect to see a pub
lic revolt against the regime in North
Korea."
Among the students who attended
the event, at least one said he was un
moved.
"To be honest, the issue has been
done to death," said Desmond Lim 'l4.
"[The talk] wasn't revolutionary in
terms of its perspective."
But other students left the lecture
with the view that North Korea's neigh
bors should do more to stymie its nu
clear ambitions.
"I feel that more emphasis should
be on further actions," said Joshua
Wong'l4.
Lim said that with the unpre
dictability of the North Korean leader
ship, he expects more instability.
"I can't be optimistic, at least in the
short term," Lim said.
