### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Myung Hwan Yu, former South Kore
an minister of foreign affairs and trade, ar
gued that North Korea's nuclear weapons
program must be shut down at yesterday's
lecture on "The North Korean Nuclear
Program and Inter-Korean Relations."
Yu, a 2010-11 visiting scholar in the
Stanford Korean Studies Program, said a
nuclear-armed North Korea is a major
threat to its neighbors and to the United
States. His talk focused on North Korea's
nuclear program, its upcoming leadership
change and relations on the Korean
Peninsula.
North Korea detonated a nuclear
weapon in 2006 and conducted a second
test in 2009. Yu said North Korean leader
ship maintains that the country needs nu
clear weapons as a deterrent against for
eign aggression.
But he noted that more should be done
to ensure that North Korea is disarmed.
"It's time for all concerned to take
more aggressive and intrusive steps to
shut down Pyongyang's nuclear pro
gram," Yu said. "It is a direct threat to
most of East Asia as a whole and to the
United States, as well."
