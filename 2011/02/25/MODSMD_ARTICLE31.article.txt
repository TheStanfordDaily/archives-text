## ROXY SASS Music to which to bone 
### 
Roxy preaches two things in
life: never end a clause with a
preposition, and choose your
sexin' music carefully. A well-selected
playlist is vital in edging the mood
along nothing quenches a loin-fire
quite like a Pandora ad or an unfortu
nate shuffle selection. And for guest
bedfellows, nothing reveals more
about your host than his or her music
choice when the lights get dimmed.
Trust Roxy: Bone Thugs 'n' Harmony
may bring harmony when boning
thugs (sometimes Roxy likes to live
dangerously), but a myriad of other
choices abound below.
Tenacious D Fuck Her Gently
It's the anthem of a man who knows
how to do a woman correctly and
thoroughly. Roxy appreciates how Jack
Black walks her partner through all
the steps: first do it gently, then "some
smooches, too," but cap it off with a
round on the rough side. Well played.
Marvin Gaye Sexual Healing
This classic's power can never truly
fade, but it's also the obvious choice. If
this gets cued up on iTunes, expect the
basics performed with tender, lovin'
care, but no surprises here that is,
this is music for a gentle rocker, not a
shocker. Bonus: for the same senti
ment but suited for sex on the beach,
try Ben Harper's cover.
Joss Stone Put Your Hands On Me
For the woman who wants to send a
not-so-subtle message with a song
that's upbeat enough for afternoon
delight in springtime. Joss Stone belts
the titular command at least a dozen
times; if the intended hands are not

being put anywhere by the end of the
song, Roxy knows it's time to move
onto someone who obeys orders a lit
tle more readily (or maybe move onto
a song that's more direct: "Harder
Better Faster Stronger," perhaps?).
The National Green Gloves
If he plays this song while getting it on
(or any Radiohead, really), he'll proba
bly cry afterward. Consider yourself
warned.
R, Kelly Sex Planet
It's the best way to launch your liaison
into outer space. R. Kelly has a giant
rocket, and he wants to taste Roxy's
Milky Way. This song's puns get Roxy's
planets orbiting, and if played at the
proper moment, it'll make that comet
streak across the sky.
Jimi Hendrix —Catfish Blues
The legend's version of this blues stan
dard will make the ladies yelp along
with the growls of his guitar. Along the
same lines, encourage a silent girl to
loosen up with a little Girl Talk you
might even get her to twist and shout
if the mix samples some Fab Four.
The Beatles Why Don't We Do It
In The Road?
Roxy has. It was gritty —nothing like
curling your toes into asphalt and
walking away with a few extra scratch
es on your back. You're welcome to
toot Roxy's horn anytime.
