# CARDINAL CROWNED
## 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
The banner in the southwest corner of
Maples Pavilion is going to need another
update.

After a string of slow starts, Stanford
women's basketball came out firing against
Oregon State last night as it kicked off Par
ents' Weekend with a 73-37 blowout win at
home, clinching a share of its f Ith consecu
tive regular season title in the process. Stan
ford's big night was highlighted by 16 points
from forward Sarah Boothe, a redshirt

sophomore who was the standout amid a
number of Cardinal reserves that saw ex
tended playtime on Thursday.

"It definitely says something about con
sistency," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, reacting to the streak of con
ference titles. "We have excellent competi
tion in the Pac-10, and we're really proud of

having 11 championships. We want it by
ourselves, though, not with [second-place]
UCLA."
If another Pac-10 title wasn't enough,
the No. 2 Cardinal (25-2,16-0 Pac-10) made
history in a few other ways. Thursday's vic
tory over Oregon State (9-17, 2-13) was
Stanford's 59th in a row at home, tying a
program record. The win also secured the
top seed for the upcoming Pac-10 Tourna
ment in Los Angeles.
For a moment in the early going, the
Cardinal found itself down by a margin of
11-6 thanks to some timely three-point
shooting from Beaver guard Sage Inendi,
but the deficit wouldn't last long. Stanford
shut down the Beavers for the remainder of
the period, driving hard to the glass and
powering its way through a 17-0 run over
the next 11 minutes. On the only play that
saw a Beaver put the ball through the net
during that stretch, Earlysia Marchbanks
was called with a charging foul.
Stanford enjoyed a 29-14 lead at the half
a doubly impressive feat considering the
absence of its leading scorer, Nnemkadi
Ogwumike.The junior forward suffered an
ankle injury against USC last Friday and
hasn't played since.
VanDerveer wouldn't say if she would
be ready for Saturday, but indicated that

NOTES ! No. 2 Stanford clinched at least a share of its
11 th consecutive Pac-10 title with a 73-37 win over
Oregon State. They will square off against the visiting
Oregon on Saturday afternoon, with a full house ex
pected on Parents' Weekend. The Ducks come into
the game on a bit of an upswing after snapping a
seven-game losing streak with their first win this
month Thursday night over Cal.


LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
Freshman guard Toni Kokenis (31) drives in for two of her 10 points as the crowd at Maples
Pavilion looks on in Stanford's 73-37 blowout win over Oregon State on Thursday night.

her injury had nearly recovered.
"If it was the tournament, she'd be
playing," she said. "Her ankle looks
good, but I told her I want it 100 per
cent."

With Stanford's top forward miss
ing, a roulette of reserves filled in the
gaps for the Cardinal and kept OSU
on its toes. Seven players scored in
the first half alone a number high
er than OSU's total field goals in the
same period.
"Obviously, we depend a lot on
Kayla [Pedersen] and Jeanette
[Pohlen] and definitely Nneka, but
it's great to see people stepping

up," VanDerveer said. "They'll all
help us."
As she did on Sunday, sophomore
forward Joslyn Tinkle started in
place of the elder Ogwumike. Her
classmate, forward Mikaela Ruef,
saw 10 minutes of playing time in the
first half after averaging just 10.2
total minutes on the season, and
Boothe saw plenty of time at the low
post after coming off the bench and
going a perfect 3-for-3 in the first half.
"I told our team that we're an or
chestra, it's all about our whole team
being successful," VanDerveer said
about the reserves. "But tonight we
had a nice solo from Sarah Boothe.
She really finished inside."
Chiney Ogwumike put the team
on her back in the second, scoring
two crowd-pleasers in the first 60
seconds. That included a breakaway
layup after she recovered a loose
ball just beyond the Beavers' three
point line, a move senior point
guard Jeanette Pohlen emulated a
minute later.

Freshman guard Toni Kokenis lit
up the crowd as well, scoring a pair of
fast-break layups to bring the Stan
ford lead to 43-26. On the second of
those, the Illinois native made a lung
ing steal on a pass from Beaver guard
Alexis Bostick and dashed for the
left side of the hoop, dropping an
easy basket that had VanDerveer
pumping her fist on the bench.
Kokenis reached 10 points at 8:12,
making her the fifth Stanford player
to enter double digits.The only blem
ish on her record was a trio of sec
ond-half fouls.

Stanford slowed things down a bit
as its reserves took over, but contin
ued to play an open, perimeter-fo
cused game that cut the Beavers'

zone defense to pieces. Pohlen
scored a pair of threes in the half and
Pedersen added another, while Tin
kle and Sara James, a freshman
guard, each netted one. Their shoot
ing was dangerous enough to open
things up for the forwards, who did
the rest of the work. Stanford scored
eight layups in the second half and
shot 56.3 percent from the field.
The Cardinal will complete its
final two-game series against Ore
gon tomorrow at 2 p.m., and then
wrap up the regular season against
Cal next Thursday at 8 p.m. Both
games are at Maples Pavilion.
