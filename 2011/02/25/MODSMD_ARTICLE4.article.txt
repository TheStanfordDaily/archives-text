# CARDINAL CROWNED
## 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
The banner in the southwest corner of
Maples Pavilion is going to need another
update.

After a string of slow starts, Stanford
women's basketball came out firing against
Oregon State last night as it kicked off Par
ents' Weekend with a 73-37 blowout win at
home, clinching a share of its f Ith consecu
tive regular season title in the process. Stan
ford's big night was highlighted by 16 points
from forward Sarah Boothe, a redshirt

sophomore who was the standout amid a
number of Cardinal reserves that saw ex
tended playtime on Thursday.

"It definitely says something about con
sistency," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, reacting to the streak of con
ference titles. "We have excellent competi
tion in the Pac-10, and we're really proud of

having 11 championships. We want it by
ourselves, though, not with [second-place]
UCLA."
If another Pac-10 title wasn't enough,
the No. 2 Cardinal (25-2,16-0 Pac-10) made
history in a few other ways. Thursday's vic
tory over Oregon State (9-17, 2-13) was
Stanford's 59th in a row at home, tying a
program record. The win also secured the
top seed for the upcoming Pac-10 Tourna
ment in Los Angeles.
For a moment in the early going, the
Cardinal found itself down by a margin of
11-6 thanks to some timely three-point
shooting from Beaver guard Sage Inendi,
but the deficit wouldn't last long. Stanford
shut down the Beavers for the remainder of
the period, driving hard to the glass and
powering its way through a 17-0 run over
the next 11 minutes. On the only play that
saw a Beaver put the ball through the net
during that stretch, Earlysia Marchbanks
was called with a charging foul.
Stanford enjoyed a 29-14 lead at the half
a doubly impressive feat considering the
absence of its leading scorer, Nnemkadi
Ogwumike.The junior forward suffered an
ankle injury against USC last Friday and
hasn't played since.
VanDerveer wouldn't say if she would
be ready for Saturday, but indicated that
