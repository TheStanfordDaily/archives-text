# Showdown against No.3 Vandy looms
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Continuing what might be the
most grueling non-conference
schedule of any team in the country,
the Stanford baseball team heads
back out on the road to battle No. 3
Vanderbilt in a three-game series
that begins today in Nashville.
It's the No. 8 Cardinal's second
trip to the central time zone in a
week, after it opened the season with
a 2-1 series victory over No. 17 Rice,
and marks another tough test on the
national stage.
Vanderbilt (5-0) swept through
the San Diego schools in its opening
weekend, taking a three-game set
from the University of San Diego
while knocking off San Diego State
in a one-game affair. The Com
modores beat Belmont in a midweek
game on Wednesday, 6-2, but have
set their vaunted rotation to face off
against the Cardinal this weekend.
Junior right-handed ace Sonny
Gray will likely start the Friday
game for Vanderbilt, while the Car
dinal (3-1) will trot out sophomore
righty Mark Appel, who pitched four
strong innings in the season opener

against Rice. Gray had a rough first
inning, allowing three runs, but the
preseason All-American settled
down and didn't allow a hit the rest
of the way as he earned the win
against San Diego in a rain-short
ened game.
Saturday's pitching matchup
should feature either senior Taylor
Hill or junior Grayson Garvin for
the Commodores, facing off against
junior Chris Reed.The Stanford left
hander was roughed up in his first
start against Rice but had a very im
pressive summer in the Atlantic Col
legiate Summer League with a
miniscule 1.09 ERA through 33 in
nings â€”he was rated as the top
prospect in the league.
It will be a tough task against ei
ther Hill or Garvin, however, as both
pitched brilliantly in their openers at
San Diego. Garvin, a tall lefthander
from Suwanee, Ga., took a perfect
game into the seventh inning and
struck out 10 in 8.1 innings of work.
Hill, a righty from Old Hickory,
Tenn., looked equally impressive
after throwing 7.1 innings of five-hit
ball with eight strikeouts and just

one run neither pitcher issued a
free pass in 15.2 combined innings
of work.
The Commodores are a con
stant presence in the NCAA
Tournament, making it to the
past five NCAA Regionals under
manager Tim Corbin. Besides
their top-notch pitching, they
also return seven everyday
starters from a team that won 46
games last year. That includes top
hitters Aaron Westlake, Jason Es
posito and Anthony Gomez.
Juniors Esposito and Westlake
hit 12 and 14 home runs apiece
last year while both batting
above .300, and the sophomore
Gomez hit a team-high .379 en
route to being named a Colle
giate Baseball Freshman All-
American.
Stanford and head coach
Mark Marquess counter with
their own quartet of young guns,
led by two preseason All-Ameri
cans, sophomore shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger and freshman
outfielder Austin Wilson, along
with sophomore third baseman
Stephen Piscotty and sophomore
outfielder Jake Stewart.
Diekroeger hit a team-high

.356 and had 41 RBIs while being
named Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year; he is off to a good start this
year with seven hits in 16 at-bats.
His first home run of the year put
Stanford on top against Cal, and
he added an RBI single later in
the game.
The play of Wilson has also
met the lofty standards that ac
companied the highly touted out
fielder from Los Angeles to the
Farm. Wilson is currently tied for
second on the team in batting
with Piscotty, sporting a .429 bat
ting average to go with a home
run and four RBIs, all in games
against top-25 opponents.
The weekend series is just the
second between the two teams,
and Stanford holds a 3-1 all-time
edge thanks to a 2-1 series win in
2009. With both teams now sport
ing top-10 rankings, the rivalry is
likely to only grow more intense
this weekend as conference brag
ging rights are also on the line.
If the games are close, the Cardi
nal should get a boost from its
bullpen, which has allowed only
three runs in 16 innings so far.
First pitch on Friday will take
place at 2 p.m. PST, with Saturday's
game scheduled for a noon start
and Sunday's slated to begin at 11
a.m.
