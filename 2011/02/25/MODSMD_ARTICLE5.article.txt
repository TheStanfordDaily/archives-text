# Showdown against No.3 Vandy looms
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Continuing what might be the
most grueling non-conference
schedule of any team in the country,
the Stanford baseball team heads
back out on the road to battle No. 3
Vanderbilt in a three-game series
that begins today in Nashville.
It's the No. 8 Cardinal's second
trip to the central time zone in a
week, after it opened the season with
a 2-1 series victory over No. 17 Rice,
and marks another tough test on the
national stage.
Vanderbilt (5-0) swept through
the San Diego schools in its opening
weekend, taking a three-game set
from the University of San Diego
while knocking off San Diego State
in a one-game affair. The Com
modores beat Belmont in a midweek
game on Wednesday, 6-2, but have
set their vaunted rotation to face off
against the Cardinal this weekend.
Junior right-handed ace Sonny
Gray will likely start the Friday
game for Vanderbilt, while the Car
dinal (3-1) will trot out sophomore
righty Mark Appel, who pitched four
strong innings in the season opener

against Rice. Gray had a rough first
inning, allowing three runs, but the
preseason All-American settled
down and didn't allow a hit the rest
of the way as he earned the win
against San Diego in a rain-short
ened game.
Saturday's pitching matchup
should feature either senior Taylor
Hill or junior Grayson Garvin for
the Commodores, facing off against
junior Chris Reed.The Stanford left
hander was roughed up in his first
start against Rice but had a very im
pressive summer in the Atlantic Col
legiate Summer League with a
miniscule 1.09 ERA through 33 in
nings â€”he was rated as the top
prospect in the league.
It will be a tough task against ei
ther Hill or Garvin, however, as both
pitched brilliantly in their openers at
San Diego. Garvin, a tall lefthander
from Suwanee, Ga., took a perfect
game into the seventh inning and
struck out 10 in 8.1 innings of work.
Hill, a righty from Old Hickory,
Tenn., looked equally impressive
after throwing 7.1 innings of five-hit
ball with eight strikeouts and just
