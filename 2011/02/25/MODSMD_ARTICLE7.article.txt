## NEWS BRIEFS State awards Stanford $500k for energy use research 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown 
Stanford researchers will re
ceive $500,000 to finance studies
that analyze the effectiveness of
motivational strategies and aware
ness campaigns in cutting back res
idential energy use. The funds are
part of a nearly $3.5 million award
underwritten by the California En
ergy Commission's Public Interest
Energy Research program.
"California's strength comes
from the ability to invest in energy
research across the board," Commis
sioner Jeffrey Bryon wrote in a press
release.

At Stanford, researchers will
track energy use patterns with soft
ware, databases, Internet portals
and sophisticated home power me
ters. They intend to provide real
time energy use statistics via in
home displays, computers and
smartphone applications. The re
searchers will also test community

programs and financial incentives
in an effort to reduce energy con
sumption.
The findings are expected to
help utility companies and local
governments estimate what prac
tices and incentives best motivate
reductions in energy use. This, in
turn, will help the state reach its
goals for energy efficiency and
greenhouse gas reduction.
This grant will supplement the
$5,006,011 awarded to Stanford by
the U.S. Department of Energy
under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act and the
$790,871 provided by the Universi
ty for the project.
The Energy Commission has
doled out money to several other
California universities and compa
nies, including UCLA, UC-Merced
and Electric Power Group, LLC.
Projects funded elsewhere by
the award include the development
of hyper-efficient computer
servers, research on the efficiency
of light-duty vehicles, studies on
algae-based biofuels and an exami
nation of water demand in the pro
duction and consumption of trans
portation fuels.
