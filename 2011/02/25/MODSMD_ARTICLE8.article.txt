results on the East Coast.
Consider that Stanford's propos
al for a satellite engineering campus
envisions a scale about a tenth the
size of the School of Engineering
(which in 2008 had 241 faculty and
3,300 graduate students, compared
to 25 faculty and 375 graduate stu
dents planned for NYC). It is unclear
how this tiny branch would have any
significant impact on innovation in
New York. Silicon Valley start-ups
have collaborated with Stanford fac
ulty and students in unpredictable
ways thanks to the tremendous di
versity of research on the Farm;
scaled down an order of magnitude,
there is no guarantee that this effect
could be duplicated.
Martin Kenney writes in the in
troduction to his book Understand
ing Silicon Valley that former Stan
ford President Frederick Terman
"credited by many as the founder of
Silicon Valley, can better be under
stood as a catalyst and a booster in an
already prepared environment."
Historians credit Stanford with a
necessary but certainly not sufficient
role in the evolution of a Valley al
ready home to a burgeoning high
tech industry, entrepreneurial in
vestors, and an attitude of regional
cooperation. So inserting a miniature
Stanford into New York City will not
be a magic bullet to somehow recre
ate the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

As Stanford contemplates a po
tential branch campus in New York
City, publicly or privately it hopes to
accomplish all three of these objec
tives: presence, prosperity and public
impact, all without sacrificing the
elite quality of its education. While
the Big Apple seems to be low-hang
ing fruit offering financial assis
tance, world-class students and
Manhattan prestige Stanford
must sort out its priorities before
plunging ahead.

Enshrined in Stanford's Found
ing Grant, the University's mission is
twofold: to advance "learning... of
the highest grade" and to "promote
the public welfare." Therefore, any
other motivating factors behind the
NYC expansion should be sub
sidiary to maintaining excellent aca
demics and, as President Hennessy
urges, creating "more centers of in
novation" to serve the country. Nei
ther goal is assured by an unprece
dented expansion that could initially
strip the main campus of valuable
faculty and produce unpredictable

more course to the rest of their lives
(and often more than one career) to
contextualize why that "knowledge"
is, in fact, a myth. Our resources are
substantial despite the budget cuts,
and our visibility on campus is in
creasing. But our effectiveness is
limited as long as Stanford students
believe they don't need advising or
cannot benefit from the great wis
dom and experience that lies within

our faculty and staff advisors. As
marvelous as the "iDeclare" offer
ings were, and though they were
well-promoted by the leaders of the
sophomore class, a small percentage
of sophomores attended.
We are doing our part to make
advising one of the things that is best
about Stanford and which sets us
apart from our peers. We look for
