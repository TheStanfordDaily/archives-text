# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
Dear Editor,
Undergraduate Advising and Re
search (UAR),part of the VPUE, ap
plauds your interest in strengthening
academic advising at Stanford. Re
sponsible for virtually all undergrad
uate advising except that which takes
place within the major, UAR is in the
midst of a concerted effort to im
prove undergraduate advising by ed
ucating students about the values
and benefits of the advising re
sources available to them. We do this
within a national context our peer
institutions around the nation find
that advising is the thing that stu
dents are least satisfied with, as the
provost recently stated to the Faculty
Senate. We look forward to doing so
with support of faculty, staff and stu
dents as well as the upcoming SUES
recommendations and report. We
also do so with the knowledge that in
this, the third year in which all fresh
men and sophomores have had an
Academic Director, it is clear the
program has been a success and
made quite a difference in advising at
Stanford.

Elere is a viewpoint about advis
ing at Stanford that differs from that
which you presented in your editori
al. Today's juniors are the first class
of students for whom all had both an
academic director and a pre-major
advisor assigned at the outset of their
Stanford undergraduate experience.
Last spring, 71 percent of today's
sophomores told us that the guid
ance provided by academic directors
was "good" or "excellent." Today's
freshmen are required to meet with
their pre-major advisor quarterly, a
requirement not seen on this campus
since 2001. ASSU Senator Deepa
Kannappan commented to the Fac
ulty Senate last month on the benefit
of this change, stating, "[UAR] re
quired that freshmen had to meet
with their pre-major advisors before
they could even enroll for classes
every quarter ... By mandating
going to UAR's resources, freshmen
saw that those resources were use
ful." The number of undeclared jun
iors is going down dramatically, not
up, as you assert. (Class of 2011 had
over 500 undeclared juniors; Class of

2012 had over 300). In direct correla
tion to our enhanced advising efforts,
we expect Class of 2013 undeclared
junior numbers to be even smaller.
The recent partnership between
ASSU and UAR has been quite pro
ductive and led to a very successful
"iDeclare Week" for sophomores,
which will help contribute to that de
sired outcome. UAR is also develop
ing a Faculty Advisory Board that
will help us strengthen all that we do
in the name of advising. It will meet
for the first time next quarter. This
Faculty Advisory Board first agenda
item will be to consider how to
strengthen pre-major advising and to
bring more faculty into the process.
Pre-major advisors, academic di
rectors, AARC advisors and the rest
of us here in UAR in Sweet Hall are
in fact well-equipped to help unde
clared students navigate tough, big
picture decisions. It is the reason we
advise. Students will always talk to
peers,but if,in fact,students are "[ter
rified by the knowledge] that their
choice of classes and major will de
termine the course of the rest of their
lives," then it is better to talk with a
faculty or staff advisor who has had
