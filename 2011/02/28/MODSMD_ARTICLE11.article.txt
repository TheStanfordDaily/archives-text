## BREARING IT DOWN Digging up the dirt on campus composting 
### RUOKEYANG 
For many students, the
bright red and green com
post bins in campus dining
halls might simply be part
of a mundane, meal-time
ritual. It's easy to sort one's scraps
and napkins into separate bins, or
the same bin for the less conscien
tious, and not really know what hap
pens after the scraps are taken away.
However, according to Julie
Muir, an employee of Peninsula
Sanitary Service, Inc. (PSSI), the
University's recycling and waste
management company, students'
understanding of the composting
process is central to getting com
posting initiatives to take flight.
The compost journey starts in
large dumpsters at campus loading
docks, where the compost is picked
up every few days. The waste is then
transported offsite to the Newby Is
land Sanitary Landfill. There, or
ganic waste is ground up and stored
in open fields in windrows, or rows
100 feet long and eight feet tall, in
which the food decomposes for 180
days. Any impurities in the decom
posed product will surface as white
particles that can be removed be
fore the finished compost is sold,
Muir said.
"The facility has a zero-contam
ination policy that gives them the
ability to reject any load they don't
like," Muir added. "So we try our
best to keep our loads as clean as
possible."
Muir described how current
composting practices are much
greener than previous methods in
which compostable material was
simply sent to landfills.
"The food waste degrades but
leads to methane production that

goes into the air," Muir said. "In a
composting facility, we do this an
anaerobic way that creates some
carbon dioxide, but no methane,
which is a much more powerful
greenhouse gas than carbon diox
ide. In addition, we are making
something new out of the waste and
it goes back into the earth."
Despite the noble ends com
posting facilities help achieve, com
posting is still a business, and Stan
ford's participation isn't free. Al
though composting is less expen
sive for the University, which pays
$45 per ton of trash, composting
still typically costs between $3O and
$3B per ton. The finished decom
posed product is then sold by PSSI,
and Stanford typically orders some
compost from the company to use
in landscaping, mulching and com
munity gardens.
The smell of compost dumpsters
in one consideration that compli
cates the incorporation of compost
ing into residential life.
Surprisingly enough, these
"dumpsters rarely smell when ex
posed to air," Muir said, adding that
the dumpsters only smell when they
are exposed to anaerobic bacteria.
However, the most significant
obstacle with the current system,
Muir said, is that students are not
fully informed about which materi
als are truly compostable.
"We need some improvement
on the customer side in knowing
what should go where," she said.
Aditya Singh 'l3, head dining
ambassador, agrees that education
about composting is critical to the
success of the process. He has been
reaching out with other coordina
tors "in making compost bins more
user-friendly and making people
more aware of landfills and the en
vironmental impact," he said.

Recent changes to clarify the
composting process are pictures of
trash or compostable material post
ed on the distinct red and green
bins to further help direct students.
"If you have a list [of text], peo
ple wouldn't stop by to read it,"
Singh said.
One initiative Muir is currently
undertaking is to help inform cafes
and eateries on campus about
which composting options are
available to them and how they can
more effectively collect waste on
both sides of the counter.
The Green Living Council has
also been active in efforts to ex
pand composting through projects
such as Composting Awareness
Week. According to Graham
Provost 'l3, a member of the Green
Living Council, the student group is
also trying to bring composting to
student residences because much
waste in dorms is actually com
postable food.
"This quarter we have a number
of projects where students are put
ting compost bins in their resi
dences," Provost said.
Muir spoke to the potential of
the campus to become even more
efficient.
"From Stanford's perspective,
30 percent of what we throw into
the landfill is compostable," she
said. "We could take this 30 percent
now and turn it into compost if we
could get it out of the garbage
stream."
Just as the Stanford campus has
room to grow in its composting
journey, the state of California has
its own battle to face in taking re
sponsibility for waste. According to
Muir, California currently has more
composting facilities than any
other state. However, the state still
lacks enough facilities to manage

the amount of composting pro
duced within state borders.
Like her vision for sustainability
at Stanford, Muir is hopeful that
the state's composting capacity can
be expanded to match demand in

the near future.
"We expect to see a huge growth
in composting facilities," Muir said.

100 feet long and eight feet tall, in
which the food decomposes for 180
days. Any impurities in the decom
posed product will surface as white
particles that can be removed be
fore the finished compost is sold,
Muir said.
"The facility has a zero-contam
ination policy that gives them the
ability to reject any load they don't
like," Muir added. "So we try our
best to keep our loads as clean as
possible."
Muir described how current
composting practices are much
greener than previous methods in
which compostable material was
simply sent to landfills.
"The food waste degrades but
leads to methane production that

goes into the air," Muir said. "In a
composting facility, we do this an
anaerobic way that creates some
carbon dioxide, but no methane,
which is a much more powerful
greenhouse gas than carbon diox
ide. In addition, we are making
something new out of the waste and
it goes back into the earth."
Despite the noble ends com
posting facilities help achieve, com
posting is still a business, and Stan
ford's participation isn't free. Al
though composting is less expen
sive for the University, which pays
$45 per ton of trash, composting
still typically costs between $3O and
$3B per ton. The finished decom
posed product is then sold by PSSI,
and Stanford typically orders some
compost from the company to use
in landscaping, mulching and com
munity gardens.
The smell of compost dumpsters
in one consideration that compli
cates the incorporation of compost
ing into residential life.
Surprisingly enough, these
"dumpsters rarely smell when ex
posed to air," Muir said, adding that
the dumpsters only smell when they
are exposed to anaerobic bacteria.
However, the most significant
obstacle with the current system,
Muir said, is that students are not
fully informed about which materi
als are truly compostable.
"We need some improvement
on the customer side in knowing
what should go where," she said.
Aditya Singh 'l3, head dining
ambassador, agrees that education
about composting is critical to the
success of the process. He has been
reaching out with other coordina
tors "in making compost bins more
user-friendly and making people
more aware of landfills and the en
vironmental impact," he said.

Recent changes to clarify the
composting process are pictures of
trash or compostable material post
ed on the distinct red and green
bins to further help direct students.
"If you have a list [of text], peo
ple wouldn't stop by to read it,"
Singh said.
One initiative Muir is currently
undertaking is to help inform cafes
and eateries on campus about
which composting options are
available to them and how they can
more effectively collect waste on
both sides of the counter.
The Green Living Council has
also been active in efforts to ex
pand composting through projects
such as Composting Awareness
Week. According to Graham
Provost 'l3, a member of the Green
Living Council, the student group is
also trying to bring composting to
student residences because much
waste in dorms is actually com
postable food.
"This quarter we have a number
of projects where students are put
ting compost bins in their resi
dences," Provost said.
Muir spoke to the potential of
the campus to become even more
efficient.
"From Stanford's perspective,
30 percent of what we throw into
the landfill is compostable," she
said. "We could take this 30 percent
now and turn it into compost if we
could get it out of the garbage
stream."
Just as the Stanford campus has
room to grow in its composting
journey, the state of California has
its own battle to face in taking re
sponsibility for waste. According to
Muir, California currently has more
composting facilities than any
other state. However, the state still
lacks enough facilities to manage

the amount of composting pro
duced within state borders.
Like her vision for sustainability
at Stanford, Muir is hopeful that
the state's composting capacity can
be expanded to match demand in

the near future.
"We expect to see a huge growth
in composting facilities," Muir said.
