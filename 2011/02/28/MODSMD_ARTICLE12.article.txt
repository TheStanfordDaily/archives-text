## EDITORIAL Rethink the Conservation Cup 
### 
On Feb. 14, Stanford's Green
Living Council (GLC)
began its fourth annual
Conservation Cup, which will run
through March 15. The goal of the
Conservation Cup is, according to
the GLC website, "to use teamwork
and the competitive spirit to pro
mote sustainable behaviors while
engaging the campus community in
a fun event." This is clearly a laud
able goal, but there is little evidence
that the Conservation Cup as it is
currently structured is an effective
way to achieve it.
The Conservation Cup works by
comparing dorms' electricity and
water use during the contest period
to fall quarter averages, and reward
ing dorms showing reductions of 10
to 20 percent. Reductions of 10 per
cent earn all of a dorm's students free
metal water bottles, and reductions
of 20 percent earn all of a dorm's stu
dents free tickets to the California
Academy of Sciences (CAS). Last
year, Hammarskjold and 717 Do
lores achieved 20 percent reductions
while six other residences crossed
the 10-percent threshold.
If the Conservation Cup really
reduces energy and water use by 10
to 20 percent in so many dorms, than
that is truly an impressive achieve
ment. However, there is another less
favorable interpretation of the re
sults. Dorm electricity and water use
can vary by more than 10 percent
month-to-month during other times
of the year, so reductions of 10 per
cent during the competition period
might have nothing (or very little)
to do with adoption of better con
servation practices. Given the limit
ed awareness of the Conservation
Cup within the student body, ran
dom variance seems like the most
probable source of the observed re
ductions.

Since small residences tend to
have higher variability in their elec
tricity and water use, results arising

from statistical variation should
heavily bias the competition in
favor of small residences. Last year,
all seven of the eight winners were
either row houses or lake houses,
and the other was Marx House in
Suites. The winner, Hammarskjold,
houses only 26 students. This is a
strong indication that the results of
the Conservation Cup are largely
spurious. An alternative interpreta
tion is that smaller dorms can more
easily coordinate Conservation
Cup activities and motivate resi
dents. However, at least anecdotally,
it does not seem that many Resident
Assistants or 10 to 20 percent of row
house residents take the Conserva
tion Cup seriously. The GLC needs
to make sure that it is rewarding en
vironmentally conscious students,
not handing out free goodies to stu
dents living in houses with greater
energy use variance.
Another problem with the Con
servation Cup is the menu of prizes
it uses as incentives. Hundreds of
students received steel water bottles
after last year's competition for 10
percent energy and water use re
ductions. This might seem like a
"green" gesture, but according to
The New York Times, each recipient
would have to save at least 500 plas
tic cups by using his or her water
bottle to prevent the bottle from be
coming a net contributor of toxic
pollution to the ecosystem. Consid
ering the fact that most Stanford
students either own reusable water
bottles already or can access them in
dining areas, this is a wasteful prize
unbecoming of the GLC's mission.
The prize for 20 percent energy and
water use reductions is a trip to the
CAS in San Francisco. Getting
dozens of students to San Francisco
and back almost certainly negates
most or all of the energy savings re
sulting from the competition.

The GLC needs to consider ways
to motivate more students and better
direct its nearly $lO,OOO of students'
special fees money towards energy
conservation. With the money it will
spend on water bottles, CAS tickets
and publicity for the Conservation
Cup, the GLC could outfit hundreds
of hallways and rooms with motion
sensors that ensure lights are off
when they are not needed. This kind

of investment would decrease energy
use significantly, demonstrably and
permanently, rather than slightly, un
convincingly and temporarily.
The GLC must continue to pursue
its noble mission of promoting sus
tainable behavior at Stanford, but it
must also evaluate its work with a
more critical eye to ensure that its ef
forts (and students' money) are being
directed towards successful projects.
The Conservation Cup should only
see a fifth iteration if it can justify its
existence on statistical and environ
mental merits. If it can, it should be im
proved; if it cannot, it should be re
placed.

the GLC website, "to use teamwork
and the competitive spirit to pro
mote sustainable behaviors while
engaging the campus community in
a fun event." This is clearly a laud
able goal, but there is little evidence
that the Conservation Cup as it is
currently structured is an effective
way to achieve it.
The Conservation Cup works by
comparing dorms' electricity and
water use during the contest period
to fall quarter averages, and reward
ing dorms showing reductions of 10
to 20 percent. Reductions of 10 per
cent earn all of a dorm's students free
metal water bottles, and reductions
of 20 percent earn all of a dorm's stu
dents free tickets to the California
Academy of Sciences (CAS). Last
year, Hammarskjold and 717 Do
lores achieved 20 percent reductions
while six other residences crossed
the 10-percent threshold.
If the Conservation Cup really
reduces energy and water use by 10
to 20 percent in so many dorms, than
that is truly an impressive achieve
ment. However, there is another less
favorable interpretation of the re
sults. Dorm electricity and water use
can vary by more than 10 percent
month-to-month during other times
of the year, so reductions of 10 per
cent during the competition period
might have nothing (or very little)
to do with adoption of better con
servation practices. Given the limit
ed awareness of the Conservation
Cup within the student body, ran
dom variance seems like the most
probable source of the observed re
ductions.

Since small residences tend to
have higher variability in their elec
tricity and water use, results arising

from statistical variation should
heavily bias the competition in
favor of small residences. Last year,
all seven of the eight winners were
either row houses or lake houses,
and the other was Marx House in
Suites. The winner, Hammarskjold,
houses only 26 students. This is a
strong indication that the results of
the Conservation Cup are largely
spurious. An alternative interpreta
tion is that smaller dorms can more
easily coordinate Conservation
Cup activities and motivate resi
dents. However, at least anecdotally,
it does not seem that many Resident
Assistants or 10 to 20 percent of row
house residents take the Conserva
tion Cup seriously. The GLC needs
to make sure that it is rewarding en
vironmentally conscious students,
not handing out free goodies to stu
dents living in houses with greater
energy use variance.
Another problem with the Con
servation Cup is the menu of prizes
it uses as incentives. Hundreds of
students received steel water bottles
after last year's competition for 10
percent energy and water use re
ductions. This might seem like a
"green" gesture, but according to
The New York Times, each recipient
would have to save at least 500 plas
tic cups by using his or her water
bottle to prevent the bottle from be
coming a net contributor of toxic
pollution to the ecosystem. Consid
ering the fact that most Stanford
students either own reusable water
bottles already or can access them in
dining areas, this is a wasteful prize
unbecoming of the GLC's mission.
The prize for 20 percent energy and
water use reductions is a trip to the
CAS in San Francisco. Getting
dozens of students to San Francisco
and back almost certainly negates
most or all of the energy savings re
sulting from the competition.

The GLC needs to consider ways
to motivate more students and better
direct its nearly $lO,OOO of students'
special fees money towards energy
conservation. With the money it will
spend on water bottles, CAS tickets
and publicity for the Conservation
Cup, the GLC could outfit hundreds
of hallways and rooms with motion
sensors that ensure lights are off
when they are not needed. This kind

of investment would decrease energy
use significantly, demonstrably and
permanently, rather than slightly, un
convincingly and temporarily.
The GLC must continue to pursue
its noble mission of promoting sus
tainable behavior at Stanford, but it
must also evaluate its work with a
more critical eye to ensure that its ef
forts (and students' money) are being
directed towards successful projects.
The Conservation Cup should only
see a fifth iteration if it can justify its
existence on statistical and environ
mental merits. If it can, it should be im
proved; if it cannot, it should be re
placed.
