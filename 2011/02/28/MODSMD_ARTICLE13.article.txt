## Spring Break Dreamin' 
### Johnny Bartz 
I don't know about you, but I'm
getting spring fever spring
break fever that is. At just over
three weeks away, it's not too late to
make travel plans.
First, you have to decide where
you're going. Consider if you want
to go someplace warm or not. An
"unconventional" destination can
be just as hot as the Mexican beach
if you want it to be. Also think about
your price range. Factor in at least
$l5O per day on a vacation, adding
on your "social dues" on top of that.
My picks for this year are
Madrid, Amsterdam, London, Ha
vana or Costa Rica. A cursory flight
search says that all these destina
tions are reasonable given their
normal average prices. For Mexico
consider Cabo or Cancun. At this
point, you'll probably want to stay
away from more upscale Mexican
resort towns, such as Acapulco,
Mazatlan, Manzanillo, Puerto Val
larta flights are just too expen
sive. If you're willing to spend a bit
more on the flight, check out
Bangkok or Buenos Aires. Both
places are cheap once you get there.
Within the U.S., you might want
to just get away to NYC or go up to
Seattle. Miami, Panama City and
San Padre Island are, of course, our
spring break destinations. I would
avoid Honolulu if you haven't al
ready made reservations. Flights
and hotels are too expensive, and
while it is very nice, things are very
pricey. It's better off-season or on
your parents' dime. Closer to home,
there is nothing wrong with spend
ing a few days up in SF followed by
catching a few rays in SoCal. Call
me Captain Obvious, but staying in
the U.S. can be also be an issue if
you are underage.
When looking for flights, like
many, I prefer Kayak.com. Fares
are generally 50 percent higher dur
ing the week of spring break than

those of the rest of the month, but if
you are creative in your dates, you
can usually work around this. If you
are done with finals early, try leav
ing a few days before and then com
ing back early. Or you may con
versely want to leave a few days into
spring break and come back late.
The first few days of class aren't all
that important anyway, right?
The plane ticket is only half of
the trip, right? Well, not necessarily.
It saves you a lot of money if you
can stay with someone you know,
but pay for a hostel if you have to.
Just make sure the place checks out
on Hostel World or a related site be
fore you go. I'll never forget the Pi
rate Hostel in Rio de Janeiro that I
was supposed to stay at there
were actually bugs crawling on the
mattress, and as I first entered the
communal room, a dog took a num
ber two in the corner. Needless to
say, my friend distracted the owner
of the "lovely" hostel as I grabbed
all of my things and tore down the
street, not looking back.
Despite it all, I tend to go the
cheap route on lodging because
honestly, tell me how long you are
going to stay in the hotel. Actually,
my only real criteria are that things
don't get stolen and no bedbugs. Al
beit a bit unwarranted, my largest
fear in life is bedbugs I'm itchy
just thinking about them. I'm not
even comforted knowing that all
beds have microscopic dust mites
"bugs" crawling around and
that bedbugs don't carry disease.

Never put your bag on, next to or
especially under your bed. It's a
good idea to immediately wash
your clothes upon returning home.
For security, bring a small padlock
to lock your things. More impor
tantly, leave your unnecessary valu
ables at home!
Now you're ready for that spring
break you've always dreamed of. If
you do go to Cabo, be sure to check
out College Beach. It's just like a
frat party with more light, everyone
in swimwear and all with a tinge of
sunburned pink. Don't expect a cul
tural experience in Cabo or any
other Mexico beach destination for
that matter. Nearly everyone you
see will be American and also in
toxicated at any hour of the day.

Resist the tendency to get judgey,
and either join the crowd or just vic
ariously partake in that wet t-shirt
contest.

One word of caution drink
ing and being in the sun all day may
seem like the perfect mix, but much
like drinking on a long flight, you
must drink plenty of water as well
to avoid feeling exceedingly un
comfortable. Don't outdo yourself
too early think special dinners.
I'm sorry, but passing out for the
night at 6:30 p.m. is not classy.
Whatever you end up doing
over break, have fun and relax. You
deserve it. If all else fails, remember
that all of spring quarter at Stan
ford is like an eternal spring break.
So if you're not quite in speedo
shape, you've got four weeks. See
you at the claw.

Johnny wants to hear about your
cures (past or future) for "the fever."

to go someplace warm or not. An
"unconventional" destination can
be just as hot as the Mexican beach
if you want it to be. Also think about
your price range. Factor in at least
$l5O per day on a vacation, adding
on your "social dues" on top of that.
My picks for this year are
Madrid, Amsterdam, London, Ha
vana or Costa Rica. A cursory flight
search says that all these destina
tions are reasonable given their
normal average prices. For Mexico
consider Cabo or Cancun. At this
point, you'll probably want to stay
away from more upscale Mexican
resort towns, such as Acapulco,
Mazatlan, Manzanillo, Puerto Val
larta flights are just too expen
sive. If you're willing to spend a bit
more on the flight, check out
Bangkok or Buenos Aires. Both
places are cheap once you get there.
Within the U.S., you might want
to just get away to NYC or go up to
Seattle. Miami, Panama City and
San Padre Island are, of course, our
spring break destinations. I would
avoid Honolulu if you haven't al
ready made reservations. Flights
and hotels are too expensive, and
while it is very nice, things are very
pricey. It's better off-season or on
your parents' dime. Closer to home,
there is nothing wrong with spend
ing a few days up in SF followed by
catching a few rays in SoCal. Call
me Captain Obvious, but staying in
the U.S. can be also be an issue if
you are underage.
When looking for flights, like
many, I prefer Kayak.com. Fares
are generally 50 percent higher dur
ing the week of spring break than

those of the rest of the month, but if
you are creative in your dates, you
can usually work around this. If you
are done with finals early, try leav
ing a few days before and then com
ing back early. Or you may con
versely want to leave a few days into
spring break and come back late.
The first few days of class aren't all
that important anyway, right?
The plane ticket is only half of
the trip, right? Well, not necessarily.
It saves you a lot of money if you
can stay with someone you know,
but pay for a hostel if you have to.
Just make sure the place checks out
on Hostel World or a related site be
fore you go. I'll never forget the Pi
rate Hostel in Rio de Janeiro that I
was supposed to stay at there
were actually bugs crawling on the
mattress, and as I first entered the
communal room, a dog took a num
ber two in the corner. Needless to
say, my friend distracted the owner
of the "lovely" hostel as I grabbed
all of my things and tore down the
street, not looking back.
Despite it all, I tend to go the
cheap route on lodging because
honestly, tell me how long you are
going to stay in the hotel. Actually,
my only real criteria are that things
don't get stolen and no bedbugs. Al
beit a bit unwarranted, my largest
fear in life is bedbugs I'm itchy
just thinking about them. I'm not
even comforted knowing that all
beds have microscopic dust mites
"bugs" crawling around and
that bedbugs don't carry disease.

Never put your bag on, next to or
especially under your bed. It's a
good idea to immediately wash
your clothes upon returning home.
For security, bring a small padlock
to lock your things. More impor
tantly, leave your unnecessary valu
ables at home!
Now you're ready for that spring
break you've always dreamed of. If
you do go to Cabo, be sure to check
out College Beach. It's just like a
frat party with more light, everyone
in swimwear and all with a tinge of
sunburned pink. Don't expect a cul
tural experience in Cabo or any
other Mexico beach destination for
that matter. Nearly everyone you
see will be American and also in
toxicated at any hour of the day.

Resist the tendency to get judgey,
and either join the crowd or just vic
ariously partake in that wet t-shirt
contest.

One word of caution drink
ing and being in the sun all day may
seem like the perfect mix, but much
like drinking on a long flight, you
must drink plenty of water as well
to avoid feeling exceedingly un
comfortable. Don't outdo yourself
too early think special dinners.
I'm sorry, but passing out for the
night at 6:30 p.m. is not classy.
Whatever you end up doing
over break, have fun and relax. You
deserve it. If all else fails, remember
that all of spring quarter at Stan
ford is like an eternal spring break.
So if you're not quite in speedo
shape, you've got four weeks. See
you at the claw.
