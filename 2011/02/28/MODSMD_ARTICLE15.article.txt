# No FREE LUNCH
## Drunk and Responsible 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
There has been a low buzz this year about the Stan
ford alcohol policy in freshmen dorms, a conver
sation that is most relevant as Resident Assistant
(RA) candidates for freshmen dorms finish their inter
views and Resident Fellows (RFs) make their selec
tions. For years, Stanford has had a liberal alcohol poli
cy, dedicated to the idea of informed personal responsi
bility. But conversations we hear today fundamentally
question this ideal. If these talks become anything
more, then students needs to be fighting the change
tooth and nail, and freshmen RAs should be leading the
fight.
The Stanford alcohol policy is uncommon at other
schools. We've all heard stories from high school friends
silently pounding drinks behind closed doors, avoiding
their RAs. Contrast that with the relationship that most
Stanford freshmen have with RAs friendly and co
operative. The decisions regarding treatment of alcohol
consumption are, within reason, left up to fellow stu
dents who are much more in touch with actual danger
and risk than any one-size-fits-all policy ever could be.
Potentially dangerous behavior can be openly watched,
simply because students trust their RAs to use their lee
way wisely and reasonably.
This arrangement seems to protect students' well-being
relatively well. Depending on whom you ask, there are
around 1,400 college alcohol related deaths annually,
yet we have not had any in years. While not a perfect

comparison we have indeed had a number of close
calls, and it is probably inaccurate to compare the Stan
ford student population directly to national college sta
tistics because of socioeconomics and other factors
something is working.
Perhaps more important than safety, though discussed
less frequently, is the promotion of personal responsi
bility. Whether or not our parents are comfortable with
the idea, Stanford students are adults. While we are not
in the real world yet, we are rapidly approaching it.
When we get there, whatever choices we make will be
ours, and we will be wholly responsible for their reper
cussions.
Many of our generation are raised far away from the re
alities of responsibility. While it is obviously not repre
sentative of everyone's experiences, our generation is


characterized by less freedom, less
criticism, inflated egos, fluffy talk of
individuality and uniqueness and a
removal from the natural order of
cause and effect.
Realizing that we are powerless
to prevent parents from sheltering
their children, what better place
than college to introduce the future
leaders of the world, as we like to
refer to ourselves, to the idea of
consequences? If I drink to the
point where I am throwing up in the
bushes and am so hung-over that I
fail my midterm the next Monday,
that is my responsibility. I don't get
to blame the person or house that
provided me the alcohol, or the
professor for scheduling the
midterm the Monday after the best
party of the year, or the random by
stander for not jumping on me, de
manding that I drop the shot glass
and step away from the handle. Be
cause when I'm sitting over the toi
let the next morning feeling like my
head was run over, or when I have
to tell my parents I'm retaking
chemistry, I'm the one who is re
sponsible.
There are hints that we are drift
ing away from this system. Pro
grams like AlcoholEDU make
sense, helping students make in
formed choices and realize the like
ly outcomes of their actions. But
now students who have had alcohol
incidents are being forced to sign
agreements not to drink, and there

is talk of holding RAs responsible
for the trouble that their freshmen
get into. A month ago Professor
Cliff Nass, the Otero RF, even sug
gested that those who supply alco
hol to, or do not stop the alcohol
consumption of, those who get
themselves into trouble should be
found in violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
We need to be aware of this
creeping paternalism, our reluc
tance to blame individuals for their
actions or the outcome of their
drinking. Mistakes will inevitably
be made, and consequences will be
faced. These consequences may
hurt, and they may hurt a lot. But
something is working, and instead
of pretending that they are shocked
that houses, clubs and organiza
tions give alcohol to underage stu
dents when something goes wrong,
the University should accept these
incidents, except in the most bizarre
cases, as the responsibility of the
student.
To the next batch of RAs: we have
something good going. Don't let
panic and paternalism take it away
from us. Don't let yourselves be
come the rubber-stamp enforcers
of a flawed policy. Whatever it says
on your official job descriptions,
there is one lesson you can teach
your freshmen that is one of the
most important they will ever learn:
how to live in a world where choic
es matter and how to take responsi
bility for one's own actions.

individuality and uniqueness and a
removal from the natural order of
cause and effect.
Realizing that we are powerless
to prevent parents from sheltering
their children, what better place
than college to introduce the future
leaders of the world, as we like to
refer to ourselves, to the idea of
consequences? If I drink to the
point where I am throwing up in the
bushes and am so hung-over that I
fail my midterm the next Monday,
that is my responsibility. I don't get
to blame the person or house that
provided me the alcohol, or the
professor for scheduling the
midterm the Monday after the best
party of the year, or the random by
stander for not jumping on me, de
manding that I drop the shot glass
and step away from the handle. Be
cause when I'm sitting over the toi
let the next morning feeling like my
head was run over, or when I have
to tell my parents I'm retaking
chemistry, I'm the one who is re
sponsible.
There are hints that we are drift
ing away from this system. Pro
grams like AlcoholEDU make
sense, helping students make in
formed choices and realize the like
ly outcomes of their actions. But
now students who have had alcohol
incidents are being forced to sign
agreements not to drink, and there

is talk of holding RAs responsible
for the trouble that their freshmen
get into. A month ago Professor
Cliff Nass, the Otero RF, even sug
gested that those who supply alco
hol to, or do not stop the alcohol
consumption of, those who get
themselves into trouble should be
found in violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
We need to be aware of this
creeping paternalism, our reluc
tance to blame individuals for their
actions or the outcome of their
drinking. Mistakes will inevitably
be made, and consequences will be
faced. These consequences may
hurt, and they may hurt a lot. But
something is working, and instead
of pretending that they are shocked
that houses, clubs and organiza
tions give alcohol to underage stu
dents when something goes wrong,
the University should accept these
incidents, except in the most bizarre
cases, as the responsibility of the
student.
To the next batch of RAs: we have
something good going. Don't let
panic and paternalism take it away
from us. Don't let yourselves be
come the rubber-stamp enforcers
of a flawed policy. Whatever it says
on your official job descriptions,
there is one lesson you can teach
your freshmen that is one of the
most important they will ever learn:
how to live in a world where choic
es matter and how to take responsi
bility for one's own actions.
