# No FREE LUNCH
## Drunk and Responsible 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
There has been a low buzz this year about the Stan
ford alcohol policy in freshmen dorms, a conver
sation that is most relevant as Resident Assistant
(RA) candidates for freshmen dorms finish their inter
views and Resident Fellows (RFs) make their selec
tions. For years, Stanford has had a liberal alcohol poli
cy, dedicated to the idea of informed personal responsi
bility. But conversations we hear today fundamentally
question this ideal. If these talks become anything
more, then students needs to be fighting the change
tooth and nail, and freshmen RAs should be leading the
fight.
The Stanford alcohol policy is uncommon at other
schools. We've all heard stories from high school friends
silently pounding drinks behind closed doors, avoiding
their RAs. Contrast that with the relationship that most
Stanford freshmen have with RAs friendly and co
operative. The decisions regarding treatment of alcohol
consumption are, within reason, left up to fellow stu
dents who are much more in touch with actual danger
and risk than any one-size-fits-all policy ever could be.
Potentially dangerous behavior can be openly watched,
simply because students trust their RAs to use their lee
way wisely and reasonably.
This arrangement seems to protect students' well-being
relatively well. Depending on whom you ask, there are
around 1,400 college alcohol related deaths annually,
yet we have not had any in years. While not a perfect

comparison we have indeed had a number of close
calls, and it is probably inaccurate to compare the Stan
ford student population directly to national college sta
tistics because of socioeconomics and other factors
something is working.
Perhaps more important than safety, though discussed
less frequently, is the promotion of personal responsi
bility. Whether or not our parents are comfortable with
the idea, Stanford students are adults. While we are not
in the real world yet, we are rapidly approaching it.
When we get there, whatever choices we make will be
ours, and we will be wholly responsible for their reper
cussions.
Many of our generation are raised far away from the re
alities of responsibility. While it is obviously not repre
sentative of everyone's experiences, our generation is
