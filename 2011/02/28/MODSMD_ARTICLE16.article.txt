# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Poking Holes in the Illusion 
### Kristian Bailey 
So, the interesting thing about
having a column is that it puts
me into a very public sphere.
As someone who considers himself
an introvert, this presents a couple
of issues: (1) being misunderstood
and not having the chance to clarify
others' misconceptions, even if I
what I wrote makes sense to me;
and (2), more problematically, that
there is only so much I feel comfort
able revealing about myself in this
setting what I say in my column
is very different than what I write in
my journal.
I see these issues as part of a larg
er problem, one that a friend and I
discussed last Saturday a prob
lem that has resonated as a Zeitgeist
of last week in my conversations
with peers and in some of last
week's other columns: reality and
the Illusion.
My friend and I discussed the no
tion that most of what we say and do
in our interactions with others is an
"Illusion," a projection of how we
want ourselves to be perceived.

Some of us are better than others at
packaging and marketing these pro
jections, but it still exists.
For example, I say things like,
"I'm fine, thanks and you?" even
to those who are physically or emo
tionally closest to me. And in social
settings, like the dorm, the class
room, Happy Hour at Terra, I some
times feel like I'm the only one who
feels as insecure or unhappy as I
sometimes do like I'm the only
one who's struggling to finish one
paper as I start another and keep up
with the reading in SLE, while man
aging other academics and ex
tracurriculars; like I'm the only one
who has trouble striking up conver
sations with people I don't know at

Happy Hour, even though I'd like
to; like I'm the only one who is awk
ward about expressing interest in
other people or who is hurt when
that interest is not reciprocated.
My friend said that part of the
solution is to feel better knowing
that others are just projecting
but this doesn't deal with the larger
problem of the Illusion's existence.
So my friend suggested "Radical
Honesty" as away to puncture the
Illusion of always expressing
what we think and how we feel, with
the idea that life would be better in
the long run if everyone were hon
est.
I argued that there are some nec
essary and practical functions to the
Illusion and that honesty isn't al
ways productive. And even if this
isn't true, many times it's uncom
fortable to speak the truth white
lies are what maintain the peace
that we see on the surface. At the
same time, though, these small fab
