# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Poking Holes in the Illusion 
### Kristian Bailey 
So, the interesting thing about
having a column is that it puts
me into a very public sphere.
As someone who considers himself
an introvert, this presents a couple
of issues: (1) being misunderstood
and not having the chance to clarify
others' misconceptions, even if I
what I wrote makes sense to me;
and (2), more problematically, that
there is only so much I feel comfort
able revealing about myself in this
setting what I say in my column
is very different than what I write in
my journal.
I see these issues as part of a larg
er problem, one that a friend and I
discussed last Saturday a prob
lem that has resonated as a Zeitgeist
of last week in my conversations
with peers and in some of last
week's other columns: reality and
the Illusion.
My friend and I discussed the no
tion that most of what we say and do
in our interactions with others is an
"Illusion," a projection of how we
want ourselves to be perceived.

Some of us are better than others at
packaging and marketing these pro
jections, but it still exists.
For example, I say things like,
"I'm fine, thanks and you?" even
to those who are physically or emo
tionally closest to me. And in social
settings, like the dorm, the class
room, Happy Hour at Terra, I some
times feel like I'm the only one who
feels as insecure or unhappy as I
sometimes do like I'm the only
one who's struggling to finish one
paper as I start another and keep up
with the reading in SLE, while man
aging other academics and ex
tracurriculars; like I'm the only one
who has trouble striking up conver
sations with people I don't know at

Happy Hour, even though I'd like
to; like I'm the only one who is awk
ward about expressing interest in
other people or who is hurt when
that interest is not reciprocated.
My friend said that part of the
solution is to feel better knowing
that others are just projecting
but this doesn't deal with the larger
problem of the Illusion's existence.
So my friend suggested "Radical
Honesty" as away to puncture the
Illusion of always expressing
what we think and how we feel, with
the idea that life would be better in
the long run if everyone were hon
est.
I argued that there are some nec
essary and practical functions to the
Illusion and that honesty isn't al
ways productive. And even if this
isn't true, many times it's uncom
fortable to speak the truth white
lies are what maintain the peace
that we see on the surface. At the
same time, though, these small fab

rications, alterations, illusions are
what allow the Stanford Bubble
(and other bubbles) to exist.
Wouldn't Stanford be even
more of a genuinely happy place
(for despite the existence of the
Bubble, I still think I am the happi
est college student I could possibly
be at this campus) if we were more
candid about our thoughts and feel
ings, more honest to ourselves and
to others?
Part of an Esquire article I read
on Radical Honesty said that, with
respect to resentment, it's meant to
be expressed directly in person: "so
that you can experience in your
body the sensations that occur
when you express the resentment,
while at the same time being in the
presence of the person you resent,
and so you can stay with them until
the sensations arise and recede and
then get back to neutral which is
what forgiveness is." (Include other
feelings besides resentment here
and I think this gets at the essence
of how we should interact with one
another these interactions are
what meaningful relationships are.)
Yet, still and I apologize for

vacillating so much, but this is a
complex issue I am too much of
a coward to take the first step. Little
white lies still get me by, and I am
honest enough to reveal part of my
real self, but still hide behind some
what of an Illusion in this column.
I don't think it's bad to have pri
vate areas of the self, or necessary
that the public know you, but you
are more than the public you are
my peers, my deans, even my fami
ly, and you should know more. So,
as a semi-action, to find a medium
between my column and my jour
nal in which I can semi-publicly be
Radically Honest, I've started a
blog. It's invite only. Only two peo
ple besides me see it at the moment.
But I've done my best to be com
pletely honest about what makes
me upset, what I desire and why I
make the choices that I do. And so
far it's been rewarding.
If we can't collectively break the
Illusion, maybe all we each need is
our own "semi-public" outlet to
which we can vent and be radically
or naturally honest to more people
than just ourselves. I certainly will
try more to avoid the Illusion in my
future columns.
