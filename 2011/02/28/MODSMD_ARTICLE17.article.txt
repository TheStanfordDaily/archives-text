# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Why Transgender Awareness Week Is Important 
### Cristopher Bautista 
This week is Transgender
Awareness Week at Stanford,
and of course, I love it when
people are aware of me. But I feel
like whenever I write a column dur
ing a week that is important for
LGBT issues, I always end up writ
ing about something depressing.
When I was younger, the only trans
gender people I heard about were
the ones who had been wronged,
who had been murdered. The lesson
I learned as a young child, watching
the news and reading the newspa
pers, was that transgender people
are bad, deserving the things that
come to them. As I grew up, I was so
scared to be myself, so scared that if
anybody found out about me, that
I'd end up that way too. And I'm not
going to lie, that impression left on
me during those childhood days still
hasn't left me. There are days when
I get out of bed sad and think how
easy and great and convenient my
life would be if I had just been born
with, you know, the "right" parts,
that I'd meet an early end because I
put myself too far out there.

But this week is not the week to
get depressed. For me, Transgender
Awareness Week is important be
cause it's a reminder to me that yes,
my life has been unconventional,
but that doesn't mean it's not legiti
mate, or that it's not valid my hu
manity and masculinity are simply a
bit different than the standard devi
ation. A week like Transgender
Awareness Week gives me the op
portunity to reflect on myself, to
embrace my own identity. It's a re
minder that the transgender com
munity a community that I am
proud to be part of contributes
to the richness and diversity of both
the queer and general populations.
The primary reason for this
week is to celebrate us, to know that
there are people like me who thrive
and who are happy, who deserve to
be happy because sadly, there
isn't enough of that message out
there. The "T" in LGBT is heavily
marginalized, especially in months
and weeks dedicated to LGBT is
sues. In LGBT awareness weeks,

there is usually only one event, if
any, dedicated to transgender
events. One event is not enough to
express how diverse the transgen
der community is. To have a whole
week to people like me? It's em
powering. I'm special and valid
enough to be celebrated. And that
means a lot to me.
But how is Transgender Aware
ness Week important for you, my
reader? It's an opportunity to be
educated, to learn about a margin
alized and often silenced small but
potent slice of the general popula
tion. This week isn't just a week to
become aware of transgender peo
ple. To be aware is not enough. If
we're going to change things, we
need to do something about it. We
need to take action and get peo
ple's attention. I have several
propositions for you: go to at least

one event (they're going on all
week, so you have no excuse). Get
educated. Start a conversation with
a friend. Forward this column to
someone you know. As I said last
week, the transgender voice has
been marginalized for far too long.
That's what Transgender Aware
ness Week is for to provide a
space for us to speak for ourselves.
And your job is to listen. I promise
we'll make it interesting.
There is still lot of work to be
done. Recently the Gay and Les
bian Task Force released a report on
transgender discrimination, titled
"Injustice at Every Turn: A Report
of the National Transgender Dis
crimination Survey." According to
the report, transgender people are
four times more likely to live in
poverty compared to their non
transgender counterparts and are
two times more likely to be unem
ployed. One fifth of transgender re
spondents also reported homeless
ness during some point of their lives
and perhaps the most frighten
ing of statistics, 41 percent of re
spondents reported to have at
tempted suicide, compared to 1.6
percent of the general population.
There is a sad truth out there
there is still change that needs to be
made. I hope one day, I can look
back years from now and remember
these sad statistics as something
from the distant past. I hope that by
that time, in years ahead, that trans
gender people are more accepted,
that we no longer have to justify our
existence and we can be regarded as
people. It's a long way off, but hey,
one step at a time.
Yes, many transgender people
do suffer, but the other side of that
coin is that we come out of that
process stronger. And this week is
dedicated to our strength, to our
perseverance, to our bravery in that
we are willing to live as we are. And
believe me, that's not celebrated
enough.

Cristopher thinks you should hug a
transgender person this week. E-mail

To have a whole
week devoted to
people like me?
Its empowering.
I'm special and
valid enough to
be celebrated.
