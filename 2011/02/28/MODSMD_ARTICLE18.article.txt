## CLINCHED Stanford notches its 20th conference title in 25 years 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Two days after securing at least a
share of its 11th consecutive Pac-10
title, Stanford women's basketball left
little doubt that it's still on top of the
conference as the team cruised to a
99-60 victory over the visiting Oregon
Ducks, earning yet another outright
league championship in the process.
Senior point guard Jeannette
Pohlen wrapped up the No. 2 Cardi
nal's (26-2, 17-0 Pac-10) final two
game series in emphatic fashion,
knocking down 20 points in a season
low 20 minutes of play. Her classmate
and fellow three-time veteran of the
Final Four, forward Kayla Pedersen,
played just 19 minutes and went 5-for
-7 with 13 points.

The win over Oregon (13-14,4-12)
advances a number of remarkable
streaks and achievements for Stan
ford. The Cardinal has now won 60
consecutive games in Maples Pavil
ion, dating back to its home opener in
2007. That run includes victories over
two top-ranked opponents: most re
cently, a 71-59 win over Connecticut
last December and another over Ten
nessee back in 2007.
"The streak we have here at home
is very special," Pohlen said. "We want
to give our fans a win every time we're
at home."
The conference championship is
Stanford's 20th in program history
and the 20th in 25 years. For Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer, the
process has become almost routine.
After leading the Cardinal to all but
one of those titles, she barely even
cracked a smile as she handed the tro
phy to her players on Saturday.
Pac-10 commissioner Larry Scott
was on hand to personally deliver the
silver-and-blue crystalline cup.
Stanford got right to work in earn
ing the win, going on a 17-5 run to

open the game. After a 10-0 outburst
later on in the half, Stanford walked to
the locker room with a 56-25 lead.
The team may not have needed it
on Saturday, but the Cardinal re
ceived an added boost from returning
starter Nnemkadi Ogwumike. The
junior forward injured her ankle last
weekend at USC, but played 12 min
utes and scored four points, all on free

throws, against the Ducks.
She wasn't alone in getting limited
minutes. Stanford's starters hardly
played in the second half, when shoot
ing guard Toni Kokenis, a freshman,
and her fellow Illinois native, redshirt
sophomore forward Sarah Boothe,
pushed their point totals to 10 and 11,
