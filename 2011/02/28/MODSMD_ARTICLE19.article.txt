# Baseball drops 2 of 3 to Vandy
## Two close losses spoil weekend 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
fought hard against the Vanderbilt
Commodores in Nashville last
weekend, but a little bad luck came
the Cardinal's way as it dropped the
first two games, 2-1 and 8-7, before
winning Sunday's contest, 5-2.
The No. 8 Cardinal (4-3) per
formed well against the strong
pitching staff of the No. 3 Com
modores (7-1) all weekend, but
even though it outscored and outhit
the Commodores for the series,
Stanford didn't have quite enough
to capture its second series win in as
many weeks.

Sophomore righty Mark Appel
went out first for the Cardinal on a
cold Friday night, where he squared
off against Sonny Gray, a right-han
der who is expected to be a first
round pick in this spring's MLB
draft.
Both pitchers went a full six in
nings, with Appel giving up two runs
on seven hits, but he couldn't outduel
Gray, who weaseled past the Cardi-

Junior starter Jordan Pries, above, allowed only two runs in seven full innings
in the Cardinal's only win of the weekend series in Nashville. The win came
after two one-run losses on the road to the No. 3 Vanderbilt squad.
nal lineup without his best stuff, giv
ing up only one run on three hits.
Stanford's offense was frustrat
ingly ineffective against Gray, who
walked four but stuck out six even
though he was missing the strike
zone on many first pitches and strug
gled with command in general, de
spite his impressive stat line.
The worst day went to freshman
right fielder Austin Wilson, who had
three strikeouts and grounded into a
double play a particularly surpris
ing result considering that the top re
cruit had four RBI and a home run
last weekend against Rice.
Saturday's game was completely
opposite to Friday's contest, as both
teams clobbered the baseball on a
sunny afternoon, with Stanford and
Vandy combining for 30 hits (with 17
hits for the Card) and 15 runs.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
in the top of the first, but the Com
modores came back strong, knock
ing sophomore starter Dean McAr
dle out of the game after just one
and one-third inning. They rallied to
take a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the
third inning behind first baseman
Aaron Westlake's missile home run
to right field that traveled well over
380 feet.
Stanford then battled back to
score two runs apiece in the fourth
and fifth innings thanks to three
RBI from sophomore shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger, who went 4-for
-5 on the game and helped the Card
back to a 7-4 lead with four innings
to go.
Then it all fell apart for Stanford
due to two unfortunate bits of luck.
Junior lefty Scott Snodgress came in
to get the last out of the fifth inning
and looked like he would get out of
the sixth unscathed. That is, until
sophomore second baseman Eric
Smith dropped a ground ball for his
second error of the day, which let a
run score to cut the lead to 7-5.
The mistake opened the door for
Commodore shortstop Jason Espos
ito, who hit a slow roller up the sec
ond base line that hit the bag, flipped
over Cardinal third baseman
Stephen Piscotty's head and ended
up as a two-RBI double to tie the
game at seven.
Freshman right-hander A.J.

Vanegas came in during the eighth
inning, and it looked like he would
get out of the eighth safely after
Snodgress let a runner reach base.
But a potential double-play throw
from freshman second baseman
Lonnie Kauppila arrived just a sec
ond too late and the Cardinal lost the
lead again, 8-7, on the fielder's
choice.
Stanford's final chance to rally in
the top of the ninth was snuffed out
when righty Navery Moore blazed
his way through three batters, firing
nothing but fastballs to complete his
third save of the year, an 8-7 Com
modore victory that clinched the se
ries win for Vanderbilt.
The Cardinal needed to save face
on Sunday after two tough losses, so
it turned to junior Jordan Pries. The
right-hander got his first win on the
season on Tuesday by pitching four
scoreless innings against the Cal
Bears in a 3-2 win.
Pries was nothing short of spec
tacular the second time around, no
hitting the Commodores through
the first four innings and cruising
through seven full innings (the
longest outing for a Cardinal starter
all season). He gave up only three
hits and two runs.
Pries also got some help from the
offense, with senior designated hitter
Ben Clowe and sophomore Stephen
Piscotty knocking back-to-back
home runs in the top of the second
inning to grab an early lead, with Pis
cotty's shot clearing the left field wall
and crashing into the roof of Vander
bilt basketball stadium over 400 feet
away.
Stanford let the Commodores get
close two Vandy runs in the bot
tom of the fifth cut the lead to 3-2
but some effective small-ball pushed
two more runs across in the sixth and
eighth innings.The Cardinal had jun
ior Chris Reed close out the 5-2 win.
The Commodores handed the
Cardinal its first series loss of the sea
son, but the win on Sunday, coupled
with Tuesday's victory over Cal,
helped Stanford to a 2-2 record in the
second week of the season.
The Cardinal returns home on
Tuesday evening to take on the
Santa Clara Broncos in a 5:30 p.m.
game before it travels to Austin to
battle the No. 6 Texas Longhorns in
a three-game series starting on Fri
day night.

Junior starter Jordan Pries, above, allowed only two runs in seven full innings
in the Cardinal's only win of the weekend series in Nashville. The win came
after two one-run losses on the road to the No. 3 Vanderbilt squad.
nal lineup without his best stuff, giv
ing up only one run on three hits.
Stanford's offense was frustrat
ingly ineffective against Gray, who
walked four but stuck out six even
though he was missing the strike
zone on many first pitches and strug
gled with command in general, de
spite his impressive stat line.
The worst day went to freshman
right fielder Austin Wilson, who had
three strikeouts and grounded into a
double play a particularly surpris
ing result considering that the top re
cruit had four RBI and a home run
last weekend against Rice.
Saturday's game was completely
opposite to Friday's contest, as both
teams clobbered the baseball on a
sunny afternoon, with Stanford and
Vandy combining for 30 hits (with 17
hits for the Card) and 15 runs.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
in the top of the first, but the Com
modores came back strong, knock
ing sophomore starter Dean McAr
dle out of the game after just one
and one-third inning. They rallied to
take a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the
third inning behind first baseman
Aaron Westlake's missile home run
to right field that traveled well over
380 feet.
Stanford then battled back to
score two runs apiece in the fourth
and fifth innings thanks to three
RBI from sophomore shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger, who went 4-for
-5 on the game and helped the Card
back to a 7-4 lead with four innings
to go.
Then it all fell apart for Stanford
due to two unfortunate bits of luck.
Junior lefty Scott Snodgress came in
to get the last out of the fifth inning
and looked like he would get out of
the sixth unscathed. That is, until
sophomore second baseman Eric
Smith dropped a ground ball for his
second error of the day, which let a
run score to cut the lead to 7-5.
The mistake opened the door for
Commodore shortstop Jason Espos
ito, who hit a slow roller up the sec
ond base line that hit the bag, flipped
over Cardinal third baseman
Stephen Piscotty's head and ended
up as a two-RBI double to tie the
game at seven.
Freshman right-hander A.J.

Vanegas came in during the eighth
inning, and it looked like he would
get out of the eighth safely after
Snodgress let a runner reach base.
But a potential double-play throw
from freshman second baseman
Lonnie Kauppila arrived just a sec
ond too late and the Cardinal lost the
lead again, 8-7, on the fielder's
choice.
Stanford's final chance to rally in
the top of the ninth was snuffed out
when righty Navery Moore blazed
his way through three batters, firing
nothing but fastballs to complete his
third save of the year, an 8-7 Com
modore victory that clinched the se
ries win for Vanderbilt.
The Cardinal needed to save face
on Sunday after two tough losses, so
it turned to junior Jordan Pries. The
right-hander got his first win on the
season on Tuesday by pitching four
scoreless innings against the Cal
Bears in a 3-2 win.
Pries was nothing short of spec
tacular the second time around, no
hitting the Commodores through
the first four innings and cruising
through seven full innings (the
longest outing for a Cardinal starter
all season). He gave up only three
hits and two runs.
Pries also got some help from the
offense, with senior designated hitter
Ben Clowe and sophomore Stephen
Piscotty knocking back-to-back
home runs in the top of the second
inning to grab an early lead, with Pis
cotty's shot clearing the left field wall
and crashing into the roof of Vander
bilt basketball stadium over 400 feet
away.
Stanford let the Commodores get
close two Vandy runs in the bot
tom of the fifth cut the lead to 3-2
but some effective small-ball pushed
two more runs across in the sixth and
eighth innings.The Cardinal had jun
ior Chris Reed close out the 5-2 win.
The Commodores handed the
Cardinal its first series loss of the sea
son, but the win on Sunday, coupled
with Tuesday's victory over Cal,
helped Stanford to a 2-2 record in the
second week of the season.
The Cardinal returns home on
Tuesday evening to take on the
Santa Clara Broncos in a 5:30 p.m.
game before it travels to Austin to
battle the No. 6 Texas Longhorns in
a three-game series starting on Fri
day night.

The Stanford baseball team
fought hard against the Vanderbilt
Commodores in Nashville last
weekend, but a little bad luck came
the Cardinal's way as it dropped the
first two games, 2-1 and 8-7, before
winning Sunday's contest, 5-2.
The No. 8 Cardinal (4-3) per
formed well against the strong
pitching staff of the No. 3 Com
modores (7-1) all weekend, but
even though it outscored and outhit
the Commodores for the series,
Stanford didn't have quite enough
to capture its second series win in as
many weeks.

Sophomore righty Mark Appel
went out first for the Cardinal on a
cold Friday night, where he squared
off against Sonny Gray, a right-han
der who is expected to be a first
round pick in this spring's MLB
draft.
