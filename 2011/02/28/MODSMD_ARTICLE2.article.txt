# ASSU officers reap large stipends
## Vice president earns highest salary at $ 10,000 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Though elections for ASSU offices are
rapidly approaching, a point that is often
overlooked during the voting process is
compensation for student government offi
cials. A significant proportion of ASSU offi
cials, both elected and unelected, receive
stipends, with the largest peaking just under
$lO,OOO.
ASSU salaries change slightly year to
year. The budget is calculated each spring
following elections, reflecting important
changes. Each new president determines the

composition of their cabinet, so the number
of paid officials is never the same.
Currently, under the operating budget
for 2010-11, the president receives a per
sonal stipend of $8,250, while the vice pres
ident receives a stipend of $8,500. Both typ
ically receive an additional $1,500 stipend,
meant to cover summer housing expenses.
Last spring, former ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, who resigned earlier
this quarter due to an injury, transferred
$l,OOO of his stipend to general discre
tionary funds because he spent part of his
summer off-campus.
As a point of comparison, the executive

stipends are at a similar level as resident as
sistant (RA) salaries. RAs earn 75 percent
of the cost of room and board.
This year, under ASSU President Angeli
na Cardona 'll, executive cabinet chairs
each earn a stipend of $BOO. Cardona's chief
of staff earns $2,500, bringing the total of all
cabinet stipends this year to $35,750, down
from $40,550 for last year's cabinet.
Last year's ASSU President, David Gob
aud 'OB M.S. 'lO, gave up $2,000 of his own
salary to provide $l,OOO in salaries for mem
bers of his larger cabinet, including new
