# ASSU officers reap large stipends
## Vice president earns highest salary at $ 10,000 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Though elections for ASSU offices are
rapidly approaching, a point that is often
overlooked during the voting process is
compensation for student government offi
cials. A significant proportion of ASSU offi
cials, both elected and unelected, receive
stipends, with the largest peaking just under
$lO,OOO.
ASSU salaries change slightly year to
year. The budget is calculated each spring
following elections, reflecting important
changes. Each new president determines the

composition of their cabinet, so the number
of paid officials is never the same.
Currently, under the operating budget
for 2010-11, the president receives a per
sonal stipend of $8,250, while the vice pres
ident receives a stipend of $8,500. Both typ
ically receive an additional $1,500 stipend,
meant to cover summer housing expenses.
Last spring, former ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, who resigned earlier
this quarter due to an injury, transferred
$l,OOO of his stipend to general discre
tionary funds because he spent part of his
summer off-campus.
As a point of comparison, the executive

stipends are at a similar level as resident as
sistant (RA) salaries. RAs earn 75 percent
of the cost of room and board.
This year, under ASSU President Angeli
na Cardona 'll, executive cabinet chairs
each earn a stipend of $BOO. Cardona's chief
of staff earns $2,500, bringing the total of all
cabinet stipends this year to $35,750, down
from $40,550 for last year's cabinet.
Last year's ASSU President, David Gob
aud 'OB M.S. 'lO, gave up $2,000 of his own
salary to provide $l,OOO in salaries for mem
bers of his larger cabinet, including new

graduate student-specific positions.

The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) also includes several paid
positions, most notably the body's
chair, who receives $4,700.
The Undergraduate Senate
compensates select members, as
some positions entail a higher time
commitment. The Senate Chair re
ceives $3,000, while the Deputy
Chair receives $l,OOO. The senate
secretary is compensated $BOO. The
chair of the Senate's Appropria
tions Committee, Rafael Vazquez
'l2, receives a stipend of $2,000.
In a winter quarter meeting be
fore the transition, some senators
expressed confusion about which
of their peers receive compensa
tion. From last year to this year, the
Senate decreased salaries for the
Chair and Deputy Chair, by 29 and
50 percent, respectively. The Sen
ate parliamentarian is no longer
compensated.
For students hoping to run for
class president, there is no mone
tary incentive those positions
are unpaid.
"I think the current compensa
tion levels are adequate for the po
sitions," said former Senate Chair
and recently appointed Vice Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2. "There's a
lot of work that goes into each po
sition, so any compensation is
much appreciated."
Cruz said he did not weigh com
pensation as a factor in his decision
to run for elected office; he pre
ferred instead to focus on "how
much social good and social
change I can make."
Cruz took office following
Wharton's resignation. He admit
ted that he still does not know how
the ASSU will handle the transi
tion in terms of compensation.

"We've been more focused on
making sure the transition of the
work has been going well," Cruz
said.
Cardona said that the ASSU
would try to prorate salaries for
those who moved to different posi
tions following Wharton's resigna
tion, using time spent on the job as
the main metric to determine com
pensation levels.
Cruz discussed the pay level of
student government officials in
terms of the amount of time an in
dividual can commit and the indi
vidual's financial situation.
"I think it depends on the indi
vidual's circumstances," he said in
reference to students' decision to
run for office.
Unelected paid positions in the
ASSU include representatives on
the Nominations Commission and
the Elections Commission. The
chair of the Nominations Commis
sion is currently compensated
$1,650, while the Elections Com
missioner is compensated $3,000.

"The time commitment for
being on the Elections Commis
sion is particularly high," wrote
Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 in an e-mail to The
Daily.
He described the job as requir
ing "year-round work" and "about
two months of constant round-the
clock work" to ensure that ASSU
candidates, class president slates
and special fee groups meet ballot
deadlines.
Salaries for ASSU officials
were under scrutiny last spring,
when then-senator Alex Katz 'l2
presented two amendments to a
bill before the Senate to cut execu
tive salaries. His final amendment,
to collectively cut the salaries by
$3,000, was rejected 7-1.

Though elections for ASSU offices are
rapidly approaching, a point that is often
overlooked during the voting process is
compensation for student government offi
cials. A significant proportion of ASSU offi
cials, both elected and unelected, receive
stipends, with the largest peaking just under
$lO,OOO.
ASSU salaries change slightly year to
year. The budget is calculated each spring
following elections, reflecting important
changes. Each new president determines the

composition of their cabinet, so the number
of paid officials is never the same.
Currently, under the operating budget
for 2010-11, the president receives a per
sonal stipend of $8,250, while the vice pres
ident receives a stipend of $8,500. Both typ
ically receive an additional $1,500 stipend,
meant to cover summer housing expenses.
Last spring, former ASSU Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, who resigned earlier
this quarter due to an injury, transferred
$l,OOO of his stipend to general discre
tionary funds because he spent part of his
summer off-campus.
As a point of comparison, the executive

stipends are at a similar level as resident as
sistant (RA) salaries. RAs earn 75 percent
of the cost of room and board.
This year, under ASSU President Angeli
na Cardona 'll, executive cabinet chairs
each earn a stipend of $BOO. Cardona's chief
of staff earns $2,500, bringing the total of all
cabinet stipends this year to $35,750, down
from $40,550 for last year's cabinet.
Last year's ASSU President, David Gob
aud 'OB M.S. 'lO, gave up $2,000 of his own
salary to provide $l,OOO in salaries for mem
bers of his larger cabinet, including new

graduate student-specific positions.

The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) also includes several paid
positions, most notably the body's
chair, who receives $4,700.
The Undergraduate Senate
compensates select members, as
some positions entail a higher time
commitment. The Senate Chair re
ceives $3,000, while the Deputy
Chair receives $l,OOO. The senate
secretary is compensated $BOO. The
chair of the Senate's Appropria
tions Committee, Rafael Vazquez
'l2, receives a stipend of $2,000.
In a winter quarter meeting be
fore the transition, some senators
expressed confusion about which
of their peers receive compensa
tion. From last year to this year, the
Senate decreased salaries for the
Chair and Deputy Chair, by 29 and
50 percent, respectively. The Sen
ate parliamentarian is no longer
compensated.
For students hoping to run for
class president, there is no mone
tary incentive those positions
are unpaid.
"I think the current compensa
tion levels are adequate for the po
sitions," said former Senate Chair
and recently appointed Vice Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2. "There's a
lot of work that goes into each po
sition, so any compensation is
much appreciated."
Cruz said he did not weigh com
pensation as a factor in his decision
to run for elected office; he pre
ferred instead to focus on "how
much social good and social
change I can make."
Cruz took office following
Wharton's resignation. He admit
ted that he still does not know how
the ASSU will handle the transi
tion in terms of compensation.

"We've been more focused on
making sure the transition of the
work has been going well," Cruz
said.
Cardona said that the ASSU
would try to prorate salaries for
those who moved to different posi
tions following Wharton's resigna
tion, using time spent on the job as
the main metric to determine com
pensation levels.
Cruz discussed the pay level of
student government officials in
terms of the amount of time an in
dividual can commit and the indi
vidual's financial situation.
"I think it depends on the indi
vidual's circumstances," he said in
reference to students' decision to
run for office.
Unelected paid positions in the
ASSU include representatives on
the Nominations Commission and
the Elections Commission. The
chair of the Nominations Commis
sion is currently compensated
$1,650, while the Elections Com
missioner is compensated $3,000.

"The time commitment for
being on the Elections Commis
sion is particularly high," wrote
Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 in an e-mail to The
Daily.
He described the job as requir
ing "year-round work" and "about
two months of constant round-the
clock work" to ensure that ASSU
candidates, class president slates
and special fee groups meet ballot
deadlines.
Salaries for ASSU officials
