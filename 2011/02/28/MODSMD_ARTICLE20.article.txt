# Athletes on the wrong side of fame
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Instead of the usual argumentative
column, I'm writing a bit more for
fun today. You probably won't have
a strong opinion about it, other than
maybe wanting to tell me that I for
got something but I still think it should
be fun.
The other day, I was thinking about fa
mous athletes. Not your Derek Jeters and
Kobe Bryants, but instead those athletes
that are famous for something other than
their own performance on the field or on
the court. For many, their stardom is a re
sult of something dubious, while others are
noted for being a part of a memorable mo
ment. Here is a list of some of the most no
table and some information about the
players themselves.
Craig Ehlo
I suppose this spot could also be given
to Bryon Russell, in the "I'm famous be
cause of Michael Jordan" category. Ehlo
was actually a pretty valuable NBA guard
for the Rockets, Cavaliers, Hawks and Su
personics. He played 14 seasons and aver
aged more than eight points a game and
for about four years, he was a pretty dam
good player for the Cavs. That said, most
people have heard of Craig Ehlo because
of Jim Durham's call on the Bulls' Radio
Network in a 1989 playoff game between
the Cavs and the Bulls.
The line, "Here's Michael at the foul
line, the shot on Eh 10... Good! The Bulls
win! They win!" may be what is most asso
ciated with what might be Michael Jor
dan's most iconic shot. It's appeared in
countless commercials and tribute films
and in every single one there's little
Craig Ehlo.
Tommy John
How many people can say they have a
surgery named after them? It's too bad

that many people don't know that
Tommy John is more than an elbow
ligament replacement surgery that
keeps baseball players sidelined for
about 18 months because the real
Tommy John was a pretty dam good
baseball player.
John arguably should be in the
MLB Hall of Fame. He pitched 26 sea
sons and won 288 games. He was a
four-time All Star and he pitched 15
seasons after having the surgery that
now bears his name. Not bad. Still, if
you Google Tommy John, you first get
stories about players getting the sur
gery and not articles about the player
himself.
Vic Wertz
Like John, Vic Wertz had a pretty
successful Major League career and
was a four-time All Star. He hit 266
home runs in 17 seasons. Yet Wertz,
like Ehlo, will always be remembered
for being the wrong end of a career
defining play by a legend.
While playing for the Cleveland In
dians in Game One of the 1954W0r1d
Series, Wertz drove a ball to deep, deep
centerfield.The trouble was that at the
Polo Grounds, the home of the New
York Giants, the center-field fence was
483 feet away and Willie Mays was
playing centerfield. Mays, of course,
ran down Wertz's ball about 450 feet
from home plate and made an over
the-shoulder basket catch. Today it is
simply known as, "The Catch."
Adam "Pacman" Jones

Yes, he was a high draft pick (No. 6
overall pick in the 2005 draft), but had
it not been for his legal troubles, Jones

likely would have just been known as
another NFL draft bust (ala Mike
Rumph or Phillip Buchanon).
Instead Jones is a consistent head
liner, even though he has done little to
nothing with his immense talent. He
was suspended for more than a full
season for his multiple arrests and for
essentially spending more time in strip
clubs than weight rooms. Yet people
are fascinated by Jones and he contin
ues to be a fan favorite,
Todd Bertuzzi
In the early 2000s,Bertuzzi was one
of the top power forwards in the NHL.
He had 46 goals and 97 points for the
Vancouver Canucks in 2002-03. He
has more than 700 points and almost
300 goals in his career. Yet Bertuzzi will
always be known for making one of
the most vicious cheap shots in the his
tory of the NHL.
Near the end of an 8-2 blowout in
March 2004, Bertuzzi went looking for
revenge against Colorado Avalanche's
Steve Moore, who injured one of
Bertuzzi's teammates earlier in the
season. Bertuzzi followed Moore
down the ice, and when Moore de
clined to fight, Bertuzzi sucker
punched him in the back of the head
and fell on top of him. Moore suffered
a concussion and fractured three ver
tebrae in his neck. His NHL career was
over.
Despite lots of tears and public and
private apologies, Bertuzzi will, right
fully or wrongfully, always be known
for that hit, and it will haunt his career
until he hangs up his skates.
Obviously, this list could go on and
on. Don't hesitate to tell me who else I
should have included.

mous athletes. Not your Derek Jeters and
Kobe Bryants, but instead those athletes
that are famous for something other than
their own performance on the field or on
the court. For many, their stardom is a re
sult of something dubious, while others are
noted for being a part of a memorable mo
ment. Here is a list of some of the most no
table and some information about the
players themselves.
Craig Ehlo
I suppose this spot could also be given
to Bryon Russell, in the "I'm famous be
cause of Michael Jordan" category. Ehlo
was actually a pretty valuable NBA guard
for the Rockets, Cavaliers, Hawks and Su
personics. He played 14 seasons and aver
aged more than eight points a game and
for about four years, he was a pretty dam
good player for the Cavs. That said, most
people have heard of Craig Ehlo because
of Jim Durham's call on the Bulls' Radio
Network in a 1989 playoff game between
the Cavs and the Bulls.
The line, "Here's Michael at the foul
line, the shot on Eh 10... Good! The Bulls
win! They win!" may be what is most asso
ciated with what might be Michael Jor
dan's most iconic shot. It's appeared in
countless commercials and tribute films
and in every single one there's little
Craig Ehlo.
Tommy John
How many people can say they have a
surgery named after them? It's too bad

that many people don't know that
Tommy John is more than an elbow
ligament replacement surgery that
keeps baseball players sidelined for
about 18 months because the real
Tommy John was a pretty dam good
baseball player.
John arguably should be in the
MLB Hall of Fame. He pitched 26 sea
sons and won 288 games. He was a
four-time All Star and he pitched 15
seasons after having the surgery that
now bears his name. Not bad. Still, if
you Google Tommy John, you first get
stories about players getting the sur
gery and not articles about the player
himself.
Vic Wertz
Like John, Vic Wertz had a pretty
successful Major League career and
was a four-time All Star. He hit 266
home runs in 17 seasons. Yet Wertz,
like Ehlo, will always be remembered
for being the wrong end of a career
defining play by a legend.
While playing for the Cleveland In
dians in Game One of the 1954W0r1d
Series, Wertz drove a ball to deep, deep
centerfield.The trouble was that at the
Polo Grounds, the home of the New
York Giants, the center-field fence was
483 feet away and Willie Mays was
playing centerfield. Mays, of course,
ran down Wertz's ball about 450 feet
from home plate and made an over
the-shoulder basket catch. Today it is
simply known as, "The Catch."
Adam "Pacman" Jones

Yes, he was a high draft pick (No. 6
overall pick in the 2005 draft), but had
it not been for his legal troubles, Jones

likely would have just been known as
another NFL draft bust (ala Mike
Rumph or Phillip Buchanon).
Instead Jones is a consistent head
liner, even though he has done little to
nothing with his immense talent. He
was suspended for more than a full
season for his multiple arrests and for
essentially spending more time in strip
clubs than weight rooms. Yet people
are fascinated by Jones and he contin
ues to be a fan favorite,
Todd Bertuzzi
In the early 2000s,Bertuzzi was one
of the top power forwards in the NHL.
He had 46 goals and 97 points for the
Vancouver Canucks in 2002-03. He
has more than 700 points and almost
300 goals in his career. Yet Bertuzzi will
always be known for making one of
the most vicious cheap shots in the his
tory of the NHL.
Near the end of an 8-2 blowout in
March 2004, Bertuzzi went looking for
revenge against Colorado Avalanche's
Steve Moore, who injured one of
Bertuzzi's teammates earlier in the
season. Bertuzzi followed Moore
down the ice, and when Moore de
clined to fight, Bertuzzi sucker
punched him in the back of the head
and fell on top of him. Moore suffered
a concussion and fractured three ver
tebrae in his neck. His NHL career was
over.
Despite lots of tears and public and
private apologies, Bertuzzi will, right
fully or wrongfully, always be known
for that hit, and it will haunt his career
until he hangs up his skates.
Obviously, this list could go on and
on. Don't hesitate to tell me who else I
should have included.
