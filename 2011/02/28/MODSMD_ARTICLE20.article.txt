# Athletes on the wrong side of fame

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Instead of the usual argumentative
column, I'm writing a bit more for
fun today. You probably won't have
a strong opinion about it, other than
maybe wanting to tell me that I for
got something but I still think it should
be fun.
The other day, I was thinking about fa
mous athletes. Not your Derek Jeters and
Kobe Bryants, but instead those athletes
that are famous for something other than
their own performance on the field or on
the court. For many, their stardom is a re
sult of something dubious, while others are
noted for being a part of a memorable mo
ment. Here is a list of some of the most no
table and some information about the
players themselves.
Craig Ehlo
I suppose this spot could also be given
to Bryon Russell, in the "I'm famous be
cause of Michael Jordan" category. Ehlo
was actually a pretty valuable NBA guard
for the Rockets, Cavaliers, Hawks and Su
personics. He played 14 seasons and aver
aged more than eight points a game and
for about four years, he was a pretty dam
good player for the Cavs. That said, most
people have heard of Craig Ehlo because
of Jim Durham's call on the Bulls' Radio
Network in a 1989 playoff game between
the Cavs and the Bulls.
The line, "Here's Michael at the foul
line, the shot on Eh 10... Good! The Bulls
win! They win!" may be what is most asso
ciated with what might be Michael Jor
dan's most iconic shot. It's appeared in
countless commercials and tribute films
and in every single one there's little
Craig Ehlo.
Tommy John
How many people can say they have a
surgery named after them? It's too bad
