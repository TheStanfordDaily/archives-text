## Card comeback saves sweep 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
A night after the Stanford
men's volleyball team showed
off its muscle in a four-set brawl
of a victory over No. 8 UCLA,
the Cardinal was just two points
from what wouldn't have been a
shocking, but certainly a sur
prising and painful home sweep
at the hands of UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Back to the wall, the Cardi
nal (12-4, 9-4 MPSF) steeled it
self, and, thanks to some timely
blocking, it kept the match alive
and eventually pulled out a dra
matic, 21-25,20-25,25-23,25-21,
15-10 victory in front of an ap
preciative crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
The Gauchos (10-7,8-6) dic
tated the pace of play early on
in the match and dominated
just about everything else as
well. They hit .448 as a team in
game one and were almost as
efficient in game two Stan
ford held the lead just once in
the first two sets.
It looked like the Cardinal
was on its way to another let
down at home, reminiscent of
the 3-0 loss to UC-San Diego
earlier this month, as UCSB
held a slim lead midway
through the third set at 10-9.
Stanford, to its credit, refused to
roll over and battled back to re

gain the lead at 16-13 with help
from six of junior outside hitter
Brad Lawson's match-high 25
kills.

But a service error from
sophomore outside hitter Jake
Kneller gave the lead back to
Santa Barbara, 18-17. After
trading the next few points, the
Cardinal clung to a precarious
23-22 lead. It was there that the
match turned, when Stanford
scrambled during a furious rally
and won a loose ball halfway in
the crowd that ended up being a
kill for senior outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin.
Now equipped with its first
set point of the match, Stan
ford's defense got a big stop
thanks to a team block by fresh
man middle blocker Denny
Falls and McLachlin, taking the
point and winning game three,
25-23.

Coach John Kosty was ex
tremely pleased with the way
his team responded under pres-

sure, if a bit perturbed that the Car
dinal let it come to that. He called
the team "simply resilient" and said
the team members really believe in
each other.
With the momentum finally on
Stanford's side to start the fourth
set, the Gauchos started to have all
kinds of trouble against the Cardi
nal's blocking. After hitting .450 in
games one and two, UCSB hit .296
in game three, a paltry .138 in game
four, and .250 in game five Stan
ford never trailed in either of the
last two sets.
Lawson hit a season-high .564
for the match with 25 kills and eight
digs. Junior setter Evan Barry
chipped in 51 assists and eight digs,
and after enduring some early
struggles, McLachlin finished with
14 kills, four assists, two aces, seven
digs and six blocks.
But Kosty may have found a
budding star in Falls. The little-used
freshman from Orland Park, 111.
came off the bench and sparked the
Cardinal with five kills, a service ace
and that critical block assist with
McLachlin.
"Denny's just an athletic and ex
plosive middle blocker," Kosty said.
"We wanted to change something
up and we gave Denny the opportu
nity. He came in, and he took full
advantage of it."
The turnaround was even more
rare than it might appear at first
glance. In the last seven years, Stan
ford has only come back from two

sets down to win twice, and never in
the last two seasons. But this year's
Cardinal is now 4-0 in five-set
matches.
It only took four sets to dispatch
UCLA (9-9, 4-8) on Friday night,
but the victory was closer than it ap
peared. Both teams hit over .400 on
the night, with Stanford coming in
at .458 to the Bruin's .403, and the
theme of the night was certainly of
fense.
The Cardinal took game one, 26-
24, thanks to seven kills from Law
son and six from McLachlin. But
the lead was short-lived, as UCLA
stormed out to a four-point lead at
10-6 and didn't blink in the face of
Stanford's attacks to earn the set
victory.
The Bruins were led by fresh
man Gonzalo Quiroga, who looked
very impressive and served five
consecutive points late in the third
set with three aces to retake the
lead for UCLA. Freshman outside
hitter Eric Mochalski had a nice kill
on another assist from Barry, one of
his career-high 54 in a four-set
match, to give Stanford a little mo
mentum toward the set victory.
Stanford got stronger as the
match went on, culminating in a
.500 hitting percentage in set four.
The Cardinal took the lead early
and never gave it back, running
away with a 25-17 set-clincher.
The weekend firmly solidified
Stanford's standing in the top three
of the brutal MPSF conference, but
there won't be any room for a let
down with trips to UC-Irvine and
UC-San Diego this weekend.

the 3-0 loss to UC-San Diego
earlier this month, as UCSB
held a slim lead midway
through the third set at 10-9.
Stanford, to its credit, refused to
roll over and battled back to re

gain the lead at 16-13 with help
from six of junior outside hitter
Brad Lawson's match-high 25
kills.

But a service error from
sophomore outside hitter Jake
Kneller gave the lead back to
Santa Barbara, 18-17. After
trading the next few points, the
Cardinal clung to a precarious
23-22 lead. It was there that the
match turned, when Stanford
scrambled during a furious rally
and won a loose ball halfway in
the crowd that ended up being a
kill for senior outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin.
Now equipped with its first
set point of the match, Stan
ford's defense got a big stop
thanks to a team block by fresh
man middle blocker Denny
Falls and McLachlin, taking the
point and winning game three,
25-23.

sure, if a bit perturbed that the Car
dinal let it come to that. He called
the team "simply resilient" and said
the team members really believe in
each other.
With the momentum finally on
Stanford's side to start the fourth
set, the Gauchos started to have all
kinds of trouble against the Cardi
nal's blocking. After hitting .450 in
games one and two, UCSB hit .296
in game three, a paltry .138 in game
four, and .250 in game five Stan
ford never trailed in either of the
last two sets.
Lawson hit a season-high .564
for the match with 25 kills and eight
digs. Junior setter Evan Barry
chipped in 51 assists and eight digs,
and after enduring some early
struggles, McLachlin finished with
14 kills, four assists, two aces, seven
digs and six blocks.
But Kosty may have found a
budding star in Falls. The little-used
freshman from Orland Park, 111.
came off the bench and sparked the
Cardinal with five kills, a service ace
and that critical block assist with
McLachlin.
"Denny's just an athletic and ex
plosive middle blocker," Kosty said.
"We wanted to change something
up and we gave Denny the opportu
nity. He came in, and he took full
advantage of it."
The turnaround was even more
rare than it might appear at first
glance. In the last seven years, Stan
ford has only come back from two

sets down to win twice, and never in
the last two seasons. But this year's
Cardinal is now 4-0 in five-set
matches.
It only took four sets to dispatch
UCLA (9-9, 4-8) on Friday night,
but the victory was closer than it ap
peared. Both teams hit over .400 on
the night, with Stanford coming in
at .458 to the Bruin's .403, and the
theme of the night was certainly of
fense.
The Cardinal took game one, 26-
24, thanks to seven kills from Law
son and six from McLachlin. But
the lead was short-lived, as UCLA
stormed out to a four-point lead at
10-6 and didn't blink in the face of
Stanford's attacks to earn the set
victory.
The Bruins were led by fresh
man Gonzalo Quiroga, who looked
very impressive and served five
consecutive points late in the third
set with three aces to retake the
lead for UCLA. Freshman outside
hitter Eric Mochalski had a nice kill
on another assist from Barry, one of
his career-high 54 in a four-set
match, to give Stanford a little mo
mentum toward the set victory.
Stanford got stronger as the
match went on, culminating in a
.500 hitting percentage in set four.
The Cardinal took the lead early
and never gave it back, running
away with a 25-17 set-clincher.
The weekend firmly solidified
Stanford's standing in the top three
of the brutal MPSF conference, but
there won't be any room for a let
down with trips to UC-Irvine and
UC-San Diego this weekend.

A night after the Stanford
men's volleyball team showed
off its muscle in a four-set brawl
of a victory over No. 8 UCLA,
the Cardinal was just two points
from what wouldn't have been a
shocking, but certainly a sur
prising and painful home sweep
at the hands of UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Back to the wall, the Cardi
nal (12-4, 9-4 MPSF) steeled it
self, and, thanks to some timely
blocking, it kept the match alive
and eventually pulled out a dra
matic, 21-25,20-25,25-23,25-21,
15-10 victory in front of an ap
preciative crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
The Gauchos (10-7,8-6) dic
tated the pace of play early on
in the match and dominated
just about everything else as
well. They hit .448 as a team in
game one and were almost as
efficient in game two Stan
ford held the lead just once in
the first two sets.
It looked like the Cardinal
was on its way to another let
down at home, reminiscent of
the 3-0 loss to UC-San Diego
earlier this month, as UCSB
