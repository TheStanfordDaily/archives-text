## Card comeback saves sweep 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
A night after the Stanford
men's volleyball team showed
off its muscle in a four-set brawl
of a victory over No. 8 UCLA,
the Cardinal was just two points
from what wouldn't have been a
shocking, but certainly a sur
prising and painful home sweep
at the hands of UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Back to the wall, the Cardi
nal (12-4, 9-4 MPSF) steeled it
self, and, thanks to some timely
blocking, it kept the match alive
and eventually pulled out a dra
matic, 21-25,20-25,25-23,25-21,
15-10 victory in front of an ap
preciative crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
The Gauchos (10-7,8-6) dic
tated the pace of play early on
in the match and dominated
just about everything else as
well. They hit .448 as a team in
game one and were almost as
efficient in game two Stan
ford held the lead just once in
the first two sets.
It looked like the Cardinal
was on its way to another let
down at home, reminiscent of
the 3-0 loss to UC-San Diego
earlier this month, as UCSB
held a slim lead midway
through the third set at 10-9.
Stanford, to its credit, refused to
roll over and battled back to re

gain the lead at 16-13 with help
from six of junior outside hitter
Brad Lawson's match-high 25
kills.

But a service error from
sophomore outside hitter Jake
Kneller gave the lead back to
Santa Barbara, 18-17. After
trading the next few points, the
Cardinal clung to a precarious
23-22 lead. It was there that the
match turned, when Stanford
scrambled during a furious rally
and won a loose ball halfway in
the crowd that ended up being a
kill for senior outside hitter
Spencer McLachlin.
Now equipped with its first
set point of the match, Stan
ford's defense got a big stop
thanks to a team block by fresh
man middle blocker Denny
Falls and McLachlin, taking the
point and winning game three,
25-23.

Coach John Kosty was ex
tremely pleased with the way
his team responded under pres-
