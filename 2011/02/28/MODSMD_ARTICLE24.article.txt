## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Behind its strongest all-around
shooting display of the year and a
dominant 31-point performance
from redshirt junior forward Josh
Owens, the Stanford men's basket
ball team picked up a much-needed
88-71 victory over Oregon on Satur
day night. With the win, the Card (14-
14, 7-10 Pac-10) snapped a four
game losing streak one more loss
would have matched the program's
longest losing streak in 18 years and
improves to .500 on the season.

The Ducks (14-14,7-9) got off to a
hot 8-0 start, opening the game with
two three-pointers and a dunk as the
Cardinal picked up three quick fouls.
Stanford remained scoreless until
3:40 had elapsed, when an Owens
layup turned into a three-point play
followed by four more consecutive
points from the veteran big-man.
A three from freshman guard
Aaron Bright with 10:29 left in the
half tied the game at 18-18, and the
Card took the lead on the next play
off another three-pointer from junior
guard Jeremy Green. Stanford con
tinued to widen the gap in the peri
od's waning minutes, entering the half
with a 43-34 advantage.
Junior guard Jarrett Mann sunk a
layup to open the second period, and
the Cardinal would maintain a dou

ble-digit lead and complete con
trol of the game for the duration.
Shots continued to fall for the Card
lineup, while Stanford's defense suc
cessfully shut down Oregon forward
Joevan Catron, holding the senior to
just eight points he averages 15.2
points per game in his final career
home game.
Despite double-digit second half
performances from senior guard Jay-
R Stowbridge and junior guard Mal
colm Armstead, with a respective 12
and 13 points in the period, the Ducks
failed to get into an offensive rhythm
and were outmatched by the bigger,
taller Cardinal squad. Stanford led by
as many as 20 points in the period be
fore sealing the 17-point victory.
Armstead led the Ducks with 22
points on 7-for-15 shooting and five
steals. Stowbridge added 16 and
freshman guard Johnathan Lloyd an
other 11, with both players coming off
the bench.
The star of the night on both ends
of the floor was Owens, who impres
sively racked up a career-high 31
points on 12-for-15 shooting in addi
tion to 11 rebounds and four blocks.
Four other Cardinal players ended
the night in double-digit scoring fig
ures, including Green with 15, Bright
with 13 and freshmen forwards An
thony Brown and Dwight Powell with
12 and 11 apiece. Powell matched
Owens' 11 rebounds, recording the
second double-double of his Stanford
career, while Mann led the game with
seven assists.
Stanford's shooting, which has fal
tered at multiple points this season,
was notable, with the team shooting

59.3 percent on the night and 65.2
percent in the second half alone. The
Cardinal also dominated the glass,
outboarding the Ducks, 36-21, and
recorded eight blocked shots to Ore
gon's one.
Tomorrow night, Stanford will
face non-conference opponent Seat
tle University at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion for its final home game of the
season.
