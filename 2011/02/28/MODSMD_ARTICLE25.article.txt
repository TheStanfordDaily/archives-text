# RAIN, USC SPOIL WEEKEND
## 
### ALEX ECKERT 
The Stanford men's tennis team
went 0-1 this weekend and left
Southern California with a feeling of
disappointment.
In a weekend hyped up as a clash
of Pac-10 titans, it was the weather
that defined the weekend as rain
cancelled one match and abbreviat
ed another.

First up was UCLA on Friday.
The Cardinal was itching to get back
at the Bruins after UCLA bounced
Stanford from last season's NCAA
Tournament in the round of 16. Both
the Cardinal (8-3) and Bruins (9-2)
are off to fantastic starts this season
and were looking to prove them
selves in Friday's match. Unfortu
nately, neither got that chance as rain
cancelled the match a few hours be
fore it was scheduled to begin.
Then came two-time defending
champion USC on Saturday. Stan
ford had gotten the best of its in-state
rivals last weekend at the ITA Na
tional Indoor Championships, 4-3,
but USC had the edge this time
around, winning in a 5-1 rout.
With rain clouds on the horizon,
doubles play was foregone in order
to start singles and come to a deci
sion as soon as possible. In the end,
cutting play short may have been un
necessary, as USC rolled to five
straight singles wins. Only one went
to three sets.
Sophomore Matt Kandath pulled
out the only victory for Stanford at
the No. 6 spot after the Cardinal had
fallen behind, 5-0. Kandath won his
match, 6-3,3-6,6-3.
Other players did not fare so well.

Defending NCAA singles cham
pion and ninth-ranked Bradley
Klahn fell to fourth-ranked Steve
Johnson of USC, 6-3, 6-3. Johnson
seems to have Klahn's number, as he
beat Klahn for the second time in as
many matches.
At the No. 2 spot for Stanford,
No. 52 Ryan Thacher fought valiant
ly but ultimately fell to No. 16 Daniel
Nguyen, 6-3,6-7,1-0 (10-7). Thacher
had beaten Nguyen last week and
this was the closest match of the top
five spots.
The key difference between this
week's match and last week's was
the return of No. 37 Ray Sarmiento

to the Trojan lineup. Sarmiento was
inserted at the No. 4 spot and proved
too much for Sophomore Denis Lin
to handle, winning the match 6-4,6-2.
Sarmiento's return shifted the
Trojan lineup favorably and USC's
Emilio Gomez rounded off the Tro
jans' five victories, breaking Greg
Hirschman's four-game winning
streak with a 7-6,6-1 victory over the
Stanford senior.
Head Coach John Whitlinger did
have some positive notes to say
about the game.
"I've gone down to L.A. many
times in my years as a coach and at
times we've gotten blasted down
there, but then we still beat them in
the NCAA Tournament,"
Whitlinger said with a smile. "So
whatever happened, there is still a
long way to go before the NCAAs."
However, after starting 7-0, Stan
ford has dropped three of its last four
matches. All have been against top
competition, so it is not too much
cause for worry. However, as a na
tional title contender, the Cardinal
will be hoping to develop more con
sistency against tough opponents.
USC, Stanford and UCLA are
the three leaders in NCAA men's
tennis titles with seventeen, sixteen
and fifteen titles, respectively. After
these Pac-10 powerhouses, the next
closest is Georgia with a mere six ti
tles. It is safe to say these schools will
be relevant in the national title hunt
going forward and as Whitlinger inti
mated, when they meet again, the re
sult is far from determined by Satur
day's results.
Stanford travels to the Pacific
Coast Doubles Tournament before
the start of Pac-10 play and will have
another shot at the L.A. schools at
home on March 25 and 26.
