### â€“ Matt Bettonville 
The men's indoor track team's
107.5 points topped Arizona's 102
to claim the team's first ever Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) championship last week
end. The MPSF for track was found
ed in 2002, and Stanford's previous
best finish was its runner-up posi
tion last year.
A key performance came when
Stanford placed four runners in the
top seven of the mile, led by senior
Elliott Heath's MPSF title-winning
time of 4:00.52. Junior Amaechi
Morton also claimed an individual
conference title in the 400 with his
time of 46.50.
The Stanford women took third
in their MSPF tournament, as Ore
gon took the championship. Senior
Whitney Liehr defended her MPSF
title in the triple jump for the
women's only individual title. The
finish was the Stanford women's
eighth consecutive third-place fin
ish in the MPSF.
