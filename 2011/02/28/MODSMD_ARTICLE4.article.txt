# STUDENT LIFE
## Parents' Weekend draws 3,500 to Farm 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Parents' Weekend, an annual showcase for
the parents of current undergraduates,
brought more than 3,500 pre-registered fami
ly members to campus over the weekend.This
attendance level represented a six percent in
crease from last year's 3,300 attendees.
"We have had a pretty steady increase in

attendance in the past, but over the last three
years, particularly, it has continued to grow,"
wrote Elaine Enos, executive director of the
Office of Stanford Events and Protocol, in an
e-mail to The Daily.
According to Enos, the increase in atten
dance may be due to a reconfiguration of the
Parents' Weekend website for this year's
event. She said the site included a "more user
friendly online registration system" and an

extended online registration date to give fam
ily members additional time to plan. Enos
added that promotion of the weekend during
New Student Orientation (NSO) in Septem
ber was another contributing factor to the
bump in attendance.

Parents' Weekend organizers followed the
strategy of attracting parents of students in all
class years, rather than focusing on
the freshman class.This approach ap
pears to be successful; nearly half of

all registrants were parents of upper
classmen, with almost equal num
bers from each of the three classes,
Enos said.
Many freshman parents were
eager to participate and, on the
whole, made up the largest block of
attending parents. The weekend was
the first major event designed specif

ically for parents since NSO and al
lowed them to interact with their
children in the campus setting.
"I loved having the opportunity
to see my son play in the band during
the sporting events that are taking
place this weekend," said Kathy
Griffis, mother of Max Praglin 'l4.
In addition to visiting with chil

dren informally and formally at resi
dence receptions and in dining halls,
parents' itineraries included many
workshops, panels, specialized tours
and classes to occupy their time on
the Farm.
In recent years, the variety of
tours has expanded to include sites
such as the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, the new Science and Engi
neering Quad and Sustainability on
the Farm. Staples such as the Stan
ford libraries and the Campus and
Architecture Tours were still offered.
"Our 'Back to School' classes
continue to be a highlight of the
weekend for parents," Enos said.
These classes covered a range of
topics, covering fields such as music
and medicine. Keynote events in
cluded Provost John Etchemendy's
official "Welcome to Parents" on Fri
day and President John Hennessy's
Q&A session later that afternoon.
Parents from California constitut
ed the largest percentage of atten
dees, but many came from far and
wide to explore the University. Enos
said that of the 1,857 households that
registered online, about 50 percent
were from California, with the rest
traveling from across the U.S. and
even some from foreign countries.
