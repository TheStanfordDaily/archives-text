## Petition for ROTC's return launched Conservatives respond to SSQL, quickly gather over 800 signatures 
### DANA EDWARDS STAFF WRITER 
A group of campus conservatives started a pe
tition in support of ROTC's return to Stanford.
This petition has gathered 812 signatures at the
time of publication.
The petition is the latest development in the
ongoing campus debate over the potential rein
troduction of the ROTC program to the Farm. It
serves as a response to a similar initiative
launched several weeks ago by Stanford Students
for Queer Liberation (SSQL), which oppose the
return of ROTC on the grounds that it would vio
late Stanford's non-discrimination clause.
When SSQL's petition launched, several stu
dents who support ROTC's return began talking
about issuing a counter-petition. Thomas Schultz
'll, one of the leaders of the Stanford Conserva
tive Society (SCS), spearheaded the effort by cre
ating the pro-ROTC petition on Feb. 22.
By the end of the day, Schultz's petition had
gathered several hundred signatures, surpassing
SSQL's total of 172 to date. It is hosted by Peti
tion Online.com, the same website that hosted
SSQL's petition. Unlike SSQL's, however,
Schultz's petition does not make signatures view
able, only displaying the latest cumulative total.
"When creating the petition, the Petition O
nline site seemed to indicate that if names were dis
played, then e-mail address and phone number
would also be displayed," Schultz wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "Therefore, we did not want
that information to be made public. It states be-
fore you sign your name that you
must be affiliated with Stanford
University, and our promotions
have only been to Stanford Univer
sity students, faculty or staff.
Schultz publicized the petition
by forwarding it widely to numer
ous e-mail lists across campus, but
emphasized that it is not officially
endorsed by SCS or any other or
ganization.
Like SSQL's petition, Schultz's
petition is prefaced with a short let
ter addressed to Stanford's Faculty
Senate, the body that commis
sioned the exploration of ROTC's
potential return. Last spring, the
Senate created an ad hoc commit
tee to investigate the issue, taking
into account popular opinion. Stu
dent efforts have been largely di
rected at swaying this committee,
which is set to announce its recom
mendation in May.
The letter articulates the stance
that both Stanford and the military
suffer from ROTC's absence on
campus.
"Our nation's military deserves
the best officers we can give it,"
Schultz wrote in the letter. "There
fore, elite colleges such as Stanford

should drop their historical sever
ance in order to enable students to
serve this vital public interest."
Kyle Huwa 'l3, another member
of SCS and a signer of the petition,
said it was important for the ad hoc
committee to see how many stu
dents support ROTC's reintroduc
tion.
"There's been a lot of pushback
against ROTC," Huwa said. "We
want to show the committee that
there are a lot of students support
ing [ROTC's return], especially
since the decision is drawing near
er."
In response to the argument ar
ticulated by SSQL that a cam
pus ROTC presence would exclude
transgender people who are barred
from service Huwa said a boy
cott could not effectively change
the military's policies because "the
military is not subject to market
conditions."
"It can't hurt to have talented
Stanford students in the military
working on the policy internally,"
Huwa said.
The success of the petition has
buoyed the optimism of advocates
for ROTC's return.
"I am very hopeful that the Fac
ulty Senate will vote to reintroduce
ROTC to campus," Schultz said.
