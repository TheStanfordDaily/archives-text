## Figueres talks Cancun, Copenhagen meetings UN 						official explores chances for future accords 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Following the UN Climate
Change Conference and the Con
ference of the Parties (COP) last
December, Christiana Figueres,
executive secretary of the UN
Framework for Climate Change
Convention, discussed global ef
forts to mitigate climate change
and deal with its effects in a talk at
the Stanford Law School on Fri
day.

Figueres touched upon the two
most recent conferences in
Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009,
and in Cancun, Mexico, in 2010,
outlining how key differences in
the conduct of each conference

led to drastically different out
comes.
Despite high expectations, del
egates left Copenhagen without
an agreement to rework the glob
al climate change regime. Accord
ing to Figueres, much of this fail
ure stemmed not from intractable
differences, but from procedural
mishaps.
At the end of the conference,
25 countries were invited to ham
mer out an agreement, leaving the
opinions of many smaller coun
tries out of the process.
"We're all affected by climate
and all of our opinions need to be
on the table," Figueres said.
"Countries already arrived in
Copenhagen not feeling happy
with what we call the 'transparen
cy and inclusiveness' of the
process because there were many
countries that felt left out."
She also mentioned that deci
sions at UN conferences are taken
by consensus and drew an impor
tant distinction between "consen
sus" and "unanimity." The hosts of
the Copenhagen conference did
not draw that distinction, making
it more or less impossible to come
to a framework agreement.
Figueres said that the atmos
phere in Cancun was much more
hospitable and that the hosts
learned from the failures at
Copenhagen. She called the agree
ment that came out of Cancun a
"miracle." The hosts strove to en
sure that every country's voice was
heard on at least one issue.
The actions of one country, Bo
livia, were emblematic of the
changes between Cancun and
Copenhagen. According to
Figueres, the Bolivian govern
ment's anti-capitalist ideology led
it to reject any form of agreement,

but this intransigence made other
countries coalesce around the
agreements.
The agreement eventually
passed because the Mexican For
eign Minister, who presided over
the conference, ruled that consen
sus was not the same as unanimity
and that she "would not ignore the
will of 192 countries versus one."
Figueres moved on to substan
tive differences between the two
conferences, specifically in their
approach to getting agreements
on the table. Copenhagen adopted
a "top-down" approach, where a
target was set and countries wran
gled over how to get to it.
In contrast, Cancun employed a
"bottom-up" system, where coun
tries tabled what they thought
they could achieve in terms of
emissions cuts and adopting green
technologies. Emissions cutback
commitments only came up to 60
percent of the desired total, but
still represented a significant step
forward.
Figueres went on to explore the
economic impacts of climate
change and how mitigation is in
the economic interest of many
countries.

"China is the most responsible
country," she said. "They're not
doing it to save the planet
they're doing it because they know
that's their competitive advan
tage.
"Just for their own economic
development, they need to bring
up the cost of labor, i.e. raise
wages," she added. "They know
they're going to lose that competi
tive advantage, but they are al
ready thinking forward to say,
'Okay, where is our next piece of
competitive advantage?"'
Figueres ended her talk by re
viewing the prospects for a new,
legally binding agreement to cut
carbon emissions to the necessary
level to mitigate climate change.
She said that the "price signal" has
not been strong enough to moti
vate enough research and devel
opment of new technologies, but
soon many companies and nations
would find it economically advan
tageous to be green.
"Are we going to do it? Yes!" she
said. "Why? Because we don't have
an option!"
