How to Lead a Good Life: Lessons from the Greeks
For decades, Marsh McCall has been one of the
most popular professors among Stanford
undergraduates, as well as a favorite traveling
companion in the Aegean with Stanford alumni.
He has an artist's ability to make the ancient
world come alive; and to bring Homer, Sophocles,
Euripides, and Aeschylus out of the past and into
our own world, where they seem to speak to us
with unfaded wisdom and insight.
This lecture is one of Professor McCall's masterpieces,
delivered a number of times never exactly the same
over the years. We have asked him for a repeat
performance for our extended Continuing Studies audience, and hope that you can join us for an
experience that might change your life. Professor McCall promises that it will, at least, make you
change your mind maybe five times in one night!
