## I HAVE TWO HEADS Across the Years 
### Rachel Kolb 
Sitting in the coffee shop, I am in
my element. My companion is
telling a lively story, I'm laugh
ing, and the time scrambles before
we part ways. As I slip out the door,
my companion tells me to say hello
to my parents, and that's when I re
member: she's their age, rather than
mine. But yet it is we who are
friends. Aren't we?
This sort of generation gap is
something that often strikes me,
since many people I like seeing
outside of my Stanford life are sig
nificantly older than I am. While
growing up, I always gravitated to
ward adult company to an unusual
degree, and since starting college,
I've transitioned into a more equal
relationship with those I once con
sidered only as teachers and role
models. A few of the people I con
sider friends are older than my par
ents, and their life circumstances
are starkly different from my
sweatshirt-wearing, bicycle-wield
ing existence in California. I enjoy
their company, but still grapple
with questions about the nature of
a friendship stretched across so
many years, questions about the
type of footing on which we can in
teract.
In a sense, these questions are
unnecessary. Friendship is friend
ship, in all its forms. No two rela
tionships have the same dynamic,
regardless, and variety in the age
and background of our friends only
adds spice to our lives, so to speak.
The older we get, the more the illu
sion of age vanishes. (Haven't we
all learned this in growing up to
view our parents more as fellow
human beings rather than as
supreme oracles?) Finally, the
beauty of being able to connect
with people despite divergent cir
cumstances is a testament to our
commonly held humanity, or what
ever you'd like to call it.
Still, age isn't just an illusion. It's
real and shapes our interactions
even if only subconsciously. For us
college students, can our friends
who are 30,40,50 or 60 years old be
called friends in the same sense as
our friends who are 20? Or should
we think of these older friends less
as friends and more as mentors?
Semantics can be tricky some
times. And the dilemmas of form
ing friendships with people who
are of different ages than we are
can be rather varied.
First of all, there is the question
of experience. In the case of older
friends, we find ourselves interact
ing with people who have more ex
periences than we do and more sto

ries to tell.They are undergoing life
stages with which we can't yet
identify, or for which we can't yet
provide concrete support. They
may have more resources at hand
or more advice to give. Through it
all, there looms the question of rec
iprocity: because we are still young,
it is sometimes easy to wonder how
much we have to offer in these re
lationships, besides our company.
We can sometimes feel like less
than peers.
From the flipside, friendships
across generations can grapple
with the question of fluidity. Older
friends can perceive themselves as
settled in their ways as stagnant
and boring, even. We, on the other
hand, are beautiful, free, young
spirits that should be out soaking
up the world, not languishing in
dull conversations about grown-up
stuff. Go on, enjoy being young!
Don't let the old folks tie you
down! Just as we can wonder how
well we can reciprocate given our
limited life experience, people sev
eral years older can wonder why
the heck 20-year-olds would want
to spend time with them.
For me, the answer is simple. I
enjoy having friends from different
age groups because I enjoy the
shift in perspective that such
friends can offer. Being at Stan
ford, we undergraduates are con
tinually exposed to the same clus-

Age isn't just an
illusion. It's real and

interactions even
if only
subconsciously

ter of peers. As wonderful as this
can be, it doesn't always provide
the opportunities for completely,
thought-provokingly diverse inter
action. Throw in the frequent on
campus perceptions that profes
sors are "unapproachable," that
graduate students are "busy" and
"have their own lives," and it can
become all too easy to forget the
feeling of living in a world in which
a larger age spectrum exists. Es
caping the usual set of cohorts,
even if only for an hour or two, can
be like a breath of fresh air.

As enjoyable as multi-genera
tional friendships are, I suppose

some doubts might always linger.
We, after all, often seek out social
interactions with people who are
like us. Differences in age are an
other way of pressing us beyond
that comfort zone. Even if we find
surprising similarities in someone
who is 20 or 30 years older than we
are, or in someone who is consider
ably younger, those very differ
ences in age might predispose us to
feelings of uncertainty. We wonder
what level of familiarity is appro
priate, how much confidence we
can share, how this relationship
stacks up beside the others in our
lives.

Ultimately, I would argue that
we ask ourselves these questions
about everyone. Differences in age
can make them seem more
poignant, but the answers we come
up with just make life more inter
esting. After all, which of us Stan
ford students wants to be with
other Stanford students all the
time? Tempting, but I'll pass.

it is sometimes easy to wonder how
much we have to offer in these re
lationships, besides our company.
We can sometimes feel like less
than peers.
From the flipside, friendships
across generations can grapple
with the question of fluidity. Older
friends can perceive themselves as
settled in their ways as stagnant
and boring, even. We, on the other
hand, are beautiful, free, young
spirits that should be out soaking
up the world, not languishing in
dull conversations about grown-up
stuff. Go on, enjoy being young!
Don't let the old folks tie you
down! Just as we can wonder how
well we can reciprocate given our
limited life experience, people sev
eral years older can wonder why
the heck 20-year-olds would want
to spend time with them.
For me, the answer is simple. I
enjoy having friends from different
age groups because I enjoy the
shift in perspective that such
friends can offer. Being at Stan
ford, we undergraduates are con
tinually exposed to the same clus-

ter of peers. As wonderful as this
can be, it doesn't always provide
the opportunities for completely,
thought-provokingly diverse inter
action. Throw in the frequent on
campus perceptions that profes
sors are "unapproachable," that
graduate students are "busy" and
"have their own lives," and it can
become all too easy to forget the
feeling of living in a world in which
a larger age spectrum exists. Es
caping the usual set of cohorts,
even if only for an hour or two, can
be like a breath of fresh air.

As enjoyable as multi-genera
tional friendships are, I suppose

some doubts might always linger.
We, after all, often seek out social
interactions with people who are
like us. Differences in age are an
other way of pressing us beyond
that comfort zone. Even if we find
surprising similarities in someone
who is 20 or 30 years older than we
are, or in someone who is consider
ably younger, those very differ
ences in age might predispose us to
feelings of uncertainty. We wonder
what level of familiarity is appro
priate, how much confidence we
can share, how this relationship
stacks up beside the others in our
lives.

Ultimately, I would argue that
we ask ourselves these questions
about everyone. Differences in age
can make them seem more
poignant, but the answers we come
up with just make life more inter
esting. After all, which of us Stan
ford students wants to be with
other Stanford students all the
time? Tempting, but I'll pass.

Sitting in the coffee shop, I am in
my element. My companion is
telling a lively story, I'm laugh
ing, and the time scrambles before
we part ways. As I slip out the door,
my companion tells me to say hello
to my parents, and that's when I re
member: she's their age, rather than
mine. But yet it is we who are
friends. Aren't we?
This sort of generation gap is
something that often strikes me,
since many people I like seeing
outside of my Stanford life are sig
nificantly older than I am. While
growing up, I always gravitated to
ward adult company to an unusual
degree, and since starting college,
I've transitioned into a more equal
relationship with those I once con
sidered only as teachers and role
models. A few of the people I con
sider friends are older than my par
ents, and their life circumstances
are starkly different from my
sweatshirt-wearing, bicycle-wield
ing existence in California. I enjoy
their company, but still grapple
with questions about the nature of
a friendship stretched across so
many years, questions about the
type of footing on which we can in
teract.
In a sense, these questions are
unnecessary. Friendship is friend
ship, in all its forms. No two rela
tionships have the same dynamic,
regardless, and variety in the age
and background of our friends only
adds spice to our lives, so to speak.
The older we get, the more the illu
sion of age vanishes. (Haven't we
all learned this in growing up to
view our parents more as fellow
human beings rather than as
supreme oracles?) Finally, the
beauty of being able to connect
with people despite divergent cir
cumstances is a testament to our
commonly held humanity, or what
ever you'd like to call it.
Still, age isn't just an illusion. It's
real and shapes our interactions
even if only subconsciously. For us
college students, can our friends
who are 30,40,50 or 60 years old be
called friends in the same sense as
our friends who are 20? Or should
we think of these older friends less
as friends and more as mentors?
Semantics can be tricky some
times. And the dilemmas of form
ing friendships with people who
are of different ages than we are
can be rather varied.
First of all, there is the question
of experience. In the case of older
friends, we find ourselves interact
ing with people who have more ex
periences than we do and more sto

ries to tell.They are undergoing life
stages with which we can't yet
identify, or for which we can't yet
provide concrete support. They
may have more resources at hand
or more advice to give. Through it
all, there looms the question of rec
iprocity: because we are still young,
it is sometimes easy to wonder how
much we have to offer in these re
lationships, besides our company.
We can sometimes feel like less
than peers.
