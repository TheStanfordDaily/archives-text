# OP-ED
## Darth Vader Says "Yes" To the ROTC 
### KEITH SUDHEIMER, POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW 
One might get the idea that
the only justification for op
posing ROTC on campus is
because of the military's discrimi
natory practices against members
of the LGBT community. In the fog
of the post-9/11 patriotic fever, we
may have lost sight of the issues that
drove anti-war movements of the
past.
The goal of most higher educa
tion is to teach the mind how to
think, not what to think. Many un
dergraduate freshmen that do not
understand this can be heard moan
ing phrases like "Why do I have to
waste my time on all of these re
quired courses! They have nothing
to do with my major!" The reason is
this: exposure to mathematics, phi
losophy, ethics, logic and art allows
one to go through the process of
learning how to learn. You learn
how to become a free thinker. The
process teaches you how to over
throw your previous beliefs and to
think critically and clearly about
complex issues in the world whilst
avoiding pitfalls and logical fallacies
that easily ensnare the uneducated.
If this is the goal, then military
service and membership in the
ROTC is the antithesis of this goal.
In the military, an individual is
turned into a tool, a machine that
obeys the chain of command. It is
necessary to divorce the individ
ual's ethical reasoning from his/her
actions or risks paralysis. Once en
listed, military personnel largely do
not have the luxury of choosing to
fight in only morally defensible
wars.
This is the parable portrayed in
the 1970s by George Lucas
throughout the Star Wars movies

using Darth Vader. Darth Vader be
comes both literally and figurative
ly the machine of the Empire and
commits many atrocities in the
name of defending it. Only when his
morality is resurrected does he
cease to be the machine. (Seriously,
if you were distracted by the light
sabers and missed that part, go
watch it again.)
Now, consider how you might
weigh the moral defensibility of the
purposeful U.S. napalming of civil
ians in Tokyo and other cities in
WWII or the subsequent use of two
nuclear weapons, killing many hun
dreds of thousands of civilians only
to secure more favorable terms of
surrender (Alderaan ... anyone? ..
. anyone ?). Maybe it would be worth
it. Maybe it would be justifiable to
some.The point is that the guys in the
planes that dropped those bombs
didn't grapple with that, because it
was their job to follow to the orders,
not to decide them.
Stanley Milgram's obedience ex
periments in the 1960s at Yale and
Phillip Zimbardo's prison experi
ment conducted on this very cam
pus in the 1970s potently demon
strate the power of an authority, an
institution and a role in overriding
an individual's sense of morality. We
know how to mechanize people.
The military does this with exceed
ing efficiency.
If the goal of higher education is
to nurture the parts of the mind that
can think independently, why
should we subject students to an in
stitution that works counter to that
purpose?
