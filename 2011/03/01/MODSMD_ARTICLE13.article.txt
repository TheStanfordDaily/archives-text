# FRESHLY BAKED
## Samoas are Caramel DeLites 
### Tim Moon 
It's that time of year again. Girl
Scout cookies are back!
Two days ago, I was leaving a
grocery store with a bag of candy,
and much to my delight, there were
two little Girl Scouts sitting behind
a small plastic table set up in front
of the store covered with boxes of
Girl Scout cookies. Despite the fact
that I was already holding a bag full
of sugar, I just had to get a box of
cookies. It's all for a good cause.
I ended up getting a box of Thin
Mints, but while I was deliberating,
I noticed that some of the cookies
had different names than what I
was used to seeing. Caramel
DeLites, those devilishly delicious
bites of vanilla cookies draped with
caramel and coconut and striped
with chocolate, were called
Samoas. Peanut Butter Patties,
those hefty, chocolate-covered
pucks of peanut butter and cookie,
were called Tagalongs. My fa
vorites, Peanut Butter Sandwiches,
were called Do-Si-Dos. Even
Shortbreads, a.k.a. the worst Girl
Scout cookies, were renamed, to
Trefoils.
What was this? What was wrong
with the names I grew up with? If
someone says to you, "here, have a
Caramel DeLite," you know that
you'll be getting a delightful
caramel treat. It doesn't get much
clearer than Peanut Butter Sand
wiches. And when you walk up to a
Girl Scout cookie table and see
only boxes labeled Shortbreads,
you know to walk away immediate-

ly (I actually really like shortbread,
but Shortbreads are another story).
But if someone offers you a Taga
long, you'll either: a) think they're
just being really clingy or b) need to
ask for further explanation, which
is 10 whole seconds of your life that
could have been saved if they had
just offered you a Peanut Butter
Patty. In those 10 seconds, you
could have eaten a second Peanut
Butter Patty. Does that make the

stakes clearer?
Names are funny. After I got
back from the grocery, I was
preparing a pork belly in the
kitchen when a housemate came in.
While we were talking about the
name "pork belly" (which sounds a
whole lot better than "1.5-pound
slab of unsliced bacon"), we some
how got to talking about our own
names. She mentioned that what
everyone called her here was actu
ally different than what she was
known by back home. For whatever
reason, one of her freshman year
friends had just started calling her
this new name, and as everyone
thought that they were super close,
everyone started calling her this
name as well. Can you imagine hav
ing the name you're known by be
decided by such an arbitrary thing
like that?
Well, sure. Your parents picked
your name for you.There's so much
power in a name, it seems almost
unfair that choosing it was out of
your hands. I mean, if I tell you that
your choices for a blind date are be
tween Gilligan, Mark and Spike,
you're probably going to assign
imaginary faces or traits to these
names that are similar to what most
people would assign.
We do have a little flexibility.
Whenever I write my name on a
paper or test, I write my given name,
Timothy. Everywhere else, I mostly
go by Tim, although maybe a third of
my friends call me Timmy. People

Girl Scout cookies
show how hard it is
to change
something so tied
in with your
identity

sometimes ask me what determines
which name I go by, and while I
can't really explain it myself, it usu
ally just comes down to how I want
to appear to that person.
In high school, I took it one step
further and tried to give myself the
nickname Moose. A couple of peo
ple actually started calling me
Moose, probably tickled by the
fact that they could now say they
knew a Moose, but most of my
close friends refused to go along
with my power play. At that point,
I really envied the foreign ex
change students who got to choose
their own English name.
The Moose experiment and the
Girl Scout cookies show how hard
it is to change something so tied in
with your identity, but since when
does something being hard stop
Stanford students? We spend so
much time grooming ourselves,
choosing the right clothes, working
out to stay in shape, why don't we
spend time thinking of a name that
better suits us? Sure, there are a lot
of practical and professional rea
sons to dissuade us, and I'm not
suggesting that we all go and get
legal name changes (although
that'd be cool), but it might just be
something fun to try.
As long as you don't decide on a
nonsense name like Do-Si-Do.
