## [ __ ] at Stanford: NAACP's Effort to Foster Multicultural Understanding 
### 
Dear Editor,
Last week, the Opinions section
featured an article by Alex Hicks-
Nelson that referenced our Stan
ford NAACP event "Black at Stan
ford" in relation to her column "Re
ality Check" on electronic Black
discourse at Stanford. Though we
appreciate the fact that our event
was viewed as "interesting," Nel
son's article simultaneously includ

ed a degree of ambivalence that ne
cessitates some clarification about
the purpose of our project.
It is evident on Stanford's cam
pus that people do not recognize
the viewpoints of other students on
the topic of race as it intersects with
a kaleidoscope of social constructs
like class, gender, sexuality and reli
gion. This conversation is often sup
pressed by a "political correctness"
that is convenient and sometimes
even comforting, but is neither pro
gressive nor personal enough to an
swer the question: "How might race
impact my own life?"
Though some believe that Stan

ford race relations are not any dif
ferent than outside "the bubble,"
Stanford NAACP's initial discus
sion on black identity has already
attested to the unique experiences
of members of the Diaspora at
Stanford. From a single discussion,
we have already realized a wide
range of experiences that revive the
meaning of the 2010 Black Plaza
shirts lettered "I Am The Diaspo
ra," with identities ranging from
"Astronauts" to "Jewish." We are
documenting how socioeconomics,
how being biracial and ideas of
"passing," how learning in majori
ty-minority high schools and how
being a minority in a predominant
ly white institution affect views of
blackness at Stanford. These are
powerful narratives and are only
just the beginning of the developing
picture.
For clarification, "Black at Stan
ford" is only the first part of a larger
project called "[ ] at Stan
ford" (pronounced "Blank" at Stan
ford). [ ] at Stanford is an
ongoing series depicting various per
spectives, experiences, trials and suc
cesses of the various demographics
represented on the Stanford campus.
We seek to promote cultural appre
ciation and awareness through a se
ries of interviews, forums and sincere
conversations within different de
mographic groups that will, upon
completion, be shown to the greater
Stanford population in the form of a
documentary.

The beauty of our project is that
it allows people to think, to connect
and to speak from a more educated
perspective on the thoughts and ex
periences of others whose ideas
they may have otherwise disregard
ed. Our organization holds firm to
the belief that one may speak of the
events and experiences of others,
but you cannot adequately speak
from their perspective, as perspec
tive is, especially when racially
grounded, deeply personal.
If you would like your perspec
tive to be included in this education
al project in the form of an inter
view or you are hosting an event
along these lines, do not hesitate to
contact the coordinators, Christian
Beauvoir (beauvoir@stanford.edu)
and Olivia Smarr (osmarr@stan
ford.edu). If you simply want to
learn from your peers, come to our
next [ ] at Stanford discussion.
But most importantly, initiate the
conversation on your own terms.
In Justice,
CHRISTIAN BEAUVOIR 'l4, OLIVIA
SMARR 'l4, MATT MILLER 'l2
