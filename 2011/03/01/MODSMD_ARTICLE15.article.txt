### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis
team continued to demonstrate its
dominance as it easily disposed of
two Pac-10 rivals over the week
end. Despite just returning from
the ITA National Team Indoor
Championships last Wednesday
and dealing with subpar weather
conditions on the Farm, Stanford
(11-0,2-0 Pac-10) proved to be on
top of its game.
On Friday afternoon, the Cardi
nal swept Oregon (6-4,0-2 Pac-10)
by a score of 7-0, and then on Sat
urday, coasted past Washington
State (8-5,0-2 Pac-10) as well, dis
posing of the Cougars, 7-0.

After capturing the indoor title
over No. 2 Florida in Char
lottesville, Va., over Presidents'
Day weekend, No. 1 Stanford con
tinued to exert its power over its
opponents with these two key vic
tories. With the two wins, the Cardi
nal has prolonged its NCAA
record home winning streak to 171
matches, a stretch spanning 12
years.
Freshman Kristie Ahn under
stands the hardships of returning
from a cross-country trek only to
face two major rivals days later.
"The past week has been espe

cially rough, making up work from
missing school and such," she said.
Despite the adjustments the
team had to make, the Cardinal
still got the job done.
"These victories were key in
maintaining our momentum," Ahn
said. "It's easy to become compla
cent after winning a big tourna
ment, but we were looking to keep
dominating, so these were both im
portant wins for our team."
Singles matches were played
first under the threat of rain on Fri
day afternoon at Taube Tennis Sta
dium, with Ahn defeating Ore
gon's Rabea Stuckemann, 6-1,6-0,
on court four in the first match. On
court two, sophomore Mallory
Burdette followed close behind
with a victory over Patricia
Skowronski, 6-2,6-1. The Cardinal
also clinched the next three points
with victories from sophomore
Stacey Tan over the Ducks' Pascale

Neubert, 6-1,6-4; freshman Nicole
Gibbs over Julia Metzger, 6-0, 6-2;
and senior Jennifer Yen over Lana
Buttner, 6-0,4-6,6-2. Last to finish
the singles point was senior Hilary
Barte on court one, beating Ore
gon's Pavlina Smatova, 6-3,7-5.
Stanford also swept the doubles
point, with the team of Ahn/Gibbs
cruising past Smatova/Skowrons
ki, 8-1. Senior Carolyn
McVeigh/Tan on court three fin
ished next with an 8-4 victory over
Neubert/Stuckemann, and the sec
ond team of Burdette/Yen con
cluded the match with an 8-4 tri
umph overTrudie duToit/Metzger.
Weather was definitely a signif
icant factor in this match.
"The conditions were tough for
everyone, even though Oregon and
Washington State usually play in
doors, because we just came back
