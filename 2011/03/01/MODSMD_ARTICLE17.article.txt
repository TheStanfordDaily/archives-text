# NCAA needs exit exam
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Greg McElroy is smarter
than you. Well, maybe
not, considering this
paper's audience, but
the Rhodes finalist and
Alabama quarterback notched a
near-perfect score in the Wonderlic,
the timed test given to NFL prospects
to try and gauge intelligence and
problem-solving ability. The partici
pant has 12 minutes to solve 50 ques
tions. Only once has a player scored a
(verified) 50 Harvard's Pat Mcl
nally in the 19705. McElroy's 48,
leaked this weekend, would place him
right at the top of active NFL players.
(Try it yourself I did. McElroy beat
me.)
Rarely do we hear stories like this.
The occasional brainiac scores 40-
plus, but often, the tales are of incom
prehensibly low totals. Vince Young,
who would go on to be the No. 3 pick
in the 2006 draft, tallied six points on
his first attempt at the Wonderlic. Jeff
George, a top overall selection, scored
10 points, just beating out Sebastian
Janikowski, who managed to get nine
points.
In a football sense, this can mean
very little. One can demonstrate intel
ligence on the field even if he can't fig
ure out logic problems. Dan Marino,
who owns just about every passing
record imaginable, scored a whopping
16 points on the Wonderlic. Needless
to say, studies have shown that this test
is not predictive of gridiron success.
But there is a larger, educational,
non-football point to be made. Fan
house's Clay Travis makes it: "All
Wonderlic scores should be public.
And if you've been eligible at a school
four years and test sub-literate, your
school should lose 'ship."
There's a lot to look at in that
tweet, so let's unpack it.
First, Wonderlic scores are kept
private and released only when a
writer finds a good source or the play
er broadcasts his result. Second, a
score below 10 indicates "literacy
problems." It makes sense: without
climbing on too high of a pedestal,
many of the questions are so basic to
understand (and solve) that unless
there is a legitimate issue reading the
problem, it's hard to imagine that any
one with, ostensibly, a college educa
tion would be able to get them wrong.
Putting aside people with legiti
mate and serious learning disabilities
for a moment, let's look at what Travis
is saying. Theoretically, the "student"
comes before "athlete," and if a uni
versity's goal is to educate, then it must
follow through even with people
who wouldn't be there if not for their
skills with a pigskin. We could use up
every inch of this broadsheet (and
many, many more) detailing the aca
demic travesties that come with big
time college football, from admitting
students who barely qualify to ram

pant cheating and plagiarism to ath
letes being suspended, routinely, for
being unable to meet minimum
scholastic requirements. Too often,
"student" does not come before "ath
lete." Coaches will pay lip service to
the idea but rarely practice what they
preach, mainly because there is no
person or mechanism there to stop
them.
Which leads us to the final clause
of the tweet: penalties in this case,
in the form of a lost scholarship for
not properly educating your athletes.
I love it.
Schools don't need to make every
football player a rocket scientist. But
players should at least be at basic lit
eracy levels. It is the lowest of low
bars. And if they can't surpass it
again, excluding actual disabilities
and not just stupidity then there is
something fundamentally wrong with
the way their institution has gone
about educating them. The institu
tions should be punished accordingly.
To make it work, the Wonderlic
would have to be given to all graduat

ing players, not just the ones who are
trying to make it in the NFL. An
NCAA-mandated exit exam, if you
will. The Wonderlic itself is not per
fect, but it does test the crucial part of
the collegiate experience: analytical
skills. University education is less
about learning straight facts hello,
high school and more about devel
oping problem-solving techniques
and the ability to think critically. The
Wonderlic's value is in its examina
tion of those proficiencies, even as
many of its questions appeal to the
lowest common denominator.
Let's be clear.This isn't about pub
lic shaming and embarrassment (of
players). It's about ensuring that uni
versities fulfill the most rudimentary
goals of education. If they cannot do
that, they ought to be called on it and
lose a scholarship for every player
they, as an institution, failed.
I'd like to see the school that
protests. If you can't prove that your
athletes can read, you don't deserve to
field a checkers team, much less a full
squad of football players.

Wyndam Makowsky won't release
his Wonderlic score, but sources are
reporting it's an even, prime number.

Rarely do we hear stories like this.
The occasional brainiac scores 40-
plus, but often, the tales are of incom
prehensibly low totals. Vince Young,
who would go on to be the No. 3 pick
in the 2006 draft, tallied six points on
his first attempt at the Wonderlic. Jeff
George, a top overall selection, scored
10 points, just beating out Sebastian
Janikowski, who managed to get nine
points.
In a football sense, this can mean
very little. One can demonstrate intel
ligence on the field even if he can't fig
ure out logic problems. Dan Marino,
who owns just about every passing
record imaginable, scored a whopping
16 points on the Wonderlic. Needless
to say, studies have shown that this test
is not predictive of gridiron success.
But there is a larger, educational,
non-football point to be made. Fan
house's Clay Travis makes it: "All
Wonderlic scores should be public.
And if you've been eligible at a school
four years and test sub-literate, your
school should lose 'ship."
There's a lot to look at in that
tweet, so let's unpack it.
First, Wonderlic scores are kept
private and released only when a
writer finds a good source or the play
er broadcasts his result. Second, a
score below 10 indicates "literacy
problems." It makes sense: without
climbing on too high of a pedestal,
many of the questions are so basic to
understand (and solve) that unless
there is a legitimate issue reading the
problem, it's hard to imagine that any
one with, ostensibly, a college educa
tion would be able to get them wrong.
Putting aside people with legiti
mate and serious learning disabilities
for a moment, let's look at what Travis
is saying. Theoretically, the "student"
comes before "athlete," and if a uni
versity's goal is to educate, then it must
follow through even with people
who wouldn't be there if not for their
skills with a pigskin. We could use up
every inch of this broadsheet (and
many, many more) detailing the aca
demic travesties that come with big
time college football, from admitting
students who barely qualify to ram

pant cheating and plagiarism to ath
letes being suspended, routinely, for
being unable to meet minimum
scholastic requirements. Too often,
"student" does not come before "ath
lete." Coaches will pay lip service to
the idea but rarely practice what they
preach, mainly because there is no
person or mechanism there to stop
them.
Which leads us to the final clause
of the tweet: penalties in this case,
in the form of a lost scholarship for
not properly educating your athletes.
I love it.
Schools don't need to make every
football player a rocket scientist. But
players should at least be at basic lit
eracy levels. It is the lowest of low
bars. And if they can't surpass it
again, excluding actual disabilities
and not just stupidity then there is
something fundamentally wrong with
the way their institution has gone
about educating them. The institu
tions should be punished accordingly.
To make it work, the Wonderlic
would have to be given to all graduat

ing players, not just the ones who are
trying to make it in the NFL. An
NCAA-mandated exit exam, if you
will. The Wonderlic itself is not per
fect, but it does test the crucial part of
the collegiate experience: analytical
skills. University education is less
about learning straight facts hello,
high school and more about devel
oping problem-solving techniques
and the ability to think critically. The
Wonderlic's value is in its examina
tion of those proficiencies, even as
many of its questions appeal to the
lowest common denominator.
Let's be clear.This isn't about pub
lic shaming and embarrassment (of
players). It's about ensuring that uni
versities fulfill the most rudimentary
goals of education. If they cannot do
that, they ought to be called on it and
lose a scholarship for every player
they, as an institution, failed.
I'd like to see the school that
protests. If you can't prove that your
athletes can read, you don't deserve to
field a checkers team, much less a full
squad of football players.

his Wonderlic score, but sources are
reporting it's an even, prime number.
