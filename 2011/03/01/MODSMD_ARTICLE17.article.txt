# NCAA needs exit exam

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Greg McElroy is smarter
than you. Well, maybe
not, considering this
paper's audience, but
the Rhodes finalist and
Alabama quarterback notched a
near-perfect score in the Wonderlic,
the timed test given to NFL prospects
to try and gauge intelligence and
problem-solving ability. The partici
pant has 12 minutes to solve 50 ques
tions. Only once has a player scored a
(verified) 50 Harvard's Pat Mcl
nally in the 19705. McElroy's 48,
leaked this weekend, would place him
right at the top of active NFL players.
(Try it yourself I did. McElroy beat
me.)
Rarely do we hear stories like this.
The occasional brainiac scores 40-
plus, but often, the tales are of incom
prehensibly low totals. Vince Young,
who would go on to be the No. 3 pick
in the 2006 draft, tallied six points on
his first attempt at the Wonderlic. Jeff
George, a top overall selection, scored
10 points, just beating out Sebastian
Janikowski, who managed to get nine
points.
In a football sense, this can mean
very little. One can demonstrate intel
ligence on the field even if he can't fig
ure out logic problems. Dan Marino,
who owns just about every passing
record imaginable, scored a whopping
16 points on the Wonderlic. Needless
to say, studies have shown that this test
is not predictive of gridiron success.
But there is a larger, educational,
non-football point to be made. Fan
house's Clay Travis makes it: "All
Wonderlic scores should be public.
And if you've been eligible at a school
four years and test sub-literate, your
school should lose 'ship."
There's a lot to look at in that
tweet, so let's unpack it.
First, Wonderlic scores are kept
private and released only when a
writer finds a good source or the play
er broadcasts his result. Second, a
score below 10 indicates "literacy
problems." It makes sense: without
climbing on too high of a pedestal,
many of the questions are so basic to
understand (and solve) that unless
there is a legitimate issue reading the
problem, it's hard to imagine that any
one with, ostensibly, a college educa
tion would be able to get them wrong.
Putting aside people with legiti
mate and serious learning disabilities
for a moment, let's look at what Travis
is saying. Theoretically, the "student"
comes before "athlete," and if a uni
versity's goal is to educate, then it must
follow through even with people
who wouldn't be there if not for their
skills with a pigskin. We could use up
every inch of this broadsheet (and
many, many more) detailing the aca
demic travesties that come with big
time college football, from admitting
students who barely qualify to ram
