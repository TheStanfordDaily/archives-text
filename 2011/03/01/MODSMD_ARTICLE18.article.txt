# Cardinal a shade better than Crimson
## Stanford ekes out win over Harvard 
### REBECCA HANLEY 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team improved its record to 4-0 this
Sunday at Cagan Stadium with a
win over Harvard. The game was
hard fought for both sides, and the
Cardinal's 18-17 victory did not
come easily.
The Crimson (0-1) led the game
early, taking a quick 2-0 lead within
the first three minutes of the game.
This was the first time all season
that No. 13 Stanford (4-0, 1-0
MPSF) had trailed, and the Cardi
nal took a while to regroup.
While Stanford was trying to
find its groove, the Crimson built up
its lead to 9-5 with 6:47 left in the
first half. In order to allow her team
to regroup, Stanford head coach
Amy Bokker called a timeout. The
move did just that, and a new team
stepped back on the field, full of en
ergy and poise.

"The whole first half we were
feeling a little jittery," said sopho
more defender Elizabeth Adam.
"But when the coaches pulled us in
for the timeout, they told us, com
pletely calmly, that they had faith in
us to pull this game out. That really
calmed us down and got our heads
back in the fight."
With only a few minutes left in
the first half, the Cardinal scored
four consecutive goals to tie the
game at 9-9. Coming off the bench,
sophomore midfielder Jacqueline
Candelaria added two goals and the
energy the team needed to close in
on the Crimson. Senior midfielder
Leslie Foard scored the final goal of
the half to complete her hat trick
and to tie the game with just 47 sec
onds left.
Just 13 seconds into the second
half, Stanford took its first lead of
the game with a goal by senior mid-
