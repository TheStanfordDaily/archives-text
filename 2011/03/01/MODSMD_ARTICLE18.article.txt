# Cardinal a shade better than Crimson
## Stanford ekes out win over Harvard 
### REBECCA HANLEY 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team improved its record to 4-0 this
Sunday at Cagan Stadium with a
win over Harvard. The game was
hard fought for both sides, and the
Cardinal's 18-17 victory did not
come easily.
The Crimson (0-1) led the game
early, taking a quick 2-0 lead within
the first three minutes of the game.
This was the first time all season
that No. 13 Stanford (4-0, 1-0
MPSF) had trailed, and the Cardi
nal took a while to regroup.
While Stanford was trying to
find its groove, the Crimson built up
its lead to 9-5 with 6:47 left in the
first half. In order to allow her team
to regroup, Stanford head coach
Amy Bokker called a timeout. The
move did just that, and a new team
stepped back on the field, full of en
ergy and poise.

"The whole first half we were
feeling a little jittery," said sopho
more defender Elizabeth Adam.
"But when the coaches pulled us in
for the timeout, they told us, com
pletely calmly, that they had faith in
us to pull this game out. That really
calmed us down and got our heads
back in the fight."
With only a few minutes left in
the first half, the Cardinal scored
four consecutive goals to tie the
game at 9-9. Coming off the bench,
sophomore midfielder Jacqueline
Candelaria added two goals and the
energy the team needed to close in
on the Crimson. Senior midfielder
Leslie Foard scored the final goal of
the half to complete her hat trick
and to tie the game with just 47 sec
onds left.
Just 13 seconds into the second
half, Stanford took its first lead of
the game with a goal by senior mid-

fielder Karen Nesbitt. The Cardi
nal, riding on the momentum of
Nesbitt's goal, pushed the lead to
12-9 with goals from redshirt senior
midfielder Lauren Schmidt and
junior midfielder Anna Boeri.
Although its lead was relin
quished, the Crimson did not go
down easily, scoring six straight
goals to retake the lead. With 9:53
left, the Crimson had a 17-16 lead,
but the Cardinal once again found
the momentum and fought back.
Nesbitt scored her fourth goal of
the game with 6:53 left to tie the
game back up. For the fifth time in
the game, Flarvard and Stanford
were knotted up, and each team
had chances to score the go-ahead
goal.
Once again, Candelaria took it
upon herself to secure Stanford's
victory. As the final minutes dwin
dled, Candelaria drew a foul in the
eight-meter arc, giving her a free

position shot. With confidence,
Candelaria took the eight-meter,
looked the goalie in the eyes and
then buried a shot. Her free-posi
tion shot was her fourth goal of the
game and turned out to be the dif
ference.
Aside from Candelaria's aggres
sive attacking skills, senior goal
keeper Annie Read stepped up big
in the final minutes of the game,
denying the Crimson its last shot on
cage and securing the one-goal vic
tory for Cardinal. Read came up
with several strong saves consider
ing she was playing with an ear in
fection.
"Throughout the whole game,
many different people stepped up
and made an impact when we need
ed them too." said sophomore mid
fielder Carolyn Bradley.
After the win, Stanford will now
hit the road for the first time this
year. The Cardinal will open a five
game road trip with games against
Ohio State and Canisius in Colum
bus, Ohio on Saturday and Sunday.
