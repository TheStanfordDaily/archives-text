## Q&A panel features transgender-identified student panelists 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Transgender Awareness Week 2011
kicked off yesterday with a Q&A panel led
by transgender-identified Stanford stu
dents and "Trans 101," an informational
session featuring activist Jamison Green.
Several other talks and performances will
take place in the coming days.
Transgender Awareness Week seeks to
"raise awareness of transgender issues and
the idea that transgender issues are distinct
from what most people think of as gay is
sues," said Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, co-presi
dent of Stanford Students for Queer Liber
ation (SSQL).
This week's planned events include a
talk by Autumn Sandeen, a transgender
identified U.S. Navy veteran, on the repeal
of "don't ask, don't tell" this Friday. Discus
sions on transgender health and legal is
sues and a performance by local transgen
der-identified rapper Katastrophe are also
set to take place.
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-president of SSQL,
hopes the events will teach students about
"what transgender means and what kind of
identities are under the trans-umbrella."
She also hopes to "get students thinking
about the fluidity of gender and put faces
to the amorphous idea of'transgender.'"
Both Fetter and Vaid-Menon empha
sized the importance of appealing to dif
ferent segments of the Stanford communi
ty, from transgender-identified students to
students with no background on transgen
der issues.

ing sure that everyone understands
the importance of transgender is
sues and is confident being able to
identify as a trans-ally," Vaid-
Menon said.
However, awareness is not
Transgender Awareness Week's

only goal. The organizers hope to
catalyze change at the administra
tive level to make Stanford more
transgender friendly.
These changes might include en
abling transgender students to
change their names and reflecting
these changes on class rosters, at
Vaden or on University IDs.
"We want to make administra
tors, professors and staff more
aware of the unique needs of trans
identified students," Fetter said.
Yesterday's Q&A panelists,

who spoke about their experiences
as transgender Stanford students,
articulated these needs. The panel
featured Cristopher Bautista 'll,
Leanna Keyes 'l4 and doctoral stu
dent Charles Ledbetter.

Bautista, a Daily columnist,
spoke about his personal circum
stances.

"I had to e-mail professors [when
I first came out as transgender] say
ing my legal name is this, but my pre
ferred name is this, and I prefer male
pronouns," Bautista said. "It was
very stressful."

Bautista also talked about his
struggle to change his SUID card.
"It was ridiculous; I had to really
fight with them," he said. "They
eventually gave me a new ID, but it
was such an inconvenience that I
was on the verge of giving up."
The panelists also cited treatment
by fellow students as a challenge.
"One thing that I've noticed
both in the queer community and
the general community is that
there's a 'transgender bubble' both
physically and emotionally," Keyes
said. "It's disconcerting when
you're in a big lecture hall and there
are people who are more comfort
able sitting on the floor than being a

little crammed next to you."
Administrative figures attend
ing the session emphasized the im
portance of transgender issues.
"It was really heartwarming to
see the students feel so comfortable
being so open," said Kristina Lobo,
director of student development
and leadership programs at the
Haas Center. "I felt like the whole
thing made me feel closer to any
student who's in this [situation]."
The timing of Transgender
Awareness Week coincides with
the current debate on ROTC as
well as the recent release of a na
tional study on transgender dis
crimination. SSQL opposes
ROTC's return to campus due to
the military's exclusion of trans
gender individuals.
"Working on the ROTC cam
paign has shown us how unaware
people are of transgender issues,"
Fetter said.

Recent research on transgender
discrimination, published by the
National Center for Transgender
Equality and the National Gay and
Lesbian Taskforce, found that the
sample of transgender respondents
studied was "nearly four times
more likely to have a household in

come of less than $lO,OOO per year
compared to the general popula
tion." According to the study, "90
percent of those surveyed reported
experiencing harassment, mistreat
ment or discrimination" on the job.

"This is the first time we can ar
ticulate with statistics how disen
franchised transgender people are
and bring those issues to the fore
front of campus," Vaid-Menon said.
Despite the serious issues facing
the transgender community at
Stanford and at large. Fetter
stressed that the awareness week is
not about "the sadness or the
tragedy in transgender issues."
"This week is about celebrating
trans-identity," he said. "We're
hoping to give the community a
chance to celebrate the T in
LGBT."

by fellow students as a challenge.
"One thing that I've noticed
both in the queer community and
the general community is that
there's a 'transgender bubble' both
physically and emotionally," Keyes
said. "It's disconcerting when
you're in a big lecture hall and there
are people who are more comfort
able sitting on the floor than being a

little crammed next to you."
Administrative figures attend
ing the session emphasized the im
portance of transgender issues.
"It was really heartwarming to
see the students feel so comfortable
being so open," said Kristina Lobo,
director of student development
and leadership programs at the
Haas Center. "I felt like the whole
thing made me feel closer to any
student who's in this [situation]."
The timing of Transgender
Awareness Week coincides with
the current debate on ROTC as
well as the recent release of a na
tional study on transgender dis
crimination. SSQL opposes
ROTC's return to campus due to
the military's exclusion of trans
gender individuals.
"Working on the ROTC cam
paign has shown us how unaware
people are of transgender issues,"
Fetter said.

Recent research on transgender
discrimination, published by the
National Center for Transgender
Equality and the National Gay and
Lesbian Taskforce, found that the
sample of transgender respondents
studied was "nearly four times
more likely to have a household in

come of less than $lO,OOO per year
compared to the general popula
tion." According to the study, "90
percent of those surveyed reported
experiencing harassment, mistreat
ment or discrimination" on the job.

"This is the first time we can ar
ticulate with statistics how disen
franchised transgender people are
and bring those issues to the fore
front of campus," Vaid-Menon said.

the transgender community at
Stanford and at large. Fetter
stressed that the awareness week is
not about "the sadness or the
tragedy in transgender issues."
"This week is about celebrating
trans-identity," he said. "We're
hoping to give the community a
chance to celebrate the T in
LGBT."

Transgender Awareness Week 2011
kicked off yesterday with a Q&A panel led
by transgender-identified Stanford stu
dents and "Trans 101," an informational
session featuring activist Jamison Green.
Several other talks and performances will
take place in the coming days.
Transgender Awareness Week seeks to
"raise awareness of transgender issues and
the idea that transgender issues are distinct
from what most people think of as gay is
sues," said Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, co-presi
dent of Stanford Students for Queer Liber
ation (SSQL).
This week's planned events include a
talk by Autumn Sandeen, a transgender
identified U.S. Navy veteran, on the repeal
of "don't ask, don't tell" this Friday. Discus
sions on transgender health and legal is
sues and a performance by local transgen
der-identified rapper Katastrophe are also
set to take place.
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-president of SSQL,
hopes the events will teach students about
"what transgender means and what kind of
identities are under the trans-umbrella."
She also hopes to "get students thinking
about the fluidity of gender and put faces
to the amorphous idea of'transgender.'"
Both Fetter and Vaid-Menon empha
sized the importance of appealing to dif
ferent segments of the Stanford communi
ty, from transgender-identified students to
students with no background on transgen
der issues.

vating an ethos of inclusion ... mak
ing sure that everyone understands
the importance of transgender is
sues and is confident being able to
identify as a trans-ally," Vaid-
Menon said.
However, awareness is not
Transgender Awareness Week's

only goal. The organizers hope to
catalyze change at the administra
tive level to make Stanford more
transgender friendly.
These changes might include en
abling transgender students to
change their names and reflecting
these changes on class rosters, at
Vaden or on University IDs.
"We want to make administra
tors, professors and staff more
aware of the unique needs of trans
identified students," Fetter said.
Yesterday's Q&A panelists,

who spoke about their experiences
as transgender Stanford students,
articulated these needs. The panel
featured Cristopher Bautista 'll,
Leanna Keyes 'l4 and doctoral stu
dent Charles Ledbetter.

Bautista, a Daily columnist,
spoke about his personal circum
stances.

"I had to e-mail professors [when
I first came out as transgender] say
ing my legal name is this, but my pre
ferred name is this, and I prefer male
pronouns," Bautista said. "It was
very stressful."

Bautista also talked about his
struggle to change his SUID card.
"It was ridiculous; I had to really
fight with them," he said. "They
eventually gave me a new ID, but it
was such an inconvenience that I
was on the verge of giving up."
The panelists also cited treatment
by fellow students as a challenge.
"One thing that I've noticed
both in the queer community and
the general community is that
there's a 'transgender bubble' both

said. "It's disconcerting when
