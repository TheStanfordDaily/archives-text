# Softball wins four of five in Stanford Nike Invitational
## 
### â€“ Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford Softball team
dropped its first game of the week
end before winning its last four to
run its record to 12-3.
First up on Friday was Memphis,
which snuck by the No. 16 Cardinal,
2-1, thanks to superb pitching from
Carly Hummel, who outdueled
Stanford sophomore pitcher Tea
gan Gerhart. The Cardinal man
aged only six hits and only one
for extra bases against Hummel.
Stanford bounced back later
that night with a thorough pound
ing of North Dakota State to get
back on the winning trail. The Car
dinal run-ruled the Bison after scor
ing 12 in just four innings, while sen
ior pitcher Ashley Chinn shut out
NDSU, allowing only two hits in
five innings. Junior shortstop Ash
ley Hansen and freshman third
baseman Michelle Prong each
homered for Stanford, and the two
combined for seven RBI.

On Saturday, the Cardinal con
tinued its success with two more
victories. In the first game of the

day, Stanford edged by its only
ranked opponent of the weekend,
No. 24 Kentucky, 4-2. All six runs
were scored in the first three in
nings, and it was up to Stanford's
pitching staff to keep the Wildcats
off the board after that. Gerhart got
the start for the Cardinal, but she
lasted only two-plus innings before
Chinn took over. Chinn pitched five
innings and allowed only one un
earned run to pick up her second
victory in as many days.
Following up the hard-fought
win, Stanford had another cake
walk as it destroyed Colorado
State, 16-2, in five innings. The Car
dinal had more runs than outs on
offense, and five players had multi
ple RBI. Gerhart took the easy vic
tory by allowing two runs in five in
nings, and she also scored two runs
of her own as part of the offensive
onslaught.
In the final game of the week
end, Stanford held off UC-Davis, 5-
3, to finish the invitational strong.
Gerhart pitched four solid innings,
allowing only one run on three hits,
and she left holding a 2-1 lead. The
Cardinal tacked on three more runs
in the next two innings, and Chinn
minimized the damage in the sev
enth to notch her first save of the
season. Hansen and junior catcher

Maya Burns each knocked in a pair
of runs for Stanford, which finished
its first homestand of the year with
a 4-1 record.
The Cardinal will travel to Fuller
ton, Calif., next weekend to compete
in the DeMarini Invitational.
