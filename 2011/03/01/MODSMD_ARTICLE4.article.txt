# U.S. Supreme Court hears Stanford v. Roche patent case
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
The U.S. Supreme Court heard
oral arguments yesterday for the
biotech patent case Board of
Trustees of Stanford University v.
Roche Molecular Systems.
The question presented to the
Court is whether a university re
searcher, without the university's
consent, can assign the patent rights
for federally funded inventions.
These inventions are nearly always
assigned to universities by law.
The case stemmed from a dispute
between Stanford and the biotech
company over the right to royalties
on several patents that sprung from
the work of School of Medicine pro
fessor Mark Holodniy. Holodniy's
research, which established a
method to detect HIV, is now used in
HIV test kits sold by Roche.
The crux of the conflict is an
agreement signed by Holodniy
when he went to work at Cetus, an
early biotech firm where a "poly
merase chain reaction" (PCR) tech
nology was developed. PCR is a crit
ical component of Holodniy's HIV
detection method, and the agree
ment stated that future develop
ments based on Cetus technology
would be its intellectual property.
Donald Ayer, representing Stan
ford University, opened yesterday's
hour-long oral argument.
"The inventor, because he is
working here [at Cetus] at the time
of the assignment on a federally
funded project as an employee of
Stanford University, is essentially
working on something covered by
Bayh-Dole," Ayer said. "And being

covered by Bayh-Dole means that
he lacks the power to transfer title to
this future invention to someone
else, because the statute has already
spoken for it."
Chief Justice John Roberts shot
back that Ayer cloaked himself in
the interests of the United States.
It "has long been the rule that in
ventors have title to their patents
initially, even if they make those in
ventions while working for some
body else," Roberts said.
Several justices focused on the
fine difference between "I will as
sign" and "I hereby do assign" claus
es in the Stanford contract and
Cetus agreement, respectively.
The Supreme Court did not indi
cate how it might rule on the case,
though some justices did oppose a
more expansive reading of the Bayh-
Dole Act, which Stanford favors.
The Court is expected to make a
ruling by July.
