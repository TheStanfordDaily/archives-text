# U.S. Supreme Court hears Stanford v. Roche patent case
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
The U.S. Supreme Court heard
oral arguments yesterday for the
biotech patent case Board of
Trustees of Stanford University v.
Roche Molecular Systems.
The question presented to the
Court is whether a university re
searcher, without the university's
consent, can assign the patent rights
for federally funded inventions.
These inventions are nearly always
assigned to universities by law.
The case stemmed from a dispute
between Stanford and the biotech
company over the right to royalties
on several patents that sprung from
the work of School of Medicine pro
fessor Mark Holodniy. Holodniy's
research, which established a
method to detect HIV, is now used in
HIV test kits sold by Roche.
