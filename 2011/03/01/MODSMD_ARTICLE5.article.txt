# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Student groups petition for special fees 
### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
Various student groups have begun the peti
tioning process to get special fees requests on this
year's ballot, the largest of which topped
$185,000. University budget cuts forced many
groups to dig into their reserve funds this year in
order to meet operating costs that were previous
ly covered by special fees.
Thus far, some of the major increases have
come from three groups: club sports requested a
22-percent increase, KZSU petitioned for a 25-

percent increase and Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) asked for a 257-percent increase.
Last year, the club sports budget was reduced
to $152,320 after it petitioned for $204,850. The
group is requesting a budget of $185,622.40 for
the 2011-12 academic year.
Graduate student Kate Johnson, the club
sports financial officer, said the group dipped
into its reserve account to meet its financial
needs for the 2010-11 academic year.
"We did have a pretty sizable reserve account,
and we drew on that pretty heavily," Johnson
said. "But now we don't have much in the way of

reserves."
The group's biggest expenses are coaching
fees, facilities rentals, travel expenses, registra
tion fees and equipment, Johnson said.
She added that clubs sports are "a great re
source for the graduate students on this campus,"
noting that many involved with club sports were
varsity athletes in college,
Johnson said the group still needed about 600
more signatures, particularly from graduate stu
dents.
KZSU last year requested a
budget of $80,699 but received
$65,269. This year, the group is re
questing $81,338.
"We don't think of it so much as
an increase as a negation of a de
crease," said Alan Joyce, one of
KZSU's general managers. "At this
point, we really need to get back to
what we consider our standard
budget."
"This year, we already depleted
through our reserves, and we really
feel like we can't continue to oper
ate at the current budget level," he
added.
KZSU made major equipment
purchases over the last two years,
buying a new transmitter and re
placing a console that had been in
the studio since the 1980s. The group
currently spends more on travel in
order to cover away games for eight
sports.
Joyce was "cautiously optimistic"
that KZSU's petition would suc
ceed.
"The response has been pretty
positive to our petition," Joyce said.
"I think we're on track to succeed."
Alterative Spring Break (ASB),
which runs 15 to 17 trips over spring
break, is requesting a budget of
$80,358.25. The group received
$22,524 last year after petitioning
for $79,858.
"Last year's expenditures came
to about $67,000," said Shaan
Chugh, a member of the ASB team

in charge of finance.
Although ASB's expenditures
last year totaled $67,000, the group is
petitioning for $80,358.25. A
planned increase in ASB trips, from
17 to 19, accounts for the increase,
Chugh said.
"In previous years. Alternative
Spring Break has been very popular
with the students," he said.
The largest share of ASB's budg
et is travel costs for its 17 trips, each
of which includes roughly 14 stu
dents.
The Stanford Daily, which has re
ceived special fees in the past, is re
questing $89,500 in special fees to
cover half the paper's printing costs,
the same amount requested last
year.
Requests for other groups can be
found at petitions.stanford.edu.
Special fees petitioning ends on
Mar. 4 at 4 p.m. The results will be
posted to the ASSU Elections Com
mission website on Mar. 8 at 4 p.m.
