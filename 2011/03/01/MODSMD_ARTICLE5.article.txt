# STUDENT GOVERNMENT
## Student groups petition for special fees 
### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
Various student groups have begun the peti
tioning process to get special fees requests on this
year's ballot, the largest of which topped
$185,000. University budget cuts forced many
groups to dig into their reserve funds this year in
order to meet operating costs that were previous
ly covered by special fees.
Thus far, some of the major increases have
come from three groups: club sports requested a
22-percent increase, KZSU petitioned for a 25-

percent increase and Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) asked for a 257-percent increase.
Last year, the club sports budget was reduced
to $152,320 after it petitioned for $204,850. The
group is requesting a budget of $185,622.40 for
the 2011-12 academic year.
Graduate student Kate Johnson, the club
sports financial officer, said the group dipped
into its reserve account to meet its financial
needs for the 2010-11 academic year.
"We did have a pretty sizable reserve account,
and we drew on that pretty heavily," Johnson
said. "But now we don't have much in the way of

reserves."
The group's biggest expenses are coaching
fees, facilities rentals, travel expenses, registra
tion fees and equipment, Johnson said.
She added that clubs sports are "a great re
source for the graduate students on this campus,"
noting that many involved with club sports were
varsity athletes in college,
Johnson said the group still needed about 600
more signatures, particularly from graduate stu
dents.
