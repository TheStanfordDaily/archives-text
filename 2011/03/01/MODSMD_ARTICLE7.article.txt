## Facebook set to leave Stanford Reserach Park Social networking giant will move to Menlo Park 
### RYAN MAYFIELD STAFF WRITER 
Facebook will move its head
quarters from Stanford Research
Park to the former Sun Microsys
tems campus in Menlo Park by
2013. New housing units will soon
take over the social media giant's
current space.
The current Facebook head
quarters is located at 1601 Califor
nia Avenue in Palo Alto.
Since establishing its headquarters
there in 2009, Facebook has known
it would need to move again by
2013. In an agreement negotiated
in 2005 between Stanford and the
city of Palo Alto, the University
agreed to transform Facebook's
portion of the research park into
housing units, according to Tiffany
Griego, director of asset manage
ment at Stanford Research Park.
Because of this agreement,
Facebook's lease will only last for
two more years. The company, in
fact, has been preparing for its
move to a new site for some time.
With a 15-year lease and a provi
sion to purchase the land after five

years, the new Menlo Park head
quarters has approximately
1,000,000 square feet of office
space. This will provide enough
room to house more than one and
a half times Facebook's global
staff, which currently exceeds
2,000 employees.
"They have been strategizing
their relocation for some time in
order to ensure their new campus
could accommodate their aggres
sive growth projections," Griego
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"The Menlo Park campus is of sig
nificant size, and unfortunately, we
didn't have a campus of this size in
the research park to lease to Face
book."
Although the networking
giant's staff has not begun the tran
sition yet, the first wave should
begin moving to Menlo Park at the
beginning of summer. Facebook
projects that renovations will be
completed then. It plans to main
tain its offices in Palo Alto until
2013, when the transition will be
fully completed.
In addition to leasing the 57-
acre Sun Microsystems campus,
Facebook has also purchased 22
acres of land across the street from
