## REACTING TO CALDERÓN Students, administrators, Bay Area activists divided over selection of Mexican president as 2011 Commencement speaker 
### BILLY GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The 31st president of the United States,
Supreme Court justices, a secretary of state,
the governor of New York, the speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. sen
ators, the editor of The New York Times and
two secretary-generals of the United Nations have all,
at one point, stood at the same podium.
It has become an increasingly prestigious honor to
address the graduating class of Stanford University at
commencement every June. In the past decade alone,
Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan,

Condoleezza Rice, Sandra
Day O'Connor, Steve Jobs,
Tom Brokaw, Oprah Winfrey
and Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court Anthony
Kennedy have delivered com
mencement speeches to grad
uating classes.
On Jan. 14, the senior class
presidents announced that
Felipe Calderon, the incum
bent president of Mexico,
would join the group of nota
bles as Stanford's 2011 Com
mencement speaker.
The selection, per usual,
has not come without contro
versy. While many seniors are
appreciative of the opportu
nity to hear words of wisdom
from such a prominent politi
cal figure, others object to
Calderon's invitation based
on how he has conducted pol
icy in his country, particularly

his deployment of troops to drug-trafficking regions in
Mexico.
In her article "Mexican President's Visit to Stanford
Meets with Objection" published on Feb. 9, 2011, by
The Bay Citizen, journalist Elena Shore described how
Calderon's selection has prompted a reaction from
within the Bay Area.
According to Shore, an editorial written by Maria
Mejfa published by El Mensajero, a Bay Area Spanish
language newspaper, described Stanford's selection as
the "wrong choice." Mejfa wrote that the purpose of a
commencement is to inspire students, and that if she
were a student, she wouldn't feel inspired by Calderon.
"I don't admire his war against drug trafficking,"
Mejfa said. "Maybe his motives are legitimate and his
intentions are good. But the reality is that it has left a
terrible trail of dead bodies. I can't believe that more
than 30,000 dead during his administration due to vio
lence stemming from narcotrafficking is something
that could inspire me."
According to Shore, Miguel Robles, director of the
Latin American Alliance for the Rights of Immigrants
(ALIADI) told El Mensajero that the Stanford com
munity as well as other California universities should
protest a speaker who has "generated so much social
disorder, so much death."
It is estimated that the war on drugs is responsible

for the deaths of more than 34,000 people since 2006 as
well as 15,000 people in 2010 alone, according to Shore,
citing El Mensajero.
Every year, the four senior class presidents make a
recommendation to President Hennessy for the Com
mencement speaker on behalf of the senior class. This
year's presidents Dante DiCicco, Mona Hadidi, Molly
Spaeth and Pamon Forouhor chose to poll the senior
class, asking them to suggest candidates, Spaeth said.
The class presidents typically submit an unranked
list of three to five candidates to President Hennessy,
who selects the speaker after discussions with the sen
ior class presidents, faculty, other administrators and
trustees, according to Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to

lilt pitMUClll aIILI s>Ctltlcliy
of the Board of Trustees.
The feasibility of getting a
potential candidate to ac
cept an invitation is a major
consideration.
"Believe it or not, even
though it's Stanford, it's not
the kind of thing people do
readily," Wachtel said. "Peo
ple aren't lining up to be
Commencement speakers
because they get so many
invitations to do this."
In addition to being select
ed based on one's speaking
abilities, candidates are also
considered based on their
connection to the Universi
ty. One factor in selecting
Calderon, Wachtel said, is
the fact that he is a family
friend of a member of the
class of 2011.

"The senior class presi
dents were particularly excited about Calderon being
the speaker," Wachtel said. "That was very persuasive
for us."
DiCicco said that the senior class presidents viewed
Calderon's selection as a timely one.
"Right now, we believe, is a very significant time in
relations between the U.S. and Mexico, particularly
California and Mexico," DiCicco said. "We feel that
Calderon, drawing from his experiences in public poli
cy, can give a very powerful speech to us as an outgoing
world leader to future world leaders."
Many student reactions were positive toward, or
at least curious about, the selection. Cristal Garcia
'll, a student administrative assistant for the Stan
ford Center for Latin American Studies, wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily that Calderon's high profile and
high-pressure position will make for a more interest
ing speech.
"To take on such an influential role [requires] more
than just books," Garcia said. "And ... someone who
faces these kinds of challenges is [someone] I would
like to listen to."
Wachtel noted that some opposition to Calderon's
invitation is not unexpected.
"There's always some negative reaction to every

speaker we select," Wachtel said.
"The amount of reaction varies.
Even someone as popular as
Oprah had some negative reac
tion."
Wachtel said the biggest prob
lem the University has had with a
Commencement speaker during
the past decade has not been the
result of direct objection to the
speaker himself, citing the invita
tion of the president of Peru, Ale
jandro Toledo, to speak at Stan
ford's 2003 commencement as an
example.
Toledo, who holds three degrees
from Stanford, had an all-time low
approval rating at the time, and was
in a battle with the Peruvian Con
gress. When the Peruvian congress
told him he would be unable to use
the presidential plane to fly to Palo
Alto, Toledo insisted he would
make it to Stanford even if he had
to fly commercially and ultimately
made it to campus for the speech,
Wachtel said.
In 2000, then-U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan was selected
as the Commencement speaker.

Some students protested to draw
public attention to global causes
and crises, but not specifically to
protest Annan's selection.
"People are welcome to protest
and express their opinion," Wach
tel said. However, "we would not
allow his [Annan's] speech to be in
terrupted ... we just want to be re
spectful."
Hadidi noted that Calderon will
try to relate to the graduating class
regardless of its politics.
"At the end of the day, he's not
coming here to give us a policy
speech," Hadidi said. "He's here to
give us a Commencement speech,
and therefore we're hoping he will
provide inspiration to our class."
"It's an incredible honor to have
a current, sitting foreign head of
state come and speak to our class,"
DiCicco said, noting that the fact
that Calderon is a family friend of a
senior "adds another layer of depth
to the Commencement speech.
Calderon is expected to be on
campus from June 10 to 12.
"We're very excited," Forouhor
said. "I don't think we could be
happier with our selection at this
point. We're really looking forward
to it."

the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. sen
ators, the editor of The New York Times and
two secretary-generals of the United Nations have all,
at one point, stood at the same podium.
It has become an increasingly prestigious honor to
address the graduating class of Stanford University at
commencement every June. In the past decade alone,
Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan,

Condoleezza Rice, Sandra
Day O'Connor, Steve Jobs,
Tom Brokaw, Oprah Winfrey
and Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court Anthony
Kennedy have delivered com
mencement speeches to grad
uating classes.
On Jan. 14, the senior class
presidents announced that
Felipe Calderon, the incum
bent president of Mexico,
would join the group of nota
bles as Stanford's 2011 Com
mencement speaker.
The selection, per usual,
has not come without contro
versy. While many seniors are
appreciative of the opportu
nity to hear words of wisdom
from such a prominent politi
cal figure, others object to
Calderon's invitation based
on how he has conducted pol
icy in his country, particularly

his deployment of troops to drug-trafficking regions in
Mexico.
In her article "Mexican President's Visit to Stanford
Meets with Objection" published on Feb. 9, 2011, by
The Bay Citizen, journalist Elena Shore described how
Calderon's selection has prompted a reaction from
within the Bay Area.
According to Shore, an editorial written by Maria
Mejfa published by El Mensajero, a Bay Area Spanish
language newspaper, described Stanford's selection as
the "wrong choice." Mejfa wrote that the purpose of a
commencement is to inspire students, and that if she
were a student, she wouldn't feel inspired by Calderon.
"I don't admire his war against drug trafficking,"
Mejfa said. "Maybe his motives are legitimate and his
intentions are good. But the reality is that it has left a
terrible trail of dead bodies. I can't believe that more
than 30,000 dead during his administration due to vio
lence stemming from narcotrafficking is something
that could inspire me."
According to Shore, Miguel Robles, director of the
Latin American Alliance for the Rights of Immigrants
(ALIADI) told El Mensajero that the Stanford com
munity as well as other California universities should
protest a speaker who has "generated so much social
disorder, so much death."
It is estimated that the war on drugs is responsible

for the deaths of more than 34,000 people since 2006 as
well as 15,000 people in 2010 alone, according to Shore,
citing El Mensajero.
Every year, the four senior class presidents make a
recommendation to President Hennessy for the Com
mencement speaker on behalf of the senior class. This
year's presidents Dante DiCicco, Mona Hadidi, Molly
Spaeth and Pamon Forouhor chose to poll the senior
class, asking them to suggest candidates, Spaeth said.
The class presidents typically submit an unranked
list of three to five candidates to President Hennessy,
who selects the speaker after discussions with the sen
ior class presidents, faculty, other administrators and
trustees, according to Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to

lilt pitMUClll aIILI s>Ctltlcliy
of the Board of Trustees.
The feasibility of getting a
potential candidate to ac
cept an invitation is a major
consideration.
"Believe it or not, even
though it's Stanford, it's not
the kind of thing people do
readily," Wachtel said. "Peo
ple aren't lining up to be
Commencement speakers
because they get so many
invitations to do this."
In addition to being select
ed based on one's speaking
abilities, candidates are also
considered based on their
connection to the Universi
ty. One factor in selecting
Calderon, Wachtel said, is
the fact that he is a family
friend of a member of the
class of 2011.

"The senior class presi
dents were particularly excited about Calderon being
the speaker," Wachtel said. "That was very persuasive
for us."
DiCicco said that the senior class presidents viewed
Calderon's selection as a timely one.
"Right now, we believe, is a very significant time in
relations between the U.S. and Mexico, particularly
California and Mexico," DiCicco said. "We feel that
Calderon, drawing from his experiences in public poli
cy, can give a very powerful speech to us as an outgoing
world leader to future world leaders."
Many student reactions were positive toward, or
at least curious about, the selection. Cristal Garcia
'll, a student administrative assistant for the Stan
ford Center for Latin American Studies, wrote in an
e-mail to The Daily that Calderon's high profile and
high-pressure position will make for a more interest
ing speech.
"To take on such an influential role [requires] more
than just books," Garcia said. "And ... someone who
faces these kinds of challenges is [someone] I would
like to listen to."
Wachtel noted that some opposition to Calderon's
invitation is not unexpected.
"There's always some negative reaction to every

speaker we select," Wachtel said.
"The amount of reaction varies.
Even someone as popular as
Oprah had some negative reac
tion."
Wachtel said the biggest prob
lem the University has had with a
Commencement speaker during
the past decade has not been the
result of direct objection to the
speaker himself, citing the invita
tion of the president of Peru, Ale
jandro Toledo, to speak at Stan
ford's 2003 commencement as an
example.
Toledo, who holds three degrees
from Stanford, had an all-time low
approval rating at the time, and was
in a battle with the Peruvian Con
gress. When the Peruvian congress
told him he would be unable to use
the presidential plane to fly to Palo
Alto, Toledo insisted he would
make it to Stanford even if he had
to fly commercially and ultimately
made it to campus for the speech,
Wachtel said.
In 2000, then-U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan was selected
as the Commencement speaker.

Some students protested to draw
public attention to global causes
and crises, but not specifically to
protest Annan's selection.
"People are welcome to protest
and express their opinion," Wach
tel said. However, "we would not
allow his [Annan's] speech to be in
terrupted ... we just want to be re
spectful."
Hadidi noted that Calderon will
try to relate to the graduating class
regardless of its politics.
"At the end of the day, he's not
coming here to give us a policy
speech," Hadidi said. "He's here to
give us a Commencement speech,
and therefore we're hoping he will
provide inspiration to our class."
"It's an incredible honor to have
a current, sitting foreign head of
state come and speak to our class,"
DiCicco said, noting that the fact
that Calderon is a family friend of a
senior "adds another layer of depth
to the Commencement speech.
Calderon is expected to be on
campus from June 10 to 12.
"We're very excited," Forouhor
said. "I don't think we could be
happier with our selection at this
point. We're really looking forward
to it."
