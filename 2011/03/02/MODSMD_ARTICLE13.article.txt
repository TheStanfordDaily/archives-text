You might call it serendipity in the law library.
Maggie Filler, LAW 'l2, was studying in
Stanford's Law Library and thinking about
the California prison system when she came
across a student study area that was "over
flowing with books about prisons." Someone else was
studying the same thing. The nametag on the pile of
books read Sara Mayeux, a joint JD-American History
PhD candidate.
"I thought, 'Who is that Sara?'" Filler recalled with
amusement. "We have to get together."
Filler had coffee with Mayeux and found that they

both agreed about several controversial prison issues.
Many conversations later, the idea for the Stanford Prison
Forum was born.
The Stanford Prison Forum is an interdisciplinary stu
dent-run workshop supported by a Student Projects for
Intellectual Community Enhancement grant. Filler and
Mayeux hoped the workshop would provide a place for
students interested in issues of incarceration to study the
topic in more depth.
"We felt that although we had some classes at the
Law School, the regular coursework failed to capture
the systemic portion of prisons," Filler said. "For exam
ple, how [they] operate, not just through legal pass-ways,
but in terms of the various other systems... that create
this massive system in the United States today, in Cali
fornia especially."
The forum has been running a seminar at San Quentin
prison since the beginning of the quarter. Every Sunday
from 2 to 5 p.m., 10 Stanford students make the trek to the
San Quentin prison to take a class together with 20 in
mates who have earned associate degrees under the
Prison University Project, a program that provides free
higher education to inmates at San Quentin.
Eight graduate students and two undergraduates
are in the seminar as both teachers and learners. They
take turns leading discussions and listening to their
peers. Topics are mainly focused on getting a better feel
of the prison system, but also include sessions on family
laws and parole policies to immigration and Franz
Kafka's writing.
Students said the classroom in the prison is very sim
ilar to what they experienced at Stanford. However, op
erating within a prison system brings a unique set of dif
ficulties.
Students were required to go through a security clear
ance months before the class started. Recently, one class
was cut short because the inmates had to go back for a
head count. At another class, only one inmate showed up
because of a prison fight.

That one-on-one interaction with inmates was an eye
opening one for the Stanford students. At one class ses
sion, four Stanford students sat down with one San
Quentin prisoner and listened to him share how his expe
rience with severe violence and racism at a very young age
directly affected his life.
"It was really the only time in my life that I would
have that opportunity to sit down and really say
'tell me your story'," Filler said. "I feel it
was one teacher and four students. He
gave us a huge lesson that day and it
was just invaluable."
Filler felt the class provided her
with a knowledge base that she *
could not get by reading casebooks.

A particularly meaningful course for her was one about
parole policies, where she learned about what was hap
pening "in terms of what the parole boards should consid
er as opposed to [what] they do consider."
Eugenia Maluf'lf, one of the two undergraduates in
the forum, joined because of her interest in teaching.
"I wanted to be a teacher," she said. "So something
that I can take away is that all the stories I heard from
people in the class come down to their inability to access
education when they were younger, and that has active
ly contributed to where they are now."
Filler said that she hoped that the San Quentin par
ticipants realized through the program that people out
side the system still care about them. She noted that in
mates were deeply concerned with the absence of their
voice and she wanted them "to come away with the
sense that there are people who take their thoughts
and ideas seriously."
Mayeux emphasized the importance of inmate's
ability to make their opinions about their circumstances
known.
"I think especially with prisons it's so important
because they are literally locked up in cages," she
said, adding that the outside world might not have
any conception of how the inmates are actually
being treated.
Both Filler and Mayeux plan to continue leading the
forum, recruiting a new group of students who can offer a
different perspective. They also plan to publish writings
about life experiences from both Stanford and San
Quentin students as away of expanding the classroom's
dialogue outside the prison.
Maluf commented that engaging in an "honest dia
logue" with the inmates enables one to relate to them as
human beings.
"When you think about that, it really changes how you
[deal] with the criminal system," she said.
