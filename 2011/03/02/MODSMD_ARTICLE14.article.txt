## EDITORIAL In a collaborative world, are exams becoming a relic? 
### 
In a world where collaborative
processes drive the most suc
cessful enterprises, most Stan
ford professors still test the knowl
edge, skills and abilities of their stu
dents by the same archaic methods
used for centuries. This editorial
board believes that the time has
come for a reinvention of the way
in which we assess student per
formance, starting with exams.
In January of 2010, Provost John
Etchemendy and then-Vice
Provost John Bravman appointed
the Study of Undergraduate Edu
cation at Stanford (SUES) to
reevaluate the University's ap
proach to undergraduate educa
tion. The last major study, in 1994,
yielded fundamental reforms:
freshman seminars, increased op
portunities for undergraduate re
search and revisions to undergrad
uate writing and IHUM programs.
In their charge to the committee
this time around, Etchemendy and
Bravman wrote, "[the] growing so
cial, political, economic, and eco
logical interconnectedness of the
world certainly challenges us to
look more broadly at what it means
to be an educated citizen."They ask
the committee to investigate how
such global changes, over the past
15 years, have affected what stu
dents need from their undergradu
ate education and, accordingly,
how Stanford should adjust the
way it educates. Within SUES, the
Subcommittee on Student Learn
ing is asked to address the question
of how to encourage exploration
and sustained reflection among
Stanford students. In order to best
answer this question, SUES should
scrutinize the closed-book exam as
a means of testing student pre
paredness for an increasingly con
nected and collaborative world.
In today's global economy, the
lone worker is increasingly a relic
of the past. Programmers rely on
the Internet to find example code,
companies crowd-source ideas and
peers are always available for con

sultation via phone or e-mail. In an
interview with Harvard Business
Review, Cisco CEO John Cham
bers argued that a new emphasis on
collaboration and teamwork has
allowed his company to innovate at
an unprecedented pace. SUES has
the goal of preparing undergradu
ates for "local, national and global
citizenship." Given this charge, is
the same method of testing a stu
dent in isolation an accurate meas
ure of what is needed to compete in
the workforce?
Furthermore, it is easy to see
that low-value problem sets and
high-value exams motivate stu
dents to relax throughout the quar
ter and place immense pressure on
themselves to cram during the last
days of school. If Stanford's goal is
to promote gradual exploration of
material, rather than the simple
ability to commit knowledge to
short-term memory, then it should
task SUES to thoroughly investi
gate whether the current emphasis
of most classes on exams is appro
priate.
Consider a typical student en
rolled in the Physics 20 series. If she
spends 5-10 hours per week on
problem sets, then by the end of the
quarter she will have spent 75
hours per quarter on work that is
worth 18 to 20 percent of her final
grade. To spend a proportional
amount of time on a final exam
worth 40 percent, that same stu
dent would have to spend 10 hours
a day for more than two weeks
150 hours studying for a single
exam. Since this is impossible,
exams are worth a disproportion
ately large amount.
One obvious counter-argument
is that time spent on problem sets
can be double-counted as time
studying for finals, and students'
performance on the final exam
should reflect the effort invested in
problem sets. Yet, even with this
generous assumption, professors
