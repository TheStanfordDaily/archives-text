# OP-ED
## Silently Catholic, Pro-Life and a Stanford Outcast 
### COURTNEY CRISP '11 
I have never tried to convert any
one in my life. I am one of the
most open-minded people you
will ever meet. I rarely even tell
people that I'm Catholic.
But I have felt isolated for being
Catholic and pro-life since the first
week I came to Stanford. I vividly
remember my first few days here,
how I had gone to MemChu a few
times because I was a little lost and
lonely. The news of where I had
gone on my walk was met with odd
glances and uncomfortable silences.
Later that night in the Lag dining
hall, some kid made the mistake of
revealing that he had signed up on
the pro-life e-mail list. And at least
10 people went at him for being so
conservative, so close-minded.
I learned quickly that I was in the
minority, to keep my mouth shut
about a lot of my views unless I
wanted to be verbally attacked. So I
stayed silent.
It is at times like the Roe v. Wade
memorial when I feel the deepest
sense of isolation. I am not fiery
enough to stand out there on the
White Plaza grass on the pro-life
side, I don't like creating conflict or
focusing on doctrine when it comes
to religion; that's just not what it
means to me. For me, religion was
always more about love and bring
ing people together than it was
about driving them apart.
Three weeks ago, I sat on a ce
ment block in front of the post of

fice watching those Roe v. Wade
protests for hours. I was angry for a
variety of reasons. At myself for
being too weak to put myself out
there. For the flak that the pro-life
people get every year campus-wide
for what they believe in. At myself
for being so upset.
But anger is a second-degree
emotion, so as it cooled, I paid at
tention to the emotions that came
next. And what I found underneath
that anger was an intense hurt. I was
hurt that people felt like it was okay
to attack a background I loved and
am proud of when I never do that to
anyone else. I was sick of feeling at
tacked and lonely, of feeling like no
one understood where I came from
and thus can't fully understand who
I am now.
Although this feeling isn't new,
it's one I've only recently identified.
One my good friends, Yvorn "Doc"
Thomas unknowingly identified the
causes of it best when he spoke re
cently at a Black House program.
He talked about living in Ujamaa
and his need to be a part of the Stan
ford black community. He said that
in high school, there was no BSU
because the entire school was the
BSU. He never felt hyper-aware of
being black until he stepped onto
the Stanford campus.
I stayed silent in the back row,
thinking that without realizing it, he
perfectly summed up my Stanford
struggles. Back at home, there was
no Catholic community because
everyone was the Catholic commu
nity. Coming to Stanford, I was in
the minority. And I didn't really
know how to handle it.
I ended up choosing to exist in

two worlds. In one world, I had
wonderful friends and sorority sis
ters who weren't Catholic and did
n't really understand how key it was
in my life, while in the other, I went
to church every Sunday by myself.
In one world, I was an incredibly ac
tive Stanford student; in the other, I
felt lonely and misunderstood.
It's been an okay system for
three years. But then at times like
this, when I am sitting on a cold ce
ment block, wanting to cry and not
entirely sure why, who do I have to

talk about it with? When I am in the
history building and a professor
cracks a joke about Catholic sexual
frustration, I don't know what to do.
I am scared of revealing my other
isolated world when I feel like no
one will support me in doing so.
I write this not to complain, but
to share my story in hopes that it
might reach someone feeling like I
do, even if a different reason is the
cause. Be blessed.
