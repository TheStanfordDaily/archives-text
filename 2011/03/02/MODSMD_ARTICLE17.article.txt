# I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY PROFOUND

Two weeks before Christmas,
Bill O'Reilly called Wik
ileaks "a threat to our way of
life." And I thought,"So what?" Our
way of life is a threat to us. We've
got record rates of obesity, two wars,
an energy crisis, nationwide neuro
sis, blah blah blah. Mr. O'Reilly, I
think a threat to "our way of life" is
exactly what we need.
And maybe that's exactly what
we're getting. I feel like there's
something big going on. Maybe
you've felt it too something lead
erless and nameless, but really im
portant. The media's all lit up, talk
ing about change in the Middle
East, in education, in the environ
ment, in technology, in democracy,
in mental health. We're coming up
on a new presidential campaign,
which will be followed, according to
the Mayans, by the end of the whole
freaking world. It's like we're build
ing up to some breaking point, and a
big shift in how we think about our
relationships with ourselves and
with each other.
I think we're seeing a movement.
That sounds right: an awakening of
a large number of individuals to a
new common consciousness.
It was 2008 when I first started
noticing. Remember how the buzz
words of the year were "hope" and
"change"? The nation was so taken
with the idea of one man finally dar
ing to think differently. I remember
seeing the words "McCain con
cedes" on the TVs in the CoHo and
hearing the roars and cheers of a
bunch of strangers packed in there

together, all hugging and high-fiv
ing. It was like some people really
thought we'd never have problems
again: I'd never seen anyone actual
ly dancing in the streets until that
night. And there were all those old
school Berkeleyans saying so heart
breakingly that it was the first time

they'd actually "felt proud to be
Americans."
We had a movement a nation
of troubled people coming together
all on their own to say they wanted
the world to change.
But I think where we went
wrong is we believed we could take
the easy path toward change by
looking for a hero. That's my beef
with representative democracies:
they require heroes, which I consid
er to be people who bear the suffer
ing of changing other peoples' lives.
I don't think a nation can change
without each of the people in it
sharing some of the suffering. Un
fortunately, we've got a big pain in
tolerance. "We want lower taxes, but
we don't want to give up what keeps
them high. We want bipartisan poli
tics, but it's so much easier to just
hope some elected schmuck will do
all the reaching-across-party
boundaries for us, than to actually
go talk to someone different our
selves. We want healthy children,
but we keep them out of the sun and
away from the dirt, so they become
anemic and asthmatic.
The first noble truth is "life is suf
fering," which I used to think was
really dumb: what, am I supposed to
be unhappy all the time? But no, it
makes sense. See, life is a series of
growth and learning, and growth
and learning only happen through
suffering. Muscles strengthen by ex
periencing trauma and growing
scars in response. Learning is the

I think where we
went wrong is we
believed we could
take the easy path
toward change by
looking for a hero
