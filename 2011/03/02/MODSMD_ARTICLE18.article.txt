# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
Keith Sudheimer's recent Op-
Ed regarding the potential return of
ROTC to the Stanford campus
("Darth Vader Says 'Yes' To the
ROTC") illustrates an ideologically
extreme and unproductive under
standing of military service. Sud
heimer argues that since soldiers in
the field are obliged to follow or
ders regardless of their moral posi
tions, military service is antithetical
to the intellectual goals of the uni
versity. In so doing he misunder
stands the nature of the ROTC pro
gram and disregards the structure
of government through which mili

tary decisions are made.
Though obvious, it bears empha
sis that ROTC is not compulsory
military service. ROTC programs
give students the option to take part
in coursework and training leading
to a commission as a military officer
upon graduation. Official sanction
of ROTC in no way constitutes ap
proval of military actions or doc
trine. Further, the strictures of mili
tary service relate not to privately
held morals, but to behavior. The
military is not the Thought Police,
eradicating heterodoxy among its
members. Rather, it expects actions
consistent with the interests of the

United States.
These interests may lead to or
ders that run counter to the morali
ty of individual soldiers. Service
members are in these cases general
ly obliged to follow orders rather
than the dictates of conscience
(though they are educated â€”in
ROTC to test their orders
against their duty to the Constitu
tion and to the law). Sudheimer
seems to prefer a world in which
each individual holds absolute
moral veto authority over matters
in which he is complicit. One in
which the Iraq war would have
been funded by the taxes of only
those who deemed it just, and in
which a pharmacist can refuse con
traception to an unmarried woman.
Such a world has its appeals, but it is
not the world we live in. Rather, our
society enacts laws via representa
tive legislatures, laws binding to all
citizens regardless of their moral
stances. By participating in the so
cial contract, we are complicit in

acts we find morally suspect. If we
wish to eliminate those acts we do
so through political advocacy and
not, for instance, by rehearsing
baseless stereotypes about the mili
tary and ignoring its realities.
One can argue that there is a
qualitative difference between my
funding an unjust war and a soldier
fighting it. But to say that the spirit
of the university must encourage
the former and discourage the lat
ter is contradictory. The solution to
both moral quandaries is engage
ment in government electing
legislators and executives who will
declare only just wars and conduct
them ethically. It is not putting up

barriers to students who wish to
serve their country. Ultimately,
however, ideological concerns are
secondary. Until peace reigns, the
United States will have a military
that requires ambitious, talented of
ficers to lead it. In evaluating the
ROTC program, universities must
decide to what extent preserving a
trifling ideological purity out
weighs the good that future classes
of freethinking, morally astute offi
cers could do for their country and
the world at large.
