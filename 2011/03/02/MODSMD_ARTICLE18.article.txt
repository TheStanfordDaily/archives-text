Dear Editor,
Keith Sudheimer's recent Op-
Ed regarding the potential return of
ROTC to the Stanford campus
("Darth Vader Says 'Yes' To the
ROTC") illustrates an ideologically
extreme and unproductive under
standing of military service. Sud
heimer argues that since soldiers in
the field are obliged to follow or
ders regardless of their moral posi
tions, military service is antithetical
to the intellectual goals of the uni
versity. In so doing he misunder
stands the nature of the ROTC pro
gram and disregards the structure
of government through which mili

tary decisions are made.
Though obvious, it bears empha
sis that ROTC is not compulsory
military service. ROTC programs
give students the option to take part
in coursework and training leading
to a commission as a military officer
upon graduation. Official sanction
of ROTC in no way constitutes ap
proval of military actions or doc
trine. Further, the strictures of mili
tary service relate not to privately
held morals, but to behavior. The
military is not the Thought Police,
eradicating heterodoxy among its
members. Rather, it expects actions
consistent with the interests of the

United States.
These interests may lead to or
ders that run counter to the morali
ty of individual soldiers. Service
members are in these cases general
ly obliged to follow orders rather
than the dictates of conscience
(though they are educated â€”in
ROTC to test their orders
against their duty to the Constitu
tion and to the law). Sudheimer
seems to prefer a world in which
each individual holds absolute
moral veto authority over matters
in which he is complicit. One in
