## MIDWEEK WIN Stanford beats Santa Clara, 8-4 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Highly-touted freshman pitcher
A.J. Vanegas made the most out of
his first start in Cardinal, securing
an 8-4 win for No. 9 Stanford over
Santa Clara and allowing just one
run in four innings.
With solid hitting by sopho
mores Jake Stewart and Kenny
Diekroeger, the win moved the Car
dinal to 5-3 in its rigorous early-sea
son schedule.

After seven games against Rice,
California and Vanderbilt all
ranked teams Stanford took ad
vantage of the less challenging
weekday matchup to improve its
record before setting out on a three
game weekend series at No. 6 Texas.
Santa Clara got on the board
early, capitalizing on first-inning
mistakes by Vanegas, who had diffi
culty controlling his off-speed
pitches. Bronco leadoff hitter Zach
Looney was hit by a 2-2 pitch and
advanced to second on a poorly
thrown pickoff before scoring on a
Jake DeMerritt single.
"It was a great opportunity for
me to get my first start, and hopeful
ly, I'll get more in the future," Vane
gas said. "I wanted to go out there
with a calm attitude, but I was really
excited to get the first start, and I'm
excited that it went well."
Vanegas got out of the inning by
striking out Pat Stover, the first of
four punch-outs for the right-han
der.
Stanford responded with a

three-run first, benefitting from two
wild pitches by Santa Clara starter
Joe Supple and making the most of
a double by Diekroeger.
Supple had a hard time settling
down, allowing five hits in 2.1 in
nings before being pulled. Vanegas,
on the other hand, got into stride
quickly, retiring eight straight bat
ters in the middle of his outing.
"It's awesome [to get the win],"
he said. "It's what you want to do

win games and put your team in a
good position to win."
The freshman's success will con
tinue to be crucial for the Cardinal,
which lost junior starter Brett
Mooneyham to a hurt finger for the
rest of the season.

"We'll get Vanegas in," said head
coach, Mark Marquess. "I don't
know if he'll be starting, but he'll
play a critical role for us coming out
of the bullpen or whatever we might

want him to do."
After two scoreless innings, the
Cardinal exploded with two straight
left-field doubles in the fourth by
Stewart and sophomore leftfielder
Tyler Gaffney. Diekroeger followed
with his third hit of the night, cap
ping a four-run frame. Stewart,
Gaffney and Diekroeger combined
for seven hits, five runs and six RBI.
The sophomore trio seems to be
benefiting from experience during

their second year on the Farm.
"Last year, you're coming in as a
freshman, and you're a little tense,"
Stewart said. "I think this year just
having a year of experience under
my belt helps me. I'm so much more
relaxed up there."
Even with strong winds building
out to right field, Stanford contin
ued to pound the ball into the left
field corner; senior Zach Jones
tripled down the foul line in the sev
enth and came home on a sacrifice
fly by Stewart for Stanford's eighth
run.
Santa Clara got one run off jun
ior reliever AJ. Talt in the fifth to
make the score 7-2, but the Broncos
stranded runners in scoring position
in the fifth and sixth innings. Facing
junior lefthander Scott Snodgress
Santa Clara stuck around with two
runs on tough infield plays in the
seventh frame.
Things got scarier for Stanford in
the eighth, when Santa Clara
loaded the bases and Lucas Herbst
got a hold of an 0-1 pitch, but the
blast was well right of the first-base
foul line, Snodgress would strike
Herbst out and get DeMerritt to fly
out to end the inning.
A 1-2-3 ninth frame sealed the
deal for the Card.
"We got some good pitching,"

"It was a great opportunity for
me to get my first start, and hopeful
ly, I'll get more in the future," Vane
gas said. "I wanted to go out there
with a calm attitude, but I was really
excited to get the first start, and I'm
excited that it went well."
Vanegas got out of the inning by
striking out Pat Stover, the first of
four punch-outs for the right-han
der.
Stanford responded with a

three-run first, benefitting from two
wild pitches by Santa Clara starter
Joe Supple and making the most of
a double by Diekroeger.
Supple had a hard time settling
down, allowing five hits in 2.1 in
nings before being pulled. Vanegas,
on the other hand, got into stride
quickly, retiring eight straight bat
ters in the middle of his outing.
"It's awesome [to get the win],"
he said. "It's what you want to do

win games and put your team in a
good position to win."
The freshman's success will con
tinue to be crucial for the Cardinal,
which lost junior starter Brett
Mooneyham to a hurt finger for the
rest of the season.

"We'll get Vanegas in," said head
coach, Mark Marquess. "I don't
know if he'll be starting, but he'll
play a critical role for us coming out
of the bullpen or whatever we might

want him to do."
After two scoreless innings, the
Cardinal exploded with two straight
left-field doubles in the fourth by
Stewart and sophomore leftfielder
Tyler Gaffney. Diekroeger followed
with his third hit of the night, cap
ping a four-run frame. Stewart,
Gaffney and Diekroeger combined
for seven hits, five runs and six RBI.
The sophomore trio seems to be
benefiting from experience during

their second year on the Farm.
"Last year, you're coming in as a
freshman, and you're a little tense,"
Stewart said. "I think this year just
having a year of experience under
my belt helps me. I'm so much more
relaxed up there."
Even with strong winds building
out to right field, Stanford contin
ued to pound the ball into the left
field corner; senior Zach Jones
tripled down the foul line in the sev
enth and came home on a sacrifice
fly by Stewart for Stanford's eighth
run.
Santa Clara got one run off jun
ior reliever AJ. Talt in the fifth to
make the score 7-2, but the Broncos
stranded runners in scoring position
in the fifth and sixth innings. Facing
junior lefthander Scott Snodgress
Santa Clara stuck around with two
runs on tough infield plays in the
seventh frame.
Things got scarier for Stanford in
the eighth, when Santa Clara
loaded the bases and Lucas Herbst
got a hold of an 0-1 pitch, but the
blast was well right of the first-base
foul line, Snodgress would strike
Herbst out and get DeMerritt to fly
out to end the inning.
A 1-2-3 ninth frame sealed the
deal for the Card.
"We got some good pitching,"

Sophomore leftfielder Tyler Gaffney, above, had two hits, two RBI and two runs scored in Stanford's win over Santa
Clara yesterday. The Cardinal now travels to Austin, Texas for a three-game series at No. 6 Texas.

Marquess said. "Vanegas got some

[junior Chris] Reed were there
when we needed them out of the
pen, and they'll be ready for the
weekend."
The Cardinal now heads to
Austin to face Texas in a three
game series. First pitch on Friday is
scheduled for 1 p.m., in yet another
series against a top-20 team
Stanford's third of the year.

"I think it's really good for our
team," Stewart said. "We come out,
get contested early and get contest
ed often.
"We looked online, and all 10
[Pac-10] teams are in the top-15 in
strength of schedule. It's great that
we come out and play teams like
Vanderbilt and Rice and Texas
away to get us ready for our Pac-10
schedule," he added.
Sophomore Mark Appel, who
lost a close series opener against
Vanderbilt last week, is slated to

Highly-touted freshman pitcher
A.J. Vanegas made the most out of
his first start in Cardinal, securing
an 8-4 win for No. 9 Stanford over
Santa Clara and allowing just one
run in four innings.
With solid hitting by sopho
mores Jake Stewart and Kenny
Diekroeger, the win moved the Car
dinal to 5-3 in its rigorous early-sea
son schedule.

After seven games against Rice,
California and Vanderbilt all
ranked teams Stanford took ad
vantage of the less challenging
weekday matchup to improve its
record before setting out on a three
game weekend series at No. 6 Texas.
Santa Clara got on the board
early, capitalizing on first-inning
mistakes by Vanegas, who had diffi
culty controlling his off-speed
pitches. Bronco leadoff hitter Zach
Looney was hit by a 2-2 pitch and
advanced to second on a poorly
thrown pickoff before scoring on a
Jake DeMerritt single.
"It was a great opportunity for
me to get my first start, and hopeful
ly, I'll get more in the future," Vane
gas said. "I wanted to go out there
with a calm attitude, but I was really
