Allyse Ishino also the nation's third
ranked competitor on the bars was out
with an ankle injury.
Ishino got hurt performing her floor ex

on the bars and the floor, where she scored
9.850 and 9.825, respectively.

matched two season highs and set a new
career high. Morgan finished first in the
vault with a career-best 9.925 Stan
ford's highest score on the event all season.
Morgan continued to dominate and
took first on the beam as well as the floor.
On beam, she matched her career best of
9.900, while on the floor she was on par
with her best performances at 9.925.
Another Cardinal sophomore, Nicole
Dayton, matched the 9.850 she scored on

first time in her career and scored a 9.825.
