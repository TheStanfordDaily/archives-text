# Stanford survives Seattle
## Men's basketball wins last home game 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
Despite one of its sloppiest per
formances of the season, the Stan
ford men's basketball team ended
its home season with a 77-66 win
over Seattle University Tuesday
night at Maples Pavilion.

The Cardinal (15-14, 7-10 Pac
-10) struggled early in the rare
March non-conference game
thanks to some of the worst point
guard play it has had all season. Ju
nior Jarrett Mann, freshman Aaron
Bright and sophomore Gabriel
Harris were all used at the point
guard position in the first half, and
the trio combined for nine of Stan
ford's 13 first-half turnovers while
going scoreless.
Those 13 turnovers were enough
to offset Stanford's significant ad
vantage in shooting, as the Cardinal
shot 50 percent from the field in the

first half while the Redhawks (11-
18) shot 28.9 percent. However,
Stanford went into the break with
only a one-point lead. Seattle's
quick perimeter pressure com
bined with poor decisions by Cardi
nal guards led to plenty of empty
possessions for Stanford, while the
Cardinal defense gave the Red
hawks open look after open look.
Stanford clung to a 28-27 half
time advantage thanks to hot
shooting from junior guard Jeremy
Green, junior forward Josh Owens,
freshman guard Anthony Brown
and freshman forward John Gage,
Those four players combined for 26
of the Cardinal's 28 points on 11-14
shooting.
"I think that at halftime we had a
talk about having pride and not
overlooking this team," Brown
said. "I think in the first half we kind
of, you know, said, 'Okay, well,
they're Seattle. We don't have to
play hard, and we can beat them.'
They came out and competed for
the first 20 minutes, and after our
little halftime speech, I think we
just played with more energy."
Tlie halftime speech appeared to
work, because the Cardinal came
out on fire. Stanford opened the half
on a 21-6 run to open up a 49-33
lead, its largest of the game. During
the stretch, the Cardinal made all
nine of its shots, including four by
Brown. Green was also superb on
offense. Green made the first seven
shots he took, including four three
pointers, to bring the small crowd at
Maples Pavilion to life. Green's first
miss of the game came at the free
throw line, where Stanford made
only eight of its first 17 attempts.
After Green's final three-point
er, the Cardinal led 61-46 and ap
peared to be cruising to victory.
Stanford went cold though, scoring
only six points in the next seven and
a half minutes, and Seattle got right
back in the game thanks to strong
defense and rebounding. The Red
hawks grabbed 14 offensive re
bounds to the Cardinal's three, and
narrowed Stanford's lead to 67-61
with just over two minutes to play.

I definitely think we treated
them lightly," Brown said. "We have
the Cal game coming up on Satur
day, you know, we might have just
overlooked them. This is like one of
their last Pac-10 games. You know,
they're not in a conference, so
they're trying to make a showing
for themselves."
Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins called a timeout to calm
his team down, and Seattle came
out of the break fouling, which
seemed to be a good strategy con
sidering the Cardinal's shaky free
throw shooting. Stanford respond
ed though, sinking 10 of its final 12
attempts from the charity stripe to
secure the victory.
For the game, both teams made
25 field goals. The difference was
that the Redhawks needed 28 more
attempts to reach 25 field goals,
largely due to Stanford's 21
turnovers, and the Cardinal had a
significant advantage from both the
free-throw and three-point lines.
Stanford shot 9-for-16 from beyond
the arc compared to Seattle's 4-for
-18 and was 18-for-29 on free throws
(16-for-25 in the second half) com
pared to Seattle's 12-for-17.
Green and Brown led the way
for Stanford, combining for 43
points on 14-for-20 shooting from
the field and 7-for-ll shooting from
three-point range. Brown also
grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds
to notch his first career double
double.
"I thought Anthony did a great
job," Dawkins said. "Fie scored the
basketball getting the shots he had
and got some good looks. More im
portantly was the rebounds. I
thought he did a great job on the
boards. We've been challenging him
in that area, to be more active on
the boards for us. And he really re
sponded tonight."
Owens also chipped in 13 points,
six rebounds, five assists and two
blocks before fouling out in the
final minutes. FTis blocks were two
of Stanford's eight, while the Red
hawks did not have any.
Stanford concludes its regular
season on Saturday when it heads
across the Bay to take on rival Cal.
Tipoff is scheduled for 4 p.m.

Despite one of its sloppiest per
formances of the season, the Stan
ford men's basketball team ended
its home season with a 77-66 win
over Seattle University Tuesday
night at Maples Pavilion.

The Cardinal (15-14, 7-10 Pac
-10) struggled early in the rare
March non-conference game
thanks to some of the worst point
guard play it has had all season. Ju
nior Jarrett Mann, freshman Aaron
Bright and sophomore Gabriel
Harris were all used at the point
guard position in the first half, and
the trio combined for nine of Stan
ford's 13 first-half turnovers while
going scoreless.
Those 13 turnovers were enough
to offset Stanford's significant ad
vantage in shooting, as the Cardinal
shot 50 percent from the field in the

first half while the Redhawks (11-
18) shot 28.9 percent. However,
Stanford went into the break with
only a one-point lead. Seattle's
quick perimeter pressure com
bined with poor decisions by Cardi
nal guards led to plenty of empty
possessions for Stanford, while the
Cardinal defense gave the Red
hawks open look after open look.
Stanford clung to a 28-27 half
time advantage thanks to hot
shooting from junior guard Jeremy
Green, junior forward Josh Owens,
freshman guard Anthony Brown
and freshman forward John Gage,
Those four players combined for 26
of the Cardinal's 28 points on 11-14
shooting.
"I think that at halftime we had a
talk about having pride and not
overlooking this team," Brown
said. "I think in the first half we kind
of, you know, said, 'Okay, well,
they're Seattle. We don't have to
play hard, and we can beat them.'
They came out and competed for
the first 20 minutes, and after our
little halftime speech, I think we
just played with more energy."
Tlie halftime speech appeared to
work, because the Cardinal came
out on fire. Stanford opened the half
on a 21-6 run to open up a 49-33
lead, its largest of the game. During
the stretch, the Cardinal made all
nine of its shots, including four by
Brown. Green was also superb on
offense. Green made the first seven
shots he took, including four three
pointers, to bring the small crowd at
Maples Pavilion to life. Green's first
miss of the game came at the free
throw line, where Stanford made
only eight of its first 17 attempts.
After Green's final three-point
er, the Cardinal led 61-46 and ap
peared to be cruising to victory.
Stanford went cold though, scoring
only six points in the next seven and
a half minutes, and Seattle got right
back in the game thanks to strong
defense and rebounding. The Red
hawks grabbed 14 offensive re
bounds to the Cardinal's three, and
narrowed Stanford's lead to 67-61
with just over two minutes to play.

I definitely think we treated
them lightly," Brown said. "We have
the Cal game coming up on Satur
day, you know, we might have just
overlooked them. This is like one of
their last Pac-10 games. You know,
they're not in a conference, so
they're trying to make a showing
for themselves."
Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins called a timeout to calm
his team down, and Seattle came
out of the break fouling, which
seemed to be a good strategy con
sidering the Cardinal's shaky free
throw shooting. Stanford respond
ed though, sinking 10 of its final 12
attempts from the charity stripe to
secure the victory.
For the game, both teams made
25 field goals. The difference was
that the Redhawks needed 28 more
attempts to reach 25 field goals,
largely due to Stanford's 21
turnovers, and the Cardinal had a
significant advantage from both the
free-throw and three-point lines.
Stanford shot 9-for-16 from beyond
the arc compared to Seattle's 4-for
-18 and was 18-for-29 on free throws
(16-for-25 in the second half) com
pared to Seattle's 12-for-17.
Green and Brown led the way
for Stanford, combining for 43
points on 14-for-20 shooting from
the field and 7-for-ll shooting from
three-point range. Brown also
grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds
to notch his first career double
double.
"I thought Anthony did a great
job," Dawkins said. "Fie scored the
basketball getting the shots he had
and got some good looks. More im
portantly was the rebounds. I
thought he did a great job on the
boards. We've been challenging him
in that area, to be more active on
the boards for us. And he really re
sponded tonight."
Owens also chipped in 13 points,
six rebounds, five assists and two
blocks before fouling out in the
final minutes. FTis blocks were two
of Stanford's eight, while the Red
hawks did not have any.
Stanford concludes its regular
season on Saturday when it heads
across the Bay to take on rival Cal.
Tipoff is scheduled for 4 p.m.
