# Women top USC, win UCI Invite
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Last weekend's UCI Invitational
culminated with another matchup
between the two giants of women's
collegiate water polo, Stanford and
USC. For the second time this sea
son, No. 1 played No. 2 for a tourna
ment crown, and for the second
straight time, Stanford came out on
top against the defending national
champions.
The top-ranked Cardinal (13-0)
made it a bit less dramatic against the
Trojans this time, winning 9-6 par
for the course after a pair of 10-9
heart-pounders between the confer
ence rivals during this year's Stan
ford Invitational and 2010 National
Championship game.
The two-day, 16-team UCI Invita
tional featured some of the best
water polo teams in the country, in
cluding the top seven ranked squads.
Stanford began the tournament on
Saturday, Feb. 26 against CSU Bak
ersfield and No. 9 Arizona State. The
Cardinal cruised to two victories,
winning 19-3 and 15-7, respectively.

The Card got offensive contribu
tions from a variety of players. Junior
driver Alyssa Lo and junior two
meter Melissa Seidemann both net
ted five goals in the first two games.
Freshman driver Kaley Dodson con
tinued her fantastic rookie campaign
by tallying four goals, and senior driv
er Kim Krueger had a hat trick
against the Sun Devils.

In addition to the diversified of
fensive attack, Stanford played excel
lent defense. All three goalies
sophomore Kate Baldoni and sen
iors Kim Hall and Amber Oland
saw playing time on the first day of
the invitational. The three combined
for 22 saves in the two matches.

"We have gotten good contribu
tions from players in each position
and class, which makes us a good
tournament team," said head coach
John Tanner.

Stanford's depth proved crucial
on the second day of action as the
Card defeated No. 5 Hawaii, 10-5.
The Cardinal had an uncharacteristic
start, falling behind, 0-2, after the
opening frame. However, the team
pulled away, outscoring the Warriors
8-1 over the next two periods.
"Against Hawaii, we got good
bench play after we started slow,"
Tanner said. "Everyone was com
posed and resourceful, and we
turned a 2-0 deficit into an 8-2 lead."

The Cardinal was led offensively
by Krueger, who had four goals. Lo
and Seidemann also chipped in with
a pair a piece in the semifinal match.
The high-powered offense was com
plimented by phenomenal goalie
play, as Baldoni recorded eight saves.
The championship game was a
much-anticipated rematch between
Stanford and USC. The two teams
played a triple-overtime marathon
last time out in the championship
game of the Stanford Invitational.
This time, it was goalie Amber
Oland who stole the show, as the
senior amassed 14 saves against the
Trojans. On the offensive end, junior
two-meter Annika Dries, who had
yet to score in the first three games
of the tournament, led all scorers
with four goals.
"Against USC, we moved the ball
around better, but we're still stiff,
mechanical in all parts of our of
fense," Tanner said. "However, we
scored on a couple six-on-five
[plays], after getting nothing from
our power plays last time. Much of
that six-and-five success came down
to shooting better."
With the solid weekend, Stanford
extended its current winning streak
to 13 games and captured its second
UCI Invitational title in three years.
The Cardinal will open up its Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation sched
ule at No. 7 San Diego State on Satur
day and then at No. 12 Long Beach
State the following day. The next
home game for the Card is scheduled
for March 26 versus UCLA.
