## Forum re-examines judicial process 
### JANELLE WOLAK 
Last night at El Centra Chicano, the
Office of Judicial Affairs and the ASSU
co-hosted a forum to garner student
opinions and perspectives on the Uni
versity judicial process. The event
brought together staff from the Office of
Judicial Affairs, ASSU Senators, mem
bers of the Executive Cabinet, students
with a personal connection to the judi
cial process and other interested parties.
A review of Stanford's Judicial Charter
of 1997 has been "long overdue," said
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll.
Thirteen years after the creation of the Ju
dicial Charter, the Internal Review Panel
is currently working on an extensive eval
uation of the procedures and functions
that are put into action when a student is

accused of violating the Fundamental
Standard, the Honor Code or any other
student conduct policy. The panel consists
of faculty, staff and four students including
Cardona.
Student input plays a central role in
this overhaul of Judicial Affairs, said Chris
Griffith, associate vice provost for Stu
dent Affairs and Dean of Student Life,
"Your voice is critical to the process,"
Griffith said, addressing the audience.
Last night's forum featured presenta
tions from all four subcommittees of the
Internal Review Panel: the Honor Code,
the Standard of Proof, Best Practices
and the Fundamental Standard. The sec
ond half of the forum gave students the
opportunity to express their own opin
ions in small groups led by members of
each of the four subcommittees.

"One of the biggest concerns is just the
speed of the [judicial] process," said ASSU
Senator Stewart Macgregor Dennis 'l3.
According to Griffith, the process usu
ally takes around five months because ju
dicial panels are not held during the first
week of the quarter, dead week or finals
week. Cases initiated spring quarter are
often not resolved until fall quarter of the
following academic year.
Morris Graves, associate dean of Stu
dent Life, argued that, if the judicial
process takes longer than three weeks,
students do not learn from the judicial
process and focus instead on their frustra
tion with bureaucratic red tape. A top pri
ority is to come up with new ways to short
en the process.
ASSU Senator Juany Torres 'l3
said "it's up to the student to speak
up" in instances of cheating and
plagiarism. But she quickly added
that "it's often difficult for them to
do that."
In fact, faculty members tend to
report far more cases of cheating or
plagiarism than do students. The
student-led Educational Outreach
Committee hopes to address this
issue by working to better educate
the student body about the Honor
Code via t-shirt campaigns.
According to Theo Gibbs 'll,
another important issue is the un
willingness of victims of sexual ha
rassment and assault to come for
ward in the judicial process. Victims
are less likely to come forward be
cause University standards in this
area are too stringent.
"There's a very strong argument
for lowering standard of proof
from 'beyond a reasonable doubt'
to 'clear and convincing' or 'pre
ponderance of evidence' in terms
of cases of sexual assault or harass
ment," Gibbs said.
Stanford is only one of four
schools with this particular stan
dard; most schools use more re
laxed standards like "preponder
ance of evidence" and "clear and
convincing evidence."
Last night's event was well re
ceived by members of the audi
ence.
"I'm glad we did this," said Stu
dent Life Assistant Dean Jamie
Hogan, who is chairing the review
process. "The conversations I heard
were all thought-provoking."
Cardona pointed out that while
the student input forum was an af
fective avenue for some students to
express their opinions, there are
other options available for those
who wish to remain anonymous.
The Internal Review Panel wel
comes phone calls, e-mails and let
ters from concerned students.
These will all play an important
part in the panel's final recommen
dations to President John Hen
nessy and Vice Provost Greg
Boardman at the end of the year.
