# U.N's Luck stresses duty to protect
## Speaker cites Libya as case for int'l action 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Edward Luck, Assistant Secretary-General of the
United Nations, gave a lecture on "the responsibility to
protect" at Stanford Law School yesterday. This political
norm adopted by the United Nations in 2005 gives the
Security Council the right to take action against countries
that violate certain rights of their people.
Luck's lecture, "Stopping Atrocity Crimes: 'The Re
sponsibility to Protect' Five Years On," touched on the
basic principles behind the concept, its wider acceptance
by national governments and its significance in prevent
ing future massacres.
The norm gives the Security Council the right to take
action when it is clear that genocide, ethnic cleansing, war
crimes and crimes against humanity are committed in a
country.
Luck touched on the significance of last Saturday's Unit
ed Nations resolution against Libya. It included econom
ic sanctions and stressed that states could use the respon
sibility to protect as justification for military force.
"It's pretty striking that despite or maybe even be
cause of the composition of the Council now, that it
was able to have unanimity," Luck said of the resolution.
He added that including the incitement of these
crimes would also be seen as cause for concern. In the
1994 Rwandan genocide, Hutus characterized their rival
Tutsis as cockroaches. According to Luck, there are par
allels to Rwanda in Libya's current unrest.
"Unfortunately, one of the things that got us very wor
ried about Qadhafi is he called his political opponents the
other day cockroaches," he said of the Libyan leader.
"Now maybe he doesn't know the connection, but I'm a
little worried that he does know the connection, and
maybe some of his listeners may know the connection."
There is now a greater acceptance of the responsibili
ty to protect in the international community. With India,
South Africa and Brazil currently on the 15-member Se
curity Council, new powers are having a say. Luck said
these countries want to be seen as playing a constructive
role. Now he argues that individual countries must stress
the issue to their own people.
"What the Security Council needs is a good political
push from their parliaments, from their journalists, from
their publics to say 'these things matter and they matter
in away they didn't matter before, and they actually re-
late to our national interest,'" he
said.
On China, Luck said the Chinese
want to be seen as following global
norms. This circumstance, coupled
with the fact that Libya's own Unit
ed Nations representative publicly
urged the world to act, factored into
China's decision to vote with the rest
of the Security Council on the vio
lence in Libya.
Lonjezo Hamisi, a third-year doc
toral student in political science, is
optimistic that Rwandan-style geno
cide will be avoided thanks to the
force that can accompany this politi
cal norm.
"I think it's a good thing for the
world," he said. "It can only be a
good thing for the world that now
there's this normative development
of the rejection of crimes against hu
manity. In other words, the interna
tional community is making a state
ment against impunity."
Luck's talk was sponsored by the
Crothers Global Citizenship Dorm,
the Stanford International Law So
ciety and other groups.
