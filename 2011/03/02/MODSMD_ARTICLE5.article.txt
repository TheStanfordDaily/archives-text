## Research studies HIV prevention in Ukraine

The most effective way to combat the
spread of HIV spread by intravenous drug use
is a combined program of drug substitution
and anti-retroviral therapy for those already
infected, according to a study conducted by
Stanford University and the Veteran Affairs
Palo Alto Health Care System.
The project, funded by the National Insti
tute on Drug Abuse, the Department of Veter
ans Affairs and a Gabilan Stanford Graduate
Fellowship, studied ways to combat the spread
of HIV in Ukraine. The findings were released
in the March issue of PLoS-Medicine.
Ukraine has the highest prevalence of HIV
in Eastern Europe. Approximately half of drug
users in the country are HIV-infected, and the
disease is spreading into the broader popula
tion.
Through computer modeling, the authors
of the study examined data such as the rate of
HIV transmission and the outcomes of treat
ment and prevention efforts in the country.
Using this information, they made assump
tions about what would happen if current drug
users received methadone as a substitution to
their intravenous drugs.
Without these proposed interventions, the
researchers calculated that 67.2 percent of
drug users would be infected with HIV in the
next 20 years. They predicted that if just 25 per
cent of drug users received methadone, the fig
ure for HIV infection could be lowered to 53.1
percent.
Recently, the government of Ukraine en-
dorsed a new law promoting this
same substitution therapy and nee
dle exchanges for drug users.
Though the study looked specifical
ly at Ukraine's population, its con
clusion can also be applied through
out Eastern Europe and Central
Asia, regions that have the highest
rates of HIV transmission in the en
tire world.
