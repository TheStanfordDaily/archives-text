## Senate assesses elections, role of solicitors general Mamonov presented Seliger youth camp to senators 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a postponed start due to the
Judicial Affairs town hall Tuesday,
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed legislation defining the role of
the ASSU solicitors general and dis
cussed elections progress.
The Senators also heard from
Mikhail Mamonov, head of the Inter
national Relations Department for
the Federal Agency on Youth Affairs
of the Russian Federation. ASSU
Executive Angelina Cardona 'll in
troduced Mamonov and referred to
her experience traveling to Russia in
November as part of a conference for
international student leaders.
Mamonov presented on Seliger,
an international youth camp, and dis
cussed potential areas of collabora
tion and interest for Stanford stu
dents.
Students attending Seliger can
focus in four areas: civil and social de
velopment, innovation and enter
prise, world politics and mass media
and public relations.
Mamonov touched on mutual
criticisms Russian and American

politics, but stressed the program's
potential to bridge these differences
and form bonds between young lead
ers, especially in terms of innovation
and new technology.
The Senate also passed legislation
Tuesday that outlined the role of the
ASSU solicitors general in advising
and representing students in consti
tutional cases. When the solicitors
general previously presented the bill,
the Constitutional Council ex
pressed disappointment that the bill
commented on the role of the Consti
tutional Council. The Senate encour
aged collaboration between the two
bodies, and both returned last night
with pieces of legislation reflecting
compromise.
After presenting the legislation,
Adam Adler 'l2 transitioned from
his role as a solicitor general to a rep
resentative for the Flipside publica
tion, encouraging senators to sign the
group's controversial special fees pe
tition requesting funds for a segway
to increase campus presence.
When Daniel Khalessi 'l3 joking
ly said he would sign it under the con
dition that Adler run for Senate,
Adler responded that he would find
continued attendance at all of the
meetings difficult.
"Sitting here listening to the re
quests, people can say some ridicu
lous things sometimes," Adler said.
Cardona motioned to end the de
bate during open forum.
Constitutional Council member
Mateo Wilmott 'll voiced his disap
pointment in the discussion.
"We're sitting here spending time
talking about segways ... [when] it's
an honor to have someone here ask
ing questions about American
democracy," he said, referring to Ma
monov.
Elections Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 briefed the Senate on
elections progress, reporting that the
deadline for candidates' declarations

of intent to run for Graduate Student
Council (GSC) members will be
pushed to the last day of the quarter, as
GSC candidates do not have to peti
tion and only three have declared in
tent so far.
Trusheim also raised the issue
that currently no slate is running for
junior class president, the perceived
obstacle being the tradition of going
abroad during junior year.
Currently, the junior year slate is
permitted to be five people, with the
requirement that four be active each
quarter. Trusheim will present legis
lation next week to change these re
quirements, most likely increasing
the number of people allowed on a
slate.
During committee reports, the
Student Life, Education and Hous
ing Committee highlighted their
bike safety event tomorrow and
Thursday in Lagunita and Stern din-

ing, respectively. The event will in
clude free bike lights, discounted
helmets, bike safety tips and free
bike servicing on the spot.
At the end of the meeting, Rafael
Vazquez raised his concern that only
two upperclassmen are running to
serve on the Senate next year.
"I think there's a really big prob
lem with that," Vazquez said, hoping
to encourage future dialogue about
how to encourage older students to
engage with the ASSU.
Next week's Senate meeting, the
last of the quarter, will be replaced
by the Joint Legislative Meeting at 6
p.m. on Tuesday, March 8. The Sen
ate passed several motions by ASSU
Vice President Michael Cruz 'l2 yes
terday to amend the joint rules of
order for the meeting, most notably
granting undergraduate students
full speaking rights and permitting
open dialogue with members of the
administration.
Following the changes, the Senate
will be able to consider legislation
next week and will discuss bills to
confirm Nominations Commission
representatives, to reform the Nomi
nations Commission by-laws and to
amend the rules of order of the Con
stitutional Council.
The Senate passed all funding
bills of the evening.
