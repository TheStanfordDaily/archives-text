## Senate assesses elections, role of solicitors general Mamonov presented Seliger youth camp to senators 
### MARGARET RAWSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a postponed start due to the
Judicial Affairs town hall Tuesday,
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed legislation defining the role of
the ASSU solicitors general and dis
cussed elections progress.
The Senators also heard from
Mikhail Mamonov, head of the Inter
national Relations Department for
the Federal Agency on Youth Affairs
of the Russian Federation. ASSU
Executive Angelina Cardona 'll in
troduced Mamonov and referred to
her experience traveling to Russia in
November as part of a conference for
international student leaders.
Mamonov presented on Seliger,
an international youth camp, and dis
cussed potential areas of collabora
tion and interest for Stanford stu
dents.
Students attending Seliger can
focus in four areas: civil and social de
velopment, innovation and enter
prise, world politics and mass media
and public relations.
Mamonov touched on mutual
criticisms Russian and American

politics, but stressed the program's
potential to bridge these differences
and form bonds between young lead
ers, especially in terms of innovation
and new technology.
The Senate also passed legislation
Tuesday that outlined the role of the
ASSU solicitors general in advising
and representing students in consti
tutional cases. When the solicitors
general previously presented the bill,
the Constitutional Council ex
pressed disappointment that the bill
commented on the role of the Consti
tutional Council. The Senate encour
aged collaboration between the two
bodies, and both returned last night
with pieces of legislation reflecting
compromise.
After presenting the legislation,
Adam Adler 'l2 transitioned from
his role as a solicitor general to a rep
resentative for the Flipside publica
tion, encouraging senators to sign the
group's controversial special fees pe
tition requesting funds for a segway
to increase campus presence.
When Daniel Khalessi 'l3 joking
ly said he would sign it under the con
dition that Adler run for Senate,
Adler responded that he would find
continued attendance at all of the
meetings difficult.
