# OPINIONS
## I HAVE TWO HEADS Popping the bubble 
### Alex Hicks-Nelson 
He regards me with a side
long, speculative glare: how
much effort would it take to
bite this human's nose and make a
blitz for the nearest roof? I don't
blame him. It's a beautiful Sunday
morning at the Palo Alto Junior
Museum and Zoo and, if I were a
similarly feathered specimen, I
would want to go preen on a high
perch too. I turn my grudging
charge this way and that on my fist,
letting guests view the striking tail
feathers that are his namesake. No,
they don't eat fish too often. Yes, he
is native to the area. A red tailed
hawk wings past far overhead to
make my case in point, no doubt
wondering why the sulky looking
male on my glove isn't making bet
ter use of the day. An older gentle
man strolls over, a giant STAN
FORD reading in stark relief across
his chest. We talk briefly about cam
pus news before questions turn to
me. Am I here with some sort of
Stanford volunteering committee?
I can't help but laugh. Oh, Stanford.
People on campus are quick to
say they want to leave the Stanford
bubble, but I don't think putting ge
ographic distance between yourself
and campus is going to necessarily
work. I've never felt as detached
from campus as I do when at the
zoo, and the PAJMZ is a mere nine
blocks off campus. There are groups
that venture further for service
based goals and still drag the bubble
with them. What about those that
don't necessarily have a passion for
the topics targeted by the group, but
are looking for away to escape cam
pus living? Really, unless you dis
tance yourself from the remnants of
the Farm, you aren't doing much ex
cept toting the pressures of Stan
ford living around with you.
Similarly, loading up on the
"Stanford University (insert club
name)" extracurriculars isn't going
to cut it either. Your friends from
section are your friends on Face
book; your friends from your club
are in your lecture, and there gets to
be a point when going to unwind
with some juggling turns into talk
ing about whatever you were talk
ing about in lab class. There is some
thing to be said for meeting people
who have no idea why Professor
Doe gave you 17 problems for next
week, and hopefully, don't care.
I know that, when I get to the

zoo, I can let go of that Alex tied
into the workings of Stanford, and
meet people as just another animal
zealot. As I've expounded in "New
GER Required," there isn't away
to show, via transcript or admission,
that you are a decent person. By
seeking out activities beyond the
reach of Stanford, you can forge a
reputation based on your character,
and not your image amid the group.
I'm the type of person that revels in
cutting up squid for the shark tank,
sharing my knowledge of ferret
anatomy with kindergarten science
classes and forcing the raccoons to
get some exercise by running
around their enclosure with grapes.
If I were just another volunteer
amid the Cardinal swarm, I would
probably be constantly reminded of
some bit of busywork or stress I
should have left on Palm Drive.
Even more importantly, for
those who feel misrepresented by
their transcripts, pursuing opportu
nities outside the University shows
initiative and drive that otherwise
might not be emphasized on paper.
My boss at the zoo, for example,
wanted to be sure I was diligent
enough to arrive on time to my shift
indefinitely. Even before I arrived

By seeking out

on campus for fall quarter, my re
solve to volunteer there was tested.
My boss didn't return my calls, ig
nored my e-mails and generally hid
from me. When I finally got to Cali
fornia, I wasn't greeted as just an
other member of a Stanford affiliat
ed program I had to go through
all the paperwork and finger print

ing and waiting associated with get
ting a volunteer position with the
city of Palo Alto. I couldn't just rely
on students from previous years to
have made a good impression on
the zoo staff. As strange as it may
sound, the fact that I had to struggle
a bit to earn my place at the zoo
makes me all the more proud and
thankful for the opportunities I've
found there.
While I enjoy hearing about
Stanford affiliated "giving back"
programs, I can't help but mull over
the state of institutions wholly un

connected to the Farm. The staff at
the PAJMZ didn't realize anyone
on campus would be interested in
helping out at the zoo, and I expect
many nearby organizations have
much the same mindset. How mu
tually beneficial it seems, then, to fi
nally escape the Stanford bubble by
venturing outside of the clubs and
organizations tightly knit into its
structure.

feat the bubble? Tell Alex about it at

ographic distance between yourself
and campus is going to necessarily
work. I've never felt as detached
from campus as I do when at the
zoo, and the PAJMZ is a mere nine
blocks off campus. There are groups
that venture further for service
based goals and still drag the bubble
with them. What about those that
don't necessarily have a passion for
the topics targeted by the group, but
are looking for away to escape cam
pus living? Really, unless you dis
tance yourself from the remnants of
the Farm, you aren't doing much ex
cept toting the pressures of Stan
ford living around with you.
Similarly, loading up on the
"Stanford University (insert club
name)" extracurriculars isn't going
to cut it either. Your friends from
section are your friends on Face
book; your friends from your club
are in your lecture, and there gets to
be a point when going to unwind
with some juggling turns into talk
ing about whatever you were talk
ing about in lab class. There is some
thing to be said for meeting people
who have no idea why Professor
Doe gave you 17 problems for next
week, and hopefully, don't care.
I know that, when I get to the

zoo, I can let go of that Alex tied
into the workings of Stanford, and
meet people as just another animal
zealot. As I've expounded in "New
GER Required," there isn't away
to show, via transcript or admission,
that you are a decent person. By
seeking out activities beyond the
reach of Stanford, you can forge a
reputation based on your character,
and not your image amid the group.
I'm the type of person that revels in
cutting up squid for the shark tank,
sharing my knowledge of ferret
anatomy with kindergarten science
classes and forcing the raccoons to
get some exercise by running
around their enclosure with grapes.
If I were just another volunteer
amid the Cardinal swarm, I would
probably be constantly reminded of
some bit of busywork or stress I
should have left on Palm Drive.
Even more importantly, for
those who feel misrepresented by
their transcripts, pursuing opportu
nities outside the University shows
initiative and drive that otherwise
might not be emphasized on paper.
My boss at the zoo, for example,
wanted to be sure I was diligent
enough to arrive on time to my shift
indefinitely. Even before I arrived

on campus for fall quarter, my re
solve to volunteer there was tested.
My boss didn't return my calls, ig
nored my e-mails and generally hid
from me. When I finally got to Cali
fornia, I wasn't greeted as just an
other member of a Stanford affiliat
ed program I had to go through
all the paperwork and finger print

ing and waiting associated with get
ting a volunteer position with the
city of Palo Alto. I couldn't just rely
on students from previous years to
have made a good impression on
the zoo staff. As strange as it may
sound, the fact that I had to struggle
a bit to earn my place at the zoo
makes me all the more proud and
thankful for the opportunities I've
found there.
While I enjoy hearing about
Stanford affiliated "giving back"
programs, I can't help but mull over
the state of institutions wholly un

connected to the Farm. The staff at
the PAJMZ didn't realize anyone
on campus would be interested in
helping out at the zoo, and I expect
many nearby organizations have
much the same mindset. How mu
tually beneficial it seems, then, to fi
nally escape the Stanford bubble by
venturing outside of the clubs and
organizations tightly knit into its
structure.

feat the bubble? Tell Alex about it at
