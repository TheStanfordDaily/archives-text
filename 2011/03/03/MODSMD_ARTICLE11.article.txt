# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Paradise Lost (But Only Temporarily) 
### Shane Savitsky 
This is the last edition of "This
Column Is Ironic" you'll read
that was written on the Farm.
Scary, isn't it? Sadly, my ever-pro
lific course load of political science
papers precludes me from barrag
ing you with wit during our Dead
Week issue. (I promise you, politi
cal science actually requires me to
do some work.) When The Daily
resumes in spring quarter, I won't
be here. Instead, I'll be living it up
at home in Scranton, Pennsylvania
for a few weeks until I begin my
quarter abroad. That's right, guys:
I'm going to Oxford, and you're
coming with me. Don't worry,
things won't change that much. I
might start throwing a random "u"
into my words here and there. I
might also talk about tea more. Get
excited.
Yet, before any of that can hap
pen, I still have roughly two weeks
left here on campus. I thought I'd
be feeling sad about leaving. How
ever, as March 18 looms nearer and
nearer, I've never been more ready
to leave. It's time. Personally, these
past two quarters have been filled
with their share of ups and downs
most of which are intrinsically
tied to Stanford. When so much of
your life takes place in one concen
trated area, it can get kind of hard
to dissociate things. So for all of its
fantastic resources and opportuni
ties, there's one thing that this
place can't give me: a fresh start.
Oxford does just that. It's what I
need right now.
(Come to think of it, I think that
this stands in the upper echelon of
"first world problems." Let's go
over my situation in the clearest of
terms: I currently feel complacent
and stagnant at the elite university
I attend. To solve this problem, I'm
going to jet set across the Atlantic
to another elite university to get
myself back on track. Jesus, life's

tough, isn't it?)
This isn't to say that leaving
Stanford won't be extraordinarily
difficult. The Farm is my second
home. Even though I'm ready to
leave, I'm not sure I can deal with
six months away from this Eden we
all inhabit. (Plus, I'm going to be
missing spring quarter at Stanford.
Big mistake. The sun! The heat
waves! The sorority girls!) I keep
asking myself, "How am I ever
going to live life without the Bro
muda Triangle or the Axe and
Palm?" The answer there is, "Quite
easily." At the same time, I also
keep asking myself, "I know I'm
ready to take a break, but can Ox
ford ever measure up to Stanford?"
Ah, now there's a better ques
tion. Because no matter how in
credible Oxford may be, it will cer
tainly have a lot to live up to. In
England, I won't be able to climb
up on the roof of The Knoll or stroll
on Stanford Golf Course for mid
night talks about life. I won't have
offensive and hilarious sessions of
poker and/or Halo well into the
wee hours with my best friends.
And as beautiful and medieval as
Oxford may be, there's nothing
like walking through the Main
Quad on the sunniest of spring
days. These are just a few things
that Oxford will never be able to
replicate. Then again, I don't want
it to. There are certain memories
and experiences both good and
bad that are indelibly tied to

this place. I'd never change that.
You know, I poke fun at Stan
ford in this column a lot, but that's
only out of love. That's something
my friends know all too well. I can
be bitingly sarcastic to them some
times, but I only make fun of the
people and things I care about the
most. Oh, and last I checked, I've

written whole columns making fun
of myself, too. In the end, I guess
that just makes me a sarcastic
Stanford-loving narcissist. Seems
about right.
See you on the other side, Stan
ford. I may need a quarter away,
but there's no place I'd rather
spend my senior year.

Shane welcomes any tips for surviv
ing Oxford in spring quarter, but
first he has to survive a month in
Scranton. Any ideas? E-mail him at
