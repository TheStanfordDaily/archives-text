# SEEING GREEN

It took me 24 years to find an
abalone shell. Granted, I'd spent
the first 23 years of my life living
on a coastline where abalone don't
but I'd faithfully combed West
Coast beaches at every opportunity
to no avail until, last weekend, a
crescent of mother of pearl finally
caught my eye.
I pulled aside some rocks, and
there it was: four inches long with a
freckling of barnacles and delicate
arch of pores the perfect red
abalone shell.
Although any long-term Califor
nia resident who's really looked
knows abalone shells aren't impos
sible to find, they are quite rare
these days. In the late 1900s,
abalone once so common that it
was considered a "trash fish" eaten
only by the poor fell victim to the
combined pressures of overfishing
and Withering disease (a bacterial
infection that starves the mollusk to
an untimely end). Today, the sole
abalone fishery in California is
recreational, with each license limit
ed to only 24 red abalone each year.
The few restaurants that still serve
abalone at a premium ac
quire their portions from Mexico
or, increasingly, from local abalone
farmers.

Today, with only 22 percent of
US fisheries sustainably managed
and at least 14 percent of global
fisheries collapsed, piscivores in
creasingly turn to the products of
aquaculture the captive rearing
of fish, shellfish, crustaceans and
even algae. Abalone farming in
which juveniles are reared in shal
low-water pens on a diet of fast
growing kelp in tidally flushed wa
ters is touted as one of the most
sustainable examples of the ex
panding industry. It is also a labor of
love: it can take half a decade for
abalone to reach harvestable size.
(Before it died, the owner of my
shell would have been a scanty
mouthful.)
Mariculture as practiced by
abalone farmers, for example
harnesses the natural ocean system
by placing enclosures adjacent to or
just off the shoreline. Such farming
strategies use seawater to flush out
waste products and provide clean
water for captive animals. Other ex
amples include shrimp ponds in
Southeast Asia (sadly, known for
their role in mangrove habitat de
struction), salmon farms in the Pa

cific Northwest and tuna "ranches"
off the coast of Mexico (which pro
duce "laxfish," as the Japanese call
the LAX airport-marked meat).
Aquaculture has intuitive appeal:
it seems like an ideal way to conserve
wild populations while shrinking hu
manity's marine "footprint" by con
centrating biomass production in a
small area. Yet modern aquaculture,
as it is currently practiced, is hardly a
viable substitute for sustainably
managed fisheries.
Most fish farms bear eerie (but
unsurprising) resemblances to high
density terrestrial livestock opera
tions. Farmed fish require huge in
puts of food and regular doses of
antibiotics and hormones, and they
produce high concentrations of
waste products. Many farm-reared
species are predatory in the wild
and require high-protein diets in
captivity; even ecological herbi
vores, like tilapia, grow faster on
fishmeal and oil. So fish farms can
actually intensify pressure on wild
fisheries while converting an
chovies into bluefin. Densely
packed pens are incubators of dis
ease; farmed salmon are believed to
spread sea lice to migratory wild
populations as they swim by.
Farm denizens can also have di
rect effects on their wild cousins if
and when they escape their watery
corrals. As much as terrestrial live

stock are the products of hundreds
of years of domestication, so too are
aquaculture species chosen and
bred for domestic viability.
These species are transported to
farms around the world, where their
escape means introduction of a
non-native species. Atlantic salmon
reared in British Columbia are the
postcard example: in the last 15
years, one million have escaped into
the Pacific Ocean. Today, an
Alaskan recreational fishing permit
comes with strict quotas for native
salmon but you're welcome to as
many Atlantics as you can hook.
Even when farms rear local
species, escapees can dilute the wild
gene pool by introducing maladap
tive traits acquired over years in
captivity. Such "outbreeding de
pression" disrupts the balance be
tween the native population and the
environment it has adapted to.
And farmed replacements for
wild catches don't necessarily pro
tect at-risk fisheries. Bluefin ranch
es, for example, rear ocean-caught
juvenile fish, removing a subset
from wild populations. And the
reintroduction of abalone to com
mercial markets, where today a
pound of meat can sell for a whop
ping $5B, has whetted the appetites
of poachers. Just last month, two
San Francisco men were arrested
after their third illegal harvest of
wild red abalone.
Still, there are plenty of ways to
make aquaculture sustainable: using
closed circulation systems that pre
vent contamination of local waters,
choosing native herbivorous fish and
exercising patience instead of boost
ing natural growth rates with wild
fish biomass. Like the creation of the
abalone shell I'm holding, though,
these methods take time and a sense
of the delicate balance between or
ganisms and nature.
Today, aquaculture produces 45
million tons of food each year (com
pare to: 100 million tons extracted
annually from the ocean). It's a
growing business sector and a criti
cal protein source something we
cannot ignore as we look for ways to
feed a burgeoning human popula
tion. So it's important that we learn
to do it right right away.
