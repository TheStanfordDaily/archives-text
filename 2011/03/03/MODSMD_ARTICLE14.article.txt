## JUST ONE MORE Back-to-back perfect Pac-10 records in sight 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Just one more win.
That's all it will take for the Stanford women to com
plete their second perfect Pac-10 season in as many years,
as they close out conference play by hosting rival Cal
tonight. For a team that's made a habit of running away
with conference titles and setting records for win streaks, a
perfect season sure doesn't seem like much.
No. 2 Stanford (26-2,17-0 Pac-10) clinched its 11th con
secutive regular season Pac-10 championship last Saturday
with a 99-60 rout of

Oregon, a win that ex
tended the program's
best-ever home winning
streak to 61 games. The
team has won every
game in Maples Pavil
ion since beating San
Francisco, 96-61, on
Nov. 28,2007.
Tonight's matchup
with Cal (15-13, 7-10)
also marks the team's
annual Senior Night,
where guards Jeanette
Pohlen, Melanie Mur
phy and Hannah Don
aghe will be honored
along with forwards
Kayla Pedersen and
Ashley Cimino. Other
than the redshirt Mur
phy, Stanford's senior
class is per3fect at
Maples and has ended
every year with a Final
Four appearance
with one more, it would
set a Stanford record.
"Our senior class is

amazing, and me along with everyone else is going to miss
them so much," said freshman guard Toni Kokenis.
"They've definitely taken us under their wing and helped
us out... we all get along super well and we're really good
friends, so it's definitely going to be emotional for us."
She may lack the experience of phenoms like Pohlen
and Pedersen, but Kokenis has managed to work her way
into Stanford's lineup and make some serious contribu
tions this season. The Oak Brook, 111. native has averaged

Kayla Pedersen (No. 14) and Jeanette Pohlen (No. 23) will be two of five seniors honored
on Thursday's Senior Night against Cal in the last Pac-10 regular season game.

over 17 minutes per game in her
rookie season, and since recovering
from a minor head injury last
month, Kokenis has become a sta
ple of Stanford's score sheets with
7.9 points and 1.00 steals per game,
63.2 percent shooting from the
field, a 46.2 percent clip from be
yond the arc and 9-for-10 shooting
from the charity stripe. Kokenis
posted six steals across Stanford's
last three games, each of which saw
her break into double-digit point
totals.
"I'm definitely trying to bring
more energy off the bench and
make our pace go a little bit faster,"
Kokenis said about her recent con
tributions. "I want to speed up the
tempo a little bit by definitely pick
ing up the defense and pushing the
ball, getting it out of my lane so we
can get some fast-break opportuni
ties and speed the game up."
That speed has been one of Ko
kenis' unique additions to a power
heavy Stanford roster. Against
Oregon State last Thursday, she
sparked a number of fast breaks
and fired up the crowd with cross
court runs to the basket.
She also impressed in Stanford's
first game against Cal, scoring 12
points on 4-for-7 shooting in a 78-45
victory in early January.
After a solid start, the Golden
Bears have struggled mightily in
the back half of the conference sea
son, plummeting into a six-game
losing streak that they just snapped
with a 58-49, come-from-behind
victory over the visiting Oregon
State Beavers. Sophomore forward
DeNesha Stallworth Cal's lead
ing scorer at 14.5 points and 6.7 re

bounds per game posted nine
points on clutch second-half shoot
ing.
Rachelle Federico scored a ca
reer-high 15 points from the guard
position a fine performance for
the four-year veteran on Cal's Se
nior Night. It was her last game at
Haas Pavilion, but Federico was
making her first career start
given her performance, her second
may come against the Cardinal.
After snapping the prolonged
losing streak, Federico says her
team's confidence is ramping back
up.
"There was some sort of vibe
that we had," she said. "Cal basket
ball was back ... A sense of pride
kicked in. For whatever reason it
was, we were able to get back to Cal
basketball."
With a postseason berth secured
and the Final Four only a month
away, it might be easy for Stanford
to see tonight's matchup as a step
ping stone a final chance to pre
pare for single-elimination play.
Kokenis acknowledges that a
game like this can provide a tune
up before the Big Dance, but says
the team needs to focus on funda
mentals and coming away with a
win.
"Cal's definitely an aggressive
team, so it's good for us to be play
ing against them since they pres
sure so much, that's something
we've definitely been working on,"
Kokenis said. "But's really it's just
taking care of the ba11... and mak
ing sure we know what we're doing
on each possession and getting
good shots."
Stanford will tip off with Cal at 8
p.m. tonight in Maples Pavilion. A
ceremony for the team's senior
class will follow the game.
