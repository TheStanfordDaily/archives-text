## JUST ONE MORE Back-to-back perfect Pac-10 records in sight 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Just one more win.
That's all it will take for the Stanford women to com
plete their second perfect Pac-10 season in as many years,
as they close out conference play by hosting rival Cal
tonight. For a team that's made a habit of running away
with conference titles and setting records for win streaks, a
perfect season sure doesn't seem like much.
No. 2 Stanford (26-2,17-0 Pac-10) clinched its 11th con
secutive regular season Pac-10 championship last Saturday
with a 99-60 rout of

Oregon, a win that ex
tended the program's
best-ever home winning
streak to 61 games. The
team has won every
game in Maples Pavil
ion since beating San
Francisco, 96-61, on
Nov. 28,2007.
Tonight's matchup
with Cal (15-13, 7-10)
also marks the team's
annual Senior Night,
where guards Jeanette
Pohlen, Melanie Mur
phy and Hannah Don
aghe will be honored
along with forwards
Kayla Pedersen and
Ashley Cimino. Other
than the redshirt Mur
phy, Stanford's senior
class is per3fect at
Maples and has ended
every year with a Final
Four appearance
with one more, it would
set a Stanford record.
"Our senior class is

amazing, and me along with everyone else is going to miss
them so much," said freshman guard Toni Kokenis.
"They've definitely taken us under their wing and helped
us out... we all get along super well and we're really good
friends, so it's definitely going to be emotional for us."
She may lack the experience of phenoms like Pohlen
and Pedersen, but Kokenis has managed to work her way
into Stanford's lineup and make some serious contribu
tions this season. The Oak Brook, 111. native has averaged
