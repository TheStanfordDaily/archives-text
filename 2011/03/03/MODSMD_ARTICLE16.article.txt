# WIN STREAK ON THE LINE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volley
ball team embarks on yet anoth
er MPSF road trip this weekend
through Southern California,
this time to face UC-Irvine and
UC-San Diego in a two-game
series that begins Friday night in
Irvine.
The Cardinal (13-4, 9-4
MPSF) moved up a spot, to No. 3,
in the American Volleyball
Coaches Association rankings
with their third straight win last
weekend, a five-set thriller over
then-No. 3 UC-Santa Barbara. It
also marked Stanford's third
three-game winning streak of the
season.
If Stanford is to build on its re
cent momentum, it can't afford a
letdown against the Anteaters on
the road. The last time the Cardi
nal had a three-game win streak,
it was swept in a shocking home
loss to UC-San Diego in mid-

February.
"We finally got our 2-0 week
end, I'm really happy with the
way we played and battled
against a good [Santa Barbara]
team," said head coach John

Kosty. "I don't think we'll have a
problem getting ready for the
[lrvine] game."
Irvine gave the Cardinal just
about all it could handle in the
last meeting between the teams
on Feb. 12. Stanford took the first
set, hitting a robust .419 as a team
with just three attack errors, but
saw its offense stall in the second
and third sets, hitting just .182
and .061 as a team.
Junior outside hitter Brad
Lawson shouldered much of the
load, as the Cardinal roared back
and took the fourth set to extend
the match with a game-high 23
kills and just four errors for a .442
hitting percentage. Senior out
side hitter Spencer McLachlin
rebounded from his struggles
early in the match to notch 13
kills across the fourth and fifth
sets while hitting .550.
The match against the
Anteaters has plenty of postsea

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks for its fourth

tough challenge this weekend against MPSF rivals UC-Santa Barbara and UC-San Diego.
son implications, as No. 7 Irvine is
just one game back of Stanford in
the loss column at 7-5. The Cardinal
is currently third, half a game behind
BYU and two games back of confer
ence-leading USC with nine MPSF
matches remaining.

The first round of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Tourna
ment begins on April 23, and the
Cardinal seems almost assured of a
spot in the tournament as one of

the top eight finishers in confer
ence play.
It's hard to imagine that the Car
dinal would repeat its last perform
ance against the Toreros, when the
team hit .182 with 23 attack errors on
just 99 swings in the 3-0 loss. There
weren't many bright spots, even
though freshman outside hitter
Brian Cook did tally 12 kills and
McLachlin had 11.
Normally reliable junior libero
Erik Shoji was also off his game, with
just three digs to his name, well
below his season average of 2.31 digs
per set, the ninth-best average in the
country.
After this weekend's matches,

Stanford will have a mandatory two
week layoff for Dead Week and fi
nals, before resuming play on Satur
day, March 19 in a non-conference
match against California Baptist at
Burnham Pavilion.
The Cardinal will be hard
pressed to get back into the swing of
things before jumping right back
into MPSF play against Cal State
Northridge and Long Beach State at
home the next weekend.
Stanford kicks off the weekend
against the UC-Irvine Anteaters at
Crawford Hall at 7 p.m. Friday night.
