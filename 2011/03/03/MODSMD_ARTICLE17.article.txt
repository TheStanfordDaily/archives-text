# How do we define success?

Stanford men's basketball
has one more regular-sea
son game left. After the
team squeaked out a win
Tuesday night, the Cardinal
sits at 15-14. With the NCAA Tourna
ment out of reach (barring a miracu
lous Pac-10 Tournament victory) and
the NIT likely to pass on Stanford as
well, the question has to be asked: was
this a successful season?
There can be arguments on both
sides, and it all really boils down to an
ever-more difficult question to an
swer: what is a successful season for a
team like Stanford?
This is a question that most Stan
ford teams don't have to answer.
Women's basketball can be a top-five
team all season, but if it doesn't at
least reach the Final Four, this season
will be a disappointment. Both gym
nastics teams and tennis teams ex
pect to be contending for national ti
tles, so an early postseason exit
not to mention missing the postsea
son entirely would be disastrous.
On the flipside, the wrestling team
has never won a conference or na
tional title, so just finishing in the top
half of the conference can be seen as
somewhat of a success.
People often look at the teams at
the top of each sport when thinking
about a "successful" season, and
teams that greatly improved or dis
appointed compared to preseason
expectations. The majority of teams,
though, fall into a somewhat nebu
lous middle ground between success
and failure, and only fans of these
particular teams pay close attention
to assessing the end result.
It is this category where Stanford
men's basketball finds itself. The
team is flirting with a .500 record and
a sub-,500 Pac-10 record. The Cardi
nal is coming off a 28-8 season in
2007-08, a 20-14 season in 2008-09
and a 14-18 season last year, but it is
somewhat hard to compare each of
those teams.
The team three years ago reached
the Sweet 16 and was led by the
Lopez twins and head coach Trent
Johnson. All three of them left after
that season, along with three seniors,
so the 'OB-'O9 team was all about re
building under new head coach John
ny Dawkins. That team got off to a
fast start, winning its first 10 games
during a very easy non-conference
slate. Once Pac-10 season rolled
around, though, the Cardinal re
gressed, going 6-12 in conference
play. The non-conference success was
enough to get Stanford into the Col
lege Basketball Invitational, where
the Cardinal won two games before
being ousted by Pac-10 foe Oregon
State in overtime of the semifinal.
After that season, Stanford lost
four key contributors Lawrence
Hill, Anthony Goods, Mitch Johnson
and Kenny Brown to graduation,
so the burden last year fell squarely
on the shoulders of Landry Fields.
Fields responded, reaching double
figures in points in all 32 of the Cardi
nal's games and rising from a relative
unknown to an NBA draft pick, but
the team around him was young and
inexperienced. Stanford finished
below .500 and missed the postseason
entirely for the first time in 17 years,
but the team actually improved its
Pac-10 record by one game, which is
surprising considering the team was
picked to finish last in the conference.
TTtat brings us to this year. The
Cardinal lost Fields to graduation,
leaving the team with large shoes to
fill and no seniors on the team to fill
them. Instead, Stanford brought in a
highly touted group of freshmen and
plugged them in along with the re
turning role-players. Jeremy Green,
who was the Cardinal's second op
tion when Fields was around, was ex
pected to take the lead role, and Josh
Owens returned from a medical ab
sence to give the team more physical
ity down low.
Stanford was picked to finish
ninth in the conference, and current
ly sits in eighth with one game to play.
The Cardinal has lost most of the
games it should lose (at Butler, at Ok
lahoma State, etc.), won most of the
games it should win (vs. North Car
olina A&T, vs. Yale, etc.) and pulled a
few surprises both ways (beating
Washington but losing to Oregon at
home). All in all, though, the record

stands about where most people ex
pected it to: around .500 overall and
a touch below .500 in Pac-10 play.
Apart from just the wins and loss
es, the product on the court has been
everything you would expect from
this team. The returners have shown
some ability to take over games (see
Green's 7-for-7 start on Tuesday
night and Owens' 31 points and 11
rebounds last weekend) and some
ability to fall flat on their faces (see
Jarrett Mann's one point and six
turnovers against Seattle University
and Owens' 3-for-11, two-rebound
performance against Oregon State).
For as up-and-down as the juniors
have been, the freshmen have been
even more volatile, which is every
thing you expect from teenagers
thrust into big-time roles on a Pac-10
team. A starter most of the year,
Dwight Powell has had performances
befitting his athleticism, notching two

double-doubles and as many as 20
points in a game, but he has also been
held to five points or fewer nine times
this season and has looked visibly
frustrated on the court more than
once, Anthony Brown has been a
starter for the past month and a half,
scoring 21 points on two separate oc
casions and giving glimpses of elite
talent, but he has also disappeared at
crucial times (three points total in 51
minutes in home games against the
Arizona schools). Aaron Bright, John
Gage and Josh Huestis have also had
significant ups and downs in their first
season on the Farm, and all have
given signs of future promise.
That promise could be the key
take-away point from this year, be
cause the 2010-11 campaign can't be
labeled as a major success or failure.
Instead, this season was almost an
extended introduction to the team
we'll see for years to come.
And in that sense, this season was
successful.
