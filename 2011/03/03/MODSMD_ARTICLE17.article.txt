# How do we define success?

Stanford men's basketball
has one more regular-sea
son game left. After the
team squeaked out a win
Tuesday night, the Cardinal
sits at 15-14. With the NCAA Tourna
ment out of reach (barring a miracu
lous Pac-10 Tournament victory) and
the NIT likely to pass on Stanford as
well, the question has to be asked: was
this a successful season?
There can be arguments on both
sides, and it all really boils down to an
ever-more difficult question to an
swer: what is a successful season for a
team like Stanford?
This is a question that most Stan
ford teams don't have to answer.
Women's basketball can be a top-five
team all season, but if it doesn't at
least reach the Final Four, this season
will be a disappointment. Both gym
nastics teams and tennis teams ex
pect to be contending for national ti
tles, so an early postseason exit
not to mention missing the postsea
son entirely would be disastrous.
On the flipside, the wrestling team
has never won a conference or na
tional title, so just finishing in the top
half of the conference can be seen as
somewhat of a success.
People often look at the teams at
the top of each sport when thinking
about a "successful" season, and
teams that greatly improved or dis
appointed compared to preseason
expectations. The majority of teams,
though, fall into a somewhat nebu
lous middle ground between success
and failure, and only fans of these
particular teams pay close attention
to assessing the end result.
It is this category where Stanford
men's basketball finds itself. The
team is flirting with a .500 record and
a sub-,500 Pac-10 record. The Cardi
nal is coming off a 28-8 season in
2007-08, a 20-14 season in 2008-09
and a 14-18 season last year, but it is
somewhat hard to compare each of
those teams.
The team three years ago reached
the Sweet 16 and was led by the
Lopez twins and head coach Trent
Johnson. All three of them left after
that season, along with three seniors,
so the 'OB-'O9 team was all about re
building under new head coach John
ny Dawkins. That team got off to a
fast start, winning its first 10 games
during a very easy non-conference
slate. Once Pac-10 season rolled
around, though, the Cardinal re
gressed, going 6-12 in conference
play. The non-conference success was
enough to get Stanford into the Col
lege Basketball Invitational, where
the Cardinal won two games before
being ousted by Pac-10 foe Oregon
State in overtime of the semifinal.
After that season, Stanford lost
four key contributors Lawrence
Hill, Anthony Goods, Mitch Johnson
and Kenny Brown to graduation,
so the burden last year fell squarely
on the shoulders of Landry Fields.
Fields responded, reaching double
figures in points in all 32 of the Cardi
nal's games and rising from a relative
unknown to an NBA draft pick, but
the team around him was young and
inexperienced. Stanford finished
below .500 and missed the postseason
entirely for the first time in 17 years,
but the team actually improved its
Pac-10 record by one game, which is
surprising considering the team was
picked to finish last in the conference.
TTtat brings us to this year. The
Cardinal lost Fields to graduation,
leaving the team with large shoes to
fill and no seniors on the team to fill
them. Instead, Stanford brought in a
highly touted group of freshmen and
plugged them in along with the re
turning role-players. Jeremy Green,
who was the Cardinal's second op
tion when Fields was around, was ex
pected to take the lead role, and Josh
Owens returned from a medical ab
sence to give the team more physical
ity down low.
Stanford was picked to finish
ninth in the conference, and current
ly sits in eighth with one game to play.
The Cardinal has lost most of the
games it should lose (at Butler, at Ok
lahoma State, etc.), won most of the
games it should win (vs. North Car
olina A&T, vs. Yale, etc.) and pulled a
few surprises both ways (beating
Washington but losing to Oregon at
home). All in all, though, the record
