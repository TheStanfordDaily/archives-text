## FAO to remain unaffected by Pell Grant cuts Admins will rely on other sources to cover gaps from lower gov't funds 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Federal funding for Pell Grants may de
crease significantly if the Senate also passes
the F1.R.l bill recently passed by the House of
Representatives. Stanford's Financial Aid
Office is confident that these proposed cuts, if
enacted, would have a limited impact on the
University's need-based financial aid policy.
The Pell Grant program helps low- to mid
dle-income undergraduates pay for college
and also provides funding for working low-in
come adults who want to return to school to
specialize in certain interests and skills.
Under the proposed H.R.I bill, the Pell
Grant program could face a 24 percent reduc
tion, totaling $5.7 billion, which leaves each
student with $4,015 instead of $4,860 in grant
money.
According to the Center on Budget Poli
cies and Priorities (CBPP), one of the coun
try's leading policy organizations on legisla
tion affecting low-income families, H.R.l's
stipulations could be detrimental to the de
mographic they affect.
The Pell Grant is unique in that it consists
of two different types of funding, mandatory
and discretionary. The former is a legal guar
antee that each student will receive $690 an
nually to help finance his or her education.
But the bulk of Pell Grants are funded by dis
cretionary means; an annual appropriation
bill essentially allows the government to
spend money to support these grants.
Cuts are, "for the most part, directed at the
latter. However, the CBPP claims that H.R.I
threatens to eliminate the mandatory compo
nent altogether by 2014.
"Proponents of cuts in assistance to lower
income individuals and families often claim
that America should strive to achieve equali
ty in opportunities rather than equality in
outcomes," according to the CBPP website,
"Cuts in programs like this, which help pro
vide improved opportunities for success in
school and work to otherwise-qualified dis
advantaged young people, make a mockery
of such claims."
According to CBPP research, downsizing
the discretionary awards could lead to $64 bil
lion in cuts in mandatory funding for Pell
Grants in the next 10 years.
Representatives for the CBPP declined to
comment to The Daily on the issue.
Stanford's director of financial aid, Karen
Cooper, does not believe the decision on Pell
Grants will have a significant effect on the
University's financial aid policies.
"The Pell Grant program is very helpful to
us and makes a difference in our overall
budget," Cooper said. "If it's a short-term
change, we should be able to absorb that with
institutional funds ... in the long run we may
need to expect a little bit more of all of our
students before we take in Stanford scholar
ship funds."
Each Stanford student's total financial aid
award is determined by calculating both par
ent and student contributions as well as
awards and scholarships that make up the dif
ference. Cooper indicated that cuts to the Pell
Grant program might require increased stu
dent loans.
Still, Cooper remains optimistic.
"For the last four or five years, we've been
expanding our financial aid pool, even during
the economic recession," she said.
"Even though endowment has re
duced, the University remains com
mitted to need-based financial aid.
Money gets taken away from other
things to keep our financial aid pro
gram whole."
Cooper indicated that programs

like The Stanford Fund (TSF) have
been helpful in bridging financial aid
gaps. In the past, about half of the
money from TSF has gone to provid
ing scholarships. This year, the num
ber increased to 75 percent due to a
decline in endowment funds.

"Stanford re-prioritizes funding
to make sure the University meets
the expectations of its students,"
Cooper said.
