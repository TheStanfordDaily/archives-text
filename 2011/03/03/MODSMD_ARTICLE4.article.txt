# Case brought against ASSU ROTC bill
## SSQL presidents petition questions constitutionality of advisory bill 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, president of Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation (SSQL), filed a petition to
bring a case against the ASSU with the Constitution
al Council, which was approved this week. Constitu
tional Council case W2Oll-1, Vaid-Menon v. Cardona,
will determine the constitutionality of a bill passed by
the Undergraduate Senate to place an "advisory ref
erendum" question on the spring elections ballot,
which is intended to gauge student opinion regarding
ROTC.
The Constitutional Council is the judicial branch
of the ASSU, but Vaid-Menon's case will be the first
the body has heard in over one year. However, the
Senate recently passed a bill redefining some of the
roles of the Constitutional Council and of the solici
tors general so that both can become more active
bodies.
According to Constitutional Council Chair Samir
Siddhanti 'l2, before the Council's Rules of Order
were passed two weeks ago, "there was no framework
for how to accept or try to a case,"
Siddhanti said that Vaid-Menon's petition was
filed late Sunday evening, and both parties were noti
fied by Tuesday. He said that given the new rules, the
five-member Council hopes to set a precedent by hav
ing a quick turnaround for trials.
"This is the very first trial we've gotten since the
new group was brought in," he said,
"but that's what we would like to
do, especially given the time sensi
tive nature of this case."
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll authored the bill to place
an "advisory referendum" question
on the general elections ballot ask
ing student opinion on the poten
tial for ROTC to return to campus.

Both the Senate and the Graduate
Student Council voted to pass the
bill at the beginning of February.
At the time, Cardona said that
Vaid-Menon was consulted on the
drafting of the language of the bill so
that it could be presented with "neu
tral language." In an interview with
The Daily, Vaid-Menon said that de
spite consultation, he was "frustrat
ed by the passing of the bill."
"In no way did I ever give my
complete acceptance of this bill,"
he said. "This is away for me to ad
dress my concerns."
For Vaid-Menon, asking for stu

dent opinion by voting on support
for the ROTC issue is like "putting
civil rights on the ballot box."
Vaid-Menon and SSQL oppose
the return of ROTC to Stanford
because it does not allow transgen
der students to participate.
"It frames ROTC as a question
and not as a policy," he said. "The
University is very firm in its non
discrimination policy, which in
cludes gender identity. It seems
generally silly to have a question
that violates this University policy."
Siddhanti said that the evidence
required to prove constitutionality
of an ASSU bill or action varies
from case to case.
"Most of the arguments are
[ASSU] constitutionally based, and
the petitioner argues why or why
not there's a violation, and in some
cases people can bring witnesses,"
he said. "It's pretty much anything
allowed in real court."
"There's also a segment for
friends of the court to be heard,"
Siddhanti added. "We want to
make the process much more trans
parent and open to the public."
Cardona said that she was "not
surprised" to hear about the case.
She said that she recommended the
Constitutional Council as an av
enue for Vaid-Menon to explore
when he initially voiced concerns
over the bill.
"When I showed [Vaid-Menon]
the original draft, he had concerns
about the bill in and of itself," Car
dona said.
"Situations like this is why the
Constitutional Council exists and so
I think that the trial will be good and
the process will be an educational
one for everyone," she added.
Vaid-Menon argues that it is the
responsibility of the ASSU to up
hold University policies in addition
to its own, including the non-dis
crimination policy.
"There's this rhetoric for its still
okay for people to vote and have a
say on civil rights of other people,"

he said. "We need to consider the
ethics of voting on this bill."
Although Vaid-Menon filed the
petition as an individual, he said
that his effort to aid SSQL's oppo
sition to ROTC means that his ac
tions can be interpreted as on be
half of the group.
"I think, from my perspective,
the distinguishing factor that does
n't make the bill unconstitutional is
that it's a non-binding referendum,
equitable to other avenues of input
that the ad hoc committee has wel
comed," Cardona said. "That's def
initely within my bounds as presi
dent to have proposed and I still
support [the bill]."
"That being said, I do under
stand where [Vaid-Menon] is com
ing from and want to do everything
I can to support and represent the
transgender community as well."

Both Vaid-Menon and Cardona
recognize that ultimately, the deci
sion to recognize ROTC will be
made by the Faculty Senate after
receiving the report from the ad
hoc committee in May.
"I don't see this as that big of a
deal, to be honest, because at the
end of the day, people understand
that the students themselves aren't
making this decision," Vaid-Menon
said. "This is much more of a sym
bolic campaign, and it's time for
students to hold the University ac
countable."
"I hope the rhetoric behind this
case doesn't dwindle down to
ROTC: should it return or should it
not, because that's not what this
case is about," Cardona said. "The
question this case is focusing on is
whether or not posing an advisory
question to the campus community
is constitutional or not."
The trial will be next Wednes
day, March 9, at 8 p.m. and open to
the public. The location has not yet
been determined.

filed late Sunday evening, and both parties were noti
fied by Tuesday. He said that given the new rules, the
five-member Council hopes to set a precedent by hav
ing a quick turnaround for trials.
"This is the very first trial we've gotten since the
new group was brought in," he said,
"but that's what we would like to
do, especially given the time sensi
tive nature of this case."
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll authored the bill to place
an "advisory referendum" question
on the general elections ballot ask
ing student opinion on the poten
tial for ROTC to return to campus.

Both the Senate and the Graduate
Student Council voted to pass the
bill at the beginning of February.
At the time, Cardona said that
Vaid-Menon was consulted on the
drafting of the language of the bill so
that it could be presented with "neu
tral language." In an interview with
The Daily, Vaid-Menon said that de
spite consultation, he was "frustrat
ed by the passing of the bill."
"In no way did I ever give my
complete acceptance of this bill,"
he said. "This is away for me to ad
dress my concerns."
For Vaid-Menon, asking for stu

dent opinion by voting on support
for the ROTC issue is like "putting
civil rights on the ballot box."
Vaid-Menon and SSQL oppose
the return of ROTC to Stanford
because it does not allow transgen
der students to participate.
"It frames ROTC as a question
and not as a policy," he said. "The
University is very firm in its non
discrimination policy, which in
cludes gender identity. It seems
generally silly to have a question
that violates this University policy."
Siddhanti said that the evidence
required to prove constitutionality
of an ASSU bill or action varies
from case to case.
"Most of the arguments are
[ASSU] constitutionally based, and
the petitioner argues why or why
not there's a violation, and in some
cases people can bring witnesses,"
he said. "It's pretty much anything
allowed in real court."
"There's also a segment for
friends of the court to be heard,"
Siddhanti added. "We want to
make the process much more trans
parent and open to the public."
Cardona said that she was "not
surprised" to hear about the case.
She said that she recommended the
Constitutional Council as an av
enue for Vaid-Menon to explore
when he initially voiced concerns
over the bill.
"When I showed [Vaid-Menon]
the original draft, he had concerns
about the bill in and of itself," Car
dona said.
"Situations like this is why the
Constitutional Council exists and so
I think that the trial will be good and
the process will be an educational
one for everyone," she added.
Vaid-Menon argues that it is the
responsibility of the ASSU to up
hold University policies in addition
to its own, including the non-dis
crimination policy.
"There's this rhetoric for its still
okay for people to vote and have a
say on civil rights of other people,"

he said. "We need to consider the
ethics of voting on this bill."
Although Vaid-Menon filed the
petition as an individual, he said
that his effort to aid SSQL's oppo
sition to ROTC means that his ac
tions can be interpreted as on be
half of the group.
"I think, from my perspective,
the distinguishing factor that does
n't make the bill unconstitutional is
that it's a non-binding referendum,
equitable to other avenues of input
that the ad hoc committee has wel
comed," Cardona said. "That's def
initely within my bounds as presi
dent to have proposed and I still
support [the bill]."
"That being said, I do under
stand where [Vaid-Menon] is com
ing from and want to do everything
I can to support and represent the
transgender community as well."

Both Vaid-Menon and Cardona
recognize that ultimately, the deci
sion to recognize ROTC will be
made by the Faculty Senate after
receiving the report from the ad
hoc committee in May.
"I don't see this as that big of a
deal, to be honest, because at the
end of the day, people understand
that the students themselves aren't
making this decision," Vaid-Menon
said. "This is much more of a sym
bolic campaign, and it's time for
students to hold the University ac
countable."
"I hope the rhetoric behind this
case doesn't dwindle down to
ROTC: should it return or should it
not, because that's not what this
case is about," Cardona said. "The
question this case is focusing on is
whether or not posing an advisory
question to the campus community
is constitutional or not."
The trial will be next Wednes
day, March 9, at 8 p.m. and open to
the public. The location has not yet
been determined.

Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, president of Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation (SSQL), filed a petition to
bring a case against the ASSU with the Constitution
al Council, which was approved this week. Constitu
tional Council case W2Oll-1, Vaid-Menon v. Cardona,
will determine the constitutionality of a bill passed by
the Undergraduate Senate to place an "advisory ref
erendum" question on the spring elections ballot,
which is intended to gauge student opinion regarding
ROTC.
The Constitutional Council is the judicial branch
of the ASSU, but Vaid-Menon's case will be the first
the body has heard in over one year. However, the
Senate recently passed a bill redefining some of the
roles of the Constitutional Council and of the solici
tors general so that both can become more active
bodies.
According to Constitutional Council Chair Samir
Siddhanti 'l2, before the Council's Rules of Order
were passed two weeks ago, "there was no framework
for how to accept or try to a case,"
Siddhanti said that Vaid-Menon's petition was
filed late Sunday evening, and both parties were noti
fied by Tuesday. He said that given the new rules, the
five-member Council hopes to set a precedent by hav
ing a quick turnaround for trials.
