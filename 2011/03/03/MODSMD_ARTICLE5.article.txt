## Crime metaphors sway public opinion 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to crime, one word may be
enough to sway people's perceptions.
This finding came from the Stanford study
"Metaphors We Think With: The Role of
Metaphor in Reasoning," published in the Feb.
23 edition of PloS ONE. The study shows that
people are more likely to support harsher laws
and increased jailing of offenders when told
crime is a "beast" preying on a community.
When crime is described as a "virus" infecting a
city, however, people are more likely to propose
social reform.
First-year psychology graduate student Paul
Thibodeau, the study's lead author, said the re
sults demonstrate the powerful influence of
metaphor in shaping solutions to complex
problems.
"Things like crime and other difficult social
issues are very abstract and complicated," he
said. "It's hard to think clearly about how to
solve the issue. Metaphors about crime are a lit
tle easier to talk about. When we use metaphors
for crime, we import structures from other do
mains."
In a series of five experiments, participants
were given one of two versions of a report on
rising crime rates in the fictional city of Addi
son. The versions framed crime either as a
"beast" or a "virus" but offered identical statis
tics detailing the rise. Participants were then
asked to propose solutions to the crime.
Researchers found that the subjects' re
sponses varied depending on the metaphor

used. In one study, 71 percent of subjects pro
posed more law enforcement when told crime
was a "beast," compared to 54 percent of sub
jects who did so after reading crime was a
"virus."
When asked to cite the most influential part
of the report, only 15 of the 485 participants se
lected the metaphor; the majority said the sta

tistics held the most sway in determining their
policy decisions.
Psychology assistant professor Lera
Boroditsky, who co-authored the study, said
these findings show the extent to which people
underestimate the role of language in decision-

making.
"These studies show the power of
language in framing our decisions,
especially in cases where we don't
realize it," she said. "We all like to
think we make rational decisions,
but even a single word can bring a
whole knowledge structure that
guides our reasoning."
The study also accounted for po
litical party affiliation, with Republi
cans being 10 percent more likely
than Democrats to suggest enforce
ment-based solutions. Subjects who
read that crime was a "beast" were
about 20 percent more likely to sup
port such solutions, regardless of af
filiation.
Law professor Robert Weisberg
said the study reveals how crime rhet
oric itself has become a metaphor for
political and social unease.
"Crime enters political discourse
in away where it substitutes for
other issues," he said. "It's a good
metaphoric issue for people express
ing their anger or frustration at other
things."
Since crime is an inherently
loaded topic, policy makers and pub
lic officials should ensure the lan
guage used to describe it does not
unduly inflame passions, Weisberg
said.
"Colorful language is not always
accurate," he said. "We have a huge
apparatus of criminal justice in the
United States and we want to see if it
is solving problems efficiently. It is
not a military machine or something
out of a sci-fi movie ... neutralizing
the language with which crime is dis
cussed would be a good thing."
Thibodeau cautions, however,
that language is just one of many fac
tors that influence people's opinions
on crime and other issues.
"It worked pretty well when we
gave people a report on crime and
they didn't have background con
text," he said. "In the real world, peo
ple have more information. All
things being equal, subtle metaphor
ic clues can help us structure how we
think about abstract and complex is
sues."
