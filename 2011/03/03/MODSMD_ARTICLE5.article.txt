## Crime metaphors sway public opinion 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to crime, one word may be
enough to sway people's perceptions.
This finding came from the Stanford study
"Metaphors We Think With: The Role of
Metaphor in Reasoning," published in the Feb.
23 edition of PloS ONE. The study shows that
people are more likely to support harsher laws
and increased jailing of offenders when told
crime is a "beast" preying on a community.
When crime is described as a "virus" infecting a
city, however, people are more likely to propose
social reform.
First-year psychology graduate student Paul
Thibodeau, the study's lead author, said the re
sults demonstrate the powerful influence of
metaphor in shaping solutions to complex
problems.
"Things like crime and other difficult social
issues are very abstract and complicated," he
said. "It's hard to think clearly about how to
solve the issue. Metaphors about crime are a lit
tle easier to talk about. When we use metaphors
for crime, we import structures from other do
mains."
In a series of five experiments, participants
were given one of two versions of a report on
rising crime rates in the fictional city of Addi
son. The versions framed crime either as a
"beast" or a "virus" but offered identical statis
tics detailing the rise. Participants were then
asked to propose solutions to the crime.
Researchers found that the subjects' re
sponses varied depending on the metaphor

used. In one study, 71 percent of subjects pro
posed more law enforcement when told crime
was a "beast," compared to 54 percent of sub
jects who did so after reading crime was a
"virus."
When asked to cite the most influential part
of the report, only 15 of the 485 participants se
lected the metaphor; the majority said the sta

tistics held the most sway in determining their
policy decisions.
Psychology assistant professor Lera
Boroditsky, who co-authored the study, said
these findings show the extent to which people
underestimate the role of language in decision-
