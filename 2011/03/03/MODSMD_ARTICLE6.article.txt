## Study finds new breakthrough for lethal brain tumor 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Scientists at the School of Medicine
have created an animal model of a rare
and fatal brain tumor affecting young
children. This model is the first of its
kind and will allow scientists to better
study Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine
Glioma (DIGP), a disease that is fatal
for nearly all children who are diag

nosed, according to a paper published
in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Led by pediatric neurologist
Michelle Monje, the team found that
these models could be made by inject
ing human DIGP cells, donated by the
parents of deceased patients, directly
into mice. Using this model, the team
found new molecular signals that
prompt the cancer to grow.

"In a mouse, that population of cells
is responsive to the Hedgehog path
way, a signaling pathway important in
normal development and many forms
of cancer," Monje said. "We tested the
role [of the pathway] by regulating it
genetically, and in mice with regulated
pathways, [... ] cells didn't look as
strange."
These signals could also one day
hold the key to curing the cancer by

acting as signals for anti-tumor drugs.
Monje and her team said they planned
to pursue potential cures.
The animal model represents some
of the biggest advances for this partic
ular disease, where treatment ad
vances have been stagnant for 35
years, Monje said.
Part of the problem is the lack of

available samples.
"The tumor is not biopsied, as
diagnosis can be made radiologi
cally (by MRI) and biopsy is dan
gerous because of the tumor loca
tion," wrote senior author
Philip Beachy, professor of devel
opmental biology, in an e-mail to
Tlie Daily.
Although Monje declined to
give names, she said other research
institutions have attempted to cre
ate samples as well. Stanford, how
ever, is the first in the world to
achieve any success.
DIPG is particularly difficult to
treat because the cancerous cells
entwine themselves with healthy
cells in the brain stem. Since the
brain stem is necessary for the
body's survival, surgery is not an
option.
As a result, Monje's findings
"give a lot of hope," said Danah
Jewett, whose late son, Dylan, was
one of the earliest donors to
Monje's research in January 2009.
"For 35 years, parents were told
that their child was going to die,"
Jewett said.
"These children need it so badly
and their families need it so badly,"
she added.
DIPG, which primarily affects
children ages five through nine, is
one of the more common pediatric
tumors, Monje said. It affects up to
400 children annually in the U.S.
Less than 1 percent of victims live
through the first five years once the
cancer has set.
Six other families have followed
in the Jewett's footsteps and decid
ed to donate their tumor cells,
Monje said.
Her team has also been contact
ed by a number of other re
searchers interested in further
studying the disease.
For their part, Beachy said that
the team has two future studies
lined up: the first on the new tumor
model to determine what kinds of
therapies might be useful, and an
other to understand the possible
cell of origin and changes in nor
mal cell function that cause the tu
mors.
Several pharmaceutical compa
nies are also working to develop
drugs that will treat this cancer.
Monje's new mouse models will
test some of the drugs.
The research was funded in part
by the National Institutes of
Health, the National Brain Tumor
Foundation and the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute.
