## Study finds new breakthrough for lethal brain tumor 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Scientists at the School of Medicine
have created an animal model of a rare
and fatal brain tumor affecting young
children. This model is the first of its
kind and will allow scientists to better
study Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine
Glioma (DIGP), a disease that is fatal
for nearly all children who are diag

nosed, according to a paper published
in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Led by pediatric neurologist
Michelle Monje, the team found that
these models could be made by inject
ing human DIGP cells, donated by the
parents of deceased patients, directly
into mice. Using this model, the team
found new molecular signals that
prompt the cancer to grow.

"In a mouse, that population of cells
is responsive to the Hedgehog path
way, a signaling pathway important in
normal development and many forms
of cancer," Monje said. "We tested the
role [of the pathway] by regulating it
genetically, and in mice with regulated
pathways, [... ] cells didn't look as
strange."
These signals could also one day
hold the key to curing the cancer by

acting as signals for anti-tumor drugs.
Monje and her team said they planned
to pursue potential cures.
The animal model represents some
of the biggest advances for this partic
ular disease, where treatment ad
vances have been stagnant for 35
years, Monje said.
Part of the problem is the lack of
