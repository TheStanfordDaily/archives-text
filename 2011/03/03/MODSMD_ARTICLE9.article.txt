## BEYOND BANDURA'S BOBOS How serendipity flung Albert Bandura into the spotlight as a leading social psychologist 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
With twinkling eyes
and a gently wrin
kled face in a per
petual half-smile,
Albert Bandura
looks every inch the quintessential
kindly grandfather, from the muted
burgundy sweater to the soft lull of
his voice.
Bandura, a man of many talents,
has had a long and illustrious aca
demic career spanning over six
decades. The David Starr Jordan
Professor Emeritus of Social Sci
ence in Psychology, Bandura has
contributed immensely to the field
of social psychology, and is the fa
ther behind the theory of self-effica
cy and social learning theory.
Ranked as the most cited living psy
chologist in the world, Bandura has
authored seven books to date and
has written over 180 articles.
Bandura was born and raised in
Mundare, a small hamlet in northern
Alberta, Canada with a population
of approximately 400 people, mostly
immigrants from Poland and
Ukraine. His elementary and sec
ondary school years at the only
school in town were "very limited in
education resources," recalled Ban
dura. Usually, limited educational
resources would be seen as a hin
drance, but Bandura looks back on
his schooldays as an opportunity for
self-learning, a major skill that is the
center of his social learning theory.
"We pilfered a teacher's
trigonometry book, so that we could

study it ourselves," Bandura said.
"The students had to take charge of
their own education."
Bandura's early resolve for
scholastic success was largely due to
his upbringing because his parents,
though they received no formal edu
cation, placed enormous emphasis
on academic development.
"My mother told me I could till
the land, play pool and drink myself
to oblivion," Bandura said. "Or I
could get an education."
"Needless to say, I chose the lat
ter," Bandura added with a light
hearted chuckle.
Bandura's summers were spent
picking up carpentry, a skill set that
would later help pay for his college
education. One memorable summer
after high school graduation, Ban
dura ventured farther north, where
he worked at Whitehorse in the
Yukon filling in holes along the
Alaskan highway.
Bandura recalled the shock he
received almost immediately upon
his arrival.
"I pulled up to the base camp,
and the first thing I saw was an am
bulance. I asked someone if there
had been an accident, and someone
told me, 'No, that's our cook. He
drank all of the lemon extract for the
alcohol, so we have to take him in to
get his stomach pumped out.'"
The robust, quirky life of the
workers at Whitehorse was an excit
ing time for Bandura, who saw the
Yukon tundra as a backdrop for "the
blossoming of the psychopathology
