## BEYOND BANDURA'S BOBOS How serendipity flung Albert Bandura into the spotlight as a leading social psychologist 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
With twinkling eyes
and a gently wrin
kled face in a per
petual half-smile,
Albert Bandura
looks every inch the quintessential
kindly grandfather, from the muted
burgundy sweater to the soft lull of
his voice.
Bandura, a man of many talents,
has had a long and illustrious aca
demic career spanning over six
decades. The David Starr Jordan
Professor Emeritus of Social Sci
ence in Psychology, Bandura has
contributed immensely to the field
of social psychology, and is the fa
ther behind the theory of self-effica
cy and social learning theory.
Ranked as the most cited living psy
chologist in the world, Bandura has
authored seven books to date and
has written over 180 articles.
Bandura was born and raised in
Mundare, a small hamlet in northern
Alberta, Canada with a population
of approximately 400 people, mostly
immigrants from Poland and
Ukraine. His elementary and sec
ondary school years at the only
school in town were "very limited in
education resources," recalled Ban
dura. Usually, limited educational
resources would be seen as a hin
drance, but Bandura looks back on
his schooldays as an opportunity for
self-learning, a major skill that is the
center of his social learning theory.
"We pilfered a teacher's
trigonometry book, so that we could

study it ourselves," Bandura said.
"The students had to take charge of
their own education."
Bandura's early resolve for
scholastic success was largely due to
his upbringing because his parents,
though they received no formal edu
cation, placed enormous emphasis
on academic development.
"My mother told me I could till
the land, play pool and drink myself
to oblivion," Bandura said. "Or I
could get an education."
"Needless to say, I chose the lat
ter," Bandura added with a light
hearted chuckle.
Bandura's summers were spent
picking up carpentry, a skill set that
would later help pay for his college
education. One memorable summer
after high school graduation, Ban
dura ventured farther north, where
he worked at Whitehorse in the
Yukon filling in holes along the
Alaskan highway.
Bandura recalled the shock he
received almost immediately upon
his arrival.
"I pulled up to the base camp,
and the first thing I saw was an am
bulance. I asked someone if there
had been an accident, and someone
told me, 'No, that's our cook. He
drank all of the lemon extract for the
alcohol, so we have to take him in to
get his stomach pumped out.'"
The robust, quirky life of the
workers at Whitehorse was an excit
ing time for Bandura, who saw the
Yukon tundra as a backdrop for "the
blossoming of the psychopathology

of everyday life."
"Booze was their main nutrient,"
Bandura said. "They were ordering
large quantities of sugar that they
used to brew up. This one morning
they go up early, [to check] on the
deepest alcoholic mash. What they
found there instead was half a dozen
drunken grizzly bears lumbering
around camp. Fortunately, they were
a little too tipsy to actually be really
dangerous."
According to Bandura, fortuity
a factor generally avoided by psy
chologists, who interpret such events
as unpredictable plays a more
important role in shaping people's
lives.
"In psych, we avoid fortuity,"
Bandura said. "Fortuitous events
are just nuisances in our causal theo
ries. I tried to bring some science to
bear on my fortuitous life, and that's
how I got into psych."
It was, in fact, fortuity that led
Bandura to ultimately choose psy
chology as his field of study for his
bachelor's degree at the University
of British Columbia, a decision
largely based on a chance encounter
with a course catalog.
"I had originally planned to major
in biology," Bandura said. "I was with
pre-meds and engineers who had re
ally early schedules. I didn't have
classes that early those were at a
time that I didn't know even existed!
So I had a lot of time. I noticed some
one had left a course catalog. While
flipping through it, there was a psych
course that fit in with my schedule
that I decided to take."
Bandura was hooked on psych.
Making use of his carpentry skills, he
was able to speed through his educa
tion, earning his B.A. in three years
and receiving his M.A. and Ph.D.
from the University of lowa in three
additional years. It was also during
his graduate student years, by anoth
er stroke of luck, that he met his
wife, whom he married in 1952.
"One morning, we were late to
our golf time, so they bumped us to a
later time," Bandura said. "Two
women were ahead of us. They were
slowing down, and we were speed
ing up. I met my wife in the sand trap.
Had we been at the earlier time, our
lives would have never converged."
In 1953, Bandura joined Stan
ford's faculty, where he has re
mained ever since. He has taught
thousands of students and prolifical
ly contributed many research arti
cles and studies involving various as
pects of social psychology. The Bobo

doll study, which looked at the social
patterns of behavior associated with
aggression, is his most well known
piece of research.
"That study always seems to
haunt me," Bandura admitted. "The
great thing about psychology is that
it is the only study that integrates in
terpsychic events, social relations, bi
ology and socio-structural events.
There's no other discipline that inte
grates all of these very different dis
ciplines."
Bandura and his wife, Ginny,
have two daughters, Mary and
Carol, both of whom grew up to fol
low careers within the fields of ei
ther clinical or social psychology.
Over the years, Bandura has be
come an expert at juggling several
roles at once as professor, as fa
ther and more recently, as grandfa
ther.
"He loves his grandchildren,"
said lan Gotlib, also a David Starr
Jordan Professor of Psychology.
"And he appreciates good wine."
Now in the twilight of his career,
Bandura has more time for leisure
activities, which include wine tours,
backpacking in the Sierras and gar
dening.
"I maintain some of my rural
roots," Bandura said. "I have a huge
garden, where I am the major suppli
er of tomatoes, which have been
claimed as 'the golden standard' by
my colleagues."
But Bandura still likes to keep
busy. Instead of settling back into
the comfort of his armchair, basking
in the glow of his numerous achieve
ments, Bandura's back is erect, lean
ing slightly forward toward the fu
ture, while always having a number
of current projects buzzing away.
One of his major current projects is
the application of social learning
theory and the self-efficacy model to
address major concerns on a global
level, such as human rights in devel
oping countries, environmental sus
tainability and the AIDS epidemic.
That's not bad for someone who
stumbled into psychology by fortuity.
Having learned from a lifetime of
serendipity, Bandura believes in max
imizing every chance opportunity.
"You can take [hardships] and
turn them into enabling experi
ences," Bandura said. "You can't af
ford to be a realist. Realists will
abort if they run into difficulties, or
they will become cynical. Learning
how to work through it when en
countering setbacks and conflicts is
a life-long skill, but an important
one for success."

"You don't get bored that way,"
he added.

ence in Psychology, Bandura has
contributed immensely to the field
of social psychology, and is the fa
ther behind the theory of self-effica
cy and social learning theory.
Ranked as the most cited living psy
chologist in the world, Bandura has
authored seven books to date and
has written over 180 articles.
Bandura was born and raised in
Mundare, a small hamlet in northern
Alberta, Canada with a population
of approximately 400 people, mostly
immigrants from Poland and
Ukraine. His elementary and sec
ondary school years at the only
school in town were "very limited in
education resources," recalled Ban
dura. Usually, limited educational
resources would be seen as a hin
drance, but Bandura looks back on
his schooldays as an opportunity for
self-learning, a major skill that is the
center of his social learning theory.
"We pilfered a teacher's
trigonometry book, so that we could

study it ourselves," Bandura said.
"The students had to take charge of
their own education."
Bandura's early resolve for
scholastic success was largely due to
his upbringing because his parents,
though they received no formal edu
cation, placed enormous emphasis
on academic development.
"My mother told me I could till
the land, play pool and drink myself
to oblivion," Bandura said. "Or I
could get an education."
"Needless to say, I chose the lat
ter," Bandura added with a light
hearted chuckle.
Bandura's summers were spent
picking up carpentry, a skill set that
would later help pay for his college
education. One memorable summer
after high school graduation, Ban
dura ventured farther north, where
he worked at Whitehorse in the
Yukon filling in holes along the
Alaskan highway.
Bandura recalled the shock he
received almost immediately upon
his arrival.
"I pulled up to the base camp,
and the first thing I saw was an am
bulance. I asked someone if there
had been an accident, and someone
told me, 'No, that's our cook. He
drank all of the lemon extract for the
alcohol, so we have to take him in to
get his stomach pumped out.'"
The robust, quirky life of the
workers at Whitehorse was an excit
ing time for Bandura, who saw the
Yukon tundra as a backdrop for "the
blossoming of the psychopathology

of everyday life."
"Booze was their main nutrient,"
Bandura said. "They were ordering
large quantities of sugar that they
used to brew up. This one morning
they go up early, [to check] on the
deepest alcoholic mash. What they
found there instead was half a dozen
drunken grizzly bears lumbering
around camp. Fortunately, they were
a little too tipsy to actually be really
dangerous."
According to Bandura, fortuity
a factor generally avoided by psy
chologists, who interpret such events
as unpredictable plays a more
important role in shaping people's
lives.
"In psych, we avoid fortuity,"
Bandura said. "Fortuitous events
are just nuisances in our causal theo
ries. I tried to bring some science to
bear on my fortuitous life, and that's
how I got into psych."
It was, in fact, fortuity that led
Bandura to ultimately choose psy
chology as his field of study for his
bachelor's degree at the University
of British Columbia, a decision
largely based on a chance encounter
with a course catalog.
"I had originally planned to major
in biology," Bandura said. "I was with
pre-meds and engineers who had re
ally early schedules. I didn't have
classes that early those were at a
time that I didn't know even existed!
So I had a lot of time. I noticed some
one had left a course catalog. While
flipping through it, there was a psych
course that fit in with my schedule
that I decided to take."
Bandura was hooked on psych.
Making use of his carpentry skills, he
was able to speed through his educa
tion, earning his B.A. in three years
and receiving his M.A. and Ph.D.
from the University of lowa in three
additional years. It was also during
his graduate student years, by anoth
er stroke of luck, that he met his
wife, whom he married in 1952.
"One morning, we were late to
our golf time, so they bumped us to a
later time," Bandura said. "Two
women were ahead of us. They were
slowing down, and we were speed
ing up. I met my wife in the sand trap.
Had we been at the earlier time, our
lives would have never converged."
In 1953, Bandura joined Stan
ford's faculty, where he has re
mained ever since. He has taught
thousands of students and prolifical
ly contributed many research arti
cles and studies involving various as
pects of social psychology. The Bobo

doll study, which looked at the social
patterns of behavior associated with
aggression, is his most well known
piece of research.
"That study always seems to
haunt me," Bandura admitted. "The
great thing about psychology is that
it is the only study that integrates in
terpsychic events, social relations, bi
ology and socio-structural events.
There's no other discipline that inte
grates all of these very different dis
ciplines."
Bandura and his wife, Ginny,
have two daughters, Mary and
Carol, both of whom grew up to fol
low careers within the fields of ei
ther clinical or social psychology.
Over the years, Bandura has be
come an expert at juggling several
roles at once as professor, as fa
ther and more recently, as grandfa
ther.
"He loves his grandchildren,"
said lan Gotlib, also a David Starr
Jordan Professor of Psychology.
"And he appreciates good wine."
Now in the twilight of his career,
Bandura has more time for leisure
activities, which include wine tours,
backpacking in the Sierras and gar
dening.
"I maintain some of my rural
roots," Bandura said. "I have a huge
garden, where I am the major suppli
er of tomatoes, which have been
claimed as 'the golden standard' by
my colleagues."
But Bandura still likes to keep
busy. Instead of settling back into
the comfort of his armchair, basking
in the glow of his numerous achieve
ments, Bandura's back is erect, lean
ing slightly forward toward the fu
ture, while always having a number
of current projects buzzing away.
One of his major current projects is
the application of social learning
theory and the self-efficacy model to
address major concerns on a global
level, such as human rights in devel
oping countries, environmental sus
tainability and the AIDS epidemic.
That's not bad for someone who
stumbled into psychology by fortuity.
Having learned from a lifetime of
serendipity, Bandura believes in max
imizing every chance opportunity.
"You can take [hardships] and
turn them into enabling experi
ences," Bandura said. "You can't af
ford to be a realist. Realists will
abort if they run into difficulties, or
they will become cynical. Learning
how to work through it when en
countering setbacks and conflicts is
a life-long skill, but an important
one for success."

"You don't get bored that way,"
he added.
