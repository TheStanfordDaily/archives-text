Note: Auto loans available for vehicles 10 years old or newer with less than 80,000 miles, and are contingent upon SFCU receiving a
valid first lien security interest in the vehicle. This offer cannot be combined with other SFCU promotional programs or offers. Offer
ends March 31,2011.
1 Annual Percentage Rate. The payment chart is based on a 3.24% APR (0.008877 daily periodic rate), is a fixed rate and includes a
0.50% APR discount (0.001370 periodic rate) for monthly recurring direct deposit of at least $5OO to your SFCU checking account, a
0.25% APR discount (0.000685 daily periodic rate) for automatic payments via ACFI and a 0.25% APR discount (0.000685 daily
periodic rate) for an applicable service program (i.e. MAP Auto Finder, Drive Green or Premier Checking Discount). Maximum rate
discount is 1.00% APR. Should you decide not to maintain the conditions which qualify you for a special loan rate or if you default
on any loan you have with SFCU, we may, at our option, change the rate charged on all loans pursuant to the loan agreement to
the greater of the non-reduced rates in effect when the loan was funded or to the non-reduced rate in effect on the date the qualifier
service was terminated. When the rate increases, it will increase the number of payments required to pay the balance in full.
Applicants must have proof of income. All loans are subject to credit approval. Rate is based on Applicant's credit profile, model year
of vehicle, term of loan, payment method and collateral, as applicable. The monthly payment may vary based on the loan amount
and term of the loan. Minimum loan amount is $5,000. All rates and terms are subject to change without notice. 2 For refinancing
current auto loans at other financial institutions, loan term and rate may change in order to lower monthly payment. This offer
does not guarantee lower monthly payments. Existing SFCU auto loans are not eligible. 3 Deferment will occur in the first 90 days on
new and used auto loans. 90-day deferment offer is available to qualified borrowers. Offer not available on existing SFCU auto
loans. Interest will accrue during the deferment period and will begin on the day of funding.
