Speak, Memory
In collaboration with the Stanford Institute for Creativity and the
Arts, Stanford Continuing Studies offers you three evenings one
each quarter of dramatic readings, modeled on NPR's popular
"Selected Shorts," featuring writings on and about memory. We
have borrowed the title of our series from Vladimir Nabokov's
luminous memoir, and have recruited accomplished actress Kay
Kostopoulos to direct the programs.
Our Winter program will start with a selection from Nabokov's
gorgeous autobiography, Speak, Memory. The author of more than
forty books, including the epoch-defining Lolita, Pniti, and Pale
Fire, Nabokov wrote an autobiography that is widely regarded as
the most lyrical exploration of memory, rivaled for its nuanced
eloquence only by Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Also on
the program will be a dramatic reading of The Memory of Water
by Shelagh Stephenson.
