# New treatment helps stem cell transplants evade rejection

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown 
Short-term treatment with immune system
suppressing drugs allows human embryonic
stem cells to survive and even prosper in mice,
according to School of Medicine researchers.
The group, led by associate professor Joseph
Wu, published its findings in Cell Stem Cell
yesterday.

Without such an immune-suppressing tech
nique, animals' immune systems recognize the
stem cells as foreign and rapidly eliminate
them. This is a barrier to stem cell transplants
in humans as well.

The recent discovery could allow humans
to accept stem cell transplants without con
stantly having to take immunosuppressant
drugs, which open the doors to infections and
side effects like hypertension and ulcers.
Most current animal and human experi
ments on the viability of transplanted stem
cells study the long-term use of immunosup
pressants. The study, spearheaded by medical
student Jeremy Pearl, took a different ap
proach, looking at a drug class called "co-stim
ulatory receptor blocking agents" that trains
