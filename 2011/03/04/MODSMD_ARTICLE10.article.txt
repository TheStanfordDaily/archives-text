# New treatment helps stem cell transplants evade rejection
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown 
Short-term treatment with immune system
suppressing drugs allows human embryonic
stem cells to survive and even prosper in mice,
according to School of Medicine researchers.
The group, led by associate professor Joseph
Wu, published its findings in Cell Stem Cell
yesterday.

Without such an immune-suppressing tech
nique, animals' immune systems recognize the
stem cells as foreign and rapidly eliminate
them. This is a barrier to stem cell transplants
in humans as well.

The recent discovery could allow humans
to accept stem cell transplants without con
stantly having to take immunosuppressant
drugs, which open the doors to infections and
side effects like hypertension and ulcers.
Most current animal and human experi
ments on the viability of transplanted stem
cells study the long-term use of immunosup
pressants. The study, spearheaded by medical
student Jeremy Pearl, took a different ap
proach, looking at a drug class called "co-stim
ulatory receptor blocking agents" that trains
the immune system to ignore the
transplanted cells.
To test their method, the re
searchers injected embryonic stem
cells from mice into the legs of other
mice with different genetic back
grounds. Researchers found that the
stem cells did very well with spaced
out doses of blocking agents. In the
past, cells died after 28 days with tra
ditional immunosuppressants and
21 with no treatment.
The findings add to the debate
about the relative merits of in
duced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells,
which can be tailored to a patient's
immune system, and embryonic
stem cells. The academic commu
nity has not settled whether iPS
cells, which are derived from skin
cells or other adult cells that nor
mally do not divide into cells of a
different type, can differentiate
into new tissues as well as embry
onic cells. The iPS cells are costly
and time-consuming to produce,
but in theory they allow re
searchers to avoid the ethical

quandaries associated with embry
onic stem cells and, given federal
restrictions, are more available.
The researchers will next experi
ment with a wider variety of drug
concentrations and types and start
testing the technique in larger ani
mals.
