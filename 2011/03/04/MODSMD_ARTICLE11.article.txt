## EDITORIAL ASSU Stipends are Justified 
### 
Each year, as Special Fee peti
tions circulate through e
mail lists with increasing in
tensity in the run-up to the petition
deadline, the issue of ASSU fund
ing and its impact on the student
body becomes a major topic of dis
cussion. The operation of the spe
cial fees system is straightforward:
if a sufficient number of students
approve of a group's budget re
quest, that amount will be divided
up among the population and
charged as a fee. Some believe that
ASSU political operations are sup
ported by the student body, just as
special fees groups are, but that no
tion is incorrect. As election season
approaches, voters must under
stand how and why the ASSU com
pensates some of its leadership.
The Daily reported on this issue
on February 28, with a particular
focus on those positions receiving
the largest stipends. Before dis
cussing whether the stipends are
justified, it is important first to clar
ify the funding process. The ASSU
does not impose any sort of levy on
students to sustain its operations.
Instead, the ASSU maintains an
endowment, separate from that of
the University and managed by
SSE, and it is the payout from this
endowment that funds the ASSU
political budget including the
Executive, Undergraduate Senate,
Graduate Student Council, Nomi
nations Commission, Elections
Commission and more. The budget
is set each year by the outgoing leg
islative bodies, with input from the
Executive; they are free to adjust
line items and even the proportion
of funds going to the different
branches, but must work within the
amount provided by the endow
ment.

bility required by these elected and
non-elected positions. The Execu
tive, in particular, has been trans
formed in recent years into a much
more intensive and time-consum
ing role. The bar was raised initially
by the Dorsey-Harris administra
tion in 2008-2009, which expanded
the Cabinet and made the Execu
tive position a full-time job. Subse
quent Executives followed their
example: all have devoted far more
than 40 hours per week to their
work, and most forego summer
jobs in order to remain on campus
and pursue their agendas. Calculat
ed at an hourly rate, the yearly Ex
ecutive stipend is far below mini
mum wage. The other paid posi
tions, including those for Senate,
GSC and NomCom leadership as
well as the Elections Commission,
are also justified by the time and
energy required not to mention
the fact that all are solid year-long
commitments.

But these stipends serve a pur
pose beyond simply rewarding ded
ication: they encourage and facili
tate participation in student gov
ernment by students with financial
constraints. Those who hold ASSU
leadership positions often give up
outside jobs and other commit
ments in order to fulfill their re
sponsibilities, and the current sys
tem allows those who wish to serve
to do so regardless of their financial
situation.

Not every dollar of the ASSU
budget is used wisely, however, and
some of the Graduate Student
Council spending presents a cause
for concern.The current budget allo
cates $l,OOO for a "Food Czar" (to
bring food to the weekly meetings)
and another $8,500 for "Meeting
Food." It also includes a $6,500 line
item for "Training Orientation."
This stands in stark contrast to the
budget of the Undergraduate Sen
ate, which was trimmed last year and

While some may still argue that
ASSU stipends are too large or al
together unnecessary, it is the view
of this Editorial Board that they
are entirely appropriate for the
level of commitment and responsi-

contains just $l,OOO for orientation
and no funding for food. Overall,
the GSC budget is nearly $lO,OOO
higher than that of the Senate.
As ASSU leaders begin work
on next year's budget, they should
be aware of overspending in areas
such as food and retreats. Such
funds could be used in much more
effective ways, as the legislative
bodies did last year by dramatical
ly increasing the allocation for Ex
ecutive Action Grants. But any
push to reduce ASSU stipends
must be met with skepticism.
These stipends have no negative fi
nancial impact on the student
body, and their existence ensures
that participation in student gov
ernment is open and accessible to
everyone.
