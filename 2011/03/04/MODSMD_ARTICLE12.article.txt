# MARKS MY WORDS
## The 						S-Word: Part 2 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
A couple of weeks ago I de
scribed my annoyance with
the Stanford response
when people hear that you're from
Stanford, they are sometimes quick
to peg you as one of those elitist brats.
Oh, you go to Stanford? Well you're
probably really smart, rich and ob
noxious. Once they decide this, the
person in question may either stop
talking to you or make fun of you.
But there is, of course, an opposite
dimension, the other reaction. Flying
home last Thanksgiving, I overheard
a conversation two rows ahead of
where I sat perusing the gadgets in
the Sky Mall magazine. An elderly
woman struck up a conversation with
the young woman sitting next to her.
"So are you flying home for the
holiday? Oh that's nice. Are you fly
ing from college? Lovely! Where do
you go to college?"

I could not make out the respons
es, only the questions. So I didn't ac
tually hear the girl say "Stanford."
What I heard instead was "OH
WOW,STANFORD?! HOWWON
DERFUL!" I could imagine the girl
squirming in her seat as the exclama
tion lured inquiring glances from
those sitting around her. I double
checked to make sure I wasn't wear
ing any Stanford paraphernalia and,
clad in unmarked clothes, relaxed.
"What an incredible place to be in
college! What a good school! So what
do you study?" By this time, the eld
erly woman had remembered to
speak at a lower decibel. I couldn't
hear the rest of the conversation, but
I mentally thanked the powers that
be that no one had unearthed my
identity and shouted it to the rest of
the airplane as well.

This is the other response, the all
too positive, enthusiastic reaction
when we say "Stanford." And per
haps this is justifiable, for it is an im
pressive word to drop.

Sometimes it can be fantastic.
During winter break of my freshman
year at Stanford, I had Christmas din
ner with my friend and her extended
(very extended) family. My friend at
tends a technical school that is not
Stanford, but her family knew noth
ing about me when we sat down at
the long dining table. As their curios
ity turned to the newcomer, I was
asked where I went to college. When
I said Stanford, I saw two pairs of
jaws drop and the rest of the table
beaming.

Did that make me feel good? Of
course it did! Well, at first. The next
thing I realized was that I was receiv
ing a huge benefit of the doubt.
When some people hear that
you're a Stanford student, they tend
to assume that you will automatically
do great things. If you're a biology
major, you will probably find the cure
to cancer. Are you an engineer?
You'll invent a car that can run on
garbage. Studying computer science?
You'll find away for people to tele
port through their iPods.
Me? I'm a Public Policy major.
The career projections thrown my
way are that I will either be President
of the United States or maybe Secre
tary of Defense, if things don't go
well.

What I suspect people don't al
ways stop and think about is, first of
all, that if every graduating senior in
either Political Science or Public Pol
icy wanted to run for President of the

United States, that alone would
mean several hundred contenders
from the Stanford University Class
of 2011. And that doesn't happen.
With the word Stanford, people
assume that we have lofty goals, huge
aspirations and, often, some level of
genius that will enable us to enact
mind-blowing changes. The reality is
that not all of us have the interest, ca
pability or set of fortuitous circum
stances that will make it possible for
us to fix the U.S. educational system,
invent a more efficient fuel cell or
win a Nobel Peace Prize.
And some students here already

don't feel completely at home. Late
ly there have been a number of stu
dent campaigns, initiatives, and other
efforts to combat feelings of loneli
ness and not belonging at Stanford. 1
recall my freshman year, when I
found out through a dorm-wide ex
ercise that one-third of my peers in
the second-largest freshman dorm
on campus did not feel like they de
served to be at Stanford.

As one of these students, how do
you feel when you encounter the "OH,
Stanford!"response? Yes, Stanford is a
wonderful institution in the eyes of
many others. But when you feel like
you already don't belong, how does it
feel to be confronted by someone
else's assumption that you're among
the imaginary elite of the future?
To lump everyone at Stanford
into the category of future famous

leaders, inventors and entrepreneurs
is, in my opinion, a dangerous gener
alization to make to any Stanford
student. When this is done with a
smirk and a grimace, as my friends
encountered on our weekend in
Vegas, it is blatantly disrespectful.
When it is done with an exclamation
and a beaming smile, as I overheard
on an airplane, it is not an entirely
positive response by default. While
such a response may bear a genuine
feeling of admiration, it also may not
be what the Stanford student sitting
next to you wants to hear.

Miriam is currently developing a cure
for cancer, working on her presiden
tial campaign and designing the
iPhone 7G, but she can probably
spare some time to check her email at
melloram@stanford.edu.

served to be at Stanford.

As one of these students, how do
you feel when you encounter the "OH,
Stanford!"response? Yes, Stanford is a
wonderful institution in the eyes of
many others. But when you feel like
you already don't belong, how does it
feel to be confronted by someone
else's assumption that you're among
the imaginary elite of the future?
To lump everyone at Stanford
into the category of future famous

leaders, inventors and entrepreneurs
is, in my opinion, a dangerous gener
alization to make to any Stanford
student. When this is done with a
smirk and a grimace, as my friends
encountered on our weekend in
Vegas, it is blatantly disrespectful.
When it is done with an exclamation
and a beaming smile, as I overheard
on an airplane, it is not an entirely
positive response by default. While
such a response may bear a genuine
feeling of admiration, it also may not
be what the Stanford student sitting
next to you wants to hear.

A couple of weeks ago I de
scribed my annoyance with
the Stanford response
when people hear that you're from
Stanford, they are sometimes quick
to peg you as one of those elitist brats.
Oh, you go to Stanford? Well you're
probably really smart, rich and ob
noxious. Once they decide this, the
person in question may either stop
talking to you or make fun of you.
But there is, of course, an opposite
dimension, the other reaction. Flying
home last Thanksgiving, I overheard
a conversation two rows ahead of
where I sat perusing the gadgets in
the Sky Mall magazine. An elderly
woman struck up a conversation with
the young woman sitting next to her.
"So are you flying home for the
holiday? Oh that's nice. Are you fly
ing from college? Lovely! Where do
you go to college?"

I could not make out the respons
es, only the questions. So I didn't ac
tually hear the girl say "Stanford."
What I heard instead was "OH
WOW,STANFORD?! HOWWON
DERFUL!" I could imagine the girl
squirming in her seat as the exclama
tion lured inquiring glances from
those sitting around her. I double
checked to make sure I wasn't wear
ing any Stanford paraphernalia and,
clad in unmarked clothes, relaxed.
"What an incredible place to be in
college! What a good school! So what
do you study?" By this time, the eld
erly woman had remembered to
speak at a lower decibel. I couldn't
hear the rest of the conversation, but
I mentally thanked the powers that
be that no one had unearthed my
identity and shouted it to the rest of
the airplane as well.

This is the other response, the all
too positive, enthusiastic reaction
when we say "Stanford." And per
haps this is justifiable, for it is an im
pressive word to drop.

Sometimes it can be fantastic.
During winter break of my freshman
year at Stanford, I had Christmas din
ner with my friend and her extended
(very extended) family. My friend at
tends a technical school that is not
Stanford, but her family knew noth
ing about me when we sat down at
the long dining table. As their curios
ity turned to the newcomer, I was
asked where I went to college. When
I said Stanford, I saw two pairs of
jaws drop and the rest of the table
beaming.

Did that make me feel good? Of
course it did! Well, at first. The next
thing I realized was that I was receiv
ing a huge benefit of the doubt.
When some people hear that
you're a Stanford student, they tend
to assume that you will automatically
do great things. If you're a biology
major, you will probably find the cure
to cancer. Are you an engineer?
You'll invent a car that can run on
garbage. Studying computer science?
You'll find away for people to tele
port through their iPods.
Me? I'm a Public Policy major.
The career projections thrown my
way are that I will either be President
of the United States or maybe Secre
tary of Defense, if things don't go
well.

What I suspect people don't al
ways stop and think about is, first of
all, that if every graduating senior in
either Political Science or Public Pol
icy wanted to run for President of the

United States, that alone would
mean several hundred contenders
from the Stanford University Class
of 2011. And that doesn't happen.
With the word Stanford, people
assume that we have lofty goals, huge
aspirations and, often, some level of
genius that will enable us to enact
mind-blowing changes. The reality is
that not all of us have the interest, ca
pability or set of fortuitous circum
stances that will make it possible for
us to fix the U.S. educational system,
invent a more efficient fuel cell or
win a Nobel Peace Prize.
And some students here already

don't feel completely at home. Late
ly there have been a number of stu
dent campaigns, initiatives, and other
efforts to combat feelings of loneli
ness and not belonging at Stanford. 1
recall my freshman year, when I
found out through a dorm-wide ex
ercise that one-third of my peers in
the second-largest freshman dorm
on campus did not feel like they de
served to be at Stanford.
