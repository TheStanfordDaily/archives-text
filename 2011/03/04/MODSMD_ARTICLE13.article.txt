# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## In Memoriam 
### Kristian Bailey 
On February 18,2009, one of
my classmates killed him
self by jumping from the
eleventh floor of my school in New
York City. Two weeks and one day
later on March 5, my beloved Aunt
Cheryl, my mother's one and only
sister, died suddenly of a pul
monary embolism. The shock of
those deaths and my memories of
the subsequent days and weeks still
send chills down my spine. And
that's mostly why I've tried to
avoid thinking about them.
This year, as I sat in the East Flo
conference room or "dungeon,"
as we like to call it I looked
down at my watch slightly after
midnight and realized that it was
the first day of February. "This
month's going to suck," I thought
to myself and immediately tears
welled up in my eyes.

February had always been one
of my favorite months February
28 was Aunt Cheryl's birthday, one

of my favorite days.
Now, this time is bittersweet.
With it, I think of sitting in precal
culus one grey February morning,
hearing sirens outside, the wails of
a grieving mother, being told not to
look out the windows on the north
side of the building and wondering
who it was and whether they had
survived. With it, I think of the
numbness I felt feeling weak
from the impact of my feet hitting
the ground as I'd walk home,
knowing that Teddy had hit the
ground much harder.

There's the memory of my aunt
calling me to make sure I was okay
the day that Teddy died. And
there's the final memory of speak
ing to my aunt on her 42nd and last
birthday, late on a cold and rainy
Saturday night. I don't remember
what we said; all I remember is how
upset I was, and to a degree still am,
that I did not send her a birthday
card, that we did not drive to see

her on her special day.
Fast-forward five days, when I
was just starting to come to terms
with Teddy's death. Arriving home,
I saw my grandparents' car parked
outside and thought my parents
had just gone out to dinner. They
were sitting with my younger sib
lings in the living room watching
TV. Everything seemed fine. I
pulled out my laptop to check my
email, and at 8:15, the phone rang. I
assumed it was Aunt Cheryl, who
usually called daily to talk to my
mother.
Instead, it was Mom. I picked up
the phone and walked into the
kitchen. "Honey, I have some bad
