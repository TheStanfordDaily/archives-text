# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## In Memoriam 
### Kristian Bailey 
On February 18,2009, one of
my classmates killed him
self by jumping from the
eleventh floor of my school in New
York City. Two weeks and one day
later on March 5, my beloved Aunt
Cheryl, my mother's one and only
sister, died suddenly of a pul
monary embolism. The shock of
those deaths and my memories of
the subsequent days and weeks still
send chills down my spine. And
that's mostly why I've tried to
avoid thinking about them.
This year, as I sat in the East Flo
conference room or "dungeon,"
as we like to call it I looked
down at my watch slightly after
midnight and realized that it was
the first day of February. "This
month's going to suck," I thought
to myself and immediately tears
welled up in my eyes.

February had always been one
of my favorite months February
28 was Aunt Cheryl's birthday, one

of my favorite days.
Now, this time is bittersweet.
With it, I think of sitting in precal
culus one grey February morning,
hearing sirens outside, the wails of
a grieving mother, being told not to
look out the windows on the north
side of the building and wondering
who it was and whether they had
survived. With it, I think of the
numbness I felt feeling weak
from the impact of my feet hitting
the ground as I'd walk home,
knowing that Teddy had hit the
ground much harder.

There's the memory of my aunt
calling me to make sure I was okay
the day that Teddy died. And
there's the final memory of speak
ing to my aunt on her 42nd and last
birthday, late on a cold and rainy
Saturday night. I don't remember
what we said; all I remember is how
upset I was, and to a degree still am,
that I did not send her a birthday
card, that we did not drive to see

her on her special day.
Fast-forward five days, when I
was just starting to come to terms
with Teddy's death. Arriving home,
I saw my grandparents' car parked
outside and thought my parents
had just gone out to dinner. They
were sitting with my younger sib
lings in the living room watching
TV. Everything seemed fine. I
pulled out my laptop to check my
email, and at 8:15, the phone rang. I
assumed it was Aunt Cheryl, who
usually called daily to talk to my
mother.
Instead, it was Mom. I picked up
the phone and walked into the
kitchen. "Honey, I have some bad

news," she started. Hyperventilat
ing as she spoke, she stammered,
"Au-aunt shh Aunt Cheryl died
today." I stopped and leaned
against the doorway. My initial re
action of "No" had no emotion
I didn't compute what she said. She
told me how it happened, I said I
was sorry, hung up the phone and
walked downstairs to my room,
where I burst into tears.

The following days were a blur.
Telling close friends and teachers.
Avoiding going home. Trying to
lose myself. Numbness. The wake,
seeing her face distorted with
death and crying. Writing a good
bye note to leave in the casket.
Giving a eulogy at the funeral. See
ing strong relatives cry for the first
time. And the final goodbye at the
cemetery.

And I tried so hard to evade
these painful nightmares of yester
year. I thought by leaving the East
Coast, which I associated with
death and grief, and coming to Cal
ifornia, I could leave my grief be
hind. I thought that by saying, "No,
I won't let February suck" and
working as hard as I could, I would
be able to get through it.

And this worked for a while. I
managed to "forget," or rather try
not to remember, exactly what
date Teddy had died on and it
worked I found myself at the
end of February. The 28th came

and went, much better than I'd
thought it would.
But in retrospect, this didn't
work. What I thought was just a
winter slump I now realize was in
some part grief. Yes, I did feel over
whelmed by the pace and expecta
tions of my class, upset about
friendships and relationships, un
sure of myself, but this week, now
that I have missed at least one of
each of my three classes to sleep,
now that I have been unable to
motivate myself through my SLE
reading, now that I have been hid
ing my class-cutting and grief from
my roommate, I must accept the
truth.

What I referred to as "the Illu
sion" last week is the very thing I
was projecting trying to appear
fine by claiming my problems lay
somewhere else than where they
mostly were. My breathing as I fall
asleep this week has been the deep
and labored one of my grieving
2009-self. Consistently in my
dreams this year, my grief cries
from inside my subconscious to
come out as I weep in my sleep.
Having completed another Stu
dent Grief and Bereavement
Workshop at Vaden, I accept my
feelings for what they are and wish
to share them. Grieving is not a
process that just "ends." It is recur
rent; it comes and goes in waves
that are as brief as a moment and
as long as a few weeks. It does not
mean I am depressed I am gen
erally happy but this pain will
subsist in my heart for as long as I
live and right now it feels more
"real" than my academic life.

As I approach the two-year an
niversary of my aunt's death, and
revisit those dark days from the
past, I don't know what I want or
what I need. I just want those
around me to be aware.
