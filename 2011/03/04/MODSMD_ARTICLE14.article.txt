## A
						Mile A Minute in Madrid 
### Max Markham 
Fpur weeks, four countries, six air
planes, one bus, 40+ hours of trav
el time. Couple that with class
Monday through Thursday, a full work
load (maybe not a full Stanford work
load, but still) and the Madrileno ten
dency to stay out until 7 o'clock in the
morning when partying, and you have
my schedule for last month in a nut
shell. February may be the shortest
month of the year, but that didn't stop
me from packing as many travel en
deavours into its 28 days as possible.
Back in January when I realised I
would be travelling all four weekends
of last month, I figured I'd just have to
stay on top of work so I could get good
sleep during the week. Soon enough, I
realised that I was instead staying on
top of work so that I would have time
to go out during the week and experi
ence the Madrid nightlife that I would
miss while travelling. Sleep? Not as im
portant. I can sleep when I'm dead.
My first stop was Paris. Somewhat
hypocritical considering I spent my
fall quarter there studying for 11
weeks. Even more so considering it is
the city that robbed me of my self-es
teem and most of my summer savings
in a matter of weeks. Nevertheless, its
allure as a cosmopolitan and cultural
capital is undeniable, and my desire to
relive that and visit some friends who
had stayed on from fall was too strong
to not take advantage of the cheap
Iberia Airline offers from Madrid. I
vowed to not eat, drink or shop ex
travagantly, as I had done too many
times last quarter. I managed to stay
true on two out of three of those goals
(if you know me, you can probably
guess which one I failed on). The long
weekend was spent mostly sleepless,
revisiting my old stomping ground
and showing my new Madrid friends
all of the "cool places" consisting
of bars, clubs and that thing called the
Eiffel something-or-other. One of the
greatest things about studying abroad
somewhere is that, when you come
back to visit (or live, as the case prob
ably is for some), you already know
the city well. It's like a second home,
and I'm egotistically proud to be able
to call Paris one of my many homes.
The next stop was Geneva. Not nor
mally an international university stu
dent hub (especially not in the winter,
unless it's to ski), it was a required stop
on my list as it holds the most impor
tant thing in the world to me my
mother. A tiny city, with the amount of
people housed on about five city

blocks in Manhattan, Geneva is one of
the more efficient places I've ever been
to. It was a great place to hide out the
weekend before midterms and nurse
my cold acquired from a severe lack of
sleep and travel stress with some TLC
from a loving parent (who, lovingly,
paid for everything).
Trip number three was our Bing
trip to Extremadura, the westernmost
municipality in Spain where remains
from the Roman Empire still exist. An
exhausting weekend thanks to count
less hours of bus rides and walking
tours, sometimes in the cold, wind and
rain, Extremadura proved that Spain
could still be beautiful even when the
weather wasn't.The people were unbe
lievably nice, and the food, though
heavy, was delicious. And it wouldn't
have been a Stanford trip if we hadn't
stayed in the nicest of hotels; one was a
castle formerly owned by Carlos V,
enough said.
Still exhausted from our uncount
able hours of walking tours the week
end before, my final stop was the cold
est of all Berlin. Fortunately for
me, it was a free trip organised by the
Stanford program in Berlin, which
had put together a workshop on the
European Union crisis. The frosty
German weather was a rude greeting
to our Madrid hangovers from the
night before. Still, we persevered
through the conference, managing to
present our panel without flaw and
learn a lot from all the other groups at
the same time. Since the workshop
was over on Saturday night and our
flight wasn't until the next evening, we
figured we would be able to relax,
enjoy the nightlife in Berlin and then
sleep in the next morning. Not quite. It
wouldn't have been a Stanford pro
gram if there weren't a walking tour in
sub-zero conditions organised for 9
a.m. the next day.
Four colds and a half dozen pass
port stamps later, I can genuinely say
that there is no better way to spend a
quarter abroad in Europe than travel
ling. The best part? I still have two
weeks left to explore Madrid.

Max is wondering which cities he should
check out over the next two weeks Send
