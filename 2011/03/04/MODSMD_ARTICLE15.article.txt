# FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE
## Lost and Found in Florence 
### Kathy Storch 
I highly advise an inexperienced
flyer to refrain from watching
disaster films prior to a long
flight. Having never flown over the
Atlantic Ocean before, and having
watched Titanic about seven times
during winter break (it was HBO's
featured film), I was completely
convinced that my plane to Flo
rence was going to crash into the
Atlantic Ocean on the way. Addi
tionally, prior to my departure, I
was so compulsive about my bag
being less than 50 pounds that I
started packing at the start of break
and weighed my bag every few days
to track my progress. I realized I
had completely lost my head two
days before my departure, when my
dad hid a 20-pound dumbbell in my
suitcase, resulting in my having a
near panic attack and circling the
house, yelling, "How am I going to
eliminate 20 more pounds! And
how did my umbrella add so much
weight?"
But aside from a fear of flying
and airline regulations, the one
emotion I felt more than any other
was, believe it or not, pressure. I re
alized that rarely ever had I en
countered a person who did not say
that their abroad experience was
the most amazing time of their life,
and I remember thinking, What if I
don't have a great time? What if I
come back thinking my past three
months abroad were just so-so?
I would like to be able to say that
the pressure to be happy while
abroad evaporated immediately,
but, of course, this was not so. My
new Stanford acquaintances and I
adventured to Lucca to bike-ride
around the small medieval, walled
city, traveled to Bologna to search
for the hidden canals that flowed
under and between the city's or
ange houses and crossed Emilia-
Romagna to Parma to snap pic
tures of its pink Baptistery. We saw
Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" on
our Bing Trip to Milan, scavenger
hunted through Barcelona to see
all of Gaudi's works and stood awe
struck under the Pantheon in
Rome, the power of which could
never be captured in a photo.
And during all of these amazing
experiences, I was still concerned
about being happy. I had become
some kind of compulsive wreck
afraid to let go of the pressure for

fear that I would regret my trip
later.
And then, finally, a talk with my
roommate put things into perspec
tive for me. She told me that this is
life one's abroad experience
doesn't just freeze all the bad and
bring in all the good. She said, "You
live here, Katy in a foreign city.
You have bad days and good days,
and that's okay!"
It wasn't necessarily an "ah-ha"
moment, but it did put me at ease.
I stopped worrying about smiling
all the time and started to let my
bad days show as much as my good
days. And once the fear of having
to one day say, "Oh, my abroad ex
perience was just so-so," had been
buried, I actually had one of the
most unexpected realizations of
my life. I began to understand that
the best experiences occur when
we aren't paying attention
when we are too happy to analyze
what we are learning and how we
are changing.
On my trip to Venice during
Carnival a week ago, I realized how
lucky I am. My friends and I ex
plored the city, down streets that
dead-ended or descended into
Harry Potter-style stairs that van
ished into the water. We walked
along the islands' perimeters, under
bright sun and in the lively atmos
phere that is "Carnevale." We wore
our embellished masks, shopped
for Venetian glass and dined at
restaurants on the boardwalk that
overlooked the canals.
As my abroad experience comes
to an end, I plan to spend the last of
it in Florence, where my true alle
giance lies. Just like any other
home, it has become a place of good
and bad days, mistakes and growth,
and, most importantly, friends to
share it all with. When my abroad
quarter is over, I hope I can say it
was one of the best experiences of
my life. But then again, I'm only 20
and where's the sense in having
your best experience before you've
lived half your life?
