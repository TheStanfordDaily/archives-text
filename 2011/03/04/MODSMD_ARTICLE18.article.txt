## BEAT THE BEARS NO. 2 WOMEN'S TENNIS ROLLING THROUGH PAC-10 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Only Berkeley stands in the way
of the Stanford women's tennis team
and a much-deserved two-week
match break. After playing six
matches in nine days at the National
Team Indoor Championships and re
turning home to begin Pac-10 confer
ence play, the Cardinal has earned
some rest.

The team has been performing
fantastically so far this season. It
cruised through the Indoors Cham
pionships, a prestigious early season
tournament that teams use to gauge
where they stand on the national
stage. After defeating the Florida
Gators in a repeat of last year's
NCAA Championship match, the
players returned home to post two
successive shutouts over Pac-10 op
ponents Oregon and Washington
State. They now have seven shutouts
in eleven matches.

"We are playing at a really high
level of tennis," said sophomore Na
talie Dillon. "We have a lot of depth
this year, a lot of talent at every spot.
Teams should definitely be scared to
play us. It's exciting to see how all our
hard work in the fall has really paid
off throughout the first half of this
season and hopefully in the second
half."

However, despite the dominating
results, the Cardinal dropped to No. 2
in the national rankings behind the
new No. 1, Florida.
Around this point in the season,
the rankings switch from poll rank
ings to a computerized point-per
match formula. According to this sys
tem, Florida is No. 1 because of the
strength of schedule of ACC play.
Florida, a member of that conference
in women's tennis, has posted five
top-12 victories, all over ACC oppo
nents, including three wins against
top-five teams. Stanford boasts six
victories in top-20 games, but only
has wins over two teams in the top 12.
Despite one of those victories a 4-
2 victory over Florida the Cardi
nal still finds itself ranked below the
Gators.

The new rankings did help some.
Senior star Hilary Barte saw herself
rise to the top of the rankings and be
come the country's new No. 1 player.
After her, Kristie Ahn is ranked 13th,
Nicole Gibbs is ranked 20th, Mallory
Burdette is ranked 24th and Stacey
Tan is ranked 46th. In doubles, Barte
and Burdette are ranked No. 2 be
hind No. 1 Sofie Oyen and Allie Will
of Florida. This ranking is again a bit
misleading, because Barte/Burdette
defeated Oyen/Will at Indoors 8-5
two weeks ago.
Aside from the rankings, Stanford
is still playing some of its finest tennis
at the moment. The team faced the
University of San Francisco Thurs
day afternoon during the few hours
of sun that day and prevailed 5-2.
There were a few fresh faces playing,
as Natalie Dillon, Herring and fresh
man Elizabeth Ecker all got the
chance to play. For Herring and Dil

lon, it was their dual match season
debuts playing at the No. 5 and No. 6
spots, respectively.
"I was nervous," Herring said.
"I've never played a dual match be
fore, so it was just interesting to not
be in the stands cheering everyone
on and instead being on the court
having everyone cheer me on. It was
a great change."
Herring struggled in singles, win
ning her first set before dropping the
next two to lose the match, 4-6,6-2,1-
0 (7). However, with her powerful
serve clicking in doubles, she paired
up with Jennifer Yen to record an
easy 8-1 victory.
"My serve was on in doubles, def
initely," Herring said. "It's usually my
serve that I have the most confidence
in. If I need a free point, it's usually
what I rely on."
Dillon also struggled in her
match, fighting but falling in two sets,
6-3, 6-2. Her opponent played with

heavy topspin and a powerful fore
hand that challenged Dillon, who
played with minor shoulder strains.
"I could have done better," said
Dillon. "I had a couple injuries in my
shoulders that I think brought me
down a little bit. I did decent, not my
best but not my worst."
Ecker played on Court seven and
experienced a very up-and-down
match. She breezed through the first
set, 6-0. In the second, she lost focus
and her opponent forced a third-set
tiebreaker. Ecker raced out to a 6-1
lead in the tiebreaker before closing
her opponent out, 6-0,5-7,1-0 (4).
"We've had a long week," Herring
said. "We came back from indoors
and we jumped right back into two
matches right away. But everyone is
getting ready for this weekend and
getting really excited for Cal."
Cal is Stanford's next opponent

a match that is always circled on
the calendar. This year, the Golden
Bears are ranked sixth and have
only suffered one surprising loss,
to Northwestern, in the first round
of Indoors. Their top player, Jana
Juricova, is ranked 4th in both sin
gles and in doubles, where she
pairs up with Mari Andersson.
With a victory, Stanford would
continue an unparalleled streak of
172 consecutive wins at home. This
is the longest active home winning

streak among all sports in Division
I athletics. It was Berkeley that last
defeated the Cardinal on the
Farm, edging out Stanford in 1999
by a 5-4 score. The streak will be
tested again by the Cardinal's
cross-town rivals.
Last season, Stanford defeated
Cal twice by scores of 5-2 each time,
despite Cal being ranked No. 5 dur
ing their first meeting. With Stan

matchup, the players are hoping not
to see another upset this year. The

Only Berkeley stands in the way
of the Stanford women's tennis team
and a much-deserved two-week
match break. After playing six
matches in nine days at the National
Team Indoor Championships and re
turning home to begin Pac-10 confer
ence play, the Cardinal has earned
some rest.

The team has been performing
fantastically so far this season. It
cruised through the Indoors Cham
pionships, a prestigious early season
tournament that teams use to gauge
where they stand on the national
stage. After defeating the Florida
Gators in a repeat of last year's
NCAA Championship match, the
players returned home to post two
successive shutouts over Pac-10 op
ponents Oregon and Washington
State. They now have seven shutouts
in eleven matches.

"We are playing at a really high
level of tennis," said sophomore Na
talie Dillon. "We have a lot of depth
this year, a lot of talent at every spot.
Teams should definitely be scared to
play us. It's exciting to see how all our
hard work in the fall has really paid
off throughout the first half of this
season and hopefully in the second
half."

However, despite the dominating
results, the Cardinal dropped to No. 2
in the national rankings behind the
new No. 1, Florida.
Around this point in the season,
the rankings switch from poll rank
ings to a computerized point-per
match formula. According to this sys
tem, Florida is No. 1 because of the
strength of schedule of ACC play.
Florida, a member of that conference
in women's tennis, has posted five
top-12 victories, all over ACC oppo
nents, including three wins against
top-five teams. Stanford boasts six
victories in top-20 games, but only
has wins over two teams in the top 12.
Despite one of those victories a 4-
2 victory over Florida the Cardi
nal still finds itself ranked below the
Gators.

The new rankings did help some.
Senior star Hilary Barte saw herself
rise to the top of the rankings and be
come the country's new No. 1 player.
After her, Kristie Ahn is ranked 13th,
Nicole Gibbs is ranked 20th, Mallory
Burdette is ranked 24th and Stacey
Tan is ranked 46th. In doubles, Barte
and Burdette are ranked No. 2 be
hind No. 1 Sofie Oyen and Allie Will
of Florida. This ranking is again a bit
misleading, because Barte/Burdette
defeated Oyen/Will at Indoors 8-5
two weeks ago.
Aside from the rankings, Stanford
is still playing some of its finest tennis
at the moment. The team faced the
University of San Francisco Thurs
day afternoon during the few hours
of sun that day and prevailed 5-2.
There were a few fresh faces playing,
as Natalie Dillon, Herring and fresh
man Elizabeth Ecker all got the
chance to play. For Herring and Dil

lon, it was their dual match season
debuts playing at the No. 5 and No. 6
spots, respectively.
"I was nervous," Herring said.
"I've never played a dual match be
fore, so it was just interesting to not
be in the stands cheering everyone
on and instead being on the court
having everyone cheer me on. It was
a great change."
Herring struggled in singles, win
ning her first set before dropping the
next two to lose the match, 4-6,6-2,1-
0 (7). However, with her powerful
serve clicking in doubles, she paired
up with Jennifer Yen to record an
easy 8-1 victory.
"My serve was on in doubles, def
initely," Herring said. "It's usually my
serve that I have the most confidence
in. If I need a free point, it's usually
what I rely on."
Dillon also struggled in her
match, fighting but falling in two sets,
6-3, 6-2. Her opponent played with

heavy topspin and a powerful fore
hand that challenged Dillon, who
played with minor shoulder strains.
"I could have done better," said
Dillon. "I had a couple injuries in my
shoulders that I think brought me
down a little bit. I did decent, not my
best but not my worst."
Ecker played on Court seven and
experienced a very up-and-down
match. She breezed through the first
set, 6-0. In the second, she lost focus
and her opponent forced a third-set
tiebreaker. Ecker raced out to a 6-1
lead in the tiebreaker before closing
her opponent out, 6-0,5-7,1-0 (4).
"We've had a long week," Herring
said. "We came back from indoors
and we jumped right back into two
matches right away. But everyone is
getting ready for this weekend and
getting really excited for Cal."
Cal is Stanford's next opponent

Senior Carolyn McVeigh, above, is coming off a 6-0, 6-2 victory in her last

a match that is always circled on
the calendar. This year, the Golden
Bears are ranked sixth and have
only suffered one surprising loss,
to Northwestern, in the first round
of Indoors. Their top player, Jana
Juricova, is ranked 4th in both sin
gles and in doubles, where she
pairs up with Mari Andersson.
With a victory, Stanford would
continue an unparalleled streak of
172 consecutive wins at home. This
is the longest active home winning

streak among all sports in Division
I athletics. It was Berkeley that last
defeated the Cardinal on the
Farm, edging out Stanford in 1999
by a 5-4 score. The streak will be
tested again by the Cardinal's
cross-town rivals.
Last season, Stanford defeated
Cal twice by scores of 5-2 each time,
