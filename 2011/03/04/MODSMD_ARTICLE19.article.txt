## You make the call: which rules must go? 
### 
A basic fact of all sports is
that rules change. Go
back far enough, and
even your favorite and
most familiar pastime
starts to look entirely different. Bas
ketball is a great example of this, hav
ing changed substantially in the few
short years after James Naismith
strung up a pair of peach baskets. In
fact, even as late as 1995 in Okla
homa, women's basketball was
played with six players a side. Nothing
is permanent, and perhaps no rule is
so sacred that ten years from now it
will still be there.
So, if you had the ultimate power
to rewrite the rulebook, what would
you do?
Now before you get too excited,
I'm going to throw in one little caveat.
You can only change one rule per
sport, because it has to remain identi
fiably the same sport. You can't just
make a soccer ball oval and allow
people to use their hands and wear
helmets, because then it's not soccer,
it's football.
As for me? Ok, there is no point
