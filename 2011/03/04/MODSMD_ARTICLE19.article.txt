## You make the call: which rules must go? 
### 
A basic fact of all sports is
that rules change. Go
back far enough, and
even your favorite and
most familiar pastime
starts to look entirely different. Bas
ketball is a great example of this, hav
ing changed substantially in the few
short years after James Naismith
strung up a pair of peach baskets. In
fact, even as late as 1995 in Okla
homa, women's basketball was
played with six players a side. Nothing
is permanent, and perhaps no rule is
so sacred that ten years from now it
will still be there.
So, if you had the ultimate power
to rewrite the rulebook, what would
you do?
Now before you get too excited,
I'm going to throw in one little caveat.
You can only change one rule per
sport, because it has to remain identi
fiably the same sport. You can't just
make a soccer ball oval and allow
people to use their hands and wear
helmets, because then it's not soccer,
it's football.
As for me? Ok, there is no point
sticking to safe territory here, so first
['in going to go straight for some
major American ones before turning
my attention back to more familiar
ground.
Hockey: ban players for fighting.
Don't just sin-bin them, eject them
from the game and bar them from the
next one. Unlike in martial arts, you
don't get points for hitting each other,
so why sit by and let this distract from
real displays of skill?
Baseball: get rid of the glove. I've
said this before, but I just don't get why
players need it to catch a ball.To an un
familiar observer it just looks like a
comedy prop; it would be the same as
a football kicker taking the field with
one giant shoe. However, this single
rule has such a big effect on the sport
that I'm not sure I can do this one.
Without the glove, baseball simply
wouldn't be baseball. The ball would
become far harder to catch and the
batting team would score far more
runs. It might even become impossible
to finish nine innings in a single day.

Football: cut the time between
plays. I can't be the only person whose
attention has drifted away from an
otherwise thrilling game during the
half-minute break between downs, or
who gets frustrated when teams kneel
down instead of playing to kill the last
couple of minutes of a game. I don't
doubt that football players are ath
letes, so I don't see why they need so
much time to recover between plays.
Soccer: bring in technology to as
sist referees. Every major soccer com
petition is blighted by terrible referee
ing errors that can have a major im
pact on results and lead to intense vit
riol directed at officials. It's such an ob
vious solution to most soccer fans
to them, it's a complete mystery as to
why the sport's governing bodies are
so reluctant to consider using the sort
of technology that is widely and suc
cessfully used in most other big sports.
Tennis: ban players from grunting.
Being able to hear the sound of ball
on-racket is one of the reasons the
crowd at a tennis match is supposed to
keep quiet, because it gives the oppos
ing player extra information about the
shot heading their way. In that light,
shouting while playing a shot is effec
tively cheating. Some players quite
credibly emit grunts of exhaustion to
wards the end of a long rally, but oth
ers scream loudly even when hitting a
gentle drop shot. If the players are al

lowed to make so much noise, I don't
see why the fans can't.
Formula 1: keep the rules the same.
The official rules of this sport literally
change every single year, making it in
creasingly hard to be a fan. Each sea
son the teams struggle to build legal
cars, since they almost certainly won't
be able to use last year's, and even the
governing body struggles to enforce

rules that are in almost constant flux.
This doesn't make the sport more ex
citing, it just makes it confusing, and it
guarantees that the best teams are the
ones with the most money to spend
testing the boundaries of each new set
of rules.

Track and Field: allow all starts that
are after the gun. Many runners have
gotten into trouble for making false
starts because they moved too quickly
after the sound of the starting pistol.
There may well be a human limit on
how quickly someone reacts, but this
limit is likely to be different from per
son to person. If you were to enforce
this properly then you would have to
measure the reaction times of each
runner and use these figures, not some
kind of average lower limit, to ensure
no one has reacted quicker than they
legitimately can.
I'm not sure if there is such a thing
as a quick fix, or whether you agree
with any of my ideas, and I'm ab
solutely certain that no one with any
real power will be reading this col
umn. But if someone out there is lis
tening to me, what would you do?

I just don't get
why players
need a glove to
catch a baseball
