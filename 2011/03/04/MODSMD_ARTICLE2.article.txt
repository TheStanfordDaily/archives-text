## Three Exec slates declare Elections cutoff this afternoon 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
With less than a day left to garner the
required 300 signatures to earn a spot on
the spring general elections ballot, three
slates have declared intent to run for
ASSU Executive this year. The deadline
to sign a petition for a potential slate, sen
ator or special fees group is today at 4
p.m.
In addition, if each of the slate's 300
signatories constitutes at least 100 under
graduate and 100 graduate students, that
slate will be eligible for $5OO in public fi
nancing.
The three groups currently listed on
the ASSU Elections web site are Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis, Hertz-Coggeshall
Family for Excellence and Tenzin-
Vasquez.
Michael Cruz' 12 and Stewart Macgre
gor-Dennis 'l3 have a combined total of
five years of ASSU experience. Running
as insiders of the ASSU, Cruz and Mac
gregor-Dennis think that their experi
ence will help them reform and strength
en the ASSU.
Cruz is currently serving as the ASSU
Vice President and Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis is currently serving as the Senate
Treasurer.
"For both of us, we're very passionate
about Stanford and very passionate
about letting Stanford students do social
change through their passions," Cruz
said. "[Stewart and I] knew each other in
the Senate and really connected on a
good level."
The main focus of their campaign will
be on empowering Stanford students to
give back to the community in their own
unique ways.
"Allowing people to give back in
whatever way suits them best," Macgre
gor-Dennis said. "Instead of encouraging
people to give back in the ways we think
are best, we want to broaden the idea of
what 'doing service' means. We want to
find people who are passionate about
things and we want them to work with us
on the big issues."
When asked about the pay of senators
and executives, the pair responded that
they would definitely look into the issue.
"One of the things we want to main
tain is the quality of opportunity and
spirit of volunteerism and service," said
Macgregor-Dennis. "We want to make
sure people are willing to give up their
time far beyond what they are receiv
ing."
The other slate that has earned 300
signatures is that of Tenzin Seldon 'l2 and
Joe Vasquez 'll, who announced their
candidacy late Wednesday night. Seldon,
a self-described "militant activist" for Ti
betan rights and human rights in general,
is currently serving as the Chair of the
ASSU Diversity, Tolerance and Equality
Team.
Seldon said she was compelled to run
for ASSU Executive because she feels
more can be done by the ASSU to help
out Stanford students.
"I feel like the ASSU is the way to mo
tivate and galvanize people on campus,"
she said, "and I feel like that hasn't been
used to its full potential."
One of the most important issues for
Seldon is the mental health of Stanford
students. The recent suicide of 22-year
old student Claire Roscow, with whom
Seldon had formed a friendship during
their collaboration through the Center
for Compassion and Altruism Research
and Education (CCARE), deeply affect
ed her.
"I feel like the environment here calls
for us to be perfectionists and doesn't al
ways give us a chance to talk about real is
sues," Seldon said. "I would work on
broad changes, as well as concrete
changes to promote mental health on
campus."
Another top issue for Seldon is
the level of diversity and tolerance
on Stanford campus. As a first-gen
eration, low-income student, she
sees more that Stanford could do to
help students who need it. Seldon
said she feels that Stanford some
times lets these students down, and
she hopes to engage the administra
tion on such issues.
Seldon also said her running
mate Vazquez will prove a valuable
asset in the campaign if elected.
"I thought Joe really comple
mented a different set of visions,"
said Seldon. "He had concrete, tan
gible ideas as to how to implement
[improvements] to the Greek and
social life on campus. He also has a
lot of administrative and executive
skills needed for this position, as do
I, and having two leaders with ad
ministrative skills is a definite plus."
Samuel Coggeshall 'l2 and Alex

Hertz 'l3 are running for president
and vice-president on the slate tra
ditionally backed by the Stanford
Chaparral. At the time of publica
tion, their petition had only gar
nered slightly over 100 signatures,
well short of the 300 required to
earn a spot on the ballot. Neither re
turned requests for comment.
With only three slates currently
running for this year's Executive,
the current field is much less crowd
ed than last year, which featured six
slates. Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the
ASSU Elections Commissioner,
says that while it's probably a little
strange, "things like this have hap
pened in the past." Six slates ran in
both the 2008 and 2010 elections;
however, in 2009, only three slates
were on the ballot.

Due to "extenuating circum
stances," the deadline to declare to
run for the junior class slate and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
has been extended to Friday, March
18.

mate Vazquez will prove a valuable
asset in the campaign if elected.
"I thought Joe really comple
mented a different set of visions,"
said Seldon. "He had concrete, tan
gible ideas as to how to implement
[improvements] to the Greek and
social life on campus. He also has a
lot of administrative and executive
skills needed for this position, as do
I, and having two leaders with ad
ministrative skills is a definite plus."
Samuel Coggeshall 'l2 and Alex

Hertz 'l3 are running for president
and vice-president on the slate tra
ditionally backed by the Stanford
Chaparral. At the time of publica
tion, their petition had only gar
nered slightly over 100 signatures,
well short of the 300 required to
earn a spot on the ballot. Neither re
turned requests for comment.
With only three slates currently
running for this year's Executive,
the current field is much less crowd
ed than last year, which featured six
slates. Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the
ASSU Elections Commissioner,
says that while it's probably a little
strange, "things like this have hap
pened in the past." Six slates ran in
both the 2008 and 2010 elections;
however, in 2009, only three slates
were on the ballot.

Due to "extenuating circum
stances," the deadline to declare to
run for the junior class slate and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC)
has been extended to Friday, March
18.

With less than a day left to garner the
required 300 signatures to earn a spot on
the spring general elections ballot, three
slates have declared intent to run for
ASSU Executive this year. The deadline
to sign a petition for a potential slate, sen
ator or special fees group is today at 4
p.m.
In addition, if each of the slate's 300
signatories constitutes at least 100 under
graduate and 100 graduate students, that
slate will be eligible for $5OO in public fi
nancing.
The three groups currently listed on
the ASSU Elections web site are Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis, Hertz-Coggeshall
Family for Excellence and Tenzin-
Vasquez.
Michael Cruz' 12 and Stewart Macgre
gor-Dennis 'l3 have a combined total of
five years of ASSU experience. Running
as insiders of the ASSU, Cruz and Mac
gregor-Dennis think that their experi
ence will help them reform and strength
en the ASSU.
Cruz is currently serving as the ASSU
Vice President and Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis is currently serving as the Senate
Treasurer.
"For both of us, we're very passionate
about Stanford and very passionate
about letting Stanford students do social
change through their passions," Cruz
said. "[Stewart and I] knew each other in
the Senate and really connected on a
good level."
The main focus of their campaign will
be on empowering Stanford students to
give back to the community in their own
unique ways.
"Allowing people to give back in
whatever way suits them best," Macgre
gor-Dennis said. "Instead of encouraging
people to give back in the ways we think
are best, we want to broaden the idea of
what 'doing service' means. We want to
find people who are passionate about
things and we want them to work with us
on the big issues."
When asked about the pay of senators
and executives, the pair responded that
they would definitely look into the issue.
"One of the things we want to main
tain is the quality of opportunity and
spirit of volunteerism and service," said
Macgregor-Dennis. "We want to make
sure people are willing to give up their
time far beyond what they are receiv
ing."
The other slate that has earned 300
signatures is that of Tenzin Seldon 'l2 and
Joe Vasquez 'll, who announced their
candidacy late Wednesday night. Seldon,
a self-described "militant activist" for Ti
betan rights and human rights in general,
is currently serving as the Chair of the
ASSU Diversity, Tolerance and Equality
Team.
Seldon said she was compelled to run
for ASSU Executive because she feels
more can be done by the ASSU to help
out Stanford students.
"I feel like the ASSU is the way to mo
tivate and galvanize people on campus,"
she said, "and I feel like that hasn't been
used to its full potential."
One of the most important issues for
Seldon is the mental health of Stanford
students. The recent suicide of 22-year
old student Claire Roscow, with whom
Seldon had formed a friendship during
their collaboration through the Center
for Compassion and Altruism Research
and Education (CCARE), deeply affect
ed her.
"I feel like the environment here calls
for us to be perfectionists and doesn't al
ways give us a chance to talk about real is
sues," Seldon said. "I would work on
broad changes, as well as concrete
changes to promote mental health on
campus."
Another top issue for Seldon is
the level of diversity and tolerance
on Stanford campus. As a first-gen
eration, low-income student, she
sees more that Stanford could do to
help students who need it. Seldon
said she feels that Stanford some
times lets these students down, and
she hopes to engage the administra
tion on such issues.
Seldon also said her running
mate Vazquez will prove a valuable
asset in the campaign if elected.
"I thought Joe really comple
mented a different set of visions,"
said Seldon. "He had concrete, tan
gible ideas as to how to implement
[improvements] to the Greek and
social life on campus. He also has a
lot of administrative and executive
skills needed for this position, as do
I, and having two leaders with ad
ministrative skills is a definite plus."
