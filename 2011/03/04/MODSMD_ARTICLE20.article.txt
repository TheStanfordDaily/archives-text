# MEN'S TENNIS
## TIME TO END THE SLIDE 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team,
in the midst of a slide, is set to em
bark on a three-week hiatus from
dual-match team play, ending when
it returns to the court against Baylor
on March 22.
In the meantime, though, a num
ber of Stanford players will partici
pate in the Pacific Coast Doubles
Tournament.
The Cardinal (8-3) has slipped a
bit in the national rankings lately,
dropping out of the No. 8 spot it had
held for the last month to No. 10. The
minor dip comes on the heels of con
secutive losses to Georgia at the
ITA National Indoor Champi
onships over Presidents Day week
end and to USC down in Los Ange
les last weekend.
The upcoming break is due to
Dead Week and finals, and it may
have come at exactly the right time.
In addition to practicing and training
essentially every day, the Cardinal
has played 11 competitive matches in
the span of a month, a grueling and
exhausting stretch for both the team
and coaching staff. Stanford has won

eight of those 11 matches and is con
tinuing to improve as the season pro
gresses continuing to, in the
words of head coach John
Whitlinger, "build towards May,"
when the NCAA Championships
begin.
The time off from dual-match
play will not be entirely idle, howev
er, as this weekend brings with it the
122 nd Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment, down in La Jolla, Calif. Five
Stanford doubles teams 10 play
ers in total will be making the trip
to San Diego to compete in the sea
son's biggest doubles tournament
before the NCAAs.
The Pacific Coast Tournament
has always had a reputation as a
somewhat quirky, fun event. It is the
world's second-oldest continuous
doubles tournament, trailing only
Wimbledon (which began in 1884,
seven years before the PCT was in
augurated.) In the event's rich histo
ry are winners such as Bobby Riggs
(1936), Arthur Ashe (1965-66) and
Stanford's own John McEnroe
(1978).
The tournament is unique in
that the 98-team field is comprised
of players from several different
age groups and experience levels.
Along with the collegiate players
that comprise most of the field,
there are high school players, re
tired professionals and even some
near-senior citizens. Tournament
Director William J. Kellogg, at 59,
is the oldest player in the draw and
will be competing with his trusty
partner, head tennis pro at the host
facility La Jolla Beach & Tennis
Club, Manolo Ortiz, 46 years old.
In last year's event, Stanford's
No. 1 doubles team of junior
Bradley Klahn and senior Ryan
Thacher nearly joined the likes of
McEnroe, Ashe and Briggs, but fell
in the finals. This year they will try
to top that result and will be joined
in the draw by four other Cardinal

teams: seniors Alex Clayton and
Ted Kelly, sophomores Dennis Lin
and Matt Kandath, senior Greg
Hirshmann and sophomore Walk
er Kehrer, and freshman Jamin
Ball and sophomore Dennis Lin.
This weekend's event repre
sents the last competitive action

for the Stanford players before
they hit the books for two weeks of
serious studying. The season will
kick itself into an even higher gear
as March rolls around to April.
