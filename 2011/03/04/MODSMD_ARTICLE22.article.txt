# MEN'S BASKETBALL
## Clock running out on young Cardinal 
### NIC REINER-PARRA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To cap off an up-and-down
2010-11 regular season, the
Stanford men's basketball team
travels across the Bay to face
rival California Saturday night.
The Cardinal (15-14, 7-10
Pac-10) is coming off a 77-66
nonconference victory over
Seattle University and will be
looking for a season sweep of
the Bears (16-13, 9-8), which
would be its first since 2008.

During the teams' first meet
ing this year on Jan. 2 which
was also both teams' Pac-10 de
buts Stanford powered to an
82-68 victory on the backs of
junior guard Jeremy Green and
freshman forward Dwight Pow
ell. Green started off the Pac-10
season strong, finishing with 21
points, while Powell, in the high
est scoring game of his young
career, contributed 20 points to
go along with seven rebounds.
Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins talked about what he
sees from Cal going into Satur
day's game,
"They're a good team," he
said. "They're playing well. Of
course, it's a rival game so I'm
sure they'll be fired up, just as
we will. It will be very competi
tive and it'll be a great environ
ment. We look forward to the

challenge."
During Pac-10 play, Cal is 5-
3 at home and the team is look
ing for its fourth straight victo
ry. The Bears are led by junior
forward Harper Kamp (14.4
points per game) and junior
guard Jorge Gutierrez (14.8 ppg
and 4.5 assists per game), both
of whom played well in the first
matchup against the Cardinal.
Kamp had 16 points on the in
side and Gutierrez dished out 8
assists, his 3rd-highest total this
season.

The game should also fea
ture plenty of outside shooting.
Stanford will be looking to ex
ploit the Bears' perimeter play,
as Cal is allowing opponents to
shoot 39 percent from beyond
the arc in Pac-10 play. In its first
meeting with Cal, Stanford
made nine of 17 three-pointers,
with Green making four of
them. But Cal itself also shoots
well from the 3-point line, mak
ing 40 percent of its threes in
Pac-10 games this season.
Last year, the teams also met
in the regular season finale
the Bears won that matchup,
clinching the Pac-10 regular
season title in the process.
Dawkins commented on how
Cal's run last year can factor
into this year's game.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior forward Josh Owens (13) is shooting an impressive 59 percent
from the field while averaging 12 points and seven rebounds a game
this season. Stanford plays rival Cal tomorrow afternoon in Berkeley.
"They've got a mature front
line," he said. "They have some vet
erans that have experienced lot of
success, like Gutierrez. The differ
ence in experience poses a chal
lenge to us."
Lacking significant team experi
ence and without a senior on the
roster, the Cardinal relies on youth.
The Cardinal's freshman core
played a pivotal role in the first
matchup between the teams this

season. In addition to Powell's big
performance, freshman guard
Aaron Bright scored 10 points
while his classmate and fellow
guard, Anthony Brown, chipped in
with 11 points.
Dawkins noted how Saturday's
matchup feels different from the
first one.

"Both teams, absolutely, in two
months have changed," he said.
"Our season is like a lifetime

the players go through so many ex
periences. They start to evolve. For
our team, our identity has some
what changed from then to now.
"You know, probably five out of
our top eight players who are con

tributing are freshmen. We rely on
those kids to bring consistency," he
continued. "They've all got better
and really started to contribute to
what we're trying to accomplish."
Stanford is currently eighth in
the Pac-10, while Cal is holding
onto the fifth spot. Both schools are
jockeying for better positions in
the Pac-10 tournament next week,
as teams in the top six places re
ceive first-round byes in Los Ange
les.

Tip-off is scheduled for 4 p.m. at
Haas Pavilion in Berkeley, Calif.
