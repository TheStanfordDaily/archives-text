NOTES ! The Cardinal gets a week off after
finishing off its Pac-10 season with a 75-

into the Pac-10 Tournament, which be
gins next weekend in Los Angeles.

Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike (13) stretches for a pass during Stanford's 75-51 victory over
rival Cal. The Card finished off a perfect Pac-10 season with its 61st straight home victor/ last night.
"They're a good team," he said.
"They're playing well. Of course,
it's a rival game so I'm sure they'll
be fired up, just as we will. It will be
very competitive and it'll be a great
environment. We look forward to
the challenge."
During Pac-10 play, Cal is 5-3 at
home and the team is looking for its
fourth straight victory. The Bears
are led by junior forward Harper
Kamp (14.4 points per game) and
junior guard Jorge Gutierrez (14.8
ppg and 4.5 assists per game), froth
of whom played well in the first
matchup against the Cardinal.
Kamp had 16 points on the inside
and Gutierrez dished out 8 assists,
his 3rd-highest total this season.
The game should also feature
plenty of outside shooting. Stan
ford will be looking to exploit the
Bears' perimeter play, as Cal is al
lowing opponents to shoot 39 per
cent from beyond the arc in Pac-10

play. In its first meeting with Cal,
Stanford made nine of 17 three
pointers, with Green making four
of them. But Cal itself also shoots
well from the 3-point line, making
40 percent of its threes in Pac-10
games this season.
Last year, the teams also met in
the regular season finale the
Bears won that matchup, clinching
the Pac-10 regular season title in
the process. Dawkins commented
on how Cal's run last year can fac
tor into this year's game.
"They've got a mature front
line," he said. "They have some vet
erans that have experienced lot of
success, like Gutierrez. The differ
ence in experience poses a challenge
to us."

Lacking significant team experi
ence and without a senior on the
roster, the Cardinal relies on youth.
The Cardinal's freshman core
played a pivotal role in the first
matchup between the teams this
season. In addition to Powell's big
performance, freshman guard
Aaron Bright scored 10 points
while his classmate and fellow
guard, Anthony Brown, chipped in

with 11 points.
Dawkins noted how Saturday's
matchup feels different from the
first one.

"Both teams, absolutely, in two
months have changed," he said.
"Our season is like a lifetime

the players go through so many ex
periences. They start to evolve. For
our team, our identity has some
what changed from then to now.
"You know, probably five out of
our top eight players who are con
tributing are freshmen. We rely on
those kids to bring consistency," he
continued. "They've all got better
and really started to contribute to
what we're trying to accomplish."
Stanford is currently eighth in
the Pac-10, while Cal is holding
onto the fifth spot. Both schools are
jockeying for better positions in
the Pac-10 tournament next week,
as teams in the top six places re
ceive first-round byes in Los Ange
les.

Tip-off is scheduled for 4 p.m. at
Haas Pavilion in Berkeley, Calif.

Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike (13) stretches for a pass during Stanford's 75-51 victory over
rival Cal. The Card finished off a perfect Pac-10 season with its 61st straight home victor/ last night.
"They're a good team," he said.
"They're playing well. Of course,
it's a rival game so I'm sure they'll
be fired up, just as we will. It will be
very competitive and it'll be a great
environment. We look forward to
the challenge."
During Pac-10 play, Cal is 5-3 at
home and the team is looking for its
fourth straight victory. The Bears
are led by junior forward Harper
Kamp (14.4 points per game) and
junior guard Jorge Gutierrez (14.8
ppg and 4.5 assists per game), froth
of whom played well in the first
matchup against the Cardinal.
Kamp had 16 points on the inside
and Gutierrez dished out 8 assists,
his 3rd-highest total this season.
The game should also feature
plenty of outside shooting. Stan
ford will be looking to exploit the
Bears' perimeter play, as Cal is al
lowing opponents to shoot 39 per
cent from beyond the arc in Pac-10

play. In its first meeting with Cal,
Stanford made nine of 17 three
pointers, with Green making four
of them. But Cal itself also shoots
well from the 3-point line, making
40 percent of its threes in Pac-10
games this season.
Last year, the teams also met in
the regular season finale the
Bears won that matchup, clinching
the Pac-10 regular season title in
the process. Dawkins commented
on how Cal's run last year can fac
tor into this year's game.
"They've got a mature front
line," he said. "They have some vet
erans that have experienced lot of
success, like Gutierrez. The differ
ence in experience poses a challenge
to us."

Lacking significant team experi
ence and without a senior on the
roster, the Cardinal relies on youth.
The Cardinal's freshman core
played a pivotal role in the first
matchup between the teams this
season. In addition to Powell's big
performance, freshman guard
Aaron Bright scored 10 points
while his classmate and fellow
guard, Anthony Brown, chipped in

with 11 points.
Dawkins noted how Saturday's
matchup feels different from the
first one.

"Both teams, absolutely, in two
months have changed," he said.
"Our season is like a lifetime

the players go through so many ex
periences. They start to evolve. For
our team, our identity has some
what changed from then to now.
"You know, probably five out of
our top eight players who are con
tributing are freshmen. We rely on
those kids to bring consistency," he
continued. "They've all got better
and really started to contribute to
what we're trying to accomplish."
Stanford is currently eighth in
the Pac-10, while Cal is holding
onto the fifth spot. Both schools are
jockeying for better positions in
the Pac-10 tournament next week,
as teams in the top six places re
ceive first-round byes in Los Ange
les.

Tip-off is scheduled for 4 p.m. at
Haas Pavilion in Berkeley, Calif.
