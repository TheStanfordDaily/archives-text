The 83rd Annual Academy Awards, in an
effort to appeal to a younger demographic,
recruited Anne Hathaway and James Franco
to host the ceremony. However, the new hosts and a
streamlined broadcast were not enough to enliven
the most predictable ceremony in years.
In terms of awards, the Academy delivered few
surprises unless you count the critically panned
"Alice in Wonderland" pulling through to nab
awards in both art direction and costume design.
All of the major awards went as predicted, with
"The King's Speech" finishing out its awards season
dominance, picking up the Oscars in best picture,
best actor, best director and best original screenplay.
Natalie Portman also rode the buzz wave to a
win best actress for "Black Swan," while Melissa Leo
and Christian Bale won in the supporting acting
categories for "The Fighter." The evening was
rounded out by wins in best adapted screenplay and
best soundtrack for "The Social Network," best song
and best animated feature for "Toy Story 3" and a
slew of technical awards for "Inception."
Hosts Anne Hathaway and James Franco
struggled to keep the show going or achieve any
kind of chemistry. From the awkward opening
monologue onward, the pair failed to strike the
right balance between funny and graceful, witty and
playful. Anne Hathaway still deserves points for
effort, or at least for having to carry James Franco all
night. His delivery was lazy; he disappeared from
the ceremony for long periods of time and was gen
erally off-color and boring. At least Anne was obvi
ously trying with her enthusiastic delivery, singing
and shimmying in her ridiculous number of outfit
changes. Franco's one redeeming contribution was
his "Oscar Real Time" photos and videos which he
tweeted throughout the telecast.
Most of the skits fell awfully flat as well, with
the exception of the "Bed Intruder"-style auto-tun

ing of scenes from some of this year's most popular
movies, most notably "Harry Potter and the Deathy
Hallows: Part I," featuring Ron's (Rupert Grint)
auto-tuned voice singing "A Little Ball of Light"
while Hermione (Emma Watson) looked on, scowl
ing. They also riffed on "Toy Story 3," "The Social
Network" and "Twilight: Eclipse." Although it was
obviously pandering to the younger demographic, it
was still a funny skit, especially in the midst of so
many dull musical performances and montages.
Throughout the ceremony, there was also an
odd, seemingly random focus on great Academy
Award-winning films and ceremonies from the
past. This resulted in awkward moments like Cate
Blanchett being introduced with a "Lord of the
Rings" background, a decade-old trilogy which isn't
even her most notable credit, or the ceremony
overemphasizing legendary films from the past like
"Titanic," only to make some of this year's offerings
pale in comparison.

Some of the celebrity presenters, however,
managed to liven up the evening a bit. Sandra
Bullock, presenting the award for best actor, casually
called Jeff Bridges "dude" (perhaps a reference to his
