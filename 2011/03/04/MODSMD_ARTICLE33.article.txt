### 
MILA KUNIS
The "Black Swan" star's Elie Saab
gown managed to exude ele
gance with its delicate lace and
light lilac coloring. While Scarlett
Johansson wore a similar Saab to
the Golden Globes and came off
as dull and dowdy, Kunis kept
things fresh with a flirty peekaboo
bodice.

JENNIFER LAWRENCE
Lawrence may have lost the Oscar
to Natalie Portman, but she
scored some serious fashion cred
in this sexy Calvin Klein number.
Her gentle waves popped against
the perfect, simple cut of the
gown.

NATALIE PORTMAN
Aided by her pregnancy glow,
Portman shone in her deep purple
Rodarte (label founders Kate and
Laura Mulleavy also designed
Portman's "Black Swan" costume).
She accessorized with fun tassel
earrings from Tiffany & Co. to
match her dress and didn't let her
pregnancy stop her from strutting
down the red carpet in Jimmy
Choo heels.

HAILEE STEINFELD
Steinfeld has proven that chic and
age appropriate don't have to be
mutually exclusive. The "True
Grit" star looked adorable in her
custom pale pink Marchesa, top
ping off a stellar red carpet sea
son.

REESE WITHERSPOON
Witherspoon's sleek black and
white Armani Prive stood out in a
sea of volume and lace. A high
bouffant ponytail completed her
60s throwback.
