# WORST DRESSED
## 
### 
MELISSA LEO
Why Leo decided to show up to
the Oscars in a giant, white doily,
we'll never know.

MARISA TOMEI
It's like in "Sleeping Beauty" when
the pink and blue fairies argue
over which color Aurora's dress
should be, except in this case, it
was the tulle fairy versus the satin
fairy, and everyone lost.

NICOLE KIDMAN
In between the garish red shoes
and confusing hip ornamentation,
Kidman's Oscar look was question
able to say the least.

SCARLETT JOHANSSON
It would appear Johansson rolled
out of bed, forgot to comb her
unkempt hair and mistook her
grandma's old purple pantyhose
for an Oscar gown.

HILARY SWANK
Harshly yanked back hair did
Swank no favors nor did the dead
duck feathers attached to the bot
tom of her dress.
