## COFFEE on CAMPUS 
### â€“ evie DANFORTH contact evie: erdanfor@stanford. edu 
Can you read this article without your
hand or eye twitching uncontrollably?
If yes, you probably don't drink
enough coffee. And if you can't, then shine on,
you crazy diamond. Either way, this guide to
getting coffee on campus is for you.

Coupa Cafe Moonbeans may have left foot
prints on my heart that will never fade, but
that shabby little kiosk with a primo location
right outside Green Library is now home to

the Venezuelan-influenced Coupa Cafe.
Coupa's cool because Mark Zuckerberg was

holding a coffee cup with their logo during
"The Social Network." Coupa's sort of un-cool
because their Twitter explains that they feature
food "with the philosophy of the modern slow
food movement promoting organic and fair
trade" a whole bunch of empty jargon that
reminds you that you're maybe paying more
than you should for the premium of the fussy
Coupa brand name. It redeems itself in the
end, though, because the coffee's pretty good,
especially if you like super dark roasts.

Fraiche Most people associate Fraiche with
frozen yogurt, but they also have what's unques
tionably the best coffee on campus. The tiny
outpost at Tresidder serves drip coffee from the
Blue Bottle Roasting Company in Oakland. It's a
roastery founded and run by a coffee connois
seur who was sick of the Starbucks-ification of
coffee drinking, where people care more about
which sickly sweet syrups to inject in their lattes
than about the actual coffee beans themselves.
Blue Bottle focuses on sourcing exceptionally
high-quality beans, which they get to consumers
within 48 hours of roasting. They also stipulate
that anyone who sells Blue Bottle Coffee prepare
each cup individually, so you're guaranteed to be
drinking fresh, unadulterated coffee although
it can take forever to prepare.

CoHo As one might
guess from a place whose

name is an abbreviation of "coffee house," the
CoHo has good coffee. It's also really conven
ient and quick, because the non-espresso
drinks are self-service. They even get bonus
points for being a nice place to sit and drink
your coffee, which contributes to the conven
ience of the experience. My only real problem
with the CoHo is that they also serve decaf
feinated coffee, a product that is a blemish on
Western society.

The Bookstore Coffee at the Stanford book
store only costs 50 cents. Then again, scooping
up a cup of mud and drinking it doesn't cost
anything and probably tastes better. Only drink
this if your coffee budget consists of loose
change you found on the ground, you like the
idea of consuming toxic sludge, or if you are
irrevocably in love with a Bookstore employee
and need any excuse to see him or her.

Brew Your Own Someone once unhelpfully
pointed out that I waste a lot of time and
money in pursuit of coffee and could just brew
my own in the comfort of my dorm room. It's
an interesting idea; I actually even bought
(well, bummed off a friend) my own coffee
maker in response. Unfortunately, brewing
coffee in your room makes the entire room
smell like coffee for hours. Also, my early
morning un-caffeinated state is not competent
enough for complex tasks that require fine
motor skills; the scalding burns just weren't
worth it in the end. Still, it's fun to pick out
your own coffee beans and have an excuse to
buy cute mugs at Anthropologic. The ideal sit
uation might be finding a neighbor who will
make you coffee in their room every morning
and bear the associated costs.
