In a day and age
where overwhelming media marketing is
a given for any high-profile musical artist
releasing new material, Radiohead kept its
advertisement philosophy subtle and simple.
The group's newest album, "The King of
Limbs," was announced via the Radiohead
website on Valentine's Day morning, just five
days before its projected release.
Despite its relatively short length (8 songs,
37 min), "The King of Limbs" is a vastly com
plex collection of songs, and as with every
Radiohead album, the more you listen to it, the
more layers you discover. As a whole, the group
has departed from writing melody-driven
power ballads, and this LP conjures up a con
templative, more abstract feel. "Bloom" is a fre
netic, synth-filled opener that sets the tone for
the album as a complicated one. "Morning Mr.
Magpie" follows with a detached rhythmic feel
between the instruments. Almost funky, its style
may have been inspired by Thom Yorke's time
spent in 2010 with his supergroup side-project
Atoms for Peace. The group was comprised of
longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich,
Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and two
session percussion specialists. At each of their
few shows, Atoms for Peace played through
Thom Yorke's 2006 solo album "The Eraser," a
highly electronic album that the band made
extremely percussive and danceable.
"Little by Little" is a driving, lyrically emo
tional piece, keeping up the agitated feel from
the opening minutes. Yorke reflects in the cho
rus, Tm such a tease and you're such a flirt"
and later sings of how "routines and schedules
drug and kill you" Sounds like Radiohead as
usual.

The heavily electronic "Feral" acts as a
pivot between the two very distinct halves of
the album. "Lotus Flower," the band's latest
single, is quite a masterpiece. The thick, rolling
bass line fills out the track and

complements Yorke's cutting
falsetto perfectly throughout the

song. Watch the official video for a wild per
formance of Yorke jolting and shimmying to
the beat; while certainly not a conventional
music video, it is yet another interesting stylis
tic innovation by the group. Plus, if anything
else, you might find a link to one of the count
less viral videos of his dance moves mashed up
with Beyonce or Lady Gaga.
While it may seem like a downer at first,
"Codex" is one the album s most beautiful songs.
The solid piano chords and melodic line gives the
sensation of being under water, and Jonny
Greenwood's string arrangements are expertly
woven in. "Give Up The Ghost" is a bare but
moving lullaby with loops of Yorke's voice repeat
ing "don't haunt me, don't hurt me' throughout
the song on top of an acoustic guitar.
As the last song, "Separator" is an uncom
monly optimistic closer for a Radiohead

album. Where the closers for the last two

albums have been quite depressing in content,
"Separator" provides a hopeful conclusion to
"BCing of Limbs." Phil Selway's upbeat drum
line and Jonny's light guitar suspensions added
to Yorke's echoing statement of "wake me up"
create an elegant, swirling effect to close out
the album.

Overall, while "The King of Limbs" may
not be blasted and sung along to on a Friday
night, it will certainly give listeners substantial
material to contemplate. Radiohead is certainly
still as innovative and pioneering as it has been
in the past, and this album has been painstak
ingly crafted and recorded with thought. And
with a line like "And if you think this is over,
then you're wrong" in their closing song, we can
expect more great music from Radiohead in
the future.
