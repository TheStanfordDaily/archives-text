## Hop on (Noise) Pop Film, art and music collide in weeklong culture clash in The Bay 
### 
For a city that plays host to two major music
festivals, the end-of-summer romp, Outside
Lands, and the autumn-welcoming revelry,
Treasure Island, The Noise Pop Festival provides
a certain change of pace. The longest running

music festival in the Bay, Noise Pop isn't exactly a
musical respite, but it certainly is a step back. It's a
breather in frenetic times where organizers and
festival-goers desire constant gratification and fre
netically jam together and overlap artists over two
or three days that leaves you mentally exhausted
and sick of any auditory stimuli by the end of the
weekend.

At its core, Noise Pop is simple: transform a
city space into a communal area where the people
can celebrate music, art and film over a week-long
period. Give the people the choice on whether they
want to see Dan Deacon or Alexei Murdoch. Let
the masses out if they want to spend the night in
the Mission or in Oakland. Leave them to figure
out if they'd rather watch a Jose Gonzalez biopic or
go to a Nick Zinner art exhibit.
Last Sunday, the festival celebrated the end of
its 19th year of existence and concluded a memo
rable and definitely eclectic festival that featured
everything from the stylized hip hop of Peanut
Butter Wolf to the stripped-down acoustic per-

formance of Death Cab For Cutie front man, Ben
Gibbard. Whatever your choice, Noise Pop con
tinued to exemplify a standard that places music
and the people first, something festival promoters
have forgotten in their quest for a quick buck.
Here are some of The Daily's picks from the
musical offerings of a memorable Noise Pop
2011:

Geographer (X)
The Independent 2/23

Wednesday night at The Independent was
one to remember. With three of the four acts
sporting connections to the city, the sold-out
hump day show was a local affair capped off by
the headlining brilliance of Geographer.
Yet, before the Bay Area three-piece picked
up their instruments, an eclectic mix of openers
warmed the stage. Funeral Party, hailing from
East L.A, curiously mixed emo-throwback lyrics
with traditional rock jams to entertain a sparse
opening crowd. Female rapper and Stanford grad
K. Flay got lots of love from the hometown
crowd. Building her own beats from
Decemberists and Gossip samples, the suburban
rap queen was on top of her game, changing tem
pos, flipping the bird and dancing across stage as
a true one-woman show. Butterfly Bones com
pleted the trio of opening acts with a brand of
disco-infused synthpop that made them feel like
Chromeo-lite.

Geographer, however, owned the night. The
hometown heroes sounded phenomenal and as
an added bonus, turned out to be great guys with
lead singer Michael Deni taking a break from the
show to return a lost wallet to an audience mem
ber and offer himself as a potential future date.
Deni sounded fantastic, even while adding
the synths, very light electric guitar or electronic
effects. Shoeless drummer Brian Ostreicher cer
tainly played his part, dramatically building up
the beat in the large crescendos present in almost
every song. Nathan Blaz, formerly of St. Vincent,
rocked out on the cello and gave Deni's legato

vocals a perfect bass register to work with.
Geographer opened with arguably three of

their best songs, "Verona," "Paris" and "Can't You
Wait," but with only eight released songs, there
wasn't too much choice. They played their entire
"Animal Shapes" EP, to no one's disappointment,
plus a couple of new songs. The first newly com
posed piece carried on with their light indie pop,
while the other was a much louder, drum-heavy
piece which lent itself more to head banging than
hip swinging. Geographer closed with "Night

Winds," before coming back for an encore per
formance of "Heaven Waits" to exhaust their per
formance arsenal and leave the crowd thoroughly
happy. Charlie Dunn


Aesop Rock & Kimya Dawson
The Great American Music Hall 2/25

In scanning the bill in the build up to Noise Pop, few shows
raised as many question marks as much as the promise of the on
stage collaboration between Aesop Rock and Kimya Dawson. The
thought of Aesop Rock, a.ka. Lan Bavitz, backed by a folk guitar
and the "Juno"-oozing cuteness of one half of the Moldy Peaches
seemed so far off from the traditional turntables and urban snarl
that most could only smile to hide their doubts. Yet that's exactly
what powered the show as the surrealism-fueled doubt was
embraced by Bavitz and Dawson, who bathed in the sheer
strangeness of it all.
In setting the tone for a night of novelty, Dawson opened the
show with a solo set that caught some audience members off
guard. A far cry from underground hip hop, the singer's acoustic
guitar barely conquered the crowd's murmuring as she featured
her characteristic songs jam-packed with autobiographical detail,
lighthearted commentary and wit. From "Beer," which she sang to
celebrate 12 years sober, to the hilarious "Alphabutt," Dawson was
anything but expected given the headliner.
Aesop Rock took over soon after Dawson left the stage. The
New York transplant who currently resides in the Bay awed the
"hometown" and unleashed a flurry of the songs and swag that
have endeared him to hip hop fans for the better part of two
decades, drawing particularly from 2007 release "None Shall Pass"
with songs like "Coffee." Leaving gaps for the beat-building
turntable skills of DJ Big Whiz, Aesop Rock also displayed a
propensity for oddities, allowing friend Jeremy Fish, dressed in a
pig suit, to play kazoo on "Pigs," breaking open a dinosaur pinata
filled on stage and initiating a giveaway of the featured stage art
that caused a massive crowd crush.
Closing the night, Dawson rejoined Bavitz on stage to play a
number of songs from their yet-to-be named collaborative proj
ect. Rapping at a slower tempo, Aesop Rock dropped his lyrics
over warm acoustic rhythm guitar as Dawson provided backup
vocals and choruses on a pair of pleasant and reminiscing tracks.
Yet, after a show with so many twists and turns, the pair chose to
cut the soft ending and closed in fashion to match the night's out
landishness. Joined by friends on stage, they embarked on a fresh
rap duet with a chorus of "Tits up, tits up." Figure that one out.

Ben Gibbard
The Great American Music Hall 2/27

Although Ben Gibbard's written and released music for
nearly 15 years, his image has remained relatively unchanged. For
most, the name evokes an image of a bespectacled and disillu
sioned indie antihero, a melancholic artist whose songs defined
that liminal period between teenage years and young adulthood.
But what happens when that icon grows older, finds new views
and moves on?

On Sunday night, Gibbard closed out Noise Pop 2011 with a
solo set that mixed traditional Death Cab with covers, guest
appearances and new material, but ultimately revealed the singer's
newfound perspective and it wasn't just the opting for contacts

instead of his trademark glasses. In the festivals last show of
2011 at the Great American Music Hall, Gibbard was a changed
individual, an older artist and a more grounded man, whose
recent noteworthiness stems from appearances at baseball
games and a marriage to Zooey Deschanel, not so much
"Transatlanticism" or even 2008 release, "Narrow Stairs."
The headliner took to the stage as a lonely figure. Without
the rest of Death Cab, Gibbard was accompanied by his acoustic
guitar and a grand piano, but cut a completely different charac
ter. Despite bags under his eyes, Gibbard was bright and cheer
ful. He took to his solo set with aplomb in a manner that didn't
exactly match the morose undercurrents of opening songs
"Steadier Footing" and "Title Track." These high spirits lasted
throughout the set, making for an odd contrast with the singer's
song catalogue and reputation, but nonetheless a memorable
show.

Gibbard started the show tactfully, selecting a collection of
songs ofF older Death Cab releases while mixing in songs from
projects with Jay Farrar and later, "Farmer Chords," from a col
laboration with Andrew Kenny of American Analog Set. Some
songs sounded brilliant in the acoustic setting, notably "Cath"
and "Such Great Heights," while others faltered in the stripped
down nature of it all, including "Title And Registration." Also
debuted was the title track ofF Death Cab's new album "Codes
and Keys," a song whose upbeat 50s piano harmonies may sig
nal a new direction For the Pacific Northwest band.
Yet, if anything signaled the changes in Gibbard s
demeanor, it came from the set's surprises. When guest Bob
Mould was called to the stage to play a duet of "If I Can't
Change Your Mind," Gibbard became a nervous fanboy, defer
ential to the Sugar front man while shedding the spotlight to his
boyhood hero. Equally out-of-character, Gibbard professed his
love for country before launching into a cover of Buck Owen's
"Love's Gonna Live Here." Compare that to his cover of Avril
Lavigne's "Complicated," a performance he has yet to live down
to this day.
"To bands thinking about playing ironic covers, don't," he
said. "I like that song, I really did, but my mood has changed
about it."
That mood change was evident on Sunday. Whatever it is
marriage, age, a change of scenery — Gibbard was different.
Indeed, he is still the same brilliant artist, but behind that same
wavy hair lies a change in perspective. With "Codes And Keys"
set to be released in May, we'll see where that new perspective
takes him and Death Cab For Cutie. Ryan Mac

effects. Shoeless drummer Brian Ostreicher cer
tainly played his part, dramatically building up
the beat in the large crescendos present in almost
every song. Nathan Blaz, formerly of St. Vincent,
rocked out on the cello and gave Deni's legato

vocals a perfect bass register to work with.
Geographer opened with arguably three of

their best songs, "Verona," "Paris" and "Can't You
Wait," but with only eight released songs, there
wasn't too much choice. They played their entire
"Animal Shapes" EP, to no one's disappointment,
plus a couple of new songs. The first newly com
posed piece carried on with their light indie pop,
while the other was a much louder, drum-heavy
piece which lent itself more to head banging than
hip swinging. Geographer closed with "Night

Winds," before coming back for an encore per
formance of "Heaven Waits" to exhaust their per
formance arsenal and leave the crowd thoroughly
happy. Charlie Dunn


Aesop Rock & Kimya Dawson
The Great American Music Hall 2/25

In scanning the bill in the build up to Noise Pop, few shows
raised as many question marks as much as the promise of the on
stage collaboration between Aesop Rock and Kimya Dawson. The
thought of Aesop Rock, a.ka. Lan Bavitz, backed by a folk guitar
and the "Juno"-oozing cuteness of one half of the Moldy Peaches
seemed so far off from the traditional turntables and urban snarl
that most could only smile to hide their doubts. Yet that's exactly
what powered the show as the surrealism-fueled doubt was
embraced by Bavitz and Dawson, who bathed in the sheer
strangeness of it all.
In setting the tone for a night of novelty, Dawson opened the
show with a solo set that caught some audience members off
guard. A far cry from underground hip hop, the singer's acoustic
guitar barely conquered the crowd's murmuring as she featured
her characteristic songs jam-packed with autobiographical detail,
lighthearted commentary and wit. From "Beer," which she sang to
celebrate 12 years sober, to the hilarious "Alphabutt," Dawson was
anything but expected given the headliner.
Aesop Rock took over soon after Dawson left the stage. The
New York transplant who currently resides in the Bay awed the
"hometown" and unleashed a flurry of the songs and swag that
have endeared him to hip hop fans for the better part of two
decades, drawing particularly from 2007 release "None Shall Pass"
with songs like "Coffee." Leaving gaps for the beat-building
turntable skills of DJ Big Whiz, Aesop Rock also displayed a
propensity for oddities, allowing friend Jeremy Fish, dressed in a
pig suit, to play kazoo on "Pigs," breaking open a dinosaur pinata
filled on stage and initiating a giveaway of the featured stage art
that caused a massive crowd crush.
Closing the night, Dawson rejoined Bavitz on stage to play a
number of songs from their yet-to-be named collaborative proj
ect. Rapping at a slower tempo, Aesop Rock dropped his lyrics
over warm acoustic rhythm guitar as Dawson provided backup
vocals and choruses on a pair of pleasant and reminiscing tracks.
Yet, after a show with so many twists and turns, the pair chose to
cut the soft ending and closed in fashion to match the night's out
landishness. Joined by friends on stage, they embarked on a fresh
rap duet with a chorus of "Tits up, tits up." Figure that one out.

Ben Gibbard
The Great American Music Hall 2/27

Although Ben Gibbard's written and released music for
nearly 15 years, his image has remained relatively unchanged. For
most, the name evokes an image of a bespectacled and disillu
sioned indie antihero, a melancholic artist whose songs defined
that liminal period between teenage years and young adulthood.
But what happens when that icon grows older, finds new views
and moves on?

On Sunday night, Gibbard closed out Noise Pop 2011 with a
solo set that mixed traditional Death Cab with covers, guest
appearances and new material, but ultimately revealed the singer's
newfound perspective and it wasn't just the opting for contacts

instead of his trademark glasses. In the festivals last show of
2011 at the Great American Music Hall, Gibbard was a changed
individual, an older artist and a more grounded man, whose
recent noteworthiness stems from appearances at baseball
games and a marriage to Zooey Deschanel, not so much
"Transatlanticism" or even 2008 release, "Narrow Stairs."
The headliner took to the stage as a lonely figure. Without
the rest of Death Cab, Gibbard was accompanied by his acoustic
guitar and a grand piano, but cut a completely different charac
ter. Despite bags under his eyes, Gibbard was bright and cheer
ful. He took to his solo set with aplomb in a manner that didn't
exactly match the morose undercurrents of opening songs
"Steadier Footing" and "Title Track." These high spirits lasted
throughout the set, making for an odd contrast with the singer's
song catalogue and reputation, but nonetheless a memorable
show.

Gibbard started the show tactfully, selecting a collection of
songs ofF older Death Cab releases while mixing in songs from
projects with Jay Farrar and later, "Farmer Chords," from a col
laboration with Andrew Kenny of American Analog Set. Some
songs sounded brilliant in the acoustic setting, notably "Cath"
and "Such Great Heights," while others faltered in the stripped
down nature of it all, including "Title And Registration." Also
debuted was the title track ofF Death Cab's new album "Codes
and Keys," a song whose upbeat 50s piano harmonies may sig
nal a new direction For the Pacific Northwest band.
Yet, if anything signaled the changes in Gibbard s
demeanor, it came from the set's surprises. When guest Bob
Mould was called to the stage to play a duet of "If I Can't
Change Your Mind," Gibbard became a nervous fanboy, defer
ential to the Sugar front man while shedding the spotlight to his
boyhood hero. Equally out-of-character, Gibbard professed his
love for country before launching into a cover of Buck Owen's
"Love's Gonna Live Here." Compare that to his cover of Avril
Lavigne's "Complicated," a performance he has yet to live down
to this day.
"To bands thinking about playing ironic covers, don't," he
said. "I like that song, I really did, but my mood has changed
about it."
That mood change was evident on Sunday. Whatever it is
marriage, age, a change of scenery — Gibbard was different.
Indeed, he is still the same brilliant artist, but behind that same
wavy hair lies a change in perspective. With "Codes And Keys"
set to be released in May, we'll see where that new perspective
takes him and Death Cab For Cutie. Ryan Mac

For a city that plays host to two major music
festivals, the end-of-summer romp, Outside
Lands, and the autumn-welcoming revelry,
Treasure Island, The Noise Pop Festival provides
a certain change of pace. The longest running

music festival in the Bay, Noise Pop isn't exactly a
musical respite, but it certainly is a step back. It's a
breather in frenetic times where organizers and
festival-goers desire constant gratification and fre
netically jam together and overlap artists over two
or three days that leaves you mentally exhausted
and sick of any auditory stimuli by the end of the
weekend.

At its core, Noise Pop is simple: transform a
city space into a communal area where the people
can celebrate music, art and film over a week-long
period. Give the people the choice on whether they
want to see Dan Deacon or Alexei Murdoch. Let
the masses out if they want to spend the night in
the Mission or in Oakland. Leave them to figure
out if they'd rather watch a Jose Gonzalez biopic or
go to a Nick Zinner art exhibit.
Last Sunday, the festival celebrated the end of
its 19th year of existence and concluded a memo
rable and definitely eclectic festival that featured
everything from the stylized hip hop of Peanut
Butter Wolf to the stripped-down acoustic per-

formance of Death Cab For Cutie front man, Ben
Gibbard. Whatever your choice, Noise Pop con
tinued to exemplify a standard that places music
and the people first, something festival promoters
have forgotten in their quest for a quick buck.
Here are some of The Daily's picks from the
musical offerings of a memorable Noise Pop
2011:

Geographer (X)
The Independent 2/23

Wednesday night at The Independent was
one to remember. With three of the four acts
sporting connections to the city, the sold-out
hump day show was a local affair capped off by
the headlining brilliance of Geographer.
Yet, before the Bay Area three-piece picked
up their instruments, an eclectic mix of openers
warmed the stage. Funeral Party, hailing from
East L.A, curiously mixed emo-throwback lyrics
with traditional rock jams to entertain a sparse
opening crowd. Female rapper and Stanford grad
K. Flay got lots of love from the hometown
crowd. Building her own beats from
Decemberists and Gossip samples, the suburban
rap queen was on top of her game, changing tem
pos, flipping the bird and dancing across stage as
a true one-woman show. Butterfly Bones com
pleted the trio of opening acts with a brand of
disco-infused synthpop that made them feel like
Chromeo-lite.

Geographer, however, owned the night. The
hometown heroes sounded phenomenal and as
an added bonus, turned out to be great guys with
lead singer Michael Deni taking a break from the
show to return a lost wallet to an audience mem
ber and offer himself as a potential future date.
Deni sounded fantastic, even while adding
the synths, very light electric guitar or electronic
effects. Shoeless drummer Brian Ostreicher cer
tainly played his part, dramatically building up
the beat in the large crescendos present in almost
every song. Nathan Blaz, formerly of St. Vincent,

over warm acoustic rhythm guitar as Dawson provided backup
vocals and choruses on a pair of pleasant and reminiscing tracks.
Yet, after a show with so many twists and turns, the pair chose to
cut the soft ending and closed in fashion to match the night's out
landishness. Joined by friends on stage, they embarked on a fresh
rap duet with a chorus of "Tits up, tits up." Figure that one out.

Ben Gibbard
The Great American Music Hall 2/27

Although Ben Gibbard's written and released music for
nearly 15 years, his image has remained relatively unchanged. For
most, the name evokes an image of a bespectacled and disillu
sioned indie antihero, a melancholic artist whose songs defined
that liminal period between teenage years and young adulthood.
But what happens when that icon grows older, finds new views
and moves on?

On Sunday night, Gibbard closed out Noise Pop 2011 with a
solo set that mixed traditional Death Cab with covers, guest
appearances and new material, but ultimately revealed the singer's
newfound perspective and it wasn't just the opting for contacts

instead of his trademark glasses. In the festivals last show of
2011 at the Great American Music Hall, Gibbard was a changed
individual, an older artist and a more grounded man, whose
recent noteworthiness stems from appearances at baseball
games and a marriage to Zooey Deschanel, not so much
"Transatlanticism" or even 2008 release, "Narrow Stairs."
The headliner took to the stage as a lonely figure. Without
the rest of Death Cab, Gibbard was accompanied by his acoustic
guitar and a grand piano, but cut a completely different charac
ter. Despite bags under his eyes, Gibbard was bright and cheer
ful. He took to his solo set with aplomb in a manner that didn't
exactly match the morose undercurrents of opening songs
"Steadier Footing" and "Title Track." These high spirits lasted
throughout the set, making for an odd contrast with the singer's
song catalogue and reputation, but nonetheless a memorable
show.

Gibbard started the show tactfully, selecting a collection of
songs ofF older Death Cab releases while mixing in songs from
projects with Jay Farrar and later, "Farmer Chords," from a col
laboration with Andrew Kenny of American Analog Set. Some
songs sounded brilliant in the acoustic setting, notably "Cath"
and "Such Great Heights," while others faltered in the stripped
down nature of it all, including "Title And Registration." Also
debuted was the title track ofF Death Cab's new album "Codes
and Keys," a song whose upbeat 50s piano harmonies may sig
nal a new direction For the Pacific Northwest band.
Yet, if anything signaled the changes in Gibbard s
demeanor, it came from the set's surprises. When guest Bob
Mould was called to the stage to play a duet of "If I Can't
Change Your Mind," Gibbard became a nervous fanboy, defer
ential to the Sugar front man while shedding the spotlight to his
boyhood hero. Equally out-of-character, Gibbard professed his
love for country before launching into a cover of Buck Owen's
"Love's Gonna Live Here." Compare that to his cover of Avril
Lavigne's "Complicated," a performance he has yet to live down
to this day.
"To bands thinking about playing ironic covers, don't," he
said. "I like that song, I really did, but my mood has changed
about it."
That mood change was evident on Sunday. Whatever it is
marriage, age, a change of scenery — Gibbard was different.
Indeed, he is still the same brilliant artist, but behind that same
wavy hair lies a change in perspective. With "Codes And Keys"
set to be released in May, we'll see where that new perspective
takes him and Death Cab For Cutie. Ryan Mac
