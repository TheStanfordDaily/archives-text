## Hop on (Noise) Pop Film, art and music collide in weeklong culture clash in The Bay 
### 
For a city that plays host to two major music
festivals, the end-of-summer romp, Outside
Lands, and the autumn-welcoming revelry,
Treasure Island, The Noise Pop Festival provides
a certain change of pace. The longest running

music festival in the Bay, Noise Pop isn't exactly a
musical respite, but it certainly is a step back. It's a
breather in frenetic times where organizers and
festival-goers desire constant gratification and fre
netically jam together and overlap artists over two
or three days that leaves you mentally exhausted
and sick of any auditory stimuli by the end of the
weekend.

At its core, Noise Pop is simple: transform a
city space into a communal area where the people
can celebrate music, art and film over a week-long
period. Give the people the choice on whether they
want to see Dan Deacon or Alexei Murdoch. Let
the masses out if they want to spend the night in
the Mission or in Oakland. Leave them to figure
out if they'd rather watch a Jose Gonzalez biopic or
go to a Nick Zinner art exhibit.
Last Sunday, the festival celebrated the end of
its 19th year of existence and concluded a memo
rable and definitely eclectic festival that featured
everything from the stylized hip hop of Peanut
Butter Wolf to the stripped-down acoustic per-

formance of Death Cab For Cutie front man, Ben
Gibbard. Whatever your choice, Noise Pop con
tinued to exemplify a standard that places music
and the people first, something festival promoters
have forgotten in their quest for a quick buck.
Here are some of The Daily's picks from the
musical offerings of a memorable Noise Pop
2011:

Geographer (X)
The Independent 2/23

Wednesday night at The Independent was
one to remember. With three of the four acts
sporting connections to the city, the sold-out
hump day show was a local affair capped off by
the headlining brilliance of Geographer.
Yet, before the Bay Area three-piece picked
up their instruments, an eclectic mix of openers
warmed the stage. Funeral Party, hailing from
East L.A, curiously mixed emo-throwback lyrics
with traditional rock jams to entertain a sparse
opening crowd. Female rapper and Stanford grad
K. Flay got lots of love from the hometown
crowd. Building her own beats from
Decemberists and Gossip samples, the suburban
rap queen was on top of her game, changing tem
pos, flipping the bird and dancing across stage as
a true one-woman show. Butterfly Bones com
pleted the trio of opening acts with a brand of
disco-infused synthpop that made them feel like
Chromeo-lite.

Geographer, however, owned the night. The
hometown heroes sounded phenomenal and as
an added bonus, turned out to be great guys with
lead singer Michael Deni taking a break from the
show to return a lost wallet to an audience mem
ber and offer himself as a potential future date.
Deni sounded fantastic, even while adding
the synths, very light electric guitar or electronic
effects. Shoeless drummer Brian Ostreicher cer
tainly played his part, dramatically building up
the beat in the large crescendos present in almost
every song. Nathan Blaz, formerly of St. Vincent,
rocked out on the cello and gave Deni's legato

vocals a perfect bass register to work with.
Geographer opened with arguably three of

their best songs, "Verona," "Paris" and "Can't You
Wait," but with only eight released songs, there
wasn't too much choice. They played their entire
"Animal Shapes" EP, to no one's disappointment,
plus a couple of new songs. The first newly com
posed piece carried on with their light indie pop,
while the other was a much louder, drum-heavy
piece which lent itself more to head banging than
hip swinging. Geographer closed with "Night

Winds," before coming back for an encore per
formance of "Heaven Waits" to exhaust their per
formance arsenal and leave the crowd thoroughly
happy. Charlie Dunn
