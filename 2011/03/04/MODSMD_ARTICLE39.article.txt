## WORTH THE WAIT

If you've been pounding goom
bas and grinding experience
points for as long as I have, you'll
remember a time when new hard
ware was an almost annual occur
rence. The market was explosive, and
we had machine after machine sit
ting under our Christmas trees each
year —the Saturn and Play Station
in '95, Nintendo 64 in '96,
Gameboy Color in '97 and

Dreamcast in '99, to name a few.
Things are different now. With

HD displays and a casual market that boosts long-term sales
and console updates from the Internet, the Big Three—
Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo, for the uninitiated —are free
to sit on their golden geese. Even five or six years after releasing
their most recent hardware, the gaming trinity has yet to
announce another proper, big-screen console.

But regardless, we're about to get something new. It's not
big in a literal sense, but it's already a huge hit
A week ago today, Nintendo launched its newest hand
held, the 3DS, in Japan. The initial shipment 0f400,000 units
sold out immediately, and CEO Satoru Iwata expects to ship
1.5 million in the region by the end of March. Stateside, the
3DS is raking in cash even three weeks ahead of its March 27
release —the Cosmo Black and Aqua Blue SKUs ranked sec
ond and seventh on retail-giant Gamestop's top-10 sales list
last week. All that comes despite a hefty price tag of $250, the
most expensive that handheld-king Nintendo has ever put on

a portable.
11l admit that the prolonged hardware hiatus has me a
little starved for something new, but either way, I'm dying to
get my paws on the Big N s new gadget
For those of you who don't know, Nintendo thought it
might be smart to follow up the best-selling game hardware
of all time —the original DS just hit 145 million—and they
threw in the kitchen sink

Lets start with the big draw: glasses-free 3D. That's right,
stereoscopic depth with no Star Trek shades. I won't get into
the tech behind it here, but you should check it out (By the
way, don't be surprised to see glasses-free 3D on big-screen
TVs in a fewyears.)

It's not just a gimmick, either, if dozens of journalists and
400,000 Japanese fans are to be believed. Nintendo has been
toying with 3D tech for a long time, from the Virtual Boy to
an unreleased Gamecube add-on, and in 2011, the time is
definitely right for a new kind of 3D.fbu need to see it to
believe it, but I guarantee that any kid who plays a 3DS in the
mall will be begging for one until it's his or hers.
Developers will need a little more time to warm up to
3D and learn how to integrate it into new kinds of gameplay

—to learn
whether 3D
is a spice
or a meat,

as it were. We've

seen this before, though, with analog, touch and
motion controls. Nintendo is keenly aware of
i this, and wisely included a built-in slider to
' adjust the strength of the 3D effect
Beyond that, the 3DS is—or at least

has the chance to be —a love letter to the hard
core fans, a demographic that Nintendo has
put on the back burner while casual gamers are
content to waggle their Wii-motes. We're talk
ing full analog control, gyroscopes, a touch

screen, a microphone, a pedometer, augmented reality games,
internet browsing, front- and rear-facing cameras that can
read faces and take 3D photos and a processor that can render
graphics on par with early36o games, if you scale for resolu
tion. More importantly, though, the device has overwhelming
third-party support and gives Nintendo the chance to reintro
duce classics like Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Star Fox 64 in
brilliant 3D.
It's also an opportunity to correct some mistakes of
Nintendo's yesteryear, like a frustrating, code-based online
service and terrible support for downloadables. We'll have to
wait until the service launches in May to judge, but early indi
cations are positive.
It's hard not to let myself get giddy whenever there's
new hardware on the horizon, yet I've been let down
enough times (I'm looking at you, Wii) to know that I
shouldn't take anything for granted. But with the 3DS, my
heart and mind are this close to agreeing. Nintendo has
lightning in a bottle —I just hope they're careful opening it
