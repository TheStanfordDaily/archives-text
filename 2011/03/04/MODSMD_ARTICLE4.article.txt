## Stanford faces off against No. 6 Texas 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford baseball takes a No. 9
ranking and a two-game win streak
into Austin on Friday, facing No. 6
Texas in a three-game series that's
set to be one of the NCAA's best
this weekend.

The marquee matchup pits two
highly acclaimed teams against one
another, but difficult games are
nothing new for the Cardinal (5-3),
which started the season with seven
straight games against ranked
teams preceding this weekend's se
ries.

"We've had a real difficult sched
ule, but we've held our own," said
head coach Mark Marquess. "It
shows us what weaknesses we have
and what we need to improve ...

hopefully we can finish it out before
they take finals."
Stanford certainly has per
formed as well as one could expect,
with its only series loss coming at

shortstop from Menlo Park has also driven in six runs and leads the team into a three-game series at Texas.
the hands of third-ranked Vander
bilt.The Cardinal will try to avoid a
similar fate in its second series
against a top-10 team this season.
The Longhorns sport a strong
starting rotation that is sure to chal
lenge the talented Cardinal staff,
which will go without starting jun
ior Brett Mooneyham for the rest
of the season due to a hand injury.
Mooneyham's spot has been taken
by sophomore Mark Appel, who
pitched six good innings in a losing
2-1 effort last Friday at Vanderbilt.
Appel's job won't get any easier
this week, as he is slated to face Tay
lor Jungmann who has pitched
two consecutive complete-game
shutouts for the Longhorns —in
the 1 p.m. opener.
Sunday's probable starter for
Texas, Hoby Milner, has been near
ly as perfect, allowing just one
earned run in 11 innings pitched.
Jungmann and Milner have struck
out 31 batters and given up just 16
hits in their five combined appear
ances.
"The approach doesn't change
much at this point," said junior re
liever A.J. Talt, who pitched 2.1
solid innings in relief en route to
an 8-4 win against Santa Clara on
Tuesday. "We've been facing good
pitchers pretty much every week."
Stanford will need all the runs it
can get against the Longhorns
Talt and the rest of the pitching
staff have powerful Texas hitters to
hold at bay, including Erich Weiss,
who has hit .538 and knocked in
eight runs in as many games. The
Cardinal relievers have gotten the
job done so far Stanford is 4-0
in games in which they held the
lead after six innings.
The pitching staff will need to
be supported this weekend from a

young Stanford lineup that fea
tures seven underclassmen. Stand
out sophomore outfielder Jake
Stewart, who has hit safely in seven
of eight games this season and
posted a .394 average, explains
that the team will continue focus
ing on fundamentals as they pre
pare for the Longhorns.
"We've struck out a little more
than we've wanted to the last cou
ple of weekends, so we're just
going to keep on that," Stewart
said. "We'll keep working on stay
ing relaxed and hitting line drives
up the middle, and our pitchers are
going to keep working on throwing
strikes."
Sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger has been just as im
pressive as Stewart. The Cardinal's
top hitter last season, Diekroeger
leads the team with six RBI and a
.441 average. Die duo has helped
make the top of Stanford's lineup a
formidable one.
"[Diekroeger's] just a good hit
ter. He stays inside the ball, you
can't get him out with one pitch,
and he hits a breaking ball like a
fastball," Marquess said. "Stew
art's been swinging the bat very
well lately too. He also gives us a
really good speed tool, and he
plays real good defense in center
field."
The pair's contributions will be
crucial for Stanford, which has out
hit its opponents in six games this
season, five of them wins.
"It's going to be awesome to go
down there and play in front of
6,000 or 7,000 people," Stewart
said. "That Saturday game's al
ready sold out. It's going to be an
exciting environment to play in."
The tough series will be fol
lowed by a Finals Week break for
Stanford, which won't see action
again until March 18 against Michi
gan.

Stanford will need all the runs it
can get against the Longhorns
Talt and the rest of the pitching
staff have powerful Texas hitters to
hold at bay, including Erich Weiss,
who has hit .538 and knocked in
eight runs in as many games. The
Cardinal relievers have gotten the
job done so far Stanford is 4-0
in games in which they held the
lead after six innings.
The pitching staff will need to
be supported this weekend from a

young Stanford lineup that fea
tures seven underclassmen. Stand
out sophomore outfielder Jake
Stewart, who has hit safely in seven
of eight games this season and
posted a .394 average, explains
that the team will continue focus
ing on fundamentals as they pre
pare for the Longhorns.
"We've struck out a little more
than we've wanted to the last cou
ple of weekends, so we're just
going to keep on that," Stewart
said. "We'll keep working on stay
ing relaxed and hitting line drives
up the middle, and our pitchers are
going to keep working on throwing
strikes."
Sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger has been just as im
pressive as Stewart. The Cardinal's
top hitter last season, Diekroeger
leads the team with six RBI and a
.441 average. Die duo has helped
make the top of Stanford's lineup a
formidable one.
"[Diekroeger's] just a good hit
ter. He stays inside the ball, you
can't get him out with one pitch,
and he hits a breaking ball like a
fastball," Marquess said. "Stew
art's been swinging the bat very
well lately too. He also gives us a
really good speed tool, and he
plays real good defense in center
field."
The pair's contributions will be
crucial for Stanford, which has out
hit its opponents in six games this
season, five of them wins.
"It's going to be awesome to go
down there and play in front of
6,000 or 7,000 people," Stewart
said. "That Saturday game's al
ready sold out. It's going to be an
exciting environment to play in."
The tough series will be fol
lowed by a Finals Week break for
Stanford, which won't see action
again until March 18 against Michi
gan.
