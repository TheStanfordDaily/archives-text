Aided by rising stars Mia Wasikowska
as the title character opposite Michael
Fassbender as Mr. Rochester, director
(and Oakland native) Cary Fukunaga breathes
new life into Charlotte Bronte's coming-of-age

classic "Jane Eyre." Beautifully shot on location in northern England with a
well-rounded cast that includes Judi Dench and Jamie Bell, the film occa
sionally falters over a screenplay that doesn't quite do the novel justice.
We begin somewhere in the middle of Jane Eyre's tale, following her
as she runs away from an as-of-yet undisclosed place and wanders helpless
ly through the gloomy, English countryside before being taken in by the
devout St. John Rivers (Bell). As her childhood and adolescence unfold
through flashbacks, it becomes clear that Jane's life consists of a series of
unfortunate events, including a spiteful aunt (Sally Hawkins) and the death

of her only friend at boarding
school. Upon coming of age, Jane
sets out to become a governess at
Thornfield Hall, where she
befriends the elitist but well
meaning housekeeper Mrs.
Fairfax (Dench) and encounters
the estate's master, the enigmatic
Mr. Rochester. Seeing through
her austere exterior, Rochester is
drawn to Jane's inner strength,
and the two strike up an unlikely
rapport that gradually escalates
into romance. But just when it
seems Jane may finally achieve
happiness for the first time,
ghosts from Rochester's past

resurface, threatening the well-being of both her and Rochester.
Fassbender, still relatively unknown to American audiences despite
growing popularity in his native Europe, captures the volatility and charm
of a good man who has gradually been worn down by the secrets he is
forced to keep. His intensity is matched by Wasikowska's nuanced perform
ance as an alternately passive and poised young woman who remains
undaunted despite the misfortunes that continually beset her. Their chem
istry, as Rochester and Jane, is organic; the sexual tension between them,
almost tangible.
Visually, Fukunaga captures the novel's Gothic character with rich
detail and expert cinematography. By day, Thornfield's panoramic win-

dows reveal the gorgeous, sprawling
grounds outside and the manor's
exquisite furnishings that denote
Rochester's social standing. At night,
however, all is cast into darkness, sus

the tenuous glow of the candles that
guide the characters through the
labyrinthine house.
Unfortunately, not even a combi
nation of great acting and gripping
mis-en-scene is enough to compensate

for the uneven script, which in this
case falls to screenwriter Moira
Buffini. While "lane Eyre" starts off
strong, injecting just enough humor to
make the esoteric language appeal to
modern viewers, things start to lose
steam as the plot progresses. The
exchanges between Jane and
Rochester, once rife with flirtation,
become lackluster, and the movie
begins to drag. Eventually, it regains its
footing, but doesn't manage to end on

as high a note as it began.
The bottom line: "Jane Eyre"
noobs like me may be satisfied (I for
went the book in high school in favor
of the Spark Notes edition), but die
hard fans are likely to be left hanging.
(I brought along a more accomplished
reader who enjoyed it, but was both

Even when everything else is well-exe
cuted, the writing just isn't up to par,
which is a great shame, given the
material's literary heritage.
