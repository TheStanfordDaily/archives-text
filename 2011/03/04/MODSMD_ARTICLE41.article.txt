## RECREATIONAL FUN 
### 
Relay race handoffs are notori
ously tricky, but the passing of
the comedy baton from "The
Office" to "Parks and Recreation," in
the hands of Greg Daniels and
Michael Schur, makes it look easy. The
pair has a reputation for building their
cast of actors around individuals

("Parks and Rec" is no exception
check out Amy Poehler, Aziz Ansari
and Rashida Jones) and remolding
them into an ensemble. "The Office"
manifests the wear and tear of seven
seasons by breaking these rules: now
we find watered-down relationships
and great triumphs for Michael or

Andy at the expense of the group. The
American adaptation is, at its root, a
"will-they-or-won't-they" show,

whether you're looking at Jim and
Pam's early flirtation or Michael's per

petual obliviousness. "Parks and
Recreation" succeeds because it,
unlike "The Office," integrates experi
mentation into the fabric of its charac
ters, plot and sense of humor.
Even in six episodes of season
three, the arrival of new characters,
Rob Lowe and Adam Scott as state
auditors brought in to curb the spend
ing of the department, has already
changed the behavior of the regular.
Take Rashida fones's Ann Perkins, for
example; her romantic relationship
with Rob Lowe's perky Chris plunges
her head first into cutesy, unreserved
love in away that Andy or Mark never
could. When Chris breaks up with her,
she doesn't realize it, because no one
has ever dumped her. The willingness
of the show's writers to paint this life
altering moment for the character as
normal for the show's arc encapsulates
its commitment to the ensemble. The
moment is more of a set than a spike,
to borrow volleyball terminology, as
Leslie comes in to comfort Ann with a
jump-cut monologue of all the times
she has been dumped. On "The
Office," Jones's Karen was a symbolic,
not fundamental, change in Jim's life,
such that his character remained
intact for his reunion with Pam.

"Shippers," or those who watch TV
shows solely to root for their favorite
couple, will find little material in
"Parks and Recreation" to sustain their
need for drama.
The closest "Parks and Rec"
comes to a "shipper" relationship is
Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) and
his crazy Eve for the 21st century,
Tammy (played perfectly by
Offerman's real-life wife, Megan
Mullally). Ron Effing Swanson is a
man who loves intensely, from steak to
breakfast buffets to guns to Bobby
Knight to dark-haired women. His
character arc similarly subjugates
greater imperatives, such as his rela
tionship with his coworker Tom's ex
wife, to the episodic plots of coaching
a youth basketball team; the two lay
ers, however, always find away to
mesh such that the characters do not
exist as islands. When Tammy and

Ron reunited this season, the episode
communicated their intense sexual
passion in only a montage. Instead, it
focused on the foreplay and the morn
ing after, to particularly humorous
effect with Ron's workplace interven
tion. The main tension of the episode

when will Ron return to his senses
resolved itself around Tom
Haverford (the inimitable Aziz
Ansari), who gets over his jealousy of
Ron to break up the wedding shower
and explain Tammy's insanity. In
both the plot events and conceit of
the show, the well-manicured
fronts these characters put on con
sciously or not from Leslie's
earnestness to April's sarcasm are
tested to the breaking point, when
humanity peeks through.
Speaking of, April and Andy
have become my new favorite part of
the show. These polar opposite char
acters initially bothered me with their
one-note contributions as foils for

Ron or Ann, but the show's new
emphasis on plot has given them
more to do. The arrival of the audi
tors finds April employed under
Chris's regime of positivity, albeit
temporarily, while Andy is empow
ered to coach the other kids' basket
ball team. As such, they are able to
have an active relationship, not one
built on the teasing stasis that defined
three years of Jim and Pam. It's
unclear how long they'll last, but, just
as they embraced their mutual
broke-ness at the bar, the show is
embracing their contradictory
natures and testing them out in the
real world of plot.
"Parks and Recreation" is like a
dessert at a fancy restaurant: you feel
comfortable ordering a dessert with
kumquat or star anise because you
trust the institution. In its new season,
the show is taking risks with more
"artistic" cinematography, the plant of
the Harvest Festival and the lingering
