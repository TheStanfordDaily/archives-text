three episodes before the
season one finale, but don't
worry! The second season
will drop this summer. (ABC
Family)
Monday at 9 p.m.: Get
some "Two and a Half Men"
while you still can. Or just
watch some Charlie Sheen
interviews. (CBS)
Wednesday at 8 p.m.:
"America's Next Top Model" is
back! The last season I remem
ber is the one with Saleisha,
but they say that's how addicts

Need inspiration to lose
weight and find a mate? Stay
tuned for "Shedding for the

Yes to the Dress." (The CW)

question of the new series regulars
Scott and Lowe. I, however, would
trust my sweet tooth and my TV
addiction to the hands of Daniels,
Schur, Poehler, Ansari, Plaza and Jones
any day.
