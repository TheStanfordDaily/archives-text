## comedy Stealing laughs in 'LoLcatraz'

Living in Silicon Valley, it seems
like everything is getting
upgraded at an exponential
rate. The new iPad 2 is out and, low
and behold, Robber Barons sketch
comedy has finally mastered the elu
sive features of PowerPoint. In its
winter show, "Escape from
LoLcatraz," the team uses technology
to go bigger, better and a little more
naked than ever before.
Although the Robber Barons
always cover the comedy spectrum
pretty thoroughly in their shows,
they tend to be the strongest in
sketches about bizarre characters.
"LoLcatraz" delivers more of the
same with "Camp," "Pigeonman" and
the infamous game "F/M/K." In this
show, however, I think the Barons
finally make a breakthrough by cre
ating characters and satirizing events
that are a little more true to life.
In "Teach For America,"
arguably the best written sketch of
the night, Sam Clanon 'l3 portrays
what goes hilariously wrong when
new teachers have a little too much
enthusiasm for their new position of
power. Other gems include a Benny
Hill-flavored debate between
Nietzsche and God, a clever redneck
satire piece in the form of a paintball
rivalry and a passionate competition
over who can parody popular '9os
rock songs best.
However, my two favorite
sketches use technology in the most
inventive way I've seen from the
Robber Barons. In the first techno
logical masterpiece, a boy is asked to

give a PowerPoint presentation for
his absent father. The sketch is funny,
creative, insightful and totally relat
able. We've all pulled our hair out
with frustration when looking at lec
ture slides after missing a class, only
to realize the whole thing is pictures.
But when someone else has to do it,
it's downright hilarious. Finally, in
the last great sketch of the night,
Stanford departments fight to the
death in "Mortal Kombat"-style.
What are they fighting for? The glory
that is TSF funding. Only the (ques
tionably) best will survive.
"LoLcatraz" is free for students
and $lO for the general public. Show
times are 8 p.m. tonight and tomor
row in the Geology Corner Lecture
Hall (320-105). If you're worried
about getting a seat, fret not. The
Robber Barons have also discovered
the wonders of online seat reserva
tions. To get yours, visit: http://rob
