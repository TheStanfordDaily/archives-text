## STUDENT LIFE Samuels to spruce up Tree role New mascot aims to be as 'awesome and idiotic as Charlie Sheen 
### DANA EDWARDS STAFF WRITER 
A week of thrilling and absurd stunts
came to a close early Thursday morning
when Mike Samuels 'll was crowned the
new Stanford Tree, Samuels will succeed
Ben "Bollox" Cortes 'll as the official
band mascot, whose duties include foster
ing school spirit, dancing erratically and
possibly fighting rival mascots at major
sporting events.

Following the announcement, The
Daily sat down with Samuels at the CoHo
for a brief interview. With several band
aged battle wounds, he looked understand
ably harried from the last week, but
seemed content and grateful to have been
selected as Tree,
The Stanford Daily (TSD): You expressed
that you're comfortable looking like an
idiot, as the position of Tree entails. What's
the most idiotic thing about you?
Mike Samuels (MS): I don't make a lot of
great decisions. I let people taze me and hit
golf balls at me.
TSD: What do you think distinguished you
from the other saplings?
MS: I must have wanted it more. I put a lot
of time into my stunts and I did them with
more energy. As some members of the
band told me, it wasn't a competition be
tween people, but rather a week to see the
Tree emerge among the people, I guess I
emerged as the true Tree.

TSD: What does the Tree position repre
sent to you?
MS: It represents the spirit of Stanford, a
way of life, away of getting all the craziness
and quirkiness into one singular being. I'm
happy to do my best to make that happen.
TSD: This year's Tree was lauded by some
for its innovation and criticized by others

for looking like a broccoli stalk. What kind
of tree will you be? How will you construct
the costume?
MS: I'm in between two main ideas. I'm
from L.A., so I might go with a palm tree,
but that doesn't always look great when
you're spinning around. A tree with more
leaves looks better. So I might go for a

more classic redwood, with little adjust
ments here and there.

TSD: So you're going to go for traditional
evergreen over deciduous?
MS: Probably. And I have no idea how I'm
going to make it.
TSD: How would you describe your tree
dancing technique?
MS: A process in the works. I'm going to
have to find a happy medium between
going balls-to-the wall and conserving en
ergy. Bollox does a lot of gesticulating with
his hands, so I'll do something like that
when I get really tired.
TSD: Describe your stunts. Which one was
the most insane? Which one was your fa
vorite to do?
MS: My favorite was probably the "Trojan
Trojan." I made a six-foot penis that I could
fit inside. I then rolled it out to the Quad,
where there was the Oregon Duck and
Cal's Oski the Bear. Just like the tradition
al story, the others thought [the Trojan
penis] was a prize, but then I popped out
and vanquished them all.
For another fun stunt, I put a bunch of
inflatable pool animals and five sex dolls in
Lake Lagunita. I had to rescue the dolls
while the other band members shot at me
with airsoft guns. It was really cold and I al
most got pneumonia.
TSD: It seems to me that the Tree is often
intoxicated during sports events. Will you
get drunk before games?
MS: I'm not going to get plastered.
TSD:You 've also described yourself as
awesome. Are you as awesome and idiotic
as Charlie Sheen?
MS: I try to be. I think I am.
TSD: How do you feel about deforesta
tion?
MS: It's a huge problem. Maybe if the
other trees out there were as awesome as I
am, it wouldn't be as much of a problem.
