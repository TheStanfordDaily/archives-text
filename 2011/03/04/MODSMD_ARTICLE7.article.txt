## Faculty Senate addresses humanities, Trustees Panel seeks solutions to 'fuzzy' dilemma 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
Humanities were back on the
agenda at yesterday's Faculty Sen
ate meeting, where a panel of facul
ty explored the difficulties facing
their departments. The body also
heard a report from the Board of
Trustees, led by Board Chair Leslie
Hume.
At the start of the meeting, the
Senate announced that its ad hoc
committee on the return of the
ROTC would deliver its much-an
ticipated findings on May 12. The
"task force" for studying undergrad
uate education will provide an up
date on its progress at that meeting
as well.
Humanities struggling to grow
The panel discussion on the hu
manities, which was moderated by
Senate Vice-Chair and comparative
literature professor David Palum
bo-Liu, focused on the issues facing
the 11 humanities departments in
attracting undergraduate students.
Debra Satz, the senior associate
dean for the humanities and arts,
outlined the general difficulties ex
perienced across different disci
plines.
"The humanities are a funda
mental part of what a liberal arts ed
ucation is," she said. "They are cer
tainly under pressure and attack
around the country, as budgets are
declining and enrolments are de
clining. We have a similar situation
at Stanford ... in terms of the de
cline in student enrollment and in
numbers of majors."
Part of the decline was attributed
to the perception that humanities
majors face difficulties in the job
market after graduation, leading
students to seek majors that are per
ceived as more desirable to employ
ers. Jennifer Summit, chair of the
English department, said career
concerns were the most prominent
reasons for students who chose not
to pursue English major.
Summit said her department was
trying to connect students to suc
cessful alumni with English degrees
and building a database of jobs and
internships. In a Q&A session after
the panel's presentation, Eric
Roberts, professor of computer sci
ence, told the Senate about one of
his pre-major advisees who wanted
to study the humanities, but whose
parents had threatened to pull her

out of Stanford if she did.
Satz noted that the decline in hu
manities did not appear to be the re
sult of a lack of institutional support.
She said the humanities at Stanford
did not face the same budget cuts as
many of its peers around the coun
try. It might even appear that the
University is overcommitted to the
humanities 42 percent of faculty
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences are in that area, compared to
18 percent of undergraduate majors.

Satz went on to discuss the "cul
ture" at Stanford as promoting a
general disinterest in the humani
ties, addressing negative connota
tions attached to the "fuzzy" label.
She detailed ways to dispel those
notions, including promoting a more
positive image during New Student
Orientation.
"The idea that humanities are
'fuzzy' and not serious is something
that we have to do something
about," she said.
Recruitment of students interest
ed in the humanities was also touted
as a solution. A few of the panelists
said Stanford should recruit stu
dents from the East Coast more ag
gressively, since more humanities
leaning students are found there.
Satz added that curriculum changes
were under consideration, including
joint courses with science and engi
neering departments as well as plans
to "thread" courses and build course
sequences.
The other panelists explored ini
tiatives in specific departments and
centers. Summit explained signifi
cant changes to the English major,
including a three-quarter "core" se
quence and an individual senior re
search project with a faculty mem
ber. The Senate also heard from the
division of literature, cultures and
languages, the history department
and the Stanford Humanities Cen
ter.
Board of Trustees reports to faculty
The Senate's second agenda item
focused on a discussion with repre
sentatives from Stanford's Board of
Trustees. Hume gave the Senate an
overview of the Board's responsibil
ities.
"[The duties of the board] fall
into three very broad categories: to
make sure the University is well
managed, to make sure the Univer
sity has the resources to do its work
and to maintain the University's
reputation and public trust in its in
tegrity," she said.
Hume went on to explain each of
those roles in greater detail.
