## Biology professor wins $1 million Dan David prize 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Biology professor Marcus Feldman Ph.D
'69 won a $1 million prize from the Dan David
Foundation for his work in evolution. Past
honorees include former British Prime Minis
ter Tony Blair and former Vice President A1
Gore.
The Dan David Foundation awards three
$1 million prizes each year to recognize
achievements that have "outstanding" scientif
ic, technological, cultural or social impact on
the world. The honors are divided into three
categories: past, present and future, Feldman's

work won him the "past" award; Joel and
Ethan Coen won the "present" award for their
films; and U.C. San Francisco biochemistry
professor Cynthia Kenyon and Flarvard mo
lecular biology professor Gary Ruvkun won
the "future" award for their research on aging.
Feldman's research focuses on using ap
plied mathematics and computer modeling to
"simulate and analyze the process of evolu
tion," according to his profile on the Stanford
Center for Health Policy website. This work
encompasses four categories, including human
immune response to disease, the evolution of
learning, the interaction of biological and cul
tural evolution and computer analysis of mo
lecular evolution. His research provides fur
ther insight into problems such as the origin of
genes and disease control.
The honorees will receive their award in

May at Tel Aviv University, where the founda
tion is based.
