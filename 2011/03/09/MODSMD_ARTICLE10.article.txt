## How much are college students really learning? 
### JESSICA WERTHEIM STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is known for a lot of things: first
rate academics, famous faculty, a
staggeringly low admit rate and
overcoming the greatest
odds in football history
in 2007 by defeating USC. But

it turns out that in the broader
American university system,

education may not be one of
the principal accolades.
Indeed, Derek Zoolan
der may have been on to
something when he advo
cated for a "Center For
Kids Who Can't Read
Good."

Sociology of education pro
fessors Richard Arum and Josipa

Roska recently made national news
with a report that asserts, more or less,

that college students appear to be learning
squat. Using a sample size of 2,300 under-

graduates from 24 schools across the country, the
large-scale study found that "45 percent of students
show no significant improvement in the key meas
ures of critical thinking, complex reasoning and
writing by the end of their sophomore years." This
percent only marginally improved to 36 percent
after four years.

In addition, the researchers found that of those
2,300 undergraduates, "half did not take a single
course requiring 20 pages of writing during their
prior semester, and one third did not take a single
course requiring even 40 pages of reading per
week," a deficiency that may have contributed to
the lack of intellectual growth among the collegiate
population.

Blame was placed not only on the institutions
and their lack of academic rigor, but on the students
themselves, citing an increase of social engagements
as one of the culprits for decreased test scores.
"Clearly, this is very bad news for university ed
ucation," said Catherine Heaney, associate profes
sor in the Department of Medicine and the Stanford
Prevention Research Center.

"What may happen to a lot of students [during
their first year of college] is that they don't realize

they need to adjust the way they learn and study,"
Heaney said. "They are being asked to process in
formation and material in a myriad of different
ways, a far departure from the learning and thinking
they did while still in high school."

Stephen Dobyns, this year's
Mohr Visiting Poet, is no stranger to
the classroom and spoke vehe-

mently about the decline in crit
ical thinking due to class size.
"I have been teaching

for almost 50 years and have
seen this ability to write and to
think really get worse and

worse," he said. "In order

to successfully teach
writing and composi
tion, the class size
should be about 10
students, not 35."

rated, "Particularly in
the subjects of English,
writing and composition
and even critical thinking,

[students] are being failed at the high school level;
instead of being flunked, they're simply moved, and
once they enter a college environment, they sink.
They lack the knowledge and study skills necessary
to be academically competitive."
Though from markedly different fields, Heaney
and Dobyns agree that, at least on Stanford's cam
pus, academia is alive and well good news for
Stanford students, considering the $50,000 tuition.
"I really don't think [stagnation in critical think
ing and reasoning] is present at Stanford at all,"
Heaney said. "I've seen so much growth in students
that I've gotten to know, particularly in terms of
their abilities to gather relevant information and in
tegrate it in critical and appropriate ways."
Dobyns agrees, citing a measurable difference in
the quality of writing from Stanford students as
compared to other institutions where he has taught,
like Syracuse University and Sarah Lawrence Col
lege.

"I'm struck here by the writing that I've seen," he
said. "There isn't the roughness, the simplicity of
syntax and diction or the grammatical mistakes that
