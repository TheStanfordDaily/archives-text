## SHAPING RULE OF LAW Student-led Afghanistan Legal Education Project publishes law books for Afghani universities and sees books' impact in Kabul first-hand 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Armed only with law
textbooks, six Stanford
law students and facul
ty advisor and senior
research scholar Erik
Jensen landed in Kabul,
Afghanistan on Feb. 6 on a mis
sion that would last six days.
The group made up Stanford's
Afghanistan Legal Education
Project (ALEP), a student-led law
school project funded by the U.S.
State Department that creates
textbooks on Afghanistan's legal
system specifically for the instruc
tion of Afghani students.
Working with the American
University of Afghanistan
(AUAF), the project is creating a
new generation of lawyers to
shape Afghanistan's future.
Since it was founded in 2007 by
Stanford law alums Alexander
Benard J.D. 'OB and Eli Sugarman
J.D. 'O9, the project has published
four textbooks. These include an
introductory text to the laws of
Afghanistan and textbooks on
commercial, criminal and interna
tional law. Students are currently
writing a textbook on constitu
tional law.

"The whole project is indige
nously oriented," Jensen said. "The
textbooks are written in response
to needs and demands of Afghan
students, and we try to contextual
ize our work as much as we can to
the politics, economics and social
order in Afghanistan."
The purpose of the recent trip to
Kabul was to explore the future
and progress of the project. Stu
dents attended classes that are cur
rently taught using ALEP text
books, got feedback from Afghani
students and professors and inter
acted with administrators at the

AUAF to see where the project is
headed.

"Sitting in on the classes and
meeting with the students was for
us a priority, because that's the
best way we can get feedback on
our books and make the project
better," said Daniel Lewis LAW'I2
and ALEP co-executive director.

After meeting with the presi
dent of AUAF, the group agreed
that the ultimate goal for the proj
ect is to build a complete law
school curriculum.

"The time frame is uncertain,
but we're expanding really quick
ly," Lewis said.
In addition to rolling out the
new textbook, ALEP plans to in
troduce new classes in the fall on
Islamic law and the informal jus
tice system in Afghanistan, taught
by a collaborating Afghan profes
sor and an affiliated postdoctoral
fellow. Workshops on practical
skills such as negotiation and writ
ing are also on the horizon, as well
as translations of the books into
Dari and Pashto.

The group met other notable
Afghan and American officials,
including the dean at the Kabul
University School of Law, univer
sity professors from the most pop
ulated provinces and Ambassador
Hans Klemm, coordinating direc
tor of rule of law and law enforce
ment at the Embassy of the Unit
ed States in Kabul.
"All the high officials we met

with were extraordinarily sup
portive of the project," Jensen
said.
"We'd gone over there expect
ing it wouldn't really be easy get
ting our books out there [past
AUAF], or that there would be
some hostility," Lewis said. "But
that really wasn't the case. The
feedback was that they were ex
cited to have another resource
that was new and updated."
Other universities are not the
only other audiences attracted to
the project's textbooks, which are
available publicly, and for free, on
line.
"Over the past year or so, peo
ple have been downloading them
[the books] and using them, some
of which we know about and some
of which we don't," said Rose
Ehler LAW 'l2, another ALEP
co-executive director.
The U.S. military has also used
the textbooks to familiarize offi
cers with Afghani law. According
to Jensen, retired Gen. Stanley
McChrystal was "very familiar"
with the textbooks.
The Afghan Ministry of Jus
tice, leading judges and legal aca
demics have also expressed inter
est in the project, according to
Lewis.
"It was fascinating to be [in
Kabul] as Stanford law students
talking to these really important
people in Afghanistan ... in a
knowledgeable way," Lewis said.
But strengthening the AUAF
law school and spreading legal ed
ucation are only the beginning of
ALEP's goals.
"The development of the rule
of law is historical process. It takes
time; there are fits and starts," Jen
son said.
"The problem is when you are
at Afghanistan's level of develop
ment, it will go through years and
years of fits and starts . . . and as
society goes through these
episodes, it will need a new cadre
of leaders to lead to positive
episodes," he added.

ALEP seeks to contribute to
the formation of these future
leaders, not only in the legal pro
fession but also in the country as a
whole. By using analytical meth
ods to teach students critical
thinking, they hope to bridge the
gap between American style legal
education and the Afghan reality.
"They [the Afghan students]
will see opportunities that we can't
