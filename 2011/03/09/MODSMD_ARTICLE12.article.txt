## EDITORIAL Teach for America's Rise Reveals Need for Options 
### 
Teach for America has be
come a household name
over the past year as the
number of applications has sky
rocketed 32 percent to over 46,000
making TFA one of the leading
employers of new graduates from
top schools across the nation, in
cluding Stanford. Increased media
attention, along with a growing
TFA presence on campus, has
brought the program to the front
page of many campus publications.
While this Editorial Board believes
that TFA's burgeoning success at
tests to the civic-mindedness of our
peers, it also casts a spotlight on the
gaping lack of options for Stanford
seniors seeking alternatives to
graduate school, consulting, or fi
nance.

lack of resources devoted to expos
ing students to entry-level posi
tions in many fields other than con
sulting and finance. The problem
lies in the way campus recruitment
functions. For many seniors, partic
ularly those without pre-profes
sional majors, it seems as if there
are now two options: go the bank
ing/consulting route or go the TFA
route. Of course, other options
exist, but the numbers show that a
disproportionate number of stu
dents gravitate towards one of
these two divergent paths.
The reality is that there is a sub
stantial group of students in the
middle who are interested in other
job opportunities. Conventional
wisdom has it that "if you are not
going to sign with a bank or con
sulting firm, your better land a job
through a Stanford alum." What
about the students who do not have
an existing network of alumni in
their fields of interest? We are con
stantly reminded of Stanford's ex
tensive network of influential
alumni certainly they are not all
bankers or consultants (and even
fewer are schoolteachers). The
question then becomes, what can
Stanford do to help make students
aware of the paths less taken, and
to facilitate success in those areas?

TFA has become a corporate
giant in the world of college recruit
ing, turning public service and edu
cation reform into a status symbol.
The New York Times has even
claimed that "getting into the na
tion's top law schools and grad pro
grams could be easier than being
accepted for a starting teaching job
with TFA." Such assertions have
prompted many examinations of
the TFA model especially its re
cruitment tactics. In his article
"What Are You Going to Do With
That?" which quickly went viral
among seniors after being featured
on the "O'Leven" Facebook page,
William Denesiewicz argues that
TFA appeals to the modern gener
ation of overachievers. Fie likens
TFA to McKinsey, Goldman Sachs,
Harvard Medical School and
Berkeley Law because "it's presti
gious, it's hard to get into, it's some
thing that you and your parents can
brag about, it looks good on your
resume, and most important, it rep
resents a clearly marked path."
Danesiewicz criticizes today's
generation for being unwilling to
take chances and think creatively.
While this critique is not wholly un
founded,it fails to acknowledge an
other piece to the puzzle: there is a

To start, Stanford must reinvest
in the Career Development Center
(CDC). Banks, consulting firms
and TFA have deep pockets and fi
nance their massive recruiting ef
forts accordingly, with great suc
cess. Conversely, other, smaller em
ployers in the public and private
sector cannot afford to send re
cruiters to Stanford. If the Univer
sity values the employment of its
graduates, it should expand the
CDC's overstretched staff and
make job listings on the CDC web
site more robust.

A second problem is lack of
structure. TFA provides a coordi
nated recruitment effort based on a

systematic framework: there are
campus reps, head recruiters, pres
entation dates, specific deadlines
and outlined timelines for the ap
plication process. All applicants
know whom to contact and when
they should expect to hear regard
ing first-round on-campus inter
views. The structure can be repli
cated on a grander scale to help
spotlight public sector and start-up
opportunities, while appeasing stu
dents' need for structure, formal
applications and deadlines. There
should be a focus on expanding the
use of existing resources, like the
Stanford Alumni Network and the
Stanford Alumni Association web
site, as well as a push to leverage
support from Bing programs. By
using off-campus resources, the
University expands its regional
presence and can help students
pursue opportunities in other re
gions and abroad.
TFA's rise is a good thing, but no
Stanford student should apply for
lack of a better option. Too many
students heed the siren call of fall
recruiting without an adequate un
derstanding of their options. Stan
ford fails its students when a cohort
feels disenfranchised in the world
of campus recruiting. With mini
mal increases to the CDC's staff,
and creative discussions with Bing

programs overseas and in Wash
ington, Stanford can reach these
students and help engage them
find an appropriate choice,
whether it be a consulting gig,
Google, TFA, or a job with a start
up, NGO, or non-profit organiza
tion. Perhaps students do not need
a "clearly marked path," as Dane
siewicz argues, but they do need a
push in the right direction while
pursuing their own options.
