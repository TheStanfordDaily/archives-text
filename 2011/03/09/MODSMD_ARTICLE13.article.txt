# I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY PROFOUND
## I'm dropping out of Stanford 
### Robin Thomas 
I'm leaving for Marine Corps
Boot Camp on March 20th, sans
college degree.
Originally I wanted to write
deeply and personally about that
decision for this last column, and in
clude my joke about how I always
used to tell people that I'd drop out
of Stanford after two years and go
make a million dollars, and hey, it's
coming halfway true, ha ha.
But now I'm thinking that since
there's a chance that this dropping
out is a huge, horrible mistake,
and/or that I'll fail out of boot camp,
and since coming back to Stanford
with my tail between my legs would
feel bad enough without having left
after some big, noble "road less
traveled by" kind of speech.
I actually don't want to write
about that...

Although, I would like to men
tion that one of the most valuable
and least-known things about Stan
ford is its policy on Leaves of Ab
sence. Long story short, Stanford
makes them mind-blowingly easy to
do. I offer this as evidence that our
school really does give a darn about
us as human beings. Against all tra
ditional business sense, Stanford
lets its students take time off to fig
ure out who they are, and welcomes
them back whenever they're ready.
I mean, a few weeks ago I was hav
ing a beer in the GCC with a woman
who was originally in Dean Julie's
Class of 1989 and is just now finish
ing her B.A.
Don't think you're ready to stop
being an undergrad? Don't think
you're ready to start being an un-

dergrad? Guess what! Your life
doesn't have rules! You really don't
have to go straight from high school
to college and graduate in four
years and then go right into a job! It
was all just a dream!

You wouldn't believe how often,
when I mention to Stanford grads
the concept of time off, they say,
"Oh, man, I wish I'd done that!"
You might as well have your
mid-life crisis now, while your knees
are still good and your parents are
still around, instead of convincing
yourself to do the "responsible" and
predictable thing and work until
you're fifty-five only to suddenly
quit your job, sell your house, di
vorce your spouse, and buy a red

Your life doesn't
have rules

convertible.
Or so I figure. But I digress ...
What I really want to write
about is the Westboro Baptist
Church.
I have a theory about them. Re
member when they came to Stan
ford and the whole campus turned
out with bagpipes and costumes
and ironic signs in unity against
them? Everywhere the WBC goes,
people come together to stand up
for everything the WBC stands
against gay marriage, fallen sol
diers, love and tolerance, and so on.

Get this: what if the WBC actual
ly supported those things all along?
It would be brilliant, really, and
so simple: make such obscene and
hateful statements against Thing X
that everyone else feels compelled
to defend Thing X. Using only a tiny
handful of brave and self-sacrificing
people, you could polarize an entire
nation into siding with your hidden

agenda.
Think about it: if tomorrow the
Westboro Baptist Church started
holding signs that said "GOD
HATES JAMBA JUICE," how
many people would go out and get
a Mango-a-go-go in counter
protest? Sales would probably sky
rocket.

Almost as easily as I can picture
Fred Phelps being a hateful, igno
rant bigot, I can also picture him
going home after a protest and say
ing to his gay boyfriend, "I can't be
lieve people actually take our 'God
hates fags' crap seriously!" He's ar
guably made bigger strides in get
ting people to support issues like
gay rights than many of those who
protest against his church.
Along this same line of thinking,
I have a solution to all the wars and
famines and human rights abuses
going on today. I think the govern
ments of the world should get to
gether to secretly create a fake
arch-nemesis for all humanity:
something inhuman and preferably
located off the planet hostile
aliens on Mars, maybe so that
people don't individually go trying

to hunt it down.
Nothing brings people together
like a common enemy; common
joys are unfortunately not nearly as
effective. If every human could
somehow be convinced of some
concrete, massive, yet not-insur
mountable threat to the planet,
think how hard we'd work to get
along and protect each other. Just
look at how well it worked in those
pinnacles of filmmaking "Indepen
dence Day" and "Armageddon."
Okay, sure, it could all go south
in 1984-esque fashion. But it's a fun
idea.

So that's my parting shot. Any
way, Stanford, you're great. You
have brains and beauty. But I did
you the discourtesy of expecting
you to be the solution to all my
problems, and you're not. I can't
change who you are, though; I can
only work on figuring out who I am.
See you in four years, maybe?

Robin won't be able to access his e
mailfor several months after March
20th. So if you're going to say some
thing to him, say it now via robthom
@stanford.edu.
