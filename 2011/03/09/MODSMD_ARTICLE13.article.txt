# I'M, LIKE, TOTALLY PROFOUND
## I'm dropping out of Stanford 
### Robin Thomas 
I'm leaving for Marine Corps
Boot Camp on March 20th, sans
college degree.
Originally I wanted to write
deeply and personally about that
decision for this last column, and in
clude my joke about how I always
used to tell people that I'd drop out
of Stanford after two years and go
make a million dollars, and hey, it's
coming halfway true, ha ha.
But now I'm thinking that since
there's a chance that this dropping
out is a huge, horrible mistake,
and/or that I'll fail out of boot camp,
and since coming back to Stanford
with my tail between my legs would
feel bad enough without having left
after some big, noble "road less
traveled by" kind of speech.
I actually don't want to write
about that...

Although, I would like to men
tion that one of the most valuable
and least-known things about Stan
ford is its policy on Leaves of Ab
sence. Long story short, Stanford
makes them mind-blowingly easy to
do. I offer this as evidence that our
school really does give a darn about
us as human beings. Against all tra
ditional business sense, Stanford
lets its students take time off to fig
ure out who they are, and welcomes
them back whenever they're ready.
I mean, a few weeks ago I was hav
ing a beer in the GCC with a woman
who was originally in Dean Julie's
Class of 1989 and is just now finish
ing her B.A.
Don't think you're ready to stop
being an undergrad? Don't think
you're ready to start being an un-

dergrad? Guess what! Your life
doesn't have rules! You really don't
have to go straight from high school
to college and graduate in four
years and then go right into a job! It
was all just a dream!

You wouldn't believe how often,
when I mention to Stanford grads
the concept of time off, they say,
"Oh, man, I wish I'd done that!"
You might as well have your
mid-life crisis now, while your knees
are still good and your parents are
still around, instead of convincing
yourself to do the "responsible" and
predictable thing and work until
you're fifty-five only to suddenly
quit your job, sell your house, di
vorce your spouse, and buy a red

Your life doesn't
have rules
