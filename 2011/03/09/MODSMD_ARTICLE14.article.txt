# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## The 						Capital-F Future 
### Rachel Kolb 
I think it goes without saying that
winter quarter has a reputation
as the most uncertain of quar
ters. On top of frequent accounts of
subdued mood and academic over
load, this part of the year is prime
time for us Stanford students to
consider our summer plans and our
goals for the next six or so months.
It's application season, the time to
think about upcoming responsibil
ities, which can spiral into consid
ering the whole enchilada, our cap
ital-F Future. Now, thinking about
summer internships, next year and
all those impending times of self
discovery could serve as the
proverbial light at the end of the
tunnel of February rains, but more
often than not, it seems to have the
opposite effect.
For weeks, my Facebook news
feed has been full of agonized status
updates about summer research
and major grant applications, my
friends have rushed around stress
ing over interviews, managing to
look organized and dapper despite
the harried lines on their faces. The
people fortunate enough to lock
down summer jobs early, I imagine,
must bask in self-congratulation; at
the opposite end of the spectrum,
others react to the uncertainty by
withdrawing into projects and pa
pers. These minor daily challenges
do have their advantages, simply by
being immediate. As much as Stan
ford likes to inundate its students in
rhetoric about the brilliant futures
we have ahead of us, the truth is that
some of us would rather burrow
deeper within the tepid reassurance
of a problem set than face that
much more fearsomely looming
hole.

Yet the questions of our future
linger with us all the time, even if
they only reach fever pitch during
the heightened application dead
lines of winter quarter. At Stanford,

with so many options to shape our
personal trajectories, it would be
difficult not to think about long
term goals. The opportunities avail
able to us are part of what make our
campus environment so wonderful
but, combined with a campus
culture that places tremendous em
phasis on personal success, they can
make us approach every decision
already panicking about its lasting
ramifications. Not only do we feel
like kids in a candy store, but we
also want to know exactly how that
candy we buy will impact our nutri
tion 10 years from now.
Face it: summer internships
don't have to be the beginning of
the rest of our lives, not really. Yet
we can tend to frame them that way.
Wrapped up in the rush of winter
quarter, we can view them as anoth
er step down the path of becoming
that Successful Stanford Student
that we (or is it our campus cul
ture? ) want ourselves to be. Maybe
we imagine standing at a class re
union 20 years from now, sipping
wine and saying, "Well, [insert suc
cessful enterprise here] all started
with the summer after my sopho
more year..."

I'll say it again: one span of three
months will not fundamentally de
fine our entire trajectory. Even if, at
the same time, it can. This sense of
duality, and of possibility, is what
can paralyze us even more than the
prospect of biking to class in the
rain. We want to embrace the "go
get-'em" attitude that seems en
grained into the Stanford spirit, not

only about internships but about
job and graduate school prospects.
Many of us do embrace that posi
tivist mindset more often than not,
but at the same time, we can feel un
certain about how to choose and
then achieve our goals.
In one sense, these dilemmas are
unnecessary. As undergraduates, we
still have many years in which to
"discover" ourselves. Our degree, as
well as the experiences we have on
campus, will not necessarily define
who we are or what we do in five
years, much less 50. We can embrace
the chance of learning all that we
can, for the sake of learning, while
we still have the opportunity.
Yet, in a world overflowing with
information and a campus environ
ment that can make us feel pressed
for time, there remains the question
of just what we find most worth
learning. One thing that I think we
have all been told is to follow our
passions. But which passion? Which
future version of ourselves? Just be
cause I enjoy something doesn't
mean that I would want it to be the
central focus of my life. What's
more, I've come to realize that too
much passion and not enough bal
ance can lead to burnout or bitter
ness, or both.
The central question that we un
dergraduates might be asking our
selves, within the flurry of both
short- and long-term decisions, is
just what that healthy, self-sustain
ing passion is. To be honest, there
are so many options and so many
areas of need that what we choose
might not matter as much as we
think, as long as we retain the per
spective that, indeed, our current
campus lives are helping us to de
velop.
