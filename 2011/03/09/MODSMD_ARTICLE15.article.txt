# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Epiphanies 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I went through a huge life realiza
tion this past week. Maybe it's
because I'm a senior, and it's
about time I made big life realiza
tions or else I'd be a bit screwed. Or
maybe it's because of this column,
which has made me really think
about my life. Or maybe it was be
cause this past week was Transgen
der Awareness Week, where I met
so many big figures in the transgen
der rights movement, and I thought
about my own role in the trans
community and what I can do for a
movement that's 30 years behind
the LGB movement. Or maybe I
wanted to procrastinate from doing
my CSIO6A homework.
I remember when I was first
transitioning, I felt so alienated, so
alone. I didn't think there was any
body like me in the world. It was a
time in my life that I felt hopeless,
and I was at the point of giving up.
Ever since I was younger, I was told
I didn't deserve to be happy, that I
didn't deserve to have what the
"normal" people had. My own nar
rative didn't follow the "normal"
narratives, and as a result, that
made me an outsider, a freak. I was
taught that it wasn't any use argu
ing, I deserved to take all the blame
for whatever happened to me
and I kept hammering that message
into my head, even well into my
senior year.
Now, when I've got a whole
week devoted to people like me, it
certainly helps with the self-es
teem. I met some of the most visible

and well-known transgender ac
tivists in the community. I listened
to Willy Wilkinson, a transgender
person who specializes in providing
healthcare for transgender folks. I
met Danielle Askini, the National
Program Manager of the GSA Net
work. I had tea with Autumn
Sandeen, a transwoman who hand
cuffed herself to the White House
fence to protest against "don't ask,
don't tell." I met Rocco Kayiatos
(aka Katastrophe) a trans-identi
fied rapper who founded one of my
favorite trans-centered magazines
(I even landed an internship for it!
Joy!). I talked to Jamison Green, a
transgender man who has helped
draft pro-transgender legislation
and is one of the most famous
transgender activists in the world
(and I discovered, much to my ela
tion, that he lives in my hometown).
It was seriously like Christmas.
Every day.
It wasn't until this past week
that I realized I've come a long way
since that day sophomore year dur
ing Dead Week of fall quarter,
when I came out to myself after an
extensive Wikipedia search. I real
ized, as I sat riveted by their speech
es and performances and in my
conversations with them, that when
I grew up, I wanted to be just like
them. They forged paths to help the
people who would come after them
live easier lives, lives of a higher
standard. It's been a slow realiza
tion something I've been slowly
approaching through each of my

columns but every time I meet
another transgender person, every
time I think about what I'm going
to write about next week, every
time I get into a conversation about
transgender issues, I realize that I
want to help out those young trans
gender kids who are yet to come
out. They deserve better than what
we're getting today. Transgender
Awareness Week was merely a
taste of what I want to do. Although
that week will have long passed by
the time these kids come out, just
the fact that it all happened in the
first place is more than significant.
It's part of our transgender history
and our transgender community.
And I helped out with that. My ex
periences during Transgender
Awareness Week only further my
drive to join this cause, to define my
life in terms of activism. I've actual
ly started looking for jobs at non
profits in San Francisco.
Things are changing. At Vaden,
there's now a third option, "trans
gender," besides male and female.
Your preferred name, not your
legal name, now appears on your
unofficial transcripts. The Stanford
Services Center is working on the

ID issues, so for the next trans kid,
it won't take two years to get a new
ID. With the ROTC debate, trans
gender people are being talked
about, thought about, not just at a
Stanford level, but nationwide.
And I'm a voice in this debate. If
you had told me this as a terrified
sophomore in college, I wouldn't
have believed you.
I'm growing into somebody,
and I'm not quite sure who yet, ex
actly, but I'm headed towards
something new, something beyond
essays and problem sets and par
ties and toward something I saw in
those people I met during this past
week. I am becoming the person I
was meant to be. I thought I'd be
terrified. But I'm not. I'm growing
up. And it feels good.
