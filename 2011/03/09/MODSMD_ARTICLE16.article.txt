## Self-Compassion 
### 
We live in a culture that tells
us we're lazy and self-in
dulgent if we don't criticize
ourselves. Our media exposure and
our peers at Stanford tell us we're
not good enough no matter how
hard we try we're not smart
enough, pretty enough, cool
enough, studying enough, partying
enough, even happy enough (yes,
we can compete on everything, and
we do!). We all have something
about ourselves that we don't like,
that we're ashamed or insecure
about. At the same time, we reject
the patently true fact that imperfec
tion is human. When we fail, we per
ceive that we're alone in our failure
even though feelings of inade
quacy and insecurity are part of liv
ing the human life.
It's time we realize that our self
critical and self-judgmental out
look is not healthy. We tell our
selves that it is what has driven us to
where we are today, at Stanford. We
avoid being too kind to ourselves
because we fear becoming self-in
dulgent. But a 2007 study at Wake
Forest University demonstrated
that a minor self-compassion inter
vention can actually curb overeat
ing instead of encouraging it, con
trary to expectations. Female col
lege students were asked to eat
doughnuts. Flalf were given a les
son in self-compassion with the
food: the instructor said, "I hope
you won't be hard on yourself.
Everyone in the study eats this
stuff, so I don't think there's any
reason to feel real bad about it."
Later, all were asked to taste test
candy. The women who heard the
reassurance ate /ess; those who
hadn't, ate more. The hypothesis is
that the women who felt guilty for
eating the doughnuts engaged in
"emotional" eating, whereas the
women who gave themselves per
mission to eat the doughnuts didn't
overeat.
A 2007 study by Neff, Rude and
Kirkpatrick found that self-compas
sion is correlated with self-reported
measures of happiness, optimism,
initiative, curiosity, agreeableness,
extroversion and conscientiousness.
It is negatively correlated with neg
ative affect and neuroticism. Self
compassion predicts positive psy
chological health beyond that at
tributable to personality.
Self-compassion is a relatively
new concept in psychological re

search and practice. However, its
import hit home when I attended
the memorial service of a Stanford
student and friend who was incredi
bly active in public service and in
the Center for Compassion and Al
truism Research and Education,
but wasn't compassionate enough
to herself and took her own life.
There, in the peace and beauty of
Memorial Church, I was reminded
that the greatest relationship we
can have is with ourselves. And the
greatest life that we can live is the
authentic one. It's hard, but by
being real about our struggles, we
can turn our vulnerabilities into
strengths instead of weaknesses.
There is infinitely more that binds
us than sets us apart, and the sor
rows and stress that each of us face
are universal to all human beings
and yes, all Stanford students, as in
vincible and perfect as we may per
ceive others to be. We don't have to
feel alone. No one is perfect, no one
is always happy, we all fail and we all
feel overwhelmed sometimes. It's
okay to break down these facades
that we may carry. Don't be afraid
to open up and be vulnerable. If
you're not comfortable doing that
with friends or an RA, call CAPS at
650-723-3785 or the BRIDGE at
650-723-3392, both of which are
confidential and 24/7. Nothing's
"too small" or insignificant.
It's hard to unlearn habits of a
lifetime so we must make an active
and conscious attempt to develop
the habit of self-compassion. Like
any other muscle, self-compassion
is one that can be improved with
practice. When things go badly, re
mind yourself that difficulty is a
part of life that everyone goes
through, and you are not alone.
Imagine you're talking with your
friend, who has come to you de
spondent and suffering. What
would you say to him or her? Give
yourself the space, time, kindness
and affirmation that you would give
a friend who came to you with the
same feelings. Forgive yourself of
your flaws be patient and under
standing of them, just as you would
for those of your friends. We are fre
quently hardest on ourselves more
than anyone else. Go on a "self
compassion diet" instead of one re
volving around self-discipline, dep
rivation and neglect.

can turn our vulnerabilities into
strengths instead of weaknesses.
There is infinitely more that binds
us than sets us apart, and the sor
rows and stress that each of us face
are universal to all human beings
and yes, all Stanford students, as in
vincible and perfect as we may per
ceive others to be. We don't have to
feel alone. No one is perfect, no one
is always happy, we all fail and we all
feel overwhelmed sometimes. It's
okay to break down these facades
that we may carry. Don't be afraid
to open up and be vulnerable. If
you're not comfortable doing that
with friends or an RA, call CAPS at
650-723-3785 or the BRIDGE at
650-723-3392, both of which are
confidential and 24/7. Nothing's
"too small" or insignificant.
It's hard to unlearn habits of a
lifetime so we must make an active
and conscious attempt to develop
the habit of self-compassion. Like
any other muscle, self-compassion
is one that can be improved with
practice. When things go badly, re
mind yourself that difficulty is a
part of life that everyone goes
through, and you are not alone.
Imagine you're talking with your
friend, who has come to you de
spondent and suffering. What
would you say to him or her? Give
yourself the space, time, kindness
and affirmation that you would give
a friend who came to you with the
same feelings. Forgive yourself of
your flaws be patient and under
standing of them, just as you would
for those of your friends. We are fre
quently hardest on ourselves more
than anyone else. Go on a "self
compassion diet" instead of one re
volving around self-discipline, dep
rivation and neglect.
