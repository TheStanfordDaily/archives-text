## Franco and Bidart present killer talk 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Actor-director James Franco
and poet Frank Bidart discussed
their recent artistic collaboration in
front of a packed audience in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Mon
day afternoon.
In 2009, Franco adapted "Her
bert White," a poem by Bidart, into
a short film. At Monday's event,
Bidart performed a reading of the
poem and Franco presented his film
adaptation before engaging in a dis
cussion about the project.
"When I heard [Bidart's] poem
for the first time, I was immediately
struck by it, and I knew I wanted to
make a movie out of it," Franco
said.
The poem, which Bidart de
scribed as "very dark," explores the
mindset of the unstable Herbert
White, a necrophiliac murderer. It is
written in the first person, from
Herbert's perspective.
Bidart, who jokingly pointed out
that he was not as insane as his char
acter, noted that this was the first
time in decades he had done a pub
lic reading of the piece because of
its difficult subject matter.
"The poem intrigued me be
cause there is, of course, the voice of
the psychotic killer, but in between
there is also the voice of a poet, a
creative mind trying to make sense
of the world," Franco said. "Frank
weaved those two voices together
marvelously."
Franco's film adaptation re
mained mostly consistent with the
text of the poem, although he did
add certain touches of his own, in
cluding recurrent imagery of Her
bert bulldozing trees in the forest.
"Because film is a medium that
handles images much better than
words, being loyal to the poem in a
film adaptation does not always in
volve using the exact language of
the poem," Franco said. "I have
learned that, to be loyal to the
poem, you should be more con
cerned with being loyal to the tone,
to the structure, to the pace of the
piece."
The 14-minute film, which was
written and directed by Franco, was
screened at last year's Sundance
Film Festival. Actor Michael Shan
non played the role of Herbert
White.

Many in the audience seemed
taken aback at first by the heavy
subject matter of the project, but
most seemed to leave the talk im
pressed by the manner in which

Bidart and Franco explored the
themes of self-expression, isolation
and sanity.
"The film was jarring, macabre
and managed to give a nuanced
presentation of a complex human
monster in under 14 minutes," said
Shaya Fidel 'll. "To me, it solidified
the fact that Franco is a director
worth taking seriously."
Michelle Dadourian'll agreed.
"What impressed me the most
was [Franco's] explanation of the
artistic process he went through in
taking a character described only in
words and turning him, with all his
warped psychoses and inner
demons, into a believable figure on
the screen," Dadourian said.
Co-host of the 2011 Academy
Awards, Franco is famous for his
acting roles in "Spider-Man,"
"Pineapple Express" and "127
Hours." He is also a film director,
screenwriter, author and painter.
Bidart is an English professor at
Wellesley University and an award
winning poet. Among other distinc
tions, his work has been nominated
for the Pulitzer Prize.
The presentation was moderated
by Ken Fields, a professor of Eng
lish and creative writing.
