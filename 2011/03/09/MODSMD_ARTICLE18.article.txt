## ASSU mulls rules for elections petitioning Students wary about petitions pressures 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
A handful of complaints from
students who felt pressured to sign
petitions for the upcoming spring
elections were recently brought to
the attention of the Administration
and Rules Committee of the ASSU.
Juany Torres 'l3, the chair of the
Administration and Rules Commit
tee for the Undergraduate Senate,
said that about 5 people had filed
complaints stating they felt pres
sure to sign petitions.
These complaints included cases
where students were pressured to
sign petitions as candidates stood
over their shoulders, as well as inci
dents where candidates would put
their own laptop in front of people
and encourage them to sign while
the candidate watched. These ac
tions caused some students to feel
pressured and to lodge complaints
with Torres.
"There are no real rules about
petitioning, other than the petition
ers need to be Stanford undergrad
uates," Torres said.
Torres pointed out that in the
ASSU joint bylaws, there are no
specific rules prohibiting or regulat
ing any sort of pressuring of stu
dents to sign petitions.
When it comes to the actual elec
tion, there are sections of the gov
erning documents that have explicit
rules regarding pressuring people
to vote for a specific candidate or vi
olating the privacy of the secret bal
lot; however, there is a lack of simi
lar regulation for the petitioning

process.
Torres noted that anyone who
was concerned with or regretted
their signature had the opportunity
to contact the Elections Commis
sion to have their name removed
from a petition; however, she also
acknowledged that many students
are unaware of this option.
According to Torres, the Admin
istration and Rules Committee is
"working closely with the Elections
Commission" to write into the by
laws rules regarding petitioning
practices. Though they won't apply
to this year's elections, Torres said
the changes will help in the future.
"We don't know exactly what
we'll say, but we will work in some
language where it explicitly states
that if students feel pressured when
petitioning, they should e-mail the
Elections Commission."

Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the ASSU
Elections Commissioner, said that
petitioning is one area where the
Elections Commission has very lit
tle authority.
"We don't have the authority to
tell candidates they can't watch
people sign a petition or something
like that," he said. "The Administra
tion and Rules Committee asked
me if I could make or enforce new
rules, but I can't do it without the
Undergraduate Senate's permis
sion."

Trusheim said that if the Admin
istration and Rules Committee
wanted, they had the power to sub
mit rule changes to the Senate, but
for this year's elections, he had very
little power to regulate the petition
ing process.
