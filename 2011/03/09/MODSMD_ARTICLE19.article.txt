## FOOTBALL SPECIAL GETTING IN GEAR SPRING PRACTICE OPENS FOR 2011 SEASON 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the scent of oranges from
January fading away, the Stanford
football team wrapped up its first
session of spring practices on Satur
day afternoon. The Cardinal com
pleted seven practices between Feb.
21 and March 5. Three of those ses
sions were open to the public, giving
a first glimpse at the makeup of
Stanford's roster for next season.
Two storylines dominated spring
practice: the battles for starting jobs
at a number of positions and how
coaching changes would affect the
team in its first practices under new
head coach David Shaw. So far,
Shaw seems to have done well in
coaching and motivating his play
ers, sounding all the right notes
about staying hungry and competi
tive following last season's historic
success. However, it is impossible to
fully examine the ramifications of
the coaching change at this early

stage we'll have to wait until the
fall to make a true estimate of
Shaw's head coaching abilities.
There has been one prominent
position switch this spring, with red
shirt sophomore running back Usua
Amanam moving to defensive
back. With a deep stable of half
backs, including rising junior Step
fan Taylor and sixth-year senior Je
remy Stewart (who received a med
ical redshirt in the offseason) and
two highly-touted running backs
coming into the program next sea
son as freshmen, the coaching staff
decided to move Amanam to de
fense to take advantage of his ath
leticism and speed.
Stanford has several large holes
to fill after it lost a good chunk of its
starters to graduation and the NFL
Draft. The Card's most glaring defi
ciencies are along the offensive line
and in the defensive front seven,
where it lost a combined seven
starters. There are also gaps at wide
receiver, fullback and cornerback.

Lastly, a heated competition is
under way at quarterback, where
three players are jockeying to sit be
hind redshirt junior Andrew Luck
on the depth chart.
At offensive line, the main battle
is at center, where Stanford must re
place Ail-American Chase Beeler.
There is no clear frontrunner be
tween redshirt sophomore Khalil
Wilkes and redshirt junior Sam
Schwartzstein, though

Schwartzstein was getting more
time with the first team at the most
recent practice on Saturday. At the
other positions, the top contenders
are redshirt senior Tyler Mabry,
sophomore David Yankey and jun
ior Kevin Danser.

On defense, junior Terrence
Stephens looks like he will step into
the hole at nose tackle left by Sione
Fua, with juniors Ben Gardner and
Trent Murphy battling to replace
Brian Bulcke at defensive end. At
linebacker, the two standouts so far
have been redshirt juniors Alex
Debniak and Max Bergen, who
both saw decent playing time last
season as well.
With senior Chris Owusu out of
camp with an injury, the battle is
mostly to grab the second and third
wide receiver slots on the depth
chart, following the departure of
two of Luck's favorite targets, Ryan
Whalen and Doug Baldwin. So far,
senior Griff Whalen and junior
Drew Terrell have separated them
selves from the rest of the pack, with
junior Jamal-Rashad Patterson also
playing a role. At fullback, redshirt
sophomore Ryan Hewitt looks like
the top contender to take over for
Owen Marecic.

At cornerback, senior Johnson
Bademosi and sophomore Barry
Browning will probably play the

two cover corner positions.
Amanam, redshirt junior Quinn
Evans and redshirt sophomore Ter
rence Brown will provide depth
and see playing time in five- and
six-defensive back sets.

Last but not least, the backup
quarterback competition is ongo
ing between junior Josh Nunes
and sophomores Darren Daniel
and Brett Nottingham. Nunes
looks like the current leader, tak

ing the most reps on Saturday, but
he has looked shaky and erratic,
opening the door for the other two
to sneak in. Daniel is more of a
mobile, running quarterback, so
he might be used in Wildcat for
mations or even converted to a re
ceiver. Shaw stressed that the
competition is completely open
right now with no frontrunner, but
with the way the quarterbacks
were throwing on Saturday, Stan
ford fans should be happy that
Luck passed up the NFL to return
for his senior season.
