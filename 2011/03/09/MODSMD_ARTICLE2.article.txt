### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 released the results of
the petitioning process, which closed last
Friday at 4 p.m., in an e-mail to current
ASSU officials, candidates and special fees
group officers on Tuesday afternoon. All ex
ecutive slates, senior and sophomore class
president slates and Undergraduate Senate
candidates received enough verified signa
tures to appear on April's ballot.
Of the 15 groups required to petition for
an increase in special fees funding, 11 gath
ered enough verified signatures to appear
on the ballot.The Stanford Journal of Inter
national Relations, the Progressive, the
Harmonics and STAMP did not receive
enough signatures.

The final ASSU ballot will feature three
executive slates, two senior class president
slates, five sophomore class president slates,
39 Senate candidates and 52 special fees
groups. Forty-one groups were not required
to petition after receiving approval for their
requested budgets and increases from the
Senate and GSC.

The ballot has not been officially final
ized by the Elections Commission and will
not be final until the Voter Guide is released
21 days before the election begins.

Two of the Executive slates "Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis for Exec" and "Tenzin-
Vasquez" qualified for public financing
after receiving a minimum of 100 signatures
apiece from the undergraduate and gradu
ate student populations. The third slate,
"Hertz-Coggeshall Family for Excellence,"
which is backed by the Stanford Chaparral,
made the ballot with paper signatures but
will not receive public financing.
The last item on the ballot is an advisory
referendum entitled "Measure A Advi
sory Question on ROTC," which will ask
voters if they support the return of ROTC
to Stanford's campus. Both the Senate and
GSC approved the measure earlier this
quarter. The referendum is non-binding; its
purpose is to advise the Faculty Senate's ad
hoc committee tasked with investigating
ROTC's return.

Flowever, the referendum may not ap
pear on the ballot, pending the result of a
Constitutional Council case initiated by
Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3, president of Stan
ford Students for Queer Liberation
(SSQL). Vaid-Menon contends that the ref
erendum violates the ASSU's anti-discrim
ination statutes. SSQL has been among the
most vocal opponents of ROTC's return on
the grounds that the program violates the
rights of transgender students, as they are
not allowed to serve openly in the military.
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll will defend the referen
dum, which she authored, when the
Constitutional Council hears the
case this evening.
"The ballot measure is moving
forward unless the Constitutional
Council rules otherwise, as the
measure has qualified for the ballot
already," Trusheim wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "Innocent until
proven guilty; Constitutional until
proven otherwise,"
The deadline for declarations of
intent and petitions for GSC candi
dates and junior class president
slates has been pushed back to Mar.
18, which is the last day of finals
week. No junior class president slate
had entered the race at the time of
publication.
For the four special fees groups
that did not receive sufficient signa
tures, the ASSU Constitution em
powers the Senate and GSC to push
back the petitions deadline if there
are "extenuating circumstances."
This grace period could allow those
groups to gather enough signatures
to appear on the ballot.
