# Derek Hall An NFL prospect a year in the making
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Consider Derek Hall's position
at this time last year.
In anticipation of the spring
practice sessions, Greg Roman,
the associate head coach at the
time, names Hall and two younger
players Kevin Danser and
Tyler Mabry as the main candi
dates to replace Chris Marinelli at
right offensive tackle. A rising red
shirt senior and unknown com
modity, Hall had, at this point,
played in just two contests in his
first four years on the Farm.

Fast forward to the summer.
Hall's main competition is now
James McGillicuddy, a sixth-year
senior with 22 games of experi
ence under his belt. Both had been
converted from the defensive line
earlier in their Stanford careers,
but McGillicuddy made the switch
in January of 2007, whereas Hall
made the change over a year later.

McGillicuddy had also played on
the offensive line in high school,
while Hall's two-way role at that
level was at tight end. A presump
tive favorite, Hall is not.
The battle, perhaps the fiercest
of the Cardinal's 2010 camp, goes
down to the wire, but Hall eventu
ally pulls ahead in the week before
the opener against Sacramento
State.

"At first, I was a deer in the
headlights," he said. "I was so
amped up to finally play. You had
to get those first game jitters out of
the way. After that, I got tremen
dously more confident."
From September on, it's a
whirlwind: Hall starts all 13 games
at right tackle and fits seamlessly
into a line that returned four
starters. The unit, which also heav
ily features McGillicuddy as an
extra tackle, wins wide acclaim en
route to Stanford's 12-1 season.

After a collegiate careeron and off the sidelines, graduating senior Derek
Hall (No. 53) is knocking on the doorstep on the NFL. He'll have just one
more chance to prove himself to scouts at Stanford's Pro Day.
Hall is named honorable mention
All-Pac-10.

Now, one year removed from
being known only to the most in
tense of the Stanford diehards.
Hall is a legitimate NFL Draft
prospect a raw but effectual
lineman who made the most of his
limited opportunity.

Where does that leave him? Hall
said that people see him as high as a
third-rounder or as low as undraft
ed, but that he isn't "trying to pre
dict it, because it's so hard to pre
dict." Wes Bunting, the Director of
College Scouting for the National
Football Post, sees him as a proba
ble late-round selection or, at
worst, a priority undrafted free
agent.

"My confidence in myself is
good," Hall said. "It doesn't matter
where I get taken."
Bunting finds Hall to be an in
triguing prospect better, he
thinks, than Marinelli and Matt
Kopa, two of the last Cardinal tack
les to test the NFL waters. In sepa
rate interviews, both Bunting and
Hall pointed to skills gained as a de
fensive lineman that could be bene
ficial to Hall's career as an offen
sive tackle.

"On the defensive line, it's all
about attacking and playing with
low leverage," Hall said. "I think
that helped me run-block better. I
was firing off like a defensive line
man so I could get the most push. I
knew what they were trying to do."
Bunting concurred.
"You can see it as a run blocker,
he can create a lot of leverage," he
said. "At 303 pounds, he's not over
ly strong, but his ability to generate
leverage is a big plus."
That means, for example, that
Hall is not pigeonholed into any
one type of scheme.
"He could play in a zone or
power, to be honest. His body type
screams zone. But when you see
him play with leverage, you know
he can do power," Bunting said.
"That's good, because he'll be on a
few more teams' draft boards."

Hall recognized that he still has
work to do in pass protection;
Bunting pointed to "overextended
footwork" as one of Hall's major li
abilities, but also said that his ath
leticism is good enough that he
could improve with more practice.
"I've been told that scouts say
that they like me but that I need to
improve my pass blocking, because
the defensive ends are freaks in the
NFL," Hall said. "I still need to con
tinue to get better. I'm still learning."
To his credit, Hall seems to be
the person most cognizant of his sit
uation. He is not fooling himself: his
technique essential to pass
blocking is the major focus of his
current workouts. He's also practic
ing as a guard to look more attrac
tive to NFL clubs.

"To make a team, because the
rosters are so much smaller in the
NFL, you have to be versatile,"

he said.
Since Stanford's season ended in
January, Hall has been working to
beat the learning curve. He's train
ing at the Athletes' Performance
Institute in Carson, just south of
Los Angeles, where he spends his
days trying to improve his strength,
speed and technical skills. His
meals are specifically designed to
maximize performance. He does
drills against some of the best de
fensive linemen in the draft, includ
ing Clemson's Da'Quan Bowers,
who many see as the probable No. 1
overall selection.

"It gives you a good gauge of
what you need to work on and
where you're at. Doing it just gives
you more confidence, because
you're practicing against these
highly skilled people. When you
look at the NFL from the outside,
you have these ideas of grandeur.
It's good to get used to playing
people at that skill level," Hall
said.

Eventually, the benefits of these
drills and workout regimens have
to reach the eyes of scouts and
coaches, and Hall, unlike many
other candidates, will only have
one major forum to showcase his
talent. While other prospects were
invited to postseason all-star
games and the scouting combine,
Hall was left out. His lone chance
to perform in front of a legion of
NFL personnel will be Stanford's
Pro Day on March 17.
"I'm a little disadvantaged be
cause not going to the Combine
means they know less about me. I
haven't done an interview yet," he
said. "Even at Pro Day, I won't be
evaluated as closely as if I went to
the combine, where they do a
ridiculous amount of tests and in
terviews. At Pro Day they're work
ing you out and taking you through
drills, not doing actual interviews
with you."
Bunting stressed the importance
of Hall's Pro Day performance.
"There will be more weight on
his Pro Day. If he doesn't perform
well, he won't get the chance to
make up for it," he said. "He needs
to have long arms, which is key at
the offensive tackle position. He
has to run in that 5.3 range [in the
40-yard dash]. He has to show that
he can put on some weight. He has
a good frame, but he should be clos
er to 310."

Ultimately, Hall knows how he's
viewed and where he sits. His atten
tion is not on the past but on what
he can do in the next two months to
improve his draft stock. A good Pro
Day performance, for instance,
could prompt separate visits from
teams, or invitations to their train
ing facilities, where Hall and coach
es can get better acquainted. It has
taken numerous unpredictable
turns to get him to this point, but
Hall stands on the precipice of a
professional career. To that end, his
focus and drive are honed.

"I just have to worry about what
I can control," he said. "I'm going to
work my hardest."

Consider Derek Hall's position
at this time last year.
In anticipation of the spring
practice sessions, Greg Roman,
the associate head coach at the
time, names Hall and two younger
players Kevin Danser and
Tyler Mabry as the main candi
dates to replace Chris Marinelli at
right offensive tackle. A rising red
shirt senior and unknown com
modity, Hall had, at this point,
played in just two contests in his
first four years on the Farm.

Fast forward to the summer.
Hall's main competition is now
James McGillicuddy, a sixth-year
senior with 22 games of experi
ence under his belt. Both had been
converted from the defensive line
earlier in their Stanford careers,
but McGillicuddy made the switch
in January of 2007, whereas Hall
made the change over a year later.

McGillicuddy had also played on
the offensive line in high school,
while Hall's two-way role at that
level was at tight end. A presump
tive favorite, Hall is not.
The battle, perhaps the fiercest
of the Cardinal's 2010 camp, goes
down to the wire, but Hall eventu
ally pulls ahead in the week before
the opener against Sacramento
State.

"At first, I was a deer in the
headlights," he said. "I was so
amped up to finally play. You had
to get those first game jitters out of
the way. After that, I got tremen
dously more confident."
From September on, it's a
whirlwind: Hall starts all 13 games
at right tackle and fits seamlessly
into a line that returned four
starters. The unit, which also heav
ily features McGillicuddy as an
extra tackle, wins wide acclaim en
route to Stanford's 12-1 season.

After a collegiate careeron and off the sidelines, graduating senior Derek
Hall (No. 53) is knocking on the doorstep on the NFL. He'll have just one
more chance to prove himself to scouts at Stanford's Pro Day.
Hall is named honorable mention
All-Pac-10.

Now, one year removed from
being known only to the most in
tense of the Stanford diehards.
Hall is a legitimate NFL Draft
prospect a raw but effectual
lineman who made the most of his
limited opportunity.

Where does that leave him? Hall
said that people see him as high as a
third-rounder or as low as undraft
ed, but that he isn't "trying to pre
dict it, because it's so hard to pre
dict." Wes Bunting, the Director of
College Scouting for the National
Football Post, sees him as a proba
ble late-round selection or, at
worst, a priority undrafted free
agent.

"My confidence in myself is
good," Hall said. "It doesn't matter
where I get taken."
Bunting finds Hall to be an in
triguing prospect better, he
thinks, than Marinelli and Matt
Kopa, two of the last Cardinal tack
les to test the NFL waters. In sepa
rate interviews, both Bunting and
Hall pointed to skills gained as a de
fensive lineman that could be bene
ficial to Hall's career as an offen
sive tackle.

"On the defensive line, it's all
about attacking and playing with
low leverage," Hall said. "I think
that helped me run-block better. I
was firing off like a defensive line
man so I could get the most push. I
knew what they were trying to do."
Bunting concurred.
"You can see it as a run blocker,
he can create a lot of leverage," he
said. "At 303 pounds, he's not over
ly strong, but his ability to generate
leverage is a big plus."
That means, for example, that
Hall is not pigeonholed into any
one type of scheme.
"He could play in a zone or
power, to be honest. His body type
screams zone. But when you see
him play with leverage, you know
he can do power," Bunting said.
"That's good, because he'll be on a
few more teams' draft boards."

Hall recognized that he still has
work to do in pass protection;
Bunting pointed to "overextended
footwork" as one of Hall's major li
abilities, but also said that his ath
leticism is good enough that he
could improve with more practice.
"I've been told that scouts say
that they like me but that I need to
improve my pass blocking, because
the defensive ends are freaks in the
NFL," Hall said. "I still need to con
tinue to get better. I'm still learning."
To his credit, Hall seems to be
the person most cognizant of his sit
uation. He is not fooling himself: his
technique essential to pass
blocking is the major focus of his
current workouts. He's also practic
ing as a guard to look more attrac
tive to NFL clubs.

"To make a team, because the
rosters are so much smaller in the
NFL, you have to be versatile,"

he said.
Since Stanford's season ended in
January, Hall has been working to
beat the learning curve. He's train
ing at the Athletes' Performance
Institute in Carson, just south of
Los Angeles, where he spends his
days trying to improve his strength,
speed and technical skills. His
meals are specifically designed to
maximize performance. He does
drills against some of the best de
fensive linemen in the draft, includ
ing Clemson's Da'Quan Bowers,
who many see as the probable No. 1
overall selection.

"It gives you a good gauge of
what you need to work on and
where you're at. Doing it just gives
you more confidence, because
you're practicing against these
highly skilled people. When you
look at the NFL from the outside,
you have these ideas of grandeur.
It's good to get used to playing
people at that skill level," Hall
said.

Eventually, the benefits of these
drills and workout regimens have
to reach the eyes of scouts and
coaches, and Hall, unlike many
other candidates, will only have
one major forum to showcase his
talent. While other prospects were
invited to postseason all-star
games and the scouting combine,
Hall was left out. His lone chance
to perform in front of a legion of
NFL personnel will be Stanford's
Pro Day on March 17.
"I'm a little disadvantaged be
cause not going to the Combine
means they know less about me. I
haven't done an interview yet," he
said. "Even at Pro Day, I won't be
evaluated as closely as if I went to
the combine, where they do a
ridiculous amount of tests and in
terviews. At Pro Day they're work
ing you out and taking you through
drills, not doing actual interviews
with you."
Bunting stressed the importance
of Hall's Pro Day performance.
"There will be more weight on
his Pro Day. If he doesn't perform
well, he won't get the chance to
make up for it," he said. "He needs
to have long arms, which is key at
the offensive tackle position. He
has to run in that 5.3 range [in the
40-yard dash]. He has to show that
he can put on some weight. He has
a good frame, but he should be clos
er to 310."
