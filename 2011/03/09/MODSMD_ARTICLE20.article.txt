# Derek Hall An NFL prospect a year in the making
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Consider Derek Hall's position
at this time last year.
In anticipation of the spring
practice sessions, Greg Roman,
the associate head coach at the
time, names Hall and two younger
players Kevin Danser and
Tyler Mabry as the main candi
dates to replace Chris Marinelli at
right offensive tackle. A rising red
shirt senior and unknown com
modity, Hall had, at this point,
played in just two contests in his
first four years on the Farm.

Fast forward to the summer.
Hall's main competition is now
James McGillicuddy, a sixth-year
senior with 22 games of experi
ence under his belt. Both had been
converted from the defensive line
earlier in their Stanford careers,
but McGillicuddy made the switch
in January of 2007, whereas Hall
made the change over a year later.

McGillicuddy had also played on
the offensive line in high school,
while Hall's two-way role at that
level was at tight end. A presump
tive favorite, Hall is not.
The battle, perhaps the fiercest
of the Cardinal's 2010 camp, goes
down to the wire, but Hall eventu
ally pulls ahead in the week before
the opener against Sacramento
State.

"At first, I was a deer in the
headlights," he said. "I was so
amped up to finally play. You had
to get those first game jitters out of
the way. After that, I got tremen
dously more confident."
From September on, it's a
whirlwind: Hall starts all 13 games
at right tackle and fits seamlessly
into a line that returned four
starters. The unit, which also heav
ily features McGillicuddy as an
extra tackle, wins wide acclaim en
route to Stanford's 12-1 season.
