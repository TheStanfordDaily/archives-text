those
watching Stan
ford's 5-2 victory
over Cal last Sat-

urday, some of the finest strokes in colle
giate tennis were on display. With four play
ers ranked in the top 25, Stanford has a col
lection of players who have honed a few
shots that stand out in the minds of the fans.
To see Stanford's number one player
senior Hilary Barte hit a forehand is to
watch a motion so natural it garners little
attention. What does raise the eyebrows of
spectators, though, is how hard that ball
comes off the racket and how perfectly
placed her shots are. Her ability to add va
riety to her shot allows her to control points
when given the chance to use her forehand.
"That's one of the strengths of my fore
hand," said Barte. "I can loop it. I can hit it
completely flat and hard. I can hit it heavy.
Anything. My basic rally shot is a heavy, flat
ball a line drive that dips at the end."
She credits her uncle, a lefty like Barte,
with first guiding her through the process
of learning a left-handed forehand. When
she felt like her shot was getting pulled in
different directions, she had her father
there to help.
"Coaches are always trying to change it

and [Dad] said 'just stick with your natural
shot,'" Barte said.
Barte has one memory from last season
that stands out in her mind as a moment her
forehand proved invaluable.
"Against Baylor last year in the quarters
of NCAAs, it was match point and the girl
was serving at 15-40," Barte said. "I hit a
backhand return and she had a good first
ball back to my forehand. I was forced to hit
a running forehand and I remember think
ing 'l'm just going to hit this really hard.' I
hit the cleanest forehand I can remember
and it felt so good. It was not returnable, ba
sically, and clinched the match to send us to
the semis."
On the opposite side for tennis players is
the backhand and when one wants to
see backhands, one watches senior Jennifer
Yen. The only player on the team with a
one-handed backhand, she has mastered
her shot to allow greater variety and a
heavier shot than she had before with a tra
ditional, two-handed hit.
"With a one-hander, you can extend
more," said Yen. "With your left hand on
your racquet, you're limited by how far you
can extend it. With one hand, you can go
farther out in front. It's natural and easy for
me now. I can hit harder with a one-han
der."
Her switch from a two-handed back
hand to a one-handed version came about
in a rather unusual way not because of
the typical, technical reasoning.
"I started out with a two-handed back
hand when I first started playing tennis,"
Yen said. "That's what everyone did. But
when I was 13, a couple of the kids that I
played with had one-handers. I thought it
would be so cool to hit it."
From the baseline to the net, senior Car
olyn McVeigh is another player that wows
spectators with her shots. Her consistent
doubles success with junior Veronica Li at
the No. 3 spot has come about largely be
cause of McVeigh's quick hands and angled
volleys.
"It's a pretty integral part of my game, es-

pecially in doubles," McVeigh said.
"I try to move forward into the first
half of the court as often and as
early in the point as I can to put
pressure on our opponent. I like to
serve and volley most of the time
because I trust in my ability to
make volleys."
Here at Stanford, she has thrived
under the expert tutelage of Head
Coach Lele Forood, a former dou

bles specialist and an expert on vol
ley techniques.
"Lele is one of the best coaches at
volleying that you can come across,
and I try to work with her as much
as I can," McVeigh said. "Lele,
being a professional player and a
doubles specialist, is most able to
help me with my form on my vol
leys and my strategy."
Barte, Yen and McVeigh will
join the rest of the team for its next
match, against Utah on March 21 at
Taube Tennis Stadium.
