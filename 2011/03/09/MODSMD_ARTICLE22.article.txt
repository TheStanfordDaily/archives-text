## BEARS DEAL BITTER END TO SEASON 
### NIC REINER-PARRA 
In a season finale characterized by poor
shooting and porous defense, the Stanford
men's basketball team fell Saturday after
noon to rival Cal, 74-55.

The Cardinal (15-15, 7-11) had one of its
worst shooting performances of the year and
never had an answer for Cal (17-13, 10-8),
which led comfortably the entire game.
Cal burst out of the gate early, jumping to
an 8-2 lead by the first TV timeout with 15:25
left in the first half. Following the timeout, Cal
junior forward Harper Kamp made a layup

and Stanford freshman forward Dwight Pow
ell scored what would be the Cardinal's only
basket in the ensuing five minutes. With nine
minutes left in the first half, The Cardinal had
only four total points and trailed by 15.
The Bears were spearheaded by Kamp,
who had eight of Cal's first 14 points and was
a perfect 5-for-5 from the field in the first half.
At the seven-minute mark, Stanford was
down, 23-8, and had nearly as many turnovers
(seven) as it did points (eight). Cal continued
to force bad shots and create good ones of its
own with 1:50 remaining in the first half,
Cal led 33-15 and appeared to be coasting to
an insurmountable first-half lead. However,
in its first sign of life all game, the Cardinal
scored six points to end the half trailing 33-21.

my Green did everything he could
to keep the Cardinal in the game.
Riding smooth mid-range jumpers
and two three-pointers, Green
scored 14 of the Cardinal's 21 first
half points. No other Cardinal play
er had more than two points in the
half and the team as a whole shot 28
percent from the field.
Stanford came out harder in
the second, forcing three
turnovers and several missed
shots. The Cardinal scored the first
four points to pull within eight
(33-25) at the 17:30 mark. Cal then
turned its offense back on and
scored on each of its next 10 pos
sessions, pushing out its lead to 53-
32 with 11:23 left in the game. Cen
tral to the big run and to Cal's sec
ond half offense in general was
freshman guard Allen Crabbe,
who was electric for the whole 20
minutes he scored 21 of his 24
total points in the half, missing just
one shot and lighting Stanford's
defense up from every spot on the
court. From there, the game was
never in doubt. Shot after shot,
Cal extended its lead, getting as

far ahead as 28 with a minute left,
at 74-46.
In one of his best all-around
games of the season, Crabbe also
finished with nine rebounds. Cal
junior guard, Jorge Gutierrez,
spread the ball around with seven
assists and Kamp also contributed
in the second half, supporting
Crabbe and finishing with 20 points
of his own.

For the Cardinal, Green finished
with 19 points while the rest of the
team shot a collective 16-45 (35.5
percent) from the field on the
game. The Cardinal also shot an
abysmal 9-19 (47.4 percent) from
the free throw line.

Stanford will try to extend its
season at next week's Pac-10 tour
nament in Los Angeles. As the
eighth seed, the Cardinal will face
ninth-seeded Oregon State at 6:10
p.m. Wednesday in the first game of
an opening round doubleheader.
The Cardinal split the season series
with the Beavers, winning the first
game on Jan. 29, 70-56, and losing
Feb. 26, 87-80. If the Cardinal wins
that game, it will advance to play
No. 1 seed Arizona the next day.
