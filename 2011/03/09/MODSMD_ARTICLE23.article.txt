# TEXAS TAKES TWO FROM VISITING CARD
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Offensive struggles doomed Stan
ford baseball in two of three games in
Austin this weekend, as the No. 9 Cardi
nal could only win once against No. 6
Texas.

The Cardinal is 6-5 on the year and is
near the end of a tough nonconference
stretch that has included 10 games
against ranked teams. Though Stanford
mounted impressive come-from-be
hind efforts on both Friday and Sunday,
each fell short in 4-3 and 4-2 losses.

Texas starter Taylor Jungmann was
as impressive as expected on Friday af
ternoon, taking a perfect game into the
fifth frame before allowing his first run
of the season after 22.2 innings pitched.
Stanford sophomore Mark Appel,
meanwhile, gave up four runs in 7.1 in
nings.

Sophomore third baseman Stephen Piscotty, above,
gave the Cardinal a huge boost out of the three-hole
on Saturday with two hits and two RBI. The Cardinal
ultimately won that contest, 9-2.
The Longhorn star seemed
shakier in the ninth, allowing four
hits against five batters to start the
frame and giving up two runs before
being pulled. The Cardinal was in
position to steal the lead with two
runners on and two outs, down 4-3,
but a hard-knock comebacker
sealed the deal for Texas and gave
Appel his second close loss in a row.

Stanford's late momentum con
tinued into Saturday's matchup, as
the Cardinal scored early and often
to take a 3-0 lead going into a three
run fifth. Sophomore third baseman
Stephen Piscotty's second double of
the game knocked in a run before
the Longhorns' third error on the af
ternoon made the score 5-0. Fresh
man Lonnie Kauppila came up with
his second RBI single in as many
games for another Stanford run.
Texas's five errors three of
which were made by third baseman
Erich Weiss were too much for
the Longhorns to overcome as soph
omore Dean McArdle (2-0) allowed
just one run in 7.2 innings and the
Cardinal took the contest, 9-2.
But Texas made no errors on
Sunday, and Stanford had trouble
coming up with any offense until the
final two innings of the series.
The Cardinal kept things close
but still hadn't scored by the bottom

of the sixth, when sophomore out
fielder Jake Stewart lost a ball in the
sun, resulting in a Longhorn triple. A
wild pitch by junior Scott Snodgress
brought the runner in and made the
score 4-0 for Texas.

Stanford rallied in the eighth,
loading the bases on a walk and two
consecutive hits to start the inning.
Following an RBI single by fresh
man first baseman Brian Ragira,
sophomore Eric Smith grounded
into a double play, bringing in a run
but costing the Cardinal two crucial
outs. The next batter, freshman
Brian Guymon, struck out to end
the inning.
Senior Dave Giuliani singled to
lead off the ninth, but the three top
hitters in Stanford's order who
would finish with just one hit in 13
at-bats on the day couldn't close
the 4-2 gap. The matchup was also
the Cardinal's least impressive of
the series from a pitching stand
point, as Stanford hurlers walked
seven batters that's more bases
on balls than in the two previous
games combined.
Though Stewart hit safely in all
three games, continuing his impres
sive run with hits in 10 of 11 games,
he cooled off considerably over the
weekend, batting just .200 in the se
ries.
The Cardinal gets a week off for
finals before it plays Michigan in a
home series on March 18 and 19.
