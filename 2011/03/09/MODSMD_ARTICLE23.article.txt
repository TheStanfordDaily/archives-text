### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Offensive struggles doomed Stan
ford baseball in two of three games in
Austin this weekend, as the No. 9 Cardi
nal could only win once against No. 6
Texas.

The Cardinal is 6-5 on the year and is
near the end of a tough nonconference
stretch that has included 10 games
against ranked teams. Though Stanford
mounted impressive come-from-be
hind efforts on both Friday and Sunday,
each fell short in 4-3 and 4-2 losses.

Texas starter Taylor Jungmann was
as impressive as expected on Friday af
ternoon, taking a perfect game into the
fifth frame before allowing his first run
of the season after 22.2 innings pitched.
Stanford sophomore Mark Appel,
meanwhile, gave up four runs in 7.1 in
nings.

gave the Cardinal a huge boost out of the three-hole
on Saturday with two hits and two RBI. The Cardinal
ultimately won that contest, 9-2.
