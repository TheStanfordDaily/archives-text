# March Madness Musings
## 
### Dan Bohm Jacob Jaffe 
It's officially March, so it's
officially time for some
madness. Unfortunately
for men's basketball fans on the Farm, Stanford isn't
exactly the best campus to be on during the Big
Dance. The first issue is the academic one. I feel like I've
tackled this one in the past. As college basketball warms up
for its big tournament in a week with conference tourna
ments this week, Stanford similarly prepares for its culmi
nation Finals Week with its preamble, Dead Week.
(And if somebody could explain to me what, if anything, is
dead about Dead Week, that would answer a question I've
been trying to address for five years now).
The second issue is that Stanford's men's basketball
team is a complete non-factor in the madness. The Cardi
nal ended its regular season with a less-than-inspiring (to
put it nicely) performance at rival Cal last weekend the
Bears shellacked the Cardinal, who at one point looked
like it may not score 20 points all game, but managed to put
up 55 in a 19-point loss. Now Stanford must win a play-in
game just to be a part of the Pac-10 tournament. If the Car
dinal can beat Oregon State in that play-in game, it gets a
date with the No. 1 seed, Arizona. That leaves Stanford's
chances of going dancing about even with the chances that
the Minnesota Timbcrwolvcs make the NBA playoffs
not going to happen.
What is unfortunate is that Stanford juniors have never en
joyed a Stanford basketball game in the NCAA tournament.
The last time the Cardinal played in the tournament, it lost in
the Sweet Sixteen to Texas. That was 2008 —Trent Johnson
was still the team's coach and the Lopez twins (Brook and
Robin) were still locking down the paint. Now Trent Johnson
is at LSU (although that may not last), the Lopez twins are
NBA fixtures and Stanford looks to be nowhere near where it
needs to be to get back to the tournament.
Sure, the Cardinal has some promising young players
but this is not a Stanford team of the late 90s or early
2000s. It is still a team that lacks athletes, consistent point
guard play and star power. When Stanford will return to
the Big Dance is anyone's guess.

There is good news for basketball fans this is shap
ing up to be one heck of an NCAA tournament. There is
no clear-cut favorite and any number of teams are capable
of cutting the nets down in early April.
Ohio State and Kansas have to be seen as the two fa
vorites, but even that is a stretch. Defending champion
Duke has looked beatable in recent weeks, Texas has gone
through a pseudo-collapse and BYU recently kicked one
of its best players off the team.

There are the surging teams and the underdogs. North
Carolina looks very tough to beat these days. So does
Kansas State. How about a Cinderella? Will we see anoth
er George Mason? If so, who will it be? George Mason?
Your guess is as good as mine, I suppose.
Then there are other storylines, like the Big East. Will it
get 11 teams in the Tournament? No conference has ever
gotten nine teams in, but the Big East has 11 real contenders.
Unfortunately for Big East teams, the gauntlet of a confer
ence schedule could help them be tournament-ready—but
it may well have worn teams out. My guess? A Big East team
won't win the national title. Pittsburgh and Notre Dame are
legitimate possibilities, but I'm betting both will wear down
at some point before the title game.

Regardless, even with how difficult Stanford makes it
to enjoy the NCAA tournament, there is a lot to be had,
even for Cardinal fans.

Dan Bohm has lost every March Madness pool he has
ever entered. Every single one. To give him a pep talk, or
to just send him a completed bracket to submit this year, e
mail him at bohmd@stanford.edu.

The calendar has
reached March, which
means it's time for
sports heaven. That's right, folks, March Mad
ness is upon us, and I couldn't be more excited.
Now, I've written before about how much I love college
football bowl season, and those days watching bowls are
some of my favorite of the year. College football is my fa
vorite sport, and while its current system has flaws the size
of Charlie Sheen's ego, it still creates one hell of a bowl
season.

That said, nothing can top the excitement of March
Madness. Think about it what other sporting event can
consume an entire month (or more) and keep people in
terested enough to name the whole month for it? Where
the month of October has lost some of its luster as the
World Series moves into November, March Madness is as
mad as ever even though the Final Four is in April.
Why does America catch a case of March Madness
every year? Because the NCAA tournament (and the
conference tournaments leading up to it) provide the per
fect blend of amazing performances, enormous mistakes,
thrilling finishes, explosive controversies, ground-shatter
ing upsets and, perhaps most of all, the best system in the
sports world for fan picking.

While you may think that I am overstating the impor
tance of betting by saying that bracket competitions drive
March Madness, stop and consider how you view the
NCAA tournament. I'd be willing to bet that 99 percent of
people who watch the tournament are in at least one
bracket-picking competition. And the other 1 percent
(don't worry, not you, Rick Neuheisel) consists of people
whose jobs don't allow them to. It wouldn't be March
Madness if you weren't waiting with bated breath, clutch
ing your bracket in prayer as your Cinderella pick in
bounded the ball with a chance to topple that No. 3 seed.
The great thing about March Madness is the way it in
vites competition, even among those of us with no ability
to influence the outcome of any of the games (I'm looking
at you, baseball fans. You can wear your hat upside-down
and put on the same socks you've worn all season, but it
won't make your team do any better). The looks of utter
devastation or unimagined joy on the faces of the players
are matched only by the looks of fans across the nation
that correctly picked that upset.

If you're new to college basketball, you may think I'm
kidding, but I still remember correctly guessing Vermont
over Syracuse six years ago. The pride of that pick was one
of the first things I shared with a guy on my freshman hall
way who ended up becoming one of my best friends (not
to mention the editor in chief of this paper).
Of course, for every great win, there's an agonizing de
feat (or in my case, many agonizing defeats). If Derrick
Rose and Chris Douglas-Roberts hadn't done their best
Chuck Hayes impressions in the final minutes of the title
game against Kansas in 2008,1 would have won my fami
ly's competition. Everyone has one of those moments that
he or she can point to, and those, just as much as the wins,
make March Madness amazing.

I've never won or lost a cent betting on NCAA tour
nament games, but every year, every game feels like life or
death. Stanford almost certainly won't be making the Big
Dance, and I don't particularly root for any other teams
passionately. But for the next month, with a wide-open
field and upsets undoubtedly cropping up wherever you
don't expect them to, March Madness will be my life.

If you think Jacob Jaffe needs to get over that one pick
six years ago, or if you just want into his betting pool
(and he has one I promise), hit him up at jwjaffe@stan

needs to be to get back to the tournament.
Sure, the Cardinal has some promising young players
but this is not a Stanford team of the late 90s or early
2000s. It is still a team that lacks athletes, consistent point
guard play and star power. When Stanford will return to
the Big Dance is anyone's guess.

There is good news for basketball fans this is shap
ing up to be one heck of an NCAA tournament. There is
no clear-cut favorite and any number of teams are capable
of cutting the nets down in early April.
Ohio State and Kansas have to be seen as the two fa
vorites, but even that is a stretch. Defending champion
Duke has looked beatable in recent weeks, Texas has gone
through a pseudo-collapse and BYU recently kicked one
of its best players off the team.

There are the surging teams and the underdogs. North
Carolina looks very tough to beat these days. So does
Kansas State. How about a Cinderella? Will we see anoth
er George Mason? If so, who will it be? George Mason?
Your guess is as good as mine, I suppose.
Then there are other storylines, like the Big East. Will it
get 11 teams in the Tournament? No conference has ever
gotten nine teams in, but the Big East has 11 real contenders.
Unfortunately for Big East teams, the gauntlet of a confer
ence schedule could help them be tournament-ready—but
it may well have worn teams out. My guess? A Big East team
won't win the national title. Pittsburgh and Notre Dame are
legitimate possibilities, but I'm betting both will wear down
at some point before the title game.

Regardless, even with how difficult Stanford makes it
to enjoy the NCAA tournament, there is a lot to be had,
even for Cardinal fans.

Dan Bohm has lost every March Madness pool he has
ever entered. Every single one. To give him a pep talk, or
to just send him a completed bracket to submit this year, e
mail him at bohmd@stanford.edu.

The calendar has
reached March, which
means it's time for
sports heaven. That's right, folks, March Mad
ness is upon us, and I couldn't be more excited.
Now, I've written before about how much I love college
football bowl season, and those days watching bowls are
some of my favorite of the year. College football is my fa
vorite sport, and while its current system has flaws the size
of Charlie Sheen's ego, it still creates one hell of a bowl
season.

That said, nothing can top the excitement of March
Madness. Think about it what other sporting event can
consume an entire month (or more) and keep people in
terested enough to name the whole month for it? Where
the month of October has lost some of its luster as the
World Series moves into November, March Madness is as
mad as ever even though the Final Four is in April.
Why does America catch a case of March Madness
every year? Because the NCAA tournament (and the
conference tournaments leading up to it) provide the per
fect blend of amazing performances, enormous mistakes,
thrilling finishes, explosive controversies, ground-shatter
ing upsets and, perhaps most of all, the best system in the
sports world for fan picking.

While you may think that I am overstating the impor
tance of betting by saying that bracket competitions drive
March Madness, stop and consider how you view the
NCAA tournament. I'd be willing to bet that 99 percent of
people who watch the tournament are in at least one
bracket-picking competition. And the other 1 percent
(don't worry, not you, Rick Neuheisel) consists of people
whose jobs don't allow them to. It wouldn't be March
Madness if you weren't waiting with bated breath, clutch
ing your bracket in prayer as your Cinderella pick in
bounded the ball with a chance to topple that No. 3 seed.
The great thing about March Madness is the way it in
vites competition, even among those of us with no ability
to influence the outcome of any of the games (I'm looking
at you, baseball fans. You can wear your hat upside-down
and put on the same socks you've worn all season, but it
won't make your team do any better). The looks of utter
devastation or unimagined joy on the faces of the players
are matched only by the looks of fans across the nation
that correctly picked that upset.

If you're new to college basketball, you may think I'm
kidding, but I still remember correctly guessing Vermont
over Syracuse six years ago. The pride of that pick was one
of the first things I shared with a guy on my freshman hall
way who ended up becoming one of my best friends (not
to mention the editor in chief of this paper).
Of course, for every great win, there's an agonizing de
feat (or in my case, many agonizing defeats). If Derrick
Rose and Chris Douglas-Roberts hadn't done their best
Chuck Hayes impressions in the final minutes of the title
game against Kansas in 2008,1 would have won my fami
ly's competition. Everyone has one of those moments that
he or she can point to, and those, just as much as the wins,
make March Madness amazing.

I've never won or lost a cent betting on NCAA tour
nament games, but every year, every game feels like life or
death. Stanford almost certainly won't be making the Big
Dance, and I don't particularly root for any other teams
passionately. But for the next month, with a wide-open
field and upsets undoubtedly cropping up wherever you
don't expect them to, March Madness will be my life.

If you think Jacob Jaffe needs to get over that one pick
six years ago, or if you just want into his betting pool
(and he has one I promise), hit him up at jwjaffe@stan
ford.edu.
It's officially March, so it's
officially time for some
madness. Unfortunately
for men's basketball fans on the Farm, Stanford isn't
exactly the best campus to be on during the Big
Dance. The first issue is the academic one. I feel like I've
tackled this one in the past. As college basketball warms up
for its big tournament in a week with conference tourna
ments this week, Stanford similarly prepares for its culmi
nation Finals Week with its preamble, Dead Week.
(And if somebody could explain to me what, if anything, is
dead about Dead Week, that would answer a question I've
been trying to address for five years now).
The second issue is that Stanford's men's basketball
team is a complete non-factor in the madness. The Cardi
nal ended its regular season with a less-than-inspiring (to
put it nicely) performance at rival Cal last weekend the
Bears shellacked the Cardinal, who at one point looked
like it may not score 20 points all game, but managed to put
up 55 in a 19-point loss. Now Stanford must win a play-in
game just to be a part of the Pac-10 tournament. If the Car
dinal can beat Oregon State in that play-in game, it gets a
date with the No. 1 seed, Arizona. That leaves Stanford's
chances of going dancing about even with the chances that
the Minnesota Timbcrwolvcs make the NBA playoffs
not going to happen.
What is unfortunate is that Stanford juniors have never en
joyed a Stanford basketball game in the NCAA tournament.
The last time the Cardinal played in the tournament, it lost in
the Sweet Sixteen to Texas. That was 2008 —Trent Johnson
was still the team's coach and the Lopez twins (Brook and
Robin) were still locking down the paint. Now Trent Johnson
is at LSU (although that may not last), the Lopez twins are
NBA fixtures and Stanford looks to be nowhere near where it
needs to be to get back to the tournament.
