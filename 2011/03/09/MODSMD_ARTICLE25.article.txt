# WOMEN STILL PERFECT

### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
The No. 1 Stanford women's water polo team contin
ued its impressive season last weekend, winning its first
two games over No. 9 San Diego State and No. 11 Long
Beach State. The Cardinal (15-0, 1-0 MPSF) beat the
Aztecs 12-4 and defeated Long Beach State 11-3.
After undefeated performances in the Michigan
Kickoff and Stanford and UCI Invitationals, Stanford
opened up its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation sea
son against San Diego State (9-7,0-2) on Saturday and
kept its momentum going.
On the offensive end, the Cardinal continued using
a diversified attack as seven different players scored.
The strong goalie play by Aztec junior Kelly Campoli,
who tallied 12 saves, was not strong enough to answer
Stanford's offense.
Sophomore two-meter Annika Dries led the Stan
ford attack with three goals, which led all scorers in the
game. Sophomores drivers Vee Dunlevie and Victoria
Kennedy, along with junior two-meter Melissa Seide
mann, contributed with a pair of goals each. Junior driv
ers Cassie Churnside and Alyssa Lo joined senior driv
er Kim Krueger in posting one goal apiece.
In addition to excellent offensive play, the team held
its opponent under five goals for the seventh-time this
season with senior goalie Amber Oland recording
seven saves.

The following day, Stanford looked for its 15th victo
ry of the season against non-conference opponent Long
Beach State (4-9). After one quarter of play, the Card
found itself in unfamiliar territory, down 1-0 after a goal
by 49er Julia Garyfallou. However, Stanford quickly
answered in the next period with four goals from four
different players: Dries, freshmen driver Kaley Dod
son, sophomore driver Jillian Garton and junior driver
Pallavi Menon.
Stanford held a 4-2 lead going into halftime and

never looked back. Despite a ten-save effort by senior
goalie Kristen Stragier of Long Beach State, the Card
went on a 7-1 run to win 11-3 against the 49ers.
Lo led the Card with a hat-trick. In addition, Dries
and Garton each had a pair of goals in the win.
With its performance over the weekend, Stanford
has now scored ten or more goals 14 times this season.
The only time Stanford didn't score 10 goals was in a 9-
6 win over defending NCAA champion and second
ranked USC. In addition, 11 out of 15 victories have
come by a margin of eight goals or more. Dries is now
first on the team with 26 goals.
The team will have this weekend off before continu
ing its MPSF season against Arizona State in Tempe on
Saturday, March 19. The next scheduled home game for
Stanford will be on March 26 against UCLA.
