# Hate for its own sake?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's March, which only means one
thing: the NCAA Basketball
Tournament is coming. Practically
unheard of my side of the Atlantic,
this annual event is certainly a
highlight of my sporting life in America.
Last year the women's side of the tour
nament captured most of my attention,
partly because I was a beat writer for the
Stanford team, but also because they
had a great chance of going all the way. I
did, however, catch a bit from the men's
tournament, including the final (where
Duke narrowly defeated Butler) in a
sports bar up in San Francisco.

The reason I had strayed so far from
campus was because I was watching it
with a friend who did her undergrad at
Duke. She was there because she want
ed to find a place where she'd have safe
ty in numbers with fellow Blue Devils
fans But even in this safe haven, I was
struck by how many people just did not
like Duke. Most weren't Butler fans or
alumni from Duke's rival schools in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, but they
were certainly not neutrals. They really,

really wanted Duke to lose.
Being English, I can certainly sympa
thize with the Blue Devils fans. Each
time a major international soccer tour
nament rolls around, there is a notice
able contingent within the UK of North
em Irish, Scottish and Welsh fans sup
porting ABE (Anyone ButEngland).ln
return,many Englandfans—who often
have family links to one or other of those
Celtic countries —will brush the dislike
away and happily lend their support
when roles are reversed. There might be
longstanding political and soccer rival
ries between those nations and Eng
land, but it is hard to keep those going
when we rarely play games against each
other and live in a pretty equal society.
The enmity goes only one way.
But being an English soccer fan, I can
also sympathize with the haters. Man
chester United is a hugely successful and
well-supported team over here, but I re
ally don't like them. And I'm not alone.
They really are a polarizing club: their
phenomenal success in recent years,
frustratingly a result of being one of the
best-managed clubs in the World, has
earned them many fans but lent them a

perceived arrogance that has created
even more enemies In fact, as I write this
column, I'm happily watching their big
rivals, Liverpool, conclusively beat
them.

I'm not sure why Duke is so hated. It
has certainly had success, but four Na
tional Championships spread over
twenty years doesn't make it unbeat
able, As a university, it is also known for
being a rich, private institution —so
perhaps it's because Dukies are elitist.
But then there are many others in that
category,including Stanford, which easi
ly have more than its fair share of athlet
ic dominance. It could be its style of play,
some suggesting that Duke players
manage to win more fouls than have re
ally been committed, but even that does
n't seem a good enough reason. If that
were really true, then officials would
slowly get wise to the ruse.

Looking in as an outside observer, it
is strange that the Blue Devils are so dis
liked — and a little unpalatable. Some
fans surely harbor real justification for
hating Duke, but I wonder if many just
do it because that's what you do.
And it makes me start to reevaluate
my own choices in sport. Next week
Manchester United has an important
match against foreign opposition in the
Champions League. If they win, it won't
hurt any of the teams I have a soft spot
for domestically, but it will help raise the
profile of the English league in general.
Maybe I need to bite my lip and honest
ly cheer for the Red Devils.

Tom Taylor also enjoys rooting for the
Arizona State Sun Devils and New Jer
sey Devils. Contact him about watching
