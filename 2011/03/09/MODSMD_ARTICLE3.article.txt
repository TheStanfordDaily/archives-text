# Stanford athletes had access to 'easy' course list
## 
### RYAN MAC AMY JULIA HARRIS CALIFORNIA WATCH 
A drama class in "Beginning
Improvising" and another in "So
cial Dances of North America III"
were among dozens of classes on a
closely guarded quarterly list dis
tributed only to Stanford athletes
to help them choose classes.
Stanford officials said the list

was designed to accommodate ath
letes' demanding schedules and
disputed that the list was made up
of easy courses. Officials discontin
ued the list last week after student
reporters working for California
Watch began asking about it.
The list, which has existed at
least since 2001, was widely regard
ed by athletes as an easy class list.
More than a quarter of the courses
on the list did not fulfill university

general education requirements.
"It's definitely not going to be a
hard class if it's coming off that
list," said Karissa Cook, a sopho
more women's volleyball player,
who consulted the list to pick class
es in her first quarter at Stanford.

The classes on the list were "al
ways chock-full of athletes and
very easy A's," added Kira Maker, a
women's soccer player, who used
the list her freshman year.

Titled "courses of interest," the
list was distributed by the Athletic
Academic Resource Center. Ad
visers in other departments at the
University said they were unaware
such a list existed.

Stanford has long mandated
equal scholastic footing among all
undergraduates, including athletes.
Many of its student athletes, in fact,
have distinguished themselves in the
classroom, notably football stars An
drew Luck, who has a 3.5 GPA, and
Owen Marecic, who plans to gradu
ate this year with a degree in human
biology. The university's hard-line
approach has rankled some coaches
over the years who have watched tal
ented recruits go elsewhere because
they didn't measure up to Stanford's
academic standards.

But some faculty and students say
the list may have offered an academ
ic advantage for the athletes who re
quested it especially since the
general population was unaware it
was even available.The Athletic Aca
demic Resource Center didn't adver
tise the list or post it on its website.
But athletes have been known to ask
for it.

Athletes said they heard about
the list by word of mouth or simply
picked up the document at the re
source center.

"There's a perception that the
classes are easier," said Carly Villare
al, captain of the Stanford women's
crew team. "Some of the classes are
substantially easier."
Austin Lee, director of academic
services at the Athletic Academic
Resource Center, disagreed.
"An objective evaluation of the
courses included on the list reveals
several courses that most students
would consider to be academically
rigorous," Lee said. He did not iden
tify specific classes.
Lee said the center's four advisers
compiled the list to help student ath
letes find introductory classes that fit
into constrained time schedules and
fulfill general education require
ments. Afternoon team practices
mean that athletes have to choose
classes that start in the morning and
early afternoon typically classes
that begin from 9 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.
The list mostly contained classes dur
ing those hours.
Before officials discontinued the
list, Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of
freshmen and undergraduate advis
ing, said with other scheduling re
sources available to all students, per
haps the list was "unnecessary."
Gerald Gurney, president of the
National Association of Academic
Advisers for Athletics, was unaware
of the situation at Stanford, and was
unwilling to speculate on the matter.
His association, a collection of col
lege academic advisers throughout
the nation, focuses on promoting the
integrity of athlete advising.
"The ethical duty of academic ad
visers working with student athletes
is to assist them in achieving their
personal academic goals and to help
them not take the path of easiest re
sistance for the purpose of maintain
ing eligibility," he said.
"The course list in itself isn't a vio
lation, but promoting courses be
cause they're easy isn't, ethically,
something that academic advisers
should do," he said.
The 40 classes on the winter quar

ter list included "Intro to Statistics"
and "Elementary Economics." The
list also included 14 classes that didn't
meet general education require
ments, including the "Beginning Im
provising," and "Social Dances"
courses in addition to "Public Speak
ing," one of the only evening classes
on the list.

Nearly 200 courses in 16 academ
ic departments and programs offered
during the 9 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. time
slots were left off the list, a review of
online course catalogs showed.
Sociology professor Cecilia
Ridgeway was surprised to learn that
her class titled "Interpersonal Rela
tions" was included on the winter
quarter list. Ridgeway said she had
heard about the document in years
past and talked to the athletics de
partment about removing her class
from the list. She said department
staff told her at the time that the list
did not exist.

Like many professors whose
courses are on the list, Ridgeway said
her class is academically challenging,
noting that she had given failing
grades to student athletes to the
displeasure of the athletics depart
ment.

Other professors were uncon
cerned that a class they taught made
it onto the list. Some, in fact, said they
believed student athletes should be
treated differently than the typical
student.

"(Stanford) accommodates ath
letes in the manner that they accom
modate students with disabilities,"
said Donald Barr, who teaches a
course titled "Social Class, Race, Eth
nicity, Health," which was highlight
ed by resource center advisers.
Some faculty members said they
didn't believe the list harmed anyone
and may have helped fill their
classrooms.

Art history lecturer Thomas Beis
cher, a former Stanford rower, said
he welcomed the boost in enrollment
brought by the inclusion of his class
on the list.
While the list has an intended au
dience of student athletes, Lythcott-
Haims said any Stanford student
could have obtained a copy of the
document, which was available only
in hard copy from the offices of the
Athletic Academic Resource Center

in the basement of the Arrillaga
Center for Sports and Recreation.
But Miriam Marks, a Stanford
senior and Daily columnist who was
told about the list, said the list is es
sentially only for the athlete commu
nity.
"The biggest drawback is that it is
specifically made available to ath
letes," Marks said. "If it was pub
lished to the entire student body,
that's a different thing. If I were to
walk in and ask for the list, they
would ask me why I needed it, since
I'm not an athlete."
Some academic advisers outside
the resource center found out about
the list when they were shown a copy

of it by student reporters. They said
there was no comparable list for stu
dents who are not athletes.

"I don't have a go-to list for easier
classes," said Melissa Stevenson, one
of the school's eight academic direc
tors located at student residences.
"As far as I know, there's no decided
answer to which classes are easier
and how to take an easier quarter."
Lythcott-Haims said the school
has made accommodations for stu
dent athletes because they "have the
most constrained schedules of any
Stanford students."

"The list originated before the
university's transition to an (sic)
searchable on-line bulletin when stu
dents had no practical, efficient
means to navigate the printed bul
letin," Lee wrote in an e-mail re
sponse to student reporters.
But for at least the last seven
years, the university has provided
other ways for students to find class
es, including Axess an online in
terface that enables students to sort
and choose classes by time.

Until spring 2009, Stanford also
printed and widely distributed the
"time schedule," which listed all the
quarter's offerings by time.

Stanford students now also can
use the online options of Courseß
ank and Explore Courses to help sort
classes based on time offered and
general education requirements.
Lee and Lythcott-Haims said the
list was meant to serve as the begin
ning of an advising conversation.
"We're not handing it out and dis
tributing it all around," said Lythcott-
Haims.

But student athletes said they typ
ically just picked up a copy of the list
and left. In some cases, no advising
conversation ever took place.
"Literally, when you walk into the
AARC, right next to the door, it's
right there," said Ryan Sudeck, a jun
ior on the men's crew team.

"I never used it before this year,"
he continued. "I was trying to get my
requirements done. But this quarter
it was like,'Oh, I need an easy class to
boost my GPA.'"

Susan Simoni Burk, the former
assistant athletic director for student
services who oversaw the Athletic
Academic Resource Center's advis
ing efforts from 1995 to 2009, said any
student, athlete or not, could pick up
the list. But she also noted that stu
dents who were not athletes rarely
had reason to visit the offices.
"They were put on a table, and
usually they were gone within the
first day," she said.

quested it especially since the
general population was unaware it
was even available.The Athletic Aca
demic Resource Center didn't adver
tise the list or post it on its website.
But athletes have been known to ask
for it.

Athletes said they heard about
the list by word of mouth or simply
picked up the document at the re
source center.

"There's a perception that the
classes are easier," said Carly Villare
al, captain of the Stanford women's
crew team. "Some of the classes are
substantially easier."
Austin Lee, director of academic
services at the Athletic Academic
Resource Center, disagreed.
"An objective evaluation of the
courses included on the list reveals
several courses that most students
would consider to be academically
rigorous," Lee said. He did not iden
tify specific classes.
Lee said the center's four advisers
compiled the list to help student ath
letes find introductory classes that fit
into constrained time schedules and
fulfill general education require
ments. Afternoon team practices
mean that athletes have to choose
classes that start in the morning and
early afternoon typically classes
that begin from 9 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.
The list mostly contained classes dur
ing those hours.
Before officials discontinued the
list, Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of
freshmen and undergraduate advis
ing, said with other scheduling re
sources available to all students, per
haps the list was "unnecessary."
Gerald Gurney, president of the
National Association of Academic
Advisers for Athletics, was unaware
of the situation at Stanford, and was
unwilling to speculate on the matter.
His association, a collection of col
lege academic advisers throughout
the nation, focuses on promoting the
integrity of athlete advising.
"The ethical duty of academic ad
visers working with student athletes
is to assist them in achieving their
personal academic goals and to help
them not take the path of easiest re
sistance for the purpose of maintain
ing eligibility," he said.
"The course list in itself isn't a vio
lation, but promoting courses be
cause they're easy isn't, ethically,
something that academic advisers
should do," he said.
The 40 classes on the winter quar

ter list included "Intro to Statistics"
and "Elementary Economics." The
list also included 14 classes that didn't
meet general education require
ments, including the "Beginning Im
provising," and "Social Dances"
courses in addition to "Public Speak
ing," one of the only evening classes
on the list.

Nearly 200 courses in 16 academ
ic departments and programs offered
during the 9 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. time
slots were left off the list, a review of
online course catalogs showed.
Sociology professor Cecilia
Ridgeway was surprised to learn that
her class titled "Interpersonal Rela
tions" was included on the winter
quarter list. Ridgeway said she had
heard about the document in years
past and talked to the athletics de
partment about removing her class
from the list. She said department
staff told her at the time that the list
did not exist.

Like many professors whose
courses are on the list, Ridgeway said
her class is academically challenging,
noting that she had given failing
grades to student athletes to the
displeasure of the athletics depart
ment.

Other professors were uncon
cerned that a class they taught made
it onto the list. Some, in fact, said they
believed student athletes should be
treated differently than the typical
student.

"(Stanford) accommodates ath
letes in the manner that they accom
modate students with disabilities,"
said Donald Barr, who teaches a
course titled "Social Class, Race, Eth
nicity, Health," which was highlight
ed by resource center advisers.
Some faculty members said they
didn't believe the list harmed anyone
and may have helped fill their
classrooms.

Art history lecturer Thomas Beis
cher, a former Stanford rower, said
he welcomed the boost in enrollment
brought by the inclusion of his class
on the list.
While the list has an intended au
dience of student athletes, Lythcott-
Haims said any Stanford student
could have obtained a copy of the
document, which was available only
in hard copy from the offices of the
Athletic Academic Resource Center

in the basement of the Arrillaga
Center for Sports and Recreation.
But Miriam Marks, a Stanford
senior and Daily columnist who was
told about the list, said the list is es
sentially only for the athlete commu
nity.
"The biggest drawback is that it is
specifically made available to ath
letes," Marks said. "If it was pub
lished to the entire student body,
that's a different thing. If I were to
walk in and ask for the list, they
would ask me why I needed it, since
I'm not an athlete."
Some academic advisers outside
the resource center found out about
the list when they were shown a copy

of it by student reporters. They said
there was no comparable list for stu
dents who are not athletes.

"I don't have a go-to list for easier
classes," said Melissa Stevenson, one
of the school's eight academic direc
tors located at student residences.
"As far as I know, there's no decided
answer to which classes are easier
and how to take an easier quarter."
Lythcott-Haims said the school
has made accommodations for stu
dent athletes because they "have the
most constrained schedules of any
Stanford students."

"The list originated before the
university's transition to an (sic)
searchable on-line bulletin when stu
dents had no practical, efficient
means to navigate the printed bul
letin," Lee wrote in an e-mail re
sponse to student reporters.
But for at least the last seven
years, the university has provided
other ways for students to find class
es, including Axess an online in
terface that enables students to sort
and choose classes by time.

Until spring 2009, Stanford also
printed and widely distributed the
"time schedule," which listed all the
quarter's offerings by time.

Stanford students now also can
use the online options of Courseß
ank and Explore Courses to help sort
classes based on time offered and
general education requirements.
Lee and Lythcott-Haims said the
list was meant to serve as the begin
ning of an advising conversation.
"We're not handing it out and dis
tributing it all around," said Lythcott-
Haims.

But student athletes said they typ
ically just picked up a copy of the list
and left. In some cases, no advising
conversation ever took place.
"Literally, when you walk into the
AARC, right next to the door, it's
right there," said Ryan Sudeck, a jun
ior on the men's crew team.

"I never used it before this year,"
he continued. "I was trying to get my
requirements done. But this quarter
it was like,'Oh, I need an easy class to
boost my GPA.'"

Susan Simoni Burk, the former
assistant athletic director for student
services who oversaw the Athletic
Academic Resource Center's advis
ing efforts from 1995 to 2009, said any
student, athlete or not, could pick up
the list. But she also noted that stu
dents who were not athletes rarely
had reason to visit the offices.
"They were put on a table, and
usually they were gone within the
first day," she said.

The class was under the direction of
California Watch Editorial Director
Mark Hatches.
A drama class in "Beginning
Improvising" and another in "So

were among dozens of classes on a
closely guarded quarterly list dis
tributed only to Stanford athletes
to help them choose classes.
Stanford officials said the list

was designed to accommodate ath
letes' demanding schedules and
disputed that the list was made up
of easy courses. Officials discontin
ued the list last week after student
reporters working for California
Watch began asking about it.
The list, which has existed at
least since 2001, was widely regard
ed by athletes as an easy class list.
More than a quarter of the courses
on the list did not fulfill university

general education requirements.
"It's definitely not going to be a
hard class if it's coming off that
list," said Karissa Cook, a sopho
more women's volleyball player,
who consulted the list to pick class
es in her first quarter at Stanford.

The classes on the list were "al
ways chock-full of athletes and
very easy A's," added Kira Maker, a
women's soccer player, who used
the list her freshman year.

Titled "courses of interest," the
list was distributed by the Athletic
Academic Resource Center. Ad
visers in other departments at the
University said they were unaware
such a list existed.

Stanford has long mandated
equal scholastic footing among all
undergraduates, including athletes.
Many of its student athletes, in fact,
have distinguished themselves in the
classroom, notably football stars An
drew Luck, who has a 3.5 GPA, and
Owen Marecic, who plans to gradu
ate this year with a degree in human
biology. The university's hard-line
approach has rankled some coaches
over the years who have watched tal
ented recruits go elsewhere because
they didn't measure up to Stanford's
academic standards.

the list may have offered an academ

lation, but promoting courses be
cause they're easy isn't, ethically,
something that academic advisers
should do," he said.
The 40 classes on the winter quar

ter list included "Intro to Statistics"
and "Elementary Economics." The
list also included 14 classes that didn't
meet general education require
ments, including the "Beginning Im
provising," and "Social Dances"
courses in addition to "Public Speak
ing," one of the only evening classes
on the list.

Nearly 200 courses in 16 academ
ic departments and programs offered
during the 9 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. time
slots were left off the list, a review of
online course catalogs showed.
Sociology professor Cecilia
Ridgeway was surprised to learn that
her class titled "Interpersonal Rela
tions" was included on the winter
quarter list. Ridgeway said she had
heard about the document in years
past and talked to the athletics de
partment about removing her class
from the list. She said department
staff told her at the time that the list
did not exist.

Like many professors whose
courses are on the list, Ridgeway said
her class is academically challenging,
noting that she had given failing
grades to student athletes to the
displeasure of the athletics depart
ment.

Other professors were uncon
cerned that a class they taught made
it onto the list. Some, in fact, said they
believed student athletes should be
treated differently than the typical
student.

"(Stanford) accommodates ath
letes in the manner that they accom
modate students with disabilities,"
said Donald Barr, who teaches a
course titled "Social Class, Race, Eth
nicity, Health," which was highlight
ed by resource center advisers.
Some faculty members said they
didn't believe the list harmed anyone
and may have helped fill their
classrooms.

Art history lecturer Thomas Beis
cher, a former Stanford rower, said
he welcomed the boost in enrollment
brought by the inclusion of his class
on the list.
While the list has an intended au
dience of student athletes, Lythcott-
Haims said any Stanford student
could have obtained a copy of the
document, which was available only
in hard copy from the offices of the
Athletic Academic Resource Center

in the basement of the Arrillaga
Center for Sports and Recreation.
But Miriam Marks, a Stanford
senior and Daily columnist who was
told about the list, said the list is es
sentially only for the athlete commu
nity.
"The biggest drawback is that it is
specifically made available to ath
letes," Marks said. "If it was pub
lished to the entire student body,
that's a different thing. If I were to
walk in and ask for the list, they
would ask me why I needed it, since
I'm not an athlete."
Some academic advisers outside
the resource center found out about
the list when they were shown a copy

of it by student reporters. They said
there was no comparable list for stu
dents who are not athletes.

"I don't have a go-to list for easier
classes," said Melissa Stevenson, one
of the school's eight academic direc
tors located at student residences.
"As far as I know, there's no decided
answer to which classes are easier
and how to take an easier quarter."
Lythcott-Haims said the school
has made accommodations for stu
dent athletes because they "have the
most constrained schedules of any
Stanford students."

"The list originated before the
university's transition to an (sic)
searchable on-line bulletin when stu
dents had no practical, efficient
means to navigate the printed bul
letin," Lee wrote in an e-mail re
sponse to student reporters.
But for at least the last seven
years, the university has provided
other ways for students to find class
es, including Axess an online in
terface that enables students to sort
and choose classes by time.

Until spring 2009, Stanford also
printed and widely distributed the
"time schedule," which listed all the
quarter's offerings by time.

Stanford students now also can
use the online options of Courseß
ank and Explore Courses to help sort
classes based on time offered and
general education requirements.
Lee and Lythcott-Haims said the
list was meant to serve as the begin
ning of an advising conversation.
"We're not handing it out and dis
tributing it all around," said Lythcott-
Haims.

But student athletes said they typ
ically just picked up a copy of the list
and left. In some cases, no advising
conversation ever took place.
"Literally, when you walk into the
AARC, right next to the door, it's
right there," said Ryan Sudeck, a jun
ior on the men's crew team.

"I never used it before this year,"
he continued. "I was trying to get my
requirements done. But this quarter
it was like,'Oh, I need an easy class to
boost my GPA.'"

Susan Simoni Burk, the former
assistant athletic director for student
services who oversaw the Athletic
Academic Resource Center's advis
ing efforts from 1995 to 2009, said any
student, athlete or not, could pick up
the list. But she also noted that stu
dents who were not athletes rarely
had reason to visit the offices.
"They were put on a table, and
usually they were gone within the
first day," she said.
