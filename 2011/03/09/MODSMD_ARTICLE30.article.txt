# I Ways to know you're unprepared top five for finals
## 
### 
I lappy dead week folks! Now comes that glorious time of the quarter
when we collectively melt down and freak out. For some of us, it's when
we realize we'd rather stick pushpins into our heads or strangle a monkey

than study. Others would rather lick the lint off the ground. While some
how, most of us manage to pull it together, there's always an unfortunate
few who don't. Here are some red flags that suggest you may fall into the
latter category.

1

Your book still
makes that
fresh, cracking
sound.

You've flirted with the idea of opening it but have
put it off until now. It's always satisfying to crack
open a textbook and inhale that new book smell but
definitely not when you have to absorb all the infor
mation inside of it before your final the next day.

2

You don't know
what your professor
looks like.

This is usually a pretty clear indicator
that either A) you never go to class, or B)
when you do go, you're never awake
long enough to learn anything useful.

3

You don't
know where
your section is.

Thinking of salvaging those participation
points? It's kind of hard to make a last-ditch
effort when you don't even know where to go.

4

You realize your
final was three
hours ago.

This is pretty self-explanatory.

5

You waste your
time making lists.

Lists are the first step to productivity if you actually work to check
things off. However, compiling inane lists like these is generally the
first step in the opposite direction.
