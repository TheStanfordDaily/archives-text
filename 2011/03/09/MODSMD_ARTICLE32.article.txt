## Previewing South by Southwest 
### â€” wyndam MAKOWSKY contact wyndam: makowsky@stanford. edu 
Dispel your common notions of a major music festi
val. Imagine not a campground-turned-hipster
commune but rather, a vibrant and urban down
town area, where bar after bar and club after club is issued a
full slate of bands for five days of organized chaos.
That's the scene at Austin's South by Southwest
(SXSW), an omnibus event that plays host not just to musi
cal acts, but film screenings and interactive technology
showcases, too. For a "week" (actually, 10 days), the city is
taken over, and this year, for the first time, The Daily is join
ing in on the action. While we'd love to be there for all of it,
finals period has other plans. But, we'll still get there for the
music, and that's perfectly fine by us.
How does SXSW work? It has headliners among
them this year are Duran Duran, Queens of the Stone
Age, Wu Tang Clan, Cee Lo Green, Lupe Fiasco, Wiz
Khalifa and The Strokes but unlike, say, Coachella,
the flow of the festival is not based around these per
formances. The sheer volume of acts prevents it. There
are thousands. Seriously. It's entirely possible in fact,
it's almost certain that we will skip the majority of
the "main" groups. And that's okay. There's plenty to
take in, and we have a shortlist, at the top of which is...
Killer Mike.
My photographer and I, dear friends since our
preteen years, have always had an affinity for southern
rap. The third and final member of the group shares
said interest. Hence, the following conversation:
"Guys, Killer Mike is playing."
"What?"
"Yup."
"Dope."
"We're going."
"Yup."
"Yup."
Then there's Danny Brown and Freddie Gibbs,
Roc Marciano and Pill. But we're not confined to rap.
We'll hit the indie circuit. We'll get to some country.

We'll take all comers. We've spent the past two weeks
listening to all the mixtapes and albums we can get our
hands on, just to prepare.
How are we going to cover this? We're going to
tweet. We're going to post pictures. We're going to
review as much of the music and the culture as we
can. This is not going to be a standard summation of
events. We're looking at this through an almost
anthropological lens. Take Hunter S. Thompson off
the campaign trail, reduce his talent by about 95 per
cent and place him in Austin voila, you have what
we're going for.
But if you hadn't gathered, there is a problem: we
could deploy our entire reporting staff and still not get
to every single performance. There's only so much that
we can see. We're going to have to discriminate. Our
inclination is toward the hip-hop scene, but our tastes
are widespread and surely, though we combed through
the acts, we may very well have missed a supremely tal
ented act or gasp! even "the next big thing." So:
get in touch, give us the scoop, let us know whom you
want us to cover. Follow us on Twitter @intermission
TSD. We'll try and make it happen if, of course, our
prior commitments to Killer Mike don't get in the way.
