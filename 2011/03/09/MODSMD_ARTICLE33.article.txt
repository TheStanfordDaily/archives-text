## James Franco IS MY BOSS

I I have no freaking idea."
A wide-eyed Lacey Dorn' 11
laughs in disbelief. It's opening night
of "Metamorphosis: Junior Year", the
play adaptation of Betsy Franco's
quirky young adult novel and what
Lacey has spent the last six months of
her life documenting on film. James,
her co-director and Betsy's eldest son,
flies in Monday to take a stab at
directing a shoot. You can imagine it's
difficult to collaborate in person
when Lacey's finisfiing up at Stanford
and James is working towards his
Ph.D. in English at Yale. What's prob
ably a bit harder to manage is when
your co-director is also balancing a
movie star career along with high
profile gigs like hosting the Oscars,
making appearances on "General

Hospital", romancing Japanese body
pillows on "30 Rock" and studying at
practically every college your mom
can name, like UCLA, Columbia,

NYU, Brooklyn College and occa
sionally Warren Wflson College.
But how do you even get your
self there in the first place? How do
you wrestle your way onto an already
over-committed star s radar?
Easy you go to Telluride
Film Festival.
James recently raked in the crit
ical acclaim, not to mention an
Oscar nomination for his starring
role in "127 Hours", the follow-up of
"Slumdog Millionaire" for director
Danny Boyle. The film premiered at
Telluride last September, which
Facey attended along with her friend
and Stanford Film Society head,

Sam Pressman 'lO, who worked the

festival. After the movie's Q&A,
Lacey struck up a conversation with
James and realized they had much
in common.
"I share a lot of the same aca
demic interests, especially with writ
ing, and his parents met at Stanford.
He grew up in Palo Alto," Lacey said.
"So we were talking about lots of
stuff, and he was like, 'You know
what? My mom and I are doing a
project in Palo Alto. Why don't you
help out?"'
Naturally, Lacey agreed. "It was
totally serendipitous, and I got a call
from his producer in the next month
who was like, 'Hey, want to help
out?"'
Lacey's role snowballed from
there, going from helper, to co-pro
ducer and to co-director.
"So this has been a total whirl
wind. They brought me on after
things had just started, but no one
really knew what was going on," Lacey
said. "We didn't know what angle we
wanted to take or how we wanted to
approach it, but we did know that
there's this amazing creative process.
There's a community that has a lot of
pressure on teens, where there's been
a lot of teen mental health problems
despite the surface perfection. It's Palo
Alto the Stanford Duck Syndrome
definitely—it expands into Palo Alto
and the high schoolers here for sure."
The next step was to interview
the teens involved and figure out
which stories to follow.
