# Five minutes with Betsy Franco

When Betsy Franco, Stanford
alum and mother of James,
first submitted her draft of

"Metamorphosis: Junior Year" to her
editor, she received less than enthu
siastic feedback.
"That publisher said, This is too
weird. This isn't really a novel. Can
you get rid of the myths? Can you
get rid of the poetry?'" Betsy said. "I
thought, 'l'm willing to work with
you, but that's kind of the whole crux
of the book.'"
Betsy was inspired to write
"Metamorphosis" after watching a
local high school production of Mary
Zimmerman's "Metamorphoses"
three times. Like Zimmerman's play,
"Metamorphosis" is an adaptation of
the classic Greek and Roman myths.
The story centers on brooding teen
artist, Ovid, who chronicles the lives of
his family and friends as modern
retellings of the classic myths. Her
teenage protagonist's realism stems
from her plentiful experience raising
three of her own.
"Oh my god. I don't think I slept
for many weekends when James and
Tom were growing up. Dave was a
little easier," Betsy chuckled. "They
were risk risk-takers. They got in trou
ble."

Nowadays, the three Franco brothers
are a bit of momma's boys, all chip
ping in to bring their mothers work
to the stage. Middle child Tom drew
the original illustrations for the book
and helped design the sets. Her eld
est and youngest James and Dave
collaborated on the audiobook of
"Metamorphosis". James is also pro
ducing a documentary about the
making of the play, which he hopes
will capture the teen-driven creative

process of the production.
"It's so much fun. I can't believe
they're willing to work with me,"
Betsy said. "James just put me in a
movie, 'The Broken Tower', about
the poet Hart Crane and then let me
be his mom on 'General Hospital',
and now he's doing a documentary
of the making of the play, because
we involved the teens so much."
Another perk of having celebrity
spawn? Third row center seats at the
Oscars.
"Oh my god. It was just pure
fun from start to finish. It was just so
delightful," she said. "The actors
were in front of us who were nomi
nated and who were presenting. It
was fun to see them naturally talking
to each other not that I don't
know actors are people, because my
son is but people put them on
pedestals."
What did she think of seeing
her son in drag?
"That was my favorite part. I
love that he didn't even stuff it - just
flat!"
The kids in the cast requested
she say hi to a couple specific stars,
so she went onstage afterwards to
greet James' co-host, Anne
Hathaway, and found "The Social
Network's" Jesse Eisenberg at the
Governor's Ball. With a movie star
son, Betsy has no qualms approach
ing the rich and famous.
"I mean, I have a calling card,"
Betsy laughed. "I just go up to peo
ple and say 'l'm James Franco's
mom.'"
