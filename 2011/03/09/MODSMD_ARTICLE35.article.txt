DeVotchKa is best
known for scoring
the independent
film, "Little Miss Sunshine."
With the release of their fifth

album, this Denver-based band proves that
it owes its reputation not to the Academy
Award-winning film, but rather to its stunning
ability to transmit emotions through its exu
berant, heartwarming brand of singular indie
world-folk music.
"100 Lovers" is an amazing whirlwind
tour of tango rhythms, mariachi horns, soaring
string instrumentation and front man Nick
Urata's distinct slurred vocals. An interesting
melange of genres, the album starts off on the
nostalgic notes of "The Alley". It is a beautiful
opening track that builds on several layers of
sound, beginning with sweeping orchestral
strings, a piano line and steadily building
marching drums. When Urata's voice explodes
unto the carefully crafted soundscape, it har
nesses the instrumentation swelling around it
and adds depth and character to the otherwise

too film-friendly harmony.
And what a voice this is. All throughout
the album, Urata's voice captures the ear in a
way that none of his contemporaries on the
indie scene can match: his slurred vocals are
unquestionably the central part of the album.
Mashing words together, dropping syllables
and adopting several different kinds of accents,
Urata is able to alter his vocals to match the
cultural context many of the songs on the
album boast. On "Bad Luck Heels", which fea
tures mariachi brass and danson influences,
certain vocals are in Italian, slurred so artfully
into the vocals in English that it's completely
impossible to distinguish where one language
ends and the other begins. The vowel sounds
are flattened, the consonants slurred, making it
difficult to discern the actual lyrics without

having to consult the printout in the album.
The same is true for "Ruthless", with words in
Spanish and French sprinkled throughout the
vocals and flamenco influences on the guitar
line and dance rhythms. As backup to Urata's
scene-stealing vocals, Jeanie Schroder's (also on
double bass and sousaphone) sweet, flat tone
provides a middle ground, which manages to
connect the strong instrumentation to the
equally strong vocals without one overbearing
the other.
"100 Other Lovers", the quasi-title track,
comes third on the album. The dreamy quality
in the music is courtesy of the theremin, an
early electronic instrument that sounds softer
than a synth, which suffuses the recording with
an antique, eerie quality when layered with
orchestral strings. Handclaps and a tambourine
in the background mitigate the somber mood
and inject youthful nonchalance into the cock
tail, while the vocals again show off that idio
syncratic mumble.
"The Man from San Sebastian" strikes up
a tango rhythm with the very specific use of a
bandoneon, a wind instrument much like the
accordion that is characteristic of popular
Argentinean music. The song is revved up and

fast-paced with liberal use of the pedal on the
guitar, which seems to parallel the achingly
emotional bandoneon line. There's a sensuality
to the rhythm that only Latin flavor can bring
to music. The climax of the song, an ascending
line on violins and bandoneon that drops sud
denly and is drowned out by the guitar, is the
most dramatic moment on the album. It's a
furious, sensual whirlwind of music and the
definite apex of the album, with a final note
that resonates for the whole length of the
album.
There are several instrumental tracks scat
tered throughout the album, some under the
telling titles of "Interlude" which showcase the
range of sounds the band has come to master
and which bring the band's most hated genre
label into mind: gypsy punk. One such track is
the closer, "Sunshine". With spacey, swirling
string instruments and digital vibes from the
theremin, the band closes the curtain on the
fifth act of their dramatic showcase, this time
with the spotlight firmly on them.
