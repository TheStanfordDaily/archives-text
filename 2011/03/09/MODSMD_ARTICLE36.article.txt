## Oatmeal good for cheap laughs

Confession: sometimes I
forget basic grammar
rules, including appropri
ate apostrophe use. I don't usually
turn to a style guide or Google for
quick instruction, but instead
turn to the Oatmeal blog, known
for its satirical comics, snarky
commentary and illustrated

instructions to get you through
the more mundane aspects of
daily life (not to mention the
abundance of cartoon dinosaurs)
So when I got my hands on
the Oatmeal's new book, "5 Very
Good Reasons to Punch a

Dolphin in the Mouth (and
Other Useful Guides)," I was
ecstatic to start flipping through
its colorful pages and bask in the
pretentiousness of mocking cus
tomer service representatives and
obnoxious Facebook friends

you know that one person who
bombards your News Feed with
Farmville updates all the time?

There's a comic for that. My inner
geek also loved "How to Use a
Semicolon" ... one that everyone
should take the time to read.

The book is mostly just a
published collection of cartoons
and comics from the web site.

Some of them are useful, includ-

ing "How to Use an Apostrophe,"
while others are randomly enter
taining yet unrealistic ("Why it
would suck to live next to a vol
cano"). The blog has been a
favorite procrastination device of
mine for the last year, and having
it in print form is a nice break
from surfing (okay, creeping) on
Facebook every study break.

Flipping through some of
the pages, you can't help but
laugh at how relatable the materi
al is (see "crappy hugs") ... but
then you cringe a little when you
remember that your bad hand
shake or misspellings could easily
be the butt of any of these jokes.

The comics become increas
ingly vulgar as you flip through
the pages. Ultimately, the comics
portray what we point to as first
world problems bad interviews
and giving computer help at
their finest, and toward the end,

the gross jokes become tiresome.
The premise behind "5 Very
Good Reasons" is interesting
an exhausted, angry web designer
quits his corporate job and pub
lishes his first year's worth of car
toons that spawned the Oatmeal,
but ultimately, the book is redun
dant in its targets and a bit
whiney.

However, the comics are
great for mindless skimming,
cheap laughs and some educa
tion ("Twenty Things Worth
Knowing About Beer" counts,

right?), but it's not something to
spend hours poring over.
If it weren't for the pullout
posters, I would stick to just read
ing this online. As for the dolphins,
I'm not sure I'm convinced.
