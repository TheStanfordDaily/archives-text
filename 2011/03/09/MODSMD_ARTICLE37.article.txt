This reader readily admits that,
when she first heard of this book,
she was deeply skeptical. A history
of the Holy City, as told by a former
Catholic priest, conjured images of evan
gelical, gay-bashing nutcases looking to
debunk evolutionary theory for the hun
dredth time. "Jerusalem, Jerusalem," how
ever, turned out to be a literate and com
passionate treatment of a wildly provoca
tive subject, a testament to James Carroll's
skill and perspective.

The book opens with a personal his
tory, the story of how Carroll came to be
fascinated by the city of Jerusalem

both the historical, physical city and the
mythos of Jerusalem that came to hold
such sway in the modern collective con
sciousness. In any other work of this

nature, this sort of introduction would
have seemed trite and self-aggrandizing;
one typically reads nonfiction to learn
about the subject matter, not the author.
In this case, however, it felt right hon
orable, even as though Carroll were
disclosing his background out of journal
istic integrity.

Jerusalem's story begins on chapter
two, where Carroll

begins, not with the Biblical version of the
tale, as one might expect, but rather with
a Jared Diamond-esque analysis of the
origins of the three major monotheistic
faiths. His analysis of the genesis of reli
gion is strictly secular and very scientific
he argues that it was primarily a
means of sublimating intrinsic human

violence and dealing with death. His
examination of the foundation of the city
of Jerusalem, and its predecessor, Jericho,
is similarly clinical, written with aplomb
and an appreciation for archaeological
evidence that any historian would admire.
He is not afraid to question, or even con
tradict, the text of the Bible where neces
sary; indeed, he spends a significant
amount of time analyzing the very

human origins of the Holy Book itself.
As his focus shifts to more (relative
ly) modern events, like the crucifixion
and the Islamic conquest of the Middle
East in the medieval era, he does not lose
his impartiality. His treatment of these
extremely relevant and extremely contro
versial topics is sensitive but anchored in
an unflinching appraisal of the follies of
human nature through the centuries
universal weaknesses that have persisted
irrespective of faith of any stripe. He does
not spare his own Catholic faith, which is
as central to the Jerusalem story as either
of it modern contenders; he criticizes the
violent conduct of organized Christianity
throughout history as a fundamental mis
interpretation of the teachings of Christ, a
throwback to the more violent Old

Testament, and explains but does not

excuse its treatment of Judaism as a
backward psychological response to its
historic persecution at the hands of classi
cal Rome.

"Jerusalem, Jerusalem" is a truly
scholarly treatment of a very relevant
topic and one of the least biased works
this reader has seen from an author of
such unique perspective. It is well worth
the while of anyone interested in the his
torical background of today's Middle
Eastern conflict.
