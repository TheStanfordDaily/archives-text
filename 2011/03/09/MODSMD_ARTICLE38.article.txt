## PC gaming: STILL HOT 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
If you've been plugged into
the traditional channels
of videogame dogma
over the past five or so years,
you've probably absorbed
more than a few aggrandized

claims about where this business is headed
depending on who you talk to, motion
controls, music games, MMOs, free-to-play
games and social networking have all been
poised to take over the industry at one time
or another.

Not all of the rhetoric sounds so hope
ful. Some parts of the industry are fading
away, and in general, those same game gurus
saw it ahead of time the traditional
Japanese RPGs and 3-D platformers that
flooded the market of yesteryear, for exam
ple, may indeed be dying breeds. But another
claim about a supposedly endangered facet
of gaming, an older and more common one,
has yet to ring true.
Contrary to the popular line of think
ing, PC gaming is not dead and I'm tired
of hearing otherwise.
Gaming is a rapidly changing beast, and
it's understandable that a lot of our predic
tions are way off base. I can't tell you how
many times I've been completely baffled by a
Nintendo announcement only to bite my
tongue (they're going to add a waggle-stick
to the Game Cube and sell 85 million units?
"Never," I said.) On the other hand, it's easy
to call Nintendo out on some things I got
right in 2004, CEO Satoru Iwata told the
Japan Economic Foundation that "customers
do not want online games."
That's all a longwinded way of saying
something simple: there's room for wild pre

dictions and differences of opinion, but
would-be truthsayers (myself included) need
to be open to stepping back, taking a fresh
look and perhaps making a bit of a para
digm shift.
This brings me back to my sticking
point. I'll be the first to admit that PC gam
ing has moved past its golden age of classics,
such as Doom and Monkey Island, and the
US retail market has declined far enough (to
about $5OO million in 2009) that you aren't
guaranteed to even see a PC shelf in the

games section at Best Buy. Some major devel
opers, often with good reason, are focusing
their efforts on dedicated gaming consoles,
and PC ports are often broken, late or nonex
istent even if the franchise originally had a
home on the PC (GTA, Assassin's Creed,
Fable, Halo and Gears of War are all offend
ers on one level or another.) Worst of all is
rampant piracy, which Epic Games President
Michael Capps once said is "killing" major
players in the PC games space.
That isn't the whole story, though. PC
gaming has been forced to make radical
changes in the wake of the Internet, piracy
and explosive console popularity, but they
aren't all bad. In fact, they helped boost the

global PC gaming market by 20% last year,
up to a whopping $16.2 billion in revenue.
That doesn't sound very "endangered"
to me. So how are PC games still thriving?
It's hard not to start with the Internet
the cause and solution of so many prob
lems. Digital distribution is picking up where
the retail market dropped off, accounting for
millions of purchases that aren't recorded by
traditional channels like the NPD. Most of
those come through Valve, whose Steam
platform accounts for over 70 percent of
game sales. The service provides day-and
date access without traveling to a store, back
ground patching, an achievement system

akin to the Xbox 360's, ridiculous sales, com
munity networking and enough other fea
tures that I could probably fill this column
just deifying Steam.
The rise of social networking and micro
transactions provides another fertile ground
for PC gaming the Facebook game,
FarmVille, has an estimated 300 million-plus
users, and franchises going free-to-play like
Lord of the Rings Online are often proving
more lucrative than traditional games.
Global connectivity also means that
independent and small-budget games like

last year's Super Meat Boy and Amnesia: The
Dark Descent can get the recognition and
sales they deserve. Indie development has
never been more exciting than now, and its
home is clearly on the PC. Ever heard of
Minecraft? Markus Persson could only have
designed, created or distributed such a phe
nomenon on the PC, which is free of the

market policing of Xbox Live and
Play Station Network.
And that's really the heart of PC gam
ing: freedom. Away from Nintendo's "Seal of
Quality" and Microsoft's strictly regulated
online services, PC developers can create and
update games exactly as they see fit. Gamers
themselves reap similar benefits on a PC,
they can customize controls, tweak graphical
settings and even create and share modifica
tions that alter gameplay.
PC gaming is different than it used to
be, but claims about its imminent demise are
shortsighted and close-minded. As DICE
general manager and Batdefield designer,
Karl Troedsson, said last week, they're "bull
shit."

Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins, released in 2009, was one of the last AAA mulitplatform titles to take full advantage of the PC's
strengths, from superior visuals and controls to custom modifications that alter gameplay. Features like these are becoming more rare.
