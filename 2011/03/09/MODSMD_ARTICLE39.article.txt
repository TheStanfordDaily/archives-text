## MARDI GRAS: What's Going on Once the Beads Have Settled 
### — evie DANFORTH contact evie: erdanfor@stanford. edu 
I wrote this during a glamorous
Sunday night study session in the
Paloma Lounge but am actually
supposed to be on Bourbon Street in
New Orleans for Mardi Gras right
now. Three final papers and a
midterm (during dead week how
is that a mid- term?) intervened, and
the trip got postponed a year, but in
the spirit of the occasion, I thought I
would write about the food-centric

traditions that gave rise to our con
temporary celebration of Mardi Gras;
it beat reading increasingly incoherent
text messages from people actually in
New Orleans for the week.
"Mardi Gras" is French for
"Fat Tuesday" and actually comes from
the medieval Christian calendar —not
the producer of some low-budget
"Girls Gone Wild" spinoff s twisted
imagination. It started out as a celebra
tion of the last day before Lent, 40 days
of fasting and atonement in prepara-

tion for Easter Sunday. (For a more
contemporary analogy, think of how
crazy the last weekend before Dead

Week can get here on campus.) During
Lent, Christians are expected to give up
basically any fun stuff back in the
Middle Ages, that included all alcohol,
meat and dairy. The 40 days start on
Ash Wednesday, a day on the church
calendar entirely devoted to contem
plating your inevitable death. (There's a
reason why the Ash Wednesday music

genre isn't quite as popular as
Christmas carols are.)
So to get their last licks in, people
would throw bacchanal celebrations
the day before (Tuesday), sort of like
carbo-loading for Christ. Today, that
Tuesday has morphed into the more
recognizable Mardi Gras festivities in
New Orleans and Rio de Janiero's

infamous Carnival.
But while the celebrations are
famous, the subsequent period of
atonement isn't as widely recognized in
modern secular society. In an age of

instant gratification, excess and con
stant availability of— well, anything
you want, deprivation can feel like a
bizarre concept. It's so easy to buy a
gallon-sized tub of Red Vines at the

two 24-hour Safeways within a few
miles of campus; you can forget that
candy is actually a luxury item. I come
from a family that observes Lent, but
also worships food. (When my little
brother was twelve, he put white truf
fles on his Christmas list.) Piecing
those two things together can be hard;
Anthony Bourdain isn't exactly run
ning around telling everyone to forsake
their gastronomic excesses, and the

popular
ity of the

You Tube video series "Epic Mealtime"
speaks to our fascination with over
abundance. But as the nation becomes
increasingly conscious of where exactly
our food comes from, the post-Mardi
Gras period is a great excuse to pare
down, cut back on wasteful consump
tion patterns and really think about
how luxurious some of the foods we
take for granted are. So what are you
giving up for Lent?
