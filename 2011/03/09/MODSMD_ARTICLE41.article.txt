## Spoken Word wows in winter showcase 
### — eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
E' h that that it were possible to
re the experience of the Spoken
ird Collective through this arti
cle, but it's not. That's the whole point
of Spoken Word, really—it's spoken.
The words alone are lyrical and fluid,
harsh and beautiful, but the power of
the show is in the pacing, personality
and presence. I could quote those
beautiful people for 600 words
straight, and still, I couldn't explain
why the show was so powerful. What I
can do is share how it felt.
The first prevailing impression of
the place was of warmth. There was

an air of comfort and
familiarity upon enter
ing the room; the collec-

tive was a family, but the most inclu
sive family I've ever had the privilege
of meeting. There were a few mem
bers of the group who forgot their
next line partway through a poem, but
it didn't result in that awkward frigidi
ty that usually fills the room when an
actor forgets a line in a play—the
audience snapped and murmured
encouragingly, beaming their love at
the performer. The result was that the
mistake didn't feel like any sort of
problem. If anything, those dropped
lines highlighted the entire feel of the
show, bringing the collective's love for
each other to the front of the stage.
Raina Sun 'l3, our self-professed
"awkward MC of the night," was
unbearably charming. She invited us
onto the blankets and pillows that
they'd spread out for us at the front of
the stage, laughing with us as she called
the open mic volunteers onto the stage.
She taunted our timidity and dared us
to shout and cheer and moan our
approval of each speaker — "we are sex
positive, you guys!" and fiercely
threatened anyone who would dare
leave his or her phone on during the
show. She was tiny and Asian and
absolutely ferocious, and I think we all
fell a little bit in love with her.

What sets Spoken Word apart
from the written word is the charisma of
the people behind the words. Every
speaker was willing to throw their entire
selves into their words, cracking open
their ribcages and showing an entire
audience of people exactly what was
going on inside. The concept is absolute
ly terrifying, and the speakers made it
seem effortless. Every one of them is tal
ented beyond belief, but there were a few
strong personalities who stuck with me
for hours after I walked out of that
dimly lit room.
A high point was found in

Mercedes Zapata'll, whose poems were
painfully hilarious and yet still poignant
She told the stories of her youth, sharing
her most intimate secrets and humiliat

ing stories, weaving them all together to
take a hard look at self-esteem and body
image. I made the mistake of drinking a
soda while listening to her speak and lit
erally sprayed it out my nose as she
berated the classic love poets for their
idealism ("She's not gonna believe you,
love poet!").
Other memorable moments: Yaa
Gyasi 'll and Raina's brilliant collabora
tive work was wildly relatable and a
beautiful intermingling of the silly with
the somber. Watching Alok Vaid-Menon
'l3's sinuous movements offset his fren
zied pacing was like an aural drug, filling
our perception with proud brokenness
and defiance. When Tyla Johnston' 11
urged us to "Close your eyes, juslfeel for
once. I'll take care of it," and against our
deeply ingrained Stanford instincts, we
actually did. Seeing Brian Yoo' 11 channel
Charlie Sheen in his dismissal of

Stanford's watered-down lifestyle, which
filled the audience with adrenaline and
fire. Feeling the yearning in Shawn Dye
'l4 and Simon Neely'l 1, feeling the quiet

assurance of Yaa... it was unforgettable.
The Spoken Word Collective, in
short, is a beautiful outlet for anyone
who has ever felt passion or rage or

isolation or longing or for anyone who
has ever really felt at all. I would
strongly encourage everyone to try and
catch its next show, as it is not an expe
rience that anyone should have to hear
about secondhand.
