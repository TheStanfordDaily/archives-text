# ROXY SASS
## advice Roxy Sass Determines the Relationship ... at the Zoo 
### 
Ah, the DTR talk. Essential and
often unavoidable (believe
me, Roxy has tried). But
Facebook-esque categories of rela
tionships are far too restrictive:
there's so much more than "it's com
plicated" and "open relationship" in
that beautiful in-between from single
to do-not-mingle.
Unsure of how to classify your
quasi-relationship when your
hookup sits you down to DTR? Try
one of Roxy's animal metaphor
terms (patent pending) to perfectly
encapsulate the expectations and
tendencies of your protracted liaison.
The Barnacle
Roxy's had a few barnacles stuck to
her hull over the years. The barnacle is
dependable always texts back, picks
Roxy up from the airport, walks her
home when she's been creeped on
enough for one night. But when she's
trying to lure that hottie back to her
dorm, the barnacle's unfortunately
there as well ("hey! where'd you go?").
Yet Roxy finds they have a certain
charm. Or maybe she's remembering
that barnacles have the largest penis
size-to-body-size ratio of any animal?
There's food for thought.

The Vampire
Relax Roxy's not referring to
Pattinson the Pale (for the record,
she prefers his werewolf rival because
of his striking resemblance to a very
muscular hedgehog) but rather to
the couple whose relationship cannot
stand the light of day. Do you shoot
awkward glances at each other in
class yet slam against the wall in vig
orous make-outs when the party's
rolling? Leave before sunrise and

only meet up again after a 1:30 a.m.
booty text? Vampire. Roxy finds the
double-life (and sharp teeth) some
what intriguing. Anyone want to take
that hickey to the next level?

The Tiger
It roars at Roxy one day then paws
her gently the next. She knows it's
pretty antifeminist, but Roxy kind of
digs the barely veiled rage and the
way it growls possessively over her.
Roxy's not concerned about taming
the tiger (she knows they never
change their stripes) just happy to
have a chance to crack a whip every
once in a while.

The Three-Legged Dog
Roxy thought it was cute at first (aw,
look at the widdle puppy!), but once
it started licking her face, she was

pretty much over it. Unfortunately, a
three-legged dog makes up for its
missing leg with extra devotion. It's a
handy companion to have when

braving the scary path between 680
and EBF, but be careful even cold
hearted Roxy has a hard time not
tearing up when she hurts the dog's
feelings and it hits her back with sad
puppy eyes. Tread carefully.
The Unicorn
The relationship that's too good to
be true. The unicorn usually expires
in about a month, after which Roxy
realizes she's been rolling around in
the hay with a white horse wearing a
shiny carrot on its forehead.
