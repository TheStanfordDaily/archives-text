## Social dues can no longer pay for alcohol 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Social dues collected by Row
houses can't be spent on alcohol
anymore, according to a Residen
tial Education (ResEd) policy that
goes into effect spring quarter. The
change comes as ResEd increases
its oversight of Row finances and
revises some unpopular policies
put in place fall quarter.
The policies are part of a larger
push by ResEd that is attempting

"We're allowed to collect vol
untary dues from our residents
that we can go buy alcohol with,
we just can't do it through the Uni
versity," said one FM, who asked
to remain anonymous.
"I can see why the University
would want to do it, but I think it's
absolutely a terrible decision
when it comes to the social life of
the Row," he added.
Other financial managers said
they understood the rationale
behind the new policy, but were
nonetheless unenthusiastic
