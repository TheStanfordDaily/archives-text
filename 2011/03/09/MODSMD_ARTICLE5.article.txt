## Social dues can no longer pay for alcohol 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Social dues collected by Row
houses can't be spent on alcohol
anymore, according to a Residen
tial Education (ResEd) policy that
goes into effect spring quarter. The
change comes as ResEd increases
its oversight of Row finances and
revises some unpopular policies
put in place fall quarter.
The policies are part of a larger
push by ResEd that is attempting
"to bring the Row program closer
in line with the rest of the Universi
ty" and increase equity between
houses, ResEd Assistant Director
Zac Sargeant wrote in a Feb. 15 e
mail sent to the Row managers list.
"The only thing that we have
been unable to accomplish yet,
along this social dues policy transi
tion, was to create a standardiza
tion of social funds for non-alco
holic purposes to be collected on
the University bill instead of in
house," he said.

A new social policy
Row residents are required to
pay social dues, part of which is
traditionally used to buy alcohol.

However, this practice could be in
conflict with a Stanford policy that
bans the use of funds held by the
University for the purchase of al
cohol.

According to some financial
managers (FMs), the most evident
loophole to this change would be
to collect unofficial social dues.
However, this practice might not
work if too few residents con
tributed.
"We're allowed to collect vol
untary dues from our residents
that we can go buy alcohol with,
we just can't do it through the Uni
versity," said one FM, who asked
to remain anonymous.
"I can see why the University
would want to do it, but I think it's
absolutely a terrible decision
when it comes to the social life of
the Row," he added.
Other financial managers said
they understood the rationale
behind the new policy, but were
nonetheless unenthusiastic
about it.

"If you've got sophomores liv
ing in the house and you charge
them social dues that you're going
to go buy alcohol with, it's basically
encouraging underage drinking,"
said the anonymous FM. "And it
also comes to the fact that all the
money we control under the Uni
versity, so they're essentially buying
alcohol for underage students
through us."
Haus Mitteleuropa (Haus Mitt)
FM Alison Dame-Boyle 'll said
she is concerned that residents
would spend more time drinking in
their rooms with friends than at
house functions, making it tougher
for staff to watch for alcohol prob
lems with residents and party atten
dees.

"I think it will probably be hard
er for houses that do not have a
pretty close-knit group already be
cause the temptation in college, ob
viously people on the Row are
going to drink anyway," Dame-
Boyle said.
In another change, the board
budget will be made available to
FMs in installments, rather than as
a lump allocation. ResEd is also hir
ing a new staff member for the Row
Office; this staffer's job will be re
sponsible for scanning weekly re
ceipts turned in by FMs.
Though some FMs said the
change wouldn't significantly im
pact day-to-day operations, they
foresee potential hassles.
"I'm not really sure what that's
going to mean," Dame-Boyle said
of the change.
It remains ambiguous as to how
official these social dues changes
are. That aside, Dame-Boyle said
ResEd was "very clear" that houses
would retain all of their money and
be entitled to use it at their discre
tion.

"It will probably just mean more
work for financial managers and
more communication between fi
nancial managers, kitchen man
agers and chefs," she said.

Dues refunds
It is still unlikely that Row resi
dents will see significant refunds of
their social dues.
Row management documents
from two years ago suggest Student
Organized Services (SOS), which
manages Row house accounts,
strongly encouraged refunds in the
past. However, Sargeant's e-mail
said students' $lOO damage de
posits are the only refunds that will
be issued this year. As previously
reported by The Daily ("Row dues
lead to confusion", February 4,
2011), financial managers were told
that excess social money would no
longer be refunded to residents and
instead, would be rolled into the
house's restricted-use "capital re
serve funds" (CRF).
For the present, social budget
surpluses can be rolled forward
from quarter to quarter and unused
money placed into a fund to pay for
house reunion parties. It is unclear
what happens to the funds at the
end of that year, although FMs reaf

firmed that the money could be
moved to CRE
SOS director Nick Peters de
clined to comment on the issue.
"I feel that excess money, rather
than trying away to spend it, should
just be given back to residents," said
Roth FM Lyn Mehe'ula 'll.
According to a document on the
Row's Student Management web
site, CRF contributions were
capped at $90,000 per year, a figure
set to decrease annually by $lO,OOO
through the 2014-15 academic year.
If a house exceeds the cap, the sur
plus money would be washed into a
general University account.
This year. Kappa Alpha Theta
and Pi Beta Phi exceeded the cap.
The latter surpassed the cap by
$12,000.
Some FMs say that the ResEd
change is well intentioned, but they
noted that it is not the ideal solution
to ResEd complications they de
sired.
"We want a little bit of cushion
so if we spend a little bit more than
we think, we'll still be fine, and I
think that that money, if we don't
spend it, should be given back to
residents," Dame-Boyle said. "If
the financial manager makes an
error and charges too much, it can
go back to the people that paid it
and not into the CRF fund that has
$30,000 or however much sitting
around in it that we can't really do
much with."
