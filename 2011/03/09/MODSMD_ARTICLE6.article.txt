## Breakthrough study links gene regions to heart disease 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
School of Medicine researchers have
linked 13 new gene regions to the risk of heart
disease in an unprecedented collaborative
study that examined the genomes of more
than 80,000 individuals. The results were pub
lished in this week's issue of Nature Genetics.

The study analyzed the genomes of 22,000
people with a history of heart disease and
60,000 healthy individuals. This investigation,

which drew data from 14 previous studies, is
almost 10 times larger than the next-largest
whole-genome study to date,
Stanford researchers identified 23 gene re
gions that predispose individuals to heart dis
ease. They subsequently examined these re
gions in 25,000 afflicted and 25,000 healthy pa
tients.

"These chips generate 500,000 data points,
but we only took 23 to the next level," said
Themistocles Assimes, assistant professor of
cardiovascular medicine.

Of these 23 gene regions, only 13 passed
statistical tests for validation.

The study replicated and confirmed evi
dence from previous investigations in a
meta-analysis, doubling the number of iden
tified gene regions related to heart disease.
The results are essential in understanding
heart disease because, unlike other major ill
nesses, it is a product of multiple gene inter
actions.
