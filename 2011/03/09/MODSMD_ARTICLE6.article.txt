## Breakthrough study links gene regions to heart disease 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
School of Medicine researchers have
linked 13 new gene regions to the risk of heart
disease in an unprecedented collaborative
study that examined the genomes of more
than 80,000 individuals. The results were pub
lished in this week's issue of Nature Genetics.

The study analyzed the genomes of 22,000
people with a history of heart disease and
60,000 healthy individuals. This investigation,

which drew data from 14 previous studies, is
almost 10 times larger than the next-largest
whole-genome study to date,
Stanford researchers identified 23 gene re
gions that predispose individuals to heart dis
ease. They subsequently examined these re
gions in 25,000 afflicted and 25,000 healthy pa
tients.

"These chips generate 500,000 data points,
but we only took 23 to the next level," said
Themistocles Assimes, assistant professor of
cardiovascular medicine.

Of these 23 gene regions, only 13 passed
statistical tests for validation.

The study replicated and confirmed evi
dence from previous investigations in a
meta-analysis, doubling the number of iden
tified gene regions related to heart disease.
The results are essential in understanding
heart disease because, unlike other major ill
nesses, it is a product of multiple gene inter
actions.
"It's not one gene region or one
gene; it's a bunch that all have sub
tle effects," Assimes said. "You in
herit a profile of those mutations
and depending on the number of
mutations you have, that dictates
the lifetime risk of having heart dis
ease."

Interestingly, only three of these
13 regions are related to traditional
risk factors for heart disease for
example, diabetes, high cholesterol,
high blood pressure or smoking.
Heart disease is caused by the
buildup of cholesterol crystals in
blood vessels, a process known as
coronary atherosclerosis. The re
maining 10 genes may influence the
degree to which individuals' vessels
are susceptible to this buildup.
"Essentially all of these tradi
tional risk factors are irritating the
blood vessel wall and are promot
ing plaque formation in the wall,"
Assimes said. "And then there are
players inside the wall. The signals
that are not coming from the tradi
tional risk factors are probably
something in the vessel wall [but]
we don't know exactly what."
The study is also groundbreak
ing because of its scope: it examined

a large number of patients in order
to "overcome statistical noise," As
simes said.
According to principal investi
gator Thomas Quertermous, who is
a professor of cardiovascular medi
cine, a collaborative effort of this
magnitude is "unprecedented."
"Five or 10 years ago we would
never thought we would have been
able to come together," he said.
"I've never met most of the people
that I'm working with, but we've
come together through e-mail and
through telephone because we've
needed to."

While unprecedented, the study
had its limitations. Researchers
only examined individuals of Euro
pean descent, mostly due to the
availability of data.
"The individuals in the study
have been collected over the course
of years, through recruitment of in
dividuals who've had a heart at
tack," Quertermous said. "It just
turns out that those kinds of studies
were done in countries where the
vast majority of the population is
Caucasian Italy, Sweden, United
States, Germany."
According to Quertermous,
there are ongoing studies that look
at individuals of African, South
Asian and Hispanic descent.
At present, the Stanford study
has two preponderant implications:
it paves the way for future research

on new therapies that could reduce
the risk of heart disease and simul
taneously helps identify individuals
who may be at higher risk of heart
disease.

"We've identified single base
pair differences and said that these
signal differences, out of three bil
lion, change your risk of having
heart disease," Quertermous said.
But there's still more to be done.
Quertermous hopes to continue to
investigate the relationship be
tween single base pair differences
and changes in the function of a
particular gene or set of genes.
"If 1 change that gene, either in
terms of structure or level of activi
ty, how does that change the biolo
gy and the risk of heart disease? " he
asked.
"We shouldn't stop until we fig
ure out what's going on," Assimes
said. "And when we do figure it out,
obviously there's the potential to
develop a therapeutic [solution] to
block that pathway that's in
volved."
Still, doctors must be cautious
when genetically-profiling individ
uals and assessing their risk.
"The reality is that we still need
to find a few more gene regions be
fore we'll get to a point where pro
filing will be useful," Assimes said.
