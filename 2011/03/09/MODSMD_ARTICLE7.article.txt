## Judicial Affairs surveys students on University Honor Code 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday, after several delays,
the Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
closed a survey to gauge student at
titudes towards the Honor Code as
part of a review initiated by Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman.The review is the first to
be conducted in 13 years.

survey, but I do not think we faced
any difficulties that others seeking
information this way have not
faced."

understanding of the Honor Code,
the survey listed various scenarios
such as "working on an assignment
with others when the instructor
asked for individual work" and
"witnessing a case of cheating and

not reporting it." The survey asked
students to label these scenarios as
"not cheating," "trivial cheating,"
"moderate cheating" or "serious
cheating."
In terms of the Judicial Affairs
process, the survey also asked stu
dents to evaluate what they consid
