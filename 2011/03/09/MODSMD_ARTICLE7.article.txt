## Judicial Affairs surveys students on University Honor Code 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday, after several delays,
the Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA)
closed a survey to gauge student at
titudes towards the Honor Code as
part of a review initiated by Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman.The review is the first to
be conducted in 13 years.
The comprehensive survey,
which has been open to students
for more than a month, asks stu
dents to evaluate their own under
standing of the Honor Code and
the Judicial Affairs process as well
as the effectiveness of the Honor
Code system at Stanford.
OJA sent the online survey to
approximately 2,400 undergrads
and 4,000 graduate students, waited

for a 40-percent response rate be
fore closing, wrote Jamie Pontius-
Hogan, assistant dean of student
life, in an e-mail to The Daily. Final
counts report a 24- and 26-percent
response rate from undergrads and
graduate students, respectively.
"A 100-percent response rate
would be satisfying but also unreal
istic," Pontius-I logan said. "It is dif
ficult to get students to respond to a
survey, but I do not think we faced
any difficulties that others seeking
information this way have not
faced."
In order to assess the students'
understanding of the Honor Code,
the survey listed various scenarios
such as "working on an assignment
with others when the instructor
asked for individual work" and
"witnessing a case of cheating and

not reporting it." The survey asked
students to label these scenarios as
"not cheating," "trivial cheating,"
"moderate cheating" or "serious
cheating."
In terms of the Judicial Affairs
process, the survey also asked stu
dents to evaluate what they consid
ered to be sufficient evidence for
determining whether or not a stu
dent violated the Honor Code, of
fering the options of "preponder

ance of the evidence," "clear and
convincing evidence" and "beyond a
reasonable doubt." Currently, the
Judicial Affairs charter requires
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
The survey targeted the Judicial
Affairs process as well, asking stu
dents to assess what sanctions they
would find appropriate for a first
time violation of the Honor Code,
with options including an oral repri
mand, a failed grade and suspension.
In recent years, the number of
Honor Code hearings has remained
fairly consistent, with 102 cases last
year, compared to 82 in 2008-09 and
124 in 2007-08. However, Richard
Yuen, assistant dean of the Judicial
Affairs Office, observed that the
growing usage of technology in the

classroom has given rise to more
web-based cheating cases.
"With the development of the In
ternet, many more cases of plagia
rism utilizing uncited sources from
the Web are discovered," Yuen
wrote in an e-mail to The Daily."Stu
dents need to understand that using
the ideas or writings from other au
thors must be properly cited
whether it appears in printed mate
rial or the Internet."
This trend was reflected in the
survey, which asked students to eval
uate the severity of "paraphrasing or
copying a few sentences of material
from an electronic source e.g., the
Internet without footnoting it in
a paper".

The survey also contained ques
tions that focus on cheating related
to programming, specifically copy
ing code from a peer. These ques
tions stem from a startling statistic:
almost 30 percent of Honor Code vi
olations last year took place in the

computer science department.
According to the Office of Judi
cial Affairs' yearly report, there
were 29 cases in the CS Department,
followed by 11 cases in the Econom
ics Department. After that, the num
bers drop sharply, with most depart
ments having only one or two cases.
"We will use the information
gathered to inform discussions of
the Internal Review Panel," Pontius-
Hogan said of the survey's findings.
He declined to provide further
commentary on the results.
The Honor Code subcommittee
of the Review Panel, which also par
ticipated in the student input forum
earlier this month, is still in the
process of gathering more feedback
from the Stanford community.
