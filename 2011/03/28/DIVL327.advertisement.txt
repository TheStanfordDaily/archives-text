ENGLISH DEPARTMENT

The New English Core
The Stanford English Department announces a new curriculum for the English major. It features a team-taught, three-quarter
core sequence that will provide a broad perspective on the history of literature in English (English literature, American literature
and Anglophone literature) from the Middle Ages to the present. The historical core sequence is not a survey but rather a
narrative investigation of key literary themes, movements and innovations across a broad sweep. Designed to give the English
major more structure and (through an increased number of electives) more freedom, the new curriculum also features three
broad methodological requirements in Poetry, Narrative and Methodology. The major will culminate for seniors with o Senior
Seminar, a capstone course focused on close interaction with the faculty on cutting edge research topics. The new curriculum
marks an exciting moment for the English Department, faculty and students alike. As the curriculum comes into effect, Stanford
English majors will engage in new, absorbing and meaningful ways with both the extraordinary local detail and the stunning big
picture of literature in English. Be a part of it!
Historical core sequence
English 100A Literary History I
Offered each Autumn
This quarter traces the development of English literature in its first centuries, focusing on several intersecting themes: changing
technologies of writing and their transformation of texts, writers, and readers: the adaptation of ancient genres into the vernacular: the
collision of cultures as travel, exploration, and trade expand the boundaries of the known world and the human imagination; the turn
within as religious change reshapes the private self and the languages with which it expresses itself; and the emergence of new voices
as literature becomes available to new social classes, to women, and to distinctively modern world-views.
English 100B Literary History II
Offered each Winter
This quarter charts the creation of a trans-Atlantic republic of letters-and eventually the forging of a distinctive American literature.
Puritanism emerges as a major force of social change and literary value, yet it cedes its vitality to an ethic of sociability and finally
(with Romanticism) to a philosophy of nature. This course will trace changes in the way writers and readers conceived of the process of
producing, consuming, and judging literature.
English 100C Literary History III
Spring TTh 11-12:30 (Offered each Spring)
The quarter focuses on how literary texts engage with forces of modernization, industrialization, and colonialism in the nineteenth, and
with urbanization, world wars, the resistance to Western political domination and the emergence of global networks in the twentieth
and twenty-first centuries. Narrative and poetry creatively encounter other expressive media such as film, television, pop music, and
digital culture. In the process, they redefine the roles of authors, narrators, lyrical voices, characters, and ultimately readers themselves.
Methodology courses
English 160 Poetry and Poetics
Spring: MWF11-11:50

English 161 Narrative and Narrative Theory
Spring: MW 11-12:30
An introduction to stories and storytelling—that is, to narrative. What is narrative? When is narrative fictional and when non-fictional?
How is it done, word by word, sentence by sentence? Must it be in prose? Can it be in pictures? How has storytelling changed over
time? Focus on various forms, genres, structures, and characteristics of narrative.
English 162 Critical Methods

English 172E Literature of the Americas
Spring: MWF 11-11:50
The intellectual and aesthetic problems of inter-American literature conceived as an entirety. Emphasis is on continuities and crises
relevant to N„ Central, and S. American literatures. Issues such as the encounters between world views, the emergence of Creole and
racially mixed populations, slavery, the New World voice, myths of America as paradise or utopia, the coming of modernism, 20th
century avant gardes, and distinctive modern episodes such as the Harlem Renaissance, the Beats, magical realism, and Noigandre in
