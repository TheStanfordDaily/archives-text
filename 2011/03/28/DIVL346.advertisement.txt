DR. EMMA LUCINDA OLGA BAKES
March 3rd 1968 - February 28th 2011
Dr. Emma Lucinda Olga Bakes, was born on March 3rd, 1968, in Blyth, England, and
was adopted by her maternal grandmother and her husband, Olga and Kenneth Bakes.
Emma took great pride in her Northumberland ancestry for their refusal to conform or
behave according to the Great Roman Empire and looked to Hadrian's Wall as her
inheritance. Emma had a voracious appetite for learning and was an excellent student.
She earned her B.Sc. from University of Newcastle Upon Thyne with Honours on the
30th of June, 1989 and went on to earn her Ph.D. in theoretical physics from University
of London, Queen Mary and Westfield College, on July 27th, 1993. In addition to her
academic studies, Emma, also earned certificates of distinction from the Royal Schools
of Music and a black belt in the Jeet Kune Do form of martial arts. She had a passion
for art, music, and writing and showed considerable talent and creativity in each.
Emma had two professional dreams, the first was to become a doctor of medicine and
the second, inspired by her hero Carl Sagan, was to become an astrophysicist. As
fate would have it, she initially chose astrophysics and this led her to the USA; the
country she would adopt has home. Emma held research and teaching positions at
Princeton University and Vassar College, respectively. In the fall of 1996 she relocated
to California and the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field where she worked
until 2005. During this time Emma, held research positions with the National Research
Council and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI). Her work
focused on the origins of life and resulted in several research grants, dozens of peer
reviewed journal articles, and a book entitled "The Astrochemical Evolution of the
Interstellar Medium." She directed a NASA space mission concept to sample Kuiper
Belt objects for organics and served on numerous panels that charted the Nation's
space exploration goals.
Emma's career at the NASA Ames Research Center was just beginning when she met
her one true love and lifelong partner, Dr. Donald R. Mendoza on the 1 st of March, 1997.
The two were together ever since and in addition to supporting each other's careers,
collaborated on several endeavours including scientific research and the authoring of
several manuscripts. Their greatest collaborations included the nurturing and raising of
Travis R. Mendoza, Emma's transition into medicine, her becoming an American citizen,
and the birth of their son Titan D. Mendoza.
Emma had already distinguished herself as an astrophysicist when she began to
venture out into the biological sciences to help establish the new frontier known as
astrobiology. This would be another pivotal point in her life as it rekindled her earliest
dream of becoming a medical doctor. Thus, with great courage and the support of her
one love entered the Stanford University School of Medicine in the fall of 2005. Despite
her massive work load, Emma continued to inspire others by speaking at various public
events and by authoring papers and essays that brought her own passion for science to
all who read her work. All are invited and encouraged to read her beautifully written and
recent essay celebrating the confluence of science and humanity:
http://kepler.nasa.gov/education/sagan/EmmaßakesEssay/
Emma immediately made an impression on her Stanford classmates, professors,
and advisors. She, once again in the tradition of her Northumbrian ancestors, did not
conform to the traditional establishment; she was older, educated outside traditional
medical disciplines, very accomplished, and had her own family. While this raised a few
extra obstacles for her, it endeared her to a few people, spanning the entire health care
hierarchy, with which she established great friendships; again, this was out of the norm
for the typical medical school student.
Emma achieved her final dream, one which doctors said was impossible, of having
a child when she gave birth to Titan Dinsdale Mendoza in May of 2007. Despite the
difficulties that fulltime medical school placed on her, she excelled at motherhood and
modified all her other aspirations to put her family first. Caring for and nurturing her son
became Emma's reason and she did everything possible to let him know her love was
unconditional and without limit.
Emma was a beautiful, intelligent, creative, talented, gifted, caring, thoughtful, loyal, and
loving woman. Her legacy just as her sprit is eternal and her contributions will continue
to provide the world endless gifts. Emma proved that the building blocks of life can exist
throughout the heavens: God's signature is universal and Emma was the first to read it.
A memorial service is being planned and an educational trust fund in the
name of Emma's son Titan is being established. Inquires may be sent to
