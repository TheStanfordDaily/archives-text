## EDITORIAL Another Misguided ResEd Policy 
### 
Two months ago, we criticized
Residential Education
(ResEd) for eliminating so
cial dues refunds, because the poli
cy was an inefficient and unneces
sary attempt to enhance social life
on the Row. RcsEd's newest sur
prise for Row FMs banning the
use of social dues to buy alcohol
is another poorly conceived policy
that is actually counterproductive
to the stated goal of banning re
funds. Effectively, ResEd has crip
pled social dues as a vehicle to
fund the kind of social activity that
has and will always characterize
the Row, forcing houses to acquire
the funds through unaccountable
and undesirable means that will be
fraught with unintended conse
quences.
It is unclear what the University
is trying to do by banning alcohol
purchase with social dues (alcohol
accounts for over half of Row social
expenditures). Forecasting that un
derage drinking will cease or even
decrease significantly would be an
astonishingly naive mistake on the
part of ResEd houses will obvi
ously collect some sort of unofficial
social dues to fund parties that are a
staple of student life. Rather, it ap
pears that either ResEd or some
higher force in the Administration
wants to ensure that Stanford in no
way officially facilitates underage
drinking, which is basically what
University-sanctioned social dues
accomplish.
But what price are school offi
cials willing to pay for a de jure pol
icy modification that has the same
de facto implications, or worse? If
FMs collect unofficial social dues
and handle the finances through
personal accounts, Row residents'
money will suddenly be placed in a
very unaccountable situation with
great incentive for dishonesty in
bookkeeping and refunds. Even
granting full integrity to Row FMs,
there will be no formal infrastruc
ture to guard against accounting
errors that will place thousands of
student dollars at risk.
Moreover, an unofficial, volun
tary social due system threatens to
undermine the social atmosphere
and house bonding that Res Ed's
refund ban was supposed to en

hance. Presumably, only students
who agree to pay into the unoffi
cial social due system will be al
lowed to drink the house's alco
hol; this is conducive to a culture
of distrust, as students feel pres
sured to act as vigilantes against
free-riding.
Finally, if the policy actually
succeeds in reducing house alco
hol expenditure, students are
probably going to redirect funds
earmarked for social dues toward
private alcohol consumption. The
ensuing fragmented and isolated
drinking behavior is both a safety
risk and another impediment to
the shared housing experience
that makes the Row a fun place to
live.
It may be the case that Stanford
places itself at severe legal risk if it
knowingly assists underage drink
ing. If so, then ResEd really had no
choice but to pursue the current
policy. However, given the Univer
sity's historically laissez-faire
stance and the certain anecdotal
knowledge that social dues were
being used for alcohol, it seems
surprising that the legal issue was
suddenly discovered this year. If
Stanford can retain the legal im
munity on the issue it seems to
have enjoyed for years, avoidance
of the various repercussions to
Row social life noted above is def
initely worth it.
ResEd needs to articulate a co
herent set of objectives and sort
out contradictory policies. If it
wants to enhance the vibrant social
atmosphere of the Row, which it
purported to protect by prohibiting
social due refunds, it should neither
obstruct a central ingredient (alco
hol) of Row parties nor foster a cul
ture of suspicion. If ResEd wants
to reduce underage drinking, it
should not effectively endorse a
roundabout social due system that
will continue to fund drinking in a
potentially unsafe and unaccount
able manner. And if the University
merely wants to distance itself
from underage drinking that it ac
cepts as a fact of life, it should col
laborate with students to transition
to a private social due infrastruc
ture with no official tie to Stanford.
That way, everybody wins.
