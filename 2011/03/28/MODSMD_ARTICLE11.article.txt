## The
						College Student's Case for Health Reform 
### HILDA L.SOLIS United States Secretary of Labor 
A year ago last week, Presi
dent Obama signed the Af
fordable Care Act. The law
enacts significant health insurance
reforms that will take effect over
the next several years. But one very
important piece of that law is al
ready in place. And it may directly
benefit you.
The Affordable Care Act en
sures that college students and
young adults can stay on their par
ents' employer-provided health
care plans until age 26. Before,
many health plans and issuers
dropped young adults from their
parents' policies because of their
age. That left countless college stu
dents, recent college graduates and
other young people with little re
course and worse no health in
surance. Historically, some 30 per
cent of young adults have been
uninsured, a rate far higher than
that of any other age group.
But young people don't need
health insurance, right? The statis
tics say otherwise: one in six young
adults today are faced with a chron
ic illness such as cancer, diabetes or
asthma. And nearly half of unin
sured young adults report problems
paying medical bills.
The new law ensures you have
an option when it comes to your
health care. This is important as you
continue through school and as you
transition into the job market, since
you may find that health care cover
age is not immediately available
through your employer. Or you may

work part time. You may choose to
continue your education and go to
graduate school, or take time off to
travel and pursue volunteer oppor
tunities.
It allows you to remain on your
parents' plan or rejoin it until age
26, even if you no longer live with
your parents, are not a dependent
on their tax return or are no longer
a student. The new flexibility even
applies if you are married. You are
guaranteed the same benefits and at
the same price that is available to
other dependents.
More health care improvements
are on the way, and many may also
directly benefit you. Already, cover
age cannot be denied for those
under age 19 because of a pre-exist
ing condition. By 2014, denying cov
erage to anyone based on a pre-ex
isting condition will be banned. An
nual dollar caps on care, which are
already limited, will be prohibited,
and state-based health insurance ex
changes will create a new market
place, giving more employers and
millions of Americans the ability to
purchase affordable coverage.
The Affordable Care Act is
based on the simple belief that
every American and that in
cludes college students deserves
access to high-quality, affordable
health care. One year after it has be
come law, that belief is becoming re
ality.
