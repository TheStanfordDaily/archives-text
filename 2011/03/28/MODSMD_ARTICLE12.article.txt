## SCSCOPSG: Stanford Coalition for Skeptics, Cynics, and Those Generally Opposed to an Over Politicized Student Government. 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
With ASSU election season upon us, now is a good
time to take a quick look at last year's out
comes. In 2010, the Stanford Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) endorsed twelve candidates in the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate race; ten were elected.The
Queer Coalition endorsed ten students; seven were
elected. The success rates of candidates endorsed by
these two organizations —7O percent for the Queer
Coalition, 83 percent for SOCC and 86 percent for can
didates holding endorsements from both organizations
is both astonishing, compared to the 43 percent suc
cess rate in the general field, and troubling. The fact that
these two interest groups hold so much sway in ASSU
election outcomes is perhaps the best proof that Stan
ford student government has become intensely politi
cized, with opaque interest groups, meaningless coali
tions and buzz-word laden empty rhetoric.
Start with the interest groups. They represent the idea
that the interests of colored, queer, Jewish, first-genera
tion, low-income, or environmentally conscious Stanford
students are somehow separate and different from the
general interests of the student body. For one, this seems
flawed considering the stated goal of most of these inter
est groups is to strengthen community as a whole. How is
voting in a block of similarly self-identified students ad
vancing this cause? Second, if an ASSU senator actively
advances a pro-colored, queer, or Jewish agenda, they
risk failing their more important duty, representing the
interests of the entire student body. Jlie ASSU Election
Commission makes matters worse, adding legitimacy to
the endorsement system by making them centrally avail
able on the official website. Banning endorsements alto
gether is obviously extreme, but the Election Commis
sion has no reasonable interest in recognizing them.
On to the coalitions and buzz-words. Last year 12 sen
ate candidates ran as a part of the Stanford United Now
(SUN) coalition with a platform centered on promoting
"student government that enacts pragmatic change on
the issues important to all students." Will all those op
posed to pragmatic change or those who don't care about
issues that students care about please stand up? It's bare
ly a stretch to assume every member of SUN was also for
promoting wellness, mental health, special fee reform
and diversity. And don't forget they were all green, too.
While a platform comprised of tackling these buzz-word
issues sounds admirable, it is nearly universal, and conse
quently meaningless.
The ASSU Senate itself is a glorified "Ways and Means
committee," holding the key to the special fee chest, cou-

pled with event planning and sponsorship responsibili
ties. So what actionable steps can ASSU senators take to
"promote diversity"? They could seek to make funding
for minority student communities easier or harder to ac
cess. So tell us specifically which you intend to do. They
could also plan or sponsor more events celebrating the
diversity of the Stanford community. Tell us, in exact
terms, what events you envision. "Special fees"? We'll
take a wild guess and go ahead and say most candidates
this year will be pro-reform. But do you plan on making
funds more accessible or less accessible? Do you want
the process to be more direct decided by the student
population or less direct a greater role for the ap
propriations committee? And what do you plan on doing
with the refund loophole? We could close it or make the
groups that people request refunds for suffer the conse
quences of students voting with their feet.
And finally "wellness" and "mental-health." How ex
actly do you plan to reduce the stress of a 10-week quar
ter system at one of the most competitive universities in
the world? The Stanford student body is already the
proud owner of the most expensive pre-school class
room imaginable, the ASSU Wellness Room. We proba
bly don't need another one or a playground for that mat
ter, but if you want to build either, tell us. Or let us know
exactly what promoting "wellness" means for the aver
age Stanford student.

We understand that most campaigns in the "real
world" are won and lost on vague and idealistic promis
es, but this is exactly why Stanford student government
should not try to emulate California state government.
Those we elect to ASSU Senate will be dealing with small
detailed changes and specific events, which (sorry to say)
will not change the world. And yet we as students allow
candidates who avoid anything vaguely resembling a de
tail in favor of sweeping, general, fluffy campaigns to win.
The take home message is three fold. For the ASSU
Election Commission: there is a legitimate, community
building interest in refusing to recognize endorsements by
any group or person. For those seeking elected office: rhet
oric is cheap, especially buzz-words like "diversity," "spe
cial fee reform" and "wellness." Tell us what you actually
plan to do, and do it by using words that have actual mean
ing. Finally, for everyone: don't vote as a block. And more
importantly, demand from candidates an actionable plat
form that differentiates them from others. Everyone
wants a more cohesive, diverse, inclusive Stanford com
munity. Let's decide for ourselves who can deliver.

interests of the entire student body. Jlie ASSU Election
Commission makes matters worse, adding legitimacy to
the endorsement system by making them centrally avail
able on the official website. Banning endorsements alto
gether is obviously extreme, but the Election Commis
sion has no reasonable interest in recognizing them.
On to the coalitions and buzz-words. Last year 12 sen
ate candidates ran as a part of the Stanford United Now
(SUN) coalition with a platform centered on promoting
"student government that enacts pragmatic change on
the issues important to all students." Will all those op
posed to pragmatic change or those who don't care about
issues that students care about please stand up? It's bare
ly a stretch to assume every member of SUN was also for
promoting wellness, mental health, special fee reform
and diversity. And don't forget they were all green, too.
While a platform comprised of tackling these buzz-word
issues sounds admirable, it is nearly universal, and conse
quently meaningless.
The ASSU Senate itself is a glorified "Ways and Means
committee," holding the key to the special fee chest, cou-

pled with event planning and sponsorship responsibili
ties. So what actionable steps can ASSU senators take to
"promote diversity"? They could seek to make funding
for minority student communities easier or harder to ac
cess. So tell us specifically which you intend to do. They
could also plan or sponsor more events celebrating the
diversity of the Stanford community. Tell us, in exact
terms, what events you envision. "Special fees"? We'll
take a wild guess and go ahead and say most candidates
this year will be pro-reform. But do you plan on making
funds more accessible or less accessible? Do you want
the process to be more direct decided by the student
population or less direct a greater role for the ap
propriations committee? And what do you plan on doing
with the refund loophole? We could close it or make the
groups that people request refunds for suffer the conse
quences of students voting with their feet.
And finally "wellness" and "mental-health." How ex
actly do you plan to reduce the stress of a 10-week quar
ter system at one of the most competitive universities in
the world? The Stanford student body is already the
proud owner of the most expensive pre-school class
room imaginable, the ASSU Wellness Room. We proba
bly don't need another one or a playground for that mat
ter, but if you want to build either, tell us. Or let us know
exactly what promoting "wellness" means for the aver
age Stanford student.

We understand that most campaigns in the "real
world" are won and lost on vague and idealistic promis
es, but this is exactly why Stanford student government
should not try to emulate California state government.
Those we elect to ASSU Senate will be dealing with small
detailed changes and specific events, which (sorry to say)
will not change the world. And yet we as students allow
candidates who avoid anything vaguely resembling a de
tail in favor of sweeping, general, fluffy campaigns to win.
The take home message is three fold. For the ASSU
Election Commission: there is a legitimate, community
building interest in refusing to recognize endorsements by
any group or person. For those seeking elected office: rhet
oric is cheap, especially buzz-words like "diversity," "spe
cial fee reform" and "wellness." Tell us what you actually
plan to do, and do it by using words that have actual mean
ing. Finally, for everyone: don't vote as a block. And more
importantly, demand from candidates an actionable plat
form that differentiates them from others. Everyone
wants a more cohesive, diverse, inclusive Stanford com
munity. Let's decide for ourselves who can deliver.
