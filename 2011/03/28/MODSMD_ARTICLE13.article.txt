# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Let's Talk About Sex 
### Cristopher Bautista 
Today marks the beginning of
my last quarter at Stanford. It's
strange, thinking that this is the
last time I'm going to experience the
first week of a quarter and the last
time I'm going to register for classes.
It's so weird to think about.
So I've always considered myself
a late bloomer. I didn't learn to write
an essay until my junior year (and
I'm an English major . . . for
shame!). I didn't realize I was a boy
until the age of 19, and I didn't start
male puberty until the age of 21.1
know I've taken a lot of great strides
in terms of my own maturity, but I
still haven't touched a lot of the mile
stones that are part of normal com
ing-of-age narratives. I feel like I've
missed out, and here I am, almost at
the end of my Stanford career. I feel
like I've just started.
For one thing, I'm still a virgin.
I've hesitated about focusing on sex
in my column, mostly because I
never thought of myself as a sexual
being. I'm at my last quarter, and I
have yet to have any sort of sexual
experience. I figured that maybe if I
wrote about it, then I'd feel more
comfortable approaching sexual sit
uations. Maybe. Flere it goes.
You see, sex is a strange concept
for transmen or at least, it is for
me. How exactly is a transman sup
posed to have sex? We don't exactly
have, you know, the right equipment

to do the job. I'm not very sure how a
girl would feel at the prospect of hav
ing sex with a transman. Maybe I'm
stressing out over this a lot more
than I should be. But it terrifies me
that I would be rejected from my
first sexual experience because of
my body which is why I don't take
the risk in the first place. I might be
confident as a man in all other areas
in my life, but when it comes to the
topic of sex, I feel inferior and not
"real." To a degree, I feel like I
shouldn't be allowed to have sex be
cause I'm not a legitimate man. It's
something I admit I'm still trying to
work through.
And call me a prude, but I don't
really see myself having sex with
anyone until I am in a committed re
lationship with them. It might be be
cause my rather strict Catholic up
bringing has made me this way. Or
maybe it's because of my inherent
terror of physical intimacy. Either
way, I'm not exactly a fan of casual
sex. One of the complaints I get from
my female friends is that I'm way too
respectful towards women (now
please tell me, how is that a prob
lem?). But I guess that's how I am,
and I can't really change it (I sincere
ly apologize, ladies).
I see sex as something that needs
to be done with consent and respect,
and I don't think I can handle that if
I'm drunk, and I would hate to be

that guy who went too far with a girl
and made her feel awful the next
morning. But that's just me, and I un
derstand that doing it the old-fash
ioned way might be a bit self-destruc
tive, since basically nobody does that
anymore, but I don't know, I can't re
ally see myself doing anything else.
So as I approach my last quarter at
Stanford, I feel pressured to finally
have sex. It does embarrass me to

We don't exactly
have, you know,
the right
equipment to
do the job

know that a lot of my freshmen have
more sexual experience than I do,
and I feel like I haven't fully taken ad
vantage of the experimental nature
when it comes to sex in college. It
feels like, you know, now or nothing.
But I know I shouldn't make myself
do something I'm not ready for. I
would never have sex for the sake of
having sex. That would be unfair to
both my potential partner and me.
But there is hope. During finals
week to procrastinate, I managed to
do some research on this great place
called the Internet. To keep things
short and relatively PG-13,1 did dis

cover that transmen can have suc
cessful sex lives (If you've got time,
look up a transman named Billy Cas
tro. He is my new hero). I've realized
that my feelings now, though con
flicting and complicated, are feelings
that are only temporary, feelings that
are not a testament to my own man
hood or masculinity but to my own
insecurities about my body. Hell, I'm
a pretty good-looking guy on the
short side, perhaps, but cute nonethe
less. I shouldn't have to worry about
the way I look. But I do. And it's
something I need to work on.
Who knows, maybe I'm fabulous
in bed. I guess we'll find out eventu
ally. We'll see.

Have some advice for this confused little
transboy? E-mail Cristopher at
