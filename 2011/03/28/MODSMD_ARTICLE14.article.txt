## Student government as social entrepreneurship 
### STEWART MACGREGOR-DENNIS '13 
Students can now change the
world with a computer and a
healthy supply of junk food.
We live in a time of exponential
technological growth where peo
ple in our generation are the
knowledge leaders. So, you may
ask, "What has this got to do with
student government?" The answer
is everything and here's why.
Talk to Travis Kieffer, a Stan
ford student who took a leave of
absence this year to run the non
profit Gumball Capital. Earlier in
the year, he ran a marathon on
every continent to raise funds for
Gumball, and when I talked to him
recently, he'd been coding for ten
hours the day before and was
working on expanding Gumball
throughout the country. On a shoe
string budget, Travis can potential
ly have global impact. Travis is one
inspiring example of many.
So, let's look at the question
"Where have students had the
largest positive impact on the world
in recent times?" That's a question
Chip and Dan Heath would ask. In
their recent book titled "Switch,"
the idea is put forward that when
you want to create a change, you
should look around for the "bright
spots," where it's working above
and beyond expectations.
My personal belief is that a
"bright spot" for student impact is
through entrepreneurship, particu
larly when using technology. When
you look at how a sophomore can
start a company that reaches 500
million users (and growing) or how
a couple of grad students can
change the world with a search en
gine, and at the many other less fa
mous examples, the answer is pret
ty clear: one of the most powerful
vehicles for people of our age to
change the world is through tech
nology start-ups and social-entre
preneurship.
The issues tackled by many so
cial entrepreneurship organiza
tions are the same ones as those
worked on by student government:
e.g. Mark Goldenson's Break
through.com works on mental
health and wellness though online
counseling technology, Kiva works
on empowering others to do social
good and cleantech start-up Amer
ican Efficient works on sustainabil
ity. What if student government

were to become more entrepre
neurial?
What do we mean by social en
trepreneurship? Well, it's not just
about starting new ventures. Steve
Jobs says that Apple is the "the
biggest startup on the planet" and
Google leadership still publicly
states that it considers its organiza
tion to be a startup. Entrepreneur
ship is about a set of principles for
decision-making and execution
that have arisen from the pressure
cooker of creating something new
with no safety net. It's a set of prin
ciples developed out of necessity
that is made for making a differ
ence as effectively as possible. To
paraphrase Saul Alinsky's com
ment on democracy, entrepreneur
ship is not an end, but the best
means towards achieving these val
ues.
How does student government
become social entrepreneurship?
You adopt the principles.
Here are three of these key princi
ples in a nutshell. One: staying
agile and reacting to changes. Two:
refining your initiatives by finding
out what people want, with an em
phasis on data analysis. This prin
ciple can be shown by the bur
geoning success of Hadoop and by
techniques such as what Steve
Blank calls the "Customer Devel
opment Methodology," where the
development of initiatives loops
through trying something, testing
it out with users, collecting feed
back and refining the previous at
tempt. And three: using strategy
and understanding your competi
tive advantage. These are just
some of the principles of startups,
and I firmly believe they'll under
lie the governance model of the
future.
We are in Silicon Valley. We
have some of the best minds and
hearts on the planet here alongside
our position as the world's epicen
ter for technology innovation and
entrepreneurship. Stanford is
uniquely positioned with incredible
infrastructure and resources to lead
the way with this new model for the
future. Bringing this together, the
sky is the limit and it tends to
ward infinity. Let's do it.
