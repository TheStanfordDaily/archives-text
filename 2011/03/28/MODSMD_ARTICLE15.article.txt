# How you can help Japan, and why you should

Last week's earthquake off the
coast of northeastern Japan
was the worst in the nation's
recorded history. Houses crumbled
in the shaking, an ensuing tsunami
ravaged everything in its wake and
the projected death toll has risen
into the thousands. The devastation
has yet to be fully grasped.
It is easier than ever to donate to
disaster relief and reconstruction
organizations, especially through
the Internet and mobile phones, but
with that increased ease comes an
increased need to fully understand
how these groups distribute funds or
provide services. Without this un
derstanding, it is impossible to de
cide which organizations deserve
your generosity. As a Japan-based
anthropologist and law student with
experience researching disaster re
lief efforts, respectively, our many
friends, family and colleagues have
reached out to us asking how to
help.
For the majority of Americans,
donating cash is the best way to go.
This is especially the case today,
while the plight of the Japanese peo
ple is fresh. When donating money
to an industrialized nation like
Japan, where doctors are highly
skilled, medicine is plentiful and
food is readily available from within
the country, it is best to send money
to local organizations. Donating 'lo
cally' means minimizing fuel costs
associated with sending people and
materials from abroad. People on
the ground will best know how to
maximize the power of your dollar.
Instead of donating to the American
Red Cross, for example, please con
sider donating directly to the Japan
ese Red Cross.
Three other local organizations
stand out for their excellence. JEN is
a Japanese NGO that has much ex
perience in disaster relief both in
Japan and abroad. Their teams are
already on the scene in the areas
most affected. They work coopera
tively with the Red Cross. AMD A is
a medical NGO that has also dis
patched medical teams to Tohoku.
Peace Winds Japan is considered to
be among the best in emergency re
lief and reconstruction.
These smaller NGOs are ex
tremely skilled and experienced.

They are attentive to local needs.
They respond according to each sit
uation, even in isolated areas, work
flexibly in response to fast changing
post-disaster conditions, and are
often free of the large overhead
costs or major bureaucratic con
straints that may plague larger
groups. Many such local NGOs re
main in the region to help with re
construction long after larger inter
national organizations leave.
Today, relief efforts are focused
on food, shelter and evacuation of
those most acutely affected by nu
clear radiation. Japan will have
other needs in the coming months. If
you cannot afford to donate now,
please consider sending money to
organizations that respond to these
future needs. For example, the Japan
Center for International Exchange
has partnered with the Center for
Public Resources Development in
Tokyo to launch the Japan NGO
Earthquake Relief and Recovery
Fund. Half of all funds raised will be
used to support Japanese NGOs
that are engaged in long-term re
construction efforts. These will in
clude rebuilding hospitals, schools
and retirement homes.
We must continue to monitor the
situation even after the media and
large aid organizations have left
Japan. The psychological effects of
the quake will undoubtedly be se
vere, especially for orphaned and
homeless children. Save the Chil
dren Japan will be setting up play
areas for children in the Tohoku re
gion, attempting to give such chil
dren a sense of normalcy. They have
pledged to remain in the region for
several months.
Japan's reconstruction effort will
take months, if not years. The Japan
ese need your help now, and they
will need your help tomorrow, too.
By knowing as much as you can
about the organizations to which
you donate, you can ensure that
your money will be sent to those
with the greatest need and with the
greatest efficiency. The people of
Japan are depending on you.
