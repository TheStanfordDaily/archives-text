## SERIES SAVED Baseball takes two straight after loss 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
An up-and-down weekend se
ries at Sunken Diamond left Stan
ford baseball with two wins over
Long Beach State, as the No. 12 Car
dinal bounced back after a frustrat
ing Friday loss and take the three
game set.
Stanford moved to 10-6 on the
season, with only a home game on
Tuesday against St. Mary's remain
ing before the Pac-10 season kicks
into full swing.

Each game against the Dirtbags
(12-11) became a race for six runs,
the final mark for the winner of all
three matchups.
"Clutch hitting was huge," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We were able to get hits with
two outs and with two strikes, and

that's exactly what [Long Beach
State] did on Friday."
Stanford fell behind early in the
opener and couldn't recover,
stranding 12 baserunners and leav
ing the bases loaded twice. Mark
Appel gave up six runs in the first
four innings, moving to 1-3 on a
night in which seven starting field
ers for the Dirtbags recorded a hit.
Appel and the bullpen held
Long Beach State scoreless for the
final five innings, but the Cardinal
could only muster two runs in six in
nings off righthander Andrew
Gagnon (3-3) in the 6-3 loss.
Saturday's game time was
moved to 5:30 p.m. due to expected
rain in the early afternoon, giving
Stanford an extra four and a half
hours to prepare after a 5:30 p.m.
Friday start.
"It helped our guys get some
rest, because there was going to be a
really quick turnaround," Marquess
said.
The Cardinal got off to a much

The Cardinal baseball team came back from a tough Friday loss at Long Beach State to take two out of three games
from the Dirtbags and win the series. Closer Chris Reed, above, retired eight straight in a key save on Sunday.
better start than the night prior
with two quick first-inning runs on
singles by shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger and first baseman
Brian Ragira.
Stanford starter Jordan Pries
came out strong but made a throw
ing error after being hit by a
Michael Hill comebacker in the
fourth, and he threw a wild pitch
two batters later to bring Hill
around to score, ft would prove to
be the Dirtbags' only run.
"It was all reaction," Pries said.
"I tried to reach out and couldn't
catch it, and I got flustered and
threw it away, which was a terrible
decision."
The righthander made up for it,
however, giving up no earned runs,
striking out the side in the sixth and
recording seven total punchouts in
as many innings. Diekroeger
backed him up by recording six outs
at short and grabbing a liner over
his head and several tough
grounders up the middle an im
pressive feat on a field that was still
slippery from the rain.
And on this night, the Cardinal
came through with enough run sup
port to hold its early lead, winning
6-1. Diekroeger and leftfielder
Tyler Gaffney who had stun
ningly leaped into the bullpen the
night before in pursuit of a foul ball
without success each knocked in
two runs, while Ragira followed up
a hitless Friday with three singles
on Saturday.
Following a short turnaround
for the 1 p.m. Sunday matchup.
Long Beach State roughed up Stan
ford starter Dean McArdle early in
the rubber game. McArdle, who
had given up just two earned runs
on the season, allowed four in an
outing that lasted only 0.2 innings.
"After the first inning, we had to
kind of do a gut check," said third
baseman Stephen Piscotty. "We had
to get guys on base. That's the name
of the game baserunners."
The Cardinal did get baserun
ners in the second, and came close
to making up the deficit. With the
bases loaded and no outs, a fly ball
by Austin Wilson came just within a
few feet of clearing the fence, but
was caught by Long Beach left
fielder Jeff McNeil. One runner
came around to score, but the next
batter, second baseman Lonnie
Kauppila, grounded into a double

play to end the inning.
With the score at 4-1, Stanford
loaded the bases again in the third
frame and took full advantage of
the opportunity. A Piscotty single
drove in two runners, and two more
came around to score on consecu
tive errors by the Dirtbags.
Long Beach State tied the game
in the sixth, but the Cardinal took a
6-5 lead off another Dirtbag error
in the bottom half of the inning.

The Dirtbags only had one more
opportunity to draw even. But with
runners at the corners and only one
out, the Cardinal brought in closer
Chris Reed, who retired eight
straight batters and struck out four
en route to his third save of the sea
son.
Piscotty led Stanford with two
hits, two runs and two RBI on the
afternoon.
The Cardinal will now prepare
to host St. Mary's (9-11) on Tuesday
at 5:30 p.m., but more important,
Stanford is the quickly approaching
Pac-10 season. The Cardinal is
picked to finish second in the con
ference by Pac-10 coaches and will
face Washington State (9-10, 0-3
Pac-10) to open conference play.
The Cougars were chosen seventh
by the coaches but still pose a chal
lenge.
"Every Pac-10 series is a big se
ries," Piscotty said. "Every team in
the Pac-10 is good. But we can't
worry about our opponents much;
we just have to focus on ourselves
and play to our capabilities."
Tlie Cardinal has already played
one game against a Pac-10 oppo
nent a 3-2 win over Cal but
the victory did not count towards
Pac-10 rankings.
