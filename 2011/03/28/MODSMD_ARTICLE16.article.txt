## SERIES SAVED Baseball takes two straight after loss 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
An up-and-down weekend se
ries at Sunken Diamond left Stan
ford baseball with two wins over
Long Beach State, as the No. 12 Car
dinal bounced back after a frustrat
ing Friday loss and take the three
game set.
Stanford moved to 10-6 on the
season, with only a home game on
Tuesday against St. Mary's remain
ing before the Pac-10 season kicks
into full swing.

Each game against the Dirtbags
(12-11) became a race for six runs,
the final mark for the winner of all
three matchups.
"Clutch hitting was huge," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We were able to get hits with
two outs and with two strikes, and

that's exactly what [Long Beach
State] did on Friday."
Stanford fell behind early in the
opener and couldn't recover,
stranding 12 baserunners and leav
ing the bases loaded twice. Mark
Appel gave up six runs in the first
four innings, moving to 1-3 on a
night in which seven starting field
ers for the Dirtbags recorded a hit.
Appel and the bullpen held
Long Beach State scoreless for the
final five innings, but the Cardinal
could only muster two runs in six in
nings off righthander Andrew
Gagnon (3-3) in the 6-3 loss.
Saturday's game time was
moved to 5:30 p.m. due to expected
rain in the early afternoon, giving
Stanford an extra four and a half
hours to prepare after a 5:30 p.m.
Friday start.
"It helped our guys get some
rest, because there was going to be a
really quick turnaround," Marquess
said.
