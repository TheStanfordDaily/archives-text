# Men's Tennis 1-2 in tough week
## 
### ALEX ECKERT 
The Stanford men's tennis team
had a busy spring break, going 1-2
against three top-20 teams and
rounding out the toughest stretch of
its regular season schedule with a
resounding win against No. 15
UCLA.

On Tuesday, Stanford (9-5, 1-1
Pac-10) traveled to Waco, Texas to
play No. 16 Baylor (12-3, 1-0 Big
-12), a team that had defeated the
Cardinal in all eleven previous
matches between the two squads.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Baylor's streak remained intact on
a hot Texas afternoon as Baylor
grabbed a quick 3-0 lead and never
relinquished it.
In its first team match in almost a
month, Stanford got off to a slow
start and seemed to lose every close

set of the day. The Bears took the
doubles point and the first two sin
gles matches in close, but ultimately
quick victories as the Card played
catch-up all afternoon. A 6-3, 7-5
victory by Ryan Thacher at the No.
3 spot kept the match competitive
at 3-1, but the match ended in a 5-2
victory for Baylor. The result be
came official when Baylor's 27th
ranked John Peers held off tenth
ranked Bradley Klahn in a second
set tiebreaker, 7-4.
After returning from Texas,
Stanford opened conference play at
home against a surging USC squad
(16-2,2-0), now ranked third in the
country. The Cardinal had a split
season series against the Trojans, 1-
1, but USC tipped the scale in its
favor with a hard-fought 4-2 victory.
With rain in the forecast, the
doubles point was canceled to get
straight to the singles.

Senior Alex Clayton, above, scored Stanford's first point in a 4-2 loss to
USC. The Cardinal dropped two out of three matches to top-20 teams over
spring break, including a loss to Baylor and a win over UCLA.
No. 5 spot. The Trojans then won
three straight matches until senior
Alex Clayton overcame a 3-0
deficit in the second set to win 6-3,
7-5 over USC's Daniel Nguyen.
With the Cardinal trailing 3-2,
the meet came down to a three-set
thriller between USC's Jaak Pold
ma and Stanford's Ryan Thacher.
The Cardinal junior had leads of 3-
1,5-4 ad 6-5 in the third frame, but
Poldma stayed strong, winning the
third-set tiebreaker 7-2 and clinch
ing victory for USC.
The weekend ended with a Sat
urday match against 13th-ranked
UCLA (11-5,0-2) and a chance for
the Cardinal to get back on the win
ning path.
UCLA started the season in im
pressive fashion, garnering a 9-1
record and a national No. 5 ranking.
However, the Bruins had lost five of
their last seven matches and had
consequently dropped in the rank
ings. With the bitter taste of a loss to
Cal suffered the day before, the
Bruins were also looking to re
bound come Saturday afternoon.
It was Stanford who seized the op
portunity, winning impressively, 6-1.
"We started much better than
we have in our last few matches,"
said head coach John Whitlinger.
"We got off to a good start both in
doubles and especially in singles.
We didn't get a good start against
Baylor or USC, but we did get one
Saturday, and it made the differ
ence."
The momentum clearly shifted

in Stanford's favor after Bradley
Klahn and Ryan Thacher, the sixth
ranked doubles team in the coun
try, clinched the doubles point by
defeating their seventh-ranked
UCLA counterparts in an exciting
match, 9-8 (6), that went to a
tiebreaker. Stanford never let
UCLA back into the match after
taking that early point.
"Right at the beginning of the
match you look up at our score
board, and both matches are up 2-0
on serve," Whitlinger continued. "It
was great for us to get that start, be
cause that's what we've been lack
ing in some of the matches."
Sophomore Matt Kandath
clinched the match at the No. 6 spot,
winning 6-4,7-5.
The weekend's matches mark
the beginning of the Pac-10 regular
season but also punctuated an ex
tremely difficult stretch of games
for Stanford. The Card has played
eight top-15 teams in the past
month and a half.
The matches have not been easy,
and the Cardinal has lost some
close ones, but Whitlinger is confi
dent going forward.
"I think we were in every match
in this stretch. We came up a little
short in a few of these matches, but
we learned that we can compete
with anyone. This was a good
stretch for us a tough one but
a learning stretch as well."
Whitlinger often says to the
team that the most important
match is the next one and the Car
dinal's next match is Friday at 5
p.m. against a vastly improved Tulsa
squad.
