# Men's Tennis 1-2 in tough week
## 
### ALEX ECKERT 
The Stanford men's tennis team
had a busy spring break, going 1-2
against three top-20 teams and
rounding out the toughest stretch of
its regular season schedule with a
resounding win against No. 15
UCLA.

On Tuesday, Stanford (9-5, 1-1
Pac-10) traveled to Waco, Texas to
play No. 16 Baylor (12-3, 1-0 Big
-12), a team that had defeated the
Cardinal in all eleven previous
matches between the two squads.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
Baylor's streak remained intact on
a hot Texas afternoon as Baylor
grabbed a quick 3-0 lead and never
relinquished it.
In its first team match in almost a
month, Stanford got off to a slow
start and seemed to lose every close

set of the day. The Bears took the
doubles point and the first two sin
gles matches in close, but ultimately
quick victories as the Card played
catch-up all afternoon. A 6-3, 7-5
victory by Ryan Thacher at the No.
3 spot kept the match competitive
at 3-1, but the match ended in a 5-2
victory for Baylor. The result be
came official when Baylor's 27th
ranked John Peers held off tenth
ranked Bradley Klahn in a second
set tiebreaker, 7-4.
After returning from Texas,
Stanford opened conference play at
home against a surging USC squad
(16-2,2-0), now ranked third in the
country. The Cardinal had a split
season series against the Trojans, 1-
1, but USC tipped the scale in its
favor with a hard-fought 4-2 victory.
With rain in the forecast, the
doubles point was canceled to get
straight to the singles.
