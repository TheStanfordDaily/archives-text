# ResEd explains Kappa Sig decision
## Fraternity enters appeals process to reverse removal of its housing 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
After the University stripped Kappa
Sigma of its on-campus housing at the end of
winter quarter, the fraternity has begun the
appeals process to reverse that decision. Its
leadership is preparing materials for Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman,
who will deliver a decision in about a week.

The decision to divest Kappa Sigma of its
house fell into the hands of Dean of Residen
tial Education (ResEd) Deborah Golder
after making its way through the Greek life
system. According to Golder, Kappa Sigma
has been of concern to the University for the
past two years.
"The house has had patterns of behavior
that go beyond what I would call shenanigans
... to a level that was dangerous," Golder

said.
She highlighted "an alcohol culture that
was dangerous" and student complaints
about feeling unsafe in the house as com
pelling problems. These concerns came to a
head last fall when Kappa Sigma violated its
probationary status.
"At that point, we would have been well
within our rights to say, 'Look you violated
your probation. You'll be suspended from the

University,'" Golder said.
University officials instead decided to give
the fraternity a final chance to demonstrate
its campus relevance and developed a multi
faceted process to remedy the most pressing
issues. As part of this process, Kappa Sigma
conducted a membership review and gave a
presentation to show its campus relevance.
"ResEd reached out to the na
tional organization and to the
alumni, asking for their help and
partnership in trying to get Kappa
Sigma back on track," Golder said.
In the end, these efforts demon
strated that the organization had
taken a turn in a positive direction
but fell short of dissuading the Uni
versity from taking further action.
"There is still a significant cultural
change that needs to occur," Gold
er said. "My very strong feeling is
that it is a privilege to be a housed
organization.
"Only 10 registered student or
ganizations on campus get the priv
ilege of being housed, and those are
seven fraternities and three sorori
ties, out [of] over 600 clubs and or
ganizations," she continued. "There
are certain things a group needs to
demonstrate in order to have that
privilege, and some of that is a
shared sense of identity and pur
pose."
If Kappa Sigma loses its appeal,
its current house will enter this
year's draw as a traditional Row
house. This would give the Kappa
Sigma leadership one year to prove
to the University that it should re
gain its on-campus housing for the
2012-13 academic year.
"The industry standard when
there is this level of concerns for a
fraternity or sorority is to suspend
them from the University for four
years," Golder said.
The idea behind the suspension

process is to "clean house," both lit
erally and figuratively. The Univer
sity has refrained from taking this
more severe approach.
"I see the potential of Kappa
Sigma, and I think they need a year
hiatus," Golder said. "They need
some time to get in touch with their
core values, to identify not just as a
group of tight-knit friends but as a
true fraternity by Stanford's defini
tion and Kappa Sigma's definition
at Stanford."
The decision to implement a
one-year hiatus stems, in part, from
the fact that younger Kappa Sigma
members were not involved with
disciplinary problems that sparked
trouble for the fraternity in the first
place.
"I think that the sophomores in
Kappa Sigma are very impressive,
and that's part of what motivates a
one-year only hiatus, so that they
can come back as seniors and live in
that house and have it be a model
organization," Golder said.
She emphasized, nevertheless,
the need for all Greek members to
recognize and accept a sense of
shared responsibility past, pres
ent and future.
"To be a member of an organiza
tion like Kappa Sigma, to be a
member of a fraternity or a sorori
ty, you get 112 years of Kappa
Sigma history and success ... but
you also get the missteps, and you
get the mistakes," she said.
Kappa Sigma president Brian
Barnes 'l2 declined to comment
until a ruling on their appeal has
been issued.
