# ResEd explains Kappa Sig decision
## Fraternity enters appeals process to reverse removal of its housing 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
After the University stripped Kappa
Sigma of its on-campus housing at the end of
winter quarter, the fraternity has begun the
appeals process to reverse that decision. Its
leadership is preparing materials for Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman,
who will deliver a decision in about a week.

The decision to divest Kappa Sigma of its
house fell into the hands of Dean of Residen
tial Education (ResEd) Deborah Golder
after making its way through the Greek life
system. According to Golder, Kappa Sigma
has been of concern to the University for the
past two years.
"The house has had patterns of behavior
that go beyond what I would call shenanigans
... to a level that was dangerous," Golder

said.
She highlighted "an alcohol culture that
was dangerous" and student complaints
about feeling unsafe in the house as com
pelling problems. These concerns came to a
head last fall when Kappa Sigma violated its
probationary status.
"At that point, we would have been well
within our rights to say, 'Look you violated
your probation. You'll be suspended from the

University,'" Golder said.
University officials instead decided to give
the fraternity a final chance to demonstrate
its campus relevance and developed a multi
faceted process to remedy the most pressing
issues. As part of this process, Kappa Sigma
conducted a membership review and gave a
presentation to show its campus relevance.
