# ON TO THE ELITE
## OGWUMIKE SISTERS TAKE DOWN TAR HEELS 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
On a night when the Cardinal
needed it most, Stanford's sister
show came through in a big way.
Nnemkadi and Chiney Ogwu
mike scored 12 of their team's final
15 points, boosting the top-seeded
Cardinal (32-2) to a 72-65 win over
a North Carolina squad (28-9) that
managed to keep pace with the
Pac-10 Champions, even in the final
minutes.

Junior forward Nnemkadi scored
consecutive baskets with 4:35 re
maining to pull Stanford out of a 59-
59 tie, and she put down another
critical basket with 3:08 on the
clock. Chiney, her freshman sister
and fellow forward, put up a huge
two-pointer with 1:59 remaining
after the Tar Heels worked their
way into another deadlock at 65-65.
Chiney Ogwumike all but sealed
the deal with just 39.7 seconds left,
putting back a missed shot from her
sister to pad the Cardinal's lead to
69-65.

"I was really sorry that I couldn't
make that shot," Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike said, "but when I turned
around and saw [Chiney] got the re
bound, I wasn't surprised at all. But
that's just kind of a characteristic of
her she's very aggressive and re
lentless, and she does a really good
job of firing the team up."
"We just try our hardest to per
form as well as we can," she contin
ued. "When you see something like
that, it's just kind of exciting to know
that you tried your best to take care
of the ball and contribute as much as
you could on the court."

Nnemkadi led the team with 19
points and Chiney, recently named
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year,
put up 16 of her own.

The victory was Stanford's first
away from Maples Pavilion in the
tournament and puts the team just
one win away from its fourth con
secutive appearance in the Final

Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike, above, along with sister, junior forward Nnemkadi
Ogwumike, led the Cardinal to a Sweet 16 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels.
The Cardinal will play Gonzaga in Spokane, Wash, for a spot in the Final Four.
Four. Stanford will round out the
Spokane Regional on Monday
night against llth-seeded Gonza
ga, which defeated No. 7 seed
Louisville, 76-69, to reach its first
ever Elite Eight.
Following her lackluster per
formance against UNC, some ques
tions linger around one of the Car
dinal's top players heading into that
game. Senior forward Jeanette
Pohlen, despite making a critical
trio of free throws in the final mo
ments, missed eight of her nine field
goal attempts against the Tar Fleels
and finished with just six points.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said she isn't particularly
worried about the veteran's unusu
ally sloppy performance.
"Honestly, a lot of times I'm not
really concerned about her confi
dence; I have a hundred percent
confidence in her," she said. "We
are going with Jeanette. She is the
person we brought to the dance,

and that's who we're dancing with.
She is a great player; she has had a
fabulous year, and the thing I said
to Jeanette was, 'l'm glad that was
n't your last game.'"
VanDerveer's feelings about the
UNC game as a whole were more
mixed.
"What we did very well [was]
not give them easy shots," she said.
"We got back on defense. We did
not rebound as well as we needed
to, nor did we shoot as well as we
needed to, but to have seven
turnovers against them, we took
care of the ball, which was a great
thing."
The Tar Heels outboarded Stan
ford, 50-47, but the Cardinal com
mitted only seven turnovers to
UNC's 13.
The win extends Stanford's win
ning streak to 26 games, the second
longest stretch in program history.
With a win against Gonzaga tomor
row night, the Cardinal would tie
the mark for the school record.
Stanford faces Gonzaga in
Spokane at 6 p.m.

"We got back on defense. We did
not rebound as well as we needed
to, nor did we shoot as well as we
needed to, but to have seven
turnovers against them, we took
care of the ball, which was a great
thing."
The Tar Heels outboarded Stan
ford, 50-47, but the Cardinal com
mitted only seven turnovers to
UNC's 13.
The win extends Stanford's win
ning streak to 26 games, the second
longest stretch in program history.
With a win against Gonzaga tomor
row night, the Cardinal would tie
the mark for the school record.
Stanford faces Gonzaga in
Spokane at 6 p.m.
