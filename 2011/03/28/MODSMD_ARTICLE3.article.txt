# ON TO THE ELITE
## OGWUMIKE SISTERS TAKE DOWN TAR HEELS 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
On a night when the Cardinal
needed it most, Stanford's sister
show came through in a big way.
Nnemkadi and Chiney Ogwu
mike scored 12 of their team's final
15 points, boosting the top-seeded
Cardinal (32-2) to a 72-65 win over
a North Carolina squad (28-9) that
managed to keep pace with the
Pac-10 Champions, even in the final
minutes.

Junior forward Nnemkadi scored
consecutive baskets with 4:35 re
maining to pull Stanford out of a 59-
59 tie, and she put down another
critical basket with 3:08 on the
clock. Chiney, her freshman sister
and fellow forward, put up a huge
two-pointer with 1:59 remaining
after the Tar Heels worked their
way into another deadlock at 65-65.
Chiney Ogwumike all but sealed
the deal with just 39.7 seconds left,
putting back a missed shot from her
sister to pad the Cardinal's lead to
69-65.

"I was really sorry that I couldn't
make that shot," Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike said, "but when I turned
around and saw [Chiney] got the re
bound, I wasn't surprised at all. But
that's just kind of a characteristic of
her she's very aggressive and re
lentless, and she does a really good
job of firing the team up."
"We just try our hardest to per
form as well as we can," she contin
ued. "When you see something like
that, it's just kind of exciting to know
that you tried your best to take care
of the ball and contribute as much as
you could on the court."

Nnemkadi led the team with 19
points and Chiney, recently named
the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year,
put up 16 of her own.

The victory was Stanford's first
away from Maples Pavilion in the
tournament and puts the team just
one win away from its fourth con
secutive appearance in the Final
