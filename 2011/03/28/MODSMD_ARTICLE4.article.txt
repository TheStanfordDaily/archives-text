## SPRING BREAK SWEEP Card keeps pace with four wins over break 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
After two weeks off for final exams,
the Stanford women's tennis team (17-0,
4-0 Pac-10) returned to face four teams in
seven days. Beginning with matches
against No. 71 Utah and No. 30 Pepper
dine, the Cardinal then recorded two con

vincing wins on the road against quality
opponents No. 8 UCLA and No. 13
USC —to remain undefeated for the
season.

Keeping fresh for each match proved
essential.
"The most important thing is to make
sure you're relaxed when you're not on

the court," said senior Hilary Barte. "Kick
your feet up, make sure you do whatever
makes you feel loose or comfortable."
The first few matches were marred by
repeated rain in the San Francisco area.
Against Utah (5-8, 0-0), Stanford swept
the singles before both teams decided not
to play doubles. All six players recorded
straight set wins for the 6-0 decision.
"That first Utah match was such a
struggle for me, but I think everyone did
well," Barte said. "For me, it was extra

tough. I had hurt my back and then
I got really sick during finals. I was
basically out for 2-3 weeks. [Coach]
Lele [Forood] said it though
'We got 20 percent better each day
we played on spring break.'"
The Cardinal then traveled to
Southern California for a three
game road trip. Again, the team
couldn't escape the rain while play
ing Pepperdine (7-6). Every singles
player won her first set before the
match was delayed a day due to
rain. Upon resuming play, only
Kristie Ahn and Stacey Tan were
forced to go to three sets. Veronica
Li recorded a double shutout vic
tory, 6-0, 6-0 over her opponent,
highlighting the day. Stanford
swept the doubles after that.
"Pepperdine is loud and always
really emotional at home, so that
adds to the competition," de
scribed Barte.
An anticipated matchup with a
tough and highly ranked UCLA
squad (11-5,1-1) was next. UCLA
delivered Stanford a one-sided 6-1
loss last season that helped moti
vate the team for its championship
run.The team didn't want to repeat

that loss this year.
Stanford gained momentum
early with three convincing wins in
doubles. The nation's second
ranked team of Barte and Mallory
Burdette defeated the nation's No.
17 team of Dolehide/Remynse, 9-7,
while the freshman duo of Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs defeated the No. 16
team of Hickey/Jones, 9-8 (5), in a
tiebreaker. In singles, Stanford's
only loss came at the No. 6 spot,
when Maya Johansson defeated Li
in three sets, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2, for
UCLA's only point on the day.
"The scoreboard doesn't show
it, but UCLA was a pretty tough
match," Barte said. "We almost lost
the doubles point, but we hung
tough and grinded it out.That's the
most impressive part, that none of
us were playing our best tennis, but
we all fought and found away to
get it done,"
With one rival dispatched, the
team only had No. 13 USC separat
ing it from a sweep of its first non
tournament road trip of the sea
son. The sole lead in the Pac-10
standings was also at stake, as
UCLA had edged Berkeley 4-3 for

its first loss in league play earlier
that day.
Despite the Cardinal's top dou
bles team getting upset 8-5, Stan
ford took wins at No. 2 and No. 3
doubles to earn the first point. Now
up 1 -0, the two teams went into sin
gles. At the top of the lineup was a
matchup of the nation's top
ranked player, Maria Sanchez of
USC, versus the nation's second
ranked player, Stanford's Barte.
Sanchez edged Barte, 6-3, 6-3, to
earn USC's only point on the day.
Gibbs closed her match out in a
tiebreaker in the second set for the
6-3, 7-6 (3) win. Ahn lost her first
set 4-6 and won her second set 6-0
before her opponent retired with
an injury. Carolyn McVeigh, play
ing at the No. 6 spot instead of Li,
won her match, 4-6,7-5,1-0 (6), in
the third-set tiebreaker and was
last off the courts.
Stanford returns home next
weekend to continue Pac-10 play
against Arizona State on Friday and
Arizona on Saturday.

After two weeks off for final exams,
the Stanford women's tennis team (17-0,
4-0 Pac-10) returned to face four teams in
seven days. Beginning with matches
against No. 71 Utah and No. 30 Pepper
dine, the Cardinal then recorded two con

vincing wins on the road against quality
opponents No. 8 UCLA and No. 13
USC —to remain undefeated for the
season.

Keeping fresh for each match proved
essential.
"The most important thing is to make
sure you're relaxed when you're not on

the court," said senior Hilary Barte. "Kick
your feet up, make sure you do whatever
makes you feel loose or comfortable."
The first few matches were marred by
repeated rain in the San Francisco area.
Against Utah (5-8, 0-0), Stanford swept
the singles before both teams decided not
to play doubles. All six players recorded
straight set wins for the 6-0 decision.
"That first Utah match was such a
struggle for me, but I think everyone did
well," Barte said. "For me, it was extra

tough. I had hurt my back and then
I got really sick during finals. I was
basically out for 2-3 weeks. [Coach]
Lele [Forood] said it though
'We got 20 percent better each day
we played on spring break.'"
The Cardinal then traveled to
Southern California for a three
game road trip. Again, the team
couldn't escape the rain while play
ing Pepperdine (7-6). Every singles
player won her first set before the
match was delayed a day due to
rain. Upon resuming play, only
Kristie Ahn and Stacey Tan were
forced to go to three sets. Veronica
Li recorded a double shutout vic
tory, 6-0, 6-0 over her opponent,
highlighting the day. Stanford
swept the doubles after that.
"Pepperdine is loud and always
really emotional at home, so that
adds to the competition," de
scribed Barte.
An anticipated matchup with a
tough and highly ranked UCLA
squad (11-5,1-1) was next. UCLA
delivered Stanford a one-sided 6-1
loss last season that helped moti
vate the team for its championship
run.The team didn't want to repeat

that loss this year.
Stanford gained momentum
early with three convincing wins in
doubles. The nation's second
ranked team of Barte and Mallory
Burdette defeated the nation's No.
17 team of Dolehide/Remynse, 9-7,
while the freshman duo of Ahn and
Nicole Gibbs defeated the No. 16
team of Hickey/Jones, 9-8 (5), in a
tiebreaker. In singles, Stanford's
only loss came at the No. 6 spot,
when Maya Johansson defeated Li
in three sets, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2, for
UCLA's only point on the day.
"The scoreboard doesn't show
it, but UCLA was a pretty tough
match," Barte said. "We almost lost
the doubles point, but we hung
tough and grinded it out.That's the
most impressive part, that none of
us were playing our best tennis, but
we all fought and found away to
get it done,"
With one rival dispatched, the
team only had No. 13 USC separat
ing it from a sweep of its first non
tournament road trip of the sea
son. The sole lead in the Pac-10
standings was also at stake, as
UCLA had edged Berkeley 4-3 for

its first loss in league play earlier
that day.
Despite the Cardinal's top dou
bles team getting upset 8-5, Stan
ford took wins at No. 2 and No. 3
doubles to earn the first point. Now
up 1 -0, the two teams went into sin
gles. At the top of the lineup was a
matchup of the nation's top
ranked player, Maria Sanchez of
USC, versus the nation's second
ranked player, Stanford's Barte.
Sanchez edged Barte, 6-3, 6-3, to
earn USC's only point on the day.
Gibbs closed her match out in a
tiebreaker in the second set for the
6-3, 7-6 (3) win. Ahn lost her first
set 4-6 and won her second set 6-0
before her opponent retired with
an injury. Carolyn McVeigh, play
ing at the No. 6 spot instead of Li,
won her match, 4-6,7-5,1-0 (6), in
the third-set tiebreaker and was
last off the courts.
Stanford returns home next
weekend to continue Pac-10 play
against Arizona State on Friday and
Arizona on Saturday.
