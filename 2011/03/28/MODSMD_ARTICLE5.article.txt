## BOSP helps Kyoto-bound students Program canceled due to State Dept. travel warning for Japan 
### BRIANNA PANG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following the Bing Overseas Studies Pro
gram's (BOSP) decision to cancel its Kyoto pro
gram for spring quarter, the University has for
mulated alternative plans for students who
planned to spend the term in Japan.
According to BOSP Executive Director Irene
Kennedy, the decision was finalized when the
State Department issued a travel warning for
Japan. BOSP consulted with numerous universi
ty offices in deciding to cancel the program, in
cluding the offices of the President, Provost, Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education, Risk
Management, Vaden Health Services and Envi
ronmental Health and Safety.

"Stanford has a long-standing policy of not
sending undergraduates on Stanford-sponsored
programs or with Stanford funding to countries
with State Department warnings," Kennedy
wrote in an email to The Daily. "At the same time
we reached our decision, all Stanford faculty, staff
and students currently in Japan
were urged to leave by Stanford's
Department of Risk Manage
ment."
Though BOSP has previously
canceled two three-week overseas
seminars in China due to the SARS
outbreak in 2003, the Santiago pro
gram remained in session during
Chile's 2010 earthquake. Kennedy
attributed this decision to safer cir
cumstances in Chile.
"There was no State Depart
ment warning and Chile's infra
structure was able to respond
quickly," Kennedy said. "The
events in Japan are tri-fold: earth
quake, tsunami, radiation leaks.
Events in Chile were less com
plex."
Students enrolled in the Kyoto
program were offered a variety of
alternative overseas studies oppor
tunities, including the option of ap
plying to study in Moscow, Santia
go, Paris, Florence or Beijing in the
fall of the 2011-12 academic year.
Students applying for winter and
spring quarter next year will re
ceive preference over other appli
cants. Lastly, these students auto
matically receive admission to next
spring's program in Kyoto.
For spring quarter, all Kyoto
students will remain in their cur
rent on-campus housing with only
one student moving within the
same dorm. Returning students
who were slated to occupy spaces
that would have been vacated by
Kyoto students have also been ac
commodated in alternative, on
campus housing.
"We traditionally have vacan
cies [during] spring quarter in un
dergraduate housing because more
students go overseas in the spring
than in winter and because some
students graduate early," wrote
Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing, in an email
to The Daily. "Given the small
number of students affected by the
cancellation of the Kyoto program
this year, we have been working in
dividually with the students staying
and the students returning from off
campus to provide all with the best
housing situations for spring quar
ter."
"As of this writing, we are grati
fied to be able to report that all the

situations where rooms currently
assigned to students who are now
not departing which had been as
signed to someone else for spring
quarter have been resolved," he
added.
Vinh Bui 'l2 was the only Kyoto
student required to change hous
ing for the spring. According to
Bui, Housing contacted him, ex
plaining that his original room in
Mirrielees had been changed from
male occupancy to female occu
pancy. Housing resolved the issue
by assigning him to a room down
the hall.
"If I had to move out of Mir
rielees, I would have been very
upset because it would be a hassle
to move out of the dorm entirely,
and because I like living here," Bui
said. "Fortunately, there were two
males who needed a roommate,
and one of them is a close friend
who lived only around the corner
on the same floor. It all worked out
in the end."
Bui now hopes to co-term or
take a fifth year at Stanford in
order to participate in the Kyoto
program in the future.
Not all students, however, are so
lucky. Charles Naut 'l2 will not be
able to go abroad next year be
cause he plans to be a Resident
Computer Consultant (RCC) in
Storey.
"I have been planning this trip
for a while," Naut said. "I've want
ed to study abroad in Japan since
high school and have been thinking
about the Kyoto program since my
freshman year at Stanford."
Naut said the change in plans
would free up time for senior year
and allow him to be here for things
he would have otherwise missed,
including his roommate's gradua
tion. Naut hopes to independently
plan a trip to Japan and other parts
of Asia once the travel warning on
Japan is lifted.
Kyoto student Mindy Phung 'l2
spoke about the possibility of con
tributing to relief efforts in Japan.
"There are a couple of us who
are interested in going to Japan to
do relief work even if it's not
through Stanford," Phung said. "It
would be a cool opportunity for
Stanford to coordinate efforts and
make a bigger impact, but it really
depends on the State Department
warning and Japan's willingness to
accept volunteers."

Though BOSP has previously
canceled two three-week overseas
seminars in China due to the SARS
outbreak in 2003, the Santiago pro
gram remained in session during
Chile's 2010 earthquake. Kennedy
attributed this decision to safer cir
cumstances in Chile.
"There was no State Depart
ment warning and Chile's infra
structure was able to respond
quickly," Kennedy said. "The
events in Japan are tri-fold: earth
quake, tsunami, radiation leaks.
Events in Chile were less com
plex."
Students enrolled in the Kyoto
program were offered a variety of
alternative overseas studies oppor
tunities, including the option of ap
plying to study in Moscow, Santia
go, Paris, Florence or Beijing in the
fall of the 2011-12 academic year.
Students applying for winter and
spring quarter next year will re
ceive preference over other appli
cants. Lastly, these students auto
matically receive admission to next
spring's program in Kyoto.
For spring quarter, all Kyoto
students will remain in their cur
rent on-campus housing with only
one student moving within the
same dorm. Returning students
who were slated to occupy spaces
that would have been vacated by
Kyoto students have also been ac
commodated in alternative, on
campus housing.
"We traditionally have vacan
cies [during] spring quarter in un
dergraduate housing because more
students go overseas in the spring
than in winter and because some
students graduate early," wrote
Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing, in an email
to The Daily. "Given the small
number of students affected by the
cancellation of the Kyoto program
this year, we have been working in
dividually with the students staying
and the students returning from off
campus to provide all with the best
housing situations for spring quar
ter."
"As of this writing, we are grati
fied to be able to report that all the

situations where rooms currently
assigned to students who are now
not departing which had been as
signed to someone else for spring
quarter have been resolved," he
added.
Vinh Bui 'l2 was the only Kyoto
student required to change hous
ing for the spring. According to
Bui, Housing contacted him, ex
plaining that his original room in
Mirrielees had been changed from
male occupancy to female occu
pancy. Housing resolved the issue
by assigning him to a room down
the hall.
"If I had to move out of Mir
rielees, I would have been very
upset because it would be a hassle
to move out of the dorm entirely,
and because I like living here," Bui
said. "Fortunately, there were two
males who needed a roommate,
and one of them is a close friend
who lived only around the corner
on the same floor. It all worked out
in the end."
Bui now hopes to co-term or
take a fifth year at Stanford in
order to participate in the Kyoto
program in the future.
Not all students, however, are so
lucky. Charles Naut 'l2 will not be
able to go abroad next year be
cause he plans to be a Resident
Computer Consultant (RCC) in
Storey.
"I have been planning this trip
for a while," Naut said. "I've want
ed to study abroad in Japan since
high school and have been thinking
about the Kyoto program since my
freshman year at Stanford."
Naut said the change in plans
would free up time for senior year
and allow him to be here for things
he would have otherwise missed,
including his roommate's gradua
tion. Naut hopes to independently
plan a trip to Japan and other parts
of Asia once the travel warning on
Japan is lifted.
Kyoto student Mindy Phung 'l2
spoke about the possibility of con
tributing to relief efforts in Japan.
"There are a couple of us who
are interested in going to Japan to
do relief work even if it's not
through Stanford," Phung said. "It
would be a cool opportunity for
Stanford to coordinate efforts and
make a bigger impact, but it really
depends on the State Department
warning and Japan's willingness to
accept volunteers."
