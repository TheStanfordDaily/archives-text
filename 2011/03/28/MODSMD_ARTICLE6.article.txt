## NYC campus plan takes step forward Stanford submits 'expression of interest' for Roosevelt Island site 
### JANELLE WOLAK 
Stanford has submitted a formal "expression
of interest" to New York City to build a satellite
campus. The proposed campus, which is slated to
be located on Roosevelt Island in the East River,
would incorporate both applied sciences re
search and graduate education.
"The campus will build on Stanford's
strengths," said Jim Plummer, dean of the School
of Engineering. "Our goal is to try and create
something analogous to Silicon Valley in New
York City."
Stanford is just one among a number of insti
tutions competing to fulfill Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's vision of a new science and technol
ogy center in New York City. In sum, 18 proposals
were submitted to the New York City Economic
Development Corporation (NYCEDC). These
proposals represent 27 institutions, some of
which are engaged in collaborative
efforts.
The list includes Abo Akademi
University in Finland, the Korea
Advanced Institute of Science and
Technology, Columbia University,
Cornell University and Purdue
University.
"It looks like [Stanford's] is one
of the more substantive proposals,"
said University spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin.
If selected, Stanford's New York
campus would not only provide an
opportunity for education and re
search, but would also enable stu
dents to start companies and take
technologies into existing compa
nies on the East Coast in short,
to bring the innovative spirit of the
West Coast to the East Coast.
With an initial focus on infor
mation technology, such as com
puter science and electrical engi
neering, the New York campus
would draw especially from the
Hasso Plattner Institute of Design,
the Graduate School of Business
and the Technology Ventures Pro
gram. Stanford hopes to later ex
pand the campus to include fields
like green technology and biomed
ical engineering.
"Stanford envisions a strategic
partnership that will blend
strengths of a great research univer
sity with those of a great center of
commerce and creativity and
generate significant and sustainable
economic development," reads the
text of the Stanford proposal, ambi
tiously named "Stanford and New
York City: Silicon Valley II."
If Stanford wins the competi
tion, it will begin construction in
2013 and convene the first classes
in 2015 with 440 masters and doc
toral students. This first phase of
development is expected to cost
$250 million, paid for by Stanford
itself and supplemented by the city
of New York and philanthropists.
With a projected overall cost of as
much as $1 billion over 25 years of
construction, the current target
once the project is completed is to
enroll 2,200 graduate students and
to hire 100 faculty members.

"The New York City campus
would not really be a remote sepa
rate campus, but a piece of Stan
ford which is closely tied to the
campus here," Plummer said. "The
programs and classes would be
very much the same, but the stu
dents and faculty would just be liv
ing and studying in the New York
area."
The New York campus would be
closely integrated with Stanford's
main campus in Palo Alto, relying
on distance education and telep
resence systems to connect the two
locations. According to Plummer,
the University's end goal is for
masters and doctoral students in
New York to never have to set foot
on the Palo Alto campus.
Stanford also hopes to explore
ways to involve undergraduate stu
dents. Much like the current cam
puses in the Bing Overseas Studies
Program and in Washington, D.C.,
the New York campus may become
a site where undergraduates can
spend an academic quarter.
Plummer said the site would
serve as a way to answer three im
portant intellectual questions.
"Can a 21st century university
be geographically distributed?" he
said. "Are the distance education
and telepresence systems enough
to make a geographically separat
ed campus look and feel like one
campus? Is it possible to create Sil
icon Valley in a different place?"
Of four possible locations, Stan
ford chose the Roosevelt Island
site as best suited for its purposes.
Located in the middle of the East
River, it has the advantage of being
close to Queens, Manhattan and
Brooklyn. It will serve as the home
for academic and research space
and provide housing for students
and faculty members.
On Apr. 14, President John
Hennessy will present and discuss
Stanford's proposal at his annual
address to the Academic Council.
He will be joined by Plummer, Jen
nifer Widom, computer science de
partment chair, and Robert Reidy,
vice president for land, buildings
and real estate. The address will
begin at 3:30 p.m. in the NVIDIA
Auditorium of the Huang Engi
neering Center.
