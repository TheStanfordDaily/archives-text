## GSB claims top U.S. News ranking Small class size, new MBA curriculum boost Stanford 
### HENRY ZHU 
After sharing the top spot with
Harvard for the past three years in
the U.S. News & World Report's
ranking of the country's top busi
ness schools, the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) has
claimed sole possession of No. 1 in
the newly released 2012 rankings.
Harvard Business School dropped
to second place.

The GSB, however, remains
modest about this achievement.
"Because of our belief in the in
herent limitations and subjectivity
of any ranking system, we are care
ful not to read much into our stand
ings, especially when the changes
are so small," GSB Dean Garth Sa
loner wrote in an email to The
Daily. "The margins among schools
at the top of this and other surveys
are very thin."

"Just as there is no 'best' city in
which to live or 'best' career path to
pursue, we don't believe that there
is a 'best school.'"

Saloner said he encourages ap
plicants to decide which school best
suits them based on their own per
sonal values, aspirations and inter
ests. Applicants' independent re
search and visits to different busi
ness schools provide a richer and
more meaningful picture than a
simple aggregate ranking, he said.
The U.S. News methodology is
based on a qualitative assessment
by peer deans and corporate re
cruiters, placement success and
school selectivity.

Measures of placement success,
an area in which the GSB excels, in
clude starting salary and percentage
of graduates employed at gradua
tion or three months after gradua
tion. Measures of student selectivity
include undergraduate GPAs and
GMAT scores of entering students,
as well as the acceptance rate.
Though a given school's accept
ance rate is not heavily weighted in
U.S. News' methodology, Stanford's
rate of 6.8 percent is far below that
of other elite business schools. This
low rate is partially due to the fact
that the GSB's class size is some
what smaller than those of its com
petitors.

With a self-reported tuition of
$53,118 in 2010, the GSB was also
the fourth most expensive business
school to attend in the country.
"Tuition is 'information,'" said
Barbara Buell, communications di
rector at the GSB. "ft is not a factor
in the [U.S. News] ranking itself."

Saloner said the GSB did not
take any deliberate action to im
prove its performance in the rank
ings.

"We set our vision and strategy
based on our deep knowledge of the
field of business and our abiding as
piration to continue to provide an
outstanding management educa
tion," he said. "We do not use rank
ings in our marketing. Rather, we
prefer to point to our records of re
search and education and have
those who inquire speak directly
with our students and faculty."

Saloner further believes that
the GSB's curriculum set it apart
from other schools. The business
school boasts a new MBA curricu
lum that debuted in 2007 and has
numerous collaborative efforts
with the University's other gradu
ate schools, including the School of
Medicine and the School of Engi
neering. The GSB's relatively small
student body size is also a distinct
advantage.

"We now offer a 16-person Crit
ical Analytical Thinking seminar to
all entering students, along with
small-group leadership labs and a
required Global Experience (usual
ly a study or service trip or global in
ternship)," Saloner said. "All this
comes on top of the canon of busi
ness knowledge necessary to the
strongest possible management ed
ucation."

"Together, these elements pro
vide a transforming two-year expe
rience for our students who apply
their leadership and passion for
management to a broad spectrum
of careers."

While Saloner believes it was
still too early for the Knight Man
agement Center, which fully opens
its doors on Apr. 29, to have made
an impact on the rankings, he ex
pects the center and the programs it
supports to be a source of innova
tive educational offerings in the fu
ture.
