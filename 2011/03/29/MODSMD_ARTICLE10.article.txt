## FRESHLY BAKED Ni Hao From Athens 
### Tim Moon 
Like many other students, I
spent this past week travel
ling with friends. But instead
of going on a cruise or relaxing in
some other warm, sunny region of
the world, we ended up in Greece. A
cold, windy, closed-for-off-season
Greece. Not quite what we had en
visioned when we made the impulse
decision to buy tickets after watch
ing a certain movie with Meryl
Streep singing and dancing on
Greek islands.
Despite the slightly uncoopera
tive weather, it was a good trip. We
rented cars and puttered around
Santorini for a day, lazily exploring
what was one of the most beautiful
places I've seen in my life. We sam
pled the Athens nightlife, where
Sunday nights are apparently more
hoppin' than Friday nights. We rode
donkeys, OD'ed on puff pastries,
saw some pretty sweet ruins and I
bought three big bags of Crispy
M&Ms.
Oh, and we also heard lots of
Chinese. Six out of the eight of us
were Asian, so given that the
Greece that we saw was about as
white as the tasty, tasty tzatziki I
kept having on my gyros, you might
say we stood out a little. When we
would pass by souvenir shops or
tourist-trap restaurants, storeown
ers would yell "ni hao!" in their at
tempts to get us to enter. Some went
above and beyond, knowing they
had to differentiate themselves
from everyone else yelling "ni hao"
to get our business. "Kung fu!"
earned one shop an extra second of
consideration, another got points
for showing off knowledge of other
languages with a "konichiwa,
sushi!" and one even broke out a
classic "ching-chong."
Now, many of the people walk
ing around either just ignored us or
gave us just one or two extra
glances, and almost all of the shop
keepers and waiters we interacted
with were friendly and helpful, so I
don't want to give the impression
that Greece is overflowing with
xenophobes or anything like that.
Nor do I want to blow this out of
proportion —if the worst experi
ence I ever have with racism is a
couple of errant "ni hao"s and
"ching-chong"s, I'll take it.
That said, it did start wearing on
me by the end of the week. Al
though the lack of real malice be
hind the comments meant we just
laughed at them instead of throw
ing down in fisticuffs, toward the
end of the week, I was just about up
to here with the whole thing and
was comparing it unfavorably to the
diversity of home.
If America's multiculturalism is a
soup (a much better metaphor than

melting pot or salad bowl, I think),
it's not so much a smooth butternut
squash soup as it is the depressing
bowl of fish soup we had our first
night in Santorini —just like how
the fish soup looked good but tasted
like chicken soup with random veg
etables and fish chunks thrown in
haphazardly, America's multicultur
al soup might look good, but the
components sometimes don't come
together like they should. Heck, just
look at the ugliness on both sides of
the recent "Asians in the library"
controversy, which a) shouldn't
have happened and b) needn't have
become so overblown.
But even though our soup might
not be perfect, it's still pretty darn
awesome. It's always easy to look to
other countries and imagine every
thing there to be better than here,
and in all my travels and stays
abroad, I've always been tempted
to think that I would prefer to stay
there rather than return home, but
as soon as I get hungry again, I re
member why America's soup is
pretty darn awesome.
Think about where we are.
We've got pretty tasty Mexican
food and legit Korean in Santa
Clara. We've got Chinese in Cuper
tino and Ethiopian and Vietnamese
in San Jose. There's a bangin'
Caribbean place in Menlo Park and
some great Indian restaurants in
Sunnyvale, And we haven't even
mentioned SF yet. We've got all
these different places nearby mak
ing authentic, delicious food be
cause they're catering to people
wanting a reminder of home. And,
obviously, the benefits of our multi
culturalism extend far beyond hav
ing more awesome restaurants to
eat at I think it'll be a while be
fore I hear another "ni hao."
Walking towards baggage claim
at the end of an 18-hour day of trav
el, I was pretty happy to be back
home and dreaming about my bed
when an airport employee inter
cepted us on our way to our
carousel and helpfully explained
that the carousel for the flight from
Tokyo was a different one.
... sigh.
Well, on the bright side, at least
she didn't say "ni hao".

glances, and almost all of the shop
keepers and waiters we interacted
with were friendly and helpful, so I
don't want to give the impression
that Greece is overflowing with
xenophobes or anything like that.
Nor do I want to blow this out of
proportion —if the worst experi
ence I ever have with racism is a
couple of errant "ni hao"s and
"ching-chong"s, I'll take it.
That said, it did start wearing on
me by the end of the week. Al
though the lack of real malice be
hind the comments meant we just
laughed at them instead of throw
ing down in fisticuffs, toward the
end of the week, I was just about up
to here with the whole thing and
was comparing it unfavorably to the
diversity of home.
If America's multiculturalism is a
soup (a much better metaphor than

melting pot or salad bowl, I think),
it's not so much a smooth butternut
squash soup as it is the depressing
bowl of fish soup we had our first
night in Santorini —just like how
the fish soup looked good but tasted
like chicken soup with random veg
etables and fish chunks thrown in
haphazardly, America's multicultur
al soup might look good, but the
components sometimes don't come
together like they should. Heck, just
look at the ugliness on both sides of
the recent "Asians in the library"
controversy, which a) shouldn't
have happened and b) needn't have
become so overblown.
But even though our soup might
not be perfect, it's still pretty darn
awesome. It's always easy to look to
other countries and imagine every
thing there to be better than here,
and in all my travels and stays
abroad, I've always been tempted
to think that I would prefer to stay
there rather than return home, but
as soon as I get hungry again, I re
member why America's soup is
pretty darn awesome.
Think about where we are.
We've got pretty tasty Mexican
food and legit Korean in Santa
Clara. We've got Chinese in Cuper
tino and Ethiopian and Vietnamese
in San Jose. There's a bangin'
Caribbean place in Menlo Park and
some great Indian restaurants in
Sunnyvale, And we haven't even
mentioned SF yet. We've got all
these different places nearby mak
ing authentic, delicious food be
cause they're catering to people
wanting a reminder of home. And,
obviously, the benefits of our multi
culturalism extend far beyond hav
ing more awesome restaurants to
eat at I think it'll be a while be
fore I hear another "ni hao."
Walking towards baggage claim
at the end of an 18-hour day of trav
el, I was pretty happy to be back
home and dreaming about my bed
when an airport employee inter
cepted us on our way to our
carousel and helpfully explained
that the carousel for the flight from
Tokyo was a different one.
... sigh.
Well, on the bright side, at least
she didn't say "ni hao".
