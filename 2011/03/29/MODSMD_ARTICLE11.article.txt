# OP-ED
## Diary of a Frat Bro 
### DREW KARIMLOU '11 
With the news of Kappa
Sigma losing their house
being received by the cam
pus with an excitement usually re
served for stories about oppressive
dictators being removed from
power, I thought it would be benefi
cial to write this op-ed. Let me be
clear, Kappa Sig made mistakes, and
they were at the mercy of a Universi
ty board that did not wish to grant
them another chance. Yet, too many
times on this campus I've seen peo
ple view the fraternity system
through a binary lens: frats are com
posed of depraved, rude and insensi
tive people, while other places are
composed of upstanding citizens.
The problem is people who have this
incorrect theory embedded in their
consciousness tend to find facts that
reinforce this "logic" instead of the
other way around, which would be
using information to formulate unbi
ased opinions. While a common ar
gument is that we bring this reputa
tion upon ourselves, I wish to chal
lenge this assessment. For example,
SAE has not had a sexual assault
case levied against the house in the
three years I have been a member;
yet, somehow we're the "Sexual As
sault Expected" dorm. My freshman
RAs used to "warn" me about how
fraternity guys were rude and disre
spectful towards women. For this
reason, I, like many others, initially
viewed the frat system negatively;
that was until I came to the realiza
tion that a junior who chooses to live
with all freshman and hopes to pos
sess a strange paternalistic influence
over them is probably less reliable
than an actual member of the Greek
community when it comes to dis
cussing the intricacies of the commu
nity. [SWI]
This is not to say that I don't en
gage in what some would call frater

nal activities. I often drink heavily,
only perform exercises in the gym
that enhance aesthetics and refer to
anything Charlie Sheen does as
"bro." However, in my spare time,
I've written two plays, I love spend
ing Tuesday nights alone in my room
watching "Glee" (Santana is my fa
vorite character) and I lecture a te
chinical communications course
through the Engineering Depart
ment. Don't think that because
you've heard hearsay over the years,
come to an SAE party and had a bad
experience or watched "Animal
House" that you know the first thing
about me, who I am, what I do with
my time or my opinion and attitude
regarding anything. Additionally,
there are generally 300 men in the
house when we have an all-campus
party, and usually 50 of them are
SAE's. Therefore, there is only a 16
percent chance that a male you came
in contact with lives in our house.
Every dorm on campus has a few
bad apples, and frats are no excep
tion. I've often heard, from various
campus representatives, that mem
bers of a fraternity should be moni
tored by the notion of collective re
sponsibility. This is a valid point; al
though, if one truly believes that you
cannot judge an entire group by a
few bad apples, then it's necessary to
be consistent. The day I hear some
one state that Kappa Sig as a whole
should be punished because of the
behavior of a few bad apples is the
day I would like to hear that same
person argue that the mosque at
Ground Zero should not be built be
cause a few bad apples ruined the
party for everyone.
I hope by now you've realized
that the title "Diary of a Frat Bro" is
a moronic sentiment. There is no
such thing. This is my diary, and this
is my opinion. I am just one person
who makes up a greater community,
and that community is far richer
than most people would like to
admit. If you want to get to know us,
email me personally and come visit
(in broad daylight, with a chaper
one, and you can pour your own
drinks if you still have anxieties). I'll
be glad to give you a tour and intro
duce you to 50 unique people hail
ing from 15 states and seven coun
tries who decided to live together
for the most basic of reasons: be
cause we enjoy it. I'm not saying all
criticism is unwarranted; I'm simply
saying come figure it out for your
self.
