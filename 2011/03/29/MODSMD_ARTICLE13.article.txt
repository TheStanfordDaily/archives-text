## Stanford Asians: What's it all about? 
### Blair Matsuura,'11 
Considering the immense con
troversy that UCLA student
Alexandra Wallace's diatribe
about Asian people has elicited, I
think it is necessary and appropri
ate to address the role and the cur
rent standing of the Asian Ameri
can community at Stanford.
The term "Asian American" was
coined in the late 60s, during the
Civil Rights Movement, as an alter
native to the racial slur "Oriental."
The Asian American community
arose as a product of the movement
on the basis of social and political
representation in American society.
Due to similar physical appear
ances, society classifies all Japanese,
Koreans, Vietnamese, Chinese, Fil
ipinos, etc. as "Asians" and projects
their stereotypes on us as a whole.
The Asian American community
was founded because society looks
at us a certain way, that is all.
The Asian American communi
ty's biggest problem at Stanford
and in America is general apathy.
For one, unlike ethnic communities
such as the Latino community, the
Asian American community does
n't have a common cultural or his
torical heritage at its core. The Lati
no community has cultural com
monality in language, religion and
immigration history, while the
Asian American community is root
ed only in social and political jus
tice.
The role of the Asian American
community is to bring together the
Asians on campus and to be a re
source for us to explore our Asian
American identity. In the bigger
picture, it should also present our
beliefs to the greater community
and empower us to combat the big
issues such as the "exotification" of
Asian women or the perception of
Asians as the model minority. Since
the community was founded in so
cial and political justice, the top pri
orities should be to educate society
about the issues and foster an envi
ronment that addresses these is
sues. If education and justice are not
the focus, there is nothing that actu-

ally binds our community together,
making it essentially a glorified so
cial club where people look the
same. I am not saying that Asians
should not be friends with other
Asians, but if an organization pro
motes Asian American community
building, but does not have the
same focus on the identity of the
community, the development of the
community is stunted due to the ig
norance of its members.
The Asian American Student
Association (AASA) represents a
wide array of culture and arts
groups, which in turn represent indi
vidual ethnicities. I think that these
groups are great: they provide a tan
gible contribution to the Asian
American community.
Conversely, I have a problem

with the Asian American "Big Sib"
program and the Asian American
fraternity and sororities. These
groups are not only the most social
ly visible groups on campus, but
their focus is technically just being
Asian American.
Last quarter, I attended the
Asian Pacific Islander Leaders Re
treat where leaders from the groups
sponsored by AASA attended to
discuss issues that affect the Asian
American community. There
seemed to be a general lack of in
sight in issues regarding identity
and community significance, even
though the Big Sib and the Greek
leaders were in attendance. I see
them repping their Asian American
organizations with flat billed hats
and letterman's jackets, but yet they
have little idea of what being Asian
American is about and why it is im
portant, which really disappoints
me. Many students do not know
what it means to be Asian Ameri
can. They know what it means to be
Japanese American, Filipino Amer
ican and Korean American, but not
Asian American
To me, being Asian American is
being comfortable in my own skin.
It is appreciating my Japanese
American culture and also valuing
other Asian cultures. It is empathiz
ing and caring about the struggles
and celebrating the successes of
other Asian Americans. It also has
to do with our battle with stereo
types and false perception. I take
pride in being Asian American, and
it is important to me that people un
derstand that.
This is the attitude that the
Asian American community at
Stanford should exude. The com
munity needs to educate itself and
educate the campus, and I think
that it starts with the Greeks and
the Big Sibs.
Why do I care? I don't want to be
judged based on the color of my skin,
and if the UCLA student offended
you, then this is your fight, too.
