## WEEKEND SPLIT Card unable to double up on MPSF opponents 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford's men's volleyball team
struggled to shake off the rust as it returned
to league play last weekend for the first
time since March 6, earning a weekend split
against Cal State Northridge and Long
Beach State at Maples Pavilion.
The last-place Matadors pushed the
Card to the brink in five sets before senior
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin iced the
hard-fought, 3-2 victory with two straight
kills on Friday night, but the team could not
overcome the athleticism of No. 9 Long
Beach and the nearly perfect play of
Antwain Aguillard, who had 24 kills with a
.686 hitting percentage in the 49ers' 3-2 vie-

The No. 2 Cardinal (15-5, 12-4 MPSF)
lost a non-conference match against NAIA
champion California Baptist two weekends
ago, but that game saw three of Stanford's
starters (freshman Brian Cook, juniors
Brad Lawson and Gus Ellis) sitting in order
to give some of the younger players an op
portunity to play in a competitive environ
ment.
Freshman outside hitter Steven Irvin
made the most of his third start of the year,
tallying a career-high 13 kills as Stanford
nearly pulled out the victory, dropping the
fifth and final set in extra frames 16-14.
On Saturday night against Long Beach
(12-10,10-7), Stanford played its third con
secutive five-set match, and second of the
weekend, and looked tired in front of a

tory.

small crowd of just 767 at Maples.
The Cardinal's outside hitters
McLachlin and Lawson stepped
up with 21 kills apiece, and the duo
hit a combined .364 even though
the team hit .291 overall and just
.245 in the final two sets. It didn't
help that Long Beach was pound
ing the ball by the end of the match,
hitting a ridiculous .658 with no at
tacking errors in the final two sets.
McLachlin said he thought Stan
ford could build off the fact that it
even had a chance to win the match
in the face of such an efficient at
tack.
"[A few breakdowns in the
serve-receive game] is the differ
ence in this league," he said. "We
can be right there, even if a team's
hitting .400. But a mental break
down late in the game is all it takes."
Junior libero Erik Shoji added
16 digs, but the Cardinal struggled
to find an offensive flow through

out the match. After McLachlin and
Lawson, the rest of the offense
combined for just 17 kills with 10 er
rors, not enough to take down a
49ers team that sits in the middle of
the MPSF standings.
But while Saturday's loss was
disappointing, it was not very
shocking given the team's struggles
the previous night against North
ridge and the general parity in the
MPSF.
Friday's match followed a script
almost identical to Saturday's, ex
cept that Stanford's offense man
aged to pick it up in the final two
sets instead of falling off. As a team,
the Cardinal was still below its sea
son average with a .250 hitting per
centage, but hit .308 and .421 in the
fourth and fifth games.
Lawson and McLachlin had 23
and 24 kills respectively, accounting
for most of Stanford's output, but
the duo got some much-needed
help from freshmen Eric Mochalski
and Brian Cook. Middle blocker
Mochalski and outside hitter Cook
had a combined 17 kills despite to
taling 11 errors and hitting just .146.
However, the man of the match

for the Cardinal might have been
little-used middle blocker Charley
Henrikson. The redshirt junior
from Lafayette, Calif., stands at 6-
foot-7 and has an impressive verti
cal leap but has struggled to crack
the rotation in his career with just
30 appearances and 12 starts.
But with the Cardinal unable to
pull away in the fifth set, Henrikson
pounded a nice set from Barry in
side the 10-foot line and notched his
third kill of the match. The point
gave a jolt to Stanford's game and
started a three-point surge that car
ried the Card to a 15-11 game win
and the match victory.
With classes back in session this
week, Stanford looks to jump back
into the swing of things and regain
the momentum it had before the
long layoff, when it won five consec
utive matches.

to find an offensive flow through

out the match. After McLachlin and
Lawson, the rest of the offense
combined for just 17 kills with 10 er
rors, not enough to take down a
49ers team that sits in the middle of
the MPSF standings.
But while Saturday's loss was
disappointing, it was not very
shocking given the team's struggles
the previous night against North
ridge and the general parity in the
MPSF.
Friday's match followed a script
almost identical to Saturday's, ex
cept that Stanford's offense man
aged to pick it up in the final two
sets instead of falling off. As a team,
the Cardinal was still below its sea
son average with a .250 hitting per
centage, but hit .308 and .421 in the
fourth and fifth games.
Lawson and McLachlin had 23
and 24 kills respectively, accounting
for most of Stanford's output, but
the duo got some much-needed
help from freshmen Eric Mochalski
and Brian Cook. Middle blocker
Mochalski and outside hitter Cook
had a combined 17 kills despite to
taling 11 errors and hitting just .146.
However, the man of the match

for the Cardinal might have been
little-used middle blocker Charley
Henrikson. The redshirt junior
from Lafayette, Calif., stands at 6-
foot-7 and has an impressive verti
cal leap but has struggled to crack
the rotation in his career with just
30 appearances and 12 starts.
But with the Cardinal unable to
pull away in the fifth set, Henrikson
pounded a nice set from Barry in
side the 10-foot line and notched his
third kill of the match. The point
gave a jolt to Stanford's game and
started a three-point surge that car
ried the Card to a 15-11 game win
and the match victory.
With classes back in session this
week, Stanford looks to jump back
into the swing of things and regain
the momentum it had before the
long layoff, when it won five consec
utive matches.

The Stanford's men's volleyball team
struggled to shake off the rust as it returned
to league play last weekend for the first
time since March 6, earning a weekend split
against Cal State Northridge and Long
Beach State at Maples Pavilion.
The last-place Matadors pushed the
Card to the brink in five sets before senior
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin iced the
hard-fought, 3-2 victory with two straight
kills on Friday night, but the team could not
overcome the athleticism of No. 9 Long
Beach and the nearly perfect play of
Antwain Aguillard, who had 24 kills with a
.686 hitting percentage in the 49ers' 3-2 vie-

The No. 2 Cardinal (15-5, 12-4 MPSF)
lost a non-conference match against NAIA
champion California Baptist two weekends
ago, but that game saw three of Stanford's
starters (freshman Brian Cook, juniors
Brad Lawson and Gus Ellis) sitting in order
to give some of the younger players an op
portunity to play in a competitive environ
ment.
Freshman outside hitter Steven Irvin
made the most of his third start of the year,
tallying a career-high 13 kills as Stanford
nearly pulled out the victory, dropping the
fifth and final set in extra frames 16-14.
On Saturday night against Long Beach
(12-10,10-7), Stanford played its third con
secutive five-set match, and second of the
weekend, and looked tired in front of a

Junior outside hitter Brad Lawson (above) continued his solid play this past weekend, but the Cardinal

The Cardinal's outside hitters
McLachlin and Lawson stepped
up with 21 kills apiece, and the duo
hit a combined .364 even though
the team hit .291 overall and just
.245 in the final two sets. It didn't
help that Long Beach was pound
ing the ball by the end of the match,
hitting a ridiculous .658 with no at
tacking errors in the final two sets.
McLachlin said he thought Stan
ford could build off the fact that it
even had a chance to win the match
in the face of such an efficient at
tack.
"[A few breakdowns in the
serve-receive game] is the differ
ence in this league," he said. "We
can be right there, even if a team's
hitting .400. But a mental break
down late in the game is all it takes."
