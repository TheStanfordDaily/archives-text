## WEEKEND SPLIT Card unable to double up on MPSF opponents 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford's men's volleyball team
struggled to shake off the rust as it returned
to league play last weekend for the first
time since March 6, earning a weekend split
against Cal State Northridge and Long
Beach State at Maples Pavilion.
The last-place Matadors pushed the
Card to the brink in five sets before senior
outside hitter Spencer McLachlin iced the
hard-fought, 3-2 victory with two straight
kills on Friday night, but the team could not
overcome the athleticism of No. 9 Long
Beach and the nearly perfect play of
Antwain Aguillard, who had 24 kills with a
.686 hitting percentage in the 49ers' 3-2 vie-

The No. 2 Cardinal (15-5, 12-4 MPSF)
lost a non-conference match against NAIA
champion California Baptist two weekends
ago, but that game saw three of Stanford's
starters (freshman Brian Cook, juniors
Brad Lawson and Gus Ellis) sitting in order
to give some of the younger players an op
portunity to play in a competitive environ
ment.
Freshman outside hitter Steven Irvin
made the most of his third start of the year,
tallying a career-high 13 kills as Stanford
nearly pulled out the victory, dropping the
fifth and final set in extra frames 16-14.
On Saturday night against Long Beach
(12-10,10-7), Stanford played its third con
secutive five-set match, and second of the
weekend, and looked tired in front of a

tory.

Junior outside hitter Brad Lawson (above) continued his solid play this past weekend, but the Cardinal
split a weekend series by beating Cal State Northridge before falling to Long Beach State on Saturday.
