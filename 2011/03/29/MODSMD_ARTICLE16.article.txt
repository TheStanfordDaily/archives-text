## 
### â€“ Nate Adams 
The 12th-ranked Stanford softball team put
on a strong showing as host last weekend, going
3-1 in an abbreviated Stanford Invitational at
Smith Family Stadium. The Cardinal defeated
Sacramento State 9-1 in five innings and beat
Coastal Carolina 10-2 in six innings to open the
tournament on Friday, then had its 14-game
winning streak snapped in an eight-inning, 3-2
loss to San Diego State on Sunday. The Cardinal
wrapped up the weekend with another win over

Coastal Carolina, a 10-0 shellacking that saw
senior pitcher Ashley Chinn toss a perfect game
for the Cardinal. Saturday's games were can
celled due to rain.

Sophomore pitcher Teagan Gerhart opened
the tournament by giving Stanford (23-4) a win
over Sacramento State (8-14), improving her
season record to 13-3 in the process. Chinn,
meanwhile, got her first of two wins against
Coastal Carolina (14-17) on the weekend, as she
tallied eight strikeouts and held the Chanti
cleers to just one run in her ninth win of the
year.
On the day overall, junior catcher Maya
Burns led Stanford at the plate, going 4-6 with
four RBI. Junior shortstop Ashley Hansen was
also 4-6 and scored three runs, while sophomore
first baseman Alix Van Zandt notched a pair of
hits and three RBI across both games.
The Cardinal's momentum might have suf
fered with the day away from the field, as
Stanford came out a bit sluggish against San
Diego State (20-13) on Sunday. The host Car
dinal didn't get on the board until the sixth in
ning, when Hansen hit a solo home run to pull
the score to 2-1. Stanford would go on to even
the score at 2-2, but fell in the tiebreaking
eighth inning.
Chinn gave her team a big pick-me-up in the
nightcap, throwing the second perfect game of
her career as she struck out four Chanticleers in
a 10-0 win. The Cardinal knocked in eight runs
in the first inning alone, led by Hansen's two
doubles and three RBI.
Stanford will play host to St. Mary's tomor
row at 6 p.m. at Smith Family Stadium and then
begin Pac-10 play this weekend as Arizona vis
its the Farm for a three-game series.
