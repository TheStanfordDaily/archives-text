# Commodores put a dent in lacrosse's perfect season
## 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
dropped its first game of the season on Sunday,
as the Vanderbilt Commodores pulled out a 15-
10 victory to spoil the Cardinal's previously un
defeated record.
The No. 15 Commodores were
just a shade better in the second
half after taking a 7-6 lead in the
first, scoring seven consecutive
goals to stop any attempt at a Car
dinal comeback.
Stanford had played five
straight road games, including three
in the last week a factor that un
doubtedly contributed to the lack
luster second half effort.
Senior midfielder Karen Nesbitt
was the Card's leading scorer with

three goals, and redshirt senior
midfielder Lauren Schmidt added
two.
The Commodores were the
third top-15 team Stanford has
faced so far this season, and as the
calendar crosses into April, the
Cardinal will transition from non
conference play to Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF)
games.
The Cardinal now returns to the
Farm for the first time in almost a
month, and it will take on Brown on
Tuesday afternoon then tangle with
rival Cal on Friday night to open up
the MPSF season.

Sunday, but the effort was not strong enough to overcome seven straight
goals in the second half that put the game away for the Commodores.
