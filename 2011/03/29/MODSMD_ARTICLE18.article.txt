# Final Four exposes 'Experts'
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
With four teams left in
the NCAA tourna
ment, I think now is
as appropriate a
time as any to revis
it preseason predictions.
In doing so, I came across the pre
season rankings and got to thinking
why do we have preseason rank
ings in the first place?
Why is probably the wrong ques
tion, however, because it is easy to an
swer. People love lists. They love
numbers. They are easy to under
stand, easy to order. When I don't
know what to a write a column
about, I make a list.
There is a problem with presea
son rankings though, even though
people look forward to them. Pre
season rankings aren't grounded in
much of anything concrete, only last
year's results, players lost to the pros
and graduation, and expectations for
recruits (which are often far off).
Consequently, the rankings often
impact teams' public perceptions.
That last part is worst in football,
where if a team is ranked No. 1 in the
preseason, it will go to the National
Championship Game if it doesn't
lose; even if two other teams don't
lose and are better than that No. 1,
numero uno is going to the title
game.
I've never been shy about voicing
my dislike for rankings. Preseason
rankings, though, are the worst. You
simply cannot place values on
groups of players that have not
played a single game together. Let's
take a look at some of this year's pre
season rankings.
No. 2 Michigan State: went 19-15,
9-9 in the Big Ten. The Spartans
squeaked into the NCAA tourna
ment as a No. 10 seed and promptly
lost to UCLA. Sure, they lost a few
players over the course of the season,
but this was not the second best team
in the nation at any point in the year.
No. 3 Kansas State: went 23-11,
10-6 in the Big 12. The Wildcats
needed a late-season run to guaran
tee a berth in the NCAA tourna
ment.They were a No. 5 seed and lost
in the second round.
No. 6 Villanova: went 21-12,9-9 in
the Big East. The Wildcats lost their
last six games of the season and 11 of
the last 15, including a first round
exit as a No. 9 seed against George
Mason.
No. 12 Gonzaga: went 25-10,11-3
in the WAC. The Bulldogs likely
would have missed the NCAA tour
nament altogether had they not won
the WAC tournament title.
No. 14 Baylor and No. 23 Virginia
Tech: went 18-13, 7-9 in the Big 12
and 22-12, 9-7 in the ACC, respec
tively. Both of these teams missed
the NCAA tournament. Sure, the
Hokies can say they were snubbed,
but neither team deserved its presea
son ranking.
Meanwhile, two of this year's
Final Four teams, including the high
est seed remaining (Connecticut),
weren't ranked and didn't even re
ceive a single vote in the preseason
rankings. Virginia Commonwealth is
the other team that didn't receive a
single vote.
Do I think rankings affect the
NCAA tournament field? Probably
not. Virginia Commonwealth didn't
receive a single vote in the last rank
ings of the year either, neither did
USC, and Alabama-Birmingham
only received four votes. Yet all three
got controversial bids to the NCAA
tournament. Tournament snubs St.
Mary's, Boston College and Harvard
did get votes in that last poll (11,
three and one respectively).
A team like Utah State, on the
other hand, only lost two games all
season, but had absolutely zero pre
season hype and only received a No.
12 seed, indicating the Aggies may
not have made the tournament had
they not won their conference tour
nament.
Maybe the preseason rankings
don't do a ton of damage (at least in
basketball), or maybe they do, but it
really is astonishing how off base
they are. Which brings me back to
my original question: are they really
necessary?

rules only apply when Kansas isn't
