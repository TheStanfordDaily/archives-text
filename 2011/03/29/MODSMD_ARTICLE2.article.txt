# FOUR FOR FOUR
## OGWUMIKES LEAD CARDINAL PAST GONZAGA 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
Four straight Final Fours.
With a dominant 83-60 victory over
the llth-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs in
Spokane, Wash., the Stanford women's
basketball team advanced to its fourth
Final Four in as many years.
"Yeah, I'm so excited, I really can't
even put it into words right now," said
senior guard Jeanette Pohlen, who will
leave Stanford having never missed the
Final Four. "Going to the Final Four
every year, I mean it's a dream for peo
ple, some people don't even get that
close."
The emphatic victory that punched
the top-seeded Cardinal's ticket to Indi
anapolis was the best game Stanford
(33-2) had played all tournament, and
the win was particularly impressive con
sidering that Stanford faced a sold-out,
hostile crowd that was silenced by hot
shooting particularly from the domi
nant Ogwumike sisters.
"Before the game, I told our team,
'history will be made tonight,"' said
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Let's be on the good side of it."
Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike made sure of that, leading the Car
dinal with 23 points and 11 rebounds,
while freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike added another double-double
with 18 points and 15 rebounds.
The Cardinal shot 65 percent from
the field in the first period en route to a

47-38 lead thanks to powerful play from
the Ogwumike sisters, who combined
for 23 points in the first half.
Gonzaga (31-5) did manage to keep
within shouting distance thanks to sen
ior guard Courtney Vandersloot, who
once had 18 points in a row for the
Zags, and during one nine-minute
stretch in the first half, was the only

Bulldog to score.
Vandersloot, the only player in Divi
sion I basketball history (men's and
women's) with 2,000 points and 1,000
assists, finished with 25 points to lead all
scorers in an emotional farewell game in
front of the pro-Gonzaga crowd.

The Stanford women's basketball team hoists the West Regional trophy after vanquishing Gonzaga to advance to its fourth
consecutive Final Four. The Cardinal will head to Indianapolis this coming weekend, where it will face either Baylor or Texas A&M.

Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike (front) and younger sister Chiney (No. 13)
combined for 41 points and 26 rebounds en route to an 83-60 win over Gonzaga.
The sisters from Cypress, Texas, have been dominant so far in the NCAA Tournament,
as both have averaged a double-double in the four tournament games so far.
Flowever, the strength of Stan
ford this season has been its ability to
make a run in the second half. By
forcing its way into the paint, getting
to the free throw line and shutting
down Vandersloot, the Cardinal had
extended its lead to 21 points after
just seven minutes of play in the sec
ond half.
By switching to a 2-3 zone de
fense, Stanford held Vandersloot to
just four points in the second half.
Gonzaga was the number one scor
ing team in the nation through the
regular season, but the powerful
Card defense held the Zags a whop
ping 26 points below their season av
erage of 86 points per game.
"I think we did a great job in the
second half; it was a great decision to
go to zone, because they have that
pick and roll play," Pohlen said. "I
didn't know if it was the best
matchups for us or I don't know what
it was, but I think our zone really
came through big for us tonight."

A balanced effort from the Stan
ford starting lineup also helped, with
senior guard Jeanette Pohlen scoring
17 points, junior guard Lindy La
Rocque knocking in three threes to
score 11 and senior forward Kayla
Pedersen scoring eight points and
grabbing 12 rebounds.
Stanford's solid team chemistry
came in the midst of a Spokane
crowd that heavily favored nearby
Gonzaga.
"I think that that type of environ
ment gets us really excited," Peder
sen said. "I think it gets our blood
pumping, when everybody's rooting
against you."
The trip to Indy marks the first
time that the Cardinal has been to four
straight Final Fours, and Stanford is
just the seventh team to reach four
consecutive Final Fours in history.
Flead coach Tara Vanderveer said
the packed Spokane Arena made for
an exciting challenge.
"Gonzaga has so much to be

proud of, what a great atmosphere,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm really proud
of our seniors and our whole team..
.we're very excited to get the win
here, and we're going to Indy."
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said the
Card's ability to keep Vandersloot
quiet in the second half was the dif
ference-maker against a motivated
Gonzaga squad.
"Vandersloot is amazing; she was
killing us, so we just said 'Lets zone it
up and be as aggressive as we can,"'
she said. "When they stopped scoring
and we kept scoring, it got really ex
citing."

The Cardinal now awaits the win

Final Four. "Going to the Final Four
every year, I mean it's a dream for peo
ple, some people don't even get that
close."
The emphatic victory that punched
the top-seeded Cardinal's ticket to Indi
anapolis was the best game Stanford
(33-2) had played all tournament, and
the win was particularly impressive con
sidering that Stanford faced a sold-out,
hostile crowd that was silenced by hot
shooting particularly from the domi
nant Ogwumike sisters.
"Before the game, I told our team,
'history will be made tonight,"' said
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Let's be on the good side of it."
Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike made sure of that, leading the Car
dinal with 23 points and 11 rebounds,
while freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike added another double-double
with 18 points and 15 rebounds.
The Cardinal shot 65 percent from
the field in the first period en route to a

47-38 lead thanks to powerful play from
the Ogwumike sisters, who combined
for 23 points in the first half.
Gonzaga (31-5) did manage to keep
within shouting distance thanks to sen
ior guard Courtney Vandersloot, who
once had 18 points in a row for the
Zags, and during one nine-minute
stretch in the first half, was the only

Bulldog to score.
Vandersloot, the only player in Divi
sion I basketball history (men's and
women's) with 2,000 points and 1,000
assists, finished with 25 points to lead all
scorers in an emotional farewell game in
front of the pro-Gonzaga crowd.

Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike (front) and younger sister Chiney (No. 13)
combined for 41 points and 26 rebounds en route to an 83-60 win over Gonzaga.
The sisters from Cypress, Texas, have been dominant so far in the NCAA Tournament,
as both have averaged a double-double in the four tournament games so far.
Flowever, the strength of Stan
ford this season has been its ability to
make a run in the second half. By
forcing its way into the paint, getting
to the free throw line and shutting
down Vandersloot, the Cardinal had
extended its lead to 21 points after
just seven minutes of play in the sec
ond half.
By switching to a 2-3 zone de
fense, Stanford held Vandersloot to
just four points in the second half.
Gonzaga was the number one scor
ing team in the nation through the
regular season, but the powerful
Card defense held the Zags a whop
ping 26 points below their season av
erage of 86 points per game.
"I think we did a great job in the
second half; it was a great decision to
go to zone, because they have that
pick and roll play," Pohlen said. "I
didn't know if it was the best
matchups for us or I don't know what
it was, but I think our zone really
came through big for us tonight."

A balanced effort from the Stan
ford starting lineup also helped, with
senior guard Jeanette Pohlen scoring
17 points, junior guard Lindy La
Rocque knocking in three threes to
score 11 and senior forward Kayla
Pedersen scoring eight points and
grabbing 12 rebounds.
Stanford's solid team chemistry
came in the midst of a Spokane
crowd that heavily favored nearby
Gonzaga.
"I think that that type of environ
ment gets us really excited," Peder
sen said. "I think it gets our blood
pumping, when everybody's rooting
against you."
The trip to Indy marks the first
time that the Cardinal has been to four
straight Final Fours, and Stanford is
just the seventh team to reach four
consecutive Final Fours in history.
Flead coach Tara Vanderveer said
the packed Spokane Arena made for
an exciting challenge.
"Gonzaga has so much to be

proud of, what a great atmosphere,"
VanDerveer said. "I'm really proud
of our seniors and our whole team..
.we're very excited to get the win
here, and we're going to Indy."
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said the
Card's ability to keep Vandersloot
quiet in the second half was the dif
ference-maker against a motivated
Gonzaga squad.
"Vandersloot is amazing; she was
killing us, so we just said 'Lets zone it
up and be as aggressive as we can,"'
she said. "When they stopped scoring
and we kept scoring, it got really ex
citing."

The Cardinal now awaits the win
ner of Baylor and Texas A&M, who
play Tuesday night in Dallas. Stan
ford's Final Four game will take
place on Sunday, April 3 at Conseco
Fieldhouse.
