# FOUR FOR FOUR
## OGWUMIKES LEAD CARDINAL PAST GONZAGA 
### JACK BLANCHAT NATE ADAMS 
Four straight Final Fours.
With a dominant 83-60 victory over
the llth-seeded Gonzaga Bulldogs in
Spokane, Wash., the Stanford women's
basketball team advanced to its fourth
Final Four in as many years.
"Yeah, I'm so excited, I really can't
even put it into words right now," said
senior guard Jeanette Pohlen, who will
leave Stanford having never missed the
Final Four. "Going to the Final Four
every year, I mean it's a dream for peo
ple, some people don't even get that
close."
The emphatic victory that punched
the top-seeded Cardinal's ticket to Indi
anapolis was the best game Stanford
(33-2) had played all tournament, and
the win was particularly impressive con
sidering that Stanford faced a sold-out,
hostile crowd that was silenced by hot
shooting particularly from the domi
nant Ogwumike sisters.
"Before the game, I told our team,
'history will be made tonight,"' said
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"Let's be on the good side of it."
Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwu
mike made sure of that, leading the Car
dinal with 23 points and 11 rebounds,
while freshman forward Chiney Ogwu
mike added another double-double
with 18 points and 15 rebounds.
The Cardinal shot 65 percent from
the field in the first period en route to a

47-38 lead thanks to powerful play from
the Ogwumike sisters, who combined
for 23 points in the first half.
Gonzaga (31-5) did manage to keep
within shouting distance thanks to sen
ior guard Courtney Vandersloot, who
once had 18 points in a row for the
Zags, and during one nine-minute
stretch in the first half, was the only

Bulldog to score.
Vandersloot, the only player in Divi
sion I basketball history (men's and
women's) with 2,000 points and 1,000
assists, finished with 25 points to lead all
scorers in an emotional farewell game in
front of the pro-Gonzaga crowd.
