# WBCA honors VanDerveer as Coach of the Year

### â€“ Nate Adams 
As her Pac-10 Champion women's basket
ball team seeks immortality in the ongoing
NCAA Tournament, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer received an honor of her own yester
day. The Women's Basketball Coaches Associa
tion (WBCA) announced VanDerveer as the
2011 NCAA Division I Head Coach of the Year.
VanDerveer has received several national
coach of the year awards in her career, but never
from the prestigious WBCA. She was the
Women's Basketball News Service Coach of the
Year in 1988, the Converse Coach of the Year in
1989 and the James Naismith Coach of the Year
in 1990, when she lead the Cardinal to its first
national championship.
"It is very humbling to be recognized by the
WBCA and by my peers with this honor," Van-
Derveer said. "I am very fortunate to get to
work with such a smart, hard-working and dedi
cated team of coaches and players. The dedica
tion that they bring every day both on and off
the court is the reason for this program's suc
cess."
VanDerveer has won a pair of national cham
pionships in her 25 years with Stanford (1990,
1992), and has led her team to nine Final Fours.
She was named one of 12 finalists for the Nai
smith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame last
month; the announcements for the Hall's 2011
class will be made in Houston next Monday.
