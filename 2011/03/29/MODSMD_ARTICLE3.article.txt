## Candidates face campaign spending cap ASSU Senate members disagree on effectiveness of cap legislation 
### BILLY GALLAGHER STAFF WRITER 
On Nov. 2,2010, the 12th Undergraduate Sen
ate passed legislation capping the amount of
money any slate seeking executive office may
spend on their campaign at $l,OOO.
The bill came in response to the 2008 election,
in which Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris 'O9
spent $3,597.31 and defeated David Gobaud 'lO
and Greg Goldgof 'OB, who spent $3,768.55. The
10th and 11th Undergraduate Senates failed to
pass bills containing caps.
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll, who
co-authored the bill with then-Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, said that the problem wasn't
an uneven financial playing field between slates,
but a concern that some slates didn't declare
their intent to run because of financial con
straints.
"I don't necessarily think that money equaled
success in the past," Cardona said. "But I do
think that money equaled even being able to run
in the first place."
Zachary Warma 'll, a member of the 11th Un
dergraduate Senate and former Daily columnist,
felt that the amount of money was not as signifi
cant as Cardona and others made it out to be.
"To say money isn't important in politics is in
sane," Warma said. "There's away in which
money helps, but at the end of the day, you have
to run a smarter campaign and a better cam
paign. People can outspend you, but you can win
as long as you do a couple of things really, really
well."
Current ASSU Vice President Michael Cruz
'l2, who is running for executive this year with
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, says his slate
"simply would not have the financial capability"
to run without the spending cap and the option
of public financing.
Joe Vasquez'll said he andTenzin Seldon'l2,
who are also running for exec this
year, would not be able to afford
to put on a more expensive cam
paign similar to some of those run
in the past.
Vasquez said the ASSU office
"is definitely a lot more accessible
for people of lower-income back
grounds like Tenzin and I."
Cardona also believes that the
bill is consistent with expectations
in other facets of Stanford life.
"If you look at the heart of the
bill, it's very much in line with the
Stanford culture of taking respon
sibility for your actions," she said.
"Just the way that our alcohol pol
icy works, the same way that our
honor code works. Stanford really
gives you a sense of agency as an
individual, and we're expecting
the same thing in the ASSU from
our potential leaders."
Rebecca Sachs 'l3 was one of
two senators who voted against
the bill. She feels that the spending
cap doesn't address the main
problems with ASSU elections.
"The cap doesn't actually
change the way the elections work,
it just shifts it to being more digital,
which it was already doing," Sachs
said. "It's no longer about t-shirts
and fliers, and that still doesn't
make it about the issues."
Will Seaton 'l3 also voted
against the bill, citing skepticism
of the feasibility of enforcing such
a rule.

Cardona noted that the cap
number of $l,OOO could be
changed in future years.
"This year is very much a pilot
year," Cardona said. "We do want to
see how it plays out in practice, not
just in theory. There is definitely
room for flexibility in the future, but
we thought $l,OOO was a good start
ing point. We looked at a lot of peer
institutions, and it was the highest
number that any other school had
for spending caps, and it's on par
with what Berkeley uses."
Warma argued, however, that
some language of the bill is too
vague and could lead to issues.
"I see loopholes miles wide that
if you read through this and you're
paying enough attention, you
could do a lot of damage to cam
paigns," Warma said. "You could
throw what was otherwise an en
tirely reputable campaign into a
legislative mess ... some of these
are the most cynical scenarios out
there. But these are real possibili
ties. And that's scary."
Cardona said she doesn't antic
ipate any problems with the
spending caps this year.
"I know every slate, and I fully
believe that they will do their best
to abide by the new guidelines,"
she said.
"You've made elections hard
er," Warma said. "You've conceiv
ably lowered the threshold for
people to get involved financially .
. . but what you have done is
you've increased the threshold of
difficulty for what is already a hor
rifically messy process. This was a
well-intended, horrifically imple
mented bill."

There are, nonetheless, some
things the sides could agree on.
"I'm really happy in the end
that they evened out the public fi
nancing and the non-public fi
nancing to $l,OOO each," Sachs
said. "I think that that makes it
more fair."
Elections Commissioner
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 said he will
begin working closely with the ex
ecutive slates to educate them
about the new campaign finance
rules and procedures now that
they have officially been approved.
