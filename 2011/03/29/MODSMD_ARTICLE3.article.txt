## Candidates face campaign spending cap ASSU Senate members disagree on effectiveness of cap legislation 
### BILLY GALLAGHER STAFF WRITER 
On Nov. 2,2010, the 12th Undergraduate Sen
ate passed legislation capping the amount of
money any slate seeking executive office may
spend on their campaign at $l,OOO.
The bill came in response to the 2008 election,
in which Jonny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan Harris 'O9
spent $3,597.31 and defeated David Gobaud 'lO
and Greg Goldgof 'OB, who spent $3,768.55. The
10th and 11th Undergraduate Senates failed to
pass bills containing caps.
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll, who
co-authored the bill with then-Vice President
Kelsei Wharton 'l2, said that the problem wasn't
an uneven financial playing field between slates,
but a concern that some slates didn't declare
their intent to run because of financial con
straints.
"I don't necessarily think that money equaled
success in the past," Cardona said. "But I do
think that money equaled even being able to run
in the first place."
Zachary Warma 'll, a member of the 11th Un
dergraduate Senate and former Daily columnist,
felt that the amount of money was not as signifi
cant as Cardona and others made it out to be.
"To say money isn't important in politics is in
sane," Warma said. "There's away in which
money helps, but at the end of the day, you have
to run a smarter campaign and a better cam
paign. People can outspend you, but you can win
as long as you do a couple of things really, really
well."
Current ASSU Vice President Michael Cruz
'l2, who is running for executive this year with
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, says his slate
"simply would not have the financial capability"
to run without the spending cap and the option
of public financing.
