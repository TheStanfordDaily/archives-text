## Maggiano talks Afghan corruption State Dept. official explored many facets of corruption in Afghanistan 
### NARDOS GIRMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Grey Maggiano, justice program manager at
the State Department, addressed the challenges of
international legal reform and rule of law in
Afghanistan on Monday at the Law School. Mag
giano focused on the prevalence of corruption in
Afghanistan and possible ways to address it.
The talk covered the varying definitions of and
opinions about corruption, particularly the differ
ences between American and Afghan perception
of it.
Although the United States government is
deeply concerned about corruption, it draws a dis
tinction between forms of corruption that directly
impact the U.S. and those that affect the Afghan
people, Maggiano said. Corruption exists in
Afghanistan on a broad scope and in daily encoun
ters that the Afghan people have with their gov
ernment.
The U.S. does not have the means to address the
problem on all of these levels, he noted.
"We as the U.S. government can only focus on
areas that are most critical," Maggiano said. "We
try to focus on areas of corruption that impact
Afghan national security and also the fight against
the insurgency."
While addressing corruption on a broader
scope may be highly important to the U.S., the
Afghan people are much more con
cerned with the corruption they
witness and experience on a day-to
day basis.
"This is where it gets really hard
for both the Afghan government
and the U.S. government to deal
with corruption, because the things
that most deflate people's public
opinion are the everyday local cor
ruption," Maggiano said.
In addition to legal definitions, a
variety of other factors, including
religious and cultural issues, make
defining corruption particularly dif
ficult in Afghanistan, he said. As a
result, it becomes even more chal
lenging to apply those definitions to
government transactions between
the U.S. and Afghanistan. Addition
ally, U.S. actions to fight corruption
in Afghanistan raise the issue of
how much international pressure is
acceptable.
While Maggiano focused on
Afghanistan specifically, he also
touched on the existence of corrup
tion in other countries around the

world and cited Singapore as a na
tion that has effectively decreased
corruption. Looking at the way
countries have successfully handled

corruption could also help in find
ing solutions to the situation in
Afghanistan, he said.
All things considered,
Afghanistan has made many
strides, among them the creation of
the High Office of Oversight, Mag
giano said. But he added that a lack
of transparency and mistrust of the
office still present significant prob
lems.
Christina Luu J.D. 'l3 saw simi
larities between Afghan corruption
and her parents' accounts of the
corruption they witnessed in their
native Vietnam. Luu's recent trip to
Mexico, which opened her eyes to
other cases of corruption, sparked
her interested in the talk.
"It was interesting to hear the at
titudes of the people in
Afghanistan," Luu said.
Daniel Lewis J.D. 'l2 is co-exec
utive director of the Afghanistan
Legal Education Project, an organ
ization made up of Stanford law
students who write and distribute
legal textbooks about Afghan law.
Lewis thought it was particularly
interesting to hear about the differ
ent definitions of corruption and
the clash between the different
branches of the Afghan govern
ment in addressing this problem.

These branches "don't always work
hand in hand," he said.
Lewis also acknowledged the
great strides that have been made.
"It's reassuring to know people
are dedicated and working to solve
corruption," he said.
