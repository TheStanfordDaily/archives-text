## Faculty recruitment remains strong 
### JANELLE WOLAK 
The University has experienced
"very high retention rates and high
recruitment success" in hiring of
junior faculty, according to Vice
Provost for Faculty Development
and Diversity Karen Cook. Faculty,
however, have cited several excep
tions to Stanford's overall success in
this area.
In fact, the goal of the Faculty
Development and Diversity Office
in recent years has been twofold: to
increase the number of women and
minority faculty members and to ad
dress the reasons why a faculty
member might choose to leave Stan
ford. Only 11 percent of Stanford
faculty members are minorities, and
25 percent are women.
According to the "Guide to Re
cruiting and Retaining an Excellent
and Diverse Faculty at Stanford,"
faculty recruitment searches are re
quired to make an extra effort to
find qualified women and minority
candidates, and one member of each
departmental search committee

must serve as a diversity officer. Fur
thermore, if the search committee
identifies a minority or female can
didate who is qualified but not the
top candidate, the committee is en
couraged to explore the possibility
of recruiting this candidate along
with the top candidate. Depart
ments and schools may capitalize on
opportunities to hire "equally quali
fied candidates from underrepre
sented groups."
Apart from these issues, Stanford
faculty report very high satisfaction
rates. Eighty percent of faculty re
spondents in a 2008 quality of life
survey described themselves as
"very" or "somewhat satisfied" at
Stanford. In a similar Harvard study,
85 percent of faculty members de
scribed themselves as "somewhat
satisfied."
And yet professors at all stages of
the tenure track cited the same rea
son that might push them to leave
the Farm: a desire for a more sup
portive work environment.
For assistant professor of music
Anna Schultz, who was hired in

2010, the University offers advan
tages and disadvantages in this re
spect.
"I came here because I felt a real
sense of support for research and
teaching," she said. "If I get a big
idea for a conference or a creative
idea for teaching, I know that there
is the support to make it happen
here."
But sometimes that's not
enough.
"There is a lot of support for indi
vidual projects, but there are fewer
projects in which people come to
gether collaboratively," Schultz ex
plained. "It is possible that there is
less of a sense of community here."
The University tries to address
these problems by periodically as
sessing quality of life through sur
veys and focus groups as well as
counseling and mentoring young
faculty. It also rewards faculty for
productivity via salary incentives
and other forms of compensation.
However, potential hires face
other deterrents, notably the prob
lem of dual careers. The quality of

life survey reported that 41.7 percent
of incoming professors had trouble
finding appropriate employment in
the area for their partner or spouse.
At Stanford, the Office of Faculty
Development and Diversity ad
dresses the dual-career problem.
Law professor Robert Weisberg
works directly with young faculty in
assisting their spouses or partners in
finding academic or other profes
sional positions at Stanford and the
surrounding area.
Yet another obstacle is the Bay
Area's high cost of living. The medi
an sale price of an on-campus home
is $1.5 million, according to the Fac
ulty Staff Housing Office. The quali
ty of life survey found that 25.5 per
cent of Stanford faculty reported
cost of living as a significant source
of stress, compared with 12.4 percent
of faculty at peer institutions.
Stanford has tried to address high
living costs by offering mortgage as
sistance and allowance programs to
young faculty and by providing more
affordable on-campus housing. The
University finished building a facul
ty-housing complex last year on
Stanford Avenue, called Olmsted
Terrace, with starting prices be
tween $700,000 and $900,000.
Faculty can buy a three- or four
bedroom house with a 51-year re
strictive ground lease, after which
time they must sell the home back to
Stanford. Despite the University's
efforts, the high cost of living re
mains a significant problem for as
sistant professors, especially for
those recently out of graduate
school without any money to spare.
