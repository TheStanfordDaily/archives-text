## Blood test could replace biopsy 
### JOSHUA FALK DESK EDITOR 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine have found that an in
crease in the presence of a heart
donor's DNA in a recipient's blood
is an early indicator of organ rejec
tion.
"In the patients who never re
jected, we saw a very constant low
level of donor DNA in the recipi
ents' blood, in marked contrast to
patients who rejected," said Hannah
Valantine, professor of cardiovascu
lar medicine.
Valantine co-authored the study
with professor of bioengineering
Stephen Quake. Their findings were
published Monday in the Proceed
ings of the National Academy of Sci
ences.
Over the last 40 years, rejection
in heart transplant patients has been
monitored by taking small heart
biopsies and analyzing them for evi
dence that the body is attacking the
heart, Valantine said.This procedure
is performed up to 12 times in the
year following the transplant and is
quite uncomfortable for the patient.
The study implies that an ordi
nary blood test could eventually re

place these surgical biopsies.
"The beauty of this new test is
that it bypasses the need to monitor
the immune response," Valantine
said.
The team discovered that the
level of a donor's DNA rises consid
erably before a heart biopsy shows
evidence of a problem.
"We think we can pick up the re
jection a lot earlier, and we can see
how it improves after a patient has
been treated for rejection," Valan
tine said.
"This has huge implications for
the patient," she said, noting that
treating heart rejection has many
side effects. "If we were to pick this
up early, we would not need to treat
the patient with such heavy anti-re
jection therapy."
The research team also included
Thomas Snyder, a research associ
ate in Quake's lab, and Kiran
Khush, an instructor in cardiovascu
lar medicine,
Stanford's collaborative atmos
phere played an important role in
Valantine and Quake's research.
"This is a very interesting
demonstration of the huge advan
tage of being at Stanford with the
opportunity to collaborate," Valan

tine said.
When Valantine read Quake's
publication on detecting fetal ab
normalities by examining fetal cells
in the mother's blood, she noticed
parallels with organ transplant,
since both involve the presence of a
foreign protein in the blood.
The researchers' approach,
which they call genome transplant
dynamics (GTD), can be applied to
other organ transplants, reducing
the need for invasive techniques,
Valantine said.
"There has been very little
progress in reducing chronic rejec
tion," Valantine said. "We now have
the potential to pick up early mark
ers of chronic rejection and thereby
intervene and reduce chronic rejec
tion and organ lapse."
