## To GET REAL, GET OFFLINE When the the line blurs between reality and your online avatar 
### ZOELEAVITT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The snarky comment on
You Tube you dashed out
and promptly forgot
about last week may have
lasting implications for us
all. In his recent book, "Virtually
You: The Dangerous Powers of the
E-Personality," clinical associate
professor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences Elias Aboujaoude
postulates that society has only
begun to see the disheartening way
online behavior can affect individu
als' offline selves.
Aboujaoude, a practicing psychi
atrist in Silicon Valley, became inter
ested in studying the long-term psy
chological consequences of Internet

use after noticing an increase in pa
tients whose Internet use had "up
ended" their lives.
"We know how the Internet is
transforming the world but not how
it's transforming our psychology,"
he said. "We need to assess the virtu
al world in an objective way, not just
look at the obvious positives."
Based on his study of problemat
ic Internet use in America, the
largest study of its kind so far, Abou
jaoude found that the anonymity of
the Internet and the distance it cre
ates between actions and their ef
fects have the potential to exacer
bate people's worst tendencies in
the real world. In other words, that
user whose video you slammed may
not show up at your door with a
baseball bat and demand revenge
any time soon, but the impression

that your rudeness has no conse
quences could stay with you forever.
The more time people spend on
line, the more accustomed they be
come to falling into certain behav
ioral patterns patterns that too
often involve talking without think
ing or judging without empathy.
"The personality traits that often
come out online, unfortunately, are
often negative traits: grandiosity, im
pulsivity, the tendency to regress to
less mature states, the tendency to
be angrier and less moral than in
real life," Aboujaoude said.
"We're not as good at compart
mentalizing as we think we are.
More and more, society is going to
resemble a chat room," he added.
The anonymity that we take for
granted on the Internet gives us the
opportunity to construct online
identities that we see as separate
from our "real life selves." However
according to Tessa Price 'l2, a re
search assistant at the Virtual
Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) of
associate professor of communica
tion Jeremy Bailenson, the separa
tion between these lives is becoming
less clear.
"Individuals are building their
physical identities into digital em
bodiments and vice versa ... we see
this on Facebook, World of War
craft, Second Life," Price said. "The
interaction between the physical
self and the digital self is so strong
there is little distinction between
what is 'you' and what is 'not you.'"
In his book, Aboujaoude argues
that the endless stream of "Click
Here's" and "Buy Now's" and
"Meet Sexy Locals Tonight's"
erodes individuals' impulse control
and makes it easier to destroy one's
offline life than ever before.
He draws a connection between
the recent recession and the atti
tudes toward spending that Ameri
cans have developed online. When
dropping $5OO on Roberto Cavalli

requires nothing more than typ
ing a number into a text box,
there is more than enough time
to drain a bank account before
carpal tunnel syndrome kicks
in.
"Money became a fic
tion "Aboujaoude said. "The
way we were spending in the
years up to the recession was
more like the way people
spend in Second Life, the
same kind of lack of
concern about conse
quence."
The Internet
can also foster se
rious problems in
relationship for
mation, and not
just because of
the possibility of
misplaced "sexts" and
Facebook relationship sta
tus gaffes. For example, the
prevalence of dating sites may en
courage suitors to make
superficial judgments,
searching endlessly for
perfection while being lured into an
inescapable loop of dissatisfaction.
Even if you hit it off with some
one on your first date or even if
you are married the idea that the
Internet might offer someone better
can seem endlessly alluring.
These issues affect most of the
country equally, according to Abou
jaoude's data. While he expected the
Silicon Valley and other higher-tech
areas to show higher rates of Inter
net-related real-life problems, the
rates proved similar across geo
graphic areas.
So-called "digital natives," those
who grew up using the Internet
daily, did display higher rates of in
ternet-affected behaviors such as
compulsive buying. While rates of
compulsive buying had long been
steady at six to eight percent, digital
natives now display rates of 40 per

cent
a num
ber Abou
jao u d e
calls "stag
gering."
Integral
to the problem, of
course, is that inher
ent in the Internet is also un
precedented access to information,
news, culture and communication
platforms. So how will the balance of
objective gains and psychological
detriments play out? It's too early to
know, according to Aboujaoude.
"To some degree this is a big so
cial experiment, so it's hard to pre
dict," he said. However, he added,
society needs to be more aware of
the problem and make it easier to
confront.
"This is not just an issue for rich
people; it can come up in each and
every one of us," he said. "As a cul
ture, we should be aware of the
problems and not make them some
thing you just deal with in the office
of a psychotherapist."
