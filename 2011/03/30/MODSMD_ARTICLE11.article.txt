# Los Altos Hills delays Stanford trail decision
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen Tyler Brown 
The Los Altos Hills City Council
has decided to delay the approval of
a trail project funded by Stanford
University, following objections
from the surrounding community.
The University offered Los Altos
Hills $1.05 million worth of trail im
provements in an effort to satisfy an
agreement with the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors con
cerning its General Use Permit
(GUP).

The GUP stipulates that the Uni
versity must build or improve a
number of trails in exchange for per
mission to expand the campus. To
meet this requirement, Stanford
seeks to improve the so-called "CI"
trails along Alpine Road, which run
through Portola Valley and unincor
porated San Mateo County, as well
as the Arastradero Road or "SI"
trail, which runs through Los Altos
Hills.
The University has sent letters
offering up to $8.4 million to San
Mateo County and $2.8 million to
the town of Portola Valley to fix the
Alpine Road trail in addition to the
Los Altos Hills offer. Both the CI
and SI trails cross Stanford proper
ty at several points.
Of the three offers, the one to
Los Altos Hills has created the most
controversy among residents, who
fear that improving the trail would
bring more traffic to the area and
lead to an increase in accidents.
University representatives were
also present at the March 17 city
council meeting, where they said
they would return with more de
signs for a proposed retaining wall
in response to some residents' criti
cisms.
Town officials intend to discuss
the project with neighborhood
groups in the coming weeks and
months.
"We want to meet the concerns
of the neighbors, and many of their
concerns are very legitimate," said
Los Alto Hills Mayor Ginger Sum
mit in a March 18 interview with the
San Jose Mercury News. "They
brought some things to our atten
tion that we had noticed, but hadn't
really addressed, so we will be ad
dressing those."
The city council is expected to re
visit the topic in a few months, after
the town does "more homework,"
Summit said.
"We are working closely with
Stanford, and Stanford now has
shown up at two public hearings,"
Summit said. "So they understand
the voice of the residents, which I
think they never really understood
before."
