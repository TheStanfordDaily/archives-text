## LONG DISTANCE FORMULA 
### MOLLY VORWERCK 
It's a common sight to see
Stanford couples holding
hands in the quad or cuddling
up next to each other while
sharing a hot chocolate at the
CoHo. But what about those stu
dents whose sweethearts are more
than a five or 10-minute bike ride
away?
According to The Center for the
Study of Long Distance Relation
ships, there are an estimated 4 to 4.5
million college couples in the Unit
ed States that are involved in a long
distance relationship. Long distance
relationships suggest a mixed bag of
emotional experiences weeks,
perhaps months, of being apart,
finding gushy love letters sent via
snail mail in your mailbox and of
course, the eventual, ultimately
gratifying reunions. But that's not
all there is to it.
Ginny Scholtes 'l3 and her
boyfriend, Murphy, have been to
gether for two years and seven
months. They met while both attend
ing Laguna Hills High School in La
guna Hills, Calif, when they were
members of the swim and water polo
teams. For Scholtes, the idea of
breaking up with her long-time
boyfriend never crossed her mind.
"We just couldn't break up," she
recalled with a smile.
Despite her faith in their rela
tionship, Scholtes said that the
stress of being in a long distance re
lationship did affect her life as a
Stanford student.
"It's very hard to deal with trying
to balance two different lives, be
cause in away you can't be fully in
either one," she said. "No matter
where you are, you're missing a part
of yourself all the time."
In order to keep up the spark in
their relationship, Scholtes fre
quently Skyped and exchanged let
ters with her boyfriend.
However, the relationship put a
strain on her social life at Stanford.
"I like going out and I love danc
ing, but for the first two quarters of
my freshman year, I wouldn't go
out," she said. "Before spring quar
ter [in which I rushed and joined a
sorority], I probably went out a total
of three times. I just couldn't deal
with seeing other couples every
where or watching my girlfriends
dance with other guys."
Now that Murphy is attending
The Culinary Institute of America
in Napa, Calif., only a two hour
drive away from Palo Alto, the cou
ple gets to see each other nearly
every weekend.
Some couples don't have that
luxury. What about those those peo
ple whose relationships span across
the country, perhaps even thou
sands of miles?
Randy Casals 'l3 has been with
his girlfriend, Katrina, a freshman at
Drexel University, since his junior
year of high school. After taking a
break last quarter, Casals and Katri
na got back together, con
scious of the expecta
tions and restrictions
of a long distance re- /Y— N A
lationship. J J
"It's really hard to
have as much fun
when you're at HUI
school because

you know you're missing some
thing, and then when you are home
[together], you feel rushed because
you feel like you have to make up
for the time you missed," he said. "It
puts a lot of pressure on the time
when you're together."
Their short break showed him
what life would be like if they
weren't together, which he admits
would be significantly less stressful,
but not as worthwhile as being in a
relationship with Katrina. During
their break, Casals found himself
more engaged with friends that he
might have otherwise lost touch
with after freshman year, and he
went out more on weekends.
"[Being in a long distance rela
tionship] definitely makes me less
social because I have to devote a
portion of time to my relationship,"
he said. "So I'm definitely with
drawn, but I don't see that as a bad
thing. If I had a girlfriend on cam
pus, I would be even more with
drawn."
Marcia Levitan 'l3, whose
boyfriend is studying abroad this
quarter in Florence, Italy, maintains
that her preconceived expectations
of being in a long distance relation
ship differ from her actual, tempo
rary experience.
"You have to be really patient,"
she said. "We Skype a lot, way more
than I thought we would, and that's
the only thing that has really kept
our relationship going."
Robert Levenson, a professor of
psychology and researcher at the
University of California, Berkeley,
said that in general, the biggest chal
lenge for couples in long distance
relationships is dealing with the
lack of day-to-day contact, even
with the abundance of forms of
electronic communication modern
technology provides.
"Relationships sort of digest the
events of every day together," he
said. "Couples tend to get together
at some point during the day and
get caught up, and they live through
the changes of life together. In long
distance relationships, it's really dif
ficult to do that."
In addition to the inherent lack
of communication that comes with
the distance, Levenson cited the
threat of falling prey to other suit
ors as an additional stress on these
relationships.
"Obviously, when couples are
apart, there are all sorts of tempta
tions," he said. "I think fidelity,
monogamy and whatnot are really
challenging because you get lonely
and you're in these environments
with all sorts of other options, par
ticularly young people in the social
environment of the university."
Because stress, insecurities and
temptations abound in the college
setting, long distance couples, natu
rally, have a higher risk of relation
ship failure than the average cou
ple,
"Relationships always fail over
the failure to resolve conflict, and
anything that makes conflict reso
lution more difficult, like lack
of proximity, is going to make
it more likely to fail over the
inevitable kinds of conflicts
that arise," he said. "I think
the key to making a long dis
tance relationship work is
setting realistic expectations

rather than extraordinary unrealis
tic ones. If you set the bar too high,
you're going to be constantly disap
pointed."
However, Levenson believes
that there are some eventual bene

fits to maintaining a long distance
relationship.
"The reunions, looking forward
to seeing each other, are the poten
tial glue of keeping this type of rela
tionship together," he said.

According to Annie Osborn 'l4,
whose roommate is in a long dis
tance relationship, these relation
ships seems like an added anxiety in
a college student's already demand
ing life.
"In general, my friends in long
distance relationships seem slightly
more stressed than my friends in
non-long distance relationships,"
she said. "I think that with a long
distance relationship there are in
herent questions of trust and intent,
and I think that any ties that you
have with somebody back home re
quires an extra amount of energy
and effort to maintain."
But for Casals, the extra energy
required in maintaining his rela
tionship is a small price to pay.
"It's worth it when you know
that you're coming home to some
body," he said. "It's like a breath of
fresh air."

out," she said. "Before spring quar
ter [in which I rushed and joined a
sorority], I probably went out a total
of three times. I just couldn't deal
with seeing other couples every
where or watching my girlfriends
dance with other guys."
Now that Murphy is attending
The Culinary Institute of America
in Napa, Calif., only a two hour
drive away from Palo Alto, the cou
ple gets to see each other nearly
every weekend.
Some couples don't have that
luxury. What about those those peo
ple whose relationships span across
the country, perhaps even thou
sands of miles?
Randy Casals 'l3 has been with
his girlfriend, Katrina, a freshman at
Drexel University, since his junior
year of high school. After taking a
break last quarter, Casals and Katri
na got back together, con
scious of the expecta
tions and restrictions
of a long distance re- /Y— N A
lationship. J J
"It's really hard to
have as much fun
when you're at HUI
school because

you know you're missing some
thing, and then when you are home
[together], you feel rushed because
you feel like you have to make up
for the time you missed," he said. "It
puts a lot of pressure on the time
when you're together."
Their short break showed him
what life would be like if they
weren't together, which he admits
would be significantly less stressful,
but not as worthwhile as being in a
relationship with Katrina. During
their break, Casals found himself
more engaged with friends that he
might have otherwise lost touch
with after freshman year, and he
went out more on weekends.
"[Being in a long distance rela
tionship] definitely makes me less
social because I have to devote a
portion of time to my relationship,"
he said. "So I'm definitely with
drawn, but I don't see that as a bad
thing. If I had a girlfriend on cam
pus, I would be even more with
drawn."
Marcia Levitan 'l3, whose
boyfriend is studying abroad this
quarter in Florence, Italy, maintains
that her preconceived expectations
of being in a long distance relation
ship differ from her actual, tempo
rary experience.
"You have to be really patient,"
she said. "We Skype a lot, way more
than I thought we would, and that's
the only thing that has really kept
our relationship going."
Robert Levenson, a professor of
psychology and researcher at the
University of California, Berkeley,
said that in general, the biggest chal
lenge for couples in long distance
relationships is dealing with the
lack of day-to-day contact, even
with the abundance of forms of
electronic communication modern
technology provides.
"Relationships sort of digest the
events of every day together," he
said. "Couples tend to get together
at some point during the day and
get caught up, and they live through
the changes of life together. In long
distance relationships, it's really dif
ficult to do that."
In addition to the inherent lack
of communication that comes with
the distance, Levenson cited the
threat of falling prey to other suit
ors as an additional stress on these
relationships.
"Obviously, when couples are
apart, there are all sorts of tempta
tions," he said. "I think fidelity,
monogamy and whatnot are really
challenging because you get lonely
and you're in these environments
with all sorts of other options, par
ticularly young people in the social
environment of the university."
Because stress, insecurities and
temptations abound in the college
setting, long distance couples, natu
rally, have a higher risk of relation
ship failure than the average cou
ple,
"Relationships always fail over
the failure to resolve conflict, and
anything that makes conflict reso
lution more difficult, like lack
of proximity, is going to make
it more likely to fail over the
inevitable kinds of conflicts
that arise," he said. "I think
the key to making a long dis
tance relationship work is
setting realistic expectations

rather than extraordinary unrealis
tic ones. If you set the bar too high,
you're going to be constantly disap
pointed."
However, Levenson believes
that there are some eventual bene

fits to maintaining a long distance
relationship.
"The reunions, looking forward
to seeing each other, are the poten
tial glue of keeping this type of rela
tionship together," he said.

According to Annie Osborn 'l4,
whose roommate is in a long dis
tance relationship, these relation
ships seems like an added anxiety in
a college student's already demand
ing life.
"In general, my friends in long
distance relationships seem slightly
more stressed than my friends in
non-long distance relationships,"
she said. "I think that with a long
distance relationship there are in
herent questions of trust and intent,
and I think that any ties that you
have with somebody back home re
quires an extra amount of energy
and effort to maintain."
But for Casals, the extra energy
required in maintaining his rela
tionship is a small price to pay.
"It's worth it when you know
that you're coming home to some
body," he said. "It's like a breath of
fresh air."

It's a common sight to see
Stanford couples holding
hands in the quad or cuddling
up next to each other while
sharing a hot chocolate at the
CoHo. But what about those stu
dents whose sweethearts are more
than a five or 10-minute bike ride
away?
According to The Center for the
Study of Long Distance Relation
ships, there are an estimated 4 to 4.5
million college couples in the Unit
ed States that are involved in a long
distance relationship. Long distance
relationships suggest a mixed bag of
emotional experiences weeks,
perhaps months, of being apart,
finding gushy love letters sent via
snail mail in your mailbox and of
course, the eventual, ultimately
gratifying reunions. But that's not
all there is to it.
Ginny Scholtes 'l3 and her
boyfriend, Murphy, have been to
gether for two years and seven
months. They met while both attend
ing Laguna Hills High School in La
guna Hills, Calif, when they were
members of the swim and water polo
teams. For Scholtes, the idea of
breaking up with her long-time
boyfriend never crossed her mind.
"We just couldn't break up," she
recalled with a smile.
Despite her faith in their rela
tionship, Scholtes said that the
stress of being in a long distance re
lationship did affect her life as a
Stanford student.
"It's very hard to deal with trying
to balance two different lives, be
cause in away you can't be fully in
either one," she said. "No matter
where you are, you're missing a part
of yourself all the time."
In order to keep up the spark in
their relationship, Scholtes fre
quently Skyped and exchanged let
ters with her boyfriend.
However, the relationship put a
strain on her social life at Stanford.
"I like going out and I love danc
ing, but for the first two quarters of
my freshman year, I wouldn't go
out," she said. "Before spring quar
