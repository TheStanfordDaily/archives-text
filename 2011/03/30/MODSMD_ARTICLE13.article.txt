## WANDERLUST A 						snobby way of being polite on an airplane 
### Johnny Bartz 
I often wonder why I'm always so
inspired to write when I'm sit
ting on an airplane. As I head
home this weekend for a breath of
cool Minnesota air and some fabu
lous (and free!) home-cooked
meals, I have this constant reminder
shaking me of why I should be po
lite on an airplane. I wonder why on
earth the person behind me keeps
banging on my seatback. Maybe we
all need a bit of a reminder of flying
etiquette.
At the airport, be courteous to
airline personnel and TSA repre
sentatives. It is not they who are
personally deciding to charge you a
baggage fee or arbitrarily not per
mitting you to carry on that fifth of
vodka. Also, they did not cause you
to arrive late to the airport, nor
should they care for your irrespon
sibility. So, even if you're frustrated
about something at the beginning of
your travel journey, don't take it out
on them.
In terms of baggage, it's courte
ous to the passengers waiting in line
behind you if you make sure your
baggage is not overweight prior to
arriving at the airport. If you do
have a lot of baggage however,
please just (wo)man up and pay the
baggage fee they are just going
to make you check that huge roller
board at the gate anyway.
While you brave your way
through security, prepare in ad
vance by putting valuables or metal
objects inside your carry-ons. Wear
slip on shoes for ease of security
screening. Don't push yourself for
ward, but move as quickly and effi
ciently as possible, just as you would
appreciate others to do in front of
you.
When you get to the gate area,
it's rude to talk loudly on your
phone. If you must have a conversa
tion, take it somewhere where there
aren't other people around who
may be trying to read or finish up a
bit of work before the flight begins.
One of my biggest pet peeves is
when people bring stinky food on
the airplane. I don't care what it is
when confined inside a metal
tube with re-circulating air, just
about any kind of food has a smell. I
either dislike it and feel nauseated
or like it and want some. So leave
your eating to the food courts on
the ground. Lastly, be sure you use
the restroom before you get on the
plane, "Lavs" are only for peeing in
my opinion, and should be avoided
at all costs if possible.
A note on interactions with gate
agents: they're busy, so unless you
have to check-in for a connecting
flight or some other actual service,
don't bother them. Almost all infor-

mation, including upgrade and
standby information, is present on
overhead screens. The agent will
call your name if they need to talk
to you. If you're one of those "I'll
just flirt my way into first class"
types, think again, unless you know
how to flirt with a computer. All up
grades are handled electronically,
weighing in elite status, fare paid,
seniority, etc., so unless you're gen
uinely flirting with a cute agent,
don't bother.
When about to board, don't be
one of those people who blocks the
line before their boarding zone has
been called. It's usually pretty easy
to predict the order of boarding
and by predictable I mean it's al
ways the same. During pre-boarding
elderly passengers needing assis
tance and families with children
under the age of five are permitted
to board.Then comes first class. You
should know if you're in first class,
but if you're unsure and your ticket
doesn't say something like "First
Class" or "Business Elite" then
you're not allowed to board yet.
Then come elite members, followed
by and this is the kicker zones
in ascending numerical order. So, if
you have a big number four on your
boarding pass, don't line up when
they call zone one for boarding.
There actually is a method behind
the madness, and contrary to what
some may think, if you have a seat
assignment, it will still be there re
gardless of when you board the
plane. If you're worried about over
head bin space, your carry-on is
probably too big. Gate checking it
to your final destination is not the

you to arrive late to

should they care for
your irresponsibility

end of the world.
On the plane, flash a smile, say a
quick hello to the crew and take
your seat. Turn off electronics in ad
vance, pay attention to crew mem
ber instructions and overall just
keep quiet. It's courteous to have
your seat upright during beverage
and meal service, and don't hog the
armrests. Keep your seatbelt buck

led during flight for your safety and
the safety of others if the plane
loses altitude quickly you don't
want to break your neck on the ceil
ing. Flying should be relaxing, so
keep your conversations quiet and
forget about that loud obnoxious
laugh (culpable).
And lastly, don't ever push on
the seatback in front of you it's
just really annoying. Happy flying!

Do you have any really annoying
stories about passengers on a plane?

I often wonder why I'm always so
inspired to write when I'm sit
ting on an airplane. As I head
home this weekend for a breath of
cool Minnesota air and some fabu
lous (and free!) home-cooked
meals, I have this constant reminder
shaking me of why I should be po
lite on an airplane. I wonder why on
earth the person behind me keeps
banging on my seatback. Maybe we
all need a bit of a reminder of flying
etiquette.
At the airport, be courteous to
airline personnel and TSA repre
sentatives. It is not they who are
personally deciding to charge you a
baggage fee or arbitrarily not per
mitting you to carry on that fifth of
vodka. Also, they did not cause you
to arrive late to the airport, nor
should they care for your irrespon
sibility. So, even if you're frustrated
about something at the beginning of
your travel journey, don't take it out
on them.
In terms of baggage, it's courte
ous to the passengers waiting in line
behind you if you make sure your
baggage is not overweight prior to
arriving at the airport. If you do
have a lot of baggage however,
please just (wo)man up and pay the
baggage fee they are just going
to make you check that huge roller
board at the gate anyway.
While you brave your way
through security, prepare in ad
vance by putting valuables or metal
objects inside your carry-ons. Wear
slip on shoes for ease of security
screening. Don't push yourself for
ward, but move as quickly and effi
ciently as possible, just as you would
appreciate others to do in front of
you.
When you get to the gate area,
it's rude to talk loudly on your
phone. If you must have a conversa
tion, take it somewhere where there
aren't other people around who
may be trying to read or finish up a
bit of work before the flight begins.
One of my biggest pet peeves is
when people bring stinky food on
the airplane. I don't care what it is
when confined inside a metal
tube with re-circulating air, just
about any kind of food has a smell. I
either dislike it and feel nauseated
or like it and want some. So leave
your eating to the food courts on
the ground. Lastly, be sure you use
the restroom before you get on the
plane, "Lavs" are only for peeing in
my opinion, and should be avoided
at all costs if possible.
A note on interactions with gate
agents: they're busy, so unless you
have to check-in for a connecting
flight or some other actual service,
don't bother them. Almost all infor-

mation, including upgrade and
standby information, is present on
overhead screens. The agent will
call your name if they need to talk
to you. If you're one of those "I'll
just flirt my way into first class"
types, think again, unless you know
how to flirt with a computer. All up
grades are handled electronically,
weighing in elite status, fare paid,
seniority, etc., so unless you're gen
uinely flirting with a cute agent,
don't bother.
When about to board, don't be
one of those people who blocks the
line before their boarding zone has
been called. It's usually pretty easy
to predict the order of boarding
and by predictable I mean it's al
ways the same. During pre-boarding
elderly passengers needing assis
tance and families with children
under the age of five are permitted
to board.Then comes first class. You
should know if you're in first class,
but if you're unsure and your ticket
doesn't say something like "First
Class" or "Business Elite" then
you're not allowed to board yet.
Then come elite members, followed
by and this is the kicker zones
in ascending numerical order. So, if
you have a big number four on your
boarding pass, don't line up when
they call zone one for boarding.
There actually is a method behind
the madness, and contrary to what
some may think, if you have a seat
assignment, it will still be there re
gardless of when you board the
plane. If you're worried about over
head bin space, your carry-on is
probably too big. Gate checking it
to your final destination is not the

They didn't cause

your irresponsibility

end of the world.
On the plane, flash a smile, say a
quick hello to the crew and take
your seat. Turn off electronics in ad
vance, pay attention to crew mem
ber instructions and overall just
keep quiet. It's courteous to have
your seat upright during beverage
and meal service, and don't hog the
armrests. Keep your seatbelt buck

led during flight for your safety and
the safety of others if the plane
loses altitude quickly you don't
want to break your neck on the ceil
ing. Flying should be relaxing, so
keep your conversations quiet and
forget about that loud obnoxious
laugh (culpable).
And lastly, don't ever push on
the seatback in front of you it's
just really annoying. Happy flying!
