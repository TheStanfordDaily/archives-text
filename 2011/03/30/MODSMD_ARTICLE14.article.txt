# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Op-Ed Response: 
### 
Dear Editor,
As an Asian American alum,
former co-chair of the Asian Amer
ican Students' Association
(AASA), staff member of the
Asian American Community Cen
ter (A3C), Ethnic Theme Associate
for Okada and member of Lambda
Phi Epsilon, I am disappointed in
the ignorance and oversimplifica
tion displayed by Mr. Matsuura in
his op-ed.
I agree that the Asian American
community should "be a resource
for us to explore our Asian Ameri
can identity." However, I strongly
disagree with his contention that
this exploration should be confined
to "education and justice." The idea
of how Asian Americans are devel
oping an identity is enormously
complex there is an entire devel
oping field of study devoted to this:
Asian American Studies.
Although cultural groups play
an essential role in education, it is
foolish to completely disregard the
contributions of social groups. "Cul
tural" groups are able to host non
cultural events and "social" organi
zations are able to host non-social
events. AASA hosts an annual con
cert and the Lambdas hold typing
drives to increase the number of un
derrepresented minorities in the
national bone marrow registry.
Both of these events draw the com
munity together, but take radically
different methodologies. No single
group can completely address an
issue as multifaceted as the Asian
American identity.
I found it particularly disap
pointing that Matsuura stereo
typed the Asian Greeks as mem
bers of a "glorified social club

where people look the same" by
sweepingly accusing members of
being ignorant. If he had looked
more closely, he would have seen
that the Asian Greeks are among
the most active in leading other cul
tural organizations, but this is be
side the point.
Being a part of the Asian Amer
ican interest fraternity, I witnessed
our brothers' struggle together to
figure out what our identity means
for ourselves. I learned much more
about the Korean and Vietnamese
cultures through social interaction
than I ever did at any conference.
These interactions helped me
shape what aspects of my own eth
nic culture I have chosen to em
brace and integrate with parts of
my American culture, and there
fore what I believe it means to be
Asian American.
Each Asian American affiliated
group from AAS A to Sanskriti,
to the Greeks, to Team HB V, to the
numerous others has a distinc
tive role in contributing to our com
munity. We hold protests to end in
justices to Stanford workers, host
conferences to help immigrant high
school students attend college and
hold informal discussions explain
ing different customs and what they
mean. As groups explore the ideas
of race and ethnicity with different,
yet valid approaches, they do not
and certainly should not conform
to any one person's definition of
identity.
It is important for the Asian
American and greater Stanford
community to realize that the most
basic purpose of any group is for its
members to grow. I implore every
body to reconsider ways to improve
our communities on the Farm
rather than laying the blame onto
one another.
