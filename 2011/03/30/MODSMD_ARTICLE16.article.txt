# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## The
						Devil in the Details 
### Rachel Kolb 
On my desk, beside stacks of
books and pencils, sits a
small piece of paper with a
quote written on it. It says: "Try to
be one of the people on whom noth
ing is lost." It's from Henry James,
and I first stumbled across it in a
creative writing class a few quarters
ago. I took it as good advice then,
but occasionally while working I'll
glance up and see it and a heart
thudding question will flash across
my mind: as I progress through life,
how many details are being lost on
me?
Trying to be one of the people on
whom nothing (or at least, very lit
tle) is lost, I think, is part of what
many of us seek from our educa
tion. Yes, when considering Henry
James's literary prowess, his words
seem directed toward writers
and, yes, when I think of them I im
mediately visualize a serious-faced
author jotting down notes in his
journal, trying to verbally describe
as many miniscule life details as
possible. But these words can also
apply to a medical practitioner try
ing to decipher a complex set of
symptoms to make a diagnosis, or a
lawyer or policymaker reading
through the specifics of a case file or
document. In all of these fields, and
indeed in the entire realm of acade
mia, attentiveness to detail be
comes an essential skill. And, in that
light, becoming "one of the people
on whom nothing is lost" can sound
like a very attractive life goal.
Indeed, the farther along we
progress in our educations, the
more detail-oriented our school
work can require us to become. To
cite another writing-related exam
ple, remember those general five
paragraph essays that were empha
sized in middle and high school cur
ricula? That simple, straightforward
structure served us well enough in
those days, but now it does not lend
itself well to the more complex ar
guments that we develop in our
later years of education, in which
paragraphs, sentences, and even
words start functioning at the level
of nuance. Formal learning, in many
ways, is like wading deeper into a
mire: to alter a common adage, the

more you discover, the less you feel
like you know, and the harder it is to
conceptualize what the big picture
looks like.
We want nothing to be lost on us,
yet details can act as their own set of
blinders. "Failing to see the forest
for the trees" would be an appropri
ate phrase to describe the stereo
type of academics that I have en
countered outside of Stanford, a
stereotype that describes individu
als stuck in trivialities that do not
matter to anyone besides the fanat
ics already immersed in that field.
The oft-maligned "Stanford bub
ble," perhaps, is an extension (or
maybe only a relative?) of this aca
demic stereotype. Described in
these terms, the bubble mindset is
simply this: we commit ourselves to
missing out on none of the details of
campus life, all while the broader
world zooms by.
Losing ourselves in the details of
a particular lifestyle can be reassur
ing, but I doubt that simply pouring

energy into paying attention to
minutiae is what Henry James
meant. For one thing, none of us
would be able to sustain such a
mindset for very long. Our lives
would become choked up by clut
ter, and how many of those details
would end up being important any
way? Being a truly perceptive per
son seems to require a sort of dou
ble vision, a mindset flexible
enough to grasp particulars and si
multaneously see how they fit into
the larger picture.
How to become this sort of per
ceptive, dual-minded person is
something that I often ponder. For
reasons other than the campus bub
ble, it is something that can be diffi
cult to achieve at Stanford, or any
place where we must live life at an
accelerated pace. What larger
world reflection do we have time
for? We bustle through our activi
ties and our coursework, however
irrelevant these spheres of our lives
seem to each other. We drift in and
out of disconnected groups of
friends. We apply for various pro
grams, grants, honors, trying to con
nect the dots and make them relate
to each other. We take advantage of
our youthful ability to be sponta
neous. And then we step back from
all of these details, the details that
compose the daily rhythm of our
lives, and try to figure out how it all
fits. From my standpoint, I don't
often know.
The crux, I believe, of attaining
the broader perceptiveness that
Henry James speaks of, the percep
tiveness that is at the heart of a well
utilized education, is to retain our
sense of curiosity and open-mind
edness about all people and all sub
jects. Of course, committing our
selves to grasping everything in the
world is an unattainable goal, but it
is an energizing one nevertheless.
That is, as long as we don't misun
derstand and let the details sneak
up on us. Not all of them, though.
Just the unimportant ones.
