# Go Thunderchickens!
## 
### 
Dear Editor,
I am a long-time fan of Stanford
sports ( almost from the Frankie Al-

Bert days), and wonder if it isn't time
to revisit the "Thunderchicken" de
bacle. Years ago, when it was deemed
politically incorrect to be "Indians,"
the Stanford student body, in its mar
velously irreverent manner (not un
like Aussies, I might note), voted to
become the "Thunderchickens." So
Stanford! For some idiotic reason,
the administration nixed the notion
and you became a color. Ugh. How
bland and uninspiring. Rise up Stan
ford students and alums and reclaim
your proper destiny... as THUN
DERCHICKENS!
