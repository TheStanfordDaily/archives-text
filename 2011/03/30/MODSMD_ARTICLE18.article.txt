## AN UGLY WIN 
### JACK DUANE 
Stanford baseball survived
two furious St. Mary's rallies in
the 7th and 9th innings last night
to pull out a 16-14 victory in the
last game of its pre-season.
On a chilly night, the No. 11
Cardinal scored early and often,
but struggled to keep the Gaels
(9-12) off the bases. Stanford
racked up 19 hits and commit
ted 6 errors in a wacky game at
Sunken Diamond.

Senior pitcher Danny
Sandbrink gave Stanford (11-6)
three shutout innings in his first
start of the season and left the
game with a 5-0 lead.
The Cardinal was paced by
freshman second baseman
Lonni Kauppila's four hits and
the defense of sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty.
Piscotty ended the Gaels
threat in the 6th inning with an
impressive charging put-out to
first on a slow rolling bunt and
again in the 7th inning with a
diving, unassisted put-out at
third base.
The Gaels didn't hit the ball
hard all night, but after Sand
brink's departure, they seemed
to find every gap.
Junior pitcher A.J. Talt per
formed well in relief for three
innings, but got himself into
trouble in the 7th. Stanford's
disaster inning began when Talt
hit Markus Melgosa and Cole
Norton with pitches. The dam
age was compounded when
Donald Collins reached on a

bunt.
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess, who was resting his
front-line pitchers for the upcom
ing series with Washington State,
brought in junior pitcher Elliot
Byers with a 9-2 lead and the bases
loaded for only his second appear
ance of the season.
Byers appeared to be up for the
task when he struck out pinch hit
ter Richard Boas, but after that the
runs began to pour in. The Gaels
ended up scoring seven runs in the
inning on four hits.
The inning was prolonged by a
misjudged bloop single which
barely sailed into right center field
over Kauppila's outstretched arms
and an error by the shortstop
Diekroeger.
"I took a false step," Kauppila
said of the ball that got over his
head. "It got caught in the wind
and barely got past me."
Sophomore pitcher Sahil
Bloom came into the game to get

the final out of the inning and the
Cardinal found itself locked in a
tight 10-9 ballgame.
Kaupilla avenged his misplay
in the top of the inning with an
RBI single in the bottom of the
seventh.
"Baseball is a game of luck,"
Kaupilla said. "Luck was in my
favor today. It was nice to give the
team a little bit of a breather in
that situation."
The six-run rally was punctuat
ed by a two-run homer off the bat
of senior DH Ben Clowe.
With the game seemingly secure
going into the ninth inning, the
Cardinal defense stumbled, com
mitting four errors and allowing
the Gaels to put up five runs.
Marquess brought in experienced
junior Scott Snodgress to close it
out. Snodgress struck out Tim
David to secure his second save of
the season and end a game that the
Cardinal was lucky to win and will
be happy to put in the past.
The Cardinal begins its Pac-10
slate this Friday against Washing
ton State in Pullman, Wash.

Stanford baseball survived
two furious St. Mary's rallies in
the 7th and 9th innings last night
to pull out a 16-14 victory in the
last game of its pre-season.
On a chilly night, the No. 11
Cardinal scored early and often,
but struggled to keep the Gaels
(9-12) off the bases. Stanford
racked up 19 hits and commit
ted 6 errors in a wacky game at
Sunken Diamond.

Senior pitcher Danny
Sandbrink gave Stanford (11-6)
three shutout innings in his first
start of the season and left the
game with a 5-0 lead.
The Cardinal was paced by
freshman second baseman
Lonni Kauppila's four hits and
the defense of sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty.
Piscotty ended the Gaels
threat in the 6th inning with an
impressive charging put-out to
first on a slow rolling bunt and
again in the 7th inning with a
diving, unassisted put-out at
third base.
The Gaels didn't hit the ball
hard all night, but after Sand
brink's departure, they seemed
to find every gap.
Junior pitcher A.J. Talt per
formed well in relief for three
innings, but got himself into
trouble in the 7th. Stanford's
disaster inning began when Talt
hit Markus Melgosa and Cole
Norton with pitches. The dam
age was compounded when

bunt.
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess, who was resting his
front-line pitchers for the upcom
ing series with Washington State,
brought in junior pitcher Elliot
Byers with a 9-2 lead and the bases
loaded for only his second appear
ance of the season.
Byers appeared to be up for the
task when he struck out pinch hit
ter Richard Boas, but after that the
runs began to pour in. The Gaels
ended up scoring seven runs in the
inning on four hits.
The inning was prolonged by a
misjudged bloop single which
barely sailed into right center field
over Kauppila's outstretched arms
and an error by the shortstop
Diekroeger.
"I took a false step," Kauppila
said of the ball that got over his
head. "It got caught in the wind
and barely got past me."
Sophomore pitcher Sahil
Bloom came into the game to get

the final out of the inning and the
Cardinal found itself locked in a
tight 10-9 ballgame.
Kaupilla avenged his misplay
in the top of the inning with an
RBI single in the bottom of the
seventh.
"Baseball is a game of luck,"
Kaupilla said. "Luck was in my
favor today. It was nice to give the
team a little bit of a breather in
that situation."
The six-run rally was punctuat
ed by a two-run homer off the bat
of senior DH Ben Clowe.
With the game seemingly secure
going into the ninth inning, the
Cardinal defense stumbled, com
mitting four errors and allowing
the Gaels to put up five runs.
Marquess brought in experienced
junior Scott Snodgress to close it
out. Snodgress struck out Tim
David to secure his second save of
the season and end a game that the
Cardinal was lucky to win and will
be happy to put in the past.
The Cardinal begins its Pac-10
slate this Friday against Washing
ton State in Pullman, Wash.
