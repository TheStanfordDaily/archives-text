Stanford baseball survived
two furious St. Mary's rallies in
the 7th and 9th innings last night
to pull out a 16-14 victory in the
last game of its pre-season.

Cardinal scored early and often,

(9-12) off the bases. Stanford
racked up 19 hits and commit

Sunken Diamond.

Senior pitcher Danny
Sandbrink gave Stanford (11-6)
three shutout innings in his first
start of the season and left the
game with a 5-0 lead.
The Cardinal was paced by

Lonni Kauppila's four hits and
the defense of sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty.
Piscotty ended the Gaels
threat in the 6th inning with an
impressive charging put-out to
first on a slow rolling bunt and
again in the 7th inning with a
diving, unassisted put-out at
third base.

hard all night, but after Sand
brink's departure, they seemed
to find every gap.
Junior pitcher A.J. Talt per
formed well in relief for three

disaster inning began when Talt
hit Markus Melgosa and Cole
Norton with pitches. The dam
age was compounded when
Donald Collins reached on a
