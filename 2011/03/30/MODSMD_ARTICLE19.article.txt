# Go coach the men, Geno!

By now, most followers of
women's college basket
ball are familiar with
Geno Auriemma's out
burst criticizing the fans
of his UConn team for not showing
up in bigger numbers to the team's
games in the first two rounds of the
NCAA Tournament, held at the
school's Storrs, Conn, campus.
Auriemma took issue with the
fact that less than 6,000 fans showed
up to watch the Huskies mercilessly
pummel their first two opponents,
saying that they were "spoiled" and
that they just assumed that the team
would be going to the Final Four.
Here's a newsflash for you, Geno:
it's not a terribly unreasonable as
sumption that UConn, winners of
the last two NCAA titles and 112 of
its last 113 games, will breeze
through the first two rounds of the
tournament. UConn is just that
good, and Auriemma deserves plen
ty of credit for making that the case.
However, this column isn't a dia
tribe about the abject lack of parity
in the women's game, with a handful
of elite programs (led by UConn,
Stanford and Tennessee) lording it
over the rest. Rather, I think it's high
time that Geno Auriemma took his
talents to the men's game.
For starters, let's be realistic: the
women's game will not approach the
same level of fan passion and inter

est as the men's game any time soon,
especially when March Madness
rolls around. I'm not trying to be sex
ist or claiming that men's basketball
is somehow intrinsically better than
women's basketball. For whatever
reason, fans (and the networks and
TV dollars that follow them) would
much sooner tune in to a men's
game than a women's game, and I'd
bet my last dollar that, if the UConn
men ever hosted an NCAA Tourna
ment game as a top seed, that the
arena in Storrs would be standing
room only.
Because of this disparity, Auriem
ma should either quit whining or go
where the fans are and coach a men's
team. Based on past experience, he's
not going to quit whining anytime
soon he made similar statements
when UConn was chasing the record
for consecutive victories set by John
Wooden's UCLA teams. Geno is like
that annoying kid on the playground

who will do anything to get attention,
and when he doesn't get the same
recognition and appreciation as
men's basketball programs, he goes
and cries to the media about it.
So the obvious solution is then to
follow the TV cameras and head to
the men's game. Though I can't think
of an example of a women's coach
making the jump to the men's game,
I don't see any reason why it should
n't be possible; after all, it's the same
sport. Given his astounding success
at UConn, some coach-needy men's
team out there would certainly hire
him (Tennessee would have been an
ideal landing place). Auriemma's
team would get all the media atten
tion that he so clearly craves, and he
would never again have reason to
complain that winning didn't bring
the fans out in droves.
I have to admit that a selfish part
of me wants this to happen just so I
can watch Auriemma's histrionics
when his team hits the inevitable
rough stretch. Geno hasn't had to
deal with too much criticism of his
coaching after all, how do you
criticize a guy who's lost one game
out of his last 113? Yet, he still ap-

pears to think that what he's facing is
too much, saying (sarcastically) that
he should let fans "guest coach" a
quarter at a time.
Just think about it: if he's this en
tertaining and sardonic when he's
outrageously successful, what is it
going to look like when he's in the
middle of a four-game losing streak?
When his team gets bounced from
the tournament in the Sweet 16?
When he takes to the podium to an
nounce that Fictional U. has accept
ed a bid to the NIT?
Of course, there's always the pos
sibility that Auriemma achieves the
same heights in the men's game as
he has in his tenure on the women's
sideline in Storrs. If that happens, I
will immensely regret the day I
wrote this column, as I watch the col
lective sports media slide inexorably
into the orbit of his gigantic ego.

Kabir Sawhney wants Geno Auriem
ma and Pat Summit to both coach at
the same school. He also forgot that
he is not writing for the Connecticut's
newspaper, The Daily Campus. Re

that annoying kid on the playground

who will do anything to get attention,
and when he doesn't get the same
recognition and appreciation as
men's basketball programs, he goes
and cries to the media about it.
So the obvious solution is then to
follow the TV cameras and head to
the men's game. Though I can't think
of an example of a women's coach
making the jump to the men's game,
I don't see any reason why it should
n't be possible; after all, it's the same
sport. Given his astounding success
at UConn, some coach-needy men's
team out there would certainly hire
him (Tennessee would have been an
ideal landing place). Auriemma's
team would get all the media atten
tion that he so clearly craves, and he
would never again have reason to
complain that winning didn't bring
the fans out in droves.
I have to admit that a selfish part
of me wants this to happen just so I
can watch Auriemma's histrionics
when his team hits the inevitable
rough stretch. Geno hasn't had to
deal with too much criticism of his
coaching after all, how do you
criticize a guy who's lost one game
out of his last 113? Yet, he still ap-

pears to think that what he's facing is
too much, saying (sarcastically) that
he should let fans "guest coach" a
quarter at a time.
Just think about it: if he's this en
tertaining and sardonic when he's
outrageously successful, what is it
going to look like when he's in the
middle of a four-game losing streak?
When his team gets bounced from
the tournament in the Sweet 16?
When he takes to the podium to an
nounce that Fictional U. has accept
ed a bid to the NIT?
Of course, there's always the pos
sibility that Auriemma achieves the
same heights in the men's game as
he has in his tenure on the women's
sideline in Storrs. If that happens, I
will immensely regret the day I
wrote this column, as I watch the col
lective sports media slide inexorably
into the orbit of his gigantic ego.

Kabir Sawhney wants Geno Auriem
ma and Pat Summit to both coach at
the same school. He also forgot that
he is not writing for the Connecticut's
newspaper, The Daily Campus. Re
mind him of his true (Cardinal) col
ors at ksawhney@stanford.edu.
