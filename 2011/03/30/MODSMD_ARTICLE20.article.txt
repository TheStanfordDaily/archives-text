## Women best Brown in midweek matchup 
### REBECCA HANLEY 
Stanford women's lacrosse over
came some occasional missteps in
its offensive execution yesterday af
ternoon, hanging on for a 12-8 win
in its midweek game against Brown
at Cagan Stadium. Senior Sarah
Flynn led Stanford (9-1,1-0 MPSF)
with four goals and senior Annie
Read had six saves in the Cardinal
net.
Although the No. 9 Cardinal
seemed to struggle on offense at
times, its defense held Brown (5-3,
1-1 Ivy League) to single digits on
the scoreboard and led the team to
victory.

Early on in the game, both
teams traded goals back-and-forth.
Cardinal seniors Karen Nesbitt,
Leslie Foard and Lauren Schmidt
put Card on the board, but Brown
fired right back to tie it up at 3-3
with 17:50 left in the first half.
With 13:51 left to play before
halftime, senior Sarah Flynn started
a 4-0 scoring streak for Stanford.
