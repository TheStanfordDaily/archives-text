fensive contributions with a pair of
goals, while junior two-meter de
fender Monica Coughlan tallied her
third goal of the season in the first

tending as Oland tallied five saves
for the Cardinal, holding the Bruins
to only two goals, both coming from

Alexis Lee, above, and the Stanford women's water polo team are off to a
remarkable start this season. The Cardinal squad is 18-0 after three more
wins over Spring Break. Stanford's next match is a challenge: a visit to USC.
Just 18 hours later, the Card
played another match against a
non-conference opponent. No. 15
UC-Davis. Despite the quick turn
around, the team still got off to a
quick start, taking a 5-1 first period
advantage. Stanford took a 9-2 ad
vantage into halftime and finished
with a 12-6 victory.
The Aggies had no answer for
Dries and Lo, who each tallied four

goals. Baldoni and Oland notched
seven and six saves respectively.
With another three strong out
ings, the Cardinal kept its 18-game
winning streak alive. However, ar
guably one of its hardest tests of
the season will be this upcoming
weekend as the team heads to
use.
The squad will face reigning na
tional champion No. 3 USC for the
third time this season on Saturday.
Stanford is scheduled to face No. 13
