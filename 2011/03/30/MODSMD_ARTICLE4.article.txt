# Trust needed online
## NYU professor explores Internet privacy challenges 
### PATRICIA HO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Helen Nissenbaum, professor of media, cul
ture and communication at New York Univer
sity, discussed online privacy and its challenges
in her talk, "Why privacy online is different,
and why it isn't," on Tuesday at the Law School.
Hosted by the Stanford Center for Internet
and Society, Nissenbaum's presentation fo
cused on the notion of a transparent privacy
policy in which users can choose to give per
mission to providing information online,
called "notice and consent."
Nissenbaum described the growing online
environment as a competitive marketplace for
information, in which people are able to en
gage freely with limited interference by third
parties such as government regulators. This
environment requires flexibility and innova
tion to maintain its growth and can be puzzling
to comprehend.
"The online environment provides new
types of information that we haven't been
used to engaging with," Nissenbaum said.
"Sometimes we just aren't sure of how to work
with this kind of information."
Other factors that underlie privacy prob
lems and accompany the growth of online
communication include new types of actors
the subjects and recipients of information.
There are also different modes of capture and
distribution of information. Unlike spoken
communication, there is no longer a "clear re
ciprocal flow of information" between speak
ers, Nissenbaum said.
A primary limitation of notice and consent,
Nissenbaum argued, is the existence of a trans
parency paradox. Given that privacy policies
are generally extremely abstruse and contain
several loopholes, they are not an effective
reference for the average user to determine
exactly how their information will be main
tained and kept private.
Nissenbaum cited a personal anecdote of
her own experiences in healthcare as an exam
ple. When she was asked to sign off on a med
ical consent form regarding insurance for a
surgery, she did not read the entirety of the
medical consent form and instead relied on
her trust in her caretaker.

"What I think is missing from transparency
and consent is . .. unless we can build this
sense of trust and great understanding of this
relationship, we can't rest everything on this
concept of transparency and consent," Nis
senbaum said.
Second year law student Dennys Antonial
li, who attended the talk, said he found Nis
senbaum's ideas particularly engaging be
cause of his long-term interest in online priva

cy and his familiarity with her work. Antonial
li appreciated Nissenbaum's unique perspec
tive on the issue and her treatment of its many
challenges.
"It's always useful to be confronted with
new ideas for a better framework," Antonialli
said. "[Her talk] identified a real, serious prob
lem and it certainly has the potential for at

least making a more informed de
cision about online privacy."
Concluding her talk, Nis
senbaum recommended alterna
tives on how society can handle
the challenges of online privacy.
Ultimately, there is still a role for
informed consent. But given that
the online world is highly hetero
geneous and thickly integrated

with social life, it is necessary to
conduct a comparative evalua
tion to determine how these chal
lenges affect core values of free
dom and autonomy, Nissenbaum
said.
"We should write out substan
tive rules of expectation that gov
ern the flow of information in
those cases," Nissenbaum said.
"We have a lot of knowledge
about social life and we can bring
it to our benefit," she added.
