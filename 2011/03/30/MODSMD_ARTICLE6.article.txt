## Stanford prepared for potential big earthquake 
### JENNY THAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Tohoku earthquake, which
struck the northeast coast of Hon
shu, Japan on March 11 and trig
gered a 23-foot tsunami, is not
only a tragedy in and of itself, but
a grim reminder for seismologists
and scientists that earthquakes
are one of the most dangerous
natural disasters out there, ac
cording to Stanford researchers.
Based on geological records
and written historical accounts,
Japanese seismologists anticipat
ed earthquake magnitudes from
7.0 to 8.0 from the Japan Trench.
The resulting 9.0 earthquake re
veals that despite the wealth of
seismic data that has been collect

ed over the years, earthquakes are
capricious events.
"Earthquakes don't happen on
a schedule," said geophysics pro
fessor Greg Beroza. "They're not
only unpredictable, the onset is
extremely rapid."
Stanford is not invulnerable to
these quakes. The two nearest
faults that pose the greatest threat
to Stanford are the San Andreas
and Hayward faults. Although the
San Andreas Fault is closer to
Stanford, Stanford seismologists
are more concerned about the
Hayward fault, which, according
to geophysics professor Paul
Segall, is reaching the end of its av
erage fault slip cycle of 140 years.
Segall is currently tackling the
difficulty of measuring earth

quake occurrence by studying
crustal deformation and fault me
chanics by using precise GPS
measurements to measure distor
tions created by the accumulated
stress of faults locking together
due to friction. Earthquakes occur
when the stress of the faults over
comes the friction of the locked
plates.
"Take the Hayward fault, the
fault that runs directly under
Berkeley," Segall said. "The aver
age distance the fault should move
is about one centimeter per year.
The Hayward fault hasn't slipped
since 1868, so about 140 years. If
you multiply 140 years times one
centimeter, you need over a
meter's worth of slip."
These measurements, however

precise, need to be taken with a
grain of salt. Segall cautioned
against viewing the average cycle
calculations as rigid, accurate pre
dictions of seismic activity.
"Just because the average is
140 years doesn't mean it's going
to happen exactly at that average
time," Segall said. "There is a
range of variability, which makes
prediction rather difficult. How
ever, what geological studies can
give us is information that lets us
know that there is a higher possi
bility of an earthquake happen
ing."
According to Segall, an earth
quake of a magnitude comparable
to that of Japan's is highly unlike-
ly for the San Andreas Fault.
"Even the San Andreas cannot
produce a 9.0 earthquake, but a 7.0
to 8.0 at most," Segall said. "But the
Cascadia subduction zone
which extends from Canada to
northern California can poten
tially reach a magnitude of nine."
This news bodes well for Stan
ford, which, over the years, has un
dergone a rigorous seismic retro
fitting for vulnerable buildings. All
new buildings, including the Knight
Management Center, have been
carefully constructed to withstand
earthquakes.
"The Knight building uses a
buckling restrain brace, a new type
of system developed 10 to 15 years
ago," said Greg Deierlein, a civil and
environmental engineering profes
sor. "The brace structure helps the
building during compression to re
sist buckling. The new Bio-E build
ing will also have this brace."
The department of Environ
mental Health & Safety (EHS)
works with Stanford's seismologists
to develop measures to ensure cam
pus safety.
"What Stanford has done over
many years is to really try to com
bine preparedness with what we
know about the possibility of seis
mic activity in the area and attempt
to mitigate as many risks as possi
ble," wrote Lawrence Gibbs, EHS
associate vice provost, in an email
to The Daily.
"These include seismic retro
fitting of many of our buildings,
adding emergency generators to
many buildings to ensure power
availability [and] ensuring emer
gency food and water supplies are
available," he said.
Other measures that the depart
ment has taken include the installa
tion of fire sprinkler systems in all
undergraduate housing residences
and most laboratories, automatic
seismic gas shutoffs and emergency
warning and communication sys
tems. It also ensured that data back
up systems are available to protect
critical information. More recently,
a program to provide for non-struc
tural restraints on high value re

search equipment has been pro
posed.
"People's perceptions of earth
quakes are often of buildings falling
or collapsing completely," said
Mary-Lou Zoback, vice president
of Earthquake Risk Applications at
Risk Management Solutions, a
local risk assessment consulting
group.
"However, most of the damage
that people don't generally think
about is the shaking and disruption
of the building's contents," she
added. "Lab materials and equip
ment can be damaged, data can be
lost."
While the proactive measures
implemented can sufficiently help
Stanford withstand up to a 7.5
quake from the San Andreas Fault,
earthquake researchers and staff
emphasize the importance of main
taining vigilance in building inspec
tions and earthquake safety educa
tion.
"Stanford's preparedness is
based on the probability that an
earthquake would impact the
whole region," Gibbs said. "Stan
ford needs to be able to be self suf
ficient in the immediate aftermath
of an earthquake. Therefore, our
programs are focused on attempt
ing to ensure all individuals under
stand how to prepare and react in
event of an earthquake."

time," Segall said. "There is a
range of variability, which makes
prediction rather difficult. How
ever, what geological studies can
give us is information that lets us
know that there is a higher possi
bility of an earthquake happen
ing."
According to Segall, an earth
quake of a magnitude comparable
to that of Japan's is highly unlike-
ly for the San Andreas Fault.
"Even the San Andreas cannot
produce a 9.0 earthquake, but a 7.0
to 8.0 at most," Segall said. "But the
Cascadia subduction zone
which extends from Canada to
northern California can poten
tially reach a magnitude of nine."
This news bodes well for Stan
ford, which, over the years, has un
dergone a rigorous seismic retro
fitting for vulnerable buildings. All
new buildings, including the Knight
Management Center, have been
carefully constructed to withstand
earthquakes.
"The Knight building uses a
buckling restrain brace, a new type
of system developed 10 to 15 years
ago," said Greg Deierlein, a civil and
environmental engineering profes
sor. "The brace structure helps the
building during compression to re
sist buckling. The new Bio-E build
ing will also have this brace."
The department of Environ
mental Health & Safety (EHS)
works with Stanford's seismologists
to develop measures to ensure cam
pus safety.
"What Stanford has done over
many years is to really try to com
bine preparedness with what we
know about the possibility of seis
mic activity in the area and attempt
to mitigate as many risks as possi
ble," wrote Lawrence Gibbs, EHS
associate vice provost, in an email
to The Daily.
"These include seismic retro
fitting of many of our buildings,
adding emergency generators to
many buildings to ensure power
availability [and] ensuring emer
gency food and water supplies are
available," he said.
Other measures that the depart
ment has taken include the installa
tion of fire sprinkler systems in all
undergraduate housing residences
and most laboratories, automatic
seismic gas shutoffs and emergency
warning and communication sys
tems. It also ensured that data back
up systems are available to protect
critical information. More recently,
a program to provide for non-struc
tural restraints on high value re

search equipment has been pro
posed.
"People's perceptions of earth
quakes are often of buildings falling
or collapsing completely," said
Mary-Lou Zoback, vice president
of Earthquake Risk Applications at
Risk Management Solutions, a
local risk assessment consulting
group.
"However, most of the damage
that people don't generally think
about is the shaking and disruption
of the building's contents," she
added. "Lab materials and equip
ment can be damaged, data can be
lost."
While the proactive measures
implemented can sufficiently help
Stanford withstand up to a 7.5
quake from the San Andreas Fault,
earthquake researchers and staff
emphasize the importance of main
taining vigilance in building inspec
tions and earthquake safety educa
tion.
"Stanford's preparedness is
based on the probability that an
earthquake would impact the
whole region," Gibbs said. "Stan
ford needs to be able to be self suf
ficient in the immediate aftermath
of an earthquake. Therefore, our
programs are focused on attempt
ing to ensure all individuals under
stand how to prepare and react in
event of an earthquake."

The Tohoku earthquake, which
struck the northeast coast of Hon
shu, Japan on March 11 and trig
gered a 23-foot tsunami, is not
only a tragedy in and of itself, but
a grim reminder for seismologists
and scientists that earthquakes
are one of the most dangerous
natural disasters out there, ac
cording to Stanford researchers.
Based on geological records
and written historical accounts,
Japanese seismologists anticipat
ed earthquake magnitudes from
7.0 to 8.0 from the Japan Trench.
The resulting 9.0 earthquake re
veals that despite the wealth of
seismic data that has been collect

ed over the years, earthquakes are
capricious events.
"Earthquakes don't happen on
a schedule," said geophysics pro
fessor Greg Beroza. "They're not
only unpredictable, the onset is
extremely rapid."
Stanford is not invulnerable to
these quakes. The two nearest
faults that pose the greatest threat
to Stanford are the San Andreas
and Hayward faults. Although the
San Andreas Fault is closer to
Stanford, Stanford seismologists
are more concerned about the
Hayward fault, which, according
to geophysics professor Paul
Segall, is reaching the end of its av
erage fault slip cycle of 140 years.
Segall is currently tackling the
difficulty of measuring earth

quake occurrence by studying
crustal deformation and fault me
chanics by using precise GPS
measurements to measure distor
tions created by the accumulated
stress of faults locking together
due to friction. Earthquakes occur
when the stress of the faults over
comes the friction of the locked
plates.
"Take the Hayward fault, the
fault that runs directly under
Berkeley," Segall said. "The aver
age distance the fault should move
is about one centimeter per year.
The Hayward fault hasn't slipped
since 1868, so about 140 years. If
you multiply 140 years times one
centimeter, you need over a
meter's worth of slip."
These measurements, however

precise, need to be taken with a
grain of salt. Segall cautioned
against viewing the average cycle
calculations as rigid, accurate pre
dictions of seismic activity.
"Just because the average is
140 years doesn't mean it's going
to happen exactly at that average
time," Segall said. "There is a
range of variability, which makes
prediction rather difficult. How
ever, what geological studies can
give us is information that lets us
know that there is a higher possi
bility of an earthquake happen
ing."

quake of a magnitude comparable
