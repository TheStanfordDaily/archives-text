## Stanford prepared for potential big earthquake 
### JENNY THAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Tohoku earthquake, which
struck the northeast coast of Hon
shu, Japan on March 11 and trig
gered a 23-foot tsunami, is not
only a tragedy in and of itself, but
a grim reminder for seismologists
and scientists that earthquakes
are one of the most dangerous
natural disasters out there, ac
cording to Stanford researchers.
Based on geological records
and written historical accounts,
Japanese seismologists anticipat
ed earthquake magnitudes from
7.0 to 8.0 from the Japan Trench.
The resulting 9.0 earthquake re
veals that despite the wealth of
seismic data that has been collect

ed over the years, earthquakes are
capricious events.
"Earthquakes don't happen on
a schedule," said geophysics pro
fessor Greg Beroza. "They're not
only unpredictable, the onset is
extremely rapid."
Stanford is not invulnerable to
these quakes. The two nearest
faults that pose the greatest threat
to Stanford are the San Andreas
and Hayward faults. Although the
San Andreas Fault is closer to
Stanford, Stanford seismologists
are more concerned about the
Hayward fault, which, according
to geophysics professor Paul
Segall, is reaching the end of its av
erage fault slip cycle of 140 years.
Segall is currently tackling the
difficulty of measuring earth

quake occurrence by studying
crustal deformation and fault me
chanics by using precise GPS
measurements to measure distor
tions created by the accumulated
stress of faults locking together
due to friction. Earthquakes occur
when the stress of the faults over
comes the friction of the locked
plates.
"Take the Hayward fault, the
fault that runs directly under
Berkeley," Segall said. "The aver
age distance the fault should move
is about one centimeter per year.
The Hayward fault hasn't slipped
since 1868, so about 140 years. If
you multiply 140 years times one
centimeter, you need over a
meter's worth of slip."
These measurements, however

precise, need to be taken with a
grain of salt. Segall cautioned
against viewing the average cycle
calculations as rigid, accurate pre
dictions of seismic activity.
"Just because the average is
140 years doesn't mean it's going
to happen exactly at that average
time," Segall said. "There is a
range of variability, which makes
prediction rather difficult. How
ever, what geological studies can
give us is information that lets us
know that there is a higher possi
bility of an earthquake happen
ing."
According to Segall, an earth
quake of a magnitude comparable
to that of Japan's is highly unlike-
