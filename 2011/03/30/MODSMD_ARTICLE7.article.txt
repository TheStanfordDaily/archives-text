## Senate passes two bills and discusses ROTC vote Motion to suspend rule of order for ROTC fails 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU 12th Undergraduate Sen
ate passed two bills Tuesday evening,
confirming Zachary Warma 'll as direc
tor of the ASSU Publications Board and
passing an amendment to the non-dis
crimination statement of the ASSU
Joint bylaws. Senators Carolyn Sim
mons 'l3 and Ben Jenson 'l2 attended
the meeting via conference call.
The bill, authored by ASSU Publica
tions Board Assistant Director Alice
Nam and sponsored by Senator Made
line Hawes'l3, nominated Warma, a for
mer Daily staff member, to replace for
mer director Alex Katz 'l2, who re
signed on March 18. As the new director,
Warma will oversee funding for student
publications on campus.
Following his unanimous confirma
tion, Warma's first course of action was
proposing, with Nam, a high tech center
in Old Union where student publica
tions would have access to publication
software such as InDesign that is not
available in computer clusters on cam
pus.
"The goal is not to have it be for pub
lications specifically," Warma said. "It's
to create a high tech center where publi-
cation needs are met a layout
room with a lot of software that a
lot of these publications don't
have."
If approved, the room would
likely be located in Nitery 209,
where the Senate meets each Tues
day. Warma and Nam will meet with
Nanci Howe, director of Student
Activities and Leadership, in the
near future to discuss more details
of this plan.
Financial manager Raj Bhan
dari, CEO of Stanford Student En
terprises, reported that the Green
Alliance for Innovative Action
(GAIA) is requesting $2,000 to
reach the $14,000 needed to invite
musician K'naan to speak at Vision
Earth and FutureFest. Bhandari
clarified that while K'naan would
be answering questions and not
performing.
Senator Stewart Macgregor-
Denis 'l3 suggested the possibility
of using money from the ASSU tra
ditions fund if the Senate deemed

that Vision Earth and FutureFest
could become Stanford traditions.
After disbursing money to the jun
ior and sophomore classes, the fund
had $2,500 remaining to subsidize
the cost of inviting the musician.
The senators agreed to conduct an
email vote after they have more
time to consider the topic.
Macgregor-Denis then shared
with the Senate an iPhone version
of the ASSU website and solicited
feedback on the app.
Kannappan and Senator Robin
Perani 'l3 then motioned to move
the meeting start time to 7:30 p.m.
Both have classes end after the cur
rent 7 p.m. start time. They request
ed this change so that they could at
tend more than half of each of the
four remaining meetings in order to
retain their position. The Senate
unanimously voted to move the
meeting to 7:30 p.m.
Perani initiated a lengthy discus
sion when she moved for a suspen
sion of the rules of order so the Sen
ate could reconsider the ROTC ad
visory question that will appear on
the general elections ballot next
week.
Perani argued that she did not
have enough information when the

issue was first put to vote and would
have voted differently with the in
formation she has now. The initial
bill, proposed by ASSU President
Angelina Cardona 'll, was passed
unanimously last month.
"I was under the impression that
there had been a lot of discussion
with the transgender community
and with the LGBT community,
that there was an agreement and
that this would be beneficial to it,"
she said. "But this was clearly not
the case."
Senator Daniel Khalessi 'l2
echoed Perani's sentiments.
"I don't even remember voting
for this bill," Khalessi said. "It was
two minutes. We steamrolled
through it with a meeting we had
with the GSC, we didn't really dis
cuss it."
Despite over an hour of debate,
the motion to suspend the rules of
order failed to garner the 10 votes
necessary to reach the two-thirds
majority required to pass the mo
tion. The advisory question will re
main on the ballot; voting begins on
Apr. Bth.
