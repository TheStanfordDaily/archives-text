## Haas receives 150 fellowship apps Interest in public interest law up as philanthropic fellowships see decline 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice received approximately 150 ap
plicants for its 60 fellowships for
summer 2011, according to Fellow
ships Program Director Jeff
Hawthorne, This year saw a spike in
applicants to the public interest law
fellowship, but the philanthropy fel
lowship continued to receive a low
number of applicants.
The Haas Center Undergradu
ate Fellowship Program offers fi
nancial support to students who
wish to work on domestic or inter
national public service projects. The
program offers fellows a $4,000
base stipend to fund their program,
with additional support correspon
ding to students' financial need.
Though the total amount of funding
for this year's fellows has not been
calculated yet, Hawthorne said the
center averages $500,000 each year
in grants.

Fellows admitted to the program
participate in one of 11 fellowships:
African Service, Community Arts,
Education and Youth Develop
ment, Haas Summer, Haas Summer
Round 11, Philanthropy, Public In
terest Law, Stanford Pride, Spiritu
ality, Service, Social Change, Don
ald A. Strauss and Urban Summer.
Though most fellowships in
volve students working in non-prof
it organizations, the philanthropy
fellowship places students on the
funding side of service, said Sarah
Scheenstra 'll, student ambassador
for undergraduate fellowships.
"Philanthropy is grant-making,
so rather than being at a non-profit
where you're depending on funding
from other places, often when
you're working in philanthropy
you're working with other organi
zations to fund their projects,"
Scheenstra said. "It's kind of a flip
side to the equation."
Scheenstra participated in the
African Service fellowship the sum
mer after her sophomore year,
working for the Daily Monitor in
Uganda. Following her fellowship,
Scheenstra continued to work with
the Haas Center to market the fel

lowship program among students.
The fact that the philanthropy
fellowship is different from the typ
ical service fellowship could be one
reason why fewer students apply to
that particular program, Scheenstra
said.
"It's not really on people's radar
and they maybe aren't considering
the possibility of philanthropy," she
added.
Hawthorne, on the other hand,
thinks that the low interest in the
philanthropy program is due to the
fact that the current student mar
keting team does not have a student
who had participated in that pro
gram. The Haas Center will contin
ue to search for a student to repre
sent that fellowship and promote
the other fellowships for the coming
year.
"We'll continue to use the chan
nels that we have because they're
the most effective avenues for
reaching where we think there's an
intersection with some of the
coursework that they're doing,"
Hawthorne said.
