"SPOOKY ACTIONS AT A DISTANCE"
Einstein's real complaint about the quantum theory was not that it required God to play dice, but that it

rhetorical device of a computer-simulated lecture demonstration to explain both the power of Einstein's
criticism and the remarkable fact that the "reality" he insisted upon is nevertheless impossible.
