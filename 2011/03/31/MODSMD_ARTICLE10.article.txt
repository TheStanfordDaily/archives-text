## SOLIDARITY IN EL SALVADOR Students travel to Central America to study liberation, human rights struggles 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Traffic looms on either side as police
officers attempt to direct the crowd
off the street, too large to be con
tained by the plaza. Spanish words
buzz past my ears at speeds too fast
to comprehend, so instead, I focus on retriev
ing my bagged dinner and candle for the vigil.
Just before 6 p.m., the chaotic crowd trans
forms into three orderly lines drawing people
down San Salvador's main avenue.The march
in honor of El Salvador's martyr and unoffi
cial saint, Oscar Romero, has begun.
People of all sorts flow past me in the sea
of celebration: Salvadorian youth energized
for a man of another time, Salvadorian elders
who remember their hero with pride, interna
tional students and workers affected by the
legacy of Romero and us, a group of 20 Amer
icans attempting to build solidarity with the
Salvadorian nation.
As participants and professors of the win
ter quarter class. El Salvador: Liberation The
ology and Human Rights, we were joined by
members of South Bay Sanctuary Covenant
(SBSC), a local religious group committed to
creating social justice in Latin America, for a
week of confronting the past and present re
alities of El Salvador.
Throughout the week, we met with social
activists about the evolving tension and vio
lence in the Cabanas province due to mining
and environmental issues. We heard from a
variety of voices detailing El Salvador's cur
rent drug, gang, female inequality and immi
gration problems. Though 19 years have
passed since the end of its civil war, many of
the issues prompting it remain unresolved.
At the chapel where Monsenor Romero
was assassinated, we stood with our hands on
the altar, each offering a word of what the
man, a conservative, Roman Catholic arch
bishop turned liberal voice for the oppressed,
represented for us.
"Faith." "Hope." "Love." "Justice." Each
word is said with conviction, as if a strong
voice could will these words into being.
"The transformation of our people and
our society is in our hands. Not in those of

Obama nor those of Funes," offers our guide,
a Carmelite nun, in closing. "Rather, change is
brought about through my hands and the
small decisions I make each day in which I act
with justice, peace and solidarity."
After five days of meetings in San Sal
vador, interlaced with good food and good
conversation, we packed up our mini bus for
the two-hour drive out of the capital and into
the rural countryside of the Lower Lempa.
Every time the bus stopped along the shack
lined roads, we were met with a chorus of
"Mango! Pan dulce!," as sellers thrust food
items towards us through the open bus win
dows.
When the bus pulled into Comunidad Oc
tavio Ortiz, a partner community of South
Bay Sanctuary Covenant, signs and general
excitement welcomed us. After introductions,
we jostled through a rendition of "Heads,
Shoulders, Knees and Toes" for the children.
"You do realize this means we'll never be
able to run for public office," a fellow Stan
ford student joked, upon realizing we were

being taped.
Soon, as the energy dwindled down, I was
following my host brother down the main
road toward his home. We approached a
house with two girls preparing dinner near
the outside fire, a dog sleeping quietly be
neath it. A quick peek into the house revealed
hammocks as the only furniture, besides a
table or two, upon which sat a stereo and a
blaring television.
As the girls chopped vegetables, preparing
a soup for dinner, I took in the scene around
me. Laundry hung on multiple lines. A heavy
duty truck stood alone on one side of the lot;
firewood was stacked against the house, and a
pile of freshly picked corn lay waiting to be
husked, while four dogs, a cat and many chick
ens snuck in the house, only to be shooed out.
A dog approached me, and when I asked
for its name, my host brother looked up from
his work, smiled and said "Gringo," the irony
not lost on either of us.

The next two days passed in a blur of tor
tilla and jam making, sugar cane processing,

soccer games, mishaps with outdoor showers
and latrines, loud music waking us up at 5
a.m., a developing hatred for cockroaches and
my own attempts to avoid butchering the
Spanish language.
After living with my host family, meeting
with the community board and partaking in
the community's Celebration of the Word,
what speakers in San Salvador had alluded to
became a reality for me: the Salvadorian peo
ple welcomed our solidarity. Young and old
alike passed "La Paz" after service, and few of
us were without a little girl climbing onto our
laps or laying siege to our hands.
On the last night, at a concert celebrating
Romero at the University of Central Ameri
ca, stood the very same segments of society
from the march a week prior, only this time,
our group was not interested in building soli
darity. Instead, I smiled, realizing that we em
bodied it as we echoed back the nationalistic
responses in the song, "Sombrero Azul":

"Dale salvadoreno, (dale)
que no hay pajaro pequeno, (dale)
que despues de alzar el vuelo, (dale)
se dentenga en su volar."

"Let's do this Salvadorians (let's do this),
There is no little bird (let's do this),
That after take-off (let's do this).
Stops in its flight."

able to run for public office," a fellow Stan
ford student joked, upon realizing we were

being taped.
Soon, as the energy dwindled down, I was
following my host brother down the main
road toward his home. We approached a
house with two girls preparing dinner near
the outside fire, a dog sleeping quietly be
neath it. A quick peek into the house revealed
hammocks as the only furniture, besides a
table or two, upon which sat a stereo and a
blaring television.
As the girls chopped vegetables, preparing
a soup for dinner, I took in the scene around
me. Laundry hung on multiple lines. A heavy
duty truck stood alone on one side of the lot;
firewood was stacked against the house, and a
pile of freshly picked corn lay waiting to be
husked, while four dogs, a cat and many chick
ens snuck in the house, only to be shooed out.
A dog approached me, and when I asked
for its name, my host brother looked up from
his work, smiled and said "Gringo," the irony
not lost on either of us.

The next two days passed in a blur of tor
tilla and jam making, sugar cane processing,

soccer games, mishaps with outdoor showers
and latrines, loud music waking us up at 5
a.m., a developing hatred for cockroaches and
my own attempts to avoid butchering the
Spanish language.
After living with my host family, meeting
with the community board and partaking in
the community's Celebration of the Word,
what speakers in San Salvador had alluded to
became a reality for me: the Salvadorian peo
ple welcomed our solidarity. Young and old
alike passed "La Paz" after service, and few of
us were without a little girl climbing onto our
laps or laying siege to our hands.
On the last night, at a concert celebrating
Romero at the University of Central Ameri
ca, stood the very same segments of society
from the march a week prior, only this time,
our group was not interested in building soli
darity. Instead, I smiled, realizing that we em
bodied it as we echoed back the nationalistic
responses in the song, "Sombrero Azul":

"Dale salvadoreno, (dale)
que no hay pajaro pequeno, (dale)
que despues de alzar el vuelo, (dale)
se dentenga en su volar."

"Let's do this Salvadorians (let's do this),
There is no little bird (let's do this),
That after take-off (let's do this).
Stops in its flight."

Salvadorian hero, at a march in San Salvador.
Traffic looms on either side as police
officers attempt to direct the crowd
off the street, too large to be con
tained by the plaza. Spanish words
buzz past my ears at speeds too fast
to comprehend, so instead, I focus on retriev
ing my bagged dinner and candle for the vigil.
Just before 6 p.m., the chaotic crowd trans
forms into three orderly lines drawing people
down San Salvador's main avenue.The march
in honor of El Salvador's martyr and unoffi
cial saint, Oscar Romero, has begun.
People of all sorts flow past me in the sea
of celebration: Salvadorian youth energized
for a man of another time, Salvadorian elders
who remember their hero with pride, interna
tional students and workers affected by the
legacy of Romero and us, a group of 20 Amer
icans attempting to build solidarity with the
Salvadorian nation.
As participants and professors of the win
ter quarter class. El Salvador: Liberation The
ology and Human Rights, we were joined by
members of South Bay Sanctuary Covenant
(SBSC), a local religious group committed to
creating social justice in Latin America, for a
week of confronting the past and present re
alities of El Salvador.
Throughout the week, we met with social
activists about the evolving tension and vio
lence in the Cabanas province due to mining
and environmental issues. We heard from a
variety of voices detailing El Salvador's cur
rent drug, gang, female inequality and immi
gration problems. Though 19 years have
passed since the end of its civil war, many of
the issues prompting it remain unresolved.
At the chapel where Monsenor Romero
was assassinated, we stood with our hands on
the altar, each offering a word of what the
man, a conservative, Roman Catholic arch
bishop turned liberal voice for the oppressed,
represented for us.
"Faith." "Hope." "Love." "Justice." Each
word is said with conviction, as if a strong
voice could will these words into being.
"The transformation of our people and
our society is in our hands. Not in those of

Obama nor those of Funes," offers our guide,
a Carmelite nun, in closing. "Rather, change is
brought about through my hands and the
small decisions I make each day in which I act
with justice, peace and solidarity."
After five days of meetings in San Sal
vador, interlaced with good food and good
conversation, we packed up our mini bus for
the two-hour drive out of the capital and into
the rural countryside of the Lower Lempa.
Every time the bus stopped along the shack
lined roads, we were met with a chorus of
"Mango! Pan dulce!," as sellers thrust food
items towards us through the open bus win
dows.
When the bus pulled into Comunidad Oc
tavio Ortiz, a partner community of South
Bay Sanctuary Covenant, signs and general
excitement welcomed us. After introductions,
we jostled through a rendition of "Heads,
Shoulders, Knees and Toes" for the children.
"You do realize this means we'll never be
able to run for public office," a fellow Stan
ford student joked, upon realizing we were
