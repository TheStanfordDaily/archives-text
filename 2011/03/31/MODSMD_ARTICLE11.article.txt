## SEEING GREEN Good Nuke, Bad Nuke 
### Holly Moeller 
If you've ever seen "sunburns"
on the skin of a cancer patient
after radiation therapy, you've
seen the hazards of radioactivity. If
you've seen a picture of a mush
room cloud, you've seen the dan
gers of nuclear weapons. And if
you've watched the news from
Japan over the last few weeks, you
know how fragile human control of
nuclear power can be.
For those of you who haven't, I
offer this ripped-from-the-head
lines summary: Earthquake. Tsuna
mi. Failed cooling systems at a
coastal nuclear power plant. (Flere,
reports diverge. On the one hand,
Japanese news outlets and the
plant's operators may be down
playing the situation whether to
maintain calm or for self-preserva
tion. Meanwhile, Western accounts
at some points suggesting immi
nent catastrophe may be cater
ing to the opposite extreme. The
true story, when it emerges through
the plumes of steam, will have its
heroes and its failures, likely in
cluding some loss of life though
paling in comparison to the thou
sands killed outright by the tsuna
mi.)

But for those of us who have
also seen and believed the
evidence of the impact of rising at
mospheric carbon dioxide (climate
change and ocean acidification) on
our planet, there are some things
more terrifying than a reactor on
the loose. How many homes will be
lost to sea level rise? How many
livelihoods will be devastated by
shifting patterns of rain and
drought? How tenuous will human
ity's existence become, not just in
zones of radioactive fallout, but on
the entire planet?
Nuclear power's promise is its
generation of electricity without
the emission of a steady stream of
greenhouse gases (and other,
acutely toxic pollutants), thus slow
ing the increase of atmospheric
CO2. Today, some thirteen percent
of global electricity comes from nu
clear power, to the carbon-savings
tune of 2.5 billion tons of CO2
emissions each year. Still, nuclear
power is nonrenewable. It relies
upon the extraction and refinement
of radioactive heavy metals, tempo
rary use of these materials in reac
tors and, ultimately, interminably
long storage of radioactive waste in
facilities that have proved impossi
ble to locate or secure over the
multigenerational timescales in
volved.

It is for these reasons and,
perhaps more so, because of the
hazards of a catastrophic meltdown
or the threat of terrorism that
nuclear power has proven both po
litically and economically infeasi
ble. In the United States, no new

plant construction has begun in
nearly 40 years, and none will begin
without heavy government subsi
dies. Though new technologies like
pebble bed reactors promise higher
efficiency and greater safety, many
western countries have sworn off
nuclear power altogether.
Is our risk-aversion soundly
based?
In 1986, when the Chernobyl
plant melted down, 28 people died
within days from acute radiation
poisoning. But, while those deaths
were both horrific and tragic, the
truly insidious fear was cancer. Be
tween 1991 and 2003,6,000 cases of
thyroid cancer were diagnosed in
the region.
But compare that number to the
44,000 thyroid cancer diagnoses
made here in the United States
every single year. Or to the 17,000
annual "premature deaths" which
the EPA attributes to air pollution
from coal plants. Yet the vanishing
ly small risk of cancer from a super
diffuse plume of radiation (wafting
5,500 miles across the Pacific
Ocean from Japan's crippled plant)
is enough to send Californians scur
rying to buy up all the iodine pills
available.
Like a frog unaware of water
coming to a boil around it, we have
habituated ourselves to a slow de
cline in environmental quality. We
no longer recognize the baseline
death toll claimed by asthma, by
coal mining accidents, by heavy
metal poisoning. We refuse to ac
knowledge our role in global cli
mate change even though the evi
dence is overwhelming and the
consequences of inaction are dire.
Are the unknowns that lie ahead
really so frightening that we refuse
to engage with them at all? Or are
they so distant that we cannot
stomach making hard choices
today?

Would a more balanced assess
ment of risks result in economic vi
ability for nuclear power? A 2009
MIT study found that an emissions
tax of at least $25 per ton of CO2
would be necessary to level the
playing field with fossil fuels. It is
with such a tax in place and in the
absence of other subsidies for
renewables and nuclear, as well as
for fossil fuels that we should let
the market determine whether nu
clear power is a viable option.

My purpose in this column is not
to downplay the tragedies unfold
ing in Japan. Nor is it to provide a
glowing endorsement of nuclear
power. No: I ask only that each one
of us stops to think carefully about
the risks we are willing to accept
and how these compare to the risks
we are already taking either de
liberately or incidentally in our
current fossil fuel-based economy.
Nuclear power is one item on a
frighteningly short list of alterna
tive energy sources. While neither
clean nor renewable, it is scientifi
cally (if not economically) viable

right now. And perhaps it deserves
a little less fear-mongering â€”at
least while some very real dangers
are escaping it altogether.
We've come a long way since
the days when the "Firecracker
Boys" of Operation Plowshare
proposed the peaceful (and ludi
crous!) use of nuclear weapons to
blast Alaskan harbors, widen the
Panama Canal or level inconven
ient mountain ranges. But we
should not let the pendulum of
public opinion swing too far in the
opposite direction without modu
lating its path with wisdom.

One nuke, two nuke; red nuke, blue
nuke. We hope this Daiichi thing's a
fluke. Send thoughts, comments and
