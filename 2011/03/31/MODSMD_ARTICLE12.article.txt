Kenny Mendes is head of recruit
ing at Box, a Palo Alto-based enter
prise startup that is changing the way
enterprises manage their data in the
cloud. Over five million people and
60,000 businesses including 73
percent of the Fortune 500 use
Box to collaborate with their data
and access it from any mobile device.
Box was named Inc. Magazine's No.
3 breakout company of 2010 and was
ranked as the second-fastest growing
private company in the Silicon Val
ley. It has tripled in size to over 150
employees in the last year and a half
and is continuing to expand, espe
cially in engineering and sales. Inter

I'm not here to tell you that as
sembling a killer team is critical to
building a winning startup. There
are enough successful entrepre
neurs who have sufficiently driven
that point home. At Box, however,
we are hyper-paranoid about this.
Steve Jobs said it best: "Some people
aren't used to an environment
where excellence is expected."
Though Box has tripled in size in the
last year and a half, we still have a
laser focus on hiring the type of peo
ple you could build a startup from
scratch with. I'm going be sharing
some insight into the critical quali
ties we look for in every new hire at
Box in other words, what makes
the Perfect Boxer.
Since none of you are currently
responsible for recruiting talent at
Box, why would any of this be useful
at all for you to read? For those of
you interested in working in a start
up after you graduate, the biggest
value might be the perspective it
gives you into the hiring philoso
phies of a fast-moving company and
the intangibles we look for in new

recruits. Or you may be an entrepre
neur growing your own team, in
which case feel free to borrow from
the lessons we've learned through
out the years. Thinking back to my
own mindset when I was graduating
college, however, I didn't under
stand how to completely evaluate
the organizations that were inter
viewing me. I was analyzing factors
such as job responsibilities, compen
sation, product and perks, but I un
derestimated how important it was
to weigh the horsepower of the peo
ple I would be working with. Re
member, amazing teams build win
ning companies, not ideas.
Aaron Le vie, our co-founder and
CEO, used to interview each candi
date we were considering hiring. He
assessed their raw smarts, quickness,
passion and track record and en
sured that these hires would add to
Box's strong culture and make a
huge impact. But as Box began to
grow faster and faster, it became in
efficient to have Aaron meet with so
many potential hires. As we gradual
ly delegated more hiring responsi
bilities to various managers and the
process became increasingly distrib
uted, Aaron analyzed, articulated
and conveyed to our leadership
team the most important traits he
deemed necessary in the people we
hire. The Perfect Boxer needs to be:
A big thinker - has ambitions and
dreams; will never be outdone.
Successful - we want people who
know what it is like to win.
Enthusiastic - you just want to be
around this person; fun, happy, excit
ed.
Super smart - you feel like you
can learn a lot from this person.
Resourceful - knows how to
leverage the tools around them.
