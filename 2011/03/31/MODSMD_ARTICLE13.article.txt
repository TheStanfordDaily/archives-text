## New York, I Love You, But You're Bringing SF Down 
### Shane Savitsky 
Spring quarter has sprung at
Stanford or so I'm told. I'm
still at home in beautiful Scran
ton, Pennsylvania. There's snow on
the ground. I don't leave for Oxford
for another two and a half weeks.
Being at home for such a long peri
od of time can definitely get boring,
but there're ways to pass the time.
On Tuesday, I spent the day in New
York City. Being in Manhattan
again reminded me of an argument
that I often have with friends on
campus. I'll warn you, if your home
state borders the Pacific Ocean,
you're probably not going to like
what I have to say.
First things first: I love Stanford. I
love the weather, I love the people
and I love the Bay Area. Though the
West Coast has brought me nothing
but pure greatness during my three
years there, I'm still an East-Coaster
at heart. Think of it as an "it's not
you, it's me" situation. No matter
how fantastic the West Coast could
possibly be even if Arrested De
velopment inexplicably came back
on the air only in California it still
could never trump the East Coast in
my mind. I'm a homer, what can I
say? And to that extent, I'm going to
make a point that might be a little
controversial back on campus: New
York City is exponentially better
than San Francisco, no matter how
much you West Coasters refuse to
admit it.

There are the important things
like transportation. First and fore
most on that topic, New York has
the Cash Cab. It already wins. But if
you insist on going deeper, New

York's subway system is the most
useful thing ever. Yes, it's grimy, old
and rat-infested, but if you need to
get yourself between two places
anywhere in the five boroughs on
the cheap, it's definitely the way to
go. BART can't even compare.
There's what, like six stops in San
Francisco? I guess I could use the
MUNI or the bus, but that might
mean getting accosted by hordes of
homeless people. I mean, seriously,
Gavin Newsom can get Flappy
Meal toys banned in San Francisco,
but he can't get rid of homeless
people? Rudy Giuliani pulled that
off almost a decade ago in New
York City.
(Speaking of Gavin Newsom, I
like the guy a lot, but did San Fran
cisco seriously reelect him in 2007
after he admitted to cheating on his
wife? That's political suicide, but
somehow San Francisco rewards it
with a landslide victory. I'm a politi
cal science major! I study elections!
This stuff is common sense. Adul
tery loses elections... except in San
Francisco. Newsom kind of owned
that town, yet he still bailed for
Sacramento. Ouch.)
Should we talk sports, too? How
about baseball? Okay, so the Giants
won the World Series last year
their first in San Francisco. Big deal.

They've been playing there since
1958. Did it really take you guys that
long? I know the Giants fans out
there will be quick to say, "Hey
Shane, you know the Giants organi
zation has six World Series titles in
its history. Not just one," Really?
Well, where did your beloved Giants
get five of their World Series wins?
Oh yeah in New York. Even the
Giants were five times more suc
cessful in New York than in San
Francisco. When the Giants some
how manage to equal the 27 World
Series victories of my Yankees, then
we can talk, okay?
Here's the thing, San Francisco:
New York is the social, cultural and
financial capital of the United
States. There's really no way around
it. You guys just can't top that. You
don't see the characters in Gossip
Girl stomping around Russian Hill.
They're on the Upper East Side for
a reason. Even the hipsters in
Williamsburg manage to be more
relevant than the hipsters in The
Mission. There's at least a music
scene in Brooklyn. However, San
Francisco, you do have the Golden
Gate Bridge, and I'll admit that it's
pretty awesome. I might even let
you say that The Presidio is almost
as good as Central Park, but those
are my only concessions. Let's face
it: no matter which way you look at
it, you're still New York's little
brother.

Do any Californians think that Shane
is a complete Nob (Hill) for his blas
phemy? E-mail him atsavitsky@stan
ford.edu to let him know.
