## RUSH K-Sig For Freedom 
### PETER MCDONALD, '11 
No all-campus parties for two weeks, freshmen plot
ting how they're going to take over the Row and
girls dressed up at ridiculous hours for reasons
none of them can really explain, I think it might be RUSH
season. I don't really care if you RUSH, but if you do, join
Kappa Sig.
The totality of my Greek experience was one Theta
Delt rush event freshman year, but I've often been told
that the Band is like a fraternity. If so, then our common
ality would stem from a history of the University dicking
us over. Back in 2006, when the Class of 'l4 were wee
ninth graders just learning how to hate mainstream pop
and I was a high school senior obsessing over my Stan
ford application, four band members wrecked a trailer
they thought was going to be destroyed. Because some
other band members drank a lot at inappropriate times
two and three years prior, the University banned us from
doing halftime shows and traveling to tournaments. They
thought we needed a significant cultural change.
Much in the same way, ResEd, everyone's favorite
Stanford administration, has decided that Kappa Sig
must undergo a "significant cultural change" in order to
get its house back. Fear these words, bros, for they are the
work of the devil. They mean that you are too stupid/in
competent/morally bankrupt to govern yourselves, which
is why Mama ResEd needs to step in and tell you how to
run your student-run organization while all the time in
sisting it's a partnership. I can tell you that the only signif
icant cultural change to come out of the Band's ordeal is
an organization-wide disdain for University administra
tors.
According to Deborah Golder, Dean of Residential
Education, Kappa Sig's mandated "significant cultural
change" is that it needs to go from identifying "just as a
group of tight-knit friends" to being a "true fraternity by
Stanford's definition." That's stupid and possibly evil.
Fraternities and sororities are noxious organizations.
They take personal racism/sexism/heterosexism and
make it institutional. They formalize the "old boys net
work" that is responsible for perpetuating much of the
economic inequality in America, and they create literal
spaces of privilege and entitlement on college campuses.
The only redeeming factor is the actual people. The most
redeeming part about the Greek system at Stanford is
that everyone is smart enough to
call out the bullshit parts for what
they are and recognize that it's just
a friend group.
But ResEd wants Kappa Sig to
downplay the social aspects and
see themselves as an organization
first, which means wearing more
coats and ties to chapter meetings
and talking about the frat and the
chapter and the importance of
leadership in somber tones and
doing more community service
(even though they already do plen
ty), or at least that's what they'll
tell them. In reality, what they want
is for them to stop raging and be
come the type of organization
where "nobody's really into that
sort of thing" and looks down on
the people that are.Then, they'll be
a model fraternity true to Stan
ford's definition. Sacrificing inter
personal bonds for the sake of an
impersonal organization at the be
hest of authority figures, that's
how people perpetuate injustice in
a society.

RUSH (always written with
caps lock) is a weird process. It's a
formal audition process for mak
ing friends, an institutionalization
of high school clique mentality.
Each arbitrary group of letters car
ries a distinct personality that you
are going to mark yourself with but

which, like, totally doesn't define
you. The parent website may talk
about promoting kinship or lead
ership or something like that, but
those are just the same buzzwords
that reside in corporate mission
statements around the world, and
what's more, there is no dis
cernible path for achieving them.
Even the Band has teleology; we
come together to play music and
try to get better at that. The end
goal of joining a fraternity/sorority
is to be in a fraternity/sorority,
which is to say, ResEd, that there is
only one true definition of any
Greek organization at Stanford or
anywhere: the list of people in that
Greek organization.
But this year is different, be
cause ResEd made it different.
Kappa Sig is not just the roster of
its members; it is the frat that "has
had patterns of behavior that go
beyond what 1 would call shenani
gans ... to a level that was danger
ous" and that got off easy by not
being suspended for four years.
Couched in fake benevolence,
ResEd is using its authoritarian
mission to publicly shame Kappa
Sig into being "a true fraternity."
There would be no greater middle
finger to ResEd, paternalism and
anti-fun authoritarianism than for
Kappa Sig to have record numbers
of pledges this year. And so, I say to
all RUSHing freshmen and sopho
mores, even the ladies: RUSH K-
SfG. For freedom.
