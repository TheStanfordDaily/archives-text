## RUSH K-Sig For Freedom 
### PETER MCDONALD, '11 
No all-campus parties for two weeks, freshmen plot
ting how they're going to take over the Row and
girls dressed up at ridiculous hours for reasons
none of them can really explain, I think it might be RUSH
season. I don't really care if you RUSH, but if you do, join
Kappa Sig.
The totality of my Greek experience was one Theta
Delt rush event freshman year, but I've often been told
that the Band is like a fraternity. If so, then our common
ality would stem from a history of the University dicking
us over. Back in 2006, when the Class of 'l4 were wee
ninth graders just learning how to hate mainstream pop
and I was a high school senior obsessing over my Stan
ford application, four band members wrecked a trailer
they thought was going to be destroyed. Because some
other band members drank a lot at inappropriate times
two and three years prior, the University banned us from
doing halftime shows and traveling to tournaments. They
thought we needed a significant cultural change.
Much in the same way, ResEd, everyone's favorite
Stanford administration, has decided that Kappa Sig
must undergo a "significant cultural change" in order to
get its house back. Fear these words, bros, for they are the
work of the devil. They mean that you are too stupid/in
competent/morally bankrupt to govern yourselves, which
is why Mama ResEd needs to step in and tell you how to
run your student-run organization while all the time in
sisting it's a partnership. I can tell you that the only signif
icant cultural change to come out of the Band's ordeal is
an organization-wide disdain for University administra
tors.
According to Deborah Golder, Dean of Residential
Education, Kappa Sig's mandated "significant cultural
change" is that it needs to go from identifying "just as a
group of tight-knit friends" to being a "true fraternity by
Stanford's definition." That's stupid and possibly evil.
Fraternities and sororities are noxious organizations.
They take personal racism/sexism/heterosexism and
make it institutional. They formalize the "old boys net
work" that is responsible for perpetuating much of the
economic inequality in America, and they create literal
spaces of privilege and entitlement on college campuses.
The only redeeming factor is the actual people. The most
redeeming part about the Greek system at Stanford is
