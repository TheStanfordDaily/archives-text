# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Call to Action 
### 
Dear Editor,
This letter is a call to action to the Stanford stu
dent body. An important review of Stanford's Judi
cial Charter is under way, and it is crucial that the
voices of our fellow students be heard.
The Office of Judicial Affairs (OJA) is current
ly undergoing its first major review since 1997,
when Stanford's Judicial Charter was created.
Fourteen years have passed since then, and we are
investigating what is working, what is not working
and what needs to work differently and we want
your input in answering those questions.
As a result of the review, many important facets
of student conduct adjudication on campus may
change significantly, including but not limited to
the following issues:
1) Standard sanction for violations of the Honor
Code (one quarter suspension and 40 hours of
community service)
2) Specification and use of the Fundamental
Standard
3) Appeals process
4) Standard of proof for all types of cases
brought to OJA ("beyond a reasonable doubt,"
"clear and convincing" or "preponderance of the
evidence")
We, the students on the committee conducting
the review, would like to stress the importance of
student awareness and input to the process and to
urge students to contribute their thoughts, be it by
a letter to the review committee or by attending
one of our many events below.
The committee is comprised of representatives
from the Stanford community, including faculty,
staff and students who were nominated by Vice
Provost Boardman and President Hennessy. The
committee has solicited student input through a
few channels. Most prominently, the ASSU coordi
nated a Student Input Forum where each subcom
mittee heard from students about the specific is
sues they are investigating. Additionally, four stu
dents serve on the committee two undergradu
ates and two graduates with one on each sub
committee who continuously represents the stu
dent body. The subcommittees have also spoken
with students who serve as judicial panelists, as well
as students who have reported and responded to
Honor Code or Fundamental Standard violations.
Although students have already contributed
much to the review, more student
participation is vital for the results of
this process to have the most posi
tive impact on the conduct process
and campus culture. We are provid
ing a myriad of ways to give input on
these issues, because we realize the
sensitivity and need for confiden
tiality in many cases.
