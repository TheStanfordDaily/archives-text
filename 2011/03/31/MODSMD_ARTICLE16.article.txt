Dear Editor,
My 9-year-old son and I were just
turned away from Stanford baseball
game yesterday because we brought
a youth football. Ironically, we were
there to meet with a visiting star
quarterback prospect from Seattle
and his family with whom we are
deep friends.
This may seem a trivial item, but
my sophomore son and I were
turned away from a Stanford foot
ball game last year with a Stanford
football.
I think the University needs to
quickly reconsider this. In modern
time-pressure times, much of par
ent/child sports attendance is to
share love of sports, to do like the
collegiates do, to get up and share
exercise at halftime or seventh-in
ning stretch.
Stanford Athletics needs to ac
tively welcome alumni and area res
idents to fill stadiums, not shun
them.
