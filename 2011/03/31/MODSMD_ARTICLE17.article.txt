## SUBS SHINE Reserves key sweep of UC-Santa Cruz 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team ran into
a little trouble last weekend in its return to
league play after several weeks off for finals and
Dead Week. The No. 4 Cardinal split a weekend
series with Cal State Northridge and Long
Beach State, narrowly getting past the last-place
Matadors before dropping a five-set match to
the No. 9 49ers.
But a midweek tune-up against non-league
Div. 11l rival UC-Santa Cruz last night at Maples
Pavilion might be just what the doctor ordered.
Stanford (16-6,12-5 MPSF) rested a few players
with nagging injuries, but looked fluid and con
fident on the court in a 3-0 dismantling of the
Banana Slugs (7-13).
The first set saw the Cardinal get into gear
quickly and take control on the backs of fresh
man outside hitter Eric Mochalski and junior
setter Evan Barry. Even as the team struggled
from the service line with five errors, the de
fense held firm and led to a very efficient side
out game. Mochalski had six kills in the first set,
and Barry finished with 10 assists as Stanford
used several three-point runs to power past
Santa Cruz, 25-15.
"We always want to get better, and it was an
opportunity for our starters to get better
tonight," said head coach John Kosty. "We did
the right things and really concentrated on our
side, I think Stanford men's volleyball per
formed very well tonight."
With the team on a roll and looking rejuve
nated after the first set, Kosty went to his bench
to give his starters a rest in anticipation of this
weekend's showdown with No. 1 and confer
ence-leading use.
The reserves certainly made the most of the
opportunity.
Redshirt junior middle blocker Charley
Henrikson built off his success last weekend
when he came in and sparked a Stanford rally
against Northridge with several kills early in the

second set against the Banana Slugs. Barry con
tinued his usual consistent play as he set a solid
offense for the Card with 12 assists to give Stan
ford a 25-18 margin in set two.
Then the unlikely tandem of junior setter
Dylan Kordic and senior outside hitter lan Con
nolly took over in the third set. Kordic, a con
verted outside hitter, had a career night in his
first extended playing time since he arrived on
the Farm, totaling 15 assists and chipping in
three digs and a kill in one and a half sets.
With the score tied at 19 in the third set, Ko
rdic combined with freshman middle blocker
Denny Falls for a big block and point. Kordic
then set up Connolly for a kill to put the Card up
23-21 before winning a solo joust at the net to

make it 24-21 to give Stanford three match
points.
"Dylan really played great tonight," Kosty
said. "Fie has come a long way from being an
outside hitter. Tonight was an opportunity to
give him a measuring stick and see where he is
with his setting ability."
Kordic himself was humbled by all the atten
tion focused on him after the match.
"The best thing for me was just the support
of the guys on the bench and the play of the guys
on the court with me. They really helped me out
by playing well; it made my job easy."
Connolly, for his part, also had a career night

Senior outside hitter lan Connolly (left) and senior libera Jordan Inafuku (right) got rare amounts of
playing time Wednesday night in No. 4 Stanford men's volleyball's sweep of UC-Santa Cruz. Along
with five digs, Connolly added six kills on seven attempts as the Cardinal cruised to an easy victory
over the Division 111 Banana Slugs. Up next for Stanford is a home match against No. 1 USC.
