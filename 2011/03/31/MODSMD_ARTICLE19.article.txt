# HAVING A BALL
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jamin Ball loves tennis.
He started playing at
age 7, and by 11, the
sport was already his
self-proclaimed "pas
sion." Seven years later, the
Stanford freshman still loves the
game that has been one of the
main components of his young
life.
Tennis is a notoriously brutal
sport, especially for young
teenagers who are thrust into
the throes of competition. Ju
nior tennis is renowned for
being a hotbed of intense and
overly active parenting, but
Ball's motivation came from
within.
"I started getting serious
started playing more and enter
ing more tournaments not
because I was particularly good
at tennis at that time, nor be
cause my parents made me or
anything, but because I really
loved playing," he said. "At first,
it was always only because I just
really liked it."
Raised by two athletic par
ents, Ball was encouraged to
play several different sports
basketball, baseball, tennis and
soccer at a young age, and,
even then, he just really "loved
to compete." But tennis was his
strongest sport, the one where
his natural competitiveness and
drive to win was best suited to
excel due to the isolated, one
on-one nature of the game.
Ball downplayed the intensi
ty of his early experience in jun
ior tennis, saying, "Once I start
ed playing a lot of tournaments,
that's when it started to get a lot
better, because, I mean, it's fun
to practice and everything, but
competition is where you can re
ally see where you're at and
everything, see where you
stand."

When asked if he liked the
competitive nature of his life at
this early age, Ball responded,
"It is really intense, like compet

itively and all, but at the same
time, it's not that intense, be
cause, you know, you're just a lit
tle kid, and at the end of the day
you really don't care too much
about a tennis match or a tennis
tournament or anything. Really,
at that point, my favorite part
was the travel [that junior tour
naments required], I loved
that."
Ball told me about these
early tennis experiences while
the two of us were rallying out in
the strong (for March) Califor
nia sun, something he is used to,
having grown up in the area and
gone to high school in neighbor
ing Menlo Park. It was a great
treat for me, a tennis player but
certainly not a tennis player as
Ball is. He was being nice to me,
keeping the ball in play and only
occasionally rifling backhands
with ease past me, perhaps set
off by an annoying question I
asked him.
Watching him play, it's obvi
ous why he was such a commod
ity for college programs coming
out of high school; he glides
around the court, stinging balls
and effortlessly repelling the
fiercest of my shots. It was there,
on those blue tennis courts
under the lights atTaube Family
Tennis Center, where Ball al
ways wanted to end up.
"It was always a goal of mine,
from the time I started playing
tennis competitively, to play in
college," Ball said. "Of course,
there's a professional level, but
before that, it's college tennis.
Everyone always talks about
college tennis and what a great
experience it is . . . Growing up
right around here, it's kind of
funny, but I've always been set
on coming to Stanford, like, ever
since I was a little kid. I didn't
even take any other official vis
its anywhere or anything, I just
knew that I really wanted to
come here, to play here."
High school tennis at The
Menlo School and playing in a
team for the first time instead of in
the cutthroat individual game of
junior tennis helped Ball cement
his dream of coming to Stanford
and joining the tennis team.
"Playing for the team there was
a lot of fun," he said. "Before that,
you know, tennis is all individual:
you go out, you play in tourna
ments, you compete and, a lot of
times, it just gets boring. The team
was a great time because you're
with your friends on it, there's an
awesome sense of camaraderie,
the coach was awesome it was
just great."
That experience seems to have
carried over into college: "The

whole team aspect is definitely
awesome, especially with a school
like Stanford where everyone is
playing at such a high level," he
said. "You're always around guys
who are going to push you, while,
at the same time, we're all really
close as a team, we all get along
great we kind of need to since
we spend so much time together
but, no, it's really been awe
some, being able to be on this
team."

Ball has played an important
role on the Stanford men's tennis
team this year, contributing in sin
gles and doubles play for the No.
10 Cardinal. In the next few years,
as he keeps improving his game
and accruing experience, he hopes
to keep helping the team he has
dreamed of playing for ever since
he was a 7-year-old kid picking up
a racket for the first time.
