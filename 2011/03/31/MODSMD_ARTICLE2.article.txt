# Fukushima prompts nuclear revaluation
## Japan quake, tsunami motivate overhaul of nuclear reactor standards 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
As the struggle to regain con
trol of the Fukushima nuclear
power plant continues, Stanford
experts say nuclear power faces a
critical reevaluation.
When a 9.0 earthquake struck
offshore of northeastern Japan on
Mar. 11, it triggered a massive
tsunami that swept over sea walls
built for much smaller waves and
swamped the Fukushima nuclear
power plant, damaging the backup
generators and power grid. These
latter devices were meant to stabi

lize the plant in the event of such
an emergency, said physics profes
sor Burton Richter.
With its last source of energy
gone, workers at the plant were no
longer able to cool the plant's re
actors, which soon overheated,
leading to hydrogen gas explo
sions, fires and the release of ra
dioactive elements.
As workers worked to prevent
further damage to the plant, alarm
spread when a plume of radioac
tive particulates floated over the
Pacific Ocean, bringing increased
levels of radiation to the United
States a week later. The fact that

such a disaster occurred in Japan,
which boasted some of the strictest
earthquake safety codes in the
world, has prompted experts to re
visit their relationship with nu
clear power.
Preparing for the unexpected
In light of failures in Fukushi
ma's safety designs, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC)
has begun a major evaluation of its
policies toward reactor safety sys
tems, marking the agency's third
such major overhaul.
The first occurred after the
1979 Three Mile Island partial

meltdown. The second overhaul
came after the 9/11 attacks, when
the commission studied ways to
guard against terrorist attacks a
possibility that, like the combined
tsunami and earthquake, no one
had previously thought was possi
ble, Richter said.
Richter speculated that one
major point of interest for the
commission would be to calculate
how long a plant would have to
rely on emergency generators be
fore power could be reconnected.
This failure was one of the factors
that precipitated the weeklong cri
sis at Fukushima.

"I think that having lost power
for two weeks was something of a
surprise," Richter said. "The right
question to be asked is, do we have
to change requirements for the
amount of fuel for on-site emer
gency generators in the United
States?"
The commission may also study
the possibility of what Richter
calls "multiple catastrophe" sce
narios at each nuclear site. These
scenarios include floods and tor
nadoes in the Midwest and
tsunamis and earthquakes in Cali
fornia, he said.
California currently only has
two active reactors Diablo Canyon
and San Onofre and both are near
active fault lines, according to Ed
ward Blandford, a postdoctoral fel
low at the Center for International
Security and Cooperation
(CISAC), whose work focuses on
nuclear reactor design. Unlike
Japan, California lies on many slip
strike faults, which are much less
likely to generate tsunamis than
Japan's thrust faults.

Blandford also noted that the
Fukushima plant responded well
to the actual earthquake and was
actually damaged by the resulting
tsunami. The California plants, he
added, are also designed to with
stand 6.7 G peak round accelera
tion during an earthquake, which
is double of what the Fukushima
site experienced.

Reevaluating policy
In addition to changing current
nuclear plant regulations, the cri
sis will also greatly shape the de
bate over national nuclear policy.
California senators Dianne Fein
stein and Barbara Boxer, for ex
ample, have called for an immedi
ate review of the California plants.
Blandford predicts that the
most immediate impact will be ei
ther design or operational
changes, particularly whether
many older plants will be granted
permission to continue to operate
or be phased out.
The bigger question, Blandford
noted, was whether new plants
would be constructed.
The criteria that the NRC is
reevaluating suggests that there
will be a delay in granting site li
censes, which evaluates proposed
locations for nuclear plants,
Richter agreed. As the NRC stud
ies its current licensing and safety
requirements, there will likely be a
pause in the licensing of new nu
clear reactors.
Blandford said there are cur
rently two to four nuclear reactors
in the process of acquiring licens
ing and construction permits.
Many of the problems encoun
tered during the Fukushima crisis
also revolved around the spent
fuel ponds, which Blandford said
will "reinvigorate" the conversa
tion over how such fuel should be
stored, both temporarily and in
the long run.
The initial proposal to store the
spent fuel in the Yucca Mountains
in Nevada was taken off the table
after Obama's election.
"There's been a lot of concern
over the politicization of the nu
clear regulatory commission,"
Blandford said.
The end of nuclear?
A recent poll by the Nuclear
Energy Institute, a lobbyist group
for the nuclear industry, found
that support for nuclear energy in
the U.S. had dropped to 2008 lev
els. This abrupt decline comes
after five years of increases in the
number of supporters for nuclear
power plants.
But plans to build new nuclear
power plants in the United States
have dwindled long before the
Mar. 11 earthquake struck Japan
due, in part, to the weakened econ
omy and the high upfront costs for
building a reactor, Blandford said.
Although some larger public
utilities companies, such as South
ern Nuclear, which serves resi
dents in Alabama and Georgia,
are currently in the process of con
structing additional plants, many
companies are not able to make
that same investment and have
asked for government aid.
"If you're a utilities company
that has a capitalization of $l5 bil
lion, it's very difficult for you to
make a $lO billion-dollar invest
ment in a two-unit type plant,"
Blandford said. "A lot of the utili
ties companies have asked the
government to step in and help
provide some loan guarantees
with respect to make that invest
ment upfront."
The 2005 Federal Energy Act
earmarked $5O billion dollars for a
loan-guarantee program to facili
tate the construction of nuclear
power plants, but it remains to be
seen whether the current adminis

tration will provide that same
amount of support.
With the price of natural gas
decreasing to about $4 dollars per
million btu from $lO per million
btu in 2008, Blandford predicts
that these companies will be more
likely to place their long term bets
with natural gas, which currently
produces about 24 percent of en
ergy in the U.S. In comparison, nu
clear reactors produce 20 percent
and coal 40 percent.
Addressing media coverage of
the current crisis, Richter said that
nuclear is still one of the safest
forms of energy currently in use, if
the risks associated with coal min
ing and oil drilling are properly
taken into account.
"The only thing that's better is
wind," he added.
As uncertainty over the fate of
the crippled Fukushima plant
looms, some have declared this cri
sis the end of the nuclear age.
Blandford, however, thinks that nu
clear power will not disappear any
time in the near future. That's be
cause, although the United States
has other natural resources to tap
for energy, many nations such as
France, where nuclear reactors
provide 80 percent of the coun
try's energy, or Japan, where nu
clear produces 30 percent face
space and demand constraints, as
well as a lack of abundant natural
resources.
This need for a high-density en
ergy source that requires little
land space which nuclear
power provides is why over 100
of the world's approximately 400
reactors are located in the United
States.
"The nuclear renaissance is not
United-States-centric; in fact, it's
hardly that," Blandford said.
Business as usual
China recently announced
plans to build enough plants to
supply about 100 gigawatts of
power, equal to the amount of nu
clear power produced in the Unit
ed States. Though it remains un
clear how Beijing's policies might
change in light of the Japanese cri
sis, other countries such as Ger
many, which had planned to heav
ily rely on nuclear fuel to reach its
high renewable energy standard,
have temporarily halted their nu
clear expansion programs.
Blandford nonetheless predicts
that many nations will eventually
continue to pursue nuclear power.
"It's silly for these countries to
not stop and think about what
happened in Japan and to reevalu
ate," Blandford said. "But my
guess is that the nature of the acci
dent is such that people will either
make appropriate designs or addi
tional changes or will determine
that it's not a significant enough
risk to them that they will contin
ue to build out."

Despite the practical reasons
for supporting nuclear energy,
many who are nervously watching
the Fukushima plant feel that the
potential for another similar dis
aster are too great to accept, and
protests calling for its end have
erupted worldwide. Current pub
lic outcry notwithstanding, Bland
ford cites the gradual loss of inter
est in banning offshore drilling a
year after the 2009 Deepwater
Horizon spill as an example of
how "public distress does not nec
essarily enable action."
"People have very short atten
tion spans," he said. "We saw the
same thing happen with offshore
drilling and at this point it appears
that it's business as usual."
"I'm not sure that public re
sponse is going to impact long
term changes to our policy," he
added.
Experts say that many con
cerns over nuclear energy is due to
the public's ignorance on the
issue.
"We have an overwhelming
lack of understanding about some
of the most important industries
that drive our countries," Bland
ford said.
"Numbers are not going to re
lieve the public's fear of nuclear,"
Richter said. "It's frightening and
it's up to the experts and the regu
lators to convince the public that
they've done it right."
