# Fukushima prompts nuclear revaluation
## Japan quake, tsunami motivate overhaul of nuclear reactor standards 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
As the struggle to regain con
trol of the Fukushima nuclear
power plant continues, Stanford
experts say nuclear power faces a
critical reevaluation.
When a 9.0 earthquake struck
offshore of northeastern Japan on
Mar. 11, it triggered a massive
tsunami that swept over sea walls
built for much smaller waves and
swamped the Fukushima nuclear
power plant, damaging the backup
generators and power grid. These
latter devices were meant to stabi

lize the plant in the event of such
an emergency, said physics profes
sor Burton Richter.
With its last source of energy
gone, workers at the plant were no
longer able to cool the plant's re
actors, which soon overheated,
leading to hydrogen gas explo
sions, fires and the release of ra
dioactive elements.
As workers worked to prevent
further damage to the plant, alarm
spread when a plume of radioac
tive particulates floated over the
Pacific Ocean, bringing increased
levels of radiation to the United
States a week later. The fact that

such a disaster occurred in Japan,
which boasted some of the strictest
earthquake safety codes in the
world, has prompted experts to re
visit their relationship with nu
clear power.
Preparing for the unexpected
In light of failures in Fukushi
ma's safety designs, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC)
has begun a major evaluation of its
policies toward reactor safety sys
tems, marking the agency's third
such major overhaul.
The first occurred after the
1979 Three Mile Island partial

meltdown. The second overhaul
came after the 9/11 attacks, when
the commission studied ways to
guard against terrorist attacks a
possibility that, like the combined
tsunami and earthquake, no one
had previously thought was possi
ble, Richter said.
Richter speculated that one
major point of interest for the
commission would be to calculate
how long a plant would have to
rely on emergency generators be
fore power could be reconnected.
This failure was one of the factors
that precipitated the weeklong cri
sis at Fukushima.

"I think that having lost power
for two weeks was something of a
surprise," Richter said. "The right
question to be asked is, do we have
to change requirements for the
amount of fuel for on-site emer
gency generators in the United
States?"
The commission may also study
the possibility of what Richter
calls "multiple catastrophe" sce
narios at each nuclear site. These
scenarios include floods and tor
nadoes in the Midwest and
tsunamis and earthquakes in Cali
