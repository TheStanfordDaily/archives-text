# Tourney as good as it gets

### Jacob Jaffe 
The other day, I randomly
flipped on ESPN to see
Michelle Beadle and Colin
Cowherd debating various
poll questions on Sports N
ation. I usually find the arguments fair
ly obvious but moderately amusing,
so I was half-watching when they got
to the question "Which NCAA post
season do you prefer?" The choices
available were the NCAA Tourna
ment in basketball or the BCS in foot
ball.
Wait, seriously? That's even a
question?
I love college football, and bowl
season is one of the highlights of my
year. But have you seen the NCAA
Tournament this year? Even if all the
games were played by the Globetrot
ters and the Generals with Tim Don
aghy as the referee, they could not
possibly create more exciting, unbe
lievable games than this tournament
has had.
Here we sit with only four teams
left, and there are more double-digit
seeds than ones or twos (something
that has never happened before) and
exactly zero outright regular-season
conference champions. The path to
this crazy quartet was even crazier
than Dick Vitale at a Duke-UNC
game...
One Final Four team has won all
of its tournament games by single dig
its, including two nail-biting finishes
won by a basket in the final five sec
onds. Another Final Four team fin
ished ninth in its own conference and
barely escaped its Elite Eight game,
with two potential game-winning
three-pointers missed in the final sec
onds. A third Final Four team tied a
record by winning its four games by a
combined 13 points, including an
overtime game and two of the crazi
est finishes you will ever see.
Oh yeah, and there's also VCU.
The Rams' five wins in 12 days over
teams from the Pac-10, Big East, Big
Ten, ACC and Big 12 with four of
the five wins coming by double digits
after having one of the weakest at
large profiles ever make this Cin
derella story more unimaginable than
the original Cinderella story itself.
After this, maybe they'll need to call
fairy tales "VCU stories."
In any case, it is impossible to be a
sports fan and not acknowledge how
incredible this year's tournament has
been. Even if you're a devastated Pitt
fan having nightmares about free
throws and rebounds, you can at least
admit that the other 63 games so far
have been ridiculous. I mean, heck, I
lost my bracket pool to my mom
(that's what happens when you let
your relatives pick randomly and
your dad went to VCU for medical
school), and this has still been the
greatest month of neutral sports fan
dom of my life.
How could this possibly be com
pared to the BCS? Yes, that BCS.The
one that induces outrage every year.
The one with more flaws than Rebec
ca Black's "Friday" video. The one
that only exists because no alterna
tive solution would make the people
in charge as much money.
I honestly could not believe the
question was even being asked. As I
expected, the results were over
whelmingly in my (and common
sense's) favor. However, what
bugged me even more than the ques
tion itself was Colin Cowherd's argu
ment in favor of the BCS.
He started off with one of the most
common and obviously flawed phras
es in defense of the BCS: "College
football has a playoff It starts on Sept.
1." Really? So a playoff is a system
where you can lose once or twice as
long as enough other teams lose too,
but you can't even enter the playoff if
you're not a school with a big enough
name? By the college football "play
off' rules, right about now VCU and
Butler would be told that they aren't
from power conferences, so they are
eliminated from the title race, making
Connecticut vs. Kentucky the de
facto championship game.
The argument then goes into how
people think Cinderella stories are
fun, but then they want to see the best
teams win. Maybe it's just me, but I
find the "best teams" argument more
irritatingly useless than the latest up
date on the Barry Bonds trial. How
can you quantify who the "best" teams

are? There are millions of ways.
Which is exactly why there is a
postseason. Is VCU a "better" team
than Kansas? Who cares the
Rams won. Were the Giants the
"best" team in baseball last year, even
though they didn't clinch their own
division until the final weekend of the
regular season? They won when it
mattered, so that makes them the
best. Were the Packers the "best"
team in the NFL, even though they
lost their own division? That Super
Bowl ring will tell you they were.
The whole argument of whether
or not a playoff really crowns the

"right" champion is irrelevant. Each
team knows what it has to do in its
own sport to win the title, so the team
that does that is the best, which is why
playoff games are so entrancing.
That brings us back to this year's
tournament. I certainly didn't predict
it, and if you watched a minute of the
regular season this year, you didn't ei
ther. But the four college basketball
teams vying for the title of the best in
the country are UConn, Kentucky,
Butler and VCU.

And really, bracket competitions
and favorite teams aside, would you
have it any other way?

Jacob Jaffe would like to remind you
that today it is Thursday, and tomor
row is Friday. Fie he he so excited.

you're not a school with a big enough
name? By the college football "play
off' rules, right about now VCU and
Butler would be told that they aren't
from power conferences, so they are
eliminated from the title race, making
Connecticut vs. Kentucky the de
facto championship game.
The argument then goes into how
people think Cinderella stories are
fun, but then they want to see the best
teams win. Maybe it's just me, but I
find the "best teams" argument more
irritatingly useless than the latest up
date on the Barry Bonds trial. How
can you quantify who the "best" teams

are? There are millions of ways.
Which is exactly why there is a
postseason. Is VCU a "better" team
than Kansas? Who cares the
Rams won. Were the Giants the
"best" team in baseball last year, even
though they didn't clinch their own
division until the final weekend of the
regular season? They won when it
mattered, so that makes them the
best. Were the Packers the "best"
team in the NFL, even though they
lost their own division? That Super
Bowl ring will tell you they were.
The whole argument of whether
or not a playoff really crowns the

"right" champion is irrelevant. Each
team knows what it has to do in its
own sport to win the title, so the team
that does that is the best, which is why
playoff games are so entrancing.
That brings us back to this year's
tournament. I certainly didn't predict
it, and if you watched a minute of the
regular season this year, you didn't ei
ther. But the four college basketball
teams vying for the title of the best in
the country are UConn, Kentucky,
Butler and VCU.

And really, bracket competitions
and favorite teams aside, would you
have it any other way?

Jacob Jaffe would like to remind you
that today it is Thursday, and tomor
row is Friday. Fie he he so excited.

The other day, I randomly
flipped on ESPN to see
Michelle Beadle and Colin
Cowherd debating various
poll questions on Sports N
ation. I usually find the arguments fair
ly obvious but moderately amusing,
so I was half-watching when they got
to the question "Which NCAA post
season do you prefer?" The choices
available were the NCAA Tourna
ment in basketball or the BCS in foot
ball.
Wait, seriously? That's even a
question?
I love college football, and bowl
season is one of the highlights of my
year. But have you seen the NCAA
Tournament this year? Even if all the
games were played by the Globetrot
ters and the Generals with Tim Don
aghy as the referee, they could not
possibly create more exciting, unbe
lievable games than this tournament
has had.
Here we sit with only four teams
left, and there are more double-digit
seeds than ones or twos (something
that has never happened before) and
exactly zero outright regular-season
conference champions. The path to
this crazy quartet was even crazier
than Dick Vitale at a Duke-UNC
game...
One Final Four team has won all
of its tournament games by single dig
its, including two nail-biting finishes
won by a basket in the final five sec
onds. Another Final Four team fin
ished ninth in its own conference and
barely escaped its Elite Eight game,
with two potential game-winning
three-pointers missed in the final sec
onds. A third Final Four team tied a
record by winning its four games by a
combined 13 points, including an
overtime game and two of the crazi
est finishes you will ever see.
Oh yeah, and there's also VCU.
The Rams' five wins in 12 days over
teams from the Pac-10, Big East, Big
Ten, ACC and Big 12 with four of
the five wins coming by double digits
after having one of the weakest at
large profiles ever make this Cin
derella story more unimaginable than
the original Cinderella story itself.
After this, maybe they'll need to call
fairy tales "VCU stories."
In any case, it is impossible to be a
sports fan and not acknowledge how
incredible this year's tournament has
been. Even if you're a devastated Pitt
fan having nightmares about free
throws and rebounds, you can at least
admit that the other 63 games so far
have been ridiculous. I mean, heck, I
lost my bracket pool to my mom
(that's what happens when you let
your relatives pick randomly and
your dad went to VCU for medical
school), and this has still been the
greatest month of neutral sports fan
dom of my life.
How could this possibly be com
pared to the BCS? Yes, that BCS.The
one that induces outrage every year.
The one with more flaws than Rebec
ca Black's "Friday" video. The one
that only exists because no alterna
tive solution would make the people
in charge as much money.
I honestly could not believe the
question was even being asked. As I
expected, the results were over
whelmingly in my (and common
sense's) favor. However, what
bugged me even more than the ques
tion itself was Colin Cowherd's argu
ment in favor of the BCS.
He started off with one of the most
common and obviously flawed phras
es in defense of the BCS: "College
football has a playoff It starts on Sept.
1." Really? So a playoff is a system
where you can lose once or twice as
long as enough other teams lose too,
but you can't even enter the playoff if
you're not a school with a big enough
name? By the college football "play
off' rules, right about now VCU and
Butler would be told that they aren't
from power conferences, so they are
eliminated from the title race, making
Connecticut vs. Kentucky the de
facto championship game.
