# New Nano Center upgrades Stanford's nanotech facilities
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Cassandra Feliciano 
Last week, Stanford opened its
new Nano Center, providing the
University with access to one of the
world's most advanced nanotech
nology facilities with future projects
including better solar cells, more effi
cient batteries and more effective
ways to detect cancers.
Although the idea for the Center,
in development since 2007, stems
from the needs of 77 labs across cam
pus, creating just a single structure was
necessary to protect the very expen
sive (each new tool ranges from $6 to
$lO million) and sensitive equipment.
In fact, most of the two-story
building was built underground in
order to reduce vibration and tem
perature instability that could tamp
er with the equipment's effective
ness. The Nano Center even has sev
eral "clean rooms" that are kept free
of dust and allow researchers to
work on any relevant elements un
like traditional "clean rooms" which
only work for silicon.
While the Center's staff has
begun working with students and re
searchers, the building is not fully
equipped. Machines and devices will
continue to come in throughout the
spring and summer quarters.
