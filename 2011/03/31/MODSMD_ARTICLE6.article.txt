## SULAIR digitizes despite Google case 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin's Mar. 22
decision may have thwarted Google's plans to create
an online library and bookstore and rejected a $125
million settlement. But it wasn't enough to deter
some of the Internet giant's partners, including Stan
ford.
"We're continuing to scan," said Andrew
Herkovic, director of communications and develop
ment at Stanford Libraries. "We're continuing to re
ceive scanned versions of things back from Google,
and we're doing so for the purpose of both preserva
tion and the future of scholarship using those digi
tized texts."
The Google library and e-bookstore, which pro
vide online versions of books that are in the public
domain, aimed to give readers access to books that
are out of print. Google already has snippets of cer
tain texts but the original lawsuits were concerned
that these passages infringed on copyright laws.
"What the publishers are concerned about is los
ing control over their revenue streams," Herkovic
said. "Once the book is out of print, no one is making
any money off of that book at all unless it goes into a
new edition. The publishers and authors are worried
that somebody had figured out away to make money
off of their stuff after it left their hands that some
body was Google."
Stanford, along with several other institutions like
Harvard, Oxford, the University of Michigan and the
New York Public Library, primarily intend to use
Google Books as a means to preserve historical texts
and give their patrons increased access to scholarly
works. But Google's pet project could also give them
more opportunity for text mining, or the ability to
better measure word frequency and sentence struc
ture in particular texts, Herkovic said.
Chin rejected the settlement in order to prevent
Google from having a monopoly on the e-book in
dustry. Such monopoly power would provide unfair
protection for the Internet giant from competition.
In his ruling, Chin suggested that Google create an
"opt-in" policy instead of its current "opt-out" policy
for authors and publishers.
But Herkovic asserted that such a policy would
provide a significant logistical challenge. He added
that some questions have been left unanswered.
For instance, Google's recent lawsuit brought to a
light an important question regard
ing the copyright laws of "orphan
books," or books with unknown
copyright holders. These books,
Herkovic said, were most likely
published after 1922 and before
1972. While the majority of these
books are currently in libraries, the
lawsuit has generated unanswered
questions regarding the copyright
laws related to these orphan books.
The subsequent steps for
Google remain to be seen. Both
Google and the American Publish

er's Association declined to com
ment to The Daily. Hillary Ware,
Google's managing Counsel has
publicly revealed that Google
would continue to pursue its cre
ation of a worldwide online library
and bookstore.
"Like many others, we believe
this agreement has the potential to
open-up access to millions of books
that are currently hard to find in the
U.S. today," Ware said. "Regardless
of the outcome, we'll continue to
work to make more of the world's
books discoverable online through
Google Books and Google
eßooks."
