## Students boost GPA in just 60 minutes 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford study published in
Science magazine earlier this
month suggests that a simple one
hour session in confidence build
ing can boost both the academic
and emotional well-being of
African-American college fresh
men perhaps even enough to
curb the nation's achievement
gaps.
The study's co-authors, psychol
ogy professor Geoffrey Cohen and
assistant professor Greg Walton,
conducted their intervention pro
gram at a "selective university"
over a seven-year period ending in

2008. Walton declined to identify
the institution for confidentiality
reasons.
The intervention's one-hour ex
ercise provided 49 African-Ameri
can and 43 European-American
students with a narrative that de
scribed anxieties as "shared and
short-lived," before requiring
them to write essays and deliver
speeches expressing this senti
ment. Participants also completed
daily surveys for a week thereafter.
Walton and Cohen focused on
avoiding the implication that stu
dents were in need of help, and in
stead encouraged participants to
view the problems of freshman
year as challenges faced by every
one.

"It's normal for students to
have ups and downs," Walton said.
He emphasized that the transi
tion is difficult for everybody, "not
just members of groups that aren't
represented well in academic set
tings."
But the researchers said mi
nority students are more likely to
blame themselves, rather than
environmental factors, for
problems they encounter. *â– 
After tracking academic
performance, for which stu
dents gave researchers access
to their transcripts, results showed
an increase in the academic per
formance of black students partici
pating in the intervention over the
first three years of college com

pared to the control group.
More importantly, by senior
year, the achievement gap between
the African-American and Euro
