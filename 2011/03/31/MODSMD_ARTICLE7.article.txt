## Students boost GPA in just 60 minutes 
### MARY ANN TOMAN-MILLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A Stanford study published in
Science magazine earlier this
month suggests that a simple one
hour session in confidence build
ing can boost both the academic
and emotional well-being of
African-American college fresh
men perhaps even enough to
curb the nation's achievement
gaps.
The study's co-authors, psychol
ogy professor Geoffrey Cohen and
assistant professor Greg Walton,
conducted their intervention pro
gram at a "selective university"
over a seven-year period ending in

2008. Walton declined to identify
the institution for confidentiality
reasons.
The intervention's one-hour ex
ercise provided 49 African-Ameri
can and 43 European-American
students with a narrative that de
scribed anxieties as "shared and
short-lived," before requiring
them to write essays and deliver
speeches expressing this senti
ment. Participants also completed
daily surveys for a week thereafter.
Walton and Cohen focused on
avoiding the implication that stu
dents were in need of help, and in
stead encouraged participants to
view the problems of freshman
year as challenges faced by every
one.

"It's normal for students to
have ups and downs," Walton said.
He emphasized that the transi
tion is difficult for everybody, "not
just members of groups that aren't
represented well in academic set
tings."
But the researchers said mi
nority students are more likely to
blame themselves, rather than
environmental factors, for
problems they encounter. *■
After tracking academic
performance, for which stu
dents gave researchers access
to their transcripts, results showed
an increase in the academic per
formance of black students partici
pating in the intervention over the
first three years of college com

pared to the control group.
More importantly, by senior
year, the achievement gap between
the African-American and Euro

pean-American experimental
groups had been reduced by almost
80 percent.
However, more than 80 percent
of the intervention's participants
were skeptical, and only 8 percent
even remembered it when they
were evaluated at graduation
three years later. Walton said
these reactions were good, be
cause the beneficial effect did not
require "conscious awareness."
"The intervention affects how
people encode ongoing personal
experiences, preventing them
from having global responses to
events," he said.

Walton added that the study
raises fundamental questions as to
how freshman orientations should
be conducted, stressing that an
emphasis on school pride at some
universities can actually stand in
the way of these programs.
This is especially true because
freshman year can "set the tone
for the rest of one's academic ex
perience," Cohen said.
"It's important to identify with
your school," he said. "But if that's
the only thing that people get from
orientation, it doesn't prepare
them well when problems arise."
Such sentiments are heard loud
and clear on the Farm, where Wal
ton and Cohen's study may lead to
changes in Stanford's annual
freshman welcome, New Student
Orientation (NSO).
"We are very excited about

professor Walton's research and
have actually been in conversa
tion with him over the past few
years about how to augment our
programming efforts," said Julie
Lythcott-Haims, dean of fresh
man and transfer students.
"Whether NSO is the right venue
or not is an open question. The
concept of a 'Stanford 101 cur
riculum,' currently in the devel
opmental phase, may be a better
vehicle for delivering such mes
sages [and] experiences."
Meanwhile, Walton said similar
interventions, which are already
showing the same promising re
sults, are currently in progress for
women in engineering and His
panic-American students.
