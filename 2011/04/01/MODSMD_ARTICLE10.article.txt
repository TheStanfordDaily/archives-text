## Faculty Senate addresses Peking Center 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Three topics of discussion took
the spotlight at the Faculty Senate's
Mar. 31 meeting: the Stanford Re
search Center at Beijing, earthquake
preparedness and innovative cur
riculum design.
The Senate's first order of busi
ness was to address the development
of a state-of-the-art research facility
in China, situated at the heart of
Peking University. According to
Coit Blacker, senior fellow at the
Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI), the
push for this facility began in earnest
in 2007.
Blacker said the University re
ceived "an intriguing offer from the
leadership at PKU," shorthand for
Peking University. The PKU leader
ship has been very open to maintain
ing an ongoing relationship with
Stanford, a circumstance that Black
er described as quite unique.
"The way things work in China is

nothing like this comes about acci
dentally," he said, alluding to the fact
that decisions of this nature tend to
involve very senior-level leadership
in the country.
The construction project, in fact,
has already made some headway.
"We broke ground in the fall of
2010 and we anticipate that we could
start to move in as early as late 2011
or early 2012," Blacker said. "Stan
ford will have exclusive use of the
space."
"In fact, no other American insti
tution of higher learning has or is
likely to have a presence on cam
pus," he added.
FSI has been tasked with manag
ing the Stanford Research Center in
Beijing on behalf of the University.
Political science professor Jean Oi,
who is also a FSI senior fellow, said
the new center would serve multiple
functions.

"BOSP is going to remain the an
chor program for the center," Oi
said.

The facility is meant to "enrich
the environment in which the BOSP
students will be spending their quar
ter," she said.
It also opens up the opportunity
to accommodate graduate students
in addition to the undergrads for
whom Beijing is already a popular
overseas studies location. The Stan
ford-Peking center will serve all
seven schools and provides accessi
ble case rooms, teleconferencing fa
cilities and many other amenities.
Following this decision, Ann
Arvin, vice provost and dean of re
search, touched upon the topic of
earthquake preparedness on cam
pus. Stanford currently boasts seis
mic mitigation, potable water and
food, emergency, core IT backup and
fire sprinklers.
But more could be done, Arvin
said. She underscored, in particular,
the "Protect SU Program," which
aims to provide nonstructural equip
ment loss mitigation. The program
pertains to the potential loss of re
search data, sample specimen and
research laboratory equipment in
the event of an earthquake.
The proposed equipment seismic
mitigation program would focus on
equipment valued at more than
$20,000 per item. Arvin concluded by
imparting advice on what individual
principal investigators (Pis) could do
to protect their research.
The Senate meeting wrapped up
with a panel discussion on innova
tive curriculum design at Stanford.
Computer science professor
Daphne Koller spoke extensively on
using virtual learning at Stanford,
arguing that some courses could
move from "frontal" instruction to
online instruction. Assistant profes
sor of history Edith Sheffer used
avatars in her history course to help
students "develop skills in perspec

tive shifting." Banny Banerjee, asso
ciate professor of mechanical engi
neering, emphasized the need for
"scaled, rapid and systemic transfor
mations" in the way today's chal
lenges are approached.
