The Graduate School of Business

Counselor to the Secretary of the
Treasury, will be the alumni speaker
at its graduation ceremony on June

responsible for supervising the $7OO
billion Troubled Asset Relief Pro
gram. He is also a former president
and chief operating officer at Merrill
Lynch and CEO of pension fund

Allison was chosen from a list of
potential speakers suggested by
GSB students because his post-grad
uation experiences "stand as an ex

lives, change organizations, change
the world," said GSB Dean Garth
Saloner in a press release.
Prior to his time at Stanford, Alli
son served four years as a naval offi
cer and spent one year in Vietnam.
After several years of working in fi

help start Merrill Lynch's first busi
ness in a domestic capital market
outside of the United States. He also

was the National Finance Chairman
for John McCain's 2000 presidential
campaign.
Allison also chaired the GSB's
Advisory Council between 1999 and
2001 and won the GSB's Excellence
in Leadership Award in 2005 for his
decades of visionary service.
