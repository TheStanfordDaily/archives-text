## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Tyler Brown 
The League of American Bicy
clists (LAB) recently awarded the
top "platinum" award to Stanford
for bike friendliness. Stanford was
the only institution among 20 col
leges and universities surveyed to re
ceive the highest award, ranking
ahead of "gold" winners UC-Davis
and UC-Santa Barbara. According
to the LAB website, schools were
judged based on infrastructure built
to promote cycling, available educa
tion programs for cyclists, university
efforts to encourage biking, law en
forcement involvement and plans
for the future.
The award is part of the League's
"Bike Friendly University" program,
which was launched in October and
aims to recognize and support bicy
cle-friendly college campuses.

Initiatives that led to Stanford's
award included bike safety classes,
helmet discounts and programs for
cited cyclists to take a class instead
of paying a fine. Another commend
able factor was the University's
"commute club," which encourages
faculty, staff and students to travel
to campus more efficiently.
Ariadne Scott, bicycle program
coordinator, said in an interview
with Bikeßadar.com that the "Uni
versity's employee drive-alone rate
dropped from 72 percent in 2002 to
48 percent in 2010."
"[The] bike commute rate for
university commuters is 21.7 per
cent," she said.
