## EDITORIAL Make Downtown Vibrant 
### 
As Stanford faculty mem
bers and students looking
to live off campus can at
test, land in Palo Alto is a precious
commodity. With an average home
price of $1.4 million and a down
town vacancy rate of just 2 percent,
Palo Alto drives away many
prospective residents and entre
preneurs. The benefits of living or
starting a business in Palo Alto,
such as proximity to a highly edu
cated workforce, good schools,
Stanford, numerous leading firms,
good weather and access to San
Francisco, are often cited as rea
sons for Palo Alto's high prices.
However, this is only half the story.
Commercial and residential space
in Palo Alto and at Stanford are se
verely limited by zoning and densi
ty regulations, which keep develop
ers from providing valuable hous
ing and office space. Stanford and
Palo Alto need to work harder to
ensure that their unique economic
engine does not become a casualty
of artificially inflated real estate
prices.

Restrictions on density take
many forms. In downtown Palo
Alto, building height is limited to 50
feet, and developers must provide
parking for workers or tenants. The
goal of density restrictions is
twofold: to help keep traffic man
ageable, and to maintain a small
town feel. Unfortunately, the costs
of such policies are often underem
phasized in public discourse. More
businesses and residents would
mean a larger tax base for the city,
which would allow the government
to reduce taxes or expand services.
With Palo Alto's budget deficit
projected to be $3O million in 2011,
the city cannot afford to keep turn
ing away would-be residents and
business owners.

Taxpayers and the city govern
ment would not be the only benefi
ciaries of greater density in Palo
Alto. High local housing prices
force Stanford to house over 90
percent of undergraduates and ex
pend vast resources on providing
below-market price housing for
faculty members and graduate stu
dents. In spite of these efforts, many
faculty members (and most of the
universities lower-skilled labor
force) must make long commutes
from cheaper areas. Allowing more
downtown density would help alle
viate this problem.

Stanford and Palo Alto both de
rive large benefits from the pres
ence of high-tech, high-wage firms
in the area. These firms face the
same problem that Stanford does

when it comes to housing workers,
but unlike Stanford, they usually
do not have the resources to subsi
dize housing for employees. This
creates a powerful incentive for
firms to leave the area, which is a
bad outcome for everyone in
volved.

The challenge facing Palo Alto and
Stanford is how to provide more
space for businesses, workers and
university functions in a responsi
ble way. The first step should be to
loosen restrictions on building
height and density in the down
town area, especially near the Palo
Alto Transit Center where car use

can be mitigated. A higher concen
tration of retail and grocery stores
in the area would make downtown
more pedestrian friendly, ensuring
that roads remain passable. More
public transportation ridership
would also allow government
agencies to lower subsidies for
buses and Caltrain.

In addition to providing more
aggregate housing and office space,
downtown development will also
ease demand for new construction
in other sensitive areas. For exam
ple, Stanford's driving range, which
is heavily used by golfers both with
in and beyond the Stanford com
munity, will eventually need to be
moved to comply with current zon
ing regulations and make room for
new housing. The driving range
would likely be moved to the cur
rent location of Stanford's Com
munity Farm, a valuable area used
both to connect students to their
food system and teach them about
agriculture and soil science.

Stanford and Palo Alto have re
cently made several steps towards
increasing economic activity in the
downtown area. Stanford's pro
posed $3 billion expansion of the
Stanford Hospital will include Cal
train Go Passes for all current and
future employees. Palo Alto will
also likely see the construction of a
new five-story building with office
and residential space near the tran
sit center. The new building would
provide public art, a garden and
electrical vehicle charging stations
in return for permission to exceed
Palo Alto's 50-foot height limit.
Hopefully these new develop
ments are the start of a trend that
will reverse the exclusive atmos
phere of Palo Alto and allow both
the town and the university to
grow. Stanford should continue, as
it did during the debate over the ex
pansion of the Stanford Hospital,
to push for the conscientious ex
pansion of worthwhile projects.
