# OP-ED
## Cowardice, Co-optation, and ROTC 
### ZACHARY WARMA '11 
At Tuesday night's Under
graduate Senate meeting.
Senator Ben Jensen 'l2
deemed it appropriate to make an
analogy between the upcoming
ROTC ballot measure and a hypo
thetical vote on allowing the Klu
Klux Klan onto campus. Coupled
with the recently launched "Cam
paign to Abstain," urging voters to
abstain on the grounds of civil rights
on said ballot measure, I have had

enough.
Let's begin with the fact that I
watched with joy on C-SPAN as
DADT was voted off the legislative
rolls this past fall. I was one of the
drivers who fliered Bay Area uni
versities and then sat in the Circle of
Death to protest the passage of
Proposition 8. And I am no doubt
one of numerous individuals who
supports open service for transgen
der people. I also, however, support
ROTC's return to Stanford Univer
sity.

The United States military being
likened to the Klan means it is high
time we begin setting the record
straight. This controversy, which in
cludes the ballot measure, the Con
stitutional Council case, the Senate

prattling and now the 'Campaign to
Abstain" this has nothing to do
with ROTC. What we have wit
nessed this year is the co-optation
and exploitation of Stanford's polit
ical and governmental processes by

... two dozen, at most, students
looking for a very public political
power grab at the expense of
ROTC, reasonable discourse and
the greater student body. The lead
ership of SSQL, sympathizers in the
"Women's" Coalition, Stanford De
mocrats and SOCC has missed an
opportunity to foster a productive
dialogue on the matter, choosing in
stead to wage an emotionally
charged battle based off of specious
claims.

Earlier this year, SSQL decided
it wanted Stanford to talk about
"privilege." I say let's do it. Let's
talk about Stanford privilege, of our
god-given right to accuse the Unit
ed States military of any known so
cietal ill, free of actual implications.
Let's talk about our acute discon
nect to the realities of the world at
large. Please, take a minute and
think how Sanford is one of the only
places where such a debate could
even possibly occur. Given that

ROTC cadets are forbidden to dis
cuss any of these issues, the fringe
has been allowed to dominate the
tenor and content of this debate.

To haphazardly denigrate the
military (given that SSQL is openly,
and unabashedly anti-military re
gardless its stance on LGBTQ is
sues) is not only ignorant, but also
damaging to the long-term intellec
tual vibrancy of Stanford and the
nation we hopefully choose to bet
ter. Stanford's educational mission
would be failed if the Farm were to
churn out America's "next great
leaders" who lack any knowledge or
understanding of the armed forces.
Lastly, it is important to reflect
on the cowardice of the "Campaign
to Abstain." The saber-rattling hard
liners failed with the Constitutional
Council Case, failed to overturn the
ballot question in the Senate and
will undoubtedly fail next week
once ballots are cast. Instead of
campaigning openly against ROTC
(because once again, this is not
about ROTC), the "Campaign to
Abstain" has been launched. I chal
lenge those supporting the cam
paign, particularly those looking
for sheer political advantage if
you believe this is an issue of civil
rights, vote no. Stand up, and vote
no on ROTC. Vote no based on
your beliefs, just as I will cast a yes
vote because of mine. If you cannot
do that, then I say it's time to stop
disseminating distortions, and let
the student body finally have a
chance to be heard.
