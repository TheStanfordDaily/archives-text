## The 						Walk-By 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
You're walking somewhere on
campus, by yourself and on
the go. You glance ahead and
see that girl you kind of know (yes, it
could be a boy, too). Was she in sec
tion with you that one time? No, she
must've been your friend's room
mate. Or, wait, maybe you met her at
the party last night? Ah, but you
probably don't remember much
about that night anyway ...
So what do you do? Option 1: ig
nore her. Avert your eyes, either by
staring in a different direction or
pulling out some distraction. Your
best bet is your phone. You take it out
and immediately start a text message
to whoever, anybody, maybe even
mom. Thirty seconds later you look
up, she's gone and you're off the
hook. It doesn't matter if you knew
her or how you knew her, whether

you hooked up or worked on a group
project together. She's gone.
Let's say you're feeling a little
more courageous. Option 2: give her
some eye contact. You can do it fleet
ingly, occasionally looking in another
direction, or stare intently towards
her as she passes you. If she isn't busy
completely ignoring you or actually
busy, there's a good chance that your
eyes will meet.
Once this happens, there are sev
eral more possibilities. You might
both immediately look away, simul
taneously remembering that ill-fated
hookup in the computer cluster. You
may each linger momentarily before
someone breaks the stare, a mutual
lack of recognition. Alternatively,
after all that effort, your eyes will
meet and you will politely smile at
each other, whether in acknowledge
ment of a prior introduction or not.
Then there's always Option 3: go
big. She walks by, and without wait
ing for her to do anything, you say,
"Hey! What's up?"
Some of you readers may be
thinking, "What the eff? Why would I
just say hi to some random girl who I
might not even know?" But instead,
ask yourself what you have to lose.
You say hey. The girl walks away
thinking, "Who is that weirdo?" and
forgets about it. The girl thinks, "Oh,
maybe that person thought I was
someone else" and forgets about it.
She might think, "Wow, what a nice
total stranger!" It's even possible that
she will be the guilty type and think,
"Oh no, I must know that person
from somewhere and clearly they re
member me but I don't remember
them! I'm such an awful person!"No
matter what, there's no long-term
damage to you.
Which option do you pick? Some
of you probably don't even think
about it. Some of you spend quite a
while the endless, agonizing sec
onds as you and this mysterious per
son walk towards each other won
dering which option to choose. And
probably most of you choose to ig
nore her. It's easier, it's safer, it's sim
pler.
But there are some good aspects of
Options 2 and 3, even if they appear to
be higher-risk options. Have you ever
waved to someone who looked a lot
like your friend and turned out to be
someone else? It's a little embarrass
ing. Have you ever jumped in the path
of a speeding bicycle because you

thought your friend was riding it and
would screech to a stop, only to real
ize, as you were about to be mowed
down, that the rider was not your
friend? That's embarrassing too. How
long does that embarrassment last?
Not long.
More lasting is the warm and
fuzzy feeling you'll get when some
one you don't know very well says hi
to you. This gesture says that you're
memorable, that you're worth a pass
ing hello. What if you walk by the
same person again? Pretty soon the
two of you will establish a pattern of
saying hello, and you'll get that warm
and fuzzy feeling all the time.
I had such an experience last
quarter. I saw one particular person
everywhere, always in the same part
of campus around Green, Olive's and
the History corner. I had vaguely met
her last year, but we had never really
spoken. After I walked by her consis
tently for a full week, I decided to try
something. The next time we passed
each other, I said hey. She looked a
little taken aback, but returned the
greeting.
That was the beginning of a beau
tiful passing friendship. We said
countless "heys" day in and day out.
We never stopped to chat, but the el
ementary greetings went a long way.
During Dead Week, I walked by her
while she was sitting down. The time
had come for something more than a
"hey." Yes, I was nervous. But I ap
proached and struck up a conversa
tion. Unsurprisingly the first thing we
said to each other was, "Dude, I see
you everywhere!" And there, from
nothing, grew a friendship that con
sists of reliable hellos whenever we
see each other. Perhaps next will
come a tentative lunch plan!
So the next time you walk by
someone, consider a greeting that
consists of more than averting your
eyes. You may not know her, you may
think you know him, but either way
there's no lasting harm from a "hey."

Miriam is looking for that warm and
fuzzy feeling. Send her a "hey " at mel
