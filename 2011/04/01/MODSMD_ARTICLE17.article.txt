## DOUBLE TROUBLE CARDINAL GETS HEAVY DOSE OF ARIZONA AT HOME 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After coming off a SoCal sweep last
weekend where it defeated top-ranked Pac
-10 rivals No. 6 UCLA and No. 14 USC, the
Cardinal looks ahead to another double
header weekend with matches against No. 13
Arizona State and No. 30 Arizona.

Just after finishing exams, the Cardinal
(17-0,4-0 Pac-10) aimed to continue its win
ning streak of 36 consecutive victories as it
traveled to Los Angeles during Stanford's
spring break. The women's team defeated
UCLA earlier in the season though the
match did not count toward Pac-10 standings
and sought a second win over the team
that last handed them defeat in February of
2010.

For sophomore Stacey Tan, this match
was especially meaningful.
"Our loss last year to UCLA definitely
motivated me," Tan said. "It was a bit of a
grind for the team because of finals, but I felt
that everyone put in as much work as they
could to get ready for these matches and, for
tunately, the results turned out well."
Tan won both her matches on court five,
defeating UCLA's Courtney Dolehide as
well as her junior rival, USC's Alison Ramos,
in straight sets.

Stanford now looks forward to welcom
ing the Arizona schools on its home courts.
Preparation will be paramount for the Car
dinal if it wishes to continue its perfect sea
son. Junior Veronica Li explains the recent
focus on conditioning.
"We are definitely working harder on our fit
ness than we have in the past months simply
due to the fact that we are starting a new
quarter and have just returned from spring
break road matches," she said. "Everyone
has been busy the past two weeks, and get
ting back up to speed is important. Techni
cally and strategically speaking, we've main
tained the same focused mentality that we
always have."
The first match will be against the Ari
zona State Sun Devils (13-3,3-0 Pac-10) on
Friday. Despite coasting past them 6-1 in last
season's match up, the Sun Devils are anoth
er team undefeated in the Pac-10 and boast
two players ranked in the top 20.
"Arizona State should be a tougher
match, Li said. "Their team is very feisty and
really loud. I think it will be different playing
them on our home courts. We have to be
aware of their toughness and respond by
being vocal, supportive and energetic."
On Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal will
face the Arizona Wildcats (15-4,2-1 Pac-10),
a team it also defeated 6-1 in last year's face
off. Despite the seemingly lop-sided score, Li
remembers the match actually being a turn
ing point in the Cardinal's season.
"I remember playing in very tough condi
tions against Arizona last year. It was defi
nitely a key moment for a lot of the players
on our team," she said. "It was windy and
some girls were down, but they fought and
pulled through in the end. I mean, I was very
impressed that day, and I'm hoping for some
great matches this weekend."
As of March 29, Stanford was once again

the No. 1 team in the country, as the Univer
sity of Florida whose single loss was to the
Cardinal at ITA National Indoors in Febru
ary fell back to No. 2.
Li knows that strength of schedule is a big
determinant in NCAA rankings, saying "It's
kind of ambiguous how the rankings are set,
but it has a lot to do with the ranking of the
teams that you beat. I think Florida has
played and defeated some higher ranked
teams."
However, Li affirms that rankings really

don't matter to the Stanford women.

"Honestly, we don't really talk about
rankings whether we are No. 1 or not," Li ex
plained. "What matters in the end is ulti
mately who is holding the NCAA trophy."
The weekend series will take place at the
Taube Tennis Stadium, where Stanford faces
Arizona State on Friday at 1:30 p.m. and Ari
zona on Saturday at noon.
