## Bowlsby Nominated for Athletic Director of the Year 
### – Miles Bennett-Smith 
Stanford's own Jaquish & Kenninger Di
rector of Athletics Bob Bowlsby was nominat
ed for Sportsßusiness Journal's Athletic Di
rector of the Year on March 14. The winner
will be announced at the fourth annual Sports
Business Awards ceremony in New York City
at the Marriott Marquis on Wednesday, May
18.

Bowlsby is one of five nominees for the
award, which is given to the top athletic direc
tor in the country and recognizes "outstanding
achievements in sports business from March
1,2010 through February 28,2011," according
to sportsbusinessdaily.com. All 73 nominees
across 15 different categories were selected by
a committee of the editorial staff from the
Sportsßusiness Journal.
The other nominees are Tim Curley of
Penn State, Chris Del Conte of Texas Christ
ian University, DeLoss Dodds of Texas and
Chris Hill of Utah.

After taking the reins at the Farm in April
2006 after 15 years at the University of lowa,
Bowlsby has seen the remarkable turnaround
by the football program, which won a school
record 12 games this season after losing 11
games just four years ago. He now oversees 35
intercollegiate varsity teams as well as the
physical education department, club sports
program and the Stanford Golf Course.

Stanford has also continued its dominance
of the Learfield Sports Directors' Cup under
Bowlsby, awarded to the top overall athletic
program in the country; Stanford won its 16th
straight Cup last spring.
