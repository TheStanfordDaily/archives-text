# TAKING OFF
## STANFORD OPENS FINAL FOUR AGAINST TEXAS A&M 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After battling through four tough rounds of
the NCAA tournament, the Stanford women's
basketball team heads to Indianapolis this
weekend to tackle its tallest test yet: the Final
Four.

The Cardinal pounded Gonzaga 83-60 to
reach its fourth consecutive Final Four, and the
next matchup for Stanford will be a bit unex
pected.

Texas A&M reached the Final Four for the
first time in the school's history by upsetting
No. 1 seed Baylor in the Dallas regional with a
58-46 victory, the first time that the Aggies had
beaten the Bears in four matchups this season.
Baylor presented a unique challenge with
6-foot-8 sophomore center Brittney Griner

roaming the paint, and Stanford had been
preparing for that test for several months now.
"Baylor is a Final Four caliber team, but it's
almost like musical chairs, you had five great
teams going for four spots," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I had felt from Janu
ary on that we were going to be in Baylor's
bracket."

Regardless of the somewhat surprising op
ponent, freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike
says the Aggies are not to be overlooked by
anyone.

"Any team in the Final Four is worthy of
being there," Ogwumike said. "I think we'll be
just as focused as we would be with any other
team."

The Aggies may not have the height of
Griner, but they present an interior challenge
as well, with powerful All-American forward

Danielle Adams anchoring the middle around
several guards that both VanDerveer and sen
ior guard Jeanette Pohlen described as "ath
letic" and "aggressive."

Adams averages 22.3 points and 8.6 re
bounds per game, both team highs, but the
guard play looks to be an important factor in
Sunday's game because the 6-foot-l Adams is
undersized compared to Stanford's front
court. Senior guard Sydney Colson averages
6.2 assists per game, the ninth-best average in
the nation, and junior guard Sydney Carter av
erages 10.5 points per game,
VanDerveer said that challenge will take a
lot of preparation, but she is up to the task.

Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen (23) had 17 points in Stanford's 83-60 victory over Gonzaga in the NCAA's Elite 8. Pohlen and fellow seniors Kayla Pedersen, Ashley Cimino, Hannah

what do we need to do?'" Van-
Derveer said. "I'm very focused on
preparation. We haven't played
A&M before, so we need to get to
know them."

The Cardinal players say they'll
take that need for intense prepara
tion with a special sense of pur
pose, motivated by the senior lead
ers who have never missed a Final
Four in their time wearing cardinal
and white.

"We're really focused and we're
really excited," Pohlen said.
"Though we do know that this is
our last chance at [winning a na
tional championship]."
Similarly, senior forward
Kayla Pedersen said that this
Cardinal team was more pre
pared for the task at hand than it
had been in years, but that came
with a caveat.

"We are in more control, and
we're more confident," Pedersen
said. "But I've been more anxious
because it is our last hurrah."

Before the Aggies can think
about getting past the Cardinal,
though, they'll have to get past the
Ogwumike sisters junior for
ward Nnemkadi and freshman for
ward Chiney.
Nnemkadi Ogwumike was
named the west regional's Most
Valuable Player after averaging 21
points and seven rebounds a game
in that portion of the tournament,
and Chiney Ogwumike averaged a
double-double, with averages of 17
points and 13 rebounds a game.
Pedersen credited Chiney, the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, with
giving the team an extra spark
throughout the tournament.
"Chiney brings a new dynamic
to our team ... I think freshness is
the perfect word," Pedersen said.
"That's the teammate and friend
you want at all times, and especially
going to battle with you."
In the end, the Cardinal said that
even in the midst of an already his
toric season, the preparation, hard
work and enthusiasm was focused
only on achieving the one win that
has eluded Stanford for the past
three years a national champi
onship.
"I would love that for our sen
iors and for our team," VanDerveer
said. "There was one [Stanford]

team once, in 1990, they didn't cut
down the net in the regional be
cause they wanted the Final Four

roaming the paint, and Stanford had been
preparing for that test for several months now.
"Baylor is a Final Four caliber team, but it's
almost like musical chairs, you had five great
teams going for four spots," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I had felt from Janu
ary on that we were going to be in Baylor's
bracket."

Regardless of the somewhat surprising op
ponent, freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike
says the Aggies are not to be overlooked by
anyone.

"Any team in the Final Four is worthy of
being there," Ogwumike said. "I think we'll be
just as focused as we would be with any other
team."

The Aggies may not have the height of
Griner, but they present an interior challenge
as well, with powerful All-American forward

Danielle Adams anchoring the middle around
several guards that both VanDerveer and sen
ior guard Jeanette Pohlen described as "ath
letic" and "aggressive."

Adams averages 22.3 points and 8.6 re
bounds per game, both team highs, but the
guard play looks to be an important factor in
Sunday's game because the 6-foot-l Adams is
undersized compared to Stanford's front
court. Senior guard Sydney Colson averages
6.2 assists per game, the ninth-best average in
the nation, and junior guard Sydney Carter av
erages 10.5 points per game,
VanDerveer said that challenge will take a
lot of preparation, but she is up to the task.
"I was up at 4:30 this morning watching
tape. I feel like I'm taking a businesswoman's

Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen (23) had 17 points in Stanford's 83-60 victory over Gonzaga in the NCAA's Elite 8. Pohlen and fellow seniors Kayla Pedersen, Ashley Cimino, Hannah
Donaghe and Ashley Cimino will all finish their college careers a perfect 4-4 with four Final Four appearances. Stanford must beat Texas A&M for a chance at their third national title.


approach, just saying 'Okay, so
what do we need to do?'" Van-
Derveer said. "I'm very focused on
preparation. We haven't played
A&M before, so we need to get to
know them."

The Cardinal players say they'll
take that need for intense prepara
tion with a special sense of pur
pose, motivated by the senior lead
ers who have never missed a Final
Four in their time wearing cardinal
and white.

"We're really focused and we're
really excited," Pohlen said.
"Though we do know that this is
our last chance at [winning a na
tional championship]."
Similarly, senior forward
Kayla Pedersen said that this
Cardinal team was more pre
pared for the task at hand than it
had been in years, but that came
with a caveat.

"We are in more control, and
we're more confident," Pedersen
said. "But I've been more anxious
because it is our last hurrah."

Before the Aggies can think
about getting past the Cardinal,
though, they'll have to get past the
Ogwumike sisters junior for
ward Nnemkadi and freshman for
ward Chiney.
Nnemkadi Ogwumike was
named the west regional's Most
Valuable Player after averaging 21
points and seven rebounds a game
in that portion of the tournament,
and Chiney Ogwumike averaged a
double-double, with averages of 17
points and 13 rebounds a game.
Pedersen credited Chiney, the
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, with
giving the team an extra spark
throughout the tournament.
"Chiney brings a new dynamic
to our team ... I think freshness is
the perfect word," Pedersen said.
"That's the teammate and friend
you want at all times, and especially
going to battle with you."
In the end, the Cardinal said that
even in the midst of an already his
toric season, the preparation, hard
work and enthusiasm was focused
only on achieving the one win that
has eluded Stanford for the past
three years a national champi
onship.
"I would love that for our sen
iors and for our team," VanDerveer
said. "There was one [Stanford]

team once, in 1990, they didn't cut
down the net in the regional be
cause they wanted the Final Four
net. We want the Final Four net."
The Cardinal and Aggies square off

on Sunday, April 3rd in Indy's Con

Senior forward Kayla Pedersen (14) dribbles past Gonzaga's Janelle
Bekkering (11) during the first half Stanford's Elite 8 victory last Monday in
Spokane. Pedersen is averaging a team-high 7.9 rebounds per game along
with 12.8 points per game. The Cardinal will rely heavily on their team
height to slow Texas A&M's strong frontcourt.
After battling through four tough rounds of
the NCAA tournament, the Stanford women's
basketball team heads to Indianapolis this
weekend to tackle its tallest test yet: the Final
Four.

The Cardinal pounded Gonzaga 83-60 to
reach its fourth consecutive Final Four, and the
next matchup for Stanford will be a bit unex
pected.

Texas A&M reached the Final Four for the
first time in the school's history by upsetting
No. 1 seed Baylor in the Dallas regional with a
58-46 victory, the first time that the Aggies had
beaten the Bears in four matchups this season.
Baylor presented a unique challenge with
6-foot-8 sophomore center Brittney Griner

roaming the paint, and Stanford had been
preparing for that test for several months now.
"Baylor is a Final Four caliber team, but it's
