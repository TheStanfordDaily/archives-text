## STANFORD OPENS FINAL FOUR AGAINST TEXAS A&M 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After battling through four tough rounds of
the NCAA tournament, the Stanford women's
basketball team heads to Indianapolis this
weekend to tackle its tallest test yet: the Final
Four.

The Cardinal pounded Gonzaga 83-60 to
reach its fourth consecutive Final Four, and the
next matchup for Stanford will be a bit unex
pected.

Texas A&M reached the Final Four for the
first time in the school's history by upsetting
No. 1 seed Baylor in the Dallas regional with a
58-46 victory, the first time that the Aggies had
beaten the Bears in four matchups this season.
Baylor presented a unique challenge with
6-foot-8 sophomore center Brittney Griner

roaming the paint, and Stanford had been
preparing for that test for several months now.
"Baylor is a Final Four caliber team, but it's
almost like musical chairs, you had five great
teams going for four spots," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "I had felt from Janu
ary on that we were going to be in Baylor's
bracket."

Regardless of the somewhat surprising op
ponent, freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike
says the Aggies are not to be overlooked by
anyone.

"Any team in the Final Four is worthy of
being there," Ogwumike said. "I think we'll be
just as focused as we would be with any other
team."

The Aggies may not have the height of
Griner, but they present an interior challenge
as well, with powerful All-American forward

Danielle Adams anchoring the middle around
several guards that both VanDerveer and sen
ior guard Jeanette Pohlen described as "ath
letic" and "aggressive."

Adams averages 22.3 points and 8.6 re
bounds per game, both team highs, but the
guard play looks to be an important factor in
Sunday's game because the 6-foot-l Adams is
undersized compared to Stanford's front
court. Senior guard Sydney Colson averages
6.2 assists per game, the ninth-best average in
the nation, and junior guard Sydney Carter av
erages 10.5 points per game,
VanDerveer said that challenge will take a
lot of preparation, but she is up to the task.
"I was up at 4:30 this morning watching
tape. I feel like I'm taking a businesswoman's
