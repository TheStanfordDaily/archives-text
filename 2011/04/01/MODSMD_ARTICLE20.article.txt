# Fan stuck on the sideline as rivals square off
## 
### Tom Taylor 
When filling out offi
cial forms, my eth
nicity always goes
down as plain old
white. But as odd as
it sounds, this week I was left wishing
I had some roots in the Indian sub
continent. On Wednesday, India and
Pakistan, the two giants from that
part of the world, squared off against
each other in the semi-finals of the
cricket World Cup in perhaps the
biggest game that will be played this
year in any sport, and I felt frustrating
ly neutral.
In terms of hype, this game had
everything. With cricket being a na
tional obsession in both countries,
over a billion Indians and close to 200
million Pakistanis may have tuned in,
making it a hot favorite for the most
watched sporting event in 2011. The
two teams had also been in great form
ahead of the match, both having beat
en the No. 1 team, three-time defend
ing champion Australia, along the
way.

In their homelands, the players are
absolute heroes. The phenomenal In
dian batsman Sachin Tendulkar has
set the bar so high for those who will
follow that his records may never be
touched; he is worshipped almost as a
god. He even holds the honorary rank
of Group Captain in the Indian Air
Force, despite having no military or
aviation background. On the other
side, the nickname of Pakistani cap
tain Shahid 'Boom Boom' Afridi, a
reference to his aggressive batting
style, has effectively spawned a new
brand of cricket gear, the logo of
which all Pakistani players now carry
on their shirts.

As if the game wasn't big enough,
the history of the two countries off the
field really adds spice to any con
frontation between them. When the
region gained independence from
British rule in 1947, it was torn apart
along broadly religious lines, sowing
the seed for ongoing hostility and four
wars (to date) between India and
Pakistan. There remain worldwide
concerns about the ongoing, and at
times violent, territorial dispute over
the future of Kashmir, since both
countries are nuclear powers.
In fact, the very setting of this tour
nament is a testament to the underly
ing problems in the region. It was sup

posed to be co-hosted by India,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan,
but in the wake of attacks by violent
extremists on the Sri Lankan team
during a tour to Pakistan in 2009, that
became impossible. Security fears
continue to prevent any international
cricket from even being played in
Pakistan, and its own team has been
forced to seek refuge abroad in order
to play 'home' games.
Mumbai, the location of the final
in India, has also seen its fair share of
these problems. In 2008, Pakistani
militants invading from across the sea
attacked several iconic parts of the
city, killing and injuring many. While
the vast majority of Pakistanis were
surely united with their Indian neigh
bors in feeling horrified by these
events, it is understandable if Mumbai
residents may have felt a little wary at
the possibility of Pakistan heading
that way for the final.
In the end, though, India won an inter
esting game in which the advantage
seemed to shift between the two until
the final hour or so. As a neutral, even
a reasonably informed one, it was
hard, though, not to feel a little distant
from the roller coaster emotions I

could see on the faces of the crowd. At
the end of the day I wanted to see a
close, exciting game with a few thrills
and spills, but I didn't really care who
won.

I have a few friends from India, but no
significant allegiance either way to
help me take a stand and throw the
full weight of my support behind one
or the other. I enjoyed the cricket, but
I can't help feeling that I missed what
made this game special, and it's not
one that'll stick in my memory. Being
a neutral fan is easy and painless be
cause you can just sit back and enjoy
the action without suffering the lows
of failure, but you also can't enjoy the
highs of victory. It's like watching a
great action movie with the sound
turned off Sure, you can pretty much
gather what's going on, but you'll
never really get what makes it great.

Tom Taylor makes it sound like he
merely enjoys cricket, but what he
didn't tell you is that he walked 10
miles to a pub to watch the game in a
blizzard; it was uphill both ways. To
