# MEN'S TENNIS
## CARD HOPING TO REBOUND 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
takes the court this weekend to play
two more nationally ranked oppo
nents No. 31 Tulsa and No. 56 Ari
zona.

The No. 12 Cardinal (9-5,1-1 Pac
-10) is coming off the toughest stretch
of its season. Its last eight matches
have all been against schools now
ranked among the top-20 teams in
the country.

Stanford head coach John
Whitlinger has repeatedly said that
he believes that the string of matches
against top competition can only
help his young team develop. Even
as the team has gone 2-5 in the past
seven contests, there have been
flashes of brilliance.

Last Friday, the Cardinal hung
tough with No. 2 USC. The Trojans
needed an unlikely third-set come
back to edge the Card, 4-2. Then, on
Saturday, the Cardinal blasted No. 16
UCLA, 6-1, showing a glimpse of the
dominant team Whitlinger believes
it can be.

When asked about the recent
tough matches, Whitlinger seemed
positive.

"Every match we lost, we were
close," he said. "And I think the guys
are confident that they can play with
anybody."
However, the numerous matches
against top opponents have taken
their toll on the team, and the scrap
py Tulsa team (14-5,5-0 Conference

USA) coming into town this after
noon is unlikely to offer much
respite.
The Tulsa Owls have dominated
Conference USA play, posting an
impressive 5-0 conference record.
The Owls have beaten top-10 teams
like No. 7 Texas and will be looking
for redemption after a disappointing
4-3 loss to in-state rival Oklahoma
last week.
Today's match has all the makings
of an upset.
Then, on Sunday, the Card travels
to Arizona to face off against the
Wildcats. Arizona (8-9,0-2 Pac-10) is
coming off a disappointing start to
conference play last week, losing at
Oregon and at Washington. The
Wildcats have perhaps underper
formed this season, but they will be
hoping to catch the Cardinal off
guard and notch their first confer
ence victory of the season.
The weekend stand is important
for setting the tone for the last month
of Stanford's regular season. Post
season play begins with the Pac-10
championships at the end of April, so
the team is running out of opportuni
ties to get back on the winning trail.
It is tough to say which Cardinal
team will show up. Will it be the em
battled squad that has played an end
less string of tough matches over the
past month, or will it be the team fans
saw last Saturday against UCLA?
The key may be how the Card
starts the matches.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Denis Lin has been struggling of late, but hopes to bounce
back as the No. 4 player in Stanford's lineup this weekend. The Cardinal
has lost five of the past seven matches, all against top-20 opponents, but
can right the ship with wins over No. 31 Tulsa and No. 56 Arizona.
Whitlinger and the team dis
cussed how they had gotten off to a
number of slow starts in the past
month, falling behind against teams
like USC, Baylor and Florida. That
pattern changed last Saturday
against UCLA.
"We talked about the impor
tance of getting a fast start before
the match," he said. "And the guys
came out and did it."
There have been a number of
consistent performers for the Cardi
nal.

Senior Greg Hirshman has post
ed an impressive 9-2 record at the
No. 5 spot with the type of reliable
play every team needs in the lower

half of the lineup to make a run in
the postseason come May.
The No. 1 doubles team of juniors
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher
continues to roll, winning their last
eight matches and the recent Pacific
Coast Doubles Tournament en
route to a 27-4 record.
However, players elsewhere
have been less consistent, and for
the Cardinal to make a run, other
players will need to step up.
The level of competition in the
season's final stretch should be less
intense, and this weekend's contests
may show what Stanford's young
team has learned from the topsy
turvy month it just endured.
Stanford faces Tulsa at 5 p.m.
today and Arizona State on Sunday
at noon.
