already. Intermission compiled some easy shenanigans to pull in case
you're looking to wreak some havoc.

Putting Saran <
Wrap over the
toilet seat

1

It's the classic prank: lift up the toilet seat, and stretch Saran
Wrap across it. Your buddy wakes up and goes to the bath
room. Crossness and hilarity ensue.

Putting Saran Wrap over
shampoo bottles and
toothpaste

2

Unscrew the caps of
shampoo bottles and
toothpaste, and place
Saran Wrap over the
openings. Replace caps.

Taping the
door shut

3

Using duct tape is always effective, as is
taping up toilet paper and using caution
tape. Another alternative: tying string to
two opposing doorknobs.

Moving
furniture

4

Hiding someone's stuff
is always fun. Disabled
bathrooms are good
storage spaces.

Challenge:
the numbered
animal trick

5

Should cost and logistics work
out for you, obtain three
sheep, cows or other suit
able farm animals.
Label them one,
two and four, and
place them in a pub
lic school area. Let uni
versity officials freak
out as they search
for number three.
