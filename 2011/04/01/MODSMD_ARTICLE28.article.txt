When Julian Casablancas took
the stage at last year's
Coachella Music Festival, he
cut a lonely figure. Surrounded by a sea of
people in the middle of the Indio desert,
Casablancas was lost. He launched imme
diately into cultivated hit "Hard to
Explain," but it wasn't the same. Gone

were the familiar faces of the other four
members of The Strokes, replaced with a
backing band providing the means for the
front man's stab at solo success.

Yet on his supposedly solo venture,
Casablancas lasted just one song before
referring back to his claim to fame. He
couldn't get away. None of them could.
In the span of five years since The
Strokes released their last album, "First

Impressions of Earth," the music world
waited to see if New York City's garage
rock messiahs would get on with it. With
side projects abound, people wondered if
the boys could rediscover the edge that fed
debut, "Is This It?," and put out another
release. Or would they simply go through
another year of disillusionment and feed
the continuing rumors of fall-outs and
break-ups?
Still, we didn't really think they'd end
it there. Did we?
Like Casablancas at Coachella, The

Strokes were unfinished and incomplete.
This couldn't be it. There was still so
much on the table: the band's lucrative
contract with RCA that mandated five
albums, the worldwide acclaim and, most
importantly, the seeming inability of any
member even Casablancas to match
the heights reached by the collective
whole.

"Angles," The Strokes' fourth LP, rep
resents the re-realization of the potential
of that collective whole and, at the same
time, the band's first steps in learning how
to be a band again. With all the band
members contributing to the writing
process Casablancas had been the pri
mary architect for the previous three
"operation make everyone satisfied" was a
cathartic, yet disjointed process. The

result? An album that recalls the best of
times but carries experimental lows that
mute what was supposed to be the band's

triumphant return.
It starts off strong enough, though.
"Machu Picchu," composed by lead gui
tarist Nick Valensi, showcases the band's
success when it does turn to collaboration.
Holding back the typically boisterous gui
tar interplay, the band develops a tropical
feel a la Cut Copy before Valensi shadows
Casablancas on the melodies an d the lead
