When Julian Casablancas took
the stage at last year's
Coachella Music Festival, he
cut a lonely figure. Surrounded by a sea of
people in the middle of the Indio desert,
Casablancas was lost. He launched imme
diately into cultivated hit "Hard to
Explain," but it wasn't the same. Gone

were the familiar faces of the other four
members of The Strokes, replaced with a
backing band providing the means for the
front man's stab at solo success.

Yet on his supposedly solo venture,
Casablancas lasted just one song before
referring back to his claim to fame. He
couldn't get away. None of them could.
In the span of five years since The
Strokes released their last album, "First

Impressions of Earth," the music world
waited to see if New York City's garage
rock messiahs would get on with it. With
side projects abound, people wondered if
the boys could rediscover the edge that fed
debut, "Is This It?," and put out another
release. Or would they simply go through
another year of disillusionment and feed
the continuing rumors of fall-outs and
break-ups?
Still, we didn't really think they'd end
it there. Did we?
Like Casablancas at Coachella, The

Strokes were unfinished and incomplete.
This couldn't be it. There was still so
much on the table: the band's lucrative
contract with RCA that mandated five
albums, the worldwide acclaim and, most
importantly, the seeming inability of any
member even Casablancas to match
the heights reached by the collective
whole.

"Angles," The Strokes' fourth LP, rep
resents the re-realization of the potential
of that collective whole and, at the same
time, the band's first steps in learning how
to be a band again. With all the band
members contributing to the writing
process Casablancas had been the pri
mary architect for the previous three
"operation make everyone satisfied" was a
cathartic, yet disjointed process. The

result? An album that recalls the best of
times but carries experimental lows that
mute what was supposed to be the band's

triumphant return.
It starts off strong enough, though.
"Machu Picchu," composed by lead gui
tarist Nick Valensi, showcases the band's
success when it does turn to collaboration.

tar interplay, the band develops a tropical

singer climaxes by shredding his typically rough vocals.
"Gratisfaction" also represents a victory for the band's
newfound sound trials, stealing a riff or two from "The
Boys Are Back In Town" as Casablancas calculatedly
stumbles over lines like, "He got punched in the mouth
for thinking 0f... living with his business."
But where the band stumbles on "Angles," it falls
hard. "Two Kinds of Happiness" is dreamt right out of
the 80s but ends up in a mix up of high hat, distorted
guitar and general clamor. "Games" is more of the same,
as a Nikolai Fraiture bassline steadies a repetitive chorus
that is eventually lost in the malaise. While Casablancas
can still write a great hook when he wants, the boringly
repetitive choruses featured on some cuts give the sense
that the songs were rushed to production before the
lyrics were given any true thought. If it's any consolation
though, there are synths by no means a Strokes tradi
tion that help fill in almost-there songs (see: "Life is
Simple in the Moonlight").
Slower cuts "You're So Right" and "Call Me Back"
prove to be "Angles'" nadirs, with the first, a B-side to the
album's first single, offering nothing more than robotic
layered vocals that belong on Casablancas' solo project,
not a Strokes album. The latter is more of the same odd
ball antics, with half-whispered lyrics that come off like a
failed Craigslist missed-connection listing.
"Angles'" victories, however, far outweigh the short
comings. "Taken for a Fool" rediscovers traditionalism
and mixes elements of the band's first two albums
Valensi intertwined with Albert Hammond jr., sharp

lyrics and Fab
Moretti's rapid-fire
drum fills to dev
astating effect. And if
you thought the band
was washed up, give
single "Under Cover
of Darkness" a shot.
Having crashed the
band's website as a
free giveaway a
month ago, the song's
call and response
between Casablancas
and the lead guitar
feeds off an energy
that seemed to have
been pent up for the
last five years. And
after starting the

recording of their fifth album, The Strokes will have to
rediscover that mentality on a consistent basis. Nobody's
going to wait around for half a decade again.

Slower cuts
'You're So Right'
and 'Call Me
Back' prove to
be 'Angles'
nadirs.
