Tonight, between 6:30 and 10:30 p.m., head up the hill to
FloMo Field for the first ever Hilltop Music Festival. The
Stanford Concert Network, in conjunction with Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Theta Delta Chi and Kappa Sigma, is bringing some big
names to campus for a night of awesome music.
Headlining Hilltop is Andre Nickatina, the famous Bay Area
rap artist. Though Nickatina doesn't usually do campus shows, "he
heard the name Stanford and fell in love with the idea," said Alberto
Aroeste 'l3, SCN's head coordinator for Hilltop Music Fest.
Aroeste, also a brother at SAE, sees Hilltop as a big step for the
Stanford Concert Network, which has received criticism in the past.
"We're aware of what people want, and we're getting there little
by little, showing [Stanford] that we're legitimate," Aroeste said.
In addition to Andre Nickatina, other Bay Area rappers Smoov-
E, Cryptic Wisdom, Raider Dave and Mumbls will be performing
along with American Royalty and Desert Dolls. American Royalty is

a "rock, psychadelic
DJ" duo that was
recently mentioned by
electronic music blog
Gotta Dance Dirty as a
top up-and-coming
performer. American
Royalty has opened for
LA's Halloween Hard
Fest, combining rock
with DJ-ing and syn
thesizers for a unique,
electric rock sound.
Desert Dolls, a group
from Mexico City
about to launch their
first tour, will be mak
ing their international
debut at the Hilltop
Music Festival.
"Come in your
tanks and shades,"

Aroeste said. He sees Hilltop as a chance for undergrads to "come
out and have fun with each other and enjoy the first weekend back."
Like Snowchella, Hilltop Music Festival will be alcohol free, but any
one is welcome to bring their grills up to FloMo Field for some bar
becuing before the concert. And be sure to bring some cash tonight
so you can pick up an official Hilltop Music Festival t-shirt for $2O.
Hilltop Music Festival is brought to you by Aroeste and a full
team of fraternity members, including Theta Delt's Cody Sam 'l2
and Mark Frykman 'll, Kappa Sig's Jeremy Fine 'l3 and Josh Stone
'l3, SAE's Max Oswald 'l2 and Stanford Concert Network execu
tives, President Adam Pharr 'll and Tech Director David Kettler 'll.
