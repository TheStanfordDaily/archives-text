# Road to Pac- 10 crown starts in WA
## Stanford pins title hopes on youth 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
After enduring one of the
toughest non-conference sched
ules in the nation, the No. 11 Stan
ford men's baseball team has no
time to rest as it begins confer
ence play this weekend in the Pac
-10, generally regarded as the best
conference in collegiate baseball.
Riding a three-game winning
streak, the Cardinal (11-6) travels

to Pullman, Wash, to face the
Washington State Cougars (10-
10) for a three-game series start
ing Friday.

Stanford took the final two
games from Long Beach State
over the weekend behind a strong
pitching performance by junior
Jordan Pries on Saturday and a
Herculean effort by the bullpen
on Sunday. After sophomore
starter Dean McArdle failed to
escape the first inning, freshman
reliever A.J. Vanegas and juniors
Scott Snodgress and Chris Reed
combined for 8.1 innings of one
run baseball.

On Tuesday, Stanford commit
ted six errors, including four by

usually sure-handed sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger, but
was able to survive a scare from
Saint Mary's.
To beat the Cougars though,
the Cardinal will need to perform
better on both sides of the ball.

"We've been hitting the ball
pretty well, but we need to play
better defense," said designated
hitter Ben Clowe, who added two
hits in the win over the Gaels.

Washington State has had an
up-and-down season thus far. The
Cougars sandwiched a six-game
skid between a four-game win
ning streak and a 17-11 slugfest
over a tough Gonzaga team.
Stanford and Washington

State share one common oppo
nent: Cal. Wazzu opened its Pac
-10 season in Berkeley against the
No. 16 Golden Bears this past
weekend and though they lost all
three games, only one was a
blowout the series finale went
11 innings. The Cardinal defeated
the Bears on Feb. 22 at Sunken
Diamond in a 3-2 nail-biter.

Aside from both playing Cal,
however, Stanford and Washing
ton State's schedules differ great
ly. The Cardinal has played three
series against teams ranked in the
top-20 nationally, including two in
the top-lO.The only ranked team
