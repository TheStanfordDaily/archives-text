We didn't know what we
were getting into.
Upon picking up our South by
Southwest (SXSW) press passes at
the Austin Convention Center, we
were handed a booklet that listed all
of the evening musical showcases. It
was mainly organized by venue, of
which there were... 79. Each loca
tion had five to seven acts per night.
You do the math. That's before you
add in the daylong events where
dozens of acts would perform at par
ties hosted by everyone from MTV
to Rachel Ray. Overwhelmed? So
were we, and even after we narrowed
down the list of groups and musi
cians to the ones we were most des
perate to see, we still recognized that
we could not be in 14 places at once.
We missed Kanye, The Strokes, TV
on the Radio, 8.0.8 and more, and
that was fine we had to make
choices. We could use every column
inch of today's paper to review the
ludicrous number of groups we saw
over the five-day span; we don't have
that luxury. Here, then, is a snapshot.

Wu Tang Clan
For a trio of rap nerds, Wu Tang
was essential viewing. If you grew up
in New York, as two of us had, in the
late 1990s and early 2000s, and had

even a passing interest in hip-hop,
you listened to the Wu Tang Clan.
Your education was incomplete if

you ignored them. You felt it when
ODB died; "protect ya neck" was part
of your everyday lexicon; and you
knew that when you threw up a "W"
with your hands, it was palms out.
Needless to say, expectations
were high for their performance at
the Austin Music Hall. They were
only amplified when Childish
Gambino (better known as

"Community" actor Donald Glover)
told the crowd that the whole eight
person crew was there. We were in
for a treat.
Except, we kind of weren't.
That's not to say that Wu Tang was
bad. Far from it. They played the

hits; we rocked out. Ghostface Killah
in particular, well, killed it. But the
whole group, contrary to Glover's
claims, wasn't there, and there was
something strange and slightly off
putting about seeing U-God per
form the lyrics of the absent Method
Man. Throw in Wu Tang's persistent,

public complaints about the sound
system which was fine, and didn't
seem to bother any of the previous
acts and it made it, outside of the
effect of seeing legends in the flesh,
one of the more forgettable perform
ances of the trip.
Killer Mike
Here's what you need to know:
unlike many of the other major acts at
SXSW, Killer Mike was performing
numerous times per day, for a week.
We caught him on the last day of the
festival and the man's voice was, for
lack of a better term, shot. He was
honest with the crowd. He also, in

true rap titan fashion, promised that
it wouldn't deter him. And it didn't.
He started with his own rendition of
Bone Crusher's "Never Scared" (he's a
guest artist on the original track), a
song that's as fiery and in-your-face

(read: damn near screaming) as a hip
hop artist is going to perform. And
then just when you think he's wearing
down (remember, too, that it's 85
degrees outside and he's performing
under bright lights), he goes without
a beat, just vocals, so you don't think
he's covering up his fading voice. He is
a true virtuoso. That is all.

Zeds Dead

As delightful as 15 hours a day
of hip-hop can be, sometimes, one
needs a break Enter Zeds Dead, a
dubstep DJ duo from Toronto that,
in just a couple of years of existence,
has made a significant splash in the
electronica world. That field, though,
can become decidedly monosyllabic
a beat drop here, a sample there,
and so on. What sets Zeds Dead

apart is the layers of not just an indi
vidual clip, but of an entire show
sure, you'll still bob your body to a
heavy bass, but you're doing it to
music that touches on a variety of
musical genres while simultaneously
presenting you with so much in each
individual second that by the time
you've processed what you've heard,

you've already been hit with a dozen
new sounds.
But perhaps most remarkable
about their performances was their
variation. We saw them at an under
ground bar on Friday and a major
club on Saturday. Their sets were
entirely different at each venue. Each
piece takes countless hours of pro
duction to prepare, but there was no
complacency to be found, and their
effect on the enthusiastic crowd was
the same.

Their club show, where they
were the direct opener for Moby, one
of the world's most famous DJs, was
cut short. They were disappointed
they still had a few more music styles
that they were eager to drop. It was
emblematic of their macro take on
an artistic form that some dismiss as
simply head-banging music. The
intricacies mattered.
For the record, they blew Moby
out of the water.
Machine Gun Kelly
One word: insanity.
Machine Gun Kelly, a heavily
tattooed rapper from Cleveland,
can't legally drink. But he can spit.
Fast. He got on stage at the Fader
day-party and confirmed what
everyone was thinking: namely, that
no one knew who he was. From



there, he took off, racing around
stage with his hype man and rapping
over the most hardcore of beats. He
was quick to rip off his shirt and
attempt to light it on fire; when that
failed, he climbed the speaker tower,
got on top, then leaned over back
ward, 15 feet above the crowd. His
enthusiasm was unparalleled.
But he was more than just a
showman. The speed with which
words flew out of Kelly's mouth was

remarkable, almost like how wait
for it a bullet comes out of a
machine gun. While that may not
seem like much, it is a discernible
skill. Some artists can rap in double
time in the studio, only to falter live
Trae the Truth, for instance, was
particularly disappointing in this
regard. But Kelly was like a young
YelaWolf immensely boastful
about his quick-paced flow, but with
the skills to back it up.

I'd hesitate to call him a break
out star of SXSW, but at the least,

hundreds people left the Fader event
thinking, "Who the hell was that
crazy white kid?"

When you're going up against
thousands of other acts, that might
just be a good enough impression.
