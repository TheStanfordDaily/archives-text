## RAPPERS WORTH THE TICKET 
### â€“ alex LESSINGER contact alex: intermission@stanforddaily. com 
I have a historical aversion to rap shows; although I prima
rily listen to hip hop, I tend to avoid going to concerts.
Unlike in other genres, there is no room for mediocrity
in a rap show. Simply put, when the performance consists of
a DJ and a guy with a microphone, if the rapper lacks a good
stage presence or stumbles over the lyrics, one's ability to
enjoy the artist again, even on record, is compromised.
For these reasons, when I attended South by Southwest
(SXSW) last spring, I went almost exclusively to indie rock
shows. Although they were fun, I left the shows disappointed
with myself for betraying my own musical tastes.
This year, our approach was a departure from what I did
in 2009 namely, we made an effort this time only to go to
the concerts of artists we actually listen to. I have had a grow
ing suspicion that I was missing out on fun shows and want
ed to see if my hypothesis was valid. Also, a large music festi
val is always a better testing ground than a year's worth of
random shows.

There were three artists in particular that we were most
excited about: Odd Future, Danny Brown and Lil B, all of

whom delivered strong stage shows, albeit in different ways.
Danny Brown, who just prior to the festival had signed
with Fool's Gold Records, turned out a classic virtuosic rap
performance, relying less on a hype man to carry his act and
more on his charisma, stage presence and lyrical ability to win
over the crowd.

The Odd Future show was somewhat confounding
the group members were obviously inexperienced performers
since they relied on a backing vocal track throughout their
set. That said, their collective

stage presence was undeniable,
and they drove the crowd into a
frenzy in away normally
reserved for teeny boppers and
hardcore bands. Regardless of
what you think of their con
troversial lyrical content, it is
impossible to leave one of
their shows without feeling
that something important just
happened.
Lil B, both on record

and on stage, is something of an enigma. Having put out
somewhere in the range of 3,000 songs in the last three years,
he manages to conduct his art in the theater of the absurd

whilst simultaneously managing not to alienate the core hip
hop audience. On stage, much is the same lacking a hype
man, it was his enthusiasm and unparalleled joy that won the
crowd over as much as his actual rapping. At one point, he
broke out in a fit of hysterical laughter, seemingly communi
cating the awe that overwhelmed him.
What occurred to me was that these emerging rappers,
along with a handful of slightly more established acts, were
more comfortable on stage than artists with their level of
experience usually are. It would be easy to reduce this to the
current industry dynamics. In an environment where rappers
are having great difficulty securing release dates, let alone sell
ing records, the only way to make rap an economically viable
profession is through touring revenue. This explains why
artists like Yelawolf or Killer Mike put so much effort into
their stage performances, but it fails to account for this new
wave of artists who are barely in their 20s, yet have such

refined stage personas.
The theory I developed is that new media such as
Twitter, Tumblr and You Tube, allow artists greater experience
in shaping and refining their artistic personas than they ever
could have been afforded 10 years ago. While it may seem that
they are newcomers to the scene, in reality they have all been
toiling away on the Internet refining their image and message
for years before we ever heard of them. Thus, by the time they
begin to hit the stage, they have far more experience perform
ing than one would ever think to credit them for. Engaging
one's fan base, be it on stage or on Twitter, helps a young

artist better understand what works and what doesn't. Hence,
by the time someone like Odd Future or Lil B appears at large
festival such as SXSW, he has a level of comfort with his artis
tic identity that was once only seen in veterans of the industry
who had been touring for years.
And so, my prior aversion to hearing rap artists live has
been quelled.
