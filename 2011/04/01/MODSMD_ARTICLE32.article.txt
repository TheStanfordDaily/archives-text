## MORE BLOOD, MORE HEART

-w- * -r-hen the idea arose of tak
l/l/ ing a quick pause from
T T our music coverage to
review one of the many films being
featured at South by Southwest
(SXSW), we immediately contacted
the publicity department at Magnolia
Pictures to track down whatever sick,
twisted and depraved geniuses were
behind "Hobo with a Shotgun."
The concept for "Hobo" is both
straightforward and enticing: a tech
nicolor saturated, balls-to-the-wall
homage to the B movie/exploitation
genre films of the 60s, 70s and 80s. In
a city where the system is broken, the
police corrupt and the majority of
citizens too scared to stand up to the
violence that befalls them, the city's
last hope will become a hobo (veter
an baddie Rutger Hauer) armed with
nothing but a sense of decency, a 12-
gauge shotgun and the love of a fall
en woman, battling masked thugs,
pedophile Santas and armor-clad

bounty hunters in a fight to the
death for both the city and his own
soul. As a fan of the genre, they had
me at "Hobo." Or maybe "shotgun."
Either way, nothing was going to
stop us from seeing this movie.

As it turned out, "Hobo" was
spearheaded by a young Canadian
director named Jason Eisener and his
producing partner, Rob Coterill. A
short version of "Hobo" won an

international trailer competition held
by Robert Rodriguez and was fea
tured in the original release of his
and Quentin Tarantino's ill-fated
(but irrefutably awesome) double

feature "Grindhouse." I had also been
a fan of another short they made for
the Internet, the hilarious

"Treevenge," wherein a family of
Christmas trees wreak bloody and
brutal revenge on their human

oppressors. Using the hype that their
short films created on sites like

You Tube and Vimeo, Eisener and
Coterill cleverly leveraged finance
from private investors and the
Canadian government to produce
the concept as a feature. The film has
resultantly enjoyed resounding suc
cess in the festival circuit includ-

ing a prominent feature at Sundance
in Park City and has also accrued
a massive Internet following for its
VOD release on April 1.

We caught up with Eisener and
Coterill at an Austin hotel to talk
about "Hobo" and exploitation film
in general. And, as it turned out,
that's what they were going for.
"They took the cheapest technol
ogy and most accessible technology
they could afford," Coterill said, "and
we did the same thing. We're in a new
time, but we took advantage of the
tools we had and we could exploit to
get as far as we could, as fast as we
could. We made this movie like they
made their movies: running around

the streets like mad, stealing locations,
do everything we could... to make
the movie what it had to be."

"'Hobo' very much comes from
that," Eisener said. "It all started from
us putting the trailer on You Tube,
and the reaction we were getting

fforn the audience. The mindset

going into the movie was: how can
we exploit that audience? Let's make,
kind of, a You Tube exploitation film.
How can we make a movie every
scene in the movie in away
where, if just one scene leaked
online, would hopefully go viral?"
We saw a screening that night;
not only did his film fulfill its prom
ise of high violence and cheap
laughs, but we were surprised to the
degree that every aspect of the movie
every actor, every gag, every hom
age went all out in the name of
fun. Great gore, incredible one-liners,
awesome music and a great look;
"Hobo" turned out to be a masterful
weaving of genre properties; of
action, comedy and, to our surprise,
a few moments of straight drama
and managed to do all of this, some
how, without forgetting the basic
rule that every movie has to wrap a
good plot around great characters if
it is to be really enjoyed. While
"Hobo" certainly doesn't carry any
discernable social message, it
reminds us without preaching that
not every movie needs to. Don't ask
me how Jason Eisener got me to care
so deeply about a hobo with a shot
gun. I don't know. If I did, I'd be

Jason Eisener. All I say is it's the most
fun I've had in a movie theater since
"Grindhouse." "Hobo" simply rocked.
We were lucky enough to catch
up with Eisener the next night at a
Wu Tang Clan concert. We talked
about the film, and he explained his

motto, "more blood, more heart"
Looking through the press kit for a
shot of Rutger (who was in Africa
during SXSW), I stumbled on its ori
gin. Apparently, in pre-production,
Jason affixed a sign to the back of his
office desktop as a memo to the

whole shoot crew: "More Blood,
More Nasty, More Dirt, More
Exploitation, More Heart, Your (sic)
Awesome and Have More Fun. Love
Jason Eisener." Maybe I misspoke, as
it seems safe to say the young direc
tor's secret is to simply drive all the
people working with him to rock out

as hard as they humanly can, and the
collective result is almost tangible.

Working as an assistant director in
New York, I've encountered a num
ber of smart young directors in my
past, each with their own complicat
ed and philosophy-laden manifestos
as to why the do what they do. But,
as far as these go, "more blood, more
heart" is the best I've heard yet.

we did the same thing. We're in a new
time, but we took advantage of the
tools we had and we could exploit to
get as far as we could, as fast as we
could. We made this movie like they
made their movies: running around

the streets like mad, stealing locations,
do everything we could... to make
the movie what it had to be."

"'Hobo' very much comes from
that," Eisener said. "It all started from
us putting the trailer on You Tube,
and the reaction we were getting

fforn the audience. The mindset

going into the movie was: how can
we exploit that audience? Let's make,
kind of, a You Tube exploitation film.
How can we make a movie every
scene in the movie in away
where, if just one scene leaked
online, would hopefully go viral?"
We saw a screening that night;
not only did his film fulfill its prom
ise of high violence and cheap
laughs, but we were surprised to the
degree that every aspect of the movie
every actor, every gag, every hom
age went all out in the name of
fun. Great gore, incredible one-liners,
awesome music and a great look;
"Hobo" turned out to be a masterful
weaving of genre properties; of
action, comedy and, to our surprise,
a few moments of straight drama
and managed to do all of this, some
how, without forgetting the basic
rule that every movie has to wrap a
good plot around great characters if
it is to be really enjoyed. While
"Hobo" certainly doesn't carry any
discernable social message, it
reminds us without preaching that
not every movie needs to. Don't ask
me how Jason Eisener got me to care
so deeply about a hobo with a shot
gun. I don't know. If I did, I'd be

Jason Eisener. All I say is it's the most
fun I've had in a movie theater since
"Grindhouse." "Hobo" simply rocked.
We were lucky enough to catch
up with Eisener the next night at a
Wu Tang Clan concert. We talked
about the film, and he explained his

motto, "more blood, more heart"
Looking through the press kit for a
shot of Rutger (who was in Africa
during SXSW), I stumbled on its ori
gin. Apparently, in pre-production,
Jason affixed a sign to the back of his
office desktop as a memo to the

whole shoot crew: "More Blood,
More Nasty, More Dirt, More
Exploitation, More Heart, Your (sic)
Awesome and Have More Fun. Love
Jason Eisener." Maybe I misspoke, as
it seems safe to say the young direc
tor's secret is to simply drive all the
people working with him to rock out

as hard as they humanly can, and the
collective result is almost tangible.

Working as an assistant director in
New York, I've encountered a num
ber of smart young directors in my
past, each with their own complicat
ed and philosophy-laden manifestos
as to why the do what they do. But,
as far as these go, "more blood, more
heart" is the best I've heard yet.

-w- * -r-hen the idea arose of tak
l/l/ ing a quick pause from
T T our music coverage to
review one of the many films being
featured at South by Southwest
(SXSW), we immediately contacted
the publicity department at Magnolia
Pictures to track down whatever sick,
twisted and depraved geniuses were
behind "Hobo with a Shotgun."
The concept for "Hobo" is both
straightforward and enticing: a tech
nicolor saturated, balls-to-the-wall
homage to the B movie/exploitation
genre films of the 60s, 70s and 80s. In
a city where the system is broken, the
police corrupt and the majority of
citizens too scared to stand up to the
violence that befalls them, the city's
last hope will become a hobo (veter
an baddie Rutger Hauer) armed with
nothing but a sense of decency, a 12-
gauge shotgun and the love of a fall
en woman, battling masked thugs,
pedophile Santas and armor-clad

bounty hunters in a fight to the
death for both the city and his own
soul. As a fan of the genre, they had
me at "Hobo." Or maybe "shotgun."
Either way, nothing was going to
stop us from seeing this movie.

As it turned out, "Hobo" was
spearheaded by a young Canadian
director named Jason Eisener and his
producing partner, Rob Coterill. A
short version of "Hobo" won an

international trailer competition held
by Robert Rodriguez and was fea
tured in the original release of his
and Quentin Tarantino's ill-fated
(but irrefutably awesome) double

feature "Grindhouse." I had also been
a fan of another short they made for
the Internet, the hilarious

"Treevenge," wherein a family of
Christmas trees wreak bloody and
brutal revenge on their human

oppressors. Using the hype that their
short films created on sites like

You Tube and Vimeo, Eisener and
Coterill cleverly leveraged finance
from private investors and the
Canadian government to produce
the concept as a feature. The film has
resultantly enjoyed resounding suc
cess in the festival circuit includ-

ing a prominent feature at Sundance
in Park City and has also accrued
a massive Internet following for its
VOD release on April 1.

We caught up with Eisener and
Coterill at an Austin hotel to talk
about "Hobo" and exploitation film
in general. And, as it turned out,
that's what they were going for.
"They took the cheapest technol
ogy and most accessible technology
they could afford," Coterill said, "and
we did the same thing. We're in a new
time, but we took advantage of the
tools we had and we could exploit to
get as far as we could, as fast as we
could. We made this movie like they
made their movies: running around

the streets like mad, stealing locations,
