## Senior A-lan Holt Scores with 8ball 
### â€“ holly FETTER contact holly: hfetter@stanford. edu 
A year ago, A-lan Holt 'll was driving through her
Los Angeles neighborhood, reflecting on the dev
astation of drugs. Today, she is celebrating the
debut of
"8ball," her original play about love and drugs in
South Central L.A.
The piece is a meditation on movement in two acts.
It shares the story of a young couple moving into a new
neighborhood and their interactions with an older cou
ple that refuses to move out. Poverty, forced eviction and
drug abuse compose the backdrop upon which we watch
the protagonists' relationships evolve.
"A year ago, it looked like one of those old grainy
films," Holt said, "but now it's so vibrant and alive."

Holt made her foray into playwriting as a sopho
more, after taking professor Cherrie Moraga's
"Introduction to Playwriting" course. She's also known
for her extraordinary poetry as a senior member of
the Spoken Word Collective, she has been writing and
performing original work for years. However, she finds
that theater can offer opportunities to explore themes too
big to fit in a few stanzas.

"What I love about playwriting is that you get to
spend a lot more time creating the world, the characters
and the situations," Holt said. "Poetry is good because
you can get a poem out in a day or a couple of hours, but
plays really take work, and I'm learning to appreciate
that."

But her penchant for poetry is not lost on this piece
the script is replete with poetic language and imagery.
"There are monologues that very well could be
poems, and many of them started off as poems," Holt
said. "A lot of the generative material for this play came
from poetry that I was writing with or without thoughts
of the play."
Her work obscures distinctions between traditional

and new, blending poetry and prose and working with
unusual design elements to complete the performance.
The set is sparse, featuring some austere furniture amidst
a conceptual design of concentric squares denoting
spaces in the play. The impressive soundtrack, created by
Tyler Brooks 'l4, is a gritty, groovy ode to pain and love.
But the simplicity of the set highlights the humanity
of Holt's characters. The abstract lights, sounds and stage
force the spectator to focus her attention on the love that
counteracts the chaos.

"On paper, 'BbalT is a play about the crack cocaine
epidemic in the 1980s, but really it's a play above love,
you know?" Holt said. "It's about being able to love others
and yourself despite having these really destructive and
traumatic experiences."

Amidst a city that is "just a bunch of thieves," we see
the love and dedication of a few humble heroes. Jan
Barker-Alexander, associate dean of students and director
of the Black Community Services Center, delivers a stellar
performance as a woman dealing with eviction and loss.
Victoria Asbury' 11 is undoubtedly the star of the show,
playing the part of the devoted, discerning wife of a star
ry-eyed drug dealer with such passion you'd think it was
Broadway.

Fortunately, that talent is being recognized at a
national level "8ball" recently received first place at the
James Baldwin New Play Festival at UC-San Diego. And
it all started here at Stanford in a sophomore's drama
class.

Holt epitomizes the entrepreneurial spirit of
Stanford, and her holistic and innovative approach to the
arts has surely paid olf. "8ball" is a dramatic triumph not
to be missed by a playwright that cannot be overlooked.
