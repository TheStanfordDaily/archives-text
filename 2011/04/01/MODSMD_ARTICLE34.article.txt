## Calder Quartet stops by Stanford 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
In front of a cozy crowd of stu
dents, the award-winning Calder
Quartet performed three pieces
on Tuesday, Mar. 29. The Quartet,

here for its Wednesday collaboration
with Grammy award-winning con
cert pianist and Stanford graduate
Gloria Cheng, headed the latest instal
lation of the Kimball Hall Chamber
Series.
For the informal performance,
the group used a program contrasting
that of the main performance on
Wednesday. The first piece, Mozart's
"Opus 95, Movement 1," was, as vio
linist Andrew Bulbrook remarked,
"short and compact." Though beauti
fully played, the movement seemed to
be simply a warm-up for the night.
Where the performance truly
took off was the second piece,
Shostakovich's "String Quartet No. 8
in C minor." A sad theme combined
with spontaneous eruptions of sound
in its third movement, Allegretto,
clearly denotes the quartet as a
mourning, yet captivating piece and
the best by far of the performance.
After taking questions, the per
formers used their final piece to light
en the mood: "String Quartet,
Movement 2 (Assez vifi" by Maurice
Ravel, a playful composition invoking
masterful pizzicato, or string-plucking.
Together, Bulbrook, violinist
Benjamin Jacobson, violist Jonathan
Moerschel and cellist Eric Byers com
prise the Calder Quartet. The four
began playing together in 1998 as stu
dents at the University of Southern
California.

"We actually started together,
since we were all performance majors,
to fulfill our chamber requirement,"
Moerschel said. "After five years, we
turned around one day and were like,
'Let's keep doing this.'"
Since then, the group has collab
orated with varied groups, including
pianists, composers and even indie
rock bands such as The Airborne
Toxic Event.

"We're driven by broad musical
interests and our desire to bring in

audiences from ail sides," Moerschel
said. "Ail kinds of music say the same
things using different language. And
the more we do it, the more we realize
we're all trying to do the same thing."
The Calder Quartet came specif
ically to the Bay Area as part of a
series of shows debuting their newest
performance piece, "String Quartet
No. 3." The piece was written for
them by composer Christopher
Rouse, his first new work in "20-odd
years," which Bulbrook labels, "phre
netic."
Along with Rouse, with whom
the four have forged a close relation
ship, the Calder Quartet detailed sev
eral sources of inspiration, including
many of their professors and collabo
rators. One of their main muses,
Alexander Calder, is the basis for their
name. "He's a terrific American artist,"
Moerschel said. "We were really
attracted to the mobile, widely con-
