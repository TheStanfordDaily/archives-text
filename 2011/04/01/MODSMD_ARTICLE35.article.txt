## ROXY SASS Dump Truck 
### 
The winter of our discontent is
over. Ladies and gentlemen, it's
time to rid yourself from that
warm body you kept around just for
comfort's sake. S is for spring quarter,
but it's also for sexytime. Sundresses
galore and shirtless volleyball in front
of Sigma Nu oh my Roxy!
Having a hard time figuring out
how to close a particular door so you
can open that new lip-bite-inducing,
toe-curling window in your bio class?
Out with the stale and in with the

fresh. (NB: spring quarter means it's
finally okay for Roxy and other upper
classmen to prey on freshmen. You

have to give them two quarters of mis
guided dormcest and high-school
rollovers before moving in for the kill.
It's only fair.)
Float on
Roxy's a sensitive gal, and she knows
one thing: breakups make people sad.
So why go through one at all? Roxy
prefers to keep relationships casual
a hookup here and there, hints of a
Thing-with-a-capital-T but never any
concrete promises so that when the
time comes to move on, she simply
steps aside and lets silence do the talk
ing. The dumpee is free to blame Roxy
for being flaky; Roxy avoids an awk
ward situation and keeps her Sass
intact.

Go public
If Roxy does manage to get tied down,
she knows nothing travels faster than
drama-filled gossip. Time to dump
your chump? Make a scene not

only will word of your new single sta
tus reach the eager ears of all those
"what-ifs" faster, you'll also coat your
self in a veneer of post-breakup vul
nerability. Please Roxy wants noth
ing more than for you to take advan
tage of her emotionally fragile state all

night long.
In name only
Just because you "broke up" doesn't
mean you have to stop getting your
kicks. Roxy has, in a few cases, man
aged to break up with someone so
gently that the boring commitment
stuff fades away, while the good times
stay. You can't spell "sex" without "ex"
for a reason. Pro tip: blaming a

breakup on an unavoidable outside
reason (graduation, anyone?) is step
one to a friendly "separation" that'll let
you pursue new avenues guilt-free.
Via text

Bonus points if you can write a break
up text long enough to arrive in two
separate messages for extra suspense.
The pre-emptive approach
Sometimes, Roxy just has to break up
with someone before they're even dat
ing. Although she's always reluctant to
shut down someone who's been tryna
(who doesn't love a little attention?),
being straight up with someone who
has no chance of boarding the train to
Sass-town is usually appreciated and
not considered presumptuous. Life
can't be all fun and games... unless,
that is, Roxy's got her eyes set on you.
