Dairy is not a component of
traditional Thai food; the
industry emerged in
Thailand only in the 19605. Its rela
tively recent introduction, however,
has been masked by an overwhelm
ing increase in demand. Today, the
carts of street vendors in Bangkok
abound with cans of condensed milk
used for Thai iced teas and other
desserts. But the rapid uptake has
produced an ad hoc cuisine that can
be disappointing when not handled
well, despite the potent ingredients
that underlie the food. Siam Orchid
falls prey to this problem it has all
the right ingredients but still comes
up a bit short.
The restaurant itself is cozy and
relatively formal, although certain
elements belie its attempt to fit in
among fancier fare, such as the straw
provided with a glass of sparkling
water. Siam Orchid is best suited for a
nicer dinner with a significant other
or close friend.
There are a handful of dishes at
Siam Orchid that are excellent. The
Kari Puffs are similar to a chicken
curry empanada and have a wonder
ful, flaky crust. The potato in the dish
may give the puffs a starchier texture
than necessary, but the seasoning
ultimately produces a pleasing appe
tizer. The Tom Kha Gai soup is fan

tastic and delivers a nice balance of
sweet and spicy. The broth is delec
table and not too heavy, pairing per
fectly with the mushrooms.
The curry offerings are generally
good but not particularly strong. The
Kari Kae is respectable, with a very
similar flavor profile to the Kari Puffs.
However, the lamb is not nearly as
tender as it should be, and the taste
just barely compensates for an other
wise poorly composed dish.
Conversely, the duck in the Gaeng
Phed Pet Yang is succulent and

extremely tender, but the dish lacks
the curry piquancy because of the
watery both.

Most dishes at Siam Orchid are
fairly mediocre. The Khao Pod Tord
is reminiscent of a funnel cake with
its crunchiness and subtle sweetness.
It lacks any nuance in flavor, however,
and makes for an awkward appetizer.
The Pla Nueng Manao sea bass is
fairly well cooked but lacks any Thai
flare; it presents only a dull citrus fla
vor to enhance the fish. The Pla Sam
Rot has some issues that are not cor
rected by its tasty accompanying
sweet and sour chili sauce. The
breading on the fish becomes soggy
and produces a texture that is remi
niscent of a fish stick out of a
microwave. More disconcerting are
the hints of fishiness that occasionally

emerge, calling into question the
quality of the fish itself.
There are also a few dishes that
are simply disappointing. The Po
Piah Sot are well-plated but under
performing vegetarian spring rolls.
The dish looks exciting but lacks in
taste and has a somewhat displeasing
mouthfeel. Furthermore, the honey
flavor and texture of the tamarind
sauce overwhelms any subtlety that
may otherwise have come through.
The Miang Kham seems to have so
much potential given its ingredients
fried peanuts, grilled shrimp and
shredded ginger, among others.

Unfortunately, none of the compo
nents come through sufficiently, as
they are swallowed by the spinach
cup that encapsulates them. The

Tung Thong sacks are completely for
gettable and overly fried at the cinch
at the top. Such decadence needs to
be met with commensurate flavor,

but it simply isn't
Conspicuously missing from the
menu are dishes with heat. Thai cui-

sine is spicy, and in creating a relative
ly modern, formal Thai menu, Siam
Orchid has missed something. While
there are some decent offerings and
in general nothing is a complete mis
fire, there is nothing spectacular
about Siam Orchid, and it ends up in
{he "Middle of the Road."

Try the Pad Thai Gung Sod or the Gai Phad Med Mamuang,
two of Siam Orchid's most popular dishes.
