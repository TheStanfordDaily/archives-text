## Cardona declined startup's controversial stock deal 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
Last fall, ASSU President An
gelina Cardona 'll received an
offer from an Internet start-up that
promised financial incentives in ex
change for promotional work. The

company, Jobbook.com, is an online
job-listing site launched by Montre
al lawyer Jean de Brabant.
Cardona said she personally
turned down a contract that includ
ed shares of stock in the company
because she "did not feel it was eth
ical to have shares" while serving as

student body president, she wrote
in an email to The Daily.
In an earlier email, she cited rea
sons for declining a possible part
nership between the ASSU and
Jobbook, explaining that the com
pany "needed to grow before even
considering any ASSU partner

ship."
However, the official Jobbook
website continues to list Stanford as
one of the universities where it has
"entered into partnership agree
ments with Student Presidents and
Leaders." It lists Caltech, UC
Berkeley, Imperial College Lon

don, University College London,
Johns Hopkins and McGill as the
others.

Following an inquiry from The
Daily, Cardona said she has asked
Jobbook to reword this sentence on
their site to state that she has been
"an advisor to them, but in no official
capacity."
Earlier this year, student leaders
at McGill and UCLA were found to
have agreed to contractual relation
ships with Jobbook.
In February, the UCLA Daily
Bruin reported that a student gov
ernment representative at UCLA,
Rustom Birdie, accepted 1,000 Job
book shares in exchange for promot
ing the company to students. The inci
dent resulted in an ongoing investiga
tion by the school's judicial board.
According to The McGill Tribune,
the student council at its university
voted to censure student president
Zack Newburgh because of a con
tract he signed with Jobbook.

Cardona said her involvement
with the company was limited to re
viewing its website design, giving
input on student needs when asked
via email and being added as an ad
ministrator to one of Jobbook's Face
book groups. She said she did not re
ceive any compensation for partici
pating in this capacity.
"I decided to serve in an advisory
role for Jobbook because it has huge
potential to impact many student
lives," she said. "I want to see the proj
ect succeed so that my peers would
have more opportunities to find em
ployment after college. I know many
people who are still looking for jobs
right now and anything that could
help them in this hard job market is
crucial."

Although not approached by the
company directly, ASSU financial
manager Raj Bhandari, a graduate
student in management science and
engineering, said he received an
email on Feb. 7 about the offer from
Jobbook. He said the company asked
for "help getting out their word to
Stanford students," but did not offer
any terms.

"It was a little bit vague," said
Bhandari, who is also CEO of Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE).
SSE did not choose to follow up
on Jobbook's proposal, Bhandari
said, because they did not see it meet
ing the organization's mission state
ment. According to Bhandari, this
mission is three-fold: guaranteeing
the financial viability of the ASSU,
providing a service to the Stanford
community and offering entrepre
neurial experience on campus.
"The partnership just didn't look

that interesting," he said. "It probably
wouldn't have brought very much
money in for SSE. It probably wasn't
that much of a valuable service that
students didn't already have. Nor was
it going to provide extra jobs for stu
dents here on campus."
Bhandari said no comparable re
quests have come across his desk dur
ing his time in office.
Cardona, however, said it is not
uncommon for the Executive Com
mittee to receive similar offers from
other outside organizations, such as

social-networking sites and online
book-buying companies, that are
looking to connect with college stu
dents. Most of these requests, she
said, are sent to an email list serve
that goes to the ASSU president, vice
president and chief of staff.
All potential partnerships be
tween the ASSU and outside compa
nies must go through a multilayered
process before becoming a reality,
Cardona said. This includes consult
ing the Office of Student Activities
and Leadership (SAL) to make sure
the relationship is in accordance with
University policy, checking with the
General Counsel to satisfy the
ASSU's 501c3 non-profit status and
coming to a decision within the Exec
utive Committee about whether or
not the partnership fits with ASSU's
mission statement.

Cardona explained that if the
ASSU were to pursue a partnership
with Jobbook in the future, officials
would also have to prove that it of
fered a service that would "compli
ment or enhance existing resources
such as the Career Development
Center."
Cardona said she is not aware of
any ASSU partnerships with outside
companies that have met all these cri
teria in the past.
The Jobbook representatives did
not respond to requests for comment
from The Daily.

change for promotional work. The

company, Jobbook.com, is an online
job-listing site launched by Montre
al lawyer Jean de Brabant.
Cardona said she personally
turned down a contract that includ
ed shares of stock in the company
because she "did not feel it was eth
ical to have shares" while serving as

student body president, she wrote
in an email to The Daily.
In an earlier email, she cited rea
sons for declining a possible part
nership between the ASSU and
Jobbook, explaining that the com
pany "needed to grow before even
considering any ASSU partner

ship."
However, the official Jobbook
website continues to list Stanford as
one of the universities where it has
"entered into partnership agree
ments with Student Presidents and
Leaders." It lists Caltech, UC
Berkeley, Imperial College Lon

don, University College London,
Johns Hopkins and McGill as the
others.

Following an inquiry from The
Daily, Cardona said she has asked
Jobbook to reword this sentence on
their site to state that she has been
"an advisor to them, but in no official
capacity."
Earlier this year, student leaders
at McGill and UCLA were found to
have agreed to contractual relation
ships with Jobbook.
In February, the UCLA Daily
Bruin reported that a student gov
ernment representative at UCLA,
Rustom Birdie, accepted 1,000 Job
book shares in exchange for promot
ing the company to students. The inci
dent resulted in an ongoing investiga
tion by the school's judicial board.
According to The McGill Tribune,
the student council at its university
voted to censure student president
Zack Newburgh because of a con
tract he signed with Jobbook.

Cardona said her involvement
with the company was limited to re
viewing its website design, giving
input on student needs when asked
via email and being added as an ad
ministrator to one of Jobbook's Face
book groups. She said she did not re
ceive any compensation for partici
pating in this capacity.
"I decided to serve in an advisory
role for Jobbook because it has huge
potential to impact many student
lives," she said. "I want to see the proj
ect succeed so that my peers would
have more opportunities to find em
ployment after college. I know many
people who are still looking for jobs
right now and anything that could
help them in this hard job market is
crucial."

Although not approached by the
company directly, ASSU financial
manager Raj Bhandari, a graduate
student in management science and
engineering, said he received an
email on Feb. 7 about the offer from
Jobbook. He said the company asked
for "help getting out their word to
Stanford students," but did not offer
any terms.

"It was a little bit vague," said
Bhandari, who is also CEO of Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE).
SSE did not choose to follow up
on Jobbook's proposal, Bhandari
said, because they did not see it meet
ing the organization's mission state
ment. According to Bhandari, this
mission is three-fold: guaranteeing
the financial viability of the ASSU,
providing a service to the Stanford
community and offering entrepre
neurial experience on campus.
"The partnership just didn't look

that interesting," he said. "It probably
wouldn't have brought very much
money in for SSE. It probably wasn't
that much of a valuable service that
students didn't already have. Nor was
it going to provide extra jobs for stu
dents here on campus."
Bhandari said no comparable re
quests have come across his desk dur
ing his time in office.
Cardona, however, said it is not
uncommon for the Executive Com
mittee to receive similar offers from
other outside organizations, such as

social-networking sites and online
book-buying companies, that are
looking to connect with college stu
dents. Most of these requests, she
said, are sent to an email list serve
that goes to the ASSU president, vice
president and chief of staff.
All potential partnerships be
tween the ASSU and outside compa
nies must go through a multilayered
process before becoming a reality,
Cardona said. This includes consult
ing the Office of Student Activities
and Leadership (SAL) to make sure
the relationship is in accordance with
University policy, checking with the
General Counsel to satisfy the
ASSU's 501c3 non-profit status and
coming to a decision within the Exec
utive Committee about whether or
not the partnership fits with ASSU's
mission statement.

Cardona explained that if the
ASSU were to pursue a partnership
with Jobbook in the future, officials
would also have to prove that it of
fered a service that would "compli
ment or enhance existing resources
such as the Career Development
Center."
Cardona said she is not aware of
any ASSU partnerships with outside
companies that have met all these cri
teria in the past.
The Jobbook representatives did
not respond to requests for comment
from The Daily.
