## UNIVERSITY Admit rate drops to 7.1 percent as class grows Patterson expects class of 2015 to grow by 50 frosh 
### EVAN SHIEH 
With the release of admission
decisions on Tuesday, Stanford's ac
ceptance rate fell to 7.1 percent,
breaking the record 7.2 percent set
last year. Of the 34,348 high school
students who applied to the Farm
this year, 2,427 have the opportuni
ty to join the Class of 2015. The
number includes the 754 applicants
admitted in December through the
early action option.
This initial percentage, however,
can be deceptive: only 2,300 stu
dents were admitted to the classes
of 2014 and 2013 before more were
accepted off the waitlist.
Recently, Stanford has increased
the number of admitted students it
can accommodate each year, ac
cording to Director of Admission
Bob Patterson. An increase in the
raw number of acceptances was
motivated by greater space avail
able on campus in both classrooms
and residence halls. As a result, the
freshman class size is likely to in
crease next year by roughly 50 stu
dents, he said.
Stanford's admit class is once
again geographically diverse:
roughly nine percent of the pool are
international students, and admits
hail from all 50 states.
"We saw talented students from
the academic arena to the theater
arts, from debate to athletics
truly talented students," Patterson
said. "This was an amazing class.
The admission staff was really pas
sionate about the students they
read and extremely excited about
the students who were ultimately
admitted."

Stanford remained among the
most selective institutions in the na
tion. Harvard and Columbia had

admittance rates of 6.2 percent and
6.4 percent, respectively. Yale ac
cepted 7.4 percent of applicants,
while Princeton took in 8.4 percent.

Admission rates continue to fall
nationwide as more students apply
to a greater number of institutions,
Patterson said. Although the overall
number of graduating high school
students decreased from last year,
Stanford received a higher number
of applications. The number of high
school applicants increased 6.8 per
cent from last year, which boasted a
total of 32,022 applicants.
Despite this growth in applica
tions, Stanford's admission process
has remained the same.

"We continued to review appli
cations the same way we always
have, through a comprehensive, ho
listic approach," Patterson said.
"We did hire additional reading
staff, and we also had them work
more hours. It took a toll on them,
but they still reviewed every single
file we received this year."
Ehrik Aldana, who was admit
ted as part of Stanford's regular de
cision process, said he is excited for
Admit Weekend.
"What I had found out from
websites, papers and talking to peo
ple I'm looking forward to expe
riencing it firsthand," Aldana said.
But the excitement hasn't quite
sunk in for him yet.
"I'm still in this incredibly nebu
lous place where I don't know what
to think right now," he said. "It feels
unreal."

The admission process is still far
from over for many applicants.
Stanford will begin reviewing the
applications of roughly 1,400 trans
fer students over the next two
weeks.There are also 1,078 students
on the waitlist.
Admits have until May 1 to ac
cept the University's offer.
