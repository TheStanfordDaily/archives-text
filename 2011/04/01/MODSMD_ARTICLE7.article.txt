## SLAC study suggests new phase of matter Unique 'pseudogap' state encountered 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at Stanford and
the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory may have discov
ered a new phase of matter, dis
tinct from solids, gases, liquids
and plasmas. Working in con
junction with scientists from the
Department of Energy's
Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory and UC-Berkeley,
the Stanford researchers made
the discovery while studying
certain properties of high-tem
perature superconductors.

The collaboration was or
ganized by physics professor
Zhi-Xun Shen, who is also a
member of the Stanford Insti
tute for Materials and Energy
Science (SIMES) at SLAC. The
team's findings, co-authored by
SLAC scientist Makoto
Hashimoto and post-doctoral
scholar Ruihua He, were pub
lished in the Mar. 25 issue of Sci
ence.

This recent research sheds
new light on a well-established
field. Superconductors conduct
electricity with 100 percent effi
ciency, a property that gives

them the potential to be a high
ly revolutionary technology.
Hindering this potential, how
ever, is the fact that they oper
ate only at extremely low tem
peratures.
Scientists have tried to design
"high-temperature" supercon
ductors, which actually operate
at room temperature and are of
more practical use, but in the
process have encountered a
puzzling phenomenon. As elec
trons in the superconductor
gain energy and change states
due to the additional heat, the
superconductors enter a unique
electronic state that researchers
term a "pseudogap."
Many scientists have posited
that the mysterious pseudogap,
which has been inconclusively
studied for some 20 years, mere
ly represents a gradual transi
tion to superconductivity. The
Stanford team's findings, how
ever, suggest that the pseudo
gap may in fact be a new phase
of matter because the electrons
reorganize themselves into a
distinct formation of their own
one that scientists have yet to
fully understand.
"This work has the power to
partially conclude a long-stand
ing debate on the nature of the
pseudogap phase, which is the


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
central question to answer in high
temperature superconductivity
the unquestionable holy grail of
modern condensed-matter
physics," He said.
"Our experiment suggests that
proper management of this phase
[the pseudogap] could be a critical
step toward obtaining better su
perconductors that could have
broad practical applicability,"
Shen said.
The researchers used a three
pronged approach in investigating
the pseudogap, combining differ
ent types of measurement to study
electronic behavior at the materi
al's surface, thermodynamic be
havior in its interior and changes
to the electrons' dynamic proper
ties over time.

When electrons are supercon
ducting, they pair up. This recent

research revealed, however, that in
the pseudogap, electrons do not
pair up but rather reorganize into
a unique formation. While these
findings suggest that the pseudo
gap is more than just a transitional
phase, they do not offer conclusive
information on what such a forma
tion means.

"I personally think it is a stretch
to compare the phase that we
found to the other four [phases],"
He said. "But we are not the first to
raise such a possibility."
High-temperature supercon
ductors are already being used in
medical imaging, highly efficient
energy generators and maglev
trains, even though the warmest of
them must be chilled halfway to
absolute zero before they will su
perconduct. But this paper may be
a breakthrough in better under
standing superconductivity, per
haps paving the way for more prac
tical technologies.
