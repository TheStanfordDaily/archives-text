## SLAC study suggests new phase of matter Unique 'pseudogap' state encountered 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at Stanford and
the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory may have discov
ered a new phase of matter, dis
tinct from solids, gases, liquids
and plasmas. Working in con
junction with scientists from the
Department of Energy's
Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory and UC-Berkeley,
the Stanford researchers made
the discovery while studying
certain properties of high-tem
perature superconductors.

The collaboration was or
ganized by physics professor
Zhi-Xun Shen, who is also a
member of the Stanford Insti
tute for Materials and Energy
Science (SIMES) at SLAC. The
team's findings, co-authored by
SLAC scientist Makoto
Hashimoto and post-doctoral
scholar Ruihua He, were pub
lished in the Mar. 25 issue of Sci
ence.

This recent research sheds
new light on a well-established
field. Superconductors conduct
electricity with 100 percent effi
ciency, a property that gives

them the potential to be a high
ly revolutionary technology.
Hindering this potential, how
ever, is the fact that they oper
ate only at extremely low tem
peratures.
Scientists have tried to design
"high-temperature" supercon
ductors, which actually operate
at room temperature and are of
more practical use, but in the
process have encountered a
puzzling phenomenon. As elec
trons in the superconductor
gain energy and change states
due to the additional heat, the
superconductors enter a unique
electronic state that researchers
term a "pseudogap."
Many scientists have posited
that the mysterious pseudogap,
which has been inconclusively
studied for some 20 years, mere
ly represents a gradual transi
tion to superconductivity. The
Stanford team's findings, how
ever, suggest that the pseudo
gap may in fact be a new phase
of matter because the electrons
reorganize themselves into a
distinct formation of their own
one that scientists have yet to
fully understand.
"This work has the power to
partially conclude a long-stand
ing debate on the nature of the
pseudogap phase, which is the
