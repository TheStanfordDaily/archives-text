## REINVENTING SPRING BREAK 
### NARDOS GIRMA 
Spring Break: these words bring to
mind images of college students soak
ing up the sun on beaches or resting at
home, recovering from a long and tir
ing winter quarter. Yet for the almost
200 Stanford students who participated in Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) this year, the
week would be spent learning about and expe
riencing public service.
ASB is a Stanford program affiliated with
the Haas Center for Public Service that allows
students to go to various parts of the country
on service and service-learning trips. This
year's ASB program had a total of 17 trips with
topics ranging from veteran's health care to ed
ucation reform in New York to food issues in
the Bay Area to the California prison system,
all of which exposed students to a variety of so
cial and cultural issues through education as
well as hands-on service.
The Stanford ASB program is part of a na
tional alternative break organization called
Break Away. But what makes Stanford's pro
gram so unique is that it is designed to educate
and teach students about social issues rather
than just send them on service trips.
"Our trips have evolved into more of edu
cation immersion experiences versus tradi
tional hands-on service experiences," said ASB
faculty advisor Jon McConnell. "There are still
some service components built into the course
of the week, but it's more comprehensive and
looks at social issues from a multitude of per
spectives."
The education immersion portion of the
trip started before spring break even started.
Students started gearing up for ASB with a
one-unit informative course during winter
quarter, through which they gained an in
depth understanding of their topics.
Having completed the more formal class
room portion of the program, students then
headed to locations across the country where
they began their service-learning projects.
There, they met both with those impacted by
the social issues as well as those with the power
to help alleviate the problems.
Christian Smith 'l2 traveled to New York
City to explore the education system, where
his ASB group took a hands-on approach to
dealing with education reform by visiting sev-

eral public schools and char
ter schools. The "Growing
Creativity: Education Re
form in New York City and
Beyond" ASB group part
nered with the Institute of
Design at Stanford
(d.school) to explore bring
ing design thinking and cre
ativity to the education sys
tem.
In addition to working
with students. Smith and his
fellow Stanford students vis
ited universities where they
talked about design thinking
in education reform and ex
plored a new way of thinking
called constructivist educa-

tion, which focuses on creativity as a means of
education reform.
"This design thinking process fits in with
the constructivist education model because
you're harnessing creativity that we believe is
fundamentally in every student," Smith said.
"If we can harness that creativity and use it in

higher academic settings,
then we can get results from
students that don't learn as
well from traditional educa
tion methods."
ASB also exposed students
to the wealth of opportuni
ties that exist in public serv
ice, which for some, such as
Namir Shah 'l4, helped re
shape their career goals.
Shah, who went on a trip
that explored women's
health and health policy, de
scribed how he was "sur
prised by how many ways
there are to get involved in
public policy and health poli
cy than just being an elected

politician or a doctor."
Despite the differences in subject matter
and location, several themes remain common
throughout the ASB trips. First of all, it's im
possible to speak to students about their ASB
experience without hearing about the friend
ships they formed.

Alexandra Rieger 'l4, who began the "So
cial Entrepreneurship in the Bay Area" trip ex
pecting to learn more about the various start
ups in the Bay Area and possibly make a few
contacts, was surprised by how much she bond
ed with her peers.
"It was absolutely wonderful to begin the
journey with really wonderful individuals and
leave as close friends over such a short amount
of time," Rieger said.
Another common factor in every group was
the hard work and dedication of the trip lead
ers. Each group had two trip leaders that were
recruited during spring quarter of the previous
year. These leaders proposed their own topics,
participated in training during fall quarter and
organized the entire trip.
"What our program does well is that it
brings together student leaders from all over
campus with very diverse interests and back
grounds to design a very intensive experience
around their topic," said Minh Dan Vuong 'll,
executive director of the program. "What uni
fies all 17 trips is this passion for engaging stu
dents and promoting service and service-learn
ing."
Many students were motivated to become
leaders as a result of their own ASB trips or
personal experiences related to their topic.
Andy Nguyen 'l2, for example, was motivated
to lead a trip covering women's health and
health policy this year because of his experi
ence in a human biology class about women's
health as well as an internship that exposed
him to state legislative advocacy.
He described the final reflection his group
had at the end of the program as one of his fa
vorite moments of the trip.
"I liked finding out what everyone learned
on the trip because I'm really passionate about
women's health and health policy, and it was
exciting to see how much people had learned
over the duration of the directed reading in
winter quarter and over the course of the trip,"
Nguyen said.
Next year, perhaps students inspired by
their recent ASB experiences will continue the
cycle, becoming the next set of ASB leaders
and encouraging other students to trade in
their week-long sunbath in Mexico for new
perspectives, a group of close friends and a pas
sion for public service.

room portion of the program, students then
headed to locations across the country where
they began their service-learning projects.
There, they met both with those impacted by
the social issues as well as those with the power
to help alleviate the problems.
Christian Smith 'l2 traveled to New York
City to explore the education system, where
his ASB group took a hands-on approach to
dealing with education reform by visiting sev-

eral public schools and char
ter schools. The "Growing
Creativity: Education Re
form in New York City and
Beyond" ASB group part
nered with the Institute of
Design at Stanford
(d.school) to explore bring
ing design thinking and cre
ativity to the education sys
tem.
In addition to working
with students. Smith and his
fellow Stanford students vis
ited universities where they
talked about design thinking
in education reform and ex
plored a new way of thinking
called constructivist educa-

tion, which focuses on creativity as a means of
education reform.
"This design thinking process fits in with
the constructivist education model because
you're harnessing creativity that we believe is
fundamentally in every student," Smith said.
"If we can harness that creativity and use it in

higher academic settings,
then we can get results from
students that don't learn as
well from traditional educa
tion methods."
ASB also exposed students
to the wealth of opportuni
ties that exist in public serv
ice, which for some, such as
Namir Shah 'l4, helped re
shape their career goals.
Shah, who went on a trip
that explored women's
health and health policy, de
scribed how he was "sur
prised by how many ways
there are to get involved in
public policy and health poli
cy than just being an elected

politician or a doctor."
Despite the differences in subject matter
and location, several themes remain common
throughout the ASB trips. First of all, it's im
possible to speak to students about their ASB
experience without hearing about the friend
ships they formed.

Alexandra Rieger 'l4, who began the "So
cial Entrepreneurship in the Bay Area" trip ex
pecting to learn more about the various start
ups in the Bay Area and possibly make a few
contacts, was surprised by how much she bond
ed with her peers.
"It was absolutely wonderful to begin the
journey with really wonderful individuals and
leave as close friends over such a short amount
of time," Rieger said.
Another common factor in every group was
the hard work and dedication of the trip lead
ers. Each group had two trip leaders that were
recruited during spring quarter of the previous
year. These leaders proposed their own topics,
participated in training during fall quarter and
organized the entire trip.
"What our program does well is that it
brings together student leaders from all over
campus with very diverse interests and back
grounds to design a very intensive experience
around their topic," said Minh Dan Vuong 'll,
executive director of the program. "What uni
fies all 17 trips is this passion for engaging stu
dents and promoting service and service-learn
ing."
Many students were motivated to become
leaders as a result of their own ASB trips or
personal experiences related to their topic.
Andy Nguyen 'l2, for example, was motivated
to lead a trip covering women's health and
health policy this year because of his experi
ence in a human biology class about women's
health as well as an internship that exposed
him to state legislative advocacy.
He described the final reflection his group
had at the end of the program as one of his fa
vorite moments of the trip.
"I liked finding out what everyone learned
on the trip because I'm really passionate about
women's health and health policy, and it was
exciting to see how much people had learned
over the duration of the directed reading in
winter quarter and over the course of the trip,"
Nguyen said.
Next year, perhaps students inspired by
their recent ASB experiences will continue the
cycle, becoming the next set of ASB leaders
and encouraging other students to trade in
their week-long sunbath in Mexico for new
perspectives, a group of close friends and a pas
sion for public service.

The Social Entrepreneurship group, one of 17 groups participating in the Alternative Spring
Break program, visited businesses in the Bay Area dedicated to enacting positive social change.
Spring Break: these words bring to
mind images of college students soak
ing up the sun on beaches or resting at
home, recovering from a long and tir
ing winter quarter. Yet for the almost
200 Stanford students who participated in Al
ternative Spring Break (ASB) this year, the
week would be spent learning about and expe
riencing public service.
ASB is a Stanford program affiliated with
the Haas Center for Public Service that allows
students to go to various parts of the country
on service and service-learning trips. This
year's ASB program had a total of 17 trips with
topics ranging from veteran's health care to ed
ucation reform in New York to food issues in
the Bay Area to the California prison system,
all of which exposed students to a variety of so
cial and cultural issues through education as
well as hands-on service.
The Stanford ASB program is part of a na
tional alternative break organization called
Break Away. But what makes Stanford's pro
gram so unique is that it is designed to educate
and teach students about social issues rather
than just send them on service trips.
"Our trips have evolved into more of edu
cation immersion experiences versus tradi
tional hands-on service experiences," said ASB
faculty advisor Jon McConnell. "There are still
some service components built into the course
of the week, but it's more comprehensive and
looks at social issues from a multitude of per
spectives."
The education immersion portion of the
trip started before spring break even started.
Students started gearing up for ASB with a
one-unit informative course during winter
quarter, through which they gained an in
depth understanding of their topics.
Having completed the more formal class
room portion of the program, students then
headed to locations across the country where
they began their service-learning projects.
There, they met both with those impacted by
the social issues as well as those with the power
to help alleviate the problems.
