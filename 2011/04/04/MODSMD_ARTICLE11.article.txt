## EDITORIAL Becoming an informed voter, and why it matters 
### 
Voting for ASSU candidates
is much easier and more
convenient than voting in a
national election. Students vote on
line from the comfort of their dorm
rooms, polls are open for a full 48
hours and information about the
candidates is readily available. De
spite this, voter turnout in recent
ASSU elections has hovered
around 50 percent for the under
graduate population and is far
lower for graduate students.
Many would argue that turnout
is relatively low because the ASSU
doesn't have an impact on the day
to-day lives of students, but this no
tion is incorrect. If you are a mem
ber of a student group, or even if
you attend an event hosted by one,
you are benefiting from the ASSU
funding process. The influence of
the ASSU is also evident in some
thing as simple as reserving an Old
Union room the current online
system exists because, two years
ago, an Executive administration
created it.
But the ASSU has an impact be
yond funding groups and launching
its own initiatives elected ASSU
members can act as your lobbyists
to the administration. For example,
maybe you have a strong opinion
on the new policy prohibiting the
use of Row social dues for alcohol
purchases, or perhaps you feel that
stronger action needs to be taken
to improve advising. Your ASSU
representatives are well placed to
translate your views into adminis
trative policy change and they want
to hear from you.
Because these issues are not di
rectly under the control of the
ASSU, we tend to think that the
ASSU plays no role in them at all.
In fact, the ASSU can and should
be a strong participant in the ad
ministrative policymaking process.
The Executive, Senators and GSC
members collaborate regularly
with the administrators that make
these types of decisions. They know
these individuals well, understand
how their departments operate and
are perfectly positioned to advo
cate on behalf of students. Admin
istrators recognize that ASSU
leaders are popularly elected and
represent the opinions of the stu
dent body, and are almost always
happy to incorporate ASSU input.
As you prepare to cast your
votes on Thursday and Friday, the

editorial board offers the following
recommendations not specific
candidates to support, but charac
teristics to search for and questions
to ask:
No. 1: Look critically at flyers.
They are perhaps the most com
mon symbol of Campaign Week,
but frequently offer little or no in
formation. Ask yourself if the can
didate is actually proposing to ad
dress issues in a concrete way, or if
he/she simply listed appealing
buzzwords. Flyering is an easy way
to avoid actual one-on-one cam
paigning, so be sure to remember
candidates that take the time to
have real conversations with you.
No. 2: Talk to candidates about
their platform. Ask not only what
they will do, but follow up with two
important questions. First, how will
they accomplish their goals? For
example, if a Senate candidate
wants to address sustainability is
sues, which tools does the Senate
provide that will help them suc
ceed? Second, how will the candi
date know that he or she has suc
cessfully addressed the problem?
There are dozens of new ASSU ini
tiatives every year, but they are
rarely evaluated to examine effec
tiveness or adjusted to be as effi
cient as possible.
No. 3: Keep experience in mind.
There is a learning curve within the
ASSU; students who have served
in the Senate, GSC or Executive
branch will tell you that it takes
time and energy to get up to speed.
Look for ASSU experience, or at
the very least, knowledge of the in
stitution. For Senate candidates,
ask if they have attended Senate
meetings. Do they know the Senate
environment? For Executive slates,
the time commitment has grown
beyond that of a full-time job. Are
candidates aware of this and are
they willing to make the sacrifices
(academic and otherwise) neces
sary to represent the student body?
No. 4: Find out what motivates
them. This may be the most impor
tant piece of advice we can offer:
try to learn why a candidate is real
ly in the race, beyond the goals on a
platform. Ask what they hope to
gain through ASSU service and
how it will enhance their Stanford
experience. In the end, candidates
with a good answer to this question
are almost always the most effec
tive.
