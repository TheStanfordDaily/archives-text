# No FREE LUNCH
## Not So Special Fees 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
As we mentioned last week, ASSU election season
is already upon us. Good news is, one issue has
pretty much been decided: what groups will re
ceive additional funding from the undergraduate or
graduate student populations Special Fees.
For almost all of the organizations on the ballot, the
hard part is already over. They've waded through the pa
perwork, gone before the ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee and had their members forward a plea to
every mailing list on campus. If they're lucky, they man
aged to rally 10 percent of the student population if the
Appropriations Committee approved them or 15 per
cent if they weren't, and for the most part, the fight is
over. Simply put, they're across the approval threshold
for fees.
The election is structured so that a specific organiza
tion must be approved by a simple majority of those who
vote and at least 15 percent of the student body as a
whole. Last year, not a single organization had less than
half of the vote. In all, 89 percent (49 out of 55) of re
quests were approved.The six that weren't can blame the
low voter turnout that kept them from getting to the 15
percent absolute mark rather than any actual negative
voter sentiment overall average approval was 68 per

cent. In 2009, a single student organization failed in its
bid, and on a technicality at that. In 2008, only one organ
ization dropped below the then more stringent 60 per
cent approval of those voting. What does this tell us
about Stanford students as voters?

First, we don't show up. If more than 30 percent of stu
dents or 2,100 people had voted on every Special Fees
issue last year, all of them would have passed. Second, in
ferring from the data and just talking to people, some
huge number of students simply votes yes on every sin
gle petition. Perhaps most vote no on one or two organi
zations which really bothered them that year, but how
many people do you think actually go line by line and ask
themselves if their Stanford experience is improved be
cause Mock Trial (the organization with the lowest ap
proval that still received funding) can fly some of its


members to Atlanta for a tourna
ment? We'd guess that there is a
small group of people who actually
think about who they don't want to
give funding to, and then there is
probably another, smaller popula
tion who just vote 'no' on every
thing. All in all, it seems fair to say
that when it comes to Special Fees,
Stanford students aren't a very dis
cerning lot.
But maybe that's because we
don't have to be. Everyone has the
right to request a refund at the be
ginning of the quarter from any
groups they don't wish to personally
fund. This would be a great way to
vote with your feet, but with our
'yesyesyes' Special Fees system, no
one bears the burden of 'no.' If
someone refunds the portion of
their fee that goes to Flicks or the
Stanford Concert Network, they can
still go watch as many free movies or
concerts as they want. Flicks and
SCN have no recourse for free rid
ers. This is probably the rationale for
why student groups aren't docked
when someone or everyone request
a refund. Instead the ASSU general
fund is left to take up the slack. This
wasn't much of a problem when no
one knew about the refund system,
but thanks to some flyering by the
Stanford Review, it seems that
everyone does now.
Tire Special Fees system was de
signed to let the student body make
tradeoffs to decide how to distribute
a limited pool of money to a big
group or worthy student organiza

tions. Instead it's become a set of
hurdles, where everyone gets great
services, but anyone can opt out of
paying. Socialism and Libertarian
ism don't mix well it's simply bad
business.

So how do we fix it? First, we
could start by doing the obvious and
closing the refund loophole. No one
seems to be willing to allow the
ASSU to distribute a list of those
who requested refunds to the groups
they requested them from, so the re
fund system should be junked en
tirely. Second, we could tweak the
election process to do what it was in
tended to do, let the students decide.
For starters, the barrier to getting
special fees should be significantly
higher than getting on the ballot
by at least double meaning that
30 percent of the student population
should have to approve of a group
getting funding, in an absolute sense.
An unintended upside to this is it
would get every group invested in
turnout, not just spamming for peti
tions.
So until then, go vote in this elec
tion. And spend the two minutes it
will take to actually go through and
think about whether each group that
is asking for your money is actually
serving the Stanford community and
actually improving our university.
And future ASSU senators and ex
ecutive: this is something that actual
ly needs fixing. We need a consistent
policy that allows special fees to sim
ply and clearly do what it is intended
to: provide funding for organizations
that make this place great.
