# No FREE LUNCH
## Not So Special Fees 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
As we mentioned last week, ASSU election season
is already upon us. Good news is, one issue has
pretty much been decided: what groups will re
ceive additional funding from the undergraduate or
graduate student populations Special Fees.
For almost all of the organizations on the ballot, the
hard part is already over. They've waded through the pa
perwork, gone before the ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee and had their members forward a plea to
every mailing list on campus. If they're lucky, they man
aged to rally 10 percent of the student population if the
Appropriations Committee approved them or 15 per
cent if they weren't, and for the most part, the fight is
over. Simply put, they're across the approval threshold
for fees.
The election is structured so that a specific organiza
tion must be approved by a simple majority of those who
vote and at least 15 percent of the student body as a
whole. Last year, not a single organization had less than
half of the vote. In all, 89 percent (49 out of 55) of re
quests were approved.The six that weren't can blame the
low voter turnout that kept them from getting to the 15
percent absolute mark rather than any actual negative
voter sentiment overall average approval was 68 per

cent. In 2009, a single student organization failed in its
bid, and on a technicality at that. In 2008, only one organ
ization dropped below the then more stringent 60 per
cent approval of those voting. What does this tell us
about Stanford students as voters?

First, we don't show up. If more than 30 percent of stu
dents or 2,100 people had voted on every Special Fees
issue last year, all of them would have passed. Second, in
ferring from the data and just talking to people, some
huge number of students simply votes yes on every sin
gle petition. Perhaps most vote no on one or two organi
zations which really bothered them that year, but how
many people do you think actually go line by line and ask
themselves if their Stanford experience is improved be

proval that still received funding) can fly some of its
