# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Becoming One of the "Guys" 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So last Monday I had my first
day of a class called "Feminism
and American Literature."
Being both a fan of literature and
feminism, I was pretty excited that
day. However, as I sat there, I felt a
bit off. I felt flustered, guarded, on
edge, vulnerable. I had no idea why
I felt this way. It wasn't until about
halfway through the class that I re
alized I was the only male-identi
fied person in the room. And for the
first time, I became acutely aware of
my maleness.
This class was the first time I ever
felt out of place in a female space. It
was strange before, I was so much
more comfortable in female spaces
than male spaces. As someone who
has studied both English and Femi
nist Studies, I was pretty used to
being the minority in female-domi
nated academic spaces. During my
freshman year, I even lived on an all
girls' floor. (Yes, I got to live the
dream of living with all girls. It was

awesome.) I've always felt that I re
lated more to women than to men.
But now, as I continue that transi
tion, I feel like that dynamic is chang
ing.
The moment of conception for
this column occurred when one of
my best friends told me how he no
ticed that I acted a lot straighter now
compared to the beginning of my
transition. And although I do identi
fy as "queer" and consider myself
part of the queer community, my
other queer friends have seen me
more as a straight boy than a queer
boy. And I admit that I'm beginning
to see myself less as queer and more
as someone who's straight. I'm slow
ly becoming more and more like a
guy like a normal guy. And what
ever the hell normal is, I'm not sure,
but I sure feel it.
I've taken a lot of traditionally
male mannerisms. I go to the gym. I
drink beer. I know how to joke
around with other guys. I've noticed

that my walk has become a lot
straighter I'm not very sure how
to explain it. When I was just begin
ning to transition, I had a very non
normative sort of walk, the sort of
walk that signaled to people that I
was not a normal guy. I wasn't very
sure how to move in a masculine
way. I experimented with different
ways of walking, with different ways
of holding my body. I was fine with
and proud of having a more femi
nine walk, of portraying my mas
culinity in a non-normative way.
Maybe it's because of the testos
terone and how I've added on mus
cle particularly my arms and
shoulders but now I carry myself

differently, walk differently. Physi
cally, in many ways, I'm much more
traditionally masculine than I was
before.
But the most jarring aspect to my
transition is how I relate to women,
particularly women I am interested
in. I never participated in college
hookup culture because I just didn't
get it. I never learned the signals that
girls give guys if they want to dance,
make out, have sex. The idea of
hookups was all very foreign to me,
even at the beginning of this school
year. But at this point of my transi
tion, I'm slowly becoming more and
more familiar, more and more
aligned with the more conventional
ways that men and women interact
with each other sexually.
Of course, I'm not the type to
hook up with people, (as I men
tioned in last week's column), but
I've become more familiar with this
whole heterosexual courting para
digm. I'm becoming a traditional
guy in terms of how I go about treat

ing someone I'm interested in I
feel compelled to pick up the tab,
hold open doors, just those things
that men traditionally do. I have this
weird impulse to be a gentleman,
which I know is problematic, since
the idea of the gentleman does to a
degree stem from sexism and chau
vinism, but all this comes with being
culturally indoctrinated as a straight
man.
Don't get me wrong. I'm very
happy with my transition. I'm happy
with how my body is turning out. I'm
happy with my voice, I'm overall so
much happier than I was two years
ago, when I first was coming out. But
at the same time, I feel like I'm los
ing something. I once prided myself
in being able to relate to women, in
claiming women's spaces as my
spaces but now, I feel that I am
separating myself from women, re
lating to them as straight men relate
to them. I'm transforming into a reg
ular guy, the guy you'd have a beer
with, the guy you'd give a slap on the
back. It's so strange. And to tell you
the truth, I'm not very sure how I
feel about it yet.

my best friends told me how he no
ticed that I acted a lot straighter now
compared to the beginning of my
transition. And although I do identi
fy as "queer" and consider myself
part of the queer community, my
other queer friends have seen me
more as a straight boy than a queer
boy. And I admit that I'm beginning
to see myself less as queer and more
as someone who's straight. I'm slow
ly becoming more and more like a
guy like a normal guy. And what
ever the hell normal is, I'm not sure,
but I sure feel it.
I've taken a lot of traditionally
male mannerisms. I go to the gym. I
drink beer. I know how to joke
around with other guys. I've noticed

that my walk has become a lot
straighter I'm not very sure how
to explain it. When I was just begin
ning to transition, I had a very non
normative sort of walk, the sort of
walk that signaled to people that I
was not a normal guy. I wasn't very
sure how to move in a masculine
way. I experimented with different
ways of walking, with different ways
of holding my body. I was fine with
and proud of having a more femi
nine walk, of portraying my mas
culinity in a non-normative way.
Maybe it's because of the testos
terone and how I've added on mus
cle particularly my arms and
shoulders but now I carry myself

differently, walk differently. Physi
cally, in many ways, I'm much more
traditionally masculine than I was
before.
But the most jarring aspect to my
transition is how I relate to women,
particularly women I am interested
in. I never participated in college
hookup culture because I just didn't
get it. I never learned the signals that
girls give guys if they want to dance,
make out, have sex. The idea of
hookups was all very foreign to me,
even at the beginning of this school
year. But at this point of my transi
tion, I'm slowly becoming more and
more familiar, more and more
aligned with the more conventional
ways that men and women interact
with each other sexually.
Of course, I'm not the type to
hook up with people, (as I men
tioned in last week's column), but
I've become more familiar with this
whole heterosexual courting para
digm. I'm becoming a traditional
guy in terms of how I go about treat

ing someone I'm interested in I
feel compelled to pick up the tab,
hold open doors, just those things
that men traditionally do. I have this
weird impulse to be a gentleman,
which I know is problematic, since
the idea of the gentleman does to a
degree stem from sexism and chau
vinism, but all this comes with being
culturally indoctrinated as a straight
man.
Don't get me wrong. I'm very
happy with my transition. I'm happy
with how my body is turning out. I'm
happy with my voice, I'm overall so
much happier than I was two years
ago, when I first was coming out. But
at the same time, I feel like I'm los
ing something. I once prided myself
in being able to relate to women, in
claiming women's spaces as my
spaces but now, I feel that I am
separating myself from women, re
lating to them as straight men relate
to them. I'm transforming into a reg
ular guy, the guy you'd have a beer
with, the guy you'd give a slap on the
back. It's so strange. And to tell you
the truth, I'm not very sure how I
feel about it yet.
