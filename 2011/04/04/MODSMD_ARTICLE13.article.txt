# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Becoming One of the "Guys" 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So last Monday I had my first
day of a class called "Feminism
and American Literature."
Being both a fan of literature and
feminism, I was pretty excited that
day. However, as I sat there, I felt a
bit off. I felt flustered, guarded, on
edge, vulnerable. I had no idea why
I felt this way. It wasn't until about
halfway through the class that I re
alized I was the only male-identi
fied person in the room. And for the
first time, I became acutely aware of
my maleness.
This class was the first time I ever
felt out of place in a female space. It
was strange before, I was so much
more comfortable in female spaces
than male spaces. As someone who
has studied both English and Femi
nist Studies, I was pretty used to
being the minority in female-domi
nated academic spaces. During my
freshman year, I even lived on an all
girls' floor. (Yes, I got to live the
dream of living with all girls. It was

awesome.) I've always felt that I re
lated more to women than to men.
But now, as I continue that transi
tion, I feel like that dynamic is chang
ing.
The moment of conception for
this column occurred when one of
my best friends told me how he no
ticed that I acted a lot straighter now
compared to the beginning of my
transition. And although I do identi
fy as "queer" and consider myself
part of the queer community, my
other queer friends have seen me
more as a straight boy than a queer
boy. And I admit that I'm beginning
to see myself less as queer and more
as someone who's straight. I'm slow
ly becoming more and more like a
guy like a normal guy. And what
ever the hell normal is, I'm not sure,
but I sure feel it.
I've taken a lot of traditionally
male mannerisms. I go to the gym. I
drink beer. I know how to joke
around with other guys. I've noticed

that my walk has become a lot
straighter I'm not very sure how
to explain it. When I was just begin
ning to transition, I had a very non
normative sort of walk, the sort of
walk that signaled to people that I
was not a normal guy. I wasn't very
sure how to move in a masculine
way. I experimented with different
ways of walking, with different ways
of holding my body. I was fine with
and proud of having a more femi
nine walk, of portraying my mas
culinity in a non-normative way.
Maybe it's because of the testos
terone and how I've added on mus
cle particularly my arms and
shoulders but now I carry myself
