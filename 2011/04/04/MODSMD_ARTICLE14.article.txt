# OP-ED
## Vote Abstain, Vote Equally 
### LEANNA KEYES '14 
On the General Election ballot, Measure
A asks students their opinion on
whether ROTC should return to cam
pus, with three options: support, oppose or ab
stain. I, as a transgender student, encourage you
to vote abstain.
Much of the debate about ROTC's potential
return to campus has been framed as a conflict
between patriotism and anti-militarism. How
ever, this discussion ignores the policy-based
implications of Stanford University supporting,
endorsing and funding a program that discrimi
nates against our students.
Our university has an official non-discrimi
nation clause that reads, "Stanford University
admits qualified students of any race, color, na
tional or ethnic origin, sex, age, disability, reli
gion, sexual orientation, and gender identity to
all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities
generally accorded or made available to stu
dents at the University."
ROTC is bound to uphold the policies of the
U.S. military and so excludes students that it de
termines to be transgender, intersex or disabled
and, at least until the military officially imple
ments the Congressional repeal of Don't Ask,
Don't Tell, students who identify as lesbian, gay
or bisexual. This means that there are students
at Stanford who are unequivocally unable to
participate in the program. This has nothing to
do with patriotism or militarism; ithastodo with
discrimination and civil rights.
Voting to abstain sends a message to the Fac
ulty Senate who actually will decide the ques
tion posed. Voting to abstain says that this is a
matter of policy, not opinion. There is no opin
ion in the fact that Stanford has an official poli
cy protecting its students from the discrimina

tion we would face if an explicitly exclusionary
institution returns to campus.
Often when I'm having this discussion with
students, I am asked how many transgender stu
dents there are at Stanford, to the effect olj "It's
such a small community, does it really matter if
it's excluded?"To this I respond: Is there a quan
tifiable amount of discrimination that you find
acceptable? If it's just me, is discrimination
morally palatable? If we have nine transgen
dered people, is it okay for ROTC to return, but
if we have 10, should ROTC not return until it
changes its policies? Do we want to be the kind
of university that accepts discrimination if the
community being oppressed is small enough
that it isn't seen or heard by the majority?
Stand with me for social equality. Stand with
me, and vote abstain on Measure A.
