# How I Found Identity and Inspiration in the Asian Greek Community
## 
### JESSICA UNO.'11 Member of alpha Kappa Delta Phi 
When I first came to Stanford from a pre
dominantly Caucasian suburb, I was
terrified by the sheer number of Asian
Americans. This discomfort stemmed from hav
ing not been comfortable with my own Asian-
American identity. I am half Japanese and half
Chinese, speak English at home and hold my
chopsticks incorrectly. I joined the Japanese and
Vietnamese cultural societies to find my inner
Asian but quickly dropped out, feeling out of
place. Consequently, I avoided the Asian com
munity until I attended Asian-interest sorority
rush events for the Korean BBQ. As I gobbled

the free food, I realized that I really enjoyed the
company of the girls I met, an enthusiastic fam
ily who made me feel welcome. After joining
alpha Kappa Delta Phi (KDPhi), establishing
my cultural identity went from a struggle to an
exciting exploration. KDPhi does not define it
self by any ethnicity but unites women of all
backgrounds, from Cambodian to Vietnamese
to Mexican and African American. Through my
sisters, I learned about Vietnamese immigration
struggles, Japanese-American internment, sex
trafficking in Southeast Asia and all over the
world, disability discrimination in the Philip
pines and racism against Hmong communities
in the Midwest; I also tested my ability to eat
pho three times a week. Thanks to the Asian
Greek community, I am finally proud of my
mixed heritage and am deeply inspired by the
heritages of others.
While Asian Greeks are certainly active in
sociopolitical issues, we do not stamp our letters
on every act of leadership and achievement,
often executed through groups not under
AASA. My sisters have founded and led organ
izations like the Stanford Student Journal of
Global Health which fosters service in develop
ing Asian countries, the Asian American Well
ness Program which promotes mental wellness
for Asian-Americans, Initiative Against Malar
ia which raises funds for bednets in Southeast
Asia, Arbor and Pacific Free Clinic which serves
poor Asian immigrants, and the Asia Pacific En
trepreneurship Society (ASES) which connects
students with Asian-Pacific entrepreneurs and
markets. My sisters fiercely support one anoth
er in even these non-sorority projects. The Asian
Greek organizations provide valuable net
works that support community leaders in both
individual and group endeavors to better condi
tions for our fellow Asians. To say that we do not
know what it means to be Asian American is to

ignore the wealth of inspiring acts that Asian
Greeks provide all over campus.
There is a lot of misunderstanding about the
role of Asian-interest Greeks at Stanford. We
are not purely a social club, purely a service or
ganization or purely about being Asian. We
came together seeking sisterhood both in our
commonalities and our differences. We cannot
be defined by any one label, because our soror
ity allows us to combine all our passions rather
than limit ourselves to a narrow range of mis
sions. Of course, there is always room for im
proving the unity of the Asian community, and
breaking through apathy towards political caus
es is a challenge facing all student groups. Still,
the members in the Asian Greek community
and their commitment to Asian-American is
sues make me proud to rep my letters.
