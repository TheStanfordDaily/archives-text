# Janitors' Struggle Continues
## 
### ERIC GRIFFIS '12 KARINA REYES, JANITOR 
The viewpoints of janitors and students
have been consistently missing from the
public discussion of the attempted Stan
ford janitor firings in December 2010, and as a
member of the Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion and a Stanford janitor, respectively, we are
writing to present our side of the story.
Federal law did not require the criminal
background checks or the particular identity
checks that caused the janitors' job crisis. UGL
UNICCO and Stanford required criminal back
ground checks like the previous company,
ABM, did. The vast majority of jani
tors passed the criminal background
check. With respect to identity
checks, federal law requires a valida
tion of authorization to work in the
United States via the 1-9 form. UGL
UNICCO did not disclose the re
quirements for its "identity check,"
and only after our campaign did the
company finally ask for 1-9 docu
ments from all the workers. All the
workers provided these documents
required for legal authorization to
work in the United States. Therefore,
whatever problems that may have
come up with the additional identity
checks that UGL-UNICCO per
formed were not a valid reason to
end these workers' jobs.
Many factors lead to discrepan
cies in the identity checks. Databases
are usually rife with clerical errors, es
pecially with Latino names. In fact,
Section 1324(b), paragraph 6 of the
Immigration and Nationality Act ex
plicitly states that requesting more
documents, as UGL-UNICCO has
done "shall be treated as an unfair
immigration-related employment
practice if made for the purpose or
with the intent of discriminating
against an individual." There is rea
son to believe that UGL-UNICCO
has violated this act.
Originally, 55 of the 134 janitors
received letters saying UGL-UNIC
CO could not verify their identity
and that UGL-UNICCO would not
offer them work after Dec. 1. Hearing
about these firings from the janitors
prompted SLAC to send out a peti
tion to gather support from the Stan
ford community for the janitors.
After receiving an overwhelmingly
supportive response from the Stan
ford community, Stanford and UGL
UNICCO involved students and
workers in the discussion. They
began rehiring some workers, though
many janitors remained jobless. The
workers organized several marches
and one four-hour work stoppage.
The workers' actions and union ne
gotiations led to UGL-UNICCO's
provisional offer to rehire the work
ers once they presented their 1-9
form, pending a grievance claim.

In firing the janitors, UGL
UNICCO violated the requirement
of the collective bargaining agree
ment they have with the janitors'
union, SEIU Local 1877, that re
quires new subcontractors rehire all
workers with full pay and benefits.
Most of the fired janitors, some of
whom have worked at Stanford for
over 15 years, had enough seniority to
make up to $13.09 per hour with full
benefits, including health insurance
for their families. Newly hired jani
tors started at $9.15 per hour with no
benefits, including healthcare. New
hires would have received benefits
for themselves after one year and
benefits for their family after two
years. Since Stanford's payment to
UGL-UNICCO is set at a monthly
sum, UGL-UNICCO stood to gain
hundreds of thousands of dollars
from firing janitors with seniority and
replacing them with a group of new
hires.

Stanford chose UGL-UNICCO
over other potential subcontractors
despite it not being the lowest-cost
choice, because Stanford believed
UGL-UNICCO would provide
quality service based on its perform
ance at other schools. Complying
with contractual requirements partly
defines quality service. UGL-UNIC
CO has violated its union contract on
top of having a history of worker mis
treatment. According to a Harvard
Crimson article (2002),UGL-UNIC
CO used anti-worker cost-cutting
strategies, such as employing part
time janitors to avoid providing
healthcare both on Harvard campus
and in the Boston area.
The situation is far from over
29 workers anxiously await the re
sults of the grievance claim, which
will be decided on May 4. If the griev
ance claim is not found in their favor,
these janitors will lose their jobs, and
the only other formal complaint
process available is an unfair labor
practice claim, which typically takes
five-to-seven years to decide. We
must remain vigilant of companies
both on and off campus that would
abuse good workers to make a quick
buck. Companies should reward
those who work hard at their jobs,
and people should not be subject to
the financial whims of corporations.

despite it not being the lowest-cost
choice, because Stanford believed
UGL-UNICCO would provide
quality service based on its perform
ance at other schools. Complying
with contractual requirements partly
defines quality service. UGL-UNIC
CO has violated its union contract on
top of having a history of worker mis
treatment. According to a Harvard
Crimson article (2002),UGL-UNIC
CO used anti-worker cost-cutting
strategies, such as employing part
time janitors to avoid providing
healthcare both on Harvard campus
and in the Boston area.
The situation is far from over
29 workers anxiously await the re
sults of the grievance claim, which
will be decided on May 4. If the griev
ance claim is not found in their favor,
these janitors will lose their jobs, and
the only other formal complaint
process available is an unfair labor
practice claim, which typically takes
five-to-seven years to decide. We
must remain vigilant of companies
both on and off campus that would
abuse good workers to make a quick
buck. Companies should reward
those who work hard at their jobs,
and people should not be subject to
the financial whims of corporations.
