## SUPER SENIORS Pepperdine falls on Senior Night 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Saturday night was Senior Night at
Maples Pavilion, but it was the under
classmen that stepped up and helped
send the class of 2011 out in style with
a 3-1 victory over No. 13 Pepperdine in
the last regular season home game of
the year.
Freshman outside hitter/middle
backer Eric Mochalski had a career
high of 11 kills and hit .611 with no er
rors, and junior outside hitter Brad
Lawson notched his second straight
double-double with 19 kills and 10 digs
while hitting .341 for the match.

The No. 3 Cardinal (17-7,13-6
MPSF) came out strong, hitting .478 in
the first set and jumped all over the
Waves to take game one, 25-15.
But things leveled out in the second
set as Stanford's attack cooled off and
Pepperdine rebounded.The two teams
traded points for most of the game,
with neither side gaining much of an
advantage until Stanford used a Law
son kill to move to set point at 24-23.
But the Card couldn't convert and
failed to capitalize on two subsequent
set points with Pepperdine (5-13,5-13),
who eventually took the set on two
blocks by Matt Pollock and Maurice
Torres.
The setback seemed to jolt the Car
dinal's offense back into gear, and
Lawson and McLachlin stepped up
their games in the third set Stanford
nearly doubled its hitting percentage
from game two to game three. With
McLachlin serving, Stanford won four
straight points and held a slight lead
midway through the set.
The lead grew to four points at 20-
16, but Pepperdine refused to quit de
spite offensive woes the Waves hit
just .216 for the match and hit below
.135 in games one and four.
It wasn't until Lawson slammed
home one of junior setter Evan Barry's

50 assists on set point number three
that the crowd of 1,268 could exhale.
Playing with a 2-1 lead, the Card ap
peared to loosen up a bit, but couldn't
shake Pepperdine and the balanced of
fensive attack of Pollock, Torres and
Cory Riecks, each of whom had at least
10 kills, with Torres tying Lawson for
the match high at 19.
Stanford slipped into a 13-10 hole,
but slowly worked the sideout game to
retake the lead at 15-14. With the

crowd's support, the lead swelled to
three, and then a late surge gave the
Cardinal the set and match, 25-20.
Fittingly, it was the senior McLach
lin who put away the final point as his
father, assistant coach Chris McLach
lin, looked on from the bench. In addi
tion, the victory moved Stanford's
graduating class of McLachlin, lan

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
The underclassmen and seniors alike put on a show on Senior Night. Freshman
outside hitter Eric Mochalski, above, tallied 11 kills and no errors for a .611
hitting percentage as Stanford cruised to a 3-1 win over Pepperdine.
Henrikson and Jordan Inafuku (as
well as redshirt junior Garrett
Dobbs) within two victories of the
all-time mark for career victories in
school history, with 79.
But the celebratory atmosphere
Saturday at Maples Pavilion con
trasted with the tense and volatile
tone of Friday night, when a show
down with No. 1 USC had a rowdy
crowd of 1,645 on edge. USC (17-1,
16-1) pulled out a 3-1 victory in the
end, but after a dominating first set
by the Trojans, a late-arriving crowd
energized Stanford as they battled
back to take the second set 25-21
and seized the momentum.
USC's combination of Tony Cia
relli and Steven Shandrick led the
team. Ciarelli led all players with 21
kills and hit .500 with four aces and
eight digs, and Shandrick hit .474
with 10 kills and eight block assists.
The duo helped the Trojans over
come what was otherwise a quiet of
fensive night for the team. Ail-
American Murphy Troy hit just .059

for the match with eight kills, and
USC hit just .290 as a team (com
pared to Stanford's .305), but picked
its spots well.
With Stanford down 18-17 in the
critical third set, Ciarelli smashed
through the Stanford block to give
the Trojans a three-point cushion
that they would not relinquish. It
was Shandrick who blocked Lawson
for set point.
The Cardinal took a three-point
lead in the fourth set at 12-9, but
USC proved why it has lost just one
match all year as it chipped away
and eventually took its first lead
since the opening point at 22-21. A
few blocks later and the Trojans
were heading to the busses with
their 11th straight win, but the match
showed that Stanford can hold its
own against the best in the country.
The Cardinal is still in a tight race
with BYU for the No. 2 seed in the
MPSF and controls its own destiny
by virtue of its series sweep of the
Cougars. With just five matches re
maining in conference play, Stan
ford heads south to face UC-Santa
Barbara on Friday night.
