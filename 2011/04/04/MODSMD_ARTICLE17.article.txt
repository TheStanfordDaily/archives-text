## SUPER SENIORS Pepperdine falls on Senior Night 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Saturday night was Senior Night at
Maples Pavilion, but it was the under
classmen that stepped up and helped
send the class of 2011 out in style with
a 3-1 victory over No. 13 Pepperdine in
the last regular season home game of
the year.
Freshman outside hitter/middle
backer Eric Mochalski had a career
high of 11 kills and hit .611 with no er
rors, and junior outside hitter Brad
Lawson notched his second straight
double-double with 19 kills and 10 digs
while hitting .341 for the match.

The No. 3 Cardinal (17-7,13-6
MPSF) came out strong, hitting .478 in
the first set and jumped all over the
Waves to take game one, 25-15.
But things leveled out in the second
set as Stanford's attack cooled off and
Pepperdine rebounded.The two teams
traded points for most of the game,
with neither side gaining much of an
advantage until Stanford used a Law
son kill to move to set point at 24-23.
But the Card couldn't convert and
failed to capitalize on two subsequent
set points with Pepperdine (5-13,5-13),
who eventually took the set on two
blocks by Matt Pollock and Maurice
Torres.
The setback seemed to jolt the Car
dinal's offense back into gear, and
Lawson and McLachlin stepped up
their games in the third set Stanford
nearly doubled its hitting percentage
from game two to game three. With
McLachlin serving, Stanford won four
straight points and held a slight lead
midway through the set.
The lead grew to four points at 20-
16, but Pepperdine refused to quit de
spite offensive woes the Waves hit
just .216 for the match and hit below
.135 in games one and four.
It wasn't until Lawson slammed
home one of junior setter Evan Barry's

50 assists on set point number three
that the crowd of 1,268 could exhale.
Playing with a 2-1 lead, the Card ap
peared to loosen up a bit, but couldn't
shake Pepperdine and the balanced of
fensive attack of Pollock, Torres and
Cory Riecks, each of whom had at least
10 kills, with Torres tying Lawson for
the match high at 19.
Stanford slipped into a 13-10 hole,
but slowly worked the sideout game to
retake the lead at 15-14. With the

crowd's support, the lead swelled to
three, and then a late surge gave the
Cardinal the set and match, 25-20.
Fittingly, it was the senior McLach
lin who put away the final point as his
father, assistant coach Chris McLach
lin, looked on from the bench. In addi
tion, the victory moved Stanford's
graduating class of McLachlin, lan
