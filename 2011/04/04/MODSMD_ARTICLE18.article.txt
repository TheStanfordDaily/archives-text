# WRESTLING WITH WAZZU
## Offense on and off in crazy series win 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
opened up its Pac-10 season the right
way this past weekend, grabbing the
Saturday and Sunday games to secure
a series victory over the Washington
State Cougars.
The series win was especially criti
cal considering the way the Cardinal
(13-7, 2-1 Pac-10) started the week
end, as it blew an eight-run lead and a
great pitching performance by sopho
more Mark Appel on Friday night to
fall to the Cougars (11-12,1-5).

The Cardinal jumped out to a big
lead thanks to a blasted three-run
home run from catcher Zach Jones
and a solo shot from freshman first
baseman Brian Ragira. Appel gave
the Card another strong start, blowing
away seven batters with a devastating
fastball-slider combo.

Appel gave up two runs in the bot
tom of the seventh to cut the Stanford
lead to 8-2 and then exploded on the

Cardinal bullpen when Appel's night
was over after he looked to be in line
to get the win. Appel gave up only the
two runs over seven innings and
struck out a career-high of seven bat
ters.
Freshman A.J. Vanegas gave up
three straight hits before junior Scott
Snodgress relieved him and gave up
five runs before he was pulled for jun
ior Chris Reed.
Cougar right fielder Derek Jones,
the first batter Reed faced, then con
nected on a fastball and blasted a
three-run home run out to right field,
giving the Cougars a 10-8 lead.
The potentially devastating loss
didn't affect the Cardinal for long
though, even when it was faced with
the added adversity of snowy weather
conditions.
A 2 p.m. start was delayed to 5:30
p.m. after rain and snow came down
on Bailey-Brayton field, but the Car
dinal showed no signs of a hangover
when it got on the board early and
didn't stop scoring the entire night.
Another three-run bomb from
Jones, his second of the weekend,
made the score 9-0 in the second in
ning, and a colossal grand slam from
Ragira made the score 16-1 before a
33-minute snow delay put a break in
the action in the top of the fifth.
The snow and the Cougar bullpen
didn't stop the scoring onslaught, as
every Cardinal starter recorded a hit.
Freshman right fielder Austin Wilson
added another three-run dinger over
the left-field wall to make the score
21-1, and freshman Lonnie Kauppila
went 6-for-6 with a triple and five
RBI.
When it was all said and done,
Stanford had a 22-3 win, the first time
Stanford had scored over 20 runs
since 2007.
Not to be overshadowed in the of
fensive explosion was junior starter
Jordan Pries, who did his part to se
cure the Stanford victory and push his
record to 4-1 by giving up only two
runs on five hits through seven in
nings.
With the series on the line on Sun
day, the Cardinal turned to sopho
more righty Dean McArdle, who de-
