# WRESTLING WITH WAZZU
## Offense on and off in crazy series win 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
opened up its Pac-10 season the right
way this past weekend, grabbing the
Saturday and Sunday games to secure
a series victory over the Washington
State Cougars.
The series win was especially criti
cal considering the way the Cardinal
(13-7, 2-1 Pac-10) started the week
end, as it blew an eight-run lead and a
great pitching performance by sopho
more Mark Appel on Friday night to
fall to the Cougars (11-12,1-5).

The Cardinal jumped out to a big
lead thanks to a blasted three-run
home run from catcher Zach Jones
and a solo shot from freshman first
baseman Brian Ragira. Appel gave
the Card another strong start, blowing
away seven batters with a devastating
fastball-slider combo.

Appel gave up two runs in the bot
tom of the seventh to cut the Stanford
lead to 8-2 and then exploded on the

Cardinal bullpen when Appel's night
was over after he looked to be in line
to get the win. Appel gave up only the
two runs over seven innings and
struck out a career-high of seven bat
ters.
Freshman A.J. Vanegas gave up
three straight hits before junior Scott
Snodgress relieved him and gave up
five runs before he was pulled for jun
ior Chris Reed.
Cougar right fielder Derek Jones,
the first batter Reed faced, then con
nected on a fastball and blasted a
three-run home run out to right field,
giving the Cougars a 10-8 lead.
The potentially devastating loss
didn't affect the Cardinal for long
though, even when it was faced with
the added adversity of snowy weather
conditions.
A 2 p.m. start was delayed to 5:30
p.m. after rain and snow came down
on Bailey-Brayton field, but the Car
dinal showed no signs of a hangover
when it got on the board early and
didn't stop scoring the entire night.
Another three-run bomb from
Jones, his second of the weekend,
made the score 9-0 in the second in
ning, and a colossal grand slam from
Ragira made the score 16-1 before a
33-minute snow delay put a break in
the action in the top of the fifth.
The snow and the Cougar bullpen
didn't stop the scoring onslaught, as
every Cardinal starter recorded a hit.
Freshman right fielder Austin Wilson
added another three-run dinger over
the left-field wall to make the score
21-1, and freshman Lonnie Kauppila
went 6-for-6 with a triple and five
RBI.
When it was all said and done,
Stanford had a 22-3 win, the first time
Stanford had scored over 20 runs
since 2007.
Not to be overshadowed in the of
fensive explosion was junior starter
Jordan Pries, who did his part to se
cure the Stanford victory and push his
record to 4-1 by giving up only two
runs on five hits through seven in
nings.
With the series on the line on Sun
day, the Cardinal turned to sopho
more righty Dean McArdle, who de-

Freshman Lonnie Kauppita, above, went 6-for-6 with a triple and five RBI as the
Cardinal piled on 22 against Washington State on Saturday for Stanford's first
of two wins in the weekend series against the Cougars.
livered another good pitching per
formance from a starting rotation
that lowered its collective ERA to
1.74 this weekend.
The Cougar bullpen was its own
worst enemy on Sunday, giving up
back-to-back bases-loaded walks to
help the Cardinal out to a 4-0 lead
through the top of the sixth.
However, the Cougar offense
rallied with three runs in the bot
tom of the sixth due to two fielding
errors from sophomore Tyler

Gaffney in center field who was
forced into the unfamiliar spot in
the outfield after typical center
fielder Jake Stewart was scratched
from the lineup.
Gaffney's two gaffes, coupled
with two more errors from Kauppila
and Snodgress, made things tight
going down the stretch, but Reed
came in determined to redeem him
self and secure the win with the game
on the line in the eighth inning.
Reed pitched one and two
thirds innings of flawless baseball to
grab his fourth save of the early sea
son and give McArdle a 4-1 record
after he went six and two-thirds in
nings and gave up just four hits and
no earned runs. The win was also

head coach Mark Marquess'
1,400 th career victory.
The series win was Stanford's
second weekend series victory in a
row after knocking off Long Beach
State last week, and the two wins
leave Stanford in a good position as
it primes for a long Pac-10 season
that will feature matchups against
four top-25 teams.
The Cardinal returns home for a
Tuesday matchup against San Jose
State at 5:30 p.m. before heading
south on its fifth road trip of the
season for another Pac-10 series
against the USC Trojans.
