trepreneurship and integrating tech
nology with the ASSU and the
greater student body an initiative
they call "Stanford 2.0."
"It's bringing Silicon Valley into
Stanford," said Macgregor-Dennis.
"There are things that we feel need
to get done, and then there are things
that we're really passionate about.
The Daily spoke with both Cruz
and his peers to evaluate his prior ex
perience and the feasibility of these
goals if elected. Certain traits be
came themes: hard work, attention to
detail, a cover-to-cover understand
ing of the body's constitution. But
when pushed deeper, a division of
views occurred: those in the 11th
Senate saw the younger Cruz as ded
icated, yet meek; those in the 12th
Senate encountered a mature and
dynamic leader.
"My first term was very much a
learning experience, the second term
was an implementation of what I had
learned," Cruz said.
In the 11th Senate, which current
senators described as more fractured
than the current one, Cruz served as
the deputy chair of the Appropria
tions Committee, which handles the
funding of student groups. The group
became known for its conservative
approach to money allocation, and

Cruz was often a dissenting voice.
"I understood that we were in a
budget crisis, but that it affected the
ASSU different than it affected
Stanford, and we had to respond in a
different way," he said. "Our policies
were perhaps a mixed bag."
Shelley Gao 'll, who served with
him in the general body, described
Cruz as a quieter type who tended to
remain neutral on specific issues.
"I don't think he did anything
striking or controversial that war
ranted attention," said Gao, who
serves on The Daily's Board of Di
rectors.

However, Cardona pointed to
significant growth between the two
years. Cruz was the only senator to
be reelected for the 12th session and
then assumed role of chair. The 11th
Senate had a late departure from of
fice because of continued debate on
divestment. As a result, there was a
rushed transition for new senators
toward the end of the academic year,
but current senators said that Cruz
was instrumental in ensuring that it
was as smooth as possible,
"He took the lead in easing us
into our roles," said Rebecca Sachs
'l3.

When the Senate reconvened in
the fall, Cruz and others said his
focus was mainly on internal reform.
"The ASSU can be unresponsive,
uncommunicative and inefficient,"
he said. "If we wanted to serve the
student body well, we had to know
what they wanted us to do, and have

the mechanisms in place to do it
well."
Cardona and Senator Daniel
Khalessi 'l3 pointed to Cruz's col
laborative mentality as instrumental
to the 12th Senate's success; Car
dona pointed specifically to his work
in support of a special fees reform
bill that originally had little backing
and required coalition building to
pass. She said that those traits were
instrumental in her selection of Cruz
as her replacement vice president.
Cardona and Sachs both pointed
to a complimentary relationship be
tween Cruz and Macgregor-Dennis.
Cardona described the former as de
tail-oriented and the latter as more
focused on the big picture.
"I think it's synergistic," Macgre
gor-Dennis said. "When we're work
ing together, we can delegate pretty
well."
Members of both the 11th and
12th Senates were intrigued by what
shape a potential Cruz administra
tion would take.
"This is his opportunity to be a
leader," Brian Wanyoike 'l2, who
was on Appropriations in the 11th
Senate, said.
"He saw Jonny Dorsey run a
team, he saw David Gobaud, he saw
me, he saw a number of different
styles," Cardona said. "He could fuse
them. He'll be in a position to exe
cute."
