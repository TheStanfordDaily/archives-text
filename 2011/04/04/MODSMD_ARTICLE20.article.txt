# Can mid-majors contend every year?
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
I have a serious question.
Why are you watching
today's men's national
championship game? I'm
not implying that you
shouldn't, but if you really think
about it, do you have a reason to?
If you're reading this column,
it means you're probably a sports
fan, so maybe that is reason is
enough to watch the national
title game. Or maybe you have
some connection to Connecticut
or Butler, in which case that is
definitely reason enough. But if
this was November, would you
watch a Butler-Connecticut
game? Maybe, but probably not
and I seriously doubt many of
you have this matchup in your
bracket. But if you do, I tip my
proverbial cap to you.
Regardless of your reason,
most of you will watch the game
tonight. So will I; but still, I'm cer
tain that tonight's game will not
be watched by nearly as many
people as it would if it was, say,
North Carolina versus Kansas.
You're probably asking your
self, "Where is he going with
this?" What I'm trying to do here
is ask: is it good for college bas

ketball to have to relatively unex
pected teams play in the title
game? That question also gets to
the heart of one of college sports'
biggest conflicts major con
ferences versus mid-majors.
On the one hand, college
sports are a business, and the
major conferences consistently
bring in more revenue and more
television viewers. I don't have
figures to express this, but I don't
think many people would dis
pute that notion.
With that in mind, there are
also the issues of building pro
grams, building legacies and
building fan bases. Nobody
should have the power to deem
one school as inherently better
than another. The Kentuckys,
UCLAs and Dukes of the world
only became the programs that
they are today with large,

traveling fan bases because of
long periods of sustained success.
Butler has now reached two con
secutive title games. Maybe we are
witnessing the Bulldogs' transition
from a team on the periphery of the
national scene to one that will be
able to continually recruit talent and
be a contender year in and year out.
The so-called mid-major schools
have had representatives that swoop
onto the scene for short periods of
time UNLV in the late 80's and
early 90's and Utah in the 90's and
early 2000's come to mind but
few that contend every season
(Gonzaga?).
Would it be a good thing if there
were more perennial mid-major con
tenders? Probably. Some people
might argue that it takes away from
the Cinderella aspect of the NCAA
Tournament that people love so
much. If mid-majors are expected to
do well, then it wouldn't be quite as
thrilling when a George Mason or a
VCU goes to the Final Four at least
that's what the argument would be.
I don't necessarily think that

would be the case, because I don't
think that being a Cinderella team is
predicated on being a mid-major but
rather on being a low seed. If San
Diego State a two-seed in this
year's bracket were in the Final
Four right now, I don't think people
would be thinking of the Aztecs as
Cinderellas. Along the same lines, if
12-seeded Clemson, a member of the
ACC, was in the Final Four, that
would be a Carl Spackler-esque Cin
derella Story.
The biggest hurdle that mid-ma
jors have to vault is the widely held
idea that they are simply not as good
as the major programs, because they
don't get five-star recruits, and they
don't play as grueling of conference
schedules (arguably). That's why
people question how a team like
VCU coming out of the Colonial
Athletic Association with 11 losses
can be in the tournament. I guess
the moral of the story is that every
team is just one team; it doesn't mat
ter what conference that team comes
from or if it's considered a mid
major or not it is simply impossi
ble to predict how one team will fare
against another on any given day.
