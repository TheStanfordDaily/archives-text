# Can mid-majors contend every year?

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
I have a serious question.
Why are you watching
today's men's national
championship game? I'm
not implying that you
shouldn't, but if you really think
about it, do you have a reason to?
If you're reading this column,
it means you're probably a sports
fan, so maybe that is reason is
enough to watch the national
title game. Or maybe you have
some connection to Connecticut
or Butler, in which case that is
definitely reason enough. But if
this was November, would you
watch a Butler-Connecticut
game? Maybe, but probably not
and I seriously doubt many of
you have this matchup in your
bracket. But if you do, I tip my
proverbial cap to you.
Regardless of your reason,
most of you will watch the game
tonight. So will I; but still, I'm cer

be watched by nearly as many
people as it would if it was, say,
North Carolina versus Kansas.
You're probably asking your
self, "Where is he going with

is ask: is it good for college bas

game? That question also gets to
the heart of one of college sports'
biggest conflicts major con

On the one hand, college
sports are a business, and the
major conferences consistently
bring in more revenue and more
television viewers. I don't have
figures to express this, but I don't
think many people would dis
pute that notion.
With that in mind, there are
also the issues of building pro
grams, building legacies and
building fan bases. Nobody
should have the power to deem
one school as inherently better
than another. The Kentuckys,
UCLAs and Dukes of the world
only became the programs that
they are today with large,
