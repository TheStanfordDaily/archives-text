## Men's gymnastics takes MPSF title in upset 
### â€“ Matt Bettonville 
The No. 2 Cardinal men's
gymnastics team will head into
the NCAA Championships
later this month with high hopes
after its victory over rival No. 3
California and top-ranked Ok
lahoma. Stanford has never won
an NCAA title without taking
the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation title in the process.
The win was a team effort
senior Ryan Lieberman led the
Card at third place in the all
around. But consistency
throughout the lineup lifted the
team to victory by posting solid
scores in every event.
Senior Tim Gentry, largely
considered Stanford's strongest
candidate at the NCAA meet,
posted an impressive 16.050 on
the still rings, with the next clos
est score a 15.600 scored by
sophomore teammate James
Fosco. Senior Alex Buscaglia
put on a similarly impressive
show on the horizontal bar with
a 15.600, a half-point above red
shirt sophomore teammate
Cameron Foreman's 15.100, the
next best score at the meet.
The impressive show at the
MPSF Championship puts
Stanford in a confident position
for the national tournament.

With its win over Oklahoma,
the Cardinal has now defeated
every team in the nation, and it
will try to repeat that feat from
April 14-16 at the NCAA cham
pionship in Columbus, Ohio.
