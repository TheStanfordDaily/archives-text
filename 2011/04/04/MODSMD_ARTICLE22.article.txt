# Top-ranked women's tennis downs Sun Devils

Staying unbeaten this sea
son, the Cardinal women's ten
nis team (18-0,5-0 Pac-10) took
six out of seven points from Ari
zona State on Friday.
The Card found itself in a
rare 0-1 deficit to start the after
noon after dropping two of
three doubles matches. The
team's senior Hilary Barte and
sophomore Mallory Burdette
scored Stanford's only doubles
victory of the day.
But the team returned to its
usual form for the rest of the
match, taking all six singles
matches to turn the initial strug
gle into a decisive victory. The
Cardinal's Nos. 1 through 4
Barte, Burdette, and freshmen
Nicole Gibbs and Kristie Ahn
all won in straight sets.
The victory marks the 175 th
consecutive win for the team at
home, as well as a continuation of
Stanford's current overall streak,
now at 37 straight wins. It also puts
a dagger into the ASU (13-4, 3-1
Pac-10), an unexpected Pac-10 con
tender this year suffering just its
first loss in the league this season.
Stanford's match against No. 30
Arizona scheduled for Saturday
was cancelled and will not be
rescheduled, so the Cardinal will
wait until this Friday to return to
action, taking on Fresno State at
1:30 p.m. at Taube Tennis Stadium.

top four singles players, propelling
the team to a 6-1 victory
over the Sun Devils.
