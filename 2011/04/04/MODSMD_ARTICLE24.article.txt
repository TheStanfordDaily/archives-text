# TENNIS NETS CLOSE WINS
## 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
defeated the Tulsa Golden Hurri
cane by the slimmest of margins, 4
to 3, on Friday evening at Taube
Tennis Stadium. No. 12 Stanford
improved to 10-5 (1-1 Pac-10) with
the victory while No. 31 Tulsa fell to
14-6. The Cardinal wrapped up the
weekend in Tucson, dealing the Ari
zona Wildcats a 5-2 loss.
Two international underclass
men led Tulsa sophomore
Marcelo Arevalo of El Salvador
and freshman Japie De Klerk of
South Africa who both achieved
impressive statement victories.
Arevalo and De Klerk posted
Tulsa's lone win in the three dou
bles matches, defeating Dennis Lin
and Matt Kandath of the Cardinal,
8-5. In the singles, Arevalo was pit
ted against junior Bradley Klahn,
Stanford's No. 1 and the nations No.
11 player. Arevalo, ranked No. 46,
went in as the underdog yet man
aged to upset Klahn (1-6, 6-3, 7-5)

and assert himself as a young player
on the rise. The freshman De Klerk,
ranked No. 99, had the task of tak
ing on Stanford's No. 2 player, No.
32 Ryan Thacher. Like his team
mate Klahn, Thacher fell to a
younger and lower-seeded oppo
nent in three sets, 3-6,6-1,6-4.

Luckily for Stanford's top two
singles players, the back of the Car
dinal lineup came up big against the
Hurricane. Seniors Alex Clayton
and Greg Hirshmann, along with
sophomore Matt Kandath, all de
feated their Tulsa foes to provide
Stanford with the critical four
points needed for a victory.
Kandath was the closer for the
Cardinal on Friday, finishing his
match by defeating his opponent 6-
4 in the third set and giving the team
its pivotal fourth point. Tulsa has
had a disparity of success between
its top four lineup slots and its lower
two. Over the course of the team's
last six matches, the top four have
thrived and are a combined 20-4,
whereas the bottom two have strug
gled to the tune of a 5-7 record.
After Friday's victory, the Cardi
nal headed south to Tucson to do
battle with the No. 56 Arizona Wild
cats. The team followed up its close
victory over Tulsa in Friday's match

with a more decisive 5-2 win on
Sunday. The Wildcats were blitzed
early and often in this match, losing
the first five contests before eking
out the final two.
These two wins were crucial for
the Cardinal, both to hold its posi
tion in the fickle national rankings
and to gain confidence as it heads
into a difficult week that will feature
three highly ranked opponents. First
up is No. 26 San Diego on Wednes
day at home, and then Stanford will
head north to take on Washington
and Oregon over the weekend.
