Despite a lack of significant ASSU expe
rience, the Executive slate of Tenzin Seldon
'l2 and Joe Vasquez 'll believe that their
extensive work with numerous communi
ties around campus makes them ideally
suited to become ASSU Executives. In an
interview with The Daily, Seldon and
Vasquez emphasized "bridging the gap" be
tween different groups as the key theme of
their campaign.

Joe Vasquez and Tenzin Seldon
Speaking about their relative in
experience, Vasquez believes it will
be a "tremendous benefit."
The two candidates went on to
discuss their current campus affilia
tions. Since entering Stanford as a
transfer student at the start of the
2009-10 academic year, Seldon has
been actively involved in Stanford's
community centers and its ethnic
communities. Vasquez has extensive
experience in Stanford Student En
terprises and with the Greek system
as a member of Kappa Sigma. Both
individuals are also heavily involved
with first generation and low-in
come students, and have made out
reach to them a central tenet of their
campaign.

"Our role is to go out into those
communities and be the utility for
these communities, to collaborate
with one another on these issues
on issues of diversity, on issues of
mental health, on issues of trans
parency," Seldon said. "We are the
platform where every group can
come together and talk about issues
that are divisive and talk about is
sues that are uniting."
The second major plank of the
slate's platform is a focus on mental
health and wellness. When asked
what they believed was the most
pressing issue facing students today,
both Seldon and Vasquez immedi
ately highlighted a lack of dialogue
and resources around mental
health, and emphasized the focus on
mental health issues as a major
point distinguishing them from op
posing slates.
"We believe that talking about
anxiety, depression and just funda

mental things that human beings go
through is not something that a lot
of students here talk about," Seldon
said. "We want to change that cul
ture that's on a community level,
but that's also a very individual
level."

"What we mean by mental
health is not just access to Vaden
and the Bridge," she said. "What we
mean is a more institutionalized and
systematic culture that has been
built, which is lack of courses
around mental health, lack of events
that talk about issues of depression
and anxiety that's what we're
trying to change."

Current ASSU President An
gelina Cardona 'll approved of the
slate's commitment to mental
health. Seldon worked in Cardona's
cabinet as the chair of diversity, tol
erance and equality.
"I am happy to see that they have
this emphasis since it is one of the
main priorities our administration
has had this year and because, more
importantly, change on these issues
takes time so having the next exec
have similar values is crucial to real
progress," Cardona wrote in an
email to The Daily.

Students who have worked with
Seldon and Vasquez in the past had
high praise for their abilities and
qualifications for the Executive po
sition. Milton Achelpohl 'l3, who
worked with Seldon on the ASSU's
diversity, tolerance and equality
team this year, agreed that her expe
rience working with a large number
of different communities as part of
the ASSU's diversity outreach ef
forts would make her a strong ASSU
President.

"What I really see with Tenzin
and Joe is a very real commitment
and passion for these issues .. .
whether it be diversity or communi
ty-building on Stanford's campus,"

he said. "I don't see them as ever
taking the status quo as enough.
Whether it's on issues of sexual vio
lence or transgender issues that are
really a hot topic now, or whether
it's on issues that are unforeseen
today, I don't imagine them just say
ing, 'OK, that's fine,' or taking a
backseat."

Keren Mikva 'l2, who worked
extensively with Vasquez as part of
Stanford Habitat for Humanity, said
she believed Vasquez's abilities
would translate well to the ASSU
Executive position.
"[Joe] is really focused on getting
people involved," she said. "A lot of
it is asking us for input and trying to
make sure that people can take own
ership of what we're working on.
He's also a really gracious leader."

of different communities as part of
the ASSU's diversity outreach ef
forts would make her a strong ASSU
President.

"What I really see with Tenzin
and Joe is a very real commitment
and passion for these issues .. .
whether it be diversity or communi
ty-building on Stanford's campus,"

he said. "I don't see them as ever
taking the status quo as enough.
Whether it's on issues of sexual vio
lence or transgender issues that are
really a hot topic now, or whether
it's on issues that are unforeseen
today, I don't imagine them just say
ing, 'OK, that's fine,' or taking a
backseat."

Keren Mikva 'l2, who worked
extensively with Vasquez as part of
Stanford Habitat for Humanity, said
she believed Vasquez's abilities
would translate well to the ASSU
Executive position.
"[Joe] is really focused on getting
people involved," she said. "A lot of
it is asking us for input and trying to
make sure that people can take own
ership of what we're working on.
He's also a really gracious leader."
