SLATE PROFILE: SELDON/VASQUEZ
Tenzin Seldon 'l2 8, Joe Vasquez 'll

Despite a lack of significant ASSU expe
rience, the Executive slate of Tenzin Seldon
'l2 and Joe Vasquez 'll believe that their
extensive work with numerous communi
ties around campus makes them ideally
suited to become ASSU Executives. In an
interview with The Daily, Seldon and
Vasquez emphasized "bridging the gap" be
tween different groups as the key theme of
their campaign.
