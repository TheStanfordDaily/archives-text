# STUDENT LIFE
## Transports for alcohol keep upward trend Total to date exceeds all of last academic year 
### ARIEL ZHOU 
Hospitalizations for alcohol
have been trending upward on
campus this year, with spikes at fra
ternity houses, freshman dorms and
among the sophomore class. In fall
quarter alone, there were 33 cases
of Stanford students being trans
ported to the emergency room for
alcohol-related incidents, accord
ing to Ralph Castro, manager of the
Substance Abuse Prevention Pro
gram at Vaden Health Center.
To date, a total of 48 students
have been transported to the hospi
tal, an increase from the 42 trans
ports in the previous academic year.
In winter quarter alone, there were
15 cases six freshmen, three
sophomores, five juniors and one
senior. Transports were divided fair
ly evenly between men and women.
Castro expects the numbers to
rise during spring quarter.
"It was a wet and rainy winter,
which I think ... lowers people's
social outlets," Castro said. "As it
starts to get sunny in spring, people
are more active ... so the numbers
will go up in the spring."
He added that Vaden will active
ly combat this trend throughout the
remainder of the academic year.
"We'll definitely be reaching out
more to the resident staff, kind of
reiterating our message," Castro
said. "We want all students, espe
cially the staff, to prevent things
from getting out of control.
According to Castro, a common
theme among students who went to
the emergency room was the fact
that no one attempted to dissuade
them from engaging in high-risk
behavior. Had that check existed, it
would have prevented them from
drinking so severely, he said.
"People drink because of social
pressure," Castro said. "We want to
change the norm.
"If someone can point out that
drinking to the point of vomiting is
not normative, and it is reckless,
people are more likely to listen," he
said. "So what we're going to do in
spring is really push the staff and
everybody to have that conversa
tion."
While the number of alcohol
transports is slightly higher this
year, the number of alcohol cita
tions handed out to undergradu

ates has actually gone down. The
Department of Public Safety
(DPS) has only given nine minor
in-possession (MIP) citations so far
this year and 10 citations for drunk
in-public (DIP) offenses. Com
pared with last year's 29 MIP and
19 DIP citations, the decrease is
significant.
"I assume that on any given
weekend, they probably could cite
100 [students] if they wanted to,
and maybe it's just that they're try
ing to be more educational," Cas
tro said. "But it sets up a false sense
of security for students.
"Those that do get cited will be
like, wait a minute, why did I get
cited, when 50 others aren't? So
there does need to be some consis
tency with that."

Statistics on the total number of
alcohol hospitalizations will be re
ported at the end of the 2010-11 ac
ademic year.
Bill Larson, a spokesperson for
DPS, declined to comment.
