# END OF THE ROAD
## Run at NCAA title falls short in national semifinals 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Another April, another heartbreak.
The Stanford women will have to keep
dreaming, at least for another year. For the
fourth time in as many seasons, the Cardinal (33-
3) fell short in the Final Four, this time to Texas

A&M (32-5) in the semifinals last night in Indi
anapolis. Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
31 points couldn't offset poor late-game offense
and foul trouble for Stanford which surrendered
a 10-point lead to the Aggies and ultimately fell
by a single point, 63-62.
"We had them down, and we didn't knock
them out," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "This is really tough for our team."
Stanford, typically a slow-start team, challenged
a tough Aggies defense early on and battled its way

to a 27-23 halftime lead. Nnemkadi
Ogwumike sank her first four bas
kets, and senior point guard Jeanntte
Pohlen knocked in a go-ahead three
pointer near the end of the half that
sent Stanford to the locker room with
a sense of control.
While the Cardinal was able to
pad its lead a bit in the second,
things turned around in a hurry.
Texas A&M began seeking sal
vation at the three-point line as its
waning offense put it back 54-44,
following a free-throw from
Nnemkadi Ogwumike. After brick
ing a couple poor shots from range,
A&M got a bit of help from Stan
ford as each of the Ogwumike sis
ters sent Aggie shooters to the line
on charging layups. Tyra White and
Danielle Adams each turned their
opportunities into three-point plays
as they powered the Aggies to an 8-
0 run that pulled them within 54-52.
That's when it all began to fall
apart for Stanford.
With freshman forward Chiney
Ogwumike out on fouls, the Aggies
quickly became the better-looking
team. Sydney Carter nailed a three
from the left wing over a leaping
Pohlen to pull within a single point,
which forced a tense timeout from
VanDerveer with 85 seconds on the
clock. Reality must have been set
tling in for the embattled Cardinal,
and things got tougher from there.
Losing Chiney was a tough blow,
even on a day she struggled a bit to
find the basket.
"It definitely hurt us," said senior
forward Kayla Pedersen. "She gives
us that fire and that passion, the of
fensive skill and defensive stops."
Both teams were out of time
outs, and like the last round of a title
fight, the final minute was a heart
wrenching flurry of two-point
punches all that mattered is who
threw the final blow. Sydney Colson
opened the frenzy for the Aggies,
turning a missed three-pointer from
sophomore forward Mikaela Ruef
into a couple of converted free
throws after drawing a foul in tran
sition. Nnemkadi Ogwumike put
Stanford back up, 60-59, with two of
her own makes from the charity
stripe. That put the clock at 0:35.
White put in a layup after eating
a few seconds off the clock, which
left Nnemkadi Ogwumike with just
19 seconds to answer. She did,
charging in to the paint and hooking
a layup over Aggies guard Danielle
Adams with an outstretched right
hand. That proved to be the final
basket of Stanford's season.
Colson charged down the court
as the clock hit five seconds, dishing
the ball away as she hit the paint.
White picked it up in the post, deal
ing the Cardinal's deathblow with a
nonchalant toss off the backboard.
Junior guard Lindy Laßocque
stumbled over Pohlen to get at the
ball, but neither of them could make
the block.
"We needed just a little more
extra effort just to stop the ball and
not allow them to get that point
blank shot," VanDerveer said about
the final basket.
Ruef tossed a hail mary with
three seconds left, but the game was
already lost. As the Aggie bench
stormed the court, the Stanford
women had a lot to take in in the
long-term, they had just fallen short
in the Final Four for the fourth

straight time. More immediately,
they were carrying an injured
Pohlen away from the court. The
Stanford captain came down hard
on her ankle on the final play, falling
to the floor and covering her face
under the basket.
Pohlen, who joined Pedersen last
week in setting the record for most
games played in a Stanford uni
form, had a solid 11 points nine
of them on threes in her final col
legiate game. As of press time, the
extent of her injury remains un
clear.
For Stanford's seniors, the loss
goes beyond frustrating they've
made the journey to the Final Four
every season, only to come up short
each time. It will be tough for Van-
Derveer and their younger team
mates to let go of that legacy.
"I can have another chance, but.
. . I feel bad for Kayla and
Jeanette," VanDerveer said. "They
wanted this. They worked hard."
"Losing the game is hard, but
losing the team is even harder,"
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said. "Not
just as teammates but as friends. We
spend every waking moment with
each other, and it's definitely been a
really fun journey."

kets, and senior point guard Jeanntte
Pohlen knocked in a go-ahead three
pointer near the end of the half that
sent Stanford to the locker room with
a sense of control.
While the Cardinal was able to
pad its lead a bit in the second,
things turned around in a hurry.
Texas A&M began seeking sal
vation at the three-point line as its
waning offense put it back 54-44,
following a free-throw from
Nnemkadi Ogwumike. After brick
ing a couple poor shots from range,
A&M got a bit of help from Stan
ford as each of the Ogwumike sis
ters sent Aggie shooters to the line
on charging layups. Tyra White and
Danielle Adams each turned their
opportunities into three-point plays
as they powered the Aggies to an 8-
0 run that pulled them within 54-52.
That's when it all began to fall
apart for Stanford.
With freshman forward Chiney
Ogwumike out on fouls, the Aggies
quickly became the better-looking
team. Sydney Carter nailed a three
from the left wing over a leaping
Pohlen to pull within a single point,
which forced a tense timeout from
VanDerveer with 85 seconds on the
clock. Reality must have been set
tling in for the embattled Cardinal,
and things got tougher from there.
Losing Chiney was a tough blow,
even on a day she struggled a bit to
find the basket.
"It definitely hurt us," said senior
forward Kayla Pedersen. "She gives
us that fire and that passion, the of
fensive skill and defensive stops."
Both teams were out of time
outs, and like the last round of a title
fight, the final minute was a heart
wrenching flurry of two-point
punches all that mattered is who
threw the final blow. Sydney Colson
opened the frenzy for the Aggies,
turning a missed three-pointer from
sophomore forward Mikaela Ruef
into a couple of converted free
throws after drawing a foul in tran
sition. Nnemkadi Ogwumike put
Stanford back up, 60-59, with two of
her own makes from the charity
stripe. That put the clock at 0:35.
White put in a layup after eating
a few seconds off the clock, which
left Nnemkadi Ogwumike with just
19 seconds to answer. She did,
charging in to the paint and hooking
a layup over Aggies guard Danielle
Adams with an outstretched right
hand. That proved to be the final
basket of Stanford's season.
Colson charged down the court
as the clock hit five seconds, dishing
the ball away as she hit the paint.
White picked it up in the post, deal
ing the Cardinal's deathblow with a
nonchalant toss off the backboard.
Junior guard Lindy Laßocque
stumbled over Pohlen to get at the
ball, but neither of them could make
the block.
"We needed just a little more
extra effort just to stop the ball and
not allow them to get that point
blank shot," VanDerveer said about
the final basket.
Ruef tossed a hail mary with
three seconds left, but the game was
already lost. As the Aggie bench
stormed the court, the Stanford
women had a lot to take in in the
long-term, they had just fallen short
in the Final Four for the fourth

straight time. More immediately,
they were carrying an injured
Pohlen away from the court. The
Stanford captain came down hard
on her ankle on the final play, falling
to the floor and covering her face
under the basket.
Pohlen, who joined Pedersen last
week in setting the record for most
games played in a Stanford uni
form, had a solid 11 points nine
of them on threes in her final col
legiate game. As of press time, the
extent of her injury remains un
clear.
For Stanford's seniors, the loss
goes beyond frustrating they've
made the journey to the Final Four
every season, only to come up short
each time. It will be tough for Van-
Derveer and their younger team
mates to let go of that legacy.
"I can have another chance, but.
. . I feel bad for Kayla and
Jeanette," VanDerveer said. "They
wanted this. They worked hard."
"Losing the game is hard, but
losing the team is even harder,"
Nnemkadi Ogwumike said. "Not
just as teammates but as friends. We
spend every waking moment with
each other, and it's definitely been a
really fun journey."

Another April, another heartbreak.
The Stanford women will have to keep
dreaming, at least for another year. For the
fourth time in as many seasons, the Cardinal (33-
3) fell short in the Final Four, this time to Texas

A&M (32-5) in the semifinals last night in Indi
anapolis. Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
31 points couldn't offset poor late-game offense
and foul trouble for Stanford which surrendered
a 10-point lead to the Aggies and ultimately fell
by a single point, 63-62.
"We had them down, and we didn't knock
them out," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "This is really tough for our team."
Stanford, typically a slow-start team, challenged
a tough Aggies defense early on and battled its way
