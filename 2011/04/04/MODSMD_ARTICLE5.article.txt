# END OF THE ROAD
## Run at NCAA title falls short in national semifinals 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Another April, another heartbreak.
The Stanford women will have to keep
dreaming, at least for another year. For the
fourth time in as many seasons, the Cardinal (33-
3) fell short in the Final Four, this time to Texas

A&M (32-5) in the semifinals last night in Indi
anapolis. Junior forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike's
31 points couldn't offset poor late-game offense
and foul trouble for Stanford which surrendered
a 10-point lead to the Aggies and ultimately fell
by a single point, 63-62.
"We had them down, and we didn't knock
them out," said Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "This is really tough for our team."
Stanford, typically a slow-start team, challenged
a tough Aggies defense early on and battled its way
