## Stanford Hospital reaches tentative agreement with nurses 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
Stanford Hospital reached a tenta
tive agreement on a new contract with
the Committee for Recognition of
Nursing Achievement (CRONA) on
Saturday. If the union's members ratify
it, the agreement will resolve a stale
mate that has dragged on for over a
year following the expiration of the
nurses' previous contract in March
2010.
Several big fights have marked
the conflict between Stanford and
CRONA, including a rejection of a
previous agreement by the nurses in
December. The union voted to au
thorize a strike last February after
the hospital attempted to impose
new contract conditions.

Key provisions of the proposed
agreement include retroactive
wage increases of 4 percent dating
back to March 2010, as well as fu
ture wage increases of 4 percent up

to April 2012 and increases of be
tween 2 and 4 percent afterward.
The length of the new contract will
be three years.
"This has been a long and tumul
tuous process," wrote CRONA
President Lorie Johnson in a press
release on Saturday. "I am very
proud of how our membership
stood together and refused to let
the hospitals impose an unfair con
tract on us.The CRONA Board and
Negotiating Committee will be rec
ommending that nurses vote to ac
cept this tentative agreement."
CRONA's membership will vote
on the contract on Thursday.
