## Downsizing frustrates students, profs 
### JANELLE WOLAK 
Class downsizing has been an in
creasing problem at Stanford for a
number of years, with more and more
students finding themselves removed
from classes due to over-enrollment.
According to Lori Cottle, Student Ser
vices Officer for Management Science
and Engineering, numerous students
faced this problem in her department
after at least six MS&E classes were
forced to limit enrollment this year.
MS&E professor Pamela Hinds
first began teaching "MS&E 180: Or
ganizations: Theory and Management"
11 years ago. At that time, she was able
to accept all interested students into
her class, "even a couple of freshmen."
This quarter, however, she had 105
students enroll for 65 available spots.
In her small seminar "MS&E 185:
Global Work," she had 75 students bid
for 20 places. In choosing applicants,
priority went to MS&E majors, juniors
and seniors. No freshmen were allowed
and only a "handful" of sophomores
were admitted.
"It's hard not to accept those stu
dents who really want to be in the class
and who have compelling reasons for
not being able to take the class again,"
Hinds said.
MS&E 180 is now taught both au
tumn and spring quarters, and the de
partment is exploring the possibility of
offering the class in winter quarter as
well.
According to Cottle, however, of
fering MS&E 180 year-round trans
lates into one fewer class taught in an
other division of the department. For
example, MS&E professor Kathleen
Eisenhardt now teaches MS&E 180 in
fall quarter instead of teaching an
upper-division course in her area of
specialization, strategy and organiza
tion.
In high-demand courses like MS&E
180, professors usually allow all inter
ested students to enroll on Axess, but
then cull the herd by having an in-class
application on the first day of the
course.
Cottle said she has not heard offi
cial complaints from students about
this system. However, students like
Paul Princen 'l3 and Nicolas Hernan
dez 'l3, who themselves underwent the
process in MS&E 180, vociferously ex
press their frustration with the system.
"My experiences with the classes in
which applications are passed out on
the first of class is that they generally
result in mass confusion, with enroll
ment decisions made arbitrarily," Prin
cen said. "A lot of unsatisfied students
feel like they've wasted their time at
tending a class that they had no chance
of getting into in the first place."
"I also think that the system as it is
doesn't have enough checks on abuse,"
Hernandez added. "For example,
