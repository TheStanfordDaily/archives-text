## Downsizing frustrates students, profs 
### JANELLE WOLAK 
Class downsizing has been an in
creasing problem at Stanford for a
number of years, with more and more
students finding themselves removed
from classes due to over-enrollment.
According to Lori Cottle, Student Ser
vices Officer for Management Science
and Engineering, numerous students
faced this problem in her department
after at least six MS&E classes were
forced to limit enrollment this year.
MS&E professor Pamela Hinds
first began teaching "MS&E 180: Or
ganizations: Theory and Management"
11 years ago. At that time, she was able
to accept all interested students into
her class, "even a couple of freshmen."
This quarter, however, she had 105
students enroll for 65 available spots.
In her small seminar "MS&E 185:
Global Work," she had 75 students bid
for 20 places. In choosing applicants,
priority went to MS&E majors, juniors
and seniors. No freshmen were allowed
and only a "handful" of sophomores
were admitted.
"It's hard not to accept those stu
dents who really want to be in the class
and who have compelling reasons for
not being able to take the class again,"
Hinds said.
MS&E 180 is now taught both au
tumn and spring quarters, and the de
partment is exploring the possibility of
offering the class in winter quarter as
well.
According to Cottle, however, of
fering MS&E 180 year-round trans
lates into one fewer class taught in an
other division of the department. For
example, MS&E professor Kathleen
Eisenhardt now teaches MS&E 180 in
fall quarter instead of teaching an
upper-division course in her area of
specialization, strategy and organiza
tion.
In high-demand courses like MS&E
180, professors usually allow all inter
ested students to enroll on Axess, but
then cull the herd by having an in-class
application on the first day of the
course.
Cottle said she has not heard offi
cial complaints from students about
this system. However, students like
Paul Princen 'l3 and Nicolas Hernan
dez 'l3, who themselves underwent the
process in MS&E 180, vociferously ex
press their frustration with the system.
"My experiences with the classes in
which applications are passed out on
the first of class is that they generally
result in mass confusion, with enroll
ment decisions made arbitrarily," Prin
cen said. "A lot of unsatisfied students
feel like they've wasted their time at
tending a class that they had no chance
of getting into in the first place."
"I also think that the system as it is
doesn't have enough checks on abuse,"
Hernandez added. "For example,
someone could easily put their
major as whatever they want, and
this would prevent people who re
ally are majoring in the subject
from taking [the class]."
Faculty members echo student
concerns. According to Hinds, since
all interested students are able to
enroll on Axess, they get their
hopes up; they all assume that they
will be admitted into the class
when, oftentimes, more than half of
the students will not.
From a faculty perspective, it is
also difficult to gauge the extent to
which students are actually serious
about the class.
"I've had students say that they
really need to take my class, but
then drop it a few days later," Hinds
said.
As a result, she has "become a
little less sympathetic" about the
enrollment process.
Princen and Hernandez offer a
tentative solution. They would far
prefer an application process like
the one currently in place for intro
ductory seminars, where students
fill out an online application sever
al weeks before the first day of the
quarter.
"I think it's the responsibility of
the professor to take account for
over-enrolled classes by conducting

applications prior to the first day of
the quarter," Princen said. "These
applications force students to re
flect on the reasons why they want
to take the class and take control
over their own education, rather
than just going through the motions
as a factory-model student."
While Hinds concurs that an on
line application introsem-style
would be ideal, it might not be en
tirely practical in the Stanford envi
ronment. Some students do not en
roll on Axess prior to the start of
the quarter. Other students may en
roll on Axess but do not show up on
the first day of class. The question
then becomes: to whom should pro
fessors send the online application?
While it remains unclear how
the application process can be
changed to make it more amenable
to faculty and students alike, there
is one thing that is an easy fix. A few
classes, such as MS&E 175 and 178,
do not even warn students in their
course descriptions that enrollment
is capped. As Cottle points out, this
type of concern could be resolved
through a bit of clarification on the
University's part.
"We could probably make it
more clear on Axess that enroll
ment is limited in certain classes,"
Cottle said.
University registrar Thomas
Black did not respond to a request
for comment.
