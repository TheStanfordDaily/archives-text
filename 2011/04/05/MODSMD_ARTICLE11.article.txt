## FACES unites Chinese, U.S. student delegates 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Delegates from China and the
U.S. will meet next week to attend a
five-day conference sponsored by
Forum for American/Chinese Ex
change at Stanford (FACES) to dis
cuss issues in U.S. and China rela
tions. Many events during the week,
which runs from Apr. 8 through
Apr. 15, feature experts on U.S.-
China relations from across the
country, from fellows of the Free
man Spogli Institute to Silicon Val
ley entrepreneurs.
Twenty Chinese delegates are
chosen from FACES chapters in
Peking, Fudan, Remin and Zhe
jiang University, while another
twenty come from all over the Unit
ed States, according to FACES pres
ident Daniel BraswelT 11. These ap
plicants were chosen from about
500 applicants in fields ranging
from engineering to international
relations. Although not all of the
students have extensive knowledge
in U.S.-China relations, Braswell
said that the conference is intended
to expose more future leaders to
this topic.
"We're looking for people
whose interests are more tangen
tial, and they'll take from this a
greater appreciation of this rela
tionship to whatever it is they
choose to do," Braswell said. "We
look for a passion in issues we
have people who are engineers, Ful
bright scholars, Marshall scholars,
and so we look for peo-

pie who have a dedica
tion to their passion
and who we think
will be leaders in
their field."
During the con
ference, delegates
will participate in
seminars, panels, so-

cial events and diplomacy simula
tions, according to Autumn Carter
'll, vice president of programming.
This year's events will focus on en
trepreneurship between the U.S.
and China, international security is
sues over U.S. and Chinese strategic
interests in Iran, food security and
models of democracy in the Chi
nese world and featured speakers
include Iranian studies professor
Abbas Milani and Silicon Valley en
trepreneur Jack Jia.
This upcoming conference will
be the first of two in October, the
same group of 40 delegates will re
convene at one of FACES's Chi
nese chapters for another round of
discussion and debate. Carter said.
FACES was founded in 2001
after an incident in which a U.S. sur
veillance plane crashed into a Chi
nese plane and the U.S. crew was de
tained on China's Hainan island,
heightening tensions between the
two countries. Following talk of a
possible outbreak of war, several
Stanford students founded the
group in an effort to establish better
ties between the two countries.
"These two countries will have
the most important relationship in
the coming years, so we'd like that
relationship to be based on commu
nication and dialogue, rather than
suspicion and mistrust," Carter said.
"If we can get dialogue going at this
level, then that relationship down
the road is going to look a lot more
positive than it has in the past."
While the topic of democracy in
China is particularly sen
sitive several Chi
nese pro-democracy
activists have been
censored and arrest
ed Carter and
Braswell feel that
such the conference
can still cover these
themes, at least for
their conference on

"There's a question of whether
the Chinese delegates would be
comfortable, but in our experience,
we've discussed these issues before
and we've found that Chinese dele
gates are more than willing to ex
press their opinions on how they
feel about this issue," Braswell said.
"The reason why this organiza
tion exists is for us to engage in crit
ical, thoughtful, engaging dialogue,
dialogue that is going to push peo
ple's assumption from both coun
tries," Carter added.
