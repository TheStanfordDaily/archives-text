## Strike that pose Charily Fashion Show 2011 ventures into San Francisco 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI STAFF WRITER 
The lights dim and the sea
of gaily and outlandishly
clad audience members
seated in the rows on ei
ther side of a sprawling
runway looks expectantly toward the
giant screen.
They are not disappointed: a mo
ment later, a tall, willowy model in a tie
dye, batik, robe-like dress struts out
from behind the scenes. She does not
break pace as she emerges from the
backstage haven, but steps forward
briskly with confidence, only pausing
to pose for the conglomerate of pho
tographers clustered at the end of the
runway before she glides back up the
aisle.
She disappears backstage again,
where a gaggle of makeup artists and
hairstylists speedily adapt her "Disco
Glamour" look into "Ladylike 50s" or
perhaps "Traveling Nomad."
"We work to create a cohesive
story with our makeup," said Meg
Wehe, a makeup artist from the Blush
School of Makeup, the organization
responsible for coloring and painting
the faces of the models present. The
artists move quickly to circulate
through all the models and present
them on time, and backstage is a hec
tic scramble of people.
Charity Fashion Show (CFS) has
not always been such a mega event.
Just three years ago, CFS took place in

the Oak Room atTresidder with only
a small group of Stanford-affiliated
models and designers.
Current Producer and Director of
Public Relations Thorn Scher 'll re
calls the original CFS, in 2007, as a
completely different performance.
"I came up here, and I met Wayne
Hwang," Scher recalled. "He was pro
ducing this really small event called
the Charity Fashion Show, which had
been around since the 90s but in a
completely different form."
"I met Wayne through a mutual
friend, and we really hit it off. And it
became really clear that if I was man
aging all of the business and he was
managing all of the creative side, we
could make Charity Fashion Show
huge," he added.
The charity component of the
show was one of the founding princi
ples, implemented by the Asian
American Student Association
(AASA) at Stanford, and carried
through to make CFS what it is today.
"Charity Fashion Show evolved
from AASA's Sweat-Free Labor
Show, so the idea of benefitting the
community came somewhat natural
ly," CFS Director of Development
Stephanie Werner 'll wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"Especially because we don't rep
resent a particular design house, we
feel that it is of the utmost importance
to have a social cause, to use our brand
recognition to benefit those who per
haps couldn't afford a ticket to CFS,"
Werner said.

FromTresidder, the show migrated
to a tent in Roble Field, which was a
step of grand proportions.
"It was actually a huge improve
ment," said Ariana Afshan 'll, who
has modeled for CFS since her fresh
man year. "I was so excited, so
shocked. And then now, San Francis
co."
Charity Fashion Show 2010 made
it apparent that a different venue
would be necessary if the show was to
follow the trajectory it had set for it
self Last year, CFS faced serious eco
nomic problems, simply because the
scope of the show had exceeded that
of most other student groups on the
Stanford campus.
"These troubles were largely tied to
fundraising policies enforced by the
University that are set forth for good
reason," Scher said.
These policies, outlined in the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs (VPSA)
regulations on student group funding,
made it difficult for CFS to capitalize
on sponsorships. CFS therefore faced a
tough decision this year: either main
tain its Stanford connections and
downsize considerably or officially dis
connect from the University. They
chose the latter.
"As that's changed, I think we've
brought on some way larger names,"
Scher said. "We've got Verizon Wireless
presenting as a sponsor and key spon
sors of Pigment Cosmetics, Umbrella
Salon and Vitamin Water Zero."
This year's charity was the Princess
Project, an organization that donates
prom dresses to underprivileged girls.

The Princess Project also emphasizes
diversity of all types, a vital compo
nent of Charity Fashion Show au
dience members could not help but
notice the aesthetic variety of models.
"Charity Fashion Show puts mod
els of all different colors, shapes and
sizes on our runway, because we value
ethnic diversity and a positive body
image," Werner said. "By showing
girls in attendance that you don't have
to fit in a mold to be beautiful, we aim
to increase their self-confidence and
self-worth, counteracting negative in
dustry stereotypes."
Diversity not only includes differ
ent body types and ethnicities, but also
experience levels and ages. Models
ranged from a Hillsdale High School
student, Cora Kammeyer, who had
never modeled before, to Jessica
Havlak 'lO, who had previously par
ticipated in Charity Fashion Show, to
Ty Olsen'l4, a model signed with an
agency in San Francisco.
They all shared the same nervous
energy before going on the runway,
and they all went through the process

of learning how to "walk" and devel
op their own style.
"You're allowed to have your own
unique style, as long as it's not really
strange," Afshar said.
And unique walking styles there
were, as models jauntily shimmied to
Katy Perry, sauntered languidly and
marched stiffly down the runway.
Their expressions varied as well, with
smoky glares from some, subtle pouts
from others and traces of smiles play
ing on the lips of a few. The works of 40
designers were displayed in sets or
"pockets," each themed after a cer
tain decade as the show traveled
through time from the 50s to the mod
ern day.
"I think that our move to San Fran
cisco means that we have been able to
capitalize on a really huge community
the arts community in San Francis
co is amazing," Scher said, smiling.
"That's something that I personally
cherish, and I love working there."
