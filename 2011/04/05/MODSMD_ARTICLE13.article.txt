concluded his winter quarter sophomore Introduc
tory Seminar, "Injustice, Advocacy and Courage:
The Path of Everyday Heroes."
Students in the class grappled with the idea of
courage throughout the course of the quarter, consid
ering figures from Obama to a man who killed a doc
tor who performed abortions to protest the practice.
"The idea was to consider courage and how peo
ple do things that are courageous," Abrams said. "It
goes beyond bravery ... It's the notion of a person
taking a stand, extending themselves, putting them
selves at risk and doing that because of a belief that
something is right."
Studying real-life situations was critical to this ex
ploration of courage. Professor Abrams saw value in
having students personally connect with the people
involved in the topics they were studying.
A few weeks into the quarter, an opportunity
arose for students to do exactly that when protests
broke out in Egypt on Jan. 25. Young Egyptians
called for the fall of then-President Hosni
Mubarak's regime, practicing nonviolent resist-

ance, sometimes at great personal costs.
Abrams assigned a presentation in which all
the students in the seminar would work to
gether to explore how Egyptians demon
strated courage.
"You don't have to study this in a histo- V
ry book," Abrams said. "You don't have to \
read about it in a newspaper; you can get in
direct contact with the people involved."
The IntroSem students interviewed Egyptian
students at Stanford and conducted a live Skype in
terview with an Egyptian protestor who claimed he
was pelted with tear gas in the initial days of the up
rising.
"What we had in mind was to build a better Egypt
... to stand up for our rights," he said when asked
what motivated his group to risk protesting.
Though some demonstrations of courage, such as
braving physical attack, are easy to identify, the pre
senters delved into more complex questions, asking
if the use of social media, for example, was coura
geous.
"A lot of times, maybe from the media, you get
only one side of courage, and it's kind of one-dimen
sional," said Karl Kumodzi 'l4. "This class reexam

ined courage from a lot of different viewpoints."
Others' questions included the role of the am
biguous concept of "courage," courage as a catalyst
and the idea of a broken "fear barrier."
"Our aim was not to answer these questions so
much as to raise them," said Tyrone McGraw 'll.
The point of the project, however, was not simply
intellectual hypothesizing. The students were able to
construct for themselves a tangible example of
courage.
"The students looked at what their counterparts,
kids the same age, were doing in Egypt and ... why
was that courageous? Would they do things similar
here? Would they speak out? Would they put them
selves at risk?" Abrams said.
The students were responsive to this goal, finding
inspiration in the acts of the protestors they studied.
Many students were struck by the variety of forms
courage could take.
Although this is the first year this seminar has
been taught, some of Abrams' past students have
started projects such as FACE AIDS and the Glob
al Health Corps, as well as a cell phone network in
Africa that enabled physicians in rural areas to com
municate with hospitals.
"I want students to dare to do things ... whether
it's challenge a corrupt dictator or challenge an un
just policy or improve the health care system, we
want people to be daring, and that's what I mean by
raising hell," he said.
