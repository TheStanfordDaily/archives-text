## EDITORIAL Editorial Board endorses Tenzin-Vasquez for ASSU Executive 
### 
Displaying poise, passion and
a platform as inspiring as
the diverse backgrounds
from which they hail, Tenzin Sel
don 'l2 and Joe Vasquez 'll have
earned The Stanford Daily Editor
ial Board's endorsement for ASSU
Executive. They represent a wide
swath of campus and blend insider
experience with newcomer enthu
siasm; they are also well attuned to
the unique levers at the command
of the Executive position and
demonstrated their resolve to bro
ker compromise between students,
faculty and administrators.
The Board drew three conclu
sions from the interview process.
First, Tenzin-Vasquez hold the
greatest promise to broaden the
appeal of the ASSU and advocate
effectively for students at all levels
of University governance. Second,
despite ASSU Vice President and
Presidential candidate Michael
Cruz's extensive ASSU experi
ence, his underwhelming responses
to basic inquiries from this Board
raised serious doubts about his
ability to fully leverage the influ
ence of the Executive. Third, and
most importantly, both Tenzin-
Vasquez and Cruz & Macgregor-
Dennis would benefit from adopt
ing the strengths of the other slate,
a testament to the caliber of all can
didates and to the educational po
tential of election season.
Tenzin-Vasquez shone when
discussing their central platform
points of diversity, transparency,
wellness and mental health. While
we cautioned voters yesterday to
push candidates to provide well
conceived implementation plans
for popular platitudes, Tenzin-
Vasquez proactively offered de
tails. They intend to broaden class
selection offerings on mental
health, pursue concerted aware
ness campaigns for the Acts of In
tolerance Protocol and physically
interface with their constituency
house by house, door by door, to
engage a general audience on tradi
tionally niche issues.
This last point resonated partic
ularly with the Board, which found
compelling the assertion that a
Town Hall on an issue like ROTC
reinstatement only mobilizes stu
dents already invested in the issue.
The dedication implicit in Tenzin-
Vasquez's promise to educate and
galvanize uninvolved students to
participate in the campus dialogue
was backed by their strong record
of community involvement both

through and independently of the
ASSU. Vasquez, a versatile student
group leader, demonstrated his
ability to merge disparate commu
nities just earlier that day by spear
heading the Kappa Sigma Field of
Dreams event for disabled chil
dren. Seldon, the ASSU Diversity
Chair, has proven her ability to
sample a wide assortment of stu
dent views on diversity and intoler
ance and translate that data into
tangible progress through collabo
ration with the Administration.
The Board felt that Tenzin-
Vasquez truly appreciated the
unique role that the Executive
plays as the preferred representa
tive of the student body to the Ad
ministration. The candidates re
peatedly cited constructive rela
tionships and compromise with ad
ministrators as the most powerful
aspects of the ASSU executive arse
nal, allowing the Exec to transcend
the limited scope of influence that
ASSU Senators and other students
have on student life and academic
policy. While Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3 recited a laundry list of
six potential levers that the Exec
had at its disposal, none invoked the
powerful stature that successful
Execs have parlayed into advocacy
on University finances, academic
policy and student life.
The Board was gravely disap
pointed by the interview perform
ance of Michael Cruz 'l2, who ap
peared to defer to Macgregor-
Dennis on most issues, did not cor
rectly match his statements to the
platform points listed on the slate's
website, and gave indirect answers
to straightforward questions. His
personal growth in the ASSU
while admirable â€”is not an ap
propriate response to an inquiry
about the policy levers at the
Exec's disposal under all but the
most strained interpretation of the
question. When the next clash be
tween the best interests of students
and administrators arises, and the
time comes for the ASSU Presi
dent to confront the University bu
reaucracy as has been the case
every year in recent memory
this Board is not confident that
Cruz would acquit himself and his
constituents well. Similarly, his
bland promises to extend the
ASSU's reach ring hollow consid
ering students' persistent disinter
est in the ASSU over his three
years of service.

Macgregor-Dennis dominated
the interview, giving several well
thought out and technically im
pressive initiatives. However, he
could not answer why fundamen
tally the Executive position was
the right position for him to trot
out his iPhone apps and web ana
lytic data analysis. As ASSU Tech
nology Chair, Macgregor-Dennis
would have similar latitude to in
novate and build the ASSU's tech
presence; this Board urges him to
consider that alternative, noting
that his recommendations are
strong. On balance, however, Mac
gregor-Dennis alone cannot run
the Executive office.
The position of Exec should be
filled by visionary individuals who
represent the full range of Stan
ford's talent and will broaden the
appeal of the ASSU to the alarm
ingly large apathetic segment of
students and advocate on behalf of

students with passion. Tenzin and
Vasquez, a Tibetan refugee and a
first-generation, low-income serv
ice advocate, meet all of these re
quirements. They exude natural
leadership and represent distinct
communities. Their platform
would benefit from the detail of
the prolific Cruz & Macgregor-
Dennis platform, but we are fully
confident that Tenzin-Vasquez will
choose an experienced cabinet.
This Board urges you to vote for
Tenzin-Vasquez to guarantee
strong ASSU leadership.
