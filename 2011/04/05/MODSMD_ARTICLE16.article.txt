# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## Me, Myself and Stanford 
### Rachel Kolb 
April is here, and with it, one
season has ended and an
other has begun. No, I'm not
talking about spring. On its way out
is admission season, along with its
pell-mell uncertainty for those who
once visualized the word "Stan
ford" as part of their futures. On its
way in is the triumphal procession,
or the newly admitted members of
the class of 2015, many of whom will
visit campus in a few weeks for
Admit Weekend. The analogy, how
ever, goes a bit further: depending
on specific admission outcomes for
these current high school seniors,
this time is either the closing of one
door or the opening of another.
As someone with a sibling who
applied to Stanford this year, I find
the end of this admissions cycle more
thought-provoking than it has been
since I emerged from it three years
ago. I find myself once again ques
tioning, this time on a more philo
sophical than personal level, exactly
what entitles our inclusion into a
school like Stanford in the first place.

Moreover, I find myself questioning
the relationship that our admission
has to our future success. If we
achieve milestones in our future
lives, is it because we are the types of
people who would have succeeded
anyway? Or is it because the good
fortune we had of getting into Stan
ford opened up those horizons for
us? Most troublesomely, does the
fact that I find myself dwelling on
such questions reflect the depth of
my Stanford-indoctrinated elitism?
I suspect that many of us, once
we've gotten into Stanford, stop
questioning the factors that went
into our admission. And with good
reason. Once we've gotten into Stan
ford, it is time to stop speculating
about which factors could have influ
enced that outcome, about why we
made it and other people didn't.
Even University administrators em
phasize this outlook during the be
ginning weeks of freshman year. I re
member being told, in those first
gatherings full of shouting and
school spirit, to dismiss whatever

doubts I encountered about whether
I belonged at Stanford. You got in,
that says it all was the message I got.
Now move on and take advantage of

Once we've gotten into
Stanford, it is time to
stop speculating about
whywemadeitand
other people didn't.
