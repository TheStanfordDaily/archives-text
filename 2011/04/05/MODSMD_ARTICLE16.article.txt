# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## Me, Myself and Stanford 
### Rachel Kolb 
April is here, and with it, one
season has ended and an
other has begun. No, I'm not
talking about spring. On its way out
is admission season, along with its
pell-mell uncertainty for those who
once visualized the word "Stan
ford" as part of their futures. On its
way in is the triumphal procession,
or the newly admitted members of
the class of 2015, many of whom will
visit campus in a few weeks for
Admit Weekend. The analogy, how
ever, goes a bit further: depending
on specific admission outcomes for
these current high school seniors,
this time is either the closing of one
door or the opening of another.
As someone with a sibling who
applied to Stanford this year, I find
the end of this admissions cycle more
thought-provoking than it has been
since I emerged from it three years
ago. I find myself once again ques
tioning, this time on a more philo
sophical than personal level, exactly
what entitles our inclusion into a
school like Stanford in the first place.

Moreover, I find myself questioning
the relationship that our admission
has to our future success. If we
achieve milestones in our future
lives, is it because we are the types of
people who would have succeeded
anyway? Or is it because the good
fortune we had of getting into Stan
ford opened up those horizons for
us? Most troublesomely, does the
fact that I find myself dwelling on
such questions reflect the depth of
my Stanford-indoctrinated elitism?
I suspect that many of us, once
we've gotten into Stanford, stop
questioning the factors that went
into our admission. And with good
reason. Once we've gotten into Stan
ford, it is time to stop speculating
about which factors could have influ
enced that outcome, about why we
made it and other people didn't.
Even University administrators em
phasize this outlook during the be
ginning weeks of freshman year. I re
member being told, in those first
gatherings full of shouting and
school spirit, to dismiss whatever

doubts I encountered about whether
I belonged at Stanford. You got in,
that says it all was the message I got.
Now move on and take advantage of

the experience.
In many ways, this advice is wise.
Life moves on, and whether or not
Stanford is part of the equation, we
need to make the most of the oppor
tunities we do have. Regardless of
whether we are the lucky ones or
not. With an admission rate now
hovering at around 7 percent,
though, how could we not be a little
bit lucky? Believing otherwise, be
lieving that there wasn't some unex
plained factor that made each of us
stand out on our applications, would
just be conceited. We already live in
an academic environment that seeks
to assure us that we are exceptional,
sometimes to troublesome levels,
but we cannot lose sight of the fact
that we are not the only ones who
could succeed in a University like
this. So what has brought us, and not
others, here?
Before I go any further, let me
backtrack and clarify: I do not mean

that any one of us survived the ad
mission process based on luck alone.
That certainly isn't true, for the more
I interact with other Stanford stu
dents, the more I marvel at the
uniqueness, passion and promise
that each of them has. This sense of
appreciation seems to increase in
proportion with my own maturity,
suggesting that perhaps I am grow
ing into Stanford more than Stan
ford is growing into me. The qualities
I brought to the table three years
ago, combined with Stanford's aca
demic and extracurricular opportu
nities, have led me not only to this
maturity but also to a heightened re
alization of how fortunate I am.
The question over which I'm
pondering seems to be a variant of
the old nature-versus-nurture,
chicken-versus-egg debate. In life
beyond Stanford, which makes the
most difference internal qualities
or environmental factors? As al
ways, there's no way to place one ir
revocably over the other. It's proba
bly a little bit of both, and this real
ization should be both empowering
and humbling. Empowering be
cause we recognize that we march

forth into the world equipped with
the inner qualities to overcome ob
stacles more daunting than an
IHUM paper. Humbling because we
should never lose sight of the fact
that our circumstances have allowed
us to become the person who can do
exactly that.
Education is a peculiar combina
tion of these internal and external
factors, and 1 don't think we should
lose sight of either. The old adage
says that "education is one thing
they can't take away from you," but
it is a gift rather than a birthright. In
the future, our Stanford educations
may pull us through some rough
spots, but why should we and not
other, equally qualified students be
the ones to receive that education in
the first place? Luck, opportunity,
blessings, good fortune? I don't
know, but it's something outside of
our control and the sense of per
spective that comes with that real
ization is something no amount of
elitism can penetrate.

egg? Send Rachel your thoughts at

April is here, and with it, one
season has ended and an
other has begun. No, I'm not
talking about spring. On its way out
is admission season, along with its
pell-mell uncertainty for those who
once visualized the word "Stan
ford" as part of their futures. On its
way in is the triumphal procession,
or the newly admitted members of
the class of 2015, many of whom will
visit campus in a few weeks for
Admit Weekend. The analogy, how
ever, goes a bit further: depending
on specific admission outcomes for
these current high school seniors,
this time is either the closing of one
door or the opening of another.
As someone with a sibling who
applied to Stanford this year, I find
the end of this admissions cycle more
thought-provoking than it has been
since I emerged from it three years
ago. I find myself once again ques
tioning, this time on a more philo
sophical than personal level, exactly
what entitles our inclusion into a
school like Stanford in the first place.

Moreover, I find myself questioning
the relationship that our admission
has to our future success. If we
achieve milestones in our future
lives, is it because we are the types of
people who would have succeeded
anyway? Or is it because the good
fortune we had of getting into Stan
ford opened up those horizons for
us? Most troublesomely, does the
fact that I find myself dwelling on
such questions reflect the depth of
my Stanford-indoctrinated elitism?
I suspect that many of us, once
we've gotten into Stanford, stop
questioning the factors that went
into our admission. And with good
reason. Once we've gotten into Stan
ford, it is time to stop speculating
about which factors could have influ
enced that outcome, about why we
made it and other people didn't.
Even University administrators em
phasize this outlook during the be
ginning weeks of freshman year. I re

the experience.
In many ways, this advice is wise.
Life moves on, and whether or not
Stanford is part of the equation, we
need to make the most of the oppor
tunities we do have. Regardless of
whether we are the lucky ones or
not. With an admission rate now
hovering at around 7 percent,
though, how could we not be a little
bit lucky? Believing otherwise, be
lieving that there wasn't some unex
plained factor that made each of us
stand out on our applications, would
just be conceited. We already live in
an academic environment that seeks
to assure us that we are exceptional,
sometimes to troublesome levels,
but we cannot lose sight of the fact
that we are not the only ones who
could succeed in a University like
this. So what has brought us, and not
others, here?
Before I go any further, let me
backtrack and clarify: I do not mean

that any one of us survived the ad
mission process based on luck alone.
That certainly isn't true, for the more
I interact with other Stanford stu
dents, the more I marvel at the
uniqueness, passion and promise
that each of them has. This sense of
appreciation seems to increase in
proportion with my own maturity,
suggesting that perhaps I am grow
ing into Stanford more than Stan
ford is growing into me. The qualities
I brought to the table three years
ago, combined with Stanford's aca
demic and extracurricular opportu
nities, have led me not only to this
maturity but also to a heightened re
alization of how fortunate I am.
The question over which I'm
pondering seems to be a variant of
the old nature-versus-nurture,
chicken-versus-egg debate. In life
beyond Stanford, which makes the
most difference internal qualities
or environmental factors? As al
ways, there's no way to place one ir
revocably over the other. It's proba
bly a little bit of both, and this real
ization should be both empowering
and humbling. Empowering be

forth into the world equipped with
the inner qualities to overcome ob
