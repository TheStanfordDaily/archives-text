## To Build Coalition: The Cause of SOCC 
### 
How many times have you
heard these words uttered
on campus: "I feel like we're
disjointed!" or "There's just not
enough unity on campus?" Despite
all the efforts of student groups and
their leaders, there remains an un
derlying feeling that we are not the
united Stanford that we want to be.
It is daunting to hear how often this
sentiment is expressed.
There is something each and
every one of us can do, though.
Blessed with the opportunity to at
tend a university rich with diversity,
we should make our Stanford expe
rience whole by learning from the
lives of our fellow students. To not
do so is to squander the rare oppor
tunity to revel in true diversity. The
Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) sees this challenge and or
ganizes around it.
Comprised of the Asian Ameri
can Students' Association (AASA),

the Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim
Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) and the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO), the leaders of our groups
know what it means to learn from
and through diversity. To us, the
strength and sovereignty of our
communities is essential, as diversi
ty is impossible to have if every par
ticipant forfeits his or her own ideas.
But we not only maintain our indi
vidual identities, promoting under
standing and unity from within each
of our communities we also
work together to combat injustices
and advocate for social change.
SOCC realizes the strength and
value of unity. Originally founded
as the Rainbow Coalition in 1987,
during a time when cultural and
ethnic diversity seemed a low prior
ity, SOCC has worked to protect
and promote the values of students
of color on campus. Since then, we
have naturally expanded our mis
sion to advocate for campus diver
sity of every nature diversity of
thought, socioeconomic back
ground, sexual orientation, political
ideology, geographic origins and re
ligious beliefs. SOCC represents
the continuation of a long tradition
of student leaders and their com
munities fighting for systematic
changes that allow all student
groups to provide the program
ming and support they need to con
tinually strengthen our vibrant
communities.
In the larger scheme of things,
ASSU elections seem like an ob
scure way to effect such a change,
but year after year, we engage with
the ASSU, the elections and its
leaders because these are the most
direct ways of strengthening Stan
ford's diversity and protecting the
interests of student organizations
across campus. Who better than our
elected leaders to forge a voice for
all voices, give a face to all peoples
and make a space for everyone at
the table? SOCC understands the
value in bringing people together
not to exclude, but to edify all asso
ciated students of our dear alma
mater.
There is strength in peoples
united. There is value in student

leaders thinking critically about
how to truly engage the incredibly
diverse life experiences and sources
of wisdom that exist within us all.
This is why we build coalitions. This
is why we invite you to join in our
coalition. This year, SOCC endors
es 15 Senate candidates and one ex
ecutive slate who we believe
demonstrate the greatest commit
ment, knowledge and passion
about student body issues and will
fully represent the richness of Stan
ford.
This election cycle, let us do
away with sayings like "our campus
is fragmented." As you look to
wards the upcoming April 7 and 8
elections, please recall SOCC's
commitment to service, leadership,
student advocacy and community.
A vote for SOCC is a vote for you.
