## To Build Coalition: The Cause of SOCC 
### 
How many times have you
heard these words uttered
on campus: "I feel like we're
disjointed!" or "There's just not
enough unity on campus?" Despite
all the efforts of student groups and
their leaders, there remains an un
derlying feeling that we are not the
united Stanford that we want to be.
It is daunting to hear how often this
sentiment is expressed.
There is something each and
every one of us can do, though.
Blessed with the opportunity to at
tend a university rich with diversity,
we should make our Stanford expe
rience whole by learning from the
lives of our fellow students. To not
do so is to squander the rare oppor
tunity to revel in true diversity. The
Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) sees this challenge and or
ganizes around it.
Comprised of the Asian Ameri
can Students' Association (AASA),

the Black Student Union (BSU),
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim
Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) and the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO), the leaders of our groups
know what it means to learn from
and through diversity. To us, the
strength and sovereignty of our
communities is essential, as diversi
ty is impossible to have if every par
ticipant forfeits his or her own ideas.
But we not only maintain our indi
vidual identities, promoting under
standing and unity from within each
of our communities we also
work together to combat injustices
and advocate for social change.
SOCC realizes the strength and
value of unity. Originally founded
