## Chicken McNuggets 
### Tim Moon 
Some of you have probably seen
that photo of a thick, python
like, Pepto Bismol-tinted coil
of mechanically separated meat
being scraped off into a cardboard
box. It's some freaky stuff, and
when I first saw it, attached to the
title "Pre-Chicken Nugget Meat
Paste, a.k.a. Mechanically Separat
ed Poultry," any cravings I had for
Chicken McNuggets disappeared.
Understandably.
This was distressing, because I
like Chicken McNuggets. Chicken
McNuggets remind me of being a
kid, of stopping at McDonald's on
road trips with my family, of only
ever getting sweet and sour sauce to
dip the McNuggets in, because
that's what my parents always got.
They're also just plain good, from
time to time. Don't get me wrong;
I'm all for eating fresh, seasonal,
local and all that other good stuff,
but the couple of times a year I get a
craving for a Chicken McNugget,

there's no substitute for the real
thing. That crispy coating that's not
like any other breading in the
world, the smooth and juicy white
meat inside (although I think we
can all agree that they used to be
better when they had dark meat),
following each bite with one or two
of those bangin' fries ...
Thinking that I'd ruined Chicken
McNuggets for myself forever by
seeing that box of pink meat slurry,
I instantly regretted caving to my
curiosity and clicking on the link.
Luckily, I stayed calm enough to do
a little sleuthing and found that
Chicken McNuggets don't actually

contain any mechanically separated
chicken anymore. Crisis averted.
I was reminded by this almost
disastrous episode when I went out
to dinner with a friend last quarter.
I was trying to convince her that we
don't want to know everything
about our friends, but after wrap
ping up one last point, my friend just
sort of "mm-hmm"ed and went
back to her duck.
My friend may have been more
interested in her duck (it was pretty
tasty) than in my amateur social
theorizing, but that duck itself
demonstrates why we really don't
want to know everything about
everything in our lives. My friend
probably didn't want to know
where her duck had come from or
how it had gotten to her plate for
the same reasons that I was almost
put off Chicken McNuggets by that
awful picture. And for those same

reasons, we probably don't want to
know about all the skeletons in our
friends' closets, about how many
people our significant other has
been with, about what people have
said about us.
I have another friend, "Britta,"
who's pretty much a walking, talking
mechanically separated meat photo
every time we catch up and I
mention someone that we both hap
pen to know, Britta drops some
bomb about that person that jolts
my image of them. Thankfully, it's
never quite as dramatic as the
Chicken McNugget episode, but it's
still remarkable how her image-jolt
ing bomb dropping is like clock
work. Heck, just last week, even
though I've stopped bringing people
up in our conversations out of fear of
her "talent," Britta somehow me
chanically separated meat photo-ed
someone who I didn't even bring up.
Unstoppable, that one.
We may not want to know every
thing about everyone in our lives or
about everything that we eat, but
things seem to be changing. Food
wise, there's an increasing push to
know the provenance of our food,
whether animals have been hu
manely treated, whether fair labor
practices are being used, and
there's even the new trend of being
an "ethical" carnivore by con
fronting where one's meat comes
from. And in our interpersonal re
lations, we're sharing more and

more online, telling people who
we re dating and letting everyone
know when we break up, telling
everyone where we are now, post
ing pictures of what we've done.
This is good, right? If you learn
something awful about
someone/about Chicken Mc-
Nuggets and you still love them just
the same, that means the relation
ship's stronger, no? I suppose the
idea's good, but... I don't know. I
still think there's something to be
said for pulling back and not dig
ging too deep all the time. Some
times, you just have to enjoy people
or things for how they are to you,
not for what they've been or where
they've come from.
Especially Chicken McNuggets.
You really don't want to think too
hard about those.

Tim feels good to have gotten his
Chicken McNuggets guilty pleasure
off his chest. Tell him one of yours at
