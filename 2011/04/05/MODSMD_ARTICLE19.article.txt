## SPORTS BRIEFS Flynn sets record in lacrosse rout 
### â€“ Nate Adams 
Stanford lacrosse tightened its grasp of
the conference lead last Sunday, cruising
past Saint Mary's in a 20-7 road win. Se
nior attacker Sarah Flynn matched the en
tire Gaels squad with a school-record
seven goals in the victory, which continued
an undefeated season for Stanford (11-1,
3-0 MPSF) in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation.
Flynn and the Cardinal jumped on
Saint Mary's (2-8, 1-3) right out of the
gate, going up 6-1 barely 10 minutes into
the game. Just eight minutes in, Flynn al
ready had a hat trick. Stanford outshot the
Gaels in the half, 28-10, and went into the
break with a comfortable 12-4 lead.
Senior goalkeeper Annie Read
stepped out for freshman Lyndsey Munoz
after making three saves in the half. Read
got the win for her contributions, her 11th
of the season.
Flynn's historic second goal was no doubt
the highlight of the second half, but that ac
complishment overshadowed another,
smaller one in the game's final minutes:
freshman attacker Annie Anton, earning
extra playing time with the sizeable Stanford
lead, knocked in her first collegiate goal.
The Cardinal tallied 46 shots on the
game and won 19 of 27 draw controls. Five
of those came from senior midfielder
Leslie Foard.
Stanford will return home this week
end to face conference rival Denver on
Friday at 6 p.m. The Pioneers beat the Car
dinal last year to cost Stanford the MPSF
regular season title, but fell to Stanford in
the MPSF tournament.
