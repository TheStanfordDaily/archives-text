## Digital town hall connects Egypt to scholars 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The Center on Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law (CDDRL), in partner
ship with the Cloud to Street Initiative, held a
digital town hall from Cairo on Monday morn
ing. CDDRL visiting scholar Ben Rowswell
discussed the recent Egyptian uprising with
three Egyptian activists at Tahrir Lounge in
Cairo, while members of the Stanford commu
nity watched through a live stream and partic
ipated in a chat and polls.
The Egyptian activists, Sabah Hamamou,
Mona Shahien and Abdel Rahman Faris, were
leaders in the youth-led movement that start
ed Jan. 25 in Tahrir Square, Cairo. The move
ment resulted in the resignation of 30-year
President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11. They
have since been involved in rebuilding Egypt's
political system in anticipation of parliamen
tary and presidential elections later this year.
The discussion aimed to connect the ac
tivists with researchers at Stanford, Harvard
and the University of British Columbia. Ac
cording to Sarina Beges, CDDRL program
manager, the discussion had 35 online partici
pants, including academics and CDDRL
members.
Participants posted questions through a
live chat, which Rowswell then posed to the ac
tivists. Topics included the impact of technolo
gy, citizen journalism, the future of Egyptian
politics, women's roles and the ways in which
outsiders can contribute.
"We largely refuse any support from any
[foreign] government whatsoever, because
governments have their own calculations,"
said Faris, a member of the Revolutionary
Youth Council that planned the initial
protests. "But we count on popular support."
Shahien held a similar opinion.
"I think there can be an exchange of infor
mation between us and people abroad," she
said.
"[But] say to your governments: 'hands off
the Arab world,'" Shahien said.
Hamamou, Shahien and Faris emphasized
their desire for a secular, democratic Egypt.
"Most of the people who are working in the
political sphere don't want a religious country:
we want a civil [secular] country," said
Hamamou, a deputy editor at leading state
newspaper Al-Ahram, which extensively re
ported on the protests.
The town hall idea emerged from Blogs
and Bullets, a conference held by the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies at
Stanford (FSI) in February on social media
and the struggle for political change.
