# Softball swept by Arizona
## 
### â€“ Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford Softball team didn't
start Pac-10 play the way it wanted to,
dropping three straight at home to Ari
zona. The No. 7 Wildcats (32-6, 3-0 Pac
-10) completely stifled the Cardinal of
fense, holding Stanford to one run all
weekend while tallying 16 against Cardi
nal pitching.

On Friday night, No. 12 Stanford (24-
7, 0-3) sent sophomore pitcher Teagan
Gerhart to the hill to take on Arizona's
Kenzie Fowler. The Wildcats got to Ger
hart immediately, scoring three runs in
the first inning on a hit batter, a walk and
a passed ball after loading the bases. Ari
zona added a run each in the second and
third innings and three more in the
fourth to make the score 8-0. Mean
while, Stanford mustered just a hit and a
walk with Fowler on the mound before
the game was called due to the run rule
after five innings.

Senior pitcher Ashley Chinn started
the second game of the series for Stan
ford and picked up her first loss of the
season despite a strong outing. Chinn,
who came into the game with a perfect
11-0 record, went the distance and al
lowed only two earned runs to Arizona.
However, the Stanford defense commit
ted two costly errors that led to four un
earned runs for the Wildcats, and the six
runs were more than enough for Ari

zona's starter Shelby Babcock. After al
lowing a run on two singles and two
walks in the first inning, Babcock settled
down to hold Stanford scoreless through
the next 2.2 innings. Fowler then came in
and closed out the 6-1 win for Arizona
with 3.1 shutout frames.
Sunday's series finale saw the best
pitching performance of the weekend
for Stanford, but yet again, Gerhart was
outdueled by Fowler. With the game still
scoreless in the fourth, Arizona manu
factured an unearned run following an
error by sophomore first baseman Alix
Van Zandt. A home run by Wildcat third
baseman Brigette Del Ponte to lead off
the sixth inning was the only other run
Gerhart allowed, but Fowler once again
shut the door on the Cardinal offense.
Stanford could only manage leadoff sin
gles in the fourth and fifth by junior cen
ter fielder Sarah Hassman and freshman
pinch hitter Jamie Millwood, respective
ly, while Fowler fanned 10 Cardinal bat
ters en route to her second shutout of the
weekend and her 20th win of the season.
After the disappointing series, Stan
ford will hit the road for the first time in
conference play with a three-game set in
Los Angeles against No. 13 UCLA (26-5,
3-0), which is coming off a three-game
sweep of Oregon State. The games will
take place Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday at 6
p.m. and Sunday at noon.
