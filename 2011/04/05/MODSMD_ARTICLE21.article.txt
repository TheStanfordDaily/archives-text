# Still no parity in women's basketball
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
For the first time since 1994, the women's
basketball championship game will be
between two non-No. 1 seeds. Tonight's
game features a pair of No. 2 teams that
each had to knock off back-to-back No. 1
squads in order to reach the final. Impressive. Far
more so than the general reaction to the outcome of
the semifinals: namely, that these results prove that
there is (finally!) parity in women's basketball.
No, no they do not.
Flaving seven of the top eight seeds reach the
quarterfinals is not parity. It's the status quo, and it
fits with what we have seen for much of the past
decade: the cream of the crop can knock each other
off, but outside of the top schools, few have much of
a chance. This year's lone exception No. 11 Gon
zaga was a low-seeded team whose run everyone
and their mother saw coming.Three of ESPN's four
women's basketball experts picked the Zags as
their Cinderella choice; Tara VanDerveer pointed
them out in her pre-tournament press conference.
And with good reason: if you have a superstar
(Courtney Vandersloot) surrounded by a crop of
above-average starters, you are generally going to
find success. It's a basic formula that works through
out all levels of basketball and for both men and
women; the distinction is that such a compilation is
harder to come by in the women's game. There is a
more limited pool of talent to choose from, and the

big schools are pretty good at hoarding the best
players. Whereas the men have excellent talent at
the mid-major level Shelvin Mack, Jimmer Fre
dette, Kawhi Leonard, Justin Flarper and so on
their female counterparts are left looking for nee
dles in the haystacks. Simply put, there aren't
enough Vandersloots to go around, and when you
have one, it's not hard to predict accomplishment,
which the Zags had both before and after their run.
Gonzaga's low ranking was a result of being crimi-

nally underrated solely because it
played in a weaker conference. It
wasn't because the team was lacklus
ter until the tournament the Zags
entered March Madness with just
four losses, two of which were to
Final Four teams (Stanford and
Notre Dame).
This, again, is not parity, even
from a historical perspective.
Though it's been nearly 20 years
since two non-No. Is played for the
title, it is routine to have teams
without top billing reach the cham
pionship game. Last year was the
first since 2003 to feature two No. Is
playing in the finals during that
six-season stretch, it was always a
No. 1 against a lower-ranked squad.
We were seven seconds away from
seeing a similar scenario unfold in
2011.
Perhaps it is relative. Connecticut
has had such a stranglehold on the
sport for the past few seasons that
seeing anyone, even a two-seed, in
the championship game instead of
the Huskies is reason enough to re
joice at the leveling of the playing
field. It's not an absurd idea, but it's
also no secret that the Huskies
weren't as strong this year as they
were in their past campaigns after
losing to Stanford in December,
their cloak of invincibility seemingly
vanished. Geno Auriemma's state
ments in light of that defeat said as
much. And besides, even if UConn
was as strong as it was in 2010, a de

feat, particularly in the Final Four,
does not demonstrate a seismic shift.
It shows what we already know
about March Madness: that even in a
sport with clear divisions in talent,
nearly anything can happen in a sin
gle game.
This is not a criticism of the sport
frankly, because there is such a di
vision between the top-tier teams
and everybody else, when two good
but-not-great squads match up, it can
generally be counted on to be pretty
even, which makes for more exciting
games. It's only when those squads
come into contact with the top dogs
that the underdog's chances drop
significantly. Women's basketball is
not at a place where it can replicate
the bedlam seen in the men's tourna
ment. And that's okay: it can get
there. Gary Blair, coach of Texas
A&M, recognized these ideas after
downing Stanford on Sunday.
"Sometimes, you have to go
through growing pains to get to
where we want to be, parity, where
people would be excited where a
Butler and a VCU are playing for the
national championship on the men's
side. We need that on the women's
side as well," he said.
It's no secret that women's basket
ball is growing as a youth sport, and
that talent pools are increasing as a re
sult. Noting and continuing that
progress is a worthwhile endeavor,
one far better than preemptively de
claring the arrival of parity to the
game when that's simply not the case.

Wyndam Makowsky thinks parity is
great, but he'd still rather have a cer
tain No. 1 team in the final. Commis

For the first time since 1994, the women's
basketball championship game will be
between two non-No. 1 seeds. Tonight's
game features a pair of No. 2 teams that
each had to knock off back-to-back No. 1
squads in order to reach the final. Impressive. Far
more so than the general reaction to the outcome of
the semifinals: namely, that these results prove that
there is (finally!) parity in women's basketball.
No, no they do not.
Flaving seven of the top eight seeds reach the
quarterfinals is not parity. It's the status quo, and it
fits with what we have seen for much of the past
decade: the cream of the crop can knock each other
off, but outside of the top schools, few have much of
a chance. This year's lone exception No. 11 Gon
zaga was a low-seeded team whose run everyone
and their mother saw coming.Three of ESPN's four
women's basketball experts picked the Zags as
their Cinderella choice; Tara VanDerveer pointed
them out in her pre-tournament press conference.
And with good reason: if you have a superstar
(Courtney Vandersloot) surrounded by a crop of
above-average starters, you are generally going to
find success. It's a basic formula that works through
out all levels of basketball and for both men and
women; the distinction is that such a compilation is
harder to come by in the women's game. There is a
more limited pool of talent to choose from, and the

big schools are pretty good at hoarding the best
players. Whereas the men have excellent talent at
the mid-major level Shelvin Mack, Jimmer Fre
dette, Kawhi Leonard, Justin Flarper and so on
their female counterparts are left looking for nee
dles in the haystacks. Simply put, there aren't
enough Vandersloots to go around, and when you
have one, it's not hard to predict accomplishment,
which the Zags had both before and after their run.

nally underrated solely because it
played in a weaker conference. It
wasn't because the team was lacklus
ter until the tournament the Zags
entered March Madness with just
four losses, two of which were to
Final Four teams (Stanford and
Notre Dame).
This, again, is not parity, even
from a historical perspective.
Though it's been nearly 20 years
since two non-No. Is played for the
title, it is routine to have teams
without top billing reach the cham
pionship game. Last year was the
first since 2003 to feature two No. Is
playing in the finals during that
six-season stretch, it was always a
No. 1 against a lower-ranked squad.
We were seven seconds away from
seeing a similar scenario unfold in
2011.
Perhaps it is relative. Connecticut
has had such a stranglehold on the
sport for the past few seasons that
seeing anyone, even a two-seed, in
the championship game instead of
the Huskies is reason enough to re
joice at the leveling of the playing
field. It's not an absurd idea, but it's
also no secret that the Huskies
weren't as strong this year as they
were in their past campaigns after
losing to Stanford in December,
their cloak of invincibility seemingly
vanished. Geno Auriemma's state
ments in light of that defeat said as
much. And besides, even if UConn
was as strong as it was in 2010, a de

feat, particularly in the Final Four,
does not demonstrate a seismic shift.
It shows what we already know
about March Madness: that even in a
sport with clear divisions in talent,
nearly anything can happen in a sin
gle game.
This is not a criticism of the sport
frankly, because there is such a di
vision between the top-tier teams
and everybody else, when two good
but-not-great squads match up, it can
generally be counted on to be pretty
even, which makes for more exciting
games. It's only when those squads
come into contact with the top dogs
that the underdog's chances drop
significantly. Women's basketball is
not at a place where it can replicate
the bedlam seen in the men's tourna
ment. And that's okay: it can get
there. Gary Blair, coach of Texas
A&M, recognized these ideas after
downing Stanford on Sunday.
"Sometimes, you have to go
through growing pains to get to
where we want to be, parity, where
people would be excited where a
Butler and a VCU are playing for the
national championship on the men's
side. We need that on the women's
side as well," he said.
It's no secret that women's basket
ball is growing as a youth sport, and
that talent pools are increasing as a re
sult. Noting and continuing that
progress is a worthwhile endeavor,
one far better than preemptively de
claring the arrival of parity to the
game when that's simply not the case.

Wyndam Makowsky thinks parity is
great, but he'd still rather have a cer
tain No. 1 team in the final. Commis
