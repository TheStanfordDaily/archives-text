# Still no parity in women's basketball
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
For the first time since 1994, the women's
basketball championship game will be
between two non-No. 1 seeds. Tonight's
game features a pair of No. 2 teams that
each had to knock off back-to-back No. 1
squads in order to reach the final. Impressive. Far
more so than the general reaction to the outcome of
the semifinals: namely, that these results prove that
there is (finally!) parity in women's basketball.
No, no they do not.
Flaving seven of the top eight seeds reach the
quarterfinals is not parity. It's the status quo, and it
fits with what we have seen for much of the past
decade: the cream of the crop can knock each other
off, but outside of the top schools, few have much of
a chance. This year's lone exception No. 11 Gon
zaga was a low-seeded team whose run everyone
and their mother saw coming.Three of ESPN's four
women's basketball experts picked the Zags as
their Cinderella choice; Tara VanDerveer pointed
them out in her pre-tournament press conference.
And with good reason: if you have a superstar
(Courtney Vandersloot) surrounded by a crop of
above-average starters, you are generally going to
find success. It's a basic formula that works through
out all levels of basketball and for both men and
women; the distinction is that such a compilation is
harder to come by in the women's game. There is a
more limited pool of talent to choose from, and the

big schools are pretty good at hoarding the best
players. Whereas the men have excellent talent at
the mid-major level Shelvin Mack, Jimmer Fre
dette, Kawhi Leonard, Justin Flarper and so on
their female counterparts are left looking for nee
dles in the haystacks. Simply put, there aren't
enough Vandersloots to go around, and when you
have one, it's not hard to predict accomplishment,
which the Zags had both before and after their run.
Gonzaga's low ranking was a result of being crimi-

Having seven of the
top eight seeds reach
the quarterfinals is
not parity.
