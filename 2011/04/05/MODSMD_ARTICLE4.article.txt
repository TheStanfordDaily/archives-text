# University rejects Kappa Sigma appeal
## Vacated house to be used as upperclassman residence in 2011-12 
### AN LE NGUYEN ZACH ZIMMERMAN EDITORS 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman declined Kappa Sigma's appeal
on Monday, upholding Residential Educa
tion's decision to revoke the fraternity's
housing for the coming academic year. The
chapter will have a chance to apply for rein
statement in January 2012 as part of a for
mal relevancy presentation to a review
panel.
Following Dean of Residential Educa
tion Deborah Golder's March 11 decision to
strip Kappa Sigma of its housing, fraternity
members were given approximately a
week's time to present their case for an ap
peal. Boardman stressed that the appeal
was not intended to reintroduce specific in
cidents that led to Golder's ruling, but to re
view the process as a whole.

"The grounds for appeal were based on
whether the process was unfair or if there
were new facts to consider that weren't pre
sented earlier," he said. "They did not pro
vide that evidence to me to overrule Dean
Golder's decision."
Boardman did make one amendment to
Res Ed's initial ruling. Instead of applying
for housing as part of a larger pool of un
housed organizations, Kappa Sigma will be
given priority, allowing the chapter to make
the necessary changes with an elevated pos
sibility of reclaiming its residence.
"If they make the progress we expect
them to make, they should be given the first
opportunity to move back into their house,"
Boardman said. "It's going to take a lot of
hard work. It also requires strong leader
ship and strong support."
"When we ask them what Kappa Sig
stands for, we want them to have an answer
that is robust and complex," Golder added.

The University is slated to specify the
conditions on April 22.
"Everyone would have liked to see a dif
ferent outcome, and we have worked
tremendously hard for another one to take
place," wrote Kappa Sigma President Brian
Barnes 'l2 in an email to The Daily. "Unfor
tunately, the University felt it was in all par
ties' best interest for this hiatus to occur."
Boardman's decision came as a particu
larly strong disappointment to the younger
crop of Kappa Sigma members.
"Our house has been working very hard
for the past several months to better the cul
ture of the fraternity and to take steps to
create the house that both the University
and the Kappa Sigma members want," said
Malcolm McGregor 'l3.
While members "may disagree" with the
University's ruling, they are committed to
"working wholeheartedly" to
prove that the fraternity should
eventually return to its house, Mc-
Gregor said.
Kappa Sigma's current resi
dence will be used as a Row house
in the 2011-12 academic year,
opening up approximately 55 new
spaces for upperclassmen, the ma
jority of which will be considered
"preferred" slots. According to
Golder, members of Kappa Sigma
will be prohibited from drawing
into the facility.
The converted house will take
on the name "1025 Campus
Drive," indicative of its street ad
dress. Staffing positions will be
filled using this year's unmatched
applicants.
"We have vacancies that pop up
all the time, so we'll go back to the
list of folks that applied, and we'll
use that to drive and define our
process," Golder said. "We have
tons and tons of people that are
great applicants, but there just
weren't enough jobs to go
around."

Even with short-term plans in
place following Kappa Sigma's re
moval, members of the fraternity
are optimistic they will return after
a one-year hiatus. Barnes said he
was "confident" that the chapter
could successfully "work with Res
idential Education to meet their
proposed criteria" to regain their
house in the fall of 2012.

The beginnings of such an effort
have already been in the works.
"As part of the appeal that we
submitted, we laid out several
things that we've already done to
improve the culture of the house,"
McGregor said.
Moving forward, Kappa Sigma
will look to foster a sense of com
mon identity.
"In our Kappa Sigma chapter
bylaws, we have a mission state
ment and part of that mission
statement is to further scholarship,
leadership, community service, the
development of social graces and
the development of cultural
awareness," McGregor said.
"That's something that has always
been there, but in recent years, we
may have lost sight of that."

"I think in our future actions
next year, the things that we're
doing are upholding those goals,"
he added.

Barnes echoed these senti
ments, stating that current frater
nity members 'Took forward to ex
ceeding" the University's expecta
tions as they strive to regain their
house.
