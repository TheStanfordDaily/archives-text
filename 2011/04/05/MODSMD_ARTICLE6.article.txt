## Committee created for Searsville Dam decision 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has started assem
bling a committee for the compre
hensive study of Searsville Dam,
the contentious landmark in
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
whose future has remained unde
cided for decades. According to
Jasper Ridge Director Philippe
Cohen, the committee will decide
the fate of the dam within two
years.
"We're in the process of putting
together a team," Cohen said.
"This is the first time the Universi
ty is really trying to take a compre
hensive approach to the issue."
Searsville Dam has blocked
Corte Madera Creek since its con
struction in 1891, creating the
Searsville Reservoir. Initially used
for recreation, the reservoir is now
a part of Jasper Ridge, where it is
used in research and teaching.
The dam also blocked off his
torical steelhead trout habitat in
the creeks upstream. Steelhead
trout are a nationally threatened
species whose preservation Stan
ford had to address in its Habitat

Conservation Plan (HCP). As The
Daily reported last May, the HCP
did not take a stance on the dam's
fate, saying it was too complex an
issue and that addressing it would
hold up the rest of the elements of
HCP plans.
Not addressing the Searsville
dam issue means that "Stanford is
going to be causing unpermitted
[harm] of endangered species at
the dam," said Matt Stoecker, di
rector of the non-profit Beyond
Searsville Dam Coalition.
This puts the University in vio
lation of state water regulations
and the Endangered Species Act.
Now, the committee will attempt
to finally address this issue apart
from the total HCP.
"Any decision about significant
changes at Searsville is going to
take a long time. If the University
waited to finish its HCP until after
we decided what to do at
Searsville, there would be this long
period of suspense over managing
all the other habitats on campus,"
said professor David Freyberg,
who studies sedimentation at the
site and sits on the Jasper Ridge
Advisory Committee.
The committee will be com
prised of Stanford faculty and ad
ministrators familiar with the issue.
Cohen hopes that they will come up
with one or two preferred options
and some clear, strategic plans for
the site.
"We're taking a very multidisci
plinary perspective," Cohen said.
"We're going to be looking at eco
logical, hydrological, economic and
political all of the different is
sues that come to bear on what we
do with the dam ... at this point, no
issues have been removed from the
table."
A position paper put out by the
committee in Oct. 2007 outlines
many of those options including al
lowing the lake to naturally fill with
sediment, dredging some of the
sediment from the lake but keeping
the dam, dredging and lowering the
dam, or removing the dam alto
gether. Other considerations in
clude adding a fish ladder for steel
head trout or creating an off-stream

reserve for Stanford to maintain its
water supply.
A collection of community in
terests have pushed for removal of
the dam for many years. "While I
applaud Stanford for forming a
committee, American Rivers and
Beyond Searsville Dam coalition
have been asking Stanford to ad
dress the Searsville problem for a
decade," said Steve Rothert, Cali
fornia director of American Rivers.
Cohen outlined that the com
mittee will be a largely internal af
fair made up of faculty members
and Stanford administrators. Public
negotiation will take place after
they come up with preferred op
tions in the best interest of the Uni
versity. "I'm not sure how [the Uni
versity is] going to engage the com
munity, but I know they're commit
ted to doing that. There has to be
some internal clarity about where
we would like to go before we start
negotiating with other groups," he
said.
Stoecker expressed regret that
the committee will be purely inter
nal and not address stakeholder
concerns.
"Stanford can't on its own de
cide what to do in a process that in
volves people upstream and down
stream as well. It's a very complex
project that's going to need to in
volve all these different stakehold
ers," Stoeker said. "Just because
they're going to form a committee
doesn't mean that anything's going
to come of it."
A number of issues beyond
steelhead trout complicate the dis
cussion, including sediment
buildup and water use.
Over its 120-year life, Searsville
has also filled to between 90 and 95
percent of its capacity with sedi
ment, according to Freyberg. On
average, the equivalent of 10 stan
dard dump trucks per day accumu
late in the reservoir, with most com
ing in severe weather or geological
events. The variable deposition
means that it could completely fill
up with sediment next year if there
was a large earthquake and heavy
rainfall, or take up to 50 years at a
slower rate.
When the reservoir fills, the en
tire ecosystem will change, creating
wetlands above the dam with a
Searsville waterfall as opposed to a
Searsville dam. The sediment will
also begin to move downstream
and will affect the channel of San
Francisquito Creek to the bay.
Searsville Dam also provides
water to irrigate Stanford grounds.
Tom Zigterman, associate director
and civil infrastructure manager at
Facilities Operations, who handles
the hydraulic aspects of the dam,
said that the water source is impor
tant to Stanford, providing hun
dreds of acre-feet of water per year.
"We take a sustainable water
management approach at Stan
ford," he said. "It's in Stanford's in
terests to preserve all its water sup
plies."
"I want to be as open minded as
possible about what makes the
most sense. I think there's a really
great opportunity here for Stanford
to make a really important land use
and research contribution, because
this is an issue whose going to re
peat itself many thousands of times
across the country in the coming
decades," Cohen said. "I'm hoping
that whatever we do provides a real
template for how to successfully ap
proach the issue."

struction in 1891, creating the
Searsville Reservoir. Initially used
for recreation, the reservoir is now
a part of Jasper Ridge, where it is
used in research and teaching.
The dam also blocked off his
torical steelhead trout habitat in
the creeks upstream. Steelhead
trout are a nationally threatened
species whose preservation Stan
ford had to address in its Habitat

Conservation Plan (HCP). As The
Daily reported last May, the HCP
did not take a stance on the dam's
fate, saying it was too complex an
issue and that addressing it would
hold up the rest of the elements of
HCP plans.
Not addressing the Searsville
dam issue means that "Stanford is
going to be causing unpermitted
[harm] of endangered species at
the dam," said Matt Stoecker, di
rector of the non-profit Beyond
Searsville Dam Coalition.
This puts the University in vio
lation of state water regulations
and the Endangered Species Act.
Now, the committee will attempt
to finally address this issue apart
from the total HCP.
"Any decision about significant
changes at Searsville is going to
take a long time. If the University
waited to finish its HCP until after
we decided what to do at
Searsville, there would be this long
period of suspense over managing
all the other habitats on campus,"
said professor David Freyberg,
who studies sedimentation at the
site and sits on the Jasper Ridge
Advisory Committee.
The committee will be com
prised of Stanford faculty and ad
ministrators familiar with the issue.
Cohen hopes that they will come up
with one or two preferred options
and some clear, strategic plans for
the site.
"We're taking a very multidisci
plinary perspective," Cohen said.
"We're going to be looking at eco
logical, hydrological, economic and
political all of the different is
sues that come to bear on what we
do with the dam ... at this point, no
issues have been removed from the
table."
A position paper put out by the
committee in Oct. 2007 outlines
many of those options including al
lowing the lake to naturally fill with
sediment, dredging some of the
sediment from the lake but keeping
the dam, dredging and lowering the
dam, or removing the dam alto
gether. Other considerations in
clude adding a fish ladder for steel
head trout or creating an off-stream

reserve for Stanford to maintain its
water supply.
A collection of community in
terests have pushed for removal of
the dam for many years. "While I
applaud Stanford for forming a
committee, American Rivers and
Beyond Searsville Dam coalition
have been asking Stanford to ad
dress the Searsville problem for a
decade," said Steve Rothert, Cali
fornia director of American Rivers.
Cohen outlined that the com
mittee will be a largely internal af
fair made up of faculty members
and Stanford administrators. Public
negotiation will take place after
they come up with preferred op
tions in the best interest of the Uni
versity. "I'm not sure how [the Uni
versity is] going to engage the com
munity, but I know they're commit
ted to doing that. There has to be
some internal clarity about where
we would like to go before we start
negotiating with other groups," he
said.
Stoecker expressed regret that
the committee will be purely inter
nal and not address stakeholder
concerns.
"Stanford can't on its own de
cide what to do in a process that in
volves people upstream and down
stream as well. It's a very complex
project that's going to need to in
volve all these different stakehold
ers," Stoeker said. "Just because
they're going to form a committee
doesn't mean that anything's going
to come of it."
A number of issues beyond
steelhead trout complicate the dis
cussion, including sediment
buildup and water use.
Over its 120-year life, Searsville
has also filled to between 90 and 95
percent of its capacity with sedi
ment, according to Freyberg. On
average, the equivalent of 10 stan
dard dump trucks per day accumu
late in the reservoir, with most com
ing in severe weather or geological
events. The variable deposition
means that it could completely fill
up with sediment next year if there
was a large earthquake and heavy
rainfall, or take up to 50 years at a
slower rate.
When the reservoir fills, the en
tire ecosystem will change, creating
wetlands above the dam with a
Searsville waterfall as opposed to a
Searsville dam. The sediment will
also begin to move downstream
and will affect the channel of San
Francisquito Creek to the bay.
Searsville Dam also provides
water to irrigate Stanford grounds.
Tom Zigterman, associate director
and civil infrastructure manager at
Facilities Operations, who handles
the hydraulic aspects of the dam,
said that the water source is impor
tant to Stanford, providing hun
dreds of acre-feet of water per year.
"We take a sustainable water
management approach at Stan
ford," he said. "It's in Stanford's in
terests to preserve all its water sup
plies."
"I want to be as open minded as
possible about what makes the
most sense. I think there's a really
great opportunity here for Stanford
to make a really important land use
and research contribution, because
this is an issue whose going to re
peat itself many thousands of times
across the country in the coming
decades," Cohen said. "I'm hoping
that whatever we do provides a real
template for how to successfully ap
proach the issue."

Stanford has started assem
bling a committee for the compre
hensive study of Searsville Dam,
the contentious landmark in
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
whose future has remained unde
cided for decades. According to
Jasper Ridge Director Philippe
Cohen, the committee will decide
the fate of the dam within two
years.
"We're in the process of putting
together a team," Cohen said.
"This is the first time the Universi
ty is really trying to take a compre
hensive approach to the issue."
