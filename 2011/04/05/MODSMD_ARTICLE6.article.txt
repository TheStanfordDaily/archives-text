## Committee created for Searsville Dam decision 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has started assem
bling a committee for the compre
hensive study of Searsville Dam,
the contentious landmark in
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
whose future has remained unde
cided for decades. According to
Jasper Ridge Director Philippe
Cohen, the committee will decide
the fate of the dam within two
years.
"We're in the process of putting
together a team," Cohen said.
"This is the first time the Universi
ty is really trying to take a compre
hensive approach to the issue."
Searsville Dam has blocked
Corte Madera Creek since its con
struction in 1891, creating the
Searsville Reservoir. Initially used
for recreation, the reservoir is now
a part of Jasper Ridge, where it is
used in research and teaching.
The dam also blocked off his
torical steelhead trout habitat in
the creeks upstream. Steelhead
trout are a nationally threatened
species whose preservation Stan
ford had to address in its Habitat

Conservation Plan (HCP). As The
Daily reported last May, the HCP
did not take a stance on the dam's
fate, saying it was too complex an
issue and that addressing it would
hold up the rest of the elements of
HCP plans.
Not addressing the Searsville
dam issue means that "Stanford is
going to be causing unpermitted
[harm] of endangered species at
the dam," said Matt Stoecker, di
rector of the non-profit Beyond
Searsville Dam Coalition.
This puts the University in vio
lation of state water regulations
and the Endangered Species Act.
Now, the committee will attempt
to finally address this issue apart
from the total HCP.
"Any decision about significant
changes at Searsville is going to
take a long time. If the University
waited to finish its HCP until after
we decided what to do at
Searsville, there would be this long
period of suspense over managing
all the other habitats on campus,"
said professor David Freyberg,
