## Guericke shares startup experience LinkedIn co-founder discusses professional networking 
### ISAAC GATENO 
Konstantin Guericke, co-founder of the profession
al networking site Linkedln, kicked off the Asia-Pacif
ic Student Entrepreneurship Society (ASES) Stanford
Summit with a keynote presentation entitled "Leverag
ing Networks for Startup Success: Using Linkedln Be
yond Hiring, Getting a Job and Reconnecting."
Guericke said he started Linkedln to address two
problems: the inefficiency of the labor market as a
whole and the lack of a personal "agent" to manage
each individual's brand in the new marketplace.
Guericke explained that before the Industrial Revo
lution, each person was a business. After the revolution,
however, people became more oriented toward finding
a stable job in a large corporation and moving up the hi
erarchy.
"For 20 years or so now, we're into the Information
Revolution," Guericke said.
He explained that each professional is becoming less
a part of a large corporation and more akin to an actor
in Hollywood. Individual actors now market "their own
brands and direct their own careers."
"Linkedln was envisioned as being every profes
sional's agent," Guericke said.
But these developments have their own disadvan
tages. Though the Internet has made it easier for people
to submit their resume to a large number of companies,
recruiters must now to spend a lot more time sifting
through the "noise," he said.
He pointed out that people are more likely to suc
ceed in getting hired when someone within the compa
ny refers them. For this reason, Guericke wanted to find
away to make it easier to find those connections and
make referrals.
"We are your agent for your whole working, produc
tive lives, and that way, we make the job market more
efficient," he said.
In the second part of his talk, Guericke spoke about
the lessons learned from his experience as an entrepre
neur.
He emphasized, in particular, the importance of
teaching and learning entrepreneurship by example
and encouraged attendees to critically question each
lesson.
Guericke rejected the notion that the success of a
company depends on the idea behind it. He was
adamant that execution and distribution are more im
portant.
"Companies just look like overnight successes, but
people forget about who was there before," Guericke
said.
He noted that when Linkedln first launched, jour
nalists compared it to Friendster. They later drew com
parisons to MySpace and now liken Linkedln to Face
book.
Guericke argued that the reason that Linkedln has
continued growing, despite competition from other suc
cessful social networks, is that the company is "clearly
differentiated."

He talked about the importance of distribution and
attributed success to having exposure to consumers
who won't often seek out a better product after they
have seen or used the first one of its class.
"It's not so much first to market but first to contact,"
Guericke said. "Most consumers don't say, 'Here's a
product, let me see what the top competitors are and
choose which is best.'"
"You can add features later, but there is one product
that your friends use," he added.
That fact generates value for the product.
Guericke also stressed the value of relationships, es
pecially in a social media world where companies such
as Linkedln enable people search.
"Behave like you're going to have multiple [interac
tions]," he said, pointing out that search makes it easy
for potential employers to seek out past co-workers, not
just people on a list of references.
He also spoke of the competitive advantage that can
be had by finding information that is not in the public
domain.
"You have to find the person that has that informa
tion in their head," he said.
Other lessons that Guericke discussed were the im
portance of creating a brand, having a good team and
having a little bit of luck.
Tonight, the ASES summit will feature Gordon Eu
banks, co-founder of Symantec, and Jennifer Morris,
senior vice president of Conservation International.
