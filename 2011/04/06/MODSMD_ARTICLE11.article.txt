## The 						Bear Necessities 
### KELSEY GEISER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What do hibernating bears and
space travel have in com
mon? The answer begins in
the frigid Arctic with two in
trepid Stanford biologists
with a penchant for bears. Sleeping bears, to be
exact.
Biologists Dennis Grahn and Craig Heller,
along with their co-workers, staked out in the
Arctic to observe the hibernation patterns of
bears. What they found could upend the way we
think about human sleep and its possibilities.
Hibernation the ability of animals like
bears to sleep through the winter while lower
ing their body temperature and metabolism to
avoid the need for food intake isn't a novel
idea for scientists, yet surprisingly few in
depth hibernation studies have been conduct
ed because of the lack of appropriate technol
ogy that can allow researchers to observe their
subjects.
Grahn described the crude former ap
proach as one in which "somebody snuck up
on a hibernating bear" and took a reading with

a thermometer.
Not now.
Grahn, along with biology professor Craig
Heller and Brian Barnes, Director of the Insti
tute of Arctic Biology in Alaska, set out to im
prove upon this old-school research technique
by applying recent advancements in telemetry
technology to further our knowledge on bears
and the details of their hibernation. They pub
lished their findings in "Hibernation in Black
Bears: Independence of Metabolic Suppres
sion from Body Temperature."
Grahn and Heller had previous experience
studying smaller animals' hibernation pat
terns. Building off of Barnes' access to bears
through his work with the Institute of Arctic
Biology and a shared interest in studying what
constitutes hibernation in a bear, a group of six
intrigued researchers initiated a study in Fair
banks, Alaska, utilizing the latest technology.
"We certainly were the first people to use
[new telemetry technology] on hibernation in
small animals, and, so out of that, questions
about bears came up," Grahn said.
Each experiment lasted six months and
studied two black bears at a time. The bears
were set up in large crates made to look and
feel as comfortable as their dens would be in

the wild to allow for a normal hibernation.
The bears were embedded with transmit
ters that sent radio signals through antennae in
the walls of the bears' hibernation crates. Each
bear was equipped through surgery with an
electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure
brain waves, electrocardiograph (EKG) to
measure heart rate and devices for measuring
body temperature.
Through their previous work, Barnes and
Grahn knew that the body temperatures of
small hibernators drop to the temperature of
their surrounding environment and back up
again in cycles while the animal is asleep. When
body temperatures cool, the animals experi
ence a reduction in metabolic rate. However
during this fluctuation, the hibernators do not
experience REM sleep.
However, the results of these past experi
ments did not coincide with the researchers' re
cent bear study. Bears,unlike other hibernators,
do not lower their temperature as much as
would be expected given how drastically their
metabolism decreases.
As it turns out, Bears actually shiver to keep
their body temperatures from dropping too
low while they experience both REM and non-
REM sleep. Analysis of bears' brain activity re

vealed that they remain aware of their sur
roundings throughout the hibernation period.
"The really interesting thing was the indica
tion that they have a biochemical suppression
of metabolism apart from the temperature ef
fect," Heller said of the findings. "So their tem
perature only goes down a few degrees but
their metabolism goes down by 75 percent, and
you can explain that just from the cooling off of
the tissues."
These discoveries about how bears hiber
nate could potentially be applied to advance
human surgical practices, care for stroke or
heart attack victims and even space travel, ac
cording to Heller.
"If you want to go to Mars, you might as well
sleep more," he said.
Although many of the potential applica
tions are far from being realized and data
analysis still stands to be completed on the hi
bernation studies, the researchers are deter
mined to continue gleaning new knowledge
from their research.
However, for Heller, the critical aspect of
the experiment was the fact that the subjects
"weren't golden bears."
