# OPINIONS
## EXECUTIVE SLATE OP-EDS Cruz/Macgregor-Dennis 
### 
Despite the ever-present Stanford bub
ble, we are lucky and privileged to
have the opportunity to encounter an
abundance of cultures, ethnicities and back
grounds. There is a diversity of beliefs and val
ues that each student has to offer, but too
often we have encountered the problem of
voicing these passions. This is where "Stanford
2.0" comes in. We believe that we all have
opinions and experiences to share and that the
issues that face each community or student or
ganization cannot be adequately solved with
out an empowered student body and a re
sponsive student government. By creating an
intersection of experience and engagement,
we hope to build a more unified and aware
Stanford community. We are Michael Cruz 'l2
and Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 and we are
excited to be running for ASSU Executive.
Right now, as we write this piece from our
secret headquarters, we are surrounded by
other students who are as invested in commu
nity issues as we are. With our campaign
theme of "Stanford 2.0", we hope to not only
empower and engage all Stanford students in
voicing their needs, but also foster a more
open and forthcoming ASSU, one that meas
ures results and is consistently searching for
better ways to fulfill student needs. We are cur
rently endorsed by PASU, SOCC, Stanford
Club Sports, Stanford Dems and the Queer
Coalition, endorsements that speak volumes
about our commitment to addressing and re
sponding to a diverse set of student issues.
Here is a taste of our platform, which will give
you a better sense of the projects we intend to
tackle. A more complete platform can be
found at: stanford2.com:

Empowerment
Career: Provide consistent student and ca
reer development support from freshman
year-onward, regardless of your major.
Health: Create a centralized website
specifically for health and wellness, providing
information and directing students to the ap
propriate health resources.
Queer issues: Empower the queer commu
nity through gender-and-queer-sensitive facil
ities and gender-neutral housing. We also
firmly believe that it is unacceptable to ask the
student body to vote on the civil rights of a mi
nority, and we support the campaign to vote
"abstain" on ROTC.
Diversity: Advocate restoration of all com
munity center professional staff to full-time
employment, and create a database system for
student groups and community centers to en
hance communication between alumni, cur
rent students, and the greater Stanford com
munity.
Student Life
Housing: Create the position of a Diversity
Peer Educator as part of dorm staff, who will
be trained in diversity and queer issues, work
ing to foster a feeling of safe and open space
for all Stanford students.
Dining: Make dining options more stu
dent-friendly through healthier late-nite op
tions and effective responses to student feed
back.
Technology: Take advantage of technology
in order to streamline Stanford event plan
ning, rework Stanford websites such as Zim-
bra, and create an iASSU app to en
able greater student-ASSU commu
nication and participation.
Living: Create a Life Skills class
that addresses financial literacy, lap
top maintenance, cooking skills, and
other essential areas.

Advocacy
Sexual Health: Lower the height
ened Standard of Proof to allow for
"clear and convincing" or "prepon
derance of evidence " instead of "be
yond a reasonable doubt.
Disabilities: Work with campus
organizations and the administra
tion to create a map of gender-neu
tral and accessible bathrooms/
dorms in order to improve the Dis
ability Draw.
Grads: Increase flexibility of
health insurance options for gradu
ate students.
Women: Work with ResEd,
WoCo and other administrators to
create a "sexual violence monitor"
training program for organizations
that throw large party-type events.

Student Engagement
Green: Institutionalize Green
Events Consulting for student
events and incentivize attendance at
certified "Green" events with an
ASSU Event Point system.
Service: Work to unify efforts
among public service sub-communi
ties, and collaborate with campus en
trepreneurship groups to emphasize
social entrepreneurship and service.
Arts: Create a centralized forum
for the performing arts community

events as well as facilitate communi
cation between different perform
ance groups.
Greek: Increase ASSU engage
ment with the IFC, ISC, MGC, and
AAFSA, and work to find storage
space for non-housed fraternities
and sororities.
This is merely a brief glimpse of
what we hope to accomplish in the
coming year with your help, and
while these issues may seem sepa
rate and discrete, remember that
they come together and define the
Stanford community as a whole. We
want to hear what you think, so feel
free to contact us at cruzmacgregor
dennis@gmail.com. We look for
ward to working together and build
ing Stanford 2.0 with you.
