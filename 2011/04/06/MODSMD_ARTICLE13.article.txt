### 
We have had the opportunity to en
mesh ourselves within the fabric
that is Stanford to learn the nu
ances, values and uniqueness of the individu
als of our community. As such, it is our goal to
make the single the collective, to give every
individual the opportunity to develop their
leadership potential while enhancing their
ability to see beyond barriers and to gain a
sense of agency within the general Stanford
community.
We are Tenzin Seldon 'l2 and Joe Vasquez
'll and we are looking to be your next ASSU
Executives. We have been actively involved
in the Stanford community both inside the
ASSU and out and are looking to bring a new
level of inclusion, relevance and excitement
to student involvement. We are running to
make a difference in a real way, to bring di
verse and rich communities together and to
work on issues facing every Stanford student.
Our vision centers around enacting con
crete change, working alongside the adminis
tration and students like you. Stanford is our
home and we believe we must work together
to make a real, tangible difference. As such,
the four major themes of our platform are:
Promoting Mental Health and Well-being:
We plan to engage students in dialogue
with resources such as Vaden, CAPS and The
Bridge about how to improve wellness on
campus; leverage our visibility as ASSU
Execs to create more classes on campus ad
dressing issues of mental health; incorporate
workshops in dorms and support for in
creased salary for Peer Health Educator
(PHE); advocate for support, safet, and well

ness in the Greek community.
Diversity and Tolerance:
We deeply care and are committed to is
sues and promotion of diversity, equality and
tolerance on campus. We will provide the
necessary support and space for community
centers to raise awareness on specific issues
by supporting the Diversity Advisory Board.
We will initiate campaigns to raise awareness
of the Acts of Intolerance Protocol and will
engage with administration and promote
greater dialogue with Stanford police and the
larger community.
Advising and Student Life:
We will increase the opportunities for
mentorship and interaction between the
graduate and undergraduate student popula
tion by working closely with the Graduate
Student Council; strengthen advising by
working with UAR and administrators and
make the transition to Stanford accessible
and personal for everyone, including first
generation, low-income students; provide
more career support and guidance through
working with the Cardinal Careers and Ca
reer Development Center.
Transparency and Accessibility:
We envision an ASSU that works along
side the general Stanford community, one
that actively reaches out to those it aims to
serve. We promise to initiate and launch
agendas that are important to the larger
Stanford population and create avenues to
hear public opinion during Execu
tive and Senate meetings.
These are just some of the high
er-level ideas that we are looking to
enact. Don't hesitate to shoot us an
email and invite us to coffee or din
ner. We would love to hear about
what's important to you or even
just to chat. Our broad level of ex
perience and strong track record
does not even come close to under
scoring the level of commitment
and dedication we have for our po
sition and serving you. Feel free to
reach out to us at josephv@stan
ford.edu or tseldon@stanford.edu.
