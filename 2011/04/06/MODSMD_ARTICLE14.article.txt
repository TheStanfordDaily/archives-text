# WANDERLUST
## A
						Weekend in Stockholm 
### Johnny Bartz 
It must have been one of those
I'm-about-as-pleased-as-a-wet
cat days when I threw my broken
umbrella on the ground, took off my
awkwardly muddy pants and
booked a ticket to Sweden. Scandi
navia in the winter is cold, snowy
and dark, however I couldn't resist
free lodging and a chance to practice
my Swedish.

The whole week before I debat
ed whether or not I should even go.
It was kind of like the time I found
an amazing quads-length orange,
pink and magenta knit angora hip
ster sweater online the epitome
of a bad-purchasing choice. The
sweater and my trip were both huge
mistakes, financially and just in gen
eral, but I legitimized. I could work
on the plane and wear my sweater in
Sweden!
I fell asleep as soon as I was un
derway, in blissful absence of my
roommate's loud nocturnal typing.
Before I knew it I was at the Arlan
da airport, clacking my way across
the hardwood floors and uttering
dumb phrases in Norwegian to the
beautiful Swedish immigration offi
cial. She smiled and said good morn
ing to me in English, which I count
ed as at least a partial win. Luckily,
all Scandinavian languages are very
closely related, so if you know one,
you can kind of communicate in the
other two. Not that it matters
though, because everyone speaks
English.
I took the high-speed train into
the city and watched the falling
snow against aspen trees. It was the
cheapest choice, and I was quite
pleased that I qualified for the
under-25-child fare. I cursed the de
veloped world because the WiFi
wasn't working and thought to my
self, I wonder how I will meet my
friend at the train station.
Back in my Boy Scouting days
no joke, Wilderness Survival merit
badge we were taught to stay put
in one place when lost in the woods.
Surely this applied at the train sta
tion. I pawed once or twice at the
odd Swedish telephone, but after
swiping my credit card in a few
places, I decided that I had none of
the appropriate coins. I have a bad
record with foreign payphones.
Luckily I arrived on time, unlike
when I planned to meet up with a
friend at Platform 9 3/4 on a jaunt to
London earlier this year. Eventually
I was found.
I packed light, so my friend and I
did a bit of exploring of old Stock
holm. Seeing the bridges, statues, ar
chitecture was all well and good. I
wasn't in the museum-ing type of
mood, so I instead posed in front of
particularly precarious historical
figures. I was quite impressed with a
swan, duck and goose smorgasbord
as in they were being fed in the
park and I took pictures quite
cultural. The Grand Hotel, Royal
Palace and several churches are all

within walking distance. Skating in
the park was pleasant, and to top it
all off there was a U.S. space exhibit
in the mall.
At lunchtime, we ventured to an
all-you-can-eat sushi place. As it was
also the cheapest lunch option, I was
a bit worried. I was hungry and was
n't about to offend my host, but let's
just say that some of my sushi con
noisseur friends would have been
disappointed. As my host was quite
excited about sharing this secret
sushi place, it became my immediate
favorite food. I love this sushi! On
the note of food though, one cannot
leave Sweden without trying
Swedish meatballs.
A serious concern for those trav
eling to Scandinavia is that alcoholic
beverages are ridiculously expen
sive due to high taxes. It's perfectly
legal to bring from home as long as
it's within the country-specific limits
for Sweden it's 1 liter of spirits or
2 liters of wine. I received a king's
welcome when I unwrapped a bottle
of Svedka ironically much cheap
er in the U.S. This was soon sup
planted with Red Bulls, chips and
biler, a Swedish candy akin to
Swedish Fish, except shaped like
cars. I'm fairly certain you can buy
them at Ikea (but I'm not really al
lowed to go there since my Norwe
gian family wouldn't approve). It
was truly a feast fit for a coterm!
Nightlife in Stockholm is superb,
however as with everything in that
city, get ready to spend your money.
To say I was partying with Swedish

The sweater and my
trip were both huge
mistakes,financially
and just in general,
but I legitimized.
