## Closing the Citizen-Soldier Gulf 
### REBECCA YOUNG, M.A. '11 
ROTC'S absence from this
campus has removed a criti
cal mode of discourse be
tween the military and the civilian
population it serves. As the daugh
ter of an Air Force officer, I grew
up entirely behind the gates of U.S.
military installations. The schools I
attended were filled almost exclu
sively with fellow military depend
ents. College marked my first ex
perience living off base and being
surrounded primarily by civilians.
1 was struck that while 1 under
stood the nuances of civilian life,
my civilian counterparts had virtu
ally no notion of what life in the
military entails. Worse, they
seemed almost proud of their ig
norance.

The gap between the military
and civilian populations has been
growing further apart in recent
decades. Though we are currently
prosecuting two wars, only 1 per

cent of Americans is directly af
fected. The Chairmen of the Joint
Chiefs, Admiral Michael Mullen,
recently warned of the danger of
this increasing gulf between the
military and the civilians they
serve to protect. The implications
of this gulf could prove to be detri
mental not only to civil-military
relations, but to the foreign policy
decisions of the United States. For
citizens and politicians to truly un
derstand the cost of war, they must
be intimately aware of the sacri
fices we ask our military to make.
By the same token, a military
should be intimately tied to the so
ciety it serves to remain keenly
aware of the values and freedoms
they are asked to make sacrifices
for. Our Founding Fathers feared
the potential dangers of having a
large standing army as a threat to
liberty; instead, they placed em
phasis on the formation of militias

for the very reason that they were
so closely knitted to their home
communities.
Not only should the military be
closely tied to the community it
serves, but it is strongest when it is
a reflection of that community.
Thucydides once contended that
"the society that separates its
scholars from its warriors will have
its thinking done by cowards and
its fighting done by fools." His ob
servation is no less relevant in his
ancient Greek republic than our
American one. The military should
be a reflection of the society it
serves, and this should apply to the
academic community no less than
any other part of the general pub
lic. Just as the concept of the citi
zen-soldier serves to sustain civic
engagement and ensure political
accountability, the idea of the war
rior-scholar serves to provide en
lightened military leadership and
protect the core values of the pop
ulation. ROTC enables future of
ficers to learn in a hybrid military
civilian environment, where they
can study military doctrine while
engaging in the civilian academic
world. ROTC has been a vital
component of creating a more ed
ucated and more professional mil
itary, which ultimately benefits
the society it serves.
A society should demand that
its military leaders be the best and
the brightest, but it must also
allow them the opportunity to ob
tain such education. By denying
ROTC's right to exist at Stanford,
opponents are turning a blind eye
to the reality of global politics;
they ignore the fact that the mili
tary will not cease to be a defining
social force so long as violent con
flict exists in the world. In actuali
ty, opponents are promulgating a
viewpoint completely antithetical
to the values of a university edu
cation. Intolerance, xenophobia
and isolationism have no place in
academia, and yet these are the
defining characteristics of those
who seek to keep ROTC out of
Stanford. The pervasive ignorance
of this viewpoint does only harm
to the state of civil-military rela
tions and the prevalence of this
viewpoint is detrimental for our
society as a whole. Shouldn't we
ensure that our future military of
ficers are as well educated as pos
sible so that we may all benefit
from enlightened military leader
ship in the future? As a society, we
could ask for nothing more than
to have educated warrior-scholars
fighting to guarantee our rights.
The wind of freedom does indeed
blow here at Stanford, but let us
never forget who secured this
freedom.
