# Miss Fit – The frustrations of sustaining a healthy lifestyle on a college campus
## 
### ERICA MORGAN '11 
I am not a physiology or nutrition
expert, nor am I an "athlete." I
would like to begin with this dis
claimer to dispel any notion that I
am attempting to market myself as
such. I am simply your average
twenty-something female who de
veloped a passion for health and a
penchant for clean eating. My ad
ventures in the fitness world have
been hindered by obstacles ranging
from my own ignorance to misinfor
mation, from prejudices to dining
hall inflexibilities and from social
pressures to the strains of college
life. I emerge from these road
blocks at a high level of personal

physical condition with the expecta
tion of continuing to improve my
health and athleticism. As I become
conscious of the extreme impor
tance of fitness in sustaining a
happy and (somewhat) sane college
life I'm compelled to share a few in
sights that may be useful to my non
athlete peers seeking fitness infor
mation. This week's tidbit is: Com
mon roadblocks to achieving fitness
goals in the college setting.
1. Apathy
Exercise and diet did not feature
prominently in my thoughts during
the high school/college transition.
I'm sure there were some fitness afi

cionados among the throngs of
freshmen, but those of us not on a
Stanford sports roster likely had lit
tle concern with healthy dining op
tions and navigating athletic facili
ties. We were busy being bombard
ed with hundreds of new faces,
classes, a cappella groups, parties
and profound late-night bonding
sessions. Who in her right mind
leaps out of bed for a jaunt around
campus loop before that 9 a.m.
Spanish class after a Wednesday
night spent chugging wine and gorg
ing on delicious cheeses?
2. Time (lack of time, that is)
Nowadays, I begin every day
with a run and end each day with a
weight-lifting session. Oftentimes
when my workout program comes
up in conversation, I receive the re
action: "I wish 1 had the time to
work out like you do." I hate to
burst the bubble, but the time to
work out doesn't just "happen." I
am no less busy with academics, ex
tracurricular shenanigans and so
cial engagements than your typical
Stanford girl. You have to create the
time to exercise and find away to
shove it into your tight schedule.
This is difficult —not impossible.
3. Negative Stereotypes
These stereotypes come in many
flavors. Nobody wants to be known
as the "gym rat" who gazes admir
ingly at his biceps in the Arrillaga
mirrors. Everyone always has a
snide laugh at "rollerblade woman"

who glides to class to get extra car
dio in. I have personally become
known in Stern dining as the weird
"chicken-girl," because I always re
quest that the chef grill plain, un
marinated chicken for me (I don't
want oil and sugar). There are de
tractors quick to label consistent ex
ercise as "compulsive" and con
scious eating as "restrictive." Of
course disordered eating and dis
torted body image are serious issues
and quite prevalent at Stanford.
However, being labeled as a "com
pulsive over-exerciser" merely be
cause I'm not a Stanford-sanctioned
athlete is disturbing and ridiculous.
4. Ignorance (and inability to set
goals)
This was one of my most signifi
cant roadblocks after I overcame
the apathy factor and decided to get
in shape. There is a vast world of
misinformation and a burdensome
quantity of good information too.
Navigating the sea of fad diets,
trendy workout programs, blogs,
supplements, protein powders, per
sonal trainers and stylish, over
priced spandex can be daunting and

discouraging. It has taken years of
floundering to locate what I consid
er reliable sources of information
about exercise and nutrition. On a
related note, a common challenge
to reaching health goals is defining
those goals in the first place. Do you
want to excel in a particular area?
Become a better runner, cyclist,
etc.? Do you want to gain muscle?
Lose fat? Tone? Without setting re
alistic and well-defined goals, it will
be impossible to sort out the good
information from the bad.
5. Misconceptions and overgen
eralizations
This is an enormous category,
and I mention it here for the pur
pose of dispelling some of the most
common health/fitness misconcep
tions. A) Fit does not mean skinny.
Getting into shape does not neces
sarily mean losing weight. I have
spent the past six months attempt
ing to gain five pounds of lean mus
cle, and it was much more physical
ly demanding than periods of my
life when I've attempted to lose
weight. B) Crash diets do not work.
Rather, they are not sustainable.

Maybe you can drop ten pounds
with the latest fad on the market,
but you'll gain that and more when
you stop. Making a healthy diet a
lifestyle choice is the only realistic
way to achieve a strong, fit home
ostasis. C) Achieving fitness goals
requires a plan and a strategy. It is
unbelievably frustrating to watch
the people in the gym who wander
randomly from machine to ma
chine, pumping out a few ineffectu
al reps and leave thinking they've
achieved something. Don't be
afraid to ask for information and in
struction! There are plenty of re
sources, especially at the Stanford
gyms. If you're going to take the
time to go to the gym, make sure
you're not wasting it.
