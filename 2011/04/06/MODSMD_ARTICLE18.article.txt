## Vote Abstain: What It Means and Why It Makes Sense 
### JOHN HASKELL '12 ASSU Chief of Staff [SV1] "part," not "a part 
To vote abstain is to have a nu
anced opinion, to have an un
derstanding of the implica
tions of the vote this Thursday and
Friday and to know that this vote
has the greatest effect on not one,
but two marginalized communities
who deserve greater voice than they
are being afforded. It is not a stance
on ROTC and in fact brings togeth
er both sides.

As ASSU Chief of Staff, I am
leading the Vote Abstain campaign
because I believe it is important
that as a Stanford community, we
can do a better job, create a better
forum and allow for a better outlet
for those most affected by the ensu
ing decision to be made by those
administrators charged with listen
ing to student input. Let us stand to
gether in voting abstain so that we
do not trivialize the small groups of
people, whether they be pro or anti
ROTC, into one singular vote but
rather afford them an equally pow
erful voice within the appropriate
forums. Let us as a student body not
be wrapped up in a statistic or re
duced to a number in a poll, but
bring the diverse complex opinions
we have to the Faculty Senate and
give that legitimate voice.
The ROTC situation is compli
cated because there are two very
small and equally marginalized
subsets on campus that are a part of
this vote. I will be the first person to
admit that the intricacies of
whether it should be back on cam
pus are numerous and at times,
both sides very convincing. I try to
put myself in other people's shoes
as much as possible before making
a judgment, and in this, it is no dif
ferent.

I am from Philadelphia, Penn
sylvania and I wonder what I would
think if ROTC did not permit peo
ple from my city from participating.
What if I as well as my Philly peers
were so explicitly affected by this
program and then we as a student
body voted on whether it should
come back? I think it is safe to as
sume that I am going to lose that
vote and my voice is not going to
have the magnitude that it deserves

because I am so explicitly affected
by the measure.
My voice and my Philadelphian
peers are such a small minority on
campus, and yet we are very much a
part [SVl]of the diversity that
makes up Stanford. Ultimately, it is
my hope that people would under
stand that I deserve to be heard in
the forum of the Faculty Senate and
not referred to as part of a statistic.
By abstaining, I personally be
lieve it is about making sure that
each person has an equally power
ful voice with those making the de
cision. This poll is the measure of
the climate of the student body.
They will point to this poll, if given
legitimacy, as the barometer of
what Stanford students think, trivi
alizing and ultimately, stripping us
of the power to explain our opin
ions.
The minority voice should be
able to sit on equal ground as the
majority opinion, whether it is
those often marginalized in the
ROTC or those discriminated
against in the transgender commu
nity. That way, y OH can go to the fac
ulty senate and have a big voice as
opposed to one vote where minori
ties who are most affected by the
decision have disproportionate im
pact.
Discriminating on either side of
the issue is not fair to those commu
nities that are affected and margin
alized. I am abstaining because I
want to see those specific individu
als not be reduced to a singular vote
when proportionally they are by far
the most effected subset of the pop
ulation. I am not voting on ROTC;
I am voting abstain because I fully
understand what it means to use my
voice effectively and fully under
stand what this ballot measure
means.

I implore that you, as a Stanford
voter, protect the diversity of opin
ions we as a student body encapsu
late. Vote abstain this Thursday and
Friday.
