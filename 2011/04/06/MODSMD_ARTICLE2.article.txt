## Precourt Center grants three research awards 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
The Precourt Energy Efficiency
Center awarded three grants this year
to investigate the reduction of energy
use in buildings. The grants, worth
$400,000 each, were awarded to a
Stanford economist and teams in the
School of Engineering and the Grad
uate School of Business.
Mechanical engineering professor
Gianluca laccarino and civil engi
neering professor Martin Fischer
won the grant for their computer
model, which aims to predict energy
use in buildings. They plan to test their
model in the Yang and Yamazaki En
vironment and Energy (Y2E2) build
ing, which is designed to be one of the
greenest buildings on campus.
Civil engineering professor Ray
mond Levitt and Erica Plambeck, a
professor at the Graduate School of
Business, are looking at ways to help
the construction industry adopt ener
gy-efficient innovations. Despite the
recent increase in energy-saving tech
nologies, few have been used in the
building industry.
Matthew Harding, an assistant
professor of economics, intends to
study how financial incentives can
encourage individuals to conserve
energy.
