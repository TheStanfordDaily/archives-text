## CARD CRUISES Four Cardinal pitchers combine on four-hitter 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Two games after piling on 22 runs
against Washington State, the No. 11
Stanford baseball team proved it
can win with its arms too, holding
San Jose State to two runs on four
hits Tuesday night en route to a 5-2
victory.
On a beautiful night at Sunken
Diamond a pleasant change from
snowy Washington senior starter
Danny Sandbrink paced the Cardi
nal (14-7, 2-1 Pac-10), tossing four
no-hit innings and striking out two.
The Spartans (19-9) did not reach

base until a leadoff walk in the fourth
and didn't record their first hit until
the sixth.

With his patented "funk" pitch
a sinker with unpredictable move
ment dancing all over the strike
zone, Sandbrink never let San Jose
State get comfortable at the plate,
"They handle the bats well, but I
just kept the ball low and they got
themselves out," Sandbrink said.

"The funk was working well."
Stanford wasted little time get
ting on the board offensively. Sopho
more center fielder Tyler Gaffney
led off the home half of the first with
a walk and came around to score on
back-to-back singles by sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger and
freshman first baseman Brian Ragi
ra. The single by Diekroeger extend
ed his hit streak to 15 games.
The Cardinal then extended its
lead in the second. After another
perfect inning by Sandbrink, the
Cardinal exploded for four runs,

IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Senior pitcher Danny Sandbrink (2-0), above, went four shutout innings to get the win versus San Jose State. Sandbrink used a pitch he calls the "funk,"
which is a variation of a sinker, to keep Spartan hitters off balance. He did not allow a hit and only surrendered one walk in Stanford's 5-2 victory.
