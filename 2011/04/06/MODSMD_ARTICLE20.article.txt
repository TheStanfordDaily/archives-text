### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Two games after piling on 22 runs
against Washington State, the No. 11
Stanford baseball team proved it
can win with its arms too, holding
San Jose State to two runs on four
hits Tuesday night en route to a 5-2
victory.
On a beautiful night at Sunken
Diamond a pleasant change from
snowy Washington senior starter
Danny Sandbrink paced the Cardi
nal (14-7, 2-1 Pac-10), tossing four
no-hit innings and striking out two.
The Spartans (19-9) did not reach

base until a leadoff walk in the fourth
and didn't record their first hit until
the sixth.

With his patented "funk" pitch
a sinker with unpredictable move
ment dancing all over the strike
zone, Sandbrink never let San Jose
State get comfortable at the plate,
"They handle the bats well, but I
just kept the ball low and they got
themselves out," Sandbrink said.

"The funk was working well."
Stanford wasted little time get
ting on the board offensively. Sopho
more center fielder Tyler Gaffney
led off the home half of the first with
a walk and came around to score on
back-to-back singles by sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger and
freshman first baseman Brian Ragi

ed his hit streak to 15 games.
The Cardinal then extended its
lead in the second. After another
perfect inning by Sandbrink, the
Cardinal exploded for four runs,

IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Senior pitcher Danny Sandbrink (2-0), above, went four shutout innings to get the win versus San Jose State. Sandbrink used a pitch he calls the "funk,"
which is a variation of a sinker, to keep Spartan hitters off balance. He did not allow a hit and only surrendered one walk in Stanford's 5-2 victory.

once again ignited by a leadoff
walk. Following a single from
freshman designated hitter Brian
Guymon, senior catcher Zach
Jones brought home freshman
right fielder Austin Wilson for the
second run of the game with a sac
rifice fly to left. Jones, who had
been in a season-long slump before
the Washington State series, now
has 11 RBI in his last four games.
Gaffney then kept the inning
moving with a double, setting up
senior left fielder Ben Clowe's RBI
groundout to short. Gaffney came
around to score on an error by San
Jose State, its first of three on the

night. Sophomore third baseman
Stephen Piscotty capped the inning
with a run-scoring double down the
left field line.
From there, it was all about the
Cardinal pitchers.
Sandbrink once again set down
the Spartan offense in order in the
third. After a walk to start the
fourth, the only base runner Sand
brink allowed, the senior struck out
Danny Stienstra, the Spartans'
leading hitter, to end his night.
"Tonight we grabbed an early
lead and that makes it a lot easier
to pitch versus a zero-zero game,"
Sandbrink said. "You can be much
more aggressive on the mound."
Moving from a veteran to a
rookie, head coach Mark Marquess
handed the ball to A.J. Vanegas.
The freshman quickly retired the
side in the fifth, but ran into trouble
in the sixth. After issuing the fourth
leadoff walk of the game, Vanegas
allowed a single and then a deep fly
ball that set up a first and third sit
uation.
Vanegas got the grounder he
was hoping for, but the ball was hit
too slowly for Diekroeger and
freshman second baseman Lonnie
Kauppila to turn the double play,
allowing San Jose State to score its
first run of the night.
Junior Scott Snodgress kept the
Spartans' bats at bay in the seventh
and eighth, surrendering only one
hit. Piscotty saved a would-be dou
ble with a backhand dive down the
line at third.
The Spartans managed to
scratch across one more run
against junior closer Chris Reed,
but it was too little, too late. Reed
struck out pinch hitter Tyler Chris
tian for the final out of the ball
game.
The win improves Stanford's
record to 6-0 in midweek games
and extends its overall winning
streak to three games.
Next up for the Cardinal is a
conference clash against USC in
Los Angeles this weekend.
