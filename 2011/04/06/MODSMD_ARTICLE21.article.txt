# TROJANS, ANTEATERS BESTED BY POLO
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's water polo team finished
its Southern California road trip
unscathed, taking two tough con
tests over No. 13 UC-Irvine and
No. 3 USC. Stanford (20-0, 5-0
MPSF) won 13-4 and 9-8, respec
tively.
After solid wins against No. 15
UC-Davis and No. 4 UCLA last
weekend, the Cardinal had anoth
er match against USC (15-4, 3-2),
which defeated Stanford in the
2010 NCAA National Champi
onship game by one goal. Stanford
has not lost since that game, enter
ing the rematch with 18 straight
victories, including two wins
against the Trojans this season.

Stanford fell behind early
in this matchup, down 4-1 after a
quarter of play. Junior driver
Nadia Dan scored half of the USC
goals in the first quarter.
Even with the three-goal deficit
on the road, Stanford came surg
ing back and went on a 4-0 run to
capture the lead. The two squads
went into final period of regula
tion in a 5-5 deadlock.
Stanford held a 7-5 advantage
in the fourth quarter, but USC bat
tled back to force overtime. In the
second overtime period, sopho
more driver Jillian Garton
launched skip-shot bar-in that
sealed the deal.
"We were in disarray on de
fense in the first quarter, and we
played poorly at both ends the last
few minutes of the game," said
head coach John Tanner. "But we
were organized on defense and
had quality possessions in the

overtime."
The nine Cardinal goals were
scored by a variety of players.
Sophomore two-meter Annika
Dries and freshmen driver Kim
Krueger each tallied a pair. Junior
two-meter Melissa Seidemann,
junior drivers Pallavi Menon and
Cassie Churnside, and freshmen
drivers Kelsey Suggs and Garton
notched a goal apiece.
"We use more players than
other teams," Tanner said. "This
weekend we got impressive contri
butions from everyone on the ros
ter, often in areas outside their pri-

Mary role."
The Cardinal's diversified of
fensive attack was complimented
by excellent goalie play, as senior
Amber Oland had nine stops.
Even after an emotional victo
ry, Stanford looked sharp the fol
lowing day against the Anteaters
(14-B).The Cardinal jumped out to
an 8-2 halftime lead with sopho
more Kate Baldoni in the cage.
Baldoni finished the 13-4 rout with
eleven saves.
