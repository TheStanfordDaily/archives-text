# Correcting College Cups

Though my colleague Jacob
Jaffe has explored the
many, many failings of the
Capital One Cup in the
past, I feel like it's a good
time to revisit the issue now that the
winter sports season is winding down
and the big spring sports led by
baseball and softball are in full
swing.
With a few winter sports left to be
counted, Stanford is holding its own in
the standings, at third in the women's
competition and fourth in the men's
(and that doesn't count the results of
the recent women's NCAA Tourna
ment).
So it appears that the Capital One
Cup has completed at least one of its
stated missions: prevent Stanford from
winning every year by splitting up
men's and women's sports and creat
ing a tier system to award more points
to sports on the basis of "popularity"
(i.e. ones arbitrarily chosen by the
Cup's organizers). The other goal to
award schools for being good at foot
ball and basketball seems to be
working fairly well, as the two teams
atop the men's standings are Auburn
and Connecticut.
Having seen the results roll in so far,
I can see flaws in the Capital One Cup
most obviously, is its egregious bias
in favor of the big revenue sports. Aside
from its top finish in football, the
Auburn men only have one other top
-10 finish (sixth place at the swimming
and diving championships), while
UConn has only its basketball title to
speak of. On the women's side of
things, Cal is in the lead, but its position
is fairly warranted: the Golden Bears
won the swimming title and finished
second in volleyball.
Yet the most important failing that
I see in the Capital One Cup is its divi
sion into men's and women's sports. An
award that purports to reward overall
athletic excellence should do just that,
without any conditions. I see no reason
to separate out the men's and women's
programs, since the exploits of male
and female athletes should not merit
separate awards. It also hurts programs
like Stanford's, whose strength has tra
ditionally lain in its women's teams.
With that said, I believe that the Di
rectors' Cup which Stanford has
won 16 consecutive years has some
flaws of its own which could use cor
recting. For those of you who are unfa
miliar, Stanford has won the award
every year buts its first, but the Cardi
nal's strength comes from more than
one source. Of course, Stanford has ex
emplary programs top to bottom, but a
large reason for our Directors' Cup
dominance is the sheer size of our ath
letic program.
Stanford fields 31 varsity athletic
teams, easily one of the largest pro
grams in the country. Looking down
the final Directors' Cup standings from
last season, it is clear that Stanford's
size gives it an unmistakable edge. Sec
ond-place Florida has 21 varsity pro

grams, third-place Virginia has 25 and
UCLA, coming in fourth, has 22 teams.
Thus, the Cardinal has a bigger margin
of error, since it can rely on a large
number of programs (each of which is
equally weighted) to inflate its place in
the standings.
Thus, the Directors' Cup should
implement a weighting system of its
own, which ensures that programs are
not punished simply for a relative lack
of size. Unlike the Capital One Cup's
arbitrary weighting system, sports
should be weighted in the Directors'
Cup by how many Division I pro
grams exist in that sport. Being the
best team out of almost 300 D-I men's
basketball programs should count
more than winning in water polo,
which is played almost exclusively on
the West Coast. Stanford gets a good
number of points from gymnastics,
and though the Cardinal wins cham
pionships in the sport regularly, there
aren't as many men's gymnastics
teams in the country as there are
teams that make the NCA A women's

basketball tournament.
Stanford would, of course, still
have an excellent chance of winning
the Directors' Cup for every year
from now until the apocalypse. How
ever, its victory will be even stronger
when our competition knows it does
n't come from sheer size.

Kabir Sawhney wants to tell you about
the sheer size of his "program." Find
