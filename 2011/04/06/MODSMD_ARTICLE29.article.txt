# Correction

### 
This correction relates to an Apr.
5 article entitled "University rejects
Kappa Sigma appeal." In a memo
randum, Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman incorrectly
stated that the current Kappa Sigma
house is located at 1025 Campus
Drive. In fact, the house is situated at
1035 Campus Drive.
