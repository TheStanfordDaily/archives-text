# Steinman receives lifetime achievement award
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Neurology professor Lawrence
Steinman won the 2011 Multiple
Sclerosis International Federation
Charcot Award, a biennial award that
honors lifetime achievement in multi
ple sclerosis research. Steinman
earned recognition for transferring
knowledge from molecular analysis
to licensed therapy.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an in
flammatory disease that damages the
myelin sheath around the axons of
the brain and spinal cord, making it
difficult for the axons to conduct sig
nals. While some treatments exist, the
prognosis is difficult to predict and
much remains unknown about the
disease.
Steinman's research studies the
mechanisms of the disease's relapse
and remission by identifying and
characterizing genes that regulate in
flammation in the brain, and devel
oping new therapies that modulate
the immune system.
The prize comes with a cash
award of $2,500 and will be presented
in Amsterdam at the annual Euro
pean Committee for Treatment and
Research in Multiple Sclerosis.
