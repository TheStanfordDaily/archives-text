## SOCC explains candidate endorsement process 
### BILLY GALLAGHER STAFF WRITER 
During ASSU elections season, many
campus groups endorse candidates in
order to sway voters. In recent years,
none of these endorsing groups have
been as successful or active as the Stu
dents of Color Coalition (SOCC).
Last year, 10 out of 12 SOCC-en
dorsed candidates were elected to the
12th Undergraduate Senate. The last two
years that SOCC supported an executive
slate, Cardona/Wharton in 2010 and
Avula/Jones in 2007, that slate was victo
rious.
Candidates, current and former
ASSU Senators and Executives and the
SOCC leadership sat down with The
Daily to shed light on the process behind
the SOCC endorsement.
The Coalition
SOCC is a coalition of six groups: the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student Union
(BSU), Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN), the
National Association for the Advance

ment of Colored People (NAACP) and
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion (SAIO).
"The coalition of SOCC was created
to have a unifying political voice for all six
of these groups," said Yvorn Aswad-
Thomas'll,BSU co-president.
Aswad-Thomas said the six groups
collaborate informally throughout the
year and are almost exclusively formally
active as SOCC during the ASSU elec
tions season.
Aswad-Thomas and SOCC Liaison
Uq Chapa 'lO were both SOCC-en
dorsed candidates elected to the 10th
Undergraduate Senate. Chapa explained
that the subgroups send a total of 30 lead
ers to SOCC for the elections decisions.
With 15 endorsed candidates this
year, SOCC could potentially sweep the
Senate. SOCC has endorsed incumbent
Rafael Vazquez 'l2, Brianna Pang 'l3,
Samar Alqatari 'l4, Dan Ashton 'l4, lan
Chan 'l4, Shawn Dye 'l4, Lily Fu 'l4,
Nate Garcia 'l4, Alex Kindel 'l4, Karl
Kumodzi *l4, JR Lesansee 'l4, Anna Nti-
Asare 'l4, Janani Ramachandran 'l4,
Byron Shorty 'l4 andTaraTrujillo 'l4.
SOCC has given its support to
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis 'l3 for Executive.
SOCC is also asking the members of
its communities to vote to abstain on
Measure A.
"We only pick students that will be
effective SOCC Senators," Aswad-
Thomas said. "There is no ideal magic
number. Had it been the case this year
that we only found five candidates to
have what it takes to represent the is
sues that our communities care about,
then we would have only picked five."
"That number really reflects who
we have faith in," he said.
The SOCC Interview Process
This year, about 30 of 41 Under
graduate Senate candidates applied
for SOCC endorsement. Chapa said a
majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical year.
Candidates who wish to be consid
ered for endorsement were asked to
fill out an application by Feb. 26 at
midnight. The application asked for
basic information as well as questions
about candidates' past involvement in
communities of color. It also sought
information on how candidates in
tended to remain aware of issues af
fecting communities of color and

goals that the candidates would try to
accomplish to address these issues.
Candidates were interviewed the
week of March 1 by a mix of SOCC
leadership at the community centers.
"They want to know what we want
to accomplish during the next year
and how we can work with communi
ty centers," said Namir Shah 'l4, a cur
rent candidate for Undergraduate
Senate. "And obviously they want to
make sure that our interests align with
theirs and that we will be effective
representatives of them."
This idea was demonstrated dur
ing SOCC interviews when potential
endorsees were asked how they
would vote on important issues. Miles
Seiver 'l4, another candidate, said he
was asked whether he would vote yes
for a Muslim community center.
Some hot button issues on campus,
such as Measure A, were not dis
cussed during the interviews.
Aswad-Thomas said all six groups
of SOCC have an equal say in choos
ing candidates to endorse; rather than
having a formal voting process SOCC
leaders deliberate until they reach a
consensus.
Most candidates were notified on
the last day of spring break, March 27,
if they did or did not receive the en
dorsement.

Rocking the Vote
Chapa stressed SOCC's connec
tion to a large community of people as
their most useful campaign tool.

"We think talking to people is the
most effective way to campaign," he
said.
According to Chapa, "other coali
tions are able to buy Facebook ads
and banners" whereas SOCC is not.
However, he believes that this is not
the most effective strategy for candi
dates.
"A lot of candidates are stressed
moneywise so when we say invest
ment we mean time and energy and
people," he said.
SOCC holds events for its en
dorsed candidates to meet members
of their communities and helps candi
dates by putting up fliers.
Shelley Gao 'll, who chaired the
10th Undergraduate Senate after
being SOCC-endorsed and served on
the 11th Undergraduate Senate after
not receiving the SOCC endorse
ment for her reelection campaign,
said the most important thing SOCC
does is getting its community mem
bers to vote in vast numbers. Gao cur
rently serves on The Daily's Board of
Directors.
"They do a very targeted method,"
Gao said. "They know who they rep
resent and they know that their con
stituency really believes in SOCC's
endorsements. They send out emails
to community lists like Diaspora and
say, 'Well these are our endorsed can
didates, they support our values and
our agenda and you should just vote
down the line for them.' And it really
works."

Gao pointed out that the combina
tion of SOCC galvanizing its commu
nity members to vote and many other
students not voting or take the
process seriously contributes to
SOCC's success in elections.
Meetings after Elections
Gao said one or two days after
the elections results were an
nounced for the 10th Undergradu
ate Senate, the SOCC leadership ran
a meeting with the newly elected
SOCC Senators discussing strate
gies to get them into leadership posi
tions like the Senate chair. Senate
deputy chair and Appropriations
committee chair.
Will Seaton 'l3, a current Senator,
noted that SOCC Senators capital
ized on their majority to capture
many of the leadership positions.
Seaton is also a Daily staff writer.
Chapa stressed education to
SOCC candidates and Senators as the
most important objective, never forc
ing them to vote one way.
"We've never said, "There's this
question. You have to vote this way,'"
Chapa said.
Gao noted that she thinks it's very
natural for any interest group to put
its people in leadership positions.

A Solution?
While Gao believes that SOCC is
a "legitimate group," she sees the need
for other interest groups representing
various student viewpoints.

"It becomes very unhealthy for
our democratic process when you
only have one very large group domi
nating elections and channeling peo
ple into the Senate or executive who
will obviously be much more favor
able to their agenda," Gao said.
Seaton acknowledged that SOCC
"has been extremely effective in
bringing out their constituents and in
getting their people elected."
This, however, comes with its own
complications.
"For the ASSU and student gov
ernment in general, it gets to the point
where at times it almost feels like the
SOCC leadership two or three or
four individuals are kind of choos
ing the Senate for the next year,"
Seaton said.
"Some time in the next few years I
think it would be very beneficial to
ASSU and student government for
the endorsement process to be ana
lyzed," he added. "Just in terms of con
sidering the viability of the organiza
tion and making sure particular
groups on campus don't dominate the
discussion too much."

Stephen Trusheim 'l3 said there are
no current policies in place to regulate
endorsements.

Gao pointed out that the combina

students not voting or take the
process seriously contributes to
SOCC's success in elections.
Meetings after Elections
Gao said one or two days after
the elections results were an

a meeting with the newly elected
SOCC Senators discussing strate

deputy chair and Appropriations
committee chair.
Will Seaton 'l3, a current Senator,
noted that SOCC Senators capital

many of the leadership positions.
Seaton is also a Daily staff writer.
Chapa stressed education to
SOCC candidates and Senators as the
most important objective, never forc

"We've never said, "There's this
question. You have to vote this way,'"
Chapa said.
Gao noted that she thinks it's very
natural for any interest group to put
its people in leadership positions.

A Solution?
While Gao believes that SOCC is
a "legitimate group," she sees the need
for other interest groups representing
various student viewpoints.

"It becomes very unhealthy for
our democratic process when you
only have one very large group domi
nating elections and channeling peo
ple into the Senate or executive who
will obviously be much more favor
able to their agenda," Gao said.
Seaton acknowledged that SOCC
"has been extremely effective in
bringing out their constituents and in
getting their people elected."
This, however, comes with its own
complications.
"For the ASSU and student gov

During ASSU elections season, many
campus groups endorse candidates in
order to sway voters. In recent years,
none of these endorsing groups have
been as successful or active as the Stu
dents of Color Coalition (SOCC).
Last year, 10 out of 12 SOCC-en
dorsed candidates were elected to the
12th Undergraduate Senate. The last two
years that SOCC supported an executive
slate, Cardona/Wharton in 2010 and
Avula/Jones in 2007, that slate was victo
rious.
Candidates, current and former
ASSU Senators and Executives and the
SOCC leadership sat down with The
Daily to shed light on the process behind
the SOCC endorsement.
The Coalition
SOCC is a coalition of six groups: the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student Union
(BSU), Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN), the
National Association for the Advance

ment of Colored People (NAACP) and
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion (SAIO).
"The coalition of SOCC was created
to have a unifying political voice for all six
of these groups," said Yvorn Aswad-
Thomas'll,BSU co-president.
Aswad-Thomas said the six groups
collaborate informally throughout the
year and are almost exclusively formally
active as SOCC during the ASSU elec
tions season.
Aswad-Thomas and SOCC Liaison
Uq Chapa 'lO were both SOCC-en
dorsed candidates elected to the 10th
Undergraduate Senate. Chapa explained
that the subgroups send a total of 30 lead
ers to SOCC for the elections decisions.
With 15 endorsed candidates this
year, SOCC could potentially sweep the
Senate. SOCC has endorsed incumbent
Rafael Vazquez 'l2, Brianna Pang 'l3,
Samar Alqatari 'l4, Dan Ashton 'l4, lan
Chan 'l4, Shawn Dye 'l4, Lily Fu 'l4,
Nate Garcia 'l4, Alex Kindel 'l4, Karl
Kumodzi *l4, JR Lesansee 'l4, Anna Nti-
Asare 'l4, Janani Ramachandran 'l4,
Byron Shorty 'l4 andTaraTrujillo 'l4.
SOCC has given its support to
Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis 'l3 for Executive.
SOCC is also asking the members of
its communities to vote to abstain on
Measure A.
"We only pick students that will be
effective SOCC Senators," Aswad-
Thomas said. "There is no ideal magic
number. Had it been the case this year
that we only found five candidates to
have what it takes to represent the is
sues that our communities care about,
then we would have only picked five."
"That number really reflects who
we have faith in," he said.
The SOCC Interview Process
This year, about 30 of 41 Under
graduate Senate candidates applied
for SOCC endorsement. Chapa said a
majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical year.
Candidates who wish to be consid
ered for endorsement were asked to
fill out an application by Feb. 26 at
midnight. The application asked for
basic information as well as questions
about candidates' past involvement in
communities of color. It also sought
information on how candidates in
tended to remain aware of issues af
fecting communities of color and

goals that the candidates would try to
accomplish to address these issues.
Candidates were interviewed the
week of March 1 by a mix of SOCC
leadership at the community centers.
"They want to know what we want
to accomplish during the next year
and how we can work with communi
ty centers," said Namir Shah 'l4, a cur
rent candidate for Undergraduate
Senate. "And obviously they want to
make sure that our interests align with
theirs and that we will be effective
representatives of them."
This idea was demonstrated dur
ing SOCC interviews when potential
endorsees were asked how they
would vote on important issues. Miles
Seiver 'l4, another candidate, said he
was asked whether he would vote yes
for a Muslim community center.
Some hot button issues on campus,
such as Measure A, were not dis
cussed during the interviews.
Aswad-Thomas said all six groups
of SOCC have an equal say in choos
ing candidates to endorse; rather than
having a formal voting process SOCC
leaders deliberate until they reach a
consensus.
Most candidates were notified on
the last day of spring break, March 27,
if they did or did not receive the en
dorsement.

Rocking the Vote
Chapa stressed SOCC's connec
tion to a large community of people as
their most useful campaign tool.

"We think talking to people is the
most effective way to campaign," he
said.
According to Chapa, "other coali
tions are able to buy Facebook ads
and banners" whereas SOCC is not.
However, he believes that this is not
the most effective strategy for candi
dates.
"A lot of candidates are stressed
moneywise so when we say invest
ment we mean time and energy and
people," he said.
SOCC holds events for its en
dorsed candidates to meet members
of their communities and helps candi
dates by putting up fliers.
Shelley Gao 'll, who chaired the
10th Undergraduate Senate after
being SOCC-endorsed and served on
the 11th Undergraduate Senate after
not receiving the SOCC endorse
ment for her reelection campaign,
said the most important thing SOCC
does is getting its community mem
bers to vote in vast numbers. Gao cur
rently serves on The Daily's Board of
Directors.
"They do a very targeted method,"
Gao said. "They know who they rep
resent and they know that their con
stituency really believes in SOCC's
endorsements. They send out emails
to community lists like Diaspora and
say, 'Well these are our endorsed can
didates, they support our values and
our agenda and you should just vote
down the line for them.' And it really
