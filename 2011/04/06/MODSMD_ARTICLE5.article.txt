## SOCC explains candidate endorsement process 
### BILLY GALLAGHER STAFF WRITER 
During ASSU elections season, many
campus groups endorse candidates in
order to sway voters. In recent years,
none of these endorsing groups have
been as successful or active as the Stu
dents of Color Coalition (SOCC).
Last year, 10 out of 12 SOCC-en
dorsed candidates were elected to the
12th Undergraduate Senate. The last two
years that SOCC supported an executive
slate, Cardona/Wharton in 2010 and
Avula/Jones in 2007, that slate was victo
rious.
Candidates, current and former
ASSU Senators and Executives and the
SOCC leadership sat down with The
Daily to shed light on the process behind
the SOCC endorsement.
The Coalition
SOCC is a coalition of six groups: the
Asian American Students' Association
(AASA), the Black Student Union
(BSU), Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChA), the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network (MSAN), the
National Association for the Advance

ment of Colored People (NAACP) and
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion (SAIO).
"The coalition of SOCC was created
to have a unifying political voice for all six
of these groups," said Yvorn Aswad-
Thomas'll,BSU co-president.
Aswad-Thomas said the six groups
collaborate informally throughout the
year and are almost exclusively formally
active as SOCC during the ASSU elec
tions season.
Aswad-Thomas and SOCC Liaison
Uq Chapa 'lO were both SOCC-en
dorsed candidates elected to the 10th
Undergraduate Senate. Chapa explained
that the subgroups send a total of 30 lead
ers to SOCC for the elections decisions.
With 15 endorsed candidates this
year, SOCC could potentially sweep the
Senate. SOCC has endorsed incumbent
Rafael Vazquez 'l2, Brianna Pang 'l3,
Samar Alqatari 'l4, Dan Ashton 'l4, lan
Chan 'l4, Shawn Dye 'l4, Lily Fu 'l4,
Nate Garcia 'l4, Alex Kindel 'l4, Karl
Kumodzi *l4, JR Lesansee 'l4, Anna Nti-
Asare 'l4, Janani Ramachandran 'l4,
