# Senate hears "Opposition to ROTC" bill
## With advisory question looming, Senate takes action on ROTC 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
The Undergraduate Senate passed a resolution Tuesday op
posing the discriminatory policies of ROTC in an effort to edu
cate the student body.
After reaching the required number of eight senators to have
quorum, the Undergraduate Senate started its meeting several
minutes late, with Senators Ben Jensen 'l2 and Carolyn Simmons
'l3 joining the meeting from their study abroad locations via
Skype.
Before the ROTC discussion, all funding bills for the evening
were passed, and Publications Board Director Alice Nam'll and
assistant director Zachary Warma 'll discussed plans to create a
publications media center on the second floor of the Nitery for
use by all campus publications next year. Nam also put a bill on
previous notice to redefine the role of the Publications Board di
rector for next year, which will be debated for next week.
"We want to rethink how publications are funded on campus
since a lot of them seeking out special fees," Warma, a former
Daily staff member, said. "We would like for our publications to
have the best papers, the best layouts possible and we sit on a sig
nificant amount of money to do that.
"The Publications Board wants to expand its institutional
presence, teach classes and be the driving force for a more vibrant
publications culture on campus," he added.
Nam also addressed the pending petition to bring a case to the
Constitutional Council against the appointment of Warma to the
Publications Board, which has yet to be accepted.
"I don't see how I'm able to do my job currently because I'm
supposed to propose a funding bill that The Claw is a part of, so it
needs to be proposed by a different director," Nam, who is the ed
itor in chief of literary magazine The Claw, said. "This bill would
help fix that."
The main discussion of the night centered on a bill proposed
by Senator Robin Perani 'l3 and Senate Associate Alex Kindal
'l4, titled "Resolution in Opposition to the Return of ROTC to
Stanford University." Kindal was not present for the proceeding
discussion about the bill.
The original bill, which was later replaced, cited an obligation
to protect the interests of all students, including transgender stu
dents, but voiced support for current ROTC cadets who partici
pate in off-campus programs. It therefore opposed the return of
ROTC in accordance with the University's nondiscrimination
policy.
Debate over the bill lasted for almost three hours as Senators
discussed the language, the technicalities of the nondiscrimina
tion policy and the intent behind passing such a resolution. Mem
bers representing the LGBT community and Stanford Students
for Queer Liberation (SSQL) were present as part of the open
forum.
Perani said that she felt it was the duty of the ASSU to protect
minority groups' rights, and therefore take a firm stance on the
ROTC issue.
"[Transgender students] can't
serve openly, so ROTC will still vi
olate the University nondiscrimi
nation policy, and while DADT has
been repealed, it has not been im
plemented yet," she said. "The way
we have ROTC now, people can be
involved, just off campus. We are
representing them by voicing our
support for them off campus, but
because the military discriminates
against sexual orientation and not
on any rational basis, we can't
allow it."
Both Warma and Senator Re
becca Sachs 'l3 expressed concerns
with the bill as proposed.
"I think having Stanford stu
dents participating in ROTC and
being able to have a dialogue on
campus adds a very positive value,"
Warma said during open forum. "If
the ASSU is supposed to represent
all students, regardless of the size of
the group, the ASSU has to hear all
voices and that cuts both ways. I
don't think there's a place, particu
larly with the election coming up,
for you to be weighing in on this.
There's a chance for transgender
students and their allies, and
ROTC cadets and their allies to
weigh in ... but I don't think this is
something this body should be in
jecting itself into."
"The issue I see is that the stu
dent body is going to be voting this,
if the student body has the oppor
tunity to voice their opinion and
their opinion should be held over
ours ... We should not speak for
them when they have the opportu

nity to speak for themselves," Sachs
said.
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 said that she
believed this was away for the Sen
ate to show that the "nondiscrimi
nation policy has teeth."
"I have to wonder what Stan
ford's values are if it wants to bring
back an institution that discrimi
nates blatantly against transgender
students, and people disabled men
tally and physically ... that seems
really flawed to me," she said. "This
is not about trans students versus
military students; this is a basic
issue of upholding the nondiscrim
ination policy."
Army ROTC cadet Jimmy
Ruck 'll was also present to dis
cuss his experience in the ROTC
program, and clarified that trans
gender students would be able to
participate in ROTC courses of
fered at Stanford. He also men
tioned that discrimination within
ROTC stems from federal policy.
"The military is under the subor
dination of the civilian leadership
of this country, it's a federal issue
more so than a Stanford issue,"
Ruck said.
After Senator Will Seaton 'l3
voiced discomfort with the bill as it
currently stood, Senator Pat Bruny
'l3 suggested changing the lan
guage of the bill to specifically state
opposition to the discrimination
perpetuated by the ROTC pro
gram, and not against the program
itself.

During this debate. Fetter chid
ed the Senate for not taking a
stronger stance against ROTC.
"[The revision] is another sym
bolic gesture where you can pass a
bill that doesn't say anything," she
said. "Be strong, be Senators, or else

this seems to be like a lot of political
bullshit."
After Senate Chair Madeline
Hawes 'l3 called for a recess, the re
maining Senators drafted a new
resolution with consultation from
members of the open forum titled,
"Resolution to Acknowledge and
Oppose the Discriminatory Nature
of ROTC's Policies." The new bill,
which did not include the original
support for off-campus ROTC pro
grams, was passed unanimously by
the nine senators present.
"Students should know that
what we've passed now, which is op
posing the discriminatory policies
of ROTC, is very different from
what the students will be voting on
Thursday and Friday, which is to
support or oppose the return of
ROTC," Senator Khaled Alshawi
'l3 said.
"In terms of support or not sup
porting the return of ROTC, the
Senate is not taking a stance,"
Bruny said following the vote.
"We're just saying we oppose the
policies of the program that violate
the nondiscrimination policy that
the University has set forth."

if the student body has the oppor
tunity to voice their opinion and
their opinion should be held over
ours ... We should not speak for
them when they have the opportu

nity to speak for themselves," Sachs
said.
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 said that she
believed this was away for the Sen
ate to show that the "nondiscrimi
nation policy has teeth."
"I have to wonder what Stan
ford's values are if it wants to bring
back an institution that discrimi
nates blatantly against transgender
students, and people disabled men
tally and physically ... that seems
really flawed to me," she said. "This
is not about trans students versus
military students; this is a basic
issue of upholding the nondiscrim
ination policy."
Army ROTC cadet Jimmy
Ruck 'll was also present to dis
cuss his experience in the ROTC
program, and clarified that trans
gender students would be able to
participate in ROTC courses of
fered at Stanford. He also men
tioned that discrimination within
ROTC stems from federal policy.
"The military is under the subor
dination of the civilian leadership
of this country, it's a federal issue
more so than a Stanford issue,"
Ruck said.
After Senator Will Seaton 'l3
voiced discomfort with the bill as it
currently stood, Senator Pat Bruny
'l3 suggested changing the lan
guage of the bill to specifically state
opposition to the discrimination
perpetuated by the ROTC pro
gram, and not against the program
itself.

During this debate. Fetter chid
ed the Senate for not taking a
stronger stance against ROTC.
"[The revision] is another sym
bolic gesture where you can pass a
bill that doesn't say anything," she
said. "Be strong, be Senators, or else

this seems to be like a lot of political
bullshit."
After Senate Chair Madeline
Hawes 'l3 called for a recess, the re
maining Senators drafted a new
resolution with consultation from
members of the open forum titled,
"Resolution to Acknowledge and
Oppose the Discriminatory Nature
of ROTC's Policies." The new bill,
which did not include the original
support for off-campus ROTC pro
grams, was passed unanimously by
the nine senators present.
"Students should know that
what we've passed now, which is op
posing the discriminatory policies
of ROTC, is very different from
what the students will be voting on
Thursday and Friday, which is to
support or oppose the return of
ROTC," Senator Khaled Alshawi
'l3 said.
"In terms of support or not sup
porting the return of ROTC, the
Senate is not taking a stance,"
Bruny said following the vote.
"We're just saying we oppose the
policies of the program that violate
the nondiscrimination policy that
the University has set forth."

The Undergraduate Senate passed a resolution Tuesday op
posing the discriminatory policies of ROTC in an effort to edu
cate the student body.
After reaching the required number of eight senators to have
quorum, the Undergraduate Senate started its meeting several
minutes late, with Senators Ben Jensen 'l2 and Carolyn Simmons
'l3 joining the meeting from their study abroad locations via
Skype.
Before the ROTC discussion, all funding bills for the evening
were passed, and Publications Board Director Alice Nam'll and
assistant director Zachary Warma 'll discussed plans to create a
publications media center on the second floor of the Nitery for
use by all campus publications next year. Nam also put a bill on
previous notice to redefine the role of the Publications Board di
rector for next year, which will be debated for next week.
"We want to rethink how publications are funded on campus
since a lot of them seeking out special fees," Warma, a former
Daily staff member, said. "We would like for our publications to
have the best papers, the best layouts possible and we sit on a sig
nificant amount of money to do that.
"The Publications Board wants to expand its institutional
presence, teach classes and be the driving force for a more vibrant
publications culture on campus," he added.
Nam also addressed the pending petition to bring a case to the
Constitutional Council against the appointment of Warma to the
Publications Board, which has yet to be accepted.
"I don't see how I'm able to do my job currently because I'm
supposed to propose a funding bill that The Claw is a part of, so it
needs to be proposed by a different director," Nam, who is the ed
itor in chief of literary magazine The Claw, said. "This bill would
help fix that."
The main discussion of the night centered on a bill proposed
by Senator Robin Perani 'l3 and Senate Associate Alex Kindal
'l4, titled "Resolution in Opposition to the Return of ROTC to
Stanford University." Kindal was not present for the proceeding
discussion about the bill.
The original bill, which was later replaced, cited an obligation
to protect the interests of all students, including transgender stu
dents, but voiced support for current ROTC cadets who partici
pate in off-campus programs. It therefore opposed the return of
ROTC in accordance with the University's nondiscrimination
policy.
Debate over the bill lasted for almost three hours as Senators
discussed the language, the technicalities of the nondiscrimina
tion policy and the intent behind passing such a resolution. Mem
bers representing the LGBT community and Stanford Students
for Queer Liberation (SSQL) were present as part of the open
forum.
Perani said that she felt it was the duty of the ASSU to protect
minority groups' rights, and therefore take a firm stance on the
ROTC issue.
"[Transgender students] can't
serve openly, so ROTC will still vi
olate the University nondiscrimi
nation policy, and while DADT has
been repealed, it has not been im
plemented yet," she said. "The way
we have ROTC now, people can be
involved, just off campus. We are
representing them by voicing our
support for them off campus, but
because the military discriminates
against sexual orientation and not
on any rational basis, we can't
allow it."
Both Warma and Senator Re
becca Sachs 'l3 expressed concerns
with the bill as proposed.
"I think having Stanford stu
dents participating in ROTC and
being able to have a dialogue on
campus adds a very positive value,"
Warma said during open forum. "If
the ASSU is supposed to represent
all students, regardless of the size of
the group, the ASSU has to hear all
voices and that cuts both ways. I
don't think there's a place, particu
larly with the election coming up,
for you to be weighing in on this.
There's a chance for transgender
students and their allies, and
ROTC cadets and their allies to
weigh in ... but I don't think this is
something this body should be in
jecting itself into."
"The issue I see is that the stu
dent body is going to be voting this,
