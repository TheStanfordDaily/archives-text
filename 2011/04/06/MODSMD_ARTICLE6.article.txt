# Senate hears "Opposition to ROTC" bill
## With advisory question looming, Senate takes action on ROTC 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
The Undergraduate Senate passed a resolution Tuesday op
posing the discriminatory policies of ROTC in an effort to edu
cate the student body.
After reaching the required number of eight senators to have
quorum, the Undergraduate Senate started its meeting several
minutes late, with Senators Ben Jensen 'l2 and Carolyn Simmons
'l3 joining the meeting from their study abroad locations via
Skype.
Before the ROTC discussion, all funding bills for the evening
were passed, and Publications Board Director Alice Nam'll and
assistant director Zachary Warma 'll discussed plans to create a
publications media center on the second floor of the Nitery for
use by all campus publications next year. Nam also put a bill on
previous notice to redefine the role of the Publications Board di
rector for next year, which will be debated for next week.
"We want to rethink how publications are funded on campus
since a lot of them seeking out special fees," Warma, a former
Daily staff member, said. "We would like for our publications to
have the best papers, the best layouts possible and we sit on a sig
nificant amount of money to do that.
"The Publications Board wants to expand its institutional
presence, teach classes and be the driving force for a more vibrant
publications culture on campus," he added.
Nam also addressed the pending petition to bring a case to the
Constitutional Council against the appointment of Warma to the
Publications Board, which has yet to be accepted.
"I don't see how I'm able to do my job currently because I'm
supposed to propose a funding bill that The Claw is a part of, so it
needs to be proposed by a different director," Nam, who is the ed
itor in chief of literary magazine The Claw, said. "This bill would
help fix that."
The main discussion of the night centered on a bill proposed
by Senator Robin Perani 'l3 and Senate Associate Alex Kindal
'l4, titled "Resolution in Opposition to the Return of ROTC to
Stanford University." Kindal was not present for the proceeding
discussion about the bill.
The original bill, which was later replaced, cited an obligation
to protect the interests of all students, including transgender stu
dents, but voiced support for current ROTC cadets who partici
pate in off-campus programs. It therefore opposed the return of
ROTC in accordance with the University's nondiscrimination
policy.
Debate over the bill lasted for almost three hours as Senators
discussed the language, the technicalities of the nondiscrimina
tion policy and the intent behind passing such a resolution. Mem
bers representing the LGBT community and Stanford Students
for Queer Liberation (SSQL) were present as part of the open
forum.
Perani said that she felt it was the duty of the ASSU to protect
minority groups' rights, and therefore take a firm stance on the
ROTC issue.
