## ASSU Executive slates spar at Tuesday's CoHo debate 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the ASSU general election a few
days away, voters got a final chance to see
all three slates running for ASSU Execu
tive in a debate last night at the CoHo.The
debate was co-sponsored by The Stanford
Daily, The Stanford Review and Stanford
in Government and moderated by Daily
Deputy Editor Kate Abbott 'l2 and Re
view Editor-in-Chief Autumn Carter 'll.
Questions came from the moderators
themselves and from voters who submit
ted queries in advance.
All three slates Cruz/Macgregor-
Dennis, Seldon/Vasquez and
Hertz/Coggeshall repeated many of
the points published in their platforms
throughout the campaign.
In their opening statement,Tenzin Sel
don' 12 and Joe Vasquez' 11 came out with
their two main initiatives: "bridging the
gap" between various communities on
campus and a fresh focus on mental
health among the student body. On the
opposing side, Michael Cruz' 12 and Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 emphasized
the theme of their campaign, "Stanford

2.0," and discussed their desire to partner
with student groups and bring an entre
preneurial mindset to the ASSU. Alex
Hertz 'l3 and Sam Coggeshall 'l2, run
ning as the Stanford Chaparral-backed
slate, talked about the need for a more
physically healthy student body.
The debate then moved to questions,
where substantive differences emerged
between the Seldon/Vasquez and
Cruz/Macgregor-Dennis slates. Both
campaigns, however, struck similar notes
at the beginning of the debate when they
explained what they believed was the
most pressing issue facing Stanford stu
dents.
"If there was one issue we could tack
le, I think we would tackle this issue of
connectiveness and community at Stan
ford," Cruz said. "It seems like a lot of stu
dents have this 'Stanford Duck Syn
drome' that all of us have heard about,
this idea that wellness isn't here at Stan
ford."
"Joe and I also believe that the most
important issue concerning our student
body right now is mental health and well-

ness," Seldon said. "It is still heavily
stigmatized on this campus."
Seldon detailed several initiatives
she planned to enact around mental
health if elected, including a push for
changes to resident assistant (RA)
training, expanded utilization of exist
ing mental health resources and more
courses on the topic of "happiness."
Two of the most contentious is
sues at the debate were each slate's
stance on the ROTC advisory ques
tion and their plans to effectively
communicate and engage with the
general student population. With re
spect to student engagement, Seldon
and Vasquez both emphasized mak
ing personal connections with as
many students as possible via dorm
meetings, office hours and regular
meetings with student group leaders.
Macgregor-Dennis' approach was
starkly different; he detailed plans

for the Executive to connect to stu
dents using technology, including a
fully revamped ASSU website and
an iPhone app.
The two slates clashed sharply on
the ROTC advisory question. Cruz
and Macgregor-Dennis aligned
themselves with the "Campaign to
Abstain," a movement to influence
students to vote abstain on the refer
endum.
"It really comes down to the fact
that there's a marginalized commu
nity and a discriminated-against
community," Macgregor-Dennis
said. "Really, if we're voting on these
civil-rights issues, then we're voting
on civil-rights issues for both the
marginalized and the discriminated
against. We stand up for both these
communities and that's why we're
fully in support of the abstain cam
paign."
Seldon and Vasquez declined to
take a position on the issue, saying
they belie ve the role of the Executive
is to allow space for all viewpoints to
be heard.
"We have to make sure that, as

student representatives, we listen to
all sides of the issue," Seldon said.
"There's a large contingent of the
student body population on both
sides of the issue," Vasquez added.
"By taking a very partisan approach
and choosing one side of the issue,
you're potentially marginalizing and
just creating an even bigger divide."
The debate concluded after each
slate was allowed to give a closing
statement. In their final words,
Cruz/Macgregor-Dennis promoted
the bridging of the ASSU with entre
preneurship and public service, while
Seldon/Vasquez explained their pas
sion and commitment to achieve the
goals delineated in their platform.
After a final burst of campaign
ing, the polls for the ASSU election
will open on Thursday at 12:01 a.m.
and close on Friday at 11:59 p.m. Vot
ers can cast their ballots at
ballot.stanford.edu. Results for all
races will be announced on Saturday
at 5 p.m. at the CoHo.
