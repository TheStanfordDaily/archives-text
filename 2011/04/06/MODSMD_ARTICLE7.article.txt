## ASSU Executive slates spar at Tuesday's CoHo debate 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the ASSU general election a few
days away, voters got a final chance to see
all three slates running for ASSU Execu
tive in a debate last night at the CoHo.The
debate was co-sponsored by The Stanford
Daily, The Stanford Review and Stanford
in Government and moderated by Daily
Deputy Editor Kate Abbott 'l2 and Re
view Editor-in-Chief Autumn Carter 'll.
Questions came from the moderators
themselves and from voters who submit
ted queries in advance.
All three slates Cruz/Macgregor-
Dennis, Seldon/Vasquez and
Hertz/Coggeshall repeated many of
the points published in their platforms
throughout the campaign.
In their opening statement,Tenzin Sel

their two main initiatives: "bridging the
gap" between various communities on
campus and a fresh focus on mental
health among the student body. On the
opposing side, Michael Cruz' 12 and Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 emphasized
the theme of their campaign, "Stanford

2.0," and discussed their desire to partner
with student groups and bring an entre
preneurial mindset to the ASSU. Alex
Hertz 'l3 and Sam Coggeshall 'l2, run
ning as the Stanford Chaparral-backed
slate, talked about the need for a more
physically healthy student body.
The debate then moved to questions,
where substantive differences emerged
between the Seldon/Vasquez and
Cruz/Macgregor-Dennis slates. Both
campaigns, however, struck similar notes
at the beginning of the debate when they
explained what they believed was the
most pressing issue facing Stanford stu
dents.
"If there was one issue we could tack
le, I think we would tackle this issue of
connectiveness and community at Stan
ford," Cruz said. "It seems like a lot of stu
dents have this 'Stanford Duck Syn
drome' that all of us have heard about,
this idea that wellness isn't here at Stan
ford."
"Joe and I also believe that the most
important issue concerning our student
body right now is mental health and well-
