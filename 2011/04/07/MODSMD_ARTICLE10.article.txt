## Campus reacts to proposed MCAT changes 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last Thursday, an advisory panel appointed by the
Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)
released its recommendations for a new version of the
Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT. The panel's
proposed changes include eliminating the writing sec
tion of the test and adding a social science section.
The advisory panel, dubbed the "MRS Commit
tee," developed its recommendations after three
years of research and an analysis of 2,700 surveys
from undergraduate and medical school faculty and
students. If approved by the AAMC, the changes
would be introduced in the 2015 MCAT, 25 years after
the last series of major revisions to the test.
The proposed MCAT would include four sections.
The first two are slated to be natural science sections

largely derived from the cur
rent format. The verbal section would give way to a
critical analysis and reasoning section, while a behav
ioral and social science section would take the place
of the writing section.
The panel tailored its proposal to reflect what it
considers to be changing face of medicine.
"You do need a solid foundation in the sciences,
but you need more than that," Steven Gabbe, MRS
Committee Chair and CEO of the Ohio State Medical
Center, said in an April 1 interview with Inside High
er Ed.
"You need to think critically and reason, and un
derstand the differences in our society and the pa
tients you see as a physician," Gabbe said. "We need
people who are critical thinkers and people who have

sensitivity and understanding of
different cultures."
Dr. Lawrence Shuer, associate
dean of graduate medical educa
tion at the School of Medicine,
said the proposed changes might
encourage a rethinking of the
qualities necessary to be a good
physician.
"We don't just want technicians
or people who are just so into the
sciences that they're not round
enough to know about the human
ities," Shuer said. "Much of being a
physician is being in human con
tact."
Karen Mitchell, senior director
of the MCAT program, noted that
the recommendations reflect the
committee's efforts to ensure fair
testing of groups traditionally un
derrepresented in medicine.
"Questions of fairness have
been at the forefront of the MRS
committee's conversations about
the new exam," Mitchell wrote in
an email to The Daily.
According to Mitchell, one of
the goals of the committee was to
ensure that the new exam tested
material "taught at the same levels

of depth at minority-serving and
other institutions."
In 2010, white students who
took the MCAT received a mean
score of 26, while Latino students
received a mean score of 21.3 and
black students a mean score of
19.7.
The impact that the proposed
MCAT overhaul would have on
premedical education throughout
the U.S. remains unclear, although
Shuer speculates the changes
would encourage students to take
more humanities courses.
"I would surmise that in some
way they're suggesting to prospec
tive medical school applicants that
they not just concentrate in the
sciences," he said.
Hillary Lin 'll, co-president of
the Stanford Premedical Associa
tion, said the proposed changes
would increase the relevancy of
test material but questions the fea
sibility of testing knowledge in the
social sciences.
"Medical schools don't look at
writing samples at all, so it's a good
idea to change it into a more appli
cable section," she said. "At the
same time, how do you make ques
tions that are relevant and testable
in the social sciences? I'm not sure
how they would do it."
Fellow pre-med student Jem
Bautista'll agreed, noting that so

cial science classes are not stan
dardized in the same way chem
istry or biology classes are.
"I think social science is too
broad a subject to test," Bautista
said. "What classes would students
take? There's no such thing as an
Introduction to the Social Sci
ences class."
