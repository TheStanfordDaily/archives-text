## Q&A WITH Q&A For those students who identify as queer and Asian, one group comes out 
### HELEN ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
-- 'd be fine if you came
I out as lesbian," Nay
oung Woo's mother
has told her. "Why
won't you tell me that
you're lesbian?"
"Because I'm not, Mom," Woo
replies. Which, in her case, is true.
Her mother's willingness to ac
cept her daughter's sexuality runs
almost polar opposite to what most
other members of Queer and Ques
tioning Asians and Pacific Islanders
(Q&A) experience.
"I'm like the joke of the group,"
Woo 'l2 said, referring to her
strange familial role-reversal. This is
because in a typical Asian or Asian-
American family, homosexuality is
viewed as unnatural and shameful.
Children are hardly encouraged to
come out to their parents.
Christopher Lee 'l3, for instance,
a Q&A member and a gay rights ac
tivist from Korea, has not yet come
out to his parents about being gay.
Lee said he is more concerned
about how his family would manage
the social stigma that would ensue
with his coming out than how his
parents would react to him person
ally. He emphasized that in Korean
society, the entire family is criticized
even if only one family member is
perceived of having done something
wrong or dishonorable.
The differences between the
queer community in Asia Korea,
in particular and the queer com
munity in the United States was
something that particularly interest
ed Woo. She had this juxtaposition
in mind when she contacted Lee to
ask if she could make a documen
tary about his transition from Korea
to the United States. At the time,
Lee had just been accepted to Stan
ford.
The film, which Woo began
working on the summer after her
freshman year, is now being funded
by the Stanford Institute for Cre
ativity and the Arts (SiCa).
"The documentary's title is
Should Be, Could Be, But Is," Woo
said. '"Should be' as in what the
Asian culture expects you to be, and
then 'could be' as in what the Amer
ican LGBT culture thinks is possible
for everyone, but is. You know, we're
neither. We can't should be, and we
can't could be, so we're just is."
When he moved to the United
States, Lee immediately noticed the
cultural differences that Woo was so
interested in documenting.
"The queer community here em
phasizes coming out," Lee said. "If
you're a gay rights activist, you have
to come out to the whole society.
And you have to come out to your
parents as well. But I think it's the
opposite case in Korea."

Lee noted that while in the Unit
ed States people typically come out
to their parents first, in Korea, it isn't
uncommon for someone to be fully
integrated into the gay community
but still hide their sexual orientation

from parents and friends. And while
terms such as "gay," "queer" and
"LGBT" are commonly understood
in the United States, in Asia, "you
could use the word queer and no
body would know what it means,"
Woo said.
"It's very foreign, the idea of gay
ness, and some parents just take it to
be very westernized," she contin
ued. "So they're like, 'Oh, you go to
school in America and that's why
you got messed up.' Or people think
it's a phase."
Still, in both Asia and America,
there is a similar stigma attached to
being queer and Asian.
"Asian parents invest a lot in
their children," Woo said. As such,
parents expect a return on their in
vestment, so to speak they want
their children to carry on the family
line, a pressure that hits especially
hard for queer Asian men.
Woo spent a portion of her high
school career in the United States,
during which she joined her school's
gay-straight alliance, even though
her parents denounced "these peo
ple" as unnatural, advising her not to
associate with them because "the
bible says it's not okay." However,
Woo said she has been able to
change her parents' prejudices by
telling them stories about her
friends and emphasizing "gay as
people" as opposed to "gay as a con
cept."
This strategy seemed to convince
Woo's mother, who now frequently
expresses understanding for her
daughter's friends. But very few
young Asians have this kind of open
parental relationship.
Concern and confusion about
coming out to parents is essentially
übiquitous in the queer and Asian
community. It's not an issue that
more mainstream LGBT groups ad
dress and, for this reason, has be
come one of Q&A's top priorities.
"We don't start with, 'Let's come
out, how do I do it?" Woo said.
"That's not our question. Is it wise
for me to come out? Will it hurt my
family?... How important are all of
those values, as opposed to my per
sonal identity? Because we have to
deal with a different question, we
need a separate community."
In addition to comfort and ad
vice, the organization provides a
sense of natural belonging for many
members.
"[Q&A] is a place where I don't
have to feel Asian or queer," said
Lee, who didn't originally didn't de
fine himself as "Asian," having come
from a mostly racially homogenous
community. "It's a place where I can
finally just feel like everybody else."
This year, Q&A is expanding its
focus from being solely a support
group to promoting activism and
awareness of the issues faced by the
queer and Asian community. To do
this, they have organized campus
wide events and talked to queer and
Asian organizations at nearby uni
versities. One issue that Lee espe
cially cares about is visibility.

"In general, I think Asians kind
of lack visibility in the media ... in
America," he said. "In movies about
gay people, it's always white people.
So I always thought that being gay
meant you could only be white."
The queer and Asian community
is similarly underground in Korea,
where many people end up getting
married to the opposite gender sim
ply to hide the fact that they're gay.

The ongoing discussion about gay
marriage, Lee said, would seem
wildly radical in Korea. Woo has ob
served similar differences.

"It's not important for some peo
ple to hold up a rainbow flag and say,
'l'm gay, deal with it,"' she said, de
scribing how some of her Korean
friends claim that they will wait
"until their parents are dead" before
they come out completely and some
never intend to come out at all.
Reflecting on Woo's footage thus
far, Lee said he can trace the trans
formation he has experienced over
the past two years. The film shows
the emergence of his new passion

for "this Asian American visibility
issue" and the "lack of ethnic diver
sity within the mainstream gay com
munity."
He also hopes that he can use
what he has learned from his own
exploration to help others.
"I went through an identity crisis,
being like, 'Am I Asian? Should I be
more Asian, or should I be more
queer? Can I not be both?'" Lee re
called. "I'm trying to become this
role model for queer Asian Ameri
cans, because there are so few."

by the Stanford Institute for Cre
ativity and the Arts (SiCa).
"The documentary's title is
Should Be, Could Be, But Is," Woo
said. '"Should be' as in what the
Asian culture expects you to be, and
then 'could be' as in what the Amer
ican LGBT culture thinks is possible
for everyone, but is. You know, we're
neither. We can't should be, and we
can't could be, so we're just is."
When he moved to the United
States, Lee immediately noticed the
cultural differences that Woo was so
interested in documenting.
"The queer community here em
phasizes coming out," Lee said. "If
you're a gay rights activist, you have
to come out to the whole society.
And you have to come out to your
parents as well. But I think it's the
opposite case in Korea."

Lee noted that while in the Unit
ed States people typically come out
to their parents first, in Korea, it isn't
uncommon for someone to be fully
integrated into the gay community
but still hide their sexual orientation

from parents and friends. And while
terms such as "gay," "queer" and
"LGBT" are commonly understood
in the United States, in Asia, "you
could use the word queer and no
body would know what it means,"
Woo said.
"It's very foreign, the idea of gay
ness, and some parents just take it to
be very westernized," she contin
ued. "So they're like, 'Oh, you go to
school in America and that's why
you got messed up.' Or people think
it's a phase."
Still, in both Asia and America,
there is a similar stigma attached to
being queer and Asian.
"Asian parents invest a lot in
their children," Woo said. As such,
parents expect a return on their in
vestment, so to speak they want
their children to carry on the family
line, a pressure that hits especially
hard for queer Asian men.
Woo spent a portion of her high
school career in the United States,
during which she joined her school's
gay-straight alliance, even though
her parents denounced "these peo
ple" as unnatural, advising her not to
associate with them because "the
bible says it's not okay." However,
Woo said she has been able to
change her parents' prejudices by
telling them stories about her
friends and emphasizing "gay as
people" as opposed to "gay as a con
cept."
This strategy seemed to convince
Woo's mother, who now frequently
expresses understanding for her
daughter's friends. But very few
young Asians have this kind of open
parental relationship.
Concern and confusion about
coming out to parents is essentially
übiquitous in the queer and Asian
community. It's not an issue that
more mainstream LGBT groups ad
dress and, for this reason, has be
come one of Q&A's top priorities.
"We don't start with, 'Let's come
out, how do I do it?" Woo said.
"That's not our question. Is it wise
for me to come out? Will it hurt my
family?... How important are all of
those values, as opposed to my per
sonal identity? Because we have to
deal with a different question, we
need a separate community."
In addition to comfort and ad
vice, the organization provides a
sense of natural belonging for many
members.
"[Q&A] is a place where I don't
have to feel Asian or queer," said
Lee, who didn't originally didn't de
fine himself as "Asian," having come
from a mostly racially homogenous
community. "It's a place where I can
finally just feel like everybody else."
This year, Q&A is expanding its
focus from being solely a support
group to promoting activism and
awareness of the issues faced by the
queer and Asian community. To do
this, they have organized campus
wide events and talked to queer and
Asian organizations at nearby uni
versities. One issue that Lee espe
cially cares about is visibility.

"In general, I think Asians kind
of lack visibility in the media ... in
America," he said. "In movies about
gay people, it's always white people.
So I always thought that being gay
meant you could only be white."
The queer and Asian community
is similarly underground in Korea,
where many people end up getting
married to the opposite gender sim
ply to hide the fact that they're gay.

The ongoing discussion about gay
marriage, Lee said, would seem
wildly radical in Korea. Woo has ob
served similar differences.

"It's not important for some peo
ple to hold up a rainbow flag and say,
'l'm gay, deal with it,"' she said, de
scribing how some of her Korean
friends claim that they will wait
"until their parents are dead" before
they come out completely and some
never intend to come out at all.
Reflecting on Woo's footage thus
far, Lee said he can trace the trans
formation he has experienced over
the past two years. The film shows
the emergence of his new passion

for "this Asian American visibility
issue" and the "lack of ethnic diver
sity within the mainstream gay com
munity."
He also hopes that he can use
what he has learned from his own
exploration to help others.
"I went through an identity crisis,
being like, 'Am I Asian? Should I be
more Asian, or should I be more
queer? Can I not be both?'" Lee re
called. "I'm trying to become this
role model for queer Asian Ameri
cans, because there are so few."

-- 'd be fine if you came
I out as lesbian," Nay
oung Woo's mother
has told her. "Why
won't you tell me that
you're lesbian?"
"Because I'm not, Mom," Woo
replies. Which, in her case, is true.
Her mother's willingness to ac
cept her daughter's sexuality runs
almost polar opposite to what most
other members of Queer and Ques
tioning Asians and Pacific Islanders
(Q&A) experience.
"I'm like the joke of the group,"
Woo 'l2 said, referring to her
strange familial role-reversal. This is
because in a typical Asian or Asian-
American family, homosexuality is
viewed as unnatural and shameful.
Children are hardly encouraged to
come out to their parents.
Christopher Lee 'l3, for instance,
a Q&A member and a gay rights ac
tivist from Korea, has not yet come
out to his parents about being gay.
Lee said he is more concerned
about how his family would manage
the social stigma that would ensue
with his coming out than how his
parents would react to him person
ally. He emphasized that in Korean
society, the entire family is criticized
even if only one family member is
perceived of having done something
wrong or dishonorable.
The differences between the
queer community in Asia Korea,
in particular and the queer com
munity in the United States was
something that particularly interest
ed Woo. She had this juxtaposition
in mind when she contacted Lee to
ask if she could make a documen
tary about his transition from Korea
to the United States. At the time,
Lee had just been accepted to Stan
ford.
