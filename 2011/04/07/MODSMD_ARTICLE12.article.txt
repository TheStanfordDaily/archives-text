## SEEING GREEN Beyond the Pail

£ £ ~v~ ook: cereal costs more
than beef, even though
I eat grain," my dad
said.
I was 7, more interested in en
joying our supermarket excursion
(chances to accompany Dad on his
grocery runs diminished sharply
when elementary school began)
than in deciphering his reference
to the imbalance in food prices
driven by government subsidies.
As far as I could tell, cows ate grass
and there wasn't a scrap of grass
(or, in retrospect, anything natural
at all) in my Count Chocula.
But many years later, I heard
the startling claim that "the gov
ernment pays dairy farmers to
pour milk down the drain," and I
revisited the topic of agricultural
subsidies.
While images of dairymen haul
ing brimming buckets of milk from
cow to gutter seem ludicrous, they
effectively cartoon the flaws of
U.S. farm policy. Since the Great
Depression, the U.S. has helped
farmers manage the risks of farm
ing so that America's bread basket
would continue to flourish and the
country would not become de
pendent on imported food. Today,
farm policies have grown into a
complex subsidy network that
costs more than $l6 billion each
year.
Any politician will tell you these
policies are designed to keep the
small farmer in business. They in
clude insurance to cover the value
of a crop in case of natural disaster
and promises to buy up leftover
crops in the event of market fail
ure.
Yet, since the government
began trying to level the agricultur
al playing field, the fraction of
Americans who farm has dropped
from one in four to one in 50, while
the average farm size has more
than doubled.
The reasons for this are primari
ly technological though they're
exacerbated by subsidies and
center around the Green Revolu
tion, a miracle of crop breeding
and innovation that allowed us to
double crop yields per unit area.
The cornerstone of the Green Rev
olution is its suite of hybrid crop
varieties, high-yielding plants
grown in vast monocultures. These
single-variety plantings are nour
ished by massive inputs of fertilizer
and water, protected by heavy
doses of pesticides and most effi
ciently reared and harvested when
the labor of man is replaced by the
labor of machine.
But intensive farming is also fi

nancially intensive, so only large
farms have enough capital to pur
chase (and efficiently use) heavy
equipment and costly inputs. Thus,
many mom-and-pop farmers have
been squeezed out of agriculture,
their land amalgamated into mega
farms big enough to give modern
tractors room to roam.
Subsidies also serve the big
farmer more. Many farmers grow
government-subsidized crops be
cause they are guaranteed a payout
even if their crop fails; thus, subsi
dies actually boost supply, glutting
the market and shrinking profit
margins. But for a farmer with 100
times the acreage as his neighbor,
even a slim margin produces 100
times the profits, and he might just
squeak by while his small-scale
neighbor goes belly-up.
The pattern's results show in
today's data: 10 percent of U.S.
farmers receive 76 percent of sub
sidy payments, while 62 percent
don't see a penny. Wheat, corn, soy
bean, rice and cotton-growers col
lect 90 percent of the subsidies,
while fruit-and-veggie farmers
labor unsupported.
And, because much of our grain
crop goes to feed livestock, most of
the $5.5 billion we paid corn and
soybean growers in 2009 can get
tacked onto the $1.3 billion dairy
farmers and livestock ranchers re
ceived directly.
So it's no surprise that a pound
of beef is so cheap: agricultural
subsidies are finding their way
through the farming system and,
ultimately, to our waistlines. The
average 18-year-old today weighs
15 lbs more than his or her parents
did at that age 30 years ago. Yet, at
a time when most Americans
should be trying to slim down, our
tax dollars are propping up an in
dustry that's keeping us fat.
After accounting for inflation, a
comparison of food prices over
that same 30-year time span shows
that, while the cost of soda, steak
and sweets has fallen, fruit and veg
etable prices have risen an incredi
ble 40 percent. All because, 70
years ago, we decided our farmers
couldn't lose their jobs.
Meanwhile, many of them still

are. And, while they know that
changes may be painful, they are
joining the clamor for reform. The
Farm Bill which carries the au
thority for many of our subsidy
programs is up for renewal next
year and, in this time of fiscal crisis,
the Obama administration has
proposed a $5 billion cut over 10
years and a restructuring to focus
subsidy distribution on lower-in
come farmers. But this is a drop in
the bucket and like the 1996
Farm Bill, which attempted to re
form and even phase out many
subsidies, but was supplanted a few
years later unlikely to really
take hold.

More powerful, though, might
be a growing grass-roots move
ment: our grass-roots movement.
In a country where overproduc
tion and overconsumption have
become the norm, many of us are
responding to a growing sense of
discontent.
Given the fundamental reliance
of the Green Revolution on fossil
fuels, and the negative impacts of
industrialized farming on our envi
ronment, the time is ripe for us to
look beyond the pail, beyond the
field and beyond the norm, to a
new paradigm for American agri
culture.
