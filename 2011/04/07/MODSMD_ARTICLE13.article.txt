## Can You Say "Palo Alto" in Danish? 
### Shane Savitsky 
While you guys are wrapping
up week two of the quar
ter, my everlasting pre-
Oxford spring break continues.
Needless to say, four straight weeks
in Scranton might get a little soul
crushing, so I did what any sane
person would do: I took a trip to
Europe for the weekend. One of
my best friends from high school,
Sam, is currently studying abroad
in Copenhagen. She's always com
plaining how she once visited me at
Stanford, but I never visit her at
school. Problem is, she goes to
Macalester College in St. Paul,
Minnesota and while I love her
dearly, I don't love frostbite. Thus,
seeing her in Denmark managed to
kill two birds with one stone: I got
to break up my extraordinarily long
spring break and stop her constant
guilt trips. I'll call that a win-win.
If my four days in Copenhagen
showed me anything, it's that Stan
ford absolutely must make the city
the next addition to the Bing Over
seas Study Program. There's been a
lot of talk recently about adding a
program in the Middle East. Ap
parently, that region of the world is
very pertinent to international pol
itics right now. That's all well and
good, but Dubai or Riyadh is about
as far as you could get from The
Farm. Stanford students might
claim that they go abroad for inter
national experience or language

immersion, but they really go for
the lack of a drinking age and the
GPA boost. Do you really think
our students would want to end up
in some Middle Eastern country
with temperatures consistently in
the range of "boiling" and a com
plete lack of alcohol? I think not.
Forget the Middle East, Bing. You
want Copenhagen. Here's the
beautiful thing: the city is literally
just like Palo Alto only bigger,
colder and more European. Basi
cally, it's the dream place for the
next Bing program. Trust me on
this one.
First off, take all of the yuppie
and hipster elements so prevalent
to Palo Alto and port them to a city
of 1.2 million people. That's
Copenhagen. Danish culture has
this concept called "hygge." (Don't
ask me how to pronounce it be
cause everything in Danish just
sounds like prolonged mumbling.)
The word is usually translated to
something like "coziness," and you
can find hygge in most cafes and
restaurants in Copenhagen. Think

of the CoHo or the Palo Alto
Coupa but infinitely more au
thentic in some European
building on a quiet pedestrian
street. That's hygge. For example, I
found myself in this organic soup
shop situated in the basement of a
Copenhagen building the other
night. (Speaking of, we need an or
ganic soup restaurant in Palo Alto.
Startup idea, anyone? I want cred
it.) I was drinking an organic beer.
There was some guy playing
acoustic guitar in the next room. I
turned to Sam and her friend
Lizzie and said, "Guys, I'm not sure
if you realized this, but we're hip
sters. This proves it." Any town that
makes you an environmentally
conscious hipster just by going out
to dinner is definitely close to Palo
Alto's heart.
Plus, I don't know if you've
heard, but Copenhagen is damn
expensive. The chili I had at that
soup place? Something like $l7. A
beer while out at a bar? Definitely
close to $lO. Sound familiar? Oh
yeah! Palo Alto is the United
States' most expensive college
town. I know people who willingly
pay like $l5 for a salad at Sprout.
Want to avoid the sticker shock of
living in Copenhagen? Just go
straight there from the Bay Area.

Problem solved.
Honestly, I don't think Stanford
can miss out on this opportunity.
Scandinavia remains untapped
within our vast study abroad re
sources. Everyone in Copenhagen
speaks immaculate English, so
there's no need for a language re
quirement either. Less time spent
learning a useless language (would
you ever use Danish, anyway?)
means more time going out. As
Rebecca Black would say, "Party

ing, partying! Yeah!" As it stands,
partying is the most useful thing
about a study abroad experience
anyway just ask your friends
who came back from Madrid or
Berlin. And if most Bing programs
are just recreations of the Stanford
bubble in a foreign country, then
why not have your European Stan
ford bubble in a place that reminds
you of Palo Alto?
Oh, and Danish girls are really,
really hot. That's pretty important,
too.
