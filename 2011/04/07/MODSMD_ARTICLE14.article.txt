## The 						Moral Implications of Special Fees 
### 
Student election season is here
again, which means it is time for
everyone on campus to be con
fused about Special Fees. Special
Fees is an amorphous vat of money
outside of general fees to fund stu
dent groups that can't be funded
through normal bureaucratic chan
nels. Because of the opacity of stu
dent group finances, groups take ad
vantage of the system and stretch
the boundaries of Special Fees legit
imacy for their own benefit.
The Stanford Flipside, a weekly
satire publication, exposed this issue
when it requested $7,000+ in Special
Fees to buy a Segway scooter. The
Flipside's satire attracted a fair
amount of attention and made clear

that the Special Fees process has
enormous, easily exploitable loop
holes. It seems obviously immoral
for students to game the Special
Fees process at the expense of other
students. But why?
I believe it is possible to create a
coherent moral justification for
awarding Special Fees money. There
are right and wrong actions for stu
dent groups requesting Special Fees
to take, independent of other stu
dent groups' actions or the rules of
Special Fees. Just because the law
does not prohibit an action does not
make it morally justifiable, nor does
the fact that other groups are acting
immorally condone one's immoral
actions.

We should base the morality of a
Special Fees request on the princi
ple of universalizability. Universal
izability, in its simplest interpreta
tion, states that an action is moral if
you would support everyone taking
that same action under similar cir
cumstances. In other words, if a stu
dent group is requesting funding for
a specific item, it would only be
moral if it would be willing to sup
port every other group requesting
funding for the same item given sim
ilar conditions. Or, from the per
spective of a Special Fees voter, vot
ing to support one's group's Special
Fees request is only morally justified
if the voter is willing to support
every other group that has similar
requests and faces similar con
straints.
A maxim of universalizability is
attractive because it allows for flexi
bility and differing moral judgments
between individuals. Students will
apply universalizability in different
ways: some will be willing to deem
more requests as universalizable
and therefore acceptable; others will
draw a more stringent line.
Unless a person believes in com
plete moral relativism, however,
universalizability will lead to certain
requests being roundly agreed upon
as immoral. Let us take again the ex
ample of the Flipside: now that the
members of the Flipside have point
ed out the flaws in the system, they
have continued their request and
are actively campaigning for Special

Fees approval (including both print
ing costs and a Segway).

I find this action immoral be
cause it is impossible to universalize
that expense. I cannot speak for the
members of the Flipside, but it
seems hard to believe that these stu
dents would be actively willing to
fund Segways, parties or clothing for
any other group. Most students, I be
lieve, would be very hesitant to pay
for some group's personal expenses
or fund anything that does not di
rectly and irreplaceably contribute
to the goal of the student group.
The problem with Special Fees,
though, is that as average students
we cannot tell what funds are irre
placeable and what funds are not. It
is impossible to fully understand a
group's finances and budget re
quests unless you are deeply en
meshed in that group. Groups often
request items like airfare for tour
naments, which, depending on
whom you ask, could be universaliz
able: some say that groups that
spend all year preparing for a big
tournament and could not easily

fund the travel expenses in other
ways should be allowed to ask for
those costs in Special Fees; others
would argue that these are personal
expenses and should not be.
In these situations, the moral
onus more prominently falls on the
student groups. Are these groups
asking for money that they would
consider universally supporting for
other groups in similar situations? If
the answer is no, then according to
the idea of universalizability these
student groups should not be re
questing those Special Fees. So long
as we agree to act morally to our fel
low students and community mem
bers, loopholes won't matter and we
can begin to restore the validity of
the Special Fees system.
