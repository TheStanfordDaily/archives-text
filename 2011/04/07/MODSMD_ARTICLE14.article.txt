## The
						Moral Implications of Special Fees 
### 
Student election season is here
again, which means it is time for
everyone on campus to be con
fused about Special Fees. Special
Fees is an amorphous vat of money
outside of general fees to fund stu
dent groups that can't be funded
through normal bureaucratic chan
nels. Because of the opacity of stu
dent group finances, groups take ad
vantage of the system and stretch
the boundaries of Special Fees legit
imacy for their own benefit.
The Stanford Flipside, a weekly
satire publication, exposed this issue
when it requested $7,000+ in Special
Fees to buy a Segway scooter. The
Flipside's satire attracted a fair
amount of attention and made clear

that the Special Fees process has
enormous, easily exploitable loop
holes. It seems obviously immoral
for students to game the Special
Fees process at the expense of other
students. But why?
I believe it is possible to create a
coherent moral justification for
awarding Special Fees money. There
are right and wrong actions for stu
dent groups requesting Special Fees
to take, independent of other stu
dent groups' actions or the rules of
Special Fees. Just because the law
does not prohibit an action does not
make it morally justifiable, nor does
the fact that other groups are acting
immorally condone one's immoral
actions.

We should base the morality of a
Special Fees request on the princi
ple of universalizability. Universal
izability, in its simplest interpreta
tion, states that an action is moral if
you would support everyone taking
that same action under similar cir
cumstances. In other words, if a stu
dent group is requesting funding for
a specific item, it would only be
moral if it would be willing to sup
port every other group requesting
funding for the same item given sim
ilar conditions. Or, from the per
spective of a Special Fees voter, vot
ing to support one's group's Special
Fees request is only morally justified
