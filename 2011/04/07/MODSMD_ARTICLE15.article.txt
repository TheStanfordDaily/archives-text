# Campaign to Abstain Obscures Student Opinion
## 
### MILES UNTERREINER '12 
While I well understand the
principled stance taken by
John Haskell in his Op-Ed
of April 6, practical considerations
compel me to state my reluctant op
position to it. It does not seem to me
that adhering firmly to established
moral principles will in this case
necessarily lead to the best practical
outcome, as Mr. Haskell himself
would probably define it, this cam
paign week.
Today and tomorrow, the Stan
ford student body will vote upon,
among other things, Measure A.
Voters choosing to record a prefer
ence on Measure A will be given
three options, as follows: a) I sup
port the reinstatement of ROTC at

Stanford University; b) I oppose the
reinstatement of ROTC at Stanford
University; c) I choose to abstain.
Recently, members of the Cam
paign to Abstain, Mr. Haskell
among them, have urged opponents
of ROTC's return to choose option
(c), rather than option (b). The ra
tionale given for this argument is
one of moral principle: that never,
under any circumstances, should
the natural or human rights of a mi
nority group in this case, Stan
ford's transgender community
be subject to the caprice of popular
plebiscite.
The normative argument is a
bold one, and I will not venture so
far as to pronounce upon its validity

here. But questions of descriptive
reality impel us to take into account
considerations other than the pure
ly moral. Whether we like it or not,
Measure A is on the ballot. Let us
consider what the empirical ramifi
cations of that fact will be.
First, it seems clear that very few
people who were previously deter
mined to support the return of
ROTC will change their minds as a
result of the Campaign and instead
vote to abstain. It is thus eminently
likely that very nearly all the votes
the Campaign will garner in support
of option (c) will therefore have
come at the expense of option (b).
Two problems follow from this
assumption. First, students voting
to "Abstain" rather than to "Op
pose" can only harm, and cannot
help, their side's chances of carry
ing the day. And second, it will be
impossible to discern between vot
ers who abstain for reasons of apa
thy or indifference and voters who
abstain for reasons of principle.
To address the first problem, let
us assign hypothetical values to this
very real situation. I do not think it
inapposite to assume for purposes
of argument that half of Stanford
students support ROTC's return
and half oppose it. In a world sans
option (c), then, the vote would
look like this:
a. 50 percent Support
b. 50 percent Oppose
Depending on how successful the
Campaign has been, however, we
could instead expect numbers any
where from
a. 50 percent Support
b. 40 percent Oppose
c. 10 percent Abstain
to
a. 50 percent Support
b. 10 percent Oppose
c. 40 percent Abstain
and anything in between. Given
these numbers, it becomes clear

that the only effect of swaying some
voters from "Oppose" to "Abstain"
will be to split the opposition, giving
"Support" the clear plurality victo
ry and I think we can all agree
that the latter two of these three
scenarios appear rather a less force
ful statement of Stanford's opposi
tion to ROTC's return than the for
mer.

Second, there will be no differ
entiation on the ballot between "I
choose to abstain for reasons of
principle" and "I choose to abstain
because I have no opinion or I do
not care one way or the other or I
simply do not know." All of these
diverse options are covered by the
capacious and frankly rather vague
option (c), "I choose to abstain."
Given that the primary reason for
Measure As existence is to inform
the Faculty Senate of Stanford's
opinion on the potential return of
ROTC, I think we can also all agree
that a mass of undifferentiated and
unclear "Abstain" votes will do lit
tle to accomplish that objective.
For the reasons stated above, I
think that the Stanford community
would do better to state its support
of or opposition to ROTC's return
unequivocally and in clear terms.
Doing so will be better for ROTC's
opponents, who will have a better
chance of carrying the vote, and for
both the Faculty Senate and our
ROTC cadets, who will gain a more
lucid understanding of student
opinion.
