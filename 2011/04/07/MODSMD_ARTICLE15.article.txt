# Campaign to Abstain Obscures Student Opinion
## 
### MILES UNTERREINER '12 
While I well understand the
principled stance taken by
John Haskell in his Op-Ed
of April 6, practical considerations
compel me to state my reluctant op
position to it. It does not seem to me
that adhering firmly to established
moral principles will in this case
necessarily lead to the best practical
outcome, as Mr. Haskell himself
would probably define it, this cam
paign week.
Today and tomorrow, the Stan
ford student body will vote upon,
among other things, Measure A.
Voters choosing to record a prefer
ence on Measure A will be given
three options, as follows: a) I sup
port the reinstatement of ROTC at

Stanford University; b) I oppose the
reinstatement of ROTC at Stanford
University; c) I choose to abstain.
Recently, members of the Cam
paign to Abstain, Mr. Haskell
among them, have urged opponents
of ROTC's return to choose option
(c), rather than option (b). The ra
tionale given for this argument is
one of moral principle: that never,
under any circumstances, should
the natural or human rights of a mi
nority group in this case, Stan
ford's transgender community
be subject to the caprice of popular
plebiscite.
The normative argument is a
bold one, and I will not venture so
far as to pronounce upon its validity

here. But questions of descriptive
reality impel us to take into account
considerations other than the pure
ly moral. Whether we like it or not,
Measure A is on the ballot. Let us
consider what the empirical ramifi
cations of that fact will be.
First, it seems clear that very few
people who were previously deter
mined to support the return of
ROTC will change their minds as a
result of the Campaign and instead
vote to abstain. It is thus eminently
likely that very nearly all the votes
the Campaign will garner in support
of option (c) will therefore have
come at the expense of option (b).
