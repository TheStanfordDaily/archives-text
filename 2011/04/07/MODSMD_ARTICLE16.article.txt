It was not long ago that tablets,
smart phones and tiny MP3 play
ers existed more in the realm of
science fiction than in the backpacks
of Stanford students. At the heart of
all these gadgets is the semiconduc
tor chip. The hunger for smarter and
sleeker gadgets requires chips that
are faster, smaller and more capable
all of which creates significant
engineering challenges for those in
volved in the manufacture of semi
conductors.
In 1965 Intel's Gordon Moore
made a legendary observation that
the number of transistors on a chip
doubles every 12 (later revised to
18-24) months. This observation,
which came to be known as
"Moore's Law," has been the foun
dation and fundamental driver of
the semiconductor industry ever
since. Amazingly, 45 years later,
Moore's Law is still essentially in
tact, and the transistor count on
modern integrated circuits has risen
from up to 500 in 1965 to over three
billion transistors today.
Not surprisingly, keeping up with
Moore's Law has been no easy feat
for companies in the semiconductor
industry, especially those companies
that develop the tools necessary for
the manufacture of the smaller and
faster chips needed to power new
technologies.
As a software engineer with over
20 years in the semiconductor indus
try, I have worked on and with a va
riety of technologies to ensure that
the required equipment keep up
with Moore's Law. Currently, I am at
KLA-Tencor, a leading semicon
ductor equipment company respon
sible for manufacturing crucial in
spection and metrology (precision
measurement) products and tools
for the chip-making industry.
Throughout the different stages of
the chip manufacturing process our
tools inspect and measure the pro
duction wafers (the base material of

semiconductors) to ensure the chips
are defect-free and that chipmakers
like Intel can maximize the number
of usable chips they get from each
wafer.
To keep up with Moore's Law,
our tools must double their capabil
ities every two years, so we face
many daunting engineering chal
lenges. My colleagues at KLA-Ten
cor, in a wide range of technical dis
ciplines, grapple with Gordon
Moore's dictum every single day:
Mechanical Engineers: These en
gineers work on mechanical stages
that may require reliable positional
accuracy of a few nanometers. Or
they may work on stages that only
require positional accuracy of 100
nanometers, but must be able to
move quickly and smoothly with no
more than 5 nanometers of error.
Because of Moore's law, the stages
required in the next few years will
need to be even more accurate.
Optical Engineers: These engi
neers may work on lens assemblies
that require large, flat fields of view.
Such optics are used to image and
manufacture transistors as small as
22 nanometers, all the while using
light with wavelengths ten times as
large. This is like trying to stamp out
typewriter sized lettering with a
sledgehammer.
Electrical Engineers: Electrical
Engineers design sensor boards ca
pable of capturing images at 20
GB/sec (think of this as over 100 un
compressed 1080p HD image
streams). These boards send these
images at 20 GB/sec over fiber op
tics to computers that process the
images in real-time, looking for fea
tures that are too small to resolve. At
these speeds and sensitivities, even
one hundred extra photons picked
up or lost by the sensor matters, so
the challenge is to run extremely fast
but without appreciable noise.
Software Engineers: Software
Engineers in my field work on pro
grams with millions of lines of code
and that run on clusters of ma
chines. The cluster might be a
unique mix of Windows, Linux,
Apple and embedded systems. And
the tools are programmed using lan
guages from Java and C#, to C and
assembly, to Python.
Algorithm Specialists: Algo
rithm Specialists design and imple
ment new algorithms to detect

problems on the wafers. Because
of 45 years of Moore's Law, the fea
tures and defects on the wafers are
so small they can no longer be re
solved by the inspectors. This is a
problem similar to searching for
unresolvable extra-solar planets ..
. but much faster. Here, state-of
the-art image processing tech
niques are employed, and the
image processing still requires a
cluster of computers to ship with
each tool. Tools ship today that in
clude clusters that in 2007 would
have made the Top 500 supercom
puter list.
And all this out of companies
whose names most people have
never heard of, yet are central to

the manufacture of the chips that
are the building blocks of their
HDTVs, laptops, and increasingly,
even cars.
The last 40 years have been quite
a ride. And the next 40 years look to
be quite a ride, too.
