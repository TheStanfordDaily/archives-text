## ONE LAST PUSH Card faces final road trip 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
With just three games remaining
before the regular season ends and
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament begins, the Stanford
men's volleyball team is gearing up
for a dogfight. Although the team has
already clinched a spot in the post
season â€” which in men's volleyball
spans the annual conference tourna
ment and four-team NCAA Tourna
ment that follows the No. 2 seed in
the playoffs is still up for grabs as the
No. 3 Cardinal trails No. 2 BYU by
half a game.
National No. 1 USC has already
wrapped up the MPSF regular sea
son title by going 17-1 in conference
play and 18-1 overall, and has to be
the current favorite to win both the
MPSF and NCAA titles. Stanford
(17-7, 13-6 MPSF) is still trying to
avoid being placed in USC's half of
the MPSF draw, which it could do by
finishing either second or third in the
standings.
Thankfully for Stanford, the Car
dinal swept the season series against
BYU, so it does in fact control its own
destiny in the race for the No. 2 seed.
To achieve that goal, Stanford
must take care of business this week
end on the road against No. 6 UC-
Santa Barbara (13-11,10-8) and No.
7 UCLA (15-11, 8-10). The Bruins
have struggled of late, dropping
matches to No. 11 UC-San Diego

and No. 8 UC-Irvine in the past
week. But they have been able to
protect their home court, having
won seven of 11 games in Westwood
this season.
Santa Barbara also enjoys playing
with the comforts of home, where
they are 7-5 this year. The Gauchos
swept San Diego the team that
shocked Stanford in Maples Pavilion
in March on the road last week
end before falling at the hands of
UC-Irvine in Irvine.
Junior All-American outside
hitter Brad Lawson currently leads
the team with 383 kills, and his .332
hitting percentage is second on the
team among players with at least

GAME NOTES: Although Stanford has al
ready clinched a playoff spot in the MPSF
tournament, the Cardinal is trying to im
prove its seeding this weekend with a two
game swing against UC-Sanfa Barbara
and UCLA. If the Cardinal continues to
play well, it can snag the No. 2 seed in the
MPSF tournament.

games before postseason play starts. If the Card can continue to play
well, it can grab the No. 2 seed in the MPSF tournament.
