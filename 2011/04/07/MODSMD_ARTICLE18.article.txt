# Let's say we end today....
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
The Major League Base
ball season is just finishing
its first week. Teams have
hardly completed one run
through their starting ro
tations, and already tornadoes of
questions are circling teams. In this
day and age where every pompous
sports fan, arrogant writer and bored
college student can post their
thoughts for the world to see it's
never too early to jump to crazy con
clusions.
Of course, the natural reaction is to
dismiss these questions and point out
that every team is still in the first 5
percent of its schedule, meaning that
anything can happen and that the
first week will be rendered virtually
moot. But where's the fun in that? In
stead, let's buy into every last bit of
hype, throw in the towel when things
look rough and jump to every conclu
sion we can after the first week of the
season.
Playoff teams: If the season ended
today (thankfully it does not), the Ori
oles, Royals and Blue Jays would all
be rolling into the ALDS. That's pret
ty much what most people expected,
considering the Orioles have not won
the AL East since 1997 and the Roy
als have not won their division since
they were in the AL West way back in
1985. The Blue Jays would be back in
the playoffs for the first time since
winning back-to-back World Series in

1992 and 1993.
Non-playoff teams: As most peo
ple expected, the Red Sox, Rays and
Athletics have combined for fewer
wins (one) than Kevin Correia (two),
while the Twins and Giants are cur
rently last in their respective divisions.
The Brewers and Cardinals, the fa
vorites in the NL Central, have com
bined for the same number of wins
(four) as the Pirates, who aren't even
winning the division.
One player is a whole team: Howie
Kendrick has scored as many runs
(seven) as the Rays, while John Lack
ey gave up as many runs with one pitch
(four) as the Orioles' staff gave up
through four games. Fausto Carmona
gave up as many runs (10) in his Open
ing Day start as the Braves did through
five games (two of which they lost).
Two different part-time catchers, Ryan
Hanigan and J.R Arencibia, had as
many homers in one game (two) as the
Cardinals have had in six games. And
they've got a guy on their team named
Albert Pujols. Oh, and one more thing
about the Rays: Alex Gordon and Car
los Quentin have combined to outhit
the entire Tampa Bay lineup 22-21
through five games.
Absurd numbers: Forget going for
Ted Williams' .406 mark; Quentin is
sitting on a .500 batting average
thanks to 11 hits in his first five games
along with 10 RBI, putting him on
pace for 324 runs knocked in. Mark
Teixeira and Nelson Cruz each have

four home runs already, putting them
on pace to shatter Barry Bonds' pa
thetic record of only 73 long balls.
Light-hitting Willie Bloomquist
(give yourself a pat on the back if you
knew he currently plays for the Dia
mondbacks) has five stolen bases in
five games despite the fact that he has
only stolen more than 16 bases in a
season once in his nine-year career.
Jonny Gomes has only two hits in 10
at-bats, but he has already drawn a
MLB-high seven walks. But perhaps
most impressive of all is Jarrod Dyson
(give yourself a slap in the face if you
knew he plays for the Royals, or if you
even knew who Jarrod Dyson was),
who has managed to steal three bases
this year without a single plate ap
pearance.
What does all this mean? The obvi
ous answer is nothing, because there
are still almost six more months of the
regular season. But it does mean that
baseball season is here upon us, which
means the floodgates of useless
knowledge and even more useless sta
tistics have just been opened.
Will the Rays go 0-162? Will Joe
Mauer finish the season with the sec
ond-worst batting average among
catchers? Will Albert Pujols finish
with a worse OPS than both Peter
Bouijos and Mark Trumbo? Will the
Orioles run away with the AL East?
Probably not. But with over 2,000
MLB games left this season, who
knows what will happen?

Jacob Jaffe does know that teams who
start the season 0-4 only have a 24 per
cent chance of making the playoffs,
though. Remind him of this fact at jw
jaffe@stanford. edu.

What does all this mean? The obvi
ous answer is nothing, because there
are still almost six more months of the
regular season. But it does mean that
baseball season is here upon us, which
means the floodgates of useless
knowledge and even more useless sta
tistics have just been opened.
Will the Rays go 0-162? Will Joe
Mauer finish the season with the sec
ond-worst batting average among
catchers? Will Albert Pujols finish
with a worse OPS than both Peter
Bouijos and Mark Trumbo? Will the
Orioles run away with the AL East?
Probably not. But with over 2,000
MLB games left this season, who
knows what will happen?

Jacob Jaffe does know that teams who
start the season 0-4 only have a 24 per
cent chance of making the playoffs,
though. Remind him of this fact at jw
