# MAKING A NAME FOR
## SQUASH 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
How do you get noticed
as a sports program,
and a women's one at
that, when you're com
peting in the sea of
top-tier programs that make up
Cardinal athletics? Try quickly ris
ing to No. 6 in the nation and being
the only team of its kind in the state
of California. That's the reality for
the Stanford women's squash team,
and under head coach Mark Tal
bott, it has achieved this feat in just
six seasons.
In 2005, the Stanford Athletic
Department announced that the
women's club team would become
the first women's varsity squash
team west of the Mississippi River.
In 2011, the Cardinal finished No. 6
in the nation after a tough season
competing against the dominant
squash schools from the East
Coast.
Co-captained by seniors Cecilia
Haig and Samantha Buechner,
Stanford finished the regular sea
son 9-5 and reached the final of the
consolations in the Howe Cup, the
national championship, before los
ing to No. 4 Penn and finishing the
season 10-7. The Cardinal traveled
four separate weekends to the East
Coast and hosted Bates College
and George Washington University
at Stanford's new facilities.
Haig recognized the hardships
of trekking across the country but
knows that squash's concentration
in the Northeast makes the travel a
necessity.
"We fly east and play three, four,
sometimes five matches," ex
plained Haig, who grew up in
Greenwich, Conn. "Once, we
played five matches in three days in
four different states. A plus is that

we are near many \^H
of our homes, so
we often get to
enjoy home cooking
and team bonding. All
our families are so on board and
very incorporated with the team."
Another feature unique to Stan
ford squash is the nature of the
team itself. Originally founded by
enthusiastic undergraduate stu
dents, the team still largely relies on
the student-athletes for passion
and commitment. The team is
nonetheless managed and led by
Talbott, who himself was the No. 1
male squash player in the United
States from 1983-1995 and coached
the Yale women's team to a nation
al championship in 2004 before
moving on to a new challenge in
Palo Alto.
"I really wanted to help expand
squash to the West Coast," Talbott
said. "But one of the main reasons I
chose to move to California was be
cause my daughter has diabetes
and this was a better environment
for my family. This is now my sev
enth year here and I love coaching
both the women's team and the
men's team."
When Talbott first arrived, Stan
ford was ranked almost dead last in
the country. However, under his au
thority, the Cardinal has steadily
moved up the rankings.
"We are the only team that's
played every single collegiate
squash team," Talbott laughed.
"Because we started so far down in
the rankings, we've moved up divi
sions over the past years and now
are part of the top tier. It's a unique
program with a huge amount of stu
dent involvement."
Talbott is beloved by all his play
ers, who admire his immense
coaching knowledge as well as his
laid-back approach.
"Mark is probably one of the
coolest people I know," Haig said.
"His love of the game is infused in

the team and his relaxed attitude is
refreshing. Richard, our assistant
coach, is more structured and often
focuses on drilling, whereas Mark
concentrates more on match play
it's the perfect combo."
One memorable match for
freshman Serena Fagan was
against No. 3 Trinity College, a
powerhouse program in the squash
world, in which the Cardinal fell 5-
4.
"I played first round and played
so terribly," Fagan said. "Collegiate
squash is a different pace of play
ing. People volley a lot more and
cut the ball off early so it makes

everything faster. I was upset that I
hadn't played well, but my team
mates encouraged me and told me
that everyone gets nervous for her
first match."
Talbott expressed satisfaction in
the team's growing confidence lev
els.
"I think the girls are really start
ing to trust that they can compete
with the top five teams," Talbott
said. "Trinity, for example, and
even the close match against Penn
in the Flowe Cup consolation
final."
Based on the past, the Cardinal
should believe in itself jumping
from an ambiguous 30-something
to a No. 6 in the rankings in less
than six years speaks for itself.

ers, who admire his immense
coaching knowledge as well as his
laid-back approach.
"Mark is probably one of the
coolest people I know," Haig said.
"His love of the game is infused in

the team and his relaxed attitude is
refreshing. Richard, our assistant
coach, is more structured and often
focuses on drilling, whereas Mark
concentrates more on match play
it's the perfect combo."
One memorable match for
freshman Serena Fagan was
against No. 3 Trinity College, a
powerhouse program in the squash
world, in which the Cardinal fell 5-
4.
"I played first round and played
so terribly," Fagan said. "Collegiate
squash is a different pace of play
ing. People volley a lot more and
cut the ball off early so it makes

everything faster. I was upset that I
hadn't played well, but my team
mates encouraged me and told me
that everyone gets nervous for her
first match."
Talbott expressed satisfaction in
the team's growing confidence lev
els.
"I think the girls are really start
ing to trust that they can compete
with the top five teams," Talbott
said. "Trinity, for example, and
even the close match against Penn
in the Flowe Cup consolation
final."
Based on the past, the Cardinal
should believe in itself jumping
from an ambiguous 30-something
to a No. 6 in the rankings in less
than six years speaks for itself.
