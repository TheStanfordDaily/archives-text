## Junior guard Green suspended from school 
### Jack Blanchat 
Stanford junior guard Jeremy
Green, a first-team all-Pac-10 selec
tion, was suspended from school on
Wednesday for academic reasons.
Green, the Cardinal's leading
scorer last season, was an integral
part of a team with no seniors this
past year, but the academic suspen
sion is not expected to affect
Green's status as a member of the
team for next year.
Head Coach Johnny Dawkins
expects Green to be back for next
season, but it is conceivable that the
junior from Austin, Texas could de
clare for the NBA Draft. The dead
line to declare for the draft is Sun

day, April 24.
The Cardinal leaned on Green
to be a major scoring threat this past
season, so his return is crucial to
Stanford's offensive game.
Green's 16.7 points-per-game
average was fifth-best in the Pac-10
this past season. He was especially
deadly from deep, as he made 88
three-pointers; the second most in
the conference, and his 43 percent
accuracy from beyond the arc was
fourth-best in the Pac-10.
This is the second suspension for
Green in his time at Stanford. In
October 2009, Green was arrested
on suspicion of domestic violence at
a campus dormitory and subse
quently suspended for the Cardi
nal's season-opening game.

Head coach Johnny Dawkins does not anticipate the suspension to interfere
with the 2011-2012 season.
