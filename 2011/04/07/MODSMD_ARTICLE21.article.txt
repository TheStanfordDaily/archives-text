# Softball tries to stop slide at UCLA
## 
### Jack Blanchcit 
The Stanford Softball team
heads south to Los Angeles this
weekend to take on UCLA in a
three-game Pac-10 series.
The trip marks the first true road
series of the year for the Card (24-7,
0-3 Pac-10) as it swings into the
heart of the Pac-10 season.
The Cardinal is looking to re
bound after a tough series against
Arizona last weekend at home,
where the Wildcats outscored the
Cardinal by a margin of 16-1 in a
three-game set.
Cardinal pitchers Ashley Chinn
and Teagan Gerhart both had trou
ble handling the hard-hitting Cats,
with Chinn recording her first loss
of the season and Gerhart taking
two losses in the circle.
The Cardinal offense also strug
gled mightily, only notching eight
hits all weekend and recording just
one hit in Friday's game and two
hits in Sunday's contest.
Stanford's schedule doesn't get
any easier this weekend against the
Bruins, the 2010 national champi
ons. The No. 6 Bruins are 27-5 so far
this season, with their most recent
victory being a 5-4 comeback win
over Loyola Marymount on
Wednesday.
UCLA is also riding an eight
game winning streak, including a
three-game sweep of conference
foe Oregon State,
Stanford and UCLA square off
in the first game of the series on Fri
day at 7 p.m. at Easton Stadium.
