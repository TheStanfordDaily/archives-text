# MEN'S TENNIS
## Stanford bests USD in convincing fashion 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
recorded a commanding 5-2 win
Wednesday afternoon against the
University of San Diego.
The No. 9 Cardinal (12-5,2-1 Pac
-10) jumped on the No. 29 Toreros
(15-5, 1-1 West Coast Conference)
early and often and the match was
decided almost as soon as it began.
Stanford claimed the doubles
point easily, winning all three dou
bles matches. The fourth-ranked
doubles squad of Bradley Klahn and
Ryan Thacher continued their im
pressive streak, winning 8-3.
The Cardinal then speedily
clinched the match, winning at the
one, five and six spots in two sets
apiece.
The Toreros were able to get two
points after the match had been de
cided, but the Cardinal finished with
another impressive win over a quali
ty opponent.
One player who has stepped up in
recent matches is sophomore Matt
Kandath, who won 7-6, 6-3 yester
day. Kandath's improvement is em
blematic of how both the top and
bottom of the Cardinal lineup has
demonstrated they can carry the
squad in recent matches.
Senior Greg Hirschman talked
about the importance of every posi
tion in the lineup.
"It's always helpful, as a team,
when you can rely on different peo
ple stepping up," Hirschman said.
"Not everyone is going to have their
best day constantly, but a tennis
match is a four out of seven series.
It's nice when we can diversify where
we win because that takes a little bit

of the pressure off everybody."
Wednesday's match was the third
against a top-10 squad in a span of
five days for San Diego, and none of
the three were pretty. The Toreros
faced No. 6 Pepperdine last Saturday
and then No. 10 California on Tues
day, and both matches turned out to
be 6-1 blowouts.
The Toreros have shown they can
beat quality opponents, but are 0-5
this season against top-10 foes. To be
fair, they have won all fifteen of their
other matches, but the dejection was
clear when they fell behind early in
yesterday's match.
After a tough March, the Cardi
nal is playing some of its best tennis
of late. The young squad has won its
last four matches all against
ranked opponents and looks
poised to make a run into the post
season. With only six regular season
matches remaining, Stanford hopes
to maintain the momentum it has
built in the last week and a half
through to the end of the season.
There's a lot of pressure for top
teams like Stanford to win, but
Hirschman noted that the team is
often more focused on having fun.
"We kept being right there with
the best teams, but kept coming up
short and there's not too much fun in
losing," Hirschman said. "The way to
have more fun is to get the wins, and
the UCLA win was huge for us."
Stanford hopes to continue hav
ing fun this weekend against a tough
Washington squad, and it will head
to the Pacific Northwest to take on
the Huskies in Seattle on Friday at
1:30 p.m.
