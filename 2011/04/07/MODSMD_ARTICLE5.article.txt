## Groups advocate 'abstain' on ROTC measure 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Over the past several weeks, a cam
paign to vote 'abstain' on Thursday's
ballot Measure A-ROTC Advisory
Question has spread through email
lists and gained traction among sever
al student groups, including the Stu
dents of Color Coalition (SOCC) and
the Women's Coalition (WoCo). Liter
ature on the Campaign to Abstain is
being propagated through fliers, Face
book and pamphlets left in student
dining areas.
The advisory question featured on
this year's elections ballot will ask stu
dents whether they support the return
of ROTC to campus, with three possi
ble responses: support, do not support
or abstain. Last week, senators at
tempted to suspend the rules during
their Senate meeting in order to re
peal the ballot measure, but failed to
garner the required 10 votes. The bill
was initially passed unanimously.
John Haskell 'l2, a student at the
forefront of the movement, said that it
is not to be taken to be an anti-ROTC
campaign, but rather an option for stu

dents who either do not feel educated
enough to vote or see the issue as one
of civil rights. He said that students on
both sides of the issue have joined the
effort.
"There are lots of reasons that peo
ple are abstaining, and it makes the
most sense for both sides," he said.
Haskell said that approximately 40
students met during finals week last
quarter to discuss mobilizing the Cam
paign to Abstain, but that it is "really a
grassroots movement."
"For me, I'm not voting no because
I don't believe this is an issue about
ROTC, this isn't a stance on ROTC,
it's abstaining from a poll that sup
presses the minority voice," Haskell
said. "When the elections process hap
pens, it's a lot about mobilizing and
getting people to vote for a candidate.
That process can trivialize what it
means to understand an issue. For this
in particular, [the measure] has a last
ing impact that goes beyond the elec
tions season."

However, some students feel that
the campaign is another channel to sti-
