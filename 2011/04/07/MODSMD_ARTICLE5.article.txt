## Groups advocate 'abstain' on ROTC measure 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Over the past several weeks, a cam
paign to vote 'abstain' on Thursday's
ballot Measure A-ROTC Advisory
Question has spread through email
lists and gained traction among sever
al student groups, including the Stu
dents of Color Coalition (SOCC) and
the Women's Coalition (WoCo). Liter
ature on the Campaign to Abstain is
being propagated through fliers, Face
book and pamphlets left in student
dining areas.
The advisory question featured on
this year's elections ballot will ask stu
dents whether they support the return
of ROTC to campus, with three possi
ble responses: support, do not support
or abstain. Last week, senators at
tempted to suspend the rules during
their Senate meeting in order to re
peal the ballot measure, but failed to
garner the required 10 votes. The bill
was initially passed unanimously.
John Haskell 'l2, a student at the
forefront of the movement, said that it
is not to be taken to be an anti-ROTC
campaign, but rather an option for stu

dents who either do not feel educated
enough to vote or see the issue as one
of civil rights. He said that students on
both sides of the issue have joined the
effort.
"There are lots of reasons that peo
ple are abstaining, and it makes the
most sense for both sides," he said.
Haskell said that approximately 40
students met during finals week last
quarter to discuss mobilizing the Cam
paign to Abstain, but that it is "really a
grassroots movement."
"For me, I'm not voting no because
I don't believe this is an issue about
ROTC, this isn't a stance on ROTC,
it's abstaining from a poll that sup
presses the minority voice," Haskell
said. "When the elections process hap
pens, it's a lot about mobilizing and
getting people to vote for a candidate.
That process can trivialize what it
means to understand an issue. For this
in particular, [the measure] has a last
ing impact that goes beyond the elec
tions season."

However, some students feel that
the campaign is another channel to sti-
fie student debate and serves to
further the anti-ROTC cause.
"A student who doesn't identify
with a minority group should still
have a voice in what happens with
in their community," said Sebast
ian Gould 'l2, a veteran. "Tyranny
by the minority is no worse than a
tyranny by the majority.
"I do believe it is an anti-ROTC
movement simply because they
don't take into consideration the
lives of the ROTC cadets and the
veterans on campus when they talk
about these issues," he added.
Although Stanford Students for
Queer Liberation (SSQL) presi
dent Alok Vaid-Menon 'l3 repre
sents an anti-ROTC viewpoint, he

said that voting to abstain limits
passing an opinion on civil rights
issue.
"Even people who may be pro-
ROTC recognize that it will be the
majority opinion coming through
on this ballot box, and the minority
opinion is going to be neglected,
there are a lot of people who are
the sympathetic to nondiscrimina
tion," he said.
"Voting 'no' is still passing an
opinion on civil rights," added
Leana Keyes 'l4.
Gould remains skeptical. He
said that these conversations will
continue to take place with or
without a poll of the student body.
"Voting on whether or not you
believe we should have ROTC
because it would function as a
community center is not differ
ent than voting on a group for spe
cial fees, because your vote ensures
those groups' existence," he said.

The results of the measure will
be nonbinding; the ad hoc commit
tee investigating the ROTC issue
has indicated that the poll would
be weighed similar to the open let
ters that were solicited in the fall.
"We want to find alternative
ways to oppose discrimination on
our campus, rather than relying on
a ballot box to foster justice,"
Haskell wrote in an email that has
circulated to many chat lists. "We
are striving to uphold our collec
tive investment, as Stanford stu
dents, in equal opportunity, as well
as the values espoused by our non
discrimination clause. We are cre
ating precedent and making a
statement for justice with this
vote."
"If you're going to vote, then
vote," Gould said.
