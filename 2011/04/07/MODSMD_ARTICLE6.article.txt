# KUSF sale undermines KZSU
## Plans under new ownership can limit reach of Stanford radio 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Radio signals may be fuzzy for the Cardinal in the North Bay,
where new ownership of the University of San Francisco radio
station, KUSF, will move the transmitter to a high altitude loca
tion in the North Bay and significantly limit Stanford's range of
radio listeners.
"Essentially what's going to happen is that a lot of our cover
age in the East Bay and what we get in San Francisco is going to
be cut off," said J.D. Fladdon 'l3, KZSU's sports director. "We are
losing a community."
According to KZSU (Stanford) publicity director Adam
Pearson 'll, the concession of the KUSF radio signal to the Clas
sical Public Radio Network (CPRN) in January for $3.75 million
occurred behind closed doors between board members at USF
and CPRN. The deal was also made without the knowledge of
those in charge of the radio station's day-to-day operations, Pear
son said.
"This is an outrage not only to students who can no longer
have the access to a radio station on campus and learn about
broadcasting or music, but it's more importantly an assault on the
San Francisco community, which has come to appreciate and de
pend on the public radio services that KUSF provides," Pearson
said, adding that the price paid for KUSF is a nominal amount for
the benefits it provides to the San Francisco community on a
year-to-year basis.
CPRN, a corporation owned by the University of Southern
California (USC) and Colorado Public Radio, purchased
KUSF's radio signal in order to spread access to classical music.
But KZSU business manager Abra Jeffers, a graduate student in
management science and engineering, believes there is more to
the story.
"USC recently bought up sta
tions, from Mexico to Canada, all
along the coast under the guise of
saving classical music," Jeffers said.
"They have publicly said that they
are going to use [their radio stations]
for fundraising and publicity for
USC recruitment."
In response to the change in own
ership, Stanford has expressed sup
port for the Save KUSF movement
in San Francisco.
"We're asking for letters of pub
lic support talking about concerns
over this disruption in our broadcast
signal and we're asking that these be
sent to us so we can file an informal
objection," Jeffers said. "Basically
we're trying to help out Save KUSF;
it's in our self-interest and an impor
tant cause."
Jeffers revealed that CPRN is no
longer classified as a non-profit due
to Save KUSF efforts, and is instead
considered to be a limited liability
corporation. As a result of this re
cent change in classification, CPRN
can no longer be placed on the left
side of the radio dial, which is in
tended to be for non-commercial,
educational non-profit radio sta
tions.
Although KZSU's present con
cern is with the CPRN's recent deci
sion to move the transmitter, USF's

decision to sell KUSF to CPRN
highlights another concern among
the KZSU staff: the possibility that
the Stanford radio station may also
be sold some time in the future. In
fact, Jeffers said USC has publicly
stated its desire to acquire a South
Bay station.
The non-disclosure agreement
between USF and USC is of particu
lar concern for KZSU. Members of
KZSU are currently discussing this
matter with an intermediary board
between KZSU and Stanford's
Board of Trustees. Pearson revealed,
however, that communication be
tween the intermediary board and
the radio station is limited.
"Right now we're independent,
but because of our independence we
wouldn't know if we were sold," said
Pearson.
KZSU is currently in contact
with the chairman of the intermedi
ary board and plans to meet with
Stanford Legal in order to discuss
how to best approach this growing
concern. Suggestions have been
made to simply shift KZSU's focus
to online broadcasting. In spite of
this suggestion, Haddon stated that
this method would not reach nearly
as many listeners.
"This is a huge growing problem
for college radio stations," Haddon
said. "This recent situation makes it
a lot more real than most people re
alize and really breaks the Stanford
bubble."

KZSU programming may no longer be able to reach listeners in the North
Bay communities as new owners of KUSF plan to relocate a transmitter
serving that area. USC bought KUSF for $3.75 million in January.
