## Trustees discuss value of Farm lands 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees recently held a retreat that aimed to
do away with business as usual, focusing on several issues of
strategic importance. The three topics they discussed this year
were Stanford's land use over the next 25 years, the value of the
350-plus centers on the Farm and the potential New York City
campus.
The retreat is an annual tradition that allows the Board to
break from its traditional meetings and think about big issues
regarding the future of the University. The first issue discussed
was Stanford's long-term land use over the coming decades.
"Over the past few years, an area the Trustees have spent the
least amount of time talking about is Stanford commercial
land," said Leslie Hume, president of the Board of Trustees, in a
phone conference. Though there were no decisions made at the
meeting, Hume said the Board
members discussed the tradeoffs
between developing commercial
land for long-term income genera
tion and the impact it may have on
academic development and the
local community.
"The land use policy that is in
place was adopted by the Board al
most 22 years ago," Hume said.
She noted that the result of the
Board's discussion might "suggest
modification to the land use plan,
and help frame future agendas" for
the University Committee on Land
& Building Development.
The Board also focused on the
various centers housed at Stanford;
Hume said she and her peers main
ly focused on the 17 centers that re
port directly to the Dean of Re
search. These centers, which in
clude the Freeman-Spogli Institute
for International Studies, Bio-X
and the Clayman Institute, were ex
amined in terms of how well they
meet the challenge of initiating
multi-disciplinary study.
"We wanted to really learn more
about these centers and the risks
and opportunities they pose,"
Hume said.
She described the discussion as
"very informative and candid."
In addition to examining the
centers, the Board also participated
in a moderated panel discussion

with directors of various centers on
campus. Many of the Trustees have
been engaged with the centers and
Hume herself was an advisor at the
Clayman Institute before becom
ing chair of the Board of Trustees.
The final topic of note was the
potential New York City campus.
According to Hume, the Board re
ceived a thorough presentation
about the project and "was pleased
with the quality of the proposal."
"I think the conversation John
Hennessy will have next week with
the Academic Council will give you
a sense of the conversations he had
with the Trustees," Hume said.
The Board also received a pre
view of the site plan and the deans
of both the Business and Engineer
ing schools gave presentations
about their curricular ambitions for
the NYC campus. Hume said the
Board was able to talk over some of
their concerns with Hennessy, rang
ing from the proposed site of the
project to financial estimates and
navigating the politics of New York
City.
When asked about the new
Manzanita Park dormitories for
upperclassman, Hume said no ac
tion was taken at the recent Board
meeting regarding the issue. Ac
cording to the University's time
line, project approval should have
taken place in February of this year.
However, no action has been taken
since the original concept was pro
posed last year.
