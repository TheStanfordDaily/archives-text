## Harris talk opposes campus return of ROTC 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former student body president
and antiwar activist David Harris
'67 spoke to a group of 20 Stanford
community members Wednesday
night about his opposition to
ROTC.
The discussion, held at the
Wilbur Meeting Room and spon
sored by Stanford Says No To War,
touched on a variety of topics that
mainly focused on Harris's personal
experiences and general topics re
lated to ROTC reinstatement.
Transgender rights and the Cam
paign to Abstain were mentioned
only once by an audience member

during the hour-and-a-half talk.
"In terms of massive practical
impact, it doesn't have one," Harris
said of ROTC's potential return to
the Farm.
"But what Stanford does about it
will be a tremendous statement," he
added.
Harris, who served as student
body president from 1966-67, raised
the issue of each individual's collec
tive accountability for the military's
actions.
"We will be responsible for the
end product of all of these ROTC
officers," Harris said.
To illustrate the point, he

touched on Hannah Arendt's
"Eichmann in Jerusalem," a famous
scholarly work that examines the
manifestation of evil in the Nazi
regime. The book was published
and made its way around Stanford
in the mid-19605. Harris said one of
the book's major questions what
fellow Germans did about atroci
ties committed by their govern
ment was relevant to the United
States both during Vietnam and
today.
"ROTC is the place where we
can address this," he said.
Harris, who was imprisoned for
18 months for dodging the draft, led
a number of antiwar campaigns dur
ing his time on campus. In 1966, he
focused on selective service. In
1967, he rallied against the Univer
sity's cooperation, through re
search, with the Vietnam War effort.
However, he refused to take sig
nificant credit for ROTC's 1968 de
parture, pointing instead to a facul
ty decision on the academic merits
of the program's curriculum that led
to the program's exodus.

The question of educational vi
tality is still present today and is
among the larger issues that the cur
rent ad hoc committee on ROTC is
considering.
"Stanford is supposedly a com
munity of scholars in a search for
truth," he said. "You're not going to
learn how to think in ROTC."
Harris was also dismissive of the
logistical concerns of having Stan
ford cadets travel to other schools
for training.
"The issues are a lot bigger than
anyone's convenience," he said.
The greatest back-and-forth of
the evening occurred when Joe
Maguire 'l3 challenged Harris on a
number of points and posited that
an antiwar and anti-ROTC focus
would be more effectual if it cen
tered on civilian officials rather
than the armed forces.
"Policy needs to be addressed,
certainly," Harris said. "But my
point is that we need less military."
"What's needed here is not bet
ter-trained officers; what's needed
here is fewer officers," Harris
added. "We can't keep dealing with
the rest of the world through our
armies."
