## The
						Glory that was Greece 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Over this past spring break, I
was fortunate enough to
travel to Greece for a week
with a group of other seniors. In
spired by the stunning landscapes
portrayed in the movie version of
Mama Mia!, we impulsively pur
chased our tickets in November and
did little else. When the time for our
journey arrived, we had done almost
no preparations aside from booking
flights and hostels.

Sitting on the 11-hour flight from
SFO to Munich, I racked my brain to
come up with things I knew about
Greece. Food: I knew about the
food. Moussaka? So good. Feta
cheese? Second best cheese ever.
Hummus? Trick question. Hummus
is from the Levant, not Greece. And
knowing that, I felt adequately pre
pared.

But outside of that, I realized I
knew nothing. Who is the president
of Greece? Uhh. What would I see
in Athens in addition to the
Parthenon? My most educated
guess was: Greek people. How
would I say hello in Greek? It was all
Greek to me.

Rather, every thought pertaining
to Greece that I could dig out of my
brain was about Ancient Greece.
Greek mythology? I started reading
it in elementary school when I found
a big book of stories in my second
grade classroom. Forget knowing
the twelve Olympian gods and god
desses, there was a time when I
could describe in detail all twelve
labors of Fleracles. It doesn't stop
there. In sixth grade, we spent a unit
learning about Ancient Greece as
the foundation of Western civiliza
tions. In my freshman year of high
school, we again reviewed Ancient
Greek history, read "The Odyssey"
and addressed the accomplishments
of Ancient Greek scientists in my
physics class.
The scene at Stanford is not too
different. Many an IHUM student is

required to read a Platonic dialogue.
Freshman year I took a class on the
ancient Greek poetess Sappho.
Even the Ancient Greek alphabet
doesn't look so foreign because
we've seen the first half of it already,
albeit in our math classes. I did an
experiment earlier this week. I
searched "Greece" on Explore-
Courses and uncovered dozens of
classes pertaining to Ancient
Greece and exactly one class about
Modern Greece.
I know what you're thinking:

What would I
see in Athens in
addition to the
Parthenon? My
most educated
guess was:
Greek people
