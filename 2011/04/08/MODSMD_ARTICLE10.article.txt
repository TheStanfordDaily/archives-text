## The 						Glory that was Greece 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Over this past spring break, I
was fortunate enough to
travel to Greece for a week
with a group of other seniors. In
spired by the stunning landscapes
portrayed in the movie version of
Mama Mia!, we impulsively pur
chased our tickets in November and
did little else. When the time for our
journey arrived, we had done almost
no preparations aside from booking
flights and hostels.

Sitting on the 11-hour flight from
SFO to Munich, I racked my brain to
come up with things I knew about
Greece. Food: I knew about the
food. Moussaka? So good. Feta
cheese? Second best cheese ever.
Hummus? Trick question. Hummus
is from the Levant, not Greece. And
knowing that, I felt adequately pre
pared.

But outside of that, I realized I
knew nothing. Who is the president
of Greece? Uhh. What would I see
in Athens in addition to the
Parthenon? My most educated
guess was: Greek people. How
would I say hello in Greek? It was all
Greek to me.

Rather, every thought pertaining
to Greece that I could dig out of my
brain was about Ancient Greece.
Greek mythology? I started reading
it in elementary school when I found
a big book of stories in my second
grade classroom. Forget knowing
the twelve Olympian gods and god
desses, there was a time when I
could describe in detail all twelve
labors of Fleracles. It doesn't stop
there. In sixth grade, we spent a unit
learning about Ancient Greece as
the foundation of Western civiliza
tions. In my freshman year of high
school, we again reviewed Ancient
Greek history, read "The Odyssey"
and addressed the accomplishments
of Ancient Greek scientists in my
physics class.
The scene at Stanford is not too
different. Many an IHUM student is

required to read a Platonic dialogue.
Freshman year I took a class on the
ancient Greek poetess Sappho.
Even the Ancient Greek alphabet
doesn't look so foreign because
we've seen the first half of it already,
albeit in our math classes. I did an
experiment earlier this week. I
searched "Greece" on Explore-
Courses and uncovered dozens of
classes pertaining to Ancient
Greece and exactly one class about
Modern Greece.
I know what you're thinking:

What would I
see in Athens in
addition to the
Parthenon? My
most educated
guess was:
Greek people

Greece is totally featured as a coun
try in the present day! There are
movies about it! Haven't you seen
My Big Fat Greek Wedding? Or the
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants?!
My answer would be that it's just
not enough, especially compared to
movies like "300", the 2007 film fea
turing scantily clad Spartans bat
tling the forces of Xerxes at the Bat
tle of Thermopylae. Even the
Athens flea market boasted a num
ber of touristy shirts that bore the
title "300" as well as stores with
replicas of the helmets and shields
featured in the movie. There were,
however, no framed pictures of
Alexis Bledel.

There are lots of other examples
of this phenomenon. Rome is
known for the Coliseum, the Vati
can City, the Forum; Paris boasts the
Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the
Musee d'Orsay; Egypt can probably

be better identified by the Pyramids
of Giza than by any of its more re
cent history. But what about Berlus
coni, Sarkozy, Mubarak and the his
tory that is unfolding today?
It's funny how the information
that is given to you can shape your
expectations about things. On a
more general line of thought, how
often have you had a generalization
shattered after you based it upon
one narrow slice of information?
Maybe you had a certain idea of
how high school was supposed to be
after you watched American Pie.
Perhaps you looked at your friends'
Facebook albums wondering how
college was going to be when you
were still in high school. Or did you
watch "The Notebook" to get an
idea of how true love should be? If
you did, you were probably disap
pointed when your experiences did
n't quite match up to what you saw.
I was disappointed in the same
way when I arrived in Greece and
didn't see Archimedes running
around and shouting "Eureka!" Kind
of. I think the moments of realization
are similar. The feeling you get when

it occurs to you that the glorification
of what you've seen somewhere sets
the bar a little too high for real life
was the type of feeling I got when I re
membered that Ancient Greece was
certainly not modern Greece, that I
wouldn't see the men from "300" run
ning around the streets.
We have a habit of drawing out
the highlights of things and focusing
only upon them, then expanding our
generalizations to include them.
Particularly in the context of anoth
er country, we don't have the time in
our classrooms or the mental space
to remember every aspect of every
other place. It probably isn't fair to
suggest that teachers should cover
modern Greece and Ancient
Greece together. But it might bene
fit all of us, myself especially with re
gards to Greece, to remember that
the little we may learn about a place
is not nearly what represents the
place as a whole.

her favorite kind of cheese is. Send her

Over this past spring break, I
was fortunate enough to
travel to Greece for a week
with a group of other seniors. In
spired by the stunning landscapes
portrayed in the movie version of
Mama Mia!, we impulsively pur
chased our tickets in November and
did little else. When the time for our
journey arrived, we had done almost
no preparations aside from booking
flights and hostels.

Sitting on the 11-hour flight from
SFO to Munich, I racked my brain to
come up with things I knew about
Greece. Food: I knew about the
food. Moussaka? So good. Feta
cheese? Second best cheese ever.
Hummus? Trick question. Hummus
is from the Levant, not Greece. And
knowing that, I felt adequately pre
pared.

But outside of that, I realized I
knew nothing. Who is the president
of Greece? Uhh. What would I see
in Athens in addition to the
Parthenon? My most educated
guess was: Greek people. How
would I say hello in Greek? It was all
Greek to me.

Rather, every thought pertaining
to Greece that I could dig out of my
brain was about Ancient Greece.
Greek mythology? I started reading
it in elementary school when I found
a big book of stories in my second
grade classroom. Forget knowing
the twelve Olympian gods and god
desses, there was a time when I
could describe in detail all twelve
labors of Fleracles. It doesn't stop
there. In sixth grade, we spent a unit
learning about Ancient Greece as
the foundation of Western civiliza
tions. In my freshman year of high
school, we again reviewed Ancient
Greek history, read "The Odyssey"
and addressed the accomplishments
of Ancient Greek scientists in my
physics class.
The scene at Stanford is not too
different. Many an IHUM student is

required to read a Platonic dialogue.
Freshman year I took a class on the
ancient Greek poetess Sappho.
Even the Ancient Greek alphabet
doesn't look so foreign because
we've seen the first half of it already,
albeit in our math classes. I did an
experiment earlier this week. I
searched "Greece" on Explore-
Courses and uncovered dozens of
classes pertaining to Ancient
Greece and exactly one class about
Modern Greece.
I know what you're thinking:

What would I
see in Athens in
addition to the
Parthenon? My
most educated
guess was:
Greek people

Greece is totally featured as a coun
try in the present day! There are
movies about it! Haven't you seen
My Big Fat Greek Wedding? Or the
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants?!
My answer would be that it's just
not enough, especially compared to
movies like "300", the 2007 film fea
turing scantily clad Spartans bat
tling the forces of Xerxes at the Bat
tle of Thermopylae. Even the
Athens flea market boasted a num
ber of touristy shirts that bore the
title "300" as well as stores with
replicas of the helmets and shields
featured in the movie. There were,
however, no framed pictures of
Alexis Bledel.

There are lots of other examples
of this phenomenon. Rome is
known for the Coliseum, the Vati
can City, the Forum; Paris boasts the
Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the
Musee d'Orsay; Egypt can probably

be better identified by the Pyramids
of Giza than by any of its more re
cent history. But what about Berlus
coni, Sarkozy, Mubarak and the his
tory that is unfolding today?
It's funny how the information
that is given to you can shape your
expectations about things. On a
more general line of thought, how
often have you had a generalization
shattered after you based it upon
one narrow slice of information?
Maybe you had a certain idea of
how high school was supposed to be
after you watched American Pie.
Perhaps you looked at your friends'
Facebook albums wondering how
college was going to be when you
were still in high school. Or did you
watch "The Notebook" to get an
idea of how true love should be? If
you did, you were probably disap
pointed when your experiences did
n't quite match up to what you saw.
I was disappointed in the same
way when I arrived in Greece and
didn't see Archimedes running
around and shouting "Eureka!" Kind
of. I think the moments of realization
are similar. The feeling you get when

it occurs to you that the glorification
of what you've seen somewhere sets
the bar a little too high for real life
was the type of feeling I got when I re
membered that Ancient Greece was
certainly not modern Greece, that I
wouldn't see the men from "300" run
ning around the streets.
