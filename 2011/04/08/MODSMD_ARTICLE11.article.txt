# ROTC OP-EDS
## The
						Civilian-Military Divide and ROTC 
### DANNY COLLIG AN President emeritus, Stanford Says No to War 
Much has been made of the so-called civilian-mili
tary divide (henceforth CMD), including in a re
cent letter that Condoleezza Rice and George
Shultz wrote to the ROTC committee. Such a discussion
begs three questions: (1) what is this divide? (2) is it a prob
lem? (3) if so, what is the remedy?
The CMD means, as far as I can tell, that civilians re
main ignorant about the gruesome realities of war. This is
surely a true characteristic of American society. Few are
aware of the damage that conflict does to American sol
diers, especially the psychological damage that drives
many to suicide. Rare is the civilian who knows the extent
of the terrorism that the U.S. military regularly perpetrates
on civilian populations, as in the drone strikes and night
raids in Afghanistan. And how infrequently the media
broadcasts that incidents like the "Collateral Murder" ex
posed by WikiLeaks are not exceptions, but common
place.
Now, is this ignorance a problem? It certainly is. Be
cause the population thinks of an aggressive war more as
a grand adventure than a criminal act, ideologues like Rice
are able to brazenly take the lives of Americans, Afghans
and Iraqis to advance their rapacious political agenda. It is
for this reason that administrations take great pains to en
sure the truth about war does not reach the domestic pop
ulation. Images of dead or captured soldiers are essential
ly banned from U.S. airwaves, ugly stories about killed
NFL stars are meticulously covered up and unembedded
reporters likeTariq Ayoub are murdered by the US for the
heinous crime of trying to penetrate the vast shroud of
credulity and deceit. Much better to have embedded re
porters who are effectively told what to report by the mil
itary and who might, coincidentally, lose their access or
even their lives if they utter a word of criticism.
How should we as a society shatter this ignorance
about the U.S. military? If one takes the arguments of the
pro-return crowd to their logical conclusion, a great way to
eliminate the CMD would be a draft. This, however, has
the unfortunate side effect of making the public take an in
terest in politics. This terrifying prospect must be avoided,
our leaders reason, lest the American populace take a cue
from the Tunisians and Egyptians and try to participate
meaningfully in their so-called democracy.
Rice et al therefore advocate that we invite the military
into our school to learn from its members. But we will
learn about the military from ROTC affiliates the same
way that the public learns about the military from embed
ded reporters. That is, without a word of principled criti
cism. Which is, of course, the whole point of embedding the
military inside an institution whose individuals are most
likely to take an objection to the armed forces' present

constitution to normalize youngsters to a military pres
ence and apologetics for its violence early.
It is tough to sway any cadet with these arguments. As
Upton Sinclair put it, "It is difficult to get a man to under
stand something, when his salary depends upon his not un
derstanding it." All the more reason for Stanford to refuse
to legitimize an institution that obstructs critical inquiry.
To anyone not nursing an axiomatic belief in the supreme
inherent goodness of the U.S. military, however, I say the
CMD should be bridged with education, not embedding.
This column is a step in that direction.
Rebecca Young's Wednesday op-ed also touched on
the CMD. She begins by stating, "ROTC's absence from
this campus has removed a critical mode of discourse be
tween the military and the civilian population it serves," as
if a military base on campus would finally allow cadets to
critically probe their beliefs and actions. In fact, cadets
have shunned the opportunity, withdrawing from a Janu
ary discussion with Stanford Says No to War and others
before it happened. Is it the supposed "intolerance, xeno
phobia and isolationism" of SSNW that worries cadets
most, or an honest examination of what the military means
for Stanford, American society and victims of conflict?
Whenever Young or a comrade wants to explore that
question, the members of SSNW (who, I promise, are very
friendly! No need to be afraid!) would be glad to talk.
