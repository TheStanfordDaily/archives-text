# ROTC and Women
## 
### ANN THOMPSON '11 
The six female ROTC cadets and midshipmen at
Stanford are baffled by news that the Women's
Coalition (WoCo), a body that claims to represent a
wide swath of women's student organizations, is actively
opposing the return of ROTC to campus. Like the WoCo,
our small female cadet contingent at Stanford is made up
of strong women who actively and passionately support
female advancement, rights and opportunities, especially
in the male-dominated institution in which we've chosen
to serve. We know from history and experience that Stan
ford women thrive in the military, and we earnestly hope
for ROTC's return to campus so that more women will
have the opportunity to benefit from this program.
Personally, the military has done wonders for my
growth and development. Far from advocating that I learn
to think and act like a man, it has encouraged me to bring
my feminine perspective to various challenges, such as
how to mentor a struggling cadet or how to engage with fe
male civilians in a hypothetical deployment scenario. I
have grown tremendously in confidence, knowing that I
can jump from planes, compete on a co-ed marathon team
