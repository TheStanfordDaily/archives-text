# ROTC and Women
## 
### ANN THOMPSON '11 
The six female ROTC cadets and midshipmen at
Stanford are baffled by news that the Women's
Coalition (WoCo), a body that claims to represent a
wide swath of women's student organizations, is actively
opposing the return of ROTC to campus. Like the WoCo,
our small female cadet contingent at Stanford is made up
of strong women who actively and passionately support
female advancement, rights and opportunities, especially
in the male-dominated institution in which we've chosen
to serve. We know from history and experience that Stan
ford women thrive in the military, and we earnestly hope
for ROTC's return to campus so that more women will
have the opportunity to benefit from this program.
Personally, the military has done wonders for my
growth and development. Far from advocating that I learn
to think and act like a man, it has encouraged me to bring
my feminine perspective to various challenges, such as
how to mentor a struggling cadet or how to engage with fe
male civilians in a hypothetical deployment scenario. I
have grown tremendously in confidence, knowing that I
can jump from planes, compete on a co-ed marathon team
or command a battalion of 90 cadets
as easily as my male counterparts.
Far from discriminating against
females, the military holds us to the
same standards as male soldiers, ex
cept where physical capabilities are a
serious consideration. We don't re
ceive special treatment, a fact that
continually reinforces my confidence
in my capabilities. When I make a
mistake in training, I do push-ups.
When I am struggling to get to the top
of the rope, I receive loud shouts of
encouragement rather than discour
aging comments like, "Oh well,
you're not expected to do that." Dis
criminatory attitudes are simply not
tolerated in today's military.
The females I know and regularly
read about have proven themselves
up to the military's challenges. In
2005, Sergeant Leigh Anne Hester
received the Silver Star for her hero
ic actions during an enemy ambush
on a supply convoy in Iraq. In 2009,
two females were at the top of their
class at West Point and were both
named Rhodes Scholars. Amongst
female Stanford cadets, Aly Gleason
'l3 has worked as the Physical Fit
ness Officer, planning and imple
menting workouts for her entire De
tachment at San Jose State. Captain
Diana Clough Benton 'O7 received
her commission from the President.
Lieutenant Ally Ha 'O9 still holds the
all-time highest physical fitness
score for my Battalion. And during
my time in Army ROTC, three out
of four cadet Battalion Comman
ders have been women.

The Army also does a great job of
accommodating us when necessary,
providing women with separate
quarters, appropriate grooming
standards and free child care assis
tance, for instance. It takes issues of
equal opportunity and sexual assault
very seriously. According to The
New York Times,"since 2004 the De
fense Department has radically
changed the way it handles sexual
abuse in the military, including en
couraging victims to come forward,
expanding access to treatment and
toughening standards for prosecu
tion."

The modern U.S. military needs
the positive contributions of
women, and Stanford has a tremen
dous opportunity to help train fu
ture Officers. Stanford-educated of
ficers can uphold military women's
rights, as we go on to influence sol
diers in the units we command. We
will make conscientious and ethical
decisions wherever we serve. We will
influence the current debate on
women in combat. My dream job is
to work on a Female Engagement
Team, a small group of women at
tached to dismounted patrols, whose
mission is to provide community
based humanitarian assistance and
engage with local women in a cultur
ally sensitive manner. The military is
making tremendous strides toward
developing and utilizing women's
unique capabilities. It's an exciting
time for any Stanford graduate to be
involved in implementing these de
velopments.
Stanford women also have much
to gain from an ROTC program on
campus. Not only will more females
be able to take advantage of valu
able leadership training, but the
broader women's community will
also benefit from increased dialogue
with future officers on stated issues
of concern to the WoCo:
transwomen's rights and sexual as
sault within the military.
Four years ago, as a shy but curi
ous freshman on the Farm, I decided
to try Army ROTC. Countless com
mutes, classes and training events
later, I've attained greater confi
dence, stronger values, closer com
munity, more opportunities and a
nobler sense of purpose than I ever
imagined possible in the military. As

this year's Army ROTC Battalion
Commander, I've found that the sky
is the limit for female soldiers today
in our chosen profession. Now, as I
prepare to commission as an Army
Second Lieutenant in June, I could
n't be more satisfied with that initial
decision or prouder of the fact that
I've completed the challenging pro
gram. I've spoken with a number of
talented Stanford women who are
also genuinely interested in partici
pating in ROTC but are sadly un
able to do so, due to our frequent,
long commutes to other campuses.
Please join me in supporting
these Stanford women who desire to
serve, lead, and impact by voting
"yes" on ROTC.

Coalition (WoCo), a body that claims to represent a
wide swath of women's student organizations, is actively
opposing the return of ROTC to campus. Like the WoCo,
our small female cadet contingent at Stanford is made up
of strong women who actively and passionately support
female advancement, rights and opportunities, especially
in the male-dominated institution in which we've chosen
to serve. We know from history and experience that Stan
ford women thrive in the military, and we earnestly hope
for ROTC's return to campus so that more women will
have the opportunity to benefit from this program.
Personally, the military has done wonders for my
growth and development. Far from advocating that I learn
to think and act like a man, it has encouraged me to bring
my feminine perspective to various challenges, such as
how to mentor a struggling cadet or how to engage with fe
male civilians in a hypothetical deployment scenario. I
have grown tremendously in confidence, knowing that I
can jump from planes, compete on a co-ed marathon team
or command a battalion of 90 cadets
as easily as my male counterparts.
Far from discriminating against
females, the military holds us to the
same standards as male soldiers, ex
cept where physical capabilities are a
serious consideration. We don't re
ceive special treatment, a fact that
continually reinforces my confidence
in my capabilities. When I make a
mistake in training, I do push-ups.
When I am struggling to get to the top
of the rope, I receive loud shouts of
encouragement rather than discour
aging comments like, "Oh well,
you're not expected to do that." Dis
criminatory attitudes are simply not
tolerated in today's military.
The females I know and regularly
read about have proven themselves
up to the military's challenges. In
2005, Sergeant Leigh Anne Hester
received the Silver Star for her hero
ic actions during an enemy ambush
on a supply convoy in Iraq. In 2009,
two females were at the top of their
class at West Point and were both
named Rhodes Scholars. Amongst
female Stanford cadets, Aly Gleason
'l3 has worked as the Physical Fit
ness Officer, planning and imple
menting workouts for her entire De
tachment at San Jose State. Captain
Diana Clough Benton 'O7 received
her commission from the President.
Lieutenant Ally Ha 'O9 still holds the
all-time highest physical fitness
score for my Battalion. And during
my time in Army ROTC, three out
of four cadet Battalion Comman
ders have been women.

The Army also does a great job of
accommodating us when necessary,
providing women with separate
quarters, appropriate grooming
standards and free child care assis
tance, for instance. It takes issues of
equal opportunity and sexual assault
very seriously. According to The
New York Times,"since 2004 the De
fense Department has radically
changed the way it handles sexual
abuse in the military, including en
couraging victims to come forward,
expanding access to treatment and
toughening standards for prosecu
tion."

The modern U.S. military needs
the positive contributions of
women, and Stanford has a tremen
dous opportunity to help train fu
ture Officers. Stanford-educated of
ficers can uphold military women's
rights, as we go on to influence sol
diers in the units we command. We
will make conscientious and ethical
decisions wherever we serve. We will
influence the current debate on
women in combat. My dream job is
to work on a Female Engagement
Team, a small group of women at
tached to dismounted patrols, whose
mission is to provide community
based humanitarian assistance and
engage with local women in a cultur
ally sensitive manner. The military is
making tremendous strides toward
developing and utilizing women's
unique capabilities. It's an exciting
time for any Stanford graduate to be
involved in implementing these de
velopments.
Stanford women also have much
to gain from an ROTC program on
campus. Not only will more females
be able to take advantage of valu
able leadership training, but the
broader women's community will
also benefit from increased dialogue
with future officers on stated issues
of concern to the WoCo:
transwomen's rights and sexual as
sault within the military.
Four years ago, as a shy but curi
ous freshman on the Farm, I decided
to try Army ROTC. Countless com
mutes, classes and training events
later, I've attained greater confi
dence, stronger values, closer com
munity, more opportunities and a
nobler sense of purpose than I ever
imagined possible in the military. As

this year's Army ROTC Battalion
Commander, I've found that the sky
is the limit for female soldiers today
in our chosen profession. Now, as I
prepare to commission as an Army
Second Lieutenant in June, I could
n't be more satisfied with that initial
decision or prouder of the fact that
I've completed the challenging pro
gram. I've spoken with a number of
talented Stanford women who are
also genuinely interested in partici
pating in ROTC but are sadly un
able to do so, due to our frequent,
long commutes to other campuses.
Please join me in supporting
these Stanford women who desire to
serve, lead, and impact by voting
"yes" on ROTC.
