## Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow, Black and Yellow 
### Kristian Bailey 
Yesterday was Thursday
(Thursday); today, it is Friday
(Friday); me, me, me so excited
me so excited, me gonna have a
ball today. Please forgive me, but
when else am I going to be able to use
such horrible syntax and get away
with alluding to Rebecca Black in a
respectable publication? And be
sides, there are so many things to be
excited about:

I have a fresh new set of classes
(ITAL2O with Giovanni Tempesta is
the best thing ever and everyone
should study Italian just to take this
class), and I'm taking IntroSems for
the first time; the SLE curriculum is
moving into the modern era I'm fa
miliar with even less of the texts than I
was last quarter and am looking for
ward to expanding my repertoire.
East Flo played "The Game" last
weekend, which was one of the best
experiences of my Stanford life (as
was Band Run, Part II it's much
better when you know what to do be
forehand ...). After lots of doubting
and hedging, I submitted my preas
signment application for Casa Italiana
and already can't wait to find out if
miei amici and I get into our desired
houses on the Row (I'm really looking
forward to knowing people in all the
good houses on campus); I had my
first Pro Fro on Tuesday and am psy
ched for one of my best friends to
come to Admit Weekend and be com

pletely unbiased about where she
goes (come to Stanford!); I get to see
Stanford Football on Saturday at the
Cardinal and White Game howev
er unofficial it is, that one loyalty point
would have saved me $l7 and the im
mense dread I felt when I thought I
couldn't go to Big Game and
Sophomore College applications are
due on Monday.To top it all off I don't
have classes on Friday.
Essentially, life is progressing in a
beautiful way. Fall quarter was like a
fairytale everyday, there was
something new to be excited about
and winter quarter was, well, winter
quarter. If the fact that it was cold (in
the 50s), cloudy and rainy the entirety
of spring break (which I decided to
spend in California/the Bay Area/at
Stanford) epitomizes winter quarter,
the fact that literally the first day of
spring quarter, the forecast magically
became sunny and hot shows that
even Nature knows spring quarter's
where it's at. The words, "Look at the
stars look how they shine for you"
never rang truer. Thank God.
But seriously. On the other hand,
though, the year feels like it's already
over. It is very difficult to realize that
eight weeks is a comparatively long
period of time, especially given how
the weeks seem to fly by in the quar
ter system.

Part of me worries that I won't be
able to maximize the experiences I

want to have in the quarter spend
ing time in the dorm with the always
excellent residents of Alondra; appre
ciating the unique intellectual oppor
tunity afforded by SLE (and wanting
to delay becoming a "regular" Stan
ford student as long as possible);
spending time with my beyond-won
derful roommate and making the
most of our final weeks living together;
spending time with my friends before
going home for the summer (I can't
even begin to fathom what that will be
like), while trying to meet new great
people; staying fit and taking advan
tage of all of Stanford's athletic, cultur
al and academic events being able
to do all of this concerns me.

To that end, my best friend and I,
inspired by her mother, decided to
declare "resolutions" (which I re
named "concrete objectives") for
spring quarter. Our shortlist is as fol
lows:
Academic Objectives

1) Get up at 8 every (weekday)

morning, go running around Lag and
eat breakfast;
2) Spend two solid hours each
morning/afternoon doing work and
an hour at night in the CoHo to finish
it up;
3) Finish all the week's SLE read
ing by the start o/Tuesday's first lec
ture (we don't have discussion sec
tion until Wednesday, so this is quite
admirable);
4) Arrive to all classes early;
5) Be in bed by 2 a.m.
Personal Objectives
1) Go on weekend/day trips at
least twice a month;
2) Visit The Dish at least once a
month;
3) To go to EBF every Wednesday
(I left space for it my for-the-first
time printed quarter calendar).
We got up at 8 and ran the first

three mornings of the quarter
even though we had decided our res
olutions needn't officially go into ef
fect until week two just to prove to
a doubtful friend that we could com
mit. Then Band Run happened and
while she's run every day so far, yes
terday was the first time I've run since
then.

But just as I realize I shouldn't
sweat maximizing my time, I am also
not beating myself up for not meeting
these objectives I'm still fulfilling
the spirit of the "abstract ideals" on
which these objectives were based.
I'm sleeping and waking up relative
ly earlier, eating breakfast, concen
trating more on my work (though
with frequent interruptions to sun on
FloMo field), being social and gener
ally having a blast.
And while the forecast is sadly just
in 60s this coming week, I'm still opti
mistic. Just look at the stars, Stanford
look how they shine for you. And
it was all yellow...

Upset at the Coldplay reference? Yell at
Kristian at kbailey@stanford.edu. But
please, no anti-Rebecca Black emails.

spending time with my friends before
going home for the summer (I can't
even begin to fathom what that will be
like), while trying to meet new great
people; staying fit and taking advan
tage of all of Stanford's athletic, cultur
al and academic events being able
to do all of this concerns me.

To that end, my best friend and I,
inspired by her mother, decided to
declare "resolutions" (which I re
named "concrete objectives") for
spring quarter. Our shortlist is as fol
lows:
Academic Objectives

1) Get up at 8 every (weekday)

morning, go running around Lag and
eat breakfast;
2) Spend two solid hours each
morning/afternoon doing work and
an hour at night in the CoHo to finish
it up;
3) Finish all the week's SLE read
ing by the start o/Tuesday's first lec
ture (we don't have discussion sec
tion until Wednesday, so this is quite
admirable);
4) Arrive to all classes early;
5) Be in bed by 2 a.m.
Personal Objectives
1) Go on weekend/day trips at
least twice a month;
2) Visit The Dish at least once a
month;
3) To go to EBF every Wednesday
(I left space for it my for-the-first
time printed quarter calendar).
We got up at 8 and ran the first

three mornings of the quarter
even though we had decided our res
olutions needn't officially go into ef
fect until week two just to prove to
a doubtful friend that we could com
mit. Then Band Run happened and
while she's run every day so far, yes
terday was the first time I've run since
then.

But just as I realize I shouldn't
sweat maximizing my time, I am also
not beating myself up for not meeting
these objectives I'm still fulfilling
the spirit of the "abstract ideals" on
which these objectives were based.
I'm sleeping and waking up relative
ly earlier, eating breakfast, concen
trating more on my work (though
with frequent interruptions to sun on
FloMo field), being social and gener
ally having a blast.
And while the forecast is sadly just
in 60s this coming week, I'm still opti
mistic. Just look at the stars, Stanford
look how they shine for you. And
it was all yellow...

Upset at the Coldplay reference? Yell at
Kristian at kbailey@stanford.edu. But
please, no anti-Rebecca Black emails.
Yesterday was Thursday
(Thursday); today, it is Friday
(Friday); me, me, me so excited
me so excited, me gonna have a
ball today. Please forgive me, but
when else am I going to be able to use
such horrible syntax and get away
with alluding to Rebecca Black in a
respectable publication? And be
sides, there are so many things to be
excited about:

I have a fresh new set of classes
(ITAL2O with Giovanni Tempesta is
the best thing ever and everyone
should study Italian just to take this
class), and I'm taking IntroSems for
the first time; the SLE curriculum is
moving into the modern era I'm fa
miliar with even less of the texts than I
was last quarter and am looking for
ward to expanding my repertoire.
East Flo played "The Game" last
weekend, which was one of the best
experiences of my Stanford life (as
was Band Run, Part II it's much
better when you know what to do be
forehand ...). After lots of doubting
and hedging, I submitted my preas
signment application for Casa Italiana
and already can't wait to find out if
miei amici and I get into our desired
houses on the Row (I'm really looking
forward to knowing people in all the
good houses on campus); I had my
first Pro Fro on Tuesday and am psy
ched for one of my best friends to
come to Admit Weekend and be com

pletely unbiased about where she
goes (come to Stanford!); I get to see
Stanford Football on Saturday at the
Cardinal and White Game howev
er unofficial it is, that one loyalty point
would have saved me $l7 and the im
mense dread I felt when I thought I
couldn't go to Big Game and
Sophomore College applications are
due on Monday.To top it all off I don't
have classes on Friday.
Essentially, life is progressing in a
beautiful way. Fall quarter was like a
fairytale everyday, there was
something new to be excited about
and winter quarter was, well, winter
quarter. If the fact that it was cold (in
the 50s), cloudy and rainy the entirety
of spring break (which I decided to
spend in California/the Bay Area/at
Stanford) epitomizes winter quarter,
the fact that literally the first day of
spring quarter, the forecast magically
became sunny and hot shows that
even Nature knows spring quarter's
where it's at. The words, "Look at the
stars look how they shine for you"
never rang truer. Thank God.
But seriously. On the other hand,
though, the year feels like it's already
over. It is very difficult to realize that
eight weeks is a comparatively long
period of time, especially given how
the weeks seem to fly by in the quar
ter system.

Part of me worries that I won't be
able to maximize the experiences I

want to have in the quarter spend
ing time in the dorm with the always
excellent residents of Alondra; appre
ciating the unique intellectual oppor
tunity afforded by SLE (and wanting
to delay becoming a "regular" Stan
ford student as long as possible);
spending time with my beyond-won
derful roommate and making the
most of our final weeks living together;
spending time with my friends before
going home for the summer (I can't
even begin to fathom what that will be
like), while trying to meet new great
people; staying fit and taking advan
tage of all of Stanford's athletic, cultur
al and academic events being able
