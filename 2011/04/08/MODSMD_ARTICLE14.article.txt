## MOVING ON UP STANFORD GAINS MOMENTUM 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team, com
ing off four consecutive impressive victo
ries, heads up to the Pacific Northwest
this weekend to take on the highly-re
garded Washington Huskies on Friday
and the Oregon Ducks on Saturday. The
No. 9 Cardinal (12-5,2-1 Pac 10) is com
ing off commanding wins against No. 29
San Diego, No. 56 Arizona, No. 31 Tulsa
and No. 13 UCLA.

The current winning streak for Stan
ford is all the more impressive since it has
come after an uncharacteristically sloppy
stretch of play in which the squad
dropped three straight matches, albeit
against the very stiff competition of No. 3
USC and No. 16 Baylor. The Stanford
men's tennis team, accustomed to such a
high degree of success, is not used to sur
rendering many matches let alone
three in a row. The fact that the squad has
been able to bounce back so effectively
speaks volumes about the resiliency and
resolve of head coach John Whitlinger's
group.

The Washington Huskies, ranked No.
22 nationally, are in the midst of their
own losing streak, having dropped their
last three matches. As the Cardinal now
knows though, this fact just means that
the Huskies will be hungrier than ever
for a chance to defeat their Pac-10 rivals.
The Cardinal has long been a vexing op
ponent for Washington the two
longest tenured Huskies, seniors Tobi
Obenaus and Martin Kildahl, have never
defeated Stanford. This Friday presents
their final chance to do so.
Under head coach Matt Anger, now
in his 17th season, the Huskies have been
a model of consistency, never once miss
ing the NCAA Championships while
coming out of the always-competitive

Pac-10 conference. The Fluskies are
in good position to make the tour
nament again this year which
will be held at Stanford's Taube Ten
nis Center at the end of May and
will try to make it back to the round
of sixteen, which they have done an
impressive five times since 2000.
Saturday's match will see the Car
dinal in Eugene, Ore. to take on the
pesky No. 70 ranked Oregon Ducks.
The Ducks finished their final road
trip of the dual-match season in Los
Angeles last weekend, and now are

returning home for a season-ending
three-match homestand. The Ducks
didn't play their best tennis in L.A.,
losing a very close match to Loyola
Marymount before getting blown
out by Pac-10 stalwarts USC and
UCLA. The Ducks will be looking
for some conference revenge this
weekend when they take on Cal at
home on Friday before Stanford
comes calling on Saturday.
The Ducks are anchored by
three key newcomers: freshmen
Robin Cambier and Alex Rovello
and junior transfer Baptiste Faynot.
The two freshmen at the top of their
singles lineup have been impressive
this year, holding a combined 21-14
mark in dual-match singles play. As
many of Stanford's opponents have

been this year, the Ducks team is
made up primarily of foreign play
ers, with France and Belgium being
the home countries for most of the
Oregon squad.
Stanford has six dual matches re
maining before the madness of the
Pac-10 championships and then the
NCAAs begin. This weekend's trip
will mark the final time this season
that the Cardinal will be traveling
outside of the state of California
the important, final road trip for the
seniors on the team. The Cardinal is
looking to make this final road trip
the beginning of a successful start to
the end of their year.
