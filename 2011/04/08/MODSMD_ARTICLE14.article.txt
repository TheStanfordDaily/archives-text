## MOVING ON UP STANFORD GAINS MOMENTUM 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team, com
ing off four consecutive impressive victo
ries, heads up to the Pacific Northwest
this weekend to take on the highly-re
garded Washington Huskies on Friday
and the Oregon Ducks on Saturday. The
No. 9 Cardinal (12-5,2-1 Pac 10) is com
ing off commanding wins against No. 29
San Diego, No. 56 Arizona, No. 31 Tulsa
and No. 13 UCLA.

The current winning streak for Stan
ford is all the more impressive since it has
come after an uncharacteristically sloppy
stretch of play in which the squad
dropped three straight matches, albeit
against the very stiff competition of No. 3
USC and No. 16 Baylor. The Stanford
men's tennis team, accustomed to such a
high degree of success, is not used to sur
rendering many matches let alone
three in a row. The fact that the squad has
been able to bounce back so effectively
speaks volumes about the resiliency and
resolve of head coach John Whitlinger's
group.

The Washington Huskies, ranked No.
22 nationally, are in the midst of their
own losing streak, having dropped their
last three matches. As the Cardinal now
knows though, this fact just means that
the Huskies will be hungrier than ever
for a chance to defeat their Pac-10 rivals.
The Cardinal has long been a vexing op
ponent for Washington the two
longest tenured Huskies, seniors Tobi
Obenaus and Martin Kildahl, have never
defeated Stanford. This Friday presents
their final chance to do so.
Under head coach Matt Anger, now
in his 17th season, the Huskies have been
a model of consistency, never once miss
ing the NCAA Championships while
coming out of the always-competitive
