# WOMEN'S TENNIS
## Top-ranked Card still looking to improve 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The regular season is starting to
wind down but for the nation's No.
1 Stanford women's tennis team,
but that doesn't mean the compe
tition gets any easier. This week
end the Cardinal faces No. 71 Fres
no State before taking on a tough
Washington team, currently No. 23
in the nation.
"We've been playing very well
in that February period, but it's al
ways a little tricky around winter
quarter finals," said Stanford head
coach Lele Forood. "[The players]
can't practice and people are busy
with work. We're not really firing
on all cylinders when we start play
ing again over spring break, but
what helps is that we're a resilient
group. We're starting to look like
who we were back in February."
Fresno State is coming off a
tough 4-3 loss to No. 23 Pepper
dine and got a surprise upset win in
doubles, but eventually lost four
matches in singles to lose the day.
The team's top singles player is
freshman Marianna Jodoin,
ranked 79th in the nation.
"They're always an interesting
match up," Forood said. "We
haven't played them for a couple
years. They usually have a differ
ent collection of players. They've
been very strong in doubles in the
past."
With Stanford's depth in sin
gles, which includes players like
No. 4 Flilary Barte, No. 12 Nicole
Gibbs, No. 17 Kristie Ahn, No. 22
Mallory Burdette and No. 55
Stacey Tan, the Cardinal promises
to put up quite a fight for the visi
tors. Stanford also has the No. 2
ranked doubles team in Barte and
Burdette and the 30th ranked
team in Ahn and fellow freshman
Nicole Gibbs.
Washington will provide a big
ger challenge for the Cardinal. The
Huskies have two players that
have dominated singles play so far
this year. No. 5 Denise Dy and No.
23 Venise Chan have each only lost
once in dual singles play all year,
amassing a combined record of 17-
1 between the two of them. The
two combine to be the 10th
ranked doubles team in the coun
try, promising a tough match for
Barte and Burdette.

"They've always had outstand
ing talent at the top of their line
up," Forood said. "That's a signa
ture of theirs going back as far as I
can remember. The last couple
years, they've had the depth to be
able to play with the top teams.
This year they're as good at the top
but maybe not quite as deep."
Dy has proved to be a powerful
contender for this Stanford squad.
Twice last year, Dy defeated Barte
in tournament play as well as
once in a dual match and won
out over Gibbs back in fall at the
National Indoors Championships.
Last year's matchup in Seattle was
a close call for the Cardinal, as it
barely eked out a 4-3 win in one of
Washington's best matches of the
year.
"For me, [losing] factors more
into practice," Barte said. "More
incentive, more motivation to
work harder and work on certain
things so that in the match, when I
play that girl again, I'm more pre
pared and more solid for her. Dur
ing the actual competition, I'm not
really thinking about that stuff."
"It's always a tough match,"
Forood said. "They know each
other really well. They have been
playing with and against each
other their whole career. They're
extremely familiar with each
other. I think Hilary is going to do
outstanding on Saturday and I
look for her to win that match."
Despite the increasingly tough
competition, the Huskies have
failed to muster a win against Stan
ford in 21 meetings. Washington's
highest ranking this season was
No. 15. Stanford, meanwhile, has
remained undefeated throughout
the year. The team dropped to No.
2 for a short period due to some
technicalities in how rankings are
decided, but has since returned to
its spot atop the nation.
"The team is really excited,"
Barte said. "Today in practice we
said there were 43 days until
NCAAs, 17 team practices left, so
now that we see the light at the end
of the tunnel, we're going to kick it
into higher gear."
The team plays today at 1:30
p.m. at Taube Tennis Stadium and
on Saturday at 12:00 p.m.
