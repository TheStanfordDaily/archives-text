# Time to get your golden tickets
## 
### Tom Taylor 
A couple of weeks ago, tickets for the
2012 Olympic Games to be held in
London went on sale in the UK, and
as the lucky owner of both a British
passport and a VISA card whose
sponsorship has handed them a monopoly over
how tickets can be paid for this is my chance to
get a slice of next year's Olympic action.
Helpfully, though, the whole process is not
quite as straightforward as your run
of-the-mill ticket transaction. Firstly,
the window for buying tickets only
lasts for a couple more weeks. Second
ly, tickets will be assigned by ballot, so I
may not get all the tickets I request.
However and this is where I have to
be careful there is a chance that I
may indeed get all of those tickets.
That might not sound like a bad
thing, but with all payments made via
the aforementioned credit card com
pany, I could suddenly find myself in
some serious financial hot water. In
fact, the cost for each successful ticket
request will be deducted from my
credit card long before I even find out
which tickets I have been assigned.
And reselling any unwanted tickets
may be a bit of a minefield too, because
this will only be allowed through an of
ficial website that doesn't even exist
yet.
Now, besides moaning about the
ticketing system, this finally gets me to
the point of this week's column. With
hundreds of events at every Summer
Olympics, what should I go see?
Athletics is the spiritual core of the
Games, and the Olympic stadium is its
beating heart. The centerpiece events
in that ground will probably be the
opening and closing ceremonies and
the 100 m final, but I'll happily forgo all
three. They are all likely to be oversub
scribed, and the tickets located any
where near the action are far out of my
price range. It will probably be better
to watch them on TV.

But there are a lot more things
scheduled for the stadium than just
those three, and even without seeing a
crucial final, there are still classification
heats in which the world's top athletes
will be competing. In fact, there is defi
nitely something to be said for watch
ing those instead. The Olympics is not
simply about watching the best, but
also watching men and women from
remote corners of the globe who've

won the honor to represent their coun
try on the biggest stage.
Outside of the walls of the stadium,
there's a lot more action f'd love to see.
Apart from the chance to cheer on all
of the Brits —as hosts, the UK can
enter an athlete or team in every disci
pline there are sports that are syn
onymous with the Olympics, from the
obviously athletic pursuits like swim
ming and track cycling to the high
speed blur of professional table tennis.
There are, though, some events that
I will avoid like the plague. I have ab
solutely no interest in Olympic soccer
because no one, especially in Britain,
really cares. Partly because it's
nowhere near as important as the
World Cup or the European Champi
onship which will be contested less
than a month before the Games start
and also because there is no such
thing as a British national soccer team.
The four nations that make up the
UK compete separately in interna
tional competition, and thus cannot
normally qualify. This time around we
will have a team, but it will be entirely
English, as the other three countries
justifiably refused to take part.
So that's athletics, swimming, cy
cling and, uh, table tennis. These might
not be sports that 1 usually follow, but
that's sort of the point of the Olympics:
it's a true festival of the sporting world.
Whether I'm ultimately successful
in any of my ticket applications or not,
it's hard not to feel real excitement
about the Games, even though they
are still such a long way away. It was
long before I was born that the world's
top two sports tournaments were last
held in the UK, those being the
Olympics and the World Cup in 1948
and 1966, respectively.There is a pretty
good chance there won't be another
one in my lifetime, so this is probably
my one and only chance to grab a slice
of history and a few unforgettable
memories.
