# ROTC-A Call for Inclusion
## 
### ANGELINA CARDONA '11, ASSU PRESIDENT 
On the topic of ROTC, our
campus is divided. It is ap
parent with the emails on list
serves, flyers, rallies, petitions, opin
ion editorials and conversations in
our classes and dorms. At the ROTC
town hall in January, it was clear that
the two-hour discussion was more
than just an intellectual debate
for many this was personal. In the
final phases of this discussion lead
ing up to the Faculty Senate presen
tation by the ROTC Ad Hoc Com
mittee on May 12th, we must move
forward as a community with an un
precedented level of sensitivity in
our discourse, because the decision
on ROTC will inevitably end up
hurting part of our Stanford family.
As student body president, it has
been nearly impossible to represent
a unified student position about the
possible reinstatement of ROTC at
Stanford. This is what led me to pro
pose the non-binding referendum
on the annual ASSU ballot: "Adviso
ry Question A" asks you to state
your stance on ROTC's potential re
instatement. I offer my personal
stance to contribute to the dialogue
and to push our collective and indi
vidual thinking on this issue. While I
firmly believe in the power of citi
zens and the role of engagement in
democratic societies, I also believe
that it is the role of elected officials
to represent marginalized commu
nities. To this point, I affirm my sup
port and gratitude for our veterans
and ROTC cadets; I also affirm my
alliance and support of transgender
students and their rights. Support for
both of these groups is not and
should not be mutually exclusive.
One can be anti-discrimination
without being anti-military.
I come from Sparks, Nevada, a
town located just over an hour away
from Fallon Air Force base. Many
friends from my hometown have
honorably decided to join the mili
tary; my step-dad is a veteran. I am
personally considering joining our
military after I serve in Teach for
America for two years. I fully sup
port the individuals in our military,
and I am concerned to know that
some of the current ROTC cadets
and veterans on campus have at
times faced anti-militaristic senti
ment. At the town hall, one veteran
spoke of the scornful looks he re
ceives every time he wears his uni
form on campus. Many of these stu
dents have told me that not bringing
back ROTC would heighten their
feelings of isolation at Stanford. Par
ticularly when our student veterans
have just returned from active duty
and are transitioning, it is absolutely
crucial that these individuals feel a
sense of belonging on the Farm. To
this end, I believe more must be
done. The establishment of Military
101 at the Haas Center for Public
Service is one step in the right direc
tion, but we must do more to ensure
these members of our community
are respected and supported. One
idea is the formation of a military

community center, an idea that I
hope next year's ASSU leaders will
drive forward.

Ultimately, as a community, we
must come together to find a solu
tion that ensures the well-being of all
students at Stanford. We must sup
port the military students on our
campus individually and collectively
but doing so by bringing back the
institution of ROTC in its current
form would harm our transgender
community.
As military policy currently
stands, transgender students are not
allowed to serve in the ROTC.
Transgender students, allies, the Un
dergraduate Senate and I believe
that bringing back the ROTC vio
lates Stanford's nondiscrimination
policy, namely the part that reads,
"Stanford University admits quali
fied students of any race, color, na
tional or ethnic origin, sex, age, dis
ability, religion, sexual orientation
and gender identity to all the rights,
privileges, programs, and activities
generally accorded or made avail
able to students at the University."
Many counter arguments state
that the nondiscrimination policy
prohibits unlawful discrimination,
and the military is within the bounds
of law to discriminate against trans
gender individuals. I don't want this
discourse to be lost in the trenches of
technicality, especially because as
history reveals, being legal does not
make something right. Moreover, at
the heart of the nondiscrimination
policy is a value and principle that
Stanford holds true: that every stu
dent will have equal access to the op
portunities at our university. Institu
tionally recognizing and financially
backing an organization that does
not allow all of our students equal
access goes against this core princi
ple.
Many agree that transgender in
dividuals should be afforded the op
portunity to serve in the ROTC at
Stanford. Another disagreement
comes with how we most effectively
and efficiently reach that objective
in the future. Recent precedent with
the repeal of the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy shows that, in the case of
military discrimination, demanding
a change before allowing the institu
tion to return to campus is one
strong lever, amongst others, to
changing discriminatory policies. We
must also write to and call our Con
gressional leaders demanding this
change. In conjunction with this
opinion editorial, I have sent a hand
ful of letters to U.S. legislators and to
the President urging them to change
military policy to allow equally qual
ified transgender individuals to
serve.

We, the Stanford community, all
have a stake in upholding the non
discrimination policy and a mutual
investment in diversity and inclusion.
On the basis of equality, I cannot sup
port the institutional establishment
of ROTC until it allows involvement
by all of our students. Once this
change is made, I will enthusiastically
welcome the return of ROTC to
Stanford University.
I realize that my views do not re
flect those of the entire student body,
and I welcome and encourage agree
ment and disagreement alike: presi
dent@assu.stanford.edu. Although I
hold these views personally, I pledge
to convey the entire spectrum of
opinions to the Ad Hoc Committee.
You can also send your opinions di
rectly to the ROTC Ad Hoc Commit
tee (rotc_2olo@stanford.edu) who
will be making the official recom
mendation to the Faculty Senate on
May 12th.
I strongly encourage the contin
ued dialogue on this topic as the rec
ommendation of the ROTC Ad Hoc
committee nears, and I hope the level
of civility and acceptance expected of
us as Stanford citizens is upheld as we
move forward in the final stages of
this decision.

rectly to the ROTC Ad Hoc Commit
tee (rotc_2olo@stanford.edu) who
will be making the official recom
mendation to the Faculty Senate on
May 12th.
I strongly encourage the contin
ued dialogue on this topic as the rec
ommendation of the ROTC Ad Hoc
committee nears, and I hope the level
of civility and acceptance expected of
us as Stanford citizens is upheld as we
move forward in the final stages of
this decision.
On the topic of ROTC, our
campus is divided. It is ap
parent with the emails on list
serves, flyers, rallies, petitions, opin
ion editorials and conversations in
our classes and dorms. At the ROTC
town hall in January, it was clear that
the two-hour discussion was more
than just an intellectual debate
for many this was personal. In the
final phases of this discussion lead
ing up to the Faculty Senate presen
tation by the ROTC Ad Hoc Com
mittee on May 12th, we must move
forward as a community with an un
precedented level of sensitivity in
our discourse, because the decision
on ROTC will inevitably end up
hurting part of our Stanford family.
As student body president, it has
been nearly impossible to represent
a unified student position about the
possible reinstatement of ROTC at
Stanford. This is what led me to pro
pose the non-binding referendum
on the annual ASSU ballot: "Adviso
ry Question A" asks you to state
your stance on ROTC's potential re
instatement. I offer my personal
stance to contribute to the dialogue
and to push our collective and indi
vidual thinking on this issue. While I
firmly believe in the power of citi
zens and the role of engagement in
democratic societies, I also believe
that it is the role of elected officials
to represent marginalized commu
nities. To this point, I affirm my sup
port and gratitude for our veterans
and ROTC cadets; I also affirm my
alliance and support of transgender
students and their rights. Support for
both of these groups is not and
should not be mutually exclusive.
One can be anti-discrimination
without being anti-military.
I come from Sparks, Nevada, a
town located just over an hour away
from Fallon Air Force base. Many
friends from my hometown have
honorably decided to join the mili
tary; my step-dad is a veteran. I am
personally considering joining our
military after I serve in Teach for
America for two years. I fully sup
port the individuals in our military,
and I am concerned to know that
some of the current ROTC cadets
and veterans on campus have at
times faced anti-militaristic senti
ment. At the town hall, one veteran
spoke of the scornful looks he re
ceives every time he wears his uni
form on campus. Many of these stu
dents have told me that not bringing
back ROTC would heighten their
feelings of isolation at Stanford. Par
ticularly when our student veterans
have just returned from active duty
and are transitioning, it is absolutely
crucial that these individuals feel a
sense of belonging on the Farm. To
this end, I believe more must be
done. The establishment of Military
101 at the Haas Center for Public
Service is one step in the right direc
tion, but we must do more to ensure
these members of our community
are respected and supported. One
idea is the formation of a military

community center, an idea that I
hope next year's ASSU leaders will
drive forward.

Ultimately, as a community, we
must come together to find a solu
tion that ensures the well-being of all
students at Stanford. We must sup
port the military students on our
campus individually and collectively
but doing so by bringing back the
institution of ROTC in its current
form would harm our transgender
community.
As military policy currently
stands, transgender students are not
allowed to serve in the ROTC.
Transgender students, allies, the Un
dergraduate Senate and I believe
that bringing back the ROTC vio
lates Stanford's nondiscrimination
policy, namely the part that reads,
"Stanford University admits quali
fied students of any race, color, na
tional or ethnic origin, sex, age, dis
ability, religion, sexual orientation
and gender identity to all the rights,
privileges, programs, and activities
generally accorded or made avail
able to students at the University."
Many counter arguments state
that the nondiscrimination policy
prohibits unlawful discrimination,
and the military is within the bounds
of law to discriminate against trans
gender individuals. I don't want this
discourse to be lost in the trenches of
technicality, especially because as
history reveals, being legal does not
make something right. Moreover, at
the heart of the nondiscrimination
policy is a value and principle that
Stanford holds true: that every stu
dent will have equal access to the op
portunities at our university. Institu
tionally recognizing and financially
backing an organization that does
not allow all of our students equal
access goes against this core princi
ple.
Many agree that transgender in
dividuals should be afforded the op
portunity to serve in the ROTC at
Stanford. Another disagreement
comes with how we most effectively
and efficiently reach that objective
in the future. Recent precedent with
the repeal of the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy shows that, in the case of
military discrimination, demanding
a change before allowing the institu
tion to return to campus is one
strong lever, amongst others, to
changing discriminatory policies. We
must also write to and call our Con
gressional leaders demanding this
change. In conjunction with this
opinion editorial, I have sent a hand
ful of letters to U.S. legislators and to
the President urging them to change
military policy to allow equally qual
ified transgender individuals to
serve.

We, the Stanford community, all
have a stake in upholding the non
discrimination policy and a mutual
investment in diversity and inclusion.
On the basis of equality, I cannot sup
port the institutional establishment
of ROTC until it allows involvement
by all of our students. Once this
change is made, I will enthusiastically
welcome the return of ROTC to
Stanford University.
I realize that my views do not re
flect those of the entire student body,
and I welcome and encourage agree
ment and disagreement alike: presi
dent@assu.stanford.edu. Although I
hold these views personally, I pledge
to convey the entire spectrum of
opinions to the Ad Hoc Committee.

rectly to the ROTC Ad Hoc Commit

will be making the official recom
mendation to the Faculty Senate on
