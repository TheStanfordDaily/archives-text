# CARDINAL CRUISIN'
## NO. 8 STANFORD HITS ROAD TO PLAY USC 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Cardinal baseball will ride a
three-game win streak and a No.
11 ranking into its second Pac-10
series of the year, a weekend set
against struggling USC.
The Trojans (11-18, 2-4) have
won just three of their last 11
games, while Stanford (14-7, 2-1
Pac-10) has won as many contests
in the last week. The No. 8 Cardi
nal celebrated head coach Mark
Marquess' 1,400 th career victory
last Sunday in a 4-3 victory over
Washington State, and improved
to 6-0 in mid-week games with a 5-
2 win over visiting San Jose State.
Stanford hopes to take advan
tage of a favorable matchup this
weekend against a USC team
picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10
by the coaches, but there is still
much for the Cardinal to be con
cerned about. The squad has mus
tered only a 6-6 record on the
road, despite a nearly perfect
mark in Sunken Diamond.
Stanford's offense has cooled off
considerably in the last two games,
following a three-game stretch that
saw the Cardinal score 46 runs;
meanwhile, USC has scored 38
times in its last four contests, though
only managed to win twice.
Stanford has also won just one
Friday opener through five series
on the season, with the only win
coming in the first game of the sea
son against No. 22 Rice. The Owls
happen to be the only team that
has faced both USC and Stanford
in a series this year; the Trojans
were swept, while the Cardinal
took two of three.

Plenty has changed for Stan
ford, however, since the season
began a month and a half ago.

Shortstop Kenny Diekroeger,
who finished eighth in the Pac-10
last year in batting average among
players with at least 25 at-bats, has
put up even better numbers this
season, climbing to second in the
same category with a .422 average.
The sophomore will also take a 15-
game hit streak into Los Angeles
this weekend.

Also notable is the emergence
of freshman second baseman
Lonnie Kauppila, who was named
a national player of the week by
Collegiate Baseball and received
similar conference-level honors
for the Pac-lO.The freshman hit 15
for 20 last week, raising his batting
average by nearly 170 points and

rising to second on the team in
slugging percentage (.493), behind
only freshman Brian Ragira.
Kauppila went hitless on Tues
day in a 5-2 win over San Jose
State, but five hits as a team in the
first two innings were enough to
secure the victory for the Cardinal
after it jumped out to an early
lead. By the third, Stanford was al
ready up 5-0, with four different
players recording RBI.
Getting out of the gates quick
ly again will be key this weekend;
Stanford and USC have each lost
only once when leading after the
sixth inning. Neither team has lost
when ahead going into the ninth,
thanks to solid performances by
Cardinal closer Chris Reed and
Trojan finisher Chad Smith.
But Reed isn't the only shut
down pitcher for Stanford.
Among the Cardinal's seven
hurlers who have appeared in five
games or more, not a single one
has an ERA above 4.12 or an op
posing batting average above .297.
The starting position repre
sents Stanford's largest advantage
over the Trojans, as USC's three
right-handers slated to start this
weekend have a combined record
of just 4-11, compared to 9-4 for
their Stanford counterparts.

The Cardinal will start its rota
tion in traditional order with
sophomore Mark Appel going on
Friday, junior Jordan Pries follow
ing him on Saturday and sopho
more Dean McArdle finishing up
the series.

The action will kick with 6:00
p.m. contests on Friday and Satur
day, preceding an early-afternoon
1:00 p.m. start time on Sunday.

NOTES: No. 1 1 Stanford is on a bit of a
roll, with three straight wins and six wins
in the past seven games. They will be
challenged on the road this weekend
against rival USC. The Trojans shocked
No. 13 Cal on the road last weekend
and pounded LMU 10-3 in a mid-week
home game on Tuesday. Junior infielder
Ricky Oropesa is batting .363 to lead
SC, but the Cardinal should feast on the
Trojan pitching staff, who have a com
bined ERA of 4.46.

Cardinal baseball will ride a
three-game win streak and a No.
11 ranking into its second Pac-10
series of the year, a weekend set
against struggling USC.
The Trojans (11-18, 2-4) have
won just three of their last 11
games, while Stanford (14-7, 2-1
Pac-10) has won as many contests
in the last week. The No. 8 Cardi
nal celebrated head coach Mark
Marquess' 1,400 th career victory
last Sunday in a 4-3 victory over
Washington State, and improved
to 6-0 in mid-week games with a 5-
2 win over visiting San Jose State.
Stanford hopes to take advan
tage of a favorable matchup this
weekend against a USC team
picked to finish ninth in the Pac-10
by the coaches, but there is still
much for the Cardinal to be con
cerned about. The squad has mus
tered only a 6-6 record on the
road, despite a nearly perfect
mark in Sunken Diamond.
Stanford's offense has cooled off
considerably in the last two games,
following a three-game stretch that
saw the Cardinal score 46 runs;
meanwhile, USC has scored 38
times in its last four contests, though
only managed to win twice.
Stanford has also won just one
Friday opener through five series
on the season, with the only win
coming in the first game of the sea
son against No. 22 Rice. The Owls
happen to be the only team that
has faced both USC and Stanford
in a series this year; the Trojans
were swept, while the Cardinal
took two of three.

Plenty has changed for Stan
ford, however, since the season
began a month and a half ago.

Shortstop Kenny Diekroeger,
who finished eighth in the Pac-10
last year in batting average among
players with at least 25 at-bats, has
put up even better numbers this
season, climbing to second in the
same category with a .422 average.
The sophomore will also take a 15-
game hit streak into Los Angeles
this weekend.

Also notable is the emergence
of freshman second baseman
Lonnie Kauppila, who was named
a national player of the week by
Collegiate Baseball and received
similar conference-level honors
for the Pac-lO.The freshman hit 15
for 20 last week, raising his batting
average by nearly 170 points and

rising to second on the team in
slugging percentage (.493), behind
only freshman Brian Ragira.
Kauppila went hitless on Tues
day in a 5-2 win over San Jose
State, but five hits as a team in the
first two innings were enough to
secure the victory for the Cardinal
after it jumped out to an early
lead. By the third, Stanford was al
ready up 5-0, with four different
players recording RBI.
Getting out of the gates quick
ly again will be key this weekend;
Stanford and USC have each lost
only once when leading after the
sixth inning. Neither team has lost
when ahead going into the ninth,
thanks to solid performances by
Cardinal closer Chris Reed and
Trojan finisher Chad Smith.
But Reed isn't the only shut
down pitcher for Stanford.
Among the Cardinal's seven
hurlers who have appeared in five
games or more, not a single one
has an ERA above 4.12 or an op
posing batting average above .297.
The starting position repre
sents Stanford's largest advantage
over the Trojans, as USC's three
right-handers slated to start this
weekend have a combined record
of just 4-11, compared to 9-4 for
their Stanford counterparts.

The Cardinal will start its rota
tion in traditional order with
sophomore Mark Appel going on
Friday, junior Jordan Pries follow
ing him on Saturday and sopho
more Dean McArdle finishing up
the series.

The action will kick with 6:00
p.m. contests on Friday and Satur
day, preceding an early-afternoon
1:00 p.m. start time on Sunday.

NOTES: No. 1 1 Stanford is on a bit of a
roll, with three straight wins and six wins
in the past seven games. They will be
challenged on the road this weekend
against rival USC. The Trojans shocked
No. 13 Cal on the road last weekend
and pounded LMU 10-3 in a mid-week
home game on Tuesday. Junior infielder
Ricky Oropesa is batting .363 to lead
SC, but the Cardinal should feast on the
Trojan pitching staff, who have a com
bined ERA of 4.46.
