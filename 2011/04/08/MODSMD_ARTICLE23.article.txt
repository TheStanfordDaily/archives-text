# REASONS YOU SHOULD READ
## Tina Fey Bossypants top five "Bossypants" 
### 
Tina Fey's new book "Bossypants"
hit shelves Tuesday, which is the
same day Intermission drove to
Borders to pick up a copy (not that
we've been excitedly waiting or any
thing since we first saw the burly
armed cover in October).

It's written
by Tina Fey,
duh.

She's the woman who gave us
Liz Lemon, "Mean Girls" and the
world's best Sarah Palin imper
sonation. With that track record,
how could this book not be a
home run?

of the book. 2

worth it." — Trees

She wore a
"kickass
white denim
suit" to Senior
Awards Night 1988.

"The jacket that zipped all the way down
the front into a nice fitted shape. The white
denim that made my untanned skin look
like a color. Just once I'd like to find an
Oscars or Emmys dress as rad as this suit."
(See accompanying photo on page 16).

She refuses
to use the
word
blond.

"Why do I call it 'yellow' hair and not
'blond' hair? Because I'm pretty sure every
body calls my hair 'brown.' When I read
fairy tales to my daughter I always change
the word 'blond' to 'yellow,' because I don't
want her to think that blond hair is some
how better."

Liz Lemon's terrible haircuts on "30
Rock" weren't too far off.
