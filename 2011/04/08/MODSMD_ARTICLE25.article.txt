cc -w-really love coming to California," said Chang-Rae Lee
I with a grin as he took to the podium in Encina Hall's
J.Bechtel Convention Center on Wednesday evening.

Recently named by the New York Times Magazine as one
of the most influential American novelists writing today, Lee
has been published in an array of notable print, from the New
Yorker and the New York Times to Conde Nast Traveler and
Food and Wine.

Lee's numerous literary awards, including the
PEN/Hemingway Award and the Asian/Pacific-American
Award for Literature, were mentioned by Jones Lecturer
Shimon Tanaka. Tanaka began the evening with a writerly and
complimentary review of Lee's works, culminating in high
praise for Lee's most recent novel, "The Surrendered."

Tanaka remarked that Lee is "one of the most celebrated
American writers today," and subsequently pointed to the
intention and implication behind his use of the word
"American" as opposed to "Korean-American" or "Asian-
American."

"Chang-Rae Lee resists the compartmentalization faced
by most Asian-American writers today," Tanaka said in his
introduction, alluding to the fierce affirmation of individual
identity that the evening would become.

Before Lee read from "The Surrendered," he mentioned
that he was "desirous of engaging" with the crowd and would
only be reading a short passage, in order to allow for more
Q&A.

"The Surrendered" is a novel that "tackles the wounds
and cost of conflict on individual souls," said Lee, who
described it as a book full of violence, misery and moments of
hopelessness. "But I'm going to read from a section with a lot
of hope," Lee smiled, before describing the scenario (a Korean
War veteran's birthday evening at an Irish pub) and diving
into his work.

Lee read from the thick paperback with the ownership
that only the given writer of a work could, with breaths placed
precisely at the right moments, intonation as natural as if he
were typing the page out before his small but captivated audi
ence.
After the passage was read, Lee opened the floor for ques
tions, as promised, answering each with consideration.
Questions ranged from his methodology to his self-identifica
tion.

"Writing is the hardest thing," Lee said, when asked if he
ever ran up against difficulties. Lee described his strategy as
"sitting at the desk as long as I can, butt in chair."
Lee's distaste for external duty became very apparent after
questions about whether or not a writer "has a duty" to his past
and heritage, and the manner in which he refers to his works as
"American" rather than "Asian-American." Lee explained that he
understood the category of "Asian-American literature" as a
classification that grew out of exclusion; but he was wary that
the acknowledgement of "Asian-American literature" in turn
defined and confined Asian-American writers. Lee posed
thoughtful hypotheticals to the audience: must Asian-American
literature deal with themes of immigration, family, generations?
Who is the necessary generator of Asian-American literature?
The Asian-American artist is always an individual ," Lee said.
"The artist is always an individual ." Of one of the Korean char
acters in "The Surrendered," Lee remarked, "Enduring life does
n't have anything to do with her cultural identity."
That is, after all, what Chang-Rae Lee's writing and Chang-
Rae Lee himself seem to be most concerned with: the individual,
enduring life. "What a phenomenon people are!" exclaimed
Chang-Rae Lee. "If you meet if you really meet a person, how
interesting."
