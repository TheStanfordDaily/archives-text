cc -w-really love coming to California," said Chang-Rae Lee
I with a grin as he took to the podium in Encina Hall's
J.Bechtel Convention Center on Wednesday evening.

Recently named by the New York Times Magazine as one
of the most influential American novelists writing today, Lee
has been published in an array of notable print, from the New
Yorker and the New York Times to Conde Nast Traveler and
Food and Wine.

Lee's numerous literary awards, including the
PEN/Hemingway Award and the Asian/Pacific-American
Award for Literature, were mentioned by Jones Lecturer
Shimon Tanaka. Tanaka began the evening with a writerly and

War veteran's birthday evening at an Irish pub) and diving
into his work.

that only the given writer of a work could, with breaths placed
precisely at the right moments, intonation as natural as if he
were typing the page out before his small but captivated audi

After the passage was read, Lee opened the floor for ques

Questions ranged from his methodology to his self-identifica

"Writing is the hardest thing," Lee said, when asked if he
ever ran up against difficulties. Lee described his strategy as
