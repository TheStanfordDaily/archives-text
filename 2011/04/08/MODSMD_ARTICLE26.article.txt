## A 						SHAVE TO THE GRAVE SPLITTING HAIRS, THROATS AND OTHER THINGS WITH SWEENEY TODD

Btephen SondWm is widely known
for being fluent! in the macabre, and
in "Sweeney load: The Demon
Barber of Fleet Streß" he fully delivers,
deftly weaving together wit and wordplay
with gruesomeness and grotesquerie.
"Sweeney" also happens to be one of my
favorite musicals, so it was a pleasant sur
prise when the Ram's Head production
managed to meet most of my high
expectations. The story follows Sweeney
Todd (James Everett 'l3), a murderous
barber who seeks vengeance on Judge
Turpin (Chris Lewis 'l2), who stole his
wife away and banished him from
London. Upon his return to Sondheim's
dark and foul London, he joins forces
with the darkly hilarious Mrs. Lovett
(Olivia Haas '11) and naive young
Anthony (Ken Kansky'l2) in an attempt
to free his daughter Johanna (Kali
Lindsey'l2) from her unrighteous
imprisonment and to kill the dishonor
able judge.

values set a high bar from
the startßpon the curtain's rise, the light
ing tookßi a mass of chorus members '
hanging their heads and painted them to
look like nothing more or less than a mass
of corpses on the gallows. After this initial
vision, lighting was more or less tastefully
done, and was intermittently breathtaking.
There were moments of occasional tacki
ness whenever Johanna and Anthony
shared the stage, for instance, the stage

would be lit from the back by a massive,
hilariously colorful screen alternating pur
ple and blue light; doubtless the intention
was to achieve some sort of dreamlike

quality, but it fell just short but overall,
the lighting managed to maintain and
accentuate the mood of the piece.
The cast was extremely talented,
though some of the acting was at times
stiff. Everett's Sweeney was a wholly
imposing one, and his voice carried a
deep, ringing timbre that forced the audi

ence to provide I ir full attention. HMs
was surprisingly likeable as Lovett, despite
a heavy fake accent that I expected to be a
lot more annoying than it was. Her char
acter demonstrates Sondheim at his most
playful, all reproachful self-righteousness
and domestic compassion and a cold-

blooded lack of humanity. Kali Lindsey
was almost eerily perfect as Johanna, her
high, pure tones bringing to life the char
acter's delicate fragility. And although Ken
Kansky's acting was at times somewhat

wooden, his voice was strong and more
than made up for it.
The most striking talent in the show,
though, was the beggar woman (played by
Sarah Guerrero '11). The moment she

capered onstage, howling for alms and
limping dramatically, every eye in the

room was drawn to her, and for the rest of
the play, whenever she was present I could

not find myself able to look at anyone else. Guerrero was perhaps
the only one onstage who truly threw her entire body into her
work, the only one physically committing to the role. It could
have been too much, but she pulled it off, and it was mesmeriz
ing.
Another notable factor was, surprisingly enough, the chorus
in the background. Throughout the show, I spent a good deal of
time watching individual chorus members react to the scenes
unfolding before them and was surprised to find their reactions
to be entertaining and wholly believable, even on an individual
level. Particularly remarkable was their performance as a rabble
of semi-demonic lunatics at the very end of the piece, in which
their mad, contorted frolic was genuinely disturbing.
High points to look out for: Lovett and Sweeney's playful
duet, "A Little Priest" was Sondheim at his best; the joyful mood
that Everett and Haas create is wholly infectious, and Everett's all
consuming rage in "Epiphany" is genuinely believable.
Of course, in every show you will also have low points.
Judge Turpin's scene of self-flagellation (in which he proceeds to
beat himself about the back with what looked to be a riding
crop) was almost too uncomfortable to look at. Young Toby's
(Josh Siegel 'l4) costume (complete with silly ankle socks and,
for about half of his time onstage, an absolutely absurd yellow
wig) made it difficult to take the character seriously (though, to
his credit, the actor managed to surpass this hurdle in his tragic
performance of "Not While I'm Around").
Despite these small shortcomings, the Ram's Head cast
managed to put on a visual spectacle and an aural masterpiece,
great for anyone who can appreciate a truly dark comedy.
