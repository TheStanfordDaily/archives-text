## SEEING THE NEXT DIMENSION 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
When the unmitigated
bliss of playing my new
3DS had worn off a bit,

there was a moment when I began to
fathom what stereoscopic visuals

could actually mean for video games.
It was a slower, subtler realization

than the sudden wow-factor when I
first powered up the device, but now
that my voracious hunger for new
hardware has settled a bit, it has me
even more excited.

So what am I talking about?
Towards the end of Rayman 2,
there's a series of stages where the
player gains the ability to fly. It was a
liberating little twist back in the hey
day of polygonal platformers, but the
added depth of the 3DS version
makes it downright enchanting. As
the hovering Rayman spelunked his

way through ser
pentine caverns,
I found it
noticeably easier
to tell how far I

was from singeing the hero's hands

against lava-stained walls on every
side. When I touched down on terra
firma, I didn't need to rely on
Rayman's shadow to know where I
was about to land. It was as clear to
see, as if... well, as if I were slowly
hovering toward the ground myself.
I had the distinct feeling that
this was how "3D" platformers
polygonal 3D, that is are meant to
be played, despite the fact that the
genre is well past its prime. When
Super Mario 64 introduced the

world to the next dimension back in
1996, Nintendo mastermind Shigeru
Miyamoto had to change up the

plucky plumber's traditional formula

considerably. To off
set the added diffi-
I culty of maneuver
ing in three dimen-

sions, enemies were less plentiful and
ledges were less treacherous. Mario

even gained a generous health meter,
and most of the platforming
which was fast and precise in 2D
took on a slow, floaty feel aided by
triple jumps and ground pounds.
If Super Mario 64 made its
debut on Nintendo's new handheld,
the defining game of the 1990s
would have a considerably different
design. Miyamoto has implied as
much, having gone on record earlier
this year saying that Mario's first 3DS
installment will feature level design
that would be more daunting to
casual players on standard 2D
screens.
But Rayman is a thing of the

past, and Mario 3DS is a long way
off. If they want to justify the already
ridiculous sales of the device, game
developers many of whom, I'm
sure, agree with Miyamoto and me
will need to learn to use stereo-

scopic conservatively as a tool, not
liberally as a gimmick.
A re-hash of a 12-year-old

Playstation game was somehow
enough to show me that it's possible
to use 3D in ways that qualitatively
change gameplay, but it doesn't satis
fy me. Not nearly. I'm not entirely
sure how 3D will affect other genres,
but my head is spinning with the
