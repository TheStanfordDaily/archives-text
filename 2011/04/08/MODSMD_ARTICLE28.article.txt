CCT nsidious" has a pretty
dumb marketing scheme,
.M. between its idiotic
"Insidious is... Insidious" tagline, prob
ably made up by someone who clearly
has no idea what the word means, and
its poster, featuring what appears to be a
zombiefied Biebs. And it's all a damn
shame, given that "Insidious" is hands
down one of the scariest movies to
come around in a long time.
The film is the lovechild of two of
today's biggest horror franchises it's
written by Leigh Whannell and direct
ed by James Wan, the duo behind
"Saw" and produced by "Paranormal
Activity" auteur Oren Peli.
At first glance, "Insidious" comes
off as typical haunted house fare
unsettling clanking, some misplaced

books here and there and your stan
dard demonic gurglings rumbling
through the baby monitor. Patrick
Wilson ("The Phantom of the
Opera") and Rose Byrne ("28 Weeks
Later") play troubled couple Josh and
Renai whose happy suburban idyll is
suddenly disrupted when their oldest
son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), falls into
a mysterious coma. The scare tactics
are amped up from there on out,
from "Paranormal Activity"-style
scary-because-we-can't-see-them to
oh-my-god-terrifying-because-we
totally-do-see-them. The menacing
spirits show their faces just enough
for maximum fright, made even
scarier thanks to their almost car
toonish appearances (the main
demonic baddie shares the same

makeup artist as Darth Maul). The
tension is amplified by Joseph
Bishara's shrieking, over-the-top
score. Scares come suddenly and
from unexpected places the 20s
folk tune "Tiptoe Through the
Tulips" will never sound like the same
cheery old-timey song ever again.
The film is buoyed by sympa
thetic performances from Byrne and
Wilson. As the frazzled and freaked
out Renai, Byrne earns our empathy
without grating on our nerves.
Wilson plays Josh, the exasperated
but loving skeptic who, for once,

takes action and gets his family out of
the house when things get weird.
Unfortunately for them, it's not the
house that's haunted, but their coma
tose son, Dalton. Enter Josh's mom,
Lorraine (Barbara Hershey— most
recently seen as Natalie Portman's
creeptastic mother in "Black Swan")
who calls in the help of a psychic
exorcist (Lin Shaye) and her bum
bling team to summon Dalton back
from the malevolent spirit world.
"Insidious" doesn't break any
new ground in the horror film genre.
Whannell and Wan have already

experienced that as the granddaddies
of psychological torture porn with
the "Saw" franchise as has Peli with
"Paranormal Activity's" grainy, low
budget footage (although you could
argue that got started with "The Blair
Witch Project"). But with "Insidious,"
what they do manage is to effectively
scare the living daylights out of you.
It's a solid, if not terribly original, B
movie that'll keep you up for many
nights to follow.
