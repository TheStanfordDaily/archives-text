lam unabashedly a television elitist,
though this column has gone a long
way in encouraging me toward the
channels below the number 20. When I
heard that AMC had delayed "Mad Men"
till March 2012 in favor of newer pro
gramming, the last thing I planned to do
was to watch the shows AMC had chosen
over the decadent world of Sterling
Cooper. And yet, one spring quarter April
afternoon later, I have regained respect for
the American Movie Channel and have
gleaned a new understanding of the proce
dural form from its newest serial drama,
"The Killing."
Airing Sunday nights at 10 p.m., the
show presents an adaptation of a Danish
series under the direction of Veena Sud,
the former show runner of CBS's "Cold
Case." Consistent with the elitist East Coast
blood coursing in my veins, I have never
been a fan of crime procedurals, shows
such as "CSI" or "Cold Case" which exam
ine a new crime every week. These 45-
minute episodes thrive on an unfeasible
compact plot, superficial emotions and
attention to forensic detail, accurate or not
the storytelling appears formulaic and
assumes what the audience wants from the
show. At first, "The Killing" came off as a
mere expansion of that mode, procedural
narrative on a cable budget. By the middle
of the first episode (AMC aired the first
two back to back on Sunday), however, I
was immersed in the maddening worlds of
crime, domesticity and politics.
In the style of many cable dramas
"True Blood" springs to mind the large
cast of characters incorporates three simul
taneously parallel and perpendicular plot
lines in the same geographic region of
Seattle: the homicide department, led by
Linden and Holder, investigates the mur
der of Rosie Larsen, survived by her par
ents and two brothers, after the girl is
found in the submerged campaign car of

aspirant mayor Darren Richmond. These
threads all intersect in the pilot episode,
establishing the diverse landscapes the
show plans to cover. Seattle itself has many
representative modes: the cinematography
uses establishing shots to transition
between the modern metropolis with the
space needle, the dank setup of the indus
trial waterfront and the solemn flats of
marshland. These contrasting ecosystems,
unified by dark lighting, underline the
contrasting perspectives of the characters
while enabling all of those characters to
pass unobtrusively through all of the set
tings. The muted colors, costumes and
even physical beauty of the actors similarly
highlight the symbolic transformation of
the mundane into the horrific. The typical
procedural draws its life from tales of pros
titutes, extramarital affairs and celebrities,
but "The Killing" actively resists this urge
to sensationalize. The detectives encourage
Richmond to wait to go public with the
story of the murder, and he agrees. As he
tells his aide, the lives of his constituents
