## A 						FRESH TAKE ON MURDER

lam unabashedly a television elitist,
though this column has gone a long
way in encouraging me toward the
channels below the number 20. When I
heard that AMC had delayed "Mad Men"
till March 2012 in favor of newer pro
gramming, the last thing I planned to do
was to watch the shows AMC had chosen
over the decadent world of Sterling
Cooper. And yet, one spring quarter April
afternoon later, I have regained respect for
the American Movie Channel and have
gleaned a new understanding of the proce
dural form from its newest serial drama,
"The Killing."
Airing Sunday nights at 10 p.m., the
show presents an adaptation of a Danish
series under the direction of Veena Sud,
the former show runner of CBS's "Cold
Case." Consistent with the elitist East Coast
blood coursing in my veins, I have never
been a fan of crime procedurals, shows
such as "CSI" or "Cold Case" which exam
ine a new crime every week. These 45-
minute episodes thrive on an unfeasible
compact plot, superficial emotions and
attention to forensic detail, accurate or not
the storytelling appears formulaic and
assumes what the audience wants from the
show. At first, "The Killing" came off as a
mere expansion of that mode, procedural
narrative on a cable budget. By the middle
of the first episode (AMC aired the first
two back to back on Sunday), however, I
was immersed in the maddening worlds of
crime, domesticity and politics.
In the style of many cable dramas
"True Blood" springs to mind the large
cast of characters incorporates three simul
taneously parallel and perpendicular plot
lines in the same geographic region of
Seattle: the homicide department, led by
Linden and Holder, investigates the mur
der of Rosie Larsen, survived by her par
ents and two brothers, after the girl is
found in the submerged campaign car of

aspirant mayor Darren Richmond. These
threads all intersect in the pilot episode,
establishing the diverse landscapes the
show plans to cover. Seattle itself has many
representative modes: the cinematography
uses establishing shots to transition
between the modern metropolis with the
space needle, the dank setup of the indus
trial waterfront and the solemn flats of
marshland. These contrasting ecosystems,
unified by dark lighting, underline the
contrasting perspectives of the characters
while enabling all of those characters to
pass unobtrusively through all of the set
tings. The muted colors, costumes and
even physical beauty of the actors similarly
highlight the symbolic transformation of
the mundane into the horrific. The typical
procedural draws its life from tales of pros
titutes, extramarital affairs and celebrities,
but "The Killing" actively resists this urge
to sensationalize. The detectives encourage
Richmond to wait to go public with the
story of the murder, and he agrees. As he
tells his aide, the lives of his constituents

the widow of an Iraq War vet, for
example are more important than
the vortex of the murder investiga
tion.
"The Killing" exposes its scaf
folding, which both allies it with and
distinguishes it from network proce
dural, through its untraditional rela
tionship to time. The pilot episode
begins with deadlines Linden has
a flight at 9, Stanley Larsen has boxes
to move and Richmond dashes
between meetings and scheduled
appearances. The constant references
to the amount of time that has
passed or that remains reminds us
that those predictions are broken in
the world of the investigation, with
Linden transforming "just a minute"
into 20 of them and her boss asking
her to stay another 24 hours. Linden,
planning to move to California to
meet her fiance at the outset of the
episode, is still with us two hours
later and has communicated to her
replacement, Holder, that there is no
time in homicide. The show, in the
world of politics, high school or
criminal investigation, generates sus
pense by obliterating time, not
enslaving itself to it as procedural
normally do.

Ultimately, this disregard for
conventions of time aligns with the
show's desire to depict how we com
municate and absorb information.
These issues lie at the core of proce
durals: when will a suspect stop

lying, when will the light bulb go off
in the detective's head? Consistently

throughout the episode, we see a
character's auditory comprehension
over the phone arrested by a visual
interruption, perhaps to imply that
the common structure of even our
conversations is a fallacy. After
Linden's blunt classroom investiga
tion fails, Holder gleans information
from two high school soccer players
by affecting a role himself, a method
usually unavailable to detectives.

Richmond instructs an associate to
investigate the emails of his two most
senior aides, as if the truth of their
intent lies not in their words but the
action of sending a message to the
wrong person. The second episode
concludes with repeated photo
graphic captures of a bloody hand
on the wall before cutting to black, a
device repeated from Linden's own
zoom-in on Rosie Larsen's butterfly
necklace. First, the technique is used
to confirm that Rosie is the victim;
the second time, it solidifies only our
curiosity is that really blood? Or
red paint as it was in the first scene,
when Linden's coworkers pranked
her? The willingness of this show to
contradict itself, in words and
images, suggests that this traditional
ly filmic narrative can intrigue audi
ences for an entire season of televi
sion. At least until "Mad Men"
returns, trading blood for martinis.

lam unabashedly a television elitist,
though this column has gone a long
way in encouraging me toward the
channels below the number 20. When I
heard that AMC had delayed "Mad Men"
till March 2012 in favor of newer pro
gramming, the last thing I planned to do
was to watch the shows AMC had chosen
over the decadent world of Sterling
Cooper. And yet, one spring quarter April
afternoon later, I have regained respect for
the American Movie Channel and have
gleaned a new understanding of the proce
dural form from its newest serial drama,
"The Killing."
Airing Sunday nights at 10 p.m., the
show presents an adaptation of a Danish
series under the direction of Veena Sud,
the former show runner of CBS's "Cold
Case." Consistent with the elitist East Coast
blood coursing in my veins, I have never
been a fan of crime procedurals, shows
such as "CSI" or "Cold Case" which exam
ine a new crime every week. These 45-
minute episodes thrive on an unfeasible
compact plot, superficial emotions and
attention to forensic detail, accurate or not
the storytelling appears formulaic and
assumes what the audience wants from the
show. At first, "The Killing" came off as a
mere expansion of that mode, procedural
narrative on a cable budget. By the middle
of the first episode (AMC aired the first
two back to back on Sunday), however, I
was immersed in the maddening worlds of
crime, domesticity and politics.
In the style of many cable dramas
"True Blood" springs to mind the large
cast of characters incorporates three simul
taneously parallel and perpendicular plot
lines in the same geographic region of
Seattle: the homicide department, led by
Linden and Holder, investigates the mur
der of Rosie Larsen, survived by her par
ents and two brothers, after the girl is
found in the submerged campaign car of

aspirant mayor Darren Richmond. These
threads all intersect in the pilot episode,
establishing the diverse landscapes the
show plans to cover. Seattle itself has many
representative modes: the cinematography
uses establishing shots to transition
between the modern metropolis with the
space needle, the dank setup of the indus
trial waterfront and the solemn flats of
marshland. These contrasting ecosystems,
unified by dark lighting, underline the
contrasting perspectives of the characters
while enabling all of those characters to
pass unobtrusively through all of the set
tings. The muted colors, costumes and
even physical beauty of the actors similarly
highlight the symbolic transformation of
the mundane into the horrific. The typical
procedural draws its life from tales of pros
titutes, extramarital affairs and celebrities,
but "The Killing" actively resists this urge
to sensationalize. The detectives encourage
Richmond to wait to go public with the
story of the murder, and he agrees. As he
tells his aide, the lives of his constituents

the vortex of the murder investiga
tion.
"The Killing" exposes its scaf
folding, which both allies it with and
distinguishes it from network proce
dural, through its untraditional rela
tionship to time. The pilot episode
begins with deadlines Linden has
a flight at 9, Stanley Larsen has boxes
to move and Richmond dashes
between meetings and scheduled
appearances. The constant references
to the amount of time that has
passed or that remains reminds us
that those predictions are broken in
the world of the investigation, with
Linden transforming "just a minute"
into 20 of them and her boss asking
her to stay another 24 hours. Linden,
planning to move to California to
meet her fiance at the outset of the
episode, is still with us two hours
later and has communicated to her
replacement, Holder, that there is no
time in homicide. The show, in the
world of politics, high school or
criminal investigation, generates sus
pense by obliterating time, not
enslaving itself to it as procedural
normally do.

Ultimately, this disregard for
conventions of time aligns with the
show's desire to depict how we com
municate and absorb information.
These issues lie at the core of proce
durals: when will a suspect stop

lying, when will the light bulb go off
in the detective's head? Consistently

throughout the episode, we see a
character's auditory comprehension
over the phone arrested by a visual
interruption, perhaps to imply that
the common structure of even our
conversations is a fallacy. After
Linden's blunt classroom investiga
tion fails, Holder gleans information
from two high school soccer players
by affecting a role himself, a method
usually unavailable to detectives.

Richmond instructs an associate to
investigate the emails of his two most
senior aides, as if the truth of their
intent lies not in their words but the
action of sending a message to the
wrong person. The second episode
concludes with repeated photo
graphic captures of a bloody hand
on the wall before cutting to black, a
device repeated from Linden's own

the second time, it solidifies only our
curiosity is that really blood? Or
