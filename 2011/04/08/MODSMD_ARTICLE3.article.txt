## Endorsing groups explain decisions 
### BILLY GALLAGHER STAFF WRITER 
Many campus organizations
choose to sponsor candidates for
ASSU elections in order to better in
form their constituents. Endorsing
groups email their large lists, update
their Facebook pages, put up flyers
and hold events to introduce their
endorsed candidates to members of
their community.
The Daily spoke with leaders
from the major endorsement groups
on campus to break down what they

stand for and how they decide on en
dorsements.

The Students of Color Coalition
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) includes six student groups:
the Asian American Students' Asso
ciation (A AS A), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO).

SOCC Liaison Tiq Chapa 'll said
a majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical
year. This year, SOCC endorsed 15
candidates for Undergraduate Sen
ate and gave its support to Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis for Executive.

The Queer Coalition
The Queer Coalition has existed
for three years and is composed of
representatives from queer volun
tary student organizations (QVSOs)
such as the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), La Familia and

Black and Queer at Stanford
(BIaQS).
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 was quick to
make a distinction between Queer
Coalition and SSQL.
"The Queer Coalition is not the
same as SSQL," Fetter wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"It is a group that represents all
QVSOs and SSQL is only one part
of that group," Fetter said. "This con
flation of SSQL and anything queer
at Stanford is so common and so
problematic."
Representatives from each

QVSO get together to interview
candidates and decide who to en
dorse. This year, the Queer Coalition
endorsed eight Undergraduate Sen
ate candidates and Cruz & Macgre
gor-Dennis for Executive.
"As part of the endorsement, we
will work with endorsed senators to
educate them about queer issues and
about issues to work on in the ASSU
and to advocate for in the larger
Stanford community," Kevin
Roberts 'l3, BIaQS co-president,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The Green Alliance for Innovative
Action
GAIA is a coalition of the main
sustainability-focused student
groups at Stanford. Its current part
ners include Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS), the Green Liv
ing Council (GLC), Engineers for a
Sustainable World (ESW), the Stan
ford Wind and Energy Project
(SWEP), Energy Crossroads (EC)
and IDEAS.
A review board of seven mem
bers from the GAIA member
groups reviewed applications and
conducted interviews with Senate
candidates and Executive slates.

Theo Gibbs 'll, the current
ASSU sustainability chair, said re
view board members anonymously
scored each candidate according to a
set of evaluation criteria, with a total
possible score of 15 points. Senate
candidates who received 11 points or
more were approved for endorse
ment.

The two Exec slates were tied for
points so the review board held a
separate vote in order to make the
decision. To avoid conflict of interest
issues, Gibbs, who is currently on the
Executive Cabinet, was present at
the interviews and gave comments,
but did not vote or score any of the
candidates.
Gibbs said the GAIA endorse
ment affected candidates' campaign
practices.
"GAIA endorsement means not
only including environmental and

social sustainability in policy, but also
in practice," Gibbs wrote in an email
to The Daily. "We require our candi
dates to commit to environmentally
responsible campaigning practices,
such as reduced flyering and using
reused paper or 100-percent recy
cled content paper."

The Jewish Student Association

The JSA executive committee,
President Isaac Bleaman 'l2 and two
vice presidents read applications and
interviewed candidates for endorse
ments. The JSA makes its decisions
based solely on these applications and
interviews.

"We hope our endorsement is a
meaningful component of our candi
dates' campaigns," Bleaman wrote in
an email to The Daily. "And we look
forward to maintaining a relationship
with them throughout their term."

Women's Coalition
The Women's Coalition is made up
of more than 30 women's voluntary
student organizations (VSOs) and
more than 60 individual members
from the groups. Candidates must
complete an application that asks
what experience have they have with
women's issues as well as general
problems facing women at Stanford.
They are interviewed at the Women's
Community Center.
The five-member core of the
Women's Coalition is responsible for
final decisions, although WVSO lead
ers also have decision-making power
and were invited to deliberate on can
didates.
The Women's Coalition has en
dorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for Executive
and 12 candidates for Undergraduate
Senate.

"There are many issues facing
women at Stanford, one of the most
important of which is sexual assault
and relationship abuse," wrote Vi
viana Arcia 'l3, president of the
Women's Coalition, in an email to The
Daily. "As such, WoCo is committed to
endorsing, educating and supporting
ASSU representatives to serve as al
lies and advocates for women and
their concerns."

The Stanford Democrats

Among the Stanford Democrats,
an eight-member board interviews
and selects candidates to endorse.
They do not set a limit on the number
of Senate candidates they endorse. If
they do not come to consensus on a
particular endorsement, they will use
a majority vote. The Dems have en
dorsed eight Undergraduate Senate
candidates and Cruz & Macgregor-
Dennis for Executive.

Andy Parker 'll, president of the
Stanford Democrats, explained that
they consider issues beyond the Stan
ford bubble when making their en
dorsement.
"We choose candidates that will
advocate for and support Democratic
priorities on campus and at the local,
state and national levels," Parker
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
endorse candidates because we have
seen the impact that they can make."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Review

The Stanford Review's Editorial
Board endorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for
Executive this year.
"The Review sought to identify
those candidates who would best em
brace their roles as responsible,

thoughtful, effective leaders of this
student body," wrote Review Editor
in Chief Autumn Carter 'll of her
publication's selection process in an
April 5 article.
"Specifically, we sought to identify
those candidates who would allocate
your money efficiently and under
budget," she said. "We sought candi
dates whose minds were open to alter
native assessments and proposed so
lutions to campus problems surround
ing issues such as wellness, diversity,
appropriations and free speech."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Daily

The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board is an independent entity from
The Stanford Daily. The Editor-in-
Chief chooses the Editorial Board
chair through an interview process,
usually with the help of a few senior
editors. The Editorial Board chair
then selects a number of students to
the Board. The number isn't mandat
ed but typically totals six or seven
members.

This year, Adam Creasman 'll is
the Editorial Board chair. He is joined
by seven members: Stephanie Garrett
'l2, Nick Baldo 'l2, Ada Kulenovic
'll, Cyrus Navabi 'll, Varun Sivaram
'll, Tiq Chapa 'lO and Andy Parker
'll.

Members Chapa and Parker re
cused themselves from the Board's
endorsement process this year be
cause of their affiliations with the
SOCC and Stanford Democrats en
dorsement processes, respectively.
The Daily Editorial Board only
endorses Executive candidates. It
makes its decision based on inter
views with the Executive slates. This
year, the Editorial Board chose to en
dorse Tenzin-Vasquez for ASSU Ex
ecutive.

According to Elections Commis
sioner Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the en
dorsements process is not regulated at
all, except for Executive slates who
may receive financial help from their
endorsing groups.

"As someone who has seen elec
tions,it's a thing candidates use to show
they are supported by a community,
and those groups help do the ground
workhe said. "I don't think there are
any problems with it all. It can be im
proved, but it doesn't give them an ad
vantage officially over anyone else."

their Facebook pages, put up flyers
and hold events to introduce their
endorsed candidates to members of
their community.
The Daily spoke with leaders
from the major endorsement groups
on campus to break down what they

stand for and how they decide on en
dorsements.

The Students of Color Coalition
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) includes six student groups:
the Asian American Students' Asso
ciation (A AS A), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO).

SOCC Liaison Tiq Chapa 'll said
a majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical
year. This year, SOCC endorsed 15
candidates for Undergraduate Sen
ate and gave its support to Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis for Executive.

The Queer Coalition
The Queer Coalition has existed
for three years and is composed of
representatives from queer volun
tary student organizations (QVSOs)
such as the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), La Familia and

Black and Queer at Stanford
(BIaQS).
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 was quick to
make a distinction between Queer
Coalition and SSQL.
"The Queer Coalition is not the
same as SSQL," Fetter wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"It is a group that represents all
QVSOs and SSQL is only one part
of that group," Fetter said. "This con
flation of SSQL and anything queer
at Stanford is so common and so
problematic."
Representatives from each

QVSO get together to interview
candidates and decide who to en
dorse. This year, the Queer Coalition
endorsed eight Undergraduate Sen
ate candidates and Cruz & Macgre
gor-Dennis for Executive.
"As part of the endorsement, we
will work with endorsed senators to
educate them about queer issues and
about issues to work on in the ASSU
and to advocate for in the larger
Stanford community," Kevin
Roberts 'l3, BIaQS co-president,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The Green Alliance for Innovative
Action
GAIA is a coalition of the main
sustainability-focused student
groups at Stanford. Its current part
ners include Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS), the Green Liv
ing Council (GLC), Engineers for a
Sustainable World (ESW), the Stan
ford Wind and Energy Project
(SWEP), Energy Crossroads (EC)
and IDEAS.
A review board of seven mem
bers from the GAIA member
groups reviewed applications and
conducted interviews with Senate
candidates and Executive slates.

Theo Gibbs 'll, the current
ASSU sustainability chair, said re
view board members anonymously
scored each candidate according to a
set of evaluation criteria, with a total
possible score of 15 points. Senate
candidates who received 11 points or
more were approved for endorse
ment.

The two Exec slates were tied for
points so the review board held a
separate vote in order to make the
decision. To avoid conflict of interest
issues, Gibbs, who is currently on the
Executive Cabinet, was present at
the interviews and gave comments,
but did not vote or score any of the
candidates.
Gibbs said the GAIA endorse
ment affected candidates' campaign
practices.
"GAIA endorsement means not
only including environmental and

social sustainability in policy, but also
in practice," Gibbs wrote in an email
to The Daily. "We require our candi
dates to commit to environmentally
responsible campaigning practices,
such as reduced flyering and using
reused paper or 100-percent recy
cled content paper."

The Jewish Student Association

The JSA executive committee,
President Isaac Bleaman 'l2 and two
vice presidents read applications and
interviewed candidates for endorse
ments. The JSA makes its decisions
based solely on these applications and
interviews.

"We hope our endorsement is a
meaningful component of our candi
dates' campaigns," Bleaman wrote in
an email to The Daily. "And we look
forward to maintaining a relationship
with them throughout their term."

Women's Coalition
The Women's Coalition is made up
of more than 30 women's voluntary
student organizations (VSOs) and
more than 60 individual members
from the groups. Candidates must
complete an application that asks
what experience have they have with
women's issues as well as general
problems facing women at Stanford.
They are interviewed at the Women's
Community Center.
The five-member core of the
Women's Coalition is responsible for
final decisions, although WVSO lead
ers also have decision-making power
and were invited to deliberate on can
didates.
The Women's Coalition has en
dorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for Executive
and 12 candidates for Undergraduate
Senate.

"There are many issues facing
women at Stanford, one of the most
important of which is sexual assault
and relationship abuse," wrote Vi
viana Arcia 'l3, president of the
Women's Coalition, in an email to The
Daily. "As such, WoCo is committed to
endorsing, educating and supporting
ASSU representatives to serve as al
lies and advocates for women and
their concerns."

The Stanford Democrats

Among the Stanford Democrats,
an eight-member board interviews
and selects candidates to endorse.
They do not set a limit on the number
of Senate candidates they endorse. If
they do not come to consensus on a
particular endorsement, they will use
a majority vote. The Dems have en
dorsed eight Undergraduate Senate
candidates and Cruz & Macgregor-
Dennis for Executive.

Andy Parker 'll, president of the
Stanford Democrats, explained that
they consider issues beyond the Stan
ford bubble when making their en
dorsement.
"We choose candidates that will
advocate for and support Democratic
priorities on campus and at the local,
state and national levels," Parker
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
endorse candidates because we have
seen the impact that they can make."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Review

The Stanford Review's Editorial
Board endorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for
Executive this year.
"The Review sought to identify
those candidates who would best em
brace their roles as responsible,

thoughtful, effective leaders of this
student body," wrote Review Editor
in Chief Autumn Carter 'll of her
publication's selection process in an
April 5 article.
"Specifically, we sought to identify
those candidates who would allocate
your money efficiently and under
budget," she said. "We sought candi
dates whose minds were open to alter
native assessments and proposed so
lutions to campus problems surround
ing issues such as wellness, diversity,
appropriations and free speech."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Daily

The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board is an independent entity from
The Stanford Daily. The Editor-in-
Chief chooses the Editorial Board
chair through an interview process,
usually with the help of a few senior
editors. The Editorial Board chair
then selects a number of students to
the Board. The number isn't mandat
ed but typically totals six or seven
members.

This year, Adam Creasman 'll is
the Editorial Board chair. He is joined
by seven members: Stephanie Garrett
'l2, Nick Baldo 'l2, Ada Kulenovic
'll, Cyrus Navabi 'll, Varun Sivaram
'll, Tiq Chapa 'lO and Andy Parker
'll.

Members Chapa and Parker re
cused themselves from the Board's
endorsement process this year be
cause of their affiliations with the
SOCC and Stanford Democrats en
dorsement processes, respectively.
The Daily Editorial Board only
endorses Executive candidates. It
makes its decision based on inter
views with the Executive slates. This
year, the Editorial Board chose to en
dorse Tenzin-Vasquez for ASSU Ex
ecutive.

According to Elections Commis
sioner Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the en
dorsements process is not regulated at
all, except for Executive slates who
may receive financial help from their
endorsing groups.

"As someone who has seen elec
tions,it's a thing candidates use to show
they are supported by a community,
and those groups help do the ground
workhe said. "I don't think there are
any problems with it all. It can be im
proved, but it doesn't give them an ad
vantage officially over anyone else."

on campus to break down what they

stand for and how they decide on en
dorsements.

The Students of Color Coalition
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) includes six student groups:
the Asian American Students' Asso
ciation (A AS A), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO).

SOCC Liaison Tiq Chapa 'll said
a majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical
year. This year, SOCC endorsed 15
candidates for Undergraduate Sen
ate and gave its support to Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis for Executive.

The Queer Coalition
The Queer Coalition has existed
for three years and is composed of
representatives from queer volun
tary student organizations (QVSOs)
such as the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), La Familia and

Black and Queer at Stanford
(BIaQS).
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 was quick to
make a distinction between Queer
Coalition and SSQL.
"The Queer Coalition is not the
same as SSQL," Fetter wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"It is a group that represents all
QVSOs and SSQL is only one part
of that group," Fetter said. "This con
flation of SSQL and anything queer
at Stanford is so common and so
problematic."
Representatives from each

QVSO get together to interview
candidates and decide who to en
dorse. This year, the Queer Coalition
endorsed eight Undergraduate Sen
ate candidates and Cruz & Macgre
gor-Dennis for Executive.
"As part of the endorsement, we
will work with endorsed senators to
educate them about queer issues and
about issues to work on in the ASSU
and to advocate for in the larger
Stanford community," Kevin
Roberts 'l3, BIaQS co-president,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The Green Alliance for Innovative
Action
GAIA is a coalition of the main
sustainability-focused student
groups at Stanford. Its current part
ners include Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS), the Green Liv
ing Council (GLC), Engineers for a
Sustainable World (ESW), the Stan
ford Wind and Energy Project
(SWEP), Energy Crossroads (EC)
and IDEAS.
A review board of seven mem
bers from the GAIA member
groups reviewed applications and
conducted interviews with Senate
candidates and Executive slates.

Theo Gibbs 'll, the current
ASSU sustainability chair, said re
view board members anonymously
scored each candidate according to a
set of evaluation criteria, with a total
possible score of 15 points. Senate
candidates who received 11 points or
more were approved for endorse
ment.

The two Exec slates were tied for
points so the review board held a
separate vote in order to make the
decision. To avoid conflict of interest
issues, Gibbs, who is currently on the
Executive Cabinet, was present at
the interviews and gave comments,
but did not vote or score any of the
candidates.
Gibbs said the GAIA endorse
ment affected candidates' campaign
practices.
"GAIA endorsement means not
only including environmental and

social sustainability in policy, but also
in practice," Gibbs wrote in an email
to The Daily. "We require our candi
dates to commit to environmentally
responsible campaigning practices,
such as reduced flyering and using
reused paper or 100-percent recy
cled content paper."

The Jewish Student Association

The JSA executive committee,
President Isaac Bleaman 'l2 and two
vice presidents read applications and
interviewed candidates for endorse
ments. The JSA makes its decisions
based solely on these applications and
interviews.

"We hope our endorsement is a
meaningful component of our candi
dates' campaigns," Bleaman wrote in
an email to The Daily. "And we look
forward to maintaining a relationship
with them throughout their term."

Women's Coalition
The Women's Coalition is made up
of more than 30 women's voluntary
student organizations (VSOs) and
more than 60 individual members
from the groups. Candidates must
complete an application that asks
what experience have they have with
women's issues as well as general
problems facing women at Stanford.
They are interviewed at the Women's
Community Center.
The five-member core of the
Women's Coalition is responsible for
final decisions, although WVSO lead
ers also have decision-making power
and were invited to deliberate on can
didates.
The Women's Coalition has en
dorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for Executive
and 12 candidates for Undergraduate
Senate.

"There are many issues facing
women at Stanford, one of the most
important of which is sexual assault
and relationship abuse," wrote Vi
viana Arcia 'l3, president of the
Women's Coalition, in an email to The
Daily. "As such, WoCo is committed to
endorsing, educating and supporting
ASSU representatives to serve as al
lies and advocates for women and
their concerns."

The Stanford Democrats

Among the Stanford Democrats,
an eight-member board interviews
and selects candidates to endorse.
They do not set a limit on the number
of Senate candidates they endorse. If
they do not come to consensus on a
particular endorsement, they will use
a majority vote. The Dems have en
dorsed eight Undergraduate Senate
candidates and Cruz & Macgregor-
Dennis for Executive.

Andy Parker 'll, president of the
Stanford Democrats, explained that
they consider issues beyond the Stan
ford bubble when making their en
dorsement.
"We choose candidates that will
advocate for and support Democratic
priorities on campus and at the local,
state and national levels," Parker
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
endorse candidates because we have
seen the impact that they can make."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Review

The Stanford Review's Editorial
Board endorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for
Executive this year.
"The Review sought to identify
those candidates who would best em
brace their roles as responsible,

thoughtful, effective leaders of this
student body," wrote Review Editor
in Chief Autumn Carter 'll of her
publication's selection process in an
April 5 article.
"Specifically, we sought to identify
those candidates who would allocate
your money efficiently and under
budget," she said. "We sought candi
dates whose minds were open to alter
native assessments and proposed so
lutions to campus problems surround
ing issues such as wellness, diversity,
appropriations and free speech."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Daily

The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board is an independent entity from
The Stanford Daily. The Editor-in-
Chief chooses the Editorial Board
chair through an interview process,
usually with the help of a few senior
editors. The Editorial Board chair
then selects a number of students to
the Board. The number isn't mandat
ed but typically totals six or seven
members.

This year, Adam Creasman 'll is
the Editorial Board chair. He is joined
by seven members: Stephanie Garrett
'l2, Nick Baldo 'l2, Ada Kulenovic
'll, Cyrus Navabi 'll, Varun Sivaram
'll, Tiq Chapa 'lO and Andy Parker
'll.

Members Chapa and Parker re
cused themselves from the Board's
endorsement process this year be
cause of their affiliations with the
SOCC and Stanford Democrats en
dorsement processes, respectively.
The Daily Editorial Board only
endorses Executive candidates. It
makes its decision based on inter
views with the Executive slates. This
year, the Editorial Board chose to en
dorse Tenzin-Vasquez for ASSU Ex
ecutive.

According to Elections Commis
sioner Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the en
dorsements process is not regulated at
all, except for Executive slates who
may receive financial help from their
endorsing groups.

"As someone who has seen elec
tions,it's a thing candidates use to show
they are supported by a community,
and those groups help do the ground
workhe said. "I don't think there are
any problems with it all. It can be im
proved, but it doesn't give them an ad
vantage officially over anyone else."

Many campus organizations
choose to sponsor candidates for

the Asian American Students' Asso
ciation (A AS A), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO).

SOCC Liaison Tiq Chapa 'll said
a majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical
year. This year, SOCC endorsed 15
candidates for Undergraduate Sen
ate and gave its support to Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis for Executive.

The Queer Coalition
The Queer Coalition has existed
for three years and is composed of
representatives from queer volun
tary student organizations (QVSOs)
such as the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), La Familia and

Black and Queer at Stanford
(BIaQS).
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 was quick to
make a distinction between Queer
Coalition and SSQL.
"The Queer Coalition is not the
same as SSQL," Fetter wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"It is a group that represents all
QVSOs and SSQL is only one part
of that group," Fetter said. "This con
flation of SSQL and anything queer
at Stanford is so common and so
problematic."
Representatives from each

QVSO get together to interview
candidates and decide who to en
dorse. This year, the Queer Coalition
endorsed eight Undergraduate Sen
ate candidates and Cruz & Macgre
gor-Dennis for Executive.
"As part of the endorsement, we
will work with endorsed senators to
educate them about queer issues and
about issues to work on in the ASSU
and to advocate for in the larger
Stanford community," Kevin
Roberts 'l3, BIaQS co-president,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The Green Alliance for Innovative
Action
GAIA is a coalition of the main
sustainability-focused student
groups at Stanford. Its current part
ners include Students for a Sustain
able Stanford (SSS), the Green Liv
ing Council (GLC), Engineers for a
Sustainable World (ESW), the Stan
ford Wind and Energy Project
(SWEP), Energy Crossroads (EC)
and IDEAS.
A review board of seven mem
bers from the GAIA member
groups reviewed applications and
conducted interviews with Senate
candidates and Executive slates.

Theo Gibbs 'll, the current
ASSU sustainability chair, said re
view board members anonymously
scored each candidate according to a
set of evaluation criteria, with a total
possible score of 15 points. Senate
candidates who received 11 points or
more were approved for endorse
ment.

The two Exec slates were tied for
points so the review board held a
separate vote in order to make the
decision. To avoid conflict of interest
issues, Gibbs, who is currently on the
Executive Cabinet, was present at
the interviews and gave comments,
but did not vote or score any of the
candidates.
Gibbs said the GAIA endorse
ment affected candidates' campaign
practices.
"GAIA endorsement means not
only including environmental and

social sustainability in policy, but also
in practice," Gibbs wrote in an email
to The Daily. "We require our candi
dates to commit to environmentally
responsible campaigning practices,
such as reduced flyering and using
reused paper or 100-percent recy
cled content paper."

The Jewish Student Association

The JSA executive committee,
President Isaac Bleaman 'l2 and two
vice presidents read applications and
interviewed candidates for endorse
ments. The JSA makes its decisions
based solely on these applications and
interviews.

"We hope our endorsement is a
meaningful component of our candi
dates' campaigns," Bleaman wrote in
an email to The Daily. "And we look
forward to maintaining a relationship
with them throughout their term."

Women's Coalition
The Women's Coalition is made up
of more than 30 women's voluntary
student organizations (VSOs) and
more than 60 individual members
from the groups. Candidates must
complete an application that asks
what experience have they have with
women's issues as well as general
problems facing women at Stanford.
They are interviewed at the Women's
Community Center.
The five-member core of the
Women's Coalition is responsible for
final decisions, although WVSO lead
ers also have decision-making power
and were invited to deliberate on can
didates.
The Women's Coalition has en
dorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for Executive
and 12 candidates for Undergraduate
Senate.

"There are many issues facing
women at Stanford, one of the most
important of which is sexual assault
and relationship abuse," wrote Vi
viana Arcia 'l3, president of the
Women's Coalition, in an email to The
Daily. "As such, WoCo is committed to
endorsing, educating and supporting
ASSU representatives to serve as al
lies and advocates for women and
their concerns."

The Stanford Democrats

Among the Stanford Democrats,
an eight-member board interviews
and selects candidates to endorse.
They do not set a limit on the number
of Senate candidates they endorse. If
they do not come to consensus on a
particular endorsement, they will use
a majority vote. The Dems have en
dorsed eight Undergraduate Senate
candidates and Cruz & Macgregor-
Dennis for Executive.

Andy Parker 'll, president of the
Stanford Democrats, explained that
they consider issues beyond the Stan
ford bubble when making their en
dorsement.
"We choose candidates that will
advocate for and support Democratic
priorities on campus and at the local,
state and national levels," Parker
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
endorse candidates because we have
seen the impact that they can make."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Review

The Stanford Review's Editorial
Board endorsed Tenzin-Vasquez for
Executive this year.
"The Review sought to identify
those candidates who would best em
brace their roles as responsible,

thoughtful, effective leaders of this
student body," wrote Review Editor
in Chief Autumn Carter 'll of her
publication's selection process in an
April 5 article.
"Specifically, we sought to identify
those candidates who would allocate
your money efficiently and under
budget," she said. "We sought candi
dates whose minds were open to alter
native assessments and proposed so
lutions to campus problems surround
ing issues such as wellness, diversity,
appropriations and free speech."

The Editorial Board of the Stanford
Daily

The Stanford Daily Editorial
Board is an independent entity from
The Stanford Daily. The Editor-in-
Chief chooses the Editorial Board
chair through an interview process,
usually with the help of a few senior
editors. The Editorial Board chair
then selects a number of students to
the Board. The number isn't mandat
ed but typically totals six or seven
members.

This year, Adam Creasman 'll is
the Editorial Board chair. He is joined
by seven members: Stephanie Garrett
'l2, Nick Baldo 'l2, Ada Kulenovic
'll, Cyrus Navabi 'll, Varun Sivaram
'll, Tiq Chapa 'lO and Andy Parker
'll.

Members Chapa and Parker re
cused themselves from the Board's
endorsement process this year be
cause of their affiliations with the
SOCC and Stanford Democrats en
dorsement processes, respectively.
The Daily Editorial Board only
endorses Executive candidates. It
makes its decision based on inter
views with the Executive slates. This
year, the Editorial Board chose to en
dorse Tenzin-Vasquez for ASSU Ex
ecutive.

According to Elections Commis
sioner Stephen Trusheim 'l3, the en
dorsements process is not regulated at
all, except for Executive slates who
may receive financial help from their
endorsing groups.

"As someone who has seen elec
tions,it's a thing candidates use to show
they are supported by a community,
and those groups help do the ground
workhe said. "I don't think there are
any problems with it all. It can be im
proved, but it doesn't give them an ad
vantage officially over anyone else."
