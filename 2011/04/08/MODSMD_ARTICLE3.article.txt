# STUDENT GOV'T
## Endorsing groups explain decisions 
### BILLY GALLAGHER STAFF WRITER 
Many campus organizations
choose to sponsor candidates for
ASSU elections in order to better in
form their constituents. Endorsing
groups email their large lists, update
their Facebook pages, put up flyers
and hold events to introduce their
endorsed candidates to members of
their community.
The Daily spoke with leaders
from the major endorsement groups
on campus to break down what they

stand for and how they decide on en
dorsements.

The Students of Color Coalition
The Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) includes six student groups:
the Asian American Students' Asso
ciation (A AS A), the Black Student
Union (BSU), Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA),
the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work (MSAN), the National Associ
ation for the Advancement of Col
ored People (NAACP) and the
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation (SAIO).

SOCC Liaison Tiq Chapa 'll said
a majority of candidates apply for
SOCC endorsement in a typical
year. This year, SOCC endorsed 15
candidates for Undergraduate Sen
ate and gave its support to Cruz &
Macgregor-Dennis for Executive.

The Queer Coalition
The Queer Coalition has existed
for three years and is composed of
representatives from queer volun
tary student organizations (QVSOs)
such as the Queer/Straight Alliance
(QSA), Stanford Students for Queer
Liberation (SSQL), La Familia and

Black and Queer at Stanford
(BIaQS).
SSQL co-president and Daily
staffer Holly Fetter 'l3 was quick to
make a distinction between Queer
Coalition and SSQL.
"The Queer Coalition is not the
same as SSQL," Fetter wrote in an
email to The Daily.
"It is a group that represents all
QVSOs and SSQL is only one part
of that group," Fetter said. "This con
flation of SSQL and anything queer
at Stanford is so common and so
problematic."
Representatives from each

QVSO get together to interview
candidates and decide who to en
dorse. This year, the Queer Coalition
endorsed eight Undergraduate Sen
ate candidates and Cruz & Macgre
gor-Dennis for Executive.
"As part of the endorsement, we
will work with endorsed senators to
educate them about queer issues and
about issues to work on in the ASSU
and to advocate for in the larger
Stanford community," Kevin
Roberts 'l3, BIaQS co-president,
wrote in an email to The Daily.
