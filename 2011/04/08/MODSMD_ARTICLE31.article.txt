To grow white asparagus, the
spears of the vegetable are shaded
from the sunlight, thereby inhibit
ing the formation of the chlorophyll that
gives the normal variety its characteristic
green color. The same mechanism was
used to breed the form of white cauli
flower that is the most common in the
U.S. Cauliflower is available in myriad
colors, however, and some of these alter
nate varieties come with additional bene
fits; purple cauliflower, for example, is
loaded with the same antioxidants found
in red wine. Unlike the successful differ
entiation of colored cauliflower, A.G.
Ferrari Foods' attempt to stand out
from the typical sandwich stop and
market falls flat.
A.G. is a cute market for imported
Italian fare such as olive oil and pasta,
with a deli full of pre-made goods as well
as sandwiches made to order. There are a
couple of tables for patrons to eat lunch
in the restaurant, but one could just as
easily order a picnic to go.
There are some phenomenal sand
wiches. The Puglia is scrumptious. The
roasted vegetables are tender but perfectly
al dente and provide a nice contrast with
the mozzarella. The sandwich masterfully
balances sweet, sour and salty and is
encapsulated in an absolutely amazing
rustic baguette. Most sandwich options,
however, are less noteworthy. The
Campania is similar to a caprese salad on
a fluffy filone, and while certainly tasty, is
a step short of the Puglia, its vegetarian

relative. The Sardegna tuna salad sand
wich pairs a mild tapenade with a tuna
salad that is not too heavy on the mayon
naise, but the focaccia is cottony and

swallows some of the flavor. The ciabatta
that comes with the Tuscana sandwich is
tough and, when combined with the sala
mi, creates a chewy sandwich that is
savory but too much to wrestle with. The
Basilicata sandwich has such an incredi
ble lightness to it that it is a shame it
comes off as so bland. The sun-dried
tomatoes and roasted red pepper sauce

are not as sweet as they need to be to
impart any excitement to this sandwich.

There are a host of decent deli
options, but none are spectacular. The
Polletto chicken wings have a subtle hint
of molasses sweetness to them, but the
meat is not particularly tender and is a bit
too tough to work off the bone. The

Fritelle di Carciofi artichoke heart hitter
has a creamy texture and is smooth
enough to let the artichoke come
through, but the shell lacks the crispiness
that lends fritters their satisfying crunch.
The butternut squash soup is hearty
without being excessively rich, but the fla
vor profile is relatively one-dimensional.

There are also some clear misses on
the menu. The Frittata di Spinaci is a
spinach, egg and potato torte that has an
almost marine overtone; despite its pleas
ant, fluffy texture, it does not heat up well
and the taste is off. Likewise, the
Lenticchie e Spinaci lentil salad is exces
sively vinegary and an overall disaster.
If you order well, A.G. Ferrari has
good potential as a casual lunch spot,
especially well suited for balmy spring
and summer weather. Unfortunately,
there are enough holes in the menu and
generally mediocre plates that you could
leave somewhat disappointed, especially if
your order is going to be placed in the
microwave and eaten in the store. In light
of all the potential pitfalls, A.G. Ferrari
ends up in the "middle of the road."
