After almost three years without
releasing a new record, Matt
Wertz returns to the music
scene with his new album, "Weights &
Wings."
"I had the name of the album
before I had any songs," Wertz said. "It
kind of guided the writing of what the
songs were going to be." "Weights" rep
resent the hardships in life and "wings"
the hope and lightness that keep you
going.
As March 15, the release date for
"Weights & Wings," approached, Wertz
adopted an offbeat strategy to get his
fans pumped up and excited for the
new record. Fans could access one new
song per day from the not-yet-released
album by visiting Wertz s Ping page on
iTunes. This method allowed visitors to
listen to the new songs for free and
with no limit.
"We wanted to utilize social
media as much as possible and engage
people daily' he said. Did it work?

"People really responded to the album.
I think it was a good thing to do."
Anyone who has been to a Matt
Wertz concert in the last five years will
know about his support for The
Mocha Club, a non-profit organization
that runs community projects in
Africa.
"The Mocha Club was started by
a friend of mine, Barrett [Ward],"
Wertz said. "The idea is to give $7 a
month so the cost of two mochas.
It's a minimal sacrifice for a big
impact." To make matters even better,
Wertz offers his album for free to those
who sign up.
Wertz, originally from Liberty,
Mo., has for the past seven years made
his home in Nashville, a city known for
its music scene. We wanted to know
what long-term plans the 32-year-old
songwriter had.

"If you're asking if I have any
career goals, I really don't," he said,
"But I'd love to have a family someday.
That's probably is the biggest goal that
I have." After a moment of reminiscing
about childhood road trips, Wertz
talked about what he does when he's
not working. "I like to just hang out
with friends, throw some Frisbee,
watch snowboarding in the winter
time, play golf. I've got an old truck too
that I love to just drive around. Pretty
simple, I guess."
Matt Wertz will be playing the
Swedish American Hall in San
Francisco on April 14.
