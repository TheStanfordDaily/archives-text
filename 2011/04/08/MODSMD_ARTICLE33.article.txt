## ROXY SASS Sexy timez Bucket List 
### 
Roxy Sass isn't just a person
she's an institution. As such,
ain't no way she gon' graduate
and leave this place. But as spring
blooms forth, why pretend like you're
not envious of (non-thesis-writing)
seniors? They have that je ne sais quoi,
they know all the hippest lawns upon
which to lounge, where to buy the
best weed.
And, most importantly, seniors'
time is running out. Roxy's there with
them face it, she's with a lot of
people and she's here to help.
Freshmen, take note. Seniors, take
action. It's Roxy Sass' spring bucket
list of things (and people) to do
before leaving the Farm.
Because, yes, Stanford isn't exact
ly always "Animal House," but from a
logistical standpoint, your chances
will never be better: 6000 undergrads
living within walking distance of your
residence, all at a high level of intelli
gence and athleticism with pre-deter
mined common experiences to rely
on for small talk ("Oh my god, I loved
my IHUM too!"). Love, my friends, is
a mere bike ride away, and Roxy's
ready for one last spin.
Catch the dormmate who got away
Roxy knows the type: the former
dormmate is sweet, elusive and prob
ably wasn't single when he/she lived
down the hall from you back in
Larkin. News flash: springtime is
breakup time and is also therefore
swoop time. Seriously, stop Facebook
stalking and start weekend stalking
before it's too late. Roxy always says:
the difference between an attentive
wooer and a creep is simply whether
or not the prey digs it. Try your luck
or you'll never know.
Confess your hidden love
Roxy's personal opinion?
Feelings are lame and often get in the

way of a good banging. But consider
one's audience: many folk find
romantic feelings the only way to a
good banging, so Roxy's willing to
work with you if you're willing to
work on/in/behind her.
Wake up somewhere unknown
It's literally the best way to get to
know campus through the
absolute necessity of finding your way
home in the gentle morning light. It's
how Roxy discovered exactly where
on that hill Synergy is perched. Plus,
the added morning adventure of piec
ing together your location keeps your
mental agility at its peak. (No cheat
ing and using your iPhone map.)
Sleep with someone who'll be famous
someday
It's not that hard to find some
one on campus to fit the bill. Granted,
one's future success is still pretty up in
the air, but find a good enough bet for
a future CEO, throw your legs up in
the air and, chances are, decades from
now, you'll be able to tell your kids
proudly," [Famous person] ? Yeah, I
tapped that back in college." Roxy's
already proud of you.
Have a threesome
Didn't have a chance to study
abroad in Paris? Experience the won
der of the Eiffel Tower for yourself
here on your very own campus. Sacre
bleu!
