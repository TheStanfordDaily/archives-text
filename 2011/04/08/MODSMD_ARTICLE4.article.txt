# SPRING FOOTBALL FOOTBALL RETURNS TO THE FARM
## Several spots up for grabs 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second straight year,
Stanford football will head up
to San Francisco's Kezar Stadi
um for its annual spring game.
The contest counts as the final
session of the team's 15 off-sea
son practices and is a chance for
the public to see a program
transitioning not just between
seasons, but also between
coaching regimes.
"Hopefully you'll see as
well-oiled a machine as we can
have at this point," said head
coach David Shaw. "I think our
brand of football is pretty excit
ing."

"It's going to be fast and
physical, that's all I know," said
sophomore linebacker Shayne
Skov.

Under Jim Harbaugh,
Shaw's predecessor, the team
was divided based on a draft
that occurred in the lead up to

the scrimmage. Shaw opted
against continuing that exer
cise. Instead, the game will
match up the first team offense
against the second team de
fense, and the second team of
fense against the first team de
fense.

"We want to put together
the team the right away," Shaw
said. "That best serves the team
right now, and that's the best
thing for us to do this year."

Most of the rules of a normal
college football game apply, but
with notable exceptions
chief among them is that while
the contest is otherwise "live,"
the quarterback cannot be hit.
And for good reason: Shaw
returns arguably the nation's
best player in redshirt sopho
more passer Andrew Luck, who
will lead the first-team offense.
Shaw raved about his star's pro
gression.

Redshirt sophomore Andrew Luck (12) turned down potential
millions in the 2011 NFL Draft to return for his junior season. The
Heisman runner-up passed for 3,338 yards and 32 TDs last year.
