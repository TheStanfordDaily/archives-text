# SPRING FOOTBALL FOOTBALL RETURNS TO THE FARM
## Several spots up for grabs 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second straight year,
Stanford football will head up
to San Francisco's Kezar Stadi
um for its annual spring game.
The contest counts as the final
session of the team's 15 off-sea
son practices and is a chance for
the public to see a program
transitioning not just between
seasons, but also between
coaching regimes.
"Hopefully you'll see as
well-oiled a machine as we can
have at this point," said head
coach David Shaw. "I think our
brand of football is pretty excit
ing."

"It's going to be fast and
physical, that's all I know," said
sophomore linebacker Shayne
Skov.

Under Jim Harbaugh,
Shaw's predecessor, the team
was divided based on a draft
that occurred in the lead up to

the scrimmage. Shaw opted
against continuing that exer
cise. Instead, the game will
match up the first team offense
against the second team de
fense, and the second team of
fense against the first team de
fense.

"We want to put together
the team the right away," Shaw
said. "That best serves the team
right now, and that's the best
thing for us to do this year."

Most of the rules of a normal
college football game apply, but
with notable exceptions
chief among them is that while
the contest is otherwise "live,"
the quarterback cannot be hit.
And for good reason: Shaw
returns arguably the nation's
best player in redshirt sopho
more passer Andrew Luck, who
will lead the first-team offense.
Shaw raved about his star's pro
gression.

Redshirt sophomore Andrew Luck (12) turned down potential
millions in the 2011 NFL Draft to return for his junior season. The
Heisman runner-up passed for 3,338 yards and 32 TDs last year.
"I believe he [Luck] has taken
the next step. He has improved,"
Shaw said of last year's Heisman
runner-up. "He's taking complete
command of the offense and com
mand of the team. He's truly push
ing himself each day. What I love
about him is that he's got no com
placency. He wants to improve, he
wants to do better, he wants to
make every throw, he wants to
make every audible, he wants to
make every check."
But, as with many positions, the
depth chart behind Luck is murky.
Redshirt freshmen Josh Nunes and
Robbie Picazo, and true freshmen
Darren Daniel and Brett Notting
ham are all in the mix to back-up
Luck; Shaw hoped to get a number of
passers into the action on Saturday,
but said that the No. 2 quarterback
battle would extend into summer.
This is indicative of the situations
of a number of positions across all
sides of the ball. Shaw was reluctant
to even name front-runners at most
spots with vacancies, and media rela
tions declined to release a roster of
the first and second teams.
On the offensive line, for in
stance, where there are three open
ings, only left guard seems even the
slightest bit set redshirt fresh
man Kevin Danser has been work
ing with the first team since Febru
ary, and appears primed to take
over the spot left open by Andrew
Phillips's graduation. Center re
mains a two-man battle, and right
tackle is a three-horse race.
Among the offensive skill posi
tions, two players who figure to fac
tor highly into Shaw and coordina
tor Pep Hamilton's plans for the
fall junior wide receiver Chris
Owusu and redshirt freshman tight
end Levine Toilolo will not play
on Saturday. Both are recovering
from injuries and have been signifi
cantly limited in spring practice;
Shaw said that holding both men
out was a "precautionary" move.
Owusu's absence in particular
has opened the door for other re
ceivers to assert themselves. His in
jury, along with the upcoming grad
uation of Doug Baldwin and Ryan
Whalen, leaves a number of oppor
tunities for players to prove their
worth. The first-team wide-outs
have mainly been junior Griff
Whalen and sophomore Jamal-
Rashad Patterson, with sophomore
Drew Terrell also in the mix.
"They're doing well," Shaw said.
"Our charge is to get them to play
more consistently."

That mantra was repeated for
nearly every position, and Shaw's
goal for the spring game to see
his athletes play at a high level, with
few ups and downs was not hard
to discern.
Skov echoed his coach's com
ments.
"We need 22 guys who can play
on that field. It's an opportunity for
guys to step up, establish them
selves and prove what they've
learned," he said.
Defensively, many of the open
position battles are still up for
grabs, although some leaders have
emerged: redshirt freshman Ben
Gardner at defensive end, redshirt
junior Max Bergen at inside line
backer and freshman Barry Brown
ing at cornerback. But particularly
on the defensive side of the ball, the
spring practice sessions have
served as away for younger play
ers, especially true freshmen, to get
extended playing time.
"This is really their time, it's
pretty much the first time they get
direct coaching and all of these
reps. It's nice seeing them learn,"
Skov said, highlighting specific
players Joe Hemschoot and AJ
Tarpley in his inside linebacker
unit.
Shaw extrapolated upon that
and highlighted the work of
Browning and safety Devon Car
rington, both of whom played as
freshmen.
While there will be new faces
both on the field and on the side
lines Saturday, overall, the product
and schemes that fans see will not
be dramatically different from the
ones implemented by Harbaugh
and members of the departed staff.
"We haven't made many whole
sale changes. We actually brought a
few new guys in who have added
some things. If anything, we've
added things instead of changed
things," Shaw said.
"There are little things, like with
any change," Skov said. "But we're
still physical. We still come out here
and love going live with full-con
tact."
Skov and the rest of his team
mates will get their opportunity to
demonstrate just that. Kick-off is at
2 p.m. at Kezar. The game will be
broadcast live on ESPN3, the net
work's Internet channel. It will
later be rebroadcast twice on
ESPNU.
