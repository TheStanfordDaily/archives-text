## UNIVERSITY Revs Program extends car research to humanities and social sciences 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Faculty unveiled the Revs Pro
gram at Stanford Thursday in a day
long symposium examining the cul
ture of the automobile.

According to Revs director Cliff
Nass, the program aims to "tap into
this potential for enormous amounts
of research and opportunities for stu
dents to be done that just hasn't been
tapped into, not just by Stanford, but
by no university."
Three other main faculty mem
bers are involved in the launch: clas
sics professor Michael Shanks, asso
ciate mechanical engineering profes
sor Chris Gerdes and mechanical en
gineering lecturer Sven Beiker.
"There's nothing that's been less
studied relative to its importance
than the automobile," Nass said.
"There's so little academic work on
the automobile and its role in society
is so large. The potential is so great
that it really was critical that univer
sities take this on."

Revs is in some ways similar to the
industry-sponsored Center for Auto
motive Research at Stanford
(CARS), a two-year-old program
that brings together researchers, but

seeks a broader approach to studying
cars than just through design work.
"First of all, we envision it being
supported by individuals more so
than industry because it's not look
ing just at the future, but at the pres
ent and the past," he added.

Nass said the idea behind Revs is
"to capture cars in their full general
ity," expanding beyond Stanford's
automobile engineering programs to
"really pull together the people
across the University who have un
derstanding and insights about cars
from the social sciences, from the
humanities, from the law school and
the medical school."
Revs is the brainchild of Florida
philanthropist Miles Collier, who
sought a partnership with an educa
tional institution to put his automo
bile collection to intellectual use.
After considering a number of uni
versities, including Northwestern,
MIT and Carnegie-Mellon, Collier
decided on Stanford.

Revs at Stanford is starting with a
multi-million dollar initial gift from
Collier. Collier's collection, all made
available to the University, consists
of car-related memorabilia and arti
facts, including newspaper clippings,
magazine covers, design plans and

hundreds of thousands of photos.
Collier also owns more than 100 clas
sic cars and vintage replacement
parts for many of them.
"There really isn't an opportunity
available [besides this] to go out and
instrument cars like this and really
understand how cars in the 19305, 40s
and 50s performed, why they made
the design decisions they did,"
Gerdes said.

At least for now, most of the Revs
program's material will continue to
reside at Collier's private Revs Insti
tute in Naples, Florida. Stanford stu
dents and researchers will have the
opportunity to visit the Florida loca
tion, while collectors and experts
may visit Stanford.

On the Farm, one of the Revs pro
gram's goals is to help faculty design
new courses on cars and encourage
people to bring cars into their disci
pline and curriculum. One of the
Revs program's major goals is to
reach out to, for example, someone
who studies 20th century American
literature "and say to them, hey
you've ignored the car," Nass said.
"Let us help you with this amaz
ing archival content, these amazing
people, these amazing artifacts," he
added.
With the Peninsula's changing
technological landscape, the area it
self is an object of study.
"Not only is Silicon Valley be
coming the Detroit of the 21st centu
ry, Silicon Valley is now the heart of

the car industry," Nass said. "So that's
another important change that we'll
be tracing and looking at."
Beiker said that digitizing infor
mation from Collier's archives might
become a substantial part of the pro
gram as well. And when it comes to
research, Beiker envisions taking an
interdisciplinary look at what it was
like to drive a car back in history and
learn from that information to create
future cars.
"One thing is to understand the
past and that's already a big thing in
and of itself," Beiker said. "But
there's this notion that cars are get
ting safer and more comfortable
that's great, but also a little bit more
boring."
With so much car technology
available to examine, we can "study
it to make it exciting again, learning
from these past vehicles," he added.
