## Stanford scholar vies to be next Tibetan PM Tethong pushes Tibet human rights agenda 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Stanford scholar Tenzin
Tethong, who chairs the Tibetan
Studies Initiative, ran for 'Kalon
Tripa,' or Prime Minister, of Tibet's
government-in-exile this March.
Election results will be announced

April 27.
Following the
Dalai Lama's re
cent announce
ment that he will
leave politics, the
Prime Minister's
leadership will
likely be more im
portant in the near
future. Tethong's
opponents are

Harvard scholar Lobsang Sangay
and government-in-exile official
Tashi Wangdi.
According to Tethong, the Ti
betan exile population numbers
approximately 150,000 people, and
80,000 to 90,000 of them registered
to vote. To be eligible, voters need
ed to show proof of financial con
tribution to the India-based gov
ernment-in-exile. The ultimate
turnout was about 70 percent.
Tethong, who previously held
the role of prime minister from
1990 to 1995, said he would work
to promote greater awareness
among the Chinese about the sta
tus of the six million Tibetans liv
ing in China if elected.
Tethong said he sees it as his
duty to speak out on behalf of Ti
betans living in China.
"We want the Chinese people
to understand the true history of
what's happened in Tibet,"
Tethong said. "We want the world

to know that this is not just a com
plicated political problem, but that
this is basically an issue about right
and wrong, an issue about justice."
In 1950, the People's Liberation
Army of China invaded Tibet. Dis
satisfaction with Chinese rule led
to unrest, culminating in a 1959 up
rising in Lhasa during which tens
of thousands of Tibetans were
killed.

Tethong argued that Chinese
leaders must acknowledge this
past and allow Tibetans the right to
self-determination.

"Tibetan society should be an
open, free and democratic socie
ty," he said. "That's a good begin
ning point so we don't have to
argue about history, but we move
ahead and see how best to help the
Tibetan community."
He asserted that although the
Chinese government views social
and political liberalization in Ti
betan areas as a source of instabil
ity, greater freedom would actually
lead to peace.

Born in Lhasa and raised in
India, Tethong has been a life-long
activist for Tibet. In 1967 he joined
the government-in-exile as a trans
lator, and in 1968 he helped start a
magazine in India. From 1973 to
1990, he was the Dalai Lama's rep
resentative in the United States.

Finally, he came to Stanford in
1995 after the history department
invited him to teach a course on Ti
betan history. Since then, he has in
structed a number of courses on
Tibet.

Tethong's other duties at Stan
ford have included work with the
Center for Compassion and Altru
ism Research and Education
(CCARE) and the Ho Center for
Buddhist Studies. He has also been
involved in fundraising for a chair


Tenzin Tethong
in Tibetan Studies.
CCARE Director and School
of Medicine professor James Doty
praised Tethong as an experienced
and committed leader.

"The next several years will be
profound in regard to Tibetans and
the Tibetan Diaspora community
as His Holiness steps away from
active participation in politics,"
Doty wrote in an email to The
Daily. "In this regard, it would
seem that an individual who has
demonstrated his commitment to
the Tibetan people over decades,
has the deep respect of His Holi
ness the Dalai Lama [and has]
worked in a leadership position in
essentially every major Tibet or
ganization would be an ideal prime
minister at such a time of uncer
tainty and change."

Paul Harrison, professor of reli
gious studies and co-Director of
the Ho Center for Buddhist Stud
ies concurred.

"One of the things he has on his
side is experience because he
served in that capacity before and
he has the trust of the Dalai Lama
and of many people in the Tibetan
establishment," Harrison said.
Tethong said his desire to im
prove the world keeps him moti
vated.
"I'm one of those who believes
that the world can and should be a
better place for all, and that's part of
what keeps me involved doing what
one might call 'community work,'"
he said. "I choose to do most of that
within the Tibetan community be
cause I'm most familiar with that
community. I understand its
strengths and weaknesses, and it's
an area in which maybe I can make
my best contribution."
