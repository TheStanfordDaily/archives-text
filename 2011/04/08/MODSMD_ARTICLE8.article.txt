## Website connects candidates to voters Stanford Hub adds 'social component' to elections 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
ASSU elections season is usual
ly marked by a flurry of campaign
events, designed to help candidates
for all elected offices meet and con
nect with students across campus.
However, a new website, Stanford-
Hub.com, is helping Executive and
Class President slates do that on
line. Students log into the website
to put questions to individual slates
using their Facebook accounts, and
candidates respond directly to their
concerns.
Each Executive and Class Presi
dent slate has its own page on the
website and has administrative con
trol over that page. However, the
site does not allow Undergraduate
Senate or Graduate Student Coun
cil candidates to set up their own

pages or respond to questions, and
visitors to the page cannot ask
questions of those candidates. The
site has no official ties to the ASSU,
the Elections Commission or its
Voter Guide.
Four students came together to
build and moderate the website —
Dan Thompson '13, Alex Lin '14,
Bharad Raghavan '14 and Grant
Mathews '13. In an interview with
The Daily, Thompson, Lin and
Raghavan discussed how they got
the idea for the site and how it
evolved.
Thompson explained how the
team had come together during the
Alternative Spring Break trip "So
cial Entrepreneurship in the Bay
Area," during which one of the re
quirements was to come up with a
business project.
"The one we came up with was
connecting students with events,
which is still our primary project —
connecting students with interest
ing events on campus so that they
can be connected with the buzz," he
said.

"We needed to have a strong so
cial component, and we needed to
have everything in place for it to
work," Lin added. "We thought,
'Why don't we just throw up a cam
pus-wide wall?'"
After deciding early last week to
build a website around ASSU elec
tions, the group quickly put togeth
er its initial implementation, with
Mathews as the lead coder. Since
then, it has continued to evolve as
issues cropped up. For example, the
slates running for Sophomore Class
President expressed reservations
about a "leader board" that tracked
which slates were getting the most
clicks.

"They didn't want that competi
tive vibe," Thompson said. "We ba
sically took everybody's feedback
in and tried to make it work for
everyone."
Thompson addressed potential
issues with the website's neutrality,
since he has actively campaigned
for the Cruz & Macgregor-Dennis
Executive slate.
"The site is pretty transparent in
the way it works," he said. "I don't
think there's any inherent advan
tage given to any person."
Lin also explained that the site's
homepage, which lists all the Exec
utive and Class President slates on
the right side of the window, ran
domizes the order in which slates
are displayed for each visit.
A second concern was that allies
of different slates might "plant"
questions for Executive candidates
to answer. However, Thompson
said he was not concerned by that
possibility.
"I don't think [planted ques-

tions] would really help a campaign
because they tend to be pretty obvi
ously easy to answer," he said. "The
interesting challenges the ones
that people would want to read
are the tougher questions."
As for the future of Stanford-
Hub, the group has no immediate
plans for it after the elections are
completed, beyond taking it down
soon after the end of voting Friday
night. However, all three said that it
was likely to reappear, serving their
original goal of connecting students
to events.
"At the end of the week, de
pending on how this goes and the
impact it has on the elections, we'll
decide what the future of the web
site will be," Raghavan said.
