## EDITORIAL To end war and discrimination, bring back ROTC 
### 
Much has been said about
the current advisory
measure to gauge stu
dent support for ROTC's return
to the Stanford campus. In true
Stanford fashion, many novel and
thoughtful arguments in favor of
supporting, abstaining, or reject
ing ROTC have emerged on email
lists and fliers. However, this
Board wishes to address some
widely believed misperceptions,
and urges a "yes" vote on Mea
sure A.

they have graduated, the overrid
ing concern is to send an impor
tant symbolic message to the mili
tary that Stanford will not tolerate
its presence until it reverses its
discrimination against transgen
der people elsewhere.
Yet, even if we ignore the fact
that Stanford has no leverage
the military could fund two cadets
at UC-Berkeley for the cost of
sponsoring every ROTC cadet at
Stanford, and has been quite
happy to do so any attempt to
punish the military until it accedes
to our demands will fail for the
very simple reason that the mili
tary itself has no control over its
hiring policies.

Opponents of Measure A have
built their advocacy around the
assertion that a vote in favor of
ROTC's return constitutes a dis
enfranchisement of minority
rights. Voting on civil rights, the
argument goes, is wrong; a tyran
ny of the majority should not be
allowed to suppress the freedoms
of the few.

The military's policy of dis
crimination against transgender
citizens is written instead by Con
gress, which reexamines military
policy in its annual defense au
thorizations and appropriations.
Indeed, those who genuinely wish
to change military policy should
direct their attention towards
those who speak for California on
congressional military oversight
committees: Dianne Feinstein,
Jerry Lewis, Ken Calvert, Loretta
Sanchez, John Garamendi, Dun
can Hunter, Susan Davis and
Buck McKeon.

The right to attend classes and
participate in on-campus activities,
regardless of one's race, class, sexu
ality, or gender identity, is enshrined
in Stanford's nondiscrimination
policy. Yet, ROTC's return would
not result in the abridgement of any
of these rights on campus; any Stan
ford student, even those who are
transgender, would be welcome to
participate in ROTC classes and
physical training.

Yes, ROTC opponents argue,
but so what if transgender stu
dents can participate in classes or
training? Transgender students
still wouldn't be allowed to com
mission as officers after gradua
tion. Even if ROTC doesn't tech
nically violate Stanford's discrim
ination policy because it only dis
criminates against students after

But even if symbolic punish
ment of the military is misguided,
isn't voting to reject or abstain on
the ROTC ballot measure the
safest course of action? The an
swer is a clear no. In fact, voting
"no" or "abstain" does a very real
disservice to all parties, and not
just for those in uniform.

While keeping ROTC off cam
pus certainly creates significant
headaches for Stanford cadets,
forcing them to travel to other
universities —an inconvenience
that may also deter some ROTC
cadets from accepting admission
at Stanford the real harms are
borne by the rest of us. As the
tenor of this debate has demon
strated, there is a widening chasm
between civilians and the military,
especially on the Farm.
This civilian-military divide
carries very real consequences for
the health of our democracy. As a
nation, we are increasingly send
ing our poorest to fight our wars.
In the absence of a draft, the
wealthy may opt for military serv
ice, but the poor often have few
other options. Some scholars have
argued that this inequitable bur
den on the lower class has re
duced the political costs to fight
ing wars, perhaps explaining why
the United States has become

somewhat of an exception to the
political science theory that dem
ocratic countries are less likely to
go to war. Consider that 180 out of
307 U.S. Army generals have chil
dren in the service, compared to
only 10 out of 535 members of
Congress. That's fewer than the
number of Stanford alumni (11)
currently holding congressional
office.

Out of sight, out of mind: by
keeping the military off campus,
we reinforce the very unsettling
fact that those declaring America's
wars and those actually fighting
them have rarely rubbed elbows.
By opposing ROTC's return,
queer-rights and anti-war advo
cates have made the implicit as
sumption that keeping the military
out of Stanford will somehow lead
to less discrimination or less war.
Yet, why "abstain" and remove
ourselves from the many con
tentious and difficult debates
about a peace-loving nation's use
of organized violence, or who
might serve in that cause? Stan
ford has already produced 18 sen
ators, 33 representatives, many
ambassadors and secretaries of

state and defense, two national se
curity advisors and one president.
By bringing ROTC on campus, we
have to opportunity to promote
such dialogue in an academic envi
ronment and shape the discourse
of America's next generation of
military and civilian leaders.

Advocates for "no" or "ab
stain" votes on Measure A have
legitimate concerns with the mili
tary and the idea of voting on civil
rights. However, this Board finds
that ROTC would not violate
Stanford's discrimination policy,
and urges voters to consider the
effects of keeping ROTC off cam
pus. We have the chance either to
insulate both ourselves and the
military even further or to bring
essential civic debate to our home
turf, where we set the rules of dis
course. Because we believe that
the military will remain an imper
fect institution the longer we try
to ignore and marginalize its role
in our society, this Board strongly
urges a "yes" vote on Measure A.

we reinforce the very unsettling
fact that those declaring America's
wars and those actually fighting
them have rarely rubbed elbows.
By opposing ROTC's return,
queer-rights and anti-war advo
cates have made the implicit as
sumption that keeping the military
out of Stanford will somehow lead
to less discrimination or less war.
Yet, why "abstain" and remove
ourselves from the many con
tentious and difficult debates
about a peace-loving nation's use
of organized violence, or who
might serve in that cause? Stan
ford has already produced 18 sen
ators, 33 representatives, many
ambassadors and secretaries of

state and defense, two national se
curity advisors and one president.
By bringing ROTC on campus, we
have to opportunity to promote
such dialogue in an academic envi
ronment and shape the discourse
of America's next generation of
military and civilian leaders.

Advocates for "no" or "ab
stain" votes on Measure A have
legitimate concerns with the mili
tary and the idea of voting on civil
rights. However, this Board finds
that ROTC would not violate
Stanford's discrimination policy,
and urges voters to consider the
effects of keeping ROTC off cam
pus. We have the chance either to
insulate both ourselves and the
military even further or to bring
essential civic debate to our home
turf, where we set the rules of dis
course. Because we believe that
the military will remain an imper
fect institution the longer we try
to ignore and marginalize its role
in our society, this Board strongly
urges a "yes" vote on Measure A.

Much has been said about
the current advisory
measure to gauge stu
dent support for ROTC's return
to the Stanford campus. In true
Stanford fashion, many novel and
thoughtful arguments in favor of
supporting, abstaining, or reject
ing ROTC have emerged on email
lists and fliers. However, this
Board wishes to address some
widely believed misperceptions,
and urges a "yes" vote on Mea
sure A.

they have graduated, the overrid
ing concern is to send an impor
tant symbolic message to the mili
tary that Stanford will not tolerate
its presence until it reverses its
discrimination against transgen
der people elsewhere.
Yet, even if we ignore the fact
that Stanford has no leverage
the military could fund two cadets
at UC-Berkeley for the cost of
sponsoring every ROTC cadet at
Stanford, and has been quite
happy to do so any attempt to
punish the military until it accedes
to our demands will fail for the
very simple reason that the mili
tary itself has no control over its
hiring policies.

Opponents of Measure A have
built their advocacy around the
assertion that a vote in favor of
ROTC's return constitutes a dis
enfranchisement of minority
rights. Voting on civil rights, the
argument goes, is wrong; a tyran
ny of the majority should not be
allowed to suppress the freedoms
of the few.

The military's policy of dis
crimination against transgender
citizens is written instead by Con
gress, which reexamines military
policy in its annual defense au
thorizations and appropriations.
Indeed, those who genuinely wish
to change military policy should
direct their attention towards
those who speak for California on
congressional military oversight
committees: Dianne Feinstein,
Jerry Lewis, Ken Calvert, Loretta
Sanchez, John Garamendi, Dun
can Hunter, Susan Davis and
Buck McKeon.

The right to attend classes and
participate in on-campus activities,
regardless of one's race, class, sexu
ality, or gender identity, is enshrined
in Stanford's nondiscrimination
policy. Yet, ROTC's return would
not result in the abridgement of any
of these rights on campus; any Stan
ford student, even those who are
transgender, would be welcome to
participate in ROTC classes and
physical training.

Yes, ROTC opponents argue,
but so what if transgender stu
dents can participate in classes or
training? Transgender students
still wouldn't be allowed to com
mission as officers after gradua
tion. Even if ROTC doesn't tech
nically violate Stanford's discrim
ination policy because it only dis
criminates against students after

But even if symbolic punish
ment of the military is misguided,
isn't voting to reject or abstain on
the ROTC ballot measure the
safest course of action? The an
swer is a clear no. In fact, voting
"no" or "abstain" does a very real
disservice to all parties, and not
just for those in uniform.

While keeping ROTC off cam
pus certainly creates significant
headaches for Stanford cadets,
forcing them to travel to other
universities —an inconvenience
that may also deter some ROTC
cadets from accepting admission
at Stanford the real harms are
borne by the rest of us. As the
tenor of this debate has demon
strated, there is a widening chasm
between civilians and the military,
especially on the Farm.
This civilian-military divide
carries very real consequences for
the health of our democracy. As a
nation, we are increasingly send
ing our poorest to fight our wars.
In the absence of a draft, the
wealthy may opt for military serv
ice, but the poor often have few
other options. Some scholars have
argued that this inequitable bur
den on the lower class has re
duced the political costs to fight
ing wars, perhaps explaining why
the United States has become

somewhat of an exception to the
political science theory that dem
ocratic countries are less likely to
go to war. Consider that 180 out of
307 U.S. Army generals have chil
dren in the service, compared to
only 10 out of 535 members of
Congress. That's fewer than the
number of Stanford alumni (11)
currently holding congressional
office.
