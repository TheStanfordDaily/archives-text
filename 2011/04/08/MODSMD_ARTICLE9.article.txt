## EDITORIAL To end war and discrimination, bring back ROTC 
### 
Much has been said about
the current advisory
measure to gauge stu
dent support for ROTC's return
to the Stanford campus. In true
Stanford fashion, many novel and
thoughtful arguments in favor of
supporting, abstaining, or reject
ing ROTC have emerged on email
lists and fliers. However, this
Board wishes to address some
widely believed misperceptions,
and urges a "yes" vote on Mea
sure A.

they have graduated, the overrid
ing concern is to send an impor
tant symbolic message to the mili
tary that Stanford will not tolerate
its presence until it reverses its
discrimination against transgen
der people elsewhere.
Yet, even if we ignore the fact
that Stanford has no leverage
the military could fund two cadets
at UC-Berkeley for the cost of
sponsoring every ROTC cadet at
Stanford, and has been quite
happy to do so any attempt to
punish the military until it accedes
to our demands will fail for the
very simple reason that the mili
tary itself has no control over its
hiring policies.

Opponents of Measure A have
built their advocacy around the
assertion that a vote in favor of
ROTC's return constitutes a dis
enfranchisement of minority
rights. Voting on civil rights, the
argument goes, is wrong; a tyran
ny of the majority should not be
allowed to suppress the freedoms
of the few.

The military's policy of dis
crimination against transgender
citizens is written instead by Con
gress, which reexamines military
policy in its annual defense au
thorizations and appropriations.
Indeed, those who genuinely wish
to change military policy should
direct their attention towards
those who speak for California on
congressional military oversight
committees: Dianne Feinstein,
Jerry Lewis, Ken Calvert, Loretta
Sanchez, John Garamendi, Dun
can Hunter, Susan Davis and
Buck McKeon.

The right to attend classes and
participate in on-campus activities,
regardless of one's race, class, sexu
ality, or gender identity, is enshrined
in Stanford's nondiscrimination
policy. Yet, ROTC's return would
not result in the abridgement of any
of these rights on campus; any Stan
ford student, even those who are
transgender, would be welcome to
participate in ROTC classes and
physical training.

Yes, ROTC opponents argue,
but so what if transgender stu
dents can participate in classes or
training? Transgender students
still wouldn't be allowed to com
mission as officers after gradua
tion. Even if ROTC doesn't tech
nically violate Stanford's discrim
ination policy because it only dis
criminates against students after

But even if symbolic punish
ment of the military is misguided,
isn't voting to reject or abstain on
the ROTC ballot measure the
safest course of action? The an
swer is a clear no. In fact, voting
"no" or "abstain" does a very real
disservice to all parties, and not
just for those in uniform.
