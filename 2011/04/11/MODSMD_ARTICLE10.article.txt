## The 						Card's report card 
### CHRISTINA BROW 
Would you give Stanford an
A+ for academics, a B- for
the campus drug scene and
an A+ for female student
attractiveness?
That's the report card for Stanford accord
ing to College Prowler, a website based on
student rankings that rates universities. The
rating metrics on the site are meant to answer
the questions about a college that admission
officials won't tell you how attractive the
student body is, what the weather is like and
how difficult the curriculum is.
As thousands of prospective college fresh
men agonize over which institution of higher
learning to commit themselves to, more and
more students are turning to websites like
College Prowler to make their decisions. But
are these websites getting it right?
Some students, like Hayden Rodarte 'l3,
see the potential benefit ranking websites like
College Prowler can provide. Rodarte be
lieves that the fact that this website is student
based helps make it more focused on student
and parent concerns.

"College Prowler is useful from a stu
dent's perspective while one is considering
schools," Rodarte said. "It's also helpful for
parents who are clingy and want to know
about the safety and health of schools."
Even though they acknowledge the bene
fits of College Prowler for prospective stu
dents, many of the students highlight the
shortcomings of the website.
"I don't trust the social stuff, because it's
more subjective," Rodarte said. "People are
more likely to disagree about the level of at
tractiveness. I think the grades of guys/girls
are stupid, but everything else is relevant."
Sarah Sullivan 'l3 also questioned the legit
imacy of the girl/guy rankings.
"I think the girl and guy category detracts
from what would have been a site 1 could have
taken seriously," she said.
Some students claim that these grades are so
subjective that truly understanding university
life through these rankings is virtually impossi
ble.
"I think the grade of facilities should be
lower," said Anh Thuy NguyenDang 'l3. "Engi
neering is okay, but the Main Quad is not real
ly that great. The language corner was flooded
last month. Maybe an A-."

Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of freshmen
and undergraduate advising, offered a solu
tion for these somewhat misleading rankings.
"I'm guessing that the people who post are
the very happy and the very unhappy and not
the vast middle," Lythcott-Haims wrote in an
email to The Daily. "I'd like to see a system
that gives you a word cloud evaluating the fre
quency of things said about the institution. It
might be easier to discern the vibe of the place
that way."
The Stanford administration, for one, does
not publicly acknowledge these rankings, or
any other for that matter.
"Stanford does participate in major rank
ings, such as U.S. News and Princeton Re
view by providing standard information ...
but generally, the University does not com
ment on rankings nor [does it] proactively
publicize its rankings," said Lisa Lapin, assis
tant vice president for university communi
cations.
Stanford also limits the importance of rank
ings by encouraging prospective students to not
look solely at these rankings when deciding
which college to attend.
"The position of Stanford University rela
tive to rankings is that there are many factors

that prospective students should consider when
selecting a university that is the best fit for
them, well beyond a number in a ranking that is
determined by often wide-ranging and variable
statistics," Lapin said.
Lythcott-Haims echoed Lapin's criticism of
rankings as away to understand any university,
especially Stanford.
"In the end, doesn't a person have to be here
and see for themselves whether it's the place
for them?" Lythcott-Haims said.
That approach worked for Joseph Victor
'l3, who largely dismissed the rankings.
"I heard enough good things about Stanford
not to give much thought to these rankings."
NguyenDang similarly did not examine
rankings when she made her decision to attend
Stanford.
"I just looked at the major I was interested
in," NguyenDang said. "I chose Stanford be
cause it offered a great chemical engineering
program."
"A better way to become more familiar with
the school is actually speaking in depth with
students of that school," said Vanessa Shiu 'll.
