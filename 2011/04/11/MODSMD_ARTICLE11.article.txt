## THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY Measure A – The Aftermath 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I really hesitated about going
back into politics in my column,
as I'm not usually one to impose
my political beliefs on others. But I
had some major problems with
what went on during elections, par
ticularly with the issues surround
ing ROTC.

I did, to a degree, feel trapped
during elections, trapped between
both sides of the debate concerning
Measure A, the advisory vote on
ROTC. Although I did appreciate
the Campaign to Abstain's attempts
to best represent transgender rights,
I felt that their voice was not my
voice and yet, on the basis that I
am a transgender person, people
both within and outside of the
queer community assumed that I
was for the Campaign to Abstain. I
personally did not support this cam
paign. I think that there should have
been a strong movement that
sought a "no" vote. And what I
found problematic was that it was
assumed what my position was. I
did, to a degree, feel tokenized. I felt
that because of the fact that I was a
minority within a minority, my iden
tity was exploited in order to ac
complish political goals. But I didn't
feel comfortable enough to quite
say anything, because I didn't want
to risk dividing the queer communi
ty. I felt conflicted between my com
munity and my own individual
opinions. These conflicting feelings
stripped me of my agency, and I felt
trapped and ostracized from the
very community that, ironically, did
what it did in order to protect my
rights. And as much as I appreciate
my queer siblings, I did not feel like
I had a voice within that movement.
I didn't feel like I was allowed to
have a voice. Perhaps this is a sign
that the queer community does
need to work on how it treats its
own minorities. Dear Stanford
queer community, I love you to
death, but I was hurt by what hap
pened, and I think I need some time
to myself before I can be part of you
again.

I also felt trapped by the many
debates that occurred surrounding
ROTC. There is a difference be
tween having a respectful discus
sion about an issue and throwing
around borderline hate speech.
Saying that transgender people
"don't matter as much as other peo
ple" demeans me as a human. I felt
personally hurt by a lot of debates
that raged both within and outside
of my dorm about ROTC. In the
end, the debates that occurred were
less about ROTC and more about
transgender people, and if transgen
der people were important enough
to matter just on a human level, on
whether a minority is worth pro
tecting. One of the points I heard
was, "Well, there aren't many trans
gender people on campus, so they
don't really matter anyway in the
grand scheme of things."
And to this I respond at this
point, I don't think transgender is
sues are a point for debate. Arguing
about whether I'm a valid Stanford
student or a valid human being is
not a point of debate, either. At this
point, this is an opportunity for edu
cation — to present the profound
idea that hey, maybe we do matter,
and that maybe we are worth pro
tecting, whether we are a minority
of one, 10, or 100. Going all "high
school debate tournament" on
these issues is just insensitive and

disrespectful, and I felt that this as
pect of my identity was exploited
for the debating pleasure of my
peers.

The whole deal surrounding
elections and ROTC, I admit, upset
me. I felt exploited, taken advan
tage of. I did not feel comfortable
about people throwing around the
merit of my humanity and whether
or not I mattered within the Stan
ford community. And I'll be honest
I think I do matter. And yet from
the dinner table and dorm room dis
cussions that stemmed from the
ROTC advisory vote, Stanford stu
dents made me feel otherwise. In
my four years here, I didn't think I
would have to defend not only my
rights as a Stanford student, but my
rights as human being. To have my
own residents and fellow classmates
tell me that I don't matter that
hurt and made me feel unsafe in the
very places I call home.
To tell you the truth? I wish Mea
sure A was never on the ballot. I
wish the ASSU Senate, in their dis
cussions earlier this year, decided
that this issue was not something to
be voted on by the student body.
The debates that stemmed from
Measure A caused me as well as
several of my transgender peers a
lot of emotional distress and per
sonal damage. Causing a minority
emotional turmoil for the sake of
politics is not okay. And Stanford, I
don't think that should happen
again.

sure A? Email Cristopher Bautista at
