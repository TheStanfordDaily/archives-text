# LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
## The 						Stanford Daily Commenting Policy 
### 
Dear Readers,
The Stanford Daily takes great
pride in creating and maintaining
an active dialogue within the Uni
versity community. We encourage
our readers to voice their ideas
and opinions in a respectful, con
structive manner that allows all
who wish to participate a chance to
do so without feeling threatened.
There has been an unfortunate
trend in recent weeks on our web
site of libelous, aggressive and dis
respectful comments toward
members of the Stanford commu
nity, who need not be subjected to
malicious and inaccurate state
ments when reading or comment
ing on our pages. Our previous
system came with a lack of com
menter accountability by allowing
readers the opportunity to remain
anonymous. We believe this privi

lege has been violated.
With our new system, you will
be asked to simply log in via Face
book. We hope this simple step will
create the environment that we
strive to provide on our pages and
help curb the irresponsibility
demonstrated by a very small frac
tion of our readership. An unin
tended consequence of the new
system is that all preexisting com
ments will be hidden, though not
deleted. A more detailed com
menting policy can be found under
the 'About' tab on our homepage
at www.stanforddaily.com.
We are tremendously excited
to see a spike in our reader-to
reader interaction and we look
forward to continuing to improve
your Daily experience. Thank you
for your continued support.

Sincerely,
ZACH ZIMMERMAN
President and editor in chief,
Vol. CCXXXIX
