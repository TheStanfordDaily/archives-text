# No FREE LUNCH
## Something that Actually Needs Saving 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
At this point, we're as tired of the ASSU election
process as anyone, but with the results in, we
thought it important to point out an unfortunate
result due to a ridiculous technicality. Thanks to exactly
90 grad students, FLiCKS lost it's special fees for the
coming year.
According to the ASSU Constitution, groups that
serve the entire student population i.e. FLiCKS
can elect to apply for special fees from the entire stu
dent population: undergraduate, graduate and co-term.
If this is the case, they must be approved by a minimum
of 15 percent of the student population as a whole.
There is a little-known additional requirement too: they
must gain the majority of each individual student pop
ulation. And even though a group applies for a certain
amount of funds from each population, if they don't get
a majority in either election, they don't get any money
at all.
This means that if 100 grad students vote in the
ASSU general election, 51 of them, or in the case of
FLiCKS, 90 of them can override the entire undergrad
uate student body, dictating not only their own funds,
but ours (i.e. the undergraduates) as well. FLiCKS re
ceived more undergraduate yes votes 2310 and
was approved by a higher percentage of the undergrad
uate student population 33.68 percent than all
but eight other organizations seeking exclusively un
dergraduate fees. Just for a quick point of reference,
there were 46 groups seeking exclusively undergradu
ate special fees and all but two The Chappy and The
Claw received approval. So it is obvious that we as
an undergraduate student body want FLiCKS to re
main a part of the Stanford experience and want it
funded. It is one of those distinctively Stanford experi
ences, something that is talked about on tours and dur
ing Admit Weekend.
So there are a couple takeaways from this. The first
is that there are 90 graduate students who are miserly

troglodytes who aren't willing to pay eight bucks a year
for weekly free movies. Moving on.
More actionable is the ridiculous policy that one
population can dictate the other's funding decision.
FLiCKS made the decision, justifiably, that because
they are used by both student populations that they
should receive funding from both. So grad students dis
agree. Why does that mean anything for undergraduate
special fees? Is there any reason for that at all? It sim
ply seems absurd. This loophole is one that should im
mediately and completely plugged for the next cycle.
But how could FLiCKS be saved for the next year?
The simple answer is that within the existing struc
ture of the ASSU, it probably can't be. But that should
n't actually be a problem. The ASSU constitution is not
divinely inspired. We don't have to stand by the conse
quences of a decision that 90 grad students were al
lowed to make because of rules designed by previous
Stanford students we need to recognize that the stu
dent government is there to serve us, and when it fails to
achieve that goal, it is the government that should give,
not our wellbeing. Yes, very Bth-grade civics class, we
know, but true nonetheless. If the new student govern
ment wants to really do something productive (after, or
course, they save the environment, cure cancer and
eliminate racism) they should get FLiCKS the under
graduate student funding that we determined they
should receive. Do it by referendum if you must, but it
should definitely be done. And whenever special fees
reform inevitably comes up for the next ASSU senate,
keep this from happening again.
