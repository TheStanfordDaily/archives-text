### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kabir Sawhney 
A text message was sent to the student body on Sat
urday night after an attempted sexual assault in Escon
dido Village. According to Stanford police, the assault
happened around 9:30 p.m. at a low-rise unit on Corn
stock Circle.

The suspect, who is still at large, gained entry to the
apartment and entered the bedroom of the woman, who
was sleeping. When she awoke, saw the intruder and
screamed, he fled the scene. Police reports described the
suspect as dark-skinned, possibly black, around 30 years
old and roughly 5-foot-6.
Anyone with information relating to the crime is en
couraged to contact the Stanford and Palo Alto police at
650-329-2413.
When Student Housing alerted students via email
about the crime on Sunday afternoon, it inadvertently
publicized a mailing listserv that all students were sub
scribed to and any individual could post to. A string of
approximately 200 emails from students ensued, with
emails being sent in extremely quick succession.
One of the more memorable emails was one sent by
Sam D'Amico 'l2, who sent a message with "HOW TO
UNSUBSCRIBE" as the subject line, telling students to
send "unsubscribe-list-this with no subject line" to get
themselves off the list. A large number of students re
sponded to D'Amico's suggestion, prompting even
more e-mails to the list.
Other popular notes included pictures and links to
videos on You Tube videos. The list was shut down after
being open for about an hour.
