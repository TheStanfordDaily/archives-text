## SPRING SHOWCASE New coach Shaw puts highly touted team on display 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford football team fin
ished its final spring practice last
Saturday with the annual Cardinal
and White spring game, held at
Kezar Stadium in San Francisco
for the second straight year. In a
fully live game with 12-minute
quarters, the Cardinal team
cruised to an easy victory over the
White team, 42-3.

New head coach David Shaw
abandoned the format of past
spring games, where two designat
ed captains picked teams from the
roster. Instead, the Cardinal team
was comprised mainly of the
team's starters while the White
team was made up mostly of back
ups. Shaw said that the reason he
went with the more traditional
format was to ensure that the
starting units gained cohesion, as
the Cardinal is replacing a num
ber of starters this season. Playing
the full starting units together
also allowed the coaching staff to
make further evaluations in bat
tles for playing time that are still
ongoing.
Of particular interest was the
contest on the offensive line,
where Stanford is replacing three
starters from a standout unit.
"Those competitions are still
ongoing, at center and right tack
le in particular. We wanted both
guys to play with [the first] unit,"
Shaw said. "We'll check the film

out and see how it went."
The game started with current
redshirt sophomore Andrew
Luck showing off why he will be
the top candidate to win the Heis
man Trophy next season. The

quarterback marched the Cardi
nal offense down the field every
time he touched the ball, scoring
four touchdowns on the four pos
sessions he played (three in the
first half and the opening drive in

the second). Luck has not shown
any drop-off from his game last
season, and the Card figures to
challenge for the Pac-12 North
title with him at the helm.
As he did last season. Luck
spread the ball around to a vari
ety of targets during the game,
but went most often to his tight
ends, especially Zach Ertz. The
redshirt freshman caught three
touchdown passes from Luck and
indicated that he will be a strong
factor for Stanford next year.
As the game wore on, Shaw ro
tated in numerous players, to the
point where almost every mem
ber of the Cardinal got some
playing time. Every quarterback
on the roster saw action, led by
redshirt freshmen Robbie Pica
zo and Josh Nunes. Picazo was
the starter for the White team,
while Nunes came on in relief of
Luck after he was removed from
the game.
The backups of the White
team struggled for most of the
day, scoring only once on a field
goal by redshirt freshman kicker
Eric Whitaker. Though Picazo
had a pretty good day at quarter
back, running back Ricky Seale, a
freshman that redshirted last
season, repeatedly gashed the
Cardinal front seven and tore off
for numerous big gains. Seale was
a rare bright spot for a side that
otherwise served as little more
than a scout team for Stanford's
starters to test themselves.

The game counted as the final
of 15 spring practices that the
NCAA allows. Stanford will now
take a few months off from for
mally organized team activities
before returning in June for sum
mer practice. The highly ranked
2011 recruiting class, led by line
backer James Vaughters, will join
the team in June.
