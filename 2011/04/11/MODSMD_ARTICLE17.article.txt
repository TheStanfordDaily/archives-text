# TROJANS TAKE TWO OF THREE
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford baseball had a disap
pointing second series in conference
play in Los Angeles last weekend,
dropping two out of three contests to
its in-state rivals, the USCTrojans.

No. 11 Stanford moves to 15-9
overall and 3-3 in Pac-10 play after
the disappointing series loss to the
Trojans (13-19, 4-5 Pac-10). Though
the Cardinal secured its first Friday
victory since the season-opener at
Rice on Feb. 18, the squad only put up
three runs over the final two games of
the series and didn't overcome early
deficits.
The fortunes of all three Stanford
starters were reversed in the series, as
Mark Appel's losing record im
proved while Jordan Pries and Dean
McArdle could not uphold their im
pressive first-half marks.
Appel came into the series with

lackluster success on paper, yet he
was hardly to blame for his 1-3
record. The sophomore righthander
had just seven runs of combined sup
port in his three losses.
But Appel made sure the line was
different against the Trojans, taking a
no-hitter into the seventh and pitch
ing his first career complete game in
an 8-1 win.
Eight different Stanford batters
backed Appel by getting on base,
totaling 17 base knocks the fifth
time in six games that the Cardinal
had come up with more than 10
hits. Leftfielder Tyler Gaffney
reached base five times, posting
three hits along with first baseman
Brian Ragira.
USC's only run came on an error
by center fielder Jake Stewart, as
Appel improved to 2-3 on the year
and maintained his solid 3.09 ERA.
Trojan starter Andrew Triggs also
came out strong, but Stanford's four
run fifth was more than enough in the
series opener.
But the tables were turned the fol
lowing night at least on the
mound. USC relied on shutdown
pitching from starter Austin Wood
(2-5), who went eight innings and al
lowed no earned runs in the win.The
Cardinal's only tally came off a fifth
inning error, as only four Stanford

nine plate appearances in the first two games of the weekend. Gaffney

players got hits, and sophomore
Kenny Diekroeger's impressive 16-
game hitting streak came to a close.
Pries (4-2) pitched relatively well
for Stanford, but two wild pitches in
the third and fourth frames led to a
two-run deficit which Stanford never
surmounted in the 3-1 loss.
One of the few offensive bright
spots for the Cardinal was Gaffney,
who had two hits and drew both a
walk and a hit-by-pitch for the sec
ond consecutive night. Gaffney was
never retired in the first two games
of the series.
But he couldn't get on base in his

first and only at-bat on Sunday before
an injury forced him to leave the
game. Without his hot hitting in the
middle of the lineup, Stanford strand
ed 12 runners on base and could only
score twice. Five Cardinal hitters
struck out twice each, including the
three Stanford batters with the most
hits on the season: Diekroeger, Stew
art and senior Ben Clowe.
USC chased McArdle (4-1) from
the game early, in one of his least im
pressive outings on the year, giving
up four runs in two innings en route to
his first loss of the season.
This was the righthander's second
struggle in recent starting appear
ances; he gave up four runs in just 0.2
innings two weeks ago against Long
Beach State, though the Cardinal
would eventually come back to win
that game.

The same couldn't be said against
the Trojans, however. Stanford got
two runs back in the eighth off a Zach
Jones single, but Clowe's second
strikeout left the bases loaded, and
the game ended 6-2. The loss marked
the second straight matchup in which
Stanford only scored in a single
frame.
Clutch hitting was dismal in the
series, as 28 Cardinal batters struck
out and 26 more were left on base.
Stanford will try to get back into
the win column this Tuesday against
Pacific, hosting the Tigers at 5:30 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond. The Cardinal is
6-0 in midweek matchups this season
and have lost only once in nine home
games.
