### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford baseball had a disap
pointing second series in conference
play in Los Angeles last weekend,
dropping two out of three contests to
its in-state rivals, the USCTrojans.

No. 11 Stanford moves to 15-9
overall and 3-3 in Pac-10 play after
the disappointing series loss to the
Trojans (13-19, 4-5 Pac-10). Though
the Cardinal secured its first Friday
victory since the season-opener at
Rice on Feb. 18, the squad only put up
three runs over the final two games of
the series and didn't overcome early
deficits.
The fortunes of all three Stanford
starters were reversed in the series, as
Mark Appel's losing record im
proved while Jordan Pries and Dean
McArdle could not uphold their im
pressive first-half marks.
Appel came into the series with

lackluster success on paper, yet he
was hardly to blame for his 1-3
record. The sophomore righthander
had just seven runs of combined sup
port in his three losses.
But Appel made sure the line was
different against the Trojans, taking a
no-hitter into the seventh and pitch
ing his first career complete game in
an 8-1 win.
Eight different Stanford batters
backed Appel by getting on base,
totaling 17 base knocks the fifth
time in six games that the Cardinal
had come up with more than 10
hits. Leftfielder Tyler Gaffney
reached base five times, posting
three hits along with first baseman
Brian Ragira.
USC's only run came on an error
by center fielder Jake Stewart, as
Appel improved to 2-3 on the year
and maintained his solid 3.09 ERA.
Trojan starter Andrew Triggs also
came out strong, but Stanford's four
run fifth was more than enough in the
series opener.
But the tables were turned the fol
lowing night at least on the
mound. USC relied on shutdown
pitching from starter Austin Wood
(2-5), who went eight innings and al
lowed no earned runs in the win.The
Cardinal's only tally came off a fifth
inning error, as only four Stanford
