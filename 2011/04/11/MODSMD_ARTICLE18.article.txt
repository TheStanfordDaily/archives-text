### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
In one of its final Pac-10
matches, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team used
its depth to defeat a competitive
Washington squad and send its
three outstanding seniors out
with one last regular-season,
home-match win. The Cardinal
(21-0,7-0 Pac-10) moved past the
Huskies (12-10, 2-6) easily, win
ing 5-2.

The day before, the Cardinal
defeated No. 71 Fresno State (6-11,
3-0 WAC), 7-0, for its 11th shutout
of the year. Stanford is on a 40-
match winning streak dating back
to February of last year. The team
created momentum early by win
ning the doubles point and then
proceeded to breeze through the
singles as highlighted by Nicole
Gibbs' 6-0, 6-0 win over Bianca
Modoc. Gibbs is now ranked 12th
in the nation. Only Kristie Ahn had
a tough match, eventually winning
4-6,7-6(6), 1-0(3).

"Overall the team did really
well," Ahn said. "Conditions were
pretty tough, because it was really
windy. For me, I was hurting a little
bit but played well and eventually
got the win."
Saturday was Senior Day for
the three graduating seniors: Hi
lary Barte, Carolyn McVeigh and
Jennifer Yen. The trio will graduate
as NCAA champions and as lead
ers of one of the most dominant
Stanford teams in recent memory.
"The day was emotional for me
especially," Barte said. "I started
crying a little bit... actually a lot.
The day just had a different air
about it. I felt so content.To be able
