## Star seniors finish home season strong 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
In one of its final Pac-10
matches, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team used
its depth to defeat a competitive
Washington squad and send its
three outstanding seniors out
with one last regular-season,
home-match win. The Cardinal
(21-0,7-0 Pac-10) moved past the
Huskies (12-10, 2-6) easily, win
ing 5-2.

The day before, the Cardinal
defeated No. 71 Fresno State (6-11,
3-0 WAC), 7-0, for its 11th shutout
of the year. Stanford is on a 40-
match winning streak dating back
to February of last year. The team
created momentum early by win
ning the doubles point and then
proceeded to breeze through the
singles as highlighted by Nicole
Gibbs' 6-0, 6-0 win over Bianca
Modoc. Gibbs is now ranked 12th
in the nation. Only Kristie Ahn had
a tough match, eventually winning
4-6,7-6(6), 1-0(3).

"Overall the team did really
well," Ahn said. "Conditions were
pretty tough, because it was really
windy. For me, I was hurting a little
bit but played well and eventually
got the win."
Saturday was Senior Day for
the three graduating seniors: Hi
lary Barte, Carolyn McVeigh and
Jennifer Yen. The trio will graduate
as NCAA champions and as lead
ers of one of the most dominant
Stanford teams in recent memory.
"The day was emotional for me
especially," Barte said. "I started
crying a little bit... actually a lot.
The day just had a different air
about it. I felt so content.To be able

to reflect on my four years at Stan
ford and have my team there, my
parents there, it meant a lot. It was a
great experience."
A battle took place at the No. 1
spot between Barte and Denise Dy,
the sth-ranked player in the country.
Barte took Dy to two tiebreakers,
losing 7-6(6), 7-6(6). The match
hinged on only a few points, with
missed opportunities on both sides
to take the lead and keep it.
"The most frustrating part for me
was that there were moments in both
sets when I could have pulled away
and blown the match open, and I
wasn't able to convert," Barte said.
"Those were big momentum shifts."
"In the first set, I was serving up 3-
1,3-0 and lost that game," Barte con
tinued. "She kind of flipped the mo
mentum on that one. Tliat's not to
say I didn't have my chances towards
the end of the set, but it was obvious
ly really frustrating. I think I was up
6-4 in the first tiebreaker. In the sec
ond, I think I was up 6-6. Just a few
points here and there. As heart
breaking as it was, I feel happy about
it. I'm excited to just keep learning
and take lessons from it and just be
better. I think it's going to be a big
lesson for me."
This was only one of two matches

dropped on the day. Sophomore Mal
lory Burdette, playing at the No. 2
spot, lost to Venise Chan, ranked 20th
in the nation, 6-7(5), 6-4,1-0(8). Bur
dette looked to be struggling early on
during her match Friday as well, al
though she eventually broke through
to dominate that match 6-3,6-2.
By Washington's standards, it was
an impressive day. Its two best play
ers recorded wins over top-25 play
ers on the road and capped off a 20-1
regular season record between the
two of them. Washington as a team
only ended up 12-10, but eight of
those losses came against top-20
teams. They also finished 2-6 in Pac
-10 play, struggling in one of the most
competitive leagues in the nation.
For Stanford, beating this squad
was a promising sign that the team
has returned to form for the postsea
son. The Cardinal has shown it can
beat tough opponents so far this sea
son even when losing a match or two.
"I wasn't here last year, but I
heard [the Fluskies] were a pretty
tough match," Ahn said. "They have
Denise and Venise, who are really
good players. We still sent the mes
sage that even though our top two
players lost, teams have to do a lot to
beat us."
The Cardinal returns to action
this upcoming weekend, including its
last regular season match at Cal on
April 16 at noon.

her singles and doubles matches as the Cardinal cruised to a 5-2 win.
In one of its final Pac-10
matches, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team used
its depth to defeat a competitive
Washington squad and send its
three outstanding seniors out
with one last regular-season,
home-match win. The Cardinal
(21-0,7-0 Pac-10) moved past the
Huskies (12-10, 2-6) easily, win
ing 5-2.

The day before, the Cardinal
defeated No. 71 Fresno State (6-11,
3-0 WAC), 7-0, for its 11th shutout
of the year. Stanford is on a 40-
match winning streak dating back
to February of last year. The team
created momentum early by win
ning the doubles point and then
proceeded to breeze through the
singles as highlighted by Nicole
Gibbs' 6-0, 6-0 win over Bianca
Modoc. Gibbs is now ranked 12th
in the nation. Only Kristie Ahn had
a tough match, eventually winning
4-6,7-6(6), 1-0(3).

"Overall the team did really
well," Ahn said. "Conditions were
pretty tough, because it was really
windy. For me, I was hurting a little
bit but played well and eventually
got the win."
Saturday was Senior Day for
the three graduating seniors: Hi
lary Barte, Carolyn McVeigh and
Jennifer Yen. The trio will graduate
as NCAA champions and as lead
ers of one of the most dominant
Stanford teams in recent memory.
"The day was emotional for me
especially," Barte said. "I started
crying a little bit... actually a lot.
The day just had a different air
about it. I felt so content.To be able

to reflect on my four years at Stan
ford and have my team there, my
parents there, it meant a lot. It was a
great experience."
A battle took place at the No. 1
spot between Barte and Denise Dy,
the sth-ranked player in the country.
Barte took Dy to two tiebreakers,
losing 7-6(6), 7-6(6). The match
hinged on only a few points, with
missed opportunities on both sides
to take the lead and keep it.
"The most frustrating part for me
was that there were moments in both
sets when I could have pulled away
and blown the match open, and I
wasn't able to convert," Barte said.
"Those were big momentum shifts."
"In the first set, I was serving up 3-
1,3-0 and lost that game," Barte con
tinued. "She kind of flipped the mo
mentum on that one. Tliat's not to
say I didn't have my chances towards
the end of the set, but it was obvious
ly really frustrating. I think I was up
6-4 in the first tiebreaker. In the sec
ond, I think I was up 6-6. Just a few
points here and there. As heart
breaking as it was, I feel happy about
it. I'm excited to just keep learning
and take lessons from it and just be
better. I think it's going to be a big
lesson for me."
This was only one of two matches

dropped on the day. Sophomore Mal
lory Burdette, playing at the No. 2
spot, lost to Venise Chan, ranked 20th
in the nation, 6-7(5), 6-4,1-0(8). Bur
dette looked to be struggling early on
during her match Friday as well, al
though she eventually broke through
to dominate that match 6-3,6-2.
By Washington's standards, it was
an impressive day. Its two best play
ers recorded wins over top-25 play
ers on the road and capped off a 20-1
regular season record between the
two of them. Washington as a team
only ended up 12-10, but eight of
those losses came against top-20
teams. They also finished 2-6 in Pac
-10 play, struggling in one of the most
competitive leagues in the nation.
For Stanford, beating this squad
was a promising sign that the team
has returned to form for the postsea
son. The Cardinal has shown it can
beat tough opponents so far this sea
son even when losing a match or two.
"I wasn't here last year, but I
heard [the Fluskies] were a pretty
tough match," Ahn said. "They have
Denise and Venise, who are really
good players. We still sent the mes
sage that even though our top two
players lost, teams have to do a lot to
beat us."
The Cardinal returns to action
this upcoming weekend, including its
last regular season match at Cal on
April 16 at noon.
