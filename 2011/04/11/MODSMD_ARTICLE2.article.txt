## ASSU election has highest undergrad turnout on record 
### ELLEN HUET AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
Current ASSU Vice President Michael
Cruz 'l2 and Senator Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3 have been elected as next year's
ASSU Executives, defeating Tenzin Seldon
'l2 and Joe Vasquez 'll.
According to ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Stephen Trusheim 'l3, this year's
elections saw "the highest turnout for un
dergraduates since recorded history." More
than "60 percent of the undergraduate pop
ulation voted in this year's elections," he
said.
"We're very excited to serve Stanford
and build on our work," Cruz said of his re
cent victory.
For the time being, Cruz and Macgregor-
Dennis are gearing up for the transition
process. They have begun a dialogue with
current ASSU President Angelina Cardona
'll and current Chief of Staff John Haskell
'l2 about this process.
"In the next few days, we'll be releasing
applications for our chief of staff position
and with that also our formal agenda," Cruz
said.
Twelve out of the 15 students elected to
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate were en
dorsed by the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), led by Dan Ashton 'l4, who won
the most number of votes in the senate elec
tion and Rafael Vazquez 'l2, the only in
cumbent senator to seek reelection.
Cruz & Macgregor-Dennis also received a
SOCC endorsement.
The formal turnover for Executive is cur

rently set for Friday, April 22. The Senate is
slated to transition Tuesday, April 26.
In the results for advisory measure A, which
surveyed students about support for the re
turn of ROTC to Stanford, option A ("I sup
port the return . . . ") received 2,406 votes
the most votes of the three options. Op
tion C ("I choose to abstain") received
2,117 votes, and option B ("I oppose the re
turn ... ") received 929 votes. Tlie measure
does not have any official influence on the
Faculty Senate committee's decision about
ROTC's return to campus, which will be an-

"We are very excited to serve Stanford
and build on our work."

nounced later in spring.
"I can't speak for the ad hoc
committee, but I would hope that
they view this as an indicator that
there is significant support on cam
pus . . . that there's a place for
ROTC on this campus," said Warn
er Sallman 'll, who was an organ
izer for the "yes on A" campaign.
Sallman added that he admired
the efforts put forth by the absten
tion campaign, whose strategy was
to urge students not to vote
against the measure but rather to
select the "I choose to abstain"
option when voting.
All undergraduate-only special
fees groups passed, with the ex

ception of the Stanford Chaparral
and The Claw Magazine, which re
ceived 48.48 percent and 49.56
percent approval, respectively.
Groups needed at least 50 percent
to pass.
Sunday FLiCKS was the only
group that failed to pass joint spe
cial fees, as 73.71 percent of under
graduate voters approved the fees
but only 42.14 percent of graduate
voters approved the fees.
Approval of special fees for the
Stanford Flipside means that stu
dents approved the publication's
allotted budget for a Segway,
which Flipside president Jeremy
Keeshin 'l2 said would help with
the publication's distribution and
advertising.
According to Keeshin, the ob
jective of the Flipside's request
was to impart "a funny message of
the special fees process." He said

the publication's special fees ap
proval "probably means that peo
ple are voting for verbs that they
know, [and] groups that they've
seen around or like."

Low graduate student turnout
(around 28 percent) made the
overall student turnout drop

about 6 percent. This trend was
also evident in the elections to the
Graduate Student Council, where
six of the 10 district candidate
winners were write-in candidates,
some winning with as few as two
or three write-in votes.
Current freshmen elected "The

Quad," current sophomores elect
ed "Leland Stanford Juniors" and
current juniors elected "Senior
Citizens" as class presidents.
