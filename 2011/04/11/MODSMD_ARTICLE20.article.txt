# A
						look at football's turnover

### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
One of the little secrets ob
scured by a returning
Heisman finalist and a
presumptive preseason
top-10 ranking is that the
turnover within the Stanford football
program has been tremendous. Half of
last year's starters will not return. It
makes for an exciting if not uncertain

Shaw and offensive coordinator Pep
Hamilton give the edge to Nunes, but it's

Meinken and Lee Ward
Cue the obligatory statement about
no one being able to replace Marecic.
Hewitt has emerged as one of the more
essential talents on the Cardinal team

"versatility" is the term generally
used to describe him, and with good
reason. A tight-end recruit, he has de
