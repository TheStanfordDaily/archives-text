# A 						look at football's turnover
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
One of the little secrets ob
scured by a returning
Heisman finalist and a
presumptive preseason
top-10 ranking is that the
turnover within the Stanford football
program has been tremendous. Half of
last year's starters will not return. It
makes for an exciting if not uncertain
off-season: Stanford has been stockpil
ing young talent, but many of those
players lack significant (if any) game
experience. The culmination of spring
ball with Saturday's "game" at Kezar
allows a chance to evaluate the current
state of the position battles.
Shall we?

Back-up Quarterback
Replacing:Alex Loukas
Candidates: Robbie Picazo and Josh
Nunes
What was once a completely open
competition has become a two-man
race. Brett Nottingham still needs more
conditioning, and Darren Daniel ap
pears to have made a full transition to
wide receiver. David Olson isn't in the
picture. Picazo and Nunes, both redshirt
freshmen, have divergent tales: Picazo
was a walk-on, while Nunes was a four
star recruit. Both head coach David
Shaw and offensive coordinator Pep
Hamilton give the edge to Nunes, but it's
close, and Picazo shined brightly in the
final open practice and the spring game.
The knock on Picazo has long been his
arm strength, but he was rifling passes
across the field on Saturday.
Verdict: To Be Decided
Fullback
Replacing: Owen Marecic
Candidates: Ryan Hewitt, Geoff
Meinken and Lee Ward
Cue the obligatory statement about
no one being able to replace Marecic.
Hewitt has emerged as one of the more
essential talents on the Cardinal team

"versatility" is the term generally
used to describe him, and with good
reason. A tight-end recruit, he has de

veloped his lead blocking while
demonstrating an ability to catch
passes both out of the backfield and
split wide. He's even taken a few
hand-offs, and is the leader in the
clubhouse. Meinken, a recruited de
fensive end, is a bit more of a bull
than Hewitt and is also developing
his pass-catching abilities. Ward ap
pears to be the most traditional full
back of the bunch, but Hewitt and
Meinken make snaps hard to come
by.
Verdict: Hewitt will have top billing,
but all should get chances.
Wide Receiver
Replacing: Doug Baldwin and Ryan
Whalen
Candidates: Jamal-Rashad Patter
son, GriffWhalen, David Terrell and
Darren Daniel
Baldwin and Ryan Whalen start
ed the entirety of last season, but
Baldwin was largely in that position
because of Chris Owusu's chronic
injuries; when Owusu is healthy, as
he should be for the fall, he is a
starter. GriffWhalen (no relation) is
the most ideal No. 2 WR on the ros
ter, and Patterson, a hyped recruit
who has taken a few years to master
the system, has come on strong in
the absence of Owusu during spring
practices, demonstrating dynamic
ability. Daniel is still in the process
of transitioning, but he has the
height and running savvy coaches
salivate over. Terrell has playmaker
ability.
Verdict: Those should be the top five
WRs come fall, with Owusu and
Whalen starting and Patterson in the
No. 3 role. Daniel's progression is a
must-watch.

Right Tackle
Replacing: Derek Hall
Candidates: Tyler Mabry, Cameron
Fleming and David Yankey
Mabry is the elder statesman of
the group and has been spending
most of his time with the first team,
but the other contenders have got
ten reps there, too, and Fleming has
the ideal tackle's frame, while
Yankey played as a true freshman.
This is far too close to call and much
like the right-tackle battle last sea

son, will go into summer camp.
Verdict: To Be Decided
Left Guard
Replacing: Andrew Phillips
Candidates: Kevin Danser
Game over. Barring injury,
Danser will be the starter.
Verdict: Danser
Center
Replacing: Chase Beeler
Candidates: Khalil Wilkes and Sam
Schwartzstein
Schwartzstein appears to have
taken a bit of a lead, but it's by no
means a done deal. Wilkes switched
jerseys at halftime to play with the
first team during the spring game.
This could still swing either way.
Verdict: To Be Decided
Defensive End
Replacing: Brian Bulcke
Candidates: Ben Gardner
See: Left Guard.
Verdict: Gardner
Nose Tackle
Replacing: Sione Fua
Candidates: Terrence Stephens,
David Parry and Henry Anderson
Stephens entered spring ball as
the leader, but both Parry and An
derson showed enough during the
practice sessions to make it con
tentious, and during the final open
practice, reps were split pretty even
ly. But Stephens took almost all of
the first team snaps during the
spring game and is the only player
on scholarship who fits the profile of
a true nose tackle.
Verdict: Stephens should win the job,
with Anderson seeing time at both
tackle and end.
Outside Linebacker
Replacing: Tom Keiser
Candidates: Alex Debniak, Trent
Murphy and Blake Lueders
At the beginning of spring prac
tice, Shaw expressed a desire for
Lueders to win a starting role, but he
spent most of his time running with
the second team. Both Debniak and
Murphy have spent time with the
first team but have battled injuries
throughout their early careers. Deb
niak is a more prototypical line
backer, while Murphy is a gigantic
specimen who would project to a 4-
3 DE; both have played with their
hands on the ground. With Chase
Thomas sitting out the spring game,

Murphy and Debniak each got ex
tended playing time, but as it stands,
Debniak appears to have a slight
upper hand. Incoming freshman
James Vaughters may get a look,
too, but the climb is steep.
Verdict: To Be Decided
Inside Linebacker
Replacing: Owen Marecic
Candidates: Max Bergen, Jarek Lan
caster andAJ Tarpley
Bergen led the Cardinal in tack
ling for a short time last season as
the starter in Shayne Skov's brief
absence. Lancaster has been a spe
cial teams maven for Stanford, and
Tarpley was one of the Cardinal's
top performers during the spring
game the true freshman demon
strated a nose for the ball and an
ability to cover a significant amount
of ground. Vaughters, a top recruit,
will be in consideration here in addi
tion to the outside.
Verdict: It's Bergen's spot to lose, but
not entirely determined.
Cornerback
Replacing: Richard Sherman
Candidates: Barry Browning
Browning started three games as
a true freshman and has won Shaw's
praise for his continued progression
throughout spring practice. There's
little to say that he'll be supplanted.
One wrinkle: Usua Amanam, the
converted running back, has been
beating the learning curve and, with
his athleticism, has a tremendous
ceiling. It's not likely that he'll win a
starting gig, but he'll be a factor.
Verdict: Browning
Kicker
Replacing: Nate Whitaker
Candidates: Jordan Williamson and
Eric Whitaker
Williamson has spent more time
with the first team, but Shaw has not
named a starter, and Whitaker hit
the only field goal attempt of the
spring game and has a slight experi
ence edge.
Verdict: To Be Decided
