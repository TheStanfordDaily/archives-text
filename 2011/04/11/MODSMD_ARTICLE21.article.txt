## Card wins two to end final road trip of season 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
overcame a crazy weekend of travel
to defeat Washington and Oregon on
the road.
The No. 9 Cardinal (14-5,4-1 Pac
-10) kicked off its weekend against the
deceptively strong, No. 22 Washing
ton Huskies squad on Friday after
noon.

The Huskies (15-8, 2-3) had al
ready proven they could compete
with the top teams in the country, de
feating fifth-ranked Texas A&M in
February and even hanging with the
undefeated and top-ranked Universi
ty of Virginia. Washington had lost
three straight matches coming into
Friday all against top-15 teams
and the scrappy squad was looking to
get back on the winning trail.
Stanford shot out to an early 2-0
lead against the Huskies thanks to its
continued dominance in doubles and
junior Bradley Klahn's 6-4,6-2 victo
ry over Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan at
the No. 1 spot.
Washington made it interesting
when Kyle McMorrow defeated
Ryan Thacher 6-3, 6-4 to bring the
score to 2-1, but Stanford won the
next two matches to secure the victo
ry. Sophomore Denis Lin provided
the clincher at the No. 4 spot, beating
Daniel Shmidt 6-3,6-4.
Washington won the last two

matches of the contest to make the
final score 4-3, but senior Greg Hirsh
man noted that the match was much
tougher than the early 4-1 lead indi
cates.
"Washington was a tough team at
home," Hirshman said. "They are a
top-25 team, and their courts are very
different from ours. We have very fast
courts while theirs are extremely
slow, and we had to adjust to that. We
barely won the match 4-3, but we are
... very happy we got that.
"Even though I lost and a few
other guys lost, the match shows how
we've been able to diversify where we
get the points we need to get the win,"
Hirshman continued.
Indeed, the Cardinal's current six
game win streak has demonstrated
that diversification. The top of the
lineup carried the team on Friday
against the Huskies, while against
teams like Tulsa, the bottom of the
lineup has been the difference
maker.
Stanford then traveled to Eugene,
Ore., for a Saturday showdown with
the Oregon Ducks (10-10,1-4). The
trip itself turned out to be quite event
ful, according to Hirshman.
"We had a crazy situation where
our flight from Washington to Ore
gon was canceled," he said. "We
ended up driving from midnight until
4:30 a.m. and then got up at 9 to get
ready for our 11:00 a.m. match."
Even on little sleep, the Cardinal
secured a commanding 6-1 victory,
sweeping the doubles point and win
ning the first five singles points of the
match. Hirshman recognized that it
was definitely a match the team ex
pected to win, but that doing so given
its hectic travel situation was mean
ingful.
Overall, the Cardinal escaped
