# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## College Humor's Jake and Amir visit the Farm Comics perform in first event of "April Fools and Drools" series 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
Jake Hurwitz and Amir Blumenfeld, both
writers for the popular Internet humor site Col
lege Humor.com, brought College Humor Live to
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Sunday night, along
with executive editor Streeter Seidell and stand
up comic Anthony Jeselnik.
The Stanford Improvisers (Simps) opened the
performance, the first event of the Stanford
Speakers Bureau's "April Fools and Drools" se
ries, with a few games of "World's Worst."
The Simps were followed by Jake and Amir,
the stars of a Webby award-winning online series
called "Jake and Amir." The series is premised on
the relationship between the awkward Amir and
the "cool" Jake, who fluctuates between being a
regular guy and being desperately obsessed with
appearing cool.
The comedic duo continued their usual act for
this performance, with Amir continually calling
Jake his best friend while Jake insisted the oppo
site. After a few jokes, including Amir calling his
erect penis a great "bagel-holder" and calling
Mark Zuckerberg "Zard Fuckerberg," Amir's act
prompted Jake to incredulously ask, "Do you
even hear what you say?"
Their act was followed by Seidell, a stand-up
comedian in his own right, whose act focused on
the issues of fat people. Recounting the story of
how he gained 60 pounds in college, Seidell told
the audience that the signs you are getting fat in-
elude not being able to breathe
when you try to tie your shoes and
taking drastic measures to ensure a
spot on the bottom during sex.
After Jake and Amir briefly took
the stage again, Jeselnik performed
his stand-up act. Jeselnik's perform
ance, previously featured on Jimmy
Fallon and the Comedy Central
Roast of Donald Trump, was an abra
sive crowd favorite. It featured jokes
about Asian stereotypes, running a
negative campaign in high school
against a girl in a wheelchair, telling a
smelly Eastern-European dormmate
to "get out of my country" and claim
ing people who get offended at jokes

are "fucking stupid." His act was
characterized by a straight-faced
telling of offensive stories, a tact
which the audience loved.
The show concluded with a con
test in which members of the audi
ence who admitted to knowing em
barrassing trivia, such as three Justin
Bieber songs or four characters
from Twilight, were awarded with
free t-shirts and books.
Audience member, Nadia Smati
'l4, said her favorite part was seeing
Jake and Amir. "I've been a fan for a
while," she said. "It was very cool to
see them live."
Many audience members stayed
after the show to meet and take pic
tures with Jake and Amir, as well as
to talk to Seidell.
