## Med school pioneers new embryo donation method 
### JANELLE WOLAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When couples undergo in-vitro fertilization
(IVF), they must decide what to do with the em
bryos left over from the treatment: store them,
throw them out or an increasingly popular op
tion donate them to research. A new proce

dure developed by the School of Medicine en
ables couples to make the decision to donate with
out interacting with the researchers themselves.
"There is concern that conflicts of interest and
influence by researchers and clinicians may play a
role in donor choice," said Christopher Scott, di
rector of Stanford's Program on Stem Cells and
Society. "The Stanford biobank process allows

people time to make the primary decision to do
nate on their own, when it's right for them. It also
allowed us to ask whether donors have prefer
ences as to the type of research they will allow on
their embryos."
