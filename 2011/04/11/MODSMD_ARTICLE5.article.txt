## Med school pioneers new embryo donation method 
### JANELLE WOLAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When couples undergo in-vitro fertilization
(IVF), they must decide what to do with the em
bryos left over from the treatment: store them,
throw them out or an increasingly popular op
tion donate them to research. A new proce

dure developed by the School of Medicine en
ables couples to make the decision to donate with
out interacting with the researchers themselves.
"There is concern that conflicts of interest and
influence by researchers and clinicians may play a
role in donor choice," said Christopher Scott, di
rector of Stanford's Program on Stem Cells and
Society. "The Stanford biobank process allows

people time to make the primary decision to do
nate on their own, when it's right for them. It also
allowed us to ask whether donors have prefer
ences as to the type of research they will allow on
their embryos."
A description and analysis of the new protocol
was unveiled in last Friday's publica
tion of Cell Stem Cell.
By adopting this new donation
process, the Stanford RENEW
Biobank functions as a "middle per
son" between the patient and the re
searcher, said Austin Freeman, re
search manager at the biobank.
Researchers no longer have to so
licit embryo donations using their
own, disparate consent procedures.
Instead, the Stanford biobank
armed with a carefully planned, in
formed consent protocol collects
embryos from patients nationwide
and then distributes these embryos
among stem cell researchers at Stan
ford. This way, the patients' personal
information is protected from the re
searcher.
The donation process was de
ployed in January 2008 at Stanford
and at 39 associated fertility clinics and
three storage facilities in 20 states. Do
nated embryos were then deposited at
Stanford's RENEW Biobank.
The donation protocol described
in Cell Stem Cell is a two-part proce
dure.
Each year, when couples receive a
storage bill from their IVF clinic, they
must decide whether to dispose of
their embryos or to continue storing
them.
Clinics participating in this study
offered couples a third option: to do
nate their embryos to research
through the Stanford biobank. As a
result, patients can make their deci
sions in the privacy of their own
homes, making a knowledgeable and
deliberate choice on their own time.
"Many couples were very relieved
to have the option to donate then' em
bryos for research and to participate
in the field of stem cell research," said
Tasha Kalista, Stanford's previous
biobank research manager and the
study's first author.
If couples chose to go ahead with
their donation, the biobank sent them
an informed consent packet that in
cluded detailed donation instructions,
a health questionnaire and a consent
document.
In the second step of the process.

couples were told to call biobank co
ordinators like Freeman or Kalista,
who were unconnected with the origi
nal IVF clinic or the researchers who
might use their embryos. Couples
were encouraged to ask questions and
express concerns.
Couples could also choose
whether to donate to either human
development or stem cell research.
Human development research focus
es on improving IVF clinical out
comes and maintains the culture of
embryos for no longer than 12 days.
Stem cell research, on the other hand,
produces stem cell lines in order to de
velop therapies to treat disease, disor
ders and injured tissues.
Couples did not discriminate be
tween the two different kinds of re
search. While 32 percent chose to do
nate only to human development re
search, 30 percent preferred stem cell
research. In addition, 38 percent de
cided to donate to both types.
Biobank staff also asked both part
ners whether they wanted to be con
tacted again if research revealed clini
cally relevant health or genetic infor
mation. Around 67 percent of patients
asked to be contacted again.
Under this protocol, 403 couples
donated 1,356 embryos to research.
With an average age of 39 years, peo
ple who decided to donate were pre
dominantly white and of high socio
economic status, Kalista said. She
added that these demographics
might be explained by the fact that
IVF treatment must be paid out-of
pocket.
According to published findings in
Cell Stem Cell, a 2003 survey of 340
U.S. clinics estimated that, of the
400,000 embryos stored, only 11,000
have been designated for research.
"Part of the reason why is that a lot
of states don't allow people to donate
their embryos for research," Freeman
said. "Another issue is that some clin
ics don't offer donation as an option."

Stanford has one of a small num
ber of biobanks in the United States.
The main goal in publishing the con
sent procedure is to encourage other
institutions to establish their own
biobanks and thus make it easier for
IW clinics to make donation a viable
option for couples.
