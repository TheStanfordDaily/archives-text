## BASES hosts Silicon Valley executives E-Bootcamp brings together 100 student entrepreneurs 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
One hundred students, hailing from 26
different universities, arrived on the Farm
on Thursday to attend a four-day entre
preneurship conference called E-Boot
camp, which was organized through a
partnership between student business as
sociations at Stanford and Princeton.
Throughout the conference, students
attended talks from influential Silicon
Valley power players like Google vice
president Marissa Mayer '97 M.S. '99,
TiVo co-founder Jim Barton and Elad Gil,
director of corporate strategy for Twitter.
They also participated in workshops that
walked them through the process of creat
ing a company, from brainstorming to user
testing to fundraising.
On Saturday night, the event culminat
ed with a pitch competition where stu
dents had seven minutes to sell their start
up ideas to venture capitalists. The prize
was two hours with Sequoia Capital, a
venture capital firm that has funded com
panies like Apple, Google, Yahoo, Pay Pal
and Cisco Systems.
According to Ruby Lee 'l3, one of the
conference's co-directors, the goal of the
program is for attendees to "learn how to
turn their start-up idea into a successful
venture," and to meet others who share
their same entrepreneurial mindset.
"Maybe they'll meet their co-founders
at this conference and learn from each
other and not just the speakers and work
shop leaders," she said.
The Business Association for Stanford
Entrepreneurial Students (BASES)
began hosting the event four years ago.
The first conference was much smaller in
scale. It lasted only two days and was lim
ited to Stanford students.
But last year, BASES decided to team
up with Princeton's Business Today (BT),
a student organization that had already
been hosting annual student business con
ferences, to bring the event onto a bigger
platform.
"They wanted something on the
West Coast and then we wanted
more of a national reach," Lee said.
"It was a good match between us."
The program received 283 appli
cations this year for 100 spots; 50
were reserved for Stanford students
and 50 for non-Stanford students.
Applicants had to write a detailed
analysis and description of a start-up
idea that they were working on.
"This year, all the students who
are coming are actually working [on
a] start-up at this moment," Lee said.
"Previously, we were just looking for
students who had the potential to
pursue a start-up.
"I think the conference will be
much more cohesive as a result, be
cause everyone will be working on
developing their idea and getting to
the level where they can present it at
the end of the conference,"
Peter Pelberg, a senior at Emory
University, said he heard about E-
Bootcamp from the president of
Emory's undergraduate business
school, who knew he had been
working on a start-up idea. Pelberg
described the conference as a "non
stop fire hose of knowledge."
"It's really nice because they put
in front of you some success stories
that make it seem as if anybody can
do this," Pelberg said. "When you
come to Silicon Valley, you hear
about all these people who have
built these great companies, and it's
hard to imagine yourself in that po
sition, but this kind of breaks down
the trepidation."
This idea was emphasized in the
opening keynote on Thursday, given
by Roelof Botha MBA 'OO, a partner
at Sequoia Capital. He said the goal
of his talk was "to strip away any in
timidation you might have as you
begin your own entrepreneurial
ventures." He did so by showing
now-and-then pictures of some of

the most successful Silicon Valley
companies.
When asked about whether adult
supervision was needed in pursuit of
a start-up, Botha said youth, rather
than being a detriment, is often an
advantage.
"You have to be naive enough to
start a company and smart enough,
like the people in this room, to beat
the odds and the challenges to be a
success," he said. "The problem is
that when people are adults, they
fear failure and don't have the same
fresh perspective."
The following morning, Barton
addressed many of these themes
when he spoke about co-founding
TiVo with Mike Ramsey. He said
they were driving down Highway
101 when he first said, "You know, I
think we really got something here."
"The problem was we couldn't
get a lot of people to agree with us,"
Barton said.
He told attendees to not be afraid
of big corporations, noting that they
often get so invested in their busi
ness and product development
models that they are not able to eas
ily change course and compete with
start-ups. Start-ups, he noted, can
more quickly adapt to different mar
ket conditions.
"I have no fear of big companies
these days," Barton said. "In fact, I'd
love to compete with them
they're slower."
On Saturday, Mayer spoke about
the need to work with the smartest
people one can find and to take on
things that one is not ready to do.
These two ideas ended up being the
criteria she used when she decided
to work at Google after graduating
from Stanford in 1999.
"Most of the start-ups that I
talked to I gave a .02 percent chance
of succeeding," Mayer said. "I gave
Google about a 2 percent chance,
but I realized I would probably learn
more failing at Google, even if we
did fail, than I would by succeeding
someplace else."

a start-up, Botha said youth, rather
than being a detriment, is often an
advantage.
"You have to be naive enough to
start a company and smart enough,
like the people in this room, to beat
the odds and the challenges to be a
success," he said. "The problem is
that when people are adults, they
fear failure and don't have the same
fresh perspective."
The following morning, Barton
addressed many of these themes
when he spoke about co-founding
TiVo with Mike Ramsey. He said
they were driving down Highway
101 when he first said, "You know, I
think we really got something here."
"The problem was we couldn't
get a lot of people to agree with us,"
Barton said.
He told attendees to not be afraid
of big corporations, noting that they
often get so invested in their busi
ness and product development
models that they are not able to eas
ily change course and compete with
start-ups. Start-ups, he noted, can
more quickly adapt to different mar
ket conditions.
"I have no fear of big companies
these days," Barton said. "In fact, I'd
love to compete with them
they're slower."
On Saturday, Mayer spoke about
the need to work with the smartest
people one can find and to take on
things that one is not ready to do.
These two ideas ended up being the
criteria she used when she decided
to work at Google after graduating
from Stanford in 1999.
"Most of the start-ups that I
talked to I gave a .02 percent chance
of succeeding," Mayer said. "I gave
Google about a 2 percent chance,
but I realized I would probably learn
more failing at Google, even if we
did fail, than I would by succeeding
someplace else."

One hundred students, hailing from 26
different universities, arrived on the Farm
on Thursday to attend a four-day entre
preneurship conference called E-Boot
camp, which was organized through a
partnership between student business as
sociations at Stanford and Princeton.
Throughout the conference, students
attended talks from influential Silicon
Valley power players like Google vice
president Marissa Mayer '97 M.S. '99,
TiVo co-founder Jim Barton and Elad Gil,
director of corporate strategy for Twitter.
They also participated in workshops that
walked them through the process of creat
ing a company, from brainstorming to user
testing to fundraising.
On Saturday night, the event culminat
ed with a pitch competition where stu
dents had seven minutes to sell their start
up ideas to venture capitalists. The prize
was two hours with Sequoia Capital, a
venture capital firm that has funded com
panies like Apple, Google, Yahoo, Pay Pal
and Cisco Systems.
According to Ruby Lee 'l3, one of the
conference's co-directors, the goal of the
program is for attendees to "learn how to
turn their start-up idea into a successful
venture," and to meet others who share
their same entrepreneurial mindset.
"Maybe they'll meet their co-founders
at this conference and learn from each
other and not just the speakers and work
shop leaders," she said.
The Business Association for Stanford
Entrepreneurial Students (BASES)
began hosting the event four years ago.
The first conference was much smaller in
scale. It lasted only two days and was lim
ited to Stanford students.
But last year, BASES decided to team
up with Princeton's Business Today (BT),
a student organization that had already
been hosting annual student business con
ferences, to bring the event onto a bigger
platform.
"They wanted something on the
West Coast and then we wanted
more of a national reach," Lee said.
"It was a good match between us."
The program received 283 appli
cations this year for 100 spots; 50
were reserved for Stanford students
and 50 for non-Stanford students.
Applicants had to write a detailed
analysis and description of a start-up
idea that they were working on.
"This year, all the students who
are coming are actually working [on
a] start-up at this moment," Lee said.
"Previously, we were just looking for
students who had the potential to
pursue a start-up.
"I think the conference will be
much more cohesive as a result, be
cause everyone will be working on
developing their idea and getting to
the level where they can present it at
the end of the conference,"
Peter Pelberg, a senior at Emory
University, said he heard about E-
Bootcamp from the president of
Emory's undergraduate business
school, who knew he had been
working on a start-up idea. Pelberg
described the conference as a "non
stop fire hose of knowledge."
"It's really nice because they put
in front of you some success stories
that make it seem as if anybody can
do this," Pelberg said. "When you
come to Silicon Valley, you hear
about all these people who have
built these great companies, and it's
hard to imagine yourself in that po
sition, but this kind of breaks down
the trepidation."
This idea was emphasized in the
opening keynote on Thursday, given
by Roelof Botha MBA 'OO, a partner
at Sequoia Capital. He said the goal
of his talk was "to strip away any in
timidation you might have as you
begin your own entrepreneurial
ventures." He did so by showing
now-and-then pictures of some of

the most successful Silicon Valley
companies.
When asked about whether adult
supervision was needed in pursuit of
a start-up, Botha said youth, rather
than being a detriment, is often an
advantage.
"You have to be naive enough to
start a company and smart enough,
like the people in this room, to beat
the odds and the challenges to be a
success," he said. "The problem is
