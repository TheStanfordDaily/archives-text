# STUDENT LIFE
## Red Zone attempts to grow beyond football 
### ARIEL ZHOU 
The Red Zone, an organization
established by the Stanford Athlet
ics to engage the Stanford student
body in athletics, is attempting to ex
pand its outreach to Stanford stu
dents.
The name initially referred solely
to the section in the stadium and
eventually evolved to a term encom
passing the group of students that
came to the games. Now, efforts are
being made to expand the definition
even further.
"We want to brand it as more
than just a section within the stadi
um, within Maples," said Marie
Vasquez, the director of marketing
for Stanford Athletics.
The aim is to instill the Red Zone
as a part of one's identity as a sports
fan at Stanford.
"I'd like to get everyone involved
... if you're a Stanford student, then
you're in the Red Zone," said Kevin
Aha, the marketing official in
charge of outreach for the Red
Zone.
"I don't know what it'll take to
get there it's a big challenge obvi
ously," Aha said. "I'd also like to es
tablish the Red Zone shirt and make
it a kind of unofficial uniform. The
players are in their uniforms in the
field and, as a student, I'm in my own
uniform as a fan."
"We want it to be more of a stu

dent fan group of our events,"
Vasquez added. "We're also consid
ering a Red Zone tailgate. We want
to get students out to the game early,
so we want to offer them a place
where they can tailgate and have fun
before the game."
Another idea still in the planning
stages is to establish viewing parties
on a consistent basis.
"We did a couple last year, but
we'd like to do a few more," Aha
said.
He said he wanted to "provide
students with a venue to come to
gether," where they could watch
games, sport their Red Zone shirts
and still feel like they're at the game.
In attempting to get all students
involved and motivate more stu
dents to come to the games, Stan
ford Athletics incentivizes fans
through the Red Zone Loyalty Pro
gram.
"The point system is away to re
ward those who have shown their
support and loyalty," Aha said.
"Hopefully, students go there for
the prize initially, find that they like
it and then come back and happen
to get the prize."
The website for the Red Zone
will be updated in the next few
weeks with a detailed description of
the points program for next season.
