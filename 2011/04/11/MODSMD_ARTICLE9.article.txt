## Stanford nurses approve new contract 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Erin Inman An Le Nguyen 
The Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievement (CRONA)
voted in favor of a new contract with
Stanford Hospital & Clinics (SHC)
and Lucile Packard Children's Hos
pital (LPCH) on Thursday, marking
the end of more than a year of hag
gling and potential strikes.
This contract is set to fully replace
the employee contract imposed on
the nurses last February, which in
cluded the introduction of the Pro
fessional Nurse Development Pro
gram (PNCP).
Though originally a source of ten
sion, recent proposed modifications
to the Professional Nurse Develop

ment Program helped facilitate the
contract's approval. These modifica
tions will enhance the ability of nurs
es with 20 or more years of service to
achieve a higher nurse classification,
wrote SHC spokeswoman Sarah
Staley in an email to The Daily.
The new contract also prohibits
changes to the nurse development
program for the life of the contract
a condition the nursing union was
adamant about including, said
CRONA president Lorie Johnson.
The approved contract includes a
retroactive 4-percent pay increase,
which dates back to March 2010.
Furthermore, wage increases be
tween 2 and 4 percent will be imple
mented April 1,2012 through March
31,2013.
"We believe that these tentative
agreements reflect the high regard
we have for our nursing staff," Staley said, prior to the
CRONAvote.
After the vote's results were announced, Johnson, in
a press release, described the contract negotiations as "a
long and tumultuous process."
"While the contract has many problems, we were able
to make important improvements," she said.
