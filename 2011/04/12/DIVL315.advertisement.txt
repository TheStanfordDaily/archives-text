Language is a medium of communication
among living people, and it is also a
means of communion between the living
and the dead. The most ancient vocation
of poetry—whether lyric or epic—is to
keep open the channels of communication
between the past and the present.
Join Robert Harrison as he discusses how
poetry has traditionally served as such a
medium and how the work of Dylan
Thomas in particular remains true to this
ancient vocation.
