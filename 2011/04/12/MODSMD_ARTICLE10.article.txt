## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Lance Crowley, former vice president of medical af
fairs, died March 30 at the age of 91 after nearly half a
century of service to the Stanford University Medical
Center.
Crowley was born on July 2,1919 in Newark, N.J., and
attended college and medical school at Yale University.
He served his surgical internship and residency at Yale
New Haven Hospital, and, following a stint as a captain in
the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War 11,
served a vascular surgery fellowship at Emory Universi
ty-
He first came to Stanford in 1964, when surgery de
partment chair Robert Chase recruited him to be chief

of surgery at the new Palo Alto Veterans Administra
tion Hospital. He went on to fill other administrative
roles and became the medical school's associate dean
for planning until he left in 1973 to be the dean of the
University of Wisconsin medical school.
When he returned to Stanford in 1977 to be deputy
dean, he worked to solve the school's deep financial and
political problems and became dean two years later.The
next year, then-president Donald Kennedy chose
Crowley to fill the post of vice president.
Under Crowley's leadership, the medical center won
Palo Alto's approval to modernize. This project led to a
four-story expansion of the existing building, which
housed 11 patient care units; a new surgical suit; im
proved pharmacy, clinical lab and radiology services
and more space for materials management.
After he resigned from his vice president post in
1986, Crowley started on what his wife said was his
proudest accomplishment helping create Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital. He became chair of the
children's hospital after the death of Lucile Packard,
who had previously held that position, in 1987. Today,
the hospital is the newest hospital in the top 10 chil
dren's hospitals rated by U.S. News & World Report.
In addition to praise from his colleagues, Crowley
was also honored with several awards, including the
Dean's Medal in 2009, the Certificate of Merit from the
American Cancer Society, a Stanford University Distin
guished Service Award and an endowed professorship
created in his name.
A memorial service for Crowley will be held at 3 p.m.
on April 21 at Memorial Church.
