# Stanford-Berkeley group wins $25 million for solar research
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” An Le Nguyen 
The U.S. Department of Energy's Sun Shot Initiative
recently awarded $25 million to a joint research effort by
Stanford and UC-Berkeley. The team, called the Bay
Area Photovoltaics Consortium (BAPVC), will work to
address technical barriers to the solar power industry
and reduce the cost of solar installations.
BAPVC will fund research and development that
aims to produce cost-effective solar modules in high vol
ume. It will look closely at new materials, device struc
tures and production methods.
BAPVC co-director Yi Cui, an associate professor of
materials science and engineering, was optimistic about
these efforts.
"The future of solar is clearly in cheaper, better per
forming photovoltaics," Cui said to the Stanford News
Service. "The Sun Shot funding and the exciting collabo
rative approach between the universities and national
labs guided by industrial perspectives will advance all
the components of solar modules that will bring down
the dollar-per-watt cost dramatically."
