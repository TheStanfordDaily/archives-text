## EAT, LOOK, ADMIRE COOL CAFE AT CANTOR ARTS CENTER DEBUTS STUDENT ART SPACE 
### ISSRA OMER 
There are not many places where the
works of Rodin, Warhol and under
graduate students come together,
but Stanford's Cantor Arts Center
proves an exception.
While Cantor itself is known for its displays
of great works, what you may not know is that
it is also home to a cafe downstairs that show
cases the art of aspiring Picassos none other
than Stanford students. Debuted in 2000, the
Cool Cafe at the Cantor Arts Center lives up to
its name, taking principles of innovation and
uniqueness beyond its menu.
The Cafe's lively

atmosphere comes
from a combination
of fare, vibe and art.
Students, faculty
and visitors enjoy
conversations over
fresh, organic food
while the waiters
and owner cheerful
ly move about the
cafe serving their
customers. Outside
is a beautiful seating
area, where cus
tomers can chow
down while enjoying

spring quarter sunshine. Three
large paintings hang on a vi
brant red-orange wall inside.
The paintings are the cre
ations of Emma Webster 'll,
who believes that the Cool
Cafe provides the perfect
space for her work.
"When people go to the

CoHo," Webster said, "the atmosphere is 'foot
ball and beer,' rather than a primary focus on
the artwork."
Unlike the CoHo and Wallenberg Hall,
both of which display works of art by students,
the ambience of Cool Cafe allows visitors to
concentrate on the art.
"People come when their senses are open
and they are in a state to fully appreciate art,"
cafe owner Jesse Cool said.
Webster's art begins the new initiative of
displaying student artwork at the cafe. Cool
was inspired to feature student artwork be
cause she believed student pieces would pro
vide a bold dynamism, while retaining a per
sonal atmosphere, both of which are key as
pects of the cafe.
"I wanted it to be bold, contemporary, per
sonal, ever-changing," Cool said. "I want it to
be something to talk about."
Not only does the student art enhance the
cafe experience, it also allows exhibitors to
transition from student artists to professionals.
"Displaying art in the cafe represents a
great leap, since it's so hard to go from the
1 status of a student to a professional," Web
ster said.
r The cafe maintains a supportive relation
' ship not only to the Cantor Arts Center, but
also to up-and-coming artists and art stu
dents.
"To me, this cafe is another way of creating
community and supporting budding artists,
and I think the display will hopefully raise
awareness and support for the arts," Cool said.
Patience Young, museum curator at Cantor,
expressed enthusiasm about Cool Cafe provid
ing a space to showcase student talent.
"The Cantor Arts Center does not allow
student work to be displayed because of com
plicated, long-standing problems dealing with
issues of priority," Young said. "But the cafe
was away to circumvent these rules it's a
win-win situation."
