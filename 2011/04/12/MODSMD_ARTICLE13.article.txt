## I HAVE TWO HEADS Metonymy 
### Rachel Kolb 
To what extent is college
cliquey? In the best of worlds,
I think we'd all like to believe
that it isn't. We'd rather ignore the
strange pull that the group mentali
ty can have over our social lives, in
fluencing us to linger in surface
level conversation and to puzzle
over the dynamics that exist be
tween our different sets of friends. I
know that, from a personal stand
point, I first arrived on campus sigh
ing in relief to be free of the social
hordes that had characterized my
high-school days. I anticipated col
lege as the kind of place that would
enable me to mingle with more dif
ferent types of people, but on my
own terms.
And, indeed, my time at Stan
ford has been that way, but only
after a little bit of maturation. At
Stanford, it is entirely possible to
live independently of social cliques
or group-centered activities, but
doing so can run counter to some of
our inclinations, as well as the col
lective mindset with which we have
been (dare I say it?) indoctrinated.
Look at it this way. When we first
arrive on campus for NSO —or
even Admit Weekend our first
encounters with Stanford as an in
stitution are likely to take place
within a group-oriented frame
work. We gather together in
MemAud, barely knowing any of
the students around us, and plunge
into chants extolling how amazing
our class is. Freshman dorms prac
tice dorm cheers, insisting on their
sense of community before the indi
vidual building blocks of that com
munity have been mortared. On
campus clubs and activities do roll
outs to promote a sense of belong
ing. Before we dig down to the indi
vidual relationships that really mat
ter, our sense of group identity can
seem like everything.
The approach with which Stan
ford integrates new students, I
think, is an example of top-down
processing: in order to meet the
people who are the most like us and
who can have the most impact on
our lives, we must travel through a
group-centric hierarchical frame
work first. The fact that Stanford,
from the beginning, devotes so
much energy to promoting this
sense of community is one of the
positive aspects of being here. With
the resources that we have, it is en
tirely possible for each of us to find
our niche. Flowever, on campus, the
group mentality can persist beyond
freshman year, even if by then it has
more heft behind it than dorm
cheers shouted amongst strangers.
Call it cliques, call it stereotyping,
call it habit but it exists because
we, as human beings, tend to think
about ourselves and other people
categorically.

Even now, three years into my
time as a Stanford undergraduate, I
still tend to perceive my discrete
friends as belonging to one group or
another. For instance, I associate
different dynamics with friends
from my freshman dorm versus
friends I met in class, friends I met
while abroad and friends from my
extracurricular activities. These cat
egories are rather distinct in my
mind, and they don't tend to inter

mingle very much. It's true that the
more time we spend at Stanford, or
any other place, the smaller that
place feels. So when I realize that
two friends from two separate
spheres of my life actually know
each other, that their own spheres
are crisscrossing beyond their inter
actions with me, I feel a little bit
startled. My neatly catalogued ap
proach to visualizing my life has
been fractured.
Notice that I'm not saying that
group morale is bad, just that it can
be counterproductive when it leads
us to interact with people based
only on our categorizations of them.
This is fundamentally what cliques
do: they lend us a convenient way of
thinking about the individuals in
our lives, binding us to familiarity
and failing to press us into more di
verse relationships. What is more,
they also lead us to label ourselves
in unnecessary ways. The fluidity to
resist this mentality, when our cam
pus has been prompting us to think
in terms of our group membership
from day one, is what will bolster
our growth as individuals, even as
we remain vital contributors to a
collective effort.
Individual versus herd, self ver
sus society: none of these issues are
new. No, they didn't vanish after
high school, and from my parents'
accounts of the workplace, I suspect
that we can expect them to continue
for decades yet. But we shouldn't
view them as inevitable, either, be
cause we have more individual con
trol over our social relationships
than we might think. Some of the
most rewarding experiences I have
had at Stanford have resulted from
telling my usual group, "No, not
tonight" and engaging in a conver
sation with someone with whom I
believed I had little in common. It's
something I, and probably many of
us, should do more often. After all,
how much more will we discover if
we have the courage to resist that
fear of not belonging in order to
pursue what truly satisfies and
works for us?

separate spheres of my
life know each other, I
feel a little bit startled

To what extent is college
cliquey? In the best of worlds,
I think we'd all like to believe
that it isn't. We'd rather ignore the
strange pull that the group mentali
ty can have over our social lives, in
fluencing us to linger in surface
level conversation and to puzzle
over the dynamics that exist be
tween our different sets of friends. I
know that, from a personal stand
point, I first arrived on campus sigh
ing in relief to be free of the social
hordes that had characterized my
high-school days. I anticipated col
lege as the kind of place that would
enable me to mingle with more dif
ferent types of people, but on my
own terms.
And, indeed, my time at Stan
ford has been that way, but only
after a little bit of maturation. At
Stanford, it is entirely possible to
live independently of social cliques
or group-centered activities, but
doing so can run counter to some of
our inclinations, as well as the col
lective mindset with which we have
been (dare I say it?) indoctrinated.
Look at it this way. When we first
arrive on campus for NSO —or
even Admit Weekend our first
encounters with Stanford as an in
stitution are likely to take place
within a group-oriented frame
work. We gather together in
MemAud, barely knowing any of
the students around us, and plunge
into chants extolling how amazing
our class is. Freshman dorms prac
tice dorm cheers, insisting on their
sense of community before the indi
vidual building blocks of that com
munity have been mortared. On
campus clubs and activities do roll
outs to promote a sense of belong
ing. Before we dig down to the indi
vidual relationships that really mat
ter, our sense of group identity can
seem like everything.
The approach with which Stan
ford integrates new students, I
think, is an example of top-down
processing: in order to meet the
people who are the most like us and
who can have the most impact on
our lives, we must travel through a
group-centric hierarchical frame
work first. The fact that Stanford,
from the beginning, devotes so
much energy to promoting this
sense of community is one of the
positive aspects of being here. With
the resources that we have, it is en
tirely possible for each of us to find
our niche. Flowever, on campus, the
group mentality can persist beyond
freshman year, even if by then it has
more heft behind it than dorm
cheers shouted amongst strangers.
Call it cliques, call it stereotyping,
call it habit but it exists because
we, as human beings, tend to think
about ourselves and other people
categorically.

Even now, three years into my
time as a Stanford undergraduate, I
still tend to perceive my discrete
friends as belonging to one group or
another. For instance, I associate
different dynamics with friends
from my freshman dorm versus
friends I met in class, friends I met
while abroad and friends from my
extracurricular activities. These cat
egories are rather distinct in my
mind, and they don't tend to inter

mingle very much. It's true that the
more time we spend at Stanford, or
any other place, the smaller that
place feels. So when I realize that
two friends from two separate
spheres of my life actually know
each other, that their own spheres
are crisscrossing beyond their inter
actions with me, I feel a little bit
startled. My neatly catalogued ap
proach to visualizing my life has
been fractured.
Notice that I'm not saying that
group morale is bad, just that it can
be counterproductive when it leads
us to interact with people based
only on our categorizations of them.
This is fundamentally what cliques
do: they lend us a convenient way of
thinking about the individuals in
our lives, binding us to familiarity
and failing to press us into more di
verse relationships. What is more,
they also lead us to label ourselves
in unnecessary ways. The fluidity to
resist this mentality, when our cam
pus has been prompting us to think
in terms of our group membership
from day one, is what will bolster
our growth as individuals, even as
we remain vital contributors to a
collective effort.
Individual versus herd, self ver
sus society: none of these issues are
new. No, they didn't vanish after
high school, and from my parents'
accounts of the workplace, I suspect
that we can expect them to continue
for decades yet. But we shouldn't
view them as inevitable, either, be
cause we have more individual con
trol over our social relationships
than we might think. Some of the
most rewarding experiences I have
had at Stanford have resulted from
telling my usual group, "No, not
tonight" and engaging in a conver
sation with someone with whom I
believed I had little in common. It's
something I, and probably many of
us, should do more often. After all,
how much more will we discover if
we have the courage to resist that
fear of not belonging in order to
pursue what truly satisfies and
works for us?
