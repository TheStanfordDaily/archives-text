## What Ratatouille Tells Us About Memory 
### Tim Moon 
In a couple of months, when
tomatoes and zucchini and egg
plant are in season, go out and
buy a couple pounds of each. Make
sure they're ripe. Back in your
kitchen, throw some minced onions
and garlic in a pot with a bunch of
good olive oil. Puree some red pep
per, and throw that in after the
onions and garlic have been chilling
for a while. Puree those perfectly
ripe tomatoes too, pour those in
and let everything sit while you
roast that zucchini and eggplant in
a hot oven. Mix all that good stuff
together, add a mess of chopped
basil and thyme and baby, you got a
ratatouille goin'!
But don't just dig into your rata
touille just yet, nooo. Throw it into

the fridge, let all those flavors get
real cozy with each other. Take it
out the next day (or the day after
that), let it come to room temp (or
heat it further, up to you) then go
crazy with it. Time makes it that
much better.

Kind of like memories. We re
member our pasts fondly, seeing
past events through rose-tinted
glasses (not rose tinted, although

you'd probably remember events
just as fondly). The more time that
passes, the easier it is to forget the
annoying things about that one
friend, why you decided to end the
night early, how spicy those chicken
wings actually were and what a bad
idea it would be to eat them again.
Pictures and videos make this
even easier, of course who takes
pictures of the bad moments? No,
in the pictures you post on Face
book of that one road trip where
you managed to get two flats and it
rained four out of the five days and
one person decided that was the
weekend to start protesting animal
testing by forgoing deodorant,

you're all smiling, the sun's shining
and there are even rainbows in the
background from all that rain.
Then when you go back and look at
those photos, of course you think
that it was the greatest trip ever and
want to call everyone up to go
again.
Recently, I've been thinking a
lot about my summer after fresh
man year, puttering around China
with the Stanford Symphony Or
chestra. I keep thinking about it,
because I've been running into a lot
of friends from that trip the past
couple of weeks, and when we rem
inisce about the tour, the unani
mous feeling seems to be that it was
a pretty bomb trip, one of the high
lights of Stanford.
And it absolutely was, don't get
me wrong. We got to ride down the
Li River on our way to Guilin and
see mountains and scenery that are
on Chinese money. We got to play
in some amazing venues, like the
Great Hall of the People and the
National Center for the Perform

ing Arts (the Egg), that gorgeous
new opera house in Beijing. I had
my first xiaolongbao, and I ate
steamer basket after steamer bas
ket of them for what I would pay
for a value meal at McDonald's
here.
But if I really think hard about
it, I can start to remember what we
were actually feeling at the time.
That Li River cruise was great, for
sure, but it was also hot, muggy and
so long. Those venues were proba
bly the coolest places many of us
will ever play in, but by the time we
got to Beijing, we were all just so
tired that we didn't appreciate it as
much as we could have. Those xiao
longbao were delicious, but.. .
okay, no, I'm definitely remember
ing those correctly, those were just
bangin'.
But even if we can fight our self
inflicted brainwashing and remem
ber things as they actually were (or
think they actually were), why?
Maybe you want to remember the
bad things so that you don't acci
dentally repeat them? Not a bad
idea, but I feel like you're going to
remember anything that's really
bad anyway, and maybe it means
something that you forget about
the other not-so-great things.

Besides, having this ability to re
member only the good things or
even to remember the bad things
fondly? It's PRETTY COOL. It
means you can forget about your
sloppy moments and not feel so
self-conscious about them going
forward. It means you'll probably
have more good memories than
bad memories, which should be a
good thing. It means you don't
even have to worry about trying to
make things good, because you'll
remember them as being good!
Well, maybe that last one's pushing
it. But point taken, right? Just like
you should let those flavors do
their thing in your fridge, let your
brain do its magic.
And if you really want to, you
can eat that ratatouille right after
you make it. You'll probably re
member it as being awesome any
way.

Tim knows you want to make rata
touille when tomatoes are in season.
He'll send you a recipe if you ask
nicely, timmoon@stanford.edu.
