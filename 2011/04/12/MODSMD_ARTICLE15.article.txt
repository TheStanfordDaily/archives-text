## What Ratatouille Tells Us About Memory 
### Tim Moon 
In a couple of months, when
tomatoes and zucchini and egg
plant are in season, go out and
buy a couple pounds of each. Make
sure they're ripe. Back in your
kitchen, throw some minced onions
and garlic in a pot with a bunch of
good olive oil. Puree some red pep
per, and throw that in after the
onions and garlic have been chilling
for a while. Puree those perfectly
ripe tomatoes too, pour those in
and let everything sit while you
roast that zucchini and eggplant in
a hot oven. Mix all that good stuff
together, add a mess of chopped
basil and thyme and baby, you got a
ratatouille goin'!
But don't just dig into your rata
touille just yet, nooo. Throw it into

the fridge, let all those flavors get
real cozy with each other. Take it
out the next day (or the day after
that), let it come to room temp (or
heat it further, up to you) then go
crazy with it. Time makes it that
much better.

Kind of like memories. We re
member our pasts fondly, seeing
past events through rose-tinted
glasses (not rose tinted, although

you'd probably remember events
just as fondly). The more time that
passes, the easier it is to forget the
annoying things about that one
friend, why you decided to end the
night early, how spicy those chicken
wings actually were and what a bad
idea it would be to eat them again.
Pictures and videos make this
even easier, of course who takes
pictures of the bad moments? No,
in the pictures you post on Face
book of that one road trip where
you managed to get two flats and it
rained four out of the five days and
one person decided that was the
weekend to start protesting animal
testing by forgoing deodorant,
