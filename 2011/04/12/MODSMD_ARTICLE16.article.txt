## BRUINS BEATEN DOWN Stanford sweeps UCLA to secure No. 3 seed 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
With a balanced offense and a tremendous de
fensive effort, the men's volleyball team swept past
No. 7 UCLA 25-18,25-18,25-17 and clinched home
court for the first round of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament Saturday night in
Los Angeles. When Hawaii lost to No. 1 USC later
that night, No. 3 Stanford clinched the No. 3 seed in
the tournament, which means that the Cardinal
wouldn't play the top-seeded Trojans until the
MPSF final.

Although senior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin led the team with a match-high 10 kills,
it was the play of freshman middle blocker Eric
Mochalski and freshman outside hitter Brian Cook
that really carried the Cardinal (18-8,14-7 MPSF) to
victory. Mochalski hit .562 with nine kills, and Cook
chipped in eight with a .571 hitting percentage,
boosting Stanford's overall hitting percentage on a
night when it was tough for either team to score.
Ail-American junior outside hitter Brad Law
son had nine kills and 12 digs, but also eight attack
errors and just a .037 hitting percentage. McLachlin
also struggled to find his flow in the offense, hitting
below .200 for the night. Junior setter Evan Barry
finished the night with 31 assists, and junior libero
