## BRUINS BEATEN DOWN Stanford sweeps UCLA to secure No. 3 seed 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
With a balanced offense and a tremendous de
fensive effort, the men's volleyball team swept past
No. 7 UCLA 25-18,25-18,25-17 and clinched home
court for the first round of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation Tournament Saturday night in
Los Angeles. When Hawaii lost to No. 1 USC later
that night, No. 3 Stanford clinched the No. 3 seed in
the tournament, which means that the Cardinal
wouldn't play the top-seeded Trojans until the
MPSF final.

Although senior outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin led the team with a match-high 10 kills,
it was the play of freshman middle blocker Eric
Mochalski and freshman outside hitter Brian Cook
that really carried the Cardinal (18-8,14-7 MPSF) to
victory. Mochalski hit .562 with nine kills, and Cook
chipped in eight with a .571 hitting percentage,
boosting Stanford's overall hitting percentage on a
night when it was tough for either team to score.
Ail-American junior outside hitter Brad Law
son had nine kills and 12 digs, but also eight attack
errors and just a .037 hitting percentage. McLachlin
also struggled to find his flow in the offense, hitting
below .200 for the night. Junior setter Evan Barry
finished the night with 31 assists, and junior libero

4/9, Los Angeles

Junior libero Erik Shoji (red) digs a ball during Stanford's three-set sweep of UCLA over the
weekend. The Cardinal clinched the No. 3 seed in the MPSF Tournament with the win.
Erik Shoji had seven digs, while jun
ior middle blocker Gus Ellis had
five block assists on the night, as
part of a Cardinal defense that dom
inated the net all night.
UCLA (16-12,9-11) never got its
offense into gear and had just two
players register five or more kills. It
hit just .041 as a team, one of the
lowest totals in the MPSF all year
and the third-lowest hitting percent
age a Stanford opponent has fin
ished with since rally scoring began
in 2001. The Bruins also had a rare
negative hitting percentage in the
second set, with five more errors
than kills.
It all made for a very quick
match that lasted just over an hour
and 15 minutes in front of a crowd of
1,064. The fans saw Stanford cele
brate a victory on the floor of the
Wooden Center, with a very enthu
siastic senior class that tied the mark

for career victories with this, their
80th.

It was a much different scene
than the one that found Stanford a
little worried after its loss Friday
night at No. 6 UC-Santa Barbara.
There were plenty of scenarios
that would have allowed the Cardi
nal to clinch home court in the first
round of the MPSF and also avoid
USC. A loss by Flawaii in its two
games against USC or a victory over
either Santa Barbara or UCLA
would have done the trick. But
when Hawaii upset USC hand
ing the Trojans just their second de
feat all year and first in over two
months and the Gauchos handily
beat Stanford, things looked a little
dicey.

The loss wasn't for lack of of
fense against UCSB (14-12,11-9), as
the Cardinal hit a solid .324 and had
three players with 10 or more kills,
led by Lawson and McLachlin with
13 apiece. The problem was that
UCSB hit a ridiculous .491, with two
players over 20 kills each. Stanford
could not find away to win the side
out game, converting just 51 percent

of Gaucho serves into points in the
fourth and final set on the way to de
feat.
"Their two seniors had a great
Senior Night," said coach John
Kosty. "They played well and did
what they needed to do to slow us
down."
Mochalski was one of the few
bright spots for Stanford, as he had
10 kills and no errors while hitting
.625. But it went for naught as the
Card failed to hold the lead at 10-8
in the fourth set under the power of
UCSB's .783 hitting in the last set.
Uncharacteristically, Shoji had just
four digs on the night, well below
his season average. The team as a
whole had just 21 digs and five
blocks.
Next up for the Cardinal is the
last MPSF match of the year on the
road, at Pacific. Stanford can move
neither up nor down in the seedings
at this point and will be playing for
pride and momentum heading into
the MPSF Tournament.
