## Cardinal takes two from UCLA 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford softball traveled south
to UCLA over the weekend, drop
ping Friday's game in extra innings
before rallying to decisive victories
on Saturday and Sunday. The wins
were the Cardinal's first over
UCLA since 2007.

The No. 13 Cardinal improved to
26-8 overall and 2-4 in the Pac-10,
bouncing back nicely after getting
swept last weekend by Arizona.
Stanford outscored the No. 6 Bruins
17-8 on the weekend, despite losing
6-5 in 13 innings to open the series.
The Cardinal pitching staff shut
down UCLA (28-7,4-2) from there
on out, allowing just three runs in
back-to-back victories to take the
series.
Stanford relied heavily on the

pitching of sophomore Teagan Ger
hart, who pitched in all three games.
Gerhart pitched a career-high 13 in
nings during her Friday start and re
placed senior starter Ashley Chinn
to record the final four outs in Sat
urday's win. Fler best performance,
though, was in Sunday's finale,
when she allowed just five hits and
one run while pitching her 16th
complete game of the year. Gerhart
finished the weekend with 20 strike
outs in 21.1 innings pitched.
Friday's game was a tough loss
for the Card, with UCLA taking its
first lead of the game in its final at
bat, while Stanford stranded 16
base runners over 13 innings. Fresh
man Corey Hanewich finally broke
the stalemate with a three-RBI
triple in the top of the fourth, but
UCLA responded in the bottom of
the frame with a two-run home run
from Andrea Harrison.
In the sixth, Stanford once again
loaded the bases, scoring on junior
Ashley Hansen's sac fly to give
