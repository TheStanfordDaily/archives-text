## Cardinal takes two from UCLA 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford softball traveled south
to UCLA over the weekend, drop
ping Friday's game in extra innings
before rallying to decisive victories
on Saturday and Sunday. The wins
were the Cardinal's first over
UCLA since 2007.

The No. 13 Cardinal improved to
26-8 overall and 2-4 in the Pac-10,
bouncing back nicely after getting
swept last weekend by Arizona.
Stanford outscored the No. 6 Bruins
17-8 on the weekend, despite losing
6-5 in 13 innings to open the series.
The Cardinal pitching staff shut
down UCLA (28-7,4-2) from there
on out, allowing just three runs in
back-to-back victories to take the
series.
Stanford relied heavily on the

pitching of sophomore Teagan Ger
hart, who pitched in all three games.
Gerhart pitched a career-high 13 in
nings during her Friday start and re
placed senior starter Ashley Chinn
to record the final four outs in Sat
urday's win. Fler best performance,
though, was in Sunday's finale,
when she allowed just five hits and
one run while pitching her 16th
complete game of the year. Gerhart
finished the weekend with 20 strike
outs in 21.1 innings pitched.
Friday's game was a tough loss
for the Card, with UCLA taking its
first lead of the game in its final at
bat, while Stanford stranded 16
base runners over 13 innings. Fresh
man Corey Hanewich finally broke
the stalemate with a three-RBI
triple in the top of the fourth, but
UCLA responded in the bottom of
the frame with a two-run home run
from Andrea Harrison.
In the sixth, Stanford once again
loaded the bases, scoring on junior
Ashley Hansen's sac fly to give

Stanford a 4-2 lead. The Bruins ral
lied in the final frame with a two
run shot from Alyssa Tiumalu to
force extra innings. Gerhart man
aged to pitch her way out of a j am in
the bottom of the ninth, retiring two
straight batters with the bases
loaded.

In the 13th inning, Stanford
broke the tie when Hanewich dou
bled in Gerhart for her fourth RBI
of the game, but the Bruins again
responded with a run of their own.
Gerhart was replaced on the
mound by Chinn to start the 14th.
UCLA's Harrison led off the inning
with her second home run to end
the game with the final score 6-5
UCLA. The Bruins' reliever Aleah
Macon got the win, moving to 3-0
on the year.
Saturday saw UCLA instead
take the early lead, scoring a run in
the first. Stanford responded in the
top of the fourth, blowing the game
open with a four-run, two-out rally.
Hanewich started the scoring with a
solo shot, her fifth home run of the
season. Hansen kept the inning alive
with a single up the middle, and
sophomore Jenna Rich followed by
drawing a walk. Freshman Danielle
Miller emphatically capped the rally
with a three-run blast to center, her

fourth on the year.
The Bruins managed another
run in the bottom of the inning, but
Stanford kept up the pressure in the
fifth, with Hansen doubling and
scoring on Miller's single, her fourth
RBI of the game. Stanford added
another insurance marker in the
sixth, when Hansen doubled in
Gerhart. Hansen finished the game
4-for-4 with two doubles and one
RBI. She is batting an astounding
.541 on the season, with a .604 on

base percentage and a .908 slugging
percentage through 34 games.
Chinn earned the win in a solid
5.2 innings of work, giving up nine
hits and two runs while striking out
four to run her record to 12-2. Jessi
ca Hall took the loss for UCLA,
moving to 14-5.
On Sunday, the Cardinal jumped
out to an early 1-0 lead when Miller
knocked a hit up the middle to pro
duce a run off Hansen's leadoff sin
gle. The lead was extended to 2-0 in

the top of the fourth, when Rich
slugged her club-leading eighth
home run on her 20th birthday.
Stanford tallied again in the fifth
and sixth, scoring on RBI singles by
freshman Michelle Prong and Ger
hart and on a sacrifice fly from
Miller. UCLA narrowly managed
to avoid the shutout, scoring its first
run against Gerhart with one out
left in the game. Gerhart retired the
final batter to secure the 5-1 win,
moving her record to 14-6 on the

year and giving Stanford the series
win. UCLA's Donna Kerr took the
loss to fall to 10-2, being pulled from
the game after less than two innings.
The Cardinal returns home
tonight for a single game versus San
Jose State at 6 p.m. and will resume
conference play this weekend at
home against Oregon State (17-13,
1-5 Pac-10).
