## Stanford's Bobbie Kelsey named head women's basketball coach at Wisconsin 
### â€“ Nate Adams 
After four years as an assistant
coach with Stanford, Bobbie Kelsey
was named the new head coach of
the University of Wisconsin
women's basketball team on Mon
day.
In her time with the team, Kelsey
helped Stanford reach the Final Four
in four consecutive seasons. Stanford
posted an overall record of 137-14 in
that time, including a 69-3 run in Pac
-10 play.
"We are thrilled for Bobbie and
for the opportunity she has earned at
Wisconsin," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "Bobbie
has done an outstanding job here at
Stanford over the past four years and
truthfully it is bittersweet to see her
leave, I know that she will continue
to do a fine job in Madison, and we
wish her the absolute best."
Kelsey's biggest contribution
may have been the development of
Stanford's defense. Over the past
three seasons, the Cardinal has set
school records in lowest opponent

scoring average, lowest opponent
field-goal percentage and rebound
ing margin.

As a player from 1991-96, Kelsey
was a four-time letterwinner and
helped to power Stanford to its 1992
national championship. She was a
co-captain in 1995 and '96, was voted
the team's Most Inspirational Player
in 1992 and '96, and was named the
team's Most Improved Player in
1993.
