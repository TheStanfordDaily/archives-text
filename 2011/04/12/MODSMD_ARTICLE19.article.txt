Pedersen, a 6-foot-4 versatile for

was picked seventh by the Tulsa

Pac-10's all-time leading rebounder
with 1,266 rebounds and is the
Stanford career leader in games
started with 149 and minutes
played with 4,762.
Pohlen, a 6-foot shooting guard
turned-point guard from Brea,
Calif., was picked ninth by the Indi
ana Fever, who lost in the first round

of the 2010 playoffs. Based on her
career-high numbers of 14.5 points
and 4.75 assists per game in 2010-11,
Pohlen was this year's Pac-10 Player
of the Year and made multiple All-
America teams. She set a Stanford
record with 96 three-pointers and
tied Pedersen's school record of 150
games played.
During the four years Pedersen
and Pohlen played on the Farm,
Stanford went to four straight Final
Fours and finished 63-0 at Maples
Pavilion while compiling a 137-14
record overall.
