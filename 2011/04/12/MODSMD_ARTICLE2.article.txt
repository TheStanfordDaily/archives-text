## Stallman weighs pros and cons of digital inclusion Internet use may lead to government censorship, Stallman says 
### ERIN INMAN STAFF WRITER 
Richard Stallman, founder of the free software
movement and the GNU Project, spoke Monday
on the benefits and threats of digital inclusion in
society.
Stallman defines digital inclusion as the cre
ation of an inclusive information society in which
all people have access to information and commu
nication technology.
"We see a lot of efforts for the sake of digital in
clusion which presume that using the Internet is
good," Stallman said. "I don't necessarily agree."
Stallman said the Internet is good if it gives
practical advantages and bad if it takes away free
doms we would otherwise have. Such threats to
our freedom include Internet surveillance and
censorship, secret data formats and providing soft
ware as a free service, he argued.
In a free society, individuals are not guaranteed
anonymity in public, but information is hardly ever
collected because it is so diffuse. Electronic sur
veillance, in contrast, produces compact and con
venient databases of information, Stallman said.
Surveillance is already pervasive in digital tech
nology through the widespread use of personal cell
phones, electronic toll payments and even certain
types of subway tickets. Most if not all of these
technologies could relay the same practical advan
tages they currently do while preserving anonymi
ty. Their implementers, however, prefer to survey
people, Stallman said.
"They say surveillance will help catch the stan
dard boogie man, but really, government surveil
lance is more dangerous," Stallman said.
According to Stallman, car tracking allowed
police to "sabotage a peaceful protest" in the Unit
ed Kingdom.
"We know police around the world do not re
spect human rights when protests are against the
government," he said. "We should be concerned
over anything that allows police to have more
power over dissidents."
Though the Internet often serves as a symbol
for subverting censorship, it is now being used to
establish censorship by governments that filter ac-
cess, close domain names and arbi
trarily close websites without a
trial, Stallman said.
Another manner in which data
inclusion can threaten freedom is
by secret or patented data formats.
Before the digital age, information
was published in unconcealed for
mats like the book.
Now, a large amount of audio
and video are distributed in a secre
tive format, such as that used by
Hulu. Stallman criticized patented
and secretive formats for their re
striction of the development of
players in a field.
In the same vein, he criticized
proprietary software, which is soft
ware that users cannot control.
"This is an injustice, because it
subjects users to the control of a
program which is controlled by
someone who has power over the
user's program," Stallman said.
The opposite option, free soft
ware, allows users the freedom to
run programs, study and change
source codes; redistribute exact
copies of a program and distribute
copies of modified versions to

their community.
By opening the code, free soft
ware protects users and non-coding
users alike from malicious coding
by threatening to expose the devel
opers' intentions, whereas closed
software creates no such safe
guards.
Like proprietary code, software
as a service threatens freedom by

putting information in an outsider's
hands. Software as a service, such as
Google Docs, invites users to out
source their data for computing.
But now Google has users' comput
ing and controls it, Stallman said.
"How can you be sure it won't
give that data to Big Brother?"
Stallman asked.
Despite Stallman's critiques of
digital inclusion, he observed that
one of its greatest benefits is the
noncommercial redistribution of
exact copies of published works.
"Sharing creates the bonds of
society," Stallman said.
Jonathan Ellithorpe, a doctoral
student in electrical engineering,
disagreed with Stallman's views on
sharing.
"I think that patent law is very
good in that it allows for incubation
of ideas; it allows people to develop
high levels of ideas before sharing,"
Ellithorp said. "Whereas in coun
tries with weak copyright laws, peo
ple copy each other all the time and
make it hard to reach a high level of
product and service development."
Stallman's talk was part of the
Stanford Center for Internet and
Society's speaker series.
