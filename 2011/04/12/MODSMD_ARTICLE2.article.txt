Richard Stallman, founder of the free software
movement and the GNU Project, spoke Monday
on the benefits and threats of digital inclusion in

types of subway tickets. Most if not all of these
technologies could relay the same practical advan

ty. Their implementers, however, prefer to survey
people, Stallman said.
"They say surveillance will help catch the stan

According to Stallman, car tracking allowed
police to "sabotage a peaceful protest" in the Unit
ed Kingdom.
"We know police around the world do not re
spect human rights when protests are against the
government," he said. "We should be concerned
over anything that allows police to have more

Though the Internet often serves as a symbol

establish censorship by governments that filter ac-
