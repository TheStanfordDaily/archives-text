### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Manny, Manny, Manny
(writer looks down,
shakes his head dis
approvingly).
On Friday, the baseball career of
arguably one of the top-five right
handed hitters of all time came to an
end most unceremoniously. Facing a
100-game suspension for a third posi
tive test for performance-enhancing
drugs in his career, Manny Ramirez,
as he has done time and time again,
walked away from his team and likely
from the hearts and minds of baseball
fans and players that both feared and
admired him for the past 15 years.
Since his retirement on Friday,
there has been much discussion in
newspapers, across the Internet and
on television about whether Ramirez
belongs in the Hall of Fame. At first
glance, a .312 career batting average
and 555 home runs should be enough,
but of course, most pundits argue a
three-time cheater doesn't belong.
After all, Mark McGwire, who never
tested positive for performance-en
hancing drugs but has admitted use,
only got 19 percent of the vote in last
year's Hall of Fame vote plus,if you
get caught three times, there's clearly
something more-than-fishy going on,
not to mention Ramirez clearly
thought he was above the law.
I'm going to go against the grain a
bit and say that if I had a Hall of Fame
