# Manny being Manny

### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Manny, Manny, Manny
(writer looks down,
shakes his head dis
approvingly).
On Friday, the baseball career of
arguably one of the top-five right
handed hitters of all time came to an
end most unceremoniously. Facing a
100-game suspension for a third posi
tive test for performance-enhancing
drugs in his career, Manny Ramirez,
as he has done time and time again,
walked away from his team and likely
from the hearts and minds of baseball
fans and players that both feared and
admired him for the past 15 years.
Since his retirement on Friday,
there has been much discussion in
newspapers, across the Internet and
on television about whether Ramirez
belongs in the Hall of Fame. At first
glance, a .312 career batting average
and 555 home runs should be enough,
but of course, most pundits argue a
three-time cheater doesn't belong.
After all, Mark McGwire, who never
tested positive for performance-en
hancing drugs but has admitted use,
only got 19 percent of the vote in last
year's Hall of Fame vote plus,if you
get caught three times, there's clearly
something more-than-fishy going on,
not to mention Ramirez clearly
thought he was above the law.
I'm going to go against the grain a
bit and say that if I had a Hall of Fame

vote, Manny Ramirez would receive
one from me. I don't want to turn this
into a column about the Hall of Fame
merits of purported steroid users, but
I will say that steroids were pervasive
in baseball during Ramirez's career,
that no one is quite sure who was tak
ing them and who wasn't and that
pitchers and hitters were both using.
Not to mention the fact that for much
of Ramirez's career, Major League
Baseball hadn't banned steroids, and
many people around baseball turned
a blind eye to their use.
So using steroids as an automatic
disqualifier doesn't work for me. Can
it knock you down a peg? Sure, but if
it weren't for Albert Pujols, we might
be calling Ramirez the best right
handed hitter that ever lived (yes,
there are other players that you could
argue belong in the conversation).
Ramirez was scarily good
throughout his career. When he came
up with the Cleveland Indians as a
rail-thin kid, he was already terrifying
for pitchers to face. In his first full sea
son in 1995 (because the 1994 season
was shortened by a strike), all
Ramirez did was hit .308 with 31
home runs and 107 RBI in only 137
games. And with that, he was just
scratching the surface.
Ramirez spent the heyday of his
career with the Boston Red Sox. As
many of you know, I'm a New York
Yankees fan, and I have a visceral ha
tred for the Red Sox. I won't pick Red
Sox on my fantasy teams, I think their
fans are a bunch of bandwagoners
who jumped on in 2004 and I've been
to Fenway Park just once (and proba
bly won't go back unless it is to watch
the Yankees play there). That said,

there were few players I enjoyed
watching and feared more than
Manny Ramirez.
Give me the choice of pitching to
David Ortiz, Kevin Youkilis, Dustin
Pedroia or any of the Red Sox stars,
and I would gladly throw four high
and wide to Manny to get to them.
Watching him hit in his prime
which was my own baseball prime (if
you could call it that) was terrify
ing and beautiful at the same time.
He would hit the ball so hard that
you felt that it might come through
the television screen. He could hit
fastballs, he could hit breaking balls,
he could pull the ball and he could go
the other way. To quote Forrest
Gump, he was like a fish in water. He
may not have appeared to know
what the pitcher was throwing, but
he seemed to, without fail, get his
barrel to the ball.
Sure, Ramirez was a character. He
was Manny being Manny. Yes, he
made stupid plays in the field and on
the bases, and yes, he did quit on the
Red Sox, the Dodgers and the Rays (I
was at his last game as a Red Sock; it
was Sunday night baseball at Yankee
Stadium, and he came in to pinch hit
against Mariano Rivera in the bottom
of the eighth inning and took three
straight strikes right down the middle
I'm convinced to this day that he
had no intention of swinging or trying
anymore). But there was something
about the carelessness with which he
played the game that was refreshing.
You could tell he was just a big kid out
there playing with men. He never
took anything too seriously and to
fans of baseball like myself, he will be
sorely missed.

Daniel Bohm's baseball "prime " was
when he took three straight strikes
from Rivera in a video game. Find
