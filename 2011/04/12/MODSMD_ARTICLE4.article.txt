# Standard of proof lowered
## Sexual-assault policy changes reflect new federal guidelines 
### ELIZABETH TITUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will lower its standard of proof for
sexual-assault cases and open the appeals
process to alleged victims in response to
guidelines released to universities last week
by the Obama administration.
The swift development comes amid a
longer-term review of Stanford's judicial-af
fairs process and a one-year pilot program
specifically focused on improving the Univer
sity's handling of sexual-assault cases. It brings

Stanford into line with the vast majority of
universities that use the lower standard for
sexual assault cases, an issue on which Stan
ford has been an outlier for years, administra
tors said Monday.
The changes are at the direction of the De
partment of Education's Office for Civil
Rights, which is stepping up its implementa
tion of Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex
discrimination at schools that receive federal
money.
