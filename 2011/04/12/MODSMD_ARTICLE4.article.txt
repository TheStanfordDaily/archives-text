# Standard of proof lowered
## Sexual-assault policy changes reflect new federal guidelines 
### ELIZABETH TITUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will lower its standard of proof for
sexual-assault cases and open the appeals
process to alleged victims in response to
guidelines released to universities last week
by the Obama administration.
The swift development comes amid a
longer-term review of Stanford's judicial-af
fairs process and a one-year pilot program
specifically focused on improving the Univer
sity's handling of sexual-assault cases. It brings

Stanford into line with the vast majority of
universities that use the lower standard for
sexual assault cases, an issue on which Stan
ford has been an outlier for years, administra
tors said Monday.
The changes are at the direction of the De
partment of Education's Office for Civil
Rights, which is stepping up its implementa
tion of Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex
discrimination at schools that receive federal
money.

"We have to do better, and we
have to do better now," Vice Presi
dent Joe Biden said last Monday
speaking at the University of New
Hampshire about sexual-violence
prevention and the new guidelines.
The Office for Civil Rights said
in sexual-violence cases, prepon
derance of evidence is the "appro
priate" standard of proof and that if
schools provide appeals processes,
they must do so for both parties.
Those guidelines differ from Stan
ford's former rules, which required
alleged victims to prove their cases
beyond reasonable doubt and
which only provided an appeals
process for "responding" students
those accused of sexual miscon
duct.
Although both parties may now
appeal, the grounds for doing so
will remain the same, said Assistant
Dean of Student Life Jamie Pon
tius-Hogan.
Stanford President John Hen
nessy approved the changes to
Stanford's process, effective im
mediately, after universities re
ceived the new federal guidelines
on April 4.
Governing the process for sexu
al-violence cases here is the Alter
native Review Process, a one-year
pilot program set to end in Decem
ber. In addition to sexual assault,
the process and the new federal
guidelines cover sexual harass
ment, dating violence and stalking.
The Board on Judicial Affairs and
community members developed
the pilot program in hopes it would
resolve sexual-violence cases more
quickly and privately.
The federal directive means that
no matter the fate of the pilot pro
gram whether the University
keeps, changes or does away with it
the lower standard of proof and
new appeals process will remain.
Stanford must now design its sexu
al-violence process around the
mandates, said Dean of Student
Life Christine Griffith.
"I feel like we have been given a
charge to say,'We really need to fig
ure that out before the end of De
cember,"' Griffith said.
The changes will also remain in
place regardless of the conclusions
of Stanford's "internal review
panel." Launched earlier this
school year, it is taking the first
major look at Judicial Affairs since
the Student Judicial Charter of
1997.
The standard of proof has been a

specific area of focus for the inter
nal reviewers, who are set to issue a
report by the end of the school year.
Reviewers could count on one
hand the number of other universi
ties they found using the high "be
yond reasonable doubt" standard,
which Stanford had had in place
since before 1997, Griffith said.
The Office for Civil Rights' ef
forts come as the office investigates
allegations by 16 Yale students who
say their university is violating Title
IX and tolerating a "hostile sexual
environment."
Nationwide, 20 percent of fe
male college students and 6 percent
of male college students will be vic
tims of attempted or actual sexual
assault, according to the Depart
ment of Education.
At Stanford from 2007 to 2009,
an average of about 11 "forcible
sexual offenses" occurred each
year, according to police.
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll praised the changes after
Boardman announced them Mon
day.
"Lowering of the standard of
proof is absolutely crucial to the
women's community," Cardona
said.
Survivors of sexual assault must
not be deterred from the judicial
system because of too high a stan
dard, she added.
Addressing women's issues was
an early focus of Cardona's term;
she and former Vice President Kel
sei Wharton 'l2 met with Hennessy
in October to discuss a lower stan
dard of proof, she said, and she led a
number of student groups in urging
the Judicial Affairs review panel to
consider the change. Michael Cruz
'l2 was elected to ASSU president
on Saturday on a platform that in
cluded working to lower the stan
dard.
But ASSU efforts were locked
in the longer-term review process
until the federal government hand
ed down its guidelines last week.
Widespread student opinion on
the issue has yet to be tested.
"I will say I know there are vary
ing viewpoints on this, but I think it
is at the end of the day a big ad
vancement for the women's com
munity and for Stanford Universi
ty," Cardona said.
"For people who might be con
cerned about the change in the bur
den, the standard of proof, then [it
is] probably an opportunity for
people to be saying to themselves,'l
need to be really educated about
these issues because I don't want to
find myself in this circumstance,"'
Griffith said.

Stanford will lower its standard of proof for
sexual-assault cases and open the appeals
process to alleged victims in response to
guidelines released to universities last week
by the Obama administration.
The swift development comes amid a
longer-term review of Stanford's judicial-af
fairs process and a one-year pilot program
specifically focused on improving the Univer
sity's handling of sexual-assault cases. It brings

Stanford into line with the vast majority of
universities that use the lower standard for
sexual assault cases, an issue on which Stan
ford has been an outlier for years, administra
tors said Monday.
The changes are at the direction of the De
partment of Education's Office for Civil
Rights, which is stepping up its implementa
tion of Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex
discrimination at schools that receive federal
money.

"We have to do better, and we
have to do better now," Vice Presi
dent Joe Biden said last Monday
speaking at the University of New
Hampshire about sexual-violence
prevention and the new guidelines.
The Office for Civil Rights said
in sexual-violence cases, prepon
derance of evidence is the "appro
priate" standard of proof and that if
schools provide appeals processes,
they must do so for both parties.
Those guidelines differ from Stan
ford's former rules, which required
alleged victims to prove their cases
beyond reasonable doubt and
which only provided an appeals
process for "responding" students
those accused of sexual miscon
duct.
Although both parties may now
appeal, the grounds for doing so
will remain the same, said Assistant
Dean of Student Life Jamie Pon
tius-Hogan.
Stanford President John Hen
nessy approved the changes to
Stanford's process, effective im
mediately, after universities re
ceived the new federal guidelines
on April 4.
Governing the process for sexu
al-violence cases here is the Alter
native Review Process, a one-year
pilot program set to end in Decem
ber. In addition to sexual assault,
the process and the new federal
guidelines cover sexual harass
ment, dating violence and stalking.
The Board on Judicial Affairs and
community members developed
the pilot program in hopes it would
resolve sexual-violence cases more
quickly and privately.
The federal directive means that
no matter the fate of the pilot pro
gram whether the University
keeps, changes or does away with it
the lower standard of proof and
new appeals process will remain.
Stanford must now design its sexu
al-violence process around the
mandates, said Dean of Student
Life Christine Griffith.
"I feel like we have been given a
charge to say,'We really need to fig
ure that out before the end of De
cember,"' Griffith said.
The changes will also remain in
place regardless of the conclusions
of Stanford's "internal review
panel." Launched earlier this
school year, it is taking the first
major look at Judicial Affairs since
the Student Judicial Charter of
1997.
The standard of proof has been a

specific area of focus for the inter
nal reviewers, who are set to issue a
report by the end of the school year.
Reviewers could count on one
hand the number of other universi
ties they found using the high "be
yond reasonable doubt" standard,
which Stanford had had in place
since before 1997, Griffith said.
The Office for Civil Rights' ef
forts come as the office investigates
allegations by 16 Yale students who
say their university is violating Title
IX and tolerating a "hostile sexual
environment."
Nationwide, 20 percent of fe
male college students and 6 percent
of male college students will be vic
tims of attempted or actual sexual
assault, according to the Depart
ment of Education.
At Stanford from 2007 to 2009,
an average of about 11 "forcible
sexual offenses" occurred each
year, according to police.
ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll praised the changes after
Boardman announced them Mon
day.
"Lowering of the standard of
proof is absolutely crucial to the
women's community," Cardona
said.
Survivors of sexual assault must
not be deterred from the judicial
system because of too high a stan
dard, she added.
