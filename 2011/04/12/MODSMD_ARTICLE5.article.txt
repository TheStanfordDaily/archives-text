## Million Crane Project raises awareness for Japan relief 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Several campus groups are continuing
their efforts to raise awareness for Japan dis
aster relief. One such endeavor, the Million
Crane Project, began soon after the 9.0 earth
quake and tsunami struck northeast Japan,
when several students at Stanford and
Princeton decided to make one million origa
mi cranes to show emotional support for vic
tims of the disaster.
"There's a Japanese legend that says that if

you fold one thousand cranes, your wish will
come true," said Shelly Xie 'l2, a representa
tive of the Million Crane Project.
"In honor of that legend, we decided to set
a goal of one million cranes, with the hope
that many of our wishes for Japan will come
true," she said. "We want to reach the people
in Japan, and we wish to convey our hope to
them."
The group kicked off its project during fi
nals week by setting up tables in campus din
ing halls at lunch and dinner for students to
contribute to the crane-folding effort.

Though the group originally hoped to gather
one million cranes by the one-month an
niversary of the disaster, the deadline has
now been extended to May 11, the two-

month anniversary.
Several Japan- and service-affil
iated groups at Stanford includ
ing Stanford University Nikkei
(SUN), the Japanese Student Orga
nization, the Stanford-Japan Ex
change Club (SJEC), StanfordTzu-
Chi and the graduate Stanford
Japanese Students (SJA) have
since joined in on the effort. Na
tionwide, the project has more than
50 groups participating, from stu
dents at Harvard and Yale to sever
al girl-scout troops.
Currently, the project is not con
nected to a specific fundraising ef
fort, but the project hopes to use
these cranes as a platform for
fundraising among both the stu
dent body as well as bigger donors.
"The cranes are more the emo
tional support that we're showing,"
Xie said.
All cranes are currently being
collected at Princeton, where the
project organizers hope to use them
to create a monument that can one
day be sent to Japan. A similar me
morial to the atom bomb victims
exists in the Japanese city of Hi
roshima, which displays cranes sent
from children all throughout the
world.
SUN has also been selling a re
lief t-shirt for Japan; proceeds from
the sale will be donated to the
American Red Cross. Later this
month, the organization will screen
Howl's Moving Castle and donate
proceeds to Japanese relief efforts.
"We are trying to find places to
donate directly to the nonprofits in
Japan, so that the funds that we
raise could be used in the longer
term for people," Xie said. "That's
because we're hoping that they
could be used not just for immedi

ate relief but also later on when
they need to rebuild."
In addition to raising hope for
the people of Japan, the relief effort
has greatly inspired many of those
who are involved.
"It makes me feel so hopeful to
see people from so many back
grounds Asians, Asian Ameri
cans, Caucasians, African Ameri
cans, people of Japanese descent,
people of Chinese descent, working
in harmony for this cause," wrote
Tzu Chi president Kevin Hsu, a
graduate student in civil and envi
ronmental engineering, in an email
to the crane project participants.
"That's the real story here: that we
can come together at Stanford to
send love to Japan."
"As human beings, we all go
through difficulties, and we all need
help at time," Xie said. "This is the
time to show Stanford spirit, to
show our awareness and passion
for global issues, to show those in
need that we are here for them and
that they are not alone."
