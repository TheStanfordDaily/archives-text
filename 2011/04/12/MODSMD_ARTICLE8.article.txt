## Researchers test new clinical trial system 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A team of Boston- and Stanford-based
researchers has devised a less costly, clinic
based approach to randomized clinical trials
(RCT) that shifts patients to a more success
ful therapy as the trial progresses. The
method, based on the Veteran's Affairs (VA)
electronic medical records system (EMR), is
currently being tested in a comparative effec
tiveness trial of two insulin regimens in the
Boston VA system.
The new approach, called a point-of-care
clinical trial, aims to apply the statistical
strength of an RCT to the real-world settings
of observational studies.
"We're trying to build in [to medicine] a
process of learning, and we're trying to do
that in away that's both valid and not terribly
expensive or slow," said Philip Lavori, pro
fessor of biostatistics at Stanford.
Lavori designed the new system in collab
oration with the Boston team. The fruits of
their research efforts were published in Clin
ical Trials this month.
In clinical medical research, randomized
clinical trials are recognized as the gold stan
dard, because they can determine without
bias whether drugs or medical technologies
work and which among them are most effec
tive. Since these trials are often prohibitively
long and expensive, investigators instead use
observational data from everyday care with
wide generalizability. Without randomiza
tion, however, observational studies cannot
eliminate inherent biases that arise from
knowing which patients use which
therapy.
"The problem we have right now
is that the two methods we have for
learning are either just to look at
data that occur in the ordinary
course of treating patients ... or we
can do these big, expensive, but very
valid studies and get very good an
swers," Lavori said.
"We're in the middle," he said of
the new method.
According to researchers, the
new method will be used for prag
matic clinical trials, which examine
the comparative effectiveness of ap
proved drugs in everyday patients.
"We're not looking to introduce
new treatments we're interested
in looking at which treatments are
more effective than others," said the
study's lead author Louis Fiore, who
is the director of the Department of
Veterans Affairs Cooperative Stud
ies Program Coordinating Center in
Boston.

The point-of-care approach em
beds randomization into everyday
clinical care. When a physician at
the VA prescribes an insulin regi
men to a diabetic using the EMR, a
dialog box usually gives two op
tions: one for the control treatment
and one for the experimental treat
ment. The box now includes a "no
preference" option, which, if select
ed, explains the trial to the patient.
Furthermore, if consent is given, the
EMR-based system randomizes the
patient to one of the two therapies.
The data inputted to the EMR
during physician visits is automati
cally gathered for the trial and used
to track the overall progress of pa
tients in the two insulin therapy

groups. If one type of therapy con
sistently outperforms the other, the
randomization tool begins to put
more patients into the successful
therapy pool. This process contin
ues until the probability of one ther
apy being better than the other ex
ceeds 99 percent.
All of the randomization and
data collection is done within the
EMR, making it easier for investi
gators to carry out comparative ef
fectiveness studies.
In light of the growing focus on
health care costs, comparative effec
tiveness research can help deter
mine if more expensive therapies
actually outperform their cheaper
or generic counterparts. The gov
ernment has therefore increased
funding for the research, creating a
huge new market for the VA team's
design.
"Comparative effectiveness re
search really has taken on new life
in the last couple of years," said
study co-author Ryan Ferguson,
who is a member of the Boston
team.
The team eventually wants to ex
pand this system to different arenas
of medical research. Fiore and Fer
guson said they were investigating
the possibility of conducting a larg
er study on PTSD, the prevention of
acute kidney injury, pain manage
ment or infectious diseases. They
also aim to expand the VA system
beyond Boston and the Northeast
region.
"In five or 10 years, I think the
only surviving health care systems
will be the ones that could do some
thing like this," Lavori said. "And
then we hope it will be seen as a
comparative advantage."
He noted that the long-term goal
is to have "automated and rapid im
provements in care and to build that
into the system so that the care just
keeps getting better."

All of the randomization and
data collection is done within the
EMR, making it easier for investi
gators to carry out comparative ef
fectiveness studies.
In light of the growing focus on
health care costs, comparative effec
tiveness research can help deter
mine if more expensive therapies
actually outperform their cheaper
or generic counterparts. The gov
ernment has therefore increased
funding for the research, creating a
huge new market for the VA team's
design.
"Comparative effectiveness re
search really has taken on new life
in the last couple of years," said
study co-author Ryan Ferguson,
who is a member of the Boston
team.
The team eventually wants to ex
pand this system to different arenas
of medical research. Fiore and Fer
guson said they were investigating
the possibility of conducting a larg
er study on PTSD, the prevention of
acute kidney injury, pain manage
ment or infectious diseases. They
also aim to expand the VA system
beyond Boston and the Northeast
region.
"In five or 10 years, I think the
only surviving health care systems
will be the ones that could do some
thing like this," Lavori said. "And
then we hope it will be seen as a
comparative advantage."
He noted that the long-term goal
is to have "automated and rapid im
provements in care and to build that
into the system so that the care just
keeps getting better."
