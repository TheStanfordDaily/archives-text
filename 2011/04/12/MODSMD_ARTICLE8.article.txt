## Researchers test new clinical trial system 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A team of Boston- and Stanford-based
researchers has devised a less costly, clinic
based approach to randomized clinical trials
(RCT) that shifts patients to a more success
ful therapy as the trial progresses. The
method, based on the Veteran's Affairs (VA)
electronic medical records system (EMR), is
currently being tested in a comparative effec
tiveness trial of two insulin regimens in the
Boston VA system.
The new approach, called a point-of-care
clinical trial, aims to apply the statistical
strength of an RCT to the real-world settings
of observational studies.
"We're trying to build in [to medicine] a
process of learning, and we're trying to do
that in away that's both valid and not terribly
expensive or slow," said Philip Lavori, pro
fessor of biostatistics at Stanford.
Lavori designed the new system in collab
oration with the Boston team. The fruits of
their research efforts were published in Clin
ical Trials this month.
In clinical medical research, randomized
clinical trials are recognized as the gold stan
dard, because they can determine without
bias whether drugs or medical technologies
work and which among them are most effec
tive. Since these trials are often prohibitively
long and expensive, investigators instead use
observational data from everyday care with
wide generalizability. Without randomiza
tion, however, observational studies cannot
eliminate inherent biases that arise from
