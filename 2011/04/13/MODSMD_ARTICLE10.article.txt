# Officials release update about PG&E lines
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Billy Gallagher 
Stanford officials released a report yesterday to reas
sure community members that the University has accu
rate and up-to-date information about natural gas
pipelines in the area.
Larry Gibbs, associate vice provost for environmental
health and safety, and other Stanford
officials have met periodically with
officials from Pacific Gas & Electric
(PG&E) about the safety of these
lines since a gas line explosion oc
curred in San Bruno last September.
There are two PG&E gas lines
that run parallel to Junipero Serra

Boulevard from Page Mill Road to
Sand Hill Road. The pipes are nor
mally buried about four feet below
the surface and their location is
clearly marked by signs and stakes
along the roadway.
PG&E officials informed Stan
ford officials last fall that these gas
lines were evaluated for internal
corrosion in 2007 and no such corro
sion was found. However, officials
also told Stanford they have not
been able to find records for most of
the lines along Junipero Serra.

PG&E has taken several short
term risk mitigation steps, reducing
the maximum operating pressure in
these pipelines and performing ex
ternal inspections of the lines. The
inspections did not identify any is
sues.

Stanford officials pledged to con
tinue to focus on this issue and meet
with PG&E representatives to en
sure the reliability of the gas trans
mission lines near Stanford property
and homeowners.
