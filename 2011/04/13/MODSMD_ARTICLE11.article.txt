## FROM CHALK TO CANVAS PROFESSOR TRACES THE PATH TO BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL ARTIST 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
In his aesthetically sparse office, Xiaoze
Xie sits, his eyes full of quiet intensity.
Art books fill the shelves, next to a no
table stack of haphazardly stacked
newspapers. Xie's restless hands twirl a
pen, brandishing it like a brush as he absent
mindedly traces abstract swirls over and
over on a yellow legal pad of paper. Art, for
Xie, the Paul L. and Phyllis Wattis Professor
of Art and Art History, has not only become
a successful career but also a lifelong pas
sion.
Xie was born in a small town in Guang
dong Province in China. The youngest of
three, Xie began pursuing his interest in art at
a very early age.
"It sort of just happened naturally," he
said. "When I was young, I loved drawing. My
father used to work as a teacher, a high school
director. I was able to pick up chalk in his of
fice and draw with it."
Xie's early drawing subjects were diverse,
ranging from cars to people such as Mao Ze
dong to ordinary objects.
"I was always fascinated by vehicles like
trucks," Xie said. "You didn't see many cars
passing by too often. I also drew people. Once,
I remembered learning how to draw Mao."
Xie took art classes through middle and
high school before continuing on to study
architecture at Tsinghua University in Bei
jing, a decision based on a compromise be
tween pursuing what he loved and gaining

practical skills.
"In high school, I did really well in math
and science, and at the time, science, technol
ogy and engineering were the thing to do,"
Xie said. "I was interested in art, and I thought
architecture would be a nice combination of
art and science."
Although Xie did well in architecture, he
found the field of study to be too restrictive.
"In architecture, you have to take into con
sideration many factors," Xie said. "It seemed
very compromising ... I was longing for
something freer and more expressive."
After graduating in 1988, Xie entered a
grad program in mural painting at the Central
Academy of Arts and Design in Beijing, a
move that disappointed his family.
"Architecture was considered to be practi
cal [architects] make a great living," Xie
said. "When I switched to art, they believed
that I was not serving the proper profession."
Despite his parents' lack of approval, Xie
recalled, they did not resist his change in ca
reer plans.
"No one tried to force me to change," Xie
said. "My parents said to me,' You know that's
what you want to do, then do it.'"
In Beijing, Xie enjoyed the thrill of fast
paced city life.
"It was very exciting for me to see all of the
national monuments," Xie said. "This sense of
excitement and ambition and ... the future,
was the driving force [for me] as a young
man."
During his graduate studies in Beijing, the
infamous Tiananmen massacre broke out
when Chinese troops broke up nonviolent

ent protesting for economic reform. This
ically charged moment in history would
2 an indelible mark on Xie.
It was something that struck me pretty
, but the change in my art from political
social issues was not an immediate or di
outcome of that event," Xie said. "It's not
you have such an experience and then
lenly decide to become a political painter.
I have a profound influence on me in the
run."
1 1993, Xie came to the United States,
ing to update his art knowledge by study-
Vestern art.
I'd been interested in studying Western
;ontemporary art," Xie said. "In the '80s,
Lad this feeling that we were isolated [in
ia]. The flow of information wasn't as
as it is now."
ie went on to obtain a master of arts from
'crsilv of North Texas, where he, as a TA,

antly, had a small, personal studio. The ex
ire to Western artists, such as Francisco de

sd an enormous role in shaping Xie's art.

2s, I felt more interested in the potential
curative art, in realism, in more contem
ry context."
de experimented with different styles,
i photorealistic to more expressive. Even
y, Xie finally found a topic that would
with him for many years — the theme of
ibrary.

"My subjects include Western books,
stacks of newspapers, close-up views of news
paper stacks that revealed fragments of pho
tos and text, decaying books," he said. "I am
interested in exploring time and documenta
tion, the history of memory and how this
memory can be so fleeting."
After receiving his master's degree from
the University of North Texas, Xie went on to
teach at Washington State University. Not
long afterwards, he received a tenured posi
tion at Bucknell University.
The campus's proximity to New York
proved to be a stroke of well-timed fortuity
when Xie's works in Charles Cowles Gallery
began to receive national recognition. His
work has been acknowledged across interna
tional lines in Canada, China and Korea.
In 2009, Xie joined Stanford's art depart
ment faculty. Beyond his teaching responsi
bilities, Xie is busy with his two current solo
exhibitions "Layers: Recent works by Xi
aoze Xie" at Chambers Fine Art, in New
York, and "Amplified Moments," a collection
of his works from 1993-2008 at the Knoxville
Museum of Art in Tennessee.

Professor Xiaoze Xie has been drawn to art
since he was a small child growing up in small-town China. Throughout his studies in China
and the U.S., his style has transformed.
In his aesthetically sparse office, Xiaoze
Xie sits, his eyes full of quiet intensity.
Art books fill the shelves, next to a no
table stack of haphazardly stacked
newspapers. Xie's restless hands twirl a
pen, brandishing it like a brush as he absent
mindedly traces abstract swirls over and
over on a yellow legal pad of paper. Art, for
Xie, the Paul L. and Phyllis Wattis Professor
of Art and Art History, has not only become
a successful career but also a lifelong pas
sion.
Xie was born in a small town in Guang
dong Province in China. The youngest of
three, Xie began pursuing his interest in art at
a very early age.
"It sort of just happened naturally," he
said. "When I was young, I loved drawing. My
father used to work as a teacher, a high school
director. I was able to pick up chalk in his of
fice and draw with it."
Xie's early drawing subjects were diverse,
ranging from cars to people such as Mao Ze
dong to ordinary objects.
"I was always fascinated by vehicles like
trucks," Xie said. "You didn't see many cars
passing by too often. I also drew people. Once,
I remembered learning how to draw Mao."
Xie took art classes through middle and
high school before continuing on to study
architecture at Tsinghua University in Bei
jing, a decision based on a compromise be
tween pursuing what he loved and gaining

practical skills.
"In high school, I did really well in math
and science, and at the time, science, technol
ogy and engineering were the thing to do,"
Xie said. "I was interested in art, and I thought
architecture would be a nice combination of
art and science."
Although Xie did well in architecture, he
found the field of study to be too restrictive.
"In architecture, you have to take into con
sideration many factors," Xie said. "It seemed
very compromising ... I was longing for
something freer and more expressive."
After graduating in 1988, Xie entered a
grad program in mural painting at the Central
Academy of Arts and Design in Beijing, a
move that disappointed his family.
"Architecture was considered to be practi
cal [architects] make a great living," Xie
said. "When I switched to art, they believed
that I was not serving the proper profession."
Despite his parents' lack of approval, Xie
recalled, they did not resist his change in ca
reer plans.
"No one tried to force me to change," Xie
said. "My parents said to me,' You know that's
what you want to do, then do it.'"
In Beijing, Xie enjoyed the thrill of fast
paced city life.
"It was very exciting for me to see all of the
national monuments," Xie said. "This sense of
excitement and ambition and ... the future,
was the driving force [for me] as a young
