## EDITORIAL To secure dorms, give us all access 
### 
Saturday's forcible sexual as
sault in Escondido Village has
refocused campus attention to
a growing pattern of criminal
events involving peepers, prowlers
and other intruders. While these in
cidents highlight the need for stu
dents to redouble their efforts to
secure doors and windows, this
Board also believes that improving
campus safety may also merit fur
ther review of existing Residential
housing policies. Specifically, the
administration should consider a
policy under which any Stanford
undergraduate can access any
other undergraduate dorm as a
counterintuitive but effective
means of promoting residential
safety and solving several minor
nuisances.
Minor benefits to students are
readily apparent: no longer will
rollouts entail pre-dawn acrobatics
through bathroom windows, uni
versal access would obviate pesky
Door King machines and the logis
tics of group meetings would sim
plify considerably. However, the
real impetus for this policy is
grounded in the need to exclude
outsiders more effectively.
Unfortunately, current policies de
signed to protect students from in
truders are unrealistic. Despite
Res Ed's pleas not to admit non
residents into dormitories, resi
dents routinely let in strangers, pre
suming innocence, to avoid the
awkwardness of inconveniencing a
likely classmate.
On the other hand, if all under
graduate ID cards opened all
dorms, far fewer students would
loiter outside dorm entrances. This
would increase the level of suspi
cion for those who do have criminal
intentions. Such a policy would thus
allow RAs to change students' be
havior, asking them to take respon
sibility for ensuring that non-stu
dent visitors in fact have a legiti
mate reason to enter a dorm.
Critics of this proposal may
point to the vastly increased access
that students now have to one an
other's dorms as a fault of the pol
icy. They may contend that stu
dents can harass others or commit
thefts more easily once locked
dorms pose no physical barrier to
any student. But this is a much
more tractable problem, that of

deterring and enforcing miscon
duct among Stanford students.
Each of us is bound by certain
codes, like the Fundamental Stan
dard, and so philosophically any
policy should presume our inno
cence instead of actively seeking
to prevent malfeasance.
Moreover, students are far more
accountable than outsiders are
judicial and administrative mecha
nisms exist to prosecute and deter
wrongdoers, and Stanford students
frankly have much more to lose
than most criminals.The data bears
out the assumption that Stanford
students are less likely to commit
serious crimes on campus: most se
rious thefts, and intruder incidents
like last year's shower peeping and
last weekend's sexual assault, have
usually involved suspects from out
side of the Stanford community. A
policy to enhance public safety
should target exclusively these
non-students, as they pose the
greatest danger to students and are
least accountable to the University.
ResEd and the Department of
Public Safety should be commend
ed for going to extraordinary
lengths to secure our campus. Ded
icated residential safety patrols, an
noying sirens to discourage door
propping and flyers encouraging
residential security are all steps in
the right direction. By recognizing
that the real threats are campus
outsiders and giving all undergrads
universal card access to campus
dorms, Stanford can take one step
further toward a safer campus.
