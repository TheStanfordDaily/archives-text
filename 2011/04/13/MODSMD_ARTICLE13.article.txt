# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
Dear Editor,
Instead of putting forth a reason
able argument to change ASSU
funding policies ("Something that
Actually Needs Saving," April 4,
2011), Zack Hoberg and Dave
Grundfest chose to mislead and
denigrate fellow Stanford students.
Zack and Dave blame "90 graduate
students" and the "ridiculous policy
that one population can dictate the
other's funding decision" for the re
jection of joint Special Fees for
FLiCKS. Let's examine two facts,
one conveniently omitted, the other
completely glossed over.
Fact one: 655 graduate students,
58 percent of the grad students who
voted, said no to funding FLiCKS.
Zack and Dave arrive at their 90
students by asking how many grad
students (of the 1132 that voted)
would have to change their mind to
get 50 percent approval. Zack and
Dave never mention the 655 no
votes, or that these votes comprised
58 percent of the grad votes cast.
The repeated use of "90 graduate
students" throughout the editorial,
without any mention of the real
numbers, is disingenuous at best. It
becomes blatantly biased when
they describe the graduate students
as "miserly troglodytes," especially
when the graduate student body
approved every other joint fee ap
plications (there were five more)
by margins greater than or equal to
10 percent.
Fact two: Zack and Dave men
tion in passing that FLiCKS,

"[elected] to apply for special fees
from the entire student popula
tion." They then go on to claim that
the 50 percent required approval
of each population is "little
known." This is clear misdirection.
The required 50 percent approval
is clearly elucidated in the ASSU's
"Information for Special Fee
Groups" under the "Voting Proce
dure" section. Furthermore, the
ASSU also include a disclaimer de
claring, "The group should make a
careful determination of its con
stituents to determine the appro
priate Special Fee to seek." Asking
grad students to pay means making
the case that they should pay.
FLiCKS failed to do this, resulting
in 58 percent of grad voters saying
"nay."
Zack and Dave's final point be
comes clear at the end of the article
that ASSU policy should allow
groups like FLiCKS to receive spe
cial fees funding from the group of
voters who approved it, even if the
joint application is denied. Since
nearly three out of four undergrads
approve of FLiCKS, FLiCKS ought
to receive undergrad special fees.
The FLiCKS result could have been
used to effectively argue for a
change in ASSU policy; instead,
Zack and Dave chose to make their
point by misleading their readers
and alienating fellow Stanford stu
dents.
