## The 						Marvelous Rio de Janeiro 
### Johnny Bartz 
It's fitting that I'm writing about
Rio this week a cidade mar
avilhosa because I just found
out that I will be moving there next
year. I first flirted with Rio on an or
chestra tour in high school, but soon
enough I was back, speaking Por
tuguese (no, contrary to popular be
lief, I am actually not Brazilian) and
studying anything from the Ama
zon Rainforest to Brazilian litera
ture. I bought a wardrobe's worth of
speedos to wear in Rio a sun
worshipper's Mecca filled with
beautiful people.
But you don't need to have such
an overwhelming commitment to
experience Rio. If you speak even a
little Spanish, you can communicate
with a Brazilian. Actually, you can
communicate only with hand ges
tures. The only thing you really need
to say in Portuguese is " Oi, tudo
beml " "Hey, how's it going?"
Also, a thumbs-up for anything that
pleases you is indispensible. You
only need to be in the mood for a
good time to be accepted in Rio.
The leisurely dress code in Rio is
speedos, soccer jerseys, Havaianas
flip-flops and board shorts for men,
whispy dresses, sandals and colorful
anything for women. Less is usually
more, especially at the beach. Men
wear speedos and women wear tri
angles. Note that if you are going to
or coming from the beach, it is per
fectly acceptable to wear a speedo
anywhere in the city. Also if you are
engaging in any form of physical ac
tivity, you'll usually wear a speedo.
This "dress code" applies actually
for everyone, which can be a beauti
ful godsend, other times just a sheer
disaster.
At the beach or around town,
there is a smattering of small juice
shops that also sell things to eat.

Look for one that actually has real
fruit in the display, and you can't go
wrong. The first thing that I usually
eat in Rio is pao de queijo crispy
balls of doughy cheesy goodness
with acai a sticky and sweet pur
ple drink filled with antioxidants.
Also, there is nothing like sipping
on a coconut at the beach and eat
ing biscoitos crunchy puffy rings
of goodness. Don't leave Brazil
without having a caipirinha a
strong drink made from sugar, lime
and sugarcane brandy. After two
you'll be speaking portugues and
dancing the samba.
Cariocas (people from Rio)
identify strongly with the neighbor
hood they are from, and these social
distinctions are ever prevalent at
the beach. The exclusive Leblon is
for the rich and famous. You will
nearly always see a celebrity of
some kind soccer players, soap
opera stars they all have to go to
the beach. Ipanema is classy, young
and fun. Surfers hang out at Posto 7,
as it is where the waves are best.
Posto 8 is primarily for families. Be
tween Postos 8 and 9 is the LGBT
beach you can't miss the giant
rainbow flags. Posto 9 is the young
and hip beach and Posto 10 is for the
muscle boys it's near an open-air
weightlifting/show off area. Co
pacabana is the largest beach, bor
dered by the famous Avenida At
lantica. It's more middle-class and
mainstream, but very fun.

Besides the beach there are
plenty of touristy things to do in
Rio. You must see Crista Redenta r
the Jesus statue. The Sambodro
mo, dancing at an escola de samba
and seeing a soccer game at the
Maracana are highly recommend
ed. Pao deAcucar the big 'sugar
loaf mountain' is nice, but I think
the view from Jesus is better. Also,
day trips to Parati, Petropolis or a
romantic weekend in Buzios or Ilha
Grande are all easy to do. Sao Paulo
is just eight hours by bus.
Nightlife in Rio is second to
none. Praca Santos Durmont in
Gavea is nice on Thursday or Sun
day. Lapa is always happenin' on
the weekends with restaurants, bars,
clubs and general revelry in the
streets. Bigger clubs are in Copaca
bana, but if something a little qui
eter takes your fancy, try an upscale
bar/lounge in Leblon or Ipanema.
There is nothing wrong with sipping
on a drink with an ambience of
Bossa Nova.
As far as crime is concerned,
what you've heard is probably exag
gerated. I feel safer in Rio than in
Oakland. Aside from petty theft,
and if you're not traipsing through
the slums, you'll be fine. Nonethe
less, a true carioca will carry small
amounts of cash in both pockets in
case one gets 'borrowed' from.
So, like the hundreds of people
who I've invited to stay with me dur
ing the World Cup in 2014,1 basical
ly offer an open invitation for any
one to come down to visit me in Rio
next year. I'm telling you, you're
going to fall in love with this city.

What is your most outrageous beach
outfit? Johnny has probably seen
