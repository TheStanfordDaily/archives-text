## CARD COMEBACK No. 17 Stanford rallies to a 3-1 victory over Pacific 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
overcame the Pacific Tigers on
Tuesday night with clutch hits and
excellent pitching to pull off a 3-1
comeback win at Sunken Dia
mond.
Cardinal pitchers teamed up to
allow just three hits, but No. 17
Stanford (16-9) couldn't get its of
fense moving until late in the game,
stranding seven runners and
grounding into four double plays in
the first seven innings before scor
ing three runs in the bottom of the
eighth to surpass the Tigers (10-
19).

Freshman righthander
A J. Vanegas was first to go for the
Card, getting the call to start for
just the second time of his young
career. Vanegas had some trouble
with walks, allowing three runners
to reach on balls, but he flashed an
excellent curveball and gave up
only one Tiger hit in the first three
innings.
The bullpen continued the strong
pitching effort for Stanford, as jun
ior righty Elliott Byers was perfect
in relief of Vanegas after taking the
hill in the top of the fourth. In just
his third appearance of the season,
Byers blew through three innings
without allowing a baserunner and
struck out three, dropping his ERA
from 13.50 to 6.35 in the process.
Things got interesting in the top of
the seventh inning, when Scott
Snodgress replaced Byers on the
mound. The junior lefty struggled
with his fastball command, as he
bookended a walk with a popout
and a strikeout, then gave up a sin

gle to send runners to first and sec
ond with two out. Tiger second
baseman Tyger Peterson, a Palo
Alto native, then ripped a single
into left field, finally breaking the
tie to snag a 1-0 lead.
Snodgress then gave up another
walk to load the bases, but induced
a ground ball to end the inning,
leaving the Cardinal with just nine
outs to push runs across after it had
already stranded six men on the
basepaths in the first six innings.
Thankfully for Stanford, the top
of the lineup was up to the task in
the bottom of the eighth. Jake
Stewart crushed a deep line drive
into left-center field that just
missed the glove of left fielder
Daniel Johnson, leading to a lead
off triple for the sophomore center
fielder. Senior catcher Zach Jones
then knotted up the game at 1-1 by
blasting an RBI double off the
first-base bag for his 15th RBI of
the season.
"We had guys on base all night,
we just couldn't get the big two-out
hit," Jones said afterward. "I was
just trying to put it in play, I was
down 0-2 and he threw me a pitch I
could handle."
After a walk to Diekroeger, Pis
cotty then broke the tie by reaching
on a badly misplayed groundout to
second base, bringing home Jones
to give Stanford a 2-1 lead. Piscotty
went on to score the third run of
the game after he advanced from
first to third on a failed pickoff at
tempt, and then crossed the plate
on a sacrifice fly from freshman
first baseman Brian Ragira.
The two-run lead was more than
enough for junior lefty Chris Reed,
as he blazed through the bottom of
the Tiger lineup to secure the win,
striking out three batters in the last
two innings to even his record at 1-
1 for the season and give the Cardi

"I was just trying to take advantage

increased focus.
"We're not taking anything for

The Stanford baseball team
overcame the Pacific Tigers on
Tuesday night with clutch hits and
excellent pitching to pull off a 3-1
comeback win at Sunken Dia
mond.
Cardinal pitchers teamed up to
allow just three hits, but No. 17
Stanford (16-9) couldn't get its of
fense moving until late in the game,
stranding seven runners and
grounding into four double plays in
the first seven innings before scor
ing three runs in the bottom of the
eighth to surpass the Tigers (10-
19).

Freshman righthander
A J. Vanegas was first to go for the
Card, getting the call to start for
just the second time of his young
career. Vanegas had some trouble
with walks, allowing three runners
to reach on balls, but he flashed an
excellent curveball and gave up
only one Tiger hit in the first three
innings.
The bullpen continued the strong
pitching effort for Stanford, as jun
ior righty Elliott Byers was perfect
in relief of Vanegas after taking the
hill in the top of the fourth. In just
his third appearance of the season,
Byers blew through three innings
without allowing a baserunner and
struck out three, dropping his ERA
from 13.50 to 6.35 in the process.
Things got interesting in the top of
the seventh inning, when Scott
Snodgress replaced Byers on the
mound. The junior lefty struggled
with his fastball command, as he
bookended a walk with a popout
and a strikeout, then gave up a sin

gle to send runners to first and sec
ond with two out. Tiger second
baseman Tyger Peterson, a Palo
Alto native, then ripped a single
into left field, finally breaking the
tie to snag a 1-0 lead.
Snodgress then gave up another
walk to load the bases, but induced
a ground ball to end the inning,
leaving the Cardinal with just nine
outs to push runs across after it had
already stranded six men on the
basepaths in the first six innings.
Thankfully for Stanford, the top
of the lineup was up to the task in
the bottom of the eighth. Jake
Stewart crushed a deep line drive
into left-center field that just
missed the glove of left fielder
Daniel Johnson, leading to a lead
off triple for the sophomore center
fielder. Senior catcher Zach Jones
then knotted up the game at 1-1 by
blasting an RBI double off the
first-base bag for his 15th RBI of
the season.
"We had guys on base all night,
we just couldn't get the big two-out
hit," Jones said afterward. "I was
just trying to put it in play, I was
down 0-2 and he threw me a pitch I
could handle."
After a walk to Diekroeger, Pis
cotty then broke the tie by reaching
on a badly misplayed groundout to
second base, bringing home Jones
to give Stanford a 2-1 lead. Piscotty
went on to score the third run of
the game after he advanced from
first to third on a failed pickoff at
tempt, and then crossed the plate
on a sacrifice fly from freshman
first baseman Brian Ragira.
The two-run lead was more than
enough for junior lefty Chris Reed,
as he blazed through the bottom of
the Tiger lineup to secure the win,
striking out three batters in the last
two innings to even his record at 1-
1 for the season and give the Cardi
