# Hawaii downed, Cal up next
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
After playing three consecutive
road games, the No. 1 Stanford
women's water polo team returned
home and beat No. 5 Hawaii, 10-8.

It was the second time that Stan
ford (21-0,5-0 MPSF) matched up
with Hawaii (13-7,3-3) this season,
as the two teams met back in late
February during the UCI Invita
tional in which the Card doubled up
the Rainbow Wahine, 10-5.

It was a back-and-forth affair
between the two teams. Stanford
found itself down 1-0 as junior at
tacker Monika Eggens found the
back of the net midway through
the first. The Cardinal offense
started sluggishly as it missed two
five-meter penalty shots in the
opening quarter.
Moreover, Hawaii senior goalie
Serena Bredin had a stellar quarter
with five blocked shots. The Cana
dian keeper finished the contest
with 10 total saves.
Stanford quickly responded in
the second frame with four goals,
however, including one by sopho
more two-meter Annika Dries a
minute into the quarter. Eggens
scored two quick goals for Hawaii
just 36 seconds apart to keep the
game close.
In the third quarter, the teams
each scored two goals. Stanford got
contributions from junior two
meter Melissa Seidemann and
freshmen driver Kaley Dodson.
It was 6-5 going into the fourth
quarter and the Rainbow Wahine
knotted up the score with a goal by

sophomore attacker Monique Wil
son.
As it has done time and time
again this season, Stanford pulled
away with a 4-1 run including an
other clutch goal by Seidemann.
The Cardinal reached the 10
goal mark for the 18th time this
season. The strong offensive per
formance was complimented by a
solid defensive outing as all three
goalies saw playing time. Sopho
more Kate Baldoni tallied six saves
in the opening half and senior
Amber Oland stopped five shots.
