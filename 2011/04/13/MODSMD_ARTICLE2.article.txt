## Talk compares students to excellent sheep 
### JANELLE WOLAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday, writer and former Yale professor Bill
Deresiewicz declaimed to a packed audience in An
nenberg Auditorium that Stanford students are real
ly just excellent "hoop-jumping, teacher-pleasing
sheep." The event was the first annual lecture hosted
by seniors in the Ethics in Society program.

Associate Pro
fessor of Political Sci
ence Rob Reich
opened the discussion
by quoting from Dere
siewicz's June 2008 ar
ticle, "The Disadvan
tages of an Elite Edu
cation." In that article,
Deresiewicz states that
he has taught very in
telligent students at
Yale and Columbia
who were content to
stay within the con
fines of their own edu
cation.

Author and former Yale
professor Bill Deresiewicz
speaks to Stanford students
in Annenberg Auditorium.
Deresiewicz compared
students at elite universities
to 'hoop-jumping' sheep.

Having spent 10
years at Yale as an Eng
lish professor, Dere
siewicz is now a full
time writer. He works
as a contributing editor
at both The Nation and
The New Republic. His
next book "A Jane
Austen Education" is

coming out this year,
and he is currently focusing on his new book project
"Excellent Sheep: The Disadvantages of an Elite Ed
ucation."
Deresiewicz believes that elite university educa
tion fails to prepare students for the larger world. He
pointed to the Wall Street collapse, the military fail
ure in Iraq and Barack Obama as examples.
"Obama thought he was going to get an A on his
midterms from the American people just because he
had all the right answers," Deresiewicz said.
According to Deresiewicz, elite university educa
tion is deficient because admission criteria are more
than 100 years old; what admission offices look for in
an applicant today is the same as what they looked
for in 1905.
"I think that the multicultural meritocracy today
is no different from the monocultural aristocracy 100
years ago," Deresiewicz said. "We're becoming ossi
fied and complacent and self-congratulatory. We
need to transcend ourselves."
Deresiewicz said the need to have 12 different ex
tracurricular activities has grown over the years to
such an extent that people have become pathologi
cally busy doing a million things because they
think they should.
Deresiewicz pointed to celebrity James Franco as
a reductio ad absurdumoi this phenomenon. Franco
is currently a doctoral student at Yale, but is also in
volved in programs at UCLA, Columbia, NYU and
Brooklyn College.
In a Q&A session after the talk, students asked
Deresiewicz for his solution to the problem of high
er education. He encouraged students to ask "the big
questions," to be independent thinkers and to find
their passions.
Regarding admission offices, Deresiewicz said
they should not require a myriad of extracurricular
activities and should instead focus on finding stu
dents with more depth than breadth. He even sug
gested students consider taking time off before, dur-

ing or after college.
"Step outside of the system of
higher education," Deresiewicz
said. "Do something that they can't
put on their resume. There is enor
mous power in letting yourself
breathe and see that there are other
worlds."
Deresiewicz's words resonated
strongly with students.
"We usually get speakers who
encourage us to follow the incen
tive system," said Aysha Bagchi 'll.
"But he addressed issues that really
woke us up."
"It sometimes surprises me how
quickly some speakers come up
with answers to students' ques
tions," said Karen Shen 'l3. "But he
was so honest and obviously
thought about his answers."
Lilian Rogers 'l3 said Dere
siewicz spoke to some of the dis
content she already felt, but ad
mitted that despite the talk she
still feels "trapped in the sys
tem."
Deresiewicz noted that though
students may be hoop-jumping

sheep because of the university sys
tem, it's up to them to ask more pro
found questions and think outside
the box.
