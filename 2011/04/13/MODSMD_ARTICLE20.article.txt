# Football belongs on the Farm
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
Last weekend, in what has to
be the first time in recorded
history, the ASSU actually
ranked higher than Stanford
football in importance
among the student body. The Cardinal
and White spring game and the re sults
of the ASSU spring general election
both came on Saturday, yet somehow,
despite having a preseason top-10
team and the best quarterback in col
lege football, the team's biggest public
showcase before next season attract
ed decidedly less student interest than
the election.
A big reason for the disinterest on
the Farm was because the spring game
wasn't played in Stanford Stadium
for the second consecutive year, the
game was held at Kezar Stadium at
Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
The athletic department did its part to
get students involved by sponsoring
free buses from campus to Kezar and
back (which, in full disclosure, I took
advantage of to head to the city and
cover the game for The Daily) and of
fering one Red Zone point toward Big
Game tickets next year.
Overall, I have to say that having
the game at Kezar Stadium was actual
ly quite a lot of fun. The game took on
a very festive atmosphere, with plenty
of tailgating and pickup games out in
the park. Kezar itself lent itself well to
hosting the spring game with a re
ported turnout of around 6,800, the
small stadium created a very intimate
atmosphere, which would have been
lost in 50,000-seat Stanford Stadium.
Lastly, it was pretty nice to take a day
trip up to the city and watch some foot
ball without having to spend a dime.
Yet despite the great experience I
had in San Francisco, I still think the
game should be moved back to Stan
ford Stadium next season and for the
foreseeable future. If the end goal of
having a spring game is to promote in
terest in Stanford football and get fans
excited about the coming season, put
ting the game on campus is a much bet
ter way to achieve those goals.
To give a bit of background as to
why the game is in Kezar in the first
place, Stanford Stadium was under
going renovations to its turf last
spring, so the athletic department
settled on Kezar as the best replace
ment venue for the game. The former
head coach who shall not be
named in this column liked it im
mensely, so this year's game was
scheduled for Kezar as well. Playing
in San Francisco was said to have a
number of advantages, namely build
ing a fan base in a city whose college
football scene has historically been
dominated by California.
To start with, that premise is just
dumb; there's no other way to really
describe it. Cal fans, whose hate for
Stanford could probably power the
San Francisco power grid if we could
figure out how to harness it, are not
going to suddenly switch over because
we played a glorified scrimmage at tiny
Kezar, especially with the Golden
Bears playing their home games at
AT&T Park next season. Few fans that
know about our spring game and care
enough to attend are going to be per
suaded by the game to buy season tick
ets; by and large, those in attendance
were either already dedicated fans or
alumni who used the game as a good
place for a mini-reunion.
Kezar also made life fairly difficult
for the press corps. As you would ex
pect in a high school stadium, the press
box was tiny and literally crammed
with ESPN equipment, and from what
I hear about the ESPN3.com video
feed, the coverage was pretty terrible.
Obviously Stanford Stadium, with its
spacious press box and optimization
for TV audiences, would help boost the
game's media coverage.
Most importantly, keeping the
game at Stanford Stadium keeps inter
est high among the main pillars of the
team's fan base: alumni, others in the
surrounding area and the students. An
on-campus game ensures easy access
for everyone who wants to attend the
game, and Stanford could offer free
parking as a solid incentive to attend.
Perhaps most importantly, a spring
game at Kezar Stadium indicates that
Stanford is not quite yet ready to step
up and be a big-time program, since it
hosts its spring game in a dinky little
high school venue. Though we'll never
attract 90,000 fans to our spring game

like Alabama does, Stanford can at
least broadcast the message that it is
ready to be taken seriously and move
its signature spring showcase to its
beautiful facility right here in Palo
Alto.

Kabir Sawhney wants the spring
game at Stanford Stadium so he can
enjoy the spacious press box. Untan
gle his biases and tell him to sit with
the commoners at ksawhney@stan
