# Senate discusses publications
## ASSU approves Publications Board bill, debates campaign spending caps 
### KURT CHIRBAS STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate passed a bill
on Tuesday night that would refine the role
of the ASSU Publications Board and dis
cussed a separate piece of legislation that
would put caps on campaign expenditures
in ASSU elections.
The "Bill to Improve Campus Publica
tions," co-authored by ASSU publications
directors Zachary Warma 'll and Alice
Nam 'll, aims to raise the previous ASSU
funding cap of $6,000 for individual cam
pus publications to $lO,OOO.
"Traditionally, the reason for the publi
cation board is to take up-and-coming pub
lications, give them a couple of years of
funding and send them off on special fees,"
Warma said. "As we've seen in the last two
elections, publications particularly,
those that are trying to improve lose out
on the special fee ballots because they
weren't able to mount an all-scale campus
wide campaign."
Nam said by increasing the amount of
funding that can be given, publications like
Stanford Scientific Quarterly could be
completely taken off of special fees in the

future. She also said the publication board
typically receives $70,000 from discre
tionary funding each year. Historically, it
only spends $40,000 of this amount.
"It would make sense to make sure the
money goes to funding student groups in
stead of being floated into the reserves year
after year," Nam said.
Senate Chair Madeline Hawes'l3 ini
tially said there had not been enough time
to review the bill when it was presented for
discussion during the meeting. She took a
straw poll to determine whether or not to
vote on the bill last night, but the majority
voted against taking action on the legisla
tion.
However, when Nam clarified that the
bill had been sent prior to the Monday at
noon deadline, Hawes said it was a mistake
that the item had not been placed on the
agenda. The Senate took a five-minute re
cess to read the bill.
In the end, the bill gained the two-thirds
majority necessary with two revisions: it no
longer states that the publication fund
would be pegged to one-tenth of the Un
dergraduate Senate General Fund and that
the ASSU publications director would
serve as the grammarian of the Undergrad

uate Senate.
The discussion then turned to the "Bill
to Reform Elections to Create Equal Ac
cess to ASSU Elected Positions," which was
co-authored by ASSU President Angelina
Cardona 'll and President-elect Michael
Cruz 'l2. This piece of legislation aims to
put caps on the amount candidates can
spend in ASSU general elections: up to
$lOO in Senate races and $4OO in class pres
ident races.
Lauren Felice 'l4, who ran in the sopho
more class president race under the slate
"Face to Face," talked about the difficulty
of competing against candidates with high
er spending budgets. She described how
this circumstance takes the focus away
from substantive issues in election races.
"I support the $4OO limit," Felice said. "I
think one of the hardest burdens was buy
ing T-shirts in this election. A $4OO limit
would eliminate that very high cost option,
which I don't think is representative of
competence in that position."
Many senators, however, expressed con
cerns that putting a financial cap would
heighten the influence of endorsing organ-
izations in election process. Quinn
Slack 'll, the former Elections
Commissioner, said the change
would give ASSU incumbents a
greater advantage, making it harder
for those outside the student gov
ernment to get involved.
"This is like capping a leaking
hose," Warma said. "You cap it at
one place and it's going to blow up
at another place."
Senator Will Seaton 'l3 suggest
ed holding a town hall to discuss the
issue with the student body.
All spending bills including
one to fund The Claw magazine
were passed.
