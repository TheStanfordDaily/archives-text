## Stanford welcomes US, Russian scholars 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Farm serves as a converging place
today for 20 Russian and 20 American stu
dent delegates who are participating in the
second annual Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum
(SURF). According to SURF co-founder
Anda Gansca 'll, SURF aims to build and
improve U.S.-Russian relations by providing
"a forum for open conversation between
Russian and American students."
SURF was co-founded by Gansca and
Sam Stone 'lO, who built upon their experi
ences studying in Moscow through the Bing

Overseas Studies Program. Stone is now in
charge of SURF's operations in Moscow,
where is he living as a Fulbright Scholar.
The 2010-11 SURF program includes
three components: a five-day stint in
Moscow during in the autumn, a year-long
research project on a topic in US-Russia re
lations and this week's capstone conference
at Stanford.

The capstone conference, which takes
place April 13 to 16, features a series of
public talks, simulations and seminars.
Teams of Russian and American students
will also present their research projects
the product of a yearlong, dual continent

collaboration.
"Right now, we have 10 research groups
working on all sorts of topics, ranging from
private security to venture capital," Gansca
said.
Matt Grossman 'l3, SURF public rela
tions director, noted that the program gener
ally attracts candidates who are interested in
political science and international relations.
He hopes the conference will forge lasting
connections between Russian and American
students, and foster a better understanding of
Russia.
