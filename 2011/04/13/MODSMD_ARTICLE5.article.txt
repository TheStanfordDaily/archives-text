# STUDENT LIFE
## Stanford welcomes US, Russian scholars 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Farm serves as a converging place
today for 20 Russian and 20 American stu
dent delegates who are participating in the
second annual Stanford U.S.-Russia Forum
(SURF). According to SURF co-founder
Anda Gansca 'll, SURF aims to build and
improve U.S.-Russian relations by providing
"a forum for open conversation between
Russian and American students."
SURF was co-founded by Gansca and
Sam Stone 'lO, who built upon their experi
ences studying in Moscow through the Bing

Overseas Studies Program. Stone is now in
charge of SURF's operations in Moscow,
where is he living as a Fulbright Scholar.
The 2010-11 SURF program includes
three components: a five-day stint in
Moscow during in the autumn, a year-long
research project on a topic in US-Russia re
lations and this week's capstone conference
at Stanford.

The capstone conference, which takes
place April 13 to 16, features a series of
public talks, simulations and seminars.
Teams of Russian and American students
will also present their research projects
the product of a yearlong, dual continent

collaboration.
"Right now, we have 10 research groups
working on all sorts of topics, ranging from
private security to venture capital," Gansca
said.
Matt Grossman 'l3, SURF public rela
tions director, noted that the program gener
ally attracts candidates who are interested in
political science and international relations.
He hopes the conference will forge lasting
connections between Russian and American
students, and foster a better understanding of
Russia.
But SURF is not all about poli
tics it's about business, too.
According to Grossman, Russia
has its sight on developing "a busi
ness zone along the lines of Silicon
Valley."

"That's obviously something
Stanford has been very successful at
and we're excited to work with a
whole new generation of students
in Russia who are trying to do the
same thing there," he said.
All these objectives fall under
the umbrella of ameliorating U.S.-
Russia relations.
According to SURF Vice Presi
dent Lindsay Funk *l3, both gov
ernments "have been working very

hard to improve relations between
the two countries."
To that effect, the United States
and Russia have collaborated on
nuclear issues and business issues,
among other things, she said.
"There's this famous moment
where Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton met with the Russian For
eign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and
pressed the button to reset U.S.-
Russian relations," Grossman said.

While this development was met
with optimism, it also signaled the
beginning of an era of unknowns.
"No one really knows where the
relationship is going," Grossman
said. "And SURF sees that students
are really the ones who are going to
be shaping the outcome of the rela
tionship in 10 years or 20 years."
"We pick students who we think
are going to be future leaders,"
Funk said, noting that SURF tar
gets individuals who are smart, per
sonable and highly interested in
Russian-American affairs.
Gansca sees many opportunities
for SURF to improve and expand in
the future. She noted that "there
will be a lot of changes" in the com
ing years. Several of these changes

are already in place, including a stu
dent-initiated course called "Recre
ating Silicon Valley."
At Stanford, SURF is currently
under the supervision of the Center
for Russian, East European &
Eurasian Studies (CREEES) but is
in the process of transitioning to a
different branch of the University.
"I think in the next few years,
SURF will become a national NGO
in the U. 5.," Gansca said. "We are
currently negotiating with a few or
ganizations and student body presi
dents from MIT and other universi
ties."
"We're not interested in being
stagnant," Funk said. "We're con
stantly growing."
Since its founding, SURF has re
mained a student-run organization.
The program boasts ties to Moscow
State University, the Moscow State
for International Relations, the
Academy of National Economy in
Moscow and the Higher School of
Economics in Moscow.
SURF is funded by Stanford, a
Russian company called Renova
and the Fund for the Improvement
of Postsecondary Education
(FIPSE).
