## Professors aim to revamp classroom education 
### ELLORAISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students tired of the lecture-section
paper-problem set routine now have several op
tions for reprieve, including classes using interac
tive online lectures, avatars and new approaches
to problem-solving. These experiments in in
struction come as the University reexamines its
approach to undergraduate education.
Computer science professor Daphne Roller's
novel approach involves 75-minute lectures with
interactive questions delivered to her students
online twice a week, which they view and answer
at their own pace.
"In the context of a classroom, people don't
really think about the questions because they're
still busy taking notes, whereas here the video
stops until the student acknowledges that a ques
tion has been asked," she said.
"If they don't know the answer, they can go
back and rewind and watch the last segment
again," she added. "That's very valuable to the
students and, in the surveys that we ran, was one
of the most popular features."
Roller also had an optional classroom meet
ing once a week, where she clarified misunder
standings, held interactive exercises building on
the material and implemented case studies that
built on lecture material.
"What I think this tries to do is exploit the po
tential functionality enhancements that this new
online medium affords us, while at the same time
catering better to the kinds of learning that this
new generation of students is more suited for and
comfortable with," she said.
Assistant history professor Edith Sheffer had
students in her German history class adopt a vir
tual avatar and contribute weekly diary entries to
a class discussion forum, exploring class topics
from the assigned avatar's point of view.
"It's difficult in the humanities to demon
strate relevance and applicability," she said."One
of the broader goals of the project is to teach per
spective shifting, which is something students can
carry forth in later life, as well as self-directed ex
ploration: not just learning the course material
but really desiring to go beyond it."
She employs the same methods in a new class
this quarter, but in accordance with previous re
quests for more freedom, has allowed students to
manufacture their identities from scratch instead
of assigning them herself
Sheffer discussed a physics major who was
initially skeptical of the project.
"He compared the project to a problem set in
a math or science class where it's not just enough
to listen to the lecture, but you need to apply the
learning to specific situations," she said.
Associate mechanical engineering professor
Banny Banerjee, who teaches at Stanford's Insti
tute of Design, applies multidisciplinary "design
thinking" in the material he teaches. He de
scribed it as an innovative approach to large
problems that employ the "neural nets and parts
