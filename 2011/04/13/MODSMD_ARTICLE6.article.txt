## Professors aim to revamp classroom education 
### ELLORAISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students tired of the lecture-section
paper-problem set routine now have several op
tions for reprieve, including classes using interac
tive online lectures, avatars and new approaches
to problem-solving. These experiments in in
struction come as the University reexamines its
approach to undergraduate education.
Computer science professor Daphne Roller's
novel approach involves 75-minute lectures with
interactive questions delivered to her students
online twice a week, which they view and answer
at their own pace.
"In the context of a classroom, people don't
really think about the questions because they're
still busy taking notes, whereas here the video
stops until the student acknowledges that a ques
tion has been asked," she said.
"If they don't know the answer, they can go
back and rewind and watch the last segment
again," she added. "That's very valuable to the
students and, in the surveys that we ran, was one
of the most popular features."
Roller also had an optional classroom meet
ing once a week, where she clarified misunder
standings, held interactive exercises building on
the material and implemented case studies that
built on lecture material.
"What I think this tries to do is exploit the po
tential functionality enhancements that this new
online medium affords us, while at the same time
catering better to the kinds of learning that this
new generation of students is more suited for and
comfortable with," she said.
Assistant history professor Edith Sheffer had
students in her German history class adopt a vir
tual avatar and contribute weekly diary entries to
a class discussion forum, exploring class topics
from the assigned avatar's point of view.
"It's difficult in the humanities to demon
strate relevance and applicability," she said."One
of the broader goals of the project is to teach per
spective shifting, which is something students can
carry forth in later life, as well as self-directed ex
ploration: not just learning the course material
but really desiring to go beyond it."
She employs the same methods in a new class
this quarter, but in accordance with previous re
quests for more freedom, has allowed students to
manufacture their identities from scratch instead
of assigning them herself
Sheffer discussed a physics major who was
initially skeptical of the project.
"He compared the project to a problem set in
a math or science class where it's not just enough
to listen to the lecture, but you need to apply the
learning to specific situations," she said.
Associate mechanical engineering professor
Banny Banerjee, who teaches at Stanford's Insti
tute of Design, applies multidisciplinary "design
thinking" in the material he teaches. He de
scribed it as an innovative approach to large
problems that employ the "neural nets and parts
of our brain and cognitive systems that
we all have."

"What we've been doing is looking
at large-scale problems and having
very problem-centered curricula
where you put the challenge in the cen
ter, rather than the discipline, and then
bring in many different disciplines so
they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle,"
he said.
His students, who come from a
wide range of disciplines among
them environmental sciences, busi
ness, engineering and design tack
le a variety of issues, from creating
loans and savings programs for rural
women to helping the Chilean equiv
alent of Home Depot and becoming
more environmentally friendly.
All three professors also believe
in the widespread applicability of
their approaches.
According to Banerjee, it is the
ability of "design thinking" to tackle
a range of problems that makes it so
popular.
"A lot of our current ways of
thinking have been formed within
boundary conditions where these
weren't the kinds of challenges they
were trying to solve," he said. "And
meanwhile a lot of the large chal

lenges such as the sustainability issue
or the global inequity issue and so on
are highly integrated problems.
"The scale, the urgency and the
critical nature of these problems
make it such that we need to come
up with extremely creative solu
tions."
Koller argued for the cost-effec
tiveness of her methods, which could
be especially practical for financially
strained institutions, but may also
work well for introductory biology,
chemistry and physics at Stanford.
"The reason that it resonates so
well is that in those classes students
come in with very different back
grounds and levels of ability," she
said. "The nice thing about having a
much more flexible framework is
that allows you to teach classes in a
way that's not one-size-fits-all."
Biology professor Susan Mc-
Connell, who co-chairs the Study on
Undergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES), said publicizing the ef
fectiveness of innovative methods is
a major goal of the SUES agenda.
"What we are doing is trying to
learn about what works and enable
the different resources at Stanford
and communicate with the faculty so
that they can... adopt technologies
that are appropriate to their teaching
styles," she said.

scribed it as an innovative approach to large
problems that employ the "neural nets and parts
of our brain and cognitive systems that
we all have."

"What we've been doing is looking
at large-scale problems and having
very problem-centered curricula
where you put the challenge in the cen
ter, rather than the discipline, and then
bring in many different disciplines so
they fit together like a jigsaw puzzle,"
he said.
His students, who come from a
wide range of disciplines among
them environmental sciences, busi
ness, engineering and design tack
le a variety of issues, from creating
loans and savings programs for rural
women to helping the Chilean equiv
alent of Home Depot and becoming
more environmentally friendly.
All three professors also believe
in the widespread applicability of
their approaches.
According to Banerjee, it is the
ability of "design thinking" to tackle
a range of problems that makes it so
popular.
"A lot of our current ways of
thinking have been formed within
boundary conditions where these
weren't the kinds of challenges they
were trying to solve," he said. "And
meanwhile a lot of the large chal

lenges such as the sustainability issue
or the global inequity issue and so on
are highly integrated problems.
"The scale, the urgency and the
critical nature of these problems
make it such that we need to come
up with extremely creative solu
tions."
Koller argued for the cost-effec
tiveness of her methods, which could
be especially practical for financially
strained institutions, but may also
work well for introductory biology,
chemistry and physics at Stanford.
"The reason that it resonates so
well is that in those classes students
come in with very different back
grounds and levels of ability," she
said. "The nice thing about having a
much more flexible framework is
that allows you to teach classes in a
way that's not one-size-fits-all."
Biology professor Susan Mc-
Connell, who co-chairs the Study on
Undergraduate Education at Stan
ford (SUES), said publicizing the ef
fectiveness of innovative methods is
a major goal of the SUES agenda.
"What we are doing is trying to
learn about what works and enable
the different resources at Stanford
and communicate with the faculty so
that they can... adopt technologies
that are appropriate to their teaching
styles," she said.
