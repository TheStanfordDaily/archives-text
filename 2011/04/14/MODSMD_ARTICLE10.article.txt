## SEEING GREEN The 						Forest or the Trees 
### Holly Moeller 
I love wood. I love my mahogany
shelf, carried across the country
from a high school workshop to
my college dorm room, to grad
school in Boston and across the
country to Stanford. I love fires and
the firewood waiting patiently out
side my apartment for the next
camping trip.
But I also love forests.
It can be hard to reconcile these
loves, especially when driving
through Canadian logging country
as I did last summer (with my ma
hogany shelf in the trunk). Though
most clear-cuts are carefully tucked
back from the highway, I often
glimpsed stumps through the nar
row roadside band of remaining
trees.
By declaring 2011 the Interna
tional Year of the Forest, the United
Nations is challenging each of us (or
at least those of us who heard about
the declaration in the first place) to
weigh pyromania against pictur
esque views, to place furniture in its
forest context and to reconcile our
use of forest products (worth $325
billion annually) with the value of
untouched forest (which house 80
percent of terrestrial biodiversity).
Forests cover 31 percent of our
land area, and 1.6 billion people
make their livelihoods in them
(about a fifth of these people are in
forests). Each year we cut down 13
million hectares about one Cali
fornia-sized patch every three years.
Some of this loss is offset by tree
plantations (lately the poster chil
dren of the carbon credits market)
and forest re-growth, but in the last
decade we still lost about 200,000
square miles of forest. And that's
just what we can see with satellites:
uncountable acreage is affected by
selective logging, a hard-to-detect
precursor to all-out deforestation in
which a forest is gradually thinned.
Most of us associate deforesta
tion with the tropics. Indeed, that's
where most of it is happening, and
that's undoubtedly where one of the
U.N.'s spotlights will point this year.
But besides donating to "Save the
Rainforest" campaigns and shaking
our fingers at illegal loggers or cor
rupt governments, we must think
hard about the home front.
First this: United States citizens
make up 5 percent of the global pop
ulation, but consume 20 percent of
the world's timber. We're also the
third largest importer of tropical
lumber. (Of course, we also con
sume 25 percent of the world's ener
gy and emit 20 percent of the world's
carbon dioxide, so no surprises
there.)
Second, we do this even though
indeed, perhaps because —we
have a timber industry right in our
own backyard. We are a nation that
grew up on wood: from log cabins to
wood stoves to hardwood flooring.
Having outstripped our local re
source base, today we import trees
from the West and, in a globalized
world, from other countries. Mean
while, American forestry flounders
amid claims of sustainability and
bankruptcy.
As I drove through the Pacific
Northwest after crossing Canada,

the signs of the timber industry's
propaganda war began cropping up:
"Stand cut in 1992 Replanted in
1996;" "Timber dollars pay for
schools and healthcare." Some slo
gans even rhymed.
In a land still echoing with the
battle cries of the spotted owl wars,
the timber industry is busy repairing
its image as a job-providing steward
of the land. The latest set of sheep's
clothing is forest fire prevention:
supposedly, logging could thin out
biomass just waiting to produce cat
astrophic blazes in our national
forests. Of course, the biomass tim
ber companies' want comes from
solid, big trees the ones least like
ly to fuel such fires. So this is just an
other ploy to let timber companies
turn their chainsaws on public lands,
instead of working sustainably with
in the bounds of their own proper
ties.
Today, many companies are
propped up by government subsi
dies especially the sale of trees on
public land by the Forest Service,
Various bureaucratic bells and whis
tles mean that these sales actually
cost taxpayers hundreds of millions
of dollars each year, but they do pro
vide us with raw materials for our
(also subsidized) paper and timber
mills.
Can sustainable forestry exist in
America? Numerous green washers
(pick your favorite acronym from
FSC, SFI, ATFS and others) have
preached sound principles but failed
to honor them probably because
an extractive timber industry and an
intact forest ecosystem are funda
mentally incompatible.
Because trees take so long to
grow, there's constant pressure to
log more forests. We must curb de
mand to halt deforestation (vintage
furniture and recycled paper, any
one?) and harvest fresh supplies
only from tree plantations. These log
farms (which already exist in the
Southeastern U.S., Asia and South
America) will be just that: sources of
wood, not carbon sinks or hiking lo
cations or biodiversity enclaves.
Leave the intact forests for that.
We'll probably find ourselves
building more with faster-growing
species. We'll have to manage soil
quality and balance growth rates
with product performance. After all,
we don't want to poison more land
with pesticides or make California's
eucalyptus mistake again. Overall,
we'll have to dial back consumption.
But that's really what the Year of
the Forest is for, anyway: making us
hear the trees that fell to print this
newspaper. Asking us whether we
can have both wood and woods.

What wood would you weep without?

I love wood. I love my mahogany
shelf, carried across the country
from a high school workshop to
my college dorm room, to grad
school in Boston and across the
country to Stanford. I love fires and
the firewood waiting patiently out
side my apartment for the next
camping trip.
But I also love forests.
It can be hard to reconcile these
loves, especially when driving
through Canadian logging country
as I did last summer (with my ma
hogany shelf in the trunk). Though
most clear-cuts are carefully tucked
back from the highway, I often
glimpsed stumps through the nar
row roadside band of remaining
trees.
By declaring 2011 the Interna
tional Year of the Forest, the United
Nations is challenging each of us (or
at least those of us who heard about
the declaration in the first place) to
weigh pyromania against pictur
esque views, to place furniture in its
forest context and to reconcile our
use of forest products (worth $325
billion annually) with the value of
untouched forest (which house 80
percent of terrestrial biodiversity).
Forests cover 31 percent of our
land area, and 1.6 billion people
make their livelihoods in them
(about a fifth of these people are in
forests). Each year we cut down 13
million hectares about one Cali
fornia-sized patch every three years.
Some of this loss is offset by tree
plantations (lately the poster chil
dren of the carbon credits market)
and forest re-growth, but in the last
decade we still lost about 200,000
square miles of forest. And that's
just what we can see with satellites:
uncountable acreage is affected by
selective logging, a hard-to-detect
precursor to all-out deforestation in
which a forest is gradually thinned.
Most of us associate deforesta
tion with the tropics. Indeed, that's
where most of it is happening, and
that's undoubtedly where one of the
U.N.'s spotlights will point this year.
But besides donating to "Save the
Rainforest" campaigns and shaking
our fingers at illegal loggers or cor
rupt governments, we must think
hard about the home front.
First this: United States citizens
make up 5 percent of the global pop
ulation, but consume 20 percent of
the world's timber. We're also the
third largest importer of tropical
lumber. (Of course, we also con
sume 25 percent of the world's ener
gy and emit 20 percent of the world's
carbon dioxide, so no surprises
there.)
Second, we do this even though
indeed, perhaps because —we
have a timber industry right in our
own backyard. We are a nation that
grew up on wood: from log cabins to
wood stoves to hardwood flooring.
Having outstripped our local re
source base, today we import trees
from the West and, in a globalized
world, from other countries. Mean
while, American forestry flounders
amid claims of sustainability and
bankruptcy.
As I drove through the Pacific
Northwest after crossing Canada,

the signs of the timber industry's
propaganda war began cropping up:
"Stand cut in 1992 Replanted in
1996;" "Timber dollars pay for
schools and healthcare." Some slo
gans even rhymed.
In a land still echoing with the
battle cries of the spotted owl wars,
the timber industry is busy repairing
its image as a job-providing steward
of the land. The latest set of sheep's
clothing is forest fire prevention:
supposedly, logging could thin out
biomass just waiting to produce cat
astrophic blazes in our national
forests. Of course, the biomass tim
ber companies' want comes from
solid, big trees the ones least like
ly to fuel such fires. So this is just an
other ploy to let timber companies
turn their chainsaws on public lands,
instead of working sustainably with
in the bounds of their own proper
ties.
