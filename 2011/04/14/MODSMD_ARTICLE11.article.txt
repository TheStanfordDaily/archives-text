## Leaving My Feathers Behind My Struggle as a Stanford Swan 
### Sincerely, TAYLOR PAIGE WINFIELD '13 ASSU Chair of Health Wellness 
0 nee
1 was a swan.
Perfectly feathered & white.
Yet below the surface,
The water was churning
/Is I tried and tried to stay afloat
Until one day, enough was enough
One last desperate splash and
then silence.
I remember the day my feet
stopped paddling. It was fall of my
freshman year and I was drowning.
After 18 years of swimming to
wards a destination that was sup
pose to make me happy but really
just left me wanting more, I
stopped. I could no longer pretend
to be perfect. Behind my perfect
grades, smile and "white" feathers, I
was perfectly unhappy. I had lost all
joy in college life. I felt like I had
nothing left to give.
Sinking ... sinking ...
One day, I fell apart. My identity
and assumptions about life shat
tered around me, and I felt like I
could not pick up the pieces. They
say that creation comes from de
struction, but what happens when

you don't have the energy to build
yourself back up?
Deeper ... deeper...
Alone. I felt so alone. Yes, I was
surrounded by loving family and
friends. Yes, I had classes full of
eager peers to be my friends. But I
was terrified to let anyone know the
real me: how could any one imagine
that enthusiastic Taylor was falling
into depression? But I could no
longer pretend. So I let go.
Surrender.
I am struggling, I told my family.
I do not think I can do another
quarter. Please, please help me.
Rising ... rising ...
So I sought help. I began sharing
my feelings with a therapist and
later opened up with my friends.
CAPs, Bridge, YES+ and the Hap
piness course yes, I did them all. I
started meditating daily, practicing
yoga and writing in a joy and grati
tude journal every night. I took the
initiative in my own mental state,
but was never afraid to look for oth
ers for guidance.
Higher... higher...
As soon as I opened up, I realized
that I was not alone in my struggles.
We all suffer. We feel pain. All we
can do is try to break our own cycle
of suffering and not pretend that we
are separate from others.
After months of active efforts to
feel good, I noticed that I did not
have to paddle so hard to perform
well. Yes, I still struggle and have
hard days. I still fall down and feel
distress but now it is easier to
pick myself back up or at least be
comfortable with the uncertainty.
Bliss.
For me to find happiness, I had
to look deeply within myself. While
we do not always have control of
our emotions, we do have control
over how we choose to handle
them.
We do not have to be swans. We
do not have to pretend to be perfect
and in control. We do not need to be
afraid or embarrassed to seek out
the resources on campus or be hon
est with our peers. Even if you feel
alone right now, try to make an ef
fort to reach out to another. Who
knows, they might be feeling alone

as well.
We must allow ourselves to hon
estly and openly talk about how we
feel (both the good and the bad
emotions) and then take whatever
steps are necessary to feel better.
This is the first step to preventing
any of our classmates or ourselves
from sinking too low. Together we
have the skills and support to pull
ourselves up.
I hope that my experience may
resonate with you and help you see
that you are not alone in your per
sonal struggle. There is a communi
ty here at Stanford that cares
deeply about you and wants to help
you thrive in every way.
This week is Stanford's first an
nual De-Duck Yourself Week. The
ASSU and Health and Wellness
groups on campus hope to spark
conversations, recognition and pro
vide tools to help each of us not fall
prey or suffer from the all to com
mon "duck syndrome." I hope you
all will join me for activities
throughout the week to share your
feelings, replenish your body and
learn proactive skills to overcome
struggle and thrive at Stanford.
