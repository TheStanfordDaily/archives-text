## Leaving My Feathers Behind My Struggle as a Stanford Swan

1 was a swan.
Perfectly feathered & white.
Yet below the surface,
The water was churning
/Is I tried and tried to stay afloat
Until one day, enough was enough
One last desperate splash and
then silence.
I remember the day my feet
stopped paddling. It was fall of my
freshman year and I was drowning.
After 18 years of swimming to
wards a destination that was sup
pose to make me happy but really
just left me wanting more, I
stopped. I could no longer pretend
to be perfect. Behind my perfect
grades, smile and "white" feathers, I
was perfectly unhappy. I had lost all
joy in college life. I felt like I had
nothing left to give.
Sinking ... sinking ...
One day, I fell apart. My identity
and assumptions about life shat

could not pick up the pieces. They
say that creation comes from de

Deeper ... deeper...
Alone. I felt so alone. Yes, I was
surrounded by loving family and
friends. Yes, I had classes full of
eager peers to be my friends. But I
was terrified to let anyone know the
real me: how could any one imagine
that enthusiastic Taylor was falling
into depression? But I could no
longer pretend. So I let go.
Surrender.
I am struggling, I told my family.
I do not think I can do another
quarter. Please, please help me.
Rising ... rising ...
So I sought help. I began sharing
my feelings with a therapist and
later opened up with my friends.
CAPs, Bridge, YES+ and the Hap
piness course yes, I did them all. I
started meditating daily, practicing
yoga and writing in a joy and grati
tude journal every night. I took the
initiative in my own mental state,
but was never afraid to look for oth
ers for guidance.
Higher... higher...
As soon as I opened up, I realized
