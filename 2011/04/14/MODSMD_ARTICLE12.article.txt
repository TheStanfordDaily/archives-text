# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Tiger, You've Earned Stanford's Love 
### Shane Savitsky 
Will this spring break never
end? I never thought I'd
say it, but I might be ready
to write papers again. I'm told I'll be
doing plenty of that in Oxford. I can
only take so many days of lounging
around and catching up on 30 Rock
on Netflix before the days start to
blur together. Unfortunately, I did
n't have the ability to jet off to Eu
rope this weekend to stave off bore
dom. However, I had something
even better than excessive travel to
keep me busy: the Masters.
I know what you might be think
ing, so I'll just say it for you: "Hey,
Shane, golf is boring." Are you seri
ous? This tournament is the most
technologically keyed-in sporting
event in the world. It's how Stan
ford would run a major golf tourna
ment if one was held on campus
every year. The CBS/ESPN televi
sion coverage is limited to just four
minutes of commercials per hour.
The online coverage of the tourna
ment this year allowed you to fol
low a specific pairing of golfers,
focus on a specific hole or switch to
the live television coverage all
for free. Why does no other sporting
event do anything close to this awe
some? It's the 21st century. We
should be able to watch any live
event like this. You know, people
like to complain about wealth dis
parity in America, but those 300
members of Augusta National Golf
Club (who invariably own roughly
10 percent of this country's wealth)
know how to put on a damn good
golf tournament for fans.
Oh and then there was this year's
tournament itself. If you have ever
called golf boring, I hope you at
least caught a little bit of the final
round. This was pure entertain
ment. We got to watch the Rory

Mcllroy, the boy wonder from
Northern Ireland, absolutely im
plode under pressure after leading
the tournament for 54 holes. (Did
anyone else know there were cab
ins just 50 yards off the fairway on
the 10th until Rory's errant tee
shot?) We saw Charl Schwartzel
(who?) come out of nowhere to
grab the green jacket with one of
the most beautiful rounds of golf in
recent memory. But most impor
tantly, for a long stretch on the front
nine this past Sunday, we were all fi
nally able to see that Tiger Woods is
back.
I'm unabashed in my love for
Tiger Woods. I'm certain that I
wouldn't love the game of golf as
much as I do today if he didn't ab
solutely destroy the field at Augusta
in 1997 and send my little six-year
old brain spinning. I think a lot of
people around my age can agree.
He makes people care. He has this
certain aura about him that makes
anything seem possible on the golf
course. When Tiger made the turn
with a 31 on Sunday, most people
weren't thinking, "Oh my God,
there's almost ten golfers within
two strokes of the lead at the Mas
ters." No, they were thinking, "DID
YOU SEE WHAT TIGER JUST
DID?" That's a personal gift un
heard of in sports. No single athlete
can singlehandedly turn around an
entire sport like Tiger. No Kobe or
Lebron? The NBA would still exist.

No Tom Brady or Peyton? Life in
the NFL would still go on. Yet, if you
take Tiger away from the game of
golf, things don't seem to matter
quite as much anymore.
Unfortunately, golf did largely
lose Tiger for the past 16 months.
He's been around, but his play has
been a shell of what it used to be.
You can chalk that up to his new
swing or to his tumultuous personal
life, but the game has suffered with
his struggles. The public's respect
for Tiger crashed harder than his
Escalade when news of his infideli
ty broke two Thanksgivings ago.
The past year and a half couldn't
have been easy for Tiger, but this
past Sunday was the indication that
his greatness was still there. There
were no jeers; just Tiger tearing up
Augusta like the old days. He even
broke out the long-dormant fist
pump after his eagle on eight. He
may not have won the thing, but he
made you think he could. That's
what counts.
We at Stanford need to get be
hind Tiger. Like him or not, he's one
of us. I'm not saying that we should
condone or forgive any of his ac
tions, but as current occupants of
the alma mater he loves and re
spects, we should support him in his
path to rehabilitation. No one is
perfect, but you get the sense that
he really is trying to make up for
past wrongs. Still have a problem
with his personal life? Ignore it and
love his contribution to the game.
Just rewatch his approach on 15
from Sunday.Tiger is still the best of
the best and he's one of our own
here on the Farm.

If Tiger would like to thank Shane for
the support, he can always be reached
