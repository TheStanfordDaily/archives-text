## A 						Call for Action-Moving Beyond (but not away from) Dialogue 
### JENNA QUEENAN '11 President of Students Confronting Apartheid by Israel 
On Thursday night, Stanford students and faculty
will renew their campaign to encourage the Uni
versity to divest from particular companies
whose activities violate international law and abuse
human rights in Israel and the Occupied Territories.
This divestment campaign is part of a growing global,
grassroots and nonviolent movement that originated
from a call for divestment by Palestinian society in 2005
(represented by approximately 170 Palestinian NGOs)
and is supported by a diverse coalition of groups such as
U.S.-based Jewish Voice for Peace, Israel Boycott from
Within, the Presbyterian Church and the Academic
Union of Teachers in the United Kingdom. Many will
argue that this campaign prohibits dialogue and pres
ents only one side of a complex issue. I strongly believe,
however, that selective divestment campaigns such as
this one can and should promote productive dialogue
around the issue.
Simply calling for dialogue in the absence of concrete
action to end the ongoing conflict can, and often does,
contribute to the preservation of the status quo and the
false idea that the Israeli government and the Palestinian
people (and their representative bodies) are two equal
parties. In calling for dialogue, we must also recognize
that, institutionally, we are not neutral. Selective divest
ment encourages students and other members of the
Stanford community to consider the reality that institu
tions like our University that invest in companies that
profit from the occupation have already chosen, through
their investments, to take a side in this conflict.The Unit
ed States government, which gives around three billion
dollars in aid (much of which is military aid) to Israel an
nually, is yet another example of how we as Americans
are already complicit in the injustices that are occurring.
I am for dialogue, but only if that dialogue begins to
acknowledge the fact that Palestinians and Israelis do
not stand on equal ground. Consider the following facts
as examples: 400,000 Israel settlers currently live in over
120 illegal settlements in the West Bank (and 12 within
East Jerusalem), even though Article 49 of the Geneva
Convention clearly says, "the occupying power shall not
deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population
into the territory it occupies." 74 percent of the main

routes in the West Bank are controlled by approximate
ly 700 checkpoints, roadblocks and other barriers, where
Palestinians often have to wait for hours and must show
their identity cards to pass while Israeli settlers are let
through almost immediately. In a report given in 2009,
Amnesty International accused the Israeli government
of denying Palestinians access to adequate water by
maintaining complete control over the "shared" water
resources and pursuing discriminatory policies. Israelis
consume approximately 300 liters of water per day (this
includes the water for pools and lush lawns in the settle
ments), compared to Palestinian consumption, which av
erages around 70 liters (the World Health Organization
recommends at least 100 liters per day). Palestinians liv
ing in the Gaza Strip, who have lived under a crippling Is
raeli blockade since 2007, lack necessary medical equip
ment and building supplies to repair schools and homes
after Operation Cast Lead in 2008, not to mention the
high rates of poverty, unemployment and malnourish
ment that exist in Gaza. These statistics, of course, only
begin to tell the story and I encourage you to do your
own research and come to your own conclusions.
The concept of "dialogue as a solution" presupposes
that the primary problem in the Israeli Palestinian con
flict is misunderstanding and/or inability to compromise.
Unfortunately, the images we receive in the United
States of the situation in Israel/Palestine often portray
the conflict as stemming from some "ancient hatred" be
tween Arabs and Jews or a natural Palestinian proclivity
for terrorism. Too often, well-intentioned groups insist
that if we could just sit down and talk about it, we could
come up with productive solutions to the conflict togeth
er. Unfortunately, if this approach ignores the imbal
ances of power that currently exist in Israel/Palestine, it
is destined to fail. The movement for selective divest
ment here at Stanford calls on the University to not only
remove its complicity in human rights abuses (as its code
on investment responsibility states the it has an obliga
tion to do), but also asks Stanford students to critically
consider why dialogue around this issue is not enough.
