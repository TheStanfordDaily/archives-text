## MAN OF MANY TALENTS 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
He's the founder and Editor in
Chief of the Cardinal Principle. He's
double-majoring in math and eco
nomics. And he's writing his honors
thesis on how varying tax rates and
government expenditures affect in
centives and work output. All that
while being one of the most consis
tent performers on the men's tennis
team for four years.
It's safe to say that senior Greg
Hirschman has a lot to show for his
career on the Farm, and as his senior
year comes to a close, Hirschman
graciously offered to reflect on his
Stanford experience.
When I first sat down to talk to
Greg, he took the time to warn me
that if I didn't stop him, he could talk
forever. Indeed, we ended up talk
ing about numerous topics you
won't see reproduced here tennis
psychology, upper-level math cours
es, Peyton Manning and John Stuart
Mill to name a few but when it
came down to it, he narrowed down
his Stanford experience to a list of
three endeavors: playing tennis, div

ing into math and economics and
creating the Cardinal Principle.
Hirschman has a team-best 14-3
record in dual matches this season,
but tennis has meant much more to
him than just wins and losses.
"I couldn't imagine being a stu
dent at Stanford without tennis,"
Hirschman said. "The team is amaz
ing and tennis has become so in
grained in my life that it's one of the
big driving forces that gets me excit
ed every day about getting up. It's a
lot of work and it doesn't come easy,
but you can achieve so much outside
the classroom and mean something
extra to the university."
Hirschman has shown tremen
dous leadership both on the tennis
court and in the classroom. Conse
quently, he has been chosen to cap
tain the United States tennis team at
the World University Games
most aptly described as the
Olympics for collegiate athletes
around the world â€”in Shenzen,
China this summer.
Hirschman believes that the
games will provide an amazing way

Senior Greg Hirschman (above) has been a stalwart for the men's tennis
team in his time at Stanford, but he also boasts a diverse resume outside of
tennis, including pursuing a double major and founding a newspaper.
