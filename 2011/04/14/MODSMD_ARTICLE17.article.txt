## MAN OF MANY TALENTS 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
He's the founder and Editor in
Chief of the Cardinal Principle. He's
double-majoring in math and eco
nomics. And he's writing his honors
thesis on how varying tax rates and
government expenditures affect in
centives and work output. All that
while being one of the most consis
tent performers on the men's tennis
team for four years.
It's safe to say that senior Greg
Hirschman has a lot to show for his
career on the Farm, and as his senior
year comes to a close, Hirschman
graciously offered to reflect on his
Stanford experience.
When I first sat down to talk to
Greg, he took the time to warn me
that if I didn't stop him, he could talk
forever. Indeed, we ended up talk
ing about numerous topics you
won't see reproduced here tennis
psychology, upper-level math cours
es, Peyton Manning and John Stuart
Mill to name a few but when it
came down to it, he narrowed down
his Stanford experience to a list of
three endeavors: playing tennis, div

ing into math and economics and
creating the Cardinal Principle.
Hirschman has a team-best 14-3
record in dual matches this season,
but tennis has meant much more to
him than just wins and losses.
"I couldn't imagine being a stu
dent at Stanford without tennis,"
Hirschman said. "The team is amaz
ing and tennis has become so in
grained in my life that it's one of the
big driving forces that gets me excit
ed every day about getting up. It's a
lot of work and it doesn't come easy,
but you can achieve so much outside
the classroom and mean something
extra to the university."
Hirschman has shown tremen
dous leadership both on the tennis
court and in the classroom. Conse
quently, he has been chosen to cap
tain the United States tennis team at
the World University Games
most aptly described as the
Olympics for collegiate athletes
around the world —in Shenzen,
China this summer.
Hirschman believes that the
games will provide an amazing way

to culminate all of his hard work on
the tennis court, but will also pro
vide a transition into the new role
tennis will play in his future as a
way to continue to meet a diverse
array of people.
"One story I love is that my dad,
who didn't spend nearly as much
time playing competitive tennis as I
have, met both his boss and his wife
on the tennis court," Hirschman
said. "I've met some amazing peo
ple myself and even though my
livelihood won't be directly tied to
tennis, I'm sure it [will] always play a
big part in my life."
One such acquaintance that
Hirschman made through tennis is
ex-California State Controller and
Chief Financial Officer Steve West
ly. Westly, a prominent Democrat
who chaired Obama's 2008 presi
dential campaign in California, will
be featured in the next issue of the
Cardinal Principle alongside Con
doleezza Rice.
The fact that the Cardinal Princi
ple is now sponsoring debates be
tween such prominent political fig
ures is a testament to the amount of
time and energy Hirschman has

poured into the paper that didn't
even exist four years ago.
"I started the newspaper as a
freshman with the stated purpose to
print articles from any political
viewpoint to stimulate debate on
campus," Hirshman said. "It's a little
different from most newspapers,
which often either have a specific
political agenda or aren't politically
focused."
The paper usually features a
number of articles that provide
contrasting viewpoints on con
tentious issues. The front-page sto
ries this year have been "Exams, Al
cohol and Sex on Campus: Two
Views" and "The Second Amend
ment: Two Viewpoints." The paper
has tackled topics ranging from
IHUM to Wikileaks to how politi
cal parties abuse the English lan
guage.
Hirschman usually contributes a
number of articles himself to each
issue, as well as organizing the
paper and getting students across
campus to contribute.
Hirschman said the Cardinal
Principle lets his inner tennis player
shine through.
"When I write an article, I write
my article and then send it to some
one else to write a counter. They
can see my article, but I never get to
see their article until the paper's
published," Hirschman said. "I'm

basically saying, 'l'm going to beat
you hitting crosscourt forehands.
You know every forehand I hit is
going crosscourt, but I think I can
hit crosscourt forehands so well
that I'll beat you anyway.'"
"Who knows if I actually end up
winning, but I do get to develop a
very good crosscourt forehand,"
Hirschman added with a smile.
Hirschman's last issue as Editor
in Chief will be released in two
weeks.
All in all, Hirschman acknowl
edged just how much he has grown
while at Stanford.
"My experience at Stanford,
combining the math and economics
on the academic side, the newspa
per on the extracurricular side and
the tennis on the athletic side has
helped prepare me to be able to
control all the things I will have to
moving forward in my life,"
Hirschman said.
Hirschman will be attending the
London School of Finance and Pri
vate Equity next year, but will cer
tainly be missed here at Stanford.
Whether on the tennis court, in the
classrooms or at the printing press,
it's safe to say that Hirschman gave
everything to his endeavors on the
Farm.

to culminate all of his hard work on
the tennis court, but will also pro
vide a transition into the new role
tennis will play in his future as a
way to continue to meet a diverse
array of people.
"One story I love is that my dad,
who didn't spend nearly as much
time playing competitive tennis as I
have, met both his boss and his wife
on the tennis court," Hirschman
said. "I've met some amazing peo
ple myself and even though my
livelihood won't be directly tied to
tennis, I'm sure it [will] always play a
big part in my life."
One such acquaintance that
Hirschman made through tennis is
ex-California State Controller and
Chief Financial Officer Steve West
ly. Westly, a prominent Democrat
who chaired Obama's 2008 presi
dential campaign in California, will
be featured in the next issue of the
Cardinal Principle alongside Con
doleezza Rice.
The fact that the Cardinal Princi
ple is now sponsoring debates be
tween such prominent political fig
ures is a testament to the amount of
time and energy Hirschman has

poured into the paper that didn't
even exist four years ago.
"I started the newspaper as a
freshman with the stated purpose to
print articles from any political
viewpoint to stimulate debate on
campus," Hirshman said. "It's a little
different from most newspapers,
which often either have a specific
political agenda or aren't politically
focused."
The paper usually features a
number of articles that provide
contrasting viewpoints on con
tentious issues. The front-page sto
ries this year have been "Exams, Al
cohol and Sex on Campus: Two
Views" and "The Second Amend
ment: Two Viewpoints." The paper
has tackled topics ranging from
IHUM to Wikileaks to how politi
cal parties abuse the English lan
guage.
Hirschman usually contributes a
number of articles himself to each
issue, as well as organizing the
paper and getting students across
campus to contribute.
Hirschman said the Cardinal
Principle lets his inner tennis player
shine through.
"When I write an article, I write
my article and then send it to some
one else to write a counter. They
can see my article, but I never get to
see their article until the paper's
published," Hirschman said. "I'm

basically saying, 'l'm going to beat
you hitting crosscourt forehands.
You know every forehand I hit is
going crosscourt, but I think I can
hit crosscourt forehands so well
that I'll beat you anyway.'"
"Who knows if I actually end up
winning, but I do get to develop a
very good crosscourt forehand,"
Hirschman added with a smile.
Hirschman's last issue as Editor
in Chief will be released in two
weeks.
All in all, Hirschman acknowl
edged just how much he has grown
while at Stanford.
"My experience at Stanford,
combining the math and economics
on the academic side, the newspa
per on the extracurricular side and
the tennis on the athletic side has
helped prepare me to be able to
control all the things I will have to
moving forward in my life,"
Hirschman said.
Hirschman will be attending the
London School of Finance and Pri
vate Equity next year, but will cer
tainly be missed here at Stanford.
Whether on the tennis court, in the
classrooms or at the printing press,
it's safe to say that Hirschman gave
everything to his endeavors on the
Farm.

He's the founder and Editor in
Chief of the Cardinal Principle. He's
double-majoring in math and eco
nomics. And he's writing his honors
thesis on how varying tax rates and
government expenditures affect in
centives and work output. All that
while being one of the most consis
tent performers on the men's tennis
team for four years.
It's safe to say that senior Greg
Hirschman has a lot to show for his
career on the Farm, and as his senior
year comes to a close, Hirschman
graciously offered to reflect on his
Stanford experience.
When I first sat down to talk to
Greg, he took the time to warn me
that if I didn't stop him, he could talk
forever. Indeed, we ended up talk
ing about numerous topics you
won't see reproduced here tennis
psychology, upper-level math cours
es, Peyton Manning and John Stuart
Mill to name a few but when it
came down to it, he narrowed down
his Stanford experience to a list of
three endeavors: playing tennis, div

ing into math and economics and
creating the Cardinal Principle.
Hirschman has a team-best 14-3
record in dual matches this season,
but tennis has meant much more to
him than just wins and losses.
"I couldn't imagine being a stu
dent at Stanford without tennis,"
Hirschman said. "The team is amaz
ing and tennis has become so in
grained in my life that it's one of the
big driving forces that gets me excit
ed every day about getting up. It's a
lot of work and it doesn't come easy,
but you can achieve so much outside
the classroom and mean something
extra to the university."
Hirschman has shown tremen
dous leadership both on the tennis
court and in the classroom. Conse
quently, he has been chosen to cap
tain the United States tennis team at
the World University Games
most aptly described as the
Olympics for collegiate athletes
around the world —in Shenzen,
China this summer.
Hirschman believes that the
games will provide an amazing way
