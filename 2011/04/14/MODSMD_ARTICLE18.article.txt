# Violence between fans a troubling pattern
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
On March 31, the
Dodgers and Giants
played their season
opener at Dodger Sta
dium. Clayton Ker
shaw pitched a masterful game to help
the Dodgers take down the defending
champs, but few people remember the
actual game that day.
That's because after the game, a
42-year-old paramedic named Bryan
Stow was beaten by two Dodger fans
for wearing a Giants jersey to the
game. Stow remains in a medically in
duced coma after part of his skull was
removed to allow for brain swelling.
The uproar from around the league
and around the country has been
monumental, causing a number of dif
ferent people to be blamed and a
number of different actions to be
taken.
The most obvious perpetrators are
the two men who attacked Stow, but

they are still unidentified and the re
ward for information on their identi
ties and whereabouts keeps increas
ing. Beyond them, the next level of
blame was placed on the security
guards (or lack thereof) at Dodger
Stadium. Another reasonable step,
because the whole point of having se
curity at a baseball game is to stop this
exact kind of thing from happening.
The Dodgers organization has pub
licly addressed the issue and has im
plemented a stronger security pres
ence at games in order to protect
against a repeat offense.

These results seem logical, but in
today's world of in-your-face media
from every angle possible, there are
always people pushing the envelope.
In particular, John Steigerwald, a
columnist and former sports anchor
from Pennsylvania, wrote a column
for the Observer-Reporter about how
Stow brought the violence on himself
by wearing a Giants jersey to a
Dodger game.
The boldest (and most-quoted)
line of his piece was: "Maybe some
one can ask Snow [sic], if he ever
comes out of his coma, why he
thought it was a good idea to wear Gi
ants' gear to a Dodgers' home opener
when there was a history of out-of
control drunkenness and arrests at
that event going back several years."
If you have an ounce of compas
sion in your body or even an inkling of
common sense, this quote should
probably stir up some anger inside
you, not least because Steigerwald
couldn't bring himself to look up
Stow's actual name (the error has
since been corrected on the Observer-
Reporter's website, along with some
of the many other factual errors in the

story). This sentence was not an isolat
ed occurrence, either, as the rest of the
column goes on to blame adults for
wearing jerseys to games (something
Steigerwald believes is childish) and
how that leads to violence.
The column, which has been
ripped to shreds in the media since its
release on Sunday, has become well
known enough that Steigerwald
found the need to give a public "ex
planation" of his thinking. On his
blog, Steigerwald said that he didn't
blame Stow and that Stow didn't have
it coming to him, but that Steigerwald
was merely saying that Stow unwit
tingly contributed to the violence.The
blog appears to have been taken
down shortly afterward, but the story
is not going away from people's
minds.
While few people agree with
Steigerwald's take, there are differing
opinions on the problem of fan vio
lence and what can be done about it.
Fan violence is truly terrible and
should certainly be prevented as
much as possible, but in my opinion it
has sadly become part of the game. In
some sense, as Americans, we are not
nearly as accustomed to it as people in
other parts of the world. In China, a
fight over how tall a player was led to
the game being canceled and several
cars being destroyed.
Hardly anything can compare to

international soccer, though, in terms
of fan violence. In October, a qualify
ing match between Serbia and Italy
was stopped after seven minutes
when masked Serbian fans took over
parts of the stadium and threw flares
at the players on the field. Just a few
weeks ago, a fan was killed at an Ar
gentine match, becoming the 252 nd
victim of soccer-related violence in
Argentina alone since 1924.
Wikipedia has a 13,000-word article
just about soccer fan "hooliganism,"
and the problem has spread around
the globe.
All this is not to say that the Bryan
Stow incident is not a problem. Any
act of violence is a problem, and steps
should always be taken to assure fan
safety. But the sad fact is, when tens of
thousands of people are put in a small
area for hours, not to mention when
fierce competitiveness and alcohol
are mixed in, violence is an inevitable
consequence.
The root cause of fan violence and
the best way to minimize it are de
bates that will continue to rage for
years to come. Unfortunately, though,
the issue of fan violence is unlikely to
leave the sports world any time soon.

Jacob Jaffe is also glad there aren't
any more Disco Demolition Nights
at baseball games. Tell him why you
agree at jwjaffe@stanford.edu.

licly addressed the issue and has im
plemented a stronger security pres
ence at games in order to protect
against a repeat offense.

These results seem logical, but in
today's world of in-your-face media
from every angle possible, there are
always people pushing the envelope.
In particular, John Steigerwald, a
columnist and former sports anchor
from Pennsylvania, wrote a column
for the Observer-Reporter about how
Stow brought the violence on himself
by wearing a Giants jersey to a
Dodger game.
The boldest (and most-quoted)
line of his piece was: "Maybe some
one can ask Snow [sic], if he ever
comes out of his coma, why he
thought it was a good idea to wear Gi
ants' gear to a Dodgers' home opener
when there was a history of out-of
control drunkenness and arrests at
that event going back several years."
If you have an ounce of compas
sion in your body or even an inkling of
common sense, this quote should
probably stir up some anger inside
you, not least because Steigerwald
couldn't bring himself to look up
Stow's actual name (the error has
since been corrected on the Observer-
Reporter's website, along with some
of the many other factual errors in the

story). This sentence was not an isolat
ed occurrence, either, as the rest of the
column goes on to blame adults for
wearing jerseys to games (something
Steigerwald believes is childish) and
how that leads to violence.
The column, which has been
ripped to shreds in the media since its
release on Sunday, has become well
known enough that Steigerwald
found the need to give a public "ex
planation" of his thinking. On his
blog, Steigerwald said that he didn't
blame Stow and that Stow didn't have
it coming to him, but that Steigerwald
was merely saying that Stow unwit
tingly contributed to the violence.The
blog appears to have been taken
down shortly afterward, but the story
is not going away from people's
minds.
While few people agree with
Steigerwald's take, there are differing
opinions on the problem of fan vio
lence and what can be done about it.
Fan violence is truly terrible and
should certainly be prevented as
much as possible, but in my opinion it
has sadly become part of the game. In
some sense, as Americans, we are not
nearly as accustomed to it as people in
other parts of the world. In China, a
fight over how tall a player was led to
the game being canceled and several
cars being destroyed.
Hardly anything can compare to

international soccer, though, in terms
of fan violence. In October, a qualify
ing match between Serbia and Italy
was stopped after seven minutes
when masked Serbian fans took over
parts of the stadium and threw flares
at the players on the field. Just a few
weeks ago, a fan was killed at an Ar
gentine match, becoming the 252 nd
victim of soccer-related violence in
Argentina alone since 1924.
Wikipedia has a 13,000-word article
just about soccer fan "hooliganism,"
and the problem has spread around
the globe.
All this is not to say that the Bryan
Stow incident is not a problem. Any
act of violence is a problem, and steps
should always be taken to assure fan
safety. But the sad fact is, when tens of
thousands of people are put in a small
area for hours, not to mention when
fierce competitiveness and alcohol
are mixed in, violence is an inevitable
consequence.
The root cause of fan violence and
the best way to minimize it are de
bates that will continue to rage for
years to come. Unfortunately, though,
the issue of fan violence is unlikely to
leave the sports world any time soon.

Jacob Jaffe is also glad there aren't
any more Disco Demolition Nights
at baseball games. Tell him why you
