# Violence between fans a troubling pattern
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
On March 31, the
Dodgers and Giants
played their season
opener at Dodger Sta
dium. Clayton Ker
shaw pitched a masterful game to help
the Dodgers take down the defending
champs, but few people remember the
actual game that day.
That's because after the game, a
42-year-old paramedic named Bryan
Stow was beaten by two Dodger fans
for wearing a Giants jersey to the
game. Stow remains in a medically in
duced coma after part of his skull was
removed to allow for brain swelling.
The uproar from around the league
and around the country has been
monumental, causing a number of dif
ferent people to be blamed and a
number of different actions to be
taken.
The most obvious perpetrators are
the two men who attacked Stow, but

they are still unidentified and the re
ward for information on their identi
ties and whereabouts keeps increas
ing. Beyond them, the next level of
blame was placed on the security
guards (or lack thereof) at Dodger
Stadium. Another reasonable step,
because the whole point of having se
curity at a baseball game is to stop this
exact kind of thing from happening.
The Dodgers organization has pub
licly addressed the issue and has im
plemented a stronger security pres
ence at games in order to protect
against a repeat offense.
