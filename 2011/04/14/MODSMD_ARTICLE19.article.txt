# ONE FINAL TUNEUP
## Cardinal takes on St. Mary's 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Postponed from yesterday due
to rain, Thursday's match between
the No. 2 ranked Stanford women's
tennis team and the No. 40 Saint
Mary's Gaels will be the Cardinal's
final warm up before facing Cal this
weekend on the road.
The match will now take place at
3 p.m. at Taube Tennis Center, with
doubles likely to occur on the back
courts because the men's tennis
team will also be playing at that
time.
Heading into today's match
with Saint Mary's (11-7,9-0 WCC),
the conference-leading Cardinal
(21-0,7-0 Pac-10) is undefeated on
the season.
"We're really excited to get a
match in before we play Cal," said
senior Carolyn McVeigh. "[Cal] is
going to be a huge match because
they're one of those top-ranked
teams that always gives us a good
battle. We're also playing them for
the Pac-10 title. Saint Mary's will be
a good stepping stone tomorrow so
we are prepared for our match on
Saturday."
The Cardinal is the only remain
ing undefeated team in the nation,
but despite that fact, it dropped to
second in the most recent ITA
rankings.
The team has oscillated between
No. 1 and No. 2 due to perceived
strength of schedule. At No. 1 is the
University of Florida (21-1, 10-0
SEC), which the Cardinal defeated
4-2 in the championship of the Na
tional Team Indoor Champi
onships.

In Pac-10 play, Stanford has guar
anteed itself at least a share of the
Pac-10 title with a perfect 7-0 league
record. Cal, the Cardinal's final op
ponent of the regular season, is right
behind at 6-1 in league play and
could gain a share of the title if it up
sets Stanford this Saturday.
Even though the pressure is
mounting with the conference title

on the line, the Cardinal appears to
be in solid physical condition com
ing down this stretch run.
"Everyone's doing really well,"
said sophomore Mallory Burdette,
"I know Kristie [Ahn]'s foot is
bothering her a little bit. Other than
that, we're doing well injury-wise,
