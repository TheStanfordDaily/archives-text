# ONE FINAL TUNEUP
## Cardinal takes on St. Mary's 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Postponed from yesterday due
to rain, Thursday's match between
the No. 2 ranked Stanford women's
tennis team and the No. 40 Saint
Mary's Gaels will be the Cardinal's
final warm up before facing Cal this
weekend on the road.
The match will now take place at
3 p.m. at Taube Tennis Center, with
doubles likely to occur on the back
courts because the men's tennis
team will also be playing at that
time.
Heading into today's match
with Saint Mary's (11-7,9-0 WCC),
the conference-leading Cardinal
(21-0,7-0 Pac-10) is undefeated on
the season.
"We're really excited to get a
match in before we play Cal," said
senior Carolyn McVeigh. "[Cal] is
going to be a huge match because
they're one of those top-ranked
teams that always gives us a good
battle. We're also playing them for
the Pac-10 title. Saint Mary's will be
a good stepping stone tomorrow so
we are prepared for our match on
Saturday."
The Cardinal is the only remain
ing undefeated team in the nation,
but despite that fact, it dropped to
second in the most recent ITA
rankings.
The team has oscillated between
No. 1 and No. 2 due to perceived
strength of schedule. At No. 1 is the
University of Florida (21-1, 10-0
SEC), which the Cardinal defeated
4-2 in the championship of the Na
tional Team Indoor Champi
onships.

In Pac-10 play, Stanford has guar
anteed itself at least a share of the
Pac-10 title with a perfect 7-0 league
record. Cal, the Cardinal's final op
ponent of the regular season, is right
behind at 6-1 in league play and
could gain a share of the title if it up
sets Stanford this Saturday.
Even though the pressure is
mounting with the conference title

on the line, the Cardinal appears to
be in solid physical condition com
ing down this stretch run.
"Everyone's doing really well,"
said sophomore Mallory Burdette,
"I know Kristie [Ahn]'s foot is
bothering her a little bit. Other than
that, we're doing well injury-wise,

also plays Cal on Saturday for a chance to capture the Pac-10 title.
which coming into the last part of
the season is a really good thing. I
think everybody else is pushing
right now to try and improve every
bit that we can leading up to
NCAAs physically and technical
ly"
Before that happens, the Cardi
nal must fight through the Gaels,
who are undefeated in WCC play.
At the top of their lineup is Alex
Poorta, the No. 49 player in the na
tion, who has amassed an 11-6
record this season. At the No. 2 spot
is usually Catherine Isip, who
comes in with a 13-3 record. Jenny
Jullien is one more player to look
out for, as she is undefeated when
playing at the four or five spot.
"They're a scrappy bunch,"
McVeigh said. "They have a lot of
great athletes and get a lot of balls
back. It's a great opportunity for us
to make sure our games are honed
in for Saturday and to make sure
we're match tough for the weekend
match."
Players typically use the few
matches left at the end of the regu
lar season to work on specific tech
nical issues in the hopes that they
can smooth them out before the
postseason hits.
"Whether you're playing Cal or
Saint Mary's, you're working on
specific things, even during match
es, that need to improve," Burdette
said. "I feel like at this point in the
season, we're so building up toward
NCAAs that every match is impor
tant. It's a place you can work on
whatever you need to work on."
Often, these things are small
technical issues or, as in Burdette's
case, mental changes.
"One of the biggest things that I
need to work on is staying positive
out there on the court and then also
making quick adjustments," Bur
dette said. "Especially after I'll win
the first set, in the second set I'll
start to make a few more errors. I
need to recognize that fact, stay
positive and make quicker adjust
ments in order to figure it out."
The Cardinal plays today at 3
p.m. at Taube Tennis Stadium and
12 p.m. Saturday at Cal.
