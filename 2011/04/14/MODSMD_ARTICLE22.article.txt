## Softball tries to stay hot against Oregon State 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford Softball team will try to continue its
winning ways against the Oregon State Beavers this
weekend on the Farm after securing a series win against
UCLA down in Los Angeles last weekend.
After falling 6-5 in 14 innings in Friday's game, the
No. 22 Cardinal rallied to win the final two games of the
weekend by scores of 6-2 and 5-1 to take two of three
from the Bruins, the defending national champions.
The Cardinal was swept in its first Pac-10 series of
the year against Arizona, so a strong weekend against
the beavers could get Stanford back to .500 in confer
ence.
In an odd twist of the schedule, the Beavers have
also faced off against Arizona and UCLA so far this
Pac-10 season.The Bruins trounced Oregon State down
in Los Angeles, easily sweeping away the Beavers, and
Arizona took two of three from Oregon State.
The Cardinal can once again expect to lean on soph
omore pitcher Teagan Gerhart and junior shortstop
Ashley Hansen, who were named Pac-10 pitcher and
player of the week after last week's performance
against the Bruins.
Hansen paced the Cardinal offense with a .615 bat
ting average that included two doubles, three RBI, two
runs scored and two stolen bases. She posted a .769 slug
ging percentage and a .600 on-base percentage on the
weekend as well.
Gerhart threw 21.1 innings against the Bruins, post
ing a 1.97 ERA while striking out 20 UCLA hitters and
giving up just six runs.
The Cardinal and Beavers set off in the first game of
a three-game series on Friday at 7 p.m. at Smith Family
Stadium.
