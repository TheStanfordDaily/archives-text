Stanford junior shortstop Ashley Hansen was selected
as one of the 25 finalists for USA Softball's Collegiate
Player of the Year award on Wednesday.
The award, presented by the Amateur Softball Associ
ation of America and considered one of the most pres
tigious honors in collegiate Softball, is designed to rec
ognize outstanding athletic achievement by collegiate
Softball players across the country. The 25 finalists an
nounced Wednesday are the only players remaining in
contention for the 2011 award.
Hansen currently leads the country with a .541 batting
average, ranks first in the Pac-10 in on-base percentage
(.604) and doubles (19) and is second in the conference
with 59 hits, a .908 slugging percentage and three triples.
The Chandler, Ariz, native is a two-time all conference
selection and was an All-American as a freshman, but
her impressive hitting this season puts her on pace for
her best season yet a particularly impressive feat
considering her .337 batting average last year and her
.400 batting average as a freshman.
The finalists for the Player of the Year award will be
narrowed down to ten on May 11, and the three finalists
will be announced May 25 at the Women's College
World Series in Oklahoma City.
