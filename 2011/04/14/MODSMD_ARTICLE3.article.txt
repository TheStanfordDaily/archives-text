more than 700 applicants. In an
email to The Daily, Associate Dean

"wouldn't be surprised to see the
total number [of] themed pre-as

pre-assigned in the 2010-2011
process. Official numbers for this
year will be released at the end of the

"The total number of theme
houses Focus Houses, Academic
Theme Houses, Ethnic Theme
Houses has fluctuated over the
last 10 years but has not increased
significantly in recent years,"
Boswell said.
In fact, there are fewer themed
residences now compared to five
years ago. But Boswell remains con
fident about the newest academic
theme dorms EAST House (Ed
ucation and Society), Crothers Hall
(Global Citizenship), Kimball Hall
(the Arts and Performing Arts and
Adelfa (Writing). He said these
houses as are "all gearing up for
their third years in existence."
Students who pre-assign are usu
ally required to use either their sec
ond or third tier housing options; if
selected, they do not participate in
the draw. Applications include an
essay, and for co-ops, participation in
a chore at the house.
Themed houses planned various
events this year to show students
what life in their house is like, includ
ing tables in White Plaza, open hous
es and Co-op Crawl.
