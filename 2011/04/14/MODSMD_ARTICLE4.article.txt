# Hennessy ranks 11th
## Data shows president as one of the highest paid university leaders 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Students stressed by the $50,000 plus required to at
tend Stanford may be surprised to learn that President
John Hennessy makes over 14 times that amount each
year in base salary alone.
For the fiscal year from September 1,2008

to August 31, 2009, Hennessy made
$702,711 in base salary according to
public tax documents. The
numbers for more re
cent years, however, remain
unknown.
'As part of long-term prac
tice, the University does
n't discuss the salary of any
individual employee, including the
president," wrote Jeff Wachtel, sen
ior assistant to President Hennessy,
in an email to The Daily.
The Stanford-specific -
numbers come from Form
990, a federal tax document re
quired of certain tax-exempt
entities. For the fiscal year 2008- .
2009, Stanford's 990 lists Hen
nessy's pay as "reportable compen
sation from the organization" and an

additional $338,818 in "estimated amount of other com
pensation from the organization and related organiza
tions."This is an increase over his base salary of $697,475
in 2008-07 and $667,440 in 2006-07.
The President is selected and hired by the Universi
ty's Board of Trustees, which also pays his salary.
However high that number might seem especially
in a still-recovering economy it is not completely dis
parate from Stanford's peer institutions. According to a
recent investigation by the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, America's top-earning public university president
for 2009-10 was Ohio State's E. Gordon Gee, who col
lected a base salary of $802,125.
Stanford, along with other private institutions, is not
yet obligated to release data from the 2009-10 fiscal year,
but a list using public school data from 2009-10 and pri
vate school data from 2008-09 puts President Hen
nessy's salary at 11th highest in the country.
Hennessy's salary also compares to that of
University of California President Mark Yudof,
whose base pay for 2009-10 was $600,000.
The UC system calculates the salaries for
Yudof as well as each campus's individual
: chancellor and measured it against "compa
• rable positions" at 26 other universities
■ among them, 14 public schools and 12 pri
* vate. It gives special weight to eight: Stan-
