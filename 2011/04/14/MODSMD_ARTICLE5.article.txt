## CPRN replies to radio sale concerns The 						USC-owned station contradicts KZSU critiques 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
The Classical Public Radio Net
work (CPRN), a radio station pri
marily owned by the University of
Southern California, recently
elicited concern among Stanford's
KZSU staff when it purchased
KUSF from the University of San
Francisco. The Cardinal station
feared the possibility that Stan
ford's radio station could be next
on CPRN's list a worry that
CPRN executive director Brenda
Barnes said is unnecessary.
"We do want to buy a North Bay
radio station, but we haven't been
looking at the Stanford station,"

Barnes said. "I doubt Stanford
wants to sell the station. We don't
want to take a station away from
someone who doesn't want to sell."
Barnes revealed that although
KUSF was owned by USF, most of
the students at USF were unaware
that the university even had a radio
station. In fact, only 10 percent of
those working at KUSF were stu
dents. The majority of employees

were Bay Area volunteers, a signif
icant difference between KUSF
and KZSU, which is almost entirely
student-run.
KZSU management discussed
concerns about Stanford being sold
without the knowledge of its em
ployees in an interview with The
Daily last week. These sentiments

The Classical Public Radio Network argued that its purchase of the KUSF
station aimed to preserve classical music in the airwaves. The network's
claim runs counter to previous worries raised by Stanford's KZSU.
largely stemmed from the way in
which negotiations took place be
tween USF and CPRN. According
to KZSU publicity director Adam
Pearson, the exchange was secretive
and was not made public until the
decision to sell the radio station had
been finalized; Barnes confirmed
this statement.
"It's true that no one knew about
it until we made the announce
ment," Barnes said. "When radio
stations are sold, most of the time
this is done under a non-disclosure
agreement. The reason for that is
that you don't know that you have a
deal until you have a written asset of
the agreement."
Barnes claimed that the decision
to sell the radio station was made
the Friday, Jan. 14, and was an
nounced the following Tuesday.
Although KZSU told The Daily
last week that CPRN's acquisition
of KUSF would be used as a guise
for USC recruitment, Barnes insist
ed that CPRN's purchase of KUSF
was primarily motivated by a gen
uine desire to preserve classical
music. Prior to CPRN's purchase of
KUSF, there was only one classical
radio station in the Bay Area,
Barnes said.
"The Bay Area is an important
cultural center not only for Califor
nia but for the country," Barnes
said. "In this case, the interests of
KUSC and USC converge because
USC has a lot of alumni and
prospective students and parents
and they wanted to have a bigger
presence in the Bay Area, but I
wanted to be certain that the Bay
Area had a strong classical music
station."
Among the concerns related to
CPRN's recent acquisition of

KUSF is the decision to move the
transmitter to a different location,
limiting KZSU's range, including its
access to the East Bay. But Barnes
asserted that CPRN's signal would
not interfere with the signals or
ranges of other stations in the area.
She said CPRN would not have an
impact on Stanford's protected cov
erage area.
"We will be moving the transmit
ter to Marin County further away
from the Stanford station," Barnes
said. "The furthest south people are
going to be able to hear our station
is the airport and at the airport it's
going to die off. You won't be able to
hear in San Mateo so there's no way
it's going to get to Palo Alto, our sig
nal will not get that far."
In spite of the controversy re
garding CPRN's recent purchase of
KUSF, Barnes said she is a strong
advocate for the importance of col
lege radio.
"I actually am not only a fan but
have helped found two different
stations in my career," she added. "I
don't want to see college stations be
diminished. I think they serve an im
portant function and are such a
wonderful opportunity for students
to become involved in the media."
