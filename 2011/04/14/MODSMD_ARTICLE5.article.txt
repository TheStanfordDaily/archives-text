## CPRN replies to radio sale concerns The
						USC-owned station contradicts KZSU critiques 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
The Classical Public Radio Net
work (CPRN), a radio station pri
marily owned by the University of
Southern California, recently
elicited concern among Stanford's
KZSU staff when it purchased
KUSF from the University of San
Francisco. The Cardinal station
feared the possibility that Stan
ford's radio station could be next
on CPRN's list a worry that
CPRN executive director Brenda
Barnes said is unnecessary.
"We do want to buy a North Bay
radio station, but we haven't been
looking at the Stanford station,"

Barnes said. "I doubt Stanford
wants to sell the station. We don't
want to take a station away from
someone who doesn't want to sell."
Barnes revealed that although
KUSF was owned by USF, most of
the students at USF were unaware
that the university even had a radio
station. In fact, only 10 percent of
those working at KUSF were stu
dents. The majority of employees

were Bay Area volunteers, a signif
icant difference between KUSF
and KZSU, which is almost entirely
student-run.
KZSU management discussed
concerns about Stanford being sold
without the knowledge of its em
ployees in an interview with The
Daily last week. These sentiments

The Classical Public Radio Network argued that its purchase of the KUSF
station aimed to preserve classical music in the airwaves. The network's
claim runs counter to previous worries raised by Stanford's KZSU.
