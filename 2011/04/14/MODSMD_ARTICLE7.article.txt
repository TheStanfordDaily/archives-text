## Special fees increase more than 2 percent 
### ELLORA ISRANI STAFF WRITER 
The first set of numbers puts the increase in special
fees for the 2011-12 academic year at 2.06 percent. All
but three groups The Claw magazine, Stanford
Chaparral and FLiCKS were approved for special
fees this election season, putting the number for next
year at $1,869,907.31. Last year's special fees totals
stood at $1,831,317.23.
However, only a minority of the student population
knows the ins and outs of the special fees system. The
process began during winter quarter, when each Volun
tary Student Organization (VSO) submitted an appli
cation to the ASSU with its proposed budget and re
quest for special fees.
According to Ryan Peacock, ASSU executive chair
of Graduate Affairs, the ASSU Appropriations Com
mittee and GSC Funding Committee "do a long
marathon session where they go through all the pro
posed budgets, make suggestions, tweak, make sure
they're within all of the requirements and then that
goes to a vote of all of the relevant legislative body."
"The catch is that's only if you're increasing 10 per-
cent plus inflation," he said. "You
can petition the student body and
get whatever increase above 10 per
cent."
Who the "relevant legislative
body" is depends on whether that
particular VSO serves the under
graduate student, graduate student
body or both.
Student approval of VSO budg
ets is the first in what ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Stephen
Trusheim 'l3 outlines as a multistep
process. The University will now
begin to review all approved budg
ets to ensure that they are exe
cutable,
"The University cannot collect
fees for partisan political activities,
for instance, because it is a nonprof
it," Trusheim wrote in an email to
The Daily.
The ASSU financial manager

then determines what the "student
activities fee" will be for the next
academic year, a fee that covers
both special and general fees.
"General fees groups are just
groups that go to the weekly GSC
or Senate meetings and request
smaller amounts of money to get
voted on," Peacock said. "The spe
cial fees groups, because they've
been essentially approved by the
student body in a general election,
are essentially guaranteed their
money.
"For general fees you're given
money for a special event and if you
don't spend that money it's taken
back at the end of the year."
That fee is collected on a quar
terly basis. Once Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) receives these
funds from the University, it direct
ly transfers the lump sum to each
VSO's account at the beginning of
the school year.
"SSE administers all the fi
nances for the student groups, so
once those fees come in we'll trans
fer them to fund the accounts of the

special fees groups," said graduate
student Raj Bhandari, ASSU finan
cial manager.
The per-student increase in spe
cial fees next year has yet to be de
termined, as it will depend on the
number of students actually en
rolled come autumn quarter.
However straightforward the
process may seem, the avalanche of
paperwork and tight restrictions
have been a source of discontent for
many VSO financial managers.
"A lot of financial officers do
complain about how difficult it is in
terms of rules and restrictions, but
at the end of the day, my personal
opinion on this is that... special
fees is a privilege, not a right," Pea
cock said.
"Going along with that privilege
you have to show sufficient respon
sibility," he added. "When your
funds are in the thousands of dol
lars, there is a process you have to
go through."
