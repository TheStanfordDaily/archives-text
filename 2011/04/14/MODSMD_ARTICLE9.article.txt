## Rushing to bid day 
### HELEN ANDERSON DESK EDITOR 
Waiting in line on a landing
in Old Union, I try to re
member if my last name
has ever caused me this
much anxiety. I have no
reason to be nervous, but as the girls be
hind me fidget or stare vacantly at the el
evator or make small talk about each oth
ers' shoes and the ASSU elections, it be
comes difficult not to succumb to the pal
pable tension.
My surname has sentenced me to the
role of unwilling trailblazer: "Face the
doors," I am told. "Come on, smile! Are
you all in alphabetical order? Okay, in
these last couple minutes, we need you to
be silent." Through the crack in the poker
faced double doors, flashes of neon dart
back and forth.
It is Friday, the first night of Rush, and
I have no idea what to expect. The doors
swing open and the half-sung, half-shout
ed chorus of a song whose lyrics are pep
pered with Greek letters overpowers us. I
step tentatively into the room, where a
walkway has been formed between two
lines of dancing, rally-clad girls. During
my split second of hesitation, a hand
blindsides me and grabs my elbow. Before
I can fully process what is happening, one
of the singing girls is escorting me down
the walkway. Not knowing what else to
do, I smile like a debutante.
Once the song is over, the Theta who
just had her elbow hooked in mine turns
to face me, introduces herself, introduces
me (byway of my own name tag) and ver
bally notes my hometown. Then the bar
rage of questions begins: Where are you
living? Do you know what you want to
major in? What did you do over spring
break? What activities do you do on cam
pus?
The room is obscenely loud I must
ask her to repeat things over and over
again, and I feel my vocal cords straining,
not really sure if sound is coming out. Sim
ple answers are best. If you can talk a long
time about shallow things, more power to
you. It's much too loud to articulate or
comprehend anything nuanced or compli
cated.
Out of necessity, our faces are too close
for comfort, limiting my scope of vision.
So when another girl approaches us, it

seems that she has emerged from thin air.
The two sorority sisters hug and gush
greetings at each other, engaging in a trad
ing-places ritual that I will soon realize
follows a predictable script.
"This is one of my best friends, X; X,
this is Helen. We were just talking about
how she does Y. It was great meeting you,
Helen! I'll let the two of you continue our
conversation." And she disappears.
After several rounds of this includ
ing an intermission in which we watch a
film made by the sorority that, almost
without fail, includes a rendition of "Black
and Yellow" with said sorority's colors
subbed in the singing/shouting begins
again and we are herded toward the door,
waving little goodbyes to whichever sister
we were last chatting with.
Our Rho Gammas (Recruitment
Guides) meet us outside, where they warn
us that it is of the utmost importance that
we not discuss the parties with each other
("We want you to make the decision that's
right for you .") and remind us that if we
still have our cell phones on us, we must
hand them over right away.
Then they usher us to the next party.
(The word "party" is misleading, "inter
view" being slightly more accurate, but
still not quite on the mark.) Many girls,
wearing high heels and short summer
dresses in the cold evening, are shivering
as we wait in line again.
This is a world where beauty trumps
comfort and great lengths are undergone
to achieve this beauty: indirectly, I hear
tales of one girl whose mother comes to
her dorm every day before Rush to do her
hair and makeup. I notice that the girl next
to me has her nails painted alternating
pastel shades of pink, teal and lavender,
which coordinate precisely with the colors
in her top, and I wonder if she will have
changed them by tomorrow.
The ritual repeats for each of the seven
sororities, almost exactly the same every
time: alphabetical order, the checking and
rechecking of the roster, the Rho Gamma
slipping the list through the door, waiting,
our entrance, the elbow grab, the girl-flirt
ing. I have the same conversation so many
times that I lose track of whether I've told
the current girl about my a cappella group
yet. I find myself mirroring her her

mannerisms, the pitch of her voice in a
subconscious attempt to make a good im
pression.
My cheekbones become sore from
constant smiling. Between parties, the
girls in my group bond over simple things
our freezing limbs, hunger, fading voic
es, Rebecca Black's "Friday," a mutual
love of butterscotch candy.
While waiting to go to our last party of
the night, the girl standing next to me says,
"I want to tell them to just cut the bullshit;
bring on the real questions." She recounts
that, during absentee night, one sorority
girl asked her if she would rather give up
cheese or oral sex for the rest of her life.
So I enter the second night anticipating
a greater challenge. But I am disappoint
ed I continue to have the same trivial
conversations as before.
Earlier, while we waited for the Day
Two parties to begin, we all convened on
the second floor of Tresidder as a Rho
Gamma with a megaphone repeated the
rules to us. If we were late to even a single
party, she warned, we would be with
drawn from Formal Recruitment entirely.
This was serious business.
We are given the list of parties that we
will be attending. Flaving long ago chosen
to disregard the don't-discuss-the-sorori
ties-with-your-friends rule, my friends
and I compare lists. Some are dejected be
cause they weren't asked back to the
sororities they liked the most. I try to com
fort them by pointing out the randomness
of the process you only get to talk to a
few girls from each sorority anyway, and
who's to say if you'll hit it off with them?
They move past their disappointment,
deciding that they probably wouldn't
have fit in at those sororities anyway. Oth
ers are not so stoic I hear about girls
breaking down into tears when they see
their night's party list, although I don't
bear witness to this myself.
Saturday is Skit Night. I begin to notice
patterns in the way the girls tell you about
their sororities. We aren't the stereotypi
cal sorority, I hear from sorority sisters in
party after party. Most of them didn't
think they even wanted to go Greek, but
then they met these wonderful, genuine
girls and the rest is history.
"So we're a sorority," shrugs an AEPhi.

"It happens." Still, their skits never fail to
revel in the sorority stereotypes: each
group brags that they party the hardest,
that all the frat boys want to get with
them. One of my friends comes back from
the Kappa party and says, "They were ba
sically stripping!"
I begin to gain slight insights into the
mechanics of the process. During a Pi
Phi party, I notice a handful of Pi Phis
conversing with each other in my pe
ripheral vision. One of them breaks off
from the huddle and approaches the sis
ter I am talking to and me. They perform
their choreographed swap, and as the
new girl asks me how I became interest
ed in swing dancing, the old one takes
her place in the cluster of Pi Phis. I can
only guess that she must be reporting
back about me.
Later on, my friends and I speculate
about the orchestration of the parties. Are
the girls assigned to come up to you in a
predetermined order? Do they have some
sort of secret distress signal to indicate
when they want another girl to swoop in
and take over? On the third night, an
AEPhi will tell me that, after the parties,
each sister ranks the girl(s) they talked to
on a scale from 1 to 7. It is done similarly
at most sororities, she says.
A few days later, as my friends' Face
book walls overflow with "WELCOME
TO TRIDELT!"s and "So happy you're a
Chi 0!"s, I pause to reflect on this phe
nomenon of American culture.
What makes girls so willing to jump
through hoops to join these organiza
tions? Is it the thrill of exclusivity? The
stability of an automatic group of friends?
I think back to something one of my fel
low A-namers said while we stood next to
each other in front of yet another closed
door, the same girl who declared that
there was no contest: she would easily give
up oral sex if it meant she wouldn't have
to pass up the cheese tray.
"We get to judge them too," she had
said, mildly gleeful, referring to the
process of indicating our sorority prefer
ences at the end of the night. "It's a two
way street."
