## Report finds some Stanford doctors leave citing lack of support 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Many doctors who leave Stan
ford are moving to comparable in
stitutions and not to community
clinics or purely research-oriented
careers, according to a study by the
Clayman Institute for Gender Re
search. The study, conducted by sur
gery professor and Clayman re
search fellow Sherry Wren, was
prompted in part by the fact that
many physician scientists had left
Stanford.

Wren's initial hypothesis was
that more female doctors were
leaving their current jobs than male
doctors because the medical field is
particularly hard on women. The
data from her survey of faculty who
left between 1999 and 2009, howev
er, suggests that the gender differ
ence is small.

Gender did matter, however,
when it came to doctors' perception
of how much support they were re
ceiving in the workplace. Many of
the female respondents said they felt
they had less mentoring, protected
research time and flexibility to ac
commodate new interests at Stan
ford. Some respondents claimed
that they had little time for anything
but clinical work, and their new insti
tutions provided better opportuni
ties in those areas.

Women, most of whom were as
sistant professors, left after an aver
age of five years compared to men's
seven years. Approximately 42 per
cent of School of Medicine assistant
professors are women and 22 per
cent are full professors.
In light of this data, Wren called
for better career mentoring in order
to improve faculty retention and re
cruitment.

Although the study covers nearly
a decade, only half of those doctors
responded to Wren's questionnaire,
making the data set too small for her
to make broad generalizations. She
and her team plan to eventually ex
pand the survey throughout the
University and to other medical
schools.
