### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
The new McMurtry Building for
the arts took a step forward with the
University's announcement yester
day that the New York architectural
firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro would
design the building.
The structure will be built in
Stanford's Arts District, next to the
Cantor Arts Center, where it will
house the Art and Architecture Li
brary. It will also include gallery
space for student works, studios,
classrooms and screening spaces.
Burt McMurtry M.S. '59, Ph.D.
'62 and his wife Deedee provided
the $3O million naming gift for the
new building. It will bring together
under one roof the department of
art and art history's programs in art
practice, design, art history, film and
media studies and documentary
film.
"By bringing together all our vi
sual arts programs in close proximi
ty to the Cantor Arts Center, the Mc-
Murtry Building will promote the
kind of exchange that sparks creativ
ity and innovation," said Art and Art
History Professor Nancy Troy in an
interview with the Stanford Report.
The McMurtry building is under
the wing of the greater Stanford Arts
Initiative, which was launched in
2006. Part of its mission is to create
and endow new arts facilities, faculty
positions, graduate fellowships and
programs that encourage interdisci
plinary collaboration in the arts.
Among its other projects is the Bing
Concert Hall, a performance venue
officials expect to open in winter
2013.
