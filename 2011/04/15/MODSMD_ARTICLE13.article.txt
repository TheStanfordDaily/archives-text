## EDITORIAL Freeing Tantalus: Time To Fix Entrepreneurship 
### 
Stanford's ties to Silicon Valley
have made it synonymous
with entrepreneurship. The
university carefully cultivates its
image as an estuary for new com
panies. The names of some of our
most notable alumni Yang,
Hewlett, Packard are fixtures
on both our campus and in the en
trepreneurial world. Stanford's
reputation as a center of innova
tion affords the university enor
mous prestige, as well as high qual
ity applicants and faculty. Yet, de
spite the obvious benefit the Uni
versity receives from successful
and entrepreneurial alumni, Stan
ford gives very little practical sup
port to the students who wish to
follow in the footsteps of our most
famous graduates.
Founding a company is a
process that is arguably far more
involved than any typical job
search. A prospective founder re
quires a competent and diversely
talented team, financing, mentor
ship, extensive legal support and, of
course, an innovative idea. To se
cure financing and mentorship, the
founder should be practiced at net
working, making a pitch and devel
oping a feasible business model.
Compared with a typical job
search, in which one practices how
to interview for 1-2 different indus
tries, a would-be-entrepreneur
must master the science of his or
her chosen business, as well as learn
how to speak with venture capital
ists, academics, future employees,
boards of directors and lawyers. In
addition to these hurdles, there are
significant legal fees and bureau
cratic obstacles associated with in
corporation that the typical Stan
ford student is not prepared to han
dle.

while only one-third is split among
inventors. The effect of these poli
cies is to drive away top researchers
and inventors to other labs or cause
them to abandon private sector
work.
Stanford students who wish to
pursue entrepreneurship gain from
the university only peripherally, by
engaging with like-minded faculty
and peers, by proximity to Silicon
Valley, or by working with student
groups like BASES, the GSB En
trepreneur Club, Stanford Venture
Capital Club, or Stanford Women
in Business. Groups like these help
sponsor events and seminars like
Entrepreneurship Week and En
trepreneurial Thought Leaders.
Though valuable, these resources
do not compare to the support of
fered to students pursuing typical
career paths. University-funded
entrepreneurial education through
the Stanford Technology Ventures
Program (or STVP) is limited to
programs like the Mayfield Fellow
ship, which teaches fellows the
practical requirements of running a
company and places them at a
startup for the summer. Programs
like this, while admirable, are exclu
sive and competitive, only helping
12-15 students per year.
In light of the University's fail
ure to adequately support its entre
preneurs, Stanford Student Enter
prises, the business arm of the
ASSU, has taken upon itself to de
velop SSE Labs, a startup accelera
tor for Stanford students. In just a
few years, SSE Labs has provided
legal assistance, mentorship, office
space and other resources to over
20 student companies, without tak
ing any fees or equity. This is a step
in the right direction, but SSE alone

Given that our Career Develop
ment Center employs 14 career
counselors, as well as four peer
counselors and six student business
advisors, one would expect to find
staff dedicated to students pursu
ing much-championed careers as
entrepreneurs. Their functions,
however, focus on general business,
management consulting, banking,
public service and positions specif
ic to various constituencies like en
gineers and Ph.D.s.
Students who are interesting in
developing and marketing propri
etary technology using Stanford re
sources must deal with the notori
ously difficult Office of Technology
Licensing and querulous engineer
ing departments that often refuse
access to "academic-use-only" labs.
In return for helping students with
patenting and copyrighting materi
al, OTL requires that two-thirds of
future revenues go to the school.

does not have the resources to
make these services widely avail
able. Without university support
for entrepreneurship on the scale
of the CDC and career fairs, many
prospective founders either stop
pursuing business ideas or fail to
nurture their ideas into viable busi
nesses.
The Stanford would-be-entre

from Greek mythology, who was
surrounded by water and fruit that

was perpetually out of arms reach.
Similarly, our campus is surround
ed by notable startups such as
Google and Facebook, our new
engineering quad was funded by
the founder of NVIDIA, and with
in walking distance are some of the
most famous venture capital firms
in the country. Nevertheless, our
university, which benefits so clear
ly from the startup community, has
not taken sufficient steps to ensure
that its students are prepared for
that career path. Given this, our
editorial board recommends that
full-time career counseling staff be
dedicated to advising and mentor
ing potential founders on topics
such as financing, incorporation.

team building and developing
business models. Furthermore,
given the enormous benefit given
to the University by entrepreneur
ial students, we urge the university
to follow in the footsteps of SSE
Labs and offer free legal services
to eligible students, in order to fa
cilitate the formation of more
Stanford-student-backed ven
tures. Much like the University of
fers grants and fellowships to de
serving students to pursue re
search, we believe that University
funding for private sector initia
tives is equally deserving of uni
versity funding. After all, we're
only a Google away from replac
ing Meyer Library.
