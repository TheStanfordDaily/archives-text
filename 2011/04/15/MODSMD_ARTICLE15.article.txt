# MARKS MY WORDS
## Is Sharing Caring? 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
It was almost a pointless question
by last Sunday night and defi
nitely old news by Monday
morning. "Oh my GOD, were you
on that email list? Ya know, the one
that " "Yeah, dude. Everyone
was on that list." "Oh ... uh, yeah.
How funny was that loloctopus?!"

Yes, the UGRES_RCFS list is
really old news. It was a popular
topic for discussion through Mon
day, at most. Since then we've
moved on, mostly to the Hitler par
ody video about the list, but moved
on nonetheless. Still, take a mo
ment to return, if you will, to that
memorable chunk of time on Sun
day evening.
I was sitting in front of my lap
top idling skimming some lecture
slides when I noticed I was added
to an unfamiliar yet official
sounding email list. "Hm," I
thought and deleted it. Then
there was the first fateful mes
sage, the tiny hole that made way
for the flood, the message that
began all messages. The message
innocently asked the list, "What

is this list? And why am I on it?"
Good questions both. So good
that a lot of people thought they
were good questions too and pro
ceeded to answer them. This soon

meant that dozens of people pro
vided exactly the same set of help
ful information, which was natural
ly rendered completely unhelpful
by the time it had been repeated
more than three times.
What happened next is what re
ally might be telling. As soon as
people fully understood that the
list was open to all undergraduates,
the replies took off. Anything and
everything. Music videos? Pictures
of cute animals? Shout-outs to
friends? You name it, it was on the
list.
I abandoned the perusal of my
lecture slides to discuss the phe
nomenon in real-time on Gchat. As
the replies surged into my inbox, I
typed feverishly away to a couple
friends also online. We refreshed
our inboxes, checked some links
and reconvened to virtually giggle
about them.
And then one of my friends
asked the big question: should she
post something too? ft sounds like

My question for the
spammers is this:
why did you post?

a trivial question, almost com
pletely moot. Of course she should
just post. Over a hundred people
had already posted. What's the big
deal?

Perhaps I have a skewed idea
about the practice of posting
things in very public places. I think
it started in sixth grade, when I first
used the Internet to help me with
my research paper on Vikings, the
largest academic endeavor I had
yet undertaken at the time. I need
ed above all a catchy cover picture
for the report, and so I started
doing some middle school-level
Google image searches of
"Vikings."
Instead of immediately uncov
ering images of fearsome ships and
noble soldiers, I stumbled upon
some guy's blog with pictures of
his tailgates at Vikings games. It
took me countless clicks to uncov
er any good results. My sixth-grade
self was frustrated beyond belief.
Why couldn't I just find pictures of
Vikings? Why were those dumb
pictures on my Google search?
Who cared about that guy's blog
and his tailgate?

Since we were in middle school,
the Internet and its capabilities
have only gotten larger, offering us
a number of ways in which we can
tell people about things things
we like, things we don't like, things
about ourselves. As a result, we are
constantly presented with the de
cision of how much we want to be
heard.

Every undergrad sitting in front
of a computer on Sunday after
noon who watched the replies go
back and forth was confronted
with this decision. "Do I want to be

heard? Do I have something to
say?" A lot of people didn't, as ev
idenced by their fruitless efforts to
unsubscribe.

And about 200 people felt like
they did have something to say, in
cluding my friend on Gchat who fi
nally jumped into the fray with her
own comment of ''you mad, bro?"
and an instructional link that illus
trated how to set up email filtering.
The question isn't so much
whether spamming the
UGRES_RCFS was inappropriate
or not, and I'd agree that those of
you who think that such spam was
completely cruel and unreason
able should probably consider
learning how to filter email (this
advice goes for Hitler too). My
question for the spammers is this:
why did you post? Why did you
want to be heard on that particular
Sunday afternoon by so many
thousands of undergrads? And
what does this tendency to post say
about you?
Maybe it was the novelty of that
list popping up on a Sunday after
noon, when we all wanted to pro
crastinate, that prompted the re
lentless spam. Or maybe several
hundred Stanford undergrads re
ally want to get their voices out
there.The creation of the new, cen
sorship-free email list "absolute
freedomofspeech," modeled after
the UGRES_RCFS list, will prob
ably shed some light on these ques
tions. It sounds like it'll end up
being a forum for all the spammers
of its predecessor, but will it? Stu
dents will have to sign up for the
list themselves and will never
know how many other students
they are reaching. So will it be the
next UGRES_RCFS list? As long
as I can unsubscribe, I might try it
out.

heard? Do I have something to
say?" A lot of people didn't, as ev
idenced by their fruitless efforts to
unsubscribe.

they did have something to say, in
cluding my friend on Gchat who fi

The question isn't so much
whether spamming the
UGRES_RCFS was inappropriate
or not, and I'd agree that those of
you who think that such spam was
completely cruel and unreason
able should probably consider
learning how to filter email (this
advice goes for Hitler too). My
question for the spammers is this:
why did you post? Why did you
want to be heard on that particular
Sunday afternoon by so many
thousands of undergrads? And
what does this tendency to post say
about you?
Maybe it was the novelty of that
list popping up on a Sunday after
noon, when we all wanted to pro
crastinate, that prompted the re
lentless spam. Or maybe several
hundred Stanford undergrads re
ally want to get their voices out
there.The creation of the new, cen
sorship-free email list "absolute
freedomofspeech," modeled after
the UGRES_RCFS list, will prob
ably shed some light on these ques
tions. It sounds like it'll end up
being a forum for all the spammers
of its predecessor, but will it? Stu
dents will have to sign up for the
list themselves and will never
know how many other students
they are reaching. So will it be the
next UGRES_RCFS list? As long
as I can unsubscribe, I might try it
out.

It was almost a pointless question
by last Sunday night and defi
nitely old news by Monday
morning. "Oh my GOD, were you
on that email list? Ya know, the one
that " "Yeah, dude. Everyone
was on that list." "Oh ... uh, yeah.
How funny was that loloctopus?!"

Yes, the UGRES_RCFS list is
really old news. It was a popular
topic for discussion through Mon
day, at most. Since then we've
moved on, mostly to the Hitler par
ody video about the list, but moved
on nonetheless. Still, take a mo
ment to return, if you will, to that
memorable chunk of time on Sun
day evening.
I was sitting in front of my lap
top idling skimming some lecture
slides when I noticed I was added
to an unfamiliar yet official
sounding email list. "Hm," I
thought and deleted it. Then
there was the first fateful mes
sage, the tiny hole that made way
for the flood, the message that
began all messages. The message
innocently asked the list, "What

is this list? And why am I on it?"
Good questions both. So good
that a lot of people thought they
were good questions too and pro
ceeded to answer them. This soon

meant that dozens of people pro
vided exactly the same set of help
ful information, which was natural
ly rendered completely unhelpful
by the time it had been repeated
more than three times.
What happened next is what re
ally might be telling. As soon as
people fully understood that the
list was open to all undergraduates,
the replies took off. Anything and
everything. Music videos? Pictures
of cute animals? Shout-outs to
friends? You name it, it was on the
list.
I abandoned the perusal of my
lecture slides to discuss the phe
nomenon in real-time on Gchat. As
the replies surged into my inbox, I
typed feverishly away to a couple
friends also online. We refreshed
our inboxes, checked some links
and reconvened to virtually giggle
about them.
And then one of my friends
asked the big question: should she
post something too? ft sounds like

My question for the
spammers is this:
why did you post?

a trivial question, almost com
pletely moot. Of course she should
just post. Over a hundred people
had already posted. What's the big
deal?

Perhaps I have a skewed idea
about the practice of posting
things in very public places. I think
it started in sixth grade, when I first
used the Internet to help me with
my research paper on Vikings, the
largest academic endeavor I had
yet undertaken at the time. I need
ed above all a catchy cover picture
for the report, and so I started
doing some middle school-level
Google image searches of
"Vikings."
Instead of immediately uncov
ering images of fearsome ships and
noble soldiers, I stumbled upon
some guy's blog with pictures of
his tailgates at Vikings games. It
took me countless clicks to uncov
er any good results. My sixth-grade
self was frustrated beyond belief.
Why couldn't I just find pictures of
Vikings? Why were those dumb
pictures on my Google search?
Who cared about that guy's blog
and his tailgate?

Since we were in middle school,
the Internet and its capabilities
have only gotten larger, offering us
a number of ways in which we can
tell people about things things
we like, things we don't like, things
about ourselves. As a result, we are
constantly presented with the de
cision of how much we want to be
heard.

Every undergrad sitting in front
of a computer on Sunday after
noon who watched the replies go
back and forth was confronted
with this decision. "Do I want to be

heard? Do I have something to
say?" A lot of people didn't, as ev
idenced by their fruitless efforts to
unsubscribe.

And about 200 people felt like
they did have something to say, in
