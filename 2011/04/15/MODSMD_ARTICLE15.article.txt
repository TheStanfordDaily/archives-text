## Is Sharing Caring?

It was almost a pointless question
by last Sunday night and defi
nitely old news by Monday
morning. "Oh my GOD, were you
on that email list? Ya know, the one
that " "Yeah, dude. Everyone
was on that list." "Oh ... uh, yeah.
How funny was that loloctopus?!"

Yes, the UGRES_RCFS list is
really old news. It was a popular
topic for discussion through Mon
day, at most. Since then we've
moved on, mostly to the Hitler par
ody video about the list, but moved
on nonetheless. Still, take a mo
ment to return, if you will, to that
memorable chunk of time on Sun
day evening.
I was sitting in front of my lap
top idling skimming some lecture
slides when I noticed I was added
to an unfamiliar yet official
sounding email list. "Hm," I
thought and deleted it. Then
there was the first fateful mes
sage, the tiny hole that made way
for the flood, the message that
began all messages. The message
innocently asked the list, "What

is this list? And why am I on it?"
Good questions both. So good
that a lot of people thought they
were good questions too and pro
ceeded to answer them. This soon

meant that dozens of people pro
vided exactly the same set of help
ful information, which was natural
ly rendered completely unhelpful
by the time it had been repeated
more than three times.
What happened next is what re
ally might be telling. As soon as
people fully understood that the
list was open to all undergraduates,
the replies took off. Anything and
everything. Music videos? Pictures
of cute animals? Shout-outs to
friends? You name it, it was on the
list.
I abandoned the perusal of my
lecture slides to discuss the phe
nomenon in real-time on Gchat. As
the replies surged into my inbox, I
typed feverishly away to a couple
friends also online. We refreshed
our inboxes, checked some links
and reconvened to virtually giggle
about them.
And then one of my friends
asked the big question: should she
post something too? ft sounds like

My question for the
spammers is this:
why did you post?
