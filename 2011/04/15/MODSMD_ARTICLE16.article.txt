# OP-ED
## The 						Advantages of a Liberal Education 
### Kristian Bailey 
Editor's note.l have decided not to
print this piece as a member of my
weekly column, "Obsessive Kom
pulsion," but as a general op-ed. My
column will resume next week.

When I heard that William
Deresiewicz, author of
"The Disadvantages of an
Elite Education," was coming to
speak at Stanford, I could not have
been more excited. The 2008 article,
which one of my dorm staff sent to
our mailing list early fall quarter,
has prompted me to think a lot
about what it means to be at Stan
ford, receiving a "Stanford educa
tion" and whether or not I am truly
challenging myself to become a se
rious thinker and productive mem
ber of society.

In his article and conversation,
Deresiewicz describes the growing
sense of entitlement that students
(specifically Ivy League students in
the article, but in actuality students

from any "elite" university) have to
wards future success and high pay
ing jobs. This expectation stems
from the grade inflation, pampering
and seclusion from the rest of socie
ty that these institutions promote.
Deresiewicz points out that the
point of such institutions is to "man
ufacture" alumni, who continue to
support the system. Because these
systems need money, the University
seeks to train its "products" for
high-paying professional jobs,
hence the entitlement. What the
University does not do is teach its
students to ask "the big questions."
Instead, it teaches us to think in a
way that is suited for Wall Street, for
med school, for law school, etc., as
Deresiewicz said in his talk. This
creates a system in which students
are academically specialized and
extracurricular-ly accomplished,
but have no opinions; in which
doing something we're passionate
about is not as important as doing

something that will secure us suc
cess; and a system in which the value
of a liberal education in the human
ities is declining.
Recognizing that I am a member
of one such system, though one that
I and I think Deresiewicz would
agree does not suffer from these
symptoms as much as our peers on
the East Coast (hooray "entrepre
neurial spirit!"), I would like to ad
dress my own assessment of the
problems, as I have experienced or
perceived them. I definitely feel
pressure to follow a track: to win a
prestigious grant or fellowship, to
graduate within four years, to go to

Law School, to get a high paying
job. These pressures are not the re
sult of familial expectations; they
simply seem to be the "logical" pro
gression for one who is interested in
government or law and wants to live
"happily ever after." Grad school
seems to be the mindless cop-out
for those of us who don't know what
we want to do with our lives, except
that we want to make money. I also
feel social pressure to study some
thing "useful." Ideally, I would
major in American Studies, spend
senior year watching all of Ameri
can TV shows of the 2000s and ex
tracting a cultural narrative from it
through which to view the world
around me. But who is that useful
to? Deresiewicz argued that it's
useful to us to follow things we're
passionate about. And that there's
no reason living "happily ever
after" shouldn't mean living in a de
cent sized home with an average in
come and doing what we love. And

while I'm passionate about our cul
ture and society, how we will be per
ceived and where we're headed,
some obscure thesis about the im
plications of [insert scholarly word]
in [insert century] seems more
"marketable."
Maybe it's because I'm reading
Marx right now that I'm feeling so
fed up with "the system," but this
sensation itself is indicative of what
I think would satisfy many of Dere
siewicz's complaints, and what I
think is redeeming about under
graduate education at Stanford:
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE).
SLE is the most rewarding intel
lectual and personal experience
I've undergone and it's not ever
over yet\ With two full quarters of
the "great thinkers" behind me,
and with seven weeks of influential
modern thought ahead, I find my

self asking "the big questions"
every day. This past week, I've
been having issues over what it
means to be human, whether or
not I can understand inherently
who I am (and if I'm even close to
doing so) and why we need to have
so much social and governmental
interference in our individual lives.
This introspection is not a recent
phenomenon my roommate,
dormmates and I have been having
conversations around questions
like these all year.
Structurally, SLE eliminates
most of the issues I see in the Uni
versity: we don't receive grades
until the end of each quarter, which
reduces immediate competition
and makes the focus on the learning
process; we receive immeasurable

writing support, in the form of writ
ing tutors (SLE alumni) who must
meet with us for each paper and
"paper conferences" in which we
discuss the strengths and weakness
es of our papers with our section
leaders (this replaces the immedi
ate grade); it is a yearlong program,
encouraging both breadth and
depth we are taking our time to
think about the world from multi
ple standpoints before we start to
specialize in a field; and we are pas
sionate about what we're learning. I
can speak for most of us when I say
that I love SLE.

What I am dreading is the notion
that I will not be able to immerse
myself in such a stimulating aca
demic environment after SLE, and
that even if I find such a program, I
won't be surrounded by students
who are as passionate about it as
SLE students are. What is also dis
tressing is that only 5 percent of the
undergraduate population can ex
perience SLE.

My solutions to the issues Dere
siewicz raised are brief: create more
programs like SLE, which the Uni
versity is considering; offer SLE in
its current curriculum to upper
classmen who wish to take it (for I
do hear "Oh, I wish I did SLE"
often, despite all the flak SLE gets);
and offer higher levels of SLE to
SLE alumni who wish to continue a
liberal education.
Ideally, the University would
mandate that all students take a
year off while undergraduates, not
give grades, and allow students to
take as much time as they wanted to
explore general fields before grad
uating, but for the time being, this
seems like the most feasible means
to creating a more personally valu
able experience for the undergrad
uate community.
