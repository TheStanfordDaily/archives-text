### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
A report compiled for Los Altos
Hills officials offers the first official
data for a contentious debate about
Stanford-funded trail construction
along Arastradero road.
According to the survey, con
ducted by Hexagon Transportation
Consultants, after the upgrades
about 30 pedestrians per day are ex
pected to cross Arastradero Road
near Stirrup Way, roughly double
the current number. It adds that con
structing a bike lane on Arastradero
would likely not increase the num
ber of cyclists per day, which stands

at 372. The numbers are less than
some residents were expecting, al
though some have called the survey
mere speculation.
The proposal would give Los
Altos Hills $1.19 million to repair
the "SI" trail and connect with Stan
ford's trail system.The project stems
from the University's General Use
Permit (GUP), an agreement be
tween Stanford and the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors that
stipulates, among other things, that
the University must build or im
prove local trails in exchange for
permission to expand campus con
struction.

In an interview with the Los
Altos Town Crier, Stanford Director
of Government and Community
Relations Larry Horton said the
University wouldn't object if the Los
Altos Hills city council rejects the
offer, since merely making the offer
puts Stanford in compliance with
the GUP.
