## CAN'T BE STOPPED NO. 8 CARD WIN SIXTH STRAIGHT 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team is get
ting hot at the right time of the season. All
year, head coach John Whitlinger has
stressed that his goal as a coach is to get his
team ready "to play their best tennis in
May." It seems as if Whitlinger's dreams just
might come true, as his team is currently rid
ing a season-best six-match winning streak
with May and the postseason quickly
approaching.
The Cardinal's recent stretch of winning
play appears even more impressive when
the quality of its opponents are taken into
consideration, as all have been high-caliber
teams No. 13 UCLA, No. 31 Tulsa, No. 56
Arizona, No. 29 San Diego State, No. 22
Washington and No. 70 Oregon.

With four matches left in the regular sea
son, all of which will be played at home in
the Taube Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal is
looking to finish its season in style and to
prepare for the upcoming Pac-10 champi
onships, held April 28 to May 1 in Oj ai, Calif.
Stanford's stretch run began today
against the No. 52 Boise State Broncos.
Coming out of the competitive Western
Athletic Conference, the Broncos have had
a very successful season so far, having com
piled a 13-11 record and, entering the match
against Stanford on Thursday, were in the
midst of their very own six-match winning
streak. The Broncos are led, in both singles
and doubles play, by South African junior
Damian Hume. On Thursday, Hume drew
the difficult task of facing the Cardinal's No.
1 player, junior Bradley Klahn.
Stanford jumped all over Boise State
early, dominating the match from the very
beginning. Klahn and senior teammate
Ryan Thacher dismantled the Bronco's top
doubles team of Humes and Scott Sears, 8-5.

The No. 8 men's tennis team won its sixth straight match with a decisive 6-1 victory over Boise
St. and is poised to carry plenty of momentum into the Pac-10 Championships in two weeks.
When the No. 2 doubles team for
the Cardinal, featuring sophomores
Matt Kandath and Dennis Lin, de
feated their Boise State opponents
8-3, Stanford had locked up the
match's first point and was well
on its way to victory.
In singles play, Stanford looked
even stronger than in doubles. The
Cardinal won three matches
which gave it the four points need
ed to win the match in very
quick succession. The Cardinal did
n't drop a set and outscored the
Broncos in those three matches by

a combined game score of 32-8. The
upperclassmen for the Cardinal
took care of these first three
matches, with Klahn winning 6-1,6-
0 over Hume, Thacher taking out
his opponent Filipp Pogotskin 6-3,
6-1 and senior Alex Clayton de
feating Andrew Bettles of Boise
State 6-1,6-2.
Leading 4-0 in the match and
having already clinched a victory,
Stanford went 2-1 in the three re
maining contests. Freshman Jamin
Ball, playing out of the six spot, had
probably his most impressive outing
of the year against the Broncos,
showing that, as the year has pro
gressed, so has he. Against the older
and more experienced junior Fred
dy Walsh, Ball showed why he was
such a highly touted prospect out of

nearby Menlo School, blitzing
Walsh to the tune of a 6-2,6-1 rout.
"It was nice to get a win." Ball said.
"I've had some tough matches the
last couple times out there."
With the victory, the Stanford
men's tennis team has now won
seven in a row —by far its longest
winning streak of the year. The play
offs are looming, but, as Ball attests,
the team's confidence is growing
with every victory.
"Confidence is huge in tennis,
and we're gaining more and more
with every match," he said.
Stanford will next face No. 70
San Francisco on Monday at 3:30
p.m. in Taube Tennis Stadium.
