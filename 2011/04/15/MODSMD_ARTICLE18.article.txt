## CAN'T BE STOPPED NO. 8 CARD WIN SIXTH STRAIGHT 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team is get
ting hot at the right time of the season. All
year, head coach John Whitlinger has
stressed that his goal as a coach is to get his
team ready "to play their best tennis in
May." It seems as if Whitlinger's dreams just
might come true, as his team is currently rid
ing a season-best six-match winning streak
with May and the postseason quickly
approaching.
The Cardinal's recent stretch of winning
play appears even more impressive when
the quality of its opponents are taken into
consideration, as all have been high-caliber
teams No. 13 UCLA, No. 31 Tulsa, No. 56
Arizona, No. 29 San Diego State, No. 22
Washington and No. 70 Oregon.

With four matches left in the regular sea
son, all of which will be played at home in
the Taube Tennis Stadium, the Cardinal is
looking to finish its season in style and to
prepare for the upcoming Pac-10 champi
onships, held April 28 to May 1 in Oj ai, Calif.
Stanford's stretch run began today
against the No. 52 Boise State Broncos.
Coming out of the competitive Western
Athletic Conference, the Broncos have had
a very successful season so far, having com
piled a 13-11 record and, entering the match
against Stanford on Thursday, were in the
midst of their very own six-match winning
streak. The Broncos are led, in both singles
and doubles play, by South African junior
Damian Hume. On Thursday, Hume drew
the difficult task of facing the Cardinal's No.
1 player, junior Bradley Klahn.
Stanford jumped all over Boise State
early, dominating the match from the very
beginning. Klahn and senior teammate
Ryan Thacher dismantled the Bronco's top
doubles team of Humes and Scott Sears, 8-5.
