## MEN'S SOCCER DEFEATS VISITING SAN JOSE STATE IN SPRING OPENER 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
The Stanford men's soccer team
opened its spring campaign with a 2-1 vic
tory over visiting San Jose State Thursday
night at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
The Cardinal played tentatively in the
opening minutes, but the new defensive
quartet of juniors Tommy Ryan and Adoni
Levine, sophomore Hunter Gorskie and
freshman Jack Ryan played very well in
their first game together. Stanford is re
placing graduating seniors Ail-American
Bobby Warshaw and All-Pac-10 selection
Ryan Thomas, both of whom were drafted
and are now playing in the MLS.

Redshirt junior Garrett Gunther
opened the team's spring scoring account
with a nice run midway through the first
half, slotting the ball past the Spartan keep
er. But play didn't really open up until the
second half, when head coach Bret Simon
substituted freely as he tried out various
personnel combinations.
Junior Alexander Binnie was brought
down on a breakaway in the penalty box as
the speed of the game increased in the sec
ond half. Binnie stepped up and finished
off the ensuing penalty kick himself for a 2-
0 Stanford lead.
But San Jose State struck back with a
penalty of its own when Levine and
Gorskie converged on an attacker and
Levine slid in hard, bringing him down in
side the box. The dive of redshirt freshman
Galen Perkins (who replaced starting
freshman Drew Hutchins at halftime)
could not stop the penalty kick, and the
Spartans drew within one goal.
But the Cardinal held firm late in the
game, keeping possession to seal the 2-1
victory.
Sophomore midfielder Dersu Abolfathi
felt the team had met many of its goals for
the night.
"We set some goals to play with confi
dence, with strength and witli tempo, and
I'd say we are fairly happy with our
progress and the results," he said. "It wasn't
the best game we've ever played, but it was
a good first step."
Stanford welcomes the San Jose Earth
quakes of the MLS to Laird Q. Cagan Sta
dium on Tuesday night as the spring season
rolls on.
