### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a 6-1 win over St. Mary's at the
Taube Tennis Stadium on Thursday after
noon, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team increased its record-breaking NCAA
home winning streak to 179 victories, the
longest string of home wins in all of Division
I athletics. The Cardinal (22-0, 7-0 Pac-10)
has also won forty-one straight matches, with
its last defeat dating back to February 2010
against UCLA.

The Gaels (11-7) came to Stanford having
won nine out of their previous ten matches,
but were handed a quick defeat at the hands
of the Stanford women. The Cardinal won
the first doubles point with victories from
senior Hilary Barte and sophomore Mallory
Burdette on court one, defeating St. Mary's
Alex Poorta and Anna Chkhikvishvili, 8-2.
Court two also saw the Cardinal take con
trol, as senior Carolyn McVeigh and sopho

ZACK HOBERG/The Stanford Daily
Senior Hilary Barte is currently ranked fourth in the country in singles play, and her 6-0, 6-3 victory over Alex Poorta helped propel No. 2 Stanford to their 179th straight home victory on
Thursday. The Card is 7-0 in Pac-10 play and clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title.
and Claire Soper 9-7. Doubles on
court three, however, was less con
vincing: junior Veronica Li and sen
ior Jennifer Yen dropped the pro
set, 8-4, to Catherine Isip and Diana
Bukajeva.
Singles was smooth sailing, as
every Cardinal player besides Tan,
who was defeated by the Gaels
Jenny Jullie 6-4, 6-3, recorded a
straight-set victory. Barte, freshman
Nicole Gibbs, Li and McVeigh all
recorded easy wins over their St.
Mary's opponents. Burdette got a
win as well, but struggled in the sec
ond set after crushing her oppo
nent, Isip, 6-0 in the first. Gibbs, who
was playing on the court next to
her, described the intensity of the
match.

"Mall {Mallory] was up 40-0 at 5-
3 in the second set, tying up three
match points. Isip made a come
back, though," Gibbs said. "Mall fi
nally won the second set on her
sixth match point 7-6 (6). She is def
initely one of the grittiest players
and a total fighter, and the fact that
she fought through is a testament to
her determination."

The victory was an important
one for the Cardinal as it looks
ahead to Saturday. The team will be
traveling across the bay to face No.
16 Cal at Berkeley in the final match
of the regular season. Stanford,
which stands at 7-0 in league play
compared to Cal's record of 6-1, has
also clinched at least a share of the
Pac-10 title even with a possible loss
to Cal. In order to capture the full
title, however, Stanford needs a win
at Berkeley.
"I think our match today was a
really key part of our preparation
for this weekend," Gibbs said.
"We'll have a practice tomorrow to
work on whatever doesn't feel good
and to rid ourselves of the kinks.

"I think the way we're viewing
this match is, 'Yeah we have a piece
of the Pac-10 title, but we're not
looking to share it,"' she said with a
laugh.

The Cardinal faced the Golden
Bears under two months ago at
home, thrashing them 5-2 and only
dropping matches on courts one

and two of the singles. Stanford also
wants a win this weekend to close
out its regular schedule and enter
the postseason undefeated.
"Just the fact that it's going to be
Cal's senior day means that there
will be a whole lot of energy around
the match, and preparing for that at
mosphere is especially important,"
Gibbs said. "Our beat-down of
them last time will give them even
more impetus to win, so we must be
ready."

The Cardinal faced Cal in last
year's match-up with the Pac-10
title at stake. Last year's victory
over Cal not only gave Stanford the
Pac-10 crown, but also momentum
moving forward something the
players hope will transfer from this
weekend's events.

"The way the season has gone, a
win this weekend would be the icing
on the cake," Gibbs said. "The
biggest plus of going undefeated
would be the confidence our team
would have entering Pac-lOs and
NCAAs. I really think that we are
totally in the place to do it and
would be really excited to see that
happen."
Last year, with only one loss,
Stanford entered the NCAA tour
nament as huge underdogs, just
barely inside the top ten. This year,
the Cardinal looks to enter the tour
nament with the respect it feels it
deserves.

The Cardinal and Golden Bears
are set to duke it out for control of
the Pac-10 title this Saturday at 12
p.m. in Berkeley.

With a 6-1 win over St. Mary's at the
Taube Tennis Stadium on Thursday after
noon, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
team increased its record-breaking NCAA
home winning streak to 179 victories, the
longest string of home wins in all of Division
I athletics. The Cardinal (22-0, 7-0 Pac-10)
has also won forty-one straight matches, with
its last defeat dating back to February 2010
against UCLA.

The Gaels (11-7) came to Stanford having
won nine out of their previous ten matches,
but were handed a quick defeat at the hands
of the Stanford women. The Cardinal won
the first doubles point with victories from
senior Hilary Barte and sophomore Mallory
Burdette on court one, defeating St. Mary's
Alex Poorta and Anna Chkhikvishvili, 8-2.
Court two also saw the Cardinal take con
trol, as senior Carolyn McVeigh and sopho
more Stacey Tan slipped past Jenny Jullien

ZACK HOBERG/The Stanford Daily
Senior Hilary Barte is currently ranked fourth in the country in singles play, and her 6-0, 6-3 victory over Alex Poorta helped propel No. 2 Stanford to their 179th straight home victory on
Thursday. The Card is 7-0 in Pac-10 play and clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title.
and Claire Soper 9-7. Doubles on
court three, however, was less con
vincing: junior Veronica Li and sen
ior Jennifer Yen dropped the pro
set, 8-4, to Catherine Isip and Diana
Bukajeva.
Singles was smooth sailing, as
every Cardinal player besides Tan,
who was defeated by the Gaels
Jenny Jullie 6-4, 6-3, recorded a
straight-set victory. Barte, freshman
Nicole Gibbs, Li and McVeigh all
recorded easy wins over their St.
Mary's opponents. Burdette got a
win as well, but struggled in the sec
ond set after crushing her oppo
nent, Isip, 6-0 in the first. Gibbs, who
was playing on the court next to
her, described the intensity of the
match.

"Mall {Mallory] was up 40-0 at 5-
3 in the second set, tying up three
match points. Isip made a come
back, though," Gibbs said. "Mall fi
nally won the second set on her
sixth match point 7-6 (6). She is def
initely one of the grittiest players
and a total fighter, and the fact that
she fought through is a testament to
her determination."

The victory was an important
one for the Cardinal as it looks
ahead to Saturday. The team will be
traveling across the bay to face No.
16 Cal at Berkeley in the final match
of the regular season. Stanford,
which stands at 7-0 in league play
compared to Cal's record of 6-1, has
also clinched at least a share of the
Pac-10 title even with a possible loss
to Cal. In order to capture the full
title, however, Stanford needs a win
at Berkeley.
"I think our match today was a
really key part of our preparation
for this weekend," Gibbs said.
"We'll have a practice tomorrow to
work on whatever doesn't feel good
and to rid ourselves of the kinks.

"I think the way we're viewing
this match is, 'Yeah we have a piece
of the Pac-10 title, but we're not
looking to share it,"' she said with a
laugh.

The Cardinal faced the Golden
Bears under two months ago at
home, thrashing them 5-2 and only
dropping matches on courts one

and two of the singles. Stanford also
wants a win this weekend to close
out its regular schedule and enter
the postseason undefeated.
"Just the fact that it's going to be
Cal's senior day means that there
will be a whole lot of energy around
the match, and preparing for that at
mosphere is especially important,"
Gibbs said. "Our beat-down of
them last time will give them even
more impetus to win, so we must be
ready."

The Cardinal faced Cal in last
year's match-up with the Pac-10
title at stake. Last year's victory
over Cal not only gave Stanford the
Pac-10 crown, but also momentum
moving forward something the
players hope will transfer from this
weekend's events.

"The way the season has gone, a
win this weekend would be the icing
on the cake," Gibbs said. "The
biggest plus of going undefeated
would be the confidence our team
would have entering Pac-lOs and
NCAAs. I really think that we are
totally in the place to do it and
would be really excited to see that
happen."
