# Agony and Ecstasy in Espana
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Without trying to make you all
too jealous, I need to start this
column by explaining that I'm
in Spain right now. I'm in Sala
manca for a couple of weeks
far away from the stresses of lectures and
coursework so, like any good tourist or
sports fan, I'm making sure to get a taste of the
action here. And, as luck would have it, I arrived
just in time to catch two local teams playing per
haps the biggest games in their histories.
Salamanca's women's basketball team, Hal
con Avenida, played in and won the final of the
Euro League tournament on Sunday, minutes
before its soccer team, Union Deportivo de
Salamanca (UDS), managed only to record a tie
as it continued the fight for its life in the second
tier of La Liga. The contrast in fortunes of the
two couldn't have been greater. Halcon Avenida
defeated Spartak Moscow 68-59 in Russia to end
Spartak's four-year reign and in the next few
days will try and add a national title to its trophy
cabinet. UDS was last in the top division of Span
ish soccer back in 1999 and now lies in the rele
gation zone of the second tier after recently los
ing four games in a row. Many local fans now fear
not just that their team may drop down a league,
but that with the sharp fall in income from the
loss of TV rights, it may actually cease to exist.
In a country obsessed by soccer, this seems
like the ultimate catastrophe, but the harsh real
ity of any sport is that to have a winner, there
must be a loser. Add in the system of promoting
the stronger teams and relegating the weaker
ones that is widespread across Europe, and you
have a recipe for both hope and heartbreak.
Fans of even the smallest teams always have
reason to dream, but not even the mighty Real
Madrid or Barcelona are entirely safe.
Back home in England, my own soccer team,
Reading FC, has suddenly shifted into gear, win
ning the last six games straight and miraculous
ly making a serious charge for promotion to the
Premier League. After a frustrating season in
which the team seemed to be trying to set a
record for the number of tied games, it's now ac
tually fun to be a fan again.
I think sometimes people wonder why I
don't support any of the big English teams, why
I chose an admittedly average club over the soc
cer powerhouses of London, Liverpool or Man
chester. I think it's partly a case of my sense of
belonging to where I grew up, but there's also
the fact that life is far more real down here. You
can't really know pleasure without experienc
ing pain, and you earn your stripes as a soccer
fan not by supporting a club when times are
good, but by still being there when they're bad.
There are many fans of the top clubs who have
been there long enough to know what failure
feels like, but there are newcomers who cannot
put events in their real context. Getting
knocked out of the final stages of the UEFA
Champions League is obviously nothing to be
happy about, but it's the equivalent of getting a
3.9 GPA at Stanford when you thought you'd
get a perfect 4.0. Just getting accepted to study at
such an illustrious institution would be a dream
come true for most.
It's probably little consolation right now to
the fans of UDS that Friedrich Nietzsche once
observed "that which does not kill us makes us
stronger," but that doesn't mean he was wrong.
Hopefully the club will find away to eke out
enough points to secure safety, but if it doesn't, all
is not lost. Harsh decisions may need to be made
to ensure its financial survival, and in the current
economic crisis that's a tough thing to ask. But it
just seems impossible that it could simply evapo
rate into thin air. As long as there are soccer fans
in the city, the heart of the team will re
main, and even if the current legal and
financial entity is ripped to pieces, they
can always come together and found a
new team.

And when UDS finally emerges
from this slump and begins to record

even the smallest success, the agony
that the fans are now experiencing
will make those victories taste sweet
er than anything any of the grandest
clubs could ever achieve.

Not only does Tom Taylor enjoy rub
bing his Spanish vacation in your
face, but he also had the audacity to
ask for an extension on this column
in order to work on erasing his
farmer's tan. Interrupt his siesta at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
