# NO. 9 BEAVERS IN TOWN FOR SHOWDOWN
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball has one goal this weekend:
score runs.
A simple objective, to be sure. But it's a task
that has proved frustratingly difficult in the past
week for the Cardinal. With No. 9 Oregon State
paying a visit to Sunken Diamond this weekend,
all eyes will be on Stanford's bats.
After scoring eight runs in a win over USC in
the first game of last weekend's series, the Cardi
nal lineup has been silenced. No. 17 Stanford (16-
9,3-3 Pac-10) lost the final two games against the
struggling Trojans, scratching one run across in
each.
Stanford got back in the win column against
Pacific with a 3-1 victory on Tuesday, but that was
more thanks to the Cardinal pitching than the hit
ting. Still, players had no problem taking away
positives from the offensive performance.
"The team and coaches thought that was one
of our better all-around games," said senior out
fielder Ben Clowe. "We hit a lot of balls hard and

only struck out twice.
"We've been working on simplifying things
and seeing the ball well," he continued. "Hope the
rest takes care of itself."

It's going to take more than hope to beat the
surging Beavers (24-7,5-1 Pac-10), winners of six
straight games including a sweep over defending
Pac-10 conference champion No. 5 Arizona State.
"[Oregon State] is a team that when they get
hot they can beat anyone, [as proven] by their
back-to-back national titles," said senior catcher
Zach Jones. "Right now, they're really hot."
That could prove troublesome for Stanford.
The Beavers played well on both sides of the ball
against the Sun Devils, winning 5-3,7-6 and 9-6.T0
put Oregon State's sweep in perspective, the last
time ASU was swept in a Pac-10 series was more
than a decade ago.

It's starting to feel like it's been a decade since
the Cardinal played a series at home, too.
"It is very nice to finally play at home," Clowe
said. "We've traveled so much this year, but we've

NOTES: No. 9 Oregon State is coming to
town on a real tear. With six straight wins,
including a sweep of No. 5 Arizona State,
Pat Casey's team has surged to the top of
the Pac-10 standings and will present a
stiff test for No. 1 7 Stanford in this week
end's series. Sophomore Mark Appel gets
the ball for the first game Friday night.


played well at home when given the
chance. Hopefully there is a big crowd
out there."
The Cardinal's last home series
was over Spring Break against Long
Beach State, which Stanford won two
games to one. Stanford's most recent
win over Pacific improves its home
record to 10-1.
Whatever mojo playing at home
gives the Cardinal, it needs to be there
this weekend. Stanford will send out
its normal trio of pitchers: sophomore
Mark Appel on Friday, junior Jordan
Pries on Saturday and sophomore
Dean McArdle on Sunday. Their
focus will be on controlling catcher
Andrew Susac.The sophomore Susac
leads the Beavers with a .364 batting
average and is tied for the team lead
with four home runs, flashing the
power that had major league scouts
salivating in high school the
Phillies drafted him in the 16th round

out of Jesuit High School in Sacra
mento.

The series could ultimately be de
cided on the basepaths. Oregon State
likes to run, stealing 34 bags so far this
season sophomore outfielder
Garrett Nash paces the Beavers with
seven steals. Yet Jones is one of the
best defensive catchers in college
baseball and has shut down oppo
nents' running games before.
Despite Jones' prowess behind
the plate, the Cardinal would rather
shut down the Beavers' running
game by scoring runs and forcing

them to be conservative on the bases.
Susac is a highly rated defensive
catcher himself, so it should be a good
matchup behind the dish.
As for confidence, there is no
shortage. Just ask outfielder Dave
Giuliani.

"I'm the leading hitter, so as long
as I keep hitting we'll be alright," the
senior said with a smile.

First pitch is scheduled for 5:30
p.m. tonight.
