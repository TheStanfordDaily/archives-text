# NO. 9 BEAVERS IN TOWN FOR SHOWDOWN
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball has one goal this weekend:
score runs.
A simple objective, to be sure. But it's a task
that has proved frustratingly difficult in the past
week for the Cardinal. With No. 9 Oregon State
paying a visit to Sunken Diamond this weekend,
all eyes will be on Stanford's bats.
After scoring eight runs in a win over USC in
the first game of last weekend's series, the Cardi
nal lineup has been silenced. No. 17 Stanford (16-
9,3-3 Pac-10) lost the final two games against the
struggling Trojans, scratching one run across in
each.
Stanford got back in the win column against
Pacific with a 3-1 victory on Tuesday, but that was
more thanks to the Cardinal pitching than the hit
ting. Still, players had no problem taking away
positives from the offensive performance.
"The team and coaches thought that was one
of our better all-around games," said senior out
fielder Ben Clowe. "We hit a lot of balls hard and

only struck out twice.
"We've been working on simplifying things
and seeing the ball well," he continued. "Hope the
rest takes care of itself."

It's going to take more than hope to beat the
surging Beavers (24-7,5-1 Pac-10), winners of six
straight games including a sweep over defending
Pac-10 conference champion No. 5 Arizona State.
"[Oregon State] is a team that when they get
hot they can beat anyone, [as proven] by their
back-to-back national titles," said senior catcher
Zach Jones. "Right now, they're really hot."
That could prove troublesome for Stanford.
The Beavers played well on both sides of the ball
against the Sun Devils, winning 5-3,7-6 and 9-6.T0
put Oregon State's sweep in perspective, the last
time ASU was swept in a Pac-10 series was more
than a decade ago.

It's starting to feel like it's been a decade since
the Cardinal played a series at home, too.
"It is very nice to finally play at home," Clowe
said. "We've traveled so much this year, but we've

NOTES: No. 9 Oregon State is coming to
town on a real tear. With six straight wins,
including a sweep of No. 5 Arizona State,
Pat Casey's team has surged to the top of
the Pac-10 standings and will present a
stiff test for No. 1 7 Stanford in this week
end's series. Sophomore Mark Appel gets
the ball for the first game Friday night.
