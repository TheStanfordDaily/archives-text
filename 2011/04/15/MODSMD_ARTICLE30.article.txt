## COACHELLA ACTS TO LOOK FORWARD TO 
### 
Coachella, the annual hipster mecca, takes over the polo fields of
Indio, Calif., starting today. Here are the five acts we're most
excited for.

Kanye West
Let's hope Coachella isn't a repeat of hiaJs
2008 Bonnaroo appearance when the
"Monster" rapper showed up over two
hours late to his 2:45 a.m. time slot.

Arcade Fire
The Canadian group first played th<
they're back and bigger than ever with a recent Grammy win for
Album of the Year under their belts.

Mumford & Sons
Known for their electrifying live shows, the English folk rock band
a prime spot on the main stage in between Bright Eyes
and Animal Collective.

Gogol Bordello
Wild performances from folks like Eugene Hutz and his manic
band of punk gypsies are what Coachella's all about.

Robyn
If headliners Kings of Leon aren't your cup of tea, head over to
the Mojave tent and hang vdth tf\e queen of Swedish electropop.
