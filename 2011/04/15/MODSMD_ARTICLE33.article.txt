## Tough to go wrong at Tofu House 
### – josh GLUCOFT contact josh: glucoft@stanford. edu 
South Korea takes kimchi very seriously: the
spicy cabbage concoction accompanied the
first South Korean astronaut into space in
2008 to combat homesickness and as a matter of
national pride. The country even established the
World Institute of Kimchi specifically to study the
various methods of preparation to try to bring the
foodstuff to the global stage. At its core, kimchi is
not about aesthetics and artistic plating, it's about
piquant and dynamic flavors coupled with just the
right texture which essentially sums up the
experience of So Gong Dong Tofu House.
Tofu House is characterized by a bright, color
ful interior and a boisterous atmosphere. The

restaurant serves well as an extremely casual sit
down for friends grabbing lunch or dinner.

The series of small side dishes, or banchan,
that come with your meal are a good source of
variety to juxtapose with your entree. The standard
set at Tofu House consists of potatoes with a touch
of sweetness, cucumbers, kimchi, glass noodles,

bean sprouts and spicy seaweed. They are not par
ticularly interesting unto themselves; the kimchi is
too mild, and the seaweed is off, lacking the sparkle
that nori often provides. They can, however, add a
great crunch to your SoonDußoo soft tofu bowl or
provide some relief if you were too adventurous

with your spices. On a related note, the relative
heat meter is shockingly skewed, so those looking
for something with kick should have no problem
ordering from the higher end of the spectrum.
The soft tofu bowls provide amazing taste
without being too salty. Added rice gives the
entrees a more substantial feel that the extremely
smooth tofu alone can't provide. The various offer
ings have much in common in terms of their flavor
profiles; there is not a huge variation between the
SoonDußoo Original Soft Tofu bowl and the Yache
ManDu SoonDußoo Vegetable Dumpling Soft
Tofu bowl, for example. Some of the components,
however, fare better than others. In this case, pork
in the former bowl adds an excellent heartiness to
the dish, while the vegetable dumplings in the latter
do not physically hold up well in the broth. The
HaeMul SoonDußoo Seafood Soft Tofu bowl is
another fantastic option that pairs subde seafood
flavors extremely well with the soft tofu. The only
obstacle is that the shrimp is sometimes not entire
ly shelled, so the diner either has to do a little extra
work or can choose to power through the unusual
texture of an unshelled shrimp.

Banchan, or Korean side dishes, such as kim-chi and seaweed, are served with every meal.


The other carnivorous options are also among Tofu House's strong
suits. The incredible DakGoGi DolSot Bißimßab, for example, is served at
rice-crackling temperatures, making the wait while you salivate so much
more difficult. The bowl is full of savory vegetables on top of sizzling rice
and chicken that is as succulent as the fattier pork and beef options. The
barbecue dishes such as the BulGoGi beef are also mouthwatering and per
fect for sharing, but they are served bare and require the banchan to com
plete the experience.
While its meatless options are certainly respectable, Tofu House may
not be as much of a destination for the vegetarian or vegan crowd as its
name might imply. However, it is tough to go wrong with such a depth of
delicious plates, and almost everyone should be able to find something they
will enjoy. It's not a bastion of culinary mastery, but Tofu House is "defi
nitely worth trying."
