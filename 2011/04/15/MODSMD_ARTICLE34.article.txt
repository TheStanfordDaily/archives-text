The more things change, the more
they stay the same.
For a band that has gone through a
number of highs and lows during its 30-
year run, The Smithereens continue to
retain the same sound and voice that
is starkly present in their earliest record
ings. Pair their latest offering, "2011," with
their first studio album, "Especially For
You" (1986), and search for any dramatic,
significant differences. I'll spare you the
endeavor: outside of an indiscernible
change in the bassist, they don't exist.
The same qualities are there: the con
sistent and soothing (if not pained) voice
of lead singer Pat DiNizio; Jim Babjak's
guitar riffs; the heavy and well-timed
drumming of Dennis Diken; lyrics touch
ing on love, broken hearts and everything
in between and a general vibe that crosses
the easy listening of early rock and roll with
the more intense instrumental of 1980s
glam metal.
That's fine; it's perfectly enjoyable. And
with The Smithereens, you know what
you're getting. "2011" doesn't try to change
a formula that, in an era where even popu
lar cult rock bands can't afford to stay
together, has worked for over a quarter of a
century. The issue is that if you adhere too
closely to that sound and message, it is
hard to find variation not only between
albums, but between tracks, too. Even if
you listen to "2011" in a vacuum, away
from past releases, there is a feeling of
repetitiveness that sets in after listening to
just a few songs.
That's not to say that it is all the same.
"Goodnight Goodbye," for instance, is an

acoustic recording that stands in contrast
to the strongly played, fast-paced "What
Went Wrong." But one outlier does not
make up for the heightened similarities of
most of the tracks it begs the question
of why the group chose "Sorry" as its first
single, since it is no better or worse in this
regard than any other song on the record.
This is the ultimate problem: there's
nothing on "2011" that sets any of its tracks
apart. Harken back, again, to the group's
formative days, and it's easy to understand
why "Behind The Wall Of Sleep" became
one of The Smithereens's earliest hits: it
had multilayered, highly referential lyrics
that, combined with well-placed instru
mental intervals, created three and a half
minutes of music that both rock nerds and
casual listeners could enjoy. And yet, the
ultimate topic was still the same as always:
love, or in its case, unrequited love. There is
simply not a comparable track on "2011."
Complacency is a hard word to use,
but it fits: outside of, perhaps, "Viennese
Hangover," which skirts the issue of love all
together, the lyrics are a superficial look at
the most intimate of concepts. If the group
is going to be singularly focused on that
one dynamic, it has to produce a deeper
and more intricate expression of the idea.
"2011" is still a technically sound, suit
able record. But its tracks feel like a regurgi
tation of past work, and it does little overall
to advance the group's musical foothold.
