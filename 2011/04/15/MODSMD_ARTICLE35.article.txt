Part action thriller, part charac
ter study, Hanna, the latest film
by director Joe Wright (best
known for "Pride and Prejudice" and
"Atonement") breaks genre bound
aries and provides a fresh take on the
typical Hollywood action film.
Hanna (Saoirse Ronan), a
teenager who has spent most of her
life living in a desolate arctic forest,
has been trained to be a ruthless
killer by her father, Erik Heller (Eric
Bana). After convincing her father
that she's ready to take on her
revenge mission the details of
which are slowly revealed over the
course of the movie she sets out
on a journey that takes her from the
arctic to the deserts of Morocco to
Germany. Her primary target is
Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a
corrupt and brutally efficient CIA
agent who forced Hanna and her
father into hiding years before the
beginning of the movie.
The compelling action
sequences bolster the film and punc
tuate its slower, more artistic scenes.
Supported by a throbbing techno
soundtrack, courtesy of the
Chemical Brothers, the action scenes
balance Hanna's raw emotions with

her brutality and her cold, calculat
ing demeanor. Set in environments
that feel almost unreal, and employ
ing a lot of shaky camera use a la the
"Bourne" trilogy, the action scenes
are thrilling and yet still convey the
strong human element that is often
missing in most run-of-the-mill
action films.
Of course, these scenes would be
nothing without Saoirse Ronan to
carry them. The young actress
expresses fear, rage and happiness
with the most subtle of expression
changes. She expertly handles the
transition from cold action sequences
to more warmhearted exchanges
between other characters, conveying
both Hanna's maturity and lack of
knowledge about real-world life.
Cate Blanchett is also excellent as
the villain. She manages to combine a
down-to-earth southern accent with a
menacing smile and eerily perfect
teeth to create one of the most chill
ing movie villains in recent memory.
"Hanna" is also notable for its
gorgeous cinematography and atten
tion to detail. Fans of Joe Wright's

"Pride and Prejudice" and
"Atonement" will recognize a similar
style at play here long, lingering
close-ups, extended shots of nature
and forwardly thinking editing. Most
of the film is simply beautiful to look
at. These artistic elements propel
"Hanna" far beyond the realm of a
simple action flick it almost seems
more like a dark fairy tale.

Although the movie's momen
tum drags at times, with extended
scenes with side-characters or overly
long montages, its pacing is, for the
most part, solid as the story slowly
unfolds. Certain scenes of comic
relief, mostly centered around a vaca
tioning family with whom Hanna
takes refuge, provide welcome breaks
from the intense action.

By combining beautiful cine
matography with heart-pounding
action sequences, Joe Wright creates a
different kind of action movie that is
both visually stunning and emotion
ally satisfying.
