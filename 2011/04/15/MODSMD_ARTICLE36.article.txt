The title character of "Arthur,"
has a clever tongue that can
make a joke out of just about
anything, as well as a dazzling sense of
romance. Though it is a bit too long
and unrealistic, "Arthur" is a cute and

funny romantic comedy.
Arthur Bach (Russell Brand), the
sole heir to an unimaginably rich fam
ily business, is an overgrown 30-year
old child without a single worry in the
whole wide world. However, his care
free life, which involves damaging his
family's reputation in all ways possible,
abruptly ends when his mother gives
him an ultimatum: he must marry the
heiress Susan Johnson (Jennifer

Garner), a woman he has no feelings
for, or he will lose the family fortune.
Money and his lifelong nanny Hobson
(Helen Mirren) have been essential to
him. Without either, Arthur likely
would not have survived in the real
world. Thus, without a second
thought, Arthur jumps into the mar
riage trap. This is exactly when he
meets the love of his life, the happy
and hard-working Naomi. Caught
between his forceful fiancee, Susan,
and his true love Naomi, Arthur has to
make the single most important deci

sion he has ever faced.
At the beginning of the movie, a
terribly cliche Batman charade had
me almost convinced that this was just
another shallow film rife with cheap
humor. However, as the movie pro
gressed, it proved me wrong. Instead,
"Arthur" does a decent job of blending
humor, romance and emotion.
It is, firstly, a solidly funny movie.
Russell Brand lends his British accent
perfecdy to Arthur's comedic talents.
Arthur's also a romantic. With virtual

ly unlimited funds at his disposal,
Arthur, and the filmmakers, have no
trouble turning any romantic's wildest
dreams into reality. How about a can
dlelight dinner over a huge carpet of
rose petals in an empty Grand Central
Terminal with trampoline artists per
forming? No problem!
In light of its humorous nature,
one might find it a little surprising
that "Arthur" contains some moving
emotional elements. The revelations of
Hobsons' secret, of Arthur's lies and of
Naomi's subsequent heartbreak are
just a few examples of the conflicts the
movie aims to unravel.
One pitfall of the movie is that
such a love story seems to only exist in
fairytales. Despite an emotional depth
that the audience can truly relate to,
the story itself has a rather unrealistic

premise based upon the unbelievable
extent of Arthur's childishness, magi
cal and almost Cinderella-esque plot
developments and extreme extrava
gances such as a magnetic floating bed
that only a billionaire could dream of
affording. Thus, the lack of realism
might detract from the overall popu
larity of the movie.
A rather long film, "Arthur" cov
ers almost all the elements one can

expect from a movie: humor,
romance, family drama, conspiracy
and even cool special effects like the
fire-blasting Batman car. Unrealistic or
not, "Arthur" is still a cute treat for
those who like this sort of film.
