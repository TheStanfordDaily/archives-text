cc ■w ▼-our Highness," the lat-
V est collaboration
X. between director David
Gordon Green and screenwriter
actor Danny Mcßride, is a silly, styl
ized genre mash-up. Equal parts
medieval fairytale, adventure story
and buddy (read: stoner) flick, it
consistently settles for bawdy humor,
lacking the cleverness that drove
their previous film, "Pineapple
Express." Hilarity ensues; just don't
let your expectations run away from
you.
Set in a fictional faraway land,
"Your Highness" is a tale of two
brothers questing after love and the
security of their kingdom. Prince
Fabious, played by an overtly homo
erotic James Franco, is renowned for
his courage and chivalry, while his
younger brother, Thadeous
(Mcßride), prefers to spend his time
womanizing and smoking "herbs."
When the evil sorcerer Leezar
(Justin Theroux) crashes Fabious'
wedding and kidnaps his new bride,
Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), the
two princes immediately set out to
rescue her. Along the way, they

encounter Isabel (Natalie Portman),
a mysterious warrior who also has a
score to settle with Leezar. I won't
ruin the finer details of the quest,
but suffice it to say that the road to
Leezar's lair is paved with treachery,
pedophilic wizards, bar fights and a
tribe of grimy naked women that
bear a strong resemblance to Kesha.
Overall, "Your Highness" can
only be described as highly ridicu
lous, and I mean that with respect to
every sense of the word "ridicule."
While it functions well as a self-

aware comedy, its weak writing pre
vents it from rising to that upper
echelon of humor: parody. Whereas
"Pineapple Express," to which "Your
Highness" pays homage through
Thadeous's recreational use of
plants, cleverly exploited popular


culture and traditional narrative conventions, this new
iteration continually goes for, and achieves, cheap laughs.
Hence what begins as a spoof of the medieval quest grad
ually devolves into increasingly crass vulgarity (think the
"Scary Movie" franchise versus "Tropic Thunder").
But what the film lacks in wit, it more than makes up
for in titillating absurdity. For one thing, the amusement
of anachronistic uses of the F-word never wears off, par
ticularly when it results in novel phrases like the "fucken
ing," a reference to the prophecy by which Leezar taking
advantage of the virginal Belladonna will result in the
birth of a dragon that threatens to destroy the entire king
dom. The gaudy special effects also contribute to story's
ludicrousness, not only in the visual manifestation of
Leezar's magical powers, but also in the representation of
mythical creatures, such as an unusually horny minotaur.
While acting generally takes the backseat to the nov
elty of the story in movies like this, I would be remiss in
not acknowledging the mismatched cast. Franco and
Portman, both highly recognized this past awards season
for their roles in "127 Hours" and "Black Swan," respec
tively, go all out in "Your Highness." Franco s charm and
sexuality shine through as the kingdom's golden boy, but
Portman's portrayal is the most compelling, for as Isabel,
she successfully achieves that elusive combination of
female empowerment and bad-assness sans the sexual
objectification that most action movies can't seem to
avoid (including and especially the recent flop "Sucker
Punch"). Thadeous, on the other hand, is not so much an
actual character as Mcßride's usual comedic persona, only
this time with a British accent.
All told, "Your Highness" is an entertaining ride, at
times sidesplitting, and at others merely cringe-worthy.
The collision of genres is perpetually dysfunctional, but
perhaps therein lies the appeal. But if nothing else, the
film, which despite having wrapped production in 2009 is
only now hitting theaters, is a light-hearted vehicle for its
biggest stars, Franco and Portman, whose performances
remind us to never take anything too seriously.
