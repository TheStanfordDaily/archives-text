cc ■w ▼-our Highness," the lat-
V est collaboration
X. between director David
Gordon Green and screenwriter
actor Danny Mcßride, is a silly, styl
ized genre mash-up. Equal parts
medieval fairytale, adventure story
and buddy (read: stoner) flick, it
consistently settles for bawdy humor,
lacking the cleverness that drove
their previous film, "Pineapple
Express." Hilarity ensues; just don't
let your expectations run away from
you.
Set in a fictional faraway land,
"Your Highness" is a tale of two
brothers questing after love and the
security of their kingdom. Prince
Fabious, played by an overtly homo
erotic James Franco, is renowned for
his courage and chivalry, while his
younger brother, Thadeous
(Mcßride), prefers to spend his time
womanizing and smoking "herbs."
When the evil sorcerer Leezar
(Justin Theroux) crashes Fabious'
wedding and kidnaps his new bride,
Belladonna (Zooey Deschanel), the
two princes immediately set out to
rescue her. Along the way, they

encounter Isabel (Natalie Portman),
a mysterious warrior who also has a
score to settle with Leezar. I won't
ruin the finer details of the quest,
but suffice it to say that the road to
Leezar's lair is paved with treachery,
pedophilic wizards, bar fights and a
tribe of grimy naked women that
bear a strong resemblance to Kesha.
Overall, "Your Highness" can
only be described as highly ridicu
lous, and I mean that with respect to
every sense of the word "ridicule."
While it functions well as a self-

aware comedy, its weak writing pre
vents it from rising to that upper
echelon of humor: parody. Whereas
"Pineapple Express," to which "Your
Highness" pays homage through
Thadeous's recreational use of
plants, cleverly exploited popular
