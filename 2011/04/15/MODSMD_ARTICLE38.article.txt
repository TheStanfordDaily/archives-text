Fifteen years ago, there was a mo\
landscape that didn't include
"Scary Movie," "Shaun of the
Dead," "Date/Epic/Whatever
Movie" or really much of any
thing that mocked other movies. j
Sure, there were parodies, but
they were genre parodies —
never directly naming films
and never directly mimicking.
This all changed when the first
"Scream" was released. It was *§
the birth of a new age in cine
ma. In ohe swift move, it mocked
the horror genre, even then stale
with sequels, overturning all of the
silly rules that everyone knew but
never mentioned. At the same time,
it was scathingly funny, creating
memorable movie nerds, TV
reporters and a new villain. Soon
after, the sequel made fun of sequels,
the third movie commented on trilo
gies and now this fourth reboot?

It does so much more than
make fun of reboots. The story starts
10 years after Sidney Prescott (Neve
Campbell) was involved in the
Woodsboro Murders. Sidneys releas
ing her new memoir of her harrow
ing tale and returns to Woodsboro
where she reunites with former rival
Gale Weathers-Riley (Courteney
Cox) and her now-sheriff husband,
Dewey (David Arquette), the only
survivors from the original trilogy. As
soon as she arrives to home sweet
home, new murders set the town
afire again. This time, they not only
concern the three survivors, but a
new set of attractive teens led by
Sidney's niece Jill (Emma Roberts)
and her best friend Kirby (Hayden
Panettiere) as well.

What the "Scream" series has
always tried to do is balance the come
dy against the horror. In the first, they
succeed admirably. Here, you might
find yourself dying of laughter instead
of from fear. There are a lot of "oh,
thank goodness it's just a cat," type of
thrills, but there are also some truly
tense moments. Sidney is just as
resilient as ever, but watching her
thwart Ghostface while others die
around her is incredibly compelling.
The standouts from this film,
however, aren't the survivors. The sup
porting ensemble has a few really
quirky characters, desperately neces
sary against the washed up tropes.
Sidney's publicist (Alison Brie from
"Community") is an updated Gale
Weathers and hilariously redefines the
stereotypes set in place before. Best
friend Kirby has an edge that seems

exciting compared to some other
cookie-cutter characters. And then
there's Robbie (Eric Knudsen), the
new-and-improved A/V nerd who
films his whole life to be a webcast.
There's a lot of forward thinking
with technology and communication,
which ultimately leads the movie, well,
forward. The killer, who the average
moviegoer just might not be able to
predict, becomes obsessed with filming
the experience. The murders become
art, the communication becomes glob
al and the insanity is heightened. In

this hyper-connected Internet age, the
characters in the movie rely mostly on
cell phones and Internet access, where
as 15 years ago, owning a cell phone
was so rare it made you a prime sus
pect. The film exploits the limits our
society continues to push, but without
ever losing its humor.
Don't expect to be scared, and
don't expect to cry laughing. Just enjoy
the genre-defying ride.
