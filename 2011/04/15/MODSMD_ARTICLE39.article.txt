# ANGRY at 'BIRDS'

I'm willing to bet
that you've heard
of Angry Birds.
You've probably
played it, too. It's an
almost stupidly pop
ular phenomenon
since releasing on iOS
in Dec. 2009, it's sold
over 42 million
copies, been ported
to other platforms
and spawned a multi
tude of spin-offs.

According to developer Rovio, 40 million peo
ple play the game each month, and 3.33 mil
lion hours are spent playing Angry Birds every
single day.
My dad told me a few months ago
that he saw a businessman showing off Angry
Birds to a group of his colleagues. When I vis
ited my aunt over break, it was Angry Birds all
the time. Even as I write this column from a
dark corner of a psychology lecture, I can see a
girl a few seats away flinging irate poultry on
her iPod touch. It's everywhere.
That brings me to what might be a
more incredible accomplishment of Angry
Birds it's become a legitimate staple of pop
culture. In a world where literally dozens of
games fly under the radar each and every

week, Rovio's little game has managed to stick.
When I bring up Angry Birds, people know
what I'm talking about. That's more than I can
say about most of the games that have been
stealing my sleep over the past few years.
For such a giant, Angry Birds had
humble beginnings. Before Finnish developer
Rovio formed in 2003 by three students at
Helsinki University developed their mag
num opus, no one on this side of Atlantic (and
most people on the other) had ever heard of
them or their first obscure title, King of the
Cabbage World. A few years later, and demand
for Angry Birds was crashing websites when
the game was ported to the Android platform.
It makes sense why Angry Birds blew
up. It's simple, it's cute, you can play it in short
bursts and it's absurdly cheap the essential
formula for a good portable title. When it first

came out, I was all on board. It was hard to beat for just 99 cents,
and I loved that it was the brainchild of a few quirky
Scandinavians. And of course, anything that expands the industry
is good in my book.

But somewhere between embracing its unheralded, out-of
nowhere release and seeing it get a movie deal and game-of-the
year nominations, I've grown a little cold on Angry Birds (and
that's not just because they released a wintery holiday edition). I
don't want to take anything away from what Angry Birds has done
it's a solid title that almost single-handedly established the
iPhone as a viable, if not excellent, gaming platform. But even so, I
can't understand why it's so explosively popular. It's a simple,
repetitive game with a single, simple mechanic. You can succeed
with little more than trial and error, and there isn't really any pro
gression and meaningful variety as the game goes on.
Is that really enough for over 40 million people to be satisfied?
I know it's only a dollar, but something irks me when I see so
many people forking over their money for such a limited experi
ence. What gets under my skin more, though, is the all-too-likely
notion that Angry Birds constitutes many of these people's only
experience with video games. If that's the case, I'm a little worried
that our cultural concept of "video games" is getting a bit diluted.
Maybe it's a little elitist, but I don't want to see people 20 years
from now the same people who just made Angry Birds the
best-selling game on Play Station Network waxing nostalgic
about Angry Birds. I don't want to believe that for kids today,
Angry Birds is our parents' Pac-Man or a college kid's Super Mario
Kart.
Angry Birds is no doubt a defining game of this generation,
and with good reason. But its incredibly wide appeal gives many
people a woefully incomplete picture of the eclectic, complicated
and constantly changing world of games.
(By the way, my dad told those businessmen they were fooling
themselves with Angry Birds and told them to try a little game
called Peggie. I like to think I've trained him well.)
