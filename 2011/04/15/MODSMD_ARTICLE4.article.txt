# TOURNAMENT TUNE-UP

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After clinching the No. 3 seed in
the upcoming MPSF tournament
last weekend against UCLA, the
men's volleyball team wraps up the
regular season with a match at rival
No. 14 Pacific Saturday night in
Stockton.

No. 4 Stanford (18-8,14-7 MPSF)
will no doubt be trying to stay
healthy while still maintaining the
momentum gained from its sweep
of UCLA. Pacific (11-18, 5-16) has
struggled all season long, but is
gradually improving and hopes to
score the upset and stay out of the
MPSF cellar, a position it's held
since 2007.

The Tigers are coming off a nice
upset win over the same UC-Santa
Barbara team that knocked off
Stanford last weekend. They've also
secured upsets over CS Northridge
twice, and a road sweep of UC-San
Diego in all, Pacific has won five
of their last nine matches.
The Cardinal, on the other hand,
has been treading water. After a
five-game win streak before Spring
Break, Stanford is just 4-4. That in
cludes three weekend splits in
MPSF play, even though six of the
eight games were played on Stan-

ford's home court.
But Stanford hasn't lost to Pacif
ic in the past six matches, regardless
of where the match was played. In
the first meeting this year, on Feb. 2,
the Cardinal wore out the Tigers in
four sets, led by junior outside hitter

Brad Lawson's 23 kills and fresh
man outside hitter Brian Cook's 11
kills and .474 hitting percentage.

Lawson also leads the Cardinal
in overall kills, with 405 on the year,
although of the players that have at
least 50 attack attempts, freshman
middle blocker Eric Mochalski is
hitting a team-high .450.
Junior libero Erik Shoji is having
another solid campaign with 255
digs after two AVCA All-American
seasons in his first two years on the
Farm, and junior setter Evan Barry
has stepped into the big shoes of
graduated senior and AVCA Na
tional Player of the Year Kawika
Shoji Barry is third in MPSF play
with 11.38 assists per game.

Tomorrow's match holds no real
implications for Stanford's postsea
son aspirations, as the Cardinal can
not catch No. 2 BYU or No. 1 USC,
and cannot fall below No. 4 UC-
Irvine. Coach John Kosty plans to
use most of his roster, a tactic he's
used previously in games against
Division 111 opponents in order to
keep the bench players sharp while
resting the starters for the playoffs.
But Pacific's attack, led by red
shirt sophomore outside hitter Tay
lor Hughes and junior outside hitter

PACIFIC
(11-18,5-16 MPSF)

NOTES: Saturday's matchup with No. 1 4 Pa
cific has no playoff implications. No. 4 Stan
ford is already locked into the third seed in
the upcoming MPSF Tournament. But if the
Cardinal is to make a deep run through the
tournament and secure an NCAA bid, the
team will need to make good use of the op
portunity to fine tune the team's passing, at
tack, and defense.

Senior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin, above, is second on the
team in kills (366) and service aces (14). The No. 4 Cardinal will
rely heavily on McLachlin and junior outside hitter Brad Lawson
if it is to make a deep run in the upcoming MPSF Tournament.
