Though reality programming
would have us believe that
addicts, hoarders and real
housewives of a county near you
always perform their craziness, script
ed television functions on the oppo
site assumption that insanity per
colates beneath the surface only to
burst through for season finales.
"Nurse Jackie" began as a vehicle for
"Sopranos" virtuoso actress Edie
Falco, but, as networks try to confront
the crazy who walk among us ("Jersey
Shore," "Flipping Out"), cable and the
women behind "Nurse Jackie" ask
what we aren't noticing when they
walk by.
The season two finale of the hos
pital-as-second-home comedy (the
Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences' label, not mine) showed
Jackie's husband Kevin and best friend
Dr. O'Hara staging an intervention for
the show's heroine. The interaction,
necessary after 24 episodes of Jackie's

pill-popping, left her perspective
maddeningly opaque to even the
audience. The third season premiere
picked up where the intervention left
off and maintained Jackie's denial,
perhaps because Edie Falco does
"keep calm and carry on" so well.
Unlike reality television, this season
examines what happens when your
family and friends make good on
their intervention threats. Two sea
sons ago, we entered the world of
Nurse Jackie Peyton in medias res,
with pre-established friendships,
lovers and habits; now, she must
rebuild it all.
Jackie's proficiency as a nurse
often took a backseat to her volcanic
person life, but now her job is all she
has. Though the premiere establishes
that her position at All Saint's is
secure, the new tenor of her relation
ship with Dr. O'Hara, the most
skilled attending, leaves some of the
hospital closed off to Jackie. She still
knows how everything and everyone
functions, as exemplified by her
catching O'Hara at her favorite

restaurant, but she runs into a new
obstacle: the genuineness she boldly
trades her deceitfulness for, fails. The
narrative arcs of each season have
been structured around roadblocks
how will Jackie get drugs without
Eddie? What will happen to her
daughter if Jackie can't calm her?

Wdiat should Jackie do with O'Hara's

money if Kevin has rejected it? It's a
problem that Jackie subverts with
ingenuity and further performances.
In yet another roadblock,
Kevin's hot (in both senses of the
word) mess of a younger sister plants
herself in the Peyton home, herself
having been dumped by her pilot
boyfriend. I like that the sister will
pose a threat to Jackie's delicate
domestic veneer. As Jackie works
overtime to repair her relationships
with her husband, her children, her
best friend and her ex, the sister
swoops in to earn their unqualified
affection. I'm not enthused about the
impending sexual competition over
Eddie, Jackie's secret former lover
turned Kevin's best friend, because it
would represent a mash-up of two
plots from last season: Eddie
befriending Kevin and Coop stealing
Sam's girlfriend.
The centrality of deceit to the
show's conceit underlines its per
spective on women in the workplace
and the life of a nurse. Other por
trayals of nurses in medical dramas,
Jada Pinkett-Smith in "RN" and the

legion of anonymous actors on
"Grey's Anatomy" spring to mind,
describe them as unsung workhors
es, while show runners Liz Brixius
and Linda Wallem show the physical
and emotional demands of that role.
Shondra Wilson's doctors have time
to exchange witty repartee in eleva

tors and to exchange STDs in the
break room; Jackie hoards her free
moments to fuel up, not slow down,
with adrenaline coming from sex or
Percocet. Jackie is not unlike Cristina
Yang of "Grey's," whose absence
from the hospital this season crip
pled the show's narrative progress.
As frustrating as it is to see Jackie
and the writers gloss over the trauma
of an intervention, perhaps the
breakneck speed of the hospital envi
ronment necessitates it.
In its artificiality, "Nurse Jackie"
seeks to convey a truth of the human
condition so often diagnosed
through alternative programming.
From its whimsically animated titles
to the tap dance sequence in season
two, this show displays awareness of
its status as a television show with
out slipping into omnipotence. The
viewers are subject to the whim of
the writers, who are apparently sub
ject to this defiant heroine they have
created.
