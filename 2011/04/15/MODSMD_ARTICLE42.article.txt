## advice THE
						ART OF SEXILING 
### 
It's a hard knock life when you're
trying to get in a little hard
knockin', especially as a freshman
or as an unfortunate resident of any
other one-room
double/triple/quad/quint-if-you're
in-Columbae. Sexiling: you're either
homeless or heartless, Roxy always
says. (In her humble opinion, better
to be the heartless one who kicks out

the roommate unceremoniously in
order to get your own kicks.)
But why the sudden salience?

Roxy sees a pattern in spring quarter,
and it's a juicy one. Warm weather
leads to fewer clothes lead to sluttier
party outfits lead to a sharp increase
in the number of hookups and oh
so-happy endings. And while Roxy
definitely knows her way around cre
ative sexin' locales (she can't even sit
in a class in the history corner any
more without some Pavlovian reac
tion in the panties), she also knows
that beds were made for, yes, sleep
ing, but mostly for banging dur
ing which a roommate's unwelcome
presence can be quite the bonerkill.
As always, there are two sides to
the coin especially when it comes
to getting head and/or tail.
If you're the sexiler, take Roxy's
advice: as long as it doesn't totally
block your chance to bump and
grind, try to be gracious and consid
erate (trust Roxy one day you will
be the sexilee). Call up your honey
when the roommate's away at his
afternoon lecture (skyrockets in
flight...) or disappear early from
that frat party to get a couple hours
alone before his return.

Pro tip: for a more permanent
setup, play matchmaker between

your roommate and someone with a
single or at least a two-room double.

Best bets are seniors or residence
staff. Roxy needs a kitchen manager
to stock her right here, right now.
Please she's hungry.
If you're the sexilee, general
sympathy is on your side, so do as
Roxy does in such situations: take
advantage. Use the situation to call
up that warm body you've been eye
ing that is, only since Roxy's not
available and play the temporarily
homeless card. Any means justify the
ends if the end is a little (consensual)
roll in the hay.

But if you're of the more
schadenfreude-inclined type, there's
much fun to be had in stopping oth
ers' fun. Stay oblivious to subtle hints
from the roommate, play up the
third-wheel bit ("Hey guys, what're
you up to?!") and study in your
room for hours on end, insisting that
you "just can't reach the same pro
ductivity" in the lounge or the

library. Best bet? Bring back your
own ill-advised dormmate hookup
and turn the tables on them. Or for a
the-more-the-merrier solution, offer
to ease the awkwardness by turning
the third wheel into a third partici
pant. Three's a crowd Roxy's
favorite kind.
