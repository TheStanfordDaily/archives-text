# STUDENT GOV'T
## Exec-elect talks future plans Cruz, Mcgregor-Dennis elaborate on promises 
### ELLORAISRANI STAFF WRITER 
Last Saturday, Stanford students
elected Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 as the
2011-12 ASSU Executive. The his
tory and computer science majors,
respectively, beat out the Tenzin-
Vasquez and Hertz-Coggeshall
Family for Excellence slates.
The Daily sat down with Cruz
and Macgregor-Dennis to discuss
their administration's plans and in
terests.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can
you summarize in one sentence,
what you stand for and what you
hope to accomplish next year?

Michael Cruz (MC): I think what
we stand for is ... finding ways to
empower students to feel like
they're really part of the Stanford
community, and using the resources
of the ASSU Executive to give
them those opportunities.

Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
(SMD): Stanford 2.0 is about lever
aging social entrepreneurship, so
public service and measurement
along with technology and experi
ence, and trying to change Stanford
through all four of those.

TSD: How is the transition from
Angelina Cardona's administra
tion going to work?

SMD: Right now I think our transi
tion involves learning from the
ASSU members, but also very
much from other knowledge lead
ers around campus. So we're reach
ing out to people in the Manage
ment Science and Engineering de
partment, the Project Management
Institute at Stanford and different
organizations around campus to re
ally learn as much as possible in this
stage.

TSD: One complaint you hear
about the ASSU is that people say,
"I don't know what the ASSU does.
I know they're our government, but
I'm not sure what it does." Is there
anything in your platform that
could help tackle that issue?

SMD: It's about making specific
impacts [on] the particular stu
dent. So if you are a member of
MSAN and you receive funding
from the ASSU in Special Fees
every year, you probably have an
idea of what it does. If you're a fi
nancial officer, you probably have
an idea as well. The thing is that
sometimes it's hard for students to
realize that even though they're in
the student group, a lot of the
funding resources come from the
ASSU and Stanford's student gov
ernment. I think, one, it's increas
ing awareness about that. Two, in
terms of our platform points, it's
about specific things that affect a
student, such as the Cleantech
mentorship program, where it's
about taking students and way in
creasing the value-add.
TSD: You both have a lot of ASSU

experience, which has its benefits and
detriments. What do you think some
of the detriments are and how do you
plan on accounting for them?

SMD: I think when we talk about
ASSU experience, I don't really
see myself as an ASSU person. I've
been involved in a lot of other
things on campus, and I have been
a Senator this year so I have that
perspective as well. But both
Michael and I have been involved
in other things around campus.
And I think it's a value-added in
the sense that we can have that per
spective. The only thing I would say
is that we forget sometimes that
other students don't necessarily
have that perspective.

TSD: You guys have a huge plat
form. What's the first issue you're
going to tackle or the first step
you're going to take in making sure
that all of these visions can become
a reality?

MC: Our first step is the step that we
took this weekend, in bringing our
chief of staff onto our cabinet, so
we've published an application on
line.

SMD: I have no doubt that if we put
together the right team, we can ac
complish everything on that plat
form.

TSD: Out of all the ideas on your
slate, which is the most exciting, im
portant or innovative?

SMD: The things that I'm most ex
cited about are tech-related. I'm in
terested in leveraging some of the
skills that I have, such as [the fact]
that I took CSI93P and now can
make an iPhone app for the student
body.
TSD: What is the app?
SMD: The kind of end goal is that
you could create your student
group VSO on the iPhone app, and
then you'd be able to communicate
via text message, via email, Face
book, Twitter very easily with your
student group members.
MC: One initiative that we're work
ing on is to create databases for stu
dent groups and student leaders to
facilitate better communication

using things like the iPhone app,
Facebook, Twitter, websites to
better allow them to have a record
of how they've communicated, such
as, "I sent this email, and I got this
response, and this is how I can bet
ter outreach." Just filling in those
gaps where people sometimes fall
through.

TSD: One part of your platform
that grabbed a lot of attention was
your ideas about Stanford Dining.
Do you think they're feasible?

MC: Yes, I 100 percent think that
they're feasible . . . We've really
found R&DE excited about work
ing with us and making Stanford
Dining a better experience for stu
dents, like this idea of 24-hour or
continuous dining that we're plan
ning on working on.

SMD: I'd say the ideas themselves
are ambitious; the action plans are

rigorously feasible.
TSD: Can you each tell us some
thing interesting about yourself that
has nothing to do with your cam
paign or your platform?
SMD: During fall quarter, I started
the Stanford Quidditch Team.
MC: My thumbs can pop out.

sometimes it's hard for students to
realize that even though they're in
the student group, a lot of the
funding resources come from the
ASSU and Stanford's student gov
ernment. I think, one, it's increas
ing awareness about that. Two, in
terms of our platform points, it's
about specific things that affect a
student, such as the Cleantech
mentorship program, where it's
about taking students and way in
creasing the value-add.
TSD: You both have a lot of ASSU

experience, which has its benefits and
detriments. What do you think some
of the detriments are and how do you
plan on accounting for them?

SMD: I think when we talk about
ASSU experience, I don't really
see myself as an ASSU person. I've
been involved in a lot of other
things on campus, and I have been
a Senator this year so I have that
perspective as well. But both
Michael and I have been involved
in other things around campus.
And I think it's a value-added in
the sense that we can have that per
spective. The only thing I would say
is that we forget sometimes that
other students don't necessarily
have that perspective.

TSD: You guys have a huge plat
form. What's the first issue you're
going to tackle or the first step
you're going to take in making sure
that all of these visions can become
a reality?

MC: Our first step is the step that we
took this weekend, in bringing our
chief of staff onto our cabinet, so
we've published an application on
line.

SMD: I have no doubt that if we put
together the right team, we can ac
complish everything on that plat
form.

TSD: Out of all the ideas on your
slate, which is the most exciting, im
portant or innovative?

SMD: The things that I'm most ex
cited about are tech-related. I'm in
terested in leveraging some of the
skills that I have, such as [the fact]
that I took CSI93P and now can
make an iPhone app for the student
body.
TSD: What is the app?
SMD: The kind of end goal is that
you could create your student
group VSO on the iPhone app, and
then you'd be able to communicate
via text message, via email, Face
book, Twitter very easily with your
student group members.
MC: One initiative that we're work
ing on is to create databases for stu
dent groups and student leaders to
facilitate better communication

using things like the iPhone app,
Facebook, Twitter, websites to
better allow them to have a record
of how they've communicated, such
as, "I sent this email, and I got this
response, and this is how I can bet
ter outreach." Just filling in those
gaps where people sometimes fall
through.

TSD: One part of your platform
that grabbed a lot of attention was
your ideas about Stanford Dining.
Do you think they're feasible?

MC: Yes, I 100 percent think that
they're feasible . . . We've really
found R&DE excited about work
ing with us and making Stanford
Dining a better experience for stu
dents, like this idea of 24-hour or
continuous dining that we're plan
ning on working on.

SMD: I'd say the ideas themselves
are ambitious; the action plans are

rigorously feasible.
TSD: Can you each tell us some
thing interesting about yourself that
has nothing to do with your cam
paign or your platform?
SMD: During fall quarter, I started
the Stanford Quidditch Team.
MC: My thumbs can pop out.

Last Saturday, Stanford students
elected Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 as the
2011-12 ASSU Executive. The his
tory and computer science majors,
respectively, beat out the Tenzin-
Vasquez and Hertz-Coggeshall
Family for Excellence slates.
The Daily sat down with Cruz
and Macgregor-Dennis to discuss
their administration's plans and in
terests.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Can
you summarize in one sentence,
what you stand for and what you
hope to accomplish next year?

Michael Cruz (MC): I think what
we stand for is ... finding ways to
empower students to feel like
they're really part of the Stanford
community, and using the resources
of the ASSU Executive to give
them those opportunities.

Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
(SMD): Stanford 2.0 is about lever
aging social entrepreneurship, so
public service and measurement
along with technology and experi
ence, and trying to change Stanford
through all four of those.

TSD: How is the transition from
Angelina Cardona's administra
tion going to work?

SMD: Right now I think our transi
tion involves learning from the
ASSU members, but also very
much from other knowledge lead
ers around campus. So we're reach
ing out to people in the Manage
ment Science and Engineering de
partment, the Project Management
Institute at Stanford and different
organizations around campus to re
ally learn as much as possible in this
stage.

TSD: One complaint you hear
about the ASSU is that people say,
"I don't know what the ASSU does.
I know they're our government, but
I'm not sure what it does." Is there
anything in your platform that
could help tackle that issue?

SMD: It's about making specific
impacts [on] the particular stu
dent. So if you are a member of
MSAN and you receive funding
from the ASSU in Special Fees
every year, you probably have an
idea of what it does. If you're a fi
nancial officer, you probably have
an idea as well. The thing is that
sometimes it's hard for students to
realize that even though they're in
the student group, a lot of the
funding resources come from the
