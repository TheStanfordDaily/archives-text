## NYC takes center stage at Academic Council 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
President John Hennessy de
livered his annual address to the
Academic Council on Thursday
afternoon at the Jen-Hsun Huang
Engineering Center. At the meet
ing, the president touched upon
the state of finances and develop
ment on the Farm before launch
ing an hour-long discussion on
Stanford's proposed New York
City Applied Sciences Research
and Educational Campus.
Hennessy addressed finances
first, stating that the late-2000s
economic crisis served as the cata
lyst for a series of budgetary
changes. After the onset of the fi
nancial downturn, the University
set a new baseline budget, re
duced expenses and lowered its
payout.
"This reduced payout has al
lowed our endowment to recover
more quickly," Hennessy said.
Fiscal Year 2010 saw the Uni
versity successfully steer its en
dowment toward a 10-percent in
crease in value. This improvement
notwithstanding, the president ad
vocated vigilance and cautioned
that "past performance is not nec
essarily an indicator of future re
sults."
"The economic climate and re
duced federal research funding
remain significant concerns," he
said.
Hennessy lauded the Stanford
Challenge, now entering its final
six months, for its success in fos
tering excellence and leadership
the five-year campaign has
raised more than $5 billion, com
fortably exceeding its initial goal
of $4.3 billion. The Stanford Chal
lenge has enabled the University
to "provide cutting-edge facilities
in support of the pioneering

work" for which Stanford is
known, he said.

The president also gave the
Academic Council a preview of
construction projects that are set
to reach completion over the next
few years. Construction of the
Bing Concert Hall will wrap up
over the next year and a half, with
the first performances scheduled
for January 2013. The department
of Art and Art History will have a
new home in the McMurtry Build
ing, set to be designed by Diller
Scofidio + Renfro (DSR).The bi
ology building, currently on the
docket to replace Herrin Labs,
will be built between the Gates
Computer Science and Mudd
Chemistry buildings.
Hennessy quipped that he was
still waiting for an alumnus to fi
nance a restoration of the Old
Chemistry Building.

The Apple of Stanford's Eye
In late March, the University
formally submitted an expression
of interest to New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg for
the development of an engineer
ing and technology research and
graduate education campus there.
The city is scheduled to make a
final decision by the end of the
year.
"Like many other institutions,
we have received many invita
tions to consider setting up cam
puses and programs throughout
parts of the world, especially in
Asia," Hennessy said. "While we
are engaged as consultants and
partners with a number of institu
tions around the world, we have so
far chosen not to set up another
full-fledged Stanford campus, pri
marily because we were con
cerned that we could not establish
