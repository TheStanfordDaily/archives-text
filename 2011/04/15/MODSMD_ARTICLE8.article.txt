## NYC takes center stage at Academic Council 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
President John Hennessy de
livered his annual address to the
Academic Council on Thursday
afternoon at the Jen-Hsun Huang
Engineering Center. At the meet
ing, the president touched upon
the state of finances and develop
ment on the Farm before launch
ing an hour-long discussion on
Stanford's proposed New York
City Applied Sciences Research
and Educational Campus.
Hennessy addressed finances
first, stating that the late-2000s
economic crisis served as the cata
lyst for a series of budgetary
changes. After the onset of the fi
nancial downturn, the University
set a new baseline budget, re
duced expenses and lowered its
payout.
"This reduced payout has al
lowed our endowment to recover
more quickly," Hennessy said.
Fiscal Year 2010 saw the Uni
versity successfully steer its en
dowment toward a 10-percent in
crease in value. This improvement
notwithstanding, the president ad
vocated vigilance and cautioned
that "past performance is not nec
essarily an indicator of future re
sults."
"The economic climate and re
duced federal research funding
remain significant concerns," he
said.
Hennessy lauded the Stanford
Challenge, now entering its final
six months, for its success in fos
tering excellence and leadership
the five-year campaign has
raised more than $5 billion, com
fortably exceeding its initial goal
of $4.3 billion. The Stanford Chal
lenge has enabled the University
to "provide cutting-edge facilities
in support of the pioneering

work" for which Stanford is
known, he said.

The president also gave the
Academic Council a preview of
construction projects that are set
to reach completion over the next
few years. Construction of the
Bing Concert Hall will wrap up
over the next year and a half, with
the first performances scheduled
for January 2013. The department
of Art and Art History will have a
new home in the McMurtry Build
ing, set to be designed by Diller
Scofidio + Renfro (DSR).The bi
ology building, currently on the
docket to replace Herrin Labs,
will be built between the Gates
Computer Science and Mudd
Chemistry buildings.
Hennessy quipped that he was
still waiting for an alumnus to fi
nance a restoration of the Old
Chemistry Building.

The Apple of Stanford's Eye
In late March, the University
formally submitted an expression
of interest to New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg for
the development of an engineer
ing and technology research and
graduate education campus there.
The city is scheduled to make a
final decision by the end of the
year.
"Like many other institutions,
we have received many invita
tions to consider setting up cam
puses and programs throughout
parts of the world, especially in
Asia," Hennessy said. "While we
are engaged as consultants and
partners with a number of institu
tions around the world, we have so
far chosen not to set up another
full-fledged Stanford campus, pri
marily because we were con
cerned that we could not establish
a permanent presence with a co
hort of faculty and students whose
quality matched that of our home
campus."
But New York City, he said, is
different.

One potential advantage of a
NYC campus is having increased
visibility on the East Coast. A satel
lite campus could also connect the
University with new philanthropic
sources. Some Stanford researchers
and alumni already have a presence
in the Big Apple. And companies
such as Google, Yahoo, Hewlett-
Packard, Cisco, Sun Microsystems,
Netflix and eßay have established
branches there.
"New York has its own culture
and strengths, which are quite dif
ferent from those of our present
location, and fusing that culture
with the technical capabilities and
entrepreneurial culture of Stan
ford could produce a remarkable
new center for research, education
and innovation," Hennessy said.
For administrators, the oppor
tunity to build a multi-site campus
is enticing in and of itself. While
Stanford already is on the cutting
edge of distance education, Hen
nessy said universities with a pres
ence at multiple locations are the
way of the future.
The first phase of the NYC
campus involves a 25-member fac
ulty, 150 doctoral students and 300
master's students. Information
technology namely, electrical
engineering and computer science
would serve as the program's
anchor. Hennessy emphasized that
the School of Engineering, the
Graduate School of Business, the
Hasso Plattner Institute of Design
and the Stanford Technology Ven
tures Program would play a role at
the campus from its initial stages.
Subsequent phases would see
the East Coast campus expanding
to take in 100 faculty members and
2,000 students. There is also the
possibility of establishing an aca
demic quarter in New York for un
dergraduates, much like the cur

rent Stanford in Washington pro
gram.
Hennessy's address was fol
lowed by a panel featuring School
of Engineering Dean Jim Plum
mer, Computer Science Chair Jen
nifer Widom and Robert Reidy,
vice president for land, buildings
and real estate.
According to Plummer, there
are three questions to address at
present: whether a 21st century
university can have multiple loca
tions, whether telepresence sys
tems work well enough and
whether Stanford' entrepreneurial
spirit can be replicated elsewhere.
There is one challenge, howev
er, that seems to take precedence.
"The biggest part will be mak
ing the New York campus look,
feel and be part of us," Plummer
said.
Widom noted that it would take
her department "a while to ramp
up" for the transition to NYC, es
pecially with respect to hiring ad
ditional faculty members. She said
the computer science department
"will not lower its threshold to hire
faculty" for the Big Apple center
and that many CS professors have
expressed interest in teaching
there.
Reidy took the Academic
Council on a "visual journey" of
the potential Roosevelt Island site
for the NYC campus. The other
sites offered by the city of New
York were located in Staten Island,
Governors Island and the Brook
lyn Naval Yard.
"It is a special place in that is
oddly a place apart to the city but
closely adjacent," Reidy said of the
10-acre Roosevelt Island location.
He added that the University
was "quietly trying to pursue a
Manhattan location" for an alter
native site. The process of "com
paring and contrasting opportuni
ties" is important, Reidy said.
According to Hennessy, the op
portunity to try to recreate Silicon
Valley in New York is one that can
not be passed up.
"New York is the cultural capi
tal of the United States," he said.
But there's more to the city, too.
"As a native New Yorker, I'm
looking forward to the pizza," Hen
nessy added.

technology namely, electrical
engineering and computer science
would serve as the program's
anchor. Hennessy emphasized that
the School of Engineering, the
Graduate School of Business, the
Hasso Plattner Institute of Design
and the Stanford Technology Ven
tures Program would play a role at
the campus from its initial stages.
Subsequent phases would see
the East Coast campus expanding
to take in 100 faculty members and
2,000 students. There is also the
possibility of establishing an aca
demic quarter in New York for un
dergraduates, much like the cur

rent Stanford in Washington pro
gram.
Hennessy's address was fol
lowed by a panel featuring School
of Engineering Dean Jim Plum
mer, Computer Science Chair Jen
nifer Widom and Robert Reidy,
vice president for land, buildings
and real estate.
According to Plummer, there
are three questions to address at
present: whether a 21st century
university can have multiple loca
tions, whether telepresence sys
tems work well enough and
whether Stanford' entrepreneurial
spirit can be replicated elsewhere.
There is one challenge, howev
er, that seems to take precedence.
"The biggest part will be mak
ing the New York campus look,
feel and be part of us," Plummer
said.
Widom noted that it would take
her department "a while to ramp
up" for the transition to NYC, es
pecially with respect to hiring ad
ditional faculty members. She said
the computer science department
"will not lower its threshold to hire
faculty" for the Big Apple center
and that many CS professors have
expressed interest in teaching
there.
Reidy took the Academic
Council on a "visual journey" of
the potential Roosevelt Island site
for the NYC campus. The other
sites offered by the city of New
York were located in Staten Island,
Governors Island and the Brook
lyn Naval Yard.
"It is a special place in that is
oddly a place apart to the city but
closely adjacent," Reidy said of the
10-acre Roosevelt Island location.
He added that the University
was "quietly trying to pursue a
Manhattan location" for an alter
native site. The process of "com
paring and contrasting opportuni
ties" is important, Reidy said.
According to Hennessy, the op
portunity to try to recreate Silicon
Valley in New York is one that can
not be passed up.
"New York is the cultural capi
tal of the United States," he said.
But there's more to the city, too.
"As a native New Yorker, I'm
looking forward to the pizza," Hen
nessy added.
President John Hennessy de
livered his annual address to the
Academic Council on Thursday
afternoon at the Jen-Hsun Huang
Engineering Center. At the meet
ing, the president touched upon
the state of finances and develop
ment on the Farm before launch
ing an hour-long discussion on
Stanford's proposed New York
City Applied Sciences Research
and Educational Campus.
Hennessy addressed finances
first, stating that the late-2000s
economic crisis served as the cata
lyst for a series of budgetary
changes. After the onset of the fi
nancial downturn, the University
set a new baseline budget, re
duced expenses and lowered its
payout.
"This reduced payout has al
lowed our endowment to recover
more quickly," Hennessy said.
Fiscal Year 2010 saw the Uni
versity successfully steer its en
dowment toward a 10-percent in
crease in value. This improvement
notwithstanding, the president ad
vocated vigilance and cautioned
that "past performance is not nec
essarily an indicator of future re
sults."
"The economic climate and re
duced federal research funding
remain significant concerns," he
said.
Hennessy lauded the Stanford
Challenge, now entering its final
six months, for its success in fos
tering excellence and leadership
the five-year campaign has
raised more than $5 billion, com
fortably exceeding its initial goal
of $4.3 billion. The Stanford Chal
lenge has enabled the University
to "provide cutting-edge facilities
in support of the pioneering

work" for which Stanford is
known, he said.

The president also gave the
Academic Council a preview of
construction projects that are set
to reach completion over the next
few years. Construction of the
Bing Concert Hall will wrap up
over the next year and a half, with
the first performances scheduled
for January 2013. The department
of Art and Art History will have a
new home in the McMurtry Build
ing, set to be designed by Diller
Scofidio + Renfro (DSR).The bi
ology building, currently on the
docket to replace Herrin Labs,
will be built between the Gates
Computer Science and Mudd
Chemistry buildings.
Hennessy quipped that he was
still waiting for an alumnus to fi
nance a restoration of the Old
Chemistry Building.

The Apple of Stanford's Eye
In late March, the University
formally submitted an expression
of interest to New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg for
the development of an engineer
ing and technology research and
graduate education campus there.
The city is scheduled to make a
final decision by the end of the
year.
"Like many other institutions,
we have received many invita
tions to consider setting up cam
puses and programs throughout
parts of the world, especially in
Asia," Hennessy said. "While we
are engaged as consultants and
partners with a number of institu
tions around the world, we have so
far chosen not to set up another
full-fledged Stanford campus, pri
marily because we were con
cerned that we could not establish
a permanent presence with a co
hort of faculty and students whose
quality matched that of our home
campus."
But New York City, he said, is
different.

One potential advantage of a
NYC campus is having increased
visibility on the East Coast. A satel
lite campus could also connect the
University with new philanthropic
sources. Some Stanford researchers
and alumni already have a presence
in the Big Apple. And companies
such as Google, Yahoo, Hewlett-
Packard, Cisco, Sun Microsystems,
Netflix and eßay have established
branches there.
"New York has its own culture
and strengths, which are quite dif
ferent from those of our present
location, and fusing that culture
with the technical capabilities and
entrepreneurial culture of Stan
ford could produce a remarkable
new center for research, education
and innovation," Hennessy said.
For administrators, the oppor
tunity to build a multi-site campus
is enticing in and of itself. While
Stanford already is on the cutting
edge of distance education, Hen
nessy said universities with a pres
ence at multiple locations are the
way of the future.
The first phase of the NYC
campus involves a 25-member fac
ulty, 150 doctoral students and 300
master's students. Information
technology namely, electrical
engineering and computer science
would serve as the program's
anchor. Hennessy emphasized that
