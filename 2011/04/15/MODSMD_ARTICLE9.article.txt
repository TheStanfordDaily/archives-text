## Shaw probes 'diversity' effect in admissions 
### JANELLE WOLAK CONTRIBTING WRITER 
Last night, Dean of Undergradu
ate Admission Richard Shaw spoke
about the manner in which his of
fice looks at socioeconomic diversi
ty in a "fireside chat" at Branner
Hall.

The event is largely a response to
a student's letter to the First-Gener
ation Low Income Partnership
(FLIP) community what FLIP
co-president Michael Albada 'll
called a "raw, heart-wrenching ap
peal." The student spoke of how
being a low-income student alienat
ed him not only from his friends at
Stanford, but from his family back
home as well. The letter was for
warded to members of the adminis
tration like Shaw and was taken as "a
real issue of concern," Albada said.
In last night's fireside chat, Shaw
spoke briefly about the admissions
process in relation to Stanford's
commitment to socioeconomic di
versity and then addressed ques
tions students had submitted online
prior to the talk.
"I just want to tell you that
you're fantastic," Shaw said at the
start of his talk. "I think the role you
play as at Stanford is very impor
tant."

Shaw pointed to the four Stan
ford students who recently won
Marshall Scholarships. Three of the
winners are on financial aid and two
are the first in their family to go to
college, he said.
According to Shaw, unlike uni
versities like Harvard or Yale, Stan
ford was founded as a "university
for the people" that is "open and ac
cessible to all." Now, just as then,
Stanford's goal is to create a student
body that is representative of the
world, he added.

In the admissions process, Stan
ford looks at statistics like class sta
tus and SAT scores, he said. These
numbers are examined in the con
text of the student's experience.
"There is no formula," Shaw
said. "We take every candidate as a
singular consideration. We look at
what you've done with the re
sources you have."
Regardless, the admissions
process is a competitive one. When
shaping its new class of students,
Stanford looks for passion, depth
and breadth the students who
are the best in their community. But
the truth is that not all low-income
kids are competitive, Shaw said.

"That's a reflection on the na
tion," Shaw said. "We don't have a
great educational system. A lot of
kids are not getting the kind of edu
cation that would make them com
petitive."
At Stanford, nine percent of stu
dents come from families who earn
less than $60,000 a year, an income
group that constitutes more than 50
percent of the American popula
tion.

At the end of the discussion, stu
dents expressed appreciation for
Shaw's words.

"It's refreshing to meet the man,
the man who signed your admission
letter," saidTianay Puphus 'l3.
Some students, however, still felt
lingering concerns.

"It's a tremendous culture shock
coming here," Alba. "The financial
barrier is the most obvious barrier
[for low-income students] but the
least pressing one. We need to ad
dress the issue of belonging and
promote a greater sense of commu
nity and awareness."
