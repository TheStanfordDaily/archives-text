VAULTING
TO 100
Men's gymnastics earns
Stanford's 100th team title
By NATE ADAMS
MANAGING EDITOR
The wait is over.
After heartbreaking finishes in women's bas
ketball and soccer earlier in the academic year,
the Stanford athletics program has finally broken
through with its 100 th team NCAA title. That
honor comes courtesy of the men's gymnastics
team, which secured its second championship in
three years on Friday night at the NCAA Team
Finals in Columbus, Ohio.
Stanford breaks even
on Orange Bowl
By KABIR SAWHNEY and
ELLORA ISRANI
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the
football team's recent trip to the
Orange Bowl, according to offi
cials in the department. The
Daily was unable to independ
ently verify this figure, as Athlet
ics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other
financial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the
end of the day, with all things
being considered, we'll break
even," said Brian Talbott, chief
financial officer for Stanford
Athletics. "We broke even at
worst."
Officials within the Universi
ty's budget office, including Uni
versity CFO Randy Livingston,
did not comment on financial re
turns from the Orange Bowl and
directed all inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Vir
ginia Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3
game, held at Sun Life Stadium
in Miami Gardens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue
from its bowl trip through a pay
out from the Pacific-10 Confer
ence, which pools bowl revenue
from all of its teams and distrib
utes it to schools to cover bowl
related expenses, chiefly travel
and tickets. Stanford paid for
transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and
was required to cover 7,500 tick
ets — out of an allotment of
17,500 from the Orange Bowl
that it was unable to sell.
In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among
teams that participated in the
Bowl Championship Series
(BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last
year's Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, where it lost to Okla
homa, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for
any bowl to break even on a
strict revenue and expense basis,
in the hope that the fact that you
went to a bowl creates those an
cillary benefits," he said.
"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable
to profit directly from the Or
ange Bowl, Talbott pointed out
that playing in the game will
bring the athletics program a
wide range of benefits, many of
which are not quantifiable now
but could translate into financial
gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that
the Pac-10 gets as a payout; we
know what it costs us that
piece is easy," he said. "What's a
lot tougher is quantifying the an
cillary benefits: how many more
ticket sales we're going to get
this year than last year because

UNIVERSITY
Alan Garber
headed to
Harvard
Med school professor
chosen as new provost
By AN LE NGUYEN
MANAGING EDITOR
Professor of Medicine Alan
Garber M.D. 'B3 will sport crimson
rather than cardinal this fall as he
takes on the role of provost at Har
vard University in Cambridge,
Mass.
In his 25 years at Stanford, Gar
ber has distinguished himself be
yond the medical field, serving as a
professor (by courtesy) of eco
nomics, a senior fellow at the Free
man Spogli Institute (FSI) and
professor of economics at the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB). At FSI, he works as the di
rector of the Center for Health
Policy/Center for Primary Care
and Outcomes Research.
But come Sept. 1, Garber will
leave the sunny pastures of the
Farm for Harvard Yard a move
that will require "an entirely new
wardrobe," Garber said.
"This is an incredible opportu
nity, but it's also a bittersweet
one," he added. "My years at Stan
ford have been very satisfying .. .
but I do feel good about this move
mainly because I'm going to see
other friends at an institution I've
long had a connection with. The
role will be challenging and satis
fying."
Garber graduated from Har
vard College summa cum laude'm
1976 and received his Ph.D. in eco
nomics there in 1982. His appoint
ment, announced last week, arose
naturally from collaborations with
top administrators in Cambridge.
"It started with a conversation
that I had with Drew Faust, the
president of Harvard, about how
the provost position should be
configured," Garber said.
In their discussions, Garber and
Faust also broached the general
challenges that Harvard faces, no
tably issues faced by the university's
medical and dental schools and ob-
BioBlitz at Lake Lagunita
Stanford Strategies for Ecology
Education, Diversity and Sustainability
(SEEDS) hosted a BioBlitz at Lake
Lag on Saturday, designed to assess
the biodiversity of the area. The
group also hoped engage the Stanford
community with the ecology
there.
BioBlitz is a "rapid" biodiversity assessment
of an area that takes place
in a single day. Mattias Lanas '11,
president of SEEDS, pointed out multiple
advantages to such an assessment,
including the ability to compare
results from different years.
"The emphasis is definitely on the
Stanford community, since Lake Lagunita
belongs to Stanford, and we wish
to promote ecology awareness locally,"
Lanas said. "BioBlitz serves as a
wakeup call to the community, saying
'Hold on, there are amazing critters
living right in your backyard. You just
need to come out and find them!'"
He added that the event had
three overarching goals: to spread
ecological awareness about the rich
array of biota on the Farm, to collect
data on the organisms living here
and to promote citizen science
among the Stanford community.
"We want people to learn why it's
important to conserve this area,Æ
he said.

STUDENT LIFE
Campaign
to divest
relaunched
Push is the latest in
struggle started in 2007
By MATT BETTONVILLE
STAFF WRITER
Students Confronting Apartheid
by Israel (SCAI) has relaunched its
campaign to build student support
for divestment of the University's
endowment from companies that
SCAI says profit from human rights
violations against Palestinians.
SCAI plans to start at a grassroots
level to garner student support.
"We are morally bound to stop
making the harming of others prof
itable," said Cecilie Surasky, deputy
director of Jewish Voice for Peace,
of using divestment to combat per
ceived human rights violations.
Surasky was one of three panelists
at SCAI's presentation last Thurs
day to renew the divestment cam
paign it began in 2007. Approxi
mately 60 people attended the pres
entation.
The Israel-Palestine conflict has
been a divisive topic for decades,
and many are reluctant to directly
oppose or support either side. As a
result, SCAI's proposition calls for
selective divestment rather than di
vestment from Israel as a whole.
"We're not calling for divestment
from Israeli companies but rather
companies that violate human rights
laws," said current law student
Omar Shakir 'O7, the main speaker
at Thursday's presentation.
The criteria that SCAI presented
as warranting divestment include
operating on occupied land, facili
tating collective punishment and
supporting the building of a barrier
between Israeli and Palestinian
lands. According to SCAI, notable
companies that meet those criteria
include Motorola, Lockheed Mar
tin, Caterpillar and Veolia Trans
portation, which operates Stan
ford's Marguerite shuttle system.
Shakir pointed out Stanford's
past divestments from South Africa,
Darfur and the Democratic Repub
lic of the Congo as precedents for
