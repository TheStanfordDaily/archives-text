## IN THE THROES OF GOVERNMENT 
### SUZANNE STATHATOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although he might look innocuous with
his white button-down shirt, blue jeans
and clean-cut hair, no one would expect
that Cameron Percy 'O7, who recently
began master's studies in Stanford's
Public Policy Program, has sparked a controversy in
the California government.
He and his four group members Howard
Bornstein 'lO MPP, Stan Markuze 'lO MPP, Lisha
Wang 'lO M.A. International Policy Studies and
Moritz Zander 'lO M.A. International Policy Studies
caused a stir with their investigation into the sus
tainability of public pension funding in the state of
California.
The project came about when Schwarzeneg
ger's office approached Stanford's department of
public policy, asking a group of students to do an
independent academic assessment of the state of
California's public pension funds.
Percy's group decided to focus on the three
largest pension funds in the state the California
Public Employee Retirement System (CaIPERS),
the California State Teachers' Retirement System
(CaISTRS) and the University of California Retire
ment System (UCRS).They examined the account
ing practices of these three organizations to deter
mine their future liabilities and to analyze how
overfunded or underfunded they were.
The team used numbers from June 2008 to pre
dict the state of public pension funds in California
16 years into the future.
"As of June 2008, before everything crashed, we
concluded that CaIPERS, CaISTRS and UCRS had
a combined underfunding level of $425 billion over
the next 16 years," Percy said. To put it in perspec
tive, the state budget every year is about $B7 billion.
Because of his team's work on this study, Percy
was appointed by Schwarzenegger to the Cal-
STRS board. There are a total of 12 members on
this board: four ex-officio members, three teacher
elected members and five appointees. The board is
one of the largest institutional investors in the coun
try, collectively overseeing the administration of the
$l5O billion fund.
Members are appointees of the governor until
they go through a Senate confirmation process,
which can be held up to a year from the date of ap
pointment. However, before the hearing, Governor

Brown began his administration and subsequently
pulled Percy and another Schwarzenegger ap
pointee, Steven Kram, off of the CaISTRS board.
Joe Nation, professor of the practice of public
policy and the nominal faculty advisor for this proj
ect, speculated that Brown pulled Percy because
"the California Teachers Association, a big support
er of Brown's, said, 'We don't want this guy.' They
didn't want Cameron on the CaISTRS board ...
because Cameron had conducted a study conclud
ing that CaISTRS was severely underfunded."
CaISTRS and the teachers' unions didn't ap
prove of Percy's study, because they didn't want to
admit there was a problem. And Brown thought he
needed the backing of the teachers' unions in order
to gain support on the June ballot for his tax poli
cies, according to Nation.
Before Percy's study, CaIPERS and CaISTERS
"were understating their liabilities, overstating in
vestment return ... and doing transactions that
were just risky," said David Crane, lecturer in public
policy and former economic adviser to Governor
Schwarzenegger.
Now, Percy has temporarily suspended his stud
ies in public policy in order to work in downtown
Palo Alto.
Reflecting on his work, Percy said, "We uncov
ered something that really is fundamental to the
state's future and is something that we have to get
right... It was the order of magnitude of the prob
lem that everyone was surprised to see confirmed."
Because the state cannot default on pensions
promises it has already made, according to Crane,
its only option is to cut programming in other areas,
such as education.
"Fix number one is to understand the magnitude
of the problem," Nation said. "Second, I think the
thing to do is to sit down with stakeholders and say,
'Okay, now we know there's a problem; let's figure
out how we all collectively can solve it.'"
Percy said it is critical that the state be responsi
ble with how it sets money aside.
"In the long run, the world will probably look
very different for future employees," Percy said.
"The state just can't back itself into obligations that
it may not be able to pay at some point."
Percy said he is grateful to have had this "surpris
ing opportunity as a young person to become ac
quainted with this issue and continue to be involved
at a decision-making level outside of academia."
