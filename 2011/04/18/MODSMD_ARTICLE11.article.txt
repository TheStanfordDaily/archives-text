## EDITORIAL ASSU: What's Next 
### 
More than a week after
ASSU election results
have been released, we
are as relieved as any other stu
dents (except perhaps the candi
dates themselves) to be done with
our annual exercise in representa
tive government. Despite our re
luctance to protract conversation
on such a tired subject, the results
of these elections are enormously
compelling. In particular, this
Board notes the continued domi
nance of SOCC endorsees, a sharp
decline in graduate voter participa
tion and the ambiguity of the
ROTC vote. We also urge the next
generation of ASSU leaders con
sider these trends when they enter
office, and make good on their
campaign promises to improve stu
dent engagement and advocacy.
Senate Endorsements. This year,
the necessity of endorsements
evinced itself as never before, with
only one unendorsed candidate
winning a Senate seat. While this
newspaper has already noted that
several campus organizations
elected all of their Senate en
dorsees, we are most impressed by
SOCC's continued dominance in
absolute terms. Of 15 senators, 12
will be SOCC-affiliated next year,
the greatest number of co-affiliated
senators in recent ASSU history.
This is surely to SOCC's credit: no
other group even approaches its
ability to organize, communicate
and get out the vote. However, we
consider the dominance of any one
party troubling, and hope that next
year's Senate will consider the in
terests of all students. We also urge
other endorsing groups to look to
SOCC as a model for fighting gen
eral voter apathy.
Graduate Apathy. In a lively
election year that included the con
tentious Measure A and resulted in
a nearly 8 percent increase in un
dergraduate voter participation, it
is remarkable that the number of
graduate students who participat
ed in voting actually dropped by a
whopping 28 percent. Even more
staggeringly, candidates for Gradu
ate Student Council elections were
so sparse that a few spots even went
to write-in candidates who unwit
tingly won a handful of votes. We
believe that the absence of a grad
student candidate for Exec is the
only reasonable explanation for
this sudden drop-off in interest.
While Gobaud-de la Torre and
Peacock-Bakke both promised

grad student representation in the
ASSU Executive, this year's race
only saw undergraduate candi
dates.
Measure A: ROTC. After a ve
hement debate about Measure A
that included a constitutional ap
peal and an extensive "Campaign
to Abstain," more students voted
"yes" than "no" or "abstain," pass
ing by a margin of more than 2:1.
However, when also considering
the number of students who voted
to abstain on the measure, fewer
than 50 percent of students voted in
favor of ROTC's return. If any
thing, we believe that these results
demonstrate that students are
eager to defer the ROTC matter to
the University.
Lessons for the New ASSU.
Though endorsement groups now
wield a more potent influence than
they ever have, we challenge the
13th Undergraduate Senate to
grow together as a whole and move
forward with initiatives that benefit
the entire student body. If they are
to disabuse the electorate of their
superfluity, the new Senate must
find ways to publicize their work
and resist the temptation to grand
stand or become ensnared in inter
nal fiddling. Close collaboration
with the Executive team is also nec
essary for a cohesive and effective
ASSU.
Likewise, we congratulate the
new Executives and challenge
them to identify and articulate
what students care about most pas
sionately. Amidst their platform of
more than 100 initiatives and goals,
President Cruz and Vice President
Macgregor-Dennis would do well
to focus their energies on a core set
of priorities.
As ASSU leaders, the Executive
is granted the privilege of regular
access to high-level University ad
ministrators. Throughout their
tenure, the new Executives should
find ways to ensure that the
restoration of VPSA and VPUE
budgets to pre-recession levels be
on the forefront of the minds of ad
ministrators who shape Stanford's
annual budget. Our campus has felt
the loss of these frontline staff
those in Student Affairs and Un
dergraduate Advising and Re
search, who previously worked
with students every day and
every student would benefit from
bringing them back.
