# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### 
Dear Editor,
In reading Brenda Barnes' state
ments on the Stanford Daily on
April 14 ("CPRN responds to radio
sale concerns"), I realized something
very important to keep in mind and
that is: in this messy fight between
the entertainment community, its
corporate rivals and the FCC, it is
easy for misinformed statements to
be made.
Unfortunately, it is even easier for
readers to believe that misinforma
tion.
Representatives of large entities
should know better than anyone the
facts they state publicly which is
why their words, true or not are
generally consumed by the public as
informed, competent and accurate.
I think it is appropriate to clear up
this grand misconception through
one detail that has been incorrectly
stated twice. That detail is the "10
percent of those working at KUSF
were students" falsity stated by
Brenda Barnes.This gross underesti
mation was used as an excuse to sell
our beloved radio station. When Fr.
Privett first stated that number at the
community meeting the day after
the sale, the community and volun
teers knew it was a wrong estimate,
but beyond booing, the crowd at the
time, had no counter-argument.
The only people with the numeri
cal knowledge of student volunteers
were the personnel directors/re
cruiters and the program coordina

tors making the schedules. Neither
Fr. Privett, Brenda Barnes nor any of
their constituents, ever asked any
one at KUSF for these numbers.
How they derived that information
is unknown, but it can be insinuated,
that the number was guessed out of
convenience and assumption that in
their power, their statements would
not be debated.
I would like to debate them now
with more correct numbers to set the
record straight. KUSF's Program
Coordinator the last few years, Brian
Springer, has stated, "From the last
schedule written for KUSF 90.3fm,
33 percent of the staff were from the
USF student body." This is the num
ber of students who had radio shows
and does not include the students
who were still volunteering, working
their way up to having radio shows.
In addition, I was a Personnel Di
rector for two years at KUSF. At the
start of each semester, when we re
cruited the most (because USF was
not helping promote our station),
there were on average 15 new stu
dent volunteers. I looked through
our Personnel records and found
that from Aug. 2007 through Jan.
2010, the Personnel Directors (my
self, Toby Suckow and Danielle
Serna) recruited 171 new volunteers,
of which approximately 95 were stu
dents. On average per year, there
were 30 students introduced to vol
