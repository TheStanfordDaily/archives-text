# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Dear Editor,
In reading Brenda Barnes' state
ments on the Stanford Daily on
April 14 ("CPRN responds to radio
sale concerns"), I realized something
very important to keep in mind and
that is: in this messy fight between
the entertainment community, its
corporate rivals and the FCC, it is
easy for misinformed statements to
be made.
Unfortunately, it is even easier for
readers to believe that misinforma
tion.
Representatives of large entities
should know better than anyone the
facts they state publicly which is
why their words, true or not are
generally consumed by the public as
informed, competent and accurate.
I think it is appropriate to clear up
this grand misconception through
one detail that has been incorrectly
stated twice. That detail is the "10
percent of those working at KUSF
were students" falsity stated by
Brenda Barnes.This gross underesti
mation was used as an excuse to sell
our beloved radio station. When Fr.
Privett first stated that number at the
community meeting the day after
the sale, the community and volun
teers knew it was a wrong estimate,
but beyond booing, the crowd at the
time, had no counter-argument.
The only people with the numeri
cal knowledge of student volunteers
were the personnel directors/re
cruiters and the program coordina

tors making the schedules. Neither
Fr. Privett, Brenda Barnes nor any of
their constituents, ever asked any
one at KUSF for these numbers.
How they derived that information
is unknown, but it can be insinuated,
that the number was guessed out of
convenience and assumption that in
their power, their statements would
not be debated.
I would like to debate them now
with more correct numbers to set the
record straight. KUSF's Program
Coordinator the last few years, Brian
Springer, has stated, "From the last
schedule written for KUSF 90.3fm,
33 percent of the staff were from the
USF student body." This is the num
ber of students who had radio shows
and does not include the students
who were still volunteering, working
their way up to having radio shows.
In addition, I was a Personnel Di
rector for two years at KUSF. At the
start of each semester, when we re
cruited the most (because USF was
not helping promote our station),
there were on average 15 new stu
dent volunteers. I looked through
our Personnel records and found
that from Aug. 2007 through Jan.
2010, the Personnel Directors (my
self, Toby Suckow and Danielle
Serna) recruited 171 new volunteers,
of which approximately 95 were stu
dents. On average per year, there
were 30 students introduced to vol
unteering at KUSF. Out of approxi
mately 200 total volunteers an
nounced in our program guides, in
cluding cultural producers/commu
nity members, 30 per year add an
other 15 percent of student involve
ment. Total, that's 48 percent, not 10.
One other detail I'd like to point
out is Brenda Barnes' quote, "I
doubt Stanford wants to sell the sta
tion. We don't want to take a station
away from someone who doesn't
want to sell."
When Fr. Privett was questioned
in January about announcing KUSF
for sale, he contradicted Barnes'
statement by saying, "We took no
initiative to dispose of the radio sta
tion. We were approached, and we
responded positively."
It is this lack of precise informa
tion that is leading to a demise of the
media format this new generation is
looking to for knowledge. Unfortu
nately, we're not debating over
loose celebrity gossip. These 'facts'
have aided in bringing down a 34-
year-old radio station. In numbers,
Stanford has nothing to worry
about in regards to KZSU. Howev
er, I'd like to call on Stanford stu
dents to make sure they're not being
lied to about their station not being

solicited, or about anything else.

Dear Editor,
I have four letters for you:
KDFC.
These four letters were not men
tioned once in either of your recent
articles on KZSU's recent fit of
paranoia.
KDFC is a San Francisco-based
classical music station. Until recent
ly, it served the entire Bay Area. It
was started in 1946 and eventually
became one of the most popular
classical stations in the country
(and in the Bay Area, one of the
most popular stations, period). It
has worked closely with the San
Francisco Symphony and the San
Francisco Opera, providing live
broadcasts of concerts. It was the
last commercial classical station in a
major U.S. city.
In January, its owners, Entercom
Communications, decided to get rid
of KDFC and replace it with a clas
sic rock station. This was not for a
lack of listeners according to Ar
bitron, KDFC had more than
600,000, more than any other local
Entercom station but because it
was more difficult to find advertisers
for a classical station.
Rather than shut down the sta
tion, the staff of KDFC decided to

move it to a non-profit, listener-sup
ported format like other classical
stations have done around the coun
try. For whatever reason, presum
ably because of their experience in
the field, they chose USC as a part
ner for the financial support needed
to make this possible.
As their corporate owners re
tained the station's frequency and
broadcasting equipment, KDFC
was forced to quickly acquire new
signals in order to keep broadcast
ing. This included both KUSF and
KNDL, a Christian station. KDFC
now has a hodgepodge of weak sig
nals with spotty coverage. It current
ly cannot serve the South Bay or
much of the East Bay, because the
power of its broadcasts has been
greatly diminished. Their recent
transmitter move was an attempt to
improve their coverage in the East
Bay and on the peninsula. They are
looking for a location to serve the
South Bay but need to wait until
someone is willing to sell.
Contrary to Haddon's claim, the
Stanford bubble is stronger than
ever.This story is not about USC try
ing to send pro-Trojan messages
through our airwaves or disrupt
KZSU's signal. This is about the
preservation of a San Francisco in
stitution that has served the Stan
ford community, among many oth
ers, for decades.
