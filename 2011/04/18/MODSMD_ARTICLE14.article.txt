# No FREE LUNCH
## Because Offices Can Go Anywhere 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
It's no secret that living on the Row has its perks. Lo
cation wise it can't be beat, and when it comes to the
campus social scene, you're in the center of nearly
everything. From frat parties, to Wednesday nights at
EBF or Kairos, to parties at Casa and Xanadu, to Exot
ic Erotic at 680 or hanging out around Columbae's fire
pit most of the campus social scene seems to be fo
cused around the Row.
This might simply be because of the location; maybe
if you tore down all of the Row and replaced it with
Suites, the space would be just as social and energetic,
but we think there's something else at play. Just living in
a house makes a difference eating, cooking and
cleaning with your housemates in co-ops and self-ops
create a stronger sense of community and promote the
urge for fun.
This energy is one of the great things about Stanford.
Not that there is anything wrong with wanting a quieter
corner of campus and not that other dorms and locales
around Stanford don't throw down as well, but the Row
taken as a whole contributes hugely to Stanford's abili
ty to be a fun, social and energetic campus. We pride
ourselves on that, on our ability to excel at one of the
best research universities in world while still knowing
when to put aside the problem-set, open up a beer (or
age-appropriate EANAB) and celebrate going to
school here.
So it follows that these houses are among the most
sought-after assignments in the world of Stanford
housing. Places like Mars and Xanadu are typically
filled with those who received low tier-one draw num
bers, and there was more than a 36 percent increase in
those trying to pre-assign into co-ops this year.
Housed sororities and fraternities are in high demand,
and some of the un-housed Greek organizations
would give many members' left arms for a house of

their own it's common knowledge that Chi Omega
has been, and is, fighting tooth and nail for a house of
their own.
Given all of this, it seems obvious that the Universi
ty should do all that it can to promote a vibrant Row
life. It is in high demand and serves as the social epicen
ter of campus. So why, over the years, has the number of
Row houses been limited? Ask anyone who was here in
the 60's and 70's about the Row and Animal House
style stories aside there were simply more student
residences. The answer is pretty simple: as the Universi
ty grew, and there was demand for new space, tradeoffs
had to be made. Row houses were converted to office
space or demolished altogether. This is understandable,
but considering the constant rhetoric on campus about
student housing and strong residential communities, it
seems like these would have been treated more like ac
tual priorities.
For instance, why is the Row Office located in the
Lausen Row Center, a beautiful house in a prime loca
tion at the bottom of the upper Row? They keep a plant
in a shower because nobody uses it anymore, and what
once were residential rooms have been hastily trans
formed into offices offices that could be located any
where on campus. Any student on campus would glad
ly choose to walk or bike a few more minutes whenev
er they had to visit the Row housing office in exchange
for a few more beds on the Row.
The same goes for Serra House (the Clayman Insti
tute for Gender Research), Mariposa House (the Facul
ty and Staff Help Center) and Rogers House (the


Bridge Peer Counseling Center), all
located across from FloMo, where
Mayfield turns. The Bridge has a le
gitimate reason for wanting to be
near a population center on cam
pus, but the others could easily be
moved to less residential areas with
out a hit to their productivity. Even
the Bechtel International Center
right across from FloMo if you, like
the majority of campus, have never
been there would be an excellent
location for student housing.
And what exactly to put in any
or all of these new houses? Let the
students decide. Do we want more

theme houses, co-ops, Greek hous
es or general Row houses? If we did
it right, we could have one of each
and bring more students towards
the center of campus.
The University needs to realize
something all of these resource
centers and accessible services etc.
are great, but in terms of our lives,
they are trivial compared to who we
live with, what the atmosphere at
lunch and dinner is and who the
person down the hall is. We should
be using the limited space we have
on the Row in the smartest way
possible. After all, offices can go
anywhere.
