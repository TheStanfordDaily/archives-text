# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## A 						Statement Against LGBT Bullying 
### Cristopher Bautista 
The past Friday was Day of Si
lence, a nationwide move
ment where high school and
college students across the country
remain silent for the entire day in
order to make people aware of the
bullying of LGBT youth. I have par
ticipated in Day of Silence every
year I have been at Stanford. It is an
important day for me, every year.
Every Day of Silence reminds me of
where I come from.
I admit every Day of Silence I
find myself getting a bit depressed.
Consciously not talking for an ex
tended period of time not only
makes people aware of what you're
doing, but it also leads to a lot of
time in my head, thinking about
things.
I don't really think about my

days when I was younger. I don't re
ally like thinking about it. I was a
victim of bullying. In elementary
school, the other kids made fun of
me because I was different both
they and I did not quite know how I
was different, but they just knew I
was and ostracized me for it. During
recess, I ended up sitting by myself
and reading a book rather than
playing with the other kids. In mid
dle school, a girl called me a faggot
and told me I was going to hell. This

went on for several months.
In high school, I had a group of
friends who were emotionally abu
sive and made me feel awful about
myself. (When I got into Stanford,
instead of congratulating me, one of
my friends remarked the only rea
son the school accepted me wasn't
because I was smart, but because I
was gay, and they had to fill their
"gay quota." Good times, good
times.) But regardless of how badly
they treated me, I would've much
rather had awful friends than have
had no friends at all.
I suffered from low self-esteem
because of my experiences. I mean,
after being told you were weird, and
different and that you didn't de

serve to be happy for years and
years, you're more likely than not to
believe it. I got depressed, even sui
cidal, throughout my school years.
This idea that I was a bad person
pervaded every part of my con
sciousness my evilness was
something I believed was a fact,
more than anything.
It wasn't until I got to college
that things changed. For once, I
was respected, even appreciated.
No one was trying to beat me down
for me being smart. Nobody was
trying to bash my identity of being
gay or trans. People actually liked
me for who I was. And it was a
strange, sudden change and some
thing that I'm still not used to yet.
I admit now, I'm still struggling
with these same issues. When I'm
feeling depressed, those bad
thoughts creep in, tell me that I'm
a bad person and that I don't de
serve to be happy.
I stopped speaking to my high
school friends during my first year
of college. I attempted to reconcile
with them during the summer be
tween my junior and senior year.
One particular girl the most
emotionally abusive of them all
attempted to bully me into submis
sion again. By that time I had man
aged to salvage some self-esteem,
and I finally realized how awfully
they had treated me, and I wouldn't
tolerate it any longer. When she
saw that I was finally standing up
for myself, she ended up calling to

threaten me in the middle of the
night and sent me a long email
cussing me out and telling me re
peatedly that I was a horrible per
son (she even cc'ed my other
friends in the e-mail in order to an
nounce my horribleness to the
world). My other friends, who I
thought would stand up for me,
said nothing. I called them, asked
for help, but they did not answer
my calls or my texts. I haven't
talked to them since, and they
haven't made the effort to contact
me either. It was a rather traumatic
experience that I still haven't
worked through yet. Flonestly, if
your friends stand idly by while
someone's bullying you, they aren't
worth being friends with in the first
place.
Nobody deserves to be bullied.
Nobody deserves to get their hu
manity mocked and ridiculed, just
because somebody doesn't fit in
with what's considered "normal."
It's bullying that gets LGBT kids
depressed, makes them feel worth
less, makes them think that maybe
they're better off dead. And I hon
estly thought that way at that point
in my life. It was terrifying.
During my years of college, I've
managed to find a small slice of
happiness for myself, but I can't say
the same for those kids still in
school. This column is for them.
This column is to give them hope,
to show them somebody that's also
been bullied but turned out all
right. I know it hurts. I hurt then
too. But things will be okay. Trust
me.

recess, I ended up sitting by myself
and reading a book rather than
playing with the other kids. In mid
dle school, a girl called me a faggot
and told me I was going to hell. This

went on for several months.
In high school, I had a group of
friends who were emotionally abu
sive and made me feel awful about
myself. (When I got into Stanford,
instead of congratulating me, one of
my friends remarked the only rea
son the school accepted me wasn't
because I was smart, but because I
was gay, and they had to fill their
"gay quota." Good times, good
times.) But regardless of how badly
they treated me, I would've much
rather had awful friends than have
had no friends at all.
I suffered from low self-esteem
because of my experiences. I mean,
after being told you were weird, and
different and that you didn't de

serve to be happy for years and
years, you're more likely than not to
believe it. I got depressed, even sui
cidal, throughout my school years.
This idea that I was a bad person
pervaded every part of my con
sciousness my evilness was
something I believed was a fact,
more than anything.
It wasn't until I got to college
that things changed. For once, I
was respected, even appreciated.
No one was trying to beat me down
for me being smart. Nobody was
trying to bash my identity of being
gay or trans. People actually liked
me for who I was. And it was a
strange, sudden change and some
thing that I'm still not used to yet.
I admit now, I'm still struggling
with these same issues. When I'm
feeling depressed, those bad
thoughts creep in, tell me that I'm
a bad person and that I don't de
serve to be happy.
I stopped speaking to my high
school friends during my first year
of college. I attempted to reconcile
with them during the summer be
tween my junior and senior year.
One particular girl the most
emotionally abusive of them all
attempted to bully me into submis
sion again. By that time I had man
aged to salvage some self-esteem,
and I finally realized how awfully
they had treated me, and I wouldn't
tolerate it any longer. When she
saw that I was finally standing up
for myself, she ended up calling to

threaten me in the middle of the
night and sent me a long email
cussing me out and telling me re
peatedly that I was a horrible per
son (she even cc'ed my other
friends in the e-mail in order to an
nounce my horribleness to the
world). My other friends, who I
thought would stand up for me,
said nothing. I called them, asked
for help, but they did not answer
my calls or my texts. I haven't
talked to them since, and they
haven't made the effort to contact
me either. It was a rather traumatic
experience that I still haven't
worked through yet. Flonestly, if
your friends stand idly by while
someone's bullying you, they aren't
worth being friends with in the first
place.
Nobody deserves to be bullied.
Nobody deserves to get their hu
manity mocked and ridiculed, just
because somebody doesn't fit in
with what's considered "normal."
It's bullying that gets LGBT kids
depressed, makes them feel worth
less, makes them think that maybe
they're better off dead. And I hon
estly thought that way at that point
in my life. It was terrifying.
During my years of college, I've
managed to find a small slice of
happiness for myself, but I can't say
the same for those kids still in
school. This column is for them.
This column is to give them hope,
to show them somebody that's also
been bullied but turned out all
right. I know it hurts. I hurt then
too. But things will be okay. Trust
me.
