# Standard of Proof
## 
### 
On April 12, President Hen
nessy released an executive
order to lower the standard
of proof from "Beyond a Reason
able Doubt" to "Preponderance of
the Evidence" in cases on sexual as
sault and relationship abuse. The de
cision came on the heels of Vice
President Biden's stern call to U.S.
universities to better account for
campus sexual violence.
This decision comes as a great joy
to me, considering how much of my
term as ASSU Chair of Women's Is
sues was spent lobbying both Uni
versity administrators and the Stan
dard of Proof Subcommittee of the
review process to lower the standard
to "Preponderance of the Evi
dence." Much of our discourse cen
tered on civil rights.Title IX (a feder
al provision aimed to protect female
students from gender discrimina
tion) states that a university's judi
cial process should not have a stan
dard higher than "Preponderance of
the Evidence" when handling sexual
assault and domestic violence cases.
Stanford, by virtue of receiving con
siderable funding from Title IX,
should have heeded to the regula
tions provided by Title IX.
We also brought up the issue of
how our high standard differed from
those used in domestic violence
courts. In these cases, courts use a
standard of "Preponderance of the
Evidence," or about a 51 percent
chance that the assault or abuse oc
curred. And in these cases, people
are often at risk of prison sentences.
However, at Stanford, the most that
can happen is expulsion from the
University, not nearly the same pun

ishment. As such, our former system
of "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"
was wholly inappropriate when con
sidering how actual criminal courts
prosecute sexual assault and rela
tionship abuse.
Now, as an advocate of survivors, I
am elated that this change has hap
pened. By having such a stringent
standard for sexual misconduct
cases, survivors of sexual assault and
relationship abuse were being de
terred from pursuing the process,
given the difficult standards they
were required to meet. However, al
though this change will improve the
University's response to violence
against women, it comes decades
late in terms of adequately address
ing University response to sexual vi
olence. This point is made even more
explicit, considering how campus
sexual assault has become an epi
demic and how the culture of silence,
both among students and university
administrators across the country,
has been widely publicized.
Instead, many University institu
tions have centered many of their
policies on the popular but mistaken
myth that accusations of sexual as
sault or domestic abuse are lies on
the part of women. While it may be
the case that some accusations are
unfounded, this occurs in less than 2
percent of overall cases. Instead, this
myth perpetuates not only a nega
tive view of women and their testi
mony but contributes to the hesitan
cy that many survivors feel in coming
out with their experiences of abuse.
It is little surprise, then, that over
60 percent of sexual assaults are un
reported. And it's not hard to see
