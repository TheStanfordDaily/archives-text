why, considering how many women
are re-victimized once they decide
to come forward and seek justice
with stereotypes and assumptions
that call into question their morality,
past sexual history and degree to
which they may or may not have re
sisted.
Having a lower standard of proof
will circumvent many of these issues.
It will require of those deciding on a
sexual assault case to be conscious of
how contentious these cases can be,
the history that has allowed for an
unequal balance of power based on
gender and how to better under
stand the fact that sexual violence
rests more on consent and less on the
traditional paradigm of struggle and
physical evidence.
Lastly, attention must be directed
to how the new standard of proof

will function in conjunction with the
standard of proof as set by the ASSU
Constitution (which has "Beyond a
Reasonable Doubt" as its standard
for both Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard cases). As it cur
rently stands, Judicial Affairs and the
ASSU Constitution have differing
standards, an issue that could bring
liability to Judicial Affairs cases. I
would strongly encourage the in
coming ASSU Executive and ASSU
Senate to make the lowering of the
ASSU Constitution's standard of
proof to "Preponderance of the Evi
dence" a priority, to be effective as
soon as possible.
While it is problematic that
Stanford's strict standard of proof
for sexual assault cases lasted as
long as it did, I celebrate the admin
istration for realizing the harm that

policies like "Beyond a Reasonable
Doubt" were catalyzing for sur
vivors of sexual violence and abuse.
And while the change is a cause for
celebration, much work remains to
be done. I encourage administra
tors and students alike to call for
further reforms within Judicial Af
fairs, particularly policies like a
standard sanction and increased
sensitivity training for University
staff. Most of all, I encourage stu
dents to become advocates against
violence against women. Educate
yourself and others and stand up to
violence or gender discrimination.
The changing of the standard of
proof is a victory for anyone who
believes in eradicating sexual vio
lence from college campuses.
