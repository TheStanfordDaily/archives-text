## SWEET ENDING Card beats Cal, wins Pac-10 title 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
With a resounding 5-2 victory
over No. 9 California this past Sat
urday, the No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team clinched the Pac-10 reg
ular season title, perhaps the first of
many titles the Cardinal could bring
home this year.
Stanford (23-0, 8-0 Pac-10) re
mains the nation's only undefeated
team in Division I women's tennis,
with 42 consecutive wins going back
to February of last year. This is the
third straight Pac-10 regular season
title for the women, including the
shared league title in 2008 with
UCLA.

"It was a really unique ex
perience for me," said freshman
Nicole Gibbs. "Not a lot of people
get to come in to such a successful
season their first year. Kristie and I
really enjoyed playing in the lineup
and being able to contribute consis
tently to the team's successes.
Everyone was really proud of the
effort we put in to get there."
The match proved to be a state
ment day for a number of reasons.

With its defeat of No. 9 Cal (16-6,6-
2), the Cardinal has now earned
wins over five top-10 teams. That's
one more than the No. 1 Florida
Gators, who only have four wins
over top-10 squads. Since the
Gators are only ranked above the
Cardinal due to strength of sched
ule, surely this must help Stanford's
case of returning to the top spot.
On a more individual level, the
nation's No. 2 team of senior Hilary
Barte and sophomore Mallory Bur
dette pulled off the upset of Berke
ley's top-ranked team of Mari An
dersson and Jana Juricova.The final
score of 8-6 gave credence to the ar
gument that Barte and Burdette
should be America's top-ranked
pair.
Cal initially took a 1-0 lead in
doubles when No. 34 Annie Gorans

son and Anett Schutting defeated
No. 37 Kristie Ahn and Gibbs, 8-2, on
the second court. Stanford leveled
the score after senior Carolyn
McVeigh and sophomore Stacey Tan
bested Cal's Marina Cossou and
Tayler Davis, 8-3. Barte and Bur
dette's upset clinched the doubles
point before the team began singles
Play-
Tan, a sophomore ranked 55th in
the nation, played a beautiful sin
gles match to be first off the court,
winning 6-2,6-2 over Cossou. Ahn,
the nation's No. 22 player as just a
freshman, put Stanford within one
point of clinching the match after
coming off her court with a 6-3,6-0
win.
Up 3-0 and on the brink, Stan
ford lost its first point when No. 25
Andersson edged No. 19 Burdette,
6-4,6-4. Any momentum the Gold

en Bears could have hoped to gain
from their win, though, was taken
away after Gibbs clinched the
match and the Pac-10 title
with a 6-2,6-4 win over Schutting.
"I didn't even realize what hap
pened," Gibbs said. "I thought,'Oh,
we beat Cal,' not 'Oh, we just
clinched the Pac-10'. After Frankie
told me that I clinched, I felt really
good but also just proud of our team
and everything we've done this sea
son."
California and Stanford split the
last two points, as Veronica Li de
feated No. 48 Davis 6-3,6-4, and top
ranked Juricova defeated the
fourth-ranked Barte 1-6,6-3,6-4 in
the day's only three-setter.
It didn't feel that much different
from any other dual match," Gibbs

the fact that we haven't even had
any 4-3 victories this year. We're just
going get our business done, and
that's the end of it."

With a resounding 5-2 victory
over No. 9 California this past Sat
urday, the No. 2 Stanford women's
tennis team clinched the Pac-10 reg
ular season title, perhaps the first of
many titles the Cardinal could bring
home this year.
Stanford (23-0, 8-0 Pac-10) re
mains the nation's only undefeated
team in Division I women's tennis,
with 42 consecutive wins going back
to February of last year. This is the
third straight Pac-10 regular season
title for the women, including the
shared league title in 2008 with
UCLA.

"It was a really unique ex
perience for me," said freshman
Nicole Gibbs. "Not a lot of people
get to come in to such a successful
season their first year. Kristie and I
really enjoyed playing in the lineup
and being able to contribute consis
tently to the team's successes.
Everyone was really proud of the
effort we put in to get there."
The match proved to be a state
ment day for a number of reasons.

With its defeat of No. 9 Cal (16-6,6-
2), the Cardinal has now earned
wins over five top-10 teams. That's
one more than the No. 1 Florida
Gators, who only have four wins
over top-10 squads. Since the
Gators are only ranked above the
Cardinal due to strength of sched
ule, surely this must help Stanford's
case of returning to the top spot.
On a more individual level, the
nation's No. 2 team of senior Hilary
Barte and sophomore Mallory Bur
dette pulled off the upset of Berke
ley's top-ranked team of Mari An
dersson and Jana Juricova.The final
score of 8-6 gave credence to the ar
gument that Barte and Burdette
should be America's top-ranked
pair.
Cal initially took a 1-0 lead in
doubles when No. 34 Annie Gorans

son and Anett Schutting defeated
No. 37 Kristie Ahn and Gibbs, 8-2, on
the second court. Stanford leveled
the score after senior Carolyn
McVeigh and sophomore Stacey Tan
bested Cal's Marina Cossou and
Tayler Davis, 8-3. Barte and Bur
dette's upset clinched the doubles
point before the team began singles
Play-
Tan, a sophomore ranked 55th in
the nation, played a beautiful sin
gles match to be first off the court,
winning 6-2,6-2 over Cossou. Ahn,
the nation's No. 22 player as just a
freshman, put Stanford within one
point of clinching the match after
coming off her court with a 6-3,6-0
win.
Up 3-0 and on the brink, Stan
ford lost its first point when No. 25
Andersson edged No. 19 Burdette,
6-4,6-4. Any momentum the Gold

en Bears could have hoped to gain
from their win, though, was taken
away after Gibbs clinched the
match and the Pac-10 title
with a 6-2,6-4 win over Schutting.
"I didn't even realize what hap
pened," Gibbs said. "I thought,'Oh,
we beat Cal,' not 'Oh, we just
clinched the Pac-10'. After Frankie
told me that I clinched, I felt really
good but also just proud of our team
and everything we've done this sea
son."
California and Stanford split the
last two points, as Veronica Li de
feated No. 48 Davis 6-3,6-4, and top
ranked Juricova defeated the
fourth-ranked Barte 1-6,6-3,6-4 in
the day's only three-setter.
It didn't feel that much different
from any other dual match," Gibbs
