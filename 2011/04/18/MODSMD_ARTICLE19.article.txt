# CARDINAL POUNDS PACIFIC
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Having already clinched the No. 3 seed in the
MPSF Tournament with a win over UCLA last
weekend, the No. 4 Cardinal could have mailed in a
result in the regular season finale against Pacific
Saturday night. Instead, Stanford came out swing
ing, and junior outside hitter Brad Lawson had one
of his best performances of the season with 23 kills,
nine digs, two blocks and a .556 hitting percentage
on the way to a 3-1 victory.

Stanford (19-8,
15-7) took the first
game, 25-23, as Law
son and senior out
side hitter Spencer
McLachlin got hot

early. After junior
setter Evan Barry started the game off with an ace,
Lawson smashed a kill to start a run where he and
McLachlin combined for kills on nine of Stanford's
13 points.
The Tigers battled back and pulled within two
points at 21-19, but Lawson and McLachlin finished
the game off with three kills in the last six points. The
Cardinal hit .361 in the first game, and while Pacific
hit a solid .305 for the match, Stanford's defense was
just good enough.
"It's all about rhythm," said Stanford head coach
John Kosty. "Tonight was the start of our tourna
ment push."
Set two saw Pacific grab an early lead and build
it to five points at 19-14 before Stanford rallied and
cut the deficit to one at 21-20. The teams traded
points for the rest of the game, with Stanford blow
ing a 24-23 lead and Pacific missing on its own game
point before a Lawson service error and an attack
error by McLachlin tied the match at one set apiece.
But after the break, the Cardinal came out fo
cused, shutting down the small crowd of 324 as it
rolled to a five-point victory in game three and a
runaway 25-16 win in the fourth game Stanford
used a five-point run to take a seven-point lead
early and never looked back.
Stanford now heads into the MPSF Tournament
with a two-game win streak, the team's longest since
before spring break. The Cardinal will face No. 6-
seeded Long Beach State, a team that gave Stanford
fits in the regular season. The No. 8 49ers (14-10,12-
10) swept the season series and also won the first
matchup, 3-0.
The Cardinal will look to freshman middle
blocker Eric Mochalski and junior middle Gus Ellis
to neutralize Long Beach's balanced attack. Six
players on the 49er roster have at least 100 kills, led
by Jim Baughman's 305.
But it was Kyle Friend who keyed the 49ers 3-0
victory in the first meeting between the teams on
Jan. 29, with 11 kills and a .500 hitting percentage.
Long Beach is no stranger to upsets this year,
with several wins over teams ranked in the top-5 of
the AVCA national rankings besides Stanford.
Then-No. 2 UC-Irvine and then-No. 3 Pepperdine
both fell victim to the 49ers. And although Long
Beach could not get past No. 2 BYU two weeks ago,
the 49ers finished up the regular season with two
straight wins over UC-San Diego and Cal State
Northridge.
It will be a big advantage for Stanford to play at
home, where the Cardinal is 10-4 Long Beach is
just 5-6 on the road.

Senior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin, left, got hot in his final regular season game at the collegiate
level as Stanford dominated Pacific in a 3-1 win in Stockton, Calif, on Saturday. The Honolulu
native had 21 kills in the match, behind only Brad Lawson's game-high mark of 23.
"In the MPSF playoffs, you're
going to face a quality opponent,"
Kosty said. "Coming into this
weekend, we knew it would be
Long Beach or UC-Santa Bar
bara, a team we split with and
needed to rally from two sets
down to beat. We're all evenly
matched teams."
The battle to win the MPSF will
begin with the quarterfinals on Sat
urday, April 23. Other matchups in
clude No. 1 USC hosting UCLA,
BYU hosting UC-Santa Barbara
and UC-Irvine hosting Hawaii. The
semifinals are scheduled for Thurs
day, Apr. 28 and the MPSF Final
the winner of which receives an au
tomatic berth into the NCAA
Championships will be held at
the site of the higher-seeded team
on Saturday, Apr. 30.
Stanford needs to make a mem
orable appearance in the MPSF fi
nals if not win the tournament
outright to have a chance at one
of the at-large bids into the
NCAAs, and will look to the veter
an leadership of Lawson, McLach

the next two weeks.

game, 25-23, as Law
son and senior out
side hitter Spencer
McLachlin got hot

early. After junior
setter Evan Barry started the game off with an ace,
Lawson smashed a kill to start a run where he and
McLachlin combined for kills on nine of Stanford's
13 points.
The Tigers battled back and pulled within two
points at 21-19, but Lawson and McLachlin finished
the game off with three kills in the last six points. The
Cardinal hit .361 in the first game, and while Pacific
hit a solid .305 for the match, Stanford's defense was
just good enough.
"It's all about rhythm," said Stanford head coach
John Kosty. "Tonight was the start of our tourna
ment push."
Set two saw Pacific grab an early lead and build
it to five points at 19-14 before Stanford rallied and
cut the deficit to one at 21-20. The teams traded
points for the rest of the game, with Stanford blow
ing a 24-23 lead and Pacific missing on its own game
point before a Lawson service error and an attack
error by McLachlin tied the match at one set apiece.
But after the break, the Cardinal came out fo
cused, shutting down the small crowd of 324 as it
rolled to a five-point victory in game three and a
runaway 25-16 win in the fourth game Stanford
used a five-point run to take a seven-point lead
early and never looked back.
Stanford now heads into the MPSF Tournament
with a two-game win streak, the team's longest since
before spring break. The Cardinal will face No. 6-
seeded Long Beach State, a team that gave Stanford
fits in the regular season. The No. 8 49ers (14-10,12-
10) swept the season series and also won the first
matchup, 3-0.
The Cardinal will look to freshman middle
blocker Eric Mochalski and junior middle Gus Ellis
to neutralize Long Beach's balanced attack. Six
players on the 49er roster have at least 100 kills, led
by Jim Baughman's 305.
But it was Kyle Friend who keyed the 49ers 3-0
victory in the first meeting between the teams on
Jan. 29, with 11 kills and a .500 hitting percentage.
Long Beach is no stranger to upsets this year,
with several wins over teams ranked in the top-5 of
the AVCA national rankings besides Stanford.
Then-No. 2 UC-Irvine and then-No. 3 Pepperdine
both fell victim to the 49ers. And although Long
Beach could not get past No. 2 BYU two weeks ago,
the 49ers finished up the regular season with two
straight wins over UC-San Diego and Cal State
Northridge.
It will be a big advantage for Stanford to play at
home, where the Cardinal is 10-4 Long Beach is
just 5-6 on the road.

4/16, Stockton, Calif.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Senior outside hitter Spencer McLachlin, left, got hot in his final regular season game at the collegiate
level as Stanford dominated Pacific in a 3-1 win in Stockton, Calif, on Saturday. The Honolulu
native had 21 kills in the match, behind only Brad Lawson's game-high mark of 23.
"In the MPSF playoffs, you're
going to face a quality opponent,"
Kosty said. "Coming into this
weekend, we knew it would be
Long Beach or UC-Santa Bar
bara, a team we split with and
needed to rally from two sets
down to beat. We're all evenly
matched teams."
The battle to win the MPSF will
begin with the quarterfinals on Sat
urday, April 23. Other matchups in
clude No. 1 USC hosting UCLA,
BYU hosting UC-Santa Barbara
and UC-Irvine hosting Hawaii. The
semifinals are scheduled for Thurs
day, Apr. 28 and the MPSF Final
the winner of which receives an au
tomatic berth into the NCAA
Championships will be held at
the site of the higher-seeded team
on Saturday, Apr. 30.
Stanford needs to make a mem
orable appearance in the MPSF fi
nals if not win the tournament
outright to have a chance at one
of the at-large bids into the
NCAAs, and will look to the veter
an leadership of Lawson, McLach

lin and senior captain Jordan Ina
fuku to keep the team focused for
the next two weeks.
