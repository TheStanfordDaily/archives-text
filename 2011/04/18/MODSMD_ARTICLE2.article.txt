# VAULTING TO 100
## Men's gymnastics earns Stanford's 100th team title 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
The wait is over.

After heartbreaking finishes in women's bas
ketball and soccer earlier in the academic year,
the Stanford athletics program has finally broken
through with its 100 th team NCAA title. That
honor comes courtesy of the men's gymnastics
team, which secured its second championship in
three years on Friday night at the NCAA Team
Finals in Columbus, Ohio.

"I am ecstatic that men's gymnastics was
the team to reach the 100 th title for Stan
ford," said Stanford head coach Thorn Gliel
mi. "It is an incredible achievement for Stan
ford and the fact that it was men's gymnastics
that won it is just icing on the cake,"
Stanford scored a remarkable 363.450 in
the team finals, edging out runner-up Okla
homa (361.600) and third-place Illinois
(360.150).
That final mark came despite a less-than
stellar start in Friday's first event, the parallel
bars. After scoring the NCAA's best score of
the year with 61.500 in Thursday's preliminar
ies, the Cardinal posted a solid but unremark
able 59.950 on Friday. Redshirt sophomore
Cameron Foreman and senior Ryan Lieber
man led Stanford with scores of 15.200 in the
event for Foreman, it was a career best.
Next was the horizontal bar, where Stan
ford showed why it was the NCAA leader in
the event entering Friday's meet. The Cardi
nal recorded a score of 59.300, led by senior
Alex Busaglia's mark of 15.400, which tied for
the best score of the night.
Stanford came through with a season-best
effort on the floor exercise, which may have
pushed the team over the edge in the final
standings. Sophomore Eddie Penev's mark of
15.950 helped his team secure the NCAA's
second-best floor score at 62.450, while sen
iors Josh Dixon,Tim Gentry and Buscaglia all
posted scores of 15.300 or above.
The Cardinal struggled a bit on the pom
mel horse and still rings, but pulled into a

comfortable lead in the vault. Lieberman and
redshirt junior Abhinav Ramani boosted
Stanford into the lead with vault scores of
15.850 and 15.950, respectively. Dixon,
Buscaglia and Gentry then all but secured
Stanford's victory with marks of 16.000,
16.350 and 16.250.
With the win, the Stanford squad captured
its fifth title in program history the others
came in 1992, 1993, 1995 and 2009. Glielmi,
who took over as head coach in 2003, now has
two championships.
Stanford is just the second school in histo
ry to boast 100 team championships, behind
UCLA's nation-best mark of 106. The title
also continues a remarkable streak for Stan
ford, which has won at least one NCAA
Championship for 35 years.
The men's gymnastics team wasn't quite
done, as members of the team returned to ac
tion on Saturday for the NCAA Individual
Championships. Buscaglia led the way, taking
home his first-ever individual title on the hor
izontal bar. He wasn't alone in earning com
mendations, as six Cardinal gymnasts earned
a total of nine All-America honors.
As the NCAA leader on horizontal bar for
nearly the entire season, Buscaglia lived up to
his reputation with the lights-out score of
15.750, winning by nearly half a point. Adding
to a career night, Buscaglia earned All-Amer
ica honors on the parallel bar with a sixth
place score of 14.400.
Gentry had a phenomenal night as well, earn
ing a remarkable three All-America honors

with top-eight finishes on the rings, vault and
floor exercise. The senior now has seven All-
America honors in his career.
Dixon and Penev added to their All-Ameri
can totals with fourth- and fifth-place finishes
on the floor exercise, while Foreman and
freshman Chris Turner became first-time Ail-
Americans on the parallel bars and pommel

horse, respectively.
The meet marks the end of an incredible sea
son for Stanford, which regained its title as
NCAA champion and established its pro
gram as one of the best in recent history.

Championships. Buscaglia led the way, taking
home his first-ever individual title on the hor
izontal bar. He wasn't alone in earning com

a total of nine All-America honors.
As the NCAA leader on horizontal bar for
nearly the entire season, Buscaglia lived up to
his reputation with the lights-out score of
15.750, winning by nearly half a point. Adding
to a career night, Buscaglia earned All-Amer
ica honors on the parallel bar with a sixth
place score of 14.400.
Gentry had a phenomenal night as well, earn
ing a remarkable three All-America honors

with top-eight finishes on the rings, vault and
floor exercise. The senior now has seven All-
America honors in his career.
Dixon and Penev added to their All-Ameri
can totals with fourth- and fifth-place finishes
on the floor exercise, while Foreman and
freshman Chris Turner became first-time Ail-

horse, respectively.
The meet marks the end of an incredible sea
son for Stanford, which regained its title as
NCAA champion and established its pro
gram as one of the best in recent history.
