# "Spoiled" fans in San Fran?
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
What makes a sports
fan spoiled? Or
rather, which sports
fans are generally
spoiled? I've been
asking myself these questions recently,
thanks in large part to the sudden prolif
eration of San Francisco Giants fans
that have appeared at the beginning of
this baseball season, in which the Giants
will try to defend their World Series title.
Giants fans are popping up every
where these days. Everyone seems to be
a Giants fan. People who just moved the
Bay Area, people who don't know the
rules of baseball and even some Oak
land A's fans are all touting the defend
ing world champions as heroes. And
many of the Giants fans that predated
the World Series championship have
become entirely incorrigible. They are
miserable to talk baseball with, as every
conversation turns back to either some
reminder that yes, the Giants won the
2010 World Series, some comment
about how Brandon Belt or some other
Giant prospect is the second coming of
Babe Ruth or their own man-crush on
Tim Lincecum or Brian Wilson and his
beard.
During my first four years at Stan
ford, I passively rooted for the Giants.
Now this year I'm getting close to active
ly rooting againstt he Giants, simply be
cause of those fans —but is that fair?
I'm a New York Yankees fan. In my
lifetime, the Yankees have won five
World Series championships, including
the World Series immediately prior to
the Giants' championship. Maybe I'm
missing something, or maybe I'm naiVe,
but I really don't believe that Yankees
fans' reactions to their championships
were as intolerable.There is an "act like
you've been there before" attitude.
This is actually not meant as a criticism
of Giants fans or Yankees fans. It is just a
discussion of the mindset of fans of dif
ferent teams. Are Yankees fans spoiled
because their team has won 27 titles?
Probably. Is that a good thing? I think it
depends on what you consider' 'good." I
hope the Yankees win the World Series
every season, but even if they did, each
one would still be as sweet.
The Giants, on the other hand, hadn't
won a World Series since 1954 when
they still played in New York,so perhaps
their fans' enthusiasm, even if it is often
obnoxious, is justified pleasure.
Going back to the initial question,
who is spoiled? I think a good way to
look at this is by city. Bay Area sports
fans aren't spoiled whatsoever. In fact,
prior to the Giants World Series cham
pionship, professional teams in the Bay
Area had been decidedly mediocre for
some time (the exception being the San
Jose Sharks, who have been good, but
have combusted in the playoffs year
after year).
New York fans are another story.
New York is a pretty good place to be a
sports fan, but I wouldn't say New York
fans are spoiled.The Yankees are a heck
of a team to root for but somehow
this year is the first time since 1997 that
both the New York Rangers and New
York Knicks are in the playoffs at the
same time. Both have been overspend
ing and underperforming for years. Yes,
the New York Giants and New York
Jets are normally pretty good, but they
are by no means the class of the league.
So what other cities have strong
cases to be called spoiled children?
Philadelphia and Boston come to mind.
In recent years the Phillies, Flyers and
Eagles have all been near the top of
their respective leagues, while the Sixers
remain competitive. Boston, ever since
the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series,
has had an embarrassment of riches
with the Patriots, Bruins and Celtics all
competing for championships along
side their peers on the baseball dia
mond.
On the other hand, what cities have
the toughest luck when it comes to
sports? I know there are lots of bitter
fans lining up to be on this list. Obvious
ly Cleveland immediately comes to
mind.The Browns are consistently very
bad, the Indians have been bad for a
while now, the city doesn't have a hock
ey team and you may have heard that
some guy named Leßron James threw
a knife in Cleveland's back on his way
out of town to Miami, burying the Cav
aliers.
Life is bad elsewhere, however. I
wouldn't want to be a sports fan in
Seattle. "Sure, the Cleveland Cavaliers
stink," Seattle fans would say but at

least they have a team! The Superson
ics were jettisoned to Oklahoma City a
few years ago, and the city's two re
maining franchises, the Seahawks and
the Mariners, are both substandard.
Kansas City fans can't be too happy ei
ther. Kansas City has two teams: the

Royals, who haven't been to the play
offs since 1985, and the Chiefs, who
haven't won a playoff game since Jan
uary of 1994.
What's the moral of the story? If you
ask me, sports fans will always want
more, but in most cases things can be a
lot worse.

ball fans. Remind him of the Mets at

Bay Area, people who don't know the
rules of baseball and even some Oak
land A's fans are all touting the defend
ing world champions as heroes. And
many of the Giants fans that predated
the World Series championship have
become entirely incorrigible. They are
miserable to talk baseball with, as every
conversation turns back to either some
reminder that yes, the Giants won the
2010 World Series, some comment
about how Brandon Belt or some other
Giant prospect is the second coming of
Babe Ruth or their own man-crush on
Tim Lincecum or Brian Wilson and his
beard.
During my first four years at Stan
ford, I passively rooted for the Giants.
Now this year I'm getting close to active
ly rooting againstt he Giants, simply be
cause of those fans —but is that fair?
I'm a New York Yankees fan. In my
lifetime, the Yankees have won five
World Series championships, including
the World Series immediately prior to
the Giants' championship. Maybe I'm
missing something, or maybe I'm naiVe,
but I really don't believe that Yankees
fans' reactions to their championships
were as intolerable.There is an "act like
you've been there before" attitude.
This is actually not meant as a criticism
of Giants fans or Yankees fans. It is just a
discussion of the mindset of fans of dif
ferent teams. Are Yankees fans spoiled
because their team has won 27 titles?
Probably. Is that a good thing? I think it
depends on what you consider' 'good." I
hope the Yankees win the World Series
every season, but even if they did, each
one would still be as sweet.
The Giants, on the other hand, hadn't
won a World Series since 1954 when
they still played in New York,so perhaps
their fans' enthusiasm, even if it is often
obnoxious, is justified pleasure.
Going back to the initial question,
who is spoiled? I think a good way to
look at this is by city. Bay Area sports
fans aren't spoiled whatsoever. In fact,
prior to the Giants World Series cham
pionship, professional teams in the Bay
Area had been decidedly mediocre for
some time (the exception being the San
Jose Sharks, who have been good, but
have combusted in the playoffs year
after year).
New York fans are another story.
New York is a pretty good place to be a
sports fan, but I wouldn't say New York
fans are spoiled.The Yankees are a heck
of a team to root for but somehow
this year is the first time since 1997 that
both the New York Rangers and New
York Knicks are in the playoffs at the
same time. Both have been overspend
ing and underperforming for years. Yes,
the New York Giants and New York
Jets are normally pretty good, but they
are by no means the class of the league.
So what other cities have strong
cases to be called spoiled children?
Philadelphia and Boston come to mind.
In recent years the Phillies, Flyers and
Eagles have all been near the top of
their respective leagues, while the Sixers
remain competitive. Boston, ever since
the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series,
has had an embarrassment of riches
with the Patriots, Bruins and Celtics all
competing for championships along
side their peers on the baseball dia
mond.
On the other hand, what cities have
the toughest luck when it comes to
sports? I know there are lots of bitter
fans lining up to be on this list. Obvious
ly Cleveland immediately comes to
mind.The Browns are consistently very
bad, the Indians have been bad for a
while now, the city doesn't have a hock
ey team and you may have heard that
some guy named Leßron James threw
a knife in Cleveland's back on his way
out of town to Miami, burying the Cav
aliers.
Life is bad elsewhere, however. I
wouldn't want to be a sports fan in
Seattle. "Sure, the Cleveland Cavaliers
stink," Seattle fans would say but at

least they have a team! The Superson
ics were jettisoned to Oklahoma City a
few years ago, and the city's two re
maining franchises, the Seahawks and
the Mariners, are both substandard.
Kansas City fans can't be too happy ei
ther. Kansas City has two teams: the

Royals, who haven't been to the play
offs since 1985, and the Chiefs, who
haven't won a playoff game since Jan
uary of 1994.
What's the moral of the story? If you
ask me, sports fans will always want
more, but in most cases things can be a
lot worse.

Daniel Bohm neglected to mention the
other, forgotten half of New York base
ball fans. Remind him of the Mets at
