# THE 						"HOME" STRETCH
## Card hosts USF as postseason looms 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With seven straight wins, the Stan
ford men's tennis team is in the midst
of its best stretch of play this season.
The Cardinal will try to continue that
this afternoon in an unusual Monday
matchup, hosting the University of
San Francisco Dons at Taube Tennis
Stadium. Ranked No. 70 in the na
tion, the Dons should have their
hands full as they take on the red-hot
Cardinal, currently the ninth-ranked
team in the country.
The Dons,led by Norwegian-born
sophomore Ola Bakke, have won
three of their past four matches, dom
inating UC-Davis and Montana,
squeaking by Gonzaga and falling to
Nevada. Every member on the USF
roster is either a Californian or an in
ternational student, with Oslo, Nor
way serving as a hotbed for recruit
ment. Four of the team's eleven play
ers call the Scandinavian city home.
Upholding a recent trend in col
lege tennis, the Dons, led by head
coach Peter Bartlett, have been very
proactive in recruiting from a particu
lar international location. Stanford
has been a firsthand witness to that
tendency this season,facing a number
of teams that have featured multiple
players from the same international
area. It seems as if college teams al
most monopolize certain regions of
the world, laying claim to the top high
school players in their region for re
cruitment purposes. Stanford is one
of few teams to feature a very low in
ternational presence or more ac
curately, none.
The Stanford men are coming off
consecutive routs of Oregon and
Boise State, beating both schools 6-1.
Junior Bradley Klahn, the Cardinal's
top player, has picked up his game as
of late, losing just once over the
course of his team's winning streak in
both singles and doubles play.
Klahn has been preparing his game
as the whole team has for the
stretch run, culminating in the Pac-10

Championships next weekend in Ojai,
Calif, and, after a two-week hiatus, the
NCAA Championships. Stanford
hosts the national tournament this
year, which begins May 19.
Klahn, the defending NCAA sin
gles champion, has played all year
with a bulls-eye on his back, weather
ing the best shots from each team
whenever he takes the court. He's still
managed to post an impressive 21-9
overall singles record this year and is
only now rounding into his top form.
As head coach John Whitlinger
said at the beginning of the season, his
goal is always to have the team "pre
pared to play their best tennis in
May." The team certainly seems to
have taken its coach's words to heart
since spring quarter, the team has
yet to lose a dual match.

After hosting the University of
San Francisco today, the Cardinal has
only two matches remaining in its reg
ular season: No. 36 Brigham Young
University will visit tomorrow, and
Cal will cross the bay for the tradi
tional Big Smash on Apr. 23.
The Stanford men's tennis team is
trying to stay the course with what it's
been doing building towards May
and enjoying the ride along the
way. With three more matches before
the playoffs begin, the team's focus
and mettle will be tested now more
than ever.
Stanford and USF square off
