## Baseball swept by Oregon State 
### â€”Jacob Jaffe 
Stanford's baseball team went
through a historically brutal sched
ule early in the 2011 season, but last
weekend's series against visiting
Oregon State may have been the
most disheartening yet. The No. 9
Beavers (27-7, 8-1 Pac-10) entered
the weekend as the Pac-10 leaders, a
position they'll hold onto after
sweeping Stanford (16-12, 3-6) at
Sunken Diamond. Despite entering
the series with a 9-1 record at home,
the No. 17 Cardinal was unable to
push across runs as it fell back in the
conference standings with 1-0, 8-1
and 6-4 losses.
Sophomore pitcher Mark
Appel came into Friday's contest
riding a wave of momentum after
his best performance in a Cardinal
uniform in his previous start.
Appel again appeared to be on top
of his game, pitching 6.2 innings
and allowing only seven hits and
one run. That run, scored on an
RBI single by the Beavers' desig
nated hitter Kavin Keyes in the top
of the first, proved to be enough for
Oregon State starter Sam Gaviglio,
who allowed only six baserunners
and no runs in eight strong innings.
OSU closer Tony Bryant struck out
the side in the ninth to cap the 1-0
Beaver victory.

On Saturday, Stanford's offense
was once again stymied by Oregon
State pitching, as the Cardinal could
only scrape across one run on two
hits against starter Josh Osich en
route to a blowout, 8-1 loss.The bot
tom of the Stanford order was com
pletely stifled, as the fifth through
ninth hitters combined to go 1-for
-14 on the day. Cardinal junior
starter Jordan Pries took the loss
after allowing five earned runs in six
innings.
Sunday saw the Cardinal bats
draw first blood after letting oppo
nents score first in six straight
games. Stanford scored two in the
bottom of the opening frame to
take its first lead of the series, but
the Cardinal offense once again
went quiet for the next seven in
nings. Stanford scratched through a
couple more runs in the ninth, but it
was not enough in a 6-4 loss. The
Beavers handed Stanford sopho
more starter Dean McArdle his sec
ond career defeat, with both coming
in his last two starts.
The sweep was Oregon State's
first ever at Sunken Diamond. Stan
ford must regroup now with a mid
week game at Santa Clara tomor
row before next weekend's home
series against No. 23 UCLA.
