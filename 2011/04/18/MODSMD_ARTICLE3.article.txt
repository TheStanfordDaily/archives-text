# Stanford breaks even on Orange Bowl

### KABIR SAWHNEY ELLORA ISRANI 
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the
football team's recent trip to the
Orange Bowl, according to offi
cials in the department. The
Daily was unable to independ
ently verify this figure, as Athlet
ics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other
financial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the
end of the day, with all things
being considered, we'll break
even," said Brian Talbott, chief
financial officer for Stanford
Athletics. "We broke even at
worst."
Officials within the Universi
ty's budget office, including Uni
versity CFO Randy Livingston,
did not comment on financial re
turns from the Orange Bowl and
directed all inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Vir
ginia Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3
game, held at Sun Life Stadium
in Miami Gardens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue
from its bowl trip through a pay
out from the Pacific-10 Confer

ence, which pools bowl revenue
from all of its teams and distrib
utes it to schools to cover bowl
related expenses, chiefly travel
and tickets. Stanford paid for
transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and
was required to cover 7,500 tick
ets â€” out of an allotment of
17,500 from the Orange Bowl
that it was unable to sell.
In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among
teams that participated in the
Bowl Championship Series
(BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last
year's Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, where it lost to Okla
homa, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for
any bowl to break even on a
strict revenue and expense basis,
in the hope that the fact that you
went to a bowl creates those an
cillary benefits," he said.

"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable
to profit directly from the Or
ange Bowl, Talbott pointed out

that playing in the game will
bring the athletics program a
wide range of benefits, many of
which are not quantifiable now
but could translate into financial
gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that
the Pac-10 gets as a payout; we

know what it costs us that
piece is easy," he said. "What's a
lot tougher is quantifying the an
cillary benefits: how many more
ticket sales we're going to get
this year than last year because
