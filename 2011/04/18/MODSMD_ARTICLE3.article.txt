# Stanford breaks even on Orange Bowl
## 
### KABIR SAWHNEY ELLORA ISRANI 
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the
football team's recent trip to the
Orange Bowl, according to offi
cials in the department. The
Daily was unable to independ
ently verify this figure, as Athlet
ics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other
financial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the
end of the day, with all things
being considered, we'll break
even," said Brian Talbott, chief
financial officer for Stanford
Athletics. "We broke even at
worst."
Officials within the Universi
ty's budget office, including Uni
versity CFO Randy Livingston,
did not comment on financial re
turns from the Orange Bowl and
directed all inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Vir
ginia Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3
game, held at Sun Life Stadium
in Miami Gardens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue
from its bowl trip through a pay
out from the Pacific-10 Confer

ence, which pools bowl revenue
from all of its teams and distrib
utes it to schools to cover bowl
related expenses, chiefly travel
and tickets. Stanford paid for
transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and
was required to cover 7,500 tick
ets — out of an allotment of
17,500 from the Orange Bowl
that it was unable to sell.
In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among
teams that participated in the
Bowl Championship Series
(BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last
year's Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, where it lost to Okla
homa, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for
any bowl to break even on a
strict revenue and expense basis,
in the hope that the fact that you
went to a bowl creates those an
cillary benefits," he said.

"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable
to profit directly from the Or
ange Bowl, Talbott pointed out

that playing in the game will
bring the athletics program a
wide range of benefits, many of
which are not quantifiable now
but could translate into financial
gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that
the Pac-10 gets as a payout; we

know what it costs us that
piece is easy," he said. "What's a
lot tougher is quantifying the an
cillary benefits: how many more
ticket sales we're going to get
this year than last year because


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
we went to the Orange Bowl, how
many more donations are we going
to get this year because we went to
the Orange Bowl, how much better
is our recruiting going to be because
we went to the Orange Bowl."
Season ticket renewals for next
year are already up Talbott said
he expects to beat the 90 percent re
newal target "substantially" and
even though new ticket sales have
yet to open, Athletics has already col
lected four times as many deposits to
date as it did for all of last year.
"Even taking it a little further, the
more people who come to any game
for us, the more they're going to have
to pay to park, the more they're
going to buy concessions, the more
they're going to buy merchandise,"
Talbott said. "All of these things
trickle down."
The publicity from the game, es
pecially because it was the only foot
ball game on during the 8 p.m. EST
timeslot, could also be beneficial in
recruiting players and retaining
coaches. He noted that while coach
ing impacts are felt more immediate
ly, the recruiting gains will probably
be seen in the 2012 class, as this year's
group had already committed by
February.
"Everybody was watching," Tal
bott said. "That gets recruits' eyes;
they say, 'Hey, I could be on TV if I
play for Stanford.' And it helps retain
coaches to some extent, although it
makes them more popular too, so
they could leave, but coaches like to
be part of a successful program."
Talbott also noted that the Uni
versity as a whole could reap finan
cial benefits from its football victory,
as donations could benefit from the
Orange Bowl being "a very public
success."
"It should break even, from a
strict 'revenue and expense related
to the bowl itself perspective," he
said. "I find it hard to believe that we
won't see significant upside in those
secondary areas that will make it well
worthwhile over time."
Sizing up the competition
Nine other universities participat
ed in last season's BCS, a set of five
marquee bowl games including the
national title game and the Orange
Bowl. From a profit standpoint, Stan
ford was right in the middle of the
pack.
Unlike Stanford, which is a pri
vate institution, public universities
are required to disclose their NCAA
bowl expense reports upon request
due to open-records laws, most no
tably the federal Freedom of Infor
mation Act. For the eight public
schools that participated in the BCS,
The Daily was able to collect detailed

financial information, including fig
ures for profit or loss.
Among those schools, only two
Ohio State and Wisconsin made a
significant profit, with the Buckeyes
earning $288,876 on their trip to the
Sugar Bowl and the Badgers receiv
ing $79,168 from the Rose Bowl.Two
other teams, Oklahoma and
Arkansas, were close to break-even
the Sooners earned $9,350 from
the Fiesta Bowl, and the Razorbacks
received $5,525 from the Sugar
Bowl.
The remaining four schools took
significant financial hits. Most no
table was Connecticut, which lost just
under $l.B million on its Fiesta Bowl
trip. Virginia Tech, the Cardinal's op
ponent in the Orange Bowl, lost
$421,046. Both participants in the
BCS National Championship Game,
Auburn and Oregon, ended in the
red, with the Tigers paying $614,106
and the Ducks losing $312,437.
Records were not available for
the Rose Bowl's second participant,
Texas Christian University, because
it is a private institution.
It appeared that conference affili
ation was an important factor in de
termining whether a team made or
lost money. Both Ohio State and
Wisconsin are members of the Big
Ten Conference, which generally
pays out more revenue to its member
schools than other conferences.
For perspective, Ohio State re
ceived $2 million from its conference
for its bowl appearance, while Vir
ginia Tech received just $1,725 mil
lion from the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence (ACC). The Pac-10 also ap
peared to be slightly more generous,
as Oregon received just under $2.3
million with the caveat that the
Ducks played in the title game and
thus were expected to have higher
expenses as well.
The Daily also compared finan
cial returns from the two participants
in the 2010 Orange Bowl, lowa and
GeorgiaTech.The Flawkeyes made a
$55,954 profit, while the Yellow Jack
ets took a $198,910 loss. However,
the two teams did have a large gap in
revenue, with lowa getting $1.95 mil
lion from the Big Ten compared to
Georgia Tech's $1.6 million payout
from the ACC.
Flaws in the bowl system
Matt Sanderson, one of the co
founders of Playoff PAC, a political
committee whose goal is to establish
a playoff for college football, dis
cussed Stanford's bowl finances
and the flaws of the bowl system in
general in an interview with The
Daily.
"It shows you how bizarre this
system is, that actually breaking even
on a bowl is considered a success
story," he said.
Jeff Passan, a Yahoo! Sports
columnist and a co-author of the
book "Death to the BCS," added that
it was "surprising and not surprising"

that Stanford broke even on the Or
ange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien-

tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse, like
Virginia Tech or Ohio State, actually
made it easier for Stanford to break
even.
"The difference between a school
that breaks even and one that bleeds
is conscientiousness," he said. "Foot
ball rules Virginia Tech. Everyone
wants a part of it... Rather than
leave itself open to criticism for being
like every other school and overvalu
ing football, Stanford's approach was
pragmatic: enjoy the experience,
don't go overboard."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universities
to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the playoff."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a cer
tain number of tickets and cover any
unsold ones. Thus, bowls transfer the
majority of financial responsibility
onto the participating schools and
actually take very minimal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on

Stub Hub and get the same tickets for
a fourth of the price. The bowls are
pushing all the risk of not selling tick
ets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer day-

of-game tickets for as little as 10 per
cent of face value, elucidates more
than anything what a terrible deal
bowls are for schools," Passan said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Universi
ty administrators and one major
revenue source: a bowl payout.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying conferences,
including the Pac-10, plus another $6
million if a conference qualifies a sec
ond team for the BCS. This season,
both Stanford and Oregon qualified
for the BCS, giving the Pac-10 a $27.2
million payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received payouts
from its other bowl teams, Arizona
and Washington, which played in
the Alamo and Holiday bowls, re
spectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.
"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we

participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among all
10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten, be
cause they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket obli
gation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as well
as three nights at the Renaissance
Eden Roc Miami Beach for the
band, according to Max Chang 'l3,
director of public relations for the
LSJUMB.The University also char
tered a plane for about 130 of the
180 band members and subsidized
travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac-10,
significant differences existed be
tween the three other Pac-10 bowl
teams. Due to its participation in the
BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Arizona
lost $274,932 on the Alamo Bowl,
while Washington came out slightly
ahead on its Holiday Bowl trip, with
a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiva
lent expense allowances of around
$l.l million. However, the Wildcats
were forced to cover $552,375 in un
sold tickets, while the Huskies only
had to take $102,130 in ticket losses,
with those figures coming after the
Pac-10's contributions to covering
unsold tickets. Oregon paid for
$555,575 in unsold tickets on its way
to a $312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 mil
lion expense allowance.

we went to the Orange Bowl."
Season ticket renewals for next
year are already up Talbott said
he expects to beat the 90 percent re
newal target "substantially" and
even though new ticket sales have
yet to open, Athletics has already col
lected four times as many deposits to
date as it did for all of last year.
"Even taking it a little further, the
more people who come to any game
for us, the more they're going to have
to pay to park, the more they're
going to buy concessions, the more
they're going to buy merchandise,"
Talbott said. "All of these things
trickle down."
The publicity from the game, es
pecially because it was the only foot
ball game on during the 8 p.m. EST
timeslot, could also be beneficial in
recruiting players and retaining
coaches. He noted that while coach
ing impacts are felt more immediate
ly, the recruiting gains will probably
be seen in the 2012 class, as this year's
group had already committed by
February.
"Everybody was watching," Tal
bott said. "That gets recruits' eyes;
they say, 'Hey, I could be on TV if I
play for Stanford.' And it helps retain
coaches to some extent, although it
makes them more popular too, so
they could leave, but coaches like to
be part of a successful program."
Talbott also noted that the Uni
versity as a whole could reap finan
cial benefits from its football victory,
as donations could benefit from the
Orange Bowl being "a very public
success."
"It should break even, from a
strict 'revenue and expense related
to the bowl itself perspective," he
said. "I find it hard to believe that we
won't see significant upside in those
secondary areas that will make it well
worthwhile over time."
Sizing up the competition
Nine other universities participat
ed in last season's BCS, a set of five
marquee bowl games including the
national title game and the Orange
Bowl. From a profit standpoint, Stan
ford was right in the middle of the
pack.
Unlike Stanford, which is a pri
vate institution, public universities
are required to disclose their NCAA
bowl expense reports upon request
due to open-records laws, most no
tably the federal Freedom of Infor
mation Act. For the eight public
schools that participated in the BCS,
The Daily was able to collect detailed

financial information, including fig
ures for profit or loss.
Among those schools, only two
Ohio State and Wisconsin made a
significant profit, with the Buckeyes
earning $288,876 on their trip to the
Sugar Bowl and the Badgers receiv
ing $79,168 from the Rose Bowl.Two
other teams, Oklahoma and
Arkansas, were close to break-even
the Sooners earned $9,350 from
the Fiesta Bowl, and the Razorbacks
received $5,525 from the Sugar
Bowl.
The remaining four schools took
significant financial hits. Most no
table was Connecticut, which lost just
under $l.B million on its Fiesta Bowl
trip. Virginia Tech, the Cardinal's op
ponent in the Orange Bowl, lost
$421,046. Both participants in the
BCS National Championship Game,
Auburn and Oregon, ended in the
red, with the Tigers paying $614,106
and the Ducks losing $312,437.
Records were not available for
the Rose Bowl's second participant,
Texas Christian University, because
it is a private institution.
It appeared that conference affili
ation was an important factor in de
termining whether a team made or
lost money. Both Ohio State and
Wisconsin are members of the Big
Ten Conference, which generally
pays out more revenue to its member
schools than other conferences.
For perspective, Ohio State re
ceived $2 million from its conference
for its bowl appearance, while Vir
ginia Tech received just $1,725 mil
lion from the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence (ACC). The Pac-10 also ap
peared to be slightly more generous,
as Oregon received just under $2.3
million with the caveat that the
Ducks played in the title game and
thus were expected to have higher
expenses as well.
The Daily also compared finan
cial returns from the two participants
in the 2010 Orange Bowl, lowa and
GeorgiaTech.The Flawkeyes made a
$55,954 profit, while the Yellow Jack
ets took a $198,910 loss. However,
the two teams did have a large gap in
revenue, with lowa getting $1.95 mil
lion from the Big Ten compared to
Georgia Tech's $1.6 million payout
from the ACC.
Flaws in the bowl system
Matt Sanderson, one of the co
founders of Playoff PAC, a political
committee whose goal is to establish
a playoff for college football, dis
cussed Stanford's bowl finances
and the flaws of the bowl system in
general in an interview with The
Daily.
"It shows you how bizarre this
system is, that actually breaking even
on a bowl is considered a success
story," he said.
Jeff Passan, a Yahoo! Sports
columnist and a co-author of the
book "Death to the BCS," added that
it was "surprising and not surprising"

that Stanford broke even on the Or
ange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien-

tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse, like
Virginia Tech or Ohio State, actually
made it easier for Stanford to break
even.
"The difference between a school
that breaks even and one that bleeds
is conscientiousness," he said. "Foot
ball rules Virginia Tech. Everyone
wants a part of it... Rather than
leave itself open to criticism for being
like every other school and overvalu
ing football, Stanford's approach was
pragmatic: enjoy the experience,
don't go overboard."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universities
to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the playoff."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a cer
tain number of tickets and cover any
unsold ones. Thus, bowls transfer the
majority of financial responsibility
onto the participating schools and
actually take very minimal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on

Stub Hub and get the same tickets for
a fourth of the price. The bowls are
pushing all the risk of not selling tick
ets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer day-

of-game tickets for as little as 10 per
cent of face value, elucidates more
than anything what a terrible deal
bowls are for schools," Passan said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Universi
ty administrators and one major
revenue source: a bowl payout.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying conferences,
including the Pac-10, plus another $6
million if a conference qualifies a sec
ond team for the BCS. This season,
both Stanford and Oregon qualified
for the BCS, giving the Pac-10 a $27.2
million payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received payouts
from its other bowl teams, Arizona
and Washington, which played in
the Alamo and Holiday bowls, re
spectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.
"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we

participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among all
10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten, be
cause they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket obli
gation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as well
as three nights at the Renaissance
Eden Roc Miami Beach for the
band, according to Max Chang 'l3,
director of public relations for the
LSJUMB.The University also char
tered a plane for about 130 of the
180 band members and subsidized
travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac-10,
significant differences existed be
tween the three other Pac-10 bowl
teams. Due to its participation in the
BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Arizona
lost $274,932 on the Alamo Bowl,
while Washington came out slightly
ahead on its Holiday Bowl trip, with
a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiva
lent expense allowances of around
$l.l million. However, the Wildcats
were forced to cover $552,375 in un
sold tickets, while the Huskies only
had to take $102,130 in ticket losses,
with those figures coming after the
Pac-10's contributions to covering
unsold tickets. Oregon paid for
$555,575 in unsold tickets on its way
to a $312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 mil
lion expense allowance.

ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the
football team's recent trip to the
Orange Bowl, according to offi
cials in the department. The
Daily was unable to independ
ently verify this figure, as Athlet
ics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other
financial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the
end of the day, with all things
being considered, we'll break
even," said Brian Talbott, chief
financial officer for Stanford
Athletics. "We broke even at
worst."
Officials within the Universi
ty's budget office, including Uni
versity CFO Randy Livingston,
did not comment on financial re
turns from the Orange Bowl and
directed all inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Vir
ginia Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3
game, held at Sun Life Stadium
in Miami Gardens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue
from its bowl trip through a pay
out from the Pacific-10 Confer

ence, which pools bowl revenue
from all of its teams and distrib
utes it to schools to cover bowl
related expenses, chiefly travel
and tickets. Stanford paid for
transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and
was required to cover 7,500 tick
ets — out of an allotment of
17,500 from the Orange Bowl
that it was unable to sell.
In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among
teams that participated in the
Bowl Championship Series
(BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last
year's Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, where it lost to Okla
homa, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for
any bowl to break even on a
strict revenue and expense basis,
in the hope that the fact that you
went to a bowl creates those an
cillary benefits," he said.

"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable
to profit directly from the Or
ange Bowl, Talbott pointed out

that playing in the game will
bring the athletics program a
wide range of benefits, many of
which are not quantifiable now
but could translate into financial
gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that
the Pac-10 gets as a payout; we

know what it costs us that
piece is easy," he said. "What's a
lot tougher is quantifying the an
cillary benefits: how many more
ticket sales we're going to get
this year than last year because


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
we went to the Orange Bowl, how

the Sooners earned $9,350 from
the Fiesta Bowl, and the Razorbacks
received $5,525 from the Sugar
Bowl.
The remaining four schools took
significant financial hits. Most no
table was Connecticut, which lost just
under $l.B million on its Fiesta Bowl
trip. Virginia Tech, the Cardinal's op
ponent in the Orange Bowl, lost
$421,046. Both participants in the
BCS National Championship Game,
Auburn and Oregon, ended in the
red, with the Tigers paying $614,106
and the Ducks losing $312,437.
Records were not available for
the Rose Bowl's second participant,
Texas Christian University, because
it is a private institution.
It appeared that conference affili
ation was an important factor in de
termining whether a team made or
lost money. Both Ohio State and
Wisconsin are members of the Big
Ten Conference, which generally
pays out more revenue to its member
schools than other conferences.
For perspective, Ohio State re
ceived $2 million from its conference
for its bowl appearance, while Vir
ginia Tech received just $1,725 mil
lion from the Atlantic Coast Confer
ence (ACC). The Pac-10 also ap
peared to be slightly more generous,
as Oregon received just under $2.3
million with the caveat that the
Ducks played in the title game and
thus were expected to have higher
expenses as well.
The Daily also compared finan
cial returns from the two participants
in the 2010 Orange Bowl, lowa and
GeorgiaTech.The Flawkeyes made a
$55,954 profit, while the Yellow Jack
ets took a $198,910 loss. However,
the two teams did have a large gap in
revenue, with lowa getting $1.95 mil
lion from the Big Ten compared to
Georgia Tech's $1.6 million payout
from the ACC.
Flaws in the bowl system
Matt Sanderson, one of the co
founders of Playoff PAC, a political
committee whose goal is to establish
a playoff for college football, dis
cussed Stanford's bowl finances
and the flaws of the bowl system in
general in an interview with The
Daily.
"It shows you how bizarre this
system is, that actually breaking even
on a bowl is considered a success
story," he said.
Jeff Passan, a Yahoo! Sports
columnist and a co-author of the
book "Death to the BCS," added that
it was "surprising and not surprising"

that Stanford broke even on the Or
ange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien-

tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse, like
Virginia Tech or Ohio State, actually
made it easier for Stanford to break
even.
"The difference between a school
that breaks even and one that bleeds
is conscientiousness," he said. "Foot
ball rules Virginia Tech. Everyone
wants a part of it... Rather than
leave itself open to criticism for being
like every other school and overvalu
ing football, Stanford's approach was
pragmatic: enjoy the experience,
don't go overboard."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universities
to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the playoff."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a cer
tain number of tickets and cover any
unsold ones. Thus, bowls transfer the
majority of financial responsibility
onto the participating schools and
actually take very minimal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on

Stub Hub and get the same tickets for
a fourth of the price. The bowls are
pushing all the risk of not selling tick
ets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer day-

of-game tickets for as little as 10 per
cent of face value, elucidates more
than anything what a terrible deal
bowls are for schools," Passan said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Universi
ty administrators and one major
revenue source: a bowl payout.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying conferences,
including the Pac-10, plus another $6
million if a conference qualifies a sec
ond team for the BCS. This season,
both Stanford and Oregon qualified
for the BCS, giving the Pac-10 a $27.2
million payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received payouts
from its other bowl teams, Arizona
and Washington, which played in
the Alamo and Holiday bowls, re
spectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.
"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we

participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among all
10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten, be
cause they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket obli
gation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as well
as three nights at the Renaissance
Eden Roc Miami Beach for the
band, according to Max Chang 'l3,
director of public relations for the
LSJUMB.The University also char
tered a plane for about 130 of the
180 band members and subsidized
travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac-10,
significant differences existed be
tween the three other Pac-10 bowl
teams. Due to its participation in the
BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Arizona
lost $274,932 on the Alamo Bowl,
while Washington came out slightly
ahead on its Holiday Bowl trip, with
a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiva
lent expense allowances of around
$l.l million. However, the Wildcats
were forced to cover $552,375 in un
sold tickets, while the Huskies only
had to take $102,130 in ticket losses,
with those figures coming after the
Pac-10's contributions to covering
unsold tickets. Oregon paid for
$555,575 in unsold tickets on its way
to a $312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 mil
lion expense allowance.

ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the
football team's recent trip to the
Orange Bowl, according to offi
cials in the department. The
Daily was unable to independ
ently verify this figure, as Athlet
ics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other
financial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the
end of the day, with all things
being considered, we'll break
even," said Brian Talbott, chief
financial officer for Stanford
Athletics. "We broke even at
worst."
Officials within the Universi
ty's budget office, including Uni
versity CFO Randy Livingston,
did not comment on financial re
turns from the Orange Bowl and
directed all inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Vir
ginia Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3
game, held at Sun Life Stadium
in Miami Gardens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue
from its bowl trip through a pay
out from the Pacific-10 Confer

ence, which pools bowl revenue
from all of its teams and distrib
utes it to schools to cover bowl
related expenses, chiefly travel
and tickets. Stanford paid for
transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and
was required to cover 7,500 tick
ets — out of an allotment of
17,500 from the Orange Bowl
that it was unable to sell.
In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among
teams that participated in the
Bowl Championship Series
(BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last
year's Sun Bowl in El Paso,
Texas, where it lost to Okla
homa, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for
any bowl to break even on a
strict revenue and expense basis,
in the hope that the fact that you
went to a bowl creates those an
cillary benefits," he said.

"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable
to profit directly from the Or
ange Bowl, Talbott pointed out

that playing in the game will
bring the athletics program a
wide range of benefits, many of
which are not quantifiable now
but could translate into financial
gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that
the Pac-10 gets as a payout; we

know what it costs us that
piece is easy," he said. "What's a
lot tougher is quantifying the an
cillary benefits: how many more
ticket sales we're going to get
this year than last year because


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
we went to the Orange Bowl, how
many more donations are we going
to get this year because we went to
the Orange Bowl, how much better
is our recruiting going to be because
we went to the Orange Bowl."
Season ticket renewals for next
year are already up Talbott said
he expects to beat the 90 percent re
newal target "substantially" and
even though new ticket sales have
yet to open, Athletics has already col
lected four times as many deposits to
date as it did for all of last year.
"Even taking it a little further, the
more people who come to any game
for us, the more they're going to have
to pay to park, the more they're
going to buy concessions, the more
they're going to buy merchandise,"
Talbott said. "All of these things
trickle down."
The publicity from the game, es
pecially because it was the only foot
ball game on during the 8 p.m. EST
timeslot, could also be beneficial in
recruiting players and retaining
coaches. He noted that while coach
ing impacts are felt more immediate
ly, the recruiting gains will probably
be seen in the 2012 class, as this year's
group had already committed by
February.
"Everybody was watching," Tal
bott said. "That gets recruits' eyes;
they say, 'Hey, I could be on TV if I
play for Stanford.' And it helps retain
coaches to some extent, although it
makes them more popular too, so
they could leave, but coaches like to
be part of a successful program."
Talbott also noted that the Uni
versity as a whole could reap finan
cial benefits from its football victory,
as donations could benefit from the
Orange Bowl being "a very public
success."
"It should break even, from a
strict 'revenue and expense related
to the bowl itself perspective," he
said. "I find it hard to believe that we
won't see significant upside in those
secondary areas that will make it well
worthwhile over time."
Sizing up the competition
Nine other universities participat
ed in last season's BCS, a set of five
marquee bowl games including the
national title game and the Orange
Bowl. From a profit standpoint, Stan
ford was right in the middle of the
pack.
Unlike Stanford, which is a pri
vate institution, public universities
are required to disclose their NCAA
bowl expense reports upon request
due to open-records laws, most no
tably the federal Freedom of Infor
mation Act. For the eight public
schools that participated in the BCS,
The Daily was able to collect detailed

financial information, including fig
ures for profit or loss.
Among those schools, only two
Ohio State and Wisconsin made a
significant profit, with the Buckeyes
earning $288,876 on their trip to the
Sugar Bowl and the Badgers receiv
ing $79,168 from the Rose Bowl.Two
other teams, Oklahoma and
Arkansas, were close to break-even

struck me as being more conscien-

tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse, like
Virginia Tech or Ohio State, actually
made it easier for Stanford to break
even.
"The difference between a school
that breaks even and one that bleeds
is conscientiousness," he said. "Foot
ball rules Virginia Tech. Everyone
wants a part of it... Rather than
leave itself open to criticism for being
like every other school and overvalu
ing football, Stanford's approach was
pragmatic: enjoy the experience,
don't go overboard."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universities
to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the playoff."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a cer
tain number of tickets and cover any
unsold ones. Thus, bowls transfer the
majority of financial responsibility
onto the participating schools and
actually take very minimal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on

Stub Hub and get the same tickets for
a fourth of the price. The bowls are
pushing all the risk of not selling tick
ets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer day-

of-game tickets for as little as 10 per
cent of face value, elucidates more
than anything what a terrible deal
bowls are for schools," Passan said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Universi
ty administrators and one major
revenue source: a bowl payout.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying conferences,
including the Pac-10, plus another $6
million if a conference qualifies a sec
ond team for the BCS. This season,
both Stanford and Oregon qualified
for the BCS, giving the Pac-10 a $27.2
million payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received payouts
from its other bowl teams, Arizona
and Washington, which played in
the Alamo and Holiday bowls, re
spectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.
"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we

participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among all
10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten, be
cause they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket obli
gation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as well
as three nights at the Renaissance
Eden Roc Miami Beach for the
band, according to Max Chang 'l3,
director of public relations for the
LSJUMB.The University also char
tered a plane for about 130 of the
180 band members and subsidized
travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac-10,
significant differences existed be
tween the three other Pac-10 bowl
teams. Due to its participation in the
BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Arizona
lost $274,932 on the Alamo Bowl,
while Washington came out slightly
ahead on its Holiday Bowl trip, with
a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiva
lent expense allowances of around
$l.l million. However, the Wildcats
were forced to cover $552,375 in un
sold tickets, while the Huskies only
had to take $102,130 in ticket losses,
with those figures coming after the
Pac-10's contributions to covering
unsold tickets. Oregon paid for
$555,575 in unsold tickets on its way
to a $312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 mil
lion expense allowance.
