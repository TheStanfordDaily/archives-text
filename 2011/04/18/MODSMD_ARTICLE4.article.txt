## Alan Garber headed to Harvard Med school professor chosen as new provost 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Professor of Medicine Alan
Garber M.D. 'B3 will sport crimson
rather than cardinal this fall as he
takes on the role of provost at Har

Mass.
In his 25 years at Stanford, Gar

long had a connection with. The
role will be challenging and satis
fying."
Garber graduated from Har

top administrators in Cambridge.
"It started with a conversation
that I had with Drew Faust, the
president of Harvard, about how
the provost position should be
configured," Garber said.
In their discussions, Garber and
Faust also broached the general
challenges that Harvard faces, no

medical and dental schools and ob-
