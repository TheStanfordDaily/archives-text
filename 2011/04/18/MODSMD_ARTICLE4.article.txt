## Alan Garber headed to Harvard Med school professor chosen as new provost 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Professor of Medicine Alan
Garber M.D. 'B3 will sport crimson
rather than cardinal this fall as he
takes on the role of provost at Har
vard University in Cambridge,
Mass.
In his 25 years at Stanford, Gar
ber has distinguished himself be
yond the medical field, serving as a
professor (by courtesy) of eco
nomics, a senior fellow at the Free
man Spogli Institute (FSI) and
professor of economics at the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB). At FSI, he works as the di
rector of the Center for Health
Policy/Center for Primary Care
and Outcomes Research.
But come Sept. 1, Garber will
leave the sunny pastures of the
Farm for Harvard Yard a move
that will require "an entirely new
wardrobe," Garber said.
"This is an incredible opportu
nity, but it's also a bittersweet
one," he added. "My years at Stan
ford have been very satisfying .. .
but I do feel good about this move
mainly because I'm going to see
other friends at an institution I've
long had a connection with. The
role will be challenging and satis
fying."
Garber graduated from Har
vard College summa cum laude'm
1976 and received his Ph.D. in eco
nomics there in 1982. His appoint
ment, announced last week, arose
naturally from collaborations with
top administrators in Cambridge.
"It started with a conversation
that I had with Drew Faust, the
president of Harvard, about how
the provost position should be
configured," Garber said.
In their discussions, Garber and
Faust also broached the general
challenges that Harvard faces, no
tably issues faced by the university's
medical and dental schools and ob-
stacles accompanying its efforts to
establish multidisciplinary insti
tutes.
"We had these conversations in
part, because I serve as the chair of
the Committee to Visit Harvard
Medical School and Harvard
School of General Medicine," Gar
ber said. "That is one of several vis
iting committees which serve, es
sentially, as external advisory com
mittees to various units within the
university."
At the same time, Garber's work
at Stanford notably his service
on the University Advisory Board,
which reviews all faculty appoint
ments and promotions has pre
pared him for the position of
provost.
Looking to the future, Garber
foresees two major issues that will
require his immediate attention as
Harvard's provost: the implemen
tation of a set of changes in Har
vard's library system and con

struction at the university's All
ston campus. He is also set to tack
le various ongoing projects and
new initiatives during the chal
lenging transition process.
"I'll be in the learning phase in
the beginning learning the peo
ple, learning the issues, learning the
institution," Garber said. "Fortu
nately, this will be made somewhat
easier by the fact that I'm very fa
miliar with the institution from hav
ing been a student and a resident at
Harvard. I've kept close connec
tions with the university over the
years in various capacities."
Garber said his return to Har
vard is similar to "going back
home after an absence of many
years." As he prepares to leave
Stanford, Garber commended the
University for its "stellar leader
ship" and its excellence in re
search.
"It was and remains extremely
difficult to leave Stanford, be
cause I've been as happy as I could
imagine during my 25 years on the
faculty here," he said.
