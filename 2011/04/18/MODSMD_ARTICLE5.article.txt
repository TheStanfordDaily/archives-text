# BioBlitz at Lake Lagunita

Stanford Strategies for Ecology
Education, Diversity and Sustainability
(SEEDS) hosted a BioBlitz at Lake
Lag on Saturday, designed to assess
the biodiversity of the area. The
group also hoped engage the Stanford
community with the ecology
there.
BioBlitz is a "rapid" biodiversity assessment
of an area that takes place
in a single day. Mattias Lanas '11,
president of SEEDS, pointed out multiple
advantages to such an assessment,
including the ability to compare
results from different years.
"The emphasis is definitely on the
Stanford community, since Lake Lagunita
belongs to Stanford, and we wish
to promote ecology awareness locally,"
Lanas said. "BioBlitz serves as a
wakeup call to the community, saying
'Hold on, there are amazing critters
living right in your backyard. You just
need to come out and find them!'"
He added that the event had
three overarching goals: to spread
ecological awareness about the rich
array of biota on the Farm, to collect
data on the organisms living here
and to promote citizen science
among the Stanford community.
"We want people to learn why it's
important to conserve this area,Ã†
he said.
