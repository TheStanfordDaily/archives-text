# STUDENT LIFE
## Campaign to divest relaunched Push is the latest in struggle started in 2007 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
Students Confronting Apartheid
by Israel (SCAI) has relaunched its
campaign to build student support
for divestment of the University's
endowment from companies that
SCAI says profit from human rights
violations against Palestinians.
SCAI plans to start at a grassroots
level to garner student support.
"We are morally bound to stop
making the harming of others prof
itable," said Cecilie Surasky, deputy
director of Jewish Voice for Peace,
of using divestment to combat per
ceived human rights violations.
Surasky was one of three panelists
at SCAI's presentation last Thurs
day to renew the divestment cam
paign it began in 2007. Approxi
mately 60 people attended the pres
entation.
The Israel-Palestine conflict has
been a divisive topic for decades,
and many are reluctant to directly
oppose or support either side. As a
result, SCAI's proposition calls for
selective divestment rather than di
vestment from Israel as a whole.
"We're not calling for divestment
from Israeli companies but rather
companies that violate human rights
laws," said current law student
Omar Shakir 'O7, the main speaker
at Thursday's presentation.
The criteria that SCAI presented
as warranting divestment include
operating on occupied land, facili
tating collective punishment and
supporting the building of a barrier
between Israeli and Palestinian
lands. According to SCAI, notable
companies that meet those criteria
include Motorola, Lockheed Mar
tin, Caterpillar and Veolia Trans
portation, which operates Stan
ford's Marguerite shuttle system.
Shakir pointed out Stanford's
past divestments from South Africa,
Darfur and the Democratic Repub
lic of the Congo as precedents for
SCAI's strategy. He added that the
2007 divestment promotion raised a
petition with just under 1,000 sign
ers and achieved a majority vote in
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
SCAI President Jenna Queenan 'll
said that the campaign never offi
cially ended and that SCAI hopes to
bring the movement back to stu
dents' attention.
"It's good timing with all the rev
olutions in the Middle East," she
said. "We're relaunching because of
momentum with new students [in
SCAI]."
The group plans to restart its di
vestment campaign by giving pre
sentations to student groups and in
student residences with larger
events, such as town hall meetings
and speakers.
One notable criticism at Thurs
day's relaunch event was the lack of
demand that Stanford divest from
Intel. Joel Beinin, a professor of
Middle Eastern history and another
panelist at Thursday's event, admit
ted that the company met several of

SCAI's divestment criteria. Howev
er, he said Intel is too large a compa
ny and too closely tied to Stanford
for SCAI to realistically ask the
University to divest. Several audi
ence members criticized SCAI for
ignoring Intel's role in the conflict,
despite SCAI's rhetoric of moral
obligation.
Many students, especially in
Stanford's Jewish community, op
pose SCAI's divestment movement.
Lindsay Funk 'l3, an activist against
last year's divestment movement,
said she opposes divestment cam
paigning because of the effects it has
on Stanford's campus.
"The Israel-Palestinian conflict
is not an easy topic, so it makes
sense that anything to do with it, in
cluding divestment, is going to en
gender a lot of conflicting reason
able opinions," Funk, who advo
cates for conversation between
both sides of the issue, said. She
added that SCAI's campaign makes
compromise difficult because, "It's
hard to have a conversation with
people who say that you're propa
gating an apartheid system."
The Stanford-Israel Alliance
(SIA) officially opposes move
ments to divest from Israel. SIA
president Jonathan York 'l3, who is

also a Daily photographer, pointed
to a campaign similar to SCAI's at
UC-Berkeley that "caused tremen
dous destruction in their campus
community and an enormous
amount of divisiveness" despite fail
ing to pass Cal's student govern
ment. SIA states that its priority is
creating peace in Israel and believes
that divestment works against
peace.
"On both sides you have a fun
damental problem when divest
ment is brought up as essentially an
alternative to real peace negotia
tions," he said.
SIA does not have a campaign
planned against divestment at this
time, but York said that when the di
vestment issue arose last year, a sep
arate group called Invest for Peace
formed to invest in companies that
promote peace in Israel.
SCAI has tentatively scheduled
three events in the coming weeks to
continue its campaign: a perform
ance by spoken word artist Remi
Kanazi on April 28, a town hall
meeting on May 3 and a speech by
Palestinian democracy activist
Mustafa Barghouti on May 13.

companies that meet those criteria
include Motorola, Lockheed Mar
tin, Caterpillar and Veolia Trans
portation, which operates Stan
ford's Marguerite shuttle system.
Shakir pointed out Stanford's
past divestments from South Africa,
Darfur and the Democratic Repub
lic of the Congo as precedents for
SCAI's strategy. He added that the
2007 divestment promotion raised a
petition with just under 1,000 sign
ers and achieved a majority vote in
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
SCAI President Jenna Queenan 'll
said that the campaign never offi
cially ended and that SCAI hopes to
bring the movement back to stu
dents' attention.
"It's good timing with all the rev
olutions in the Middle East," she
said. "We're relaunching because of
momentum with new students [in
SCAI]."
The group plans to restart its di
vestment campaign by giving pre
sentations to student groups and in
student residences with larger
events, such as town hall meetings
and speakers.
One notable criticism at Thurs
day's relaunch event was the lack of
demand that Stanford divest from
Intel. Joel Beinin, a professor of
Middle Eastern history and another
panelist at Thursday's event, admit
ted that the company met several of

SCAI's divestment criteria. Howev
er, he said Intel is too large a compa
ny and too closely tied to Stanford
for SCAI to realistically ask the
University to divest. Several audi
ence members criticized SCAI for
ignoring Intel's role in the conflict,
despite SCAI's rhetoric of moral
obligation.
Many students, especially in
Stanford's Jewish community, op
pose SCAI's divestment movement.
Lindsay Funk 'l3, an activist against
last year's divestment movement,
said she opposes divestment cam
paigning because of the effects it has
on Stanford's campus.
"The Israel-Palestinian conflict
is not an easy topic, so it makes
sense that anything to do with it, in
cluding divestment, is going to en
gender a lot of conflicting reason
able opinions," Funk, who advo
cates for conversation between
both sides of the issue, said. She
added that SCAI's campaign makes
compromise difficult because, "It's
hard to have a conversation with
people who say that you're propa
gating an apartheid system."
The Stanford-Israel Alliance
(SIA) officially opposes move
ments to divest from Israel. SIA
president Jonathan York 'l3, who is

also a Daily photographer, pointed
to a campaign similar to SCAI's at
UC-Berkeley that "caused tremen
dous destruction in their campus
community and an enormous
amount of divisiveness" despite fail
ing to pass Cal's student govern
ment. SIA states that its priority is
creating peace in Israel and believes
that divestment works against
peace.
"On both sides you have a fun
damental problem when divest
ment is brought up as essentially an
alternative to real peace negotia
tions," he said.
SIA does not have a campaign
planned against divestment at this
time, but York said that when the di
vestment issue arose last year, a sep
arate group called Invest for Peace
formed to invest in companies that
promote peace in Israel.
SCAI has tentatively scheduled
three events in the coming weeks to
continue its campaign: a perform
ance by spoken word artist Remi
Kanazi on April 28, a town hall
meeting on May 3 and a speech by
Palestinian democracy activist
Mustafa Barghouti on May 13.
