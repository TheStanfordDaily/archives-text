# ACADEMICS
## Initiative launched to promote Humanities 
### SAMANTHA MCGIRR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This academic year has seen a
campus-wide initiative to increase
the study of the humanities at Stan
ford. One of the stepping-stones in
this initiative is an upcoming Admit
Weekend event, titled "Creativity
and the Human Condition: Human
ities Research and Arts Endeavors
at Stanford," set for April 30. The
event aims to reach students early
and encourage them expand their
involvement in the humanities, both
as an area of academic study and as
an extra-curricular.
Mandated by the offices of the
Provost and the President, the ef
fort is a response to decreasing
numbers of humanities students at
Stanford and colleges nationwide.
Leaders of the effort include the
dean of the School of Humanities &
Sciences, the associate dean for the
Humanities and Arts and the Office
of the Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education (VPUE). Accord
ing to Vice Provost Harry Elam Jr.,
the initiative entails a broad effort
to increase the visibility of the hu
manities on campus, rather than tar
geting numeric goals.
"There is not a specific figure
that we are aiming for, but in addi
tion to increasing the number of
humanities majors, another goal of
the effort is to increase interest and
enrollment in humanities courses,"
Elam wrote in an email to The
Daily.
The disciplines that constitute the
humanities vary at each university.
Stanford's humanities program in
cludes 15 departments: art and art
history, classics, drama, East Asian
languages and cultures, English, his
tory, linguistics, music, philosophy,
religious studies and the five depart
ments of the Division of Literatures,
Cultures and Languages (DLCL).
Humanities Outreach Officer
Corrie Goldman said the disciplines
share one important commonality.
"These are all ways human beings
process the world around them,"
Goldman said.
Amid the economic belt-tighten
ing of recent years, many students
have opted for majors that they view
as more practical rather than those
within the humanities. According to
a 2009 New York Times article, the
humanities constitute less than half
of college degrees earned than they
did during the mid- to late 19605.
Currently, they account for about 8
percent of college degrees nation
wide. At Stanford, 16 percent of stu
dents are humanities majors.
Debra Satz, senior associate dean
for the Humanities and Arts, said the
initiative intends to "combat the
growing pre-professionalism of stu
dents" who question the relevance
of humanistic study. One strategy is

updating traditional humanities
courses to include more contempo
rary ethical, political and social is
sues.
"We're developing new course
work to showcase big ideas the hu
manities have to offer to people of
the 21st century," Satz said.
According to Elam, another as
pect of the initiative is correcting the
misconception that the humanities
coursework makes students less
competitive applicants for employ
ment or graduate school.
"Students often feel that the hu
manities somehow don't translate
into a job after Stanford that a hu
manities major, or too many human
ities courses, will decrease their
chances of finding employment,"
Elam said. "However, this is a decid
edly false impression. Humanities
majors have gone on from Stanford
to a wide variety of careers and pro
fessional schools."
Elam cited the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business, where the
current entering class is composed of
more than 40 percent humanities
majors. Humanists matriculate in
large numbers to other professional
schools, such as law and medicine.
Goldman noted that, in the rapidly
evolving workplace, employers
value the well-rounded nature of hu
manities students.
"A creative, nimble mind is valu
able in an era where the assembly
line is going away," she said.
Associate professor of history
Robert Crews, who serves as the di
rector of his department's under
graduate studies, argued that the
most powerful benefits of the hu
manities extend beyond a student's
ultimate career path. Humanist
study, he said, prepares students to
become citizens of the world.
"A lot of Stanford students want
to save the world, but we can't do
that until we see how it got to its
present, broken state," Crews said.
