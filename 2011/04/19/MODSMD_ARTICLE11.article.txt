## HIGH FLIERS 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI STAFF WRITER 
Striding forward with coffee in hand,
Shaughnessy Brown 'l4 sports a
beige jacket that looks like it once be
longed to Amelia Earhart. And it's no
surprise. Brown exudes enthusiasm
whenever she speaks about flying, occasional
ly bursting out in laughter when she makes a
wry comment. Her love of the sport is appar
ent.
"It's death defying and wonderful!"
Brown exclaimed, blue eyes sparkling as she
described the exhilaration of the Hammer
head Stall, an aeronautical nosedive.
Brown belongs to a small but passionate
population on campus: the Stanford pilots.
Other students who are part of this special
ized society include Nate Stockham 'll and
Devin Banerjee 'll. Despite their different
backgrounds, these three share the same
seemingly innate call to fly.
"I don't think you'll ever really know [why
some people love flying]," Stockham said.
Along with having a basic Private Pilot Li
cense (PPL), Stockham is licensed to fly
multi-engine planes and gliders as well and is
eligible to be hired to fly commercially.
"It's one of those things that [because of]
some strange wiring or set of predispositions,
you just know it," he said. "It's very funda
mental. It's just like a basic drive to eat."

When others were still caught up in dri
ver's education, the three student pilots were
already getting a head start on operating
other kinds of vehicles.
Brown began pilot training in her home
town, Idaho Falls, Ida. when she was 16 years
old. She started training on crop dusters, pes
ticide-spraying planes that swoop low enough
to tangle their wheels in vines on the ground.
"They could fly in very, very crazy pat
terns," Brown said, who used the planes for
training but has never actually dusted crops,
she said light-heartedly.
Banerjee, former editor in chief of The
Stanford Daily, discovered a love for flight
even earlier in life. As a young boy, he would
go to runways with his parents to watch
planes take off. In high school, he was able to
actively pursue his passion by working as a
tutor in order to subsidize the high cost asso
ciated with getting a license. After earning
$B,OOO out of the required $lO,OOO, his parents
gave him their blessing and the difference to
start training for a pilot's license.
"She doesn't tell me this," Banerjee said,
referring to his mother, "but I've heard from

my dad and my sister that for the time I'm fly
ing, she can't do anything. So she might be at
work ... but she'll sit around waiting for my
call."
"That's why I can't ever fly up here [at
Stanford]," he added.
Stockham's parents had similar misgivings
initially but have now warmed up to the idea
of having a pilot for a son, especially as it gives
them first-class passenger seats and a bird's
eye view of the world. Right before the start
of the school year, his parents joined him to
traverse the country from his hometown of
Birmingham, Ala. all the way to Stanford. It
was his longest flight ever, one which took two
days because of the limited capabilities of his
small aircraft.
"It goes about 130 miles per hour," Stock
ham said. "And there's just a range limitation.
You can go about 700 nautical miles on a full
tank, but you don't want to push that. So you
end up doing 300 or 400 mile legs."

The nonchalant tone that the students
maintain while describing their harrowing ex
periences in the sky and the ease with which

they use aeronautical jargon, such as "air
space" and "VORs" (Very High Frequency
Omni Range), are reflective of how extensive
required training is for students to earn flying
certification.
Pilots must have a minimum of 40 hours of
flying time before they can take the pilot's
test, which includes written, oral and practical
components.
"A lot of very stupid things can go wrong,"
Brown said. "TTiey have you practice a turn
around a point, for example. Well, what hap
pens if you choose a point that actually
moves? Like a cow on a field, that's a beauti
ful point! And then you're like, is the cowing
moving? The cow is moving. Minus one."
This minor detail still slightly rankles Brown,
who opted for what appeared to be a stationary
semi-truck in one of her practical exams, which
turned out not to be stationary at all.
Extensive training has come in handy for
these student pilots, such as when Banerjee
was faced with making a split-second decision
in the air. After countless hours in a classroom
learning flight safety and many more seated
besides an instructor in flight, he was ready to
embark on his first solo flight, a required and
highly anticipated milestone on the path to ob

taining a private license.
Banerjee was flying from Van Nuys Air
port just north of Los Angeles to another air
port about 100 miles away in Bakersfield. Al
though encountering a mountain pass was
supposed to be his only obstacle, an unexpect
ed Southern California fire required him to
make a critical decision in the air.
"I was coming up to this mountain, and
suddenly the smoke descended or something,
and I found myself in the smoke," Banerjee
said. "And it wasn't just that I couldn't see ...
I knew I was coming up to a mountain."
Weighing the slight but catastrophic
chance of death against the disappointment
and annoyance of having to re-do his solo,
Banerjee opted to turn back, a choice which
may seem obvious to a bystander, but to the
budding pilot, it is not so simple.
"That's probably one of the best decisions
I've ever made, both in flying and not in fly
ing," Banerjee said.

The aeronautical world is heavily male
dominated, a fact that Brown was quick to
discover in training. To her, however, this was
not a deterrent; on the contrary, it spurred her
on to prove herself, especially after growing
up in the traditional, gender-segregated town
of Idaho Falls.
"Girls weren't really encouraged to go into
engineering as much," Brown said. "They
were expected to stay home. My friends are
starting to get married. So it was very nice to
enter a very male industry."
On training flights with male instructors,
Brown grew frustrated with questions she felt
were patronizing such as "Are you feeling
seasick?" and "Do you want to stop?" Brown
recalled one point when her instructor, an ex-
Navy Seal, yelled at her to be more assertive.
She acquiesced and swung the plane around
in a fifty-degree bank, proving her assertive
ness quite convincingly.
Brown, Stockham and Banerjee common
ly noted their love of night flying. Whether it
is the beauty of the lights on the runway or the
extra challenge, the high risk associated with
such flights do not keep the nighttime from
being a favorite time to fly.
"It's just incredible ... and it has a kind of
desolate terror, because when you go flying
next to the Pacific Ocean, you can't see any
thing," Stockham said. "It's just a flatness that
opens up into nothing. And you're kind of
hooking yourself onto the lights of the city
above you, and you have this abyss on your
left. It's an entirely different world."
