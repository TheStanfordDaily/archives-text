## I HAVE TWO HEADS Fuzzy Wuzzy Wasn't Fuzzy, Was He? 
### Rachel Kolb 
At one point or another dur
ing my time at Stanford, I at
tended one of those assem
blies in which the speaker attempt
ed to break the ice by having stu
dents self-identify with a number of
questions. Are you from the U.S. or
overseas? Did you go to a public or
a private high school? Are you a
techie or a fuzzy? I'm sure that his
only purpose was to exhibit the di
versity of Stanford students, but this
last one made me recoil.
Now, if you're sensing that I have
a problem with the overuse of the
terms "techie" and "fuzzy," you're
right. That problem does not stem
from a personal crisis during this
particular moment, I didn't suffer
from indecision but instead raised
my hand resolutely as "fuzzy." In
general terms, this is absolutely the
word to describe me, just as I have
friends who are doubtlessly techies
and whose areas of proficiency be
wilder my English-major vocabu
lary. In general terms, I do believe
that the words "techie" and "fuzzy"
are applicable categorizations of
how different types of people gravi
tate toward different academic
fields. My problem, however, is that
using those words can in itself be
self-limiting, implicitly holding us
back from the multidisciplinary in
terests that, if nothing else, make
life more interesting.
The so-called techie-fuzzy divide
is so well integrated into the Stan
ford campus culture that I wonder
how many of us question the binary
assumptions behind those terms.
You see (as horrifying as it might be
for a fuzzy to admit), I like science, I
don't grasp its complexities as easi
ly as some techies do, but in one por
tion of my brain, less dominant but
still thriving, I do understand and
get very excited about it. On the op
posite end of the spectrum, I have
several techie friends who dive into
fuzzy things in their spare time. As a
freshman, I felt startled when I dis
covered that one of my hard-core
biology major friends loved poetry
and had read almost as many classic
novels as I had, but since then, I've
encountered many physics, engi
neering and computer science ma
jors in my writing classes and find
their perspective refreshing.
This multifaceted outlook is one
of the most invigorating aspects of
being at Stanford. It's no secret that
the University wants us to learn in a
multidisciplinary way, with GERs
and academic departments like
Human Biology that integrate
scholarly work from diverse fields.
The world is becoming a more col
laborative place as well, requiring
minds that can understand multiple
perspectives. However, there are in
stances, even at Stanford, where this
wonderful merging of the divide
does not happen. These instances
sometimes extend to comments
that Stanford students themselves
make.
As many friends as I have who
alternate between using different
sides of their brains, as it were, I also
know people who, once labeling
themselves as either techie or fuzzy,
cling to such terms for dear life.
"Don't talk to me about that. It's
over my head," my humanities
friends say when science enters the
conversation. Why? Because

they're "too fuzzy." On the other
hand, some science majors I know
use their very status as science ma
jors to justify why they dislike, say,
writing or philosophy. "I'm a techie.
My brain doesn't work that way."
While I'm not denying that certain
academic subjects come easier to
some people than others, it despairs
me to see some of the most intellec
tually talented people I know dis
miss alternative spheres of knowl
edge rather than broaden their
horizons. The danger to the so
called techie-fuzzy divide is that, in
prompting us to define ourselves as
one thing and not the other, it can
inadvertently stunt our curiosity.
What is more, the more knowl
edge we gain, the more we realize
about the nature of knowledge it
self: among others, it does not obey
artificial divides such as the insub
stantial terms "techie" and "fuzzy."
Insight into one field can lend new
energy to another. Even the lan
guage that human beings use to di
vide the abstract entity of knowl
edge changes over time: to cite one
example, all of the areas of science
that we study today used to be
clumped together under the name
of natural philosophy, back when
the divide between philosophizing
and true scientific inquiry was less
clear. In more recent history, all of us
at Stanford used to take classes in
many diverse areas math, Span
ish and art and I have to hope
that the mental flexibility we had
during those middle and high school
days will not go to waste with the in
creased specialization that begins
during our undergraduate years.
Yet are the terms "techie" and
"fuzzy" just another facet of our
quirky Stanford outlook? My par
ents raise their eyebrows when I
start referring to myself as a fuzzy,
and other people from outside
Stanford only assume that I walk
through life with a vast pot of
knowledge at my fingertips. Which,
in truth, I do. Maybe it's better for us
to stop quibbling, stop drawing lines
in the sand, and learn.
