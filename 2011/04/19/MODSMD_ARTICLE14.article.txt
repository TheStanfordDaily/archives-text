# FRESHLY BAKED
## Gold and Silver 
### Tim Moon 
A couple of nights ago, I
bounced into the kitchen to
make a Bagel Bite when I
walked in on a couple of friends
crisping up Dino Nuggets in the
panini press. As we waited for our
Bagel Bite and Dino Nuggets to get
hot and crispy, we started shooting
the shit, and somehow the subject of
nursery rhymes and other songs
from childhood came up.
After we'd just finished debating
the merits of "Humpty Dumpty"
(consensus: it's very silly) and the
horror of the old woman who lived
in a shoe (seriously, go read that one
again), someone brought up how
much he hated the song about gold
and silver friends. You know, the
one that goes Make new friends, but
keep the old/One is silver and the
other gold. His argument was that
since there's no question that gold is
better than silver, a song that's try
ing to make kids respect both new
and old friends is shooting itself in
the foot by making one group gold
and the other silver.
But which friends are supposed
to be gold, and which are supposed
to be silver? The song isn't especial

ly clear on this point, but I think we
can assume from how they're or
dered that the new friends are the
silver ones, and the old friends are
the gold ones (and old also rhymes
with gold). But even if gold is better
than silver, are new friends that
much worse?
Silver may not be as good as
gold, but it is very shiny. (I suppose
gold is just as shiny, but shiny just
seems to go better with silver.)
Know what else is shiny and flashy?
New friends. Everything they do
seems so fun and smart and cute;
everything they talk about is stuff
you haven't heard about before and
is super interesting having shiny
new friends is exciting.
But as you keep getting to know
them, some of that shininess might
start to dull maybe you'll realize

that you lapse into awkward si
lences when straying out of the one
or two topics you normally talk
about, or maybe they'll reveal
things about their personality that
make you make that noise where
you grit your teeth and breathe in
through them and the frequency
and enthusiasm of your interactions
might start dwindling.
Or maybe the shininess won't
dull. Maybe you'll realize that
they're actually that super cool and
see that you've made a real BFF.
Those are your old/gold friends
the ones you love despite their
faults, the ones you're going to miss
the most when you go separate
ways after graduating. Having shiny
new friends is exciting, and you def
initely want to have them (all gold is
gauche have you seen Donald
Trump's apartment?), but do you
want to invest in gold?
College can really mess with these
lines. With all the fascinating people
around us, we're always making
shiny new friends, and silver can start
to look like gold so quickly, especial

ly if you're living together in the
friend incubators that are dorms and
houses. But just as easily as new
friends become old friends, old
friends can become forgotten
friends; I'm sure that many of us have
been really tight with one friend one
year (or even one or two quarters),
only to end up drifting apart the next,
for any number of reasons.
It's awful, but also somewhat
understandable given how busy
Stanford students are, juggling so

many friends isn't always the easi
est thing to do, especially when
there are always shinier new
friends to get to know. This is
where being able to put ourselves
in our friends' shoes really helps.
Maybe our busyness is actually
coming across as aloofness, or
maybe that friend's aloofness is ac
tually busyness. We can't know
what everyone really thinks about
us (and how awful that would be),
but being considerate and under
standing goes a long way in keep
ing the old (friends).
Four years go by really quickly; it
seems like just yesterday that I was
moving into Larkin and goggling at
how beautiful Stanford was. At the

end of those four years, you might
have a pile of people you stayed
close with, a pile of people you felt
okay drifting away from and a pile of
people you drifted away from and
wish you'd gotten to know better.
How you can minimize that last
group is up to you (I'm the last per
son to be giving advice on that), but
maybe there's one last insight to be
learned from that song polishing
your gold every once in a while might
be hard to do, but restoring tarnished
gold is so much harder, no?

rhymes to see what other insights he's

want to invest in gold?
College can really mess with these
lines. With all the fascinating people
around us, we're always making
shiny new friends, and silver can start
to look like gold so quickly, especial

ly if you're living together in the
friend incubators that are dorms and
houses. But just as easily as new
friends become old friends, old
friends can become forgotten
friends; I'm sure that many of us have
been really tight with one friend one
year (or even one or two quarters),
only to end up drifting apart the next,
for any number of reasons.
It's awful, but also somewhat
understandable given how busy
Stanford students are, juggling so

many friends isn't always the easi
est thing to do, especially when
there are always shinier new
friends to get to know. This is
where being able to put ourselves
in our friends' shoes really helps.
Maybe our busyness is actually
coming across as aloofness, or
maybe that friend's aloofness is ac
tually busyness. We can't know
what everyone really thinks about
us (and how awful that would be),
but being considerate and under
standing goes a long way in keep
ing the old (friends).
Four years go by really quickly; it
seems like just yesterday that I was
moving into Larkin and goggling at
how beautiful Stanford was. At the

end of those four years, you might
have a pile of people you stayed
close with, a pile of people you felt
okay drifting away from and a pile of
people you drifted away from and
wish you'd gotten to know better.
How you can minimize that last
group is up to you (I'm the last per
son to be giving advice on that), but
maybe there's one last insight to be
learned from that song polishing
your gold every once in a while might
be hard to do, but restoring tarnished
gold is so much harder, no?

Tim is going back through nursery
rhymes to see what other insights he's
missed. Tell him your favorite one at
