# FRESHLY BAKED
## Gold and Silver 
### Tim Moon 
A couple of nights ago, I
bounced into the kitchen to
make a Bagel Bite when I
walked in on a couple of friends
crisping up Dino Nuggets in the
panini press. As we waited for our
Bagel Bite and Dino Nuggets to get
hot and crispy, we started shooting
the shit, and somehow the subject of
nursery rhymes and other songs
from childhood came up.
After we'd just finished debating
the merits of "Humpty Dumpty"
(consensus: it's very silly) and the
horror of the old woman who lived
in a shoe (seriously, go read that one
again), someone brought up how
much he hated the song about gold
and silver friends. You know, the
one that goes Make new friends, but
keep the old/One is silver and the
other gold. His argument was that
since there's no question that gold is
better than silver, a song that's try
ing to make kids respect both new
and old friends is shooting itself in
the foot by making one group gold
and the other silver.
But which friends are supposed
to be gold, and which are supposed
to be silver? The song isn't especial

ly clear on this point, but I think we
can assume from how they're or
dered that the new friends are the
silver ones, and the old friends are
the gold ones (and old also rhymes
with gold). But even if gold is better
than silver, are new friends that
much worse?
Silver may not be as good as
gold, but it is very shiny. (I suppose
gold is just as shiny, but shiny just
seems to go better with silver.)
Know what else is shiny and flashy?
New friends. Everything they do
seems so fun and smart and cute;
everything they talk about is stuff
you haven't heard about before and
is super interesting having shiny
new friends is exciting.
But as you keep getting to know
them, some of that shininess might
start to dull maybe you'll realize

that you lapse into awkward si
lences when straying out of the one
or two topics you normally talk
about, or maybe they'll reveal
things about their personality that
make you make that noise where
you grit your teeth and breathe in
through them and the frequency
and enthusiasm of your interactions
might start dwindling.
Or maybe the shininess won't
dull. Maybe you'll realize that
they're actually that super cool and
see that you've made a real BFF.
Those are your old/gold friends
the ones you love despite their
faults, the ones you're going to miss
the most when you go separate
ways after graduating. Having shiny
new friends is exciting, and you def
initely want to have them (all gold is
gauche have you seen Donald
Trump's apartment?), but do you
want to invest in gold?
College can really mess with these
lines. With all the fascinating people
around us, we're always making
shiny new friends, and silver can start
to look like gold so quickly, especial
