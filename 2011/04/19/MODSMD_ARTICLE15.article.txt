# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
I write in response to Viviana Arcia's op
ed on President Hennessy's recent executive
order. The order lowered the standard of
proof in student misconduct hearings from
"Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" to "Prepon
derance of the Evidence" in cases where the
student is alleged to have committed a sexu
al assault. "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" is
the standard used in all criminal matters in
the United States. The high standard ensures
against unjust convictions and reduces the
risk of factual errors. The reasonable doubt
standard symbolizes the significance our so
ciety attaches to personal liberty. By con
trast, "Preponderance of the Evidence" is
the lowest standard, typically used in civil
matters, where the only punishment faced by
the accused is a monetary one.
Ms. Arcia's central argument is that Stan
ford is justified in lowering its standard of
proof for sexual assault, because the standard
is lower in criminal cases involving domestic
violence. This is legally and factually wrong.
The burden of proof for criminal domestic vi
olence and sexual assault is "Beyond a Rea
sonable Doubt," like it is for all criminal pro
ceedings not "Preponderance of the Evi
dence." The belief that some crimes have (or

should have) a lower standard of proof defies
common sense. It also flies in the face of the
single most important constitutional protec
tion for a free, just and democratic society:
the presumption of innocence.
Ms. Arcia also claims that only 2 percent
of reports of sexual assault are false. This sta
tistic is both misleading and inaccurate. It is
misleading, because there is no way to deter
mine how many reports of rape are true or
false the accusation is usually one per
son's word against the other, making "truth"
impossible to determine.
The claim is also inaccurate, since studies
attempting to pinpoint the percentage of false
reports differ dramatically. A comprehensive
review of studies throughout the United
States, New Zealand and the United King
dom found that estimates of falsely reported
rapes range from 1.5 percent to as much as 90
percent. (Rumney, P. N. S., 65 False Allega
tions of Rape. Cambridge Law Journal 128-
158 (2006)). Ms. Arcia's figure is simply one
guess among many. There is nothing scientific
or reliable about her number.
The ASSU Constitution provides that
University administration, including the
President and Provost, lacks the authority to
alter the rules of the disciplinary process
without amending the ASSU Constitution it

self. The President's unilateral decision, in
the middle of the academic year, to lower the
standard of proof from that guaranteed to
students by the Stanford Judicial Charter of
1997 and the ASSU Constitution is not only
unfair but also likely violates Stanford's con
stitution.
In short, I found Ms. Arcia's Op-Ed not
only ill informed and misleading, but sad.That
the University would adopt a standard typi
cally used when the only stakes are monetary
to adjudicate whether someone should be ed
ucated within its walls speaks volumes about
the value the University places on the educa
tion it provides. The President's recent deci
sion is all the proof I need to know that the
University shows little respect for the rights
of students male or female.

Dear Editor,
In response to last Friday's editorial,
"Freeing Tantalus Time To Fix Entrepre
neurship," we would like to share some ad
ditional entrepreneurship-related re
sources that were not described in The

Daily's editorial.
The Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram (STVP), which is hosted by the De
partment of Management Science and Engi
neering, hosts over 30 classes for both un
dergraduate and graduate students across
campus. These courses, which focus on a
wide variety of entrepreneurship-related
topics, reach over 2,000 Stanford students
every academic year. Details about all of
these classes can be found at
stvp.stanford.edu. In addition, STVP posts
all of the podcasts and videos of our weekly
DFJ Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders lec
ture series online at no charge. These re
sources, which are downloaded tens of thou
sands of times each day, are available to any
one in the world. They can be found at
ecorner.stanford.edu.
Many of our courses are specifically struc
tured to help students learn how to form start
up ventures. These include Technology Entre
preneurship (ENGR 145), Technology Entre
preneurship and Lean Startups (ENGR 245)
and Technology Venture Formation (MS&E
273), where course projects are treated as real
startups, and students develop products, cre
ate business models and have direct contact
with the venture capital community.
STVP is also a member of the
Stanford Entrepreneurship Net
work (SEN), a federation of over
two-dozen entrepreneurship-re
lated programs, centers and stu
dent groups at Stanford. SEN
hosts entrepreneurship-related
events during the entire year and
puts great effort into coordinating
Entrepreneurship Week in Febru
ary by offering dozens of lectures,
workshops and networking activi

ties. In addition, SEN hosts a se
ries of Coaches-on-Call programs
for Stanford students throughout
the year. Details can be found at
sen.stanford.edu.
The founding and growth of
SSE Labs is a tremendous credit
to the spirit of entrepreneurship
among Stanford students and we
are delighted by their wonderful
success. This is yet another exam
ple of the vast number of terrific
resources available to students at
Stanford who are eager to launch
their own ventures.
