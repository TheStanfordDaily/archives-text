## CARD SWEEPS SINGLES Stanford wins eighth straight over USF 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team contin
ued its impressive winning streak Monday,
defeating No. 70 San Francisco 6-1 on a
cloudy afternoon.
No. 8 Stanford (16-5, 4-1 Pac-10) is cur
rently riding an eight-match win streak, and
the players were looking stronger than ever
in their first of three matches this week.

SAN FRANCISCO 1
STANFORD 6
4/18, Taube Tennis Stadium

The Dons (10-8,3-IWCC) came in as the
lowest-ranked team the Cardinal had played
since early February. It is a team motto that
the most important match is always the next
one, but Stanford used the match as an op
portunity to both rest some key players and
let some other players gain some valuable in
game experience.
The decision to toy with the lineup looked a
bit suspect at the beginning of the match
the Dons may have surprised the Cardinal
with their intensity out of the gate.
In the doubles point, the USF duo of Mark
Decastro and Richard Bucalem defeated
senior Ted Kelly and junior Ryan Thacher, 8-
2. Kelly and Thacher don't have a lot of expe
rience together, as Thacher usually teams up
with junior Bradley Klahn.
San Francisco eventually clinched the dou
bles point by pulling out a hard-fought, 8-6
victory at the second spot. Ola Bakke and


KOR VANG/The Stanford Daily
Junior Ryan Thacher had some trouble in a rare doubles matchup alongside senior Ted Kelly, but he
and the No. 8 Stanford men's tennis team responded by winning all six singles matches to defeat USF.
Jacob Hartwig held off a late run by
the Stanford duo of sophomores
Denis Lin and Matt Kandath to
give the Dons an early lead.
That was the last bright spot of the
day for USE
The Cardinal quickly rattled off six
straight victories to win the match
handily, 6-1. The only match to go
to three sets was the contest be
tween Stanford freshman Jamin
Ball and USF's Germain Bahri,
which Ball eventually won in a
super tiebreak 6-3,4-6,1-0.
Ball doesn't have a spot on the
standard lineup but has been a key
reserve for the Cardinal in the past
month and looks to have a bright
future for the Stanford squad.
More impressive than the fact that
the Cardinal has won nine straight
matches is the sheer variety of ways
it has been able to win, and Monday
was no exception. Earlier in the sea
son, the squad had some trouble re
bounding after falling behind in
matches. That was admittedly
against tougher competition, but
the team hardly even batted an eye
after losing the doubles point Mon
day.
This is the final week of the regular
season for the men's tennis squad.
The team faces No. 36 BYU this af
ternoon and then No. 12 California
on Saturday before postseason
play begins next Thursday with the
Pac-10 Championships.
