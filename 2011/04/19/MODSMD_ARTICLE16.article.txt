### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team contin
ued its impressive winning streak Monday,
defeating No. 70 San Francisco 6-1 on a
cloudy afternoon.
No. 8 Stanford (16-5, 4-1 Pac-10) is cur
rently riding an eight-match win streak, and
the players were looking stronger than ever
in their first of three matches this week.

The Dons (10-8,3-IWCC) came in as the
lowest-ranked team the Cardinal had played
since early February. It is a team motto that
the most important match is always the next
one, but Stanford used the match as an op
portunity to both rest some key players and
let some other players gain some valuable in
game experience.
The decision to toy with the lineup looked a
bit suspect at the beginning of the match
the Dons may have surprised the Cardinal
with their intensity out of the gate.
In the doubles point, the USF duo of Mark
Decastro and Richard Bucalem defeated
senior Ted Kelly and junior Ryan Thacher, 8-
2. Kelly and Thacher don't have a lot of expe
rience together, as Thacher usually teams up
with junior Bradley Klahn.
San Francisco eventually clinched the dou
bles point by pulling out a hard-fought, 8-6
victory at the second spot. Ola Bakke and

Junior Ryan Thacher had some trouble in a rare doubles matchup alongside senior Ted Kelly, but he
and the No. 8 Stanford men's tennis team responded by winning all six singles matches to defeat USF.
