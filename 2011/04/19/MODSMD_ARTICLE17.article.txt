4/1 7, Smith Family Stadium

The No. 11 Cardinal looked
dominant in dismantling the bot
tom-dwelling Beavers (18-16, 1-8
Pac-10), continuing its strong Pac
-10 play after taking two of three
from UCLA the weekend before.
Stanford outscored Oregon State
18-2, riding roughshod over its only
nationally unranked conference
foe. With the sweep, Stanford es
tablished a winning conference
record for the first time this year,
moving to 5-4 in the Pac-10 and 30-
8 overall.

The Stanford bats were alive
top to bottom, continuing strong
team play and showcasing some
heads-up baserunning, especially
from junior outfielder Sarah Hass
man, who had a phenomenal series
leading off for the Cardinal. She
finished 4-for-6 with six runs
scored, five stolen bases, five walks
and an RBI, getting on base 10
times in 12 plate appearances. She
leads the team in runs (48), walks
(25) and stolen bases (27) while
ranking second in average (.426)

and on-base percentage (.541).
Cardinal pitching was just as
good, if not better, giving up just
one earned run over the weekend.
For the second straight week, soph
omore Teagan Gerhart pitched in
all three games, earning two com
plete game wins and a save. Ger
hart was outstanding, allowing no
earned runs and just eight hits in
15.2 innings of work while striking
out 15.
