4/1 7, Smith Family Stadium

The No. 11 Cardinal looked
dominant in dismantling the bot
tom-dwelling Beavers (18-16, 1-8
Pac-10), continuing its strong Pac
-10 play after taking two of three
from UCLA the weekend before.
Stanford outscored Oregon State
18-2, riding roughshod over its only
nationally unranked conference
foe. With the sweep, Stanford es
tablished a winning conference
record for the first time this year,
moving to 5-4 in the Pac-10 and 30-
8 overall.

The Stanford bats were alive
top to bottom, continuing strong
team play and showcasing some
heads-up baserunning, especially
from junior outfielder Sarah Hass
man, who had a phenomenal series
leading off for the Cardinal. She
finished 4-for-6 with six runs
scored, five stolen bases, five walks
and an RBI, getting on base 10
times in 12 plate appearances. She
leads the team in runs (48), walks
(25) and stolen bases (27) while
ranking second in average (.426)

and on-base percentage (.541).
Cardinal pitching was just as
good, if not better, giving up just
one earned run over the weekend.
For the second straight week, soph
omore Teagan Gerhart pitched in
all three games, earning two com
plete game wins and a save. Ger
hart was outstanding, allowing no
earned runs and just eight hits in
15.2 innings of work while striking
out 15.
The Cardinal started red hot on
Friday, scoring in each of the first
four frames en route to a 7-0 victo
ry. Gerhart allowed just two hits
and one walk. It was her second
shutout of the year.
Stanford broke open the game
in the third, scoring three runs to
make it 5-0. Junior infielder Ashley
Hansen led off the inning with a
blast to center, her sixth home run
of the year. Stanford scored again
as freshman Danielle Miller singled
and then scored on sophomore in
fielder Jenna Rich's double. Rich, in
turn, scored two batters later when
senior infielder Melisa Koutz sin
gled to left. Stanford tacked on an
other run in the fourth as Hassman
scored on an error by OSU short
stop Nikki Chandler. The final run
came in the sixth when Koutz plat
ed Rich for her second RBI. Ore
gon State's Tina Andre ana took the
loss, moving to 5-6 overall.
Saturday's action saw more of
the same, except with senior Ashley
Chinn starting on the mound. She
was sharp while getting plenty of
run support in an 8-1 win, moving
her to 14-2 on the year. Chinn
struck out four while allowing just
one run in 5.1 innings of work. Ger
hart pitched the final five outs for
her second save.
Stanford once again struck early
and often, helped by aggressive
baserunning. The team managed a
season-high seven steals, led by
three from Hassman, who also fin
ished 3-for-3 from the plate with
three runs scored. Freshman Corey
Hanewich and Rich would also
both finish with three hits, an RBI
and a run scored.
The Cardinal wasted no time,
posting three runs on four singles
and four stolen bases in the first in
ning. Hansen singled in Hassman to
open the scoring. Rich followed
with an RBI single of her own for
the second run and then proceeded
to steal two bases, including home,
for the third run. Stanford scored
again in the second. With two outs,
Hassman walked, stole second and
then scored on a Hanewich single
to center.
The Beavers finally got on the
board for the first time all weekend
when Oregon State pitcher Paige
Hall took Chinn deep to left field in
the fourth. Despite her offensive
effort, Hall earned the loss, falling
to 6-4.
Stanford's offense never relent
ed, scoring four more in the sixth to
double the lead. After loading the
bases, sophomore pinch hitter Alix

Van Zandt was hit by Hall, bringing
in the first run. Oregon State con
tinued to hurt itself when an error
by second baseman Maggie Dore
mus allowed two more runners to
score. Junior Maya Burns then sin
gled in the eighth and final run of
the game.
Sunday's game was a rematch of
Friday's starters, and while closer,
the result was similar. Oregon State
continued to be stymied by Ger
hart, once again not allowing an
earned run in a complete game win.
She once again fanned seven in
seven innings, running her record to
16-6 and lowering her ERA to 1.77.
For the third straight game, Stan

ford scored in the first. Miller and
Rich each picked up RBI on a sin
gle and a sac fly, scoring Hassman
and Hansen. Oregon State man
aged their first run against Gerhart
on a sac fly in the fourth, cutting the
lead to one. Stanford responded in
the bottom of the inning as Miller
singled in Hanewich to make it a 3-
1 final score.
The Cardinal will hit the road for
its next five games, playing tonight
at Pacific, followed by a three-game
series at rival Cal, currently No. 3 in
the nation.
