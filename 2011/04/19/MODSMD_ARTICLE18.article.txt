## Lacrosse clinches share of conference title, No. 1 seed 
### â€”Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team had a strong weekend on the
road, prevailing over Oregon 18-13
on Friday in Eugene. With the win,
the No. 7 Cardinal clinched at least a
share of the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) title and the top
seed in the MPSF Tournament.
Oregon came out of the gate
strong, taking a 3-1 lead in the first
six minutes. Stanford responded
with six of the next seven goals to
open up a 7-4 lead. The Cardinal
never relinquished its lead, as senior
midfielder Karen Nesbitt scored
the first three goals of the second
half to put the game out of reach.
Senior midfielder Leslie Foard
converted all five of her free-position
shots to lead Stanford, and she added
an assist, three draw controls and four
forced turnovers. Nesbitt had four
goals, while senior attacker Sarah
Flynn and sophomore midfielder
Jacquelyn Candelaria each had three.
For the game, the Cardinal out
shot the Ducks 35-26 and had only
14 turnovers compared to Oregon's
23.
Just two games remain in the
regular season: the MPSF finale at
UC-Davis on Wednesday and the
regular-season finale at Northwest
ern on Sunday. Then it's on to the
MPSF Tournament in Moraga,
Calif., where the Cardinal will have
the No. 1 seed.
