# Referees' apologies aid no one

W W bat a weekend of NBA basket
ball. Never thought I'd say those words,
particularly when I'm not being sarcastic,
but it's true.This weekend the NBA actu
ally got me interested. For once, the first
round of the NBA Playoffs appears to be
a Cakewalk for no one, meaning that rel
evant games are actually being played by
teams like the Pacers and Grizzlies.
In the eight Game Is played over the
weekend, the average margin of victory
was only 6.125 points, and the only two
teams to win by more than eight points
were underdogs. Seven of the eight un
derdogs led at some point in the fourth
quarter, while the other (Philadelphia)
was within one point in the final 2:30. In
fact, if it wasn't for Ray Allen's clutch
three-pointer or Carmelo Anthony's
fourth-quarter meltdown, we would al
ready be looking at exactly one win from
every seed in the first eight gamea
For a neutral fan, these games have al
ready had plenty of highlighta Allen's
aforementioned three, Nene's "foreign
facial" (lan Eagle's words, not mine),
Chris Paul's one-handed bullet pass and
singlehanded destruction of the whole
Laker defense, Shane Bather's three to
answer Matt Bonner, Dwight Howard
laying down the most dominant per
formance of the playoffs in a loss, Derrick
Rose willing his team to a last-second
comeback... the list goes on and on.
For a fan of one of the losing sides,
there are probably many other things
going through your mind: the Pacers' of
fensive strategy in the final minutes,
Manu Ginobili's injury, Anthony's offen
sive foul (c'mon, it's not like Paul Pierce
has ever flopped), Amare Stoudemire's
lack of touches in the final two minutes,
the complete disappearances of Pau
Gasol and 60 percent of the Magic's start
ing lineup, etc.
And if you're a Nuggets fan, you
might be thinking about a certain no-call
on a tip-in by Kendrick Perkins that gave
the Thunder a late lead that it held the
rest of the way. I mean, it was only one of
the clearest goaltends of all time that
changed momentum in the final 70 sec
onds of a playoff game. Head coach
George Karl was livid about the call after
the game, which he felt led to his team's
loss.
But don't worry, Nuggets fans, all is
well. The NBA released a statement yes
terday saying that the call was wrong.
Whew. That puts every complaint to
rest. I mean, as long as the NBA knows
that the call was wrong, it doesn't matter
who won the game. In fact, the NBA
should start instructing its referees to
make whatever calls they feel like.Then,
after the game, the league can announce
which calls were right and which were
wrong, and everything will be settled.
Problem solved.
Oh wait, there's one more thing. Be
fore admitting mistakes, the league has to
make sure to go fine players and coaches
who comment on the refereeing. Be
cause let 's be honest, the players involved
and the coaches a few feet away from the
action have no idea what happened and
therefore have no grounds to comment.
Instead, the NBA should promote the
idea that its referees make every call per
fectly, so any complaints about officiating
are slanderous and should result in fines.
Except that calls that the NBA admits
are wrong, of course.
Ta-da! Any questions?
Okay, I've got some myself What
good possibly comes out of admitting
that the call was wrong? People must
think it does something, because just
about every league is doing it. Just
Google "referees admit bad call" and see
the quarter-million results. Did any of the
losing teams get any peace of mind out of
this? Are games called more fairly now?
If the only incentive a referee has to get a
call right is to avoid backlash, you've got
some bigger issues with your referees.
Ifyouwanttofind something positive
about admitting incorrect calls, you could
say that at least these leagues are coming
to terms with the fact that their referees
aren't Turing machines that just spit out
correct answers. Great. So why can't any
one else admit that the referees make
mistakes? Does it hurt the league's repu
tation that much more when a player
points out that it was a forward lateral
compared to when a league representa
tive does? When a coach is asked about a
19-2 deficit in free-throw attempts, what
should he say? Within the first 10 results
of the 7.6 million from Googling "fine
comments referees," you get Kobe, Shaq,
