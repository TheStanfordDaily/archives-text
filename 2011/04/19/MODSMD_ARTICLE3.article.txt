## Burke talks French Africa exploration 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Edmund Burke 111, professor of
history at UC-Santa Cruz, spoke
about the work and customs of
French anthropologists working in
Morocco at the turn of the 20th cen
tury yesterday.
The lecture, entitled "Extreme
Ethnography: France and the Ex
ploration of North Africa," high
lighted the discoveries and habits of
French ethnographers in the years
before France gained colonial rule
there in 1912.

Burke said that although France
was the best positioned of the Euro-
pean powers to colonize Morocco, it
knew little about this land.
"By 1900, Morocco was largely
unknown to Europeans, a kind of
Tibet on the doorstep of Europe,"
Burke said.
While researching his new book,
"The Ethnographic State: France
and the Invention of Moroccan
Islam, 1890-1925," Burke discov
ered that French explorers adopted
different behaviors in the hope of
blending into Moroccan society. As
they trekked Morocco's Atlas
Mountains, explorers dressed in na
tive garb and at times tried to pass
themselves off as beggars.
"What made me bolt upright was
when I started to notice the details
of the disguises and realized the ex
tremes of their behavior," he said.
"The more I thought about it, the
more I found it weird."
Burke told the story of Charles
de Foucauld, who in 1883 traveled
through Morocco's mountains
dressed as a Moroccan Rabbi. His
book about his travels garnered him
fame back in France. Burke noted
that during this time, the French ad
mired their explorers in the same
way people looked up to astronauts
in America during the 19705.
Subsequent explorers would em
ploy other tactics to try to look in
conspicuous. Some would travel
barefoot. Others traveled armed
and with mules, which served the
undesired purpose of making them
stand out. Burke said that their
goals included serving their empire.
"Ardent patriots, their decision
to explore the Sahara and especial
ly Morocco was, above all, a patriot
ic one," he said. "By mapping previ
ously unknown territories for

France, they were contributing to
the expansion of the empire and
even more to the spread of
progress."
Students had favorable reviews
of the professor's lecture. Stephanie
Hassell, a third-year doctoral stu
dent in history, said she enjoyed the
discussion portion of the talk, in
which the research approaches of
French and British explorers of that
age were compared. She also
learned more about French ethnog
raphers' use of disguise.
"I didn't know that the practice
of disguise was so prominent," Has
sell said. "I didn't know that this was
a common practice for French
ethnographers, and so I was imme
diately curious as to the extent to
which British ethnographers did
that."
Erin Pettigrew, also a third-year
doctoral student in history, said she
found the talk fascinating. Petti
grew's area of concentration is
African history. She plans to con
duct research in the West African
nation of Mauritania.
This quarter she is teaching a
course called "Colonial Anthropol
ogists and the Production of Knowl
edge about Africa: Inadvertent Im
perialists." Burke's talk brought up
some points to think about as Petti
grew proceeds with her studies.
"It made me think about my identity as
a non-African and how that can affect the
sort of information that one gets in inter
views, " Pettigrew said. "I definitely do not
dress in disguise, but I've thought about
that as being something that can help you
or something that could work against you
and what that could mean for my own
work."
The lecture was co-sponsored by
the Mediterranean Studies Forum,
the Center for African Studies and
the French Culture Workshop.
