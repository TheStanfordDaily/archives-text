# Profros trickle into Farm
## Later Admit Weekend date prompts many to visit in advance 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
This year, the crowds of eager
prospective freshmen (ProFros)
have begun to trickle in a little
earlier than usual. That's because
Admit Weekend ends April 30, the
day before the Student Intent to
Register (SIR) deadline, when
prospective students must commit
to a college.
The closeness of the deadline
likely prompted some ProFros
and their parents to visit before
Admit Weekend, leading to a
spike in early arrivals compared to
previous years.
"If they come during Admit
Weekend, they basically have
about a day to make the decision,
so I think it's purely because peo
ple want to make up their minds
earlier and don't want to leave it
until the very last minute," said
ASSU Vice President-Elect Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, who is
also an Admit Weekend organiz
er.
Admits who visit early are
paired with room hosts (RoHos)
who indicated a willingness to
host a Pro Fro earlier in the quar
ter. Though the team has been
able to find enough hosts for the
early-arrivals, it has faced certain
challenges.
"I think fewer people expect to
have to be RoHos outside of
Admit Weekend, so not as many
people have listed that as an op
tion, but I think it's been definite
ly manageable on our end," Mac
gregor-Dennis said.
ProFros who arrive ahead of

Admit Weekend will not be able
to partake in the same events, pan
els and showcases that have been
planned for the end of the month.
Nevertheless, Macgregor-Denis
said the Admit Weekend team

works to connect those ProFros
with faculty and administrators
who they might be interested in
meeting.
"They get more of that individ
ual attention, instead of the larger

array of events," he said.
Though many ProFros have
been able to visit in advance, oth
ers are waiting until September to

ProFros gather for lunch with several admission officers at an event during Admit Weekend 2010. Last year's event
brought 1,350 admits to campus. This year's Admit Weekend is scheduled to begin on April 28.
