# Profros trickle into Farm
## Later Admit Weekend date prompts many to visit in advance 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
This year, the crowds of eager
prospective freshmen (ProFros)
have begun to trickle in a little
earlier than usual. That's because
Admit Weekend ends April 30, the
day before the Student Intent to
Register (SIR) deadline, when
prospective students must commit
to a college.
The closeness of the deadline
likely prompted some ProFros
and their parents to visit before
Admit Weekend, leading to a
spike in early arrivals compared to
previous years.
"If they come during Admit
Weekend, they basically have
about a day to make the decision,
so I think it's purely because peo
ple want to make up their minds
earlier and don't want to leave it
until the very last minute," said
ASSU Vice President-Elect Stew
art Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, who is
also an Admit Weekend organiz
er.
Admits who visit early are
paired with room hosts (RoHos)
who indicated a willingness to
host a Pro Fro earlier in the quar
ter. Though the team has been
able to find enough hosts for the
early-arrivals, it has faced certain
challenges.
"I think fewer people expect to
have to be RoHos outside of
Admit Weekend, so not as many
people have listed that as an op
tion, but I think it's been definite
ly manageable on our end," Mac
gregor-Dennis said.
ProFros who arrive ahead of

Admit Weekend will not be able
to partake in the same events, pan
els and showcases that have been
planned for the end of the month.
Nevertheless, Macgregor-Denis
said the Admit Weekend team

works to connect those ProFros
with faculty and administrators
who they might be interested in
meeting.
"They get more of that individ
ual attention, instead of the larger

array of events," he said.

been able to visit in advance, oth

come to the Farm, as this year's
Admit Weekend also coincides
with several national competitions
and proms.
"I had my plane tickets booked
for Admit Weekend when I found
out that I had qualified for the
DECA [a business club] competi
tion," said John Murray of Lake
Oswego, Or. "I would love to go to
Admit Weekend, but I think that
my position as a chapter officer for
my DECA team is a higher priori
ty, especially because I've already
committed to Stanford."
Others, such as Aaron Get
tinger of Sullivan, Indiana, were
also concerned about the date's
proximity to Advanced Placement
exams, which are held the first and
second weeks of May.

"I'm more worried about that
than I would have been given its
closeness to the SIR deadline,"
Gettinger said.
However, many ProFros said
that Admit Weekend would not
play a large role in which school
they ultimately choose. Many have
already committed to attending
Stanford in the fall.
"To be honest, it probably won't
[make a difference]," wrote Viraj
Bindra, a Pro Fro from Singapore,
in an email to the Daily. "Stanford
has been my first choice since the
beginning of the application
process and does not need to con
vince me any more about how
great of a fit it would be."
"Stanford was always my first
choice, especially after I got in
early in December," Gettinger
said.
Like many of his peers, Murray
visited Stanford prior to applying.
"I did all of travel in the spring
of my junior year and the fall of

this year," he said. "After I did all
of my visiting, Stanford was my No.
1 choice so the decision was easy
for me when I found out that I had
been accepted in December."
For the many ProFros arriving
Apr. 28, Admit Weekend will be
less of a factor in their decision
making and more of a preview of
what's to come.
"I want to experience what my
class might be like over the next
four years," Gettinger said. "And
honestly, I want to take a little va
cation to California."
"It's more of an opportunity to
meet some potential classmates, to
get a glimpse into what I'll be
learning and doing these next four
years and to satisfy my hunger to
time travel all the way forward to
September 26," Bindra said. "I
want to launch my Stanford expe
rience as soon as possible."

"To be honest, it probably won't
[make a difference]," wrote Viraj
Bindra, a Pro Fro from Singapore,
in an email to the Daily. "Stanford
has been my first choice since the
beginning of the application
process and does not need to con
vince me any more about how
great of a fit it would be."
"Stanford was always my first
choice, especially after I got in
early in December," Gettinger
said.
Like many of his peers, Murray
visited Stanford prior to applying.
"I did all of travel in the spring
of my junior year and the fall of

this year," he said. "After I did all
of my visiting, Stanford was my No.
1 choice so the decision was easy
for me when I found out that I had
been accepted in December."
For the many ProFros arriving
Apr. 28, Admit Weekend will be
less of a factor in their decision
making and more of a preview of
what's to come.
"I want to experience what my
class might be like over the next
four years," Gettinger said. "And
honestly, I want to take a little va
cation to California."
"It's more of an opportunity to
meet some potential classmates, to
get a glimpse into what I'll be
learning and doing these next four
years and to satisfy my hunger to
time travel all the way forward to
September 26," Bindra said. "I
want to launch my Stanford expe
rience as soon as possible."
