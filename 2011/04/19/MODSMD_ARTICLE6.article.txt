## Study finds diabetes potentially reversible 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the School of Medicine have
discovered that type 2 diabetes is at least in
part an autoimmune disease.Their report,pub
lished in this month's Nature Medicine, shows
that B-cells appear in the inflammation of the
visceral fat that precedes diabetes, and control
ling them with drugs can actually prevent in
sulin resistance in mice on high-fat diets.

"It's exciting to see this kind of discovery,
because I think its going to turn out to be im
portant going forward in how we ultimately
manage this really common and serious dis
ease," said pathology professor Edgar Engle
man, whose lab conducted the study.
Type 2 diabetes occurs after the body's tis
sues become resistant to insulin, the hormone
that triggers cells to take up sugar from the
blood stream. This leads to unregulated fluctu
ations of blood sugar that require constant

management. Type 2 diabetes has always been
viewed as a metabolic disease, though the un
derlying cause of insulin resistance has never
been determined.
"The main thing is that no one has really
known why your tissues become resistant to in
sulin," said Dan Winer, one of the first authors
of the study. "The theory we're putting forward
is that the inflammation that occurs in different
