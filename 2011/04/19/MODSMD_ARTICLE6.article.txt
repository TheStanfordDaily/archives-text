## Study finds diabetes potentially reversible 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the School of Medicine have
discovered that type 2 diabetes is at least in
part an autoimmune disease.Their report,pub
lished in this month's Nature Medicine, shows
that B-cells appear in the inflammation of the
visceral fat that precedes diabetes, and control
ling them with drugs can actually prevent in
sulin resistance in mice on high-fat diets.

"It's exciting to see this kind of discovery,
because I think its going to turn out to be im
portant going forward in how we ultimately
manage this really common and serious dis
ease," said pathology professor Edgar Engle
man, whose lab conducted the study.
Type 2 diabetes occurs after the body's tis
sues become resistant to insulin, the hormone
that triggers cells to take up sugar from the
blood stream. This leads to unregulated fluctu
ations of blood sugar that require constant

management. Type 2 diabetes has always been
viewed as a metabolic disease, though the un
derlying cause of insulin resistance has never
been determined.
"The main thing is that no one has really
known why your tissues become resistant to in
sulin," said Dan Winer, one of the first authors
of the study. "The theory we're putting forward
is that the inflammation that occurs in different
parts of your body, one of them being
the deep visceral fat, contributes to
insulin resistance. And part of that is
insulin resistance that is occurring
because of your immune system at
tacking your own body's proteins."
The study identified key B-cells in
the inflammatory response for the
first time, building upon past work
done by the lab about the inflamma
tion that precedes diabetes. B-cells
normally tell the body to react to spe
cific invading diseases by releasing
antibodies and chemical signals
called cytokines.
The study showed that in type 2
diabetes, the B-cells instruct the body
to react to its own proteins, which ap
pears to cause cells to resist insulin.
Mice treated with a B-cell depleting
drug called anti-CD2O did not devel
op insulin resistance in response to a
high fat diet, while mice not on the
drug did develop insulin resistance.
In addition, the researchers ex
amined antibodies in the blood of 32
obese men, half with insulin resist
ance and half without. Patients with
insulin resistance all had a distinct
profile of antibodies consistent with
those found in insulin resistant mice.
The antibodies were not present in
patients that were still sensitive to in
sulin.These preliminary findings sug
gest that the B-cell immune response
in diabetic mice also occurs in diabet
ic humans.
"We've identified a set of anti
bodies that are pathogenic that
cause insulin resistance which is a
new finding," Winer said.
He acknowledged that this find
ing "doesn't exclude the possibility"
that some of the antibodies found in
insulin-sensitive, obese patients
might be protective.

The new role of antibodies has
also made Winer hopeful that some
day doctors could prevent insulin re
sistance with drugs that regulate the
immune system or even with a vac
cine.
"What's fascinating to me as a
physician is that I have always
thought of this as a chronic and es
sentially irreversible disease, and
once you get started, the only thing
you can really do is control it," Engle
man said. "That's what I had learned.
And what we find is that's not really
true; in fact, this appears to be a dis
ease that's at least partially re
versible."
However, Winer and Engleman
both caution that immune therapies
are still a ways off. Most of the work
done so far has been in animal mod
els, and a link needs to be firmly es

tablished in humans in more exten
sive studies. Controlling the disease
with immunosuppressants is also
risky, since the immune system is
necessary for fighting off infection.
"The idea of using immune drugs
is something that I view as an exper
iment that has to be done as opposed
to something we know is going to
work," Engleman said.
About one in four Americans has
diabetes, making the disorder one of
the most prevalent in the United
States. This growing problem is why
Winer and Engleman both hope to
continue working on the disease.
"It's too big a problem to not
want to continue to work on it," En
gleman said. "It's too important."
