## Prof. Levin wins Clark medal for econ research Award considered 'Baby Nobel,' recognizes young economists 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Economics professor Jonathan Levin '94
won the prestigious 2011 Clark medal, ac
cording to a press release from the Ameri
can Economic Association (AEA). The
medal, named after economist John Bates
Clark, recognizes the nation's most promis
ing economist under the age of 40.
"This award in the past has been won by
many people whose research I've admired
and have been reading since graduate
school," Levin said. "It's an incredible honor
to be recognized."
Levin is the son of Yale President
Richard C. Levin. He studied English and
mathematics at Stanford and obtained a
master's in economics from Oxford in 1996
and a Ph.D. in economics from MIT in 1999.
The Clark award is known as the "baby
Nobel," because of the 32 economists who
have won it, 14 have gone on to win the
Nobel Prize in economics. Past Clark and
Nobel winners include Paul Samuelson and
Milton Friedman.
The AEA cited several areas of Levin's
research in industrial organization in its
award announcement. Levin has studied
subprime lending, health insurance, Internet
markets and how firms and markets interact
with each other.
Levin began his economics career as a
game theorist but became interested in em
pirical research after he came to Stanford.
His later research involves the economics of
auction and auction design, and he currently
teaches an undergraduate class on market
design.
"A lot of my current research is on the
economics of Internet markets," Levin said.
"That's the thing that I've gotten in
terested in [in] the last couple of
years of being in Silicon Valley, and
I've been studying different Inter
net markets for advertising, for e
commerce and the design of online
markets how they're different

from offline markets, the way tech
nology has changed from behavior
and the way that different markets
can be structured."
Next fall, Levin will also start a
three-year term as chair of the de
partment of economics. At the same
time, Levin plans to continue his
current trajectory and expects to
pursue Internet-related research
projects. He will nonetheless keep
an open mind for other projects of
interest.

"I think one of the nice things
about being an academic is, as long
as you keep an open mind, interest
ing questions come up and you can
start to pursue them and see where
they go," he said. "That's always
been the way that I've done re
search in the past, and I expect
that's how I'll continue to do it in
the future."
