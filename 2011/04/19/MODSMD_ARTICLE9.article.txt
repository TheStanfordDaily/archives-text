## Alumni interview pilot program meets target 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
As the newly admitted class of
2015 prepares to converge onto
campus, the Office of Undergradu
ate Education is evaluating the suc
cess of its third and final year of the
alumni interview pilot program.
During the 2010-11 application sea
son, alumni volunteer interviewers
conducted an approximate total of
3,000 interviews, meeting the pilot
program's target goal.
The pilot program was intro
duced as away to offer college ap
plicants the opportunity to learn
about Stanford in a more intimate
setting and to provide the Office of
Undergraduate Admission addi
tional information about candi
dates that might not be easily found
in the written application.
"The University had been ex
ploring to see if we receive a com
prehensive picture of the appli
cant," said Director of Undergradu
ate Admission Bob Patterson. "I
think it adds additional context to
the applicant, either by adding new
information or reinforcing existing
information."
The pilot program began with a
small staff of 378 alumni volunteer
interviewers who worked in a hand
ful of cities: Atlanta, Denver, Port
land, New York City and London.
Three years later, the program grew
to amass 1,061 alumni volunteers
for the 2010-11 reading season. In
terview sites were expanded to in
clude locations in Massachusetts,
Philadelphia, Portland,
Raleigh/Durham, Minneapolis/ St.
Paul and the Washington D.C. area.
According to Patterson, the lo
cations were selected based on sev

eral factors namely, the need to
get a representative sample of the
applicant pool, the geographical
area and the strength of alumni
presence and involvement.
The pilot program required an
incredible amount of logistical
planning and communication
streamlining to run efficiently.
"[We've had] logistical chal
lenges, mostly," Patterson said. "We
train every alum to do the interview.
There's a lot of organization to
work out, such as contacting alumni
and making sure the alums have
enough time to contact students."
Additionally, the admission of
fice is looking into alternative ways
to reach as many interested appli
cants as possible.
"We're trying to look at using
different types of communication
Skype technology or Apple ap
plications or large interview sites
where students can go to," Patter
son said.
The alumni interview option has
been overwhelmingly popular for
applicants. Patterson said 95 per
cent of the students who were of
fered this option chose to take it.
Additionally, overall feedback
from alumni volunteer interviewers
has been positive.
"They've enjoyed the experi
ence of interviewing with students,"
Patterson said.
With the conclusion of the pilot
program, the Office of Undergrad
uate Admission seeks to make the
alumni interview option perma
nent, a decision that will be voted on
by the Academic Council in an up
coming meeting.
