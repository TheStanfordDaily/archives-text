Speak, Memory: Under Milk Wood
Lovers of Dylan Thomas, celebrate! Thomas' masterpiece Under Milk Wood
is coming to Stanford this Spring, for three special evenings. Under Milk
Wood is the inaugural production of the Memory Play season.
Since the premiere of Under Milk Wood in 1953, audiences have thrilled
at Dylan Thomas' lyrical, satirical, deeply moving account of the Welsh
village where he lived. Filled with memories of childhood and old loves,
of fast friends and lost companions, Under Milk Wood evokes away of life
that has faded away, except in the mind's eye and ear. From its deep roots
in Welsh, Thomas' "play for voices" delivers an English like no other, a play
of words and sounds that dazzles us with its wit, wisdom, and song.
Directed by Stanford Summer Theater Artistic Director Rush Rehm.
