## EDITORIAL Techies aren't "sheep" 
### 
You wouldn't know it from
the placid warmth of spring
on the Farm, but there's a
battle raging for the soul of Stan
ford. Even as the University has
launched efforts to save the human
ities from waning student interest,
more and more of the undergradu
ate population is devoting itself to
the study of technical majors, a de
velopment that speaks volumes
about the present and future of
Stanford.
There's no use debating it: un
dergraduate enrollment in comput
er science classes is booming. While
the number of students has in
creased by a steady 20 percent an
nually since 2007, the interest is ac
celerating. This quarter, enrollment
in CS 106A, the first introductory
course for the computer science
major, is up an astounding 120 per
cent from the same time last year.
Many other computer science class
es have nearly doubled in size as
well, and the department has even
had to cap enrollment in some
upper-division courses. This is sure
ly worrying news to Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam Jr., who is quoted by
The Daily in an article from Mon
day that the University has redou
bled efforts to encourage student
enrollment in the humanities.
Part of this trend is undoubtedly
due to the resurgence of the market
for techies, and CS majors in partic
ular. Certainly, employers' insa
tiable demand and the promise of
high-paying jobs after graduation
encourage many students to con
sider entering the field. Yet, it's too
easy to write off such a monumental
shift as a response to starry-eyed
freshmen hoping to be the next
Zuckerbergs.
It is telling that many students
take CS 106A to fulfill the engineer
ing and applied sciences GER, only
to fall in love with the class and
switch majors. CSIO6A professor
Eric Roberts has even recounted
instances in which seniors taking his
course in their last quarter have dis
covered such an affinity for the ma
terial that they express their regret
at not having discovered it sooner.
Of the more than 2000 reviews of
CS 106A on Courseßank, the aver
age rating is 4.5/5 stars; by compari
son, IHUM ratings center around 2-
3 stars. Could it be that CS courses

are simply better taught or more in
teresting than their fuzzy counter
parts?
Stanford is also far from pulling
up its roots as the provider of a
broad, liberal education. Despite
having generally greater unit re
quirements for their majors, all
techies must still take at least seven
quarters of humanities (three in
IHUM, two in PWR, one in a class
that fulfills the Humanities GER,
and one in an EC), while Stanford
only requires three techie classes
(one each in math, natural science
and engineering). Even then, many
fuzzies opt for one of many easy op
tions like Stats 60 or a handful of
coveted introsems, and might never
even enter a research lab, shop class,
or even a techie discussion section.
If we are concerned about the de
cline of the humanities, we should
also encourage fuzzies to take more
than a perfunctory course load in
the hard sciences.
To be sure, the humanities will
never become an obsolete part of a
Stanford education, and the Uni
versity is right to keep an eye on
their declining popularity. Yet, let us
not believe for a second that our
techies are all Deresiewiczian
sheep, slouching "toward a glorified
form of vocational training." As
many students have found, it is not
so hard to believe that writing Java
or C++ might have as much to do
with living authentically or happily
as reading Shakespeare or Plato.
