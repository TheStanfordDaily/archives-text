## Sustainability and Aviation 
### Johnny Bartz 
It's Earth Day this Friday, which
makes this an apt time to share
my thoughts on sustainable trav
el. Anyone who can read a ther
mometer can tell you that our cli
mate is warming, and the science is
not out on thermometers. Green
house gas emissions are the main
culprit this means tailpipes, man
ufacturing, heating/cooling, agricul
ture and of course, flying.
A 2006 IPCC report predicts a
149 percent increase in air traffic by
2030, which under all scenarios is
going to produce nearly twice as
much carbon dioxide by the avia
tion industry, even with technologi
cal innovations. We need to analyze
this figure further to see that air
travel, despite its increase, only
plays a small part of our overall
emissions. Comparing numbers, the
aviation industry uses 3 percent of
fossil fuels worldwide, while the en
tire transportation sector uses 20-25
percent. Yes, flying causes carbon
dioxide emissions. No, not flying
will not even nearly solve our
greenhouse gas emissions problem.
If we want to talk mitigating cli
mate change, the discussion is much
larger than aviation. Air transport is
not an inconsequential part of our
emissions, but I'm a little tired of the
finger pointing at travelers. It also
accounts for roughly 8 percent of
global GDP so it's a net winner
when compared to other industries
in terms of emissions. I remain con
vinced that the cultural exchange
that results from traveling far out
weighs the environmental impacts,
which we can mitigate.
Aside from the carbon dioxide
emissions of air travel, the environ
mental impact of flying is quite con
tentious. Recent attention on the
impacts of contrails suggests that it
is significantly more due to cirrus
cloud formation. Contrails of water
vapor form when the hot, moist air
from engine exhaust cools in the
cold air during cruise. Though they
last in the atmosphere for a much
shorter time than carbon dioxide, a
new paper from Nature Climate
Change by Burkhardt and Karcher
suggests that the effect of contrails
causes much larger net warming
than the carbon dioxide emitted by

aircraft. This research was pub
lished less than a month ago, and al
though it remains full of uncertain
ties, there is possibly a more signifi
cant climate warming effect from
flying than originally thought. Jet
engine technology could be inno
vated so that water condenses out
of exhaust or flight paths could
avoid areas of high ice saturation.
Regardless, buying carbon-offset
credits for your flight has never
been a better idea.
Nonetheless, air travel is a small
part in comparison to the environ
mental challenges we face for the
future. I propose we work along
with the travel industry to make it
more environmentally sustainable.
It is important to note the inno
vations that the airline industry has
made to date. A 2007 Corporate Re
sponsibility Report from Delta
highlights recycling of plastics, cans
and other in flight materials, tech
nology improvements allowing for
quieter, cleaner, more fuel efficient
engines, with a 10 percent increase
over the past decade, installation of

winglets increasing fuel efficiency
by 4 percent and recycled paper and
soy ink is used on printed materials.
The way that the country flies
has also changed. Single engine taxi
is a common practice, especially
after landing. Electric baggage han
dling vehicles are becoming all the
rage. Continuous descent ap
proaches instead of the stair-step
descent save on average 60 gallons
of fuel per flight. Air traffic con
trollers are becoming more efficient
at routing planes, and we are build
ing LEED-certified terminals, such
as the Boston Logan Terminal A
and our very own San Francisco
Terminal 2.
Yet there is still a ways to go. For
starters, the aviation industry is
quite literally locked into using
kerosene-based fuels for at least the
next 30 years due to the slow rate of
technological innovation. Recycling
is often voluntary for flight atten
dants, and some airports are not
even equipped to sort trash. An
A3BO is more fuel-efficient than a
hybrid car, but that's only if it's full.
And I doubt you drive 6500 nautical
miles in your Prius everyday. The
externality of carbon dioxide emis
sions must be incorporated into the
price of travel.
There are several options, one of
which is to crawl back into the cave
so to speak, by ceasing to travel. We
can perpetuate cultural rifts while
we falsely convince ourselves of
making huge progress combating
climate change, or we can think of
solutions. Maybe I've been blinded
by the sunlight at 34,000 feet, but in
my opinion the answer is not neces
sarily travelling less it is travel
ling responsibly. It's a carbon offset
in the price of the ticket. It's lower
carbon alternative fuels, subsidies
for drastic innovations in aircraft
and engine design. It's collabora
tion between environmentalists,
policy makers and innovative in
dustry professionals.
If all else fails, just take a vaca
tion and know that I've got your
back.
