## Mi Primera Vez: Surviving the first weeks in Santiago, Chile 
### Alyssa Green,'12 
I heard someone say the first week is the
hardest," my best friend at Stanford
told me a couple days before I was sup
posed to leave. "Why?" I asked. "I don't
know, that's just what I heard," she told me.
I brushed off the warning with a mere
shrug. I should have heeded the warning
but little could have been done to prepare
myself. Accepted into the program late, I
had less than 12 days, when others had
months, to make a decision whether or not
to go. To say the least, it was the hardest de
cision I've made to date. I took a lot of ad
vice from people who had previously been
abroad who spouted the benefits of going
out of the country and the wonderful time
they had but failed to mention the reality
of the first week. If you had asked me last
week how I had felt, I would have said I re
gretted my decision. Now, after a weekend
in the wonderful port city of Valparaiso, I
love the life in Chile.
Arriving in Chile with fairly insufficient
Spanish language proficiency, getting from
the airport was like climbing Mount Ever
est. Once actually in the country, I wanted
to kick myself for deluding myself into

thinking it would be easy to come to the
country without knowing the language. It's
not like Europe where someone will know
English if you walk far enough. SOLO ES
PANOL! Ordering food was (and is still at
times) a nightmare. The Spanish taught in
school is not Chilean Spanish and people
speak in a lot of slang, dropping letters
from words and making it harder to even
guess what they are talking about. After
going through a weeklong slump where I
didn't want to go out and didn't talk to peo
ple, I sat down determined and began to
write a list of words that would help me get
by day to day. Words I had to memorize in
cluded:
-manuel montt (my train station and the
direction in which to get home because I
was perpetually getting lost)
-pololo (the word for boyfriend. I kept
saying novio and people thought I was en
gaged)
-lata (boring)
-cachai (you understand?)
-1010 (teenager)
-luca (a form of money, equivalent to
four dollars)
-practica (internship)
I finally built up the courage after five
days to say full sentences without long
pauses, urn's or mumbling. I was proud of
learning the Chilean word for party be
cause it's not fiesta. My host mother met me
at the train since I was still having
difficulty finding my way home. Ex
uberantly I told her "Voy a un car
reterra con las otras chicas en la pro
grama! " My host mom looked at me
extremely puzzled and almost fear
ful. "Porque?" she asked. I started to
think she was a little old fashioned
and didn't want me to go to the
party and I started to feel weird. I
replied "Aver personas" (to see
people). She then became even
more puzzled. Turns out I had told
her I was going to a highway with
the other girls and not a party. She
probably thought, '"dios mio,' I
have a street worker for a host
daughter." I learned that night to
never use the word carretera ever
again and that the correct word was
carrete.
"Nada es gratis en Chile" (noth
ing is free in Chile) was an intense
lesson to learn. The bathrooms here
cost 300 pesos, which is less than a
dollar. Some bathrooms really get
you because they don't cost to use
the bathroom, but once you are in
the stall, they don't have toilet tis
sue, and you have to go buy them
from the front. Most people apply
for the Santiago study abroad pro
gram because they think their dol
lar will go farther in Chile, and
sometimes they are even told by
past participants that their dollar
will go farther. It won't. It is expen
sive, especially when you decide to
travel places on top of being in an
other country. Just assume you will
spend a significant amount of
money when you leave the country
and you won't be disappointed with
the amount of money you don't see
in your bank account.
Yet, with all the weird aspects of
Santiago insane amounts of
PDA, palta (avocado) y mayonnesa
(mayonnaise) on any food you
order and the high number of stray
dogs Chile is a wonderful place.
The kindness of the people down
here is amazing: the first day we got
left on the metro because it got too
crowded and a woman who spoke
English helped us find our way
back; there is a universal rule down
here that you cannot deny anyone

water or bread; and one of the best
parts of studying abroad is having a
host family because they love you
as one of their own. My host mom
the other day was talking about
how I could help my 10-year-old
host sister do her hair at her wed
ding in 10 years. Without my family,
I wouldn't have been able to make
it through the first week. It was hard
but it worth the experience.
I'm willing to guess that the last
week will be hard as well because I
won't want to leave.
