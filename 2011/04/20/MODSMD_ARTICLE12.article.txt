## Mi Primera Vez: Surviving the first weeks in Santiago, Chile 
### Alyssa Green,'12 
I heard someone say the first week is the
hardest," my best friend at Stanford
told me a couple days before I was sup
posed to leave. "Why?" I asked. "I don't
know, that's just what I heard," she told me.
I brushed off the warning with a mere
shrug. I should have heeded the warning
but little could have been done to prepare
myself. Accepted into the program late, I
had less than 12 days, when others had
months, to make a decision whether or not
to go. To say the least, it was the hardest de
cision I've made to date. I took a lot of ad
vice from people who had previously been
abroad who spouted the benefits of going
out of the country and the wonderful time
they had but failed to mention the reality
of the first week. If you had asked me last
week how I had felt, I would have said I re
gretted my decision. Now, after a weekend
in the wonderful port city of Valparaiso, I
love the life in Chile.
Arriving in Chile with fairly insufficient
Spanish language proficiency, getting from
the airport was like climbing Mount Ever
est. Once actually in the country, I wanted
to kick myself for deluding myself into

thinking it would be easy to come to the
country without knowing the language. It's
not like Europe where someone will know
English if you walk far enough. SOLO ES
PANOL! Ordering food was (and is still at
times) a nightmare. The Spanish taught in
school is not Chilean Spanish and people
speak in a lot of slang, dropping letters
from words and making it harder to even
guess what they are talking about. After
going through a weeklong slump where I
didn't want to go out and didn't talk to peo
ple, I sat down determined and began to
write a list of words that would help me get
by day to day. Words I had to memorize in
cluded:
-manuel montt (my train station and the
direction in which to get home because I
was perpetually getting lost)
-pololo (the word for boyfriend. I kept
saying novio and people thought I was en
gaged)
-lata (boring)
-cachai (you understand?)
-1010 (teenager)
-luca (a form of money, equivalent to
four dollars)
-practica (internship)
I finally built up the courage after five
days to say full sentences without long
pauses, urn's or mumbling. I was proud of
learning the Chilean word for party be
cause it's not fiesta. My host mother met me
