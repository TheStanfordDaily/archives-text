# Miss FIT: BASICS OF NUTRITION
## 
### Erica Morgan 
I've heard from various sources that nutri
tion is 80 percent of the formula for
achieving fitness and health goals (the
other 20 percent being exercise). While I am
skeptical that it is possible to calculate the
exact weight of diet in sustaining a fit
lifestyle, I concur that diet is likely the most
important component.
To clarify: when I use the term "diet," I
mean a nutrition regimen or away of eating. I
do not use "diet" in the sense that it is most
often used (especially by young women) to
refer to caloric restriction for the purpose of
losing weight. Henceforth, that interpretation
of "diet" shall be referred to as "starvation
diet."
Starvation diets cannot be sustained, are
psychologically and physically counterpro
ductive and have no place in a healthy
lifestyle. Dramatic caloric reductions kill
your metabolism and effectively cause your
body to eat itself, breaking down your own
muscle to feed your survival needs. When
you attempt to return to a "normal" diet,
your body will be quick to pack on fat in case
you decide to starve it again. Make healthy
choices an element of who you are, and don't
treat a starvation stint as a quick fix for the
weekend pizza binge.

On to the lean meat and sweet potatoes!
Frequency:
I believe that meal frequency is extreme
ly important. It makes sense that your body
will perform optimally when it is fed fre
quent, small and high quality meals. Eating

large meals (especially if they are carb
dense) triggers an insulin spike that causes
your body to store the calories it hasn't used
as fat. Infrequent eating slows down your
metabolism and causes fatigue.
I suggest five to seven meals per day. As a
personal rule, I will not go more than 3 hours
without eating. The amount of food con
sumed at each meal will obviously depend
on an individual and on the fitness goal. I
don't recommend counting calories. Calorie
counting can become obsessive, and is al
most impossible to do accurately.

Quantity:
The first and most important rule in de
termining meal size is to practice "intuitive
eating." The idea is simply to listen to your
body. Eat when you're hungry. Eat slowly,
and enjoy the food. Stop when you're full.
This seems so simple, but is shockingly diffi
cult at times. Waiting until you're "hungry"
does not mean waiting until you are doubled
over with cramps. Conversely, it does not
mean "boredom hunger." I used to eat mind
lessly to take a break from work, or because
people around me were eating. It's a worth
while challenge to learn how to feed your
body when it actually needs nutrients.
Knowing when to stop eating is equally
important. Accept that it is not necessary to
finish everything on your plate. When you
are serving yourself buffet style, take small
portions and come back for more if you're
