Kenny Diekroeger homered,
Lonnie Kauppila had three RBI
and the Stanford offense showed
signs of life as the Cardinal got a
much-needed win Tuesday, a 10-3
victory at Santa Clara.
The Cardinal (17-12, 3-6 Pac
-10) entered the game having lost
five of six and had been struggling
mightily at the plate, mustering just
five total runs while being swept by
Oregon State last weekend.
Diekroeger wasted no time getting
the Cardinal on the board, driving
a three-run home run, his second of
the season, over the left-field fence
in the top of the first inning. He
also tacked on an RBI triple later
in the game. The sophomore short
stop, who is widely considered the
de facto leader of the Stanford of
fense, entered the game with just
two hits in his last 23 at-bats.
Santa Clara (14-19) got right
back in the game in the bottom of
the first on a two-out two-run home
run by senior catcher Patrick Terry.
The homer came off Stanford soph
omore pitcher Dean McArdle, who
got the start on Tuesday despite
being Stanford's Sunday starter all
season, which may indicate that
head coach Mark Marquess is con
sidering shifting his rotation
around. McArdle (5-2) hadn't got
ten out of the third inning in his
previous two starts. Yesterday he
went three innings, allowing just
the two runs on two hits with three
strikeouts to earn the win.
Redshirt junior Joe Supple took
the loss for the Broncos. Supple
went two innings and allowed four
runs on three hits.
Stanford's pitching got a boost
yesterday as junior Brian Busick,
one of the team's top pitchers last

season, made his season debut. Bu
sick, who had been out with an
undisclosed injury, went 1.2
shutout innings striking out two.
The Cardinal tacked on runs in
the second and fourth innings and
led 5-3 going into the eighth before
scoring four runs three of which
were unearned to put the game
out of reach. With two outs, Kaup

pila singled home freshman right
fielder Brian Guymon. Sopho
more center fielder Jake Stewart
then reached on an error by the
Broncos' freshman third baseman
Kyle DeMerritt, extending the in
ning. Sophomore left fielder Tyler
Gaffney and Diekroeger followed
with back-to-back triples to stretch
the Cardinal lead to 9-3.

Marquess also toyed with his
lineup Tuesday to try and get an
offensive burst. Guymon started
in right field in place of Austin
Wilson and Marquess gave sopho
more Justin Ringo, seniors Ben
Clowe and Dave Giuliani and
freshman Danny Diekroeger
shots at designated hitter. Guy
mon finished l-for-4 while Ringo
was 0-for-l, Clowe was 0-for-2,
Giuliani had a sacrifice bunt in his
only plate appearance and Danny
Diekroeger, Kenny's younger
brother, singled in his lone at-bat.
The Cardinal pounded out 17
hits a pleasant change from the
team's recent offensive futility
in the win. Kauppila and senior

GAME NOTES: Stanford picked up a mid
week win over Santa Clara on Tuesday,
but has still lost five consecutive confer
ence games. The Cardinal offense, which
has sputtered lately, will have the tough
task of dealing with UCLA's pair of aces,
Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer, who are ex
pected to be Thursday's and Friday's
starters respectively.

Senior catcher Zach Jones, above, had three hits, two runs scored and a
stolen base in Stanford's 10-3 win over Santa Clara Tuesday. Stanford had
struggled to score runs in recent weeks, scoring only five in three games
against Oregon State over the weekend, but exploded for 10 yesterday.
