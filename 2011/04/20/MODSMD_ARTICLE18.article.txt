# Explaining the Bowl finances

### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
With several ques
tions still swirling in
the air following
our investigative
report on Stan
ford's Orange Bowl finances, I decid
ed to use my column this week to clar
ify the issues that the story raised.
As a quick refresher, the report
was the result of a month-long inves
tigation conducted by Ellora Israni, a
Daily staff writer, and myself. The
goal of the story was to ascertain how
much money Stanford gained or lost
from participating in the Orange
Bowl and to put that figure into the
context of what other schools made
or lost from their BCS games. The
final result, in a nutshell, was that
Stanford broke even on the Orange
Bowl (according to the athletic de
partment), placing it right in the mid
dle in terms of profit among the rest
of the BCS teams. We also noted that
Stanford declined to provide finan
cial documentation, so the figure of
zero net income was not independ
ently verified.
Through feedback from individ
ual readers, comments on our website
and comments from a post on
ESPN's Pac-10 blog that extracted
the profit and loss figures for BCS
teams from our story, I gathered that
readers primarily desired clarifica
tion on two topics. First, it was vague
at best what exactly the term "unsold
tickets" referred to. As many Oregon
fans pointed out, the BCS National
Championship Game was filled to
the rafters with fans, with resale web
sites and brokers selling tickets for
well above their face values. Howev
er, we reported (and later corroborat
ed by publishing Oregon's bowl ex
pense report) that the Ducks paid
$555,575 to absorb 1,761 tickets.
Second, to clear any uncertainty, I
will detail the process we went
through in making our calculations of
the profit and loss figures that we
published for the eight public schools
that participated in the BCS, last
year's Orange Bowl participants and
the Pac-10's two non-BCS bowl
teams.

Let's start with the tickets that
went "unsold" or were "absorbed" by
individual schools. In our report, we
did not intend for the term "unsold"
to mean that the university in ques
tion tried to sell those tickets on the
open market and were unable to find
buyers. Rather, it means simply that
the school did not sell a certain quan
tity of tickets. Indeed, some of those
tickets did go unsold because the
school could not find buyers hav
ing attended the Orange Bowl in per
son, I know that there were large sec
tions of empty seats at that game.
However, the quantity of "unsold"
tickets also includes the tickets that a
school kept for its own use. Under
current BCS bowl contracts, schools
do not get any free tickets; they must
pay for every single one that is not
sold to a buyer, including the ones
they choose not to sell. In Oregon's
case, I am fairly confident that the
1,761 unsold tickets were kept by the
school for its own uses, such as the
marching band, prominent adminis
trators and alumni and family mem
bers of the players (to name a few).
Unfortunately for Oregon, it had to
pay for the privilege of using these
seats, and it ultimately cost it a chance
to make a profit on playing in the na
tional title game.
As far as calculating profit and loss
figures, we gathered data on the 12
teams we published financial data for
in three ways: through our own open
records requests, financial documents
obtained from student newspapers at
other universities and published news
reports from professional media out
lets that included profit or loss figures.
In each case, the published profit
figure was calculated by taking the
school's reported revenue (listed on
the top of the first page of their
NCAA expense report) and subtract
ing from that figure its expenses (list
ed on the bottom of the first page of
that report). To get the final number,
we added back in any tickets ab
sorbed by a school's conference, so
that the final figure reflected only the
tickets that individual schools had to
directly pay for themselves.
I hope that this explanation clears
up any lingering doubts surrounding
