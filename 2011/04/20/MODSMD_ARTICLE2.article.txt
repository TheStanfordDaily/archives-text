Gary Hirshberg, CEO of Stonyfield Farm, spoke
Tuesday at a "Brown Bag Lunch" held by the Entre
preneurship Club, the Food and Agriculture Manage
ment (FARM) Club and the Sustainable Business
Club. Hirshberg expanded on his company's business
strategy and vision in sustainability.
"Business was always about something or some
body losing," Hirshberg said.
Hirshberg said his ambition to create an enterprise
that didn't destroy the earth drove Stonyfield Farm's
growth from a small organic farming school to its cur
rent $360 million in annual sales.
Stonyfield tracks and reduces its carbon footprint,
employs organic farming and uses alternative adver
tising to create a yogurt company with what Hirshberg
calls, "win-win-win capitalism."
"Organics really is the solution to much of what ails
our nation and our planet's food supply," Hirshberg
said. "We're not going to solve the climate crisis by
slowing down net carbon output; we have to start trap
ping carbon molecules in soils."
Stonyfield developed the "Mission Action Pro
gram" to manage their footprint beyond just carbon
emissions to include facility energy, waste to incinera
tor and plastic and water usage. Since 2006, the Mis
sion Action Program has saved Stonyfield $18.2 mil
lion, according to Hirshberg.
Through humble beginnings, including an "adopt a
cow" marketing campaign and word of mouth adver-

Stonyfield Farm CEO Gary Hirshberg sparks student
interest in sustainability at a "Brown Bag Lunch" event on
Tuesday. Stonyfield Farm is based in New Hampshire
and is an organic yogurt maker.
rising, Stonyfield found its way onto
the shelves of stores such as Whole
Foods that have more of a "toler
ance for novelty," Hirshberg said.
Stonyfield now ranks third in
the United States' yogurt market
shares, just beyond Dannon and
Yoplait.
Forgoing most traditional ad
vertising, Hirshberg explained that
Stonyfield began using packaging
to convey its story and values. Mil
lions of the company's lids display
environmental messages and caus
es they have aligned with to pro
mote education and advocacy. So
cial media and blogger outreach
have also become effective adver
tising for the company.
Hirshberg spoke specifically
about two aspects of the food indus
try he believes are in need of closer
scrutiny: genetically modified foods
and government subsidies.
He said developing countries
with high population pressure and
limited resources cannot invest in
genetically modified foods to ex
pand their nation's food base be
cause the promise of genetically
modified foods in increasing yields
has not yet been proven.
Hirshberg also added that subsi
dies have to end in the United
States because they make organic
food unaffordable.
At an individual company level,
Hirshberg advocated closing this

price margin by increasing produc
tion. Increased consumer demand
allows Stonyfield to increase vol
ume, which increases efficiency and
lowers the price.
Hirshberg acknowledged that
some people believe organic food is
a niche with little prospect of in
creasing consumer demand. But
market data seems counter this.
"The organic market has grown
at 20 percent annually, even
through the recession," he said.
"The ultimate way we should
buy is local and organic," Hirshberg
said.
However, he cautioned that
people should not cite reduced car
bon footprint as a reason to choose
local foods over organic consump
tion. Transportation of finished
goods accounts for six to seven per
cent of total carbon footprint,
whereas the method by which
they're grown accounts for 40 to 50
percent.
"1 know 1 could bring organic
dried milk from New Zealand to
New Hampshire for a lesser carbon
footprint than bringing milk from
New York," Hirshberg said. "Food
miles is not the issue; the issue is
what kind of toxicity do you want to
eliminate in the biosphere."
Kellee Patterson, a first year
MBA student at the Graduate
School of Business, thought the talk
appealed to "people who are inter
ested in sustainability as a strategy
while still wanting to remain rele
vant in the marketplace."
