# Anscombe Society debuts on Farm
## Group's first event, "Marriage Without Adjectives," sparks controversy 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The newly established Stanford
Anscombe Society (SAS) hosted its first
event, titled "Marriage Without Adjectives,"
on Tuesday night. Former Fioover Fellow
Jennifer Roback Morse, the founder of the
Ruth Institute, delivered the kickoff talk.
According to the official SAS descrip
tion, the group "is a non-politically and non
religiously affiliated student group that fos
ters campus thought regarding the roles of
the family, marriage, sexual ethics, chastity
and sexuality in the lives of Stanford stu
dents."
Morse, an affiliate of the Love and Fideli
ty Network (which includes SAS), said the
network encompasses student organiza
tions of "young adults who have made it
their mission to say something new about
human sexuality."
The student network also promotes ab
stinence before marriage across 35 college
campuses.
Morse's 40-minute speech prompted an
active question and answer session. She em
phasized the importance of bringing the di
alogue to youth at college campuses.
Morse defined marriage as "an organic,

naturally occurring social institution" with
the sole purposes of "sexual activity, spousal
love and child rearing."
"Marriage is the linchpin of society ...
and young people need accurate informa
tion about the big picture," she said.
This definition of marriage proved con
tentious to some audience members when
discussed in the context of same sex mar
riages.
"The children of same-sex unions will ei
ther be deprived of one of their parents, or
have three parents in their lives playing
parental roles," Morse said. "When courts
say there is a right to same-sex marriage,
what they have to do is redefine the purpose
of marriage."
Morse described the Love and Fidelity
Network as a response to relatively new
trends in sexuality on college campuses. Her
speech also tackled other problems she be
lieves have been created by the "sexual rev
olution" of the past 40 years.
"One of the first and most destructive
steps was the 'no fault' divorce," she said, re
ferring to the passing of the 1970 divorce
laws.
"It made people unhappy and perpetu
ated injustices against women, men and chil
dren alike," she added.

Morse saw similarities between this shift
in marriage regulations and the current is
sues surrounding same sex marriage.
"The shift to 'no fault' divorce was not a
minor change, but a huge social shift...
same sex marriage changes the structure of
marriage more profoundly than 'no fault'
divorce," she said.
This social shift, she argued, was the dis
solution of the family unit, leading to an ex
pansion of the powers of the state. Morse
believed that involving the courts "in the
minutia of family life is hardly the behavior
of a free society" and that "no fault" divorce
has blurred the boundaries between public
and private lives.
Morse's talk objected to the "intrusion"
of the state into the private sphere, the shift
ing focus of family law and the high cost to
the taxpayer of "social pathologies" that re
sults from family breakdown.
Questions addressed teaching responsi
ble parenting in school, same-sex adoption,
nontraditional sexual practices within het
erosexual marriages and the contradiction
between discouraging pre-marital sex and
banning same-sex marriages.
When asked about the "inevitability" of
same-sex marriage legalization,
Morse drew a parallel with the Roe v.
Wade decision on abortion. She did
not "accept that same sex marriage is
inevitable," and offered two support
ing claims.
The first claim was that same sex
marriage's advances had been made
in the courts not on the ballot. The
second claim had to do with the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision "that
abortion on demand was going to be
the law of the land," she said.
"At the time, the advocates for
abortion said the younger genera
tion was going to support abortion

rights ... That has turned out to be
largely untrue," Morse said. "It's
taken a period of time for the full
brutality of the abortion regime to
become obvious to people. I think
something is similar of same sex mar
riage."
The conversation, which drifted
into highly sensitive and controver
sial topics, remained calm through
out the session.
"I'm very pleased to see a civil
discussion that still gets to the heart
of the issues," music professor
George Barth said. "I was very inter
ested to hear what she had to say, es
pecially with such divergent groups
represented in the audience."
SAS Co-founder Bernard Van-
Berkum T4 saw the dialogue itself as
a reason for the group's foundation.
"In a lot of the campus conversa
tion there's this atmosphere that isn't
really a debate," he said. "There are
nonreligious reasons to say that
same-sex marriage isn't something
that makes sense and Stanford stu
dents need to hear this."
Vanßerkum, who wrote an edito
rial in the Stanford Review titled
"Defending Traditional Marriage,"
recognized that SAS will face signifi
cant opposition.
"If you look at the ROTC debate,
it was largely two very vocal minori
ties and most students didn't really
care," he said. "For this, at first, it'll
probably be us, SSQL [Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation] and a
bunch of students who don't have
time to care."
Opponents of the group object to
both its views and its presence on
campus.
"It's upsetting that they were
given SAL [Student Activities and
Leadership] status," said Dan

Thompson'l3.
"Optimally, everybody should be
allowed to be a student group, but
SAL curates and since they do, it's
very upsetting that a homophobic,
anti-women, misogynistic group is
given status when others are not," he
said.
Thompson also worried that the
group's polarization of the dialogue
will detract from other issues.
"These guys are going to be la
beled the anti-gay marriage group
when, in reality, they're an extremist
group and it's going to distract from
real homophobia on campus," he
said.
Nathaniel Williams 'l3 character
ized the event as a "hate fest."
"I'm virtually speechless,"
Williams said. "Never have I seen or
participated in or heard of hosting an
academic speaker who came across
as so broadly ignorant, offensive."
"The preview in the Stanford Re
view sort of posed it as a discussion
about same sex marriage, but in actu
ally it turned out to be more of a anti
abortion, anti-same sex adoption,
anti-women, anti-good government,
hate fest," he said.
Other attendees at the event cited
various reasons for attending.
"I'm interested in marriage and
how it's approached in the public
sphere ... if there's a right approach,
how government is involved, those
type of philosophical questions," said
Jason Stuckey, a doctoral candidate
in earth sciences.
According to Vanßerkum, SAS
will hold weekly meetings, which will
be open to the public, to further the
discussion.

When asked about the "inevitability" of
same-sex marriage legalization,
Morse drew a parallel with the Roe v.
Wade decision on abortion. She did
not "accept that same sex marriage is
inevitable," and offered two support
ing claims.
The first claim was that same sex
marriage's advances had been made
in the courts not on the ballot. The
second claim had to do with the
Supreme Court's 1973 decision "that
abortion on demand was going to be
the law of the land," she said.
"At the time, the advocates for
abortion said the younger genera
tion was going to support abortion

rights ... That has turned out to be
largely untrue," Morse said. "It's
taken a period of time for the full
brutality of the abortion regime to
become obvious to people. I think
something is similar of same sex mar
riage."
The conversation, which drifted
into highly sensitive and controver
sial topics, remained calm through
out the session.
"I'm very pleased to see a civil
discussion that still gets to the heart
of the issues," music professor
George Barth said. "I was very inter
ested to hear what she had to say, es
pecially with such divergent groups
represented in the audience."
SAS Co-founder Bernard Van-
Berkum T4 saw the dialogue itself as
a reason for the group's foundation.
"In a lot of the campus conversa
tion there's this atmosphere that isn't
really a debate," he said. "There are
nonreligious reasons to say that
same-sex marriage isn't something
that makes sense and Stanford stu
dents need to hear this."
Vanßerkum, who wrote an edito
rial in the Stanford Review titled
"Defending Traditional Marriage,"
recognized that SAS will face signifi
cant opposition.
"If you look at the ROTC debate,
it was largely two very vocal minori
ties and most students didn't really
care," he said. "For this, at first, it'll
probably be us, SSQL [Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation] and a
bunch of students who don't have
time to care."
Opponents of the group object to
both its views and its presence on
campus.
"It's upsetting that they were
given SAL [Student Activities and
Leadership] status," said Dan

Thompson'l3.
"Optimally, everybody should be
allowed to be a student group, but
SAL curates and since they do, it's
very upsetting that a homophobic,
anti-women, misogynistic group is
given status when others are not," he
said.
Thompson also worried that the
group's polarization of the dialogue
will detract from other issues.
"These guys are going to be la
beled the anti-gay marriage group
when, in reality, they're an extremist
group and it's going to distract from
real homophobia on campus," he
said.
Nathaniel Williams 'l3 character
ized the event as a "hate fest."
"I'm virtually speechless,"
Williams said. "Never have I seen or
participated in or heard of hosting an
academic speaker who came across
as so broadly ignorant, offensive."
"The preview in the Stanford Re
view sort of posed it as a discussion
about same sex marriage, but in actu
ally it turned out to be more of a anti
abortion, anti-same sex adoption,
anti-women, anti-good government,
hate fest," he said.
Other attendees at the event cited
various reasons for attending.
"I'm interested in marriage and
how it's approached in the public
sphere ... if there's a right approach,
how government is involved, those
type of philosophical questions," said
Jason Stuckey, a doctoral candidate
in earth sciences.
According to Vanßerkum, SAS
will hold weekly meetings, which will
be open to the public, to further the
discussion.

The newly established Stanford
Anscombe Society (SAS) hosted its first
event, titled "Marriage Without Adjectives,"
on Tuesday night. Former Fioover Fellow
Jennifer Roback Morse, the founder of the
Ruth Institute, delivered the kickoff talk.
According to the official SAS descrip
tion, the group "is a non-politically and non
religiously affiliated student group that fos
ters campus thought regarding the roles of
the family, marriage, sexual ethics, chastity
and sexuality in the lives of Stanford stu
dents."
Morse, an affiliate of the Love and Fideli
ty Network (which includes SAS), said the
network encompasses student organiza
tions of "young adults who have made it
their mission to say something new about
human sexuality."
The student network also promotes ab
stinence before marriage across 35 college
campuses.
Morse's 40-minute speech prompted an
active question and answer session. She em
phasized the importance of bringing the di
alogue to youth at college campuses.
Morse defined marriage as "an organic,

naturally occurring social institution" with
the sole purposes of "sexual activity, spousal
love and child rearing."
"Marriage is the linchpin of society ...
and young people need accurate informa
tion about the big picture," she said.
This definition of marriage proved con
tentious to some audience members when
discussed in the context of same sex mar
riages.
"The children of same-sex unions will ei
ther be deprived of one of their parents, or
have three parents in their lives playing
parental roles," Morse said. "When courts
say there is a right to same-sex marriage,
what they have to do is redefine the purpose
of marriage."
Morse described the Love and Fidelity
Network as a response to relatively new
trends in sexuality on college campuses. Her
speech also tackled other problems she be
lieves have been created by the "sexual rev
olution" of the past 40 years.
"One of the first and most destructive
steps was the 'no fault' divorce," she said, re
ferring to the passing of the 1970 divorce
laws.
"It made people unhappy and perpetu
ated injustices against women, men and chil
dren alike," she added.

Morse saw similarities between this shift
in marriage regulations and the current is
sues surrounding same sex marriage.
"The shift to 'no fault' divorce was not a
minor change, but a huge social shift...
same sex marriage changes the structure of
marriage more profoundly than 'no fault'
divorce," she said.
This social shift, she argued, was the dis
solution of the family unit, leading to an ex
pansion of the powers of the state. Morse
believed that involving the courts "in the
minutia of family life is hardly the behavior
of a free society" and that "no fault" divorce
has blurred the boundaries between public
and private lives.
Morse's talk objected to the "intrusion"
of the state into the private sphere, the shift
ing focus of family law and the high cost to
the taxpayer of "social pathologies" that re
sults from family breakdown.
Questions addressed teaching responsi
ble parenting in school, same-sex adoption,
nontraditional sexual practices within het
erosexual marriages and the contradiction
between discouraging pre-marital sex and
banning same-sex marriages.
