# Anscombe Society debuts on Farm
## Group's first event, "Marriage Without Adjectives," sparks controversy 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The newly established Stanford
Anscombe Society (SAS) hosted its first
event, titled "Marriage Without Adjectives,"
on Tuesday night. Former Fioover Fellow
Jennifer Roback Morse, the founder of the
Ruth Institute, delivered the kickoff talk.
According to the official SAS descrip
tion, the group "is a non-politically and non
religiously affiliated student group that fos
ters campus thought regarding the roles of
the family, marriage, sexual ethics, chastity
and sexuality in the lives of Stanford stu
dents."
Morse, an affiliate of the Love and Fideli
ty Network (which includes SAS), said the
network encompasses student organiza
tions of "young adults who have made it
their mission to say something new about
human sexuality."
The student network also promotes ab
stinence before marriage across 35 college
campuses.
Morse's 40-minute speech prompted an
active question and answer session. She em
phasized the importance of bringing the di
alogue to youth at college campuses.
Morse defined marriage as "an organic,

naturally occurring social institution" with
the sole purposes of "sexual activity, spousal
love and child rearing."
"Marriage is the linchpin of society ...
and young people need accurate informa
tion about the big picture," she said.
This definition of marriage proved con
tentious to some audience members when
discussed in the context of same sex mar
riages.
"The children of same-sex unions will ei
ther be deprived of one of their parents, or
have three parents in their lives playing
parental roles," Morse said. "When courts
say there is a right to same-sex marriage,
what they have to do is redefine the purpose
of marriage."
Morse described the Love and Fidelity
Network as a response to relatively new
trends in sexuality on college campuses. Her
speech also tackled other problems she be
lieves have been created by the "sexual rev
olution" of the past 40 years.
"One of the first and most destructive
steps was the 'no fault' divorce," she said, re
ferring to the passing of the 1970 divorce
laws.
"It made people unhappy and perpetu
ated injustices against women, men and chil
dren alike," she added.

Morse saw similarities between this shift
in marriage regulations and the current is
sues surrounding same sex marriage.
"The shift to 'no fault' divorce was not a
minor change, but a huge social shift...
same sex marriage changes the structure of
marriage more profoundly than 'no fault'
divorce," she said.
This social shift, she argued, was the dis
solution of the family unit, leading to an ex
pansion of the powers of the state. Morse
believed that involving the courts "in the
minutia of family life is hardly the behavior
of a free society" and that "no fault" divorce
has blurred the boundaries between public
and private lives.
Morse's talk objected to the "intrusion"
of the state into the private sphere, the shift
ing focus of family law and the high cost to
the taxpayer of "social pathologies" that re
sults from family breakdown.
Questions addressed teaching responsi
ble parenting in school, same-sex adoption,
nontraditional sexual practices within het
erosexual marriages and the contradiction
between discouraging pre-marital sex and
banning same-sex marriages.
When asked about the "inevitability" of
