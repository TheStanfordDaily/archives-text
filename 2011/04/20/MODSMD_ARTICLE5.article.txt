## Senate approves campaign spending cap 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A bill passed by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate on Tuesday night will restrict the amount of
money that can be used to campaign in class pres
ident elections, setting the cap at $4OO per slate. The
legislation is a scaled-down version of a bill pre
sented last week, which previously included a $lOO
spending limit in Senate races.
Prior to voting unanimously in favor for the bill,
many senators expressed concerns about treating
Senate races in the same way as class president
races. Senator-elect Daniel DeLong 'l3 said he

worried that the bill was centered too heavily
around self-reporting.
"You are relying on the trust of politicians and
I think that's redly problematic," DeLong said.
In response, ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll, who co-authored the bill, said she would
n't call the candidates politicians.
"I'd call them students," Cardona said. "And
that's the Stanford nature even if you look at our
Honor Code."
But Cardona noted that she was open to other
ideas about reforming Senate elections.
"I personally have never run for Senate," she
said. "I have run for class president. I have run for

the Executive. So on this issue, I really defer to you
guys."
Senator Will Seaton 'l3 suggested splitting the
bill into two parts: one for the cap on class presi
dent races and another for the cap on Senate races.
Instead, Cardona motioned for a straw poll,
which ended up showing that a majority of the
Senators preferred creating a public financing op
tion for Senate candidates instead of a spending
cap. She decided to strike the language of the bill
that referred to Senate races. The Senate passed
the bill after this revision.
