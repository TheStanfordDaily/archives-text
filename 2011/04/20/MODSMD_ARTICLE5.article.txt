## Senate approves campaign spending cap 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A bill passed by the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate on Tuesday night will restrict the amount of
money that can be used to campaign in class pres
ident elections, setting the cap at $4OO per slate. The
legislation is a scaled-down version of a bill pre
sented last week, which previously included a $lOO
spending limit in Senate races.
Prior to voting unanimously in favor for the bill,
many senators expressed concerns about treating
Senate races in the same way as class president
races. Senator-elect Daniel DeLong 'l3 said he

worried that the bill was centered too heavily
around self-reporting.
"You are relying on the trust of politicians and
I think that's redly problematic," DeLong said.
In response, ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll, who co-authored the bill, said she would
n't call the candidates politicians.
"I'd call them students," Cardona said. "And
that's the Stanford nature even if you look at our
Honor Code."
But Cardona noted that she was open to other
ideas about reforming Senate elections.
"I personally have never run for Senate," she
said. "I have run for class president. I have run for

the Executive. So on this issue, I really defer to you
guys."
Senator Will Seaton 'l3 suggested splitting the
bill into two parts: one for the cap on class presi
dent races and another for the cap on Senate races.
Instead, Cardona motioned for a straw poll,
which ended up showing that a majority of the
Senators preferred creating a public financing op
tion for Senate candidates instead of a spending
cap. She decided to strike the language of the bill
that referred to Senate races. The Senate passed
the bill after this revision.
It also voted in favor of funding
two student organizations, the Stan
ford Martial Arts Program and the
ASSU Student Services Division, that
were not placed on the spring ballot
for special fees despite following the
proper procedure.
"It really was a human error," Car
dona said. "If we did a special election,
it would be unfair to isolate those
groups in that way."
Subsequently, the Senate con
firmed two executive appointments:
David Sunde 'l3 to the Executive
Chair of Social Life and Senator
Deepa Kannappan 'l3 to a position

on the Constitutional Council.
If approved by the GSC, Kannap
pan will hand in her resignation to the
Senate and replace Brianna Pang 'l3,
who resigned after being elected to
the 13th Undergraduate Senate, as
elected officials cannot serve concur
rently in both positions.
"Deepa is extremely level-head
ed," Cardona said. "I think she's
thoughtful. I think she looks at both
sides of things and is also obviously
brilliant. Needless to say, I think she
will do a great job continuing her serv
ice there."
She added that it was important to
find a replacement quickly because
the Council must rule on whether or
not it will hear pending cases.
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
stepped down from his current Sen
ate position as well. He will enter of

fice as ASSU vice president on Satur
day.
"The advice that we got when we
were coming in was that it was going
to be a battleground and you are
going to have to fight," Macgregor-
Dennis said. "Then it turns out that
99.5 percent of the decisions we made
were in consensus. There were really
few [cases] where there's been a lot of
controversy."
"In my opinion, we have been a
productive Senate," he added. "I think
we've been a successful one. I am ex
cited that we are bringing Stanford
student government up to the point
where everything else at Stanford is
where we are one of the top in the
nation."
