## New studies show risks of pricey drug School of Medicine reports on off-label prescribing 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
Two studies from the School of
Medicine, published Monday in An
nals of Internal Medicine, revealed
that an expensive blood-clotting
drug intended only for hemophilia
patients has been mainly prescribed
for patients without this disorder.
This practice, however, may pose
certain health risks.
The first study looked at uses of
the drug, known as recombinant fac
tor 7 a (RF7a), at American hospi
tals. RF7a, approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in 1999, was developed for a
small group of hemophilia patients
whose bodies reject other treat
ments to curtail bleeding.
Veronica Yank, an instructor in
medicine and the first author of one
of the studies, said researchers were
surprised to find that the drug was
prescribed off-label. More than
17,000 patients without hemophilia
received the drug in 2008 to prevent
or stop heavy bleeding.
Off-label prescribing is a com
mon practice where doctors use a
drug to treat conditions other than
those approved by the FDA. The
practice is not illegal, but Yank said
many patients and doctors fail to un
derstand that drugs do not have the
same level of scrutiny for off-label
uses as they have for on-label uses.
The study estimates that the drug
was only used to treat hemophilia
patients in 4 percent of cases in U.S.
hospitals from 2000 to 2008. A stag
gering 96 percent of RF7a usage in
volved cases of heart surgery, trau
ma, intracranial hemorrhages
(bleeding in or near the brain) and a
host of other problems.
Previously published studies
raised concerns that RF7a increased
the risk of blood clots, spurring the
U.S. Agency for Healthcare Quality
and Research (AHRQ) to ask re
searchers to examine the drug in
2008. The agency funded both Stan
ford studies.
The second study examined the
risks and benefits of prescribing
RF7a for five particular patient sce
narios or conditions: heart surgery,
