## TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH Dunbar's introsem plunges into past polar expeditions 
### KELSEY GEISER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On a brisk March day in the
Sierra Nevada, a handful of
Stanford students were
scrambling to find shelter.
They had no tents and no
professional wilderness training aside
from what they'd read in books only
piles of snow, pine trees and plummeting
temperatures.
Most people would be terrified to be
caught in this situation, but not those in
Rob Dunbar's class, "The Worst Journey
in the World." This was the kind of sce
nario they'd studied all quarter.
Dunbar, a W.M. Keck Professor in the
School of Earth Sciences and Senior Fel
low at the Woods Institute for the Envi
ronment, combined his work as a scientist
and oceanographer, work in Antarctica
and fascination with the writings of polar
explorers into an introductory seminar
that examined past exploration journeys
to both poles and the lives of the brave
explorers who endured them.
"The idea for this class came from real
izing that the stories of the polar explorers
provide great insights into polar environ
mental science as well as human respons
es under conditions of great stress," Dun
bar wrote in an email to The Daily.
Dunbar wanted his class to get a first
hand taste of the hardships the explorers
of the past had faced and took his stu
dents on a weekend-long camping trip to
the Sierra Nevada.
The seminar, which has run every sec
ond year since 1999, examined past polar
explorations through journal entries of
famous polar explorers. These pieces de
picted both the successes and occasional
ly graphic hardships of early exploration.
From killing their own sled dogs for food
to sucking on their leather bootstraps for
nourishment, the students learned how
these intrepid explorers risked every
thing for the sake of discovery.
"Sometimes when I would read
through the journals it seemed like it
couldn't possibly happen in reality, some
things seemed so far fetched," said Sara
Ramsey 'l4. "The explorers went through
so much."
The featured trip had originally been
planned for an earlier date, but due to
heavy snowstorms was postponed until
the weekend before dead week. The dogs
they planned to go sledding with could
not mush through the approximately 10
feet of fresh powder that accumulated
from the storms.
On the trip, students went dog sled
ding, cross-country skiing and they made
and slept in their own snow shelter.
"In the evening when we built [the
snow shelter], you could sit up in it... it
was probably the height of three and a
half, four feet and then the snow sunk
overnight... so we woke up and the ceil

ing at the entrance was about a foot and a
half about the ground so it was kind of
claustrophobic," said Halsey Hoster 'l4.
Yet despite the sinking, Hoster said the
makeshift accommodations were "sur
prisingly comfortable."
While the Stanford trip was only a
glimpse into the challenges that the polar
explorers of the past endured in reality,

the overnight journey put the course ma
terial into perspective.
"It's not that cold in the Sierras, espe
cially in early March and the geography
and light patterns and temperatures...
stuff like that, obviously we couldn't ex
perience but in terms of making sure
you're staying warm, staying dry, trying to
travel through snow I thought that was

definitely a good experience," Hoster
said.
Ramsey agreed.
"[The class] gave me a good sense of
what it would be like before all of the
technology," he said. "I think it would be
a completely different experience now."
While the camping trip was a big com
ponent of the course, the everyday class
was centered more on understanding the
travails of the explorers through written
accounts and discussion.
According to students, Dunbar in
stilled a genuine interest in the subject
matter through his efforts to "know stu
dents on a personal level." Whether it was
inviting them over to his home for a
home-cooked meal, telling personal sto
ries or showing a genuine desire to dis
cover the students' thoughts on the read
ing, Dunbar made a classroom effort to
inspire a passion not only for the environ
ment but also for the plight of explorers.
"I'd say I most want students to try to
put themselves into the world of the polar
explorer, to try to understand why people
did what they did, what drove them to un
dergo such hardships," Dunbar said.
According to Ramsey, he succeeded.
"He is pretty much the most epic pro
fessor I've had so far," she said.

cially in early March and the geography
and light patterns and temperatures...
stuff like that, obviously we couldn't ex
perience but in terms of making sure
you're staying warm, staying dry, trying to
travel through snow I thought that was

definitely a good experience," Hoster
said.
Ramsey agreed.
"[The class] gave me a good sense of
what it would be like before all of the
technology," he said. "I think it would be
a completely different experience now."
While the camping trip was a big com
ponent of the course, the everyday class
was centered more on understanding the
travails of the explorers through written
accounts and discussion.
According to students, Dunbar in
stilled a genuine interest in the subject
matter through his efforts to "know stu
dents on a personal level." Whether it was
inviting them over to his home for a
home-cooked meal, telling personal sto
ries or showing a genuine desire to dis
cover the students' thoughts on the read
ing, Dunbar made a classroom effort to
inspire a passion not only for the environ
ment but also for the plight of explorers.
"I'd say I most want students to try to
put themselves into the world of the polar
explorer, to try to understand why people
did what they did, what drove them to un
dergo such hardships," Dunbar said.
According to Ramsey, he succeeded.
"He is pretty much the most epic pro
fessor I've had so far," she said.

To get a firsthand taste of the life of an explorer, Prof. Dunbar's class went dog-sledding and built snow shelters on its trip.
