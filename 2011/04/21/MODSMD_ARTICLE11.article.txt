## THE
						STANFORD BRAND

Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach
Galifianakis, a face tattoo, a
monkey in a Rolling Stones vest
and a Stanford sweatshirt star in
the new Hangover 2 trailer. The
Stanford sweatshirt might seem like an ex
citing shout out to the University. Howev
er, it's just one example in a long history of
Stanford references in popular mass
media.
In 2002, Stanford played a key role in
the movie "Orange County," a comedy
about college admissions and the struggle
of trying to escape dysfunctional families.
For Shamika Goddard 'O7, who recalled
that the movie came out the same year she
applied to Stanford, the reference was
memorable.
"Before I went to Admit Weekend, I
saw that film and hoped to find some land
mark on campus from the film," she said.
"I thought it was not a coincidence that
my dream school was in a feature film my

senior year."
From High School Musical 3, to Charlie
St. Cloud to Hannah Montana, movies and
television shows marketed to teens and
tweens increasingly use Stanford as the go
to school for students with big dreams.
But Stanford isn't only represented as a
dream. The Stanford tank top that Sigour
ney Weaver sported in Avatar equates the
University with greatness and goodness.
Similarly, Grey's Anatomy had character
Cristina Yang graduate at the top of her
Stanford School of Medicine class, imply
ing a relationship between the University's
academic reputation and Yang's technical
skill and intense drive.
Stanford does have a legacy of brilliant
scientists and doctors, and there are many
young musicians, scholars and athletes who
dream of coming to the Farm. But what ac
tually happens at Stanford the place? This
is what portrayals of Stanford typically fail
to depict.
"People are shocked that there's a com
munity here," said Meyli Chapin 'l4. "I
think a lot of it is how Stanford allows itself

to be perceived. It's not until Admit Week
end that you see the school as more than a
conceptual goal or a means to an end. The
media doesn't show us, as students, doing
what we do."
Media representations of Stanford are
almost always associated with the Univer
sity's international academic ranking, ac
cording to Simon Firth, a faculty spouse
and writer for the London Evening Stan
dard.
"The times that Stanford is called upon,
it has meaning," Firth said. "It's fairly un
controversial that Stanford seems to mean
quality."
The University can serve as an easy refer
ence to scriptwriters looking to symbolize
an elite education.
"Stanford is popular," said Lisa Lapin,
Assistant Vice President for University
Communications. "It conveys a lot and
people don't have to use a lot of space in a
script."
Outside organizations must obtain per
mission to use any visual representation of
the University, such as campus images or

Stanford paraphernalia. However, media
organizations can allow characters on
their shows or films to claim acceptance or
rejection by the University without any of
ficial authorization. According to Lapin,
Stanford never seeks out or pays for ap
pearances on TV or in movies.
"We don't even supply a T-shirt... We
send them to the bookstore," she said.
Although these references are preva
lent, they don't significantly impact poten
tial applicants' interest in the University,
according to Densil Porteous, Assistant
Dean of Admission for Marketing and
Communication Outreach.
"I do believe Stanford's presence in pop
cultural media generates interest in under
standing more about the University," Porte
ous said. "But I do not see Stanford's pop
cultural image shaping the audience who
applies to the University."
To Porteous, the references reflect the
University's influence.
"I truly enjoy the obscure references or
imagery found in pop culture about the
University," he said. "It is in the moments
of obscurity that one realizes just how
large of an impact the University has had."
Although alumni and students are
stamped with the Stanford brand, it is the
people at Stanford, according to Lapin,
who determine what the University's
image means.
"Every time Stanford is mentioned, it
reinforces the brand," Lapin said. "But it's
not just on television. It's when our foot
ball players are interviewed before and
after the Orange Bowl and how articulate
they are, when our students go off and
found companies. It's when the President
of Russia and the Chancellor of Germany
want to come visit Stanford."
"Stanford means something ... it's not
just about popular culture," she added.
"It's about what Stanford means globally."
