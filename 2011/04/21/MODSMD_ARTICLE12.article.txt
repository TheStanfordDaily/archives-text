## SEEING GREEN Erosive Action 
### Holly Moeller 
On any given Saturday, if you
run into Mike and Philip,
you're likely to find them cov
ered in dirt. My friends recently dug
into a new pursuit: gardening. At
present, this means incubating deli
cate seedlings on windowsills while
they haul bags of topsoil from garden
store to garden plot, adding nutrients
and substrate for their future vegeta
bles.

In time for this spring (rather,
summer, in my New England lexi
con) flurry of activity, the Environ
mental Working Group released a
report last week on soil erosion in the
lowa cornbelt.The news isn't good.
With the folly that is corn-based
ethanol and rising food prices world
wide, American corn (and soybean)
growers have seen crop values spike.
As a result, it's become economical
to plant more marginal cropland,
which tends to lie on steeper slopes
with higher erosion potential. So the
amount of topsoil we lose each year
(already at 2 billion tons nationally)
is increasing.
This has both short and long term
consequences: Immediately down
stream, waterways are clouded by
soil and polluted by fertilizer and
pesticides. Back at the farm, erosion
rates set the agricultural lifespan of
the land.
There's only so much that nutri
ent-booster shots can do, and once
the soil has blown or washed away,
the land is lost to farming. Indeed, ac
cording to Jared Diamond, soil ero
sion and consequent loss of soil fertil
ity may have contributed to the col
lapse of ancient civilizations, like the
Mayan Empire.
So it's critical that rates of soil ero
sion don't outstrip the natural rates
of soil production (by weathering of
rock and deposition from uphill and
upstream sources). Measuring soil
formation is no mean feat, but in a
2007 Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences paper, David
Montgomery calculated rates rang
ing from 0.01 to o.lmm of soil per
year, depending on how much geo
logical action the local landscape was
getting.
By comparison, erosion on lowan
farmland results in a loss of Imm of
soil per year. The USDA's threshold
values (the rates at which regulatory
alarm bells are supposed to sound)
are set at 0.4 to Imm per year.
In other words, we're eroding our
topsoil at 10 to 100 times the rate it
can be replenished, and our (suppos
edly scientific) farm authorities say
that's OK.
Still, we're holding onto our soil
more successfully than other coun
tries. In parts of Asia and South
America, erosion rates are double or

triple ours. But erosion rates are half
of ours in Europe, where the right set
of (enforced) incentives has farmers
planting cover crops (to hold soil in
place after harvesting), edging fields
with buffer zones (grassy strips that
entrain soil before it washes into
drainages) and practicing no-till
farming.
"Zero-tillage" is an increasingly
popular technique in which the soil
isn't plowed into ridges and furrows
before planting. It requires less ener
gy and fewer tractor hours and has
the potential to eliminate erosion
completely (and reduce surface
runoff by 99 percent). But untilled
fields give weeds a head start, so no
till is often coupled with heavy pesti
cide usage.
While we could implement an
array of soil conservation practices
(some more effective than others, of
course), our social and economic mo
tivations are failing us. In lowa, most
farmland is rented; a third of the
landowners live outside the state.
Many farms are huge amalgamations
of land disconnected from the indi
vidual with a deeply personal stake in
the soil's health.
Since 1985, we've used economics
to mimic that commitment: farmers

are supposed to follow local soil con
servation guidelines in order to re
ceive subsidy payments. At first, this
strategy successfully reduced ero
sion by 45 percent. But in the last
decade, compliance has dropped
under dwindling enforcement, and
now the most critical conservation
programs the Environmental
Quality Incentives Program and the
Conservation Stewardship Program
face $llO million cuts under the
just-passed rescue budget. (Of
course, our subsidy system has al
ways emphasized production over
sustainability: in the last 15 years,
only 12 percent of subsidy payments
came from conservation funds.)
Today, though, it's more impor
tant than ever to address agricultur
al sustainability. Increasingly violent
weather patterns and attendant
erosion pulses are predicted to
accompany climate change. Our
farm system is crippled by outdated
subsidies and overreliance on inten
sive, fossil fuel-based inputs. Yet
globally, we must still find away to
feed 3 billion new mouths by 2050.
It seems increasingly clear that
the only way to address all these is
sues is by shrinking our agricultural
operations back down toward
human scale. Industrial agriculture
feeds the world, but it also decouples
us from our resource base. We may
call the Plains states flat and monot
onous, but a farmer intimately famil
iar with his land knows that there are
drainages here and fertile flatlands
there, that he should plant crops on
this side and buffer strips on that
one. A farmer intimately familiar
with her land knows that the right
thing for her pocket in today's econ
omy may not be the right thing for
the land she plans to leave her chil
dren.
It's our job, then, to help bring
these values back into synchrony. It
begins with a bag of topsoil, a shovel
and Mike and Philip's garden.

of ours in Europe, where the right set
of (enforced) incentives has farmers
planting cover crops (to hold soil in
place after harvesting), edging fields
with buffer zones (grassy strips that
entrain soil before it washes into
drainages) and practicing no-till
farming.
"Zero-tillage" is an increasingly
popular technique in which the soil
isn't plowed into ridges and furrows
before planting. It requires less ener

the potential to eliminate erosion
completely (and reduce surface
runoff by 99 percent). But untilled
fields give weeds a head start, so no
till is often coupled with heavy pesti
cide usage.

array of soil conservation practices
(some more effective than others, of

strategy successfully reduced ero
sion by 45 percent. But in the last
decade, compliance has dropped
under dwindling enforcement, and
now the most critical conservation
programs the Environmental
Quality Incentives Program and the
Conservation Stewardship Program
face $llO million cuts under the
just-passed rescue budget. (Of
course, our subsidy system has al
ways emphasized production over
sustainability: in the last 15 years,
only 12 percent of subsidy payments
came from conservation funds.)
Today, though, it's more impor

weather patterns and attendant
erosion pulses are predicted to

globally, we must still find away to
feed 3 billion new mouths by 2050.

operations back down toward

feeds the world, but it also decouples
us from our resource base. We may
call the Plains states flat and monot
onous, but a farmer intimately famil
iar with his land knows that there are
drainages here and fertile flatlands
there, that he should plant crops on
this side and buffer strips on that
one. A farmer intimately familiar
with her land knows that the right
thing for her pocket in today's econ

the land she plans to leave her chil

On any given Saturday, if you
run into Mike and Philip,
you're likely to find them cov
ered in dirt. My friends recently dug
into a new pursuit: gardening. At
present, this means incubating deli
cate seedlings on windowsills while
they haul bags of topsoil from garden
store to garden plot, adding nutrients
and substrate for their future vegeta
bles.

In time for this spring (rather,
summer, in my New England lexi
con) flurry of activity, the Environ
mental Working Group released a
report last week on soil erosion in the
lowa cornbelt.The news isn't good.
With the folly that is corn-based
ethanol and rising food prices world
wide, American corn (and soybean)
growers have seen crop values spike.
As a result, it's become economical
to plant more marginal cropland,
which tends to lie on steeper slopes
with higher erosion potential. So the
amount of topsoil we lose each year
(already at 2 billion tons nationally)
is increasing.
This has both short and long term
consequences: Immediately down
stream, waterways are clouded by
soil and polluted by fertilizer and
pesticides. Back at the farm, erosion
rates set the agricultural lifespan of
the land.
There's only so much that nutri
ent-booster shots can do, and once
the soil has blown or washed away,
the land is lost to farming. Indeed, ac
cording to Jared Diamond, soil ero
sion and consequent loss of soil fertil
ity may have contributed to the col
lapse of ancient civilizations, like the
Mayan Empire.
So it's critical that rates of soil ero
sion don't outstrip the natural rates
of soil production (by weathering of
rock and deposition from uphill and
upstream sources). Measuring soil
formation is no mean feat, but in a
2007 Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences paper, David
Montgomery calculated rates rang
ing from 0.01 to o.lmm of soil per
year, depending on how much geo
logical action the local landscape was
getting.
By comparison, erosion on lowan
farmland results in a loss of Imm of
soil per year. The USDA's threshold
values (the rates at which regulatory
alarm bells are supposed to sound)
are set at 0.4 to Imm per year.
In other words, we're eroding our
topsoil at 10 to 100 times the rate it
can be replenished, and our (suppos
edly scientific) farm authorities say
that's OK.
Still, we're holding onto our soil
more successfully than other coun
tries. In parts of Asia and South
America, erosion rates are double or

triple ours. But erosion rates are half
of ours in Europe, where the right set
of (enforced) incentives has farmers
planting cover crops (to hold soil in
place after harvesting), edging fields
with buffer zones (grassy strips that
entrain soil before it washes into
drainages) and practicing no-till
farming.
