## Legitimizing Torture 
### DANNY CULLENWARD JD Candidate, Stanford Law School, Class of 2013; Ph.D. Candidate, Environment Resources (E-IPER 
This Friday, UC-Berkeley Profes
sor John Yoo will visit the Law
School to speak at an event in room
290 from 12:45 to 2:00 p.m. Yoo's
presence on campus is an affront to
the dignity of our community. It also
undermines the University's mission
to train tomorrow's leaders to follow
the highest ethical standards. I ask all
interested members of the Stanford
community to join me in protesting
this event.
Although the topic is the United
States' military actions in Libya, Yoo
is best known for his work during the
Bush Administration. From 2001 to
2003, he served as a Deputy Assis
tant Attorney General in the De
partment of Justice's Office of Legal
Counsel (OLC). During his short
tenure, Yoo authored several of the
infamous "torture memos," which
provided legal cover for U.S. torture
policies. It is difficult to exaggerate
how extreme these memos were.
Yoo himself has described them as
allowing an interrogator to crush the
testicles of a detainee's child, so long
as the interrogator had the right in
tentions (whatever those might be).
In the larger debate about nation
al security, a wide variety of voices
must be heard. Yoo's is not one of
them, however, because he has no
credibility. At OLC, Yoo's job was to
candidly evaluate the law and advise
the Executive branch on the legality
of its proposed actions. Instead, Yoo
unabashedly advocated for the most
extreme kinds of torture, issuing
legal opinions that shielded anyone
who committed tortured up to the
point of causing organ failure or
death.
The legality of torture, whatever
one's view of its necessity, is hardly a
simple question. Ratified interna
tional treaties, national laws, state

laws and even common law doc
trines all have something to say
about the treatment of detainees.
Yoo's memos, however, dismissed
each and every source of law as ei
ther irrelevant or completely inap
plicable. His advice to the Executive
Branch was that even if it was illegal
to torture detainees, no criminal
charges could stick so long as the in
terrogator's specific intention wasn't
to cause the pain inflicted. In other
words, mere knowledge that torture
would hurt the detainee would not
suffice: if an interrogator really
meant to get the information he be
lieved a detainee had, then the tor
ture was merely incidental. Because
Yoo's memo was an official govern
ment opinion, anyone engaged in
torture can now rely on it as a crimi
nal defense, regardless of its validity.
Thus, he created a legal catch-22
that, like a black hole, has sucked up
any hope of the rule of law emerging
in its wake.
The torture memos have left a
permanent stain on the United
States' international reputation, one
with which our government has not
yet reckoned. In 2009, a report from
the Department of Justice Office of
Professional Responsibility con
cluded that Yoo "committed inten
tional professional misconduct when
he violated his duty to exercise inde
pendent legal judgment and render
thorough, objective, legal advice."
Unfortunately, a cowardly decision
by Associate Deputy Attorney Gen
eral John Margolis who once said
of himself, "I'm the department's
cleaner[,] I clean up messes," and
was also implicated in the politically
motivated U.S. Attorney firing scan
dal in early 2007 single-handedly
derailed this report. No matter. The
"forward-looking" Obama Admin
istration was happy with the out
come, having adopted many of the
policies put into place by the Bush
OLC. Now, on the basis of one attor
ney's opinion, there will be no fur
ther investigations. Once opened,
the option to torture like Pando
ra's Box seems incapable of
being closed.
Without fear of official recourse,
John Yoo remains free to roam the
lecture circuit, instead of contem
plating his mistakes inside the walls
of the federal prison system where
he belongs. Although one can find a
diversity of political voices support
ing the United States' torture policy,
there is no reason that its architects
should find a friendly audience at
Stanford. I hope students from
across the University will respect
fully protest Yoo's talk and make it
clear that torture advocates are not
welcome on this campus.
History will judge John Yoo for
his actions. The Stanford communi
ty should do so, too.
