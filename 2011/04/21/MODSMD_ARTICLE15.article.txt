## Jobless in Palo Alto (Where's Tom Hanks When You Need Him?) 
### Shane Savitsky 
Spring break is finally over for me,
guys! Yesterday was my return
to the humdrum life of class.
Granted, my class was on British rock
music and I'm in Oxford, so I think
things are pretty good. (Let's talk
next week when I have to read three
books and write a paper for my tuto
rial, okay?) Plus, the weather in Ox
ford this week is warmer than at Stan
ford. I need to enjoy this while I can. I
kind of think this first week is some
thing like vacation for me. I need it.
Even with jaunts to Denmark and a
lot of Netflix in my life, my extended
break was pretty stressful. You see,
April of my junior year has rolled
around and I still don't have a great
job for the summer.
Stanford seems to be the land
where your life lacks any meaning if
you don't have a great position
locked up for the summer. Some of
my friends have grabbed awesome
congressional internships and others
have their career paths set in stone
with positions on Wall Street. Yet I
can never seem to find these crazy op
portunities. I know they must be right
there (after all, this is Stanford the

land of endless possibility), but damn,
they're all just out of my reach. This
hypothetical great summer job has
become something like Bigfoot to me
in the last few weeks. People have
seen it, so I know it must possibly
exist; yet I don't think I'll ever get to
experience it for myself.
Now, don't get me wrong: this is
not a sob story. I haven't given up on
my job search. I'll probably take Brit
ney's advice and keep looking 'till the
world ends (or at least until May
ends). If I don't manage to find any
thing, I'll probably end up back in
Scranton for the summer, working in
a law office. It'll look pretty decent on
the resume and be perfectly construc
tive for my future career plans. How
ever, I, like so many Stanford stu
dents, just want to do something en
gaging and impactful with my sum
mer. More than anything, I've always
wanted to do research back on cam
pus within my chosen field of political
science. Who knew that would be
such a minefield?
I should be clear: political science

I, like so many Stanford
students, just want to do
something engaging
and impactful with my
summer.

is exactly what I want to do here at
Stanford. The classes and curriculum
are both absolutely fantastic. Howev
er, I feel like professors' interactions
with their students at Stanford can
leave something to be desired. The
political science department has this
thing called the Summer Research
College, where you can apply to be a
part of the research projects of differ
ent professors. I applied to three dif
ferent research projects, all of which

tied nicely into my interests and wait
ed for a response back. And waited.
And waited. Actually, I'm still waiting
even after two follow-up emails.
The positions have long been filled by
now, but I can think of nothing more
irritating than just not getting a re
sponse about my application. (Actu
ally, hearing Rebecca Black's "Fri
day" a thousand times in a row might
be more irritating, but only slightly.)
A note to professors: I know you're
really busy, but please send rejection
emails. It only has to be one sentence
long. I don't need any more than that,
I swear. It makes my life infinitely
easier, and my huge ego can handle
the hit, I promise. In fact, when I

spend a few hours writing you an ap
plication and a cover letter and I
don't hear a single word back from
you, there's probably no bigger slap
in the face. At least a rejection lets me
know you read my application ...
I know there are plenty of kids out
there at Stanford in the same boat as
I am. Consider this a cry to let others
know that they are not alone. While I
love Stanford, it does tend to be a
place that can make you feel really in
significant sometimes. Moreover, this
is also an excuse for me to complain
about what I perceive as the one mas
sive shortcoming of my academic de
partment. And you know what?
Whether I end up in Scranton or

Stanford or somewhere entirely dif
ferent this summer, I'll at least know
that I made a valiant effort at finding
a position that's right for me.
Honestly, wherever I end up, I'll
probably be really happy. So for now,
I won't sweat the small stuff, and I'll
enjoy the Oxford sunshine. And just
think: it could be worse; I could be
Andrew Luck at least my chosen
profession likely won't shut down for
a labor dispute.

you just want to share your own hiring
nightmares), then email Shane at sav
