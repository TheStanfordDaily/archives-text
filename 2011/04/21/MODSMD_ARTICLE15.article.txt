Spring break is finally over for me,
guys! Yesterday was my return
to the humdrum life of class.
Granted, my class was on British rock
music and I'm in Oxford, so I think
things are pretty good. (Let's talk
next week when I have to read three
books and write a paper for my tuto
rial, okay?) Plus, the weather in Ox
ford this week is warmer than at Stan
ford. I need to enjoy this while I can. I
kind of think this first week is some
thing like vacation for me. I need it.
Even with jaunts to Denmark and a
lot of Netflix in my life, my extended
break was pretty stressful. You see,
April of my junior year has rolled
around and I still don't have a great
job for the summer.
Stanford seems to be the land
where your life lacks any meaning if
you don't have a great position
locked up for the summer. Some of
my friends have grabbed awesome
congressional internships and others
have their career paths set in stone
with positions on Wall Street. Yet I
can never seem to find these crazy op
portunities. I know they must be right
there (after all, this is Stanford the

land of endless possibility), but damn,
they're all just out of my reach. This
hypothetical great summer job has
become something like Bigfoot to me
in the last few weeks. People have
seen it, so I know it must possibly
exist; yet I don't think I'll ever get to
experience it for myself.
Now, don't get me wrong: this is
not a sob story. I haven't given up on
my job search. I'll probably take Brit
ney's advice and keep looking 'till the
world ends (or at least until May
ends). If I don't manage to find any
thing, I'll probably end up back in
Scranton for the summer, working in
a law office. It'll look pretty decent on
the resume and be perfectly construc
tive for my future career plans. How
ever, I, like so many Stanford stu
dents, just want to do something en
gaging and impactful with my sum
mer. More than anything, I've always
wanted to do research back on cam
pus within my chosen field of political
science. Who knew that would be
such a minefield?
I should be clear: political science

I, like so many Stanford
students, just want to do
something engaging
and impactful with my
summer.
