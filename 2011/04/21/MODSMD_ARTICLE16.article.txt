# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,
President Hennessy has just established an immedi
ate, clear and reasonable standard that will undoubted
ly lead to improved awareness, treatment and reduced
incidence of sexual assault and violence on Stanford's
campus. At the same time, it is imperative, immediately,
for ASSU to do what Viviana Arcia recommends in her
op-ed: make the reasonable standard of proof a Consti
tutional revision "priority."
Sincerely,

PAUL G. BATOR
Lecturer, Stanford Introductory Studies

Dear Editor,
In the April 12 article, "Stallman weighs pros and
cons of digital inclusion," Mr. Ellithorpe's disagreement

with my views was evidently based on total incompre
hension of them, because he confused patent law with
copyright law. These two laws are totally different all
they have in common is one sentence in the Constitu
tion that authorizes them and have totally different
effects in the computing field.
Such confusion is widespread because the term
"intellectual property" encourages it.
That term lumps copyright law together with
patent law and lumps both of those together with
many other disparate laws. These laws were created
for diverse purposes, require different things and
have different practical consequences. To treat even
two of them as a single subject is the road to error.
Thus, to help avoid confusion, it helps to refuse to use
that term. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/
not-ipr.html.

Sincerely,

DR. RICHARD STALLMAN
President, Free Software Foundation
