## SLIDING INTO TROUBLE Baseball tries to stop skid against UCLA 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
It's a long season you can't let your emo
tions get too high or too low. You can't win every
game. But the great thing about baseball is that
you don't have to wait long to get another
chance.
Cliches aside, the No. 26 Stanford baseball
team needs to start winning some games.
Yes, the Cardinal (16-12, 3-6 Pac-10) has

been playing the best teams in the nation, and
yes, the games have been close but close (to
use another cliche) only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades. If Stanford wants to host an
NCAA regional playoff, it needs to find away to
turn those tough, one-run losses into wins.
That task will be easier said than done this
weekend, when No. 11 UCLA (19-12,9-3) pays
a visit to the Farm for a three-game series that
starts Thursday night, a day earlier than usual,
due to the Easter holiday.
Already in a prolonged slump, the Cardinal
has the unenviable job of facing what may be
the most talented pitching staff in college base
ball.
The Bruins will trot out their usual trio of
righthanders: Gerrit Cole on Friday, Trevor

Bauer on Saturday and Adam Plutko on Sun
day. The rotation's stats speak to UCLA's dom
inance on the mound, and none are more re
vealing than this: only Cole has an ERA above
two, and his is still a stingy 2.22.
Who knows, maybe this is the challenge
Stanford needs to wake up its bats. "We just
got to focus on getting baserunners; that's what
our coach preaches," said sophomore center
fielder Jake Stewart, one of the few starters not
mired in a slump. "Whether a walk or an error,
just get on anyway we can.
"We might have to win a one-run game; it
might not be getting six hits, we just got to get
one hit and execute on bringing him home,"
If Stanford can find away to scratch out a
few runs, its pitching should give it a chance to
win provided it can outduel the Bruins' solid
starters.
Sophomore Mark Appel will take the
mound Thursday night in an attempt to add a
win to his 2-4 record this season. In his last start
against Oregon State, the righthander tossed 6.2
innings of one-run baseball. However, Stanford
lost 1-0.
The Friday start will go to junior Jordan
Pries, who has allowed more than three earned
runs just once all season.
On Saturday, head coach Mark Marquess is
shaking up his staff and replacing struggling
sophomore Dean McArdle with surging senior
Danny Sandbrink, who has a 2.49 ERA, the sec
ond-best on the team.
With only five Pac-10 series remaining after
this weekend, Stanford cannot afford to slip any
further in the conference standings. These
games are not must-win games, but a series vic
tory would go a long way towards revitalizing a
depressed team.
"It's baseball, you're going to struggle,"
Stewart said. "It's hard to win games when
everyone struggles. We just got to stay positive
and keep working every single day. We can't
focus on what happened the last couple weeks."
And the last couple weeks have not been
pretty for Stanford.

Sophomore centerfielder Jake Stewart (above) has been one of the bright spots in the Cardinal's
recent offensive struggle, as he leads the team in extra base hits with 12 doubles and a triple.
State the first week of April, the
Cardinal has gone 4-5, losing two
Pac-10 series along the way.
First was a trip to USC, where
Stanford won the first game 8-1
but then the team-wide slump set
in. The Cardinal lost the next two
games 3-1 and 6-2.
After beating Pacific 3-1 in a
midweek game, Stanford's offense
continued to struggle against Ore
gon State. The Cardinal bats could
n't provide any support for Appel

in the first game, losing 1-0. The
Beavers then outgunned the Cardi
nal with excellent pitching and de
fense in the next two games, win
ning them 8-1 and 6-4 for a series
sweep.
The Cardinal removed the taste
of defeat with a 10-3 win over a less
than-stellar Santa Clara team on
Tuesday, but the true challenge will
be when the Bruins come to town
this weekend.
First pitch for Thursday's game
between the Bruins and Cardinal is
scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at Sunken
Diamond.

Since taking two games from Washington


IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore centerfielder Jake Stewart (above) has been one of the bright spots in the Cardinal's
recent offensive struggle, as he leads the team in extra base hits with 12 doubles and a triple.
State the first week of April, the
Cardinal has gone 4-5, losing two
Pac-10 series along the way.
First was a trip to USC, where
Stanford won the first game 8-1
but then the team-wide slump set
in. The Cardinal lost the next two
games 3-1 and 6-2.
After beating Pacific 3-1 in a
midweek game, Stanford's offense
continued to struggle against Ore
gon State. The Cardinal bats could
n't provide any support for Appel

in the first game, losing 1-0. The
Beavers then outgunned the Cardi
nal with excellent pitching and de
fense in the next two games, win
ning them 8-1 and 6-4 for a series
sweep.
The Cardinal removed the taste
of defeat with a 10-3 win over a less
than-stellar Santa Clara team on
Tuesday, but the true challenge will
be when the Bruins come to town
this weekend.
First pitch for Thursday's game
between the Bruins and Cardinal is
scheduled for 5:30 p.m. at Sunken
Diamond.
