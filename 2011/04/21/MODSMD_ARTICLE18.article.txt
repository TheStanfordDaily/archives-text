The Stanford men's tennis team is one of the
most storied collegiate athletic programs in the
country. In the past 37 years, the Cardinal has
won the NCAA Division I men's team tennis
championship an unprecedented 18 times.
With that track record, one might think
other teams would emulate the way the things
are run here on the Farm. However, in one glar
ing instance recruiting international players
other top teams across the country are doing
the exact opposite of the Cardinal.
The Stanford team is a diverse group of 13
guys together, the roster represents differ
ent ages, ethnicities and backgrounds. But of
the 13 players on the team, only one of them,
freshman Fawaz Hourani a walk-on who has
yet to tally any court time during matches is
foreign, hailing from Jordan.
Of the six best players from all 18 opponents
the Cardinal has faced this year, 76 out of 108
players or an average of 4.2 per team are
foreigners. At some point, each of these teams
has featured at least two international players in
its top six. Stanford, of course, has none.
To say that foreign players have taken over
the collegiate tennis game would be an under
statement. During matches, it's almost as com
mon to hear Spanish, German or French ex
changed by Stanford's adversaries as it is Eng
lish. Much as the professional game has been
taken over by international players there
are currently three American players in the top
25 of the Association of Tennis Professionals
(ATP) so too has the collegiate game. And
as the number of international players has in
creased in all levels of the game, the quality of
the tennis being played has also increased.
Jamin Ball, a highly-recruited freshman on
the team from nearby Menlo Park, commented
on the transition between the two wildly differ
ent competitive tennis experiences in the Unit
ed States high school and then college,
"The major difference is that there are so many

more international kids and foreign players,"
Ball said. "They really just add a totally new as
pect to the game, because before college in the
juniors, basically all the big national tourna
ments would have the same guys in them. Now,
since there are so many top new kids, you go

into a match knowing next to nothing about
your opponent. It's much harder."
For a freshman on a Division I tennis team,
Ball's experience has been rather rare. Normal
ly, joining a college team in this day and age
would imply joining a culture full of different
backgrounds and even different languages.
Multiculturalism is important to consider, be
cause team chemistry is a critically important as
pect of the college game. By virtue of being a
year-round sport and having many matches and
road-trips, tennis teams inevitably spend almost
all of their non-scholastic time together.
Because the Cardinal players are almost all
from the United States, Ball says that the team
doesn't have to deal with the chemistry chal
lenges that may face a squad with a greater in
ternational presence.
"We're really close as a team," Ball said,
"Everyone gets along great. We kind of need to
we spend so much time together."
Head coach John Whitlinger, an NCAA singles
champion at Stanford back in the 19705, had a
lot to say on the topic of the foreign invasion of
college tennis as well.
"Well, it's definitely added depth to the
game," Whitlinger said. "There's no question.
Just as professional tennis is, it's a worldwide
game now. Because of the international play
ers, the quality of the tennis now is just tremen
dous. It makes for a lot of competition and,
more importantly, it can allow for a program to
go from nowhere to somewhere just like that."
This change in recruiting has made team tennis
completely different than it used to be, and it is
Whitlinger's task to adapt to them. But given
the chemistry stemming from his team's com
mon, domestic background, Whitlinger says his
job as head coach at Stanford is a little different
than many of his colleagues in similar roles
around the country.
"First off, if there's an international kid
who's very good at tennis and can be admitted
to Stanford, we'd love to have him, no prob-

rarity in the world of college tennis these days.
