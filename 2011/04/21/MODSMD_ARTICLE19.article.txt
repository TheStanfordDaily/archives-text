# NFL set for influx of Cardinal
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Stanford's resurgence in the
college football world is no
secret. But, aside from a
Pac-12 Championship, one
of the few things missing
from its rise is a reasserted presence in
the NFL. The Cardinal has 16 players
in the pros a figure that places it in
the bottom half of the conference.
Both the 2008 and 2009 drafts passed
without a Stanford athlete being se
lected, and not since 2003 has a Cardi
nal football player been selected in
the first round.
But this is about to change. Look
ing at the talent Stanford currently has
on its roster, it is nearly a certainty that
the Cardinal will double, or come close
to doubling , its alumni in the NFL
within the next two years, even if you
look only at players who are consid
ered near-locks to be drafted.
Doubt it? Let's examine.
First, the 2011 draft. It's reasonable
to assume that there will be about five
Cardinal athletes who will be selected.
The prime candidates are Owen
Marecic, Richard Sherman, Sione Fua
and Thomas Keiser. Marecic is seen as
one of the two best fullbacks avail
able, with a skill set that could last him
a decade (or more) in the NFL. Full
back is not a premium position, but a
few are chosen each year.
Sherman's value fluctuates from the
second round to undrafted, depend
ing on which draft analyst you prefer
—he was most recently rated as a
third rounder but this much is cer
tain: his size, speed and background as
a wide receiver make him an intrigu
ing, if not developmental cornerback
at the next level.
Fua's experience and success as both a
4-3 one-tech defensive tackle and 3-4
noseguard has placed him solidly in
the mid-rounds. Keiser, who left
school a year early, is seen as a late
round outside linebacker prospect,
but he's expected to be selected.
After those four, there's Derek
Hall, Ryan Whalen, Andrew Phillips
(a late riser on a few draft boards) and
Chase Beeler. Even if just one of those
next four is selected (and it could be as
many as three),it keeps the above pre
diction — doubling Stanford's NFL
presence in the next 13 months in
tact.
Why? Because the 2012 draft
could set itself up as an expo of the
Cardinal's recent influx of talent. Take
your time to knock ferociously on
wood, then journey on.
Start at the top. Andrew Luck will
be the No. 1 pick in the draft, barring
significant injury. It'll be Stanford's
first No. 1 overall selection since John
Elway in 1983. And while he'd be the
Cardinal's first top-round pick in
nearly a decade, he isn't likely to be
the only Stanford athlete taken within
the draft's first 32 picks.
Many rate Moose Martin as the
Class of 2013's top offensive tackle, if
not the top underclassman OT over
all. Behind quarterback, tackle is the
game's most sought-after position.
With that in mind, some analysts have
him, predictably, as a top-10 selection.
That's not all: guard David DeCas
tro, like his classmate, is viewed as the
top guy at his spot. Offensive guard is
not as highly valued as tackle, but a
couple are generally taken in the first
round each year DeCastro has that

potential. Obviously this positioning
can change, and for our purposes it's
frankly unimportant (other than to
show that, yes, there's a pretty good
chance Martin and DeCastro would
come off the board in 2012 or
2013).Wh0 else is there? Chris
Owusu is seen as a first-round talent,
but his chronic injuries prompt con
cerns he needs to stay healthy, but
if he does, he's a near-shoo-in to be se
lected. Mel Kiper rates him fifth
among the 2012 wide receiver
prospects.
Coby Fleener, after his monster
Orange Bowl, has made his way onto

analysts' radars the athletic tight
end is currently ranked fourth on
Kiper's list. Kiper also has Delano
Howell as his No. 3 safety.
But we're still not done. For both
the 2012 and 2013 drafts, Chase
Thomas is seen as an early-mid round
pick at outside linebacker and Shayne
Skov is viewed as an elite talent at in
side linebacker.
That's 13 players between the
2011,2012 and 2013 drafts that are ex
pected to be selected. We're not going
out on a limb. And we're excluding a
whole host of talent from 2013 whose
draft status is too early to predict, but
who will have every opportunity to
put themselves in the conversation
guys like Stepfan Taylor, Jamal-
Rashad Patterson and Terrence
Stephens, among others.
Then there are the undrafted free

agents. Of the 16 Stanford players cur
rently in the NFL, five were not cho
sen in the draft in their respective
years. It stands to reason that of the
potential 2011 UDFAs (Whalen,
Phillips, Hall, Beeler and Nate
Whitaker) and some from 2012 (Matt
Masifilo, for instance), at least one has
a good chance of getting a roster spot
with an NFL club.
Having upward of 30 players in the
NFL is not an unattainable goal. Even
money says it happens. If it doesn't,
blame me for tempting fate; 'til then,
I'll be right here, bloodying my knuck
les on a two-by-four.

4-3 one-tech defensive tackle and 3-4
noseguard has placed him solidly in
the mid-rounds. Keiser, who left
school a year early, is seen as a late
round outside linebacker prospect,
but he's expected to be selected.
After those four, there's Derek
Hall, Ryan Whalen, Andrew Phillips
(a late riser on a few draft boards) and
Chase Beeler. Even if just one of those
next four is selected (and it could be as
many as three),it keeps the above pre
diction — doubling Stanford's NFL
presence in the next 13 months in
tact.
Why? Because the 2012 draft
could set itself up as an expo of the
Cardinal's recent influx of talent. Take
your time to knock ferociously on
wood, then journey on.
Start at the top. Andrew Luck will
be the No. 1 pick in the draft, barring
significant injury. It'll be Stanford's
first No. 1 overall selection since John
Elway in 1983. And while he'd be the
Cardinal's first top-round pick in
nearly a decade, he isn't likely to be
the only Stanford athlete taken within
the draft's first 32 picks.
Many rate Moose Martin as the
Class of 2013's top offensive tackle, if
not the top underclassman OT over
all. Behind quarterback, tackle is the
game's most sought-after position.
With that in mind, some analysts have
him, predictably, as a top-10 selection.
That's not all: guard David DeCas
tro, like his classmate, is viewed as the
top guy at his spot. Offensive guard is
not as highly valued as tackle, but a
couple are generally taken in the first
round each year DeCastro has that

potential. Obviously this positioning
can change, and for our purposes it's
frankly unimportant (other than to
show that, yes, there's a pretty good
chance Martin and DeCastro would
come off the board in 2012 or
2013).Wh0 else is there? Chris
Owusu is seen as a first-round talent,
but his chronic injuries prompt con
cerns he needs to stay healthy, but
if he does, he's a near-shoo-in to be se
lected. Mel Kiper rates him fifth
among the 2012 wide receiver
prospects.
Coby Fleener, after his monster
Orange Bowl, has made his way onto

analysts' radars the athletic tight
end is currently ranked fourth on
Kiper's list. Kiper also has Delano
Howell as his No. 3 safety.
But we're still not done. For both
the 2012 and 2013 drafts, Chase
Thomas is seen as an early-mid round
pick at outside linebacker and Shayne
Skov is viewed as an elite talent at in
side linebacker.
That's 13 players between the
2011,2012 and 2013 drafts that are ex
pected to be selected. We're not going
out on a limb. And we're excluding a
whole host of talent from 2013 whose
draft status is too early to predict, but
who will have every opportunity to
put themselves in the conversation
guys like Stepfan Taylor, Jamal-
Rashad Patterson and Terrence
Stephens, among others.
Then there are the undrafted free

agents. Of the 16 Stanford players cur
rently in the NFL, five were not cho
sen in the draft in their respective
years. It stands to reason that of the
potential 2011 UDFAs (Whalen,
Phillips, Hall, Beeler and Nate
Whitaker) and some from 2012 (Matt
Masifilo, for instance), at least one has
a good chance of getting a roster spot
with an NFL club.
Having upward of 30 players in the
NFL is not an unattainable goal. Even
money says it happens. If it doesn't,
blame me for tempting fate; 'til then,
I'll be right here, bloodying my knuck
les on a two-by-four.

Stanford's resurgence in the
college football world is no
secret. But, aside from a
Pac-12 Championship, one
of the few things missing
from its rise is a reasserted presence in
the NFL. The Cardinal has 16 players
in the pros a figure that places it in
the bottom half of the conference.
Both the 2008 and 2009 drafts passed
without a Stanford athlete being se
lected, and not since 2003 has a Cardi
nal football player been selected in
the first round.
But this is about to change. Look
ing at the talent Stanford currently has
on its roster, it is nearly a certainty that
the Cardinal will double, or come close
to doubling , its alumni in the NFL
within the next two years, even if you
look only at players who are consid
ered near-locks to be drafted.
Doubt it? Let's examine.
First, the 2011 draft. It's reasonable
to assume that there will be about five
Cardinal athletes who will be selected.
The prime candidates are Owen
Marecic, Richard Sherman, Sione Fua
and Thomas Keiser. Marecic is seen as
one of the two best fullbacks avail
able, with a skill set that could last him
a decade (or more) in the NFL. Full
back is not a premium position, but a
few are chosen each year.
Sherman's value fluctuates from the
second round to undrafted, depend
ing on which draft analyst you prefer
—he was most recently rated as a
third rounder but this much is cer
tain: his size, speed and background as
a wide receiver make him an intrigu
ing, if not developmental cornerback
at the next level.
Fua's experience and success as both a
4-3 one-tech defensive tackle and 3-4
noseguard has placed him solidly in
the mid-rounds. Keiser, who left
school a year early, is seen as a late
round outside linebacker prospect,
but he's expected to be selected.
