# NFL set for influx of Cardinal
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
Stanford's resurgence in the
college football world is no
secret. But, aside from a
Pac-12 Championship, one
of the few things missing
from its rise is a reasserted presence in
the NFL. The Cardinal has 16 players
in the pros a figure that places it in
the bottom half of the conference.
Both the 2008 and 2009 drafts passed
without a Stanford athlete being se
lected, and not since 2003 has a Cardi
nal football player been selected in
the first round.
But this is about to change. Look
ing at the talent Stanford currently has
on its roster, it is nearly a certainty that
the Cardinal will double, or come close
to doubling , its alumni in the NFL
within the next two years, even if you
look only at players who are consid
ered near-locks to be drafted.
Doubt it? Let's examine.
First, the 2011 draft. It's reasonable
to assume that there will be about five
Cardinal athletes who will be selected.
The prime candidates are Owen
Marecic, Richard Sherman, Sione Fua
and Thomas Keiser. Marecic is seen as
one of the two best fullbacks avail
able, with a skill set that could last him
a decade (or more) in the NFL. Full
back is not a premium position, but a
few are chosen each year.
Sherman's value fluctuates from the
second round to undrafted, depend
ing on which draft analyst you prefer
—he was most recently rated as a
third rounder but this much is cer
tain: his size, speed and background as
a wide receiver make him an intrigu
ing, if not developmental cornerback
at the next level.
Fua's experience and success as both a
4-3 one-tech defensive tackle and 3-4
noseguard has placed him solidly in
the mid-rounds. Keiser, who left
school a year early, is seen as a late
round outside linebacker prospect,
but he's expected to be selected.
After those four, there's Derek
Hall, Ryan Whalen, Andrew Phillips
(a late riser on a few draft boards) and
Chase Beeler. Even if just one of those
next four is selected (and it could be as
many as three),it keeps the above pre
diction — doubling Stanford's NFL
presence in the next 13 months in
tact.
Why? Because the 2012 draft
could set itself up as an expo of the
Cardinal's recent influx of talent. Take
your time to knock ferociously on
wood, then journey on.
Start at the top. Andrew Luck will
be the No. 1 pick in the draft, barring
significant injury. It'll be Stanford's
first No. 1 overall selection since John
Elway in 1983. And while he'd be the
Cardinal's first top-round pick in
nearly a decade, he isn't likely to be
the only Stanford athlete taken within
the draft's first 32 picks.
Many rate Moose Martin as the
Class of 2013's top offensive tackle, if
not the top underclassman OT over
all. Behind quarterback, tackle is the
game's most sought-after position.
With that in mind, some analysts have
him, predictably, as a top-10 selection.
That's not all: guard David DeCas
tro, like his classmate, is viewed as the
top guy at his spot. Offensive guard is
not as highly valued as tackle, but a
couple are generally taken in the first
round each year DeCastro has that
