## ResEd corrects mishap with coterm RAs Final housing decisions made for excess applicants 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Residential Education staff and current
residential assistants on the Row have
reached a final resolution after ResEd ini

resolution came after current RAs in the
affected houses questioned Res Ed's origi

There are currently 35 positions avail
able for RAs on the Row and a maximum
of 10 of these spots has been allotted for
students who do not have guaranteed
housing during the school year. This year,
13 coterm students were hired, and three of
these students' offers were revoked sever

wrote in an email to The Daily.

each of the individual houses affected to
come to the best solution for each of their
circumstances where possible," Boswell
said.
"These spots have very generously
been allocated through Student Housing
with the belief that the Row house system
