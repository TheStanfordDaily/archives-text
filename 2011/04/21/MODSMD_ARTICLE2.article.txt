## ResEd corrects mishap with coterm RAs Final housing decisions made for excess applicants 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO DESK EDITOR 
Residential Education staff and current
residential assistants on the Row have
reached a final resolution after ResEd ini
tially reversed job offers for three coterm
RAs for the 2011-12 academic year. The
resolution came after current RAs in the
affected houses questioned Res Ed's origi
nal decision to reject certain RA hires.
There are currently 35 positions avail
able for RAs on the Row and a maximum
of 10 of these spots has been allotted for
students who do not have guaranteed
housing during the school year. This year,
13 coterm students were hired, and three of
these students' offers were revoked sever
al weeks ago, prompting current housing
staffs to voice concerns about the process.
Final decisions were outlined in a meet
ing last week between ResEd and the cur
rent RAs of the affected houses: Bob, En
chanted Broccoli Forest (EBF) and Ham
marskjold (Hamm). However, ResEd As
sociate Dean Nate Boswell declined to
elaborate on the exact nature of the resolu
tion.
The final resolution "involves individ
ual applicants' private information," he
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We worked with staff members from
each of the individual houses affected to
come to the best solution for each of their
circumstances where possible," Boswell
said.
"These spots have very generously
been allocated through Student Housing
with the belief that the Row house system

can benefit tremendously from
being able to have more seasoned
students staff as RAs," Bos well
said.
He said that for the first time in
"many years" more than 10 stu
dents were chosen during the selec
tion, or "matching," process. In this
process, house staff members are
picked based on applicant prefer
ences from the current staff at each
Row house and living preferences
from the prospective RAs.
Initially, the ResEd staff decided
to rectify the mishap by using the
results of a series of interviews con
ducted by ResEd and current RAs
at the start of the application
process to decide on the final 10. In
terviewers asked questions on con
cepts such as community building
and conflict resolution, and rated
applicants' answers on a scale from
one to five.
According to Katrina Hui 'll,
the RA at Hamm, ResEd initially
decided not to offer a position to
her house's first-choice applicant,
who currently lives in the house, be
cause she scored poorly in the pre
screening process. Hui declined to
mention the applicant's name to
protect her identity. ResEd instead
gave the applicant an RA job at
Rains and appointed the house's
fifth choice applicant as the RA.
Hui said that, while she is unable
to speak for the other two affected

houses, ResEd neglected to tell
them about this first resolution.
"[We] heard about the situation
through the grapevine," she said.
"The prescreening process was
originally never meant to be the de
termining factor in the decision
making process," Hui later wrote in
an email to The Daily. "A key
source of frustration on the part of
my staff was because we were not
consulted about the dilemma be
fore the offers were made, we had
limited input about who ended up
getting the position."
Boswell noted that this concern
played a significant role in last
week's meeting, which sought "to
ensure a fair process in which
[ResEd] thoughtfully involve
house staff in problem solving to
reach reasonable conclusions."
Hui said ResEd was able to re
arrange the situation so that
Hamm's 2011-12 RA position was
re-offered to the house's first
choice applicant and its fifth choice
candidate will now be assuming the
RA post at Rains.
According to Boswell, the situa
tion will have important implica
tions for the selection process in fu
ture years.
"[lt] has caused us to review the
role of student staff without years
of guaranteed housing and the ef
fects our policies may have on the
housing guarantee for undergradu
ates," he said. "We will continue to
explore this question as we prepare
for next year."
