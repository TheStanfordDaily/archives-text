# Bears no match in Big Splash
## 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
The undefeated Stanford women's
water polo team captured its final reg
ular season road match last weekend
against Cal with an 8-5 win in the an
nual Big Splash. With the victory, the
No. 1 Cardinal (22-0,6-0) clinched the
top seed in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tourna
ment that will take place in two weeks.
Just like Stanford, the No. 2 Gold
en Bears (21-3, 6-1) entered the con
test with an impressive win streak of
their own, having won nine consecu
tive contests.
Stanford opened the Big Splash on
the attack, reeling off five goals from

five different players in the first six and
a half minutes of the game, with fresh
man driver Kaley Dodson, sophomore
two-meter Annika Dries, junior two
meter Melissa Seidemann and junior
drivers Alyssa Lo and Pallavi Menon
all scoring to give Stanford the lead.
Cal Sophomore driver Breda
Vosters stopped the bleeding with the
first of her three goals, cutting the
Cardinal lead to 5-1 at the end of the
first period.
After trading goals in start of the
second quarter, a Cal backhand in the
closing minute of the half set the score
at 6-3 going into the halftime break.

After polishing off the Cal Bears last weekend, the women's water polo team has one final tuneup against
San Jose State on Friday before opening up play in the MPSF tournament against Arizona State on April 29.
Excellent play by Cal junior
goalie Stephanie Peckham kept
Cal within striking distance, as she
notched 12 saves in the game, but
the Bears did not provide Peckham
with the offensive help she needed.
Cal struggled to score goals in the
second half against Stanford senior
goalie Amber Oland, who tallied
six saves of her own.
A low-scoring second half
where both the Bears and the Card
scored just twice followed the
nine-goal outburst in the first. Sei
demann and Lo each scored their
second goals for Stanford, and
Vosters and junior driver Elizabeth
McLaren scored for Cal in the
fourth quarter to bring the final
score to 8-5.

With just one game left in the
regular season, sophomore two
meter Annika Dries is first on the
team with 48 goals and Seidemann
is second with 37. Depth has been a
key trait this season, as Stanford
has greatly benefited from its di
versified attack six different
players have over 20 goals.
Stanford will face San Jose
State in its regular season finale, in
which it will honor the three sen
iors on the squad: goalies Kim
Hall and Amber Oland, along with
driver Kim Krueger, a Los Altos
native.
Senior day is set for Friday night
at 6 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
The Cardinal will kick off the
MPSF Tournament against Ari
zona State in the quarterfinal
round on Friday, April 29, at 1:30
p.m. at San Jose State.
