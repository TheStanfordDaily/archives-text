### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
The undefeated Stanford women's
water polo team captured its final reg
ular season road match last weekend
against Cal with an 8-5 win in the an
nual Big Splash. With the victory, the
No. 1 Cardinal (22-0,6-0) clinched the
top seed in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) tourna
ment that will take place in two weeks.
Just like Stanford, the No. 2 Gold
en Bears (21-3, 6-1) entered the con
test with an impressive win streak of
their own, having won nine consecu
tive contests.
Stanford opened the Big Splash on
the attack, reeling off five goals from

five different players in the first six and
a half minutes of the game, with fresh
man driver Kaley Dodson, sophomore
two-meter Annika Dries, junior two
meter Melissa Seidemann and junior
drivers Alyssa Lo and Pallavi Menon
all scoring to give Stanford the lead.
Cal Sophomore driver Breda
Vosters stopped the bleeding with the
first of her three goals, cutting the
Cardinal lead to 5-1 at the end of the
first period.
After trading goals in start of the
second quarter, a Cal backhand in the
closing minute of the half set the score
at 6-3 going into the halftime break.
