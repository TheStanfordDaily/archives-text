# Track and field teams head to Berkeley
## 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
The Stanford track and
field teams, fresh off a sweep
of the Cal men and women
in last weekend's Big Meet,
will head to its rival's home
for the Brutus Hamilton In
vitational this weekend.
At the Big Meet, Stanford
impressed its home fans with
a 98-65 win by the men and
an 88-75 win by the women.
Great performances
abounded for the No. 8 men,
who jumped out to a com
fortable lead over the Gold
en Bears and never looked
back. Meanwhile, the
women, ranked No. 17 in the
country, were locked in a
tight struggle with Cal
throughout the day. It took a
1-2 finish from redshirt sen
ior Kate Niehaus and senior
Stephanie Marcy in the 3,000

meters, the meet's penulti
mate event, for Stanford to clinch the win.
This weekend's meet in Berkeley will be focused on
individual events rather than the team scoring of the
Big Meet.The Cardinal will send only part of its team to
Berkeley, with the field events beginning on Friday and
the track events beginning on Saturday.
