## Helicopter first lands on Stanford's Sand Hill Road fields 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President Barack Obama
traveled to California on
Wednesday to discuss his deficit
reduction plan at Facebook's
Palo Alto headquarters and at
tend three Democratic fundrais
ers in San Francisco. The visit
marked the middle of a three-day
trip to Virginia, California and
Nevada for the administration to
sell its budget framework and for
the President to raise money for
his party and re-election cam
paign.
In Obama's first major trip
since he announced his 2012 cam
paign and since he and congres
sional Republicans narrowly
averted a government shutdown
two weeks ago, the president
landed at Stanford's Sand Hill
Road fields after landing in San
Francisco. Typically the location
of student intramural sport
games, the fields on Wednesday
were swept and secured by Stan
ford and Palo Alto police, U.S.
Marshals and Secret Service per
sonnel before five large helicop
ters, including the president's
Marine One, touched down at
about 1:30 p.m.
Obama then used his ground
motorcade for the short trip to
nearby Facebook headquarters
on Page Mill Road. His arrival
prompted street closures on Sand
Hill Road, El Camino Real, Stan
ford Avenue, California Avenue
and Page Mill Road.
Stanford spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin told The Daily that high
profile helicopter landings on
campus are rare because the Uni
versity's general use permit with
Santa Clara County restricts
landings to those that are hospi
tal-related or related to the travel
of a head of state. Obama is the
first sitting head of state to have
visited Facebook, the social-net
working giant co-founded by
Mark Zuckerberg in 2004.
Zuckerberg moderated
Wednesday's town hall, which
was held in a large warehouse at
the company's nondescript cam
pus just east of Stanford. A com
pany employee at the event said
