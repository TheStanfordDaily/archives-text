# Obama visits Facebook
## Helicopter first lands on Stanford's Sand Hill Road fields 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President Barack Obama
traveled to California on
Wednesday to discuss his deficit
reduction plan at Facebook's
Palo Alto headquarters and at
tend three Democratic fundrais
ers in San Francisco. The visit
marked the middle of a three-day
trip to Virginia, California and
Nevada for the administration to
sell its budget framework and for
the President to raise money for
his party and re-election cam
paign.
In Obama's first major trip
since he announced his 2012 cam
paign and since he and congres
sional Republicans narrowly
averted a government shutdown
two weeks ago, the president
landed at Stanford's Sand Hill
Road fields after landing in San
Francisco. Typically the location
of student intramural sport
games, the fields on Wednesday
were swept and secured by Stan
ford and Palo Alto police, U.S.
Marshals and Secret Service per
sonnel before five large helicop
ters, including the president's
Marine One, touched down at
about 1:30 p.m.
Obama then used his ground
motorcade for the short trip to
nearby Facebook headquarters
on Page Mill Road. His arrival
prompted street closures on Sand
Hill Road, El Camino Real, Stan
ford Avenue, California Avenue
and Page Mill Road.
Stanford spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin told The Daily that high
profile helicopter landings on
campus are rare because the Uni
versity's general use permit with
Santa Clara County restricts
landings to those that are hospi
tal-related or related to the travel
of a head of state. Obama is the
first sitting head of state to have
visited Facebook, the social-net
working giant co-founded by
Mark Zuckerberg in 2004.
Zuckerberg moderated
Wednesday's town hall, which
was held in a large warehouse at
the company's nondescript cam
pus just east of Stanford. A com
pany employee at the event said

President Obama and Facebook held a town hall meeting Wednesday to discuss the ways in which the administration
plans to reduce the national deficit. Obama took questions from Facebook employees in attendance
and users participating online during the hour-long meeting. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg moderated.
the audience consisted of approxi
mately 700 employees and several
White House invitees, among them
House minority leader Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.), Lt. Gov. Gavin
Newsom, State Controller John
Chiang, Rep. John Garamendi (D-
Calif.), Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.)
and Palo Alto Mayor Sid Espinosa.
The hour-long meeting was
streamed online, giving Obama the
chance to tap into and energize a
young base that helped propel him
to the White House in 2008. More
than 46,000 Facebook users indicat
ed online that they would watch the
live stream of the event, and the live
audience appeared engaged

throughout the hour, applauding
just over 20 times and giving the
president standing ovations at the
beginning and end of the meeting.

The president was jovial
throughout the town hall, immedi
ately noting that he is "the guy who
got Mark [Zuckerberg] to wear a

jacket and tie," which Zuckerberg
also did when Obama dined with
him, Stanford President John Hen
nessy and other Silicon Valley lead
ers in February on the president's
last visit to the Bay Area.
Later, Zuckerberg and Obama
were open about their support for
one another. Introducing a question
about education from a Facebook
user, Zuckerberg first said, "I think
the Race to the Top stuff that you
guys have done is one of the most
under-appreciated and most impor
tant things that your administration
has done."
The president acknowledged the
importance of Zuckerberg's recent
$lOO million donation to help im
prove schools in Newark, NJ.
Questions came from both audi
ence members and Facebook users,
and their focuses ranged from tax
policy to health care, housing and
immigration reform to investment
in education and infrastructure.
On the pressing issue of resolv
ing the partisan budget dispute in
Washington, Democrats and Re
publicans have agreed that $4 tril
lion needs to be cut over the next 10
years, but the parties disagree about
where the cuts should occur.
Obama advocated a combination of
spending cuts and tax increases on
the wealthy.
Zuckerberg, whose personal
wealth Forbes estimates at $13.5 bil
lion, replied, "I'm cool with that."
Near the end, Obama urged
members of the audience, regard
less of their political affiliation, to
"put the same energy and imagina
tion that [they] put into Facebook
into the political process."
The president said that if they
did so, "there's nothing we can't
solve."
Zuckerberg gifted Obama a
hooded sweatshirt with Facebook's
name across the front a trade
mark of the 26-year-old CEO's
wardrobe. Obama returned to San
Francisco following the town hall to
attend two fundraisers Wednesday
evening and one Thursday morning.
