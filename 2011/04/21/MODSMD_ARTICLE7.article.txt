# Government launches teaching initiative for Affordable Care Act
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Cassandra Feliciano 
U.S. Secretary of Education
Arne Duncan and Secretary of
Health and Human Services (HHS)
Kathleen Sebelius launched a new
initiative yesterday to teach gradu
ating college seniors about the
health insurance options available
to them through the Affordable
Care Act.
The act, which President Barack
Obama signed into a law on March
23, assures that approximately 1.2
million graduates can opt to stay on
their parents' health plan until they
turn 26. In the absence of the Act,
those graduates would have been
forced to find their own coverage
upon receiving their diplomas.
"Americans in their twenties are
almost twice as likely to go without
health insurance as older adults,
making them vulnerable to debt
from high medical bills," Duncan
said in a press release yesterday.
"We want to work with college and
university presidents and campus
leaders to ensure more young adults
can get the coverage and care they
need to stay healthy even if they are
unemployed or looking for a job."
To that end, letters were sent to
schools across the country outlining
how university officials can reach
out to their students, including post
ing a new "badge" on school web
sites that links to information about
the law. The HHS and Education
departments have also offered to
hold information sessions to explain
these options.
