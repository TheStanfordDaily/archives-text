Some of you know that the
Milk Pail is working with a
small 40 acre dairy farm
north of Davis. The Milk Pail
just bought 5 more Holstein
cows to help Paul, our dairy farmer friend, produce
more milk. Some of this milk is used by Paul to make
a wonderful French style cheese called Fromage
Blanc. Way better than Cream Cheese in taste !
Imagine having 20 exotic cheeses!
