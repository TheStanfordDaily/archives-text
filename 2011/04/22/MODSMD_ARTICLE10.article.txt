# Dorms short on RoHos for Admit Weekend
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
The Admit Weekend Team needs
approximately 200 additional room
hosts (RoHos) to accommodate the
prospective freshmen (ProFros)
who will arrive next Thursday. Some
RoHos have volunteered to host
multiple ProFros if the need arises.
Toward the end of a campus-wide
competition among dorms to sign
up
the most RoHos on Monday, the
Admit Weekend Team sent out an
email announcing that each dorm
needed a minimum of 20 students to
accommodate all of the visiting ad
mits. The team currently has 1,250
RoHos signed up and needs to meet

the correct ratio of male and female
hosts, according to Stewart Macgre
gor-Dennis 'l3, an Admit Weekend
organizer.
"It seems like there's a pretty
common trend where the last
RoHos sign up just a few weeks be
fore the event," he said. "I think it's
just that a lot of people at Stanford
work around deadlines."
The team is identifying and tar
geting their outreach efforts toward
students who have not signed up.
