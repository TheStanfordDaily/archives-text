## EDITORIAL Biking at Stanford: how to keep leading the pack 
### 
It should come as no surprise to
students to learn that the League
of American Bicyclists recently
named Stanford the most bicycle
friendly university in the nation. We
should remember that the vehicle
free paths, bike racks, bike lanes and
subsidized helmets that we take for
granted have not always been here,
and that biking on campus is an en
joyable, relatively safe option for so
many of us only because of far-sight
ed investments of the past. Today, al
most 22 percent of Stanford faculty,
staff and students get to work or
class on bicycles. Stanford should not
rest on this accomplishment; rather,
it should continue to improve the cy
cling experience on campus and
work with nearby communities to
make cycling a safer option for all
students and local commuters.

traffic in the center of campus could
be significantly improved if students
kept activities several feet removed
from the bike path.

The biggest problem with cycling
in the area goes far beyond Stanford.
Although there are many beautiful,
bicycle-friendly East-West streets in
the area, such as Page Mill Road,
Sand Hill Road and Woodside Road,
there is no north-south corridor to
connect them. Considering that cities
on the Peninsula are arrayed north to
south, this has the effect of isolating
downtown areas from some bicycle
commuters and forcing others onto
dangerous thoroughfares like El
Camino Real.Two cyclists were killed
on El Camino just last October.
The most promising starting
point for a north-south bicycle cor
ridor is Alma Street. Already, the
street does a good job connecting
Palo Alto with Menlo Park, and has
the advantage of being near most
residential and commercial devel
opments. South of downtown Palo
Alto, however, Alma Street's bike
lanes disappear without any shoul
der to replace them, making the
street very dangerous street for cy
clists. North of Menlo Park, the
road simply ends. Improving bicy
cle infrastructure on Alma Street
and integrating it with nearby east
west roads would not only make cy
cling practical for many more peo
ple, it would save lives.
Stanford recognizes the useful
ness and efficiency of bicycle trans
portation in away few other univer
sities do. Local communities are also
widely considered to be leaders in
the provision of bicycle infrastruc
ture. As we enter an era of perma
nently high gasoline prices, Stanford
and the Bay Area should do their ut
most to make alternative modes of
transportation efficient and safe. On
a micro level, this means addressing
problems on campus like Escondi
do Road and White Plaza. On a
macro level, it means bike-friendly
roads that link downtown areas in a
direct way, allowing cyclists to avoid
mazes of side streets or dangerous
highways like El Camino Real.

On the campus level, problems
are generally congestion-related
and affect only small areas. Some
areas, such as the intersection of Es
condido Road and Lasuen Mall
(widely known to students as the
"circle of death") do not lend them
selves to simple solutions, but oth
ers do and should not be dealt with
accordingly. For example, where
Escondido Mall becomes Escondi
do Road near Meyer Library, there
are only two narrow ramps allow
ing cyclists from campus onto the
road. This often results in blockages
especially when cars park in
front of the ramps as well as nu
merous cyclists moving onto the
sidewalk, which is dangerous to
pedestrians. The common-sense so
lution is to make the entire intersec
tion between Escondido Mall and
Escondido Road sloped.
Another area of high congestion
is White Plaza. Every weekday
around lunchtime, student groups
flock to White Plaza to spread infor
mation, sell tickets and generally en
gage in campus life. While the vi
brant atmosphere of White Plaza is a
vital part of the Stanford experience,
groups often encroach on bike paths,
forcing pedestrians and cyclists into
slow-moving corridors that some
times come to a complete halt. Bike
