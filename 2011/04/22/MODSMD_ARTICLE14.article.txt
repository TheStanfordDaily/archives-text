Think Again

Dear Editor,
I was extremely disappointed to
read Wednesday's Editorial. Al
though I understand the writers'
motivation to argue that many
Stanford students studying techno
logically-oriented majors love their
fields, the piece is filled with flawed
logic and a dangerously mistaken
frame in which to place the argu
ment they seek to make. I am em
barrassed that people outside of the
Farm could see the editorial and
judge Stanford and its students by
such a misguided account of Stan
ford academics and culture.
The writers assert that "there's a
battle raging for the soul of Stan
ford," and that the administration
has had to "save the humanities."
Perhaps the language was intended
facetiously, but the sentiment misses
the truth either way: although enroll
ments in humanities courses are
down, twice as many Stanford stu
dents are enrolled in humanities ma
jors as are students across America,
as Ms. McGirr reported in The Daily
on Tuesday. An effort to increase en
rollments is surely not intended to
"save" areas of study that have exist
ed across cultures for millennia; the
humanities as a whole is not, and
never will be, as ineffectual as the ed
itorial would have us believe. In eco
nomically demanding times, stu
dents move toward majors that they
view as more applicable to particular
job markets soon after graduation.
Literature, music, art, philosophy
and the many other programs that
constitute the rich fabric of a world
class humanities program have sur
vived economic downturns before,
and an increasing interest in comput
ers is not symptomatic of the end of
some of humanity's oldest and most

respected disciplines.
Another logical error came
when the piece drew an analogy be
tween Introduction to the Humani
ties and CS 106 A.While IHUM is a
university-wide, non-departmental
freshman requirement, CS 106A is
a gateway class to various programs
and is offered through the Comput
er Science Department. If a science
student forms his or her impression
of humanities work based on an im
perfect freshman program, that stu
dent has made a regrettable error. I
encourage such a person to take a
real humanities course from one of
the hundreds of outstanding profes
sors that do innovative work in their
fields here. Furthermore, judging
huge segments of disciplines at
Stanford based on two Courserank
figures is simply poor research.
But the real problem with the
piece comes later, when the writers
suggest that humanities students
choose to weasel out of science re
quirements, while science and tech
nology students suffer through in
tense humanities requirements. The
Board undermines its own point,
though: to judge the humanities at
Stanford based on IHUM proves
that the person in question has not
taken real humanities coursework.
And as someone who is double
majoring in English and philosophy
the two fields the Editorial
Board's quip mocks in the closing
sentence I promise that the hu
manities does not reduce to reading
Shakespeare and Plato all day. The
"soul of Stanford" ought to be as
much part humanistic as it is techno
logical, and there's much more to hu
manities than just "Hamlet" and
Plato's "Republic." Come take a hu
manities class and see.
