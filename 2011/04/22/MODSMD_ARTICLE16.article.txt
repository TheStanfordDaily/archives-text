## Hey, Do I Know You from... Facebook? 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Last weekend I was at the early
stages of a soon-to-be-larger
party, hoping I wouldn't be
too noticeable as I crashed an in
house only pregame. It turned out
that the residents of the house were
perfectly friendly, however, and
once I realized this I tentatively ad
vanced towards the bar where two
girls I didn't know were adding a lit
tle too much vodka to not quite
enough cranberry juice.
As I approached, I glanced at
them and realized that I did know
them. I knew quite a bit about them.
No, we hadn't been introduced be
fore. Yes, we had mutual friends. But
the ultimate source of my knowl
edge was Facebook.

Call me a "stalker" or a "creep,"
but I prefer to be called an intelli
gence-gatherer. I like to know who
people are, what they're doing and
what events are going on around
me. Do I want to know what parties
are happening this weekend? Yes.
Do I want to monitor the relation
ship status of that one hottie in class
with me? Obviously. Do I want to

patrol the walls of my mutual
friends to see if they make lunch
plans without me? Damn right!
Why wasn't I invited to lunch too?!
As a result, I had long ago locat
ed those two girls on Facebook. I
swear, I hadn't stalked either of

them that recently! But I knew a lit
tle bit more than just their first and
last names I had a pretty good
idea of who they were friends with,
who one of them had dated and
what they both did last summer (in
a non-horror movie kind of way).
Now, I realize that few people
would choose to walk up to a sup
posed stranger and open with, "Hey,
I've seen you on Facebook!" But
we've all dealt with that climactic
moment when you finally meet
whom you had previously only en
countered on Facebook. You
might 've seen that name on your
friend's wall or in a photo album, so
you naturally clicked. Who's asking
my friend out to coffee? Who is this
girl using emoticons all over my
friend's ex-boyfriend's wall? Why is
that guy I hate suddenly besties
with my senior formal date? And
suddenly there they are in the flesh.
So, when you're actually intro
duced to them, you can do one of
several things:

Call me a "stalker" or
a "creep," but I prefer
to be called an
intelligence gatherer.
