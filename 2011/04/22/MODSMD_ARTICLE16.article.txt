## Hey, Do I Know You from... Facebook? 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Last weekend I was at the early
stages of a soon-to-be-larger
party, hoping I wouldn't be
too noticeable as I crashed an in
house only pregame. It turned out
that the residents of the house were
perfectly friendly, however, and
once I realized this I tentatively ad
vanced towards the bar where two
girls I didn't know were adding a lit
tle too much vodka to not quite
enough cranberry juice.
As I approached, I glanced at
them and realized that I did know
them. I knew quite a bit about them.
No, we hadn't been introduced be
fore. Yes, we had mutual friends. But
the ultimate source of my knowl
edge was Facebook.

Call me a "stalker" or a "creep,"
but I prefer to be called an intelli
gence-gatherer. I like to know who
people are, what they're doing and
what events are going on around
me. Do I want to know what parties
are happening this weekend? Yes.
Do I want to monitor the relation
ship status of that one hottie in class
with me? Obviously. Do I want to

patrol the walls of my mutual
friends to see if they make lunch
plans without me? Damn right!
Why wasn't I invited to lunch too?!
As a result, I had long ago locat
ed those two girls on Facebook. I
swear, I hadn't stalked either of

them that recently! But I knew a lit
tle bit more than just their first and
last names I had a pretty good
idea of who they were friends with,
who one of them had dated and
what they both did last summer (in
a non-horror movie kind of way).
Now, I realize that few people
would choose to walk up to a sup
posed stranger and open with, "Hey,
I've seen you on Facebook!" But
we've all dealt with that climactic
moment when you finally meet
whom you had previously only en
countered on Facebook. You
might 've seen that name on your
friend's wall or in a photo album, so
you naturally clicked. Who's asking
my friend out to coffee? Who is this
girl using emoticons all over my
friend's ex-boyfriend's wall? Why is
that guy I hate suddenly besties
with my senior formal date? And
suddenly there they are in the flesh.
So, when you're actually intro
duced to them, you can do one of
several things:

Call me a "stalker" or
a "creep," but I prefer
to be called an
intelligence gatherer.

1) You play dumb. You meet him
and you act like you've really never
heard of him before, even if you've
been prowling his profile daily.
Here's my tactic for when I know
somebody already but don't want
him to think I'm a creep because I
already know what his favorite
bands are and who his girlfriend is:
I stumble over his first name like it's
in a foreign language, just to throw
him off track. "Miriam, have you
met John?" "Oh, Juh-on? John.
Nope! Nice to meet you!" Believe
me, it works.
2) You play it casual. You meet
someone who is quite obviously a
mutual friend, and you've been
wondering when you'll finally meet
her since your friends are clearly
ditching you sometimes to hang out
with her, ugh. After you're intro
duced to said person, you name
drop a little bit with, "Oh, you're

friends with Jack and Jill! Yeah,
they're friends of mine." Maybe you
only really knew this because of
Facebook, but if you namedrop
convincingly, she'll assume that you
know what you know because you
heard it from your mutual friends,
not from her profile.
3) You tell it like it is.This is risky,
and there are ways to be really
creepy about it versus only a little
weird. I wouldn't suggest that you
walk up to someone and immedi
ately say, "Oh em gees, I loved your
spring break album the pictures
of Hawaii are simply gorgeous!
Ooh, but I'm sorry about, ya know,
the relationship thing. Don't worry,
he's a douche for breaking up with
you two weeks before senior for
mal."

No, no. Don't betray the true ex
tent of your knowledge. Even
though a lot of us are on Facebook,
purposefully stalking or simply
being exposed to our newsfeeds, no
need to put it all in the open. You
have to be the judge of the situation
you're in, but I would like to briefly
advocate for a "creepier" approach.

Back to the bar with the two girls
making really strong drinks. My
friend came over to introduce us all,
and the ensuing conversation was
wonderful. I've used fake names to
preserve anonymity.
My friend: "Miriam, this is Jane.
Jane, this is Miriam."
Jane: "Are you Miriam ... Ello
ra Marks?"
Me: "Why yes. Are you ... Jane
Stanford?"
It was a pleasant surprise, albeit
alcohol-induced. But it's kind of a
great feeling when someone rattles
off a middle and last name once
you've declared your first. Let's be
honest, as much as we call it
"creepy" and "weird," it's kind of a
nice feeling to know that someone
out there is interested in you. And it
implies a certain amount of mutual
Facebook creeping that I think we
can afford to disclose.

Miriam encourages you to betray any
knowledge of her that you've creepi
ly gleaned from Facebook: mel
