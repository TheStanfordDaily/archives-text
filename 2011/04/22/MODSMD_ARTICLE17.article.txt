# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Baby's Got The Bends (Oh No) 
### Kristian Bailey 
Saturday night I had what I can
safely say is the worst dream
I've ever had in my life. I
dreamt that I was falling out of con
trol. That I was becoming the per
son that nearly everyone I told I was
going to school in California feared
I would become: California embod
ied. A sort of hippie-ish (don't think
I am), pansexual (pretty sure I'm
not, though that chair over there is
looking pretty fine...just kidding!)
druggie (your love is my drug; also,
occasionally alcohol) who was into
organics (I hate them), yoga (can't
even touch my toes), bumming
around and surfing on the beach all
day (I can't swim) and psychics (we
can't even understand the past
how can we begin to guess at the fu
ture?). "We knew you wouldn't last!
We knew you couldn't make it so far
away from home!" the voices chant
ed. I feared the reproach of my par
ents, as they nodded disapprovingly
over what I imagined was my

drugged-out, sexed-up and over
psyched alter ego.
And as soon as I thought I didn't
want to see their disapproval, they
disappeared or rather, I disap
peared. I was sucked into a vortex,
into cyberspace. I suddenly couldn't
prove that I, or anyone I loved, ex
isted. I had digital evidence of them
I could see my mom's emails and
text messages, see my friends' Face
book pictures and updates and hear
my father's voice on the phone
but none of that was tangible. Be
cause I couldn't see and hear them
in the immediate, because I couldn't
physically feel their presence, they

ceased to be real.
And in a sense both of these
things came true aspects of both
my nightmares manifested them
selves to some degree in my con
scious life this past week.
While 1 was able to pick up the
phone and speak to my mother and
father Sunday morning, the reality
of the distance between New York
and San Francisco set in for the first
time. I couldn't just book a flight
and go home for the weekend, or
even for a week it was too expen
sive. Nor could my parents ideal
ly both of them, along with my little
sister, but even just one of them
fly out to stay with me for a couple
of days. From January through now,
and until June 10 or so, they really
only exist to me through Gmail and
my cellphone we don't even
have Skype working yet.
I'd always boasted to my

friends and to my family that 1
had not yet felt homesick at Stan
ford because I loved my family and
knew we'd all be there for each
other when I returned home in
June, and because Stanford was one
of the places where I was most com
fortable; yet, here I was homesick
for the first time and sad that not
everything was working out as I'd
planned.
And up until this week, I'd felt
like I had the whole New York City-
Stanford thing down that I per
fectly embodied how to pack up,
leave your friends and family, move
2,500 miles across the continent
and live a happy and successful ac
ademic and social life. The whole
"work hard, play hard" mantra
seemed to fit both my identity as a
fast-paced, hardcore, go-get-'em
New Yorker and as a happy, content
and (to use my favorite California
lingo) "chill" Stanford student.
When I was picking schools, my
parents warned that they wouldn't
be able to visit me as a family and
that I wouldn't be able to come
home whenever, if ever, something
went wrong.
And nothing went wrong, nor
did I think anything would, until
this Wednesday night, when I
wound up in the emergency room
due to naivete about baked goods
combined with something that was
n't your love or alcohol.
I haven't ridden in an ambu
lance in recent or even distant
memory; nor had I ever been in the
emergency room without my par
ents. Beyond the immediate ques
tions of insurance costs, University
repercussions and, of course, my
health, I had the more remote

thought that I never wanted to get
sick enough to ride in an ambulance
or be admitted into a hospital
again. I hate the amount of sickness
and suffering that is concentrated
in hospitals.
Hard as this might be for me, it
must be harder for my parents, who
have virtually no control or imme
diate knowledge of what happened.
So to them I say two things: (1) I'm
sorry for making stupid decisions
and, pardon my language, scaring
the shit out of you; (2) thank you for
treating me like a young-adult
like a semi-autonomous college
student and not like a high
school kid so far.
As far as the broader context for
what I did to wind up where I was
last night, what I've learned from
the ordeal so far, how I judge myself
the situation and what comes next,
I'm not so sure.

Kristian's looking for two candidates
to serve as his parents and physically
chew him out on their behalf and
then give him a big hug. If you'd like
to sign up for an interview, message
him at kbailey@stanford.edu. Listen
to "The Bends" by Radiohead if you
didn't get the title reference.

and (to use my favorite California
lingo) "chill" Stanford student.
When I was picking schools, my
parents warned that they wouldn't
be able to visit me as a family and
that I wouldn't be able to come
home whenever, if ever, something
went wrong.
And nothing went wrong, nor
did I think anything would, until
this Wednesday night, when I
wound up in the emergency room
due to naivete about baked goods
combined with something that was
n't your love or alcohol.
I haven't ridden in an ambu
lance in recent or even distant
memory; nor had I ever been in the
emergency room without my par
ents. Beyond the immediate ques
tions of insurance costs, University
repercussions and, of course, my
health, I had the more remote

thought that I never wanted to get
sick enough to ride in an ambulance
or be admitted into a hospital
again. I hate the amount of sickness
and suffering that is concentrated
in hospitals.
Hard as this might be for me, it
must be harder for my parents, who
have virtually no control or imme
diate knowledge of what happened.
So to them I say two things: (1) I'm
sorry for making stupid decisions
and, pardon my language, scaring
the shit out of you; (2) thank you for
treating me like a young-adult
like a semi-autonomous college
student and not like a high
school kid so far.
As far as the broader context for
what I did to wind up where I was
last night, what I've learned from
the ordeal so far, how I judge myself
the situation and what comes next,
I'm not so sure.

Up until this
week, I'd felt like I
had the whole
New York City-
Stanford thing
down.
Saturday night I had what I can
safely say is the worst dream
I've ever had in my life. I
dreamt that I was falling out of con
trol. That I was becoming the per
son that nearly everyone I told I was
going to school in California feared
I would become: California embod
ied. A sort of hippie-ish (don't think
I am), pansexual (pretty sure I'm
not, though that chair over there is
looking pretty fine...just kidding!)
druggie (your love is my drug; also,
occasionally alcohol) who was into
organics (I hate them), yoga (can't
even touch my toes), bumming
around and surfing on the beach all
day (I can't swim) and psychics (we
can't even understand the past
how can we begin to guess at the fu
ture?). "We knew you wouldn't last!
We knew you couldn't make it so far
away from home!" the voices chant
ed. I feared the reproach of my par
ents, as they nodded disapprovingly
over what I imagined was my

drugged-out, sexed-up and over
psyched alter ego.
And as soon as I thought I didn't
want to see their disapproval, they
disappeared or rather, I disap
peared. I was sucked into a vortex,
into cyberspace. I suddenly couldn't
prove that I, or anyone I loved, ex
isted. I had digital evidence of them
I could see my mom's emails and
text messages, see my friends' Face
book pictures and updates and hear
my father's voice on the phone
but none of that was tangible. Be
cause I couldn't see and hear them
in the immediate, because I couldn't
physically feel their presence, they

ceased to be real.
And in a sense both of these
things came true aspects of both
my nightmares manifested them
selves to some degree in my con
scious life this past week.
While 1 was able to pick up the
phone and speak to my mother and
father Sunday morning, the reality
of the distance between New York
and San Francisco set in for the first
time. I couldn't just book a flight
and go home for the weekend, or
even for a week it was too expen
sive. Nor could my parents ideal
ly both of them, along with my little
sister, but even just one of them
fly out to stay with me for a couple
of days. From January through now,
and until June 10 or so, they really
only exist to me through Gmail and
my cellphone we don't even
have Skype working yet.
I'd always boasted to my

friends and to my family that 1
had not yet felt homesick at Stan
ford because I loved my family and
knew we'd all be there for each
other when I returned home in
June, and because Stanford was one
of the places where I was most com
fortable; yet, here I was homesick
for the first time and sad that not
everything was working out as I'd
planned.
And up until this week, I'd felt
like I had the whole New York City-
Stanford thing down that I per
fectly embodied how to pack up,
leave your friends and family, move
2,500 miles across the continent
and live a happy and successful ac
ademic and social life. The whole
"work hard, play hard" mantra
seemed to fit both my identity as a
fast-paced, hardcore, go-get-'em
New Yorker and as a happy, content
and (to use my favorite California
lingo) "chill" Stanford student.
When I was picking schools, my
parents warned that they wouldn't
