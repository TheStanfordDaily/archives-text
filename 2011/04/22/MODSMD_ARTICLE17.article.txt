# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Baby's Got The Bends (Oh No) 
### Kristian Bailey 
Saturday night I had what I can
safely say is the worst dream
I've ever had in my life. I
dreamt that I was falling out of con
trol. That I was becoming the per
son that nearly everyone I told I was
going to school in California feared
I would become: California embod
ied. A sort of hippie-ish (don't think
I am), pansexual (pretty sure I'm
not, though that chair over there is
looking pretty fine...just kidding!)
druggie (your love is my drug; also,
occasionally alcohol) who was into
organics (I hate them), yoga (can't
even touch my toes), bumming
around and surfing on the beach all
day (I can't swim) and psychics (we
can't even understand the past
how can we begin to guess at the fu
ture?). "We knew you wouldn't last!
We knew you couldn't make it so far
away from home!" the voices chant
ed. I feared the reproach of my par
ents, as they nodded disapprovingly
over what I imagined was my

drugged-out, sexed-up and over
psyched alter ego.
And as soon as I thought I didn't
want to see their disapproval, they
disappeared or rather, I disap

into cyberspace. I suddenly couldn't
prove that I, or anyone I loved, ex

I could see my mom's emails and
text messages, see my friends' Face
book pictures and updates and hear
my father's voice on the phone
but none of that was tangible. Be
cause I couldn't see and hear them
in the immediate, because I couldn't
physically feel their presence, they

ceased to be real.
And in a sense both of these
things came true aspects of both
my nightmares manifested them
selves to some degree in my con
scious life this past week.
While 1 was able to pick up the
phone and speak to my mother and
father Sunday morning, the reality
of the distance between New York
and San Francisco set in for the first
time. I couldn't just book a flight
and go home for the weekend, or
even for a week it was too expen
sive. Nor could my parents ideal
ly both of them, along with my little
sister, but even just one of them
fly out to stay with me for a couple
of days. From January through now,
and until June 10 or so, they really
only exist to me through Gmail and
my cellphone we don't even
have Skype working yet.
