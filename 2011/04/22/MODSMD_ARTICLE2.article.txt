## CARD FINDS ITS SWING AGAINST UCLA 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In a battle of aces, sophomore Mark
Appel came out on top Thursday night,
guiding the Stanford baseball team to a 7-4
victory over UCLA.
Buoyed by three Cardinal home runs,
the righthander battled out seven full innings
while only giving up three runs as
Stanford (18-12, 4-6 Pac-10) won its first
conference game in two weeks over the No.
11 Bruins (20-13,9-4).
"[The win] gives us a lot of confidence
going into the weekend," Appel said, following
the win that moved his record to 3-4.
"Especially after we had a tough weekend
last week, we're just hoping to ride this
win into tomorrow and Saturday to give us
a big series win."
The Bruins had star righthander Gerrit
Cole on the mound, who flashed a fastball
that reached up to 98 miles an hour, but the

Cardinal hitters stayed patient and consistently
drove his pitches the opposite

way, setting up two critical home runs.
After freshmen Brian Ragira and

Lonnie Kauppila reached on sin-

gles in the bottom of the second
inning, senior catcher Zach

Jones drilled a home run over

the left field fence to give the

Card a 3-0 lead early on.

Appel gave up
two runs in the

third and an-

other run in

the sixth

that tied

the

game at three, but the Cardinal took a 4-3
lead in the seventh inning when freshman
right fielder Brian Guymon brought
home sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger with his first-ever RBI in a
Stanford uniform.
The Cardinal continued to blast away at
Cole in the 8th inning, as sophomore right
fielder Tyler Gaffney ripped a two-run shot
that gave the Cardinal a 6-3 lead.
The homer also knocked Cole from the
game, an impressive offensive feat against a
pitcher with a 2.22 ERA, three complete
games this season and a resume that makes
him an expected top-five pick in this summer's
MLB Draft.
Third baseman Stephen Piscotty followed
his fellow sophomore's feat with a
home run of his own, blasting the first pitch
from Bruin reliever Mitchell Beacom deep
over the lights in left field to extend the
Stanford lead to 7-3.
UCLA scratched out one more run
when Diekroeger dropped a fly ball with
two outs in the eighth, but junior lefty Chris
Reed came in and put a lid on the Bruins'
chances, striking out three in the final two
innings to secure the Stanford win.
Despite outpitching Cole on Thursday
night, Appel credited his offense with giving
him the support he needed, especially
after losing a 1-0 decision to Oregon State
last Friday.
"I always try to play as if it's a one-run
game, but having those big hits definitely
brings momentum to our side," Appel said.
"I knew they were going to pick me up this
week."
The win stops a five-game Pac-10 losing
streak for Stanford, but despite getting the
win over Cole and snapping the skid, the
most difficult test for the Cardinal might be
yet to come.

Junior righthander Trevor Bauer
takes the hill Friday night for the

Bruins against Stanford jun-

ior righty Jordan Pries, and
the Cardinal offense will
need to continue its hot
