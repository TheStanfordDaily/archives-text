## IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE MEN GEAR UP FOR FINAL TEST VS. CAL 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even as the Stanford men's ten
nis team rides a nine-game winning
streak and is assured a favorable
playoff seed, tomorrow's season fi
nale against Cal has large postseason
implications. The teams are heading
in different directions at the mo
ment, but the Cardinal's positive
momentum and the Golden Bears'
recent downturn could all change
Saturday.
No. 8 Stanford (17-5,4-1 Pac-10)
has been busy in the past month,
winning nine straight matches to

team faced in the early season. No. 14

weeks ago in a loss at No. 22 Washing

get back on the court and would love
nothing more than to deal the Cardi
nal a loss on their home court, where
Stanford has lost just once all season.
Hirshman talked about the
team's tough win in the first match
against Cal earlier this season and
what this weekend's match meant to
the team.
"We went to Cal earlier in the
season and beat them 5-2, which was
a very solid win for us," Hirshman
said. "They brought a bunch of
rowdy fans out there to try to tick us
off, and we took it in stride and won
the match.
"It will be a major test for us to
see where we are heading into the
