## IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM HERE MEN GEAR UP FOR FINAL TEST VS. CAL 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even as the Stanford men's ten
nis team rides a nine-game winning
streak and is assured a favorable
playoff seed, tomorrow's season fi
nale against Cal has large postseason
implications. The teams are heading
in different directions at the mo
ment, but the Cardinal's positive
momentum and the Golden Bears'
recent downturn could all change
Saturday.
No. 8 Stanford (17-5,4-1 Pac-10)
has been busy in the past month,
winning nine straight matches to
jump from 8-5 to 17-5. That being
said, the streak has come against
much weaker competition than the
team faced in the early season. No. 14
Cal will be the highest ranked team
the Cardinal has played since beat
ing then-No. 13 UCLA almost a
month ago.
Senior Greg Hirshman charac
terized the team's attitude as posi

tive, but still cautious.
"Tennis is a fun sport, but it's a
heck of a lot more fun when you're
winning," he said. "I guess you could
say that about any sport. Right now
as we're riding the victory wave it is
easy to have a good time, but you are
always one game away from not en
joying it as much."
Cal (12-6, 3-2) last played two
weeks ago in a loss at No. 22 Washing
ton. The Bears have been itching to
get back on the court and would love
nothing more than to deal the Cardi
nal a loss on their home court, where
Stanford has lost just once all season.
Hirshman talked about the
team's tough win in the first match
against Cal earlier this season and
what this weekend's match meant to
the team.
"We went to Cal earlier in the
season and beat them 5-2, which was
a very solid win for us," Hirshman
said. "They brought a bunch of
rowdy fans out there to try to tick us
off, and we took it in stride and won
the match.
"It will be a major test for us to
see where we are heading into the

NCAA tournament," Hirshman
added. "They're hungry. They actual
ly beat us at home here last year in a
very tight match and winning would
probably be their number one high
light for the season."
Hirshman also emphasized the
opportunity the match presents for
Stanford.
"On the other hand, it would cer
tainly be one of our top highlights to
say that we swept Cal," he said. "It's
going to be a battle of wills, and it's
going to come down to who wants it
more and who's going to take those
extra one or two points to win those
close matches."
Both Stanford and Cal are essen
tially guaranteed bids in the NCAA
tournament regardless of Saturday's
result, but neither coach will rest
their starters or take the match light
ly. This is the season finale for both
teams and with three long weeks be
fore the next team match, Saturday
has important psychological impli

cations for the both teams' attitudes
going into the NCAA tournament.
"We have almost three full weeks
after our Cal match before the
NCAA tournament," Hirshman
said. "And if you're sitting on a loss
for three weeks before the NCAA
tournament, that's not a good feel
ing. On the other hand, if you're sit
ting on a ten-game winning streak
going into the NCAA tournament,
well now that's a pretty cool feeling.
That's what we're up against."
All in all, Saturday's match offers
an opportunity to both teams. For
Cal, it's an opportunity to end the
season on a high note, erasing the
tough loss at Washington earlier this
month.
For Stanford, the match is a
chance is to go into the NCAA tour
nament with loads of confidence.
The team is 9-1 at home and is lucky
in that it gets to host this year's
NCAAs.
Hirshman summed up the senti
ment succinctly: "We play well at
home and we plan to keep it that
way."
