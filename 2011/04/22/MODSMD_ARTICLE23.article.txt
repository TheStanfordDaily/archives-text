# Spain takes its sports seriously
## 
### 
If sports had just one mother tongue and
by sports I mean almost exclusively soccer
it would be Spanish. Tune in to any TV or
radio commentary in that language and
you'll get a constant stream of emotion only
interrupted by the improbably long word "Gol!"
And this extends to the printed press, too. There are
a whole host of newspapers in Spain exclusively
dedicated to sports, and the most distributed of
these, El Marca, is second in total
readership to only one serious nation
al newspaper, El Pais.
The closest comparison I can
think of to this in the U.S. is the week
ly magazine Sports Illustrated, which
lias a total readership of around 23
million, but even that doesn't do jus
tice to the Spanish phenomenon.
Add up the daily readership of the
six major newspapers devoted to
sports in Spain and the result is one
tenth of the population. On any
given day. El Marca has around 50
pages, probably comparable to the
weekly output of Sports Illustrated,
and the sheer number of words that
are written (and read) about sports
in Spain is simply huge.
And don't get me wrong, these
journals are not simply an accompani
ment to those that report the news, or
an equivalent of sports sections taken
out of the serious papers. They're
stand-alone alternatives. Except for
the absence of the topics that usually
dominate the front pages of most
newspapers, everything else is there
weather, lottery results, sudoku,
TV schedules, even editorials and
opinions. And also, perhaps surpris
ingly, politics.
Last Sunday's edition of El Marca
devoted more than a third of its out
put — the first 28 pages, no less
not just to soccer, but to one single
game, El Clasico: Real Madrid vs.
Barcelona. By Wednesday, ahead of
the first Copa del Rey final between
them in over 20 years, the theme con

tinued. A freakish consequence of re
sults and schedules means that by
early May, these two giants of the
sport will have met four times within
three weeks, but even that doesn't ex
plain the excessive coverage. The
truth is that these encounters are far
more than just games of soccer in
Spain.
Though a modern and liberal
country now, it was not that long ago
that Spain was under the yoke of dic
tatorship, and less than a lifetime ago
that families and communities were
torn asunder by civil war. There are
deep wounds and political divisions
that have yet to heal still buried
below the surface. Under the reign of
Franco, Real Madrid, based in the
Spanish capital, was seen as the team
that represented his centralist poli
tics, and Barcelona, located far away
in Catalunya, as the alternative.
Whether or not he actively aided
Madrid a divisive topic itself
the result was that the conservative
elements in society associated them
selves with that team, and the more
liberal sections with their rivals. To
some extent, supporting Barcelona
was the only way to safely show dis
sent against the dictatorship.
Though his death and Spain's
transition to democracy was over
thirty years ago, a division in society
remains. When it comes to a normal
game, most people support their
local team whatever that might be
but when it comes to El Clasico,
you are either with Madrid or with
Barca. The sports newspapers them
selves are no different; though they
naturally aim for journalistic objec
tivity, there is a strong tendency to
focus either on one or the other of
these two clubs. Just looking at which

publication is available to read in any
bar or cafe can be enough to let you
know which team that establishment
sides with.

Last Saturday, Barcelona all but
confirmed its place at the top of La
Liga with a tie against Real Madrid
in the first of a four-match season se
ries, although it was the least impor
tant of the games. It was the return
leg of a game played back in Decem
ber in which Barca gave Madrid a
punishing 5-0 lesson, but apart from
offering an opportunity to regain
some respect, there was never any re
alistic chance of it making much of an
impact on the league. On Wednes
day, Madrid evened the score a bit,
narrowly winning the Copa del Rey
1-0 on a Ronaldo header in extra
time, thereby ensuring it too will
walk away from the season with a
trophy. But there is still some serious
silver up for grabs; in the upcoming
two games they will square off
against each other in the Champions
League semi-finals
Although you probably won't
find any of the Spanish sports papers
available anywhere around campus,
the good news is that these games
will be played at reasonably sociable
hours for California (around
lunchtime), so if you can find your
self a TV hooked up to FX or Fox
you should be able to catch the ac
tion live. And if you're feeling brave,
and have had time to brush up on
your Spanish, you can always tune in
to Fox Deportes for the full Latin ex
perience.

pages, probably comparable to the
weekly output of Sports Illustrated,
and the sheer number of words that
are written (and read) about sports
in Spain is simply huge.
And don't get me wrong, these
journals are not simply an accompani
ment to those that report the news, or
an equivalent of sports sections taken
out of the serious papers. They're
stand-alone alternatives. Except for
the absence of the topics that usually
dominate the front pages of most
newspapers, everything else is there
weather, lottery results, sudoku,
TV schedules, even editorials and
opinions. And also, perhaps surpris
ingly, politics.
Last Sunday's edition of El Marca
devoted more than a third of its out
put — the first 28 pages, no less
not just to soccer, but to one single
game, El Clasico: Real Madrid vs.
Barcelona. By Wednesday, ahead of
the first Copa del Rey final between
them in over 20 years, the theme con

tinued. A freakish consequence of re
sults and schedules means that by
early May, these two giants of the
sport will have met four times within
three weeks, but even that doesn't ex
plain the excessive coverage. The
truth is that these encounters are far
more than just games of soccer in
Spain.
Though a modern and liberal
country now, it was not that long ago
that Spain was under the yoke of dic
tatorship, and less than a lifetime ago
that families and communities were
torn asunder by civil war. There are
deep wounds and political divisions
that have yet to heal still buried
below the surface. Under the reign of
Franco, Real Madrid, based in the
Spanish capital, was seen as the team
that represented his centralist poli
tics, and Barcelona, located far away
in Catalunya, as the alternative.
Whether or not he actively aided
Madrid a divisive topic itself
the result was that the conservative
elements in society associated them
selves with that team, and the more
liberal sections with their rivals. To
some extent, supporting Barcelona
was the only way to safely show dis
sent against the dictatorship.
Though his death and Spain's
transition to democracy was over
thirty years ago, a division in society
remains. When it comes to a normal
game, most people support their
local team whatever that might be
but when it comes to El Clasico,
you are either with Madrid or with
Barca. The sports newspapers them
selves are no different; though they
naturally aim for journalistic objec
tivity, there is a strong tendency to
focus either on one or the other of
these two clubs. Just looking at which

publication is available to read in any
bar or cafe can be enough to let you
know which team that establishment
sides with.

Last Saturday, Barcelona all but
confirmed its place at the top of La
Liga with a tie against Real Madrid
in the first of a four-match season se
ries, although it was the least impor
tant of the games. It was the return
leg of a game played back in Decem
ber in which Barca gave Madrid a
punishing 5-0 lesson, but apart from
offering an opportunity to regain
some respect, there was never any re
alistic chance of it making much of an
impact on the league. On Wednes
day, Madrid evened the score a bit,
narrowly winning the Copa del Rey
1-0 on a Ronaldo header in extra
time, thereby ensuring it too will
walk away from the season with a
trophy. But there is still some serious
silver up for grabs; in the upcoming
two games they will square off
against each other in the Champions
League semi-finals
Although you probably won't
find any of the Spanish sports papers
available anywhere around campus,
the good news is that these games
will be played at reasonably sociable
hours for California (around
lunchtime), so if you can find your
self a TV hooked up to FX or Fox
you should be able to catch the ac
tion live. And if you're feeling brave,
and have had time to brush up on
your Spanish, you can always tune in
to Fox Deportes for the full Latin ex
perience.
