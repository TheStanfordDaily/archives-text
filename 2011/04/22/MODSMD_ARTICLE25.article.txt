### REBECCA HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team topped off an undefeated
MPSF season with a 21-9 victory
over UC-Davis on Wednesday, im
proving its record to 6-0. Even
though the final margin of victory
was impressive, the win didn't come
easily for the Cardinal. Stanford re
ally struggled to gain control of the
game Davis jumped out to a
quick 3-0 lead and led 6-5 at the
18:33 mark of the first half before
Stanford's attack began to wear on
the Aggies.
Senior midfielder Karen Nesbit
set the tone when she scored at the
17:18 mark off of a free position shot
and started an eight-goal run for the
Cardinal that included seven differ
ent goal scorers. Although the be
ginning of the first half was shaky,
Stanford put its stamp on the match
by halftime and held a 13-7 lead.
The Cardinal outshot Davis 19-
16 in the first half and led in draw
controls by 12 it would finish
with a 19-13 advantage in draw con
trols and outshoot the Aggies by
five.
At the start of the second half,
Stanford went on another run to
take away all hopes of a comeback
by Davis. The Cardinal scored six
straight goals and eight of the next
10 to build its lead to 21-9.
The Stanford attack was very
balanced 10 different players
scored for the Card. Junior Cather
ine Swanson moved up from de
fense in the second half to join sen
ior Leslie Foard and sophomore
Jacqueline Candelaria with hat
tricks for the match. Senior Lauren
Schmidt also had a nice game as she
racked up a game-high four goals.
Seniors Sarah Flynn and Maggie
Sachs also had multiple goals.
The Cardinal had already

clinched the No. 1 seed in the up
coming MPSF tournament, but with
Wednesday's win it secured an un
defeated season as champion of the
conference.
This weekend, Stanford heads
off to Chicago for its final non-con

ference match against No. 5 North
western University. The Cardinal
plays Northwestern on Easter Sun
day at 11 a.m.
