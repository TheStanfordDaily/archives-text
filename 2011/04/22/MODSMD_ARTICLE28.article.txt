Stanford this Monday to talk about his media ra i
and if you're anything like Intermission, you're^^S^^^^^^^^B
your pants in excitement. To prep for the bigW '
at JGL's greatest hits so far. ' 1 '

Arthur, "Inception"
Chris Nolan's mind-bending blockbuster erased any doubts JGL
wasn't ready for the big leagues. Let's hope he's equally awesome in
Nolan's "The Dark Knight Rises."

Tommy Solomon, "3rd Rock From
The Sun"
Oh poor little Tommy the oldest and most intelligent of the aliens
forced into the hormonal body of a teenage boy. If adolescence is
already awkward, try bringing chicks back to a home full of adults
who aren't even from the same planet.

Tom Hansen, "(500) Days of
Summer"
"(500) Days of Summer" = the point in which JGL transforms from
likable child star (Intermission loves "Angels in the Outfield") into
object of shameless desire. If it helps, Intermission also completely
misinterpreted the ending of "The Graduate."

Cameron James, "10 Things I Hate
About You"
While Heath Ledger stole our hearts crooning some Frankie Valli,
JGL still won us over as Cameron, the adorkable new kid hopelessly
devoted to Bianca (Larisa Oleynik).

Brendan Frye, "Brick"
The oft-overlooked gem is a modern take on film-noir starring JGL
as a high-school gumshoe trying to solve the murder of his ex-girl
friend.
