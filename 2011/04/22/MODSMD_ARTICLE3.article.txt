## No. 1 Card takes on top youth team 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After completing its regular season as the
only undefeated Division I women's tennis
team in the nation, Stanford is set to host the
USTA Junior National Team in an exhibition
match this Friday. The No. 1 Cardinal
knocked off No. 9 Cal by the score of 5-2 last
Saturday to end the season with its third Pac-10
title in the last four years.
The Cardinal (23-0, 8-0 Pac-10) will be
taking on some of the nation's top junior
players this coming weekend to bridge the
gap between regular season dual matches
and the Pac-10 Individual Championships
later this month. Freshman Nicole Gibbs,
who was crowned Pac-10 Player of the Week
for the week of April 11-17, described the intensity
that accompanies the exhibition
match, which will most likely consist of four
doubles matches and eight singles matches.
"Many of the girls on the [USTA Junior
National Team] are very, very good," she
said. "Their No. 1 player beat me about two
years ago in a pro tournament we were both
playing in, and I trained with two of their
mid-line girls at a USTA facility in LA for
years."

Individually ranked No. 12 in the country,
Gibbs recorded the most total victories for
the Cardinal, finishing the regular season
with a final record of 34-4 and going 22-0 in
duals. She joined senior Hilary Barte and
sophomore Mallory Burdette in being the
third Stanford women's player to be honored with
Pac-10 Player of the Week this season. Gibbs herself
faced the difficult choice between attending
college and entering the pro tour she explains
that the USTA's stance toward collegiate tennis
has changed recently.

"The USTA has been advocating more and
more that girls go to college before they try out the
pro circuit," she said. "It's good for their younger
girls to see what a tennis college match is like, es
pecially in deciding if they are playing collegiate
tennis and where."

This exhibition match will provide the Stanford
community with an equally unique opportunity.
"It's a cool occasion for spectators to see some
of the nation's most competitive players, many of
whom might be interested in Stanford at least at a
preliminary level," said Gibbs, who also added that
this match will be a grounds for players, coaches,
fans and potential recruits to all connect.
The USTA Junior National Team has recently
played exhibitions against other programs such as
University of Miami, University of Florida and
Cal.

Stanford will also use this exhibition match to
remain competitively sharp and work on elements
of the game that need tweaking before it enters the
Pac-10 Individual Championships from April 28-
May 1 in Ojai, Calif. The players are already look
ing to backup their regular season title with indi
vidual success.
"I want to emphasize my focus on the simple
things in Pac-lOs footwork, acceleration on my
forehand, staying low," Gibbs said. "I hopefully
will go deep and do damage, but the ultimate goal
will be to get my competitive game exactly where
I want it for NCAAs."
She said that the Pac-10 tournament is yet an
other chance for many of the players to get a full
tune-up before entering the grand finale the
NCAA tournament. Her ultimate goal, however, is
to gain confidence as she enters her first collegiate
post season.
The Cardinal seems to be in good position en
tering the NCAA tournament, which will be held
in May on the Farm. Potentially the No. 1 seed,
Stanford has captured straight 179 home victories,
an NCAA record.
But before the Cardinal can completely focus
all attention on the postseason, it faces the USTA
Junior All-Star Team at Taube Tennis Stadium
today at 1:30 p.m.
