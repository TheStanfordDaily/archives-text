On Tuesday, Sony Network Entertainment
pitched a tent behind the Sony Styles store
at the Stanford Shopping Center to pro
mote their new music service "Music Unlimited
powered by Qriocity" which combines elements
of music subscription services like Rhapsody and
other cloud-based streaming options like Lala and
Grooveshark. Users can upload their personal
music libraries to the service and access it anywhere
along with over six million songs, depending on the
package.
Despite the abundance of sleek technology and
cool giveaways, the main attraction was an intimate
performance by G. Love & Special Sauce. The Philly
based band has been around since the early 90s,
spreading its unique brand of alternative bluesy hip
hop. G. Love (otherwise known as Garrett Dutton)

took the stage first with an acoustic guitar and his
trademark harmonica before being joined by his
Special Sauce backing band.
Highlights included a groovier, revitalized cover
of Paul Simon's "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" off
their latest record "Fixin' to Die" and an extra dirty
version of G. Love classic "Booty Call." String bassist
Timo Shanko won over the crowd with his zealous
solos and even more enthusiastic faces.
Along with a solid, entertaining show, G. Love
should also be given props for managing to pull off a
denim-on-denim shirt-pant combo without looking
like a total idiot. Many men have tried, few have suc
ceeded.
