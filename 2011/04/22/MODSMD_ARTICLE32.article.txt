Blackstage Theater
Company has done it
again with their pro
duction of "Fabulation," a
play about love, family and
lies.
Written by renowned
playwright Lynn Nottage,
"Fabulation, or the Re-
Education of Undine" tells
the story of a successful New
York publicist's return to her
roots.
It's an incredibly timely
story in this era of decreas
ing support for social servic
es. As a privileged Stanford
student, I find it a necessary
wake-up call to watch as
Undine's sense of entitle
ment collides with the gov
ernment institutions that are
ostensibly meant to support
Americans. Instead of get
ting what she wants, she gets
a firsthand understanding of
the ways in which the sys
tem works against low
income people, particularly
people of color. Nottage
offers an original perspective
on the intersections of class
and race by turning her
bourgeois protagonist into
an unmarried, unemployed,
pregnant black woman
forced to confront the lies
she told to distance herself

from that reality.
'Tabulation" starts
strong and fast, and it keeps
you engaged all the way
through. It's a hilarious
show Nottage's talent
shines through her witty
dialogue and surprising plot
twists. Saroya Whatley' 11
delivers an incredible per
formance as Undine, the
story's protagonist. Whatley
is supported by a stellar cast
in 'Tabulation," featuring
particularly exciting per
formances from Yvorn
"Doc" Aswad 'll and Justin
Michael Reed'lo.
The play mediates on
the importance of remem
bering one's roots, a theme
that is "extremely personal"
to Jackson. "I don't know
what your story is or how
that compares to the one
you've been telling other
folk," he writes, "but, no
matter where you've come
from, or where you are right
now, your story is worth
telling, and don't you dare
forget it!"
"Fabulation" runs through
Saturday.
