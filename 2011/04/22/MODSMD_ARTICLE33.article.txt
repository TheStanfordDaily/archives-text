## CATCHING UP WITH IKE 
### – evie DANFORTH contact evie: erdanfor@stan 
It's a little after 11:30 a.m. on a drizzly
Sunday, not exactly go-time for academ
ic buildings here on campus. But in the
Huang Engineering Center, a strange hodge
podge of people are queuing up around a
plastic countertop families with young
kids, unshaven If at boys in ragged sweat
pants squinting in the fluorescent lighting,
mousy looking chemical engineers. And the
10-deep line is probably the shortest it'll be
all day. Some people go to church on
Sunday mornings, but everyone here has
come to worship at the altar of Ike's Place,
the sandwich shop that opened in the engi
neering center this past fall.
Recently, I met up with the iiber popu
lar sandwich place's eponymous owner, Ike
Shaledeh, to find out a little bit more about
a restaurant famously touted as actually too
popular for its own good. By the time Ike's
opened on campus, it had already attained a
sort of legendary status in the Bay Area food
scene. The original Ike's location, in San
Francisco's Mission District, boasts a stag
gering 3,164 Yelp reviews most of which
range from gushing ("SOOOO good") to
fanatical ("It was better than sex!!"). In fact,
the original Ike's became so popular it was
forced to shut down after homeowners
nearby complained about the mobs that
would wait outside for hours at a time on
weekend afternoons just to buy a sandwich,
turning the stretch of sidewalk outside the

small storefront into a bacchanal street fair
during mealtimes.
It's a problem that continues to plague
Shaledeh even here on campus. Every time a
Stanford student has raved to me about one
of his sandwiches, they've also had to throw
in that you need to budget at least two hours
to get one because of the wait.
But while Ike admits that the insane
popularity of his franchise contributes to the
line, he also says the care that goes into mak
ing each sandwich explains a large part of
the wait.
"The wait naturally gets long during
peak hours," he explained. "But at Subway,
you can get a sandwich in 10 minutes. That
isn't what we're doing here." He's also fond
of saying that an Ike's sandwich is the
antithesis of a Big Mac they're intensely
customizable and made from scratch each
time.
To help ease the wait, Ike's recently
came out with an iPhone app that allows
customers to order sandwiches in advance
and then stop by the store to pick them up
at an assigned time. It's unclear if the iPhone
app is actually an effective way to score an
Ike's sandwich in under 30 minutes, but it's
an innovative touch nonetheless.

The iPhone app also reflects Ike's deep

commitment to brand promotion. Ike
Shaledeh may make widely acclaimed sand
wiches, but the appeal of Ike's Place runs
beyond the culinary offerings themselves.
Walking with Ike through San Francisco, I
was surprised by the number of people who
stopped and waved at him. The man him
self has become a piece of San Francisco
and now, with the opening of the Stanford
and Redwood Shores locations, Bay Area
lore. When his beloved San Francisco Giants
(whose players are the namesakes for many
sandwiches on the menu) miraculously
made it to the World Series this past year, Ike
posted an appeal on his website asking for
tickets to the games in exchange for a sand
wich named after the donor; people clam
ored at the chance to become a small part of
his sandwich mythology. Perhaps most
excitingly, Ike just started shooting the pilot
for a reality TV series based on his burgeon
ing sandwich empire. Although he has yet to
obtain the rights to film at his Stanford loca
tion, the cameras will be following Ike and
his team in the new San Francisco store as
they come up with new sandwich ideas and
struggle to keep pace with the hungry mass
es' insatiable demand.

"It's a polarizing business," he
explained, referencing the controversy over
his sandwiches' popularity that inevitably
boils up in residential areas. "And there's
actually a lot of drama" in the kitchen. Still,
he tries to keep a low-key perspective about
the whole experience "I still don't think
I'm a celebrity. I make sandwiches," he said
emphatically. "I'm just a guy who started a
business that people like."
Suggesting that a busy Stanford student
set aside two hours in the pursuit of a food
item their mom used to pack into a Power
Rangers lunchbox every day before kinder
garten isn't exacdy an intuitive move. But
having been to Ike's pretty regularly since its
opening on campus, I find myself forced to
repeat the party line: the wait really doesn't
matter, these sandwiches are just so good.
And you never know—maybe Ike will give
you a cameo on his new reality show.
