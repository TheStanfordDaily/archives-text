## COACHELL 
### ELLEN HUET MARISA LANDICHO RYAN MAC 
FRIDAY

After 2010, when festival organizers
found out very quickly that their eyes
were bigger than their stomachs,
201 l_s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
arrived on Friday with few of the logistical

nightmares that had become standard at past
installments of the desert get-together. With
Goldenvoice and Co. realizing that less really is
more, Coachellites were able to enjoy day one
relatively hassle free. Crowds mere manageable,
traffic was bearable and parking was orderly.
Cell phones actually worked. And the new chipcarrying
wristbands were surprisingly efficient.
After all, with the elaborate preparations
leading up to this year's event, from the dressing
and personalized shipping of wristbands to the
addition of a sixth stage, the 12th edition of the
Coachella Music Festival may not have been big
ger, but it certainly was better, at least from
Fridays experiences. With the source of most of
the problems the crowd levels kept at bay,
day one will be remembered as all Coachella
opening days should be: a 12-hour ribbon-cut
ting to a desert oasis that had fans running
across the polo fields from Odd Future to
Lauryn Hill, soaking in mist and ear-slamming
bass at the Do Laß or dancing the night away at
Cut Copy. This was the festival experience we'd
been waiting for. Welcome to Coachella.

CEE LO GREEN

Cee Lo Green was a full half hour late, and
he was pissed about it. "Sorry guys, I just land
ed," he shouted to the audience. "We only have
20 minutes left still wanna party with me?"
And with that, his all-girl backing band started
pumping out an instrumental cover of Black
Sabbath's "Iron Man." Green, who later reiterat
ed, "I'm fucking pissed off" presumably at his
set time faced an audience of festival-goers
who were also fucking pissed off that his set had
been shortened. His set was sprinkled with quips
like, "Hope y'all are high 'cause I'm completely
sober, and it's a bummer." Green ran through a
couple other Gnarls Barkley songs, and before
hitting the requisite "Fuck You," he encouraged

audience members to "put your middle fin
gers in the air" and they willingly obliged.
His performance was off during the short

set, with him pacing around and singing
without much verve. Just as he seemed to
hit his groove, with the opening chords

to Journey s "Don't Stop Believing"
the plug was pulled. Sound went

off exactly when his set
was scheduled to end,
and though the audience
cheered, Cee Lo was out.

KELE OKEREKE

Laying in the grass
behind the Gobi Stage
before the show, Kele

Okereke looked more tired
spectator than Coachella per
former. Dressed leisurely in

sport shorts and a tank top, he
only rose from his catnap min
utes before his 7 p.m. set time,

clutching a bottle of Jagermeister as

he casually approached the stage. Stepping
into the spotlight, Kele tapped into energy
reserves not usually expended while leading Bloc
Party and burst into "Walk Tall" and "On the
Lam" from his debut solo album "The Boxer." "As
some of you may know, I have another band,"
Okereke said, grinning. "We're called the Black
Eyed Peas." Transitioning from solo cuts to Bloc
Party material, Okereke and his backing band
played a flowing and revamped Bloc Party med
ley of "Blue Light," "The Prayer" and "One More
Chance," as the lead singer danced across the
stage, losing hat and microphone stand in the
process. And given his last appearance at the fes
tival with Bloc Party was five years ago, Okereke
recalled his band's brightest times as he closed
with "This Modern Love" and the dance-ready
"Flux" to end a memorable Coachella return.

CRYSTAL CASTLES
In a day full of male divas (see: Ariel Pink
and Cee Lo Green), Alice Glass cut the bullshit.
Playing with a broken ankle, which had been
mangled in an accident at a show in Tokyo in
June, the Crystal Castles frontwoman not only
proceeded to perform at the Outdoor Theatre,

but announced her presence by stage-diving into
the crowd during "Baptism," ankle boot and all.
Shocking, sadistic but always professional, Glass
hopped, crawled and crutched around stage as
she screamed into the mic and quickly cemented
her place as the Kerri Strug of this year's music
festival. Along with bandmate Ethan Kath, Glass
made the Crystal Castles set an unforgettable
assault on the eyes and ears of fans with
"Vietnam" and "Not In Love" proving to be
highlights of the 50-minute set. As the band
ended on "Untrust Us," Glass ended her set right
where she started: riding the outstretched arms
of fans, mic in hand and broken ankle aloft.

THE BLACK KEYS
The Black Keys, who last graced the desert
stage in 2009, were all business on Friday night.
The only glitch was on the festival organizers'
side the screens on the side of the main stage
were out for the first 15 minutes of the set. The
band, framed in front of a giant shimmering
disco ball, ran systematically through both their
best radio hits ("Tighten Up" and "Howlin' For

You") plus some of their highlights from
"Brothers," including "Next Girl" and "Ten Cent
Pistol." Dan Auerbach stretched "I'll Be Your
Man" out to its limit, repeating the title line over
and over and pulling the audience with him.
They closed with "I Got Mine" and proved that
a band doesn't have to pull crazy stunts to be a
memorable act this weekend.

ROBYN
Sustaining America's love affair with
Scandinavian musicians, Swedish pop singer
Robyn sashayed through her nighttime slot,
risking intermediate whiplash as her blond head
cut side to side. She launched into her set,
countdown and blastoff effects included, with a
DJ'ed-out version of "Fembot" and followed
with a club-worthy set of electropop-sawy
gems. It was a shame, though, that the video
screens were down for the first half of her per
formance, as her shuffling, flash-dance choreog
raphy was a must-see for the day. She admirably
brought "Body Talk" to life, emoting her heart
out with album single and chick-flick anthem
