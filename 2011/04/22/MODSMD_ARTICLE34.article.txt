## COACHELL 
### ELLEN HUET MARISA LANDICHO RYAN MAC 
FRIDAY

After 2010, when festival organizers
found out very quickly that their eyes
were bigger than their stomachs,
201 l_s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival
arrived on Friday with few of the logistical

nightmares that had become standard at past
installments of the desert get-together. With
Goldenvoice and Co. realizing that less really is
more, Coachellites were able to enjoy day one
relatively hassle free. Crowds mere manageable,
traffic was bearable and parking was orderly.
Cell phones actually worked. And the new chipcarrying
wristbands were surprisingly efficient.
After all, with the elaborate preparations
leading up to this year's event, from the dressing
and personalized shipping of wristbands to the
addition of a sixth stage, the 12th edition of the
Coachella Music Festival may not have been big
ger, but it certainly was better, at least from
Fridays experiences. With the source of most of
the problems the crowd levels kept at bay,
day one will be remembered as all Coachella
opening days should be: a 12-hour ribbon-cut
ting to a desert oasis that had fans running
across the polo fields from Odd Future to
Lauryn Hill, soaking in mist and ear-slamming
bass at the Do Laß or dancing the night away at
Cut Copy. This was the festival experience we'd
been waiting for. Welcome to Coachella.

CEE LO GREEN

Cee Lo Green was a full half hour late, and
he was pissed about it. "Sorry guys, I just land
ed," he shouted to the audience. "We only have
20 minutes left still wanna party with me?"
And with that, his all-girl backing band started
pumping out an instrumental cover of Black
Sabbath's "Iron Man." Green, who later reiterat
ed, "I'm fucking pissed off" presumably at his
set time faced an audience of festival-goers
who were also fucking pissed off that his set had
been shortened. His set was sprinkled with quips
like, "Hope y'all are high 'cause I'm completely
sober, and it's a bummer." Green ran through a
couple other Gnarls Barkley songs, and before
hitting the requisite "Fuck You," he encouraged

audience members to "put your middle fin
gers in the air" and they willingly obliged.
His performance was off during the short

set, with him pacing around and singing
without much verve. Just as he seemed to
hit his groove, with the opening chords

to Journey s "Don't Stop Believing"
the plug was pulled. Sound went

off exactly when his set
was scheduled to end,
and though the audience
cheered, Cee Lo was out.

KELE OKEREKE

Laying in the grass
behind the Gobi Stage
before the show, Kele

Okereke looked more tired
spectator than Coachella per
former. Dressed leisurely in

sport shorts and a tank top, he
only rose from his catnap min
utes before his 7 p.m. set time,

clutching a bottle of Jagermeister as

he casually approached the stage. Stepping
into the spotlight, Kele tapped into energy
reserves not usually expended while leading Bloc
Party and burst into "Walk Tall" and "On the
Lam" from his debut solo album "The Boxer." "As
some of you may know, I have another band,"
Okereke said, grinning. "We're called the Black
Eyed Peas." Transitioning from solo cuts to Bloc
Party material, Okereke and his backing band
played a flowing and revamped Bloc Party med
ley of "Blue Light," "The Prayer" and "One More
Chance," as the lead singer danced across the
stage, losing hat and microphone stand in the
process. And given his last appearance at the fes
tival with Bloc Party was five years ago, Okereke
recalled his band's brightest times as he closed
with "This Modern Love" and the dance-ready
"Flux" to end a memorable Coachella return.

CRYSTAL CASTLES
In a day full of male divas (see: Ariel Pink
and Cee Lo Green), Alice Glass cut the bullshit.
Playing with a broken ankle, which had been
mangled in an accident at a show in Tokyo in
June, the Crystal Castles frontwoman not only
proceeded to perform at the Outdoor Theatre,

but announced her presence by stage-diving into
the crowd during "Baptism," ankle boot and all.
Shocking, sadistic but always professional, Glass
hopped, crawled and crutched around stage as
she screamed into the mic and quickly cemented
her place as the Kerri Strug of this year's music
festival. Along with bandmate Ethan Kath, Glass
made the Crystal Castles set an unforgettable
assault on the eyes and ears of fans with
"Vietnam" and "Not In Love" proving to be
highlights of the 50-minute set. As the band
ended on "Untrust Us," Glass ended her set right
where she started: riding the outstretched arms
of fans, mic in hand and broken ankle aloft.

THE BLACK KEYS
The Black Keys, who last graced the desert
stage in 2009, were all business on Friday night.
The only glitch was on the festival organizers'
side the screens on the side of the main stage
were out for the first 15 minutes of the set. The
band, framed in front of a giant shimmering
disco ball, ran systematically through both their
best radio hits ("Tighten Up" and "Howlin' For

You") plus some of their highlights from
"Brothers," including "Next Girl" and "Ten Cent
Pistol." Dan Auerbach stretched "I'll Be Your
Man" out to its limit, repeating the title line over
and over and pulling the audience with him.
They closed with "I Got Mine" and proved that
a band doesn't have to pull crazy stunts to be a
memorable act this weekend.

ROBYN
Sustaining America's love affair with
Scandinavian musicians, Swedish pop singer
Robyn sashayed through her nighttime slot,
risking intermediate whiplash as her blond head
cut side to side. She launched into her set,
countdown and blastoff effects included, with a
DJ'ed-out version of "Fembot" and followed
with a club-worthy set of electropop-sawy
gems. It was a shame, though, that the video
screens were down for the first half of her per
formance, as her shuffling, flash-dance choreog
raphy was a must-see for the day. She admirably
brought "Body Talk" to life, emoting her heart
out with album single and chick-flick anthem

SATURDAY

After Friday's dazzling displays and
painless navigations, we knew the
other shoe had to drop on Saturday.
No, it wasn't the volcano of last year, but it
might as well have been during the face-melt
ing heat of the afternoon. The sun became the
nemesis of Coachella day two, turning up the
heat to a slow broil for the hungover and

clothes-less masses. Brains were scrambled for
the festival hump day — one woman "mentally
altered on substances" fell off the Ferris wheel
but the day still had its shining moments.

CULTS

With plenty of questions surrounding the
volume of Cults' musical arsenal on Saturday,
the New York-based band didn't really answer
critics who thought their appearance at
Coachella might have been a bit premature.
Without a full album to play from, Cults was
particularly pragmatic in its approach to its
performance, enduring a long sound check that
ate into the band's scheduled start time. But
fans did not embrace the savvy performance
move and grew agitated as the wait grew longer
and the heat rose under the tent. When Cults
finally arrived on stage for the performance, the
band was particularly nervy, flustered by the
fast-paced Coachella atmosphere into mistakes
as simple as forgetting to turn on their guitars.
As the band settled, however, Madeline Follin
began to find her groove, swaying to the heavy
bassline as she crooned "You Know What I
Mean." "Most Wanted" proved another hit,
with the crowd taking kindly to the catchy key
board lines, but it was "Go Outside" that the
Gobi masses were waiting for. With tempera
tures rising above three digits, the song's title
may not have been the best advice as Cults fin
ished 10 minutes early, sending the crowd into
the baking sun.

BRIGHT EYES

Bright Eyes caught the dusk of the day,
playing as the sun sank below the palm trees.
With bangs down to his lips and a dark red
plaid shirt, Conor Oberst whipped his hair
back and forth like Willow Smith as he rocked
through his opener, "Jejeune Stars," from this
February's "The People's Key," followed by hits
from past albums "Bowl of Oranges" and "Take
It Easy." He chatted with the audience casually,
dedicating "We Are Nowhere and It's Now" to
"anyone who got lost" on their way to

Coachella and "just ended up here." Despite the
somber nature of the lyrics, Oberst hammed
up his stage presence with just enough glee,
playing with his poetic lyrics' delivery and
going absolutely nuts on "Lover." The set ended
with "Road to Joy," with a crowd of hands up in
the air, singing to each other about being wide
awake it's morning.

MUMFORD AND SONS

To quote one of our own, people went "bat
shit crazy" during Mumford and Sons. Perhaps
it was a result of the full moon that, when fea
tured on the main stage screens before the set,
incited the impatient audience to a crowd full of
wolf howls. But when Marcus Mumford and
company took stage, all howling ceased and
attention was on them. Launching into "Sigh No
More," the quartet stretched their slow, four-part
harmonies into tight musical suspense then col
lapsed into a banjo-driven frenzy with each
song. Keyboardist Ben Lovett, in particular, was
having the time of his life, literally jumping in
the air while keeping his hands glued to the key
board. Banjo man Winston Marshall and
Mumford faced off for the cutesy 6/8 opener to
"Roll Away Your Stone," and the band debuted
two new songs, "Lover's Eyes" and "Lovers of the
Light" someone was obviously feeling a bit
romantic in the writing process. Mumford, who
played bass drum while standing upright on ear
lier songs, switched to the drumset for the sec
ond new song and to mandolin for "Winter
Winds." The band bashfully announced that
Coachella was "by far the biggest gig we've
done," but in closing with "The Cave," they
proved they knew exacdy how to handle the

West Coast's largest stage.

ARCADE FIRE

Arcade Fire's audience stretched beyond
the farthest sound tower of the main stage.
The crowd, all on its feet, watched eagerly as
the set opened with a video about the Month
of May leading into the band's song of sim
ilar name, and meshed seamlessly into
"Rebellion (Lies)." Will Butler, the frontman's
brother (known to many as the crazy drum
man), lived up to his reputation on every song,
pounding the drum with such vigor that
shoulder dislocation seemed imminent. Regine
Chassange glowed on numbers like "Haiti,"
dancing around in a gold-foil dress when not
at the mic. The band, focusing on tracks from
"The Suburbs" but also venturing back to
"Funeral" with songs like "Crown of Love,"
came to a culmination at the end of the set
with "Wake Up," in which audience participa
tion was probably at its peak for the day. As the
crowd swayed and sang along to the wordless
chorus, more than a hundred bike tire-sized
white beach balls dropped from the stage,
lighting up the audience as they flashed differ
ent colors and patterns. After a brief wait, the
band returned for an encore "Ready to
Start," "Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)" and
"Sprawl II" before closing out the night,

sending audience members home with glow
ing inflatable lanterns on the long walk back to
campgrounds and parking lots.

SUNDAY

If Saturday was dominated by heat,
Sunday brought the winds. Desert breezes
took some steroids for the festival's clos
ing day, and by evening, gusty winds cooled
down the grateful crowds as they took pic
ture after picture of the day's massively
beautiful sunset: a red, glowing cloud back
drop as the Ferris wheel, palm trees and bal
loon chains arched across the sky.
The day's lineup also breezed through a
variety of genres, featuring acts as different
from one another as Jimmy Eat World and
Bloody Beetroots. By the end of the week
end, campers' hair and bodies were painted
and airbrushed beyond recognition, feet
were sore and ears were ringing. But once
Kanye's last note echoed across the polo
grounds, winds once again swept the
crowds out and away, back from whence
they came.

DUCK SAUCE

A migration was in the air as crowds
took the long walk together toward the far
back Sahara tent for Duck Sauce, whose act
filled the biggest tent and spilled out beyond
its edges. Dwarfed by the giant inflatable
duck on stage, duo A-Trak and Armand van
Helden pumped through hits like the requi
site "Barbra Streisand" but also a "Big Bad
Wolf" track that A-Trak has been floating in
sets elsewhere for a couple months.

- EH

RATATAT

If the glimmering ceiling of the tent (a
new and highly welcome addition to the
venue) was too much for crowds, Ratatat
took over the migration as soon as Duck
Sauce ended, drawing crowds into their
wordless but stunning beats. Tracks like
"Wildcat" and "Shempi" were cast in front
of a shimmering backdrop of bizarre videos
birds, smiling faces, colorful skulls,
scenes from "Predator." Mike Stroud ripped
out incendiary improvs on his guitar during
and in between songs, culminating with

Festival in Indio, California, Saturday, April 16 2011.
"Seventeen Years" and leaving the
crowd moved into wordlessness.

THE STROKES

The last time The Strokes played
at Coachella as a band, its members
were still in their 20s, enjoying the

rise of then buzz album "Is This It?"
and reveling in the "saviors of rock"
label that comes with the territory of
rapid acceleration. But that was 2002.
Nine years ago. Since then, The
Strokes' ascent has only been
matched by their burnout, proof that
a business that is always looking for
heroes can dehumanize, dull and

deaden even New York City's finest.
Since then, it's been a process of dis
covery and individual exploration, a
time which has yielded solo acts,
families and, perhaps most impor
tantly, the desire to save The Strokes
as we know it. The quintet's show at
Coachella on Sunday was a testament
to that desire, the latest step in the

band's slow ascent to the prowess
they enjoyed after their 2001 debut.
Opening with "I Can't Win,"
The Strokes recalled the best of

times on Sunday night, mixing in
new release "Angles" with a plethora
of songs from across their four
album discography. With

Casablancas stoic if not coolly apa
thetic, the rest of the band fell into
place. Fab Moretti was clean on the
drums, Nikolai Fraiture's bass could
be heard from the outskirts of the
grounds and Albert Hammond Jr.
and Nick Valensi traded guitar
exchanges that were classic Strokes.
For the most part, the new material
fit in with ease. "Undercover of

Darkness" drove the crowd into a
DFA 1979-esque crush, while "NYC
Cops" found a place in the hearts

and ears of the most dedicated fans

as well as Dave Chappelle and
Erykah Badu, who watched from the
front. Between songs, Casablancas,
sporting a white baseball cap and his
trademark sunglasses, played the sar
castic oddball, grasping for banter
and one-liners.

"You guys heard a lot of shit this
weekend?" he asked, sipping San
Pellegrino. "I wouldn't know, I was fly
ing on my diamond-encrusted jet." The
other members remained silent

throughout, letting the If ontman do
the talking, while they jammed through
new cuts, "Taken For A Fool" and

"Someday," backed by Pong and Tetris
8-bit displays. And with Kanye up after,
the band frenetically crammed through
"Take It Or Leave It" before dropping
their instruments where they stood and
exiting with a swift goodbye.

KANYE WEST

Kanye West's two-hour show
case may have been stripped down
in comparison to his regular shows,
but it didn't skimp compared to
most other headlining acts at
Coachella. The set's opening estab
lished that from the start: dramatic
intro music ushered a couple dozen
backup dancers on stage as West
appeared, rising above the audience
on a crane-like platform as he began
his odyssey. He ran through his
discography with a showy display
reminiscent of last year's Jay-Z per
formance, shooting up fireworks
with each Zeus-like shout of

"Power" and returning both to more
emotional older works like "Jesus
Walks" and crowd hits like "Gold

Digger." Although Rihanna and Katy
Perry were rumored to have been
sighted around the festival grounds
this weekend, only Justin Vernon,
better known as Bon Iver, actually
performed onstage with West, and
West kept it simple in his closing,
ending the set with "Fley Mama"

given extra significance by him
telling the crowd that this was the
"most important" show he'd played
since his mother's death.
