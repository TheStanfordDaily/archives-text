Miranda July's second film
"The Future" is a multi
layered narrative poem,
precious in aesthetics, powerful in
vision and devastating in sincerity.
"The Future" will drill a small,
undetectable hole into your heart,
leaving you unsure if July has
extracted your fears and loves and
splashed them across the screen or
injected them, from the screen,
into you.
The story follows a young L.A.
couple, played by Hamish Linklater
and July herself. The film opens

with a purring voice, describing life
on "the outside," before showing
the couple, slouched on either end
of a couch, legs extended towards
each other, laptops angled on their
thighs: a 21st century relationship.
We soon learn that the purring
voice belongs to an injured alley cat
Sophie (July) and Jason (Linklater)
have brought to a shelter to have
his paw healed. The cat tells us that
the couple has named him Paw

Paw and has promised to return in
a month to pick him up from the
shelter. Sophie and Jason realize at
the onset of the film that their lives
will be changed drastically by the
arrival of Paw Paw, just as a cou
ple's life might be changed by the
arrival of a child. The couple must
pick up Paw Paw in a month or he
will be euthanized, and so the
deadline is set.

The film's overwhelming tone
is one of meek desperation at the
fast passing of time, the impossible
pace at which opportunity seems to
slip away. Unlike the common films
that center on individuals with a
month left to live, "The Future" is

painfully realistic; not everyone
determined to do great things will
do them, and some inertia cannot
be overcome with a reality check. As
July quits her job as a dance teacher
and sets out to create 30 dances in
30 days for a You Tube page, her
boyfriend breaks off from his
Internet job and sets out with the
belief that his calling will find him if
he just opens himself up to life.
Set to a score by Jon Brion
("Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless

Mind"), "The Future" delves into
the world of dreams and the super
natural dynamic of time and, with
Julys signature brand of absurd

honesty, discusses the kind of truths
that appear surreal at first glance
then entirely common and real and
right a moment later. The narrative
follows the fragility of relationships,
the ambiguity of desire and the
eagerness with which we retreat
from our dreams and manages to

recreate in its audience the same
restlessness, adoration and fear of
its subjects. Many moments during
the film feel like a biting of the lip
or a prolonged sigh, from the crisis
of infidelity to the heartbreak of

being a day too late.
July is a multi-talented poet,
author, film director, screenwriter
and actress she is, in a word, an
Artist, and "The Future" is the
most natural and beautiful of her
works yet.
