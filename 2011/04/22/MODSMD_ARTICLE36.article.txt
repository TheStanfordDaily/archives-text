# SAN FRANCISCO
## PREVIEW International Film Festival 
### â€“ misa SHIKUMA contact misa: mshikuma@stanford. edu 
The 54th San Francisco
International Film Festival
runs from April 21 to May 5,
featuring a series of master classes,
salon discussions and Q&A sessions
with filmmakers, in addition to a

hefty 189 films from over 40 coun
tries. Not sure what to check out? I
recently had the pleasure of attend
ing its inaugural press conference,
where Executive Director Graham
Leggat, Director of Programming
Rachel Rosen, Golden Gate Awards
Manager Audrey Chang and pro
grammers Sean Uyehara and Rod
Armstrong talked festival highlights,
programs and their top picks.
The New Directors division,
showcasing works from first- and
second-time directors, offers strong
female representation with 12 out of
28 features directed by women. (This
may seem low until one considers
the fact that only two out of this

year's 10 nominees for Best Picture at
the Academy Awards were directed
by women, and neither of them

received nods for Best Director.) The
buzz this year centers around "Sound
of Noise" from self-proclaimed
"sound-and-image anarchists" Ola
Simonsson and Johannes Stjarne

Nilsson, Jo Sung-hee's pregnant teen
drama ,"End of Animal," from South
Korea and Michelangelo
Frammartino's ode to rustic Italy, "Le
Quattro Volte." Additionally, Ahmad
Abdalla's "Microphone" and Maryam
Keshavarz's "Circumstance" provide
snapshots of individuals struggling
for self-expression in the contempo
rary Middle East. All but one of the
directors in competition for the New
Directors Prize will attend the festival
and provide post-screening Q&A
sessions.
The roster for World Cinema
features more recognizable names,
ranging from restored prints of
Frederico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita"
and Rainer Werner Fassbinder's
"World on a Wire" to Kelly
Reichardt's latest film, the Oregon
Trail story "Meek's Cutoff," featuring
Academy Award-nominee Michelle
Williams.

With 12 features and 48 shorts
in competition for the Golden Gate
Awards, this year's selection of docu
mentaries is an eclectic mix of old
and new with a prevalent emphasis

on places. Look out for the interna
tional debut of "The Tiniest Place,"
which chronicles the rebuilding of a
Salvadorean village in the aftermath
of civil war, and "Cinema
Komunisto," an expose of the
Yugoslavian film industry. Within
our own borders, "Detroit Wild
City" and "Foreign Parts," the latter
set in Queens, explore cultural
rebirth and urban renewal in the face
of industrial heritage.
This year's World Cinema
Spotlight, supported by the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
to highlight trends in international
filmmaking, features Werner
Herzog's "Cave of Forgotten
Dreams," a rare glimpse into the
Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc caverns and the
world's oldest prehistoric art; Arnit
Dutta's "Nainsukh," a tribute to the
18th-century Indian painter; and
Lech Majewski's "The Mill and the
Cross," which brings to life Pieter
Bruegel's "The Way to Calvary."
(Incidentally, the latter is one of
Leggat's picks for festival favorite.)
Dubbed "Painting with Light," this
program explores film representa
tions of two-dimensional art and the
power of cinema to provide depth
and tease out historical context.

The Late Show, an exhibition of

"extreme" cinema, features "The
Selling," an unusual tale of the real
estate crisis with the paranormal
thrown into the mix, in its world
premiere by local filmmaker Emily
Lou. Or, for fans of "Jurassic Park,"
consider Norway's "The Troll
Hunter" (directed by Andrew
Ovredal).
For films highlighting gay and
lesbian identity, Leggat recom
mended Mike Mills' "Beginners,"
which is playing on the festival's
opening night, the aforementioned
"Circumstance" and Marie Losier's
"The Ballad of Genesis and Lady
Jaye." If you're looking to satisfy your
inner human rights activist or envi
ronmentalist, check out Alrick
Brown's "Kinyarwanda," which tack
les the Rwanda genocide from both
Hutu and Tutsi perspectives; Oliver
Schmitz's South African coming-of
age story, "Life, Above All"; and
Risteard O Domhnaill's documen
tary "The Pipe," about an Irish com
munity's struggle against the con
struction of a natural-gas pipeline.
And for a unique look at the film
makers of tomorrow, "Youth Media
Mash-Up" features shorts (narrative,
documentary and animated) by
artists between ages 14 and 18. On
that note, if you're looking to bring
your own youngsters along, the ani
mated feature "A Cat in Paris" is sure
to please audiences of all ages.
The Live & Onstage segment
consists of four programs ranging
from a tribute to musician and
writer Leonard Cohen, "New Skin
for the Old Ceremony," to a presen
tation of selected works from short
film auteurs, the Zellner brothers, in
"From A to Zellner." For insights into
the film industry, "Porchlight" is a
nonfiction storytelling series with
guests including filmmaker John
Herschend, and Christine Vachon,
acclaimed producer of "Boys Don't

Cry," "Hedwig and the Angry Inch"
and HBO's "Mildred Pierce," will
provide the "State of Cinema"
address. For those looking to get
more involved, topics for this year's
master classes include film criticism
(with French critic Jean-Michel
Frodon), the producer/director col
laboration (with Alison Dickey and
Azazel Jacobs) and screenwriting
(with Frank Pierson). And if you're
feeling passionate about either
French cinema or social justice docu
mentary, be sure to register for the
newly implemented salon discus
sions.

So there you have it, a snapshot
of this year's SFIFF, but of course,
there are plenty of wonderful films
and events that didn't find their way
into my mini-guide. Visit
