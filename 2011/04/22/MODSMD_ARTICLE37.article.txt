## SCIENCE GEEKS RULE 
### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
Every Stanford student has his
or her own story of discover
ing that their roommate,
friend, RA or that-girl-in-section-

whose-name-I-can-never-remember
is actually ridiculously amazing and
even somewhat famous. One of my
friends met "the Toby Gerhart" a few
months ago. My circle of computer
scientist acquaintances speaks with a
certain awe about some of their

entrepreneurially successful compa
triots. My own such friend well,
perhaps you might recall "Cube
Boy" of frosh talent show fame.
Judy Dutton, in her new book
"Science Fair Season," provides an
in-depth expose on another breed
of mini-celebrity quite familiar on
this campus those students who
made their names on the high

school science fair circuit. The Intel
International Science & Engineering
Fair (ISEF to those in the know) is a
high-stakes game: one in five com
petitors have patents pending on
their work, winners are eligible for
tens of thousands of dollars in prize
money and university and profes
sional recruiters prowl the arena.

Talent is abundant, judging opaque
and it feels as though the whole

world is watching.
Against this backdrop, Dutton
chronicles the lives of 12 teenagers
leading up to their ISEF debuts.
They are a diverse bunch and cer
tainly not the stereotypical lab-coat
and-specs that one might expect to
find; among them is a child actress,
a Navajo boy living on a reservation,
a leper (yes, you read that correctly),
a juvenile delinquent, numerous
child prodigies and Stanford's own

Kayla Cornale 'll. Dutton devotes a
chapter to each student's story, and
this is where the author's inner jour
nalist and suspense novelist
shines. Her research is meticulous
and thorough without being
tedious, and her pacing, both within
each episode and throughout the
book, is superb. The reader ends
each chapter rooting for its protago
nist, and by the time the Intel chap
ters roll around, it feels like the sea
son finale of a reality television
show you can cut the tension
with a knife. Dutton writes about a
science fair the science fair
with all the glitz, glamour and nail
biting suspense of an Oscars presen
tation, leaving the reader hanging
onto every word.
Dutton's inspired treatment of
this niche subject is just what
today's America needs; she has
turned science into a sport as com
petitive and compelling as football.
Given all the recent White House
initiatives to galvanize science edu
cation across the country, "Science
Fair Season" is perfectly poised to
become the "Spellbound" of our
generation.
