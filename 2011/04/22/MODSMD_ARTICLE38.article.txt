History was made last Friday
when "Atlas Shrugged,"
the first installment of a
planned trilogy, finally hit movie
theaters after a decades-long strug
gle to bring Ayn Rand's iconic novel
to the screen. Unfortunately, the
resulting film is a botched adapta
tion that feels silly, histrionic and
completely devoid of the intellectual
backbone and dystopian gravity
that sustained the original.
"Atlas Shrugged" depicts a
decaying American society where,
one by one, its leading innovators
and producers disappear in protest
of increasing government control
over industry and the prevalence of
shameless freeloaders. Against this
backdrop, the protagonist Dagny
Taggart (Taylor Schilling), as one of
the few remaining individualists,
struggles to keep her family's rail
road company afloat.
While the book takes place at an
unspecified time, the lack of modern
technology as well as the global polit
ical instability strongly evokes the era
in which it was published, the late
19505. In adapting "Atlas Shrugged,"
however, screenwriter Brian Patrick
O'Toole and producer John Aglialoro
set events in the near future, wherein
the reliance on trains for transporta
tion is explained by an unprecedent
ed oil crisis that makes the use of

cars too expensive. This perhaps
would have been plausible if they
had also decided to modernize the
rest of the screenplay.
For those unfamiliar with the
original, Rand wrote her book using
the characters as thinly veiled vehicles
for her political philosophy, which for i
objectivity's sake translates to decidedly
unemotional dialogue. This is difficult
enough to endure in a 1000-plus page
novel. In a 100-minute movie, it is
downright painful. Presumably in an
effort to remain faithful to Rand's
work, the screenwriters copied many
of the characters' lines verbatim.
This may have passed if the movie
were set decades earlier, but instead
it creates an awkward and irreconcil
able rift between what is said and

what is seen.
Aglialoro first purchased the
movie rights to the book in 1992, but
found that studios were unwilling to
produce it, as they believed the materi
al to be unsuitable for film. With the
rights set to soon revert back to Rand's
estate, Aglialoro, almost in homage to
the spirit of the book, decided to go
the independent route largely through
his own financial backing. To put it
lightly, there are ways of working with
in a tight budget such that the audi
ence is unaware of it, but sadly, this is
not the case with "Atlas Shrugged."
From the stock footage to the visual
effects (particularly the famed Rearden
Metal), "Adas Shrugged" looks and
feels cheap. Perhaps the change of set
ting to the year 2016 was less an
attempt to modernize the story and

more a budgetary cop-out.
Directed by Paul Johansson,
whose previous credits include sev
eral episodes of "One Tree Hill", and
featuring an unknown cast, "Atlas
Shrugged" could have been a great
launching pad for numerous
careers. The acting, however, is pass
able at best but when the script
lacks emotional depth, it's difficult
to know whether the blame lies
more with the writers or the actors.
The most contrived element, by far,

is John Gait, the story's centerpiece
who leads the intellectual boycott of
the top producers against the rest of
the world. In the movie, Gait
appears as a shadowy figure that
lures leading industrialists away
through speeches that, unlike those
in the book, are laughable rather
than moving.
If the material had been in
other hands with more time and
money, maybe "Atlas Shrugged"
could have been saved. But alas, the
art of adaptation is much more
nuanced than simple cut-and-paste.
Looking forward, one can only
hope that the reception of the first
film will deter production of parts
two and three.
