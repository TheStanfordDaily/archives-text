## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
"First to First" has been the
rallying cry of the men's volley
ball team all year long, but the
postseason and Stanford's na
tional title defense officially be
gins Saturday night as the Car
dinal plays host to No. 5 Long
Beach State in the first round of
the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tournament.

Stanford (19-8,15-7 MPSF)
is No. 4 in the most recently re
leased AVCA Division I rank
ings, but earned the No. 3 seed
in the MPSF and drew sixth
seeded Long Beach (14-13,12-
10). The 49ers have never won
the MPSF Tournament, but
they upset Stanford twice this
season, including a 3-0 sweep of
the Cardinal at home. That
match was played back in Janu
ary, but the rematch in March
didn't go much better for Stan
ford a very balanced attack
saw the 49ers attack up the
middle all night long to the tune
of a .396 hitting percentage and
come back to win 3-2.

Antwain Aguillard was named
Thursday to the All-MPSF First

NOTES: No. 4 Stanford begins its
NCAA title defense by hosting No.
5 Long Beach State in the quarterfi
nals of the MPSF Tournament at
Maples Pavilion tonight. The 49ers
already own two victories over the
Cardinal this year, but have been
an inconsistent team this season,
finishing sixth in MPSF play. Stan
ford had four players named to the
All-MPSF team on Thursday, led by
junior outside hitter Brad Lawson's
second consecutive First-Team
award.
