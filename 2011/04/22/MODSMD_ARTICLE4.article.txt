# TITLE DEFENSE BEGINS AT HOME
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
"First to First" has been the
rallying cry of the men's volley
ball team all year long, but the
postseason and Stanford's na
tional title defense officially be
gins Saturday night as the Car
dinal plays host to No. 5 Long
Beach State in the first round of
the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tournament.

Stanford (19-8,15-7 MPSF)
is No. 4 in the most recently re
leased AVCA Division I rank
ings, but earned the No. 3 seed
in the MPSF and drew sixth
seeded Long Beach (14-13,12-
10). The 49ers have never won
the MPSF Tournament, but
they upset Stanford twice this
season, including a 3-0 sweep of
the Cardinal at home. That
match was played back in Janu
ary, but the rematch in March
didn't go much better for Stan
ford a very balanced attack
saw the 49ers attack up the
middle all night long to the tune
of a .396 hitting percentage and
come back to win 3-2.

Antwain Aguillard was named

NOTES: No. 4 Stanford begins its
NCAA title defense by hosting No.
5 Long Beach State in the quarterfi
nals of the MPSF Tournament at
Maples Pavilion tonight. The 49ers
already own two victories over the
Cardinal this year, but have been
an inconsistent team this season,
finishing sixth in MPSF play. Stan
ford had four players named to the
All-MPSF team on Thursday, led by
junior outside hitter Brad Lawson's
second consecutive First-Team
award.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman middle blocker Eric Mochalski (No. 13) has started all but one
match at middle blocker and will be crucial to Stanford's postseason success.
The men begin their quest on Saturday against Long Beach State.

nal with 24 kills and a .686 hitting
percentage in the second match be
tween the two squads.

The Cardinal will counter with
its own All-MPSF middle blocker,
but unlike the seasoned senior pres
ence of the 6-foot-6 Aguillard, Stan
ford will rely heavily on freshman
Eric Mochalski. Often working in
tandem with junior middle blocker
Gus Ellis, Mochalski burst onto the
scene and earned a starting role
early in the season, thanks in large
part to his efficient offense and ver
satility.
The 6-foot-5 freshman from
Manhattan Beach, Calif, can play
outside hitter, opposite or middle
blocker and finished second in the
MPSF with a .455 hitting percent
age. Mochalski also leads the team
with 85 blocks and is fourth in total
kills with 169.

In the victory over UCLA that
clinched home court in the playoffs
for Stanford, Mochalski had nine

kills on just 16 swings and con
tributed five blocks on defense.
But if Stanford is to succeed, it
will also need solid play from its vet
eran leadership in the form of out
side hitters Spencer McLachlin and
Brad Lawson. McLachlin, a senior,
was named to the All-MPSF Second
Team and was second on the team
with 387 kills while starting in 26 of
27 matches this season.
Lawson, for his part, was named
to the All-MPSF First Team for the
second consecutive year and racked
up some impressive statistics for the
season. A 6-foot-7 junior from Hon
olulu, Lawson was a First-Team All-
American last season and backed
up that honor with a team-high 428
kills and a .325 hitting percentage.
Flis 4.28 kills per set are good for
seventh in the country, and he has
come up big in several of Stanford's
biggest matches of the year in the
3-2 loss to Long Beach, he had 21
kills and seven digs with a .340 hit
ting percentage.
Junior libero Erik Shoji was also
named to the All-MPSF Second
Team, and he'll have to factor in de

fensively if Stanford hopes to con
trol the pace of play against Long
Beach.

Redshirt junior Garrett Dobbs
was cautious in his analysis of Stan
ford's chances to beat Long Beach
State, let alone pull off a difficult re
peat of last year's title run.
"We're going to have some really
tough matches coming up," he said.
"Long Beach has had some really
high and really low points this year,
but we have to prepare to see their
best team, and when they're at their
best they can be one of the top teams
in the country."
Defensively, at least, Stanford
likely saw Long Beach at its best in
January, when the 49ers held the
Cardinal to a .021 hitting percent
age. But if junior setter Evan Barry
can play like he did in last week's
win over Pacific, when he tallied a
career-high 63 assists that was just
one short of Stanford's all-time
high, the crowd at Maples should be
in for a true barn-burner of a match.
Long Beach leads the all-time se
ries by a wide margin, having won 41
of the 66 games between the two, in
cluding the one pre vious postseason
matchup that was played back in
1993.
Should the Cardinal advance, it
would meet the winner of No. 2
BYU and seventh-seeded UC-
Santa Barbara in a semifinal game
on April 28 at the site of the highest
seed. After that is the MPSF Final,
scheduled for Saturday, April 30
the four-team NCAA Tournament
begins Thursday, May 5 in State Col
lege, Penn.
