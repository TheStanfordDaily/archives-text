## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Nass examines causes, effects of multitasking 
### PATRICIA HO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Multitasking was the focus at Stanford's
2011 IT Open House yesterday, where com
munication professor Cliff Nass delivered the
featured talk. Nass discussed the studies he
used to examine multitasking's effects on effi
ciency and emotional development stud
ies that invariably apply to Stanford students
simultaneously juggling emails, Facebook
chat, iPod music and problem sets.

"The use of unrelated media content is
new, unprecedented and has a wide range of
effects that we're only beginning to under
stand," Nass said. "There are multiple causes,
but it turns out that this is a trend that has been
happening since the Industrial Revolution."
But multitasking adds a new factor to the
mix.

"This trend of media multitasking, even
though it has only emerged recently, the seeds
of it were set over a hundred years ago when
we became obsessed with media," Nass said.

As people attempt to keep up with the in
flux of new media tools, they are forced to
double-, triple- and quadruple-book the time
they spend using them.
"Every time a new media product or serv
ice appears, the first thing it does is it steals
time from other media activities," Nass said.
"But the lust for brand new media, with a re
luctance to give up existing and old media,
means that we end up using media in parallel.
"We try to over-schedule our media use,
making believe that we're getting everything
done, but we all know that when you double
book, you can't really get both things done at
the same time, so you spend time bouncing
back and forth," he added.
Nass added that this trend is prevalent in

nearly every age group; academic, social and
business situations all call upon people to
multitask.
As a result of these studies, Nass found that
high multitaskers, who perform a lot of tasks
simultaneously, and low multitaskers, who
split their time less, do not differ in general
memory capacity. However, distractors nega
tively affected high multitaskers. Nass' study
found a direct, negative correlation between
the number of distractors and the number of
relevant details that they were able to identify.
Furthermore, high multitaskers proved to
have difficulty storing and organizing pieces
of information, which Nass described as hav
ing "sloppy filing cabinets in their brains."
"You'd think that if there's one thing that
you'd expect multitaskers to be at, it's multi
tasking," Nass said. "But high multitaskers are
much slower in switching they can't help
thinking about what they're not doing. Their
brains are really just a mush of stuff and it's
hard for them to focus on what they're sup
posed to do."
Nass' research also analyzed freshman
writing, finding that high multitaskers' writ
ing featured a decreased continuity of ideas
and shorter sentences, as well as a stronger
focus on the future tense with a decreased
concern about the past.
"They don't sustain a thought through a
lengthy [piece of writing]," Nass said. "We see
less complex ideas; they're living and writing
in a staccato world. They're always worried
about what's going to happen and not what al
ready happened."
Drawing from his experiences as a resi
dent fellow in Otero, Nass explained the de
cline of face-to-face communication and a
lack of focus on the conversation at hand
among younger media users.

"Emotional understanding has to be
learned," Nass added. "We're all born with an
orientation towards emotional understand
ing. We're obsessed with emotion; everyone
in this room can de tect emotion through voic
es, faces and body posture. They learn by prac
tice, by paying attention, thinking and work
ing hard and listening to become socially
adept and aware."
However, for chronic media multitaskers,
the focus and concentration required in face
to-face communication is very difficult to at
tain. For young girls, this can result in negative
social consequences that include fewer "feel
ings of normalcy," more susceptibility to peer
pressure and less sleep.
To correct for the negative effects of mul
titasking, Nass stressed the importance of en

gaging in face-to-face conversation and
"making it sacred," especially in family set
tings.
Economics Professor Marcelo Clerici-
Arias, who attended the talk, said he found
Nass' research to be very enlightening. As a
parent of two teenagers, Clerici-Arias agreed
that multitasking could be detrimental to
both the multitaskers and the people around
them.

"From a parent's perspective, I agree with
Cliff that I think it's affecting children nega
tively," Clerici-Arias said. "[My kids] are
aware of the consequences, but I think they
would work more efficiently if they didn't
have all of those distractions."

the number of distractors and the number of
relevant details that they were able to identify.
Furthermore, high multitaskers proved to
have difficulty storing and organizing pieces
of information, which Nass described as hav
ing "sloppy filing cabinets in their brains."
"You'd think that if there's one thing that
you'd expect multitaskers to be at, it's multi
tasking," Nass said. "But high multitaskers are
much slower in switching they can't help
thinking about what they're not doing. Their
brains are really just a mush of stuff and it's
hard for them to focus on what they're sup
posed to do."
Nass' research also analyzed freshman
writing, finding that high multitaskers' writ
ing featured a decreased continuity of ideas
and shorter sentences, as well as a stronger
focus on the future tense with a decreased
concern about the past.
"They don't sustain a thought through a
lengthy [piece of writing]," Nass said. "We see
less complex ideas; they're living and writing
in a staccato world. They're always worried
about what's going to happen and not what al
ready happened."
Drawing from his experiences as a resi
dent fellow in Otero, Nass explained the de
cline of face-to-face communication and a
lack of focus on the conversation at hand
among younger media users.

"Emotional understanding has to be
learned," Nass added. "We're all born with an
orientation towards emotional understand
ing. We're obsessed with emotion; everyone
in this room can de tect emotion through voic
es, faces and body posture. They learn by prac
tice, by paying attention, thinking and work
ing hard and listening to become socially
adept and aware."
However, for chronic media multitaskers,
the focus and concentration required in face
to-face communication is very difficult to at
tain. For young girls, this can result in negative
social consequences that include fewer "feel
ings of normalcy," more susceptibility to peer
pressure and less sleep.
To correct for the negative effects of mul
titasking, Nass stressed the importance of en

gaging in face-to-face conversation and
"making it sacred," especially in family set
tings.
Economics Professor Marcelo Clerici-
Arias, who attended the talk, said he found
Nass' research to be very enlightening. As a
parent of two teenagers, Clerici-Arias agreed
that multitasking could be detrimental to
both the multitaskers and the people around
them.

"From a parent's perspective, I agree with
Cliff that I think it's affecting children nega
tively," Clerici-Arias said. "[My kids] are
aware of the consequences, but I think they
would work more efficiently if they didn't
have all of those distractions."
