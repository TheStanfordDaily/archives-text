## Caltrain Board approves increase in base fare, parking fees 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
The Caltrain Board of Directors
voted 6-3 yesterday to approve fee
increases as part of a budget-balanc
ing plan for fiscal year 2012. The
board's decision keeps service at 86
trains per weekday and adds 25 cents
to the price of one-way tickets and 50
cents to day passes. It also increases
daily parking fees from $3 to $4 and
monthly parking fees from $3O to
$4O. The changes will take effect July
1.
Board members Sean Elsbernd,
Omar Ahmad and Jose Cisneros
voted against the resolution, arguing
that "it was not a sustainable funding
plan," according to Caltrain spokes
woman Christine Dunn.
Although the Board expects the
new prices to mean higher revenues,
the plan still leaves a projected $3.5
million budget deficit. To fill the
hole, the board is seeking additional
money from the Metropolitan Trans
portation Commission (MTC),
which oversees Bay Area trans
portation-related funding, and Joint
Powers Board (JPB) partner agen
cies.
"The capital funds for operating
expenses have yet to be finalized,"
Dunn said.
If it fails to close the gap, the
Board will have to revisit the budget
later this year.
An earlier plan, presented April
7, would have reduced service to 76
trains per weekday and closed three
stations, but also increased fares and
fees the same amount as the ap
proved plan and asked for an in
crease in JPB partner agency contri
butions. In addition
The budget will be balanced with
one-time sources this year, meaning
the board will have to look for more
funding come next year.
