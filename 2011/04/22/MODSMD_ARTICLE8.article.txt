# Nanoparticles prove safe, viable in mouse study
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ An Le Nguyen 
Investigators at the School of
Medicine have shown that engi
neered nanoparticles can be safely
administered in a mouse study.
Their finding, published April 20 in
Science Translational Magazine,
could bring about human trials that
utilize the nanoparticles in the de
tection of colorectal and other can
cers.
Nanoparticles are gold-centered
balls that are tinier than viruses,
measuring 100 nanometers in diam
eter. The materials that coat the
gold centers have subtle optical
properties, and the centers them
selves are roughed up for detection
by Raman microscopes.
"Photoimaging with these
nanoparticles holds the promise of
very early disease detection, even
before any gross anatomical
changes show up, without physically
removing any tissue from the pa
tient," Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, a sen
ior author of the study, said in a
press release.
But before the nanoparticles can
be used in human beings, scientists
had to first prove that they are not
harmful. The Stanford study was, in
fact, the first to prove the safety of
these nanoparticles.
To demonstrate this, scientists
administered the nanoparticles to
two groups of mice, each including
30 male and 30 female animals. The
first group received the nanoparti
cles rectally and the second group
received the treatment intra
venously. In both cases, the investi
gators did not find signs of toxicity.
This good news may mean that
similar intravenous treatments
could be applied to human beings in
the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.
Gambhir and his colleagues are in
the process of filing for Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) ap

proval to move to clinical trials.
The University's Department of
Radiology, the National Cancer In
stitute and the Canary Foundation
sponsored the recent nanoparticles
study.
