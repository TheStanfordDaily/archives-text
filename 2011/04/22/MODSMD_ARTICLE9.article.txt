# Palo Alto, hospitals reach potential expansion deal
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
The Palo Alto City Council
reached a tentative deal Wednes
day night that could get the ball
rolling on the University's hospi
tal expansion plans. If passed, the
deal would allow the Stanford
University Medical Center to ex
ceed its zoning regulations in
what will be the largest construc
tion project in the city's history.
The new offer guarantees the
city a minimum of $B.l million in
construction-use tax revenue by
2025, adding to a rejected plan's
proposal to pay Palo Alto $1.7
million up front to cover project
ed increases in operating costs.
The estimated $173 million
package also offers $90.9 million
in Caltrain Go Passes to all hospi
tal employees, $25 million for
four new Marguerite shuttles and
$5.1 million over 51 years for a
transportation demand manage
ment coordinator who would ad

dress the city's concerns over in
creased traffic from the expan
sion.
Under the offer, Stanford
would also contribute $4 million
to the city's community health
programs, $3 million in patient
benefits for low-income residents,
$23 million for affordable housing
programs and $l2 million for cli
mate change mitigation efforts.
Once the deal passes and the
Environmental Impact Report
(which will be reviewed May 11)
is approved, the hospitals can
proceed with the expansion. The
city council is scheduled to dis
cuss the development agreement
in June.
