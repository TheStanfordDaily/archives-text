Ten miles off the coast of Costa
Rica, Stanford researcher Jennifer
Saltzman stands on the ship deck
of the JOIDES Resolution watch
ing a gigantic steel drill dig a 23-
foot-wide hole in the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
The drill will reach depths of up to 6,924 feet, or
about 1.3 miles, below the ocean floor.
Its mission? To extract deep samples of
earth that could provide crucial insight into how
subduction zones places where one tectonic
plate of the Earth's crust is shoved beneath an
other â€” produces large earthquakes, such as
the recent magnitude-9 earthquake that rav
aged the coast of Japan. This type of research is
the "smoking gun" in uncovering the environ
mental and climate changes that have shaped
the planet's transformation throughout history,
from continental drift to the extinction of the di
nosaurs, Saltzman said.
Deep-sea drilling has played an integral part
in shaping scientific understanding of geologic
phenomena, such as major earthquakes, vol
canic eruptions and tsunamis. Aboard the
JOIDES Resolution, researchers are drilling to
depths previously unheard of, where sediments
could unlock the secrets that may one day allow
scientists to foresee tectonic disasters before
they take place.
The ship, which is affectionately called the
JR, is the only American ship in the world de
voted solely to scientific drilling. Its full
acronym, JOIDES, stands for Joint Oceano
graphic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling.
"Resolution" honors the HMS Resolution, a
ship commanded more than 200 years ago by

Captain James Cook, who explored the Pacific
and Antarctic Oceans. Today, the JR roams wa
ters across the globe, from New Zealand to
Tahiti to Central America to the Bering Sea.
Assisting in this endeavor are over 100 indi
viduals representing 10 nations on four conti
nents: engineers, technicians, oilers, chemists, re
searchers, curators, computer science and imag
ing specialists, a captain, laundryman and pro
fessional chefs. They work and live together
aboard the JR, where operations continue 24
hours a day in the lab stack an innovative re
search space comprised of seven vertical floors
of laboratories.
Saltzman, director of outreach education at
the School of Earth Sciences and a lecturer in
geological and environmental sciences, was
part of this team, working a 12-hour shift each
day like every member of the crew for the five
week research voyage. She rose with the sunrise
at 6 a.m. and worked until just before sunset at
6 p.m.
She was hired from a nationwide pool of ap
plicants as the ship's education officer. Her du
ties included sharing the JR's progress with stu
dents through blogs and live online broadcasts
as well as conducting research along with the
rest of the crew, spending days processing sedi
ment samples in the geochemistry lab.
Saltzman jumped at the opportunity to par
ticipate in the five-week research voyage when
she was offered the position early this year.
Along with looking at the sediment sam
ples, she also got to share her experience with
student audiences around the country through
her blog posts on the JOIDES Resolution web
site. Her entries paint a colorful portrait of life
aboard the JR and help explain the research in

ways that younger audiences can understand.
In one post, for example, Saltzman described
drilling into the sediment on the seafloor as
similar to' 'pushing a giant straw through layers
of cake or Jello!"
Saltzman also found away to interact with
her land-bound viewers through live online
broadcasts over Skype. She spoke to many class
rooms in California and shared her experiences
as part of the research team. A few weeks ago,
Saltzman talked to a sixth-grade earth science
class in Santa Clara, Calif. She took them on a
photo tour of the JR and told them about some
of the research methods the scientists use
some of which, like tasting the core samples to
test for differences in texture, are strange and
counterintuitive.
Her broadcasts even made their way back to
the Stanford campus. Kelly Marren 'l3, one of
Saltzman's advisees, tuned in from her laptop in
her dorm room.
"[I was] wowed by the highly scientific
process of studying these core samples, cen
timeter by centimeter," she said. "I can't believe
all this is taking place on a ship! I was very im

pressed by the dual existence of ship life and re
search."
For Saltzman,teachingfrom aboard the ship
was an exciting aspect of her job. She used her
blog and broadcasts to create a link between
the purely scientific aims of the research aboard
the JR and the avid minds of earth science stu
dents on the Farm.
"I love teaching," she said. "I love sharing
what I know about the world and helping peo
ple understand."
Though Saltzman's five-week voyage
ended when the JR returned to port on April
13, the ship's research will continue when it
embarks on its next voyage, which is planned
to explore waters offshore of Panama.
"We are FAR from understanding every
thing about how the Earth system works, let
alone how to design all the tools and experiments
to get us there," Saltzman wrote in her blog.
"That is the exciting thing about science.There is
still so much to learn and do. There is so much
still to discover."
