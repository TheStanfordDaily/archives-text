## THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY A Response to the Ad Hoc's Recommendation for ROTC's Return
### Cristopher Bautista 
Recently, an ad hoc committee
consisting of Stanford stu
dents and faculty was formed
in order to research the merits of the
return of ROTC to campus. Last
week this committee released a
statement supporting the return of
ROTC. Section 5.1 of the statement
specifically addresses the argument
of ROTC's violation of the nondis
crimination policy.
To say the least, I was disturbed
by the rhetoric the committee used
to describe their reasons behind
backing ROTC. An opening line in
Section 5.1 reads:
This objection focuses on the al
leged persistence of discrimination
within the military despite the repeal
of DAD T and says that any restruc
tured, on-campus ROTC program
would make Stanford complicit in
such discrimination.
The committee was dismissive of
transgender people and their experi
ences. Those words "alleged per
sistence of discrimination" it's in
teresting how this discrimination is
"alleged" as if it's merely some
thing that people talked about to
stall, that it's all ultimately a lie. Tell
that to somebody who did experi
ence that discrimination. Some stu
dents' support of the return of
ROTC and the military's presence
on campus led them to say (uninten
tionally or intentionally) transpho
bic statements. I had to face that. My
transgender friends faced it. This dis
crimination is not "alleged." It actu
ally happened. If ROTC discriminat
ed against women, an ethnic minori
ty or a religious minority, we would
not even be having this debate. The
fact that this debate is even occur
ring in the first place that there
needs to be a committee on this is
in essence problematic.
But perhaps what is most disturb
ing to me is the argument that taking
a stand for transgender rights is not
worth preventing the return of
ROTC. Here's another excerpt from
that statement:
We fail to see any good reason for
the current exclusion of persons from
the American military merely be
cause of their transgender status. But
our committee did not set out to deter
mine whether all the policies of the
American military are fully in keep
ing with the nation's civic ideals. That
seems to us far too high a standard to
set in order to open the door to a more
educationally productive relation
ship between Stanford University and
ROTC.

I'm disappointed by the fact that
protecting the equality of all Stan
ford students is "too high a standard
to set." Apparently, my rights are so
unimportant to protect that I'm
worth sacrificing for the greater
good. This is all, sadly, part of an
emerging pattern. Throughout histo
ry, transgender people have been left
behind for the sake of everyone else.
Gender non-conforming people led
the Stonewall riots the catalyst of
the gay rights movement yet, you
don't see their efforts acknowledged.
Homosexuality was no longer classi
fied as a psychological disorder in the
19705, but transgender identities are
still medically pathologized. In the

Employment Non-Discrimination
Act, a bill in Congress that would
give federal protection to LGB indi
viduals, "gender identity" was re
moved from the bill so that it would
get more votes (it has yet to pass in
Congress). The "No on Prop 8" cam
paign excluded transgender people
from their advertisements for the
sake of making the queer communi
ty look more "mainstream friendly."
(Prop 8 passed, and gender-inclusive
marriage is still illegal in California).
These were my battles to fight as
much as they were everyone else's.
And when trans people were left be
hind, I gritted my teeth and accepted
it. If my LGB siblings got those rights
first, then it's only a matter of time
before transgender people followed
suit,right? But that hasn't happened.
And I don't think it will happen un
less we trans people stand up for our
selves and say we deserve rights too.
We've fought for LGB rights. It's
time people fought for us.
Now this pattern is emerging at
my school. DADT was repealed, and
again, I'm hearing the argument that
since my LGB siblings can now
serve, that the rights of transgender
people will soon come next. Call me
a pessimist, but I don't buy it.That ar
gument has been used way too many
times, and way too many times trans
gender people have been screwed
over.
There aren't many open trans
gender people on campus, and often
times, our voice is not heard. I am
glad that my peers have supported
me, and I am thankful for them. But
in the end, it's the University that de
cides the fate of ROTC. The ad hoc
committee's recommendation is
merely that a recommendation.
The Faculty Senate is going to vote,
and ultimately the decision lies with
President Hennessy.
I hope the Stanford administra
tion doesn't invalidate my identity
for the sake of getting the few extra
bucks from the government. Do we
want to be the kind of university that
throws out its nondiscrimination
policy for political expedience? This
is an opportunity for Stanford to
make a statement to the rest of the
country, standing up for equality for
all students. I hope my university
does the right thing.
