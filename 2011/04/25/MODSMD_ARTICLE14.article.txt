## Toward a Real Student-Run Honor Code 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
Last week, on the advice on the U.S. Justice Depart
ment, President Hennessey's office unilaterally
lowered the standard of proof in Judicial Affairs
cases involving sexual assault from "beyond a reason
able doubt" to "a preponderance of the evidence."
While some might be frustrated that he failed to consult
the student body in making this change, it's altogether
understandable; President Hennessey is responsible for
a large check from the federal government that's contin
gent on complying with it's edicts.

More interestingly, this action preempted a current
review of the Judicial Affairs committee that's asking a
more important question: what should the standard of
proof for all cases be, and, more generally, how should
the Judicial Affairs process be updated to make it more
relevant? Last Tuesday, we participated in a somewhat
under-attended event (we were the only two people
there) with the committee doing the review designed to
give students input on these questions. Their goals were
simple and altogether admirable: produce a set of re
forms that would simplify the system, make the student
body feel more invested and most importantly, pass an
up down referendum by the student body.
First, let's deal with the standard of proof. Stanford is
one of only a few universities to use "beyond a reason
able doubt" as the standard of proof in campus Judicial
Affairs. That said, the committee itself made it clear that
the standard, whatever it is, is the deciding factor in, at
most, a handful of cases a year. That is, it's not very often
when a judicial board says after a preponderance of the
evidence, "you're guilty, but we just can't get beyond our

reasonable doubts." The average Stanford student does
n't know much about Judicial Affairs, but they do know
that anything less than "beyond a reasonable doubt"
sounds like a violation of their constitutional rights.
Odds are, if you put anything other than "reasonable
doubt" to a vote, it won't pass. So keep it as it is it isn't
broken, so don't fix it.
On to real reform. The first and perhaps easiest re
form to implement would be to increase the pool of po
tential judicial board members, the jury pool if you will.
Currently, the Judicial Charter of 1997 states that the
size of this pool will not be less than 30 students, faculty
and staff, which inevitably means that the same few peo
ple will serve on most Judicial Affairs panels. This turns
the entire process into something of a black box. Odds
are, you don't know anyone who's had firsthand experi
ence with Judicial Affairs, and if you do, it probably was
n't on their terms.
If the pool was increased to say 300 and the composi
tion of any individual panel was determined by lottery,
not only would the process be less biased to the will of
the same panel, but also its contact with the wider cam
pus community would increase exponentially. The
tradeoff is pretty obvious: it would be a lot more effort
on the part of Judicial Affairs to train and manage a jury
pool this large, but we think the benefits far outweigh
the administrative overhead. The only way to get stu
dents to take ownership in the process is to get them in
volved; what better way then by increasing the cross sec
tion of campus that serves on hearing panels? A few stu
dents being consistently involved in a process that we
don't ever hear about doesn't connect us to the proceed
ings, but this reform might.
Finally, the hardest but potentially most important
reform needed is to systematically decrease the time it
takes to resolve Judicial Affairs cases. The average case
length for 2009-10 was 108 days. While this is an im
provement on the 139 average for 2008-09, it is still un
acceptable. With a quarter-long case length, those un
dergoing investigation are forced to deal with the mat
ter for a significant portion of their Stanford careers.
This isolates them from the student body and, as a corol
lary, isolates the student body from the process.
When discussing with the committee, it was difficult
to determine if the case backlog was leading to the delay
or if the delay was leading the case backlog. Either way,
some combination of more staff and a generally acceler
ated process stricter rules on response time and the
like is imperative. An even better if not somewhat
impractical option would be to mandate a nonnego
tiable five-week timeout on every case. If the Judicial
Affairs Office fails to bring the case before a board in
five weeks or less, the matter is simply dropped.
The goal of these reforms is simple to foster the
sentiment on campus that every student has a stake and
vested interest in the honor code, fundamental standard
and process utilized to uphold them. To accomplish
them, Judicial Affairs needs to be removed from its black
box and made a bigger part of the campus collective con
science. We need an understandable, understood and
speedy process so that we as a student body buy into
whatever justice that's being administered on our behalf.

sounds like a violation of their constitutional rights.
Odds are, if you put anything other than "reasonable
doubt" to a vote, it won't pass. So keep it as it is it isn't
broken, so don't fix it.
On to real reform. The first and perhaps easiest re
form to implement would be to increase the pool of po
tential judicial board members, the jury pool if you will.
Currently, the Judicial Charter of 1997 states that the
size of this pool will not be less than 30 students, faculty
and staff, which inevitably means that the same few peo
ple will serve on most Judicial Affairs panels. This turns
the entire process into something of a black box. Odds
are, you don't know anyone who's had firsthand experi
ence with Judicial Affairs, and if you do, it probably was
n't on their terms.
If the pool was increased to say 300 and the composi
tion of any individual panel was determined by lottery,
not only would the process be less biased to the will of
the same panel, but also its contact with the wider cam
pus community would increase exponentially. The
tradeoff is pretty obvious: it would be a lot more effort
on the part of Judicial Affairs to train and manage a jury
pool this large, but we think the benefits far outweigh
the administrative overhead. The only way to get stu
dents to take ownership in the process is to get them in
volved; what better way then by increasing the cross sec
tion of campus that serves on hearing panels? A few stu
dents being consistently involved in a process that we
don't ever hear about doesn't connect us to the proceed
ings, but this reform might.
Finally, the hardest but potentially most important
reform needed is to systematically decrease the time it
takes to resolve Judicial Affairs cases. The average case
length for 2009-10 was 108 days. While this is an im
provement on the 139 average for 2008-09, it is still un
acceptable. With a quarter-long case length, those un
dergoing investigation are forced to deal with the mat
ter for a significant portion of their Stanford careers.
This isolates them from the student body and, as a corol
lary, isolates the student body from the process.
When discussing with the committee, it was difficult
to determine if the case backlog was leading to the delay
or if the delay was leading the case backlog. Either way,
some combination of more staff and a generally acceler
ated process stricter rules on response time and the
like is imperative. An even better if not somewhat
impractical option would be to mandate a nonnego
tiable five-week timeout on every case. If the Judicial
Affairs Office fails to bring the case before a board in
five weeks or less, the matter is simply dropped.
The goal of these reforms is simple to foster the
sentiment on campus that every student has a stake and
vested interest in the honor code, fundamental standard
and process utilized to uphold them. To accomplish
them, Judicial Affairs needs to be removed from its black
box and made a bigger part of the campus collective con
science. We need an understandable, understood and
speedy process so that we as a student body buy into
whatever justice that's being administered on our behalf.
