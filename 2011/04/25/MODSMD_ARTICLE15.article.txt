## BOUNCING BACK 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
North fought South this week
end in the world of Pac-10 base
ball, with Stanford meeting U CLA
in a series between the two teams
picked to finish best in the confer
ence this year. But while the No. 11
Bruins came into the series tied for
second in the conference, the
slumping Cardinal was in desper
ate need for wins, having fallen to
seventh in the Pac-10 and 26th in
the country.
It looked like things would only
get worse for Stanford, until a two
out, four-run rally in the final in
ning of the three-game set secured
a series win for the Cardinal. Stan
ford finished the weekend with a
pair of 7-4 and 5-4 wins on Thurs
day and Saturday, along with a 1-4
loss on Friday.

"This win was huge," said
sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger after Sunday's game.
"There's no doubt about it. But
honestly, we were in the same situ
ation last year, so this team knows
how to battle."
Stanford improves to 19-13 (5-7
Pac-10) with the win over UCLA
(21-14, 10-5), also ending a five
game Pac-10 losing streak in the
Thursday opener by knocking
around one of the best pitchers in
college baseball, Gerrit Cole. Com
ing up with hits against the strong
Bruin pitching staff would be a key
challenge for the Cardinal.
"We've really struggled with
the bat the last three weeks," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar

quess."But they have a great pitch
ing staff. They have the best pitch
ing staff in the conference."
Stanford turned things around
with nine hits off Cole in the open
er, including home runs from sen
ior catcher Zach Jones and junior
left fielder Tyler Gaffney en route
to a 7-4 win. Sophomore starter
Mark Appel (3-4) gave up nine hits
as well but stranded 12 UCLA bat
ters and managed to hold the Bru
ins to just three runs in his seven in
nings of work.
Gaffney's two-run shot in the
seventh chased Cole from the 6-3
game, and sophomore third base
man Stephen Piscotty launched
Mitchell Beacon's first pitch in re
lief for a solo homer.

But while the long ball reigned
supreme on Thursday, the pun
chout became the story on Friday.
Twenty-nine batters more than
half of those retired on the night
went down via the strikeout. And
with big-league scouts in the stands
to watch a UCLA star pitcher for
the second straight night,
righthander Trevor Bauer made
the most of the attention, tying a
career best with 17 strikeouts in a
complete-game win.
Bauer's fastball blew by the
Cardinal all night; Stanford hitters
only mustered four hits, and fresh
man second baseman Lonnie
Kauppila was the only batter that
did not go down on strikes at some
point.

Stanford's only run came in the
fourth inning, with a bases-loaded,
swinging strike three on a wild
pitch that advanced all runners.
But backing up Bauer (8-1), the
Bruins came back with runs in the
next three innings, taking game
two by a 4-1 tally.
The storyline looked all too
similar for the Cardinal heading
into the bottom of the ninth on Sat
urday. Behind pitching that had
given up only three hits, UCLA
was again up 4-1, allowing the only
run on a passed ball in the seventh
frame. Two quick outs seemed to
confirm a series win for the Bruins,
until freshman right fielder Brian
Guymon making just his sev
enth start of the season finally
got to reliever Nich Vander Tuig
with a single up the middle. After a
walk to sophomore pinch hitter
Justin Ringo, sophomore center
fielder Jake Stewart singled on a
full count to bring home one run.
Jones came to the plate, hitting
below .250 on the season, but final-
