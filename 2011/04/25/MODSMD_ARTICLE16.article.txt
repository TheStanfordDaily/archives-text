### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's volleyball team saw its
drive to repeat as national champions stall out
before it even picked up momentum, as the No.
4 Cardinal lost 3-2 in a dramatic five-set match
at home against No. 5 Long Beach State in the
MPSF quarterfinals Saturday night.
On the ropes at match point in the fifth and
final set, senior outside hitter Spencer McLach
lin had a chance to tie the score, but saw his

smash go just wide
of the line as the
49ers celebrated
on the Maples
Pavilion floor in
front of a thousand

fans, most of whom
were solidly in Stanford's corner.
Although this marks the end of the Cardi
nal's chances to repeat as MPSF Tournament
champions and earn an automatic bid to the
four-team NCAA Championships to be held in
State College, Penn. this year, there is still a slim
chance that Stanford (19-9,16-8 MPSF) could
slip in with the one at-large bid given out by the
selection committee.
No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara's upset win over No.
2 BYU Saturday night could end up being cru
cial to Stanford's cause, as the Cardinal swept
the Cougars this season and split with Santa Bar
bara (who likely didn't do well enough in the
regular season to merit an at-large selection re
gardless of their finish in the MPSF Tourna
ment). Should the Gauchos knock off Long
Beach in the MPSF semifinals this Thursday in
LA, it would likely be down to BYU, Long
Beach and Stanford for the NCAA bid.
On Saturday, Stanford nearly managed to
avoid all talk of at-large bids by getting over the
hump against Long Beach (15-13,12-10). De
spite losing the two previous meetings with the
49ers earlier this season, the Cardinal put up a
serious fight on its home floor.
Junior outside hitter Brad Lawson backed

up his selection to the All-MPSF First Team
with 27 kills, 15 digs and a match-high .426 hit
ting percentage on 54 swings. It just wasn't quite
enough, and the first set proved to be a harbin
ger of things to come in the match.
After trading points early on, Stanford took
a three-point lead midway through the set at 15-
12. The 49ers got some big contributions early
from freshman outside hitter Taylor Crabb,
who, along with reserve outside hitter Josh
Riley, would be crucial for Long Beach down
the stretch.

But even then, Stanford ran into a wall and
couldn't hold the lead Long Beach went back
on top for the first time since it led 7-6, going up
18-17. The Cardinal tied things up at 22,23 and
24, but dropped the first set 26-24 when junior
Gus Ellis was stuffed by a 49er block.
Stanford seemed to find energy in the
crossover, pouncing on Long Beach early in the
second set and getting the crowd into the match
as it stretched its lead as far as five. As quickly as
the Cardinal took the lead, it gave it back. Three
straight kills by Riley put the 49ers within one,
and a service ace by Riley tied the score at 17.
Long Beach clearly had the momentum by that
point and used a quick four-point run to force
Stanford head coach John Kosty into a timeout
late in game two.
Still, after a couple of attack errors on both
sides of the net, Stanford freshman outside hit
ter Steven Irvin smashed a big kill past the
block, tying the score at 24. Long Beach staved
off defeat with a Kyle Friend kill on match
point, but Irvin put the ball down on the second
match point try and evened the match at one set
each.
It wasn't enough, as the 49ers came out like
gangbusters in game three, storming out to a
five-point lead midway through the set. When
Stanford rallied which coincided with Law
son catching fire and smashing five kills in a
span of seven total points Long Beach just
managed to fight it off. A late four-point run
turned a tied game into an insurmountable
deficit for the Cardinal, who never led in the set.

Stanford was hitting in the low .200s at this
point in the match but turned that around with
just one attack error in the fourth set and a .414
hitting percentage. That reenergized the crowd
just in time to see freshman middle Eric
Mochalski get three blocks and two kills as he
and Ellis neutralized All-MPSF middle
Antwain Aguillard, who had been the Cardi
nal's kryptonite in the two previous matches.
After the 49er attack broke down late in the
fourth game with three attack errors and two
service errors, the match moved to a fifth set
with the momentum on Stanford's side.

vantage and forced Long Beach
coach Andy Read into a timeout, the
Maples crowd, on its feet now, could
almost taste the victory. But Crabb
and Riley wouldn't let it happen.
The senior Riley who had started
just eight matches all year had
four of his 19 kills in the fifth set, and
although Irvin had a kill to make it
13-12 in Stanford's favor, Crabb hit
two straight balls through the block
to put Stanford on the brink of elim
ination. When McLachlin's hit went
wide, it was all over.
The dramatic loss overshadowed

some great defensive performances
on both sides â€”junior libero Erik
Shoji had 16 digs to lead four Stan
ford players in double figures, in
cluding junior setter Evan Barry
who had 60 assists and 11 digs. For
the 49ers who have never won an
MPSF Tournament before four
players reached double figures in
digs including Riley with 13.
The Cardinal ended up outhit
ting Long Beach .262 to .243, but the
49ers got points at the right time to
move on and send Stanford packing.
The selection committee makes
its decision on the one at-large bid
next Sunday, with the NCAA semi
final set for May 5.
