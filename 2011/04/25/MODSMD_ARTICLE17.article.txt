# CARD 'SLAMS' CAL
## Men close season with 4-3 win over rival 
### DASH DAVIDSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team finished
the season in style on Saturday afternoon,
defeating No. 14 Cal, 4-3, in the annual Big
Slam at home. Beneath an unseasonable
gray sky, Stanford's top players performed
their best to secure a remarkable 10th con
secutive win on the No. 8 Cardinal's Senior
Day.

The action started quickly in the three
doubles matches, pitting some unfamiliar

teams with some very familiar ones. On
court three, freshman Jamin Ball who, as
the season has progressed, has forced his
way into the starting rotation was paired
in an unfamiliar duo with senior Alex Clay
ton against the freshman-sophomore team
of brothers Ben and Riki McLachlan. The
Cardinal (18-5, 5-1 Pac-10) came out firing
and posted the first victory of the day, an 8-5
win over the brothers.
Then on court one, in a matchup of two
top-25 ranked doubles teams, Stanford's No.
3 ranked pairing of juniors Bradley Klahn
and RyanThacher trounced the No. 23 team
of Nick Andrews and Christoffer Konigs
feldt from Cal (12-7, 3-3). The two doubles
wins gave Stanford the crucial first point in
the match, which it used as momentum
heading into singles play.
Immediately following the doubles play,
the Cardinal and its many fans celebrated
the three seniors on the Stanford team, who

paved the way for the rest of the men's tennis team
to secure a victory over rival Cal.
yesterday played their final regular
season match. The seniors Alex
Clayton, Ted Kelly and Greg Hirsh
mann shared a great career on
the Farm, combining for numerous
accolades including a 79-42 record,
three NCAA tournament appear
ances, a share of a Pac-10 title and a
return to the No. 1 national team
ranking something that had
been eluding Stanford for over
seven years.
Singles play got underway with
all eyes following the match on
court one, which pitted Klahn
against one of his chief rivals, Cal
senior Pedro Zerbini. Earlier this

season, on Feb. 18, Zerbini defeated
Klahn 7-5, 7-5 at Berkeley in their
first matchup.
Saturday promised to see a dif
ferent result, as Klahn came out fir
ing. He blitzed Zerbini in the first
set, running away with a 6-1 win, of
fering fist pumps and raucous
shouts to the Stanford crowd.
Klahn followed up his nearly flaw
less first set with an equally impres
sive second, winning it 6-2 and thor
oughly defeating his Brazilian foe,
giving Stanford a 2-0 edge in points
and helping to set the tone in what
would evolve into a hard-fought
match.
Clayton's resounding 6-1, 6-3
win on court three was tempered by
a 6-3, 6-3 loss by his doubles part
ner, freshman Jamin Ball, on court
six. That left the match score at 3-1
in Stanford's favor. The decisive

fourth point was now in the hands,
for Stanford, of sophomores Den
nis Lin and Matt Kandath and jun
ior Ryan Thacher.
Much of the remaining drama in
what was a highly competitive
match was lost when Kandath de
feated his opponent, the younger
Mclachlan, 7-5,6-4. With the win in
that match, the Cardinal defeated
the Golden Bears for the second
time this season and added another
impressive victory to its already
solid record.
Now Stanford will bide its time,
celebrate a successful regular sea
son and prepare for Thursday's
opening round of the Pac-10 cham
pionships, held in nearby Ojai,
Calif.
