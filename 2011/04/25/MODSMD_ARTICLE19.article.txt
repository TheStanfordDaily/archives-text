# Baseball hitting its stride?
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
During the course of any season,
teams face make-or-break, do
or-die moments. For the Stan
ford baseball team, Saturday
was one of them.
After an auspicious start to the season
against some the nation's best teams, the Car
dinal had stumbled of late, losing five consec
utive conference games before this series
with No. 20 UCLA.

The Cardi
nal, now un
ranked after
spending much
of the season in
the nation's top
20, did manage

to win on Thursday night — but stumbled on
Friday and trailed the Bruins 4-1 with two
outs and nobody on in the bottom of the
ninth in Saturday's rubber game. There was
no reason to think that there was any fight
left in the Cardinal — after all, Stanford had
mustered more than four runs just once in its
previous seven conference games.
But just when you least expected it, fresh
man right fielder Brian Guymon singled,
pinch hitter Justin Ringo walked, sophomore
center fielder Jake Stewart singled and sen
ior catcher Zach Jones doubled, tying the
score. Head coach Mark Marquess must
have been shaking his head, wondering
where that offense has been for the last
month.
After a pair of walks to load the bases,
sophomore shortstop Kenny Diekroeger
dunked a single in front of the outfield to win
it for the Cardinal. Seems so easy, doesn't it?
Could this be a turning point for the up
and-down Cardinal? Perhaps. With the win,
Stanford is back to a respectable 5-7 in a very
difficult Pac-10 — though things won't get
easier for Stanford anytime soon, as the Car
dinal has a trip to No. 9 Arizona State on tap
for next weekend.
The ninth-inning, four-run rally was a nice
start, but Stanford's offense will need to be
more consistent if the Cardinal is going to
turn a corner. Hitters have shown signs of life
— but they need to find a way to produce
day-in and day-out.
The potential is there — case in point was
Thursday night. Stanford's had-been putrid
offense was facing Gerrit Cole, UCLA's ace,
and arguably the best pitcher in the country.
So what did Stanford, which managed five
runs all of last weekend against Oregon
State, do? The Cardinal knocked Cole
around to the tune of six runs on nine hits in
6.1 innings en route to a 7-4 win. What may
have been the most amazing part of that of
fensive performance, however, is that Cole
(and his 98-miles-per-hour fastball) only
struck out one Cardinal hitter.
So Stanford was able to carry that mo
mentum into Friday night, right? Wrong. Fac
ing the Bruins' second ace, Trevor Bauer,
Stanford was utterly dominated as Bauer
threw a complete game four-hitter, striking
out a whopping 17 Cardinal batters. Does
any of this make sense? Not really. Yes,Bauer
is one of the country's best pitchers, but it's
difficult to explain the drastic lack of consis
tency.
A win like Saturday's may be crucial in
building much-needed momentum going
forward. A 5-7 record looks a lot better than
4-8. Not losing three conference series in a
row is also a huge plus. No one questions
Stanford's talent level — all the pieces are
there for this to be a College World Series
caliber team — the question is whether Mar
quess can push the right buttons and get nine
guys on the field playing well at the same
time.
One of the keys may be Jones. While Mar
quess has the liberty of shuffling players in
and out at other positions, Jones is really
Marquess' only option at catcher. He has
started every game, and no other catcher on
the team has a single at bat this season. Senior

Ben Clowe used to catch but doesn't
anymore so it looks like as long as
he is healthy, Jones will be behind the
dish.
Marquess knows that he will get
great defense out of Jones he has
thrown out exactly 50 percent of
would-be base stealers this season. He
also knows Jones can run when he gets
on base and can hit for some power (he
is tied for the team lead with three
home runs). However, Jones is dead
last among team regulars with a .236
batting average.
Much of that is a product of an ex

traordinarily slow start to the season.
In fact, in recent weeks, Jones has been
steadily improving at the plate, and
Marquess even moved him from the
ninth spot in the lineup to the two-hole.
Jones has more experience than any
other Cardinal player —as a fresh
man, he was the team's starting third
baseman when it went to the 2007 Col
lege World Series. Down the stretch,
Jones' leadership may be pivotal to
Stanford's success. It was definitely
pivotal to Saturday's win, at the very
least.

Daniel Bohm wishes people would
sometimes write about the do-or-die
moments for his club baseball team.
