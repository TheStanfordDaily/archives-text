## Fire breaks out at Product Realization Lab 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
On Saturday evening, five fire trucks from
the Stanford and Palo Alto fire departments
responded to a blaze at the model shop, which
is part of the University's Product Realization
Lab (PRL).
The Stanford Fire Marshal closed down the
PRL and posted a sign yesterday asking that
no one enter the building "until further no
tice." The shop, housed in Room 616 across the
street from Old Union, is most often used for
woodworking.
After the call came in at 9:54 p.m., officials
worried that the fire could have spread to
other parts of the building or nearby struc
tures. But the sprinkler on the ceiling activated

immediately and "smoke was pouring out
when the first units arrived" at 10:05 p.m., said
a Stanford University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) official who was on the scene.
The fire did not burn for long.
Earlier in the day, a "project was going on
where students were building windmills for de
veloping countries and learning to carve
blades," said PRL Co-director Craig Milroy,
who was at the scene after the incident.
The PRL closed at 5 p.m., and nothing ab
normal was reported. However, several types
of manufacturing oils, all flammable, were
stored in the building. The official speculated
that some "could've been leaking on the floor
and then combusted." An electric spark might
have caused the blaze, he said.
More conclusive information will be made

available, pending an investigation by the
Stanford Fire Marshal. The Marshal could not
be reached for comment over the weekend.
"It could've been worse nobody got
hurt," Milroy said. "It could've happened at
three in the morning, when nobody was here.
Luckily, some of our TAs were walking by
when the alarm went off."
On one count, the incident was a close call:
the lid on a linseed oil container, which was lo
cated in the middle of the fire, almost melted
through. An open oil container would have al
most certainly exacerbated the blaze.
Just after midnight, officials examined the
room with flashlights, checking the electrical
wiring and circuit breakers. At one point, the

Five fire trucks responded to a blaze at the Product Realization Lab on Saturday night. Though the exact cause of the fire has yet to be determined,
a fire official speculated that flammable manufacturing oils (which are stored in the lab) leaked onto the floor of the building and then combusted.
