## Fire breaks out at Product Realization Lab 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
On Saturday evening, five fire trucks from
the Stanford and Palo Alto fire departments
responded to a blaze at the model shop, which
is part of the University's Product Realization
Lab (PRL).
The Stanford Fire Marshal closed down the
PRL and posted a sign yesterday asking that
no one enter the building "until further no
tice." The shop, housed in Room 616 across the
street from Old Union, is most often used for
woodworking.
After the call came in at 9:54 p.m., officials
worried that the fire could have spread to
other parts of the building or nearby struc
tures. But the sprinkler on the ceiling activated

immediately and "smoke was pouring out
when the first units arrived" at 10:05 p.m., said
a Stanford University Department of Public
Safety (SUDPS) official who was on the scene.
The fire did not burn for long.
Earlier in the day, a "project was going on
where students were building windmills for de
veloping countries and learning to carve
blades," said PRL Co-director Craig Milroy,
who was at the scene after the incident.
The PRL closed at 5 p.m., and nothing ab
normal was reported. However, several types
of manufacturing oils, all flammable, were
stored in the building. The official speculated
that some "could've been leaking on the floor
and then combusted." An electric spark might
have caused the blaze, he said.
More conclusive information will be made

available, pending an investigation by the
Stanford Fire Marshal. The Marshal could not
be reached for comment over the weekend.
"It could've been worse nobody got
hurt," Milroy said. "It could've happened at
three in the morning, when nobody was here.
Luckily, some of our TAs were walking by
when the alarm went off."
On one count, the incident was a close call:
the lid on a linseed oil container, which was lo
cated in the middle of the fire, almost melted
through. An open oil container would have al
most certainly exacerbated the blaze.
Just after midnight, officials examined the
room with flashlights, checking the electrical
wiring and circuit breakers. At one point, the

lights in the room unintentionally
turned on.
Water from the sprinklers
dripped from the ceiling onto the
floor. In a last-ditch effort to keep
the machines from rusting, Milroy
rolled a cart loaded with dry rags
into the room and began to wipe
them off, also spraying them with
WD-40. Milroy said some equip
ment, most visibly the table saw,
had already started to rust less than
three hours after the incident.
"I don't know if this is going to
help or not," Milroy said.
He added that he was not sure
how long that part of the PRL
would be closed. The machines in
the model shop will most likely
have to be disassembled for repairs.
"At a certain point, it won't

make any sense to deal with them,"
Milroy said.
Machine repairs are either time
consuming or expensive, he noted,
and the former is especially a prob
lem when classes that use that part
of the shop are in session.
"Luckily, spring is our least busy
quarter," he added.
At about 12:45 a.m., a vehicle
marked "Restoration Management
Company" arrived to begin the
cleanup process. The first step is re
moving water from the floor, and a
new sprinkler will be installed by
noon today. After that, the water
pipes will be pressurized and the
fire alarm reset. Until then, a
SUDPS official will be at the PRL
on fire watch.
"This is the first fire I've been in
volved in, that's for sure," Milroy
said. "And hopefully it's the last
one."
