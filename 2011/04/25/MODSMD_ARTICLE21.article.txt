# A 						TOUCH OF YOUTH
## 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Preparing for postseason play,
the Stanford women's tennis team
invited the nation's best to the Farm
as it hosted an exhibition match
against the USTA Junior National
Team. Stanford (23-0, 8-0 Pac-10)
prevailed, 8-4.
"There were eight girls that were
chosen by the USTA to be part of a
training camp," said senior Carolyn
McVeigh. "But throughout the year
they've been playing against some
of the top college teams. They've
played Florida and Miami earlier in
the year. They played Cal on Thurs
day before we played them."

Included in the USTA national
team are players such as Krista
Hardebeck and Gabrielle Andrews
of California, both ranked atop
their junior divisions. Tennisße
cruiting.net details Flardebeck as
being interested in Stanford for col
lege, among other schools including
California, UCLA and USC. Flard
ebeck is a member of the high
school class of 2012. Andrews is cur
rently an eighth grader and a mem
ber of the high school class of 2015.
Both these players recorded im
pressive wins over Stanford's top
two players, senior Hilary Barte and
sophomore Mallory Burdette.
Hardebeck defeated Barte, 6-4,7-5
in two close sets. Andrews recorded
a very impressive three-set win over
Burdette, 4-6,6-4,7-6 (9).
The other two USTA points
came at the 7th and Bth singles
spots. High school sophomore Yuki
Chiang of California defeated
freshman Amelia Herring 6-4, 6-4.
High school sophomore Mia King
of North Carolina defeated Natalie
Dillon 6-1,6-4 at the eighth spot.
Beyond those four matches,
Stanford performed well in earning
an impressive win over these na
tional players. Both sophomore
Stacey Tan and McVeigh gutted out
three-set wins. Tan defeated high
school freshman Caroline Doyle, 6-
2, 5-7, 6-4, and McVeigh overcame

high school sophomore Alyssa
Smith, 6-3,3-6,6-3.
"She was really good," McVeigh
said of Smith. "I was really im
pressed by her professionalism ...
she had good volleys and was an all
around player. It was more a matter
of who was executing better, and I
thought I played really well in the
end."
Stanford rookie Kristie Ahn de
feated high school freshman Taylor
Townsend of Georgia, 6-3, 6-3,
while junior Veronica Li defeated
high school sophomore Jennifer
Brady of Pennsylvania, 6-4,6-2.
The college experience really
shone through in doubles play. Ju
niors competing on a national level
focus on singles competition with
the hopes that this will help them
once they turn professional, and
only on the college level do players

really focus on developing and im
proving their doubles ability.
McVeigh and Tan defeated Brady
and Hardebeck 8-6, overcoming
some of the top individual players.
"Hardebeck was their number
one singles player, but I think
Stacey and I were confident in our
abilities to take them down,"
McVeigh said. "This is just because
the years we've been playing dou
bles at college. In juniors, the focus
tends to be singles, so we had the
edge technically and experience
wise. We did more formations, had
more movement at the net, but I
was really impressed by their play."
Stanford won all four doubles
matches, highlighted by an 8-2 vic
tory at the third spot that starred
Herring and Li in a defeat over
King and Smith.
"I'd say the USTA juniors team
was one of the top two or three
teams we've played this year,"
McVeigh said. "It was really good to
see that team in place and showing
that it's possible to develop your
game through college tennis instead
of considering college tennis as the
fallback if you can't make it in the
professional circuit."
Stanford will now prepare for
the Pac-10 Championships, which
begin on Thursday in Ojai, Calif.
