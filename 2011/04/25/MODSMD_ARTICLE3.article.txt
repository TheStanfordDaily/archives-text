# ROTC's return endorsed
## Ad hoc committee releases report ahead of schedule 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
In a report released last Friday, the
ad hoc committee investigating the po
tential return of ROTC to Stanford an
nounced its support for the program.
The report comes several weeks early
of its anticipated May 12 delivery, and
a presentation of the recommendation
will be given at this Thursday's Faculty
Senate meeting.
The report calls for a "restructured
ROTC program" that includes a re
view of all ROTC lecturers and profes
sors by a designated Stanford commit
tee and courses available to all Stan
ford students for academic or activity
credit.
"An on-campus ROTC would aug
ment the civic education of other Stan
ford undergraduates as well," the re
port states. "The opportunity to talk
about patriotism, just and unjust war,
human rights, imperialism and anti
colonialism, etc. in a classroom or dor
mitory that includes prospective offi
cers in America's military is something
from which all our students can bene
fit."
The 10-member committee voted
unanimously in its supportive recom
mendation; however, unanimity was
not required, according to the commit
tee's chair, psychology professor
Ewart Thomas.
"Our recommendation reflects in
puts from every committee member;
the language was massaged here and
there, and it turned out to be possi
ble to write the recommendation in
such away that all on the commit
tee agreed to it," Thomas wrote in
an email to The Daily.
The committee began investi
gating the issue last March, follow
ing a presentation given by profes
sors David Kennedy '63 and
William Perry *49, M.S. *55, which
urged the University to explore its
options in helping to close a per
ceived civilian-military divide.
The report focuses on the histo
ry of ROTC at Stanford and dis
cusses two large issues surrounding
the debate over the program: the
academic merit of ROTC and its
perceived discriminatory policies.
"The two broad classes of argu
ments that we take up in the report
were the ones that took up much of
our time," Thomas said. "These are:
a) how serious are the academic
conflicts between the curricula for a
liberal education and that for
ROTC training likely to be, and b)
the claim that, because transgender
people and others are barred from
the U.S. military, bringing back an
on-campus ROTC program to
Stanford would violate Stanford's
own nondiscrimination policy."
After an ad hoc committee con
cluded that the program was not a
"worthwhile academic endeavor,"
the Faculty Senate voted 25-8 to
phase out ROTC programs on cam
pus and to stop rewarding credit to
ROTC courses by 1973. Today, 14
students participate in ROTC pro
grams through cross-town agree
ments with neighboring universi
ties and do not receive academic
credit.
Additionally, some have
claimed that support for a Stan
ford ROTC program would inher
ently violate the University's
nondiscrimination policy, but the
report claims a Stanford program
would not necessarily endorse
these policies.
"We fail to see any good reason

for the current exclusion of persons
from the American military merely
because of their transgender sta
tus," the report states. "But our
committee did not set out to deter
mine whether all the policies of the
American military are fully in
keeping with the nation's civic
ideals. That seems to us far too high
a standard to set in order to open
the door to a more educationally
productive relationship between
Stanford University and ROTC."
Over the last year, the commit
tee has solicited feedback from the
community in the form of open let
ters and town hall meetings, in addi
tion to discussions with other uni
versities about the format of their
ROTC programs. However, the
committee did not take into ac
count the recent non-binding advi
sory measure in which 2,406 stu
dents voted in support of ROTC,
while 929 voted in opposition, and
2,117 voted to abstain.
When asked about the impact of
the student vote on the measure on
the committee's report, Thomas
said it was "not much."
"I tried to follow the student
measures in The Daily and on the
web, and I even went to a court
room style debate that was won by
the ASSU leadership," he said,"and
I think others on the committee
monitored the same events. In that
sense, the issues got blended into
our discussions, but these debates
could not have had nearly the im
pact on our discussions as the issues
we do mention in the report."
ASSU President Michael Cruz
'l2 will speak on behalf of the stu
dent body at Thursday's meeting.
As a Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) endorsed candidate, Cruz
actively campaigned for abstention
on the advisory measure.
During the Faculty Senate meet
ing on April 28, Thomas said he will
make a short presentation, and
then the floor will be opened for
discussion. According to University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin, the Sen
ate is expected to vote at this meet
ing.
