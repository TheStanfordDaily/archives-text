## Yoo, Ramsey debate legality of war in Libya 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
With the U.S. military's involvement
in Libya still in its infancy, two scholars
came together at the Law School on Fri
day afternoon to debate the constitu
tionality of America's intervention in
the country. Professor John Yoo of UC-
Berkeley and University of San Diego
professor Michael Ramsey J.D. 'B9 pre
sented opposing arguments, with Yoo
defending the constitutionality of Presi
dent Obama's decision to carry out
airstrikes and Ramsey arguing that in
tervening in Libya requires a Congres
sional declaration of war.
Yoo's appearance generated contro

versy prior to Friday's event, organized
by the Law School's Constitutional Law
Center. During his time at the Depart
ment of Justice under the Bush adminis
tration, Yoo co-authored the "Torture
Memos," which provided legal justifica
tion for torturing terrorism suspects.
Students handed out pamphlets titled
"Why John Yoo should be fired, dis
barred and prosecuted" at the entrance
to the talk, and similar flyers covered the
outer wall next to the entrance of the
Law School.
"The problem with John Yoo is that
he is the person that devised a legal jus
tification for torture, which is universal
ly considered not only morally repre
hensible but illegal," said Omar Shakir
'O7, J.D. 'l3. "To have him speak at
Stanford Law School legitimizes not
only him, but also the criminal con
duct he helped to facilitate."
"We're not talking about someone
who just has a perspective we don't
agree with," he added. "To have him
participate in a talk that is sanctioned
by the Constitutional Law Center at
the Stanford Law School is a black
mark on the Law School and the Uni
versity."
Michael McConnell, the Constitu
tional Law Center's director who
moderated the talk and invited Yoo to
campus, defended Yoo's presence at
the Law School.
' 'A university is a place for inclusion,
not exclusion, of controversial ideas
and controversial people," he wrote in
an email to The Daily. "[Yoo] is a re
spected member of the faculty of the
University of California at Berkeley
and has been invited to speak at dozens
of universities around the country."
"Many students chose to protest
the invitation, and, in the best tradi
tion of Stanford, they did so in appro
priate places and appropriate ways,
which did not interfere with the right
of other Stanford students to hear the
debate, free of disruption," he added.
The debate itself saw a spirited dis
cussion between Ramsey and Yoo,
centering on the true nature of the dis
tribution of war powers between the
president and Congress.
Ramsey's position was grounded
in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Con
stitution, which gives Congress the
power to declare war. According to
the administration, military action in
Libya is not a "war" and thus does not
require the country to declare war

against the Libyan government.
"The 18th-century sources define
'war' very broadly," Ramsey said.
"The international law authorities
that wrote at this time ... defined war
simply as armed conflict between sov
ereigns."
He added that the meaning of the
word "declare" did not mean that the
president could begin a war, so long as
he did not say that the country was at
war with another nation.
"This seems like a very odd
arrangement to me," Ramsey said.
"The 18th-century meaning of declar
ing war is quite a bit broader than
that."
Yoo countered that the president is
authorized by the Constitution to re
spond to attacks on America or its na
tional interest without a Congression
al declaration of war, and that Article
I, Section 8 was not designed as a
check on presidential power.
"[Congress] has created a huge
army, navy and air force, which is pri
marily designed for offensive opera
tions in other people's countries," he
said. "The president, because of this
arrangement, exercises a great deal of
initiative and responsibility. However,
that does not mean that the president
has unfettered power to use that mili
tary ... Congress [can] cut off funds
for any war with which it disagrees."
Yoo also cited British law that pre
ceded the writing of the U.S. Constitu
tion, where the nation could be at war
for quite a while before the legislature
actually issued a declaration of war.
"Britain waged six or seven major
wars in the 100 years before the Consti
tution, but they declared war only once
before or at the start of hostilities," he
said. "Look at the Declaration of Inde
pendence. It is a declaration of war...
but Lexington and Concord occurred
well over a year before the Declaration
of Independence was issued!"

against the Libyan government.
"The 18th-century sources define
'war' very broadly," Ramsey said.
"The international law authorities
that wrote at this time ... defined war
simply as armed conflict between sov
ereigns."
He added that the meaning of the
word "declare" did not mean that the
president could begin a war, so long as
he did not say that the country was at
war with another nation.
"This seems like a very odd
arrangement to me," Ramsey said.
"The 18th-century meaning of declar
ing war is quite a bit broader than
that."
Yoo countered that the president is
authorized by the Constitution to re
spond to attacks on America or its na
tional interest without a Congression
al declaration of war, and that Article
I, Section 8 was not designed as a
check on presidential power.
"[Congress] has created a huge
army, navy and air force, which is pri
marily designed for offensive opera
tions in other people's countries," he
said. "The president, because of this
arrangement, exercises a great deal of
initiative and responsibility. However,
that does not mean that the president
has unfettered power to use that mili
tary ... Congress [can] cut off funds
for any war with which it disagrees."
Yoo also cited British law that pre
ceded the writing of the U.S. Constitu
tion, where the nation could be at war
for quite a while before the legislature
actually issued a declaration of war.
"Britain waged six or seven major
wars in the 100 years before the Consti
tution, but they declared war only once
before or at the start of hostilities," he
said. "Look at the Declaration of Inde
pendence. It is a declaration of war...
but Lexington and Concord occurred
well over a year before the Declaration
of Independence was issued!"
