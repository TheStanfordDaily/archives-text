## New dining hall to feature 'extended dining service' 
### SARAH FLAMM 
With the Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons set to open next fall, Stan
ford Dining has announced plans to
offer extended dining service between
current mealtimes. The new service will
offer meals between breakfast and
lunch as well as between lunch and din
ner during weekdays, at no additional
cost to students on a Stanford Dining
meal plan. The Board of Trustees ap
proved the change when setting tuition
rates for the 2011-12 academic year.
The new continuous service strives
to accommodate students who miss
regular meal periods, perhaps due to

conflicting class schedules, according to
Stanford Dining Executive Director
Eric Montell. Currently, students on a
Stanford meal plan generally have food
available from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m., 11:30
a.m. to 1:15 p.m. and 5:15 to 7 p.m., with
hours varying slightly among the 10 un
dergraduate dining halls.
However, the plan falls short of cre
ating a 24-hour eatery, an idea that was
bandied about by various candidates
and officials during ASSU elections. In
their platform, newly elected ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3 proposed having 24-hour access
to fruit, cereal, milk and juice.
In an attempt to gauge student
support for 24-hour dining, Deepa
Kannappan' 13, a former Senator, ad
ministered an email survey to under
graduates at the beginning of winter
quarter. The 300 responses revealed
high interest in having more food op
tions available between regular meal
times but little interest in having food
available from 2:30 to 7 a.m.
In another change to current op
tions, late night dining on East Cam
pus will be moved from Stern to Ar
rillaga. The hours will remain the
same, 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., but the menu
will be expanded to include a "Fit and
Healthy" menu consisting of items
that are 550 calories or fewer. Com
ponents of the new menu will be
launched this quarter, according to
Montell.
Montell added that Stanford Din
ing would evaluate the effectiveness
of the continuous dining pilot pro
gram throughout the course of the
next academic year, measuring stu
dent involvement in the program.
