## Egypt activist visits Stanford Wael Ghonim started Facebook page that sparked revolution 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Egyptian political activist and Google Mid
dle East executive Wael Ghonim spoke about
his role in helping catalyze the recent Egyptian
revolution in a talk on Friday at Cubberley Au
ditorium.
Ghonim, who recently made it onto TIME
Magazine's list of the world's 100 most influen
tial people, founded a Facebook group credited
with sparking the Jan. 25 revolution.
The 30-year-old Egyptian was detained for
11 days by Egyptian state security in late January
and early February. Ghonim gave an emotional
televised interview after his release on Feb. 7,
which fueled protests until former President
Hosni Mubarak resigned on Feb. 11.
During his talk at Stanford, which was organ
ized by the Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), Ghonim took the stage following the
presentation of video clips from A1 Jazeera's
documentary on the revolution, "Egypt Burn
ing," and a You Tube clip showing reactions to
Mubarak's resignation.
Ghonim began his talk on a modest note,
claiming an "allergy to video cameras" and a
hesitation to take full credit.
"I don't enjoy the compliments much, not be
cause I'm humble or anything, but because I
hate the fact that a lot of Egyptians aren't getting
the credit for work they did," he said.
"The real challenge is not to get rid of the
regime," he added. "The real challenge is to actu
ally achieve what we wanted to achieve from the
beginning."
Ghonim projected a note, written in Arabic,
that he had posted on the Facebook group on
Jan. 17. He proceeded to translate the note to the
