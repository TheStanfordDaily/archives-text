## Egypt activist visits Stanford Wael Ghonim started Facebook page that sparked revolution 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Egyptian political activist and Google Mid
dle East executive Wael Ghonim spoke about
his role in helping catalyze the recent Egyptian
revolution in a talk on Friday at Cubberley Au
ditorium.
Ghonim, who recently made it onto TIME
Magazine's list of the world's 100 most influen
tial people, founded a Facebook group credited
with sparking the Jan. 25 revolution.
The 30-year-old Egyptian was detained for
11 days by Egyptian state security in late January
and early February. Ghonim gave an emotional
televised interview after his release on Feb. 7,
which fueled protests until former President
Hosni Mubarak resigned on Feb. 11.
During his talk at Stanford, which was organ
ized by the Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN), Ghonim took the stage following the
presentation of video clips from A1 Jazeera's
documentary on the revolution, "Egypt Burn
ing," and a You Tube clip showing reactions to
Mubarak's resignation.
Ghonim began his talk on a modest note,
claiming an "allergy to video cameras" and a
hesitation to take full credit.
"I don't enjoy the compliments much, not be
cause I'm humble or anything, but because I
hate the fact that a lot of Egyptians aren't getting
the credit for work they did," he said.
"The real challenge is not to get rid of the
regime," he added. "The real challenge is to actu
ally achieve what we wanted to achieve from the
beginning."
Ghonim projected a note, written in Arabic,
that he had posted on the Facebook group on
Jan. 17. He proceeded to translate the note to the

audience, explaining what he want
ed from the revolution.
"I want to feel that I have a voice
in my country... I wish that corrup
tion is fought in my country .. I want
teachers to make students love
learning," he said.
Ghonim also translated select
passages, pausing to ask for his audi
ence's help with certain words.
"We had a dream," he said.
"Hosni Mubarak was a nightmare,
and we got rid of the nightmare, but
we still need to reach the dream."
Ghonim described Mubarak's
regime as an "obstacle" and cau
tioned against believing that the rev
olution is complete.
He spent the bulk of his talk out
lining practical steps that can be
taken to rebuild Egypt, calling upon
his audience to mimic the "inde
pendent initiative" of the protestors.
"You need to come up with grass
roots movements where you can all
get organized around a cause," he
said, suggesting the sponsorship of a
rural Egyptian village or investing in
young entrepreneurs.
He also listed restoring the
tourism industry as an immediate
concern.
After showing the audience a
web page where the public can sign
up to volunteer to rebuild Egypt,
Ghonim said his plans for the future
were to take time off from Google
and start an NGO to "add a differ
ence to people's lives using technol
ogy"
Dr. Ossama Hassanein, the chair
man of the board atTechWadi, a Sil
icon Valley-based nonprofit that
promotes entrepreneurship in the
Middle East and North Africa, fol
lowed Ghonim's talk. Hassanein
discussed stimulating economic de
velopment in Egypt and highlighted

initiatives to improve healthcare, ed
ucation and employment.
After Ghonim and Hassanein
finished their presentations, Omar
Shakir 'O7, J.D. 'l3 moderated a
Q& A session where audience mem
bers asked Ghonim about ways to
help from abroad, the role of politi
cal parties in the revolution and Is
lamic fundamentalism. The session
also broached the topics of the Cop
tic minority, safety in Egypt, de
tained protestors and bloggers and
current uprisings in other Arab na
tions.
Ghonim responded by empha
sizing the agency of the individual
protestors, condemning sectarian vi
olence and urging his audience to
focus on the future.
"I am pro 'communicating with
everyone'... there's an extremism
that I think is just as bad as religious
extremism, refusing to talk to [reli
gious extremists]," he said."Let's ed
ucate them, and let's be educated
about them. It's time to be tolerant
and educate ... criticize, criticize
strongly, but respect them as human
beings."
Audience member Samar
Alqatari 'l4 expressed her apprecia
tion for Ghonim's talk.
"I thought he was very charis
matic, a bit idealistic ... but I think
that he has the potential to do what
he's advocating for," she said.
"It was great when he told us how
we could help and contribute,"
Alqatari added. "Just being inspired
by a leader like that helps us become
leaders of our communities."
MSAN President Mai El-Sadany
'll was also inspired by the talk.
"Everyone I spoke to, whether
they were Muslim, non-Muslim,
Arab or non-Arab, got a lot out of
it," she said. "It was great to hear
from someone with firsthand expe
rience what we can do to affect
democracy in the Middle East."
