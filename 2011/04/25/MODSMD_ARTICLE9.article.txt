## California passes renewable energy bill 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
With the passage of Senate Bill 2X
(SB 2X) on April 12, public and private
utilities in California will be required to
obtain 33 percent of their electricity
from renewable resources by the year
2020. The law has been received posi
tively by several Stanford experts, in
cluding Steve Eglash, a member of the
Precourt Institute for Energy and the
executive director of the Environment
and Affiliates Program.
SB 2X builds on regulation passed
in 2006, which requires utilities to have
20 percent of their power come from
renewable resources by the end of
2010, a figure that currently stands at 18
percent but is expected to be 20 per
cent by the end of 2011.
Accompanying California Gov
ernor Jerry Brown at the signing of
SB 2X were Secretary of Energy
Steven Chu and State Senator Joe
Simitian (D-Palo Alto), the author of
the bill. In a press conference, Chu
said the law would "unleash clean
energy innovation and clean-energy
investments," while creating eco
nomic benefits.
He also commented on the recent
finalization of a $1.6 billion federal
loan guarantee from the U.S. Depart
ment of Energy to Bright Source En
ergy to help with their massive solar
thermal project in the Mojave Desert.
Chu announced another nearly $1.2
billion loan to help a different solar
energy facility, California Valley Solar
Ranch project, sponsored by Sun-

Power Corp., which will be located
mainly in San Luis Obispo County.
Chu also mentioned the joint con
sortium between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley that will "develop and test
new technologies aimed at improving
solar [photovoltaic] performance and
bringing down manufacturing cost."
Commenting on the implications of
SB 2X, Eglash acknowledged that
though the program would cost more
in the short term, it would lower costs
and provide other benefits in the long
run.
"As individuals and as a society, we
make decisions all the time that aren't
based on the absolute lowest cost but
are made by weighing the intangible
benefits," Eglash said.
He noted that many of the costs of
non-renewable power are not included
in the bill's final figure, such as pollu
tion costs or involvement in oil-rich
areas overseas.
Brown publicly stated that the bill
would make California a new leader
for renewable resources and praised
Simitian for authoring such an innova
tive bill. He cited the bill as an example
of overcoming the partisan divide that
exists in Sacramento over the Califor
nia budget.
"We have something that is a real
success story," Brown said.
The bill will help fulfill the require
ments of AB 32, signed in 2006 by then-
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
which includes a commitment to re
duce greenhouse gases to 1990 levels
by 2020.
"I believe that a decade from now,
when we have hit 33 percent by 2020,
we will look back on this day and say,
'Look at what California has done,'"
Simitian said at the press conference.
Because the bill has the force of
law behind it, Eglash said it would be
effective in its goal of reducing green
house gas emissions.
"I think [SB 2X] will undoubtedly
be effective, both at increasing Cali
fornia's use of renewable energy and
also at creating jobs," he said.
Eglash said jobs would be created
through the construction of new ener

gy plants, research and maintenance
spurred by SB 2X.
Opposition to the bill largely
stems from its economic cost, with
many senators objecting that there
would not be significant economic
gains. Safeway Stores, which is the sec
ond-largest employer in California,
opposed the bill, citing economic con
cerns.
State Senator Roderick Wright
(D-Inglewood) said the bill could cost
California $1.5 billion and claimed
that the bill would raise California's
energy prices, which are already 18 to
20 percent higher than the national
average, according to the California
Manufacturers and Technology Asso
ciation.
Brown, however, is confident
about the law's future.
"It's California leading the coun

try, and it's America potentially lead
ing the world," he said.
