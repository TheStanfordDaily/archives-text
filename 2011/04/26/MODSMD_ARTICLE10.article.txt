## I HAVE TWO HEADS In Defense of Procrastination 
### Rachel Kolb 
It's impossible to give 100 percent
to every task, 100 percent of the
time. For me, this truth begins to
sink in around the middle of each
quarter. As a perfectionist and as
someone who has a difficult time
saying no (two descriptors that I
suspect apply to many other Stan
ford students), my inability to put in
a top effort, every time, for every
thing I do, sometimes distresses me.
The math itself is distressing
enough: say 65 percent of my time
and energy go toward being a full
time student, but my extracurricu
lar would like as much as 40 per
cent and my friends at least 20 per
cent. And then factor in internships
and future planning and random
tasks, plus the nagging feeling that
it's never enough, that I should be
doing more wait, where does
that leave any time for me? We're
already over 100 percent, and the
last time I checked, no amount of
idealism can counteract the fact
that time machines don't exist.
This is where, like any sane col
lege student, I've learned about a
handy little trick: procrastination.
Now, this may seem counterintu
itive: if I'm already pressed for time,
why make my situation worse by
putting anything off? I'm already
cramming too much into my day,
feeling upset that that paper didn't
reflect my best effort or that I was
n't able to participate fully in class
because I was too tired. But if I get
too wrapped up in these things, if I
declare that the next paper will
knock my professor's socks off even
if I have to refuse food and stay up
for three nights to do it, I'm only
putting my life further out of bal
ance.
Let me clarify what I mean: pro
crastination, when used in a healthy
way, can restore some of the life bal
ance that might be lost if we devot
ed ourselves wholeheartedly to any
one task like our (or, at least, my)
perfectionist tendencies tell us to.
Face it: the expectations at Stanford
can be so high that, if we take one
thing too seriously, it can consume
us. Establishing constraints through
procrastination, paradoxically, can
be a useful tool for leading those
well-rounded lives we all say we'd
like to have. If I give myself an en
tire week to work on that paper,
guess what? It'll take the entire
week. I'll get caught up in deliberat
ing whether I've read enough,
whether I sound smart enough,
whether I really need that comma
or if I should take it out. My con
cerns start out as valid but then spi
ral down to the slightly absurd. On
the other hand, if I give myself a
shorter time frame to work on the
same paper, it'll take a shorter
amount of time and it'll get done
regardless. Things almost always
seem to, if only in a nose-under-the
wire kind of way.

The funny thing is, I wasn't a pro
crastinator before Stanford. If any
thing, I frowned upon it. But pro
crastination is more complex than
its reputation might suggest. It's not
just watching You Tube videos or
wasting time on Facebook. It can
also come in the more insidious
form of lower-priority things that
need to get done eventually, or that
simply boost my happiness. On Sat

urday afternoons, I procrastinate by
solving laundry crises. I clean my
room. I walk the Dish. I answer
emails. The ulterior motive behind
all of this lovely life organization is
that voice in the back of my head
that moans, "I don't want to do my
homework!" but at the end of the
day, I've put myself in a better mind
set for working than if I'd chained
myself in the library for eight hours.
A two-hour heart-to-heart with a
friend: procrastination? Yes. Neces
sary for being human? Also yes.
The problem, then, is not only
learning how to productively pro
crastinate (talk about an oxy
moron), but learning how much we
can procrastinate and still finish
everything that we need to. It's a
fine balance between giving myself
so much time that I become lack
adaisical (and thereby waste more
time) and really putting something
off until it's too late to do it well.
This is a game I play: where is the
line to which I can procrastinate
and still sleep a reasonable
amount? To which I can procrasti
nate and enjoy that weekend with a
friend, or also accomplish tasks
xyz? Finding this balance, I think, is
part of what we mean when we talk
about time management.
One of my friends once joked
that she'd come to Stanford to
major in procrastination. In some
ways, that's not far from the truth.
College, in forcing us to juggle more
commitments and responsibilities
than we've had before, also forces
us to learn to compartmentalize our
lives. By setting boundaries on
things, by accepting that one class or
activity isn't world shattering and
that our self-worth rests on the big
ger picture that we forge for our
selves, we enable ourselves to attain
a better sense of perspective. We
might not be giving 100 percent of
ourselves to any one task, but we're
preserving our priorities and mak
ing sure that the time we do give re
ally does matter.

While Rachel doesn't want to major
in procrastination, she's considering
getting a minor in it. Send her your
advice on this decision at

Procrastination is
more complex
than its reputation
might suggest.
