## The
						Humanities at Stanford 
### PHILIPPE BUC Professor, Department of History 
There is much in the air this year about the
place of the humanities at Stanford and
about the optimal place of the humanities
in an undergraduate education. First, there is no
gainsaying that despite its nationally recognized
quality, and despite real sympathy for it on the
part of many non-humanist colleagues, the hu
manities faculty is not at the center of Stanford's
life far from it. Enrollments have been declin
ing for decades, and we humanists are sometimes
taken to task by the University leadership for
failing to counter this trend the expression of
a nation-wide trend in a university that is further
more situated in the holy land of technology, Sil
icon Valley. Second, there is no debate either that
our students find burdensome the piling up with
in the first year of freshmen seminars, IHUM and
PWR. Many would rather jump immediately
into the usually massive requirements of the ma
jors they want to pursue, be they pre-medical or
engineering. Each issue calls for a blunt com
ment. First, Stanford has to decide whether it
wants to be "CalTech North" or comparable to
our East Coast peers say, Harvard, Yale and
Princeton. If we want more majors in the human
ities, the faculty should offer undergraduate

courses more attractive to 17-21-year-old Amer
ican students, and a little less attractive, perhaps,
to its individual boutique research interests.
More fundamentally, deans and provosts should
get the enrollments in the humanities that the ad
mission process deserves input in, output out.
Only a small minority of high school applicants
to Stanford (I have heard 15 percent) intends to
pursue the humanities. This figure is an iron bar
rier to higher enrollments. Given that Stanford
very much gets to choose which students it ad
mits, an admission process that would, from the
start, earmark a yield of, say, 40 percent self-de
clared humanists would result in a larger number
of freshmen with humanities focuses coming to
us. The quality of the freshman class would not go
down, since we take in about 1,700 freshmen out
of a deep pool of about 35,000. Stanford should
stop moping about declining enrollments and
stop trying to increase numbers by tinkering
with, e.g., humanities departments' open houses,
wine and cheese or flashy hires. These tricks can
have only a marginal impact. Stanford, rather,
must seize the bull by the horns. Unless, of
