## The 						Humanities at Stanford 
### PHILIPPE BUC Professor, Department of History 
There is much in the air this year about the
place of the humanities at Stanford and
about the optimal place of the humanities
in an undergraduate education. First, there is no
gainsaying that despite its nationally recognized
quality, and despite real sympathy for it on the
part of many non-humanist colleagues, the hu
manities faculty is not at the center of Stanford's
life far from it. Enrollments have been declin
ing for decades, and we humanists are sometimes
taken to task by the University leadership for
failing to counter this trend the expression of
a nation-wide trend in a university that is further
more situated in the holy land of technology, Sil
icon Valley. Second, there is no debate either that
our students find burdensome the piling up with
in the first year of freshmen seminars, IHUM and
PWR. Many would rather jump immediately
into the usually massive requirements of the ma
jors they want to pursue, be they pre-medical or
engineering. Each issue calls for a blunt com
ment. First, Stanford has to decide whether it
wants to be "CalTech North" or comparable to
our East Coast peers say, Harvard, Yale and
Princeton. If we want more majors in the human
ities, the faculty should offer undergraduate

courses more attractive to 17-21-year-old Amer
ican students, and a little less attractive, perhaps,
to its individual boutique research interests.
More fundamentally, deans and provosts should
get the enrollments in the humanities that the ad
mission process deserves input in, output out.
Only a small minority of high school applicants
to Stanford (I have heard 15 percent) intends to
pursue the humanities. This figure is an iron bar
rier to higher enrollments. Given that Stanford
very much gets to choose which students it ad
mits, an admission process that would, from the
start, earmark a yield of, say, 40 percent self-de
clared humanists would result in a larger number
of freshmen with humanities focuses coming to
us. The quality of the freshman class would not go
down, since we take in about 1,700 freshmen out
of a deep pool of about 35,000. Stanford should
stop moping about declining enrollments and
stop trying to increase numbers by tinkering
with, e.g., humanities departments' open houses,
wine and cheese or flashy hires. These tricks can
have only a marginal impact. Stanford, rather,
must seize the bull by the horns. Unless, of

course, we are reconciled with be
coming "CalTech North."
Second, in recalibrating under
graduate education and the place of
the humanities in it, Stanford
should not forget its duties to
America. The cliche is true that by
virtue of its strengths (and of the
pre-existing social capital of many
admitted students), Stanford pro
duces "leaders." With power and
privilege come responsibilities. If
we produce leaders in their fields
who do not have a good grasp of
fundamental issues those issues
that the humanities and softer so
cial sciences (e.g., economics and
political science) debate and teach
we will have provided America
with influential graduates who will
not understand the world beyond
their specialized training, and, as
citizens, will vote and contribute
money without finesse to causes.
The question is not to inculcate in
our students the "right" values
(force-feeding will engender reac

tions). It is not primarily relevant
whether our students will end up
Republicans or Democrats. What is
relevant is that they be subtle par
ticipants in the life of the nation
smart and subtle Republicans or
Democrats. Thus, whether 18-year
olds like it or not in the moment,
they should be exposed to good
courses in the humanities. To re
peat, to educate students in this hu
manistic manner is a duty. For Stan
ford to ignore it is to make a Stan
ford education a mere product fa
cilitating vocational careers, and a
product sold and bought.
These two issues are distinct but,
if faced as suggested above, will
come together. More students fo
cusing on the humanities will
change the atmosphere and make
issues of responsibility and clear
sightedness in political action more
evident to others. A sense that Stan
ford cares about its responsibilities
will make it more attractive to hu
manists. "CalTech North?" A pres
tigious label without duties at
tached? Your choice, our choice.
