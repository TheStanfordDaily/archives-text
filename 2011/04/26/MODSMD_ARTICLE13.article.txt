# FRESHLY BAKED
## Mere Exposure 
### Tim Moon 
Before this year, I wasn't a huge
fan of chips. I mean, they were
good, but they weren't some
thing I went out of my way for, and I
never had them around. When I
moved into my house this year, I was
able to ignore the bags of chips
stocked in our open kitchen for a
while. But as the year went on, the
constant supply of chips kept tempt
ing me, and I'd sneak a Barbecue
Pop Chip here, a Hawaiian Maui
Sweet Onion Chip there. Now, every
time I go down to get a drink of
water, I can't help myself from tak
ing one or two of those addictive
Tapatio Fritos, maybe following up
with a Nancy's Pita Chip.
Some might say this is just me
having less self control. I prefer to
think of it as the mere exposure ef
fect in action. No, I'm not making
this up; the mere exposure effect is
scientific and everything. It says that
people tend to develop preferences
for things merely by being exposed

to them often, so in my case, my new
found attraction to chips was obvi
ously due to the fact that the chips
kept exposing themselves to me. It's
all on them.
Of course, those chips would
never have come into my life if I had
n't chosen to draw into Jerry, so
maybe it is on me a little. Unfortu
nately, I have to graduate and won't
be able to enter the Draw this year
and draw into a place where I won't
be tempted by chips, but for all you
freshmen, sophomores and juniors,
what a fun, sexy time for you! (Well,
if you're not drawing Tier 3.) You get
to choose who you want to live with;

you get to fantasize about life in a
shiny new dorm/house; you get to
rank things.
You're also choosing who you're
going to be hanging out with next
year, in away. For most people, the
dorm/house is going to be a place
where you spend a lot of time. You
sleep there, do work there, play there
and eat there. So does everyone else
in the dorm, so you're going to see
these people pretty often. You might
have a lot of friends living in other
houses that you can visit and eat or
study with, but are you really going
to do that every night, especially
when it's raining and cold? Probably
not. So you eat in your house, you
talk to whoever's there and you be
come friends (or at least become
friendly) with them.
Bam! Mere exposure effect!
Well, sort of. Merely being exposed
to the same person in your house
