# FRESHLY BAKED
## Mere Exposure 
### Tim Moon 
Before this year, I wasn't a huge
fan of chips. I mean, they were
good, but they weren't some
thing I went out of my way for, and I
never had them around. When I
moved into my house this year, I was
able to ignore the bags of chips
stocked in our open kitchen for a
while. But as the year went on, the
constant supply of chips kept tempt
ing me, and I'd sneak a Barbecue
Pop Chip here, a Hawaiian Maui
Sweet Onion Chip there. Now, every
time I go down to get a drink of
water, I can't help myself from tak
ing one or two of those addictive
Tapatio Fritos, maybe following up
with a Nancy's Pita Chip.
Some might say this is just me
having less self control. I prefer to
think of it as the mere exposure ef
fect in action. No, I'm not making
this up; the mere exposure effect is
scientific and everything. It says that
people tend to develop preferences
for things merely by being exposed

to them often, so in my case, my new
found attraction to chips was obvi
ously due to the fact that the chips
kept exposing themselves to me. It's
all on them.
Of course, those chips would
never have come into my life if I had
n't chosen to draw into Jerry, so
maybe it is on me a little. Unfortu
nately, I have to graduate and won't
be able to enter the Draw this year
and draw into a place where I won't
be tempted by chips, but for all you
freshmen, sophomores and juniors,
what a fun, sexy time for you! (Well,
if you're not drawing Tier 3.) You get
to choose who you want to live with;

you get to fantasize about life in a
shiny new dorm/house; you get to
rank things.
You're also choosing who you're
going to be hanging out with next
year, in away. For most people, the
dorm/house is going to be a place
where you spend a lot of time. You
sleep there, do work there, play there
and eat there. So does everyone else
in the dorm, so you're going to see
these people pretty often. You might
have a lot of friends living in other
houses that you can visit and eat or
study with, but are you really going
to do that every night, especially
when it's raining and cold? Probably
not. So you eat in your house, you
talk to whoever's there and you be
come friends (or at least become
friendly) with them.
Bam! Mere exposure effect!
Well, sort of. Merely being exposed
to the same person in your house

over and over probably isn't going to
make you love them if everything
they do annoys the heck out of you
and you think they're the worst per
son in the world. But for everyone
else in your house, as you keep see
ing them and as you keep going to
house events with them and as you
keep having dinnertime conversa
tions with them, you'll start to figure
out who you like hanging out with
more than others, who you share the
most in common with.
Of course, that doesn't mean you
would have a 100-percent compati
bility rating or anything like that;
they might be the best match for you
in your house, but in a world of al

most seven billion people, there's al
most certainly someone out there
who would be a "better" match.
Heck, even just at Stanford, there
are probably people you haven't had
the chance to meet who you'd prob
ably really like. When it's put that
way, it seems pretty unfair that
something that's mostly out of your
hands like housing assignments can
have a significant influence on who
your friends are, a pretty big aspect
of who you are.
But I think that while we already
recognize this, we also don't really
care as much as we could, because
it's almost impossible to walk
around here without bumping into
someone awesome. Maybe that
super cool kid in your hall isn't 100-
percent compatible with you, but
he's still pretty super cool, as are
mostofthepeopleinthehall.Asyou
keep seeing them and getting to

know them, you might end up being
pretty happy that you ended up
where you did.
And regardless of what happens
in the Draw, try to make the most of
wherever you end up next year. Go
to dorm events, leave your door
open,go to meals and talk to people!
I'm apartment hunting myself right
now, and it's making me realize how
much I'm going to miss living with a
whole house of fascinating people
and regret the times that I didn't
take advantage of it.
And don't fight the mere expo
sure effect. You can't beat science.
Especially when science is in the
form of Tapatio Fritos.

Tim needs to find healthy snacks as
tasty as Tapatio Fritos to expose him
self to so that he can wean himself off
of those devil sticks. Send him your fa
vorites at timmoon@stanford.edu.
