## BATS BEAT BEARS Offense keys Stanford victory 
### DANIEL BOHM DESK EDITOR 
After rallying for four runs in
the ninth inning on Saturday for a
much-needed series win against
UCLA, the Stanford baseball team
carried its momentum into Mon
day's nonconference showdown
with No. 20 Cal. The No. 21 Cardi
nal (20-13, 5-7 Pac-10) controlled
the game from the get-go and
cruised to a 9-5 victory.
Sophomore center fielder Jake
Stewart had three hits, four RBI
and two runs scored to lead a Car
dinal offense that pounded out 13
hits in the win. Stewart and senior
catcher Zach Jones hit back-to
back singles to start the bottom of
the first, meaning nine straight Car
dinal hitters had reached base over
the course of two games seven
consecutive Stanford batters got
on base with two outs in the final
inning of Saturday's walk-off win.
The streak ended with a Tyler
Gaffney strikeout, but Stewart and
Jones successfully completed a

double steal before being singled
home by sophomore third base
man Stephen Piscotty, beginning
the onslaught.
Stewart believes he is crucial to
the team's sometimes-middling of
fense.
"As a leadoff hitter, I take it
upon myself to get on base every
single at-bat," Stewart said. "That's
not always possible, but I do what
ever I can to get on base, especially
with hitters like Kenny
Diekroeger, Piscotty and Gaffney
behind me."
With the loss, Cal dropped to
24-13, but still boasts a 9-6 record in
conference.
Stanford's top starter, sopho
more Mark Appel, got the start on
the hill as yesterday would normal
ly be his throw day between week
end starts. Appel went just one per
fect inning. He was followed by
junior Brian Busick (1-0), who
picked up the win, striking out
three and allowing three hits in

three shutout innings. Freshman A.J.
Vanegas followed with two innings
of one-hit baseball of his own.
Getting Busick back from injury
could be crucial down the stretch for
Stanford, a point noted by Stewart.
"To see Busick come back and
perform well he pitched great
tonight is great," Stewart said.
"It's huge to get another arm."
Leading 3-0, the Cardinal broke
the game open with two more runs
in the bottom of the fourth. Follow
ing one-out singles by freshman
right fielder Brian Guymon and sen
ior designated hitter Dave Giuliani,
Stewart drove a Kevin Miller pitch
down the left-field line for a two-
RBI double.
Miller (5-3), a senior, entered the
game as one of Cal's top pitchers
with a 1.38 ERA and 58 strikeouts in
52.1 innings, but took the loss yester
day, as the Cardinal knocked him
around to the tune of eight runs
(seven earned) on 11 hits in 5.1 in
nings.
Jones noted the importance of

beating Cal, even in a nonconfer
ence game, with a pitcher like Miller
on the mound.
"They are a good team with a
great conference record, even after
being swept by Arizona State,"
Jones said. "It's always good to beat
a quality team, especially with their
starter who had a one-something
ERA coming into the game."
Stanford extended its lead to 8-0
in the bottom of the sixth. Stewart
followed a Guymon walk and a Giu
liani double with another two-RBI
double to chase Miller. Jones then
greeted junior reliever Joey
Donofrio with a line-shot up the
middle, scoring Stewart.
Jones continued to hit well for
the Cardinal, going 2-for-4 with a
walk, two runs scored and an RBI,
while Giuliani did his part to solidify
his place in Stanford's revolving
door at the designated hitter posi
tion. The New Jersey native went 2-
for-3 with three runs scored.
After a rough start to the season,
Jones has made necessary adjust
ments and they've shown at the
plate.
"I just kept working hard and
made a few mechanical adjustments
I needed to make and a mental ad
justment," Jones said. "I had to stop
digging a hole for myself and dig my
self out of it."
Cal finally got on the board in the
top of seventh on a three-run homer
by freshman designated hitter
Michael Theofanopoulos.That came
off Stanford's fourth pitcher of the
game, sophomore Dean McArdle,
who has struggled of late and lost his
spot as Stanford's Sunday starter.
Cal head coach Dave Esquer ap
parently wasn't happy with his
team's at-bats, as he decided to
pinch hit for four of his starters in
that seventh inning.
Trailing 8-3, the Golden Bears
made it a little interesting in the top
of the eighth. Shortstop Derek
Campbell led off with a line-drive
single over shortstop, which was fol
lowed by a seven-pitch walk of left
fielder Dwight Tanaka by Cardinal
junior lefty Scott Snodgress. After a
strikeout, junior first baseman
David Buscovich inside-outted a
single between third and short to
load the bases. Snodgress was then
able to induce a sacrifice fly and a
groundout to limit the damage to
one run.
Freshman right fielder Austin
Wilson, who came on as a defensive
replacement two innings earlier, sin
gle-handedly created a run in the
bottom of the eighth. Wilson
sprayed a single to right to lead off
the inning, then advanced to second
on a passed ball and showed off his
speed, scoring from second on a wild
pitch.
Cal mustered a run off Stanford's
junior closer Chris Reed in the
ninth, but it was not enough to bring
the Golden Bears back.

After rallying for four runs in
the ninth inning on Saturday for a
much-needed series win against
UCLA, the Stanford baseball team
carried its momentum into Mon
day's nonconference showdown
with No. 20 Cal. The No. 21 Cardi
nal (20-13, 5-7 Pac-10) controlled
the game from the get-go and
cruised to a 9-5 victory.
Sophomore center fielder Jake
Stewart had three hits, four RBI
and two runs scored to lead a Car
dinal offense that pounded out 13
hits in the win. Stewart and senior
catcher Zach Jones hit back-to
back singles to start the bottom of
the first, meaning nine straight Car
dinal hitters had reached base over
the course of two games seven
consecutive Stanford batters got
on base with two outs in the final
inning of Saturday's walk-off win.
The streak ended with a Tyler
Gaffney strikeout, but Stewart and
Jones successfully completed a

double steal before being singled
home by sophomore third base
man Stephen Piscotty, beginning
the onslaught.
Stewart believes he is crucial to
the team's sometimes-middling of
fense.
"As a leadoff hitter, I take it
upon myself to get on base every
single at-bat," Stewart said. "That's
not always possible, but I do what
ever I can to get on base, especially
with hitters like Kenny
Diekroeger, Piscotty and Gaffney
behind me."
With the loss, Cal dropped to
24-13, but still boasts a 9-6 record in
conference.
Stanford's top starter, sopho
more Mark Appel, got the start on
the hill as yesterday would normal
ly be his throw day between week
end starts. Appel went just one per
fect inning. He was followed by
junior Brian Busick (1-0), who
picked up the win, striking out
three and allowing three hits in

three shutout innings. Freshman A.J.
Vanegas followed with two innings
of one-hit baseball of his own.
Getting Busick back from injury
could be crucial down the stretch for
Stanford, a point noted by Stewart.
"To see Busick come back and
perform well he pitched great
tonight is great," Stewart said.
"It's huge to get another arm."
Leading 3-0, the Cardinal broke
the game open with two more runs
in the bottom of the fourth. Follow
ing one-out singles by freshman
right fielder Brian Guymon and sen
ior designated hitter Dave Giuliani,
Stewart drove a Kevin Miller pitch
down the left-field line for a two-
RBI double.
Miller (5-3), a senior, entered the
game as one of Cal's top pitchers
with a 1.38 ERA and 58 strikeouts in
52.1 innings, but took the loss yester
day, as the Cardinal knocked him
around to the tune of eight runs
(seven earned) on 11 hits in 5.1 in
nings.
Jones noted the importance of

beating Cal, even in a nonconfer
ence game, with a pitcher like Miller
on the mound.
"They are a good team with a
great conference record, even after
being swept by Arizona State,"
Jones said. "It's always good to beat
a quality team, especially with their
starter who had a one-something
ERA coming into the game."
Stanford extended its lead to 8-0
in the bottom of the sixth. Stewart
followed a Guymon walk and a Giu
liani double with another two-RBI
double to chase Miller. Jones then
greeted junior reliever Joey
Donofrio with a line-shot up the
middle, scoring Stewart.
Jones continued to hit well for
the Cardinal, going 2-for-4 with a
walk, two runs scored and an RBI,
while Giuliani did his part to solidify
his place in Stanford's revolving
door at the designated hitter posi
tion. The New Jersey native went 2-
for-3 with three runs scored.
After a rough start to the season,
Jones has made necessary adjust
ments and they've shown at the
plate.
"I just kept working hard and
made a few mechanical adjustments
I needed to make and a mental ad
justment," Jones said. "I had to stop
digging a hole for myself and dig my
self out of it."
Cal finally got on the board in the
top of seventh on a three-run homer
by freshman designated hitter
Michael Theofanopoulos.That came
off Stanford's fourth pitcher of the
game, sophomore Dean McArdle,
who has struggled of late and lost his
spot as Stanford's Sunday starter.
Cal head coach Dave Esquer ap
parently wasn't happy with his
team's at-bats, as he decided to
pinch hit for four of his starters in
that seventh inning.
Trailing 8-3, the Golden Bears
made it a little interesting in the top
of the eighth. Shortstop Derek
Campbell led off with a line-drive
single over shortstop, which was fol
lowed by a seven-pitch walk of left
fielder Dwight Tanaka by Cardinal
junior lefty Scott Snodgress. After a
strikeout, junior first baseman
David Buscovich inside-outted a
single between third and short to
load the bases. Snodgress was then
able to induce a sacrifice fly and a
groundout to limit the damage to
one run.
Freshman right fielder Austin
Wilson, who came on as a defensive
replacement two innings earlier, sin
gle-handedly created a run in the
bottom of the eighth. Wilson
sprayed a single to right to lead off
the inning, then advanced to second
on a passed ball and showed off his
speed, scoring from second on a wild
pitch.
Cal mustered a run off Stanford's
junior closer Chris Reed in the
ninth, but it was not enough to bring
the Golden Bears back.
