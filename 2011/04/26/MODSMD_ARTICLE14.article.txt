## BATS BEAT BEARS Offense keys Stanford victory 
### DANIEL BOHM DESK EDITOR 
After rallying for four runs in
the ninth inning on Saturday for a
much-needed series win against
UCLA, the Stanford baseball team
carried its momentum into Mon
day's nonconference showdown
with No. 20 Cal. The No. 21 Cardi
nal (20-13, 5-7 Pac-10) controlled
the game from the get-go and
cruised to a 9-5 victory.
Sophomore center fielder Jake
Stewart had three hits, four RBI
and two runs scored to lead a Car
dinal offense that pounded out 13
hits in the win. Stewart and senior
catcher Zach Jones hit back-to
back singles to start the bottom of
the first, meaning nine straight Car
dinal hitters had reached base over
the course of two games seven
consecutive Stanford batters got
on base with two outs in the final
inning of Saturday's walk-off win.
The streak ended with a Tyler
Gaffney strikeout, but Stewart and
Jones successfully completed a

double steal before being singled
home by sophomore third base
man Stephen Piscotty, beginning
the onslaught.
Stewart believes he is crucial to
the team's sometimes-middling of
fense.
"As a leadoff hitter, I take it
upon myself to get on base every
single at-bat," Stewart said. "That's
not always possible, but I do what
ever I can to get on base, especially
with hitters like Kenny
Diekroeger, Piscotty and Gaffney
behind me."
With the loss, Cal dropped to
24-13, but still boasts a 9-6 record in
conference.
Stanford's top starter, sopho
more Mark Appel, got the start on
the hill as yesterday would normal
ly be his throw day between week
end starts. Appel went just one per
fect inning. He was followed by
junior Brian Busick (1-0), who
picked up the win, striking out
three and allowing three hits in
