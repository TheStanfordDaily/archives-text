# CARDINAL DROPS SERIES TO CAL
## 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball had its seven
game win streak snapped over the
weekend, losing two of three in close
contests to archrival Cal in Berkeley.
The losses drop No. 10 Stanford
back to .500 in conference play (6-6)
and 32-10 overall. No. 12 Cal moves to
30-9 on the year and 7-5 in the Pac-10.

Despite solid pitching in the series,
the Cardinal bats struggled to convert,
stranding 22 baserunners over the se
ries while only scoring three runs in
three games.
Thursday's opening tilt was a micro
cosm of the series. Sophomore Teagan
Gerhart pitched well, allowing just one
earned run on four hits, but still got
tagged with the loss. Cal's Jolene Hen
derson gave up five hits but no runs to
get the complete game shutout win,
moving to 26-5.
The Golden Bears took an early
lead in the first after loading the bases.

Senior starter Ashley Chinn pitched four strong innings in Friday's matchup with Cal, earning the win. It was
Stanford's only win of the series, though, as the Cardinal offense managed just three runs in three games.
Designated player Ashley Decker
drew a walk to give Cal a 1-0 lead.
Gerhart got Victoria Jones to pop
out to end the inning, limiting the
damage.
The Cardinal threatened in the
top of the second, as freshman des
ignated player Danielle Miller led
off with a double and advanced to
third on sophomore second base
man Jenna Rich's single. But Hen
derson was able to retire the next
three Cardinal batters to escape the
inning.
The top of the third followed the
same pattern, with Stanford failing
to make good on a leadoff single by
Gerhart.
With the score still 1-0 in favor of
Cal, Stanford looked to take the
lead in the sixth, loading the bases
but failing to score. Freshman left
fielder Corey Hanewich and junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen singled
with one out, and Miller reached on
an error to load the bases. But Hen
derson was able to wriggle out of
the jam, getting the next two Cardi
nal batters to pop out.
Cal catcher Lindsey Ziegenhirt
hit a solo home run in the bottom of
sixth to make the score 2-0, the
same way it would end.
Stanford battled back to even
the series on Friday, winning a close
2-1 game that saw both teams load
the bases in the final inning without
scoring. Senior starter Ashley
Chinn allowed one run and three
hits over four innings to get the win,
pushing her to 15-2 on the year.
Gerhart pitched three innings of
one-hit ball to get the save, her third
of the year.
The Cardinal scored both its
runs in the top of the first. Junior
center fielder Sarah Hassman led
off with a single and then stole sec
ond. Hansen moved her over to
third on a single, and with two outs,
Rich reached on an error by Cal
first baseman Alex Robben, scoring
both Hassman and Hansen.
The Bears responded in the bot
tom of the inning, with shortstop
Britt Vonk scoring on a fielder's
choice. Cal eventually loaded the
bases, but Chinn got two straight
outs to end the inning.
In the seventh, both teams
loaded the bases without doing any
damage. Stanford was unable to
capitalize on an error by Cal center
fielder Frani Echavarria. Gerhart

escaped her inning by turning a
comebacker into a double play to
end the game.
Gerhart was back in the circle
Saturday, but was less successful in
her rubber match start, taking the
loss to fall to 17-8. Gerhart was re
placed by Chinn in the fourth after
giving up a two-run home run. Cal's
Henderson got the win, making her
the pitcher of record for all three
games and moving her to 27-6 on
the year.

Cal once again scored in the bot
tom of the first, as Berkeley third
baseman Jace Williams singled in
left fielder Jamia Reid.
In the fourth, Stanford couldn't
convert singles by Hanewich and
Rich, leaving two runners in scoring
position.
Cal made it 3-0 in the bottom of
the frame on a two-run shot by right
fielder Elia Reid. Stanford re
sponded by bringing in Chinn to
finish the inning. She allowed a run
in the fifth to make it 4-0, as Cal des
ignated player Ashley Decker hit a
sacrifice fly to center.
Hansen spoiled Cal's shutout
bid in the sixth, when she hit her
conference-leading 20th double of
the season to plate Hanewich.
Stanford never stopped fighting,
loading the bases on a two-out rally
in the seventh. But Hansen flied out
to end the inning, and the game,
with the final score at 4-1.
Stanford looks to start a new win
streak today as the team travels to
UC-Davis, a school Stanford has
beaten twice already this year. The
Cardinal follows that up this week
end with its final homestand of the
year against Washington.

finish the inning. She allowed a run
in the fifth to make it 4-0, as Cal des
ignated player Ashley Decker hit a
sacrifice fly to center.
Hansen spoiled Cal's shutout
bid in the sixth, when she hit her
conference-leading 20th double of
the season to plate Hanewich.
Stanford never stopped fighting,
loading the bases on a two-out rally
in the seventh. But Hansen flied out
to end the inning, and the game,
with the final score at 4-1.
Stanford looks to start a new win
streak today as the team travels to
UC-Davis, a school Stanford has
beaten twice already this year. The
Cardinal follows that up this week
end with its final homestand of the
year against Washington.

Stanford
battled back to
even the series on
Friday, winning a
close 2-1 game.
Stanford Softball had its seven
game win streak snapped over the
weekend, losing two of three in close
contests to archrival Cal in Berkeley.
The losses drop No. 10 Stanford
back to .500 in conference play (6-6)
and 32-10 overall. No. 12 Cal moves to
30-9 on the year and 7-5 in the Pac-10.

Despite solid pitching in the series,
the Cardinal bats struggled to convert,
stranding 22 baserunners over the se
ries while only scoring three runs in
three games.
Thursday's opening tilt was a micro
cosm of the series. Sophomore Teagan
Gerhart pitched well, allowing just one
earned run on four hits, but still got
tagged with the loss. Cal's Jolene Hen
derson gave up five hits but no runs to
get the complete game shutout win,
moving to 26-5.
The Golden Bears took an early
lead in the first after loading the bases.

IAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Senior starter Ashley Chinn pitched four strong innings in Friday's matchup with Cal, earning the win. It was
Stanford's only win of the series, though, as the Cardinal offense managed just three runs in three games.
Designated player Ashley Decker
drew a walk to give Cal a 1-0 lead.
Gerhart got Victoria Jones to pop
out to end the inning, limiting the
damage.
The Cardinal threatened in the
top of the second, as freshman des
ignated player Danielle Miller led
off with a double and advanced to
third on sophomore second base
man Jenna Rich's single. But Hen
derson was able to retire the next
three Cardinal batters to escape the
inning.
The top of the third followed the
same pattern, with Stanford failing
to make good on a leadoff single by
Gerhart.
With the score still 1-0 in favor of
Cal, Stanford looked to take the
lead in the sixth, loading the bases
but failing to score. Freshman left
fielder Corey Hanewich and junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen singled
with one out, and Miller reached on
an error to load the bases. But Hen
derson was able to wriggle out of
the jam, getting the next two Cardi
nal batters to pop out.
Cal catcher Lindsey Ziegenhirt
hit a solo home run in the bottom of
sixth to make the score 2-0, the
same way it would end.
Stanford battled back to even
the series on Friday, winning a close
2-1 game that saw both teams load
the bases in the final inning without
scoring. Senior starter Ashley
Chinn allowed one run and three
hits over four innings to get the win,
pushing her to 15-2 on the year.
Gerhart pitched three innings of
one-hit ball to get the save, her third
of the year.
The Cardinal scored both its
runs in the top of the first. Junior
center fielder Sarah Hassman led
off with a single and then stole sec
ond. Hansen moved her over to
third on a single, and with two outs,
Rich reached on an error by Cal
first baseman Alex Robben, scoring
both Hassman and Hansen.
The Bears responded in the bot
tom of the inning, with shortstop
Britt Vonk scoring on a fielder's
choice. Cal eventually loaded the
bases, but Chinn got two straight
outs to end the inning.
In the seventh, both teams
loaded the bases without doing any
damage. Stanford was unable to
capitalize on an error by Cal center
fielder Frani Echavarria. Gerhart

escaped her inning by turning a
comebacker into a double play to
end the game.
Gerhart was back in the circle
Saturday, but was less successful in
her rubber match start, taking the
loss to fall to 17-8. Gerhart was re
placed by Chinn in the fourth after
giving up a two-run home run. Cal's
Henderson got the win, making her
the pitcher of record for all three
games and moving her to 27-6 on
the year.

Cal once again scored in the bot
tom of the first, as Berkeley third
baseman Jace Williams singled in
left fielder Jamia Reid.
In the fourth, Stanford couldn't
convert singles by Hanewich and
Rich, leaving two runners in scoring
position.
Cal made it 3-0 in the bottom of
the frame on a two-run shot by right
fielder Elia Reid. Stanford re
sponded by bringing in Chinn to
finish the inning. She allowed a run
in the fifth to make it 4-0, as Cal des
ignated player Ashley Decker hit a
sacrifice fly to center.
Hansen spoiled Cal's shutout
bid in the sixth, when she hit her
conference-leading 20th double of
the season to plate Hanewich.
