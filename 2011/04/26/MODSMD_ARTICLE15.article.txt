# CARDINAL DROPS SERIES TO CAL
## 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball had its seven
game win streak snapped over the
weekend, losing two of three in close
contests to archrival Cal in Berkeley.
The losses drop No. 10 Stanford
back to .500 in conference play (6-6)
and 32-10 overall. No. 12 Cal moves to
30-9 on the year and 7-5 in the Pac-10.

Despite solid pitching in the series,
the Cardinal bats struggled to convert,
stranding 22 baserunners over the se
ries while only scoring three runs in
three games.
Thursday's opening tilt was a micro
cosm of the series. Sophomore Teagan
Gerhart pitched well, allowing just one
earned run on four hits, but still got
tagged with the loss. Cal's Jolene Hen
derson gave up five hits but no runs to
get the complete game shutout win,
moving to 26-5.
The Golden Bears took an early
lead in the first after loading the bases.

Senior starter Ashley Chinn pitched four strong innings in Friday's matchup with Cal, earning the win. It was
Stanford's only win of the series, though, as the Cardinal offense managed just three runs in three games.
