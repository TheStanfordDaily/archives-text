# Life after Luck
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
The NFL Draft begins Thurs
day, and, much to the linger
ing surprise of many, Andrew
Luck will not be the first play
er to cross Radio City Music
Hall's stage. Instead of waiting in the
green room for Roger Goodell to call
his name,he'll be going through the mo
tions of your average college student.
It's midterm season, after all, and Luck
is still on the Farm, having decided to re
main at the helm of the Stanford foot
ball program for another year.
The result? Despite losing half its
starters to graduation, the Cardinal is
viewed widely as a preseason top-10
team. The main justification lies on the
shoulders of its star quarterback: since
Stanford has the top returning player in
the college game, the team has to be
viewed highly. That is not to say that
such prognostications ignore other tal
ent, but it does throw Luck up on a tow
ering pedestal. It's warranted, but if
such an emphasis is being placed on one
player, it begs the question: what hap
pens to Stanford at this time next year,
when Luck will almost certainly be
leaving campus for the NFL?
To answer that, let's look back at
Stanford's rise. It's common to choose
specific personalities, but it's too easy
(and lazy) to give all of the credit to the
three people that most readily come to
mind: Jim Harbaugh,Toby Gerhart and
Luck. Certainly, Harbaugh was a dy
namic if not painfully unique figure
who encapsulated everything that
Stanford football should be trying to do
play physically and with a chip on its
shoulder, and when out on the recruit
ing trail, treat academics as an advan
tage, not a deterrent. Gerhart and Luck
represent two of the best play ers in Car
dinal history at their respective posi
tions the timing of their tenures on
the Farm was fortuitous and should not
be undervalued.
But football, by design, is driven by
more than just a trio of stars. Put Jim
mer Fredette or Kemba Walker on
Stanford's men's basketball team, and I
guarantee you that it finishes near the
top of the Pac-10; such is the power of
the superior athlete in that sport. It's dif
ferent on the gridiron. Sure, Luck and
Gerhart were instrumental in countless
Cardinal victories, but without a sup
porting cast, there's not a whole lot that
even the best quarterback or running
back can do both players, for exam
ple, benefited from superb offensive

lines, without which both would have
suffered. It doesn't take anything away
from Luck or Gerhart; it's merely the
nature of the game.
For proof look no further than
these quotes about a former Stanford
passer. Tell me if he reminds you of any
one:
"[He] has all of the tools to be the
best quarterback in the country. He has
the size, uncanny accuracy and tremen
dous arm strength."
" [He] never gets rattled in the pock
et, and he is always looking downfield
for that receiver to break into the
clear."
Those are quotes from a 2001 USA
Today write-up of Trent Edwards
then a high school senior who quar
terbacked at Stanford from 2002-2006.
He was a five-star recruit and was
ranked higher in2ool than Luck was in
2008. But his collegiate career, which
coincided with the dark ages of Cardi
nal football, did not have nearly the suc
cess that Luck's has had to date. Playing
behind a line that was inconsistent at
best, Edwards was sacked 84 times in 36

games. For comparison. Luck has been
sacked just 13 times over his first 25
contests. Edwards's offensive line was
so porous that, when he was able to
stand upright for an entire game, it was
newsworthy. As one can imagine, the
results were not pretty, and Edwards
suffered serious injuries in three of his
four years as the Cardinal's starter
while never fulfilling the potential he
showed in high school.
To be fair, there are a number of fac
tors that go into a quarterback's success,
and ratings of players when they're 17
don't always translate. But the point re
mains that, without a strong supporting
cast around him, even someone with
Edwards's talent â€”despite a relatively
unsuccessful collegiate career, he still
went in the third round of the 2007
NFL Draft needs people to help
him succeed.
The same goes for Luck, and the
same went for Harbaugh. His recruit
ing success is not nearly as high if he
doesn't have a superb recruiting coor
dinator in Lance Anderson or people
who are notable fantastic on the trail,
such as Willie Taggart or Brian Polian.
While Harbaugh deserves obvious
credit for pinpointing that coaching
talent, it is, and always has been, a
staff-wide effort, even if Harbaugh
was the right character, at the right

time, to lead a revival.
Ultimately, it's the entire cast that
matters, from the principle players to
the ensemble. That's not to say that in
April 2012 Stanford fans should feel
dandy about the upcoming season
no quarterback has come close to so
lidifying an "heir apparent" role, and,
as detailed last week. Luck could be
joined by quite a few of his Cardinal
teammates in the 2012 draft. And no
one knows how David Shaw, his re
assembled coaches or the new Stan
ford starters will do in 2011.
The variables are numerous, and
that's the rub. Life after Luck is not
something I care to envision until ab
solutely necessary, and it is impossible
to overstate the skills of arguably the
most gifted player ever to don a Cardi
nal uniform. But football, more so than
any other team sport, relies on every
one involved with the program. Just
like it's easy to place all of Stanford's
potential 2011 success on Luck's shoul
ders, it is misguided to automatically as
sume that as soon as he leaves, the walls
will come crashing down.
