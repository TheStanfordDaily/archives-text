# Life after Luck
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
The NFL Draft begins Thurs
day, and, much to the linger
ing surprise of many, Andrew
Luck will not be the first play
er to cross Radio City Music
Hall's stage. Instead of waiting in the
green room for Roger Goodell to call
his name,he'll be going through the mo
tions of your average college student.
It's midterm season, after all, and Luck
is still on the Farm, having decided to re
main at the helm of the Stanford foot
ball program for another year.
The result? Despite losing half its
starters to graduation, the Cardinal is
viewed widely as a preseason top-10
team. The main justification lies on the
shoulders of its star quarterback: since
Stanford has the top returning player in
the college game, the team has to be
viewed highly. That is not to say that
such prognostications ignore other tal
ent, but it does throw Luck up on a tow
ering pedestal. It's warranted, but if
such an emphasis is being placed on one
player, it begs the question: what hap
pens to Stanford at this time next year,
when Luck will almost certainly be
leaving campus for the NFL?
To answer that, let's look back at
Stanford's rise. It's common to choose
specific personalities, but it's too easy
(and lazy) to give all of the credit to the
three people that most readily come to
mind: Jim Harbaugh,Toby Gerhart and
Luck. Certainly, Harbaugh was a dy
namic if not painfully unique figure
who encapsulated everything that
Stanford football should be trying to do
play physically and with a chip on its
shoulder, and when out on the recruit
ing trail, treat academics as an advan
tage, not a deterrent. Gerhart and Luck
represent two of the best play ers in Car
dinal history at their respective posi
tions the timing of their tenures on
the Farm was fortuitous and should not
be undervalued.
But football, by design, is driven by
more than just a trio of stars. Put Jim
mer Fredette or Kemba Walker on
Stanford's men's basketball team, and I
guarantee you that it finishes near the
top of the Pac-10; such is the power of
the superior athlete in that sport. It's dif
ferent on the gridiron. Sure, Luck and
Gerhart were instrumental in countless
Cardinal victories, but without a sup
porting cast, there's not a whole lot that
even the best quarterback or running
back can do both players, for exam
ple, benefited from superb offensive
