In a highly competitive match
against No. 4 Northwestern, the No.
7 Stanford women's lacrosse team
battled back-and-forth before
falling in a 12-11 defeat. Northwest
ern, which has won four of the last
five national championships,
clinched the game with only 23 sec
onds to play in the second half.

Midway into the first half, Stan
ford fell behind Northwestern, 3-0.
After the initial rust had worn off
the Cardinal players, the upper
classmen stepped up to bring their
team back into the game. In a four
minute span, goals by redshirt sen
ior midfielder Lauren Schmidt, jun
ior midfielder Emilie Boeri and
senior midfielder Leslie Foard
evened the match at three.
With 5:46 left in the first half,
Shannon Smith, the Wildcats' lead
ing scorer, knocked in a free posi
tion shot to put Northwestern back
on top. As was the case all match
long, the Wildcats' lead was erased
quickly, this time by a shot to the
back of the net by Boeri. Going into
the half, Northwestern led 5-4, but
the fight was not over yet.
The second half provided more
back-and-forth action, as the Cardi
nal fell behind further, 6-4, but then
came back to tie it at 7-7 with 20:04
to play. Goals by sophomore mid
fielder Jacqueline Candelaria, jun
ior defender Catherine Swanson
and Boeri put Stanford back into
the fight against the Wildcats. A
goal by sophomore midfielder Car
olyn Bradley with 11:28 left to play
ended a three-goal streak by North
western and cut the Wildcat lead to
10-8.

The last eight minutes of the
match proved as intense and nerve
wracking as the rest of the game.
After a quick goal by the Wildcats
pushed their lead back to three on
Stanford, the Cardinal refused to
quit. Schmidt put another goal in
the back of the net to make the
score 11-9 with 7:52 left.
A Wildcat turnover gave senior
attacker Sarah Flynn space to fire a
shot behind the NU goalkeeper
Brianne LoManto and leave Stan
ford trailing by just one. Minutes
later, Foard scored for a second
time to bring Stanford all the way
back to a tie at 11-11 with 1:33 to
play.

After Foard's goal, the Wildcats
gained possession off the draw and
held on for one final shot. Smith,
who scored seven goals in the game,
set up her teammate Alex Frank,
who captured the lead with only 23
seconds left in what turned out to
be the game's decisive goal.
The game against Northwestern
wrapped up Stanford's regular sea
son. Next up for the Card is the
MPSF Tournament, hosted at St.
Mary's. The top-seeded Cardinal
will play Cal in the semifinal on Fri
day at 1 p.m. in Moraga, Calif.
