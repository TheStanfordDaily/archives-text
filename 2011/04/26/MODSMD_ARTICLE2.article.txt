### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the Nominations Com
mittee (NomCom) is an essential
part of the ASSU, the committee
and its purpose is not widely
known among the general student
population. The members of next
year's committee have recently been
nominated and are awaiting confir
mation from the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC).
According to the NomCom page
on the University website, the seven
selected members are charged with
"interviewing and nominating stu
