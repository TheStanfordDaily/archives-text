## Nom Com candidates announced Final approval awaits Senate, GSC vote 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the Nominations Com
mittee (NomCom) is an essential
part of the ASSU, the committee
and its purpose is not widely
known among the general student
population. The members of next
year's committee have recently been
nominated and are awaiting confir
mation from the Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC).
According to the NomCom page
on the University website, the seven
selected members are charged with
"interviewing and nominating stu
dents as voting members to Univer
sity committees." NomCom is re
sponsible for acting as a "filter" to
determine suitable candidates for
these positions, but University com
mittee leaders ultimately get the last
say in appointments.
According to NomCom member
Branden Crouch 'l4, the Board of
Trustees committee positions are the
most important.
Dan Fuentes 'l2 said the nomi
nated undergraduate students are
Deepa Kannappan 'l3 and Otis
Reed 'l2 for the Academic Policy,
Planning and Management commit
tee; Reagan Thompson 'l2 and
Mercy Bell 'l2 for the Alumni and
External Relations committee; Vi
neet Singal 'l2 and Elijah Frazier 'l2
for the Development committee;
Jesus Espinoza 'l2 and Shahryar
Malik 'l2 for the Finance committee
and Ernestine Fu 'l2 and Norian
Watson 'l3 for the Land and Build
ings committee.
The nominated graduate stu
dents are Subhan Ali and Rebecca
Johnson for the Academic Policy,
Planning and Management commit
tee; Agnieszka Czechowicz and
Annie Kadavy for the Alumni and
External Relations committee;
Michael Tubbs for the Development
committee and Stephen Comello
and Agnieszka Czechowicz for the
Land and Buildings committee.
All students who aspire to be se
lected for these positions must first
go through an extensive interview
process with NomCom. Students
first show their interest through an
online application and then, if select
ed, appear before the committee of
seven for an interview, Crouch said.
The committee then selects a few in
dividuals to be interviewed again by
the heads of the committees they
want to join.
"We nominate students who best
represent the mindset of most of the
student body and will present an un
biased opinion," Crouch said. "These
students are applying for very im-
portant positions with the University,
and we look for an honest voice."
More important even than how
the student is represented on paper is
the intangible aspects of their person
ality that make them the right fit for
the committees.
"A lot of what goes into our deci
sion to nominate a person is based on
the interview itself,'' said Andrea Hin
ton 'l4, another NomCom member.
"We look for a solid background, but
personability, eye contact and good
interview skills show us that you are
the type of person who will work well
on a University committee."
Students who are selected for
Board of Trustees positions may not
be involved in submitting proposals,
but are involved in researching the
opinions of the student body and pre
senting their findings to the Board as
it makes decisions. Placement on
these committees can be highly selec
tive, as NomCom selects just two un
dergraduate and two graduate stu
dents out of a pool that can include
upwards of 50 applicants. After Nom-
Com makes its recommendations,

the University committee leaders se
lect one undergraduate student and
one graduate student.
Students are permitted to apply
for more than one position, but Nom-
Com makes the decision as to which
position, if any, best fits a given stu
dent.
Much like the students they se
lect, NomCom members must first go
through an interview process to be
come involved in the committee.
"We had to apply, get interviewed
and then be confirmed by the ASSU
in a very official process," Hinton
said.
The time commitment required
from each of the members of Nom-
Com is dependent on the number of
applications received and interviews
required to make an informed nom
ination to the committees. During
the selection of Board of Trustees
nominees, the commitment amount
ed to about three to four consecutive
hours of interviews per week. Even
so, the seven members, who are ap
pointed every academic year, find
their work rewarding.
"We have to make very serious
decisions, but we have a lot of fun as a
group," Hinton said.
