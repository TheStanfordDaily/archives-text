# Pell Grants face overhaul
## Program spared in 2012 budget but changes remain on horizon 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
With plans to reduce Pell
Grants and job-training programs
in the 2012 federal budget, the ini
tial student response toward aid
cutbacks has been one of alarm.
But some student financial aid ex
perts argue that the pressure of aid
reduction may prompt changes
that could, in the long run, increase
the overall cost-effectiveness of

the Pell Grant program.
According to the College
Board's 2010 Student Aid Trend
Report, Pell Grants make up about
18 percent of the total undergradu
ate aid. Other sources of under
graduate aid come from state
grants, institutional grants, federal
loans, private and employer grants,
federal work study and federal ed
ucation tax credits and deductions.
A significant fraction of Stan
ford students rely on the Pell Grant

for aid; in the 2009-10 academic
year, 17 percent of Stanford stu
dents received Federal Pell Grants.
Although financial aid provides
does assist students who need it,
School of Education associate pro
fessor Eric Bettinger said the
amount of aid may not have as
large an influence on students' de
cisions to stay in college as previ
ously thought.

"We do know money affects
students' decisions," Bettinger

said. "When we give aid to stu
dents, it increases the likeliness of
students staying in college. Howev
er, the real issue that needs to be
addressed is that the size of these
effects is relatively small. About a
$l,OOO increase in aid correlates to
a 3 percent [increased likelihood]
that the student stays in college in
just that one year. And that's the
best case scenario."
One reason for the limited influ
ence of the Pell Grant is that the
grant fails to close the large college
attendance gap between low-income
and high-income students.
A tightened budget could moti
vate reforms of the Pell Grant pro
gram over a longer timeframe, de
spite current fears of cutbacks.
Bettinger outlined three strate
gies for tackling the issue of improv
ing the cost-effectiveness of the pro
gram. The first strategy called for re
defining the eligibility conditions for
Pell Grant recipients.
"The current eligibility condi
tions don't really push students to
wards graduation," Bettinger said.
"Redefining what exactly a full-time
student is perhaps having them
take a certain number of units this
will help increase student retention
and encourage students to graduate
on time."
In addition to revising the eligibil
ity requirements for Pell Grant re
cipients, a second issue that must be
addressed is re-appropriating the
grants to give the most possible to
those in greatest need.
"We have to find ways to target
the grant better," Bettinger said.
"Even within the grant recipients,
there is a large gap in incomes. We
need to identify students with
greater need and increase their
awards accordingly while reducing

superfluous funding going toward
those who may not need it as much."
In the 2008-09 academic year, 41
percent of Pell Grant recipients were
dependent on their parents for sup
port. Among this group, 61 percent
of recipients came from families with
incomes of $30,000 or less.
The final point Bettinger pro
posed was simplifying the Free Ap
plication for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA), an approach that has al
ready been attempted but could be
further streamlined.
"The financial data used to deter
mine Pell Grant eligibility is quite
small only around six pieces of in
formation," Bettinger said. "And yet
the FAFSA form requires the listing
of about 120 items, making it difficult
for families to fill out properly. Ask
ing people for just those critical
pieces of information would make it
a lot easier for parents."
As schools nationwide brace
themselves for another onslaught of
across-the-board budget cuts, Bet
tinger emphasized the importance of
optimizing federal financial aid pro
grams.
"It's always easier to create a pro
gram than it is to change or destroy
it," Bettinger said. "We're moving to
ward the era of political budgets that
are going to cut back on spending.
With tighter budgets, it's more im
portant than ever to push students
especially those at community
colleges and give them more in
centive to finish college."
