# Pell Grants face overhaul
## Program spared in 2012 budget but changes remain on horizon 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
With plans to reduce Pell
Grants and job-training programs
in the 2012 federal budget, the ini
tial student response toward aid
cutbacks has been one of alarm.
But some student financial aid ex
perts argue that the pressure of aid
reduction may prompt changes
that could, in the long run, increase
the overall cost-effectiveness of

the Pell Grant program.
According to the College
Board's 2010 Student Aid Trend
Report, Pell Grants make up about
18 percent of the total undergradu
ate aid. Other sources of under
graduate aid come from state
grants, institutional grants, federal
loans, private and employer grants,
federal work study and federal ed
ucation tax credits and deductions.
A significant fraction of Stan
ford students rely on the Pell Grant

for aid; in the 2009-10 academic
year, 17 percent of Stanford stu
dents received Federal Pell Grants.
Although financial aid provides
does assist students who need it,
School of Education associate pro
fessor Eric Bettinger said the
amount of aid may not have as
large an influence on students' de
cisions to stay in college as previ
ously thought.

"We do know money affects
students' decisions," Bettinger

said. "When we give aid to stu
dents, it increases the likeliness of
students staying in college. Howev
er, the real issue that needs to be
addressed is that the size of these
effects is relatively small. About a
$l,OOO increase in aid correlates to
a 3 percent [increased likelihood]
that the student stays in college in
just that one year. And that's the
best case scenario."
