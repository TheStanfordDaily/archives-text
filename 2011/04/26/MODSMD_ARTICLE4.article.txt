## Gordon-Levitt tells Farm to 'hit record' 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt, best
known for his starring roles in recent films "Incep
tion" and "(500) Days of Summer," visited Stan
ford Law School on Monday afternoon to discuss

his creative approach to filmmaking through his
website hitßECord.org.
During his talk, entitled "Copyright, remix and
the art of collaborative media," Gordon-Levitt,
who asked to be referred to as "Regular Joe," an
swered questions posed by Law School professor
Anthony Falzone and by members of the audi
ence.
The Law School setting was appropriate, as
much of the talk focused on the unique challenges
that hitßECord faces as a community of "remix
artists" who are committed to a "spirit of sharing,"
which in the past has been viewed by the tradition
al media industry as illegal. As a for-profit compa
ny, hitßECord is constrained in its ability to use
popular songs or even Google images in any of its
works, as all projects must be completely original.
"I've been an actor since I was a kid, but I was
feeling more and more like I wanted to make my
own things," Gordon-Levitt said. "This site started
out as a personal philosophy of making a
metaphor out of a record button."
The production company that is run through
the website launched in 2005, "before You Tube
was big," and was designed to facilitate the process
of filmmaking in a collaborative atmosphere, he
said. More accurately described as a "collabora
tive production company," hitßECord allows
artists from around the world to upload images,

Gordon-Levitt shared his thoughts and fielded
questions on collaborative media as it relates to
hitRECord.org, a website and company he founded
to facilitate collaborative filmaking.
lines of poetry, stories and music to
the site to create unique projects
that can be elaborated upon by all
site members.
"I really appreciate that his com
pany is collaborative in the true
sense of the word," said Pearly
Meixsel *l4. "He literally only con
tributes his acting and his voice to
the projects and allows anyone with
the willingness and the creativity to
contribute whatever they will."
As an example of his recent
work, Gordon-Levitt showed the
audience a short film titled "Mor
gan M. Morgansen's Date With
Destiny."
He explained that the film came
about after "an Irish girl wrote the
short story and people liked it."
"I acted in it and did voiceovers,
others made drawings and videos
and over 40 people from around
the world contributed the sounds
of their instruments to a score
composed by another site mem
ber," he said.
Gordon-Levitt also elaborated
on his unique approach to the film
making process, since many law
students and filmmakers in atten
dance were particularly interested
in the copyright issues that his
form of production spurred.
"HitßECord gets nonexclusive
rights to use the stories on the site,
but because we want to do busi
ness with the traditional entertain
ment industry, we have to start
from scratch and build something

that gives us the right to sell," he
said.
Some of these films, including
"Date With Destiny," have
achieved enough popular support
to be screened at the Sundance
film festival.
Gordon-Levitt fielded audience
questions ranging from whether he
believed average Americans would
be able to participate in filmmak
ing without Hollywood budgets to
whether he found it difficult to be
involved in the mainstream Holly
wood movie industry while also
working with other actors in the
outsider hitßECord.
The fruition of the project is a
dream come true for the actor, who
prefers not to be called a movie
star, despite his recent box office
successes.
"I'm doing something that's
unique to me, and it's fun," he said.
"I truly love [the acting] I get to do
traditionally, but I also love doing
this."
Gordon-Levitt's refusal to be
come complacent with his current
celebrity status was refreshing for
some audience members.
"It is very cool that Joseph Gor
don-Levitt is taking a departure
from the system and calling out the
industry that he is a part of," said
second-year law student Blake
Masters. "The celebrity factor is
what gets you in the door, but he
proved that he's just a normal per
son."
Gordon-Levitt also spoke at
another event Monday night in
Cubberley Auditorium.
