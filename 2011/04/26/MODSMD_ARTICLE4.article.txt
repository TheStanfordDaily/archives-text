## Gordon-Levitt tells Farm to 'hit record' 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt, best
known for his starring roles in recent films "Incep
tion" and "(500) Days of Summer," visited Stan
ford Law School on Monday afternoon to discuss

his creative approach to filmmaking through his
website hitßECord.org.
During his talk, entitled "Copyright, remix and
the art of collaborative media," Gordon-Levitt,
who asked to be referred to as "Regular Joe," an
swered questions posed by Law School professor
Anthony Falzone and by members of the audi
ence.
The Law School setting was appropriate, as
much of the talk focused on the unique challenges
that hitßECord faces as a community of "remix
artists" who are committed to a "spirit of sharing,"
which in the past has been viewed by the tradition
al media industry as illegal. As a for-profit compa
ny, hitßECord is constrained in its ability to use
popular songs or even Google images in any of its
works, as all projects must be completely original.
"I've been an actor since I was a kid, but I was
feeling more and more like I wanted to make my
own things," Gordon-Levitt said. "This site started
out as a personal philosophy of making a
metaphor out of a record button."
The production company that is run through
the website launched in 2005, "before You Tube
was big," and was designed to facilitate the process
of filmmaking in a collaborative atmosphere, he
said. More accurately described as a "collabora
tive production company," hitßECord allows
artists from around the world to upload images,
