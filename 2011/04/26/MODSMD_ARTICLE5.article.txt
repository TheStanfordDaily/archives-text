## Bio-X, drug company pair up in research Sanofi-Aventis deal shares projects, research fellows 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Bio-X program at Stanford
and Sanofi-Aventis recently an
nounced a collaboration agreement
on biomedical research. A joint com
mittee of Bio-X and Sanofi-Aventis
scientists will determine up to five
projects to fund every year, and re
search fellows will be exchanged be
tween the company and the Universi
ty-
"Practically, we have a structured
agreement with Stanford Bio-X, and
that's the start," said Sylvaine Cases,
director of external innovation for
Sanofi-Aventis. "But for us, this is a ve
hicle to really establish a dialogue and
open Sanofi-Aventis to what is hap
pening at Stanford and vice versa."
The Bio-X program at Stanford fo
cuses on interdisciplinary research
combining the efforts of engineers,
computer scientists, physicists and
other experts on biomedical research
questions. Sanofi-Aventis is a large
pharmaceutical company based in
Paris and New York.
The multi-year move represents an
ongoing effort by Stanford to collabo
rate with industry players, especially in
areas of science and technology. The
medical school research community
has especially strong industry partner
ships.
"Stanford has had a long, long his
tory of entering into collaboration
with companies," said Chris Scott, sen
ior researcher of biomedical ethics at
the School of Medicine. "We've done it
both with pharmaceutical companies,
from small biotech companies on proj
ects that range from drug discovery to
clinical trials. So this certainly isn't a
new arrangement."
The collaboration was spear
headed by the San Diego office of
Sanofi-Aventis, which focuses on
making connections at universities
on the West Coast, and has done so
with a number of academic institu
tions. Of these connections, Stanford
will only be the second to exchange
fellows, after the UC-San Francisco.
"It's something I would have
dreamed of doing when I was a stu
dent a long time ago," said Remi
Brouard, vice president of external
innovation for Sanofi-Aventis.
The collaboration will bring
Sanofi-Aventis' expertise in turning
research into therapies, hopefully
streamlining the process from bench
to bedside.
"We're certainly optimistic be
cause we bring a know-how and
knowledge of translating things, and
so our goal is really to work together
and bring that know-how into proj

ects, and I think Bio-X shares that,"
Cases said. "Everyone wants to turn
things faster for the patient. We real
ly need these."
Stanford's industry relations
have recently come into the spot
light with the current Supreme
Court case against Roche Holding
AG over intellectual property rights
of a jointly claimed discovery relat
ed to HIV diagnostics and with the
medical school's move to declare
conflicts of interests among their
faculty members.
Existing agreements usually
maintain Stanford's intellectual
property rights over the researcher's
rights in discoveries, but they also in
volve incentives for industry, such as
exclusive rights to market the discov
ery or the right to first look at the dis
coveries.
The details of this particular
agreement could not be determined
as Sanofi-Aventis does not discuss
the financial or intellectual property
elements of these contracts and Bio-
X could not comment on the agree
ment.
