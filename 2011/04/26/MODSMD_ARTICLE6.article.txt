## Panel talks Japanese quake 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearly two months after the
Tohoku earthquake, tsunami
and subsequent nuclear acci
dent, scholars came together
Monday night for the first event
in a two-part series about the
disaster.

Panelists at the talk, entitled
"Stanford Public Symposium:
The Great Tohoku, Japan Dis
aster," included Chair of Geo
physics Gregory Beroza, Direc
tor of the Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center Gregory
Deierlein and Center of Inter
national Security and Coopera

tion (CISAC) Fellow Kather
ine Marvel. Pamela Matson,
dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences, moderated the event.
The audience and speakers
engaged in a panel-style con
versation. In addition, Beroza,
Deierlein and Marvel each
gave a brief presentation on
seismology, structural engi
neering and the nuclear disas
ter, respectively.
Beroza detailed the four
shock sequence comprising the
disaster as well as the plate tec
tonics involved in an earth
quake and its aftershocks.
"Unless you were in an air
plane, you witnessed this earth

quake," he said. "In California,
we moved a couple centime
ters, about an inch ... There
was a 7.9 aftershock proba
bly the most obscure 7.9 earth
quake ever."
Beroza stressed the impor
tance of "accurate hazard char
acterizations" in mitigating the
risk of similar "nasty disasters"
in the future.
"This is the first great earth
quake to hit a developed coun
try with modern infrastructure
and cutting-edge earthquake
science and earthquake know
how," he said. "Lessons learned

will be critical to improving the re
silience of other regions, including
California."
Deierlein, meanwhile, spoke
about the structural engineering of
various buildings in Tokyo and
Sendai, Japan hit by the quake.
While some buildings were devas
tated, others especially those that

had been reinforced after previous
shocks were barely damaged.
"Some interesting anomalies
come up," he said. "High-frequency
motion sometimes doesn't have the
damage that we think it might."
He mentioned an April 7 after
shock of 7.4 magnitude intensity as
an example of the constant damage
repair cycle that takes place in earth
quake hotspots such as Japan or Cal
ifornia.
"In Japan, as in the U.S., the chal
lenge is to retrofit the structure so it
survives the next quake," he said.

"It's always a case of balancing our
resources ... Generally, our large
reinforced buildings can survive
tsunamis pretty well, even though
they were only built to survive earth
quakes."
Marvel gave the final talk on the
details of the subsequent nuclear ac
cident.
"While there were explosions at
the nuclear plant, there weren't nu
clear explosions," she said. "As far as
I can tell, the actual structural in
tegrity of the buildings was not com
promise d by the earthquake or
tsunami."

Instead, Marvel explained that
the tsunami knocked out the cooling
system, which caused an accumula
tion of hydrogen gas and a "melt
down" of the nuclear fuel. The
worst-case scenario would have
been a combination of a total core
meltdown as well as a containment
failure. However, she stressed, "this
is all speculative."
Both Marvel and Matson empha
sized the global humanitarian crisis
as opposed to the scientific intrica
cies of the earthquake and tsunami.
"Japan is still facing a devastating
humanitarian crisis as a result of the
earthquake and tsunami, and I find it
sad that much of the media has fo
cused on the nuclear disaster," Mar
vel said. "We shouldn't let our cul
tural obsession with nuclear disas
ters overshadow the crisis."
"For many of us, this cascade of
disasters is past tense, but for mil
lions of Japanese, it's not over, and
it's not going to be over for a while,"
Matson said.
Part two of the symposium takes
place tonight at 7 p.m. in Room 200
of the Hewlett Teaching Center.

Geophysics professor Greg Beroza spoke at Monday's panel on the science
behind the 9.0-magnitude earthquake in Tohoku, Japan. The deadly earthquake
spawned a tsunami and the ongoing Fukushima nuclear crisis.
