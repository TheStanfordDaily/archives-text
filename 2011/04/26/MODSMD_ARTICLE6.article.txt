Nearly two months after the
Tohoku earthquake, tsunami
and subsequent nuclear acci
dent, scholars came together
Monday night for the first event
in a two-part series about the
disaster.

Panelists at the talk, entitled
"Stanford Public Symposium:
The Great Tohoku, Japan Dis
aster," included Chair of Geo
physics Gregory Beroza, Direc
tor of the Blume Earthquake
Engineering Center Gregory
Deierlein and Center of Inter
national Security and Coopera

tion (CISAC) Fellow Kather
ine Marvel. Pamela Matson,
dean of the School of Earth Sci
ences, moderated the event.
The audience and speakers
engaged in a panel-style con
versation. In addition, Beroza,
Deierlein and Marvel each
gave a brief presentation on
seismology, structural engi
neering and the nuclear disas
ter, respectively.
Beroza detailed the four
shock sequence comprising the
disaster as well as the plate tec
tonics involved in an earth
quake and its aftershocks.
"Unless you were in an air
plane, you witnessed this earth

quake," he said. "In California,
we moved a couple centime
ters, about an inch ... There
was a 7.9 aftershock proba
bly the most obscure 7.9 earth
quake ever."
Beroza stressed the impor
tance of "accurate hazard char
acterizations" in mitigating the
risk of similar "nasty disasters"
in the future.
"This is the first great earth
quake to hit a developed coun
try with modern infrastructure
and cutting-edge earthquake
science and earthquake know
how," he said. "Lessons learned
