## Stanford, Indiana, Internet2 create global research network 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
The Clean Slate Program at Stan
ford has paired up with Indiana Uni
versity and Internet 2, a research and
education consortium, to create the
Network Development and Deploy
ment Initiative (NDDI), a partner
ship that aims to provide a network
platform to support global scientific
research.
Under this initiative, the group
plans to create a new Internet 2 serv
ice called the Open Science, Scholar
ship and Services Exchange (OS3E),
which will link groups such as the Gi

gabit European Academic Network
(GEANT) and the Canadian Net
work for the Advancement of Re
search, Industry and Education
(CANARIE).
OS3E will enable researchers to
test new Internet protocols and ar
chitectures and will also allow scien
tists to accelerate research with col
laborators worldwide by facilitating
data exchange.
These platforms will support proj
ects that involve the global exchange
of massive datasets in fields such as
radio astronomy and climate model
ing. The network plans to support the
National Science Foundation's
Global Environment for Network
Innovations (GENI) project as well.
Some services from this project
are expected by fall of 2011.
