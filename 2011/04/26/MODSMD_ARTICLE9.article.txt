## One time at Camp Stanford... 
### Bv ISSRA OMER 
In the middle of the quarter, it
might be difficult to imagine what life
at Stanford would be like if classes
weren't part of the equation. Time could be
spent exploring hobbies, spending time with
friends and basking in the sun during midterms while
students fill Green and Meyer Libraries.
For some, like Leah Karlins 'll, this dream life on
the Farm is real, and it's known as "Camp Stanford."
or more formally, the post-graduation quarter.
"With Camp Stanford, you get to explore
your interests, but in a different way," Karlins
said, adding that the free quarter offers more
time for introspection and relaxation. "It's re
ally amazing."
For seniors like Karlins, Camp Stanford is
a quarter that allows them to enjoy all that
Stanford has to offer outside the formal class
room. Despite having a less rigid schedule, Kar
lins described her quarter as productive both
professionally and socially.
"I've been interning with a nonprofit called
Philanthropedia, which is a cool opportunity
since I plan to go into nonprofit consulting,"
she said. "I am also auditing athletics class
es, reading for pleasure, spending time to
catch up with friends or just going on a
walk."

For many underclassmen, the possibility
of experiencing Camp Stanford is something
to look forward to.
"I feel as though I don't get to explore
Stanford as much as I'd like to," said Jujhaar
Singh 'l4. "Camp Stanford would make it
memorable. I'd do more activities, spend
time with friends that I won't see for a while
and just give back to the Stanford commu
nity."
The post-graduation quarter may
seem too good to be true, but students
can only participate in it on the condi
tion that they have completed all of
their academic requirements.
"For me, it's truly a win-win-win

situation," Karlins said. "My par
ents don't have to pay [for tu
ition]. I get the chance to take ad
vantage of all Stanford has to
offer, and I have the time to ex
plore new interests."
The University also sees value in
the Camp Stanford arrangement, recog
nizing that it could allow students to fully uti
lize campus resources such as the Career Develop
ment Center and the Haas Center for Public Service, ac
cording to Assistant Director of Undergraduate Advising and
Research Lourdes Andrade.
"This [Camp Stanford] is priceless! I have seen nothing but
positive outcomes from students who take a quarter off," An
drade wrote in an email to The Daily.
But what about those students who seek the benefits of
Camp Stanford before senior year?
For students who have not yet completed the graduation
requirements, there is the option of taking a quarter or quar
ters off during their undergraduate careers.
Steven Crane 'll, for example, is a non-traditional
"camper" who decided to take spring quarters off during his
junior and senior years.
Even without problem sets or essays, Crane said a quar
ter off is at least as busy, if not busier, than a quarter with
classes.
"I am more involved with student groups, and I'm both
auditing and TA-ing classes," he said. "Taking a quarter off
has really let me have more a teacher role."
Like Crane, Andrew Nepomuceno, a student with junior
standing who has completed 10 quarters at Stanford, knew
from the start of his freshman year that he wanted to take
time off.
"When you're constantly working on your class work, you
get tunnel vision," he said. "For me, I've had the time to for
mulate my worldview. I've been thinking about my life, in
vestigating Zen and reconsidering my relationships."
To the students who take time off, whether it is
through Camp Stanford or not, the experience can be
well worth it.
"Your times at Stanford are some of the most in
tellectually stimulating, beautiful years of your life,
so why rush your way through them?" Crane said.
