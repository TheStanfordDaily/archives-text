## BRINGING LOVE TO LEPERS 
### KATY STORCH 
Clad in a chocolate-colored
sweatsuit, Black√üerry in hand
and hair pulled back in a "just
got-back-from-the-gym" pony
tail, Palo Alto resident Amy An
tonelli could not have appeared more ordi
nary by local standards if she had tried. But
halfway around the globe, Antonelli is any
thing but ordinary.
Antonelli, a 2007 Center for Social Inno
vation Fellow at the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, is the executive director
of Rising Star Outreach, a nonprofit organi
zation that provides aid to leprosy colonies
in India through monetary, educational and
medical assistance. Ron and Joyce Hansen
'59 now serve as country managing directors
for the organization in India, and under
graduates at Stanford have done volunteer
work for the program.
The project's origins are modest.
Founder Becky Douglas came up with the
idea while sitting at her kitchen table in At
lanta after visiting leprosy colonies in 2002.
Visiting the colonies similarly moved An
tonelli to take action.
"When I saw the leprosy colonies in
India, I could not believe something like
that still existed," Antonelli said.'T felt like
I was in the right place and that helping
these people was the next step for me."
Leprosy is a disease that degenerates
body tissues and causes damage to the
limbs, nerves, skin and eyes. People with
the disease lose the ability to feel in their
affected body parts, causing many of their
injuries and wounds to be self-induced.
But leprosy has a cure. Antibiotics can
generally be used to cure the disease if it is
diagnosed early enough. However, once
the disease sets in to the point of degener
ation, an afflicted person is marked for life.
"There is a social stigma associated with
leprosy; the leprosy-afflicted are flung out
of society and seen as less than human
they feel worthless," Antonelli said, de
scribing the organization's approach as
one that strives to promote self-sufficiency.
"We try to teach these people how to
take care of themselves because that is
what breeds dignity," she added.
The organization takes a three-pronged

approach to serving patients. A boarding
school provides education for the children,
on-site doctors give care and medical assis
tance to people living in the colonies and
the boarding school and monetary assis
tance is given to the adults to become more
independent.
"The school is a kind of oasis," Antonel
li said. "We have 200 children living on the
campus, and most are from the colonies.
But we let other children who do not come
from the colonies in as well."
The boarding school provides opportu
nities for the children of leprosy-affected in
dividuals that were unimaginable a decade
ago and aims to diminish the stigma of lep
rosy. Formerly destined to a fate of begging,
they can now go to school, receive an educa
tion and have a successful future.
The second prong of the program is de
voted to providing medical assistance. Ac
companied by volunteers, doctors treat pa
tients at colonies to clean wounds every
week.
"They end up really seeing the individ
ual and realize that behind the disease is a
person, just like them," she said.
"And for some of the diseased people,
they are being seen and touched as an
equal for the first time," she added.
Meredith Colton 'l3 saw firsthand the
plight of leprosy when she travelled to
India to volunteer with Rising Star Out
reach in the summer of 2009. Colton was
heartbroken when she met an elderly
woman, Theresa, and learned about her
and her husband's struggle with the dis
ease.
"She [Theresa] spoke about how her
own children began treating her husband
and her like animals once they contracted
leprosy," Colton said. "It was so hard to see
this beautiful, kind woman sharing this
story and to realize that this was one of the
first times she had ever been able to talk
about everything that had happened to her
to someone who cared."
The third and final initiative of Rising
Star Outreach is called microlending,
which involves loaning small amounts of
money to people in the colonies, enabling
them to start their own businesses.
"The biggest difference between a beg
gar and a person with this opportunity is
that the latter has a sense of dignity and

worth now," Antonelli said. "They sudden
ly begin to believe they have something to
give and something to offer to people."
Colton described one of the various
constructive and therapeutic approaches to
microlending that she witnessed in fndia.
"There was an art studio where the eld
erly people of the colony would paint
and then sell their art to make money," A
she said, describing one particular
painter, Dhamoudaran, whom she j SJ
loved to watch paint. "He used his
hands creatively to make up for JMJ
the havoc leprosy had inflicted on
his limbs." ~
Rising Star Outreach has made sub
stantial achievements since its establish
ment, but Antonelli is determined that
the organization continue to evolve. j
"We need trained teachers who /
are not only good at teaching, but K
can teach others how to teach,"
she said. "And we always need vol- M
unteers. We can find use for any
one's skills or talents, whether you
are a dancer who wants to teach the
kids a dance class, or a plumber who
can install a plumbing system for the
school. Just come over and find a way V
to help heal."
Antonelli spoke with certainty "
when she described how she hopes Ris
ing Star Outreach will be in the
future.
"In 20 years, I don't J
want my job to exist," An
tonelli said. "Because if
we are doing our jobs
right, this project
should be completed
in 20 years. By the
year 2020, we want
the leprosy affect
ed families of
India to become
thriving members
of society."
People can be
come involved in the
program by sponsoring a
online, donating monetarily or volunteer
ing in India.
