## EDITORIAL Create a Public Service GER 
### 
Promoting and encouraging
public service has been part
of Stanford's mission since
its founding. The Founding State
ment notes that a core goal of the
University is "to promote the pub
lic welfare," and an amendment
written by Jane Stanford declares
that students are given an educa
tion "in the hope and trust that
they will become thereby of
greater service to the public."
This emphasis on service exists
today, and it is evident in recent
changes brought about by students
and administrators alike. The
ASSU Executive hosted a Service
Summit in 2009, for example, and
the University recently remade
Branner into the Public Service
theme dorm.
The Study of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford (SUES), a
broad examination that started
last year and is still in progress,
presents an opportunity to contin
ue the promotion of public service
on campus. The Editorial Board
urges the SUES committee to con
sider a General Education Re
quirement (GER) in public serv
ice, which would both affirm Stan
ford's commitment to service and
have a positive impact on the un
dergraduate experience.
This new GER should be in
cluded within the Education for
Citizenship component of the re
quirements. Currently, students
must take courses in two of the
four subject areas; Public Service
could be added as a fifth area with
out disrupting the rest of the pro
gram. Successful service-based
courses, such as the Community
Writing Project courses within the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR), could serve as excellent
models for additional Public Ser
vice offerings.
But a Service GER should re
flect the broad diversity of public
service, and therefore should not
be limited to academic courses
alone. The Editorial Board sup
ports an alternative method of re
ceiving credit, in which students
could submit a summary of service
work completed either as a sum
mer internship or simply an ex
tracurricular activity. This flexibili
ty would not only facilitate the
transition to the new requirement
but would also increase its appeal
to students.

Some may claim that GERs are
already burdensome, and that by
adding a Public Service require
ment Stanford would be reaching
beyond the academic sphere to in
fluence our actions outside of the
classroom. This is not a convincing
argument, however, for the follow
ing reasons.
First, it is important to remem
ber that we all choose to attend
Stanford and pay tuition in order
to participate in and benefit
from Stanford's conception of a
world-class liberal education. We
may not agree with every compo
nent of the undergraduate pro
gram, but by choosing to spend
four years here we place a great
deal of trust in Stanford's ability to
educate us and to change and
refine educational requirements as
it sees fit.
Second, exposure to new ideas
and new experiences is a funda
mental aspect of a college educa
tion. A Public Service GER fits in
perfectly; it is not a case of over
reaching, but rather an opportuni
ty to stretch ourselves and try
something different. And the re
quirement, as outlined above,
would still be optional students
could choose different ECs in
stead.
Third, it is unfair to paint public
service as completely separate
from the world of academics. It is in
fact closely connected, and a Ser
vice GER would provide unique
real-world experience that would
be beneficial for many students. A
political science student, for exam
ple, could complete a government
internship and gain a type of
knowledge and insight into the
policymaking process that a class
room education simply cannot
simulate.
Beyond these benefits, a Public
Service GER would count toward
the 180 units required for gradua
tion. It could, therefore, make the
difference for some students who
would otherwise come up a few
units short and spare them another
expensive quarter of tuition to re
ceive their degree.
Finally, by tying the Service
GER into the Haas Center and the
Career Development Center
(CDC), it could offer enormous
benefit for students seeking jobs or

internships with non-profits and
government agencies. Many stu
dents struggle to find these types
of positions; despite great efforts
by the Haas Center and the CDC,
such jobs just are not as plentiful
and accessible as those in technol
ogy and consulting.
With a Service GER, the Haas
Center and the CDC would have
access to a list of organizations
that have provided students with
service activities that fulfill the re
quirement. By tracking and coor
dinating with good host organiza

tions, these offices can build their
respective databases and provide
greater support to students seek
ing government or non-profit jobs.
The University is, understand
ably, slow and cautious in making
changes to its undergraduate edu
cation program. But the SUES
provides a clear opportunity to
make substantial improvements,
and the committee has indicated
that it is considering a wide range
of new proposals. The Editorial
Board firmly believes that a Public
Service GER would have a posi
tive impact on undergraduate edu
cation and the Stanford experi
ence as a whole, and we urge the
SUES committee to consider this
proposal.
