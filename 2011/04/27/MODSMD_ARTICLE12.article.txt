## Johnny Omani 
### Johnny Bartz 
It didn't take more than a quick
refresher on Persian Gulf geog
raphy to agree to visit my friend
who is in Oman on the Fulbright
Program. Embarrassingly, I had
never been to the Middle East, so I
relished the excuse and turned my
three-day weekend into seven.
Omani visas are expensive, but I
found a loophole. A U.S. citizen is
granted a free 30-day visa to the
United Arab Emirates, so in Dubai
I cleared immigration and then
turned right back around to catch
my flight to Muscat. In Muscat, I
showed my boarding pass arriving
from Dubai and the visa, and on I
went. This rule only works if you fly
directly from Dubai (no land bor
der crossings).
February was a great time to visit
Oman there was the Tour de
Oman, the Muscat Extreme Sailing
Race, Muscat Festival, not to men
tion beautiful sunny weather akin
to spring quarter at Stanford. The
city of Muscat has much to offer:
markets, palaces, gardens, watch
towers and many miles of beach.
Beach culture in Oman is starkly
different from Rio needless to
say, I was told to leave the speedo at
home. Not that it mattered I just
rolled up my jeans as I searched for
shells and caught crabs in the surf.
Oman is an Islamic society with a
public dress code, and you can for
get about having booze or a ham
sandwich. Women generally wear a
head covering ( hijab ) and beautiful
full-length black dresses. Men wear
long white robes, sandals and the
coolest little cloth hats, which are
finely embroidered with bright col
ors. I awed at how crisply clean the
white robes were amidst the dust,
knowing fully well that my robe
would be caked in dirt and food
stains from my messy eating habits.
Foreigners are not required to com
ply with the dress code; however,
conservative clothing is appreciat
ed.

The highlight of my trip was a
visit to the small town of Nakhal, fa
mous for its hot springs and fort.
There we met Sami and Yasser, who
took us to explore the valleys, or
wadi. Driving through the breath
taking scenery with Arabic music

blaring, life couldn't have been bet
ter.
I almost had heart failure when
Yasser pulled out four green bot
tles, muttering something about
Heineken. Surely I would be going
to jail. I was relieved when I realized
they were just non-alcoholic, straw
berry Fanta-esque "beers." Drinks
and samosas in hand, we walked
past a healing spring that was no
more than a puddle. People with
skin ailments remove their clothes
and bathe in the spring. Needless to
say, I didn't touch the water, or the
clothes strewn about the ground,
which pleasantly reminded me of
home. Instead, I admired an entire
ecosystem of birds, insects and
plants that emanated from this
source of water. Later that night we
bathed in much larger hot springs,
complete with little fish that rasp

dead skin off the body. In a relaxed
stupor, I gazed into the ethereal
night sky, warm water washing away
all my cares.
The gastronomic tourism in
Oman is sensational. Omani cuisine
is distinct, but has elements of
Lebanese, Indian and Pakistani
food, featuring many fresh fruits,
chicken, lamb and fish. At Sami's
house, we ate a traditional lunch, sit
ting in a circle with the men of his
family in the men's lounge area,
which was lavishly decorated with
rugs and tapestries.
Eating with the hands was hard
enough, but an additional complica
tion that I faced was that I am left
handed. The left hand is only used
for bathroom functions; eating, han
dling money, or basically touching
anything with the left hand is in
credibly rude. I embraced the expe
rience and ate the feast like a messy
child, using only my right hand.
The feast consisted of dates,
fruits and tea, followed by the main
course of salad, rice, chicken casse
role with roasted vegetables, grilled
fish and baked pasta. Of course it
became a physical challenge, so I
had to finish everything. Dessert
consisted of caramel-covered
pieces of sweet cake, made with
date honey. I asked Sami if it would
be ok if I moved in next weekend. I
still don't think he quite compre
hended how lavish this feast was to
me, the starving grad student.
What struck me most about my
trip to Oman was the hospitality
and respect given to me, an outsider
genuinely curious and open to learn
about Omani culture. I found that
the problem with traveling is not
missing class, affording plane tickets
or even jetlag; it is the sadness of
leaving behind new friends in a far
away land, not knowing when you
will next return.
Knowing me however, and the
fact that there are coral reefs, sea
turtle breeding areas, camel excur
sions and many areas left unex
plored, it won't be too long.

Do you know a place around here to
get some good Omani food? Johnny
Omani would love to know email

raphy to agree to visit my friend
who is in Oman on the Fulbright
Program. Embarrassingly, I had
never been to the Middle East, so I
relished the excuse and turned my
three-day weekend into seven.
Omani visas are expensive, but I
found a loophole. A U.S. citizen is
granted a free 30-day visa to the
United Arab Emirates, so in Dubai
I cleared immigration and then
turned right back around to catch
my flight to Muscat. In Muscat, I
showed my boarding pass arriving
from Dubai and the visa, and on I
went. This rule only works if you fly
directly from Dubai (no land bor
der crossings).
February was a great time to visit
Oman there was the Tour de
Oman, the Muscat Extreme Sailing
Race, Muscat Festival, not to men
tion beautiful sunny weather akin
to spring quarter at Stanford. The
city of Muscat has much to offer:
markets, palaces, gardens, watch
towers and many miles of beach.
Beach culture in Oman is starkly
different from Rio needless to
say, I was told to leave the speedo at
home. Not that it mattered I just
rolled up my jeans as I searched for
shells and caught crabs in the surf.
Oman is an Islamic society with a
public dress code, and you can for
get about having booze or a ham
sandwich. Women generally wear a
head covering ( hijab ) and beautiful
full-length black dresses. Men wear
long white robes, sandals and the
coolest little cloth hats, which are
finely embroidered with bright col
ors. I awed at how crisply clean the
white robes were amidst the dust,
knowing fully well that my robe
would be caked in dirt and food
stains from my messy eating habits.
Foreigners are not required to com
ply with the dress code; however,
conservative clothing is appreciat
ed.

The highlight of my trip was a
visit to the small town of Nakhal, fa
mous for its hot springs and fort.
There we met Sami and Yasser, who
took us to explore the valleys, or
wadi. Driving through the breath
taking scenery with Arabic music

blaring, life couldn't have been bet
ter.
I almost had heart failure when
Yasser pulled out four green bot
tles, muttering something about
Heineken. Surely I would be going
to jail. I was relieved when I realized
they were just non-alcoholic, straw
berry Fanta-esque "beers." Drinks
and samosas in hand, we walked
past a healing spring that was no
more than a puddle. People with
skin ailments remove their clothes
and bathe in the spring. Needless to
say, I didn't touch the water, or the
clothes strewn about the ground,
which pleasantly reminded me of
home. Instead, I admired an entire
ecosystem of birds, insects and
plants that emanated from this
source of water. Later that night we
bathed in much larger hot springs,
complete with little fish that rasp

dead skin off the body. In a relaxed
stupor, I gazed into the ethereal
night sky, warm water washing away
all my cares.
The gastronomic tourism in
Oman is sensational. Omani cuisine
is distinct, but has elements of
Lebanese, Indian and Pakistani
food, featuring many fresh fruits,
chicken, lamb and fish. At Sami's
house, we ate a traditional lunch, sit
ting in a circle with the men of his
family in the men's lounge area,
which was lavishly decorated with
rugs and tapestries.
Eating with the hands was hard
enough, but an additional complica
tion that I faced was that I am left
handed. The left hand is only used
for bathroom functions; eating, han
dling money, or basically touching
anything with the left hand is in
credibly rude. I embraced the expe
rience and ate the feast like a messy
child, using only my right hand.
The feast consisted of dates,
fruits and tea, followed by the main
course of salad, rice, chicken casse
role with roasted vegetables, grilled
fish and baked pasta. Of course it
became a physical challenge, so I
had to finish everything. Dessert
consisted of caramel-covered
pieces of sweet cake, made with
date honey. I asked Sami if it would
be ok if I moved in next weekend. I
still don't think he quite compre
hended how lavish this feast was to
me, the starving grad student.
What struck me most about my
trip to Oman was the hospitality
and respect given to me, an outsider
genuinely curious and open to learn
about Omani culture. I found that
the problem with traveling is not
missing class, affording plane tickets
or even jetlag; it is the sadness of
leaving behind new friends in a far
away land, not knowing when you
will next return.
Knowing me however, and the
fact that there are coral reefs, sea
turtle breeding areas, camel excur
sions and many areas left unex
plored, it won't be too long.

Do you know a place around here to
get some good Omani food? Johnny
Omani would love to know email
him at jbartz@stanford.edu.
