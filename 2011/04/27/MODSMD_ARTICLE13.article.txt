## Calle classroom: Learning to Walk the Walk Spanish Style 
### Ashley Artmann, '12 ASHLEY ARTMANN, '12 
When I look at my schedule
for my quarter in Madrid,
I still am a bit skeptical of
my seemingly miniscule course
load. Twelve units? Never in my
time at Stanford did I think I would
be taking the minimum. There's al
ways been somewhere between six
and 100 classes that I want to take
each quarter and there's also this
little voice in my head telling me
that to not take classes is to miss an
invaluable opportunity. So, tuning
that voice out here in Spain hasn't
been easy, but each and every day I
am thankful that I've made the de
cision. And no, it's not because I get
to hit the snooze button a few times
flamenco class is making sure
that doesn't happen. It's because
more and more, I am coming to re
alize that the classroom here is not
in a classroom.
Having taken years of Spanish
courses, I fell easily into conversa
tion with my Stanford peers. Most
of us fall in the "learning a second

language" category, meaning we
share the same pronunciation and
word choice problems, as well as a
good humor when things don't
come out as planned. Dinner time
conversations with my host mom,
getting lost in Letras and being
taught how to swing dance in El
Parque de Retiro, pues that has
been a different matter. Malenten
didos become the norm, but so
does the ability to laugh at oneself
and make gestures to make up for
gaps in vocabulary. Many times on
campus, I've caught myself jump
ing on the Stanford bandwagon of
complaint what we're learning
in the classroom doesn't seem to
connect to the real world some
times. Well, here in Madrid, every
moment of the day is a test of what
I've learned and better yet, what I
still need to learn. Yes, the streets
and bars can be a cacophony at
times, but the euphony of complet
ing a conversation in Spanish with
out any completely awkward mo

ments of silence is more notewor
thy than any good letter grade. The
automatic feedback of conversa
tion and the human connection of
conversation are both unparalleled
experiences in my academic ca
reer.
But it's not just the language
that has met me in the calle. The
calle is literally a classroom. I've yet
to have the nerve to start taking
photos of strangers, but people
watching is definitely a part of the
curriculum. The stylish Spaniards
know how to make the sidewalk a
catwalk. Beyond fashion, eaves
dropping on conversation, peaking
at what people are reading in the
Metro and simply observing gives
you enough to fill an entire after
noon. Perhaps my favorite thing
about Madrid is that it is a city built
for walking. With spacious side
walks and tree-laden paseos, you're
bound to run into something won
derful to visit. Madrid boasts over a
hundred museums. One walk can
land you at the Prado, Museo
Thyssen and Caixa Forum. Or you
might stumble onto a hidden treas
ure, like the Casa-Museo de Lope
de Vega. Moreover, there are the
infinite number of plazas to tomar
un cafe con leche or cervesa. You
can't walk two blocks without find
ing a local's hang out. No matter
how much I love the Metro (being
a Las Vegan and never having ex
perienced good public transporta
tion), I make myself walk to wher
ever because I know that I am miss
ing out on so much. Even if drivers
here aren't too pedestrian friendly,

the sights, smells and sounds of the
Madrid city streets have quickly
become my new homework assign
ments.
So really, I feel like I'm still one
of "those" people taking 20 plus
units it's just that I've got 10
units of BOSP: Walking City
Streets on my schedule. And I
know at the end of this quarter, I
won't be complaining that I simply
learned how to the talk the Spanish
talk. I will walk the Spanish walk,
hopefully having had a bit of accent
and style rub off on me. Who
knows? My whole perspective on
Stanford may have changed. Per
haps I've spent too much time in
the classroom and too little in San
Francisco, Yosemite or the even the
streets of Palo Alto. Right now,
however, it's time to turn off my
laptop and hit the calle.
