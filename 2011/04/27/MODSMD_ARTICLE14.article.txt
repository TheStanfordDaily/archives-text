## ROTC at Stanford, Past and Present 
### MILTON SOLORZANO, '07 
The state that separates its scholars
from its warriors will have its think
ing done by cowards, and its fighting
done by fools"- Thucydides.
"I won't give my body to the
war"-David Harris, student body
president 1966-67.
An Air Force brat born and
raised, I am uniquely inter
ested in the debate before
the Faculty Senate on Thursday, but
as one who's also parsed dusty re
ports from our special collections, I
see a bizarre reflection of today's
decision in our past. Where now we
fight two (three?) wars with scant
ado, then we witnessed the burning
of draft cards, student and faculty
protests, sit-ins, guerrilla theatre,
vandalism and violent sentiment.
And yet, the decision before the
Faculty Senate today bears little
change from that facing the Univer
sity in June of 1970 when by a
vote of 439-282-293 (affirm-against
abstain) they confirmed the Sen

ate's decision to terminate academ
ic credit for ROTC. Their choice
was not "to kick out ROTC" just as
today's is not to "bring back
ROTC;" rather, on each occasion
the faculty of an educational institu
tion formally define its relationship
with our nation's civic and military
establishments.
In the decade prior to the first
ROTC debate, the faculty had dou
bled in number to accommodate
students of the "Cold War Universi
ty." In this time, the student body
grew by a third, while private leases
of Stanford's land and a deluge of
federal funding for science, technol
ogy and defense trebled its operat
ing budget (and built such facilities
as the Dish and SLAC). With this
swift and increasingly unmanage
able growth came the creation of
the Faculty Senate in 1968 and sub
sequent devolution of power over
academic affairs.
