## ROTC at Stanford, Past and Present 
### MILTON SOLORZANO, '07 
The state that separates its scholars
from its warriors will have its think
ing done by cowards, and its fighting
done by fools"- Thucydides.
"I won't give my body to the
war"-David Harris, student body
president 1966-67.
An Air Force brat born and
raised, I am uniquely inter
ested in the debate before
the Faculty Senate on Thursday, but
as one who's also parsed dusty re
ports from our special collections, I
see a bizarre reflection of today's
decision in our past. Where now we
fight two (three?) wars with scant
ado, then we witnessed the burning
of draft cards, student and faculty
protests, sit-ins, guerrilla theatre,
vandalism and violent sentiment.
And yet, the decision before the
Faculty Senate today bears little
change from that facing the Univer
sity in June of 1970 when by a
vote of 439-282-293 (affirm-against
abstain) they confirmed the Sen

ate's decision to terminate academ
ic credit for ROTC. Their choice
was not "to kick out ROTC" just as
today's is not to "bring back
ROTC;" rather, on each occasion
the faculty of an educational institu
tion formally define its relationship
with our nation's civic and military
establishments.
In the decade prior to the first
ROTC debate, the faculty had dou
bled in number to accommodate
students of the "Cold War Universi
ty." In this time, the student body
grew by a third, while private leases
of Stanford's land and a deluge of
federal funding for science, technol
ogy and defense trebled its operat
ing budget (and built such facilities
as the Dish and SLAC). With this
swift and increasingly unmanage
able growth came the creation of
the Faculty Senate in 1968 and sub
sequent devolution of power over
academic affairs.
At the time of the decision, the
Vietnam era had steadily eroded
the ROTC's enrollment (from 1100
students in 1956 to 346 in 1970), and
the program had been in con
tention with some faculty for years.
Prominent alumnus David Packard
served as deputy secretary of de
fense, and Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks, who had served on a De
fense Department Committee on
ROTC in September of 1969, was

under consideration for a position
in the department. The University
had signed contracts with each of
the military branches represented,
and had (by statute) accorded
some faculty status and academic
credit to the instructor/command
ers and their courses.
However, deliberations and
negotiations over ROTC's status
came to a sharp point following
news of the invasion of Cambodia
on April 29,1970. Demonstrations
erupted over the war, and violent
protests were met with the first
use of tear gas on campus. On
April 30, President Pitzer asked
the Faculty Senate to consider

"the ROTC question," the Acade
mic Council met May 1, and just
three days after the shooting at
Kent State the Faculty Senate
moved to terminate credit for
ROTC. In the quiet of June, the
Senate and Academic Council fi
nalized their decision.
Stanford has none of this ur
gency today. There is no draft, and
elite schools tend not to populate
the military's peculiar meritocracy.
With wars afoot, we see no riotous
protests or groundswell of patriot
ism on campus at best, Measure
A registered our pointed absten
tion. Tellingly, these poll numbers
remind us of our past: compare

Measure A's support of 2,406-929-
2,117 (44 percent affirm, 17 percent
against, 39 percent abstain) out of
19,535 students (30 percent
turnout), to a pro-ROTC referen
dum taken February 1969 before
the exigencies of Cambodia and
Kent State —2,106-1,397 (60 per
cent affirm, 40 percent against) out
of 11,400 students (also 30 percent
turnout).
In truth, the decision about
ROTC remains a matter of defini
tion. As discussed by the Mann
Commission in June of 1970, it was
then unacceptable to a plurality of
faculty that the program be accord
ed academic standing, that its

cadets be threatened with punitive
enlistment should they leave, that
the purposes of the military and
University were in fundamental
conflict and that ROTC's curricu
lum and student policies infringed
on the University's autonomy.
Today, we debate the censorship of
Wikileaks from cadets, exclusion of
transgender students and the need
for institutional aid if a cadet
should lose her scholarship. All this
has changed, but this moment has
not: the clarification of our institu
tion's relationship with the nation
al establishment.

sequent devolution of power over
academic affairs.
At the time of the decision, the
Vietnam era had steadily eroded
the ROTC's enrollment (from 1100
students in 1956 to 346 in 1970), and
the program had been in con
tention with some faculty for years.
Prominent alumnus David Packard
served as deputy secretary of de
fense, and Vice Provost E. Howard
Brooks, who had served on a De
fense Department Committee on
ROTC in September of 1969, was

under consideration for a position
in the department. The University
had signed contracts with each of
the military branches represented,
and had (by statute) accorded
some faculty status and academic
credit to the instructor/command
ers and their courses.
However, deliberations and
negotiations over ROTC's status
came to a sharp point following
news of the invasion of Cambodia
on April 29,1970. Demonstrations
erupted over the war, and violent
protests were met with the first
use of tear gas on campus. On
April 30, President Pitzer asked
the Faculty Senate to consider

"the ROTC question," the Acade
mic Council met May 1, and just
three days after the shooting at
Kent State the Faculty Senate
moved to terminate credit for
ROTC. In the quiet of June, the
Senate and Academic Council fi
nalized their decision.
Stanford has none of this ur
gency today. There is no draft, and
elite schools tend not to populate
the military's peculiar meritocracy.
With wars afoot, we see no riotous
protests or groundswell of patriot
ism on campus at best, Measure
A registered our pointed absten
tion. Tellingly, these poll numbers
remind us of our past: compare

Measure A's support of 2,406-929-
2,117 (44 percent affirm, 17 percent
against, 39 percent abstain) out of
19,535 students (30 percent
turnout), to a pro-ROTC referen
dum taken February 1969 before
the exigencies of Cambodia and
Kent State —2,106-1,397 (60 per
cent affirm, 40 percent against) out
of 11,400 students (also 30 percent
turnout).
In truth, the decision about
ROTC remains a matter of defini
tion. As discussed by the Mann
Commission in June of 1970, it was
then unacceptable to a plurality of
faculty that the program be accord
ed academic standing, that its

cadets be threatened with punitive
enlistment should they leave, that
the purposes of the military and
University were in fundamental
conflict and that ROTC's curricu
lum and student policies infringed
on the University's autonomy.
Today, we debate the censorship of
Wikileaks from cadets, exclusion of
transgender students and the need
for institutional aid if a cadet
should lose her scholarship. All this
has changed, but this moment has
not: the clarification of our institu
tion's relationship with the nation
al establishment.
