## MIDWEEK MISHAP St. Mary's gets walkoff win 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
In the Stanford baseball team's fifth game in
six days, a walk-off grounder by Saint Mary's
spelled a 3-2 loss for the Cardinal, as it could only
muster one earned run off Gael pitchers.
The loss drops the No. 21 Cardinal to 20-14
(5-7 Pac-10), despite a pitching staff that allowed
five or fewer runs for the sixth straight game.

Saint Mary's (18-18) made the most of two
solo home runs from sophomore Brenden
Kalfus, marking just the seventh and eighth
homers that the Cardinal has given up on the
season. Both of the homers came off sophomore
righthander Dean McArdle, who has started pri
marily on Sundays this season, but instead
pitched four innings in relief of junior starter Jor
dan Pries on Tuesday.
Despite the two dingers off McArdle, junior
closer Chris Reed (2-2) picked up the loss, get
ting the Cardinal out of a bases-loaded jam in
the eighth without giving up a run before surren
dering the winning run on a grounder in the bot
tom of the ninth.
At the plate, Stanford put together seven hits,
but it never strung together more than two in a
single inning. Sophomore third baseman

Stephen Piscotty was the only Stanford player to
come up with more than one base hit.
Down 1-0 in the top of the sixth, senior catch
er Zach Jones got Stanford on the board with a
two-out double. He's now knocked in at least
one run in three straight games.
Saint Mary's quickly responded, with

Kalfus's second home run of the afternoon
and the season in the bottom half of the in
ning.
After Stanford stranded a pair of runners in
the seventh, Piscotty came to the plate in the
eighth with two outs and freshman right fielder
Austin Wilson at first. Piscotty singled into center
field, but a throwing error sent him to second and
scored Wilson from first to tie the ballgame at 2-2.
Yet again, the Cardinal was unable to capital
ize on the runner in scoring position, when a fly
out from sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger ended the inning.
While Stanford survived the bases-loaded
threat by the Gaels in the eighth, it stranded a
runner at second base for the third straight in
ning in the top of the ninth. St. Mary's took full
advantage by putting runners at the corners be
fore junior Markus Melgosa grounded to third.
Piscotty's throw to the plate was late, capping off
the 3-2 victory for the Gaels.
Offensive production will continue to be a
focus for the Cardinal four of Stanford's last
five losses have come in games in which the team
scored two or fewer runs. A possible rallying
point is Jones, who got off to a slow start this sea
son but is now tied for second on the team in
RBI, with 22.
Stanford will now prepare for a three-game
series at No. 9 Arizona State. The Sun Devils
have won 12 of their last 15 games, with the only
losses coming in a three-game sweep at the
hands of Pac-10 leader Oregon State,
