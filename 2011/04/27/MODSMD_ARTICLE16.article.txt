## Tennis opens postseason play 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, several players on
the Stanford men's tennis team will
head down to Ojai, Calif, to compete
in the Pac-10 Championships.
The Cardinal (18-5,5-1 Pac-10) is
riding an impressive 10-match win
ning streak, but it will have to wait
until the NCAA Championships in a
few weeks to defend its streak, as the
Pac-10 Championships are for indi
vidual players and doubles teams.
Most conferences around the
country have an end-of-season team
tournament, but the Pac-10 is differ
ent â€” the team champion is deter
mined by the regular season alone.
USC's 6-0 conference record took the
cake this season, and Stanford came
in second place at 5-1.
The Pac-10 Championships are
part of a huge tournament held annu
ally in Ojai. In addition to the confer
ence individual championships, the
Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament has
several other divisions, and is one of
the nation's most prominent tennis
tournaments.
"Ojai is a very prestigious tourna
ment," said Stanford junior Bradley
Klahn. "It's been going on for a long
time and has a lot of other divisions.
It's not just the Pac-10, but there are
men's and women's open, youth and
small college events. There's just a lot
going on. It's a very cool setting all
of the games are played in a public
park and the town gets really into the
tournament."

Stanford will be sending nine play
ers to Ojai: Klahn, junior Ryan
Thacher, senior Alex Clayton, fresh
men Jamin Ball, Fawaz Hourani and
Daniel Ho, and sophomores Walker
Kehrer, Denis Lin and Matt Kandath.
The players will be divided into
two divisions the Pac-10 Champi
ons draw and the Pac-10 Invitational
draw with both a singles tourna
ment and a doubles tournament with
in each division.
The player everyone will be
watching this weekend is Klahn, who
has historically stepped up his game
in the postseason.
As a freshman, Klahn won both
the singles and doubles draws at the
Pac-10 Championships, pairing with
Thacher to win the doubles title. Last
season, as a sophomore, Klahn won
the NCAA singles championship and
reached the semis in the NCAA dou
bles draw.
Klahn admits he enjoys the post
season and especially the Pac-10
Championships.
"This has been one of my favorite
tournaments over the past few years,"
Klahn said. "I never played it growing
up, even though I had chances to play
in the younger divisions.The ability to
go up there and play for a Pac-10
Championship individually is big in
culminating the regular season and is
a great way for us to build momentum
going into NCAAs as well.
"It's been a tournament that I've
always felt I've played really well at,"
