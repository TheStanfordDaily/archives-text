# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Cardinal captures perfect season 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
With a dominant 17-5 victory
over San Jose State Saturday night,
the Stanford women's water polo
team racked its 23rd straight victo
ry to finish the regular season unde
fcstcd
The No. 1 Cardinal (23-0, 7-0
MPSF) had already clinched the
No. 1 seed in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) Tourna
ment going into Saturday's
matchup with the No. 7 Spartans
(20-11,2-5), and Stanford came out
of the gates firing on all cylinders
after honoring its three seniors be
fore the match.
After just two minutes and thir
ty seconds of play, the Spartans al
ready looked flustered with Stan
ford up 3-0 after goals from sopho
more two-meter Annika Dries, jun
ior two-meter Melissa Seidemann
and junior driver Pallavi Menon.

The Cardinal offensive attack
slowed down for the rest of the pe
riod and a Spartan goal with 40 sec
onds left cut the Cardinal lead to 3-
1.
Stanford then fired back with a
4-0 scoring run started by a
Menon goal that stretched the lead
to 7-1 before giving up a late
goal to the Spartans near the end of
the first half.
After taking a 7-2 lead into the
break, the Cardinal continued to
pad its lead with six goals in the
third quarter.
Dries and Seidemann, the top
two scorers and primary two-meter
players on the team, each finished
the game with three goals. The pair
of hat tricks for the Cardinal's two
leading scorers puts Dries at 51 goals
on the season and Seidemann at 40.
Together, the two have combined to
score nearly a third of the team's 282
goals in the regular season.
"Annika and Mel have been ter
rific in front of the goal at both
ends of the pool," said head coach
John Tanner. "They have comple
mented each other really well. But
we've also gotten solid play from a
lot of people at two meters and two
meter defense."
Going into the fourth quarter,
the Cardinal had a comfortable 13-
3 advantage, and two more quick
goals coupled with an unrelenting
Stanford defense made the score
15-3.
At this point, Coach Tanner had
a unique opportunity to honor the
team's three seniors driver Kim
Krueger and goalies Amber Oland
and Kim Hall. Tanner sent out
Oland as she donned a new No. 16
cap, setting aside her usual No. 1 to
play alongside Krueger and Hall.
"Our seniors have never com
peted together during their four
years," Tanner said. "There was an
opportunity for them to finish their
last game at Avery in the water to
gether, so we put Kim Hall in the
goal and [Krueger] and [Oland] in
the field. Amber has practiced as a
field player some over the past two
years, so it wasn't anything foreign
to her."
The Class of 2011 then closed
out the last few minutes in style, as
Oland notched her first collegiate
goal with 1:20 left in her final game
at home and Hall recorded two
stops in the final period.
"Kim, Kim and Amber have
been great leaders for this year's
team," Tanner said. "They are pas
sionate about water polo and com
petition, and our team has reflect
ed that passion."
Nine different players scored
for the Cardinal against the Spar
tans on Friday and all three goalies
recorded saves, demonstrating
Stanford's most distinguishing trait
headed into the postseason: depth.
"We've used at least 13 people
every game this year, which allows
us to play at a fast tempo and gives
us a lot of options," Tanner said.
With an undefeated regular sea

son and the No. 1 seed going into
the MPSF Tournament this week
end at San Jose State, the Cardinal
is in excellent position to qualify
for the NCAA Tournament.
"MPSF is the toughest tourna
ment in the nation," Tanner said.
"Every game will have NCAA
tournament implications, and we
have no idea who we might match
up with after Friday. But we're fa
miliar with everyone, and we'll be
ready to go."
This coming Friday, Stanford
will kick off the MPSF quarterfi
nals against No. 11 Arizona State at
1:30 p.m. at San Jose State.
The match against the Sun Dev
ils will be the fourth time the two
teams have faced off this season
the Cardinal won the first three by
an average of nine goals. The win
ner will then face the winner of
UCLA and USC on Saturday.
