## Hansen and Gerhart propel softball over UC-Davis 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford softball team
rode a good pitching performance
from sophomore Teagan Gerhart
and a hot night at the plate from
junior Ashley Hansen to blank
UC-Davis 6-0 on Tuesday night.
Gerhart stretched her record to
18-8 by striking out six batters and

only giving up six hits, while
Hansen went 4-for-5 at the plate
with a home run as Stanford (33-
10) beat UC-Davis (19-22) for the
third time this season.
Stanford took the lead in the
top of the first inning, when
Hansen brought home junior
Sarah Hassman with a single, and
Hansen stretched the Cardinal
lead to 2-0 with a solo shot in the
third, her seventh long ball of the
season.
A bases-loaded walk later in the
third gave Stanford a 3-0 lead, and
the Cardinal brought home three
more runs in the top of the fifth,
capitalizing on the fourth UC-
Davis error of the night and an RBI
single from freshman Corey
Hanewich.
The Cardinal returns to the
Farm for its final home Pac-10 se
ries of the year against the Washing
ton Huskies this weekend. Stanford
is 6-6 in conference so far this sea
son.
Stanford and Washington
square off in the first game of a
three-game set on Friday at 7:00
p.m.
