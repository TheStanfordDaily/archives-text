# Playoffs need a draft
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
With the NHL and
NBA playoffs in full
swing, I find one cur
rent series from the
first round of each
sport to be of particular interest. In the
NBA, the eighth-seeded Memphis
Grizzlies have the San Antonio Spurs,
owners of the best regular-season
record in the conference and second
best in the league, on the ropes
Memphis is up three games to one, and
needs just one more win to eliminate
San Antonio.
Over in the (much more watch
able, interesting and exciting) NHL,
the eighth-seeded Chicago Black
hawks had a chance to eliminate the
Vancouver Canucks (winners of the
Presidents' Trophy with the league's
best regular-season record) last night
in Vancouver. After losing the first
three games of the seven-game series,
the Hawks roared back, reeling off
three straight wins and looking like the
hottest team in the game.
It seems that in both of these series,
the top seed got the misfortune of draw
ing the team that happened to get hot at
the right time. Though the Spurs and
the Canucks are probably more talent
ed teams overall, they found them
selves at risk for an early departure at
the hands of opponents they were sup
posed to crush with ease.
This column isn't an argument for
eliminating playoffs in favor of a BCS
style system that simply matches the
regular season champions from each
conference in the finals I am 100 per

cent in favor of the playoffs as they exist,
with eight teams from each conference
dueling it out in seven-game series.
At the same time, I think teams with
better regular season records need to
be rewarded with more that just one
more home game. Teams with high
seeds could have the misfortune of
drawing an extremely hot team, or a
team that came on strong late in the
season due to coaching or personnel
changes. Matching the top seed with
the eighth seed doesn't always create
the best matchup for the top team, even
though the idea behind that system is to
reward the No. 1 seeds with an easier
road to the finals.
So, I propose a "playoff draft" of
sorts, where the highest seeds get re
warded with the opportunity to not

only enjoy home-court or home-ice ad
vantage, but also get to choose their first
round matchup. After playing other
teams in their conference over the
course of the year and studying game
film, coaches know which teams they
will match up well against, and also
have an idea of which team is entering
the playoffs on a hot streak and which
ones are stone cold. The preferred op
ponent might not always be the lowest
seed, so coaches should be free to cre
ate the matchups most conducive to
victory.
The top seed in each conference
would get the opportunity to pick its
matchup, then the second seed would
select out of the remaining teams, and
so on, until all four matchups are set.
In the (admittedly unlikely) event
that the top seed chose the second seed,
then the third seed would get the next
choice, and so on. In order to reward
lower seeds that make it out of the first
round, second-round seeding would be
on the current system, with the top seed

matched against the lowest seed re
maining and the two teams in the mid
dle matched against each other.
This playoff system would give bet
ter rewards to teams with higher regu
lar-season records, while still allowing
lower seeds a chance at a run for a title.
It would prevent the series that happen
every year, where a high seed is pun
ished by drawing a dangerous lower
seed that comes into the playoffs on a
strong run and matches up well against
the higher seed. There are many exam
ples of this phenomenon the one
seared into my head is when the sec
ond-seeded New Jersey Devils got
bounced from the first round last year
by a band of brigands and miscreants
masquerading as a hockey team (aka
the Philadelphia Flyers).

Kabir Sawhney also thinks it'd be fun
to have NBA teams choose to play
against NHL teams, and vice-versa.
