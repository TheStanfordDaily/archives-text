# Playoffs need a draft
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
With the NHL and
NBA playoffs in full
swing, I find one cur
rent series from the
first round of each
sport to be of particular interest. In the
NBA, the eighth-seeded Memphis
Grizzlies have the San Antonio Spurs,
owners of the best regular-season
record in the conference and second
best in the league, on the ropes
Memphis is up three games to one, and
needs just one more win to eliminate
San Antonio.
Over in the (much more watch
able, interesting and exciting) NHL,
the eighth-seeded Chicago Black
hawks had a chance to eliminate the
Vancouver Canucks (winners of the
Presidents' Trophy with the league's
best regular-season record) last night
in Vancouver. After losing the first
three games of the seven-game series,
the Hawks roared back, reeling off
three straight wins and looking like the
hottest team in the game.
It seems that in both of these series,
the top seed got the misfortune of draw
ing the team that happened to get hot at
the right time. Though the Spurs and
the Canucks are probably more talent
ed teams overall, they found them
selves at risk for an early departure at
the hands of opponents they were sup
posed to crush with ease.
This column isn't an argument for
eliminating playoffs in favor of a BCS
style system that simply matches the
regular season champions from each
conference in the finals I am 100 per
