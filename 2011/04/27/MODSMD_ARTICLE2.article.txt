## Officials clarify ASSU standing Students, administrators discuss ASSU-University relationship 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
There's no doubt that the ASSU is a part of
every Stanford student's life every student is a
member, pays fees as a part of tuition and benefits
from the activities funded by these fees. But the
legal standing of the ASSU relative to the Univer
sity lies in a gray area.
Established in 1969, the current ASSU is offi
cially an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit. The
company runs its own finances through Stanford
Student Enterprises (SSE),including managing its
own endowment. The ASSU Constitution section
titled "Independence" states that the ASSU is "a
body independent from control or suspension by
Stanford University" and explicitly denies the
University veto power on legislation that both the
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student
Council approve.
Yet, the unmistakably strong relationship be
tween the ASSU and Stanford is murkier than
pure independence.
"The University and the ASSU work together
on a variety of issues, in many situations, and act as
independent bodies in other situations," wrote
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2 in an email to
The Daily.
The ASSU Constitution itself is a document ac
cepted by both the ASSU and Stanford, and de
fines the relationship between the two parties.This
does, in practice, officially allocate many powers of
the running of the ASSU to Stanford and amend
ments to the contract must be approved through
letters from the University president.
One notable clause regarding the ASSU's inde
pendence came in a May 10,1996 letter from then-
University President Gerhard Casper, which ex
plained the implementation of proposed amend
ments. The letter cites the 1963 Constitution that
allowed the ASSU "to exercise and discharge
major privileges and responsibilities within the
framework of policies and regulations established
by the University through the President of the
University and the Board of Trustees."
This clause both gives the ASSU University
sanctioned authority and obligates it to uphold the
University's established standards. The University
officially gives many rights and privileges to the
ASSU, like providing meeting space, allowing use
of the Stanford name and, perhaps most impor
tantly, allowing the ASSU Nominations Commit
tee (NomCom) to nominate delegates to sit on fac
ulty committees in charge of making University
decisions.
Notably, former ASSU President Angelina
Cardona 'll, former ASSU Senator Deepa Kan
nappan 'l3, Graduate Student Council representa
tive and Ph.D. candidate Justin Brown and at-large
representative Jonathan McMaster 'll attended
Faculty Senate meetings this year. They exercised
speaking rights at the meetings, putting them in the
conversation on major academic and curricular
decisions.
"[NomCom] interviews and places students on
over a hundred University committees to ensure
student voice at all levels of administrative deci
sions," Cardona wrote in an email to The Daily.
"I believe that Stanford has more students on
more University committees than most other insti
tutions I know," said Associate Dean of the Office
of Student Activities Nanci Howe.
Despite the University allowing
the ASSU plenty of direct involve
ment in the University, Casper's
1996 letter expressed some concern
about the ASSU's independence,
stating, "the Board cannot abdicate
its responsibilities under the Found
ing Grant by ceding management

and control in the area of student af
fairs." He referred to the Board of
Trustees' founding duty "to manage
and control the institution hereby
founded."
All in all, the ASSU and Stanford
are two separate companies. But
through contracts, amendments and
day-to-day necessity, the overlap
and sharing of rights can make this
distinction difficult to see.
