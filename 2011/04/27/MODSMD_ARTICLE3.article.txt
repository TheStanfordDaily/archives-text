# United CEO talks at GSB

### JANELLE WOLAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jeff Smisek, president and CEO of
United Continental Holdings Inc., spoke
yesterday at the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) about the challenges of
the airline business and the daunting task
of merging two industry giants like Unit
ed and Continental Airlines.
The event was part of the View from
the Top Dean's Speaker Series, which
brings top leaders from around the world
to share their views on leadership with
GSB students.
"If you like the business of business,
there is no business like the airline busi
ness," Smisek said. "If you like making
money, then it's not for you."
"I'm in a business that hasn't earned
an adequate return since the Wright
Brothers," he added, eliciting laughter
from the audience.
According to Smisek, much of the
problem for the airline business lies with
the exorbitant price of fuel; he said Unit
ed Airlines burns $25,000 worth of jet fuel
every minute.
"We could buy a brand new Airbus
A3BO aircraft and throw it away for the
price of what we spend on fuel," Smisek
said.
On top of this, the airline business has
had to deal with government regulation
that Smisek called "oppressive." Govern
ment taxes on airlines are far greater than
those on either alcohol or cigarettes.
For Smisek, these challenges are ex
actly what attracted him to the airline

business. He excitedly compared United
Airlines to "the other side of the
wardrobe," alluding to C.S. Lewis's "The
Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." He
added that anything could happen at
United, including terrorist attacks, volca
noes, brutally high fuel prices and SARS
outbreaks.
"We're constantly in crisis," said
Smisek. "But you have to remain calm
and collected. You have to be able to
work your way through it."
In addition to this constant stress,
Smisek also had to orchestrate the merg
er between United and Continental air
lines, bringing together more than 87,000
employees to make United Airlines the
largest carrier in the world.
"The most important part in bringing
two carriers together is really cultural,"
Smisek said.
During this process, one of Smisek's
top priorities was to meld the best of both
cultures with an emphasis on respect,
openness and honesty.
"I've always lived my life off what my
mother told me: never tell a lie and treat
other people like you'd like to be treat
ed," he said.
In leading his employees or
"troops," as he calls them Smisek em
phasizes the importance of simple, under
standable mission plans. This way, even
baggage handlers understand how they
fit in and how they contribute to the com
pany's future. Smisek claims that each of
Continental's plans for the past 16 years
