## New Senators take power in ASSU transition Governing power shifts from 12th to 13th Undergraduate Senate 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The members of the 13th Undergraduate
Senate took office on Tuesday night and made
their first decision by electing Senators Rafael
Vasquez 'l2 and Dan Ashton 'l4 to the posts of
Senate chair and deputy chair, respectively. The
transition, however, did not come without its
share of controversy.
Prior to the oath of office, the 12th Under
graduate Senate discussed the constitutionality
of having the new Senate vote on its own budg
et. In the past, the outgoing Senate has been the
one to approve the ASSU budget for the up
coming year.
But with revisions still being made to the
document by the Graduate Student Council
(GSC), the 12th Undergraduate Senate was
unable to vote on the budget by the fifth week
of the quarter, when the ASSU Joint Bylaws
say the transition to the new Senate must take
place.
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2 said the
Executive Committee had an emergency meet
ing over the weekend to review the student
government's Constitution.
"We looked through the Constitution and
the Joint Bylaws, and we didn't find anywhere
where the 12th Undergraduate Senate had to
vote on the budget," Cruz said.
Incoming Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 re
sponded by saying it was not a matter of consti-
tutionality, but one of ethics. In
cluded in the ASSU budget is the
stipend amount for Senate leader
ship positions like chair, deputy
chair, secretary and webmaster.
"This is still a budget that was
written by the previous Senate,"
former Senate Chair Madeline
Hawes 'l3 said. "It only becomes
an issue if you are changing salary
amounts."
Incoming Senator Janani Ra
machandran 'l4 suggested that the
12th Undergraduate Senate isolate
the part of the budget that referred
to the GSC and vote on the rest of
the budget before the transition.
She said this would eliminate the
conflict of interest for the new Sen
ate.
Cruz, however, said that budg
ets could not be split up into differ
ent parts. Constitutional Council
member Deepa Kannappan 'l3
added that the Senate could not
vote on the budget that night in any
form.
"Constitutionally, you have to
put the budget on previous notice
before you vote on it," Kannappan
said. "So we cannot vote on it this
week whether we wanted to or not.
It's not a rule of order. It's in the
Constitution. The GSC would also
have to approve of us suspending
the rule."
Hawes said the only alternative
was voting to suspend the Bylaws,
and delaying the transition a week.
"From my position, it would be
easier to transition next week,"
Hawes said. "But I wanted to stick
with this week because I had al
ready told the Senators that we
were going to transition this week."
Nanci Howe, associate dean of
the Office of Student Activities,
recommended that the 12th Un
dergraduate Senate take an advi
sory vote on the budget to help
guide the upcoming Senate's deci
sion next week.
Hawes motioned Howe's idea.
The 12th Senate voted in favor of
the advisory bill and all outgoing
senators supported approval of the
budget.
ASSU Vice President Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 then said it
was unlikely that the new senators
would make any changes to the
budget, stating that the GSC was
likely to block the approval of the
budget if it was revised.
The 13th Senate was then sworn
into office and unanimously chose
Vasquez, the group's only incum
bent, to be the senate chair. During
the first meeting of its term, the
new Senate discussed a possible re
structuring of its subcommittees.
Earlier in the evening, all funding
bills were passed.
