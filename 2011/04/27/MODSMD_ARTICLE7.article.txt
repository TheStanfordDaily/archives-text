## Administration alters language of nondiscrimination policy 
### BRIANNA PANG SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With relatively little public notice, the
University made several alterations to its
nondiscrimination policy in mid-February.
According to Diversity and Access Office
Director Rosa Gonzalez, the changes to the
Statement on Nondiscrimination Policy
were prompted by a "need" for modification
and clarification and included only technical
and administrative changes.
"The University periodically reviews and
updates its policies, including to meet the re
quirements of currently applicable law,"
Gonzalez wrote in an email to The Daily.
Gonzalez responded on behalf of the Of
fice of the President, the Office of General
Counsel and the Office of the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs.

Administrators did not report the modi
fications to the public.
In response to a question about why the
University chose not to publicize the modi
fications, Gonzalez said it was "likely be
cause [they] were seen as changes that were
largely technical or administrative in nature,
rather than the kind of change that occurred
with the inclusion of gender identity several
years back."
The new statement includes three no
table changes.
The former policy stated that "Stanford
University admits students of either sex and
any race, color, religion, sexual orientation,
or national and ethnic origin to all the rights,
privileges, programs, and activities generally
accorded or made available to students at
the University." The new statement
now includes the term "qualified
students."
"The 'admits qualified students'
language was added into our policy
in 2010," Gonzalez said. "The word
'qualified' was added to conform
with the generally applicable legal
principle that admitted students
must be able to meet essential pro
gram requirements."
Administrators also decided to
add the word "unlawful" to the sec
ond clause of the nondiscrimina
tion policy. The phrase was changed
from "prohibits discrimination" to
"prohibits unlawful discrimina
tion."
However, Gonzalez said the
modification is "clarifying only and
does not represent a shift in the
University's interpretation of its
policy."
"With regard to the addition of
the word 'unlawful,' the phrase
'consistent with its obligations
under the law' has been included in
the University's policy for some
time," Gonzalez said. "This phrase
has been intended to express the
principle that Stanford's obliga
tions under its nondiscrimination
policy are co-extensive with our ob
ligations under the law."
Lastly, University administra
tors modified the end of the state
ment to "broaden" the scope of the
policy. The change was made from
"in the administration of its educa
tional policies, admissions policies,
scholarships and loan programs,
and athletic and other University
administered programs" to "in the
administration of the University's
programs and activities."
"These changes were made in
order to expand the scope of indi
viduals to whom the University's
nondiscrimination policy applies,"
Gonzalez said. "It is no longer lim
ited in its application to students,
applicants and employees, but
rather it now applies more broadly
to participants in the University's
programs generally."
Gonzalez said the "point per
son" for the nondiscrimination pol
icy is the director of the Diversity
and Access Office. However, the
provost is in charge of approving

any changes. The president is
briefed on the changes, but Univer
sity officials did not elaborate on
the role, if any, that the president
plays in updating the policy.
"I approve all policy changes ex
cept those that are in the purview of
the Faculty Senate," Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. 'B2 wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Changes in
wording to clarify existing policies,
like this one, happen all the time.
Substantive policy changes happen
less frequently."
"For example, in the last few
days, at least five policy changes
have been brought to me, two in
volving admissions (one wording,
one substantive), one on faculty
housing, one on faculty leaves, one
about students of newly hired facul
ty," he said. "And I'm probably for
getting others."
The legal implication of the new
wording remains unclear, though
Gonzalez said the Office of Gener
al Counsel was consulted.
"As a practice I confer with the
Office of General Counsel on
changes to policies, but as is the case
with the larger society, the commu
nications between the University's
attorneys and its Stanford clients
are not publicly disclosed," she said.
The last change in the nondis
crimination policy occurred in
2007, when it was updated to in
clude "gender identity." Gonzalez
said student policies in the Stanford
Bulletin are reviewed at least once
a year.
Prior to 2007, the nondiscrimi
nation statement on past Stanford
bulletins remained unchanged as
far back as 2000-01.
Former ASSU President Angeli
na Cardona 'll said she was not
consulted about the modifications.
"It is uncharacteristic of the re
lationship between the ASSU and
the administration to have any
changes go without at the very least
reaching out to the student body
president," Cardona said. "To my
knowledge, they did not reach out
to any students regarding this mat
ter, so I'm surprised and disap
pointed that there was not better
communication on the issue."
"They usually always reach out
to students and student leaders to
engage in dialogue before making
any changes," she added.
