Gyorgy Szapary, Hungarian ambassador to the Unit
ed States, spoke yesterday to a small group of faculty and
students in a roundtable discussion hosted by the Center
of Russian, Eastern European and Eurasian Studies
(CREEES) and the Europe Center.
He discussed Hungary's top priorities as it assumes the
Presidency of the Council of the European Union,
touched on Hungary-U.S. bilateral relations and fielded
questions from the audience. Hungary has held the lead
ership of the Council since January. According to Szapary,
the Hungarian presidency's motto is "a strong Europe
with a human face."
In line with this motto, one of Hungary's top priorities
is to develop a European strategy for the integration of
the Roma people. According to Szapary, the Roma con
stitute 7 to 8 percent of the Hungarian population, and
will make up 20 percent of its workforce by 2020. And yet,
85 percent of the Roma are currently unemployed.
The problem, Szapary said, is that the Roma in Central
and Eastern Europe live mostly in small, isolated country
villages and have no opportunity to "break out" into
Hungarian society.
Szapary believes that the key to integration lies in ed
ucation, perhaps by following a model similar to the
Harlem Children's Zone in New York City. Other solu
tions on the table include "bussing" between villages and
positive discrimination in jobs.
Szapary noted that it is not Hungary's sole responsibil
ity to tackle Roma integration; neighboring countries like
Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia should also be involved.

"If you don't help us to solve the problem here, the
problem will be yours," Szapary said.
As an example, he cited French authorities' expulsion
of Roma from France.
Another top priority is to bring other countries into
the fold of the European Union, particularly with regard
to Croatia. Hungary also hopes to expand the Schengen
Area to include Romania and Bulgaria.
Hungary is actively working to create a unified and ef
ficient European energy market by 2014. Currently, the
country is 100 percent dependent on Russian gas. Its goal
is to change this trend by diversifying sources of gas.
"Hungary proposes to have interconnecting gas lines,"
Szapary said. "This way, if something happens with Russ
ian gas, other countries can help out."
Szapary expressed his pleasure with the "good" rela
tionship between Hungary and the U.S., pointing to Hun
gary's anti-terrorism efforts, its presence in Afghanistan
and Iraq and its support of human rights in Cuba.
He cited one example in which the U.S. Department of
State asked him to arrange for a few American citizens to
fly on a Hungarian flight out of Libya. Although the U.S.
did not end up needing Hungarian help, the fact remains
that the Hungarian government responded almost imme
diately with a resonant yes.
"It's a gesture," Szapary said. "Coming from a small
country, it's a big thing."
One audience member voiced his frustration with the
Hungarian government's inadequate response to a far
right paramilitary group's rioting and terrorizing of
Roma village populations.
