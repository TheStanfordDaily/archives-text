HUMAN BIOLOGY ADMIT WEEKEND OPEN HOUSE
FRIDAY, APRIL 25>TH 2011
p.m.
In the Main Quad, Bldg2o
The Program in Human Biology is an interschool, interdepartmental, under
graduate major. The program's mission is to provide an interdisciplinary
approach to understanding the human being from biological, behavioral,
social, and cultural perspectives.
The program seeks: (a) to provide a broad and rigorous introduction to the
biological and behavioral sciences and their interrelationships, and (b) to
explore how this knowledge, in conjunction with studies in other fields, can be
applied to analyze and formulate health, environmental, and other public
policies that influence human welfare.
To achieve these goals, all students complete a 30-unit core sequence, normally
in the sophomore year that provides the foundation for the major. Also during
the sophomore year, students consult with student advisers to choose a faculty
adviser and complete the declaration process. Together they plan a roadmap of
course work designed to help each student focus on an area of interest within
Human Biology. Early planning and subsequent refining of an individualized
course of study, in consultation with student and faculty advisers, is a strength
and requirement of the program.
The curriculum draws on faculty from across the University. To complete a B.A.
in Human Biology, students must take courses from within the program and
from other University departments. Most Human Biology majors go on to
advanced training in professional schools, or graduate programs in the behav
ioral, natural, and social sciences, including co-terminal master's degree
programs in other University departments. Additional information about the
major may be obtained from the program's offices or at
http://humbio.stanford.edu/.
Faculty Panel Discussion Featuring:
Prof. Carol Foggs. Director on "How the Major Works"
Prof. Russell Pernald on "Humßio's Teaching Mission"
Prof. Katherine Preston , Assoc. Director on "Humßio's Research
We look forward to seeing tjou!
