## SEEING GREEN Why Cheetahs Never Prosper 
### Holly Moeller 
Between Easter's religious re
minders and a molecular evo
lution class overdose of pop
ulation genetics, I shouldn't have
been surprised to wake up yester
day from an unsettling dream about
taking my midterm exam on Noah's
Ark. The ocean was rising, Noah
was hustling animals aboard, and I
was battling asthma (thanks, furry
animal allergies). But what both
ered me most about all this wasn't
that I'd forgotten the formula for
heterozygosity. It was that there
were only two animals of every
kind.
Religious beliefs aside, today's
scientific consensus is that you need
more than two individuals to save a
species.
That's because species survival
isn't just about baby-making poten
tial. It also depends on genetic di
versity: the number of traits (in hu
mans, things like skin color, height
or even intellectual aptitude) pres
ent in the breeding population. This
diversity may be obvious, it may be
subtle or it may be invisible, de
tectable only by extracting and se
quencing samples of DNA.
The more genetic diversity a
population has, the more resilient it
tends to be. When the environment
changes, the population faces new
adaptive pressures. In a diverse
population, it's more likely that
someone will have a set of traits
well-suited for the new conditions.
The idea also suits a well-developed
NFL defense: the team practices a
variety of plays so that it's prepared
for any offensive strategy.
As you might expect, the smaller
your team (or your population), the
slimmer your adaptive playbook.
So unless they got really lucky, the
pair of animals you picked for your
modern-day ark probably wouldn't
be able to re-establish their species.
In genetics, we use the phrase
"genetic bottleneck" to describe di
versity loss in a shrinking popula
tion. If the breeding population gets
too small, the negative effects of in
breeding may run rampant. Think of
the Romanov family and hemophil
ia, for example, and you'll begin to
see some biological reasons for the
social stigma surrounding "incest."
If the population isn't fraught
with lethal genetic disorders, it may
rebound to a substantial size but
that doesn't mean it's safe. It takes
millennia for genetic diversity to
develop (through the slow accumu
lation of changes to the DNA se
quence), so even a large population
may still bear the low-diversity sig

nature of bottlenecks past.
That's a major reason that chee
tahs, for example, are hovering on
the brink of extinction. Of course,
cheetahs face the same human
threats (habitat loss, poaching, etc.)
that most African wildlife does. But
while other species are recovering
slowly under watchful conservation
eyes, the cheetah isn't sprinting
back. The secret is written all over
its DNA.
Where most mammals share
about 80 percent of their genes with
other members of their species,
cheetahs share 99 percent more
than you or I have in common with
even our closest relatives (save for
identical twins). So the miraculous
genetic reshuffling of sexual repro
duction which evolved to pro
duce varied offspring to meet a vari
able world can't help cheetahs
claw back into synchrony with a
changing environment.
The original cheetah bottleneck
probably happened about 10,000
years ago, but other bottlenecks
have been much more recent. The
European bison, or wisent, popula
tion dwindled to 12 in the 19205;
California's sea otters trace their
ancestry to only 50 individuals alive
in 1938. We may yet see the legacy of
those bottlenecks in our conserva
tion efforts.
But while most of us love ani
mals, all of us depend on food. And
the most troubling bottlenecks of
all are those of our key crops, cut off
from wild populations through do
mestication and further winnowed
by breeding and (lately) genetic
modification to just a few varieties.
In a stable environment (like the
one we create with irrigation, fertil
izers and pesticides), it makes sense
to plant only the highest-yielding
variety. But monocultures are risky:
The Irish Potato Famine killed one
million people because single-vari
ety crops were entirely vulnerable
to disease.
Today, you can see the impor
tance of crop diversity in eastern
Ethiopia, where a hard year means
a hard life (not just an expensive
one). There, Romina Cavatassi and

colleagues from the UN's Food and
Agriculture Organization found
that growers who'd switched to
modern monocultures suffered
more crop failures than their na
tive-mixture-growing neighbors
even though, in a good year, mod
ern seeds performed better.
Worldwide, though, agriculture
is shifting from diverse crops to in
dustrial monocultures. We're losing
the very varieties that spare
Ethiopian fields as a result. At a
time when climate change and fuel
shortages loom on the horizon, it's
never been more important to save
that diversity. Who knows which va
riety holds the key to drought toler
ance? Or will resist the sweep of the
next major pest?

While squirreling DNA away in
freezers and seed banks has won
favor amid desperate conservation
efforts, in reality the best way to
preserve genetic diversity is to pre
serve it in situ. Today, we award
huge grants to jet-setting scientists,
who stock seed banks with 70-per
cent redundant collections. Instead,
we should reward the farmer for
planting his family's heirloom vari
eties instead of Monsanto's global
ized products. And we should ex
pand "biodiversity" to mean "ge
netic diversity," and protect our
wildlife (and our crops) from future
genetic bottlenecks. Because a ge
netic bottleneck, like a real one, is
nearly impossible to break out of.

Holly hopes that knowing the impor
tance of diversity will encourage the
Bio 244 graders to accept a diversity
of midterm solutions. She also wel

changes, the population faces new
adaptive pressures. In a diverse
population, it's more likely that
someone will have a set of traits
well-suited for the new conditions.
The idea also suits a well-developed
NFL defense: the team practices a
variety of plays so that it's prepared
for any offensive strategy.
As you might expect, the smaller
your team (or your population), the
slimmer your adaptive playbook.
So unless they got really lucky, the
pair of animals you picked for your
modern-day ark probably wouldn't
be able to re-establish their species.
In genetics, we use the phrase
"genetic bottleneck" to describe di
versity loss in a shrinking popula
tion. If the breeding population gets
too small, the negative effects of in
breeding may run rampant. Think of
the Romanov family and hemophil
ia, for example, and you'll begin to
see some biological reasons for the
social stigma surrounding "incest."
If the population isn't fraught
with lethal genetic disorders, it may
rebound to a substantial size but
that doesn't mean it's safe. It takes
millennia for genetic diversity to
develop (through the slow accumu
lation of changes to the DNA se
quence), so even a large population
may still bear the low-diversity sig

nature of bottlenecks past.
That's a major reason that chee
tahs, for example, are hovering on
the brink of extinction. Of course,
cheetahs face the same human
threats (habitat loss, poaching, etc.)
that most African wildlife does. But
while other species are recovering
slowly under watchful conservation
eyes, the cheetah isn't sprinting
back. The secret is written all over
its DNA.
Where most mammals share
about 80 percent of their genes with
other members of their species,
cheetahs share 99 percent more
than you or I have in common with
even our closest relatives (save for
identical twins). So the miraculous
genetic reshuffling of sexual repro
duction which evolved to pro
duce varied offspring to meet a vari
able world can't help cheetahs
claw back into synchrony with a
changing environment.
The original cheetah bottleneck
probably happened about 10,000
years ago, but other bottlenecks
have been much more recent. The
European bison, or wisent, popula
tion dwindled to 12 in the 19205;
California's sea otters trace their
ancestry to only 50 individuals alive
in 1938. We may yet see the legacy of
those bottlenecks in our conserva
tion efforts.
But while most of us love ani
mals, all of us depend on food. And
the most troubling bottlenecks of
all are those of our key crops, cut off
from wild populations through do
mestication and further winnowed
by breeding and (lately) genetic
modification to just a few varieties.
In a stable environment (like the
one we create with irrigation, fertil
izers and pesticides), it makes sense
to plant only the highest-yielding
variety. But monocultures are risky:
The Irish Potato Famine killed one
million people because single-vari
ety crops were entirely vulnerable
to disease.
Today, you can see the impor
tance of crop diversity in eastern
Ethiopia, where a hard year means
a hard life (not just an expensive
one). There, Romina Cavatassi and

colleagues from the UN's Food and
Agriculture Organization found
that growers who'd switched to
modern monocultures suffered
more crop failures than their na
tive-mixture-growing neighbors
even though, in a good year, mod
ern seeds performed better.
Worldwide, though, agriculture
is shifting from diverse crops to in
dustrial monocultures. We're losing
the very varieties that spare
Ethiopian fields as a result. At a
time when climate change and fuel
shortages loom on the horizon, it's
never been more important to save
that diversity. Who knows which va
riety holds the key to drought toler
ance? Or will resist the sweep of the
next major pest?

While squirreling DNA away in
freezers and seed banks has won
favor amid desperate conservation
efforts, in reality the best way to
preserve genetic diversity is to pre
serve it in situ. Today, we award
huge grants to jet-setting scientists,
who stock seed banks with 70-per
cent redundant collections. Instead,
we should reward the farmer for
planting his family's heirloom vari
eties instead of Monsanto's global
ized products. And we should ex
pand "biodiversity" to mean "ge
netic diversity," and protect our
wildlife (and our crops) from future
genetic bottlenecks. Because a ge
netic bottleneck, like a real one, is
nearly impossible to break out of.

tance of diversity will encourage the

Between Easter's religious re
minders and a molecular evo
lution class overdose of pop
ulation genetics, I shouldn't have
been surprised to wake up yester
day from an unsettling dream about
taking my midterm exam on Noah's
Ark. The ocean was rising, Noah
was hustling animals aboard, and I
was battling asthma (thanks, furry
animal allergies). But what both
ered me most about all this wasn't
that I'd forgotten the formula for
heterozygosity. It was that there
were only two animals of every
kind.
Religious beliefs aside, today's
scientific consensus is that you need
more than two individuals to save a
species.
That's because species survival
isn't just about baby-making poten
tial. It also depends on genetic di
versity: the number of traits (in hu
mans, things like skin color, height
or even intellectual aptitude) pres
ent in the breeding population. This
diversity may be obvious, it may be
subtle or it may be invisible, de
tectable only by extracting and se
quencing samples of DNA.
The more genetic diversity a
population has, the more resilient it
tends to be. When the environment
changes, the population faces new
adaptive pressures. In a diverse
population, it's more likely that
someone will have a set of traits
well-suited for the new conditions.
