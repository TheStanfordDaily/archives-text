Letter to the Editor:
Sorority Recruitment

Dear Editor,
In response to the April 14 arti
cle "Rushing to Bid Day," we would
like to address some of the claims
made by the author regarding par
ticipation in the Inter-Sorority
Counsel Formal Recruitment and
sorority life at Stanford.
Our chapters are some of the
most powerful women's organiza
tions on this campus. The benefits
of membership enrich every part of
our lives as Stanford students. The
author is not someone who went
through our process genuinely
with the intent to join one of our
organizations. We feel that her as
sessment of the process was thus
biased and unrepresentative of the
amazing opportunity Greek life
can provide.
While Formal Recruitment is
more structured than the processes

used by other organizations at Stan
ford, our process works because it
exposes prospective new members
to the full range of chapters within
the Inter-Sorority Council. Many of
our new and current chapter mem
bers ended up someplace they
never imagined they would love as
much as they do.
Being in an ISC chapter, Alpha
Epsilon Phi, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega,
Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha
Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma or Pi
Beta Phi, means a lot more than get
ting to wear matching T-shirts or
chanting Greek letters to catchy
tunes. During Recruitment, we're
only able to show a glimpse of what
comes along with membership: a
huge cheering section for your
sports games or plays, mentors for
selecting classes to finding jobs,
study partners, dance parties and
lifelong friends.
