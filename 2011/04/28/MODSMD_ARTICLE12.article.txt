# LETTER FROM THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Dear Readers,
Since 1973, The Stanford Daily
has valued its established role as an
independent campus newspaper.
With it comes great responsibility to
our readers to ensure that our cov
erage remains unaffected by, and
unaffiliated with, the University.
The Daily failed to live up to this
responsibility on Wednesday by
publishing the front-page article,
"University alters nondiscrimina
tion policy." The story, written by
former Daily staff writer and re
cently elected ASSU Senator Bri
anna Pang, violated the core princi
ples of this independent organiza
tion. While I fully support Ms.

Pang's intentions in reporting as an
objective student journalist, her af
filiation with the ASSU, compound
ed with the ASSU's public relation
ship with the University, places the
piece in discordance with The
Daily's values.
The Daily takes tremendous
pride in its independent status and
will take all necessary precautions
to prevent a similar error in the fu
ture. Thank you for your continued
support.

Sincerely,
ZACH ZIMMERMAN
President and editor in chief, Vol.
