# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## I'm Studying Abroad Because of Emma Watson 
### Shane Savitsky 
When people ask me why I
wanted to study abroad in
Oxford, I can give them a
variety of reasons namely, the
incredible academics, the perfect
setting and the multitude of ex
tracurricular opportunities here.
Or maybe because Oxford was
founded in 1167, making it some
thing like seven times older than
good ol' Stanny U. Or maybe it's
the fantastic architecture and in
credible scenery. Obviously, I came
here for all those things, but that's
not really why I came here. Stan
ford likes to tout the academics of
its study abroad programs and
whatnot (especially Oxford), but
forget that. Those aspects aren't
that important in the grand scheme
of things.
You know what is the most im
portant thing? The British accent.
You can laugh at me all you want,
but you know it's true. For us Amer
icans, there is no more attractive at
tribute for a member of the oppo
site sex than an awesome accent. On
the entirely subjective "1 to 10"
scale of rating the attractiveness of
a potential date, a great British ac
cent easily adds an automatic 1.5
points no matter what. It's just
how these things work. I mean, I've
only been here a week and I already
love the town and the culture here
at Oxford, but I already go to an in
credible university back in Califor
nia. If I only wanted academics and
awesome opportunities, I could
have just stayed in my room in
FloMo for this quarter. If you give
Stanford 700 more years of history,

I'm sure it could morph into some
thing reasonably similar to Oxford,
too. Yet the fact is, even in those 700
years, most Stanford girls will al
ways lack a British accent and
that's just unfortunate. It's why I
had to come here.
It's not even just the girls. I'm a
huge Coldplay fan, obsessively so,
actually. (I know, I know, I pretend
to be all indie in some of my other
columns and then I admit to really
liking Coldplay ? What a cop-out.)
I've seen them live seven times.
Yeah, seven times. And I kind of
have this massive man-crush on
Chris Martin, Coldplay's lead
singer. It could be because of his
immense musical talent. Or it
could be because he's absolutely
perfected this "charmingly awk
ward" thing that I've been trying to
nail down for years now. But more
than likely, it's because of his awe
some British accent.
Then, of course, you also have to
realize that our generation's love
for Harry Potter decidedly skewed
its perceptions of England. Serious
ly, you can't walk two blocks in Ox
ford without hearing about how
some college or another was used
for filming in the Harry Potter
movies. Unfortunately, I can't find
any shops in Oxford that sell
Chocolate Frogs or Bertie Bott's
Every Flavor Beans, but somehow I
think I'll survive that sad fact.
Quite honestly, my greatest take
away from the Harry Potter films
was that they firmly set me and
most guys around my age in love
with Emma Watson. For me, that

probably happened somewhere
around the age of 12 or 13. You
know what, I think even most girls
our age are probably in love with
Emma Watson. Like really, have
you seen this girl? Wasn't Hermione
supposed to be kind of ugly? (Hon
estly, I take it as a personal offense
that she went to Brown over Stan
ford. She's apparently transferring
somewhere else now. Let's hope she
makes the right decision the second
time around.) Anyway, I don't want
to pretend that my love for England
came solely from Emma Watson,
but she definitely helped to sway
my decision.
Of course, Emma Watson also
has one of the most beautiful
British accents that has ever
reached my ears, so that can't be a
coincidence, right? These days,
when I walk in Oxford amongst
beautiful medieval buildings, I have
to stop myself from asking nearly
every English girl I pass on a date. I
can't really help it they have
Emma Watson to thank for that
one.
