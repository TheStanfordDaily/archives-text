## Country first, humanity second 
### SAM WINDLEY LL.M. '11 President, Stan ford Says No to War 
If I had to summarize the report
and recommendations of the Fac
ulty Senate's ad hoc committee
on ROTC in two words, they would
be "Country First," the shallow, pop
ulist slogan of John McCain and
Sarah Palin's presidential campaign.
These words come to mind because,
having dismissed "some of the most
trenchant arguments . . . against
ROTC" on the basis that they were
"marred by naive and derogatory
stereotypes" (without providing any
examples of such stereotypes or
enunciating the basis on which the
committee found them to be "naive
and derogatory"), the ad hoc com
mittee proceeds to justify its recom
mendation that the military be given
special treatment, compared to
other, more peace-promoting and
international-law-abiding institu
tions, by wrapping Stanford Univer
sity in the American flag.
Needless to say, jingoism has no
place in an academic institution of
Stanford's caliber, and by concluding
that establishing an on-campus
ROTC facility would be consistent
with Stanford's "civic" mission, the ad
hoc committee undermines its own
credibility. Furthermore, given the
flaws in the report, the committee
fails to provide members of the Facul
ty Senate with any legitimate reason
to accept its recommendations.
I do not deny that Stanford's civic
mission may include a "special re
sponsibility to contribute to the suc
cess of [the United States'] public in
stitutions," as the committee sug
gests in its report. The committee
clearly errs, however, when it as
sumes: (1) that "contributing to the
success" of the military means pro

viding the military with a training fa
cility on Stanford's campus; and (2)
that ROTC's consistency with the
University's civic mission can be as
sessed solely in the context of this
"special responsibility."
Assumption (1) is reminiscent of
the false, support-the-troops patriot
ism that flourished in the aftermath
of 9/11 and which remains promi

nent today. It is equivalent to the no
tion that "those who love their coun
try don't criticize their country."
Who is to say, for example, that a
principled refusal by Stanford to
provide the military with an on-cam
pus training facility would not be the
best way for the University to con
tribute to the "success" of the mili
tary? In other words, why should
Stanford surrender its moral agency
and let the military decide what is in
the military's interests? From the
University's perspective, contribut
ing to the "success" of the military
means, inter alia , critiquing the mili
tary's failure to reflect the values of
the University; it does not mean
blindly acquiescing to the military's
request for an on-campus facility.
Assumption (2) is even more in
sidious. The committee acknowl
edges in its report that the Universi
ty's "commitment to freedom and
democracy is not confined to the
fate of any single nation." But it then
concludes that on-campus ROTC
would be consistent with Stanford's
civic mission, without mentioning
the interests of anyone outside the
U.S. (i.e. those who are most likely to
be harmed by the military's actions)!
In other words, while Stanford's
founding grant calls on the Universi
ty to exercise an "influence on be
half of humanity and civilization,"
the Ad Hoc Committee believes it is
sufficient to ask whether on-campus

ROTC would constitute an influ
ence on behalf of the U.S. military.
Moreover, the committee's re
port relies on a conception of the
military that ignores the violence it
perpetrates, on the basis that such vi
olence is the result of the purposes
to which the military is put by civil
ian leaders. But no one would accept
this reasoning in any other context.
In the case of murder, for instance,
killing at the instruction of another
is generally considered a more
heinous crime (and comes with a
greater sentence) than killing of
one's own volition. Furthermore, the
brave actions of the military person
nel who refused to serve in the Iraq
war (and others) demonstrate that
the military does have the capacity
to defy civilian orders on moral
grounds, such that its refusal to do so
must be understood as institutional
complicity in the violence itself.
It doesn't take the critical think
ing skills of a Stanford student to re
alize that the report and recommen
dations of the ad hoc committee on
ROTC constitute a cowardly and su
perficial appeal to patriotism. The
University's only hope is that the
Faculty Senate doesn't succumb to
the same temptation.
