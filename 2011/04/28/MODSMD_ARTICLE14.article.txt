## Country first, humanity second 
### SAM WINDLEY LL.M. '11 President, Stan ford Says No to War 
If I had to summarize the report
and recommendations of the Fac
ulty Senate's ad hoc committee
on ROTC in two words, they would
be "Country First," the shallow, pop
ulist slogan of John McCain and
Sarah Palin's presidential campaign.
These words come to mind because,
having dismissed "some of the most
trenchant arguments . . . against
ROTC" on the basis that they were
"marred by naive and derogatory
stereotypes" (without providing any
examples of such stereotypes or
enunciating the basis on which the
committee found them to be "naive
and derogatory"), the ad hoc com
mittee proceeds to justify its recom
mendation that the military be given
special treatment, compared to
other, more peace-promoting and
international-law-abiding institu
tions, by wrapping Stanford Univer
sity in the American flag.
Needless to say, jingoism has no
place in an academic institution of
Stanford's caliber, and by concluding
that establishing an on-campus
ROTC facility would be consistent
with Stanford's "civic" mission, the ad
hoc committee undermines its own
credibility. Furthermore, given the
flaws in the report, the committee
fails to provide members of the Facul
ty Senate with any legitimate reason
to accept its recommendations.
I do not deny that Stanford's civic
mission may include a "special re
sponsibility to contribute to the suc
cess of [the United States'] public in
stitutions," as the committee sug
gests in its report. The committee
clearly errs, however, when it as
sumes: (1) that "contributing to the
success" of the military means pro

viding the military with a training fa
cility on Stanford's campus; and (2)
that ROTC's consistency with the
University's civic mission can be as
sessed solely in the context of this
"special responsibility."
Assumption (1) is reminiscent of
the false, support-the-troops patriot
ism that flourished in the aftermath
of 9/11 and which remains promi

nent today. It is equivalent to the no
tion that "those who love their coun
try don't criticize their country."
Who is to say, for example, that a
principled refusal by Stanford to
provide the military with an on-cam
pus training facility would not be the
best way for the University to con
