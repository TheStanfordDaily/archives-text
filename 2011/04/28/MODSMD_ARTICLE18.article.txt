# The 						ups and downs of a foreign sports fan
## 
### Tom Taylor 
There are a few downsides to
being a foreign student in
the U.S., from the steep
learning curve of a new ac
ademic system what's a
GPA? I have to do homework? And
midterms? —to the fact that even
now, I occasionally get confused looks
when using particularly British words
or phrases. Oh, and that on more than
one occasion, someone has —in all
seriousness asked me who the
Queen is. When it comes to sport,
though, it's all good.
Sure, I can feel a little homesick
when I realize no one around me has
even the faintest clue about vitally im
portant sports news back on the other
side of the pond, and it's worrying that
even in this globally connected world,
it can be far too easy to lose touch with
those events myself. But being a
stranger in a strange land has some se
rious advantages.
Back home, it doesn't take too
much to expose the gaps in my sports
knowledge. The soccer team I support
isn't in the top English league, so my
awareness of the cutting edge of the
sport can be a bit lacking, and even
then, I rarely go to games because I
just can't afford the week-on-week
drain on my bank account. And
though I watch my fair share of sports
on TV, I still can't measure up to the
time put in by serious devotees.
In the U.S., though, all the cracks in
my identity as a fan don't matter. Not
because the bright, mysterious world
of American sports helps patch over
those when it comes to my Ameri
can sporting knowledge, those cracks
can turn into bottomless chasms
but simply because I'm not a local. I
don't do a good American accent, so
as soon as I speak, people's expecta
tions of me as a fan are different.

If I didn't know the basic rules of
soccer, I might feel a little unworthy
back in Europe, but here I can ask the
most stupid questions and get gener
ally patient answers. I do have to occa
sionally deal with someone explaining
to me why my foreign sports are so in
ferior, but that's a two-way street. I
reckon I could get away with saying
pretty much anything about Ameri
can sports, because when it comes
down to it, most people will write
these outbursts off. I didn't grow up in
this particular sports culture, so I'm
not really expected to "get it." I can
earn forgiveness just by breaking out
my charming accent.
But that brings up another issue.
Like with any good infomercial host, I
also perhaps worryingly think
that people sometimes turn to me for
an expert opinion on overseas sports.
For some reason, I've watched my fair
share of these feature-length adverts
in the past, and a defining aspect of
pretty much all of them is the point
when they roll out the "British ex
pert." This is invariably someone who
is apparently famous back home
(though unknown to me) with a pro
nounced, supposedly British accent.
All I need to do, then, is crank up the
Britishness a notch and suddenly peo
ple start to trust that I really know
what I'm talking about.
The whole point of going out into
the world is to broaden your horizons,
though, and that is really why spend
ing a few years of my life in the U.S. is
a great thing, especially as a sports fan.
I won't flatter the Americans reading
this by claiming that I have been com
pletely won over by sports here
I'm not about to switch my loyalties
but there's definitely something
about US sports that's truly unique in
the world. It's not necessarily a better
way of doing things, but simply a dif
ferent one.
Instead of trying to make com
parisons or even find those things
that I think are done better over
here, perhaps it's better to explain
that the best thing about American
sports is their newness to me. There 's

always a new rule to learn, new tac
tics to understand, fresh allegiances
to be taken up and new chants to
shout out. It's a bit like learning a
new language: picking up those first
few words like learning to say
hello and count to 10 is far more
exciting than fine-tuning my grasp
on my own mother tongue.

Tom Taylor is still trying to under
stand the infield-fly rule and why the
quarterback must be in the pocket for
it to be intentional grounding. Ex
plain the rules to our foreign friend at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
