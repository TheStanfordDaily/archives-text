"He lies stiff hips and doesn't run real
well, but some people like him because
of bis size."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"He's a better as u 4-3 nose. He's not
physical or big enough to be a 3-4 nose.
He needs to do a better job finding the
ball but he's tough to move. Good motor
ond work ethic."
Projection: Midrounds.

"I like Marecic, he's the best fullback in
the draft. As technically sound os any
fullback I've seen. Doesn't hove elite
othletidsm but he's othletic enough."
Projection: Fifth Round.

"Don't know why he came out this year.
Decent athlete but nothing special. An
over-acheiver who knows how to use his
hands to shed blocks, but isn't overly
physical."
Projection: Late rounds.

"Has a good feel for the pass game and
catches the football well. Don't think
he's ever going to separate versus man
coverage in the NFL, but he knows where
to sit down in a zone."
Projection: Late rounds.

"A lot of upside to his game. A better run
blocker than he is a pass protector.
Needs to tighten up his footwork a little
bit, but he's a good enough athlete to
work on it and become a player."
Projection: Fifth or Sixth Round.

"He's gritty, he's tough. He's a velcro-type
player. Doesn't have a great burst bat he
can create good leva rage for himself and he
likes to finish. I give him a draftable grade."
Projection: Late Rounds/Priority
UDFA.

"He's undersized. Decent enough ath
lete, not overly phyiscal."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"Nothing special as an athlete. Decent
blocker, but those guys are a dime-a
dozen."
Projection: UDFA.

"He wasn't on many draft boards, does
not appear to be a real serious option."
Projection: UDFA.

"Wasn't a highly rated guy. Not in my
top 600 prospects."
Projection: UDFA.

Shane RHallam,
Draft Countdown

"His big physical nature is going to endear
him to some team. Good for a Cover 2 scheme
because of bow physically be plays. There's
big upside there."
Projection: Sixth Round.

"Fits better as a nose tackle but views himself
as an under tackle who can do some pass
rushing, so that versatility is nice for him. He's
limited to a 4-3 system."
Projection: Fifth Round.

"He's intelligent ond able to play both sides of
the ball. His motor is out of this world. He's not
the most physically figted fullback in this class,
but those traits means that he's probably going
to be the first full bock off the board."
Projection: Fifth Round.

"He is a guy who has some athletic skill and I
like, physically, what he brings to the table. I
think a lot of teams are looking at him as a
special teamer instead of a starter, at this
point."
Projection: Seventh Round.

"Even if he doesn't get drafted, he can go into
a camp and impress people and stick around.
He has nice hands. Built for the slot in the NFL
and his route running is above-average."
Projection:
Seventh Round/Priority UDFA.

"He's a player that sits right in that right tack
le mold. Don't see a lot of versatility. Could
add some strength."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"Lack of athleticism will knock him out of a lot
of teams systems and limit where he could go.
A power run team could use his intelligence
and power to their advantage."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"I don't know if he's going to be able to hold
up in the NFL. I don't see one attribute that
stands out."
Projection: Priority UDFA/UDFA.

"He's not going to be elite for his position, but
I like what I saw in terms of blocking. Stanford
uses an in-line blocker a lot, and that will help
him with teams that need a goalline tight end
who can block downhill."
Projection: UDFA.

"Haven't heard much buzz at all. You're not
getting someone who's particularly crisp or
athletic. I'm not sure he'll be able to hold up
against NFL corners."
Projection: UDFA.

"Haven't heard his name tossed around too
much but there are teams that need kickers.
He's not in my top 10 kickers, but he'll at least
get a shot with a tryout."
Projection: UDFA.

Wes Bunting,
National Football Post

"He lies stiff hips and doesn't run real
well, but some people like him because
of bis size."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"He's a better as u 4-3 nose. He's not
physical or big enough to be a 3-4 nose.
He needs to do a better job finding the
ball but he's tough to move. Good motor
ond work ethic."
Projection: Midrounds.

"I like Marecic, he's the best fullback in
the draft. As technically sound os any
fullback I've seen. Doesn't hove elite
othletidsm but he's othletic enough."
Projection: Fifth Round.

"Don't know why he came out this year.
Decent athlete but nothing special. An
over-acheiver who knows how to use his
hands to shed blocks, but isn't overly
physical."
Projection: Late rounds.

"Has a good feel for the pass game and
catches the football well. Don't think
he's ever going to separate versus man
coverage in the NFL, but he knows where
to sit down in a zone."
Projection: Late rounds.

"A lot of upside to his game. A better run
blocker than he is a pass protector.
Needs to tighten up his footwork a little
bit, but he's a good enough athlete to
work on it and become a player."
Projection: Fifth or Sixth Round.

"He's gritty, he's tough. He's a velcro-type
player. Doesn't have a great burst bat he
can create good leva rage for himself and he
likes to finish. I give him a draftable grade."
Projection: Late Rounds/Priority
UDFA.

"He's undersized. Decent enough ath
lete, not overly phyiscal."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"Nothing special as an athlete. Decent
blocker, but those guys are a dime-a
dozen."
Projection: UDFA.

"He wasn't on many draft boards, does
not appear to be a real serious option."
Projection: UDFA.

"Wasn't a highly rated guy. Not in my
top 600 prospects."
Projection: UDFA.

Shane RHallam,
Draft Countdown

"His big physical nature is going to endear
him to some team. Good for a Cover 2 scheme
because of bow physically be plays. There's
big upside there."
Projection: Sixth Round.

"Fits better as a nose tackle but views himself
as an under tackle who can do some pass
rushing, so that versatility is nice for him. He's
limited to a 4-3 system."
Projection: Fifth Round.

"He's intelligent ond able to play both sides of
the ball. His motor is out of this world. He's not
the most physically figted fullback in this class,
but those traits means that he's probably going
to be the first full bock off the board."
Projection: Fifth Round.

"He is a guy who has some athletic skill and I
like, physically, what he brings to the table. I
think a lot of teams are looking at him as a
special teamer instead of a starter, at this
point."
Projection: Seventh Round.

"Even if he doesn't get drafted, he can go into
a camp and impress people and stick around.
He has nice hands. Built for the slot in the NFL
and his route running is above-average."
Projection:
Seventh Round/Priority UDFA.

"He's a player that sits right in that right tack
le mold. Don't see a lot of versatility. Could
add some strength."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"Lack of athleticism will knock him out of a lot
of teams systems and limit where he could go.
A power run team could use his intelligence
and power to their advantage."
Projection: Priority UDFA.

"I don't know if he's going to be able to hold
up in the NFL. I don't see one attribute that
stands out."
Projection: Priority UDFA/UDFA.

"He's not going to be elite for his position, but
I like what I saw in terms of blocking. Stanford
uses an in-line blocker a lot, and that will help
him with teams that need a goalline tight end
who can block downhill."
Projection: UDFA.

"Haven't heard much buzz at all. You're not
getting someone who's particularly crisp or
athletic. I'm not sure he'll be able to hold up
against NFL corners."
Projection: UDFA.

"Haven't heard his name tossed around too
much but there are teams that need kickers.
He's not in my top 10 kickers, but he'll at least
get a shot with a tryout."
