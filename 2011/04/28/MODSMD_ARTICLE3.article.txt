# FIGHT FOR THE PAC-10 TITLE
## Individuals go for conference crown 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having just wrapped up a flawless season
with an 8-4 victory over the USTA Junior Na
tional All-Star Team, the Stanford women's
tennis team travels to Ojai, Calif., today to par
ticipate in the Pac-10 Championships this
weekend. The Cardinal (23-0, 8-0 Pac-10) will
retain its No. 1 ranking and its Pac-10 title re
gardless of the results of this tournament, as
players will be competing individually. The
event should provide the women with another
opportunity to focus on their individual games
before the NCAA Tournament rolls around at
the end of May.
Stanford will be sending a sizeable contin
gent to Ojai, including freshmen Kristie Ahn
and Nicole Gibbs, sophomores Mallory Bur
dette and Stacey Tan and junior Veronica Li in
the singles main draw. Stanford also has two
doubles teams in the main draw, including
Ahn/Gibbs and a pairing of Tan and senior
Carolyn McVeigh. The Invitational division
will include freshmen Elizabeth Ecker and
Amelia Herring, sophomore Natalie Dillon
and McVeigh in singles. In Invitational dou
bles, Stanford will send Burdette/Dillon and
Herring/Li.
As a rookie, Ahn is looking forward to playing

in Pac-10 individuals, her first such tournament
as a Stanford student-athlete.
"I'm excited to take a break from duals and
focus on some individual matches, which will
most definitely prepare me for the NCAA in
dividual event that follows the team event,"
Ahn said. "Any match under the belt before
NCAAs will be beneficial a chance to com
pete and get back into battle mode."
The Pac-10 Championships will occur at the
same time and place as other tournaments for
other age groups. The Ojai Tennis Tournament
is celebrating its 111 th year and welcomes
many of the nation's elite to its courts.
Ahn will be facing UCLA's Pamela Montez
whom she defeated 6-4,6-4 on March 25
in the first round of singles play Thursday. Dou
bles matches are set to begin on Friday.
"Because it's an individual tournament,
there's always the possibility that you will play
against a fellow teammate, but it tends to be a
few rounds in as opposed to a first-round
grind," Ahn said.
One teammate that Ahn will definitely not
be competing against is senior Hilary Barte,
Stanford's No. 1 player, who will be sitting this
tournament out.
"Yeah, her ranking is safe, and she's had an

championship this weekend in Ojai, Calif. This tournament is a tuneup for NCAAs.
awesome season," Ahn said. "She's
always ready to compete, and I'm
sure she would have loved to play
Ojai one last time, but I think the
smarter decision for her was to sit
this one out."
Barte, who is individually ranked
No. 3 in the country, advanced to the
semifinals of the Pac-10 Champi
onships last year as a singles player
and captured the doubles title with
then-partner Lindsay Burdette, who
graduated in 2010. As Ahn ex
plained, Barte plans on resting up
for the upcoming NCAA Tourna
ment, in which the Cardinal will be
facing the nation's top programs as a
team.
The Pac-10 draw will be particu
larly tough this year, as Ahn attests.
"One of the country's best, Maria
Sanchez of USC, is playing, which
will definitely put us to the test," she

said.
Sanchez is currently ranked as
the nation's No. 2 singles player.
Practices have been flexible lead
ing up to the tournament, allowing
individuals to work on areas that
need refinement.
"Practices have been focused to
playing at Ojai; whatever we feel
like we need to work on, we can just
go ahead and ask each other or the
coaches for help," Ahn said. "We're
trying to fine-tune our games for the
postseason, just doing everything
necessary to get ready for NCAAs."
The team believes Stanford is fin
ishing its season with a lot of confi
dence.
"Our team has developed a win
ning attitude and I think that it's
very apparent when we take the
court," Ahn said. "Pac-10 individu
als will be a great opportunity to

make one last leap in my confidence
before NCAAs roll around."
Ecker echoed that sentiment.
"Ojai should be a really good
way to get us ready and in a good
frame of mind for NCAAS," she
said.
Ecker, who has never played the
Pac-10 individuals at Ojai before,
has gotten help in preparing for the
tournament from her teammates.
"The Pac-10 Championship is
known for its fun, slightly more laid
back atmosphere. We are all so ex
cited to compete, but it can't hurt
and can only help your ranking and
game going into NCAAs."
The Stanford women begin post
season play at 8 a.m. today at the
Ojai Valley Athletic Club.
