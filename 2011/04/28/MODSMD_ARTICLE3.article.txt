# FIGHT FOR THE PAC-10 TITLE
## Individuals go for conference crown 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Having just wrapped up a flawless season
with an 8-4 victory over the USTA Junior Na
tional All-Star Team, the Stanford women's
tennis team travels to Ojai, Calif., today to par
ticipate in the Pac-10 Championships this
weekend. The Cardinal (23-0, 8-0 Pac-10) will
retain its No. 1 ranking and its Pac-10 title re
gardless of the results of this tournament, as
players will be competing individually. The
event should provide the women with another
opportunity to focus on their individual games
before the NCAA Tournament rolls around at
the end of May.
Stanford will be sending a sizeable contin
gent to Ojai, including freshmen Kristie Ahn
and Nicole Gibbs, sophomores Mallory Bur
dette and Stacey Tan and junior Veronica Li in
the singles main draw. Stanford also has two
doubles teams in the main draw, including
Ahn/Gibbs and a pairing of Tan and senior
Carolyn McVeigh. The Invitational division
will include freshmen Elizabeth Ecker and
Amelia Herring, sophomore Natalie Dillon
and McVeigh in singles. In Invitational dou

Herring/Li.
As a rookie, Ahn is looking forward to playing

in Pac-10 individuals, her first such tournament
as a Stanford student-athlete.
"I'm excited to take a break from duals and
focus on some individual matches, which will
most definitely prepare me for the NCAA in
dividual event that follows the team event,"
Ahn said. "Any match under the belt before
NCAAs will be beneficial a chance to com
pete and get back into battle mode."
The Pac-10 Championships will occur at the
same time and place as other tournaments for
other age groups. The Ojai Tennis Tournament
is celebrating its 111 th year and welcomes
many of the nation's elite to its courts.
Ahn will be facing UCLA's Pamela Montez
whom she defeated 6-4,6-4 on March 25
in the first round of singles play Thursday. Dou
bles matches are set to begin on Friday.
"Because it's an individual tournament,
there's always the possibility that you will play
against a fellow teammate, but it tends to be a
few rounds in as opposed to a first-round
grind," Ahn said.
One teammate that Ahn will definitely not
be competing against is senior Hilary Barte,
Stanford's No. 1 player, who will be sitting this
tournament out.
"Yeah, her ranking is safe, and she's had an
