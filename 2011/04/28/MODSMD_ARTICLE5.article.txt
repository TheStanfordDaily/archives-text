## LOCAL Bay Area bids for 2020 World Expo 
### ISSRA OMER 
The World Expo, an international
event occurring only twice every 10
years and attended by millions
around the globe, could be coming to
the Bay Area in 2020. California's
bid for the Expo may greatly impact
Palo Alto and the greater Bay Area.
A proposal from the Bay Area
Council, which represents the re
gion's nine counties, is currently in
the works to bring the Expo to Mof
fett Field, a 1000-acre civil military
airport between Sunnyvale and
Mountain View.
The Expo's benefits to Palo Alto
would include an estimated $6.1 bil
lion revenue over its six-month dura
tion.
"Having the visitors would lead
to spending on hotels, transporta
tion, commerce and generally lead to

more spending," said Thomas
Fehrenbach, economic development
manager for Palo Alto.
Fehrenbach said that having the
Expo in the midst of the technologi
cal advancement of Silicon Valley
would highlight innovation and in
genuity. Other supporters say that
the Bay Area would be able to put a
new spin on the World Expo.
If the Bay Area bid wins, the
Expo would conveniently be placed
near important companies.
"If you look at the location, you
can see that it is right in the heart of
Silicon Valley," said John Grubb, sen
ior vice president for external affairs
for the Bay Area Council. "Google is
on the north side, Yahoo is close as
well and Microsoft, Facebook and
Linkedln are all close by. All these
companies that are connecting the

world together, which is what the
World Expo is all about."
"The Bay Area is definitely the
center of innovation in the U.S. if not
the world," Fehrenbach added.
"There is so much to offer in terms
of technology and innovation."
Excitement over the prospects of
having the World Expo so close to
Palo Alto has also spread on cam
pus.
Natalie Cheng 'l4 is particularly
enthusiastic about the 2020 Expo,
after having seen the Expos in
Shanghai, Germany and Italy.
"The Expo embodies so many
different cultures [and] it always uses
cutting-edge technology to display
history and culture," Cheng said.
"Having the World Expo in the Bay
Area would be great for people who
want to get a taste of countries all
around the world without having to
travel as much. It's like bringing the
world to America."
Still, despite the enthusiasm,
there are a few roadblocks slowing
the progress of the Bay Area's bid.
According to Grubb, one key barri
er is the fact that the U.S. is not a
member of the Bureau of Interna
tional Expositions (BIE), the organ
ization responsible for choosing
World Expo locations.

Local congresswoman Anna
Eshoo has been leading the efforts
for the U.S. bid.
"To bid for the World Expo, the
U.S. needs to rejoin the BIE ... A
U.S.-hosted World Expo has the
potential to create jobs, enhance
diplomatic relationships and
showcase the innovative strength
of our country," Eshoo wrote in a
letter to Secretary of State Elillary
Clinton.
According to Fehrenbach, there
is also the question of financing the
World Expo. Because of the eco
nomic recession, Palo Alto has
found it "difficult to squeeze money
out of the expenditures."
"Having said that, I think it is
worth the costs; it has a potential up
side that is worth exploring," he
added.
City officials, after all, are expect
ing the World Expo to leave a lasting
mark on Silicon Valley.
"When you think of Silicon Val
ley, the image you get is nondescript
offices or buildings," Grubb said.
"When you think of Paris, you get
the image of the Eiffel Tower or the
Space Needle for Seattle. All of
these landmarks have been the re
sult of past World Expos this is
the Silicon Valley's chance."
The BIE is expected to make its
final decision regarding the 2020
World Expo location in 2013.
