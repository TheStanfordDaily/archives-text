## Vision eARTh A
						three-day arts and sustainability festival addresses issues that reach beyond the Stanford bubble 
### AMANDA ROST 
If it is possible for White Plaza to look
normal, it has started to look consider
ably more so since the whimsical white
tents, stages and displays were taken
down after last weekend's artistic exper
iment. For the later part of last week, White
Plaza was graced with musical performances
and student art displays that represented more
than Stanford kids in spring quarter overdrive.
They were Vision eARTh, Stanford's first
annual three-day arts and sustainability festi
val, which lasted from Thursday, April 21, to
Saturday, April 23.
Vision eARTh is novel in name, but estab
lished in concept. In past years, Vision eARTh
was a series of two separate events: An Art Af
fair, hosted by Student Organizing Committee
for the Arts (SOCA), and FutureFest, hosted
by Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS).
According to Sarthak Misra 'l3, Vision
eARTh's main organizer and SOCA director
Ali McKeon 'll, the approximately 20-mem
ber Vision eARTh team is composed of stu
dents from all over campus who share a com
mon aim to broaden people's definition of sus
tainability.
"We wanted to combine the events because

this way we'll be able to address sustainability
issues using artists as a platform," Misra said.
The term sustainability has a nuanced defi
nition across different campus populations. To
the Vision eARTh team, sustainability formal
ly means "anything I do that will allow other
people to have access to the resources I have
access to," according to Misra.
The multifaceted nature of the event re
flected the concept of sustainability as away of
thinking rather than a narrowly defined action.
Over the three days of the festival, passersby in
White Plaza were offered a myriad of attrac
tions, including two tent installments of stu
dent art.
"It was fun just being in White Plaza and
catching people as they walk by," said con
tributing artist Katharine Matsumoto 'll. "It
was a good way to engage people who weren't
planning on going."
Vision eARTh and SOCA marketing direc
tor Jasmine Mann 'll described the laid-back
environment of this year's event.
"We want to provide the most relaxed, most
open environment," Mann said. "It doesn't
matter how small, how awkward or however
weird it is; we want your art."
And indeed, undergraduate artist contribu
tions ran the gamut of style, from a facial por
trait composed of bottle caps to a painted mir

ror arrangement flirting with consumerism to
an arrangement of photographs on recycled
CDs.

Other main attractions included a Sustain
able Fashion Show, put on by the Sustainable
Fashion Collective. Another highlight was a
concert organized by the Stanford Concert
Network (SCN) featuring indie music group
Broken Social Scene. The performance drew a
surprising crowd of 300 spectators, perhaps be
cause of the group's growing popularity and
recent appearance at Coachella.
The ASSU, Green Living Council (GLC),
Stanford Farm Project and BeWell also partic
ipated in the event, as well as a number of stu
dent groups ranging from belly dancers, to a
cappella groups, to Cardinal Ballet and the
Stanford Improvisers (Simps).
"As a ballerina I never thought I'd be danc
ing for such a groovy cause," said Audrey
Solomon 'l4 of Cardinal Ballet. "I loved look
ing out into the audience and seeing their faces
full of hope for a green and sustainable future."
The logic behind hosting so many different
artistic performances goes back to the way
most people view sustainability, according to
Mann.

"The idea of Vision eARTh [is that] most
people see sustainability as 'Oh, it's an engi
neering problem. It's a political problem.' But

it's also a cultural problem."
"It's approaching sustainability from a dif
ferent angle," she added.
The event culminated in a release party for
the SOCA-produced Stanford Soundtrack. A
highly anticipated appearance by venture cap
italist and self-proclaimed "environmental
pragmatist" Vinod Khosla was made before
the release of the soundtrack.

Kholsa spoke to a tent-full of audience
about the "hard part of sustainability," poking
fun at idealistic environmentalists including
A1 Gore, whom he described as a close friend
for being skilled at identifying environmen
tal problems but lacking in solutions. Khosla
told his audience that he has "real beef" with
environmental trends that are more founded
in fashion more than practicality.
Kholsa emphasized the importance of
bridging the gap between making things hap
pen and wanting to make them happen. In
line with Khosla's warning to avoid reducing
the green movement to "silly fashion state
ments," Vision eARTh strove to show the
power of appealing to both aesthetics and en
vironmental consciousness to promote sus
tainability.
