Taube Center for Jewish Studies
Program
The Taube Center for Jewish Studies is the key address on
campus for all aspects of Jewish academic study - from
ancient Judaism, to the study of contemporary Israel, or
Hebrew, or Yiddish, or Ladino. Affiliated with the Taube
Center are nearly two dozen faculty across seven
departments. Hundreds of students take classes
sponsored by the Center, and the Taube Center has
connected with it, one of the largest and most prominent
programs in graduate studies in Jewish topics in North
America.
In addition, the Center sponsors many public events -
lectures by leading writers, artists and intellectuals. Some
of these are in small, intimate forums, others are large
lectures. The Center sponsors a book series at Stanford
University Press, and one of the most distinguished of all
journals in the field, Jewish Social Studies: History,
Culture, and Society.
