# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## (Wel)Come to Stanford 
### Kristian Bailey 
On the surface, I'm writing this
column to convince one of
my best friends to pick Stan
ford over Yale and Harvard (how's
that for subtlety, Rachel?), but be
yond that, this column is for every
Stanford Pro Fro who is currently
undecided about where to spend
the next four years of his or her life.
I can sympathize with the nervous
ness about having to choose by May
1. Fortunately for me, Stanford's
Admit Weekend 2010 ended on
April 24 a full week before the
deadline. But fortunately for you,
Class of 2015,1 didn't decide until
April 30, either, so we're essentially
in the same boat.
I remember the thrill of April
hearing back from schools on the
first (and Stanford a full week earli
er than everyone else), missing
nearly two straight weeks of school
to go to various admit weekends,
flying home from my first-ever visit
to California and announcing to my
parents the same night, "Mom, Dad,
I think Stanford's the school for
me." Then I remember the immedi
ate nausea I felt with the weight of
my words, with the understanding
that I was choosing to leave every
thing I knew on the East Coast to go
to a school and live in a state and on
a coast I knew nothing about. Two
seconds after uttering these words, I
decided to take them back; another
two seconds later, I decided to take
back taking them back. And then
two seconds later ...
Essentially, I remained "unde
cided" for an entire week, drawing
up the pros and cons of an Ivy
League education and staying close
to home on the East Coast versus
going to my dream school (Stan
ford), a name that caused lots of
anxiety, some bad, but more good,
whenever I thought of it. On April
30, as I tried to put off the decision
another day, my mother stopped me
and said, "You're not leaving the
house until you make a decision."
So, I said, "Okay, I pick Stanford."
My decision was one I spent a lot
of time thinking about, so instead of
giving the "just follow your gut" ad

vice (which did work, by the way,
but also felt too intangible to trust),
I'll give you my concrete reasons
why Stanford is different from
every other school you're consider
ing and why it's better.
First and foremost, no university
does the freshman experience bet
ter than Stanford. Before you even
get here, two undergraduates have
spent their entire summer reading
your housing applications and
hand-matching the roughly 1,700 of
you that will choose to matriculate
here. With few exceptions, the Uni
versity does an excellent job pairing
you with a roommate who will chal
lenge you to learn, but in away
that's compatible enough with your
own living preferences that you
won't even feel like you're not at
home.
Beyond that, freshman dorms are
amazing. Not only do the aforemen
tioned matchmakers pair you with
your roommate, but they organize
the entirety of your dorm so that
your entire floor is compatible with
each other, so that the dorm repre
sents a cross-section of every kind of
diversity the University excels in
bringing to each class and so that the
dorm becomes a vibrant community.
More than anything, my freshman
dorm has been my favorite part of
my Stanford experience.
Why, you ask? Friday barbecues,
weekly house meetings, inter-dorm
competitions, fountain hopping,
San Francisco Scavenger Hunt,
Word Assassins, Secret Snowflake,
Ski Trip (the University essentially
pays for the entire freshman class to
spend a weekend in cabins and ski
ing in Tahoe over the course of Jan
uary), Assassins (yes, this is differ
ent from Word Assassins), Screw
Your Roommate and The Game:

imagine teams of five students in a
car, performing a Bay Area-wide
scavenger hunt with clues based on
really complex puzzles created by
insanely smart and creative Stan
ford students. The Game was my
single favorite activity within the
single favorite part of my Stanford
experience.
You'll be getting a great educa
tion no matter where you go
world-class faculty, brilliant and
motivated students, etc. But based
on what I know, no other university
invests as much in cultivating a
sense of community among the
freshman class and within the entire
school. Feeling a sense of belonging
is extraordinarily important when
you're investing so much of your
life in this decision not just in
your intellectual development, but
more importantly in your personal
development. Feeling welcome,
feeling free to be whoever and
whatever you'd like to be and feel
ing capable to taking on the chal
lenges of the 21st century are all
what Stanford excels at.
Thursday afternoon, one of my
professors and advisors gave
Rachel what I think is the best piece
of college advice I've ever heard:
you won't be sorry wherever you
decide to go, but if you go to Stan
ford, you won't be sorry you didn't
go anywhere else.
I've yet to mention our excellent
athletic program, beautiful weath
er, the gorgeous campus abounding
with nature, etc. and on the most
serious level, this really affects the
sense of community, my happiness
and my optimism about the future
but I've already convinced you,
and you're two seconds away from
logging in, clicking "Accept" and
making the best decision of your life
Go forth unafraid, ProFros.

Kristian is in FloMo without a Pro Fro
even though he's a RoHo, but since
he's a HoHo, it's all a go-go. If you're
mad at him for his asinine assonance,
let him know at kbailey@stanford.

hand-matching the roughly 1,700 of
you that will choose to matriculate
here. With few exceptions, the Uni
versity does an excellent job pairing
you with a roommate who will chal
lenge you to learn, but in away
that's compatible enough with your
own living preferences that you
won't even feel like you're not at
home.
Beyond that, freshman dorms are
amazing. Not only do the aforemen
tioned matchmakers pair you with
your roommate, but they organize
the entirety of your dorm so that
your entire floor is compatible with
each other, so that the dorm repre
sents a cross-section of every kind of
diversity the University excels in
bringing to each class and so that the
dorm becomes a vibrant community.
More than anything, my freshman
dorm has been my favorite part of
my Stanford experience.
Why, you ask? Friday barbecues,
weekly house meetings, inter-dorm
competitions, fountain hopping,
San Francisco Scavenger Hunt,
Word Assassins, Secret Snowflake,
Ski Trip (the University essentially
pays for the entire freshman class to
spend a weekend in cabins and ski
ing in Tahoe over the course of Jan
uary), Assassins (yes, this is differ
ent from Word Assassins), Screw
Your Roommate and The Game:

imagine teams of five students in a
car, performing a Bay Area-wide
scavenger hunt with clues based on
really complex puzzles created by
insanely smart and creative Stan
ford students. The Game was my
single favorite activity within the
single favorite part of my Stanford
experience.
You'll be getting a great educa
tion no matter where you go
world-class faculty, brilliant and
motivated students, etc. But based
on what I know, no other university
invests as much in cultivating a
sense of community among the
freshman class and within the entire
school. Feeling a sense of belonging
is extraordinarily important when
you're investing so much of your
life in this decision not just in
your intellectual development, but
more importantly in your personal
development. Feeling welcome,
feeling free to be whoever and
whatever you'd like to be and feel
ing capable to taking on the chal
lenges of the 21st century are all
what Stanford excels at.
Thursday afternoon, one of my
professors and advisors gave
Rachel what I think is the best piece
of college advice I've ever heard:
you won't be sorry wherever you
decide to go, but if you go to Stan
ford, you won't be sorry you didn't
go anywhere else.
I've yet to mention our excellent
athletic program, beautiful weath
er, the gorgeous campus abounding
with nature, etc. and on the most
serious level, this really affects the
sense of community, my happiness
and my optimism about the future
but I've already convinced you,
and you're two seconds away from
logging in, clicking "Accept" and
making the best decision of your life
Go forth unafraid, ProFros.

Kristian is in FloMo without a Pro Fro
even though he's a RoHo, but since
he's a HoHo, it's all a go-go. If you're
mad at him for his asinine assonance,
let him know at kbailey@stanford.

On the surface, I'm writing this
column to convince one of
my best friends to pick Stan
ford over Yale and Harvard (how's
that for subtlety, Rachel?), but be
yond that, this column is for every
Stanford Pro Fro who is currently
undecided about where to spend
the next four years of his or her life.
I can sympathize with the nervous
ness about having to choose by May
1. Fortunately for me, Stanford's
Admit Weekend 2010 ended on
April 24 a full week before the
deadline. But fortunately for you,
Class of 2015,1 didn't decide until
April 30, either, so we're essentially
in the same boat.
I remember the thrill of April
hearing back from schools on the
first (and Stanford a full week earli
er than everyone else), missing
nearly two straight weeks of school
to go to various admit weekends,
flying home from my first-ever visit
to California and announcing to my
parents the same night, "Mom, Dad,
I think Stanford's the school for
me." Then I remember the immedi
ate nausea I felt with the weight of
my words, with the understanding
that I was choosing to leave every
thing I knew on the East Coast to go
to a school and live in a state and on
a coast I knew nothing about. Two
seconds after uttering these words, I
decided to take them back; another
two seconds later, I decided to take
back taking them back. And then
two seconds later ...
Essentially, I remained "unde
cided" for an entire week, drawing
up the pros and cons of an Ivy
League education and staying close
to home on the East Coast versus
going to my dream school (Stan
ford), a name that caused lots of
anxiety, some bad, but more good,
whenever I thought of it. On April
30, as I tried to put off the decision
another day, my mother stopped me
and said, "You're not leaving the
house until you make a decision."
So, I said, "Okay, I pick Stanford."
My decision was one I spent a lot
of time thinking about, so instead of
giving the "just follow your gut" ad

vice (which did work, by the way,
but also felt too intangible to trust),
I'll give you my concrete reasons
why Stanford is different from
every other school you're consider
ing and why it's better.
First and foremost, no university
does the freshman experience bet
ter than Stanford. Before you even
get here, two undergraduates have
spent their entire summer reading
your housing applications and
hand-matching the roughly 1,700 of
you that will choose to matriculate
here. With few exceptions, the Uni
versity does an excellent job pairing
you with a roommate who will chal
lenge you to learn, but in away
that's compatible enough with your
own living preferences that you
won't even feel like you're not at
home.
Beyond that, freshman dorms are
amazing. Not only do the aforemen
tioned matchmakers pair you with
your roommate, but they organize
the entirety of your dorm so that
your entire floor is compatible with

sents a cross-section of every kind of
diversity the University excels in
bringing to each class and so that the
