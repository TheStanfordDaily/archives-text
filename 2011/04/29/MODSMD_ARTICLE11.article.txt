## Knight Center debuts at open house today 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
One of the largest construction
projects on campus this year, the
Knight Management Center, offi
cially opens today. The facility has
been partially in use since January
and fully operational since April 18,
with an official open house and cere
mony this afternoon.
The Knight Center, which is the
new site for Stanford's Graduate
School of Business (GSB), bears the
name of Nike founder Phil Knight
MBA '62, who donated $lO5 million
for the facility. The project cost $345
million in total.
According to a press release,
GSB administrators hope it will
house the "site for the business
school for 75 to 100 years." The old
GSB campus, currently called the
Littlefield Management Center, re
mains vacant with no final plans for
its future use.
The construction of a new cam
pus came as a result of 2007 changes
in the MBA curriculum that called
for smaller class sizes, necessitating
smaller and more classrooms.
The new curriculum includes "more
critical analytical thinking, a global
experience requirement, more inno
vative thinking and more personal
leadership development," wrote
GSB Dean Garth Saloner 'Bl M.S.
'B2 Ph.D. 'B2 in an email to The Daily.
The new campus also houses
rows of individual study rooms,
workrooms and "breakout rooms"
that faculty can use to divide up a
class for group work. The Knight
Center houses 70 such rooms, up
from 28 in the old facility.
Several other aspects of the new
facility differentiate it from the old
GSB complex. Most noticeably, the
Knight Center now sits on Campus
Drive and Serra Street. One major
hope the GSB administration has for
the new facility is to make it a more
open area to bring in members of all
Stanford departments. The new cam
pus was also oriented to give better
views of the Stanford campus, espe
cially from the Bass Center, which is
the new business school library and

the tallest building in the Knight
Center.
"This is a place for the whole
Stanford community," said Knight
Center Program Director Kathleen
Kavanaugh.
The new center was also con
structed with the goal of earning the
United States Green Building Coun
cil's Leadership in Energy and Envi
ronmental Design (LEED) plat
inum level certification. The facility
has not yet been awarded LEED
platinum, but according to Ka
vanaugh it is still "on track" for this
distinction.
To contend for this certification,
the facility was designed to consume
45 percent less energy and 80 per
cent less water than a typical office
building, in addition to producing an
estimated 12.5 percent of its re
quired energy from photovoltaic
cells. Kavanaugh said that green
facilities were a priority for educa
tional reasons as well, in hopes that
students would carry environmental
motivations into their careers.
"The GSB believes that the lead
ers of business are the people that
can make change really happen," she
said. "By designing and building this
facility with these green aspects in
mind, we're showing that we can de
sign a green facility without compro
mising on design and functionality."
"What's important here is that
the GSB practices what it teaches,"
Saloner added. "Sustainability is
good business."
The center consists of eight new
buildings around a main, central
quadrangle and the Arbuckle Din
ing Pavilion. Another addition to the
new campus includes a parking facil
ity beneath two of the Knight Cen
ter's eight buildings that opens onto
Campus Drive.
The GSB community along with
President John Hennessey and the
Board of Trustees will officially ded
icate the Knight Center in a ceremo
ny from noon to 2 p.m. today. An
open house for all of Stanford will
follow until 5 p.m.
