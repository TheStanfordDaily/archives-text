## University expands 'gender-neutral' housing, renames 'gender-inclusive' 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
Student Housing will expand its
gender-neutral housing program to
Bob, Branner Hall, Crothers, Yost
and all graduate residences next
year, according to an informational
email by Charles Syms 'll M.A. 'll,
who spearheads the student side of
the program. It will further expand
the program as more buildings are
renovated so that they "are suitable

for gender-inclusive housing," he
said.
Syms noted that students had
been working with Housing to clari
fy the housing assignment process
for transgender or "gendcrqucer"
students, adding that if students were
worried about being assigned hous
ing by the gender listed in the regis
trar's database, they could speak to a
housing specialist who could work
with them to assure that their hous
ing needs would be met, keeping in
mind their gender identity.
Syms said Housing is changing
the name of the housing type from
"Gender-neutral Housing" to "Gen
der-inclusive Housing" based on stu
dent input and will refer to it exclu
sively as the latter after next year.
