# Fire at Naval ROTC Annex preceded program's complete departure by 5 years

Army ROTC cadet Jimmy Ruck '1 1
instructs his peers during a training lab
on the Santa Clara campus, which has
a cross-town agreement with Stanford
(above). Stanford's Naval ROTC Annex
goes up in flames in the early hours of
the morning on May 7, 1968 (right).
The annex, which at the time was being
rebuilt after an earlier burn, was razed
and never rebuilt. Soon after, the Faculty
Senate voted to remove academic
credit for ROTC courses; all programs
had departed by 1973.
