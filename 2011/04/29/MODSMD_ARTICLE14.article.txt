## DESERT DELIGHT Stanford looks to cool off No. 7 Sun Devils 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
In the Pac-10, there are no weekends off, no
easy opponents, no rollover games there is
no chance to rest. With that in mind, the No. 21
Stanford baseball team hits the road this week
end for a pivotal conference matchup against
No. 7 Arizona State.
The Cardinal (20-14, 5-7 Pac-10) travels to
the desert to take on the Sun Devils in Tempe
for a three-game series that has plenty of post
season implications. Arizona State (29-9, 11-4
Pac-10) trails Oregon State by a half-game in
the conference standings as the season nears the

halfway mark, with Stanford sitting five games
back in sixth place.
Stanford may be riding high after a series win
over visiting No. 11 UCLA last weekend, but no
team in the nation is hotter than ASU. After
being swept by Oregon State in Corvallis, the
Sun Devils have rattled off seven straight victo
ries against conference foes.
The streak started against Washington State
at home, where ASU dismantled the Cougars,
winning two games by six runs and only allow
ing more than two runs just once.
The Sun Devils then traveled up to the Bay
Area to take on a tough Cal squad. After the
first game, it seemed like the series could be the

series of the year. In the second-longest game in
school history, the Sun Devils outlasted the No.
20 Golden Bears in a 17-inning marathon. ASU
took one-run leads in the 10th and 13th innings,
but could not stay ahead before finally finishing
the game off in the 17th.
The Arizona State pitching staff blanked Cal
the rest of the weekend, winning 5-0 and 6-0.
Most recently, the Sun Devils traveled to Tucson
on Tuesday for a midweek game against rival
Arizona, outlasting the Wildcats, 4-3.
But Stanford has momentum, too. In its
biggest series of the year, the Cardinal took two
out of three from UCLA in dramatic fashion.
Buoyed by home runs by senior catcher Zach
Jones, sophomore outfielder Tyler Gaffney and
sophomore third baseman Stephen Piscotty, the
Cardinal took the series opener, 7-4, behind an
other solid performance by sophomore starter
Mark Appel. Facing one of the nation's best
pitchers in Gerrit Cole, the Cardinal's offensive
explosion was a huge, if not unexpected, lift to a
struggling team.
The Cardinal bats went cold again on Satur
day against Trevor Bauer, another top prospect.
The undersized junior threw a complete game
allowing one run and striking out a career-high
17.
On Sunday, Stanford played its biggest
game of the early season. A loss would have
handed the Cardinal its third straight Pac-10
loss, while a win would provide a turning point
in the season.

GAME NOTES: Stanford will have a tough test this weekend
as they head to the desert to play No. 7 and Pac-10 lead
ing Arizona State. The Cardinal has some momentum
after winning last weekend's series with UCLA, but will be
hard pressed to slow down the red-hot Sun Devils, winners
of seven straight.


LAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Stephen Piscotty (25) has helped No. 21 Stanford into contention in a crowded Pac-10
field this season. The third baseman from Pleasanton, Calif, leads the team with a .348 batting
average and will look to bring his hot hitting into this weekend's series at Arizona State.

Trailing by three runs heading
into the bottom of the ninth, Stan
ford was down to its final out. Fresh
man outfielder Brian Guymon sin
gled, sophomore pinch hitter Justin
Ringo walked and sophomore out
fielder Jake Stewart singled to cut
the lead to two. Jones then doubled
down the right field line to tie the
game at four. Following two straight
walks to load the bases, sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger's
blooper found outfield grass to plate
Jones and send Sunken Diamond
into pandemonium.
Now, Stanford must build on
that momentum. The Cardinal got

off to the right start beating Cal 9-5
on Monday, but lost to a subpar
Saint Mary's team the next day for
its first midweek loss of the season.
And Stanford certainly has its
work cut out for it against the Sun
Devil rotation. Brady Rodgers (5-2,
2.85 ERA) will take the mound on
Friday night, followed by Kramer
Champlin (6-1,2.78 ERA) and Jake
Barrett (5-3,4.55 ERA).
The Cardinal will send out the
same three starters against ASU as
it did against UCLA, but in differ
ent order. Appel will once again
take the Friday start, but senior
Danny Sandbrink will move up for
the Saturday start, with junior Jor
dan Pries pitching the series finale.
First pitch is set for 6:30 p.m. Friday
night.
