### WILLSEATON STAFF WRITER 
After the first day of action in the Pac-10
women's singles tournament and invitational,
the Cardinal is in good position to bring home
the title, Stanford has four players in the quar
terfinals of the singles tournament and one
representative in the quarterfinals of the invita
tional.
The Pac-10 Tournament is a singles and dou
bles competition that forces participants to play
double matches for three days in an exhausting
weekend that pits many of the best players in
the country against each other and allows for
very little rest.
"That is one of my least favorite things to
do," said main draw entrant Nicole Gibbs. "I
hate playing back-to-back singles matches. It's
just such a grind. I think everyone did a really
good job just plugging through."
Stanford had three players enter the Pac-10
Women's Invitational sophomore Natalie
Dillon and freshmen Amelia Herring and Eliza
beth Ecker. Herring defeated Stephany Chang
of California 6-4,7-6(6) in the first round before
losing 6-3,6-0 to second-seeded Kim Stubbe of
Arizona. Ecker defeated Hayler H. Miller of
USC 6-4,6-0 in the first round before losing 6-2,
6-0 to fourth-seeded Alice Duranteau of Cal.

Dillon, however, had a first-round bye and
then defeated Megan N. Lester of UCLA, 6-1,6-
3, in the second round to advance to the quarter
finals she will face Susan Mc√üann of Arizona
at noon today.
In the main draw, Stanford entered six play
ers with one major exception Stanford's best
player, senior Hilary Barte, decided not to par
ticipate in this tournament to rest. Three of
Stanford's players earned a seed, with Nicole
Gibbs seeded fourth, Mallory Burdette fifth and
Kristie Ahn seventh. All three of these players
advanced to the quarterfinals, along with un
seeded Stacey Tan. Arizona's Sarah Landsman
defeated senior Carolyn McVeigh 6-2, 6-4, and
Li lost to McCall Jones, 6-2,6-1, both in the first
round.
Ahn had two straight-set wins over Marina
Cossou of Cal by the score of 7-5, 6-3 and Mi
caela Hein of Arizona State with the score 6-4,
6-2. Tan was forced to come back from a set
down in her first match before advancing 2-6,6-
0,6-4. She then upset sixth-seeded Mari Ander
sson, 6-1,6-4 to book her place in the quarterfi
nals. Burdette fought through a tough three-set
ter in the first round, defeating Michelle Brycki
of Arizona State 6-3,4-6,6-3 and then defeating
Annie Goransson of Cal 6-2,7-5.
