## 
### WILLSEATON STAFF WRITER 
After the first day of action in the Pac-10
women's singles tournament and invitational,
the Cardinal is in good position to bring home
the title, Stanford has four players in the quar
terfinals of the singles tournament and one
representative in the quarterfinals of the invita
tional.
The Pac-10 Tournament is a singles and dou
bles competition that forces participants to play
double matches for three days in an exhausting
weekend that pits many of the best players in
the country against each other and allows for
very little rest.
"That is one of my least favorite things to
do," said main draw entrant Nicole Gibbs. "I
hate playing back-to-back singles matches. It's
just such a grind. I think everyone did a really
good job just plugging through."
Stanford had three players enter the Pac-10
Women's Invitational sophomore Natalie
Dillon and freshmen Amelia Herring and Eliza
beth Ecker. Herring defeated Stephany Chang
of California 6-4,7-6(6) in the first round before
losing 6-3,6-0 to second-seeded Kim Stubbe of
Arizona. Ecker defeated Hayler H. Miller of
USC 6-4,6-0 in the first round before losing 6-2,
6-0 to fourth-seeded Alice Duranteau of Cal.

Dillon, however, had a first-round bye and
then defeated Megan N. Lester of UCLA, 6-1,6-
3, in the second round to advance to the quarter
finals she will face Susan Mcßann of Arizona
at noon today.
In the main draw, Stanford entered six play
ers with one major exception Stanford's best
player, senior Hilary Barte, decided not to par
ticipate in this tournament to rest. Three of
Stanford's players earned a seed, with Nicole
Gibbs seeded fourth, Mallory Burdette fifth and
Kristie Ahn seventh. All three of these players
advanced to the quarterfinals, along with un
seeded Stacey Tan. Arizona's Sarah Landsman
defeated senior Carolyn McVeigh 6-2, 6-4, and
Li lost to McCall Jones, 6-2,6-1, both in the first
round.
Ahn had two straight-set wins over Marina
Cossou of Cal by the score of 7-5, 6-3 and Mi
caela Hein of Arizona State with the score 6-4,
6-2. Tan was forced to come back from a set
down in her first match before advancing 2-6,6-
0,6-4. She then upset sixth-seeded Mari Ander
sson, 6-1,6-4 to book her place in the quarterfi
nals. Burdette fought through a tough three-set
ter in the first round, defeating Michelle Brycki
of Arizona State 6-3,4-6,6-3 and then defeating
Annie Goransson of Cal 6-2,7-5.

Four Stanford women advanced in the Pac-10 Championships' singles draw on Thursday, including
Mallory Burdette (above). The fifth-seeded sophomore from Jackson, Ga. won both of her matches
in straight sets and will meet USC's top-seeded Maria Sanchez at 12 p.m.
One player that showed she has
real promise later in the tourna
ment was Gibbs, who took care of
her first round opponent quickly.
She defeated Cristalia Andrews of
USC 6-0, 6-1, to advance early.
Next, she defeated Samantha Smith
of Washington, 7-6(4), 6-2.
"First player I played was solid
all around, but I was keeping one
more ball in the court than her or
forcing the error," Gibbs said. "I
had the advantage in that match
and I carried that through knowing
I was going to have to play the sec
ond match."
"My second opponent, I got
down in the first set 4-2 and 5-3, so
she put a lot of pressure on me and
just made me hit that extra ball,"

Gibbs added. "A lot of times I was
not prepared to hit that extra ball
and I made a lot of unforced errors
in the first set, but I cleaned it up in
the second set."
In the next round, she will face
McCall Jones, the player that de
feated Li earlier in the day. Jones, a
transfer from BYU, is UCLA's No.
1 player but is unseeded in this tour
nament.
"I've never played her so I can't
tell for sure [how she plays], but I
know that she has a serve that can
occasionally break down," Gibbs
said. "I'm ready to take care of that.
I generally do better on my return
game so that's a weakness I need to
exploit."
When Li was asked what ad
vance she'd give her teammate
against Jones, she expressed faith in
Gibbs' playing ability.
"I have so much confidence in
Nicole," Li said. "I would say play
your game and do what you do best.

You're the better player and you're
going to overcome, so I wouldn't be
too worried."
Half of the players in the quar
terfinals wear Stanford colors. Ac
cording to Li, this success in the
tournament reflects the hard work
and commitment put into practice
every day.
"It's amazing, but it's also de
served," Li said. "I don't think most
people see what goes on behind the
scenes and how much work we put
into it each day. Each exercise we
do, each sprint. It's always the little
things that add up. For us, it's a con
stant process and I think it definite
ly pays off when we put in that little
extra effort every day."
The Cardinal enters doubles
play Friday and continues the sin
gles draw with the possibility of an
all-Stanford semifinal still intact.

Four Stanford women advanced in the Pac-10 Championships' singles draw on Thursday, including
Mallory Burdette (above). The fifth-seeded sophomore from Jackson, Ga. won both of her matches
in straight sets and will meet USC's top-seeded Maria Sanchez at 12 p.m.
One player that showed she has
real promise later in the tourna
ment was Gibbs, who took care of
her first round opponent quickly.
She defeated Cristalia Andrews of
USC 6-0, 6-1, to advance early.
Next, she defeated Samantha Smith
of Washington, 7-6(4), 6-2.
"First player I played was solid
all around, but I was keeping one
more ball in the court than her or
forcing the error," Gibbs said. "I
had the advantage in that match
and I carried that through knowing
I was going to have to play the sec
ond match."
"My second opponent, I got
down in the first set 4-2 and 5-3, so
she put a lot of pressure on me and
just made me hit that extra ball,"

Gibbs added. "A lot of times I was
not prepared to hit that extra ball
and I made a lot of unforced errors
in the first set, but I cleaned it up in
the second set."
In the next round, she will face
McCall Jones, the player that de
feated Li earlier in the day. Jones, a
transfer from BYU, is UCLA's No.
1 player but is unseeded in this tour
nament.
"I've never played her so I can't
tell for sure [how she plays], but I
know that she has a serve that can
occasionally break down," Gibbs
said. "I'm ready to take care of that.
I generally do better on my return
game so that's a weakness I need to
exploit."
When Li was asked what ad
vance she'd give her teammate
against Jones, she expressed faith in
Gibbs' playing ability.
"I have so much confidence in
Nicole," Li said. "I would say play
your game and do what you do best.

You're the better player and you're
going to overcome, so I wouldn't be
too worried."
Half of the players in the quar
terfinals wear Stanford colors. Ac
cording to Li, this success in the
tournament reflects the hard work
and commitment put into practice
every day.
"It's amazing, but it's also de
served," Li said. "I don't think most
people see what goes on behind the
scenes and how much work we put
into it each day. Each exercise we
do, each sprint. It's always the little
things that add up. For us, it's a con
stant process and I think it definite
ly pays off when we put in that little
extra effort every day."
The Cardinal enters doubles
play Friday and continues the sin
gles draw with the possibility of an
all-Stanford semifinal still intact.

After the first day of action in the Pac-10
women's singles tournament and invitational,
the Cardinal is in good position to bring home
the title, Stanford has four players in the quar
terfinals of the singles tournament and one
representative in the quarterfinals of the invita
tional.
The Pac-10 Tournament is a singles and dou
bles competition that forces participants to play
double matches for three days in an exhausting
weekend that pits many of the best players in
the country against each other and allows for
very little rest.
"That is one of my least favorite things to
do," said main draw entrant Nicole Gibbs. "I
hate playing back-to-back singles matches. It's
just such a grind. I think everyone did a really
good job just plugging through."
Stanford had three players enter the Pac-10
Women's Invitational sophomore Natalie
Dillon and freshmen Amelia Herring and Eliza
beth Ecker. Herring defeated Stephany Chang
of California 6-4,7-6(6) in the first round before
losing 6-3,6-0 to second-seeded Kim Stubbe of
Arizona. Ecker defeated Hayler H. Miller of
USC 6-4,6-0 in the first round before losing 6-2,
6-0 to fourth-seeded Alice Duranteau of Cal.

Dillon, however, had a first-round bye and
then defeated Megan N. Lester of UCLA, 6-1,6-
3, in the second round to advance to the quarter
finals she will face Susan Mcßann of Arizona
at noon today.
In the main draw, Stanford entered six play
ers with one major exception Stanford's best
player, senior Hilary Barte, decided not to par
ticipate in this tournament to rest. Three of
Stanford's players earned a seed, with Nicole
Gibbs seeded fourth, Mallory Burdette fifth and
Kristie Ahn seventh. All three of these players
advanced to the quarterfinals, along with un
seeded Stacey Tan. Arizona's Sarah Landsman
defeated senior Carolyn McVeigh 6-2, 6-4, and
Li lost to McCall Jones, 6-2,6-1, both in the first
round.
Ahn had two straight-set wins over Marina
Cossou of Cal by the score of 7-5, 6-3 and Mi
caela Hein of Arizona State with the score 6-4,
6-2. Tan was forced to come back from a set
down in her first match before advancing 2-6,6-
0,6-4. She then upset sixth-seeded Mari Ander
sson, 6-1,6-4 to book her place in the quarterfi
nals. Burdette fought through a tough three-set
ter in the first round, defeating Michelle Brycki
of Arizona State 6-3,4-6,6-3 and then defeating
Annie Goransson of Cal 6-2,7-5.
