# Huskies in town for Senior Day
## No. 12 Washington will prove tough test for Card 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After dropping a dramatic weekend se
ries across the Bay last week, the No. 13
Stanford Softball team will try to bounce
back at home this weekend against visiting
Washington. Sunday's game has been desig
nated as Senior Day since this marks the last
Pac-10 home game of the season for the
Cardinal Stanford will honor its two
graduating seniors, pitcher Ashley Chinn
and first baseman Melisa Koutz.
It will likely be tough sledding against the
Huskies (31-8,6-6 Pac-10), who are perenni
al Women's College World Series con
tenders, having won the NCAA title in 2009
and losing to eventual champion Arizona in
last year's quarterfinals.
The games have serious postseason im
plications as well. Stanford and Washington
are currently tied in fifth place in the Pac-10
standings Arizona State is two games
ahead of Cal, Arizona and UCLA at the top
and although both teams are virtually
guaranteed a spot in May's NCAA Tourna
ment, Stanford is still hoping to move up and
play host to a Regional site.

GAME NOTES: The No. 13 Softball team will close out

Washington this weekend. It will be a tough test for the
Cardinal, as the No. 12 Huskies own a 35-21 all-time
series lead and swept Stanford last year. The teams
are jockeying for position in the crowded Pac-10 field,
and are currently tied for fifth.
