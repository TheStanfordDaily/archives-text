# Huskies in town for Senior Day
## No. 12 Washington will prove tough test for Card 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
After dropping a dramatic weekend se
ries across the Bay last week, the No. 13
Stanford Softball team will try to bounce
back at home this weekend against visiting
Washington. Sunday's game has been desig
nated as Senior Day since this marks the last
Pac-10 home game of the season for the
Cardinal Stanford will honor its two
graduating seniors, pitcher Ashley Chinn
and first baseman Melisa Koutz.
It will likely be tough sledding against the
Huskies (31-8,6-6 Pac-10), who are perenni
al Women's College World Series con
tenders, having won the NCAA title in 2009
and losing to eventual champion Arizona in
last year's quarterfinals.
The games have serious postseason im
plications as well. Stanford and Washington
are currently tied in fifth place in the Pac-10
standings Arizona State is two games
ahead of Cal, Arizona and UCLA at the top
and although both teams are virtually
guaranteed a spot in May's NCAA Tourna
ment, Stanford is still hoping to move up and
play host to a Regional site.

GAME NOTES: The No. 13 Softball team will close out
the home Pac-10 slate with a three-game set against
Washington this weekend. It will be a tough test for the
Cardinal, as the No. 12 Huskies own a 35-21 all-time
series lead and swept Stanford last year. The teams
are jockeying for position in the crowded Pac-10 field,
and are currently tied for fifth.

Junior Ashley Hansen is still red
hot at the plate, batting a sizzling
.500 on the season, and was instru
mental in the Cardinal's series win
over UCLA April 8-10 the
team's starting shortstop and two
time Ail-American went 8-13 with
two steals and three RBI on her
way to being named Pac-10 player
of the week.

The rest of the lineup hasn't
been bad either, as second baseman
Jenna Rich is putting together a fine
sophomore campaign with a team
high eight home runs and 38 RBI
while hitting .347. Junior Sarah
Hassman is hitting .402, tenth in the
Pac-10, and has been tearing it up
on the base paths, too her 29
steals leads the Pac-10 by eight.
Against the hard-hitting
Huskies, Stanford will lean heavily
on its two main pitchers, Chinn and
sophomore Teagan Gerhart. Chinn
has quietly put together an All-
American-type of season in her
fourth year on the Farm. The senior
from Belmont, Calif, is seventh in

the Pac-10 in both wins (15) and
ERA (1.89).
Gerhart has also been brilliant
in the circle for the Cardinal thus
far, going 17-8 with a 1.75 ERA in
33 appearances on the year. She is
in the top five in eight categories in
the Pac-10, including fifth in ERA

and third in strikeouts.
She has also shown no lingering
effects from arm surgery last season
that shut her down early. A native of
Norco, Calif., Teagan still managed
to go 22-6 with 173 strikeouts and
18 complete games and threw back
to-back no hitters on her way to All-
Pac-10 Conference Honorable
Mention honors. She has shone in
several big games this season, shut
ting down UCLA in the rubber
match of the teams' showdown
three weeks ago, just two days after
going 13 innings in a loss to the Bru
ins.
This season has also seen her
take to the base paths with reckless
abandon, stealing 21 bases in 21 at
tempts, a stat that is almost unheard
of for a full-time pitcher.
The Cardinal will need to be fir
ing on all cylinders against Wash
ington, which holds a 35-21 all-time
advantage against Stanford. The
Huskies also swept last season's se
ries in Seattle.
First pitch is scheduled for 7 p.m.
on Friday, with a 1 p.m. start on Sat
urday and a 12 p.m. start for Sun
day's Senior Day.

to-back no hitters on her way to All-
Pac-10 Conference Honorable
Mention honors. She has shone in
several big games this season, shut
ting down UCLA in the rubber
match of the teams' showdown
three weeks ago, just two days after
going 13 innings in a loss to the Bru
ins.
This season has also seen her
take to the base paths with reckless
abandon, stealing 21 bases in 21 at
tempts, a stat that is almost unheard
of for a full-time pitcher.
The Cardinal will need to be fir
ing on all cylinders against Wash
ington, which holds a 35-21 all-time
advantage against Stanford. The
Huskies also swept last season's se
ries in Seattle.
First pitch is scheduled for 7 p.m.
on Friday, with a 1 p.m. start on Sat
urday and a 12 p.m. start for Sun
day's Senior Day.
