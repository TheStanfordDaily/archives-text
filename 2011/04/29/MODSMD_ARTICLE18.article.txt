## Jeremy Green declares for NBA Draft 
### â€” Miles Bennett-Smith 
In a move that will likely end his
collegiate career, junior guard Jere
my Green made himself eligible for
the 2011 NBA Draft, according to
head coach Johnny Dawkins. Green
was the fifth-leading scorer in the
Pac-10 last season with 16.7 points
per game.
He will not hire an agent in order
to maintain his NCAA eligibility.
He has until May 8 to withdraw
from the draft and return to school
with his remaining eligibility intact.
In a statement Thursday,
Dawkins said, "This is an exciting
opportunity for Jeremy as he ex
plores his options regarding the
NBA."
There was some speculation that
Green might explore his draft op
tions earlier this month, when it was
announced that he had been sus
pended from school for academic
reasons.
Stanford Athletics spokesman
Brian Risso said that the 6-foot-4
shooting guard's status for next sea
son would not be affected by the
suspension, and that the first-team
All-Pac-10 selection is expected to
play when the Cardinal heads to
Spain for a preseason tour in Sep
tember.
A native of Austin, Texas, Green
is an exceptional shooter who made
88 three-point shots last season,
good for second in the Pac-10, while
shooting at a 43-percent clip. For his
career, he is a 41.3 percent three
point shooter and is in second place
on Stanford's all-time three-point
field goals list with 228 in three sea
sons on the Farm.
Losing Green would leave a
large hole in the Cardinal lineup.
Stanford will graduate no other
players from last season's 15-16
squad, but Green accounted for just
over 25 percent of the team's total
points. Freshmen Anthony Brown,
Gabriel Harris and Robbie
Lemons could all be in the mix for
Green's playing time, as well as po

tentially playing junior starting
point guard Jarrett Mann alongside
freshman point guard Aaron
Bright.
Dawkins has previously said
that he thought Green would re
turn for his senior season. Green
will likely work out for a number of
NBA teams in the next few days to
gauge his draft value before making
a decision in advance of next week
end's deadline.
