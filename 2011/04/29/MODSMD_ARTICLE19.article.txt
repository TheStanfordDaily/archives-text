# Athletes enter draft too early
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
Stanford's very own Jeremy
Green declared for the
NBA Draft yesterday. You
remember him, right? He
was Stanford's leading scor
er this past season, at one point scor
ing over 20 points in five straight
games, all against conference oppo
nents. He's second in school histoiy in
three-pointers made and holds the
single-season record for made triples.
Seems reasonable for him to test
the waters, right? Well, it certainly
seems reasonable when you take into
account his current suspension from
school, which came only a year and a
half after an unrelated suspension
from the team.
Still, I don't know him and I can't
tell you why he really decided to de
clare for the draft. What I can do,
though, is look at his chances at the
next level. And while I'm no draft ex
pert, I have to say I'm skeptical at best
regarding Green's transition to the
pros.

For one thing, school records and
suspensions aside, Green's college ca
reer has left many things to be desired,
among them being team play and shot
selection. He has the worst assist-to
turnover ratio among Stanford play
ers with reasonable playing time, and

he attempted over seven three-point
ers for every assist over his Cardinal
career. He wasn't top three on the
team in steals, rebounds, assists or
blocks, and the team did just as well
when he scored in the single digits (3-
2) as when he broke 20 points (7-6).
Now, this is not meant to be an at
tack on Jeremy Green. He was clearly
Stanford's go-to player this year, and
he has been good for the Stanford
program. It's more about what's good
for Green and all the other under
classmen looking toward the NBA
Draft.
Ever since I was little, I've been
against early entry into drafts. Maybe
it's because I've always liked college

sports better than pro sports and I
wanted to keep the talent in college,
or maybe it's because my parents'
brainwashing in favor of an education
over quick money was actually as suc
cessful as their brainwashing to love
Stanford and hate USC. Nevertheless,
my stance in general has not changed
I still wish players would stay in
college, and I think far too many play
ers leave early.
Still, for many people it's hard to
complain. A guy like Cam Newton,
whose character doesn't exactly sug
gest an emphasis on education,
achieved everything a college player
can at his third college, Auburn, so it
had to be expected that he would
leave. He did, and last night became
the top overall pick, a spot that cer
tainly would have gone to Stanford's
own, Andrew Luck, had Luck pos
sessed similar priorities. But Luck, as
the sports media still cannot come to
grips with, is different from your av
erage superstar athlete.
Other than guys like Luck,
though, the majority of athletes that
have a shot at the pros tries to go to
the pros as quickly as possible. It's un
derstandable that the allure of fame
and fortune and the top level of sport
would drive many athletes to declare
early, but allowing them to do so can
often be a killer blow to their future
potential. D-League rosters are
packed with guys who think they are
going to reach the bright lights of
Madison Square Garden in June and
end up seeing lowa, Tulsa and some
times the Russian tundra.
It's really sad to see, but every year

you watch dozens of guys get told by
some scout that they have pro poten
tial, so they risk their futures to try to
make the NBA now. Plenty of them
don't get drafted, but even getting
drafted doesn't guarantee much. Less
than half of the second-round picks
from the last three drafts are still in
the league, and first-round busts
aren't that uncommon either. Even in
a light draft year like this one, there is
only so much room in the pros for
young guns, so most will get shut out.
In the end, though, what can any
body do? Who is going to go around
telling guys that they aren't good
enough for their dreams to come
true? And what guys are going to lis
ten? If everyone had proper guid
ance on his realistic chances of mak
ing it, things would probably be a lot
different, but proper guidance is as
rare as elite athleticism. The NCAA
just made a small step yesterday by
moving up the deadline for players to
drop out of the draft, but it's unlikely
that this measure will significantly
change things for future underclass
men.
It's tough as a fan watching college
sports and knowing most of the top
players are only using their time as a
sham to fulfill the age requirement.
It's tough as a human being watching
players throw their future potential
away to try to make the big bucks
now.
