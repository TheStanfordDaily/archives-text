# 'YES' ON ROTC RETURN
## Faculty Senate votes in favor of program's return with hopes of closing civilian-military divide 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Following more than a year of re
search and debate, the Faculty Senate
voted on Thursday 28-9, with three ab
stentions, to extend an invitation for
ROTC to return to Stanford. The vote
effectively ends the 40-year ban of the
program on campus.
"We believe that the majority of
students support the return of ROTC,
and a substantial minority opposes it,"
said Committee Chair Ewart Thomas,
professor of psychology.
"No member of our committee ob
jects to the minimizing of violence," he
added. "We offer our recommendation
in favor of minimizing the military
civilian gap."
The ad hoc committee, established
last March, released its report last
week announcing its support for a
Stanford ROTC program. ROTC was
initially voted off campus in 1970 after
concerns of its academic merit were
raised. All ROTC programs were gone
by 1973.
The report initially consisted of six
clauses that served as the cornerstone
of the committee's recommendation,
including the creation of a Stanford
ROTC Committee that would evalu
ate military professors and courses, as
well as serving as a mediator between
the University and the military.
Thomas presented the ad hoc com
mittee's report to the Faculty Senate;
debate then proceeded for more than
an hour.
Professor William Perry '49 M.S.
'55 presented the initial proposal to
investigate Stanford's relationship
with the military last year. He remind
ed the Faculty Senate that they would
not be debating ROTC if Congress
had not recently repealed "don't ask,
don't tell."
"That repeal would not have hap
pened without significant support
from senior military officials in the
U. 5.," he said. "Their enlightened views
are obviously a product of their educa
tion. Stanford has the opportunity to
help create military leaders that will

later make these enlightened deci
sions. This is the single most important
chance you will have to seize that op
portunity."
"We can no longer free-ride on the
public good known as national securi
ty," added history professor David
Kennedy '63.
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
distributed a packet of compiled mate
rials covering a range of student opin
ions about ROTC. He spoke on behalf
of the student body and urged the Sen
ate to vote "no."
"ROTC does not align with the vi
sion of this university," Cruz said.
"Currently, Stanford is one of the
safest communities for transgender
students in the world. I want to make
sure all Stanford students feel safe
enough to call this place home as well.
"A rejection of ROTC is a rejection
of exclusion," he added.
Imani Franklin 'l3, who served as
one of two student representatives on
the ad hoc committee, spoke to the
Faculty Senate about why she support
ed the return of an ROTC program.
"I came onto this committee
knowing little to nothing about mili
tary lifestyles," she said. "Most of my
knowledge of the military came from
watching 'Pearl Harbor.' That is not
okay.
"A large portion of the student
body is entirely removed from a piece
of the American population that
serves in the military," she said.
Franklin said that by allowing
ROTC back onto campus, the Univer
sity could "humanize the people who
fight our wars."
"A huge part of our education at
Stanford is to expose to different ways
of life, nationally and globally," she
said. "Military perspectives have been
invisible on this campus."
Fourteen students currently par
ticipate in ROTC programs through
cross-town agreements with Santa
Clara University, San Jose State and
UC-Berkeley. They do not receive
course credit for their required mil
itary science classes or physical
training.

Some professors asked the commit
tee to clarify specific aspects of its rec
ommendation, including to whom
ROTC commanders would report.The
committee has proposed a program
similar to those found at MIT and
Duke, where a faculty committee re
views each potential professor and
evaluates the content of potential mil
itary science courses.
Later, an amendment was proposed
to ensure that ROTC cadets' chosen
majors were not dictated by their in
volvement in the program.
Political science professor Scott
Sagan, also a member of the commit
tee, said that some students chose to at
tend other universities because of their
ROTC offerings and a return could
make Stanford a more viable option
for prospective students.
"Some students do choose other
universities over Stanford who offer
on-campus ROTC programs," he said.
Others expressed concern about
the implications of interpreting the
University's nondiscrimination poli
cy in light of an endorsed ROTC pro
gram.
"With respect to 'don't ask, don't
tell,' that goal is not yet accomplished
nor irreversible," political science pro
fessor Gary Segura said.
"There is no evidence for any pal
pable benefits to Stanford," he
added. "Furthermore, it will always
be an asterisk on our nondiscrimina
tion policy."
Graduate Student Council repre
sentative Justin Brown echoed this
sentiment.
"How large does a group of stu
dents need to be so that they can feel as
though their civil rights are acknowl
edged and protected?" he asked.
However, University general coun
sel Debra Zumwalt said that formal
recognition of ROTC would not vio
late the nondiscrimination policy as it
currently stands.
"Our policy prevents against illegal
discrimination," she explained. "Based
on all the information we have, we do

Stanford Students for Queer Liberation and others organized a protest attended by more than 30 outside the Law School before the
Faculty Senate meeting. Many chanted demands for equal rights, while other protesters handed out antiwar literature. Some protestors
waited outside of the auditorium at the conclusion of the meeting and voiced disappointment with the Faculty Senate's ROTC decision.

not see an illegal discrimination
and [ROTC] does not violate our
policy."
Additionally, Thomas said that a
small group of members of the
transgender community told the
committee they would not partici
pate in ROTC even if the ban on
openly serving were lifted.
Regardless, Brown said that
even the debate over the last

months has caused significant stress
for many of the parties involved.
"I have never seen the student
body so divisive," he said.
"ft is reasonable to predict,
many members of the community
would regard this as the correct de
cision, while others will see it as a
mistake," Thomas said. "Our re
search over the last year shows that
this program will prevail into the
future in shaping a more vibrant
community."
The Faculty Senate ultimately
voted in favor of the committee's
recommendation with three addi
tional amendments, including a

condemnation of the military's dis
criminatory policies against trans
gender people.
"Our support for reestablishing
the ROTC program should not be
misconstrued," read a joint state
ment released by President John
Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy. "We understand the
concerns about the military's con
tinuing discrimination against
transgender people, and we share
those concerns. But if the leader
ship of the military is drawn from
communities that teach and prac
tice true tolerance, change is more
likely to occur.The U.S. military has

demonstrated an ability and will
ingness to change over time, and
we believe Stanford can contribute
by providing leaders capable of
helping create that change."
Approximately 30 students, in
cluding members of Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation
(SSQL) and Stanford Says No to
War, waited outside of the Law
School to protest the Faculty Sen
ate's decision, while others ap
plauded the committee members
as they exited.
