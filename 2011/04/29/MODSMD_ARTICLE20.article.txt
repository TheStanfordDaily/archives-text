# Klahn, Lin still alive at Pac-10s

### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The members of the Stanford
men's tennis team selected to par
ticipate in the Pac-10 Champi
onships enjoyed a successful day in
Ojai, Calif, on Thursday, going un
defeated in the early rounds of
Thursday's singles action. The tour
nament is a non-team event, with
singles and doubles crowns award
ed to the winners of those two re
spective tournaments.
The Cardinal, as a team, has not
lost for more than a month, with its
most recent defeat coming against
Baylor back on March 25. In that
span, the team has played and
won 10 matches, its longest win
ning streak since 2003. The wave of
momentum has also boosted the
team all the way up to No. 6 in the
country.
The team will take a few weeks
off until the NCAA Championships
begin May 19 at Taube Tennis Cen
ter, where it will try to continue that
streak and finish what has already
been a historic season in style.
In individual tournaments,
matchups are not determined by
team, so players from the same
school often face off against each
other. Luckily for the Cardinal,
which has five players entered in
the singles draw and three teams in
doubles, this scenario did not hap
pen on Thursday.
Four of the five individual Stan
ford participants made it to the sec
ond round, through the round of 32
and into the round of 16. No. 2 jun
ior Bradley Klahn, No. 4 junior
Ryan Thacher, senior Alex Clayton
and sophomore Dennis Lin all sur
vived in straight sets. Sophomore
Matt Kandath, playing in his first
Pac-10 Championship, fell to USC

foe Raymond Sarmiento in the
opening round. The doubles draw is
slated to begin today.
Klahn, Thacher and Clayton all
have experience in this event, with
Klahn winning as a freshman back
in 2009 and reaching the semifinals
last year Klahn and Thacher
took home the doubles crown that
year as well. The Stanford junior,
who is also the reigning NCAA sin
gles champion, is one of the fa
vorites to bring home at least one
trophy this weekend.
In the second round of the sin
gles tournament, completed late
Thursday afternoon, two of the re
maining Stanford players fell. Clay
ton was the first to lose, falling vic
tim to UCLA's fifth-seeded Amit
Inbar in two closely contested sets.
Teammate Thacher joined him in
the ranks of the defeated, succumb
ing to another Bruin, Adrian Puget,
in the match of the day three
very tight sets, ultimately ending in
a tie-breaker in the final set.
But offsetting those two losses
were victories by both Klahn and
Lin in the round of 16, with Klahn
defeating Oregon's Robin Cambier
in three sets and Lin taking down
USC's Daniel Nguyen in two
tiebreaker-sets. The two remaining
Cardinal players are on the same
half of the draw, meaning that if
they both were to win today's Elite
Eight matches, the two would face
off against each other in the semifi
nals.
The Pac-10 Championships will
continue today at the Ojai Valley
Tennis Club with Lin squaring off
against Cal's Nick Andrews and
Klahn facing USC's Ray Sarmiento.
Both matches begin at noon.
