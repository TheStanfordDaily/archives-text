# Juniors Lawson, Shoji named First Team All-Americans
## 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
For the second year in a row, jun
ior outside hitter Brad Lawson and
junior libero Erik Shoji were
named American Volleyball
Coaches Association (AVCA) First
Team All-Americans. It is the third
honor for Shoji and the second for
Lawson. Shoji is just the second
Stanford player in program history
to receive three first-team honors
from the AVCA.
Both natives of Honolulu,
Hawaii, Lawson and Shoji helped
lead the No. 4 Cardinal to a 19-9
record this season and a third place
finish in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation. Despite losing
in the first round of the MPSF tour
nament against Long Beach State
last Saturday, the Cardinal still have
an outside shot at earning the sole
at-large bid for the four-team
NCAA Tournament and a chance

to repeat as national champions.
On the way, Shoji set the Stanfor
career record for digs, and his sea
son stats of 286 total digs and 2.62
digs per set both ranked second in
the country. Lawson put together a
similarly dominant junior cam
paign, moving up to No. 2 on Stan
ford's all-time kills list in the rally
scoring era while averaging 4.33
kills per set and a sporting a .331
hitting percentage. In last year's
NCAA final against Penn State,
Lawson had one of the most im
pressive single games for an outside
hitter in postseason history, tallying
24 kills on just 28 attacks and chip
ping in four aces to boot.
Stanford will learn its fate on
Sunday when the selection commit
tee convenes and will announce the
at-large bid for the NCAA Tourna
ment. The tournament will begin on
May 5 in University Park, Penn.
