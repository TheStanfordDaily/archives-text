## Yale death, PRL fire spur new machine shop rules 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Officials from Stanford's Depart
ment of Environmental Health and
Safety (EH&S) met with University
leadership Monday to present newly
drafted, institution-wide machine
shop safety guidelines. The move, a
departure from the University's
hands-off policy, was prompted by
the April 11 death of Yale senior
Michele Dufault and Saturday's
after-hours fire at the Product Real
ization Lab (PRL).
Dufault died from accidental as
phyxia after her hair caught in a
metal lathe. No one was hurt in the
PRL fire.
According to EH&S Associate
Vice Provost Larry Gibbs, the
change aims to create a common
safety standard for machine shops
across campus and to increase stu
dent accountability.
While all campus machine shops
operate under policies that match in
dustry protocol all of them man
date practices like tying back hair,
removing jewelry, wearing closed
toe shoes and never working alone
they don't have a consistent way
of holding students accountable for
following these regulations.
"We did a lot of review of what
goes in an industry, and what we
found is that in the industry if you
don't follow the rules, you no longer
have employment," Gibbs said.
"Now, we don't employ students, but
we have to say there's an accounta
bility expectation that goes along
with the use of these tools that have
a potential for harming individuals."
According to Gibbs, the pro
posed guidelines would establish a
standard disciplinary procedure for
students who are found noncompli
ant with the shop's safety standards:
they could be denied access to the
University's machine shops and, if
they are taking an undergraduate
machine shop class, their grade in the
course could fall as well. In addition,
he said the draft would standardize
the safety policies of shops across
campus.
"We want to allow a level of dis
cretion locally," Gibbs said. "At the
same time, we want to make sure
that people aren't harmed by what
takes place in the machine shops
either themselves or the people
around them."
Right now, safety guidelines vary
slightly across the different machine
shops.
Before using the PRL's equip
ment, students are required to regis
ter online, attend an hour and 15-
minute orientation and purchase a li
cense, which ranges in price from $2O
for a day pass to $3OO for a yearlong
pass.
PRL Co-Director Craig Milroy
'BO M.S. 'B2 said the orientation isn't
a training class for students, but a
way to "get them adjusted mentally
to this kind of environment."
During the orientation, supervi
sors go over safety rules with the stu
dents, explain potential hazards in
the building and, during the last 20
minutes, take them on a walking tour
of the facility. This tour includes
three major areas: the model shop,
the machine shop and the foundry.
Milroy said almost 900 students
are licensed to work in the PRL each

year, marking nearly a four-fold in
crease from the 250 users in 1992. He
added that the growth in registrants
is probably due to the fact that many
of the campus' machine shops have
been closed down over the years.
The PRL is a teaching lab that
employs student teaching assistants
to be on duty whenever the facility is
open. It's normally open in three
four-hour blocks throughout the
day.
The co-directors of the lab select
TAs for the upcoming year in April.
After getting the job, the TAs must
arrive at the Farm before the start of
the autumn quarter for two weeks of
training. The TAs help eliminate the
risk of students operating equip
ment without supervision, Milroy
said.
"Under our guidelines of opera
tion, whenever the shop is open,
there has to be someone on duty,"
Milroy said. "So a person will never
be working alone if that's the case."
However, a small subset of PRL
users is part of an "extended use
community" that is allowed to access
the facility during off-hours. At these
times, TAs are also off duty. Gibbs
said one issue EH&S hopes to ad
dress with its new guidelines is shop
use by individuals when no one else
is there.
"The dilemma and the challenge
that we know about is that graduate
and undergraduate students prefer
to use the shops when they have ac
cess, which is oftentimes after
hours," Gibbs said. "One of the main
components of our program is to
make sure nobody is using that when
there's not somebody else there."
Unlike the PRL, the Physics Ma
chine Shop is a research lab that fo
cuses on supporting the physics com
munity and building customized
parts for other departments. Accord
ing to the shop's supervisor, Karl
heinz Merkle, no one is allowed to
use the equipment until they take an
18-hour training and certification
course.
He said that while the shop has
not experienced any accidents, it has
been subtly affected by the recent
events.
"Whenever there is anything as
tragic as what happened at Yale, you
take a step back and say, 'How are we
doing things? Is everybody as safe as
we can make it safe?"' Merkle said.
Milroy agreed.
"Any time an event like that hap
pens, of course it's going to have an
impact on how we operate," he said.
In particular, Milroy said fire
safety would be a major topic at this
Friday's weekly staff meeting, which
is attended by the co-directors and
TAs. He also said it was likely that
they would add a few sentences to
next year's safety orientation about
how to deal with and prevent fires.
EH&S has sent copies of the draft
to the individual machine shops and
is looking to get feedback, Gibbs
said. He added that the policy would
most likely be approved soon.
"We believe we have a good safe
ty program," he said. "We believe
people here are attuned to, and cer
tainly aware of, making sure we work
in a safe environment. And we want
to continue that."

operate under policies that match in
dustry protocol all of them man
date practices like tying back hair,
removing jewelry, wearing closed
toe shoes and never working alone
they don't have a consistent way
of holding students accountable for
following these regulations.
"We did a lot of review of what
goes in an industry, and what we
found is that in the industry if you
don't follow the rules, you no longer
have employment," Gibbs said.
"Now, we don't employ students, but
we have to say there's an accounta
bility expectation that goes along
with the use of these tools that have
a potential for harming individuals."
According to Gibbs, the pro
posed guidelines would establish a
standard disciplinary procedure for
students who are found noncompli
ant with the shop's safety standards:
they could be denied access to the
University's machine shops and, if
they are taking an undergraduate
machine shop class, their grade in the
course could fall as well. In addition,
he said the draft would standardize
the safety policies of shops across
campus.
"We want to allow a level of dis
cretion locally," Gibbs said. "At the
same time, we want to make sure
that people aren't harmed by what
takes place in the machine shops
either themselves or the people
around them."
Right now, safety guidelines vary
slightly across the different machine
shops.
Before using the PRL's equip
ment, students are required to regis
ter online, attend an hour and 15-
minute orientation and purchase a li
cense, which ranges in price from $2O
for a day pass to $3OO for a yearlong
pass.
PRL Co-Director Craig Milroy
'BO M.S. 'B2 said the orientation isn't
a training class for students, but a
way to "get them adjusted mentally
to this kind of environment."
During the orientation, supervi
sors go over safety rules with the stu
dents, explain potential hazards in
the building and, during the last 20
minutes, take them on a walking tour
of the facility. This tour includes
three major areas: the model shop,
the machine shop and the foundry.
Milroy said almost 900 students
are licensed to work in the PRL each

year, marking nearly a four-fold in
crease from the 250 users in 1992. He
added that the growth in registrants
is probably due to the fact that many
of the campus' machine shops have
been closed down over the years.
The PRL is a teaching lab that
employs student teaching assistants
to be on duty whenever the facility is
open. It's normally open in three
four-hour blocks throughout the
day.
The co-directors of the lab select
TAs for the upcoming year in April.
After getting the job, the TAs must
arrive at the Farm before the start of
the autumn quarter for two weeks of
training. The TAs help eliminate the
risk of students operating equip
ment without supervision, Milroy
said.
"Under our guidelines of opera
tion, whenever the shop is open,
there has to be someone on duty,"
Milroy said. "So a person will never
be working alone if that's the case."
However, a small subset of PRL
users is part of an "extended use
community" that is allowed to access
the facility during off-hours. At these
times, TAs are also off duty. Gibbs
said one issue EH&S hopes to ad
dress with its new guidelines is shop
use by individuals when no one else
is there.
"The dilemma and the challenge
that we know about is that graduate
and undergraduate students prefer
to use the shops when they have ac
cess, which is oftentimes after
hours," Gibbs said. "One of the main
components of our program is to
make sure nobody is using that when
there's not somebody else there."
Unlike the PRL, the Physics Ma
chine Shop is a research lab that fo
cuses on supporting the physics com
munity and building customized
parts for other departments. Accord
ing to the shop's supervisor, Karl
heinz Merkle, no one is allowed to
use the equipment until they take an
18-hour training and certification
course.
He said that while the shop has
not experienced any accidents, it has
been subtly affected by the recent
events.
"Whenever there is anything as
tragic as what happened at Yale, you
take a step back and say, 'How are we
doing things? Is everybody as safe as
we can make it safe?"' Merkle said.
Milroy agreed.
"Any time an event like that hap
pens, of course it's going to have an
impact on how we operate," he said.
In particular, Milroy said fire
safety would be a major topic at this
Friday's weekly staff meeting, which
is attended by the co-directors and
TAs. He also said it was likely that
they would add a few sentences to
next year's safety orientation about
how to deal with and prevent fires.
EH&S has sent copies of the draft
to the individual machine shops and
is looking to get feedback, Gibbs
said. He added that the policy would
most likely be approved soon.
"We believe we have a good safe
ty program," he said. "We believe
people here are attuned to, and cer
tainly aware of, making sure we work
in a safe environment. And we want
to continue that."

Officials from Stanford's Depart
ment of Environmental Health and
Safety (EH&S) met with University
leadership Monday to present newly
drafted, institution-wide machine
shop safety guidelines. The move, a
departure from the University's
hands-off policy, was prompted by
the April 11 death of Yale senior
Michele Dufault and Saturday's
after-hours fire at the Product Real
ization Lab (PRL).
Dufault died from accidental as
phyxia after her hair caught in a
metal lathe. No one was hurt in the
PRL fire.
According to EH&S Associate
Vice Provost Larry Gibbs, the
change aims to create a common
safety standard for machine shops
across campus and to increase stu
dent accountability.
While all campus machine shops
operate under policies that match in
dustry protocol all of them man
date practices like tying back hair,
removing jewelry, wearing closed
toe shoes and never working alone
