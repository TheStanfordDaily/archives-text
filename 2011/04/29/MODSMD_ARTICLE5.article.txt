## FacSen approves stem cell doctoral program New track bridges 'basic sciences to clinical outcomes' 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate approved a
new interdisciplinary program in
stem cell biology and regenerative
medicine (SCBRM) in a unanimous
voice vote on Thursday. The
SCBRM program seeks a five-year
trial period beginning Sept. 11,2011
through Aug. 31,2016.
"It's a pleasure to see the cutting
edge research being translated into
the teaching program," said Richard
Roberts, chair of the Committee on
Graduate Studies (C-GS).
The SCBRM program, once es
tablished, would be the first doctoral
program of its kind.
"Stem cell biology and regenera
tive medicine is a discipline apart
from genetics, from developmental
biology, from basic biology, from
medicine," Roberts said.
"It draws from those fields, but
moves beyond them," he added.
The proposed program is set to
feature top-notch principal investi
gators (Pis), new laboratories in the
Lorry Lokey Stem Cell Building and

financing from California's Stem
Cell Initiative. Admission to the pro
gram will only be offered to doctoral
candidates. The conferral of master's
degrees will serve as a "consolation"
prize for those students who do not
obtain their Ph.D.
John Pringle, senior associate
dean of the School of Medicine,
lauded the program as "a valuable
thing to bring forward."
Professor of obstetrics and gyne
cology Renee Pera described the
program as "bridging the basic sci
ences to clinical outcomes."
Despite its lofty goals, the
SCBRM program had humble be
ginnings. According to C-GS mem
bers, the origins of the new interdis
ciplinary program came from the
bottom up.
"It's been several years in pro
duction and we'd like to say that it re
ally initiated at the grassroots," said
Theo Palmer, associate professor of
neurosurgery. "We became aware of
this through conversations with our
current graduate students and in
coming graduate students."
The Faculty Senate's approval of
the new program signals "a very ex
citing time for the field," Palmer said.
