## MARKS MY WORDS Pushing the Right Buttons 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
It was one of those spur-of-the
moment decisions. I had to get to
the fourth floor of Sweet Hall
where I was late for a meeting. But
did I want to stumble into the room
gasping for breath? I'm no
marathon-runner, but I knew that if
I ran up three flights of stairs right
before a meeting, I wouldn't make a
good impression. There was only
one other choice.
I looked over at, yes, the eleva
tor. I cringed. The environmentally
friendly culture in the Bay Area has
taught me never to do something
with a machine that my own mus
cles can't do. Thanks to my time at
Stanford, I get uncomfortable when
I'm in a car because 50 miles really
shouldn't be too far to bike, right?
But this particular situation seemed
too dire.
I prepared myself for what
would come next. Elevator conver
sations are uniquely different from
any others; you're stuck in a tiny,
tiny space with a stranger, but only
for a couple minutes. It's not like an
airplane, when you both know that
you'll get to rub elbows for a few
hours. It's not passing by someone
on the street because in that setting
you could both be going anywhere
or doing anything.
But if you're in an elevator with
someone, you have something in
common by default you're in the
same elevator. That might mean
that you're in the same hotel togeth
er, you're visiting the same office to
gether or maybe you live in the
same apartment building. The com
monality that you share places
some conversational pressure on
you.
This pressure to make conversa
tion is at the same time countered
by your knowledge that, if this per
son gets off at the next floor, you
want the conversation to have
reached a natural end. At the same
time, you don't want to have a pleas
antly abrupt exchange followed by
another minute of silence while you
both realize you're going to the
highest floors of the building. As
some might say: awkwaaaard.
As a result, sometimes it is far
easier not to talk at all. And that's
why I usually stare at the wall, or at
the panel of numbers in front of me,
or at a spot next to my feet. Some
times small talk just isn't really
worth it.
I've tried it before. And unfortu
nately, Sweet Hall has been the site
of some sub-par elevator encoun
ters for me. One time, I knew I had
a meeting somewhere in the build-

ing, and I suspected it was the fourth
floor. I waited with another student,
we got in the elevator together and
it was soon obvious that we were
both traveling to the 4th floor. Since
I wasn't sure where the meeting
was, I opened first.
"Hey, are you here for the 6 p.m.
meeting?" He was too! No way. "Do
you know where it is?" He thought
it was on the fourth floor. By the
time we'd gotten through those few
lines of conversation, speaking
slowly and with naturally drawn
out pauses, the elevator arrived at
the fourth floor.
What happened next was that we
ended up taking two more elevator
rides together. The meeting was not
on the fourth floor. So we rode
down to the second floor, his next
guess. The meeting was not there ei
ther. And lastly we rode up to the
third floor, where we finally found
our meeting. At this point we'd had
several less than ideal exchanges
along the lines of, "So, what year are
you?" Insert answer. "Cool." "So,
what's your major?" Insert answer.
"Nice." Not knowing when our con
versation would have to be over, we
instead had a bunch of mini conver
sations, none of which were particu
larly satisfactory. It was rough.

Elevator conversations
are uniquely different
from any others; you're
stuck in a tiny, tiny space
with a stranger, but only
for a few minutes.

But the other day my fortunes
turned. I entered Sweet Hall and, too
daunted by the stairs, turned to the
elevator and the guy in front of it.
"Hey, are you going up? " " Yup!" We
wait, and the elevator took an oddly
long time to arrive, so we shot each
other some questioningly amused
glances. "Is it coming, or should we
take the stairs?" we both seemed to
say to one another, but finally the el
evator doors slid open before us.
Once in the elevator, I pushed
four and asked him for his floor. He
said three. I tested the waters. "Oh
okay, floor three ... that's fine. If
you were going to floor two, I
would've judged. Can't you walk up
one flight of stairs?"

It was a pretty loaded comment,
but he responded with a laugh and
agreed that you're only justified in
taking the elevator if you're going
up at least two flights of stairs. I
laughed too and told him that I
couldn't risk getting to my meeting
if I were panting like a dog. Laughs
all around, and soon enough he got
to floor three and departed.
Our exchange was perfectly
timed. It took up the precise tempo
ral duration of the elevator ride. It
was friendly and thankfully lacked
the strained undertone of some
small talk. And it actually left me
wishing that not all short-lived ele
vator conversations had to end be
cause great people pop up in all
types of places, elevators included.
