## A
						Thumb on the Scale of Justice 
### MIKE ARMSTRONG '70 DANIEL BARTON J.D. '88 
In light of President Hennessy's
recent unilateral decision to
change the burden of proof in
student misconduct proceedings
when sexual assault or domestic vio
lence is alleged, we began to ques
tion the legitimacy of the fact-find
ing process in those proceedings. In
so doing, we reviewed the training
materials provided to hearing offi
cers for those cases. Those materials
confirmed our suspicion that Stan
ford is putting its thumb on the scale
of justice. Quite simply, judicial pan
elists are trained to be biased against
the accused.
It is a fundamental concept of
American democracy, justice and
due process that a fair tribunal is one
with an impartial judge. Stanford
students accused of misconduct
have the right to judicial panelists
free from bias.
Yet, Stanford trains its judicial
panelists, who will hear and decide
disciplinary proceedings involving
allegations of sexual assault and do
mestic violence, that neutrality is not
only unattainable but something
which should be avoided. Neutrality,
the panelists are trained, makes the
fact-finder an accomplice to the
abuse and further victimizes the
complainants.
Specifically, panelists are provid
ed with an article by Lundy Ban
croft called "Why Does He Do
That? Inside the Minds of Angry
and Controlling Men." The article
instructs fact-finders that, "When
people take a neutral stand between
you and your abusive partner, they
are in effect supporting him and
abandoning you, no matter how

much they may claim otherwise."
Further, the panelists are taught
that, "to remain neutral is to collude
with the abusive man, whether or
not that is your goal."
Another article provided to judi
cial panelists is equally biased
against the accused, who is almost
invariably referred to as a male. That
document is from the Center for Re
lationship Abuse Awareness and
provides judicial panelists with "in
dicators" of an "abuser." It states
that an abuser will "feel victimized"
and "act persuasive and logical." An
impartial training system would not
teach judicial panelists that if an ac
cused defends himself persuasively
and logically, they should infer that
he is an "abuser." The Bancroft arti
cle admonishes, "Everyone should
be very, very cautious in accepting a
man's claim that he has been wrong
ly accused of abuse or violence. The
great majority of allegations of
abuse though not all are sub
stantially accurate. An abuser al
most never 'seems like the type.'"
Panelists are also provided with
a document titled "Abuser Ac
countability," which states that an
"abuser" becomes accountable
when he admits that his behavior
was "unprovoked," apparently ig
noring the reality that instances of
sexual assault and domestic vio
lence are almost always relational
and do not occur in a vacuum.
The intended effect of these ma
terials is abundantly clear from the
training evaluation, which asks par
ticipants to list three steps that
