# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Fighting the Good Fight 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I could talk about what I found
problematic with what went on in
the Faculty Senate meeting,
about how I felt the vote was rushed,
that I felt that the Faculty Senate
wasn't educated enough (and they
admitted it, too). I could criticize all
of the shady deals that went on, like
the subtle change to the nondiscrim
ination clause that added the word
"unlawful" such that it no longer tol
erated just "discrimination" but "un
lawful" discrimination (which brings
up the question of what counts as
"lawful" discrimination). But hon
estly, that's a conversation that I'm
too emotionally exhausted to en
gage in right now.
We lost. The Faculty Senate
passed a resolution, and ROTC is
going to return to Stanford. The
meeting was streamed live in Cub
berley. I was present in that auditori
um when the Faculty Senate voted
and the resolution passed. People
cheered, and in the front, someone
popped open a bottle of champagne
in celebration.
I remember heading over to the
Law School immediately afterward.
I watched as the Faculty Senate
members filed out. Several of my ac
tivist friends were already there,
holding up signs and chanting and
condemning them for their vote. I
was too tired, too numb to shout. I
didn't have the strength to lift a sign.
I stood to the side with my transgen
der friends. We didn't have to say
anything. We all felt the same way.
We cried.
I knew the vote was expected, but
that doesn't make it hurt any less.
Hearing all these transphobic things
from both faculty and students these

past several weeks have left me feel
ing afraid and unsafe at my own
school. My trans friends and I have
spent a lot more time off campus this
quarter because of it. I've struggled
to keep up with work. I can't sleep.
I'm tired.
From this experience, I learned
about the world of trans activism. It's
fighting and losing a lot and feeling
down and then getting up and fight
ing again. It's an uphill battle the
whole way. You're going to lose, A
lot. People will say awful things and
laugh and pour themselves a glass of
champagne in celebration of your
loss, as you stand to the side, com
forting a crying friend, while you're
close to tears yourself. You're going
to wonder if it's worth it to keep
fighting, and deep down a voice says
it is but right now, you're plagued
with a heartache that you feel will
never go away. But then after a week
or two of moping about, you have to
pack up and start up the next fight.
Because that's the only thing you can
do.
You're going to get angry. You're
going to doubt yourself. You're going
to cry. You're going to feel betrayed
by institutions and people you once
trusted. You're going to shout till you
lose your voice. You're going to write

till you're sick of it. You will feel
like nobody's listening to you. But
you keep fighting, thinking maybe
the next fight might be that victory.
You don't know. But fighting and
losing is better than not fighting at
all because despite your loss,
people hear about you. And visi
bility is key for a population that
has remained invisible for so long.
And it's that hope that keeps you
going.
You're going to feel broken
more than you want to, but when
you pick up the pieces, you man
age to see some good things that
come out of all these awful situa
tions. The ROTC debate thrust
transgender issues to the forefront
not only at Stanford but also
across the nation something I
could not even imagine two years
ago when I was first coming out.
Many people learned for the first
time the meaning of the word
"transgender." And though I felt
the movements against ROTC
here on campus were problematic,
a community banded together and
fought for me, which I appreciate,
because despite its problems, it
would have been much worse if
people didn't care and nothing

happened at all. I gained a lot of
friends and unexpected allies. I
will look back on this moment,
and though I will regard it as a
dark time in my life, I met a lot of
great people, people who I will
treasure and never take for grant
ed.
I heard that an average trans
gender activist lasts about four
years before he or she burns out. It
makes a lot of sense. Losing a lot is
bound to get you tired. Who
knows, that might be me. I just
know that I'm in it for as long as
I'm in it, and if I get tired and cyni
cal, someone younger and fresh
faced is going to take up the cause
for me until they get tired too. It
seems like an endless fight, but I
have hope that with each succes
sive generation of activists, we're
going to move a bit closer to victo
ry. As long as I can take it, I'm
going to keep fighting.
Despite the ROTC vote, Stan
ford has improved significantly
since I came out as transgender my
sophomore year. But there's still a
lot to be done. The activism sur
rounding the ROTC debate has
caused a lot of momentum for the
trans rights movement, and I feel
like it'll only go up from here. But
then again, one of my flaws is my
relentless optimism. We'll see.

ago when I was first coming out.
Many people learned for the first
time the meaning of the word
"transgender." And though I felt
the movements against ROTC
here on campus were problematic,
a community banded together and
fought for me, which I appreciate,
because despite its problems, it
would have been much worse if
people didn't care and nothing

happened at all. I gained a lot of
friends and unexpected allies. I
will look back on this moment,
and though I will regard it as a
dark time in my life, I met a lot of
great people, people who I will
treasure and never take for grant
ed.
I heard that an average trans
gender activist lasts about four
years before he or she burns out. It
makes a lot of sense. Losing a lot is
bound to get you tired. Who
knows, that might be me. I just
know that I'm in it for as long as
I'm in it, and if I get tired and cyni
cal, someone younger and fresh
faced is going to take up the cause
for me until they get tired too. It
seems like an endless fight, but I
have hope that with each succes
sive generation of activists, we're
going to move a bit closer to victo
ry. As long as I can take it, I'm
going to keep fighting.
Despite the ROTC vote, Stan
ford has improved significantly
since I came out as transgender my
sophomore year. But there's still a
lot to be done. The activism sur
rounding the ROTC debate has
caused a lot of momentum for the
trans rights movement, and I feel
like it'll only go up from here. But
then again, one of my flaws is my
relentless optimism. We'll see.

I could talk about what I found
problematic with what went on in
the Faculty Senate meeting,
about how I felt the vote was rushed,
that I felt that the Faculty Senate
wasn't educated enough (and they
admitted it, too). I could criticize all
of the shady deals that went on, like
the subtle change to the nondiscrim
ination clause that added the word
"unlawful" such that it no longer tol
erated just "discrimination" but "un
lawful" discrimination (which brings
up the question of what counts as
"lawful" discrimination). But hon
estly, that's a conversation that I'm
too emotionally exhausted to en
gage in right now.
We lost. The Faculty Senate
passed a resolution, and ROTC is
going to return to Stanford. The
meeting was streamed live in Cub
berley. I was present in that auditori
um when the Faculty Senate voted
and the resolution passed. People
cheered, and in the front, someone
popped open a bottle of champagne
in celebration.
I remember heading over to the
Law School immediately afterward.
I watched as the Faculty Senate
members filed out. Several of my ac
tivist friends were already there,
holding up signs and chanting and
condemning them for their vote. I
was too tired, too numb to shout. I
didn't have the strength to lift a sign.
I stood to the side with my transgen
der friends. We didn't have to say
anything. We all felt the same way.
We cried.
I knew the vote was expected, but
that doesn't make it hurt any less.
Hearing all these transphobic things
from both faculty and students these

past several weeks have left me feel
ing afraid and unsafe at my own
school. My trans friends and I have
spent a lot more time off campus this
quarter because of it. I've struggled
to keep up with work. I can't sleep.
I'm tired.
From this experience, I learned
about the world of trans activism. It's
fighting and losing a lot and feeling
down and then getting up and fight
ing again. It's an uphill battle the
whole way. You're going to lose, A
lot. People will say awful things and
laugh and pour themselves a glass of
champagne in celebration of your
loss, as you stand to the side, com
forting a crying friend, while you're
close to tears yourself. You're going
to wonder if it's worth it to keep
fighting, and deep down a voice says
it is but right now, you're plagued
with a heartache that you feel will
never go away. But then after a week
or two of moping about, you have to
pack up and start up the next fight.
Because that's the only thing you can
do.
You're going to get angry. You're
going to doubt yourself. You're going
to cry. You're going to feel betrayed
by institutions and people you once
trusted. You're going to shout till you
lose your voice. You're going to write

till you're sick of it. You will feel
like nobody's listening to you. But
you keep fighting, thinking maybe
the next fight might be that victory.
You don't know. But fighting and
losing is better than not fighting at
all because despite your loss,
people hear about you. And visi
bility is key for a population that
has remained invisible for so long.
And it's that hope that keeps you
going.
You're going to feel broken
more than you want to, but when
you pick up the pieces, you man
age to see some good things that
come out of all these awful situa
tions. The ROTC debate thrust
transgender issues to the forefront
not only at Stanford but also
across the nation something I
could not even imagine two years
ago when I was first coming out.
