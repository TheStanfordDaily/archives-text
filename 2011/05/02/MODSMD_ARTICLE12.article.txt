With an impressive showing at the Pac-10
Championships, the Stanford women's tennis
team proved to the league how deep its squad
really is. Sophomores Natalie Dillon and Mallo
ry Burdette brought home the women's invita
tional doubles title, and freshman Kristie Ahn
earned the Pac-10 women's championship
crown in singles.

"Ojai is such a great tournament," Dillon
said. "It's been going on for over a hundred
years.There's a lot of tradition that is connected
with the tournament, so I was very honored to
be a part of it."
A participant in the women's invitational
singles, Dillon made it to the quarterfinals and
had a match-point opportunity, but still lost to
Susan Mcßann of Arizona in three sets, 2-6,6-1,
7-5.
Her true success came in doubles, playing
with Burdette. After receiving a first-round bye,
they won their next three matches and took
home the invitational doubles title. The duo de
feated the top three seeds on their way to victo
ry, taking down Courtney Dolehide and Nina
Pantic of UCLA, the second-seeded team, in an
8-6 final match for the crown.
"It was such a pleasure to play with Mall,"
Dillon said. "She's obviously a world-class dou
bles player so I feel like I learned a lot just from
playing with her. It was a lot of fun to beat the
Trojans, beat the Bruins and beat the Bears.
Having a championship under your belt gives
you a certain confidence to do better in future
competitions."
In the main draw for doubles, Stanford en
tered two teams: the freshman duo of Kristie
Ahn and Nicole Gibbs, and the senior-sopho
more pair of Carolyn McVeigh and Stacey Tan.
McVeigh and Tan lost in the second round to
fourth-seeded Micaela Hein and Kelcy McKen
na of Arizona State, 8-5. Ahn and Gibbs made it
one round further, to the semifinals, before los
ing to the top seed Mari Andersson and Jana Ju
ricova of Cal, 8-5.

With three players in the semifinals of the
singles main draw, Stanford had one of its best
showings of the past couple years. On one side
of the draw was a matchup of Stanford's top two
freshmen of the year: Ahn and Gibbs. On the
other side, Tan was taking on the top seed Maria
Sanchez of USC.
"That was a really good showing," Tan said.
"I was so proud of how everyone did, not just
myself, but everyone else too. I think it shows
the rest of the country how strong of a team we
are all around."
Ahn was responsible for the second Stanford
title of the weekend. Playing through the bot
tom half of the bracket, she came in with the sev
enth seed and received an early break when sec

ond-seeded Venise Chan on the same side of
the bracket as Ahn suffered an upset loss in
the first round. This means that Ahn was not
forced to face a seeded player until she ran into
fellow Cardinal player Gibbs in the semifinal.
Gibbs was also fortunate to avoid eighth
seeded Tayler Davis of Cal on her way to the
semifinals, as Davis was upset in the round of 16
by McCall Jones. Perhaps the toughest path
through the tournament was Tan's she faced
the sixth, third and first seeds, defeating sixth
seed Andersson 6-3,6-4 and third-seed McKen
na 6-4,5-7,6-1 to reach the semifinals.
"I personally, with my matches, felt like I
came into the tournament pretty prepared," Tan
said. "I didn't feel too much nervousness either.
I just wanted to do well in my matches ... and
do my best for the team."
Sanchez proved to be too tough for Tan on
the day, playing up to the top seed and defeating
Tan 6-2,6-1. This meant that Sanchez was wait
ing in the final for the winner of the all-Cardinal
matchup.
Fourth-seeded Gibbs and seventh-seeded
Ahn faced off in the match that proved how
even they've been all season and how much
they've contributed to the team's success. In
three long sets, Ahn defeated Gibbs 6-2,4-6,6-4
in a match she described as physically and emo
tionally tough.
"It's definitely tough because it's not only
hard that you're teammates, but it's also hard
since our team is so good," Ahn said. "She's an
amazingly gifted player ... I think we brought
out the best in each other."
In the final, Ahn fought through double
faults and forehand trouble to earn the upset
victory over Sanchez, proving her potential for
the next couple years at Stanford. After main
taining a high level of tennis throughout the first
set, Sanchez's level of play fell off and Ahn was
able to capitalize in the 7-5, 6-1 championship
victory.
"I played some of my best tennis all year in
this tournament," Ahn said. "It was definitely
good with each match that I felt much more con
fident. Winning Pac-lOs when you're a freshman
is no easy feat, so I'm really happy that I had the
opportunity to do that."
Ahn and the Cardinal will now gear up for
the NCAA Tournament, which begins on May
14.

na 6-4,5-7,6-1 to reach the semifinals.
"I personally, with my matches, felt like I
came into the tournament pretty prepared," Tan
said. "I didn't feel too much nervousness either.
I just wanted to do well in my matches ... and
do my best for the team."
Sanchez proved to be too tough for Tan on
the day, playing up to the top seed and defeating
Tan 6-2,6-1. This meant that Sanchez was wait
ing in the final for the winner of the all-Cardinal
matchup.
Fourth-seeded Gibbs and seventh-seeded
Ahn faced off in the match that proved how
even they've been all season and how much
they've contributed to the team's success. In
three long sets, Ahn defeated Gibbs 6-2,4-6,6-4
in a match she described as physically and emo
tionally tough.
"It's definitely tough because it's not only
hard that you're teammates, but it's also hard
since our team is so good," Ahn said. "She's an
amazingly gifted player ... I think we brought
out the best in each other."
In the final, Ahn fought through double
faults and forehand trouble to earn the upset
victory over Sanchez, proving her potential for
the next couple years at Stanford. After main
taining a high level of tennis throughout the first
set, Sanchez's level of play fell off and Ahn was
able to capitalize in the 7-5, 6-1 championship
victory.
"I played some of my best tennis all year in
this tournament," Ahn said. "It was definitely
good with each match that I felt much more con
fident. Winning Pac-lOs when you're a freshman
is no easy feat, so I'm really happy that I had the
opportunity to do that."
Ahn and the Cardinal will now gear up for
the NCAA Tournament, which begins on May
14.

PAC-10 WOMEN'S SINGLES
CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL
SANCHEZ (USC) 0
AHN (STANFORD) 2
5/1, Ojai, Calif.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Kristie Ahn, above, took home the
Pac- 10 women's singles championship title this
weekend with an upset win over top-seeded
Maria Sanchez of USC.
With an impressive showing at the Pac-10
Championships, the Stanford women's tennis
team proved to the league how deep its squad
really is. Sophomores Natalie Dillon and Mallo
ry Burdette brought home the women's invita
tional doubles title, and freshman Kristie Ahn
earned the Pac-10 women's championship
crown in singles.

"Ojai is such a great tournament," Dillon
said. "It's been going on for over a hundred
years.There's a lot of tradition that is connected
with the tournament, so I was very honored to
be a part of it."
A participant in the women's invitational
singles, Dillon made it to the quarterfinals and
had a match-point opportunity, but still lost to
Susan Mcßann of Arizona in three sets, 2-6,6-1,
7-5.
Her true success came in doubles, playing
with Burdette. After receiving a first-round bye,
they won their next three matches and took
home the invitational doubles title. The duo de
feated the top three seeds on their way to victo
ry, taking down Courtney Dolehide and Nina
Pantic of UCLA, the second-seeded team, in an
8-6 final match for the crown.
"It was such a pleasure to play with Mall,"
Dillon said. "She's obviously a world-class dou
bles player so I feel like I learned a lot just from
playing with her. It was a lot of fun to beat the
Trojans, beat the Bruins and beat the Bears.
Having a championship under your belt gives
you a certain confidence to do better in future
competitions."
In the main draw for doubles, Stanford en
tered two teams: the freshman duo of Kristie
Ahn and Nicole Gibbs, and the senior-sopho
more pair of Carolyn McVeigh and Stacey Tan.
McVeigh and Tan lost in the second round to
fourth-seeded Micaela Hein and Kelcy McKen
na of Arizona State, 8-5. Ahn and Gibbs made it
one round further, to the semifinals, before los
ing to the top seed Mari Andersson and Jana Ju
ricova of Cal, 8-5.

With three players in the semifinals of the
singles main draw, Stanford had one of its best
showings of the past couple years. On one side
of the draw was a matchup of Stanford's top two
freshmen of the year: Ahn and Gibbs. On the
other side, Tan was taking on the top seed Maria
Sanchez of USC.
"That was a really good showing," Tan said.
"I was so proud of how everyone did, not just
myself, but everyone else too. I think it shows
the rest of the country how strong of a team we
are all around."
Ahn was responsible for the second Stanford
title of the weekend. Playing through the bot
tom half of the bracket, she came in with the sev
enth seed and received an early break when sec

ond-seeded Venise Chan on the same side of
the bracket as Ahn suffered an upset loss in
the first round. This means that Ahn was not
forced to face a seeded player until she ran into
fellow Cardinal player Gibbs in the semifinal.
Gibbs was also fortunate to avoid eighth
seeded Tayler Davis of Cal on her way to the
semifinals, as Davis was upset in the round of 16
by McCall Jones. Perhaps the toughest path
through the tournament was Tan's she faced
the sixth, third and first seeds, defeating sixth
seed Andersson 6-3,6-4 and third-seed McKen
na 6-4,5-7,6-1 to reach the semifinals.
"I personally, with my matches, felt like I
came into the tournament pretty prepared," Tan
said. "I didn't feel too much nervousness either.
I just wanted to do well in my matches ... and
do my best for the team."
Sanchez proved to be too tough for Tan on
the day, playing up to the top seed and defeating
Tan 6-2,6-1. This meant that Sanchez was wait
ing in the final for the winner of the all-Cardinal
matchup.
Fourth-seeded Gibbs and seventh-seeded
Ahn faced off in the match that proved how
even they've been all season and how much
they've contributed to the team's success. In
three long sets, Ahn defeated Gibbs 6-2,4-6,6-4
in a match she described as physically and emo
tionally tough.
"It's definitely tough because it's not only
hard that you're teammates, but it's also hard
since our team is so good," Ahn said. "She's an
amazingly gifted player ... I think we brought
