"Her strengths are my weak

on them," she said. "Having her
there every day in practice really
helps me out."
Although happy with her per
formance, Nelms isn't satisfied and
is still looking to improve,
"It's always nice to run a PR
[personal record], but at the same
time, I have a lot of things to fix," she
said. "There are a lot of things that
have to come together and hopeful
