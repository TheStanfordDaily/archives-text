### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nine players on the sixth
ranked Stanford men's tennis team
traveled to Ojai, Calif., this week
end to participate individually in
the Pac-10 Championships. Four
hot days later, the tournament
came down to a match between the
top two players on the top two
teams No. f Steve Johnson of
USC and No. 9 Bradley Klahn of
Stanford.

The Pac-10 Championships are
an individual tournament, where
the top singles and doubles teams
for each school compete for a
chance at a Pac-10 Championship.

There are two draws the main
championship draw and an invita
tional draw.
Klahn, junior Ryan Thacher,
senior Alex Clayton and sopho
mores Denis Lin and Matt Kan
dath competed in the main draw,
while sophomore Walker Kehrer
and freshmen Jamin Ball, Fawaz
Flourani and Daniel Ho competed
in the invitational draw.

men's singles championship but

Johnson of USC in the final match.
finals of both draws, ultimately
falling in both contests.
Kehrer made his way to the finals
of the invitational draw, defeating
Bozhidar Katsarov of Cal, Matt Stith
of Washington and Zach Gilbert of
Cal to reach the finals against Warren
Hardie of UCLA. Hardie defeated
Kehrer 6-4,6-2 to take the invitation
al title.
The main event, however, was the
heated match between Johnson and
Klahn, the top two seeds in the tour
nament.
Klahn and Johnson know each
other well, and Klahn described what
it was like playing his top-ranked
friend.
"I've played Steve many times

and it's always a tough match," Klahn
said. "He's been one of my best
friends for a while, and it's never easy
playing a friend, but at the same time,
we both want to go out there, and we
want to win. It's a big title, the Pac-10
Championship."
In the end, Johnson pulled out a
tight first-set tiebreaker en route to a
7-6(5), 6-3 victory over Klahn.
Even in losing, Klahn was very
pleased with his play in Ojai this
weekend.
"Overall, I thought the tourna
ment went very well for me. Obvious
ly, today was a tough match, but I
thought I played better with each
match this weekend," Klahn said.
"Making it to another final was a
huge accomplishment for me, but it's
just another stepping stone in the
team's progression toward the
NCAAs and my progression as a
player."
Among a weekend of impressive
victories, Klahn felt he played his best
tennis in his loss to Johnson.
"I came out aggressively, and even
though I ended up losing, I thought it
was my best match of the tourna
ment," he said. "I served well, took the
initiative and forced the play a bit more
than I had. I felt a lot more solid, espe
cially on my backhand, a stroke I have
been focusing on improving lately. I
felt much looser than I had in the pre
vious four matches, but in the end, he
just played the bigger points better."
Klahn noted one particular game
as his only regret of the match.
"I had a chance at 3-3 when I was
leading love-40 with three break

points, but I had five straight return
errors," he said. "[Johnson] hit some
good serves, but it just wasn't real
smart on my part. I let up a bit, trying
to just get my returns in, but other
than that, I was very pleased with how
I progressed over the week. It's disap
pointing to lose, certainly, but looking
at the bigger picture will help me in
the long run."
After a weekend where the focus
was on individuals, the Stanford
squad (18-5, 5-1 Pac-10) returns its
focus to team play. Stanford hosts the
NCAA Tournament in two weeks
and will be looking to finish an im
pressive season with a national title.
Klahn discussed what this week
end meant to the team going for
ward as well as what can still be im
proved upon.
"We had some good wins," he
said. "We obviously always want to
do better, but as far as preparing for
the NCAAs in a few weeks, I
thought guys played pretty good
matches, and it was great to get some
wins down there."
Ultimately, Klahn just wants the
team to enjoy the experience and
make the best of the opportunity.
"This is a great time of year. The
postseason, the springtime, it doesn't
get any better than this. This is what
we've been training all school year
for. This is it. We've been working to
play our best tennis in May, and now
it's just time to show all the hard
work we've done."

Nine players on the sixth
ranked Stanford men's tennis team
traveled to Ojai, Calif., this week
end to participate individually in
the Pac-10 Championships. Four
hot days later, the tournament
came down to a match between the
top two players on the top two
teams No. f Steve Johnson of
USC and No. 9 Bradley Klahn of
Stanford.

The Pac-10 Championships are
an individual tournament, where
the top singles and doubles teams
for each school compete for a
chance at a Pac-10 Championship.

There are two draws the main
championship draw and an invita
tional draw.
Klahn, junior Ryan Thacher,
senior Alex Clayton and sopho
mores Denis Lin and Matt Kan
dath competed in the main draw,
while sophomore Walker Kehrer
and freshmen Jamin Ball, Fawaz
Flourani and Daniel Ho competed
in the invitational draw.

finals of both draws, ultimately
falling in both contests.
Kehrer made his way to the finals
of the invitational draw, defeating
Bozhidar Katsarov of Cal, Matt Stith
of Washington and Zach Gilbert of
Cal to reach the finals against Warren
Hardie of UCLA. Hardie defeated
Kehrer 6-4,6-2 to take the invitation
al title.
The main event, however, was the
heated match between Johnson and
Klahn, the top two seeds in the tour
nament.
Klahn and Johnson know each
other well, and Klahn described what
it was like playing his top-ranked
friend.
"I've played Steve many times

and it's always a tough match," Klahn
said. "He's been one of my best
friends for a while, and it's never easy
playing a friend, but at the same time,
we both want to go out there, and we
want to win. It's a big title, the Pac-10
Championship."
In the end, Johnson pulled out a
tight first-set tiebreaker en route to a
7-6(5), 6-3 victory over Klahn.
Even in losing, Klahn was very
pleased with his play in Ojai this
weekend.
"Overall, I thought the tourna
ment went very well for me. Obvious
ly, today was a tough match, but I
thought I played better with each
match this weekend," Klahn said.
"Making it to another final was a
huge accomplishment for me, but it's
just another stepping stone in the
team's progression toward the
NCAAs and my progression as a
player."
Among a weekend of impressive
victories, Klahn felt he played his best
tennis in his loss to Johnson.
"I came out aggressively, and even
though I ended up losing, I thought it
was my best match of the tourna
ment," he said. "I served well, took the
initiative and forced the play a bit more
than I had. I felt a lot more solid, espe
cially on my backhand, a stroke I have
been focusing on improving lately. I
felt much looser than I had in the pre
vious four matches, but in the end, he
just played the bigger points better."
Klahn noted one particular game
as his only regret of the match.
"I had a chance at 3-3 when I was
leading love-40 with three break

points, but I had five straight return
errors," he said. "[Johnson] hit some
good serves, but it just wasn't real
smart on my part. I let up a bit, trying
to just get my returns in, but other
than that, I was very pleased with how
I progressed over the week. It's disap
pointing to lose, certainly, but looking
at the bigger picture will help me in
the long run."
After a weekend where the focus
was on individuals, the Stanford
squad (18-5, 5-1 Pac-10) returns its
focus to team play. Stanford hosts the
NCAA Tournament in two weeks
and will be looking to finish an im
pressive season with a national title.
Klahn discussed what this week
end meant to the team going for
ward as well as what can still be im
proved upon.
"We had some good wins," he
said. "We obviously always want to
do better, but as far as preparing for
the NCAAs in a few weeks, I
thought guys played pretty good
matches, and it was great to get some
wins down there."
Ultimately, Klahn just wants the
team to enjoy the experience and
make the best of the opportunity.
"This is a great time of year. The
postseason, the springtime, it doesn't
get any better than this. This is what
we've been training all school year
for. This is it. We've been working to
play our best tennis in May, and now
it's just time to show all the hard
work we've done."
