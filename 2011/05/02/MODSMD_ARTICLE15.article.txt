# Casting doubt on the draft
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Bear with me for a minute,
please. I was at Six Hags on
Saturday with a group of
friends, and as is the case
with any trip to an amuse
ment park, there was inevitably a ton of
time spent waiting in lines, and thus, the
conversations went in all sorts of weird
directions.
One of those friends grew up in
Champagne, 111., and consequently
grew up a die-hard fan of University of
Illinois sports. At one point, while we
were between playing the movie game
and ghost, this friend said to me, "Isn't it
unbelievable that Illinois, the Texas
Bowl champions, had three players
drafted before any Stanford players
were drafted, even though Stanford
won the Orange Bowl?" Indeed, Corey
Liuget (18th overall), Mikel Leshoure
(57th) and Martez Wilson (72nd) of Illi
nois all went before Stanford nose tack
le Sione Fua (97th).
What my friend was getting at, it
turns out, was that he believes Illinois
perennially underachieves in football.
That got me thinking: what do NFL
Draft results say about the schools that
the players come from? What does it
say about Stanford, the No. 4 team in
the nation at the end of last season, not
having a player picked until the last pick
of the third round?
Well, I'll start by addressing the ob
vious. Flad Andrew Luck declared for
the NFL Draft, he would have been the
first overall selection no ifs, ands or
buts about it. So when considering this
question, take that into account.
Obviously, there is some correlation
between good college programs and
NFL Draft picks. Auburn won the Na
tional Championship last season and
had Cam Newton and Nick Fairley
picked in the first round, going first and
13th overall, respectively. Back in the
late 1990s and early 2000s when Miami
was a dominant college program, Hur
ricane players absolutely filled up the
draft boards. Same goes for USC play
ers about five years ago. As those pro
grams have fallen off a bit, so have the
number of players heading to the NFL
as high draft picks.
While Auburn and other powers
like Alabama (four first-rounders) and
Wisconsin (two first-rounders) were
schools frequently uttered by Commis
sioner Goodell on draft night, some
other universities that found their ways
into the top rounds were more surpris
ing. In fact, five schools had multiple
first-round picks this year. Nobody is
surprised by the three mentioned
above.The other two, however Bay
lor and Colorado are two perennial
bottom feeders in the Big-12 (and not
Pac-12, in Colorado's case). Sure, Bay
lor had a decent season last year, but it
was no Stanford and there is no
need to rehash Colorado's disastrous
season(s), but let's just say it involved a
$2 million buyout of a coach that was
once seen as un-fireable.
So what does this all mean? My gut
reaction is to say that this feeds into the

old mantra that football is the ultimate
team game. Anyone who has ever
played a down of organized football
has been told that everyone on the field
matters. Ten guys can do a perfect job,
but if one player misses a block, misses
a tackle or drops a pass, the down goes
to hell. One man does not a team make
or something like that.
How about the coaching staffs of
these schools? What does it say about
Jim Harbaugh and his staff that he
could build a national power with little
or no first-round NFL talent? We may
see some of that talent develop down
the line, but it's still a pretty impressive
feat. On the other hand, it doesn't look
so good for Ron Zook of Illinois, Dan
Hawkins (since deposed) of Colorado
and Art Briles of Baylor (who deserves
some slack, as he has taken the Bears'
program out of the dumps).
Yes, college football is a different
game than NFL football.There are sys
tem-grounded players in college that
don't succeed in the NFL. San Francis
co 49ers fans would probably point to
Alex Smith and call him one of those
players. Colt Brennan, the former

Hawaii star and Heisman finalist, is one
of those players.
There are also the players that are
drafted because of their upside, some
of whom weren't major contributors to
their college teams. This was the case
with Jake Locker of Washington
who was a major disappointment this
season but still was drafted eighth over
all and Robert Quinn of North Car
olina, who was suspended last season.
But maybe this all means nothing,
and Stanford was simply a younger
team, and its stars like Luck and of
fensive tackle Jonathan Martin will
be drafted high down the line. Perhaps
Stanford's talent was better dispersed
than other teams. The Cardinal had
three players selected in rounds 4-7 of
the draft, Illinois had one and Baylor
and Colorado each had two.
I'm doing something I don't like to
do leaving this column without a de
finitive answer but that's only be
cause I don't think there is one. Of
course, it's probably a combination of
all of this that explains the correlation
between the NFL Draft and college
performance.

Daniel Bohm isn't sure what explains
the correlation between the length of
his beard and the amount of personal
space he has at parties. Draw up some
charts at bohmd@stanford.edu.
