### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The Center for Democracy, Develop
ment and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) host
ed a conference on the democratic transi
tion in Egypt on Friday as part of its Pro
gram on Arab Reform and Democracy.
Twelve Egypt scholars from American,
Egyptian and European universities and
think tanks convened in four panels
throughout the day to discuss the revolu
tion, the transition process, the changing po
litical landscape and Egypt's future. The
conference was co-sponsored by the Abbasi
Program in Islamic Studies.
Panelists included Hoover Institution
senior fellow Larry Diamond, history pro
fessor Joel Beinin, political science assistant
professor Lisa Blaydes, CDDRL visiting
scholar Ben Rowswell and CDDRL Pro
gram Manager Lina Khatib. They were
joined by academics from Kent State Uni
versity, Harvard University, Georgetown
University, the University of Texas, Notre
Dame University, the University of Exeter,
the American University in Cairo and the
Brookings Doha Center.
Each panel featured an introduction by
the chair, followed by two or three 30-
minute talks by panelists and a 30-minute
Q&A session.
Emad Shahin, an associate professor of
religion, conflict and peacebuilding at Notre
Dame, opened the first panel with a talk
that emphasized the role of the youth in
charging the 18 days of protest that toppled
former President Hosni Mubarak.
"In 18 days, this movement dismantled
three pillars of Mubarak's regime the se
curity apparatus, NDP [National Democra
tic Party] and ... the military," he said.
Samer Shehata, an assistant professor of
Arab politics at Georgetown University,
discussed the response of the regime to the
protests and the reasons for its failure.
The second panel looked to the future,
focusing on the Egyptian presidential elec
tions scheduled for later this year. Speeches
addressed the process of negotiations be
tween the regime and opposition groups,
the agenda for constitutional and institu-
tional reform and political repres
sion.
Panelist Jason Brownlee, an as
sociate professor in the Department
of Government at University of
Texas at Austin, drew a parallel be
tween the current situation in Egypt
and the one in Russia in 1991. He
described the liberal movement as
"electorally weak" and said it expe
rienced difficulty in maintaining
momentum.
The third panel addressed politi
cal parties in the post-revolution
landscape, including the Islamist
Muslim Brotherhood party. Panelist
Hesham Sallam, a doctoral candi
date at Georgetown University,
spoke on how the timeline for the
parliamentary elections, currently
set for this September, disadvan
tages newly formed parties and fa
vors parties such as the Muslim
Brotherhood.
"The speed of transition in
Egypt gives advantage to existing
political parties by not allowing
time for newcomers to organize," he
said.
"The Brotherhood knows how
to play politics where liberals have
absolutely no idea," added Shadi
Hamid, the director of research at
the Brookings Doha Center.
Diamond described parallels
with the situation in Iraq in 2004
and 2005.
"The liberals weren't good at or
ganizing, had no mass constituency
and got electorally crushed ... but
they had a constructive influence on
the constitution making process,"
he said.
"We should look at this as an it
erative process of several elections

to come," he added.
The final panel focused on look
ing forward. Rowswell presented a
new "Open Source Democracy Pro
motion" project, designed to pro
vide Egyptian activists with an op
tion for crowd sourcing constitu
tional negotiations.
"The best approach is for in
formed and engaged citizens to sup
port the Egyptian activists ... in
spired by the opportunity Egyptians
have given themselves but also in
spired by what Egyptians have
given the world regarding demo
cratic state building and ushering in
a new age of democracy based on
mutual collaboration and participa
tion," Rowswell said.
Hamid delivered the final talk of
the conference, presenting his fore
cast for the parliamentary elections.
He singled out newly formed par
ties backed by wealthy individuals
as key players in the upcoming vote.
"The established political parties
will do quite well, but also individu
als with name recognition in their
districts and those with resources
will do well," he said.
Hamid cautioned against overly
idealistic projections, given the dis
organization of the liberal parties in
Egypt.
"We have to be realistic," he said.
"We wanted to think for a long time
that once there was democracy,
Egyptians would become fluffy
American-style liberals, and we
don't know if that is true."
"From the perspective of inter
national actors doing democracy
promotion, I think there's a distinc
tion between encouraging Egyp
tians to make one choice over an
other," Rowswell said. "I think it
should be ensuring that there is a
choice to make."
