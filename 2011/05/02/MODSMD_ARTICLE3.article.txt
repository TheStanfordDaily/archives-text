# BIN LADEN IS DEAD
## Students, faculty react to demise of al Qaeda leader 
### AN LE NGUYEN KABIR SAWHNEY EDITORS 
At an 11:35 p.m. EST press
conference on Sunday night,
President Barack Obama con
firmed the death of al Qaeda
leader Osama bin Laden. The
president's announcement came
nearly 10 years after the Sept. 11,
2001 attacks on the Twin Towers
and the Pentagon.
"I can report to the American
people and to the world that the
United States has conducted an
operation that killed Osama bin
Laden," Obama said.
This development is the latest
in a decade-long endeavor to
track the perpetrators of 9/11 and
stymie terrorist attacks against
the United States and its allies.
Soon after assuming the presi
dency, Obama tasked CIA direc
tor Leon Panetta with capturing
or killing bin Laden. A promising
break came last August, when the
intelligence community received
information indicating that the al
Qaeda leader had taken cover
"within a compound deep inside
of Pakistan," Obama said.
"Finally, last week, I deter
mined that we had enough intelli
gence to take action and author

ized an operation to get Osama
bin Laden and bring him to jus
tice " he said.
"At my direction, the United
States launched a targeted opera
tion against that compound in
Abbottabad, Pakistan," Obama
said. "A small team of Americans
carried out the operation with ex
traordinary courage and capabili
ty. No Americans were harmed.
They took care to avoid civilian
casualties. After a firefight, they
killed Osama bin Laden and took
custody of his body."
The news of bin Laden's death
prompted widespread reactions
across the country, with crowds of
people congregating in Times
Square in New York City and in
front of the White House in Wash
ington, D.C.
Among members of the Stan
ford community, the news also
carried great significance.
"The demise of Osama bin
Laden is a tremendous victory for
the American people," professor
of political science Condoleezza
Rice said in a statement. Rice
served as secretary of state under
former President George W. Bush
and is a former provost of the
University.
"We are all indebted to the
American military and intelli

gence community for their skill
and dedication," she said.
Political science professor
Scott Sagan said bin Laden's de
mise signaled a major break
through in the effort to dismantle
the al Qaeda network, but urged
for caution.
"I think this is a major step in
reducing al Qaeda's effective
ness," Sagan said. "This is a great
victory for the United States and
for all countries that have been in
conflict with al Qaeda."
The fear now, however, is that
bin Laden's death could precipi

tate retaliatory acts by the al
Qaeda network.
"I think at the same time that
vigilance is something we will
have to have in the short run to be
sure that remaining units of al
Qaeda around the world do not
lash out at us in desperation,"
Sagan said.
Students across campus exhib
ited spontaneous displays of pa
triotism. Chants of "U-S-A! U-S-
A!" were heard in the areas near
