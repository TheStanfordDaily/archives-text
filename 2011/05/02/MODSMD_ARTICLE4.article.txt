Max Mathews, professor emeri
tus of music at the Center for Com
puter Research in Music and
Acoustics (CCRMA), died in San
Francisco on April 21. He was 84
years old.
Mathews was a key figure in
founding the field of computer
music. In 1957, he wrote a program
called "Music" that enabled an IBM
704 mainframe computer to play a
17-second composition. He fur
thered his research at Bell Labs in
New Jersey, where he developed
more sophisticated programs based
on his original "Music" program.
He also developed the "Radio
Baton and Conductor Program,"
which was an early precursor to the
handheld controllers in widespread
use with game consoles today.
After retiring from Bell Labs in
1987, Mathews became a professor
at CCRMA, helping to turn the cen
ter into one of the foremost research
hubs for computer music. While at
Stanford, he developed a number of
new instruments, including an ad
vanced electric violin.
A memorial service for Mathews
will be held on May 29 at CCRMA.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra
