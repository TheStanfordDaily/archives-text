## SIEPR explores economics of sports 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) hosted an all-day
forum on Friday entitled "Sports
Economics and Policy," featuring

several big-name speakers from
the world of athletics.
The forum included talks
from professional sports agents,
professors and athletes as well as
a panel discussion with four
championship-winning Stanford
athletes. Lecture topics ranged

from data analytics to the busi
ness side of sports.
Jon Wertheim, a longtime
Sports Illustrated journalist and
author of the popular sports
book "Scorecasting," gave the

keynote address. Wertheim spoke
about the psychological biases
that operate in sports and can in
fluence the outcome of contests in
ways that run contrary to conven
tional wisdom.
Another prominent speaker
during the morning session was
John Huizinga, a professor at the
University of Chicago's Booth
School of Business and the agent
for NBA superstar Yao Ming. In
his talk, Huizinga discussed his re
search into the "hot hand," the
idea that a basketball player can
get on a streak during the course
of the game and become much
more likely to make baskets.
Though the existence of the
"hot hand" is a widely accepted
phenomenon in sports, Huizinga's
research suggested that it does not
exist in reality. According to the
data, an NBA player is significant
ly less likely to make a shot if he
has made his previous shot, the
opposite of what we would expect
if a "hot hand" effect were operat
ing.
Huizinga also discussed his ex
periences representing Yao Ming
over a period of several years and
the unique insights that being an
economist and a business school
professor provided him in that job.
The afternoon session kicked
off with a discussion panel of four
current and former Stanford ath
letes: basketball player Mark
Madsen 'OO, tennis player Lindsay
Burdette 'lO, basketball player
Nneka Ogwumike 'l2 and gym
nast Nick Noone 'lO.
Madsen played on the Stanford
men's basketball team in the late
19905, including the 1998 Final
Four team, before going on to a
nine-year career in the NBA with
the Los Angeles Lakers and the
Minnesota Timberwolves. His ca
reer boasted two titles with the
Lakers. Madsen spoke about how

important a supportive, cohesive
group dynamic is for any success
ful team.
"I can remember a time playing
for the Lakers when, coming back
from an injury when my rhythm
was really off, I airballed two
straight free throws in Staples
Center," Madsen said. "It was very
humiliating for me, and I felt awful
about it, but after the game, Shaq
came up to me and joked about it
and was very supportive about it
and made sure I didn't let it get me
down. And that was something
that made a big difference for me."
Ogwumike, a current member
of the Stanford women's basket
ball team, responded without hes
itation when asked what the defin
ing moment of her athletic career
at Stanford had been.
"Dec. 30, 2010, the day we
broke UConn's win streak," Og
wumike said. "I could sense in my
teammates how much we all want
ed it. I've never heard Maples that
loud in my life. That was, without
doubt, the greatest moment of my
basketball life."
Bob Bowlsby, the director of
Stanford's Department of Athlet
ics, also spoke about the economic
landscape of college sports and
some of the key issues he has dealt
with in his five years on the Farm.
"People talk about there being
a West Coast bias in college sports
coverage, but I think this is some
thing that we will see changing in
the coming years," Bowlsby said.
"The fact is, the Pac-10 has won
twice as many national champi
onships as any other conference.
With us expanding to 12 teams and
looking at a new television cable
deal, I think really exciting things
are in store."
Other featured speakers in
cluded Stanford professors Roger
Noll and George Foster, San
Diego Padres executive John Ab
bamondi and current Stanford un
dergraduate and Daily staffer
Nikhil Joshi 'll.
