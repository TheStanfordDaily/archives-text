## ProFros descend upon Farm 1,190 admitted students attend Admit Weekend 
### SARAH FLAMM 
The 1,190 prospective freshmen
(ProFros) that attended Stanford's
Admit Weekend this past weekend
have until 5 p.m. today to decide
whether they will join Stanford's
Class of 2015.
Admit Weekend was held later in
April than in years past. ProFros
had nine days from the start of
Admit Weekend to commit in 2010
and eight days in 2009. This year,
they have four days.
"Because of religious holidays,
we had fewer weekends in April to
choose from," Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Richard Shaw wrote
in an email to The Daily.
According to Shaw, roughly half
of the ProFros had already commit
ted to Stanford when they arrived
for Admit Weekend. However, this
number only includes those who
have officially accepted their offer
and put down their deposit, leaving
out those who come to the Farm
with their minds unofficially made
up.
Among the undecided admits is
Catherine Tadina, a Pro Fro from
Daly City, Calif., who is deliberating
mainly between MIT and Stanford.
"I feel like Admit Weekend is
too close to the decision deadline,"
Tadina said. "Now that I have some
idea of what life is like here, I wish I
had more time to talk to people and
ask them about their experiences at
Stanford."
Adam Goldberg, who came to
Admit Weekend from Danville,
Calif., disagreed.
"Having more time wouldn't
help," he said. "It's the same choice
I have to make by Monday as I
would have to make later."
Connor Kelley, a Pro Fro from
Duvall, Wash., committed in De
cember after getting an offer
through the restrictive early action

process, but still decided to come to
Admit Weekend.
"Admit Weekend was really
more of positive reinforcement for
me," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "I can tell that I made the
right choice."
According to Admit Weekend
coordinator Stewart Macgregor-
Dennis 'l3, a sizeable number of ad
mits visited outside of the regular
Admit Weekend. A total of 1,279
room hosts (RoHos) signed up by
the start of Admit Weekend, well
over the number that was needed to
host every Pro Fro. Prior to the
weekend, there were some concerns
that not enough students had signed
up to host admitted students.
For the 2011-12 academic year,
the University offered admission to
2,427 students and expects 1,725 of
these students to matriculate in the
fall.
"We do believe they will have
the information they need to make
a decision that is right for them,"
Shaw said.
