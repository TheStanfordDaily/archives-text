## VIRTUALLY ADMITTED International ProFros get a taste of Stanford through Virtual Admit Weekend 
### ByJANEYOON 
Back in her room after a
long day of classes, a
Stanford student turns on
her laptop and double
clicks on a Skype user
name that connects her from Stan
ford all the way to Malaysia. A few
seconds later, the unfamiliar but
eager face of a prospective fresh
man (Pro Fro) pops up on her com
puter screen. And just like that, Vir
tual Admit Weekend (VAW) begins
from over 8,000 miles away.
After hearing that current inter
national students wished they had
been able to come to Stanford for
Admit Weekend but could not be
cause of the distance, the Cross-
Cultural Rhetoric Project (CCR)
teamed up with Daniel Brennan, as
sistant director of admission for
marketing and communication, to
start VAW in 2010.
During VAW, international
ProFros have the opportunity to
schedule a one-on-one Skype ses
sion with a current Stanford under
graduate to ask questions, find out
more about Stanford and get a
glimpse of student life.
Shortly after international stu
dents receive their acceptance let
ters to Stanford, they receive an
email from the Office of Admission
that invites them to participate in
VAW. They can browse through the
hosts' profiles online and schedule a
Skype session based on academic
and extracurricular interests, ac
cording to Christine Alfano, VAW
organizer and CCR co-director.
Last year, 18 ProFros from ap
proximately 14 countries participat
ed in the three days of VAW. This
year's event, which was held from
April 16 to April 20, included video
conferences with 30 international
ProFros, or over 10 percent of the

international students admitted to
the Class of 2015.
Fifteen undergraduates, all for
mer CCR students, Program in
Writing and Rhetoric Undergradu
ate Advisory Board (PWR UAB)
members or former VAW ProFros,
volunteered to be hosts. After a
training session about intercultural
communication, best practices for
video conferencing and frequently
asked questions, the hosts conduct
ed 30-minute Skype sessions from
their dorm rooms.
"What's fun about having that
informal setting is that it mirrors the
Admit Weekend experience in that
it brings the ProFros, at least virtual
ly, into the dorm where they can get
a 'tour' of a typical dorm room,
meet their host's roommate and
even occasionally get to peek at
some of the activities that go on
within the residences," Alfano
wrote in an email to The Daily.
Current international students
who participated in VAW in the past
found it helpful to get a personal re
sponse to questions that were not
answered on Stanford's website.
"Being able to actually talk to a
student who cared about you and
genuinely loves Stanford was great,
since you actually got to hear first
hand what they had to say about the
school," said Makiko Fujimoto 'l4,
who participated in VAW last year.
"Obviously it cannot replicate
some of the important parts of
Admit Weekend activities, actu
ally staying in the dorm, etc. But it
was great to have the other re
source," she added.
Gavin Bird 'l4, a VAW host, said
his experience coming to Stanford
from Japan made him eager to help
fellow international students gain
some familiarity with the Farm be
fore taking their first trip down
Palm Drive.
"As an international student, I

had never visited any American
universities and did not really know
what to expect when I got here,"
Bird said. "The cold winters and the
size of the campus were a bit of a
shock."
Virtual Admit Weekend not only
helps international ProFros with
questions about Stanford, but also
shows how much Stanford students
take genuine interest in helping po
tential students make the best deci
sion about choosing the right col
lege.
"I hope to show the ProFros how
wonderful Stanford is, answer any
specific questions about the school
and make them feel happy and se
cure in their decision to attend
Stanford," said Stephanie Nichol
son 'l3, who has served as a VAW
host for two years.
"This way, ProFros have away to
discuss any concerns they have be
fore making a life-changing deci
sion," she added.
For now, VAW is only open to in
ternational prospective freshmen in
order to keep the focus on the inter
national community. Next year, at
the request of undergraduate hosts,
it may pursue a more individualized
approach by connecting prospec
tive freshmen with student hosts
from the same home countries.
While the nature and scope of
the 30-minute Skype sessions of
VAW is vastly different from what
ProFros who attend Admit Week
end experience, the result seems
similar.
"The best thing was being able to
talk to someone firsthand about
their experiences at Stanford and
getting a sense of what the school
life will be like," Fujimoto said. "It
just made me more excited about
attending Stanford."
