## EDITORIAL Seniors: Pay It Forwara 
### 
As week six begins, the reali
ty and excitement of the
end of the year and the
start of the summer are upon us.
For graduating seniors, however,
this excitement is tempered by the
surreal recognition that the Stan
ford experience itself is also com
ing to an end. Amid the commotion
of midterms and papers, many sen
iors were blissfully able to put off
thoughts of the future, to carpe
diem as if these idyllic days would
never end. As they savor these last
precious weeks, however, seniors
should also reflect upon the failure
of past graduating classes to rally
around the cause of giving back to
future classes. Class of 2011: it's
time to change that.
Seniors have received a slew of
emails asking for donations to the
Senior Gift, and about half the class
(in true Stanford fashion) has pro
crastinated on the task. Many have
brushed aside the campaign, ques
tioning its wisdom. However, we
still urge seniors to donate, as we
find the following objections un
convincing.
Isn't our endowment enormous?
Senior Gift money does not go
to the endowment; it goes toward
funding the Undergraduate experi
ence in fact, more than 75 per
cent of the Senior Gift will be given
out next year as financial aid so that
Stanford can continue to attract the
best and brightest. Almost 80 per
cent of the current senior class re
ceived financial aid, meaning 80
percent of the class was a direct
beneficiary of Senior Gifts of the
past. The Senior Gift is an opportu
nity to say thank you and to pay
that forward to next year's Stan
ford students.

Haven't I already given more than
enough tuition dollars to Stanford?
Contrary to popular belief,

Stanford cannot sustain itself on tu
ition and endowment alone. Actu
ally, full tuition covers only two
thirds of the cost of a Stanford edu
cation. As a consequence, the Uni
versity depends on annual dona
tions to support core programs on
campus. Without these donations,
Stanford would not be able to pro
vide many of the programs that stu
dents value.
Even if I donate, won't it be just a
drop in the bucket?
Senior Gift funds go a long way
although seniors are encour
aged to give only $20.11 (the cost of
a few Fraiche yogurts or Coupa
lattes), each donation is matched
almost three to one, tripling the im
pact. Furthermore, giving to the Se
nior Gift signals to major donors
how much Stanford students value
their experience, making million
dollar gifts to the University much
more likely. Giving back (regard
less of how much you give) also
connects you to a community of
Stanford alumni who want to see
the University thrive. And as a
member of the Class of 2011 the
class that's on the brink of not only
reaching but breaking the record
for participation in Senior Gift, do
nating also makes you a part of
something truly groundbreaking at
Stanford.
In addition to benefiting future
students, there are also less selfless
reasons to donate. Your gift, no
matter what size, is tax deductible;
you are about to start earning
money and paying taxes, and it
would be a shame to miss out on
your first real opportunity to write
off a donation and to incorporate
philanthropy into your yearly regi
men. While you're at it,you can also
take advantage of the Senior Gift
Committee's rewards, like a Stan-

In addition, U.S. News rankings
factor Senior Gift participation
into their rankings, so by giving you
elevate Stanford's cachet. Sadly,
past Stanford classes have under
performed; while 80 to 90 percent
of seniors at Harvard, Yale and
Princeton donate to their Senior
Gifts every year, we have never
reached those numbers. Even if
beating the Ivies doesn't make you
want to give, consider that you have
already invested tens, if not hun
dreds of thousands, of dollars in
your Stanford education; 20 more
dollars is a worthwhile investment
in the Stanford brand, and thus
your brand as a Stanford alum.
If you're a senior and spend any
amount of time on Facebook, then

you've probably seen the 2011 Se
nior Gift video. The two-minute
"day in the life" documentary cap
tures a kaleidoscopic view of Stan
ford life, from biking down Palm
Drive and competing in athletics to
the Stanford routine of labs, prob
lem sets and library dashes. With
over 5,000 views and commentary
from current, past and prospective
students, it compresses an entire
Stanford experience into a single
day, reminding us of the countless
beautiful moments we have spent
on the Farm and the doors those
experiences have opened. With
your help, future students can
enjoy those experiences as well,
and walk through doors that you
unlock.
To give, or not to give? Either
way, it is impossible to deny that
our Stanford experience has been
incredible. We urge you to show
your appreciation and seize the op
portunity to make the Class of
2011 the first one that stands
and gives together.

although seniors are encour
aged to give only $20.11 (the cost of
a few Fraiche yogurts or Coupa
lattes), each donation is matched
almost three to one, tripling the im
pact. Furthermore, giving to the Se
nior Gift signals to major donors
how much Stanford students value
their experience, making million
dollar gifts to the University much
more likely. Giving back (regard
less of how much you give) also
connects you to a community of
Stanford alumni who want to see
the University thrive. And as a
member of the Class of 2011 the
class that's on the brink of not only
reaching but breaking the record
for participation in Senior Gift, do
nating also makes you a part of
something truly groundbreaking at
Stanford.
In addition to benefiting future
students, there are also less selfless
reasons to donate. Your gift, no
matter what size, is tax deductible;
you are about to start earning
money and paying taxes, and it
would be a shame to miss out on
your first real opportunity to write
off a donation and to incorporate
philanthropy into your yearly regi
men. While you're at it,you can also
take advantage of the Senior Gift
Committee's rewards, like a Stan-

In addition, U.S. News rankings
factor Senior Gift participation
into their rankings, so by giving you
elevate Stanford's cachet. Sadly,
past Stanford classes have under
performed; while 80 to 90 percent
of seniors at Harvard, Yale and
Princeton donate to their Senior
Gifts every year, we have never
reached those numbers. Even if
beating the Ivies doesn't make you
want to give, consider that you have
already invested tens, if not hun
dreds of thousands, of dollars in
your Stanford education; 20 more
dollars is a worthwhile investment
in the Stanford brand, and thus
your brand as a Stanford alum.
If you're a senior and spend any
amount of time on Facebook, then

you've probably seen the 2011 Se
nior Gift video. The two-minute
"day in the life" documentary cap
tures a kaleidoscopic view of Stan
ford life, from biking down Palm
Drive and competing in athletics to
the Stanford routine of labs, prob
lem sets and library dashes. With
over 5,000 views and commentary
from current, past and prospective
students, it compresses an entire
Stanford experience into a single
day, reminding us of the countless
beautiful moments we have spent
on the Farm and the doors those
experiences have opened. With
your help, future students can
enjoy those experiences as well,
and walk through doors that you
unlock.
To give, or not to give? Either
way, it is impossible to deny that
our Stanford experience has been
incredible. We urge you to show
your appreciation and seize the op
portunity to make the Class of
2011 the first one that stands
and gives together.
As week six begins, the reali
ty and excitement of the
end of the year and the
start of the summer are upon us.
For graduating seniors, however,
this excitement is tempered by the
surreal recognition that the Stan
ford experience itself is also com
ing to an end. Amid the commotion
of midterms and papers, many sen
iors were blissfully able to put off
thoughts of the future, to carpe
diem as if these idyllic days would
never end. As they savor these last
precious weeks, however, seniors
should also reflect upon the failure
of past graduating classes to rally
around the cause of giving back to
future classes. Class of 2011: it's
time to change that.
Seniors have received a slew of
emails asking for donations to the
Senior Gift, and about half the class
(in true Stanford fashion) has pro
crastinated on the task. Many have
brushed aside the campaign, ques
tioning its wisdom. However, we
still urge seniors to donate, as we
find the following objections un
convincing.
Isn't our endowment enormous?
Senior Gift money does not go
to the endowment; it goes toward
funding the Undergraduate experi
ence in fact, more than 75 per
cent of the Senior Gift will be given
out next year as financial aid so that
Stanford can continue to attract the
best and brightest. Almost 80 per
cent of the current senior class re
ceived financial aid, meaning 80
percent of the class was a direct
beneficiary of Senior Gifts of the
past. The Senior Gift is an opportu
nity to say thank you and to pay
that forward to next year's Stan
ford students.

Haven't I already given more than
enough tuition dollars to Stanford?
Contrary to popular belief,

Stanford cannot sustain itself on tu
ition and endowment alone. Actu
ally, full tuition covers only two
thirds of the cost of a Stanford edu
cation. As a consequence, the Uni
versity depends on annual dona
tions to support core programs on
campus. Without these donations,
Stanford would not be able to pro
vide many of the programs that stu
dents value.
Even if I donate, won't it be just a
drop in the bucket?
