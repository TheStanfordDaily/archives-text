How I Write: A Conversation with Abraham Verghese
In his first book, My Own Country, acclaimed physician and writer,
Abraham Verghese wrote about AIDS in rural Tennessee. It became a
finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for 1994 and it was
later made into a movie. His next book, The Tennis Partner, was a New
York Times notable book and a national bestseller. His latest book,
Cutting for Stone , spent months on The New York Times Book Review
bestseller list. He has published extensively in the medical literature, and
his writing has appeared in The New Yorker, Esquire, The New York
Times Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and elsewhere.
Hilton Obenzinger, a fiction and nonfiction writer and lecturer in the
Department of English and in Continuing Studies, will engage Abraham
Verghese in conversation, focusing on the techniques, quirks, and joys of
writing history and biography.
