## CAFFEINE KICK Students turn to energy drinks to increase productivity, may fall victim to unpleasant side effects 
### MOLLY VORWERCK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's no secret energy is a valuable
commodity for multitasking college stu
dents these days. There is always a
paper to write, a problem set to finish, a
party to attend and simply not enough
hours in the day to accommodate everything.
It isn't hard to find that kid in the computer
cluster nursing a Red Bull as though it were
the serum of youth or the fatigued classmate
chugging a 5-Hour Energy before a 9 a.m.
midterm.
Despite the short-term boost energy
drinks can offer, Colin Campbell 'l2, a Peer
Health Educator (PHE) in Toyon Hall, de
scribed how large amounts of caffeine can
take a toll on an individual's health.
"You're using [energy drinks] as a stimu
lant to ward off drowsiness and increase alert
ness for a short amount of time," he said. "But
if you use them on a regular basis, then you'll
develop a caffeine tolerance. It will no longer
have that effect on you, and you might devel
op heart palpitations or hyperreflexia [over
active reflexes]."
Students often consume energy drinks
when work needs to be completed in crunch
time.
"I know it's not healthy, but you overlook
that when you have a deadline," said Cecilia
Jojola 'll. "You compromise a healthy
lifestyle for efficiency."
Although Jojola only chooses to consume
coffee every couple of weeks, she rarely in
dulges in energy drinks.
"I stay away from the energy drinks just
because they are unhealthily loaded with
sugar and who knows what kinds of chemi

cals," she said.
Ralph Castro, associate direc
tor for health promotion services
at Vaden Health Center, cites sleep
deprivation as the number one rea
son why students turn to energy
drinks. Although Vaden does not
maintain specific statistics on stu
dents' consumption, he de
scribed energy drinks as popu
lar at Stanford, as evidenced by
the empty cans he sees littered
about the campus from time to
time.
Castro said that the larger
issue at hand regarding these
drinks, however, is mixing them
with alcohol, such as mixing Red Bull
with vodka.
"You're mixing a stimulant with a depres
sant," he said. "The stimulant masks the ef
fects of the depressant, and so it makes people
reach a stimulant high. But the stimulant
wears off quicker than the depressant does in
the alcohol."
"When people are consuming multiple
drinks, at one point, it all comes crashing
down on them like a ton of bricks they get
really drunk really quickly," he added.
Another serious concern for Castro is the
use of stimulant medications to achieve simi
lar or more extreme side effects of energy
drinks or caffeinated beverages.
"There's been an increase in students who
use stimulant medications such as Adderall
and Ritalin for non-medical purposes," he
said.
According to Castro, about seven to 10
percent of college students have used those
drugs in the course of their lifetimes.

"When we look at our aver
ages here [at Stanford], it is defi
nitely lower than the national aver
age," Castro said. "However, we are at risk
given the high academic rigor of our culture.
But we don't have the data to really say
whether we are higher than other schools in
terms of energy drink and caffeine consump
tion in general."
Vivian Crisman, a dietician at Vaden
Health Center's Health Promotion Services,
suggested that students should limit their caf
feine consumption to about 300 milligrams
per day.
"An eight-ounce cup of coffee has about 100
milligrams," she said. "For the average college

student who
has a little bit
of coffee, some
tea, some soda later
on in the day, they are
probably in the range of about
300 milligrams. But obviously, some
drinks contain a lot more caffeine
than that."
And how should students com
bat this caffeine craving? Crisman
argued that it all boils down to sleep
and proper nutrition, starting with a
balanced breakfast, a mid-afternoon
snack and proper hydration. Castro main
tained that regular exercise whether that
means hiking the Dish or even something as
simple as running around Wilbur Field with
your friends will help keep you awake
throughout the day.
Crisman and Castro's comments fall in line
with Campbell's matter-of-fact solution to
curbing the consumption of caffeinated drinks.
"The overall goal would be to prevent
cramming and all-nighters from ever happen
ing in the first place," Campbell said.
