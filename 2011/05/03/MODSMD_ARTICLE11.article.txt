## I HAVE TWO HEADS Drawing The Line 
### Rachel Kolb 
Despite my slight panic at
being a senior next year, en
tering the Draw this spring
made me bask in a newfound sense
of complacency over having found
my rhythm at Stanford. I was final
ly drawing tier one; I finally knew
the lay of the land on campus, and
my days of confused shuffling in
and out of freshman draw groups
seemed but a distant memory. But
in truth, every year at Stanford
brings its own new situation that
presses us to keep meeting new
people and new challenges regard
less of how settled we feel.
When I entered the Draw, I al
ready knew where on campus I
wanted to live, or at least I had
moved in and out of enough places
to have faith that, whatever hous
ing arrangement I got, I could han
dle. Check. But when I mentally
scrolled through all the people
whom I might want to draw with,
one by one, the objections popped
up. Graduating. Staffing. Pre-as
signing. Going abroad. Already
drawing with someone else. Or oth
erwise, simply incompatible.
Maybe I'm just particular about
roommates. But the more logistical
obstacles aside, I realized that I am
now able to draw a helpful distinc
tion between friends and cohabi
tants. Living with someone on a
day-in, day-out basis can be differ
ent from being best friends with
that person and, while I love my
friends dearly, I would never want
to live with some of them. It's not
that we wouldn't get along. It's that,
in a roommate or drawmate, I've
come to value something different,
something that is friendship but in a
slightly looser sense, that is pleas
ant and supportive but lacks the
emotional interdependence of our
closest relationships.
For many of us, college is the
first time in our lives where we
have the opportunity to live with
our friends and arrange our living
situations however we wish. Be
cause of this exploration of new
found territory, college is also a
time that allows us to learn which
qualities we are able to tolerate in
other people and which ones make
us tick. I know that I came to Stan
ford with different expectations of
compatibility than I have now. I
did not make a distinction be
tween cohabitation and deep emo
tional ties, so I half-expected that

my college roommates and I
would not just get along but would
in fact be inseparable.
Now, however, I know better.
That is to say, I have recognized
the detriments of too much time
spent together and have realized
the value that personal space can
add to a friendship. It seems that
my ideal roommate is someone
with whom I can amicably share
the space, while still feeling the
room is independent. This, quite
possibly, could be a personal pref
erence. It isn't what everyone
looks for. I know some people at
Stanford for whom their room
mate is literally their best friend.
For them, the room becomes the
common space associated with all
of their shared experiences, con
versations and inside jokes that
encompass an entire year. I admire
these sorts of relationships, but
they're hard to come by.
Coexistence, on the other hand,
strikes me as something that we're
continually challenged to practice
at Stanford. As undergraduates, we
have the unique situation of living
on campus for all four years, com
ing into contact with a variety of
personalities. Regardless of who we
draw with, we will end up meeting

College is a time that
allows us to learn which
qualities we are able to
tolerate in other people
and which ones make
us tick.
