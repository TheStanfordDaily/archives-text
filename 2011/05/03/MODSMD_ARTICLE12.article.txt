# FRESHLY BAKED
## Jadedness 
### Tim Moon 
Until this year, Admit Week
ends always unsettled me.
Don't get me wrong, I always
wanted the ProFros (Prospective
Frosh) to like their Admit Weekend
as much as I had so that they would
choose the best school in the coun
try, but there was something that al
ways got to me, just a little.
It wasn't the dangerous obstacle
course that biking through campus
became or the super long lines in the
dining halls; those were just minor in
conveniences. What got to me was
how "Gee, golly!" the ProFros were
about Stanford. I'd come in just as
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as a
freshman, but over time, I found my
self developing that slightly jaded at
titude you get about a place that
you've come to know too well, a jad
edness that was always magnified
during Admit Weekend.
I'm sure that this feeling isn't en
tirely unfamiliar. After those initial
few months of freshman year
when you hang out with anyone and
everyone, when you run around be
tween 16 different clubs because
everything at the Activity Fair sound
ed so interesting, when you bike all
the way to Ricker because you've

heard stories about how good the
food is you settle down into a
comfortable routine. You start hang
ing out mostly within your friend
group, you pare down those 16 clubs
into two or three, you keep eating at
your dining hall despite how tired
you are of the food there because it's
right there. That's when you might
start getting a little jaded, when
everything that was once new and
shiny becomes normal and boring,
when you stop seeing all of the stuff
you haven't done and complain
about the things you keep doing over
and over.
So given that I'm an old, seen-it
all senior, I should have been espe
cially jaded for Admit Weekend,
right? But this past weekend, when
ever I saw a Pro Fro, so happy to be

here, I found myself feeling pangs of
envy instead, nostalgic of my own
Admit Weekend.
Their energy and enthusiasm
made me feel a little bad about the
relative lack of energy and enthusi
asm I've had at times over the past
four years, as if I'd not taken full ad
vantage of my time here. At the same
time, comparing the attitude of a
Pro Fro who's seeing Stanford for the
first time to that of a student who
could walk around campus blindfold
ed isn't really fair, because regardless
of where you are and how awesome
that place is, there's going to be some
disillusionment over time.
But that doesn't mean we have to
add to our disillusionment by stick
ing to the same routine, day after day.
Last week, I decided to try eating
nothing but Nutraloaf â€”a bland,
nutritionally complete meal loaf
served in prisons as a disciplinary
measure for four days. The first

two days were okay, but by the third
and fourth days, it was getting ex
tremely difficult to keep eating the
Nutraloaf it wasn't so much that it
tasted bad\ the difficulty was more
that there was no variety, both within
the loaf itself (Nutraloaf has a mushy,
homogenous texture and flavor) and
between meals. I had to stop after
four days, because I just didn't think
I could keep forcing down bites of
mushy loaf I was hungry, but I just
didn't have any interest in eating. But
if I'd been able to use condiments to
spice it up a little a squirt of
sriracha, a dip into barbecue sauce
the monotony of the loaf might've
been made more palatable.
So just like how Nutraloaf might
have been easier to eat with ketchup
and mustard, adding a bit of variety
to our routines might be enough to
slow down the disillusionment that
comes with being in one place for a
long time. Things like walking to
places instead of biking, taking an in
teresting-looking class just for kicks,
going to a performance of a student
group you've never seen before.
Sometimes, it can feel like there's not
much to do on campus, but there's al

most always something going on.
Whether it'll actually be interesting,
who knows? Best-case scenario, you
stumble across something that turns
out to be crazy awesome. Worst-case
scenario, you spent an hour or two
doing something that you never want
to do again.
The worst-case scenario might
sound pretty bad, considering how
busy we already are, but if Nutraloaf
taught me anything, it's that those
worst-case scenarios actually make
everything else look so much better in
comparison. Before my time on Nu
traloaf, I'd been feeling a little tired of
the food at my house, but now?
Everything tastes amazing.
So if you're stuck in a slump and
you're feeling sort of listless? Just
think, "What Would a Pro Fro Do?"
and try something new out. (But not
Nutraloaf. There are much easier
ways to make things taste good
again.)

Tim wants to say to any FoShoFros out
there that Stanford is amazing. If you
