# FRESHLY BAKED
## Jadedness 
### Tim Moon 
Until this year, Admit Week
ends always unsettled me.
Don't get me wrong, I always
wanted the ProFros (Prospective
Frosh) to like their Admit Weekend
as much as I had so that they would
choose the best school in the coun
try, but there was something that al
ways got to me, just a little.
It wasn't the dangerous obstacle
course that biking through campus
became or the super long lines in the
dining halls; those were just minor in
conveniences. What got to me was
how "Gee, golly!" the ProFros were
about Stanford. I'd come in just as
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as a
freshman, but over time, I found my
self developing that slightly jaded at

you've come to know too well, a jad
edness that was always magnified
during Admit Weekend.
I'm sure that this feeling isn't en
tirely unfamiliar. After those initial
few months of freshman year
when you hang out with anyone and
everyone, when you run around be
tween 16 different clubs because
everything at the Activity Fair sound

the way to Ricker because you've

heard stories about how good the
food is you settle down into a
comfortable routine. You start hang
ing out mostly within your friend
group, you pare down those 16 clubs
into two or three, you keep eating at
your dining hall despite how tired
you are of the food there because it's
right there. That's when you might
start getting a little jaded, when
everything that was once new and
shiny becomes normal and boring,
when you stop seeing all of the stuff
you haven't done and complain
about the things you keep doing over
and over.
So given that I'm an old, seen-it
all senior, I should have been espe
cially jaded for Admit Weekend,
right? But this past weekend, when
ever I saw a Pro Fro, so happy to be
