The University recently changed the policy on co
ops, making it so that those who preselect into a
co-op only use their tier-three draw status. This
does not at all reflect the quality of housing that those
people enjoy, nor does it accurately reflect the demand
for these spots that is present in the community.
Despite some differences, co-op pre-assignees share
a lot with those living in Greek housing. They are a
group of people, living together, in houses in locations
ranging from the very bottom of the Row to out in the
boonies. They eat together, have kitchens, cook, choose
their own rooming situations and all in all have much
more control over their own living than students with
other University housing plans. They each choose their
future members, and co-op pre-assignment looks re
markably like guys' rush, with nights devoted to going
around to the various houses and manual labor tasks
given to prospective members who want to prove their
dedication.

And yet Housing treats these two alternate living or
ganizations very differently. If you join a fraternity and
live in the house your sophomore year, you give up your
tier one or, depending on the availability of the house
your senior year, potentially your tier-two housing. On
the other hand, if you pre-assign into a co-op, only your
tier three is used, leaving you with better tiers for future

years.
This would make sense if you were choosing to live
in a place that was very low demand. The Draw is de
signed to function like a market, with different housing
situations going earlier or later in the Draw based on
their desirability. But pre-assigning into a co-op seems
to circumvent this.There is incredibly high demand, and
many people who wish they could live in these houses
are turned away.
Take Kairos as an example near the bottom of
the Upper Row, great rooms, clean house. Nearly 60
people tried to pre-assign in for 13 spots. Other co-ops
had similarly competitive processes and were very dif
ficult to get into.
So it appears that there is an asymmetry in the mar-
