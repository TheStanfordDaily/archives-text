# No FREEE LUNCH
## The 						Price of Beer and Granola 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
The University recently changed the policy on co
ops, making it so that those who preselect into a
co-op only use their tier-three draw status. This
does not at all reflect the quality of housing that those
people enjoy, nor does it accurately reflect the demand
for these spots that is present in the community.
Despite some differences, co-op pre-assignees share
a lot with those living in Greek housing. They are a
group of people, living together, in houses in locations
ranging from the very bottom of the Row to out in the
boonies. They eat together, have kitchens, cook, choose
their own rooming situations and all in all have much
more control over their own living than students with
other University housing plans. They each choose their
future members, and co-op pre-assignment looks re
markably like guys' rush, with nights devoted to going
around to the various houses and manual labor tasks
given to prospective members who want to prove their
dedication.

And yet Housing treats these two alternate living or
ganizations very differently. If you join a fraternity and
live in the house your sophomore year, you give up your
tier one or, depending on the availability of the house
your senior year, potentially your tier-two housing. On
the other hand, if you pre-assign into a co-op, only your
tier three is used, leaving you with better tiers for future

years.
This would make sense if you were choosing to live
in a place that was very low demand. The Draw is de
signed to function like a market, with different housing
situations going earlier or later in the Draw based on
their desirability. But pre-assigning into a co-op seems
to circumvent this.There is incredibly high demand, and
many people who wish they could live in these houses
are turned away.
Take Kairos as an example near the bottom of
the Upper Row, great rooms, clean house. Nearly 60
people tried to pre-assign in for 13 spots. Other co-ops
had similarly competitive processes and were very dif
ficult to get into.
So it appears that there is an asymmetry in the mar-


ket, as is often the case when the
government or University tries to
subsidize the system[SWl]. For the
majority of students in regular
housing, you "pay" for what you get
with your draw number. Co-ops
and Greek houses exist outside of
this market because their current
members choose future members,
and thus, the University artificially
sets the "price" that you pay to live
in them.
The most equitable way to do
this would be to price each housing
option as it would end up being
priced were it in the Draw. Assess
supply and demand relative to
other housing options, price ac
cordingly. The Greek houses are in
relatively high demand, and are
priced as such, as tier one or two
housing. Co-ops are also in high
demand, but are priced compara
tively low. Some would obviously
not enjoy this type of housing or
the ethos that comes with it, but
the fact is that there is more than
enough demand to fill them with
enthusiastic members. And if this
is not the case, why aren't these
houses converted to the ever-pop
ular self-ops?
There are a couple ways of deal
ing with this. The most obvious is
that the University should raise the
cost of pre-assigning. If there are
still enough people to fill the hous

es at the same tier as similar sur
rounding locations, great. If not, the
University should reconsider
whether these locations are best
used as co-ops if there is not enough
demand for that kind of housing.
The University could allow the
houses to pre-assign more or all of
their members, leaving less spots
open to the Draw. The reason that
the University chooses to price the
co-ops so low is that the prefer
ences of people in the regular Draw
for co-ops is relatively low, but why
give these spots to people who
don't really want them instead of to
people who very much do?
It is great that Housing pro
motes different types of living
across campus and allows students
the freedom to choose how they
want to spend their time here on
the Farm. But in a system that tries
to be as fair as possible, it's absurd
that it only takes tier-three housing
for a specially selected group of in
dividuals to live at the very bottom
of the Row, while very best case it
costs you tier two to live in a soror
ity house almost as far away from
the center of campus as FroSoCo,
and tier-one Phi Kappa Psi is right
next to Kairos. The University ei
ther needs to right this asymmetry
or explain what interest it has in
promoting and subsidizing those
who choose to join co-ops over
other students.

other housing options, price ac
cordingly. The Greek houses are in
relatively high demand, and are
priced as such, as tier one or two
housing. Co-ops are also in high
demand, but are priced compara
tively low. Some would obviously
not enjoy this type of housing or
the ethos that comes with it, but
the fact is that there is more than
enough demand to fill them with
enthusiastic members. And if this
is not the case, why aren't these
houses converted to the ever-pop
ular self-ops?
There are a couple ways of deal
ing with this. The most obvious is
that the University should raise the
cost of pre-assigning. If there are
still enough people to fill the hous

es at the same tier as similar sur
rounding locations, great. If not, the
University should reconsider
whether these locations are best
used as co-ops if there is not enough
demand for that kind of housing.
The University could allow the
houses to pre-assign more or all of
their members, leaving less spots
open to the Draw. The reason that
the University chooses to price the
co-ops so low is that the prefer
ences of people in the regular Draw
for co-ops is relatively low, but why
give these spots to people who
don't really want them instead of to
people who very much do?
It is great that Housing pro
motes different types of living
across campus and allows students
the freedom to choose how they
want to spend their time here on
the Farm. But in a system that tries
to be as fair as possible, it's absurd
that it only takes tier-three housing
for a specially selected group of in
dividuals to live at the very bottom
of the Row, while very best case it
costs you tier two to live in a soror
ity house almost as far away from
the center of campus as FroSoCo,
and tier-one Phi Kappa Psi is right
next to Kairos. The University ei
ther needs to right this asymmetry
or explain what interest it has in
promoting and subsidizing those
who choose to join co-ops over
other students.
