## Reactions to Osama 
### JONATHAN POTO, '13 
I was at the Axe and Palm when I
saw on TV that they were preparing
for Obama's speech about the death
of Osama bin Laden. This is a short
piece I wrote immediately after in the
emotions of the experience.

A symbol of evil is dead today.
With his unconscionable
actions, Osama bin Laden
created fodder for the manipula
tors of our system to reach into that
trusted space of the American peo
ple, our patriotism. Our leaders en
tered the vulnerable space of our
collective psychological wounds
and blinded us to our responsibili
ty to protect not only our nation
from foreign threats, but also from
the very real threat of our leaders
usurping their power. Our genera
tion saw for itself that given the op
portunity, our leaders have not
only the capacity, but also the will

to take and expand that power
in the process demanding that we
allow our family and neighbors to
die, our children to fail and our cit
izens to struggle beyond what is
reasonable. Osama killed over
3,000 Americans and cracked
opened the floodgates for Scooter
Libby, Jack Abramoff, Alberto
Gonzalez and Dick Cheney, whose
lack of regard for our Constitution
and their roles of power led them
to wreck havoc upon the political
system of the United States.
Osama is dead, but the loss of all
those who died and suffered in
Iraq, Afghanistan, around the
world and the United States will
not be forgotten. However,
Osama's death, brought on by the
continued bravery of the United
States Armed Forces as well as the
leadership of President Obama,
truly does bring us hope and a lot

farther toward healing.
With this, a new wave of patriot
ism will arise, and while it may be of
different character of hope
rather than fear the results will
be the same. President Obama will
have the power of an American
people unified, willing to entrust
themselves more than ever to the
president. This group of both Re
publicans and Democrats will give
Obama the same trust George W.
Bush received following 9/11. We
have to ask, in this time of great
hope and great healing, will this in
credible power be used to incredi
ble ends? Or will the degradation of
this country go through a second
round? Will the American people
pay attention to their leaders this
time around? Will those with a
voice use that voice to cry foul when
