## 'WHAT IF' WEEKEND Cardinal comes up just short of taking series from Sun Devils 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball will no doubt
walk away from its weekend series
in Tempe, Ariz., against Arizona
State asking itself, "What if?"
What if the bullpen didn't col
lapse in game one? What if the of
fense could muster one more run in
the ninth to salvage the opener?
What if Sun Devil designated hitter
Joey DeMichele didn't explode for
three home runs in the rubber game
to ice the series?

If just a few of those hypothetical
had gone Stanford's way, the No. 21
Cardinal (21-16, 6-9 Pac-10) would
have turned a disappointing week
end into a season-changing series.
Stanford, behind sophomore
pitcher Mark Appel's electric arm,
seemed to have the series opener in
its grasp. The Cardinal jumped out
to a 3-0 lead in the third before No.
9 ASU (31-10,13-5) tacked on two
to make the game close.
Heading into the seventh, the
Cardinal led 4-3, but Appel began
to show signs of fatigue and could
n't hold onto the lead.The Sun Dev
ils scored three times to take a two
run lead.
After Stanford scored once in
the top half of the eighth to draw
within one, Stanford head coach

Mark Marquess handed the ball to
his usually dependable bullpen. It
was anything but that night. Fresh
man A.J. Vanegas and junior Scott
Snodgress combined to allow six
runs before junior A.J. Talt finally
stopped the bleeding.
That's where the fun began.
Trailing by seven, the Cardinal
needed a miracle. Freshman out
fielder Austin Wilson, who has been
mired in a slump, got Stanford be
lieving with a two-run homer. Se
nior catcher Zach Jones then nearly
made a believer out of every Cardi
nal player with a three-run homer
to cut the deficit to two.
But the comeback never materi
alized. Closer Mitchell Lambson fi
nally shut the door to end the game,
12-10.
Needing a big performance in
Game 2, senior Danny Sandbrink
delivered. Starting in only his sec
ond weekend game all season, Sand
brink rewarded Marquess's confi
dence by throwing a complete-game
gem. Sandbrink scattered five hits
and struck out a career-high eight to
even the series in a 6-4 victory.
Sandbrink is no stranger to high
pressure starts. The last time he
threw more than six innings in a
game? A complete-game win as a
freshman in the 2008 NCAA Re
gional.

The series came down to Sunday.
A series win would go a long way to
securing a playoff bid for the strug
gling Cardinal. A loss would mean a
long, somber flight home from
Tempe.

Yet in a continuation of a season
long problem for Stanford, the bats
went silent. Sophomore right-han
der Jake Barrett carved up the Car
dinal lineup, striking out 10 over
eight innings. Fittingly, Stanford
scored its only run on a wild pitch.
Junior Jordan Pries didn't have

his best stuff on the mound, surren
dering five runs over five innings.
Vanegas did have a nice bounce
back outing, throwing a scoreless
eighth. It wasn't enough, though, as
Stanford fell 7-1.
Fortunately for Stanford, it does
not have much time to keep going

over the "what ifs?"The Cardinal is
back in action tomorrow, visiting
San Jose State. After that, it will re
turn home for a weekend series
against last-place Washington.
