# Bringing back 9/11 memories
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
I awoke with 30 minutes left
until touchdown. As we
flew over the Bay Area, every
personal TV on the plane
each sporting 95 channels, as
Continental was quick to tell us
was turned to CNN. It was minutes
after the news broke, and the text on
screen was clear: Osama bin Laden
had been killed.
It was hard to contemplate. So I
didn't. Perspective took a back seat
to a confluence of various sensations
joy, excitement, pride and hate.
Resounding hate. We got back to our
house and blared everything from
"America, Fuck Yeah" to "Anchors
Aweigh." It was a SEAL team that
got him, after all. Twice, In the head.
Get some.
But in a moment between gearing
up for a celebratory Lake Lag bon
fire, running elatedly down the halls
and texting friends across the coun
try, the magnitude of the event set in.
I sat and was instantly overwhelmed.
I couldn't put the feeling into words,
but it was reminiscent of sadness a
rush of uncertainty, gloom and per
haps worst of all, hopelessness. And
then I realized what had hit me: the
same cocktail of emotions I felt near
ly a decade prior on that fateful Sep
tember morning.
I had reflected on my 9/11 experi
ence before Sunday, but I had never
felt like I had in that instance like
I was back in the body of my 11-year
old self, sitting in a seventh grade

math class listening to an assistant
principal read a curt report about an
accident at the World Trade Center.
Her statement was not one about
a far-off locale. I grew up in New
York City. This was home. Students
with parents who worked near the
towers were allowed to use the
phone to see if they were all right.
My dad worked in the area at the
time, so I went to place a call. We
connected. Next to me was a girl, try
ing to do the same with her father. I
don't know if she ever spoke to him
then, but I do know that he never
came home.
At that point, though, we didn't
know any details about anything
only that parents were chaotically
picking their children up from
school. The blanks were slowly filled
in, and by the time my mother ar
rived to retrieve my sister and me,
the towers had fallen an accident,
this was not.
We walked across Central Park.
We were miles away from Ground
Zero, but the plumes of smoke were
unmistakable. The spectacle was
breathtaking, and I could only imag
ine the scene at the towers them
selves. If I was two years older, I
would have been there a fresh
man at my eventual high school, lo
cated not a stone's throw away from
the WTC. But I wasn't. Dad was,
though, and since that short phone
call a couple of hours before, we
hadn't talked.
Cell service was down through
out the city. Landlines barely
worked, either in fact, it was a
small miracle we had connected at
all. My mom and Iâ€” my sister
couldn't stand the coverage
watched the news with amazement.
And with every passing hour, we
grew more and more concerned.
Dad worked about 130 blocks from
home a distance of nearly 6.5
miles but even then, my 11-year
old brain reasoned, it shouldn't take
till the late afternoon for him to
make it back.
He eventually walked through
the door, covered head-to-toe in ash.
God only knows what that dust once
was. He had minor burns on his
hands but was otherwise fine, just
exhausted. The image is forever
seared into my memory.
Our experience didn't end there.
My school was subjected to bomb
threats multiple times a week for
close to a year. But all things consid
ered, we were lucky. No family
members died, and while we knew
people who perished, so did mil

lions of other Americans. I do not
purport to feel the sorrow of those
who lost loved ones. I'm sure it re
tains its stranglehold to this day.
Osama's death may provide closure
to some, but I can understand if oth
ers are left wanting his newfound
place in hell doesn't bring back
those who perished. But at the least,
a measure of justice has been
served, and there seems to be at
least some air of closure to our na
tional healing.
It's a process that began while the
ruins were still hot, and it manifested
itself in our stadiums and ballparks.
The NFL postponed the games of
September 16 and 17, but on Sep
tember 23, the New York Giants
took to the field against the Kansas
City Chiefs, emerging from the tun
nel with NYPD and NYFD hats and
American flags. The Arrowhead
faithfully treated them like the
home team. President Bush threw
out the ceremonial first pitch a
strike at Yankee Stadium during
the World Series. The crowd roared.
These sporting cathedrals provided a
cathartic environment, a unifying
venue where tens of thousands could
rise as one.
It's fitting then, that perhaps the
first major celebration of Osama's
demise came at a baseball game, one
that featured the New York Mets
and the Philadelphia Phillies at Citi
zen Bank Park. In other words: a
matchup of two teams that despise
each other with a fiery passion, in a
city known for its hostility in the
sporting realm. But the news about
Osama spread like wildfire. The "U-
S-A" chants started and grew
stronger with each iteration.
And just like in the fall of2ool, we
were united again.
