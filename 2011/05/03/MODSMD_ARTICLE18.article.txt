# Bringing back 9/11 memories
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
I awoke with 30 minutes left
until touchdown. As we
flew over the Bay Area, every
personal TV on the plane
each sporting 95 channels, as
Continental was quick to tell us
was turned to CNN. It was minutes
after the news broke, and the text on
screen was clear: Osama bin Laden
had been killed.
It was hard to contemplate. So I
didn't. Perspective took a back seat
to a confluence of various sensations
joy, excitement, pride and hate.
Resounding hate. We got back to our
house and blared everything from
"America, Fuck Yeah" to "Anchors
Aweigh." It was a SEAL team that
got him, after all. Twice, In the head.
Get some.
But in a moment between gearing
up for a celebratory Lake Lag bon
fire, running elatedly down the halls
and texting friends across the coun
try, the magnitude of the event set in.
I sat and was instantly overwhelmed.
I couldn't put the feeling into words,
but it was reminiscent of sadness a
rush of uncertainty, gloom and per
haps worst of all, hopelessness. And
then I realized what had hit me: the
same cocktail of emotions I felt near
ly a decade prior on that fateful Sep
tember morning.
I had reflected on my 9/11 experi
ence before Sunday, but I had never
felt like I had in that instance like
I was back in the body of my 11-year
old self, sitting in a seventh grade
