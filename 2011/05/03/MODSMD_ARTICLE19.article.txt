Stanford Softball earned a series win
against Washington in its final homestand of
the season this weekend, taking two of three
over the Huskies to regain a winning confer
ence record.
Despite being blown out on Saturday 7-
1, the No. 13 Cardinal (35-11, 8-7 Pac-10)
rode two complete-game outings from
sophomore pitcher Teagan Gerhart to take
the contests on Friday and Sunday, clinching
the season series against No. 11 Washington
(32-11,7-8 Pac-10).

"It felt awesome to take the Washington
series, especially since it was our last home
Pac-10 Conference series," said sophomore
second baseman Jenna Rich. "Heading into
our last two weekends of conference play, I
feel that this win will boost our team to
snatch some more important victories be-
