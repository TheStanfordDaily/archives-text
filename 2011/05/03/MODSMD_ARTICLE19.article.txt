Stanford Softball earned a series win
against Washington in its final homestand of
the season this weekend, taking two of three
over the Huskies to regain a winning confer
ence record.
Despite being blown out on Saturday 7-
1, the No. 13 Cardinal (35-11, 8-7 Pac-10)
rode two complete-game outings from
sophomore pitcher Teagan Gerhart to take
the contests on Friday and Sunday, clinching
the season series against No. 11 Washington
(32-11,7-8 Pac-10).

"It felt awesome to take the Washington
series, especially since it was our last home
Pac-10 Conference series," said sophomore
second baseman Jenna Rich. "Heading into
our last two weekends of conference play, I

fore heading into postseason."
Gerhart earned her 20th win of
the season on Sunday after pitching
her 21st complete game. The two
wins move her to 20-8 on the year
she has a 1.61 ERA and is averaging
over a strikeout per inning. Junior
center fielder Sarah Hassman regis
tered her 31st stolen base in 33 at
tempts, tying the Stanford single
season record set in 2001 by Jessica
Mendoza. Hassman has been fun
damentally important to the Cardi
nal's success this year, batting .394
with a .506 on-base percentage in
the crucial leadoff spot.
Friday's 2-1 win saw Gerhart
doing it all for the Cardinal, as she
snapped a four-game losing streak
to Washington. At the plate, she
scored her team's first run and hit a
walk-off sacrifice fly to end it. In the
circle, she pitched a four-hit com
plete game while not surrendering
an earned run and striking out four.
Stanford got on the board right
away, coming home in the bottom of
the first. After Gerhart reached on a
fielder's choice, she stole second
(her 22nd steal of the season) and
was singled in by freshman left field
er Corey Hanewich.
Washington responded in the
fourth to tie the game at one. Center
fielder Kimi Pohlman reached on an
error and then stole second before
Washington pitcher Kaitlin Ingels

by knocked her in on a two-out sin
gle through the right side.
The Huskies threatened again in
the sixth, putting their first two run
ners on, but Gerhart got three
straight outs to wriggle out of the
jam.
Stanford broke the stalemate in
the bottom of the seventh. Sopho
more pinch-hitter Alix Van Zandt
reached on a hit-by-pitch, and jun
ior center fielder Maya Burns dou
bled to put two in scoring position
with no outs. Gerhart made the situ
ation count, hitting the walk-off sac
fly to right field. Ingelsby's loss
dropped her to 19-6 on the year.
Saturday's 7-1 loss showed why
Washington is a highly ranked team,
dominating the Cardinal on both
sides of the ball. Ingelsby bounced
back to pitch a four-hit complete
game win, allowing no earned runs
while striking out six. Stanford's
usually consistent pitcher senior
Ashley Chinn struggled, giving
up 10 hits, five walks and five earned
runs over seven innings. It was only
Chinn's third loss of the year, drop
ping her to a still impressive 15-3.
Washington scored three in the
second on three hits, two walks and
an error. Hassman scored Stanford's
lone run in the bottom of the third,
coming home on an error. Washing
ton scored another run in the fourth
and put the game well out of reach
with another three in the sixth, when
Huskies' first baseman Niki Williams
went deep to left center. She finished
with four RBI on the day.
The Cardinal jumped out early
during Sunday's rubber match and

never trailed, winning 3-1. Senior
first baseman Melisa Koutz led off
the second inning with a walk. Stan
ford then went on to load the bases
and score, as Hassman singled in
Koutz to right field.
Stanford loaded the bases again
in the third, chasing Washington
starter Bryana Walker from the cir
cle. The Huskies went with Ingelsby
for the third day in a row, and the
move paid off. Ingelsby got Burns to
ground out and then struck out jun
ior third baseman Jenna Becerra to
end the inning.
But the Cardinal once again
loaded the bases in the fourth on
consecutive no-out singles by Ger
hart, Hassman and junior shortstop
Ashley Hansen. Rich then drew an
RBI walk, plating Gerhart and giv
ing Stanford the lead. Hassman
scored on an RBI fielder's choice by
freshman right fielder Michelle
Prong, sliding in to beat the throw at
home.
The Huskies derailed Gerhart's
shutout bid in the sixth when Jenn
Sailing hit a sac fly to center, scoring
Morgan Stuart. It was the lone run
Gerhart would give up, as she al
lowed just four hits and no walks
while striking out eight.
Stanford's final home game of
the season is tonight at 6 p.m.
against Santa Clara. The Cardinal
then closes out its season with back
to-back weekend road trips to con
ference foes Oregon and Arizona
State.

more pinch-hitter Alix Van Zandt
reached on a hit-by-pitch, and jun
ior center fielder Maya Burns dou
bled to put two in scoring position
with no outs. Gerhart made the situ
ation count, hitting the walk-off sac
fly to right field. Ingelsby's loss
dropped her to 19-6 on the year.
Saturday's 7-1 loss showed why
Washington is a highly ranked team,
dominating the Cardinal on both
sides of the ball. Ingelsby bounced
back to pitch a four-hit complete
game win, allowing no earned runs
while striking out six. Stanford's
usually consistent pitcher senior
Ashley Chinn struggled, giving
up 10 hits, five walks and five earned
runs over seven innings. It was only
Chinn's third loss of the year, drop
ping her to a still impressive 15-3.
Washington scored three in the
second on three hits, two walks and
an error. Hassman scored Stanford's
lone run in the bottom of the third,
coming home on an error. Washing
ton scored another run in the fourth
and put the game well out of reach
with another three in the sixth, when
Huskies' first baseman Niki Williams
went deep to left center. She finished
with four RBI on the day.
The Cardinal jumped out early
during Sunday's rubber match and

never trailed, winning 3-1. Senior
first baseman Melisa Koutz led off
the second inning with a walk. Stan
ford then went on to load the bases
and score, as Hassman singled in
Koutz to right field.
Stanford loaded the bases again
in the third, chasing Washington
starter Bryana Walker from the cir
cle. The Huskies went with Ingelsby
for the third day in a row, and the
move paid off. Ingelsby got Burns to
ground out and then struck out jun
ior third baseman Jenna Becerra to
end the inning.
But the Cardinal once again
loaded the bases in the fourth on
consecutive no-out singles by Ger
hart, Hassman and junior shortstop
Ashley Hansen. Rich then drew an
RBI walk, plating Gerhart and giv
ing Stanford the lead. Hassman
scored on an RBI fielder's choice by
freshman right fielder Michelle
Prong, sliding in to beat the throw at
home.
The Huskies derailed Gerhart's
shutout bid in the sixth when Jenn
Sailing hit a sac fly to center, scoring
Morgan Stuart. It was the lone run
Gerhart would give up, as she al
lowed just four hits and no walks
while striking out eight.
Stanford's final home game of
the season is tonight at 6 p.m.
against Santa Clara. The Cardinal
then closes out its season with back
to-back weekend road trips to con
ference foes Oregon and Arizona
State.

rode two complete-game outings from

the contests on Friday and Sunday, clinching
the season series against No. 11 Washington

feel that this win will boost our team to
snatch some more important victories be-

the season on Sunday after pitching
her 21st complete game. The two
wins move her to 20-8 on the year
she has a 1.61 ERA and is averaging
over a strikeout per inning. Junior
center fielder Sarah Hassman regis

Friday's 2-1 win saw Gerhart
doing it all for the Cardinal, as she
snapped a four-game losing streak
to Washington. At the plate, she
scored her team's first run and hit a
walk-off sacrifice fly to end it. In the
circle, she pitched a four-hit com
plete game while not surrendering
an earned run and striking out four.
Stanford got on the board right
away, coming home in the bottom of
the first. After Gerhart reached on a
fielder's choice, she stole second
(her 22nd steal of the season) and
was singled in by freshman left field
er Corey Hanewich.
Washington responded in the
fourth to tie the game at one. Center
fielder Kimi Pohlman reached on an
error and then stole second before
Washington pitcher Kaitlin Ingels

by knocked her in on a two-out sin
gle through the right side.
The Huskies threatened again in
the sixth, putting their first two run
ners on, but Gerhart got three
straight outs to wriggle out of the
jam.

the bottom of the seventh. Sopho
