# Families cope with tuition increases
## Households at aid cutoffs feel pinch of yearly hikes 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
March 15, 2011 was not a particularly important
day for most people, but that Tuesday was embla
zoned into the mind of Cristal Garcia 'll and her fam
ily: it was the final tuition payment deadline for Gar
cia's final quarter at Stanford. But more than that, it
marked a symbolic, though not exactly triumphant,
end to the Chicago native's four-year battle to pay for
college.
"I think tuition is really getting out of hand," said
Omelia Garcia, Cristal's mother and a parent of three
in Chicago's western suburbs. She was barely finish
ing up the college payments for her oldest daughter
when Cristal got into Stanford. To swing the cost,
Garcia had to mortgage one of the family's houses
a revenue source to pay the college bill.
"It's been so hard, but somehow we manage,"

Omelia Garcia said. "Somehow we'll manage. We've
got just one more quarter at Stanford."
Tuition hikes are not a new topic in discussions
about higher education; headlines around the coun
try scream about the skyrocketing costs of college,
pointing to upwards of 30 percent increases at public
institutions in California and across-the-board slash
es to states' higher education budgets.
Private institutions like Stanford have been
shielded from such dramatic year-to-year increases
but have still seen substantial raises. From 2000 to the
present, Stanford's price of admission each year has
risen a little more than four percent on average. The
$52,341 sticker price for tuition plus room and board
next year is more than double the cost students paid
30 years ago.
In 2008, Stanford announced its most significant

increase in financial aid to date.
Under this program, families
whose annual income are less than
$lOO,OOO a year are asked to con
tribute a maximum of $12,500,
while no parental contribution is
expected of families who earned
below $60,000. Other elite schools
like Harvard University, Yale Uni
versity and Pomona College spear
headed similar aid packages.
While Stanford's aid expansion
aims to help the middle class, indi
viduals hovering at the margins of
aid thresholds are being hit with a
storm of escalating college costs,
decreased funds for higher educa
tion and personal economic insta
bility. Even financial aid can't rem
edy the picture for those individu
als.
The Garcia family is right on
this threshold, making them espe
cially sensitive to the yearly tuition
increases. The changing aid thresh
olds have meant that Garcia's fi
nancial bracket is in quarterly flux,
depending year to year on how
much her family makes.
Because her parents are both
self-employed and do not have sta
ble incomes, the moving aid target
creates a situation where Garcia
says that "money is always on my
mind."
In her freshman year, Garcia's
family had to pay $34,800, nearly
the full cost of tuition. Since the
2008 aid policy change, Garcia is el
igible for more aid though her
quarterly contributions vary, de
pending on that year's household
income.
Parents whose incomes lie be
yond the financial aid cutoff also
feel the impact of the annual in
creases. Mien Shih, a Saratoga par
ent who put three children through
Stanford without financial aid, is
one of dwindling minority of par
ents who pay the full price of Stan
ford admission.
Only about 20 percent of Stan
ford students receive no aid or
grants and pay full freight, accord
ing to Karen Cooper, director of fi
nancial aid. Since about 2008, ap
proximately 80 percent of under
graduates do not pay Stanford's
full sticker price.
Nationally, about one third of

full-time students pay the full price
of college with no grant assistance,
according to the College Board's
Trends in College Pricing 2010 re
port.
About half of the undergradu
ate student body receives need
based financial aid today, which is
up from a typical year in the 1990s
where only about 41 percent of stu
dents qualified, according to Coop
er.
Shih paid for his first daughter, a
2000 grad, his son, a 2004 grad and
now his third child, Tiffany Shih 'll.
He has paid more than half a mil
lion dollars in college fees to Stan
ford over the past 15 years.
Tiffany Shih says that while she
is peripherally aware of increasing
college prices, they have little im
pact on her immediate life,
"In the end, my parent's philos
ophy is to get the best education
you can and to worry about the
money later," she said. "I'm sure it
was more of a factor for my parents
than for me. But my parents always
made education a priority."
"Paying for three Stanford stu
dents is a big thing," she added.
"But they've managed to make it
work, and they try to keep us from
worrying about it."
While expanded aid packages

allow students like Garcia to
scramble together enough money
to pay for a Stanford education,
their experience on the Farm looks
very different from that of other
students who don't have perennial
money worries looming over their
heads.
Money, however, remains a con
cern for Garcia. Although she has
taken advantage of Stanford's myr
iad opportunities as an Interna
tional Relations major, she went to
Stanford outposts in Oxford, Chile
and Florence she said that some
things had to give. Bogged down
with 10 hours of work-study a
week, four classes, extracurriculars
and graduate scholarship hunts
that became "almost like a hobby,"
Garcia's social life took a hit.
"We all sacrifice things to come
to college," said Garcia. "I sacri
ficed having a social life."
The rate of tuition increase is in
the hands of the Board of Trustees,
who consult with the University
president and financial aid offices
to determine tuition costs. In 1996,
when the Board increased tuition
by 4 percent the lowest tuition
rise in almost three decades at the
time Trustee Charles Ogletree
'74 MA '75, then a member of the
board's finance committee, said
trustees were "mindful that the
burden on the middle class in try
ing to support children pursuing
higher education has increased."
He said that the Board had tried
to balance "business judgment and
compassion."
According to Omelia Garcia,
they've had mixed success, despite
good intentions. "We have never
asked the government for a penny
from welfare. We worked our way
up, learned the language and I
think other people can," said Gar
cia, who hails from Durango, Mexi
co. "But I think college should be
easier. I hope that the government
will do something for the kids who
need more help."
For the time being, however,
students like Shih, who pay full tu
ition, say that while Stanford is ex
pensive, they've gotten what
they've paid for.
"I don't know if it's too expen
sive," Shih said. "But I think that
the difference between me going
here and me going to a UC was
worth the difference in cost."
