### REBECCA HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the MPSF Tournament final against
Oregon this Sunday, the Stanford
women's lacrosse team struggled early
but never gave up as it earned its seventh
consecutive conference tournament title.
Stanford took down the Ducks with a 12-
10 victory.
Stanford came out flat in the first part
of the game, and Oregon took advantage.

The Ducks exploded out of the gates with
high energy, building up a 7-0 lead against
the Cardinal with 14:28 left in the half.
After the seven goals, Stanford head
coach Amy Bokker knew she had to make
a change in order to keep the team in the
game.

Freshman goalie Lyndsey Munoz took
over in the cage for senior Annie Read and
made seven huge saves, which changed the
momentum and kept the Card in the game.
Munoz played the rest of the game and
only let in three goals. For her remarkable
efforts, Munoz was rewarded Tournament
MVP.
With 15:02 left to play in the first half,
Stanford got on the board with a goal by
