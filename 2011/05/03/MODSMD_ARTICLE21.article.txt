## CARD HAS FOUR PICKED IN NFL DRAFT 
### NATE ADAMS JACOB JAFFE 
Four Stanford football alumni made the jump to
the NFL over the weekend, with nose tackle Sione
Fua, fullback/linebacker Owen Marecic, corner
back Richard Sherman and wide receiver Ryan
Whalen each getting the call during the 2011 NFL
Draft in New York City. Fua was selected by the
Carolina Panthers with the last pick in the third
round, Marecic by the Cleveland Browns with the
27th pick in the fourth round, Sherman by the Seat
tle Seahawks with the 23rd pick of the fifth round
and Whalen by the Cincinnati Bengals with the sec
ond pick of the sixth round.
It took until the final pick of day two, but Stan
ford football finally saw its first player picked in the
2011 NFL Draft with Fua. Marecic, Sherman and
Whalen all got the call on the third day.
Fua was a cornerstone of the Cardinal's hybrid 3-
4 defense in 2010. He finished the season with 23
total tackles and 4.5 sacks, but his most valuable
asset may have been his ability to take on double
teams and allow his teammates to make plays. His

play at the point of attack helped
the team improve from 69th in the
nation in scoring defense in 2009 to
10th in 2010, a big reason why
Stanford went 12-1 and won the
Orange Bowl for the first time in
school history.
Along with the compensatory
pick they used to take Fua, the
Panthers also took Auburn quar
terback Cam Newton with the No.
1 overall pick and South Florida
defensive tackle Terrell McClain
with the first pick of the third
round.
At 6-foot-1.5, Fua is considered
to be on the short side for a defen
sive tackle, but his work ethic and
speed were strong enough to get
him picked in the third round.
As a rare two-way starter who
regularly played offense and de
fense, Marecic played a unique
role in Stanford's recent resur
gence. Fie finished 10th in Heis
man Trophy balloting last season,
when he served as a tri-captain and
earned All-American honors as an
all-purpose player. He was also an
All-Pac-10 selection as a running
back and an honorable mention as
a linebacker.
Marecic also received the inau
gural Paul Hornung Award in his
senior season, which honors the
most versatile player in college
football. He finished fifth on the
team with 51 tackles, two sacks and
two interceptions as a linebacker
and rushed 23 times for 46 yards
and a career-high five touchdowns
as a fullback. Though Marecic is ca
pable of playing both positions, he
entered the draft as a fullback, and
it appears that the Browns plan to
pair him with running back Peyton
Hillis in their backfield.
Sherman also has experience
on both sides of the ball. He
switched from wide receiver to
cornerback before the 2009 sea
son, when he finished fourth on the
team with 62 tackles and also had
two interceptions, including one he
returned 43 yards for a touchdown
against USC. He earned Pac-10
honors in his senior season, notch
ing 50 tackles and four intercep
tions as a left cornerback.
Rounding out Stanford's
draftees was Whalen, whose selec
tion gave the Cardinal its highest
number of draft selections since
2006, with four. As a tri-captain
with Marecic and Fua last season,
Whalen was an All-Pac-10 honor
able mention with 39 receptions
for 415 yards and two touchdowns,
despite missing two games due to
injury. Though Whalen joined the
team as a walk-on in 2007, he fin
ished his collegiate career with 138
receptions for 1,860 yards and
seven touchdowns.
Seven former Stanford players
went undrafted linebacker
Thomas Keiser, tackle Derek Hall,
guard Andrew Phillips, center
Chase Beeler, tight end Konrad
Reuland, wide receiver Doug
Baldwin and kicker Nate Whitak
er. Each is now free to sign with
any team that offers him a contract
as an undrafted free agent.
