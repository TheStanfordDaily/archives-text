# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Card suffers first loss in MPSFs 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
With the top seed and an unde
feated regular season, the Stanford
women's water polo team headed
into the MPSF Tournament aiming
to win it all and qualify for the
NCAA Tournament.

The No. 1 Cardinal (25-1) only
managed to accomplish one of the
two goals.

Playing three games in three
days, the squad went 2-1, upset by
No. 4 UCLA, 9-8, in the semifinal
match on Saturday. Stanford re
bounded nicely on Sunday, captur
ing third place in the tournament
with a 15-5 victory against No. 6 San
Jose State. The third-place finish en
abled the Cardinal to qualify for the
NCAA Tournament with an at
large bid.
On Friday, Stanford opened up
the MPSF Tournament against No.
8 Arizona State, The Card, down 2-1
early, went on a 10-0 run to cruise to
a 15-6 victory. Four players soph
omore two-meter Annika Dries,
junior driver Alyssa Lo, junior two

meter Melissa Seidemann and
sophomore driver Victoria
Kennedy had multiple goals.
The offense was complemented
by great defense and goalie play, as
senior goalie Amber Oland had 10
saves in the first half, holding the
Sun Devils to only two goals and a
scoreless second period. In the sec
ond half, sophomore goalie Kate
Baldoni notched six stops.

"It was not a real emotional
game," said head coach John Tan
ner. "It was a matter of us putting
away some of our opportunities in
the first so we could get off to that

comfortable lead. Then, they lost
some of that confidence they
played with early. We were pretty
sloppy, especially in the second
half."
The next day, Stanford faced a
much tougher UCLA team that
only lost by three goals in its last
meeting versus the Cardinal.
Stanford was in a peculiar posi
tion at halftime, down 5-3 with the
momentum on the Bruins' side. Sei
demann and senior Kim Krueger
would answer, notching two quick
goals to tie the game at five. After
goals from each team brought the
score to 6-6, UCLA became the
first team all season to close the
door on the Cardinal.
A 3-0 fourth-period run gave
UCLA a commanding 9-6 advan
tage. The final part of the fourth
quarter between the Bruins and
Stanford drew many parallels to
last year's national championship
game between Stanford and USC,
which Stanford lost 10-9.
Last year, Stanford was down
10-6 against the Women of Troy and
clawed back with three goals, all
coming in a span of 96 seconds. A
missed shot by Dries with 10 sec
onds left sealed the deal against
USC.

Down 9-6 against UCLA, Stan
ford answered with two goals in a
span of 54 seconds: one by Lo and
one by Dries.
With 3:22 left in the game, the
Cardinal earned two golden oppor
tunities for the equalizing score
with two power play possessions

but could not capitalize on either.
"We spent a lot of energy play
ing 5-on-6 and scrambled the first
quarter, because we were down a
good bit of the quarter," Tanner
said. "We were still in the game, but
then they started making some nice
shots outside, and we didn't do a

great job on offense finishing our
opportunities. Each time we got
close, they would score."
Against San Jose State on Sun
day, Stanford looked to finish the
MPSF Tournament strong and did
exactly that, overwhelming the
Spartans in their home pool to win
15-5.
"It's the third time we've played
Stanford and they hammered us
every time," said San Jose State
head coach Lou Tully. "I felt at this
point, we had nothing to lose, and I
wanted our other players to play,
and I wanted some different rota
tions. That was the closest we
played them. They're really a great
team."
The Cardinal came out firing on
all cylinders, scoring the first seven
goals of the game. Junior driver
Pallavi Menon had a game-high six
goals. Baldoni had a game-high
nine saves, with seven coming in the
first period.
With the third-place finish in the
MPSF Tournament and an unde
feated regular season, Stanford has
earned an automatic bid and No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament.
Three other MPSF schools USC,
UCLA and Cal will join Stan
ford in Ann Arbor, Mich.
Stanford will face the winner of
the play-in match between Red
lands and lona on May 13 at 6 p.m.
