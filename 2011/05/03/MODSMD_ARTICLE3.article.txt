Mae Jemison '77, a physician and
the first African-American woman

following the assassination of Mar

"But all around me I saw this explo

and people weren't as enthusiastic
to see me, but I wouldn't leave," she
said. "I stayed in the class. I may
have floated back to the back row,
but I didn't leave."
In addition to her engineering
coursework, Jemison fit in several
classes in Swahili and AAAS, which
