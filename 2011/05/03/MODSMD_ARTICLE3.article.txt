## Jemison discusses education Lecture marks 100th anniversary of Drake's birth 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Mae Jemison '77, a physician and
the first African-American woman
to travel in space, spoke at the St.
Clair Drake Memorial Lecture
Monday afternoon. Jemison studied
African and African American
Studies (AAAS) under Drake, who
founded the AAAS program. She
honored her mentor by recounting
the impact that his major had on her
career.
Jemison, who also majored in
chemical engineering, recalled feel
ing the pressures of being a "colored
woman" in a science and engineer
ing field.
"I would look up at the stars and
assumed that I would go into space,
but I also remembered the National
Guard marching behind my home
following the assassination of Mar
tin Luther King, Jr.," Jemison said.
"But all around me I saw this explo
sion of new ideas and possibilities, a
world that was changing rapidly."
Although it was less overt at the
Farm, Jemison said she sometimes
experienced isolation in her youth,
feeling like an outsider among her
peers.
"I was sitting up in the front row,
and people weren't as enthusiastic
to see me, but I wouldn't leave," she
said. "I stayed in the class. I may
have floated back to the back row,
but I didn't leave."
In addition to her engineering
coursework, Jemison fit in several
classes in Swahili and AAAS, which
gave her the confidence to excel.
This training in the social sciences
also changed the way she thought,
teaching her to ask questions in a
different way.
"There's a confidence about
knowing about yourself and people
that's really important," she said. "It
gave me the confidence to know
that every group of people had
made contributions to this world,
whether it's in the sciences [or] so
cial sciences."
"You have to believe in yourself
first," Jemison added. "You have to
believe that you have a right to be
involved. That's what AAAS
helped me to know."
April House 'll brought several
of her young children along to the
Drake Memorial talk.
"As a member of the [AAAS]
department, I go every year, but I
really wanted my children to see
Mae Jamison," House said. "She's
someone I've long admired. Being
able to see her speak with my chil
dren is an unparalleled experience."

House's nine-year-old daughter,
Alexis Stull, sat in the audience
holding a book about Jemison.
"It was a really cool talk," Stull
said. "I'm really interested, because
I'm going to be a doctor when I
grow up, and I thought it would be
really cool to be an astronaut and
doctor like her."
Following her remarks, Jemison
fielded questions from the audi
ence, Many asked about Jemison's
work promoting science and tech
nology education, which has been
one of her longstanding passions.
This passion grew from her work
in AAAS, which led her to realize
that "we can't solve any world prob
lems unless we have everybody at
the same table."
That belief motivated Jemison to
start The Earth We Share, an inter
national science camp that invites
students and teachers to strengthen
their science education.
"How can I expect the world to
go on if we're not educating the next
great generation?" she said.
"Whether the future ends up like
Star Trek or Blade Runner, it's our
choice, and we have to take that."
