## Amartya Sen talks human rights debate Economics Nobel laureate featured at Arrow lecture 
### ELIZABETH TITUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the 21st century, not even
revered Nobel laureates are exempt
from a little of the Facebook intrigue
usually reserved for college students;
Amartya Sen knows firsthand, he told
a Stanford audience on Monday.
Checking into a hotel last summer,
he met a hotel concierge who said he
had been following Sen on Facebook.
The 77-year-old Flarvard professor
told the concierge he didn't have an ac
count on the social networking site.
"Yes, you do," the concierge said.
Moreover, he added, "I've been follow
ing how your views have changed."
As Sen discovered in a story he later
took to The Hindustan Times, a
stranger with views "way to the right"
of the real economist had made a Face
book account in his name and
found an eager audience online.
Sen recounted the story to a capaci
ty audience at Cubberley Auditorium
on Monday as he took questions on
human rights, public debate in the In
ternet age and social-choice theory, an
undercurrent of his research for the
last five decades. For that work, Sen
was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in
economics.
Digital forums weighed on the audi
ence's mind a day after news that U.S.
forces killed Osama bin Laden in Pak
istan spread blindingly through online
networks. An audience member ap
proaching the microphone told Sen his
question was only tangentially related
