## Amartya Sen talks human rights debate Economics Nobel laureate featured at Arrow lecture 
### ELIZABETH TITUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the 21st century, not even
revered Nobel laureates are exempt
from a little of the Facebook intrigue
usually reserved for college students;
Amartya Sen knows firsthand, he told
a Stanford audience on Monday.
Checking into a hotel last summer,
he met a hotel concierge who said he
had been following Sen on Facebook.
The 77-year-old Flarvard professor
told the concierge he didn't have an ac
count on the social networking site.
"Yes, you do," the concierge said.
Moreover, he added, "I've been follow
ing how your views have changed."
As Sen discovered in a story he later
took to The Hindustan Times, a
stranger with views "way to the right"
of the real economist had made a Face
book account in his name and
found an eager audience online.
Sen recounted the story to a capaci
ty audience at Cubberley Auditorium
on Monday as he took questions on
human rights, public debate in the In
ternet age and social-choice theory, an
undercurrent of his research for the
last five decades. For that work, Sen
was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in
economics.
Digital forums weighed on the audi
ence's mind a day after news that U.S.
forces killed Osama bin Laden in Pak
istan spread blindingly through online
networks. An audience member ap
proaching the microphone told Sen his
question was only tangentially related
to the scholar's talk entitled "Social
Choice and Human Rights."
"I hope it's not about Osama bin
Laden," Sen quipped.
Later, a man from Qatar asked
Sen to explain why human rights
violations persist in Qatar despite
the existence of a relatively free
press.
"There are a lot of human rights
violations in this country" and in
India, said Sen, whose work on In
dian famine is renowned. Public
discussion helps human rights pre
vail, he said, but it cannot be a soci
ety's sole response to oppression.
"Would I like China to have
more debates about liberty? Yes,"
Sen added. "But that doesn't mean
that I think the moment you intro
duce them [debates], the violations
will go away."
Stanford professor Debra Satz,
director of the McCoy Family Cen

ter for Ethics in Society, lauded the
economist as "perhaps the most
powerful voice for restoring an eth
ical dimension to economics."
"If you think the GDP doesn't
get at all the things we ought to care
about when we're thinking about
the measure of America or the
measure of India, he's done an
enormous amount to call attention
to how people's lives really go that
isn't visible simply by looking at a
GDP point of view," Satz said.
Sen's talk was the second of two
lectures in the Ethics in Society
program's annual Arrow Lecture
Series for 2010-11. The series is
named after Stanford economist
Kenneth Arrow, Sen's fellow
Nobel laureate in economics,
whose "'stunning' impossibility
theorem" Sen first encountered in
1952. The first Arrow lecture of the
year was delivered in February by
Jonathan Glover of King's Col
lege, who spoke on war and human
nature.
