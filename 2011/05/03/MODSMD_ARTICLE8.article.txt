## Self-referrals increase health costs 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford study published late last month
found that if your doctor buys a magnetic reso
nance imaging (MRI) machine,you're more like
ly to get an MRI scan for lower back pain. If you
go to an orthopedic surgeon, you're also more
likely to get surgery. These procedures are often
not helpful to patients and can drive up health
care costs.
"One of the major reasons why healthcare ex
penditures are rising is because we're using tech
nology such as advanced imaging such as MRIs
too much," said Jacqueline Shreibati M.S. 'O9
M.D. 'lO, a resident in internal medicine at Stan
ford and the chief investigator on the study. "We
wanted to demonstrate that there is not only in
creased use of MRIs, but also that this increased
use of MRI could lead to something called a
treatment cascade, where patients can receive

subsequent procedures which are of low value to
the patient and that can also drive up healthcare
expenditures."
Shreibati looked at Medicare data for patients
with non-specific back pain that is, back pain
without a specified diagnosis like a herniated disk
or spinal stenosis. Surgery does not generally
benefit this type of back pain and, in best practice,
should not be prescribed.
She looked at patients seen by both primary
care physicians and orthopedic surgeons for the
problem. Both types of practitioners recom
mended more MRIs for the back pain after ac
quiring their own MRI machine than they did be
fore.
Shreibati calls that problem "physician self-re
ferral." Since the doctor can bill for the procedure
he's recommending, he has the incentive to pre
scribe it, even when it's unnecessary.
