## Self-referrals increase health costs 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford study published late last month
found that if your doctor buys a magnetic reso
nance imaging (MRI) machine,you're more like
ly to get an MRI scan for lower back pain. If you
go to an orthopedic surgeon, you're also more
likely to get surgery. These procedures are often
not helpful to patients and can drive up health
care costs.
"One of the major reasons why healthcare ex
penditures are rising is because we're using tech
nology such as advanced imaging such as MRIs
too much," said Jacqueline Shreibati M.S. 'O9
M.D. 'lO, a resident in internal medicine at Stan
ford and the chief investigator on the study. "We
wanted to demonstrate that there is not only in
creased use of MRIs, but also that this increased
use of MRI could lead to something called a
treatment cascade, where patients can receive

subsequent procedures which are of low value to
the patient and that can also drive up healthcare
expenditures."
Shreibati looked at Medicare data for patients
with non-specific back pain that is, back pain
without a specified diagnosis like a herniated disk
or spinal stenosis. Surgery does not generally
benefit this type of back pain and, in best practice,
should not be prescribed.
She looked at patients seen by both primary
care physicians and orthopedic surgeons for the
problem. Both types of practitioners recom
mended more MRIs for the back pain after ac
quiring their own MRI machine than they did be
fore.
Shreibati calls that problem "physician self-re
ferral." Since the doctor can bill for the procedure
he's recommending, he has the incentive to pre
scribe it, even when it's unnecessary.
Study co-author Laurence Baker,
who is also a professor of health re
search and policy, said there is the ad
ditional problem of efficiency and
scale when private or clinic physi
cians buy these machines, since there
is a smaller population that uses them
than in a large hospital setting. He
thinks the method of paying doctors
leads to this wasteful situation.
"I think the payment system that
we have should be reformed so that
we don't encourage a lot of purchase
of this equipment in physician of
fices," he said. "We should keep
them in places where there is a larg
er population of patients and where
physicians themselves don't develop
a direct financial benefit from order
ing these services."
Shreibati then addressed the
question of how increased imaging
affects the surgeries of patients with
lower back pain. Using a two-step
mathematical model, she deter
mined that more frequent imaging
after acquiring the MRI machine in
creased surgeries among patients of
orthopedic surgeons by almost a
third. For primary care doctors,
there was no statistically significant
relationship.
"We found a pretty tight relation
ship between an orthopedic surgeon
ordering a scan and that scan lead
ing to surgery," Shreibati said.
She credited this relationship in
part to a second level of self-referral,
since the orthopedic surgeon will

also do the surgery, and there is no
additional physician involved.
This study adds to the literature
on the current issue of cutting rising
healthcare costs in the United
States. Advanced technology adds
significantly to treatment costs.
Thus, cutting unnecessary use or re
ducing collateral spending could
make a big difference,
"It goes to the bigger question of
how efficient we can be with our
technology," Baker said. "How do
evolving technologies impact not
just the use of a particular type of
service but overall care of patients?"
Shreibati hopes that the study
reaches those who can change the
payment system for advanced imag
ing in hopes of discouraging over
use.
"[The study] was aimed at a poli
cy audience to demonstrate that
there should be some caution when
there is unrestrained use of MRIs,
because it not only drives up health
care expenditures in and of itself, but
it can lead to increased downstream
healthcare expenditures," she said.
"It's reinforcing the importance of
finding ways to restrict the use of ad
vanced imaging."
Medicare has already reduced
the payment for MRI scans. In the
face of rising costs. Baker thinks that
private companies may do so as well.
Both Shreibati and Baker hope that
changed economic incentives for
owning advanced imaging technolo
gy as a physician will play some part
in the nationwide effort to reduce
healthcare spending.
