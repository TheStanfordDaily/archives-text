# G'day Brisbane
## 
### Johnny Bartz 
It was a corker of a flight to the
land down under, except for the
person in front of me who
opened their lunch and the baby
who spit the dummy (thank God for
earplugs!). I rocked up in Brisbane
two days later, on a quest to check
out a Ph.D. programme and experi
ence the Australian lifestyle.
Most of the blokes and sheilas at
the hostel were from Germany or
England, there on year-long holi
day. Turns out it's pretty easy to get
a holiday work visa, so my mates
just wandered city to city, job to job.
I wish I could take holiday that long.
I was at the pool with my mates
in the afternoon when the sheila
from the hostel came in asking if
anyone needed labor. Freddie was
about out of bread, so he said 'Bonz
er' and raced up the apples and
pears as fast as his plates of meat
could carry him so he could dog on
the bone with his potential employ
er. Funny how those blokes are al

ways trying to make a crust
drives all us job searchers marbles
and conkers that wages are so high
and one can literally sit in the pool
to get work.

Driving around town or
should I say riding in vans around
town was a bit unnerving as it
seemed we would ram a bus at
every right turn. Navigation on foot
in the city was especially difficult,
considering the Brisbane River me
anders through. I of course had no
map. Luckily I could grab the City-
Cat ferry service or just ride around
on the bus. I was sure not to spit on
the bus, as prominent signs inform
that drivers have DNA kits to aid
the prosecution of spitters. (Is spit
ting on the bus a thing these days?)
I lobbed-in at the Uni, happy as
Larry to meet with a sheila from my
prospective programme. After a
great yabber, I explored the lay of
the land. The main quad was oddly
familiar, and 'science land' was even
off in the Never Never of the cam
pus. At one point I was a bit lost, and
while walking along the ponds I al
most tripped over a goanna. Galahs
and cockies laughed at me in the
trees, but nonetheless the Aus
tralian wildlife had me away with
the pixies. Queensland has it all
koalas, roos with joeys, not to men
tion the crocks and the Great Barri
er Reef at the top end.
I went around town with my
champs to get free WiFi and air-con
at the public library, followed by a
walk along the river. Freddie was
sure to wear his sunblock so he did
n't epitomize an English stereotype.
We got hungry, but tucker and drog
are expensive through the roof. So
instead of scabbin' off a friend, we
found a cheap kebab place and gro
cery store, ensuring we didn't starve
to death or break the bank.

When I was ready to splurge, I
grabbed a feed at the Pancake
Manor in downtown Brizzie. The
24-hour restaurant features giant
plates of pancakes, among other
tasty things. Buttermilk, chocolate,
blueberries, cherries, strawberries,
banana, caramel name your
favourite, and you can have it on a
pancake. But real Aussies have
sweet potato fries dipped in mayon
naise and paprika.

I was a bit dismayed that Brisve
gas didn't have a real beach, so I
went down to the Gold Coast with a
couple of sheilas. At the Gold Coast

Aquatic Center we tanned, and
swam with the national swimmers
and triathlon teams. Good thing I
didn't forget my bathers!
That night I wasn't about to
drink with the flies, so Christoph
and I split a box of white plonk and
sat outside. "Fair Dinkum, mate
are those flying foxes?" The bloody
huge bats with a wingspan of more
than one meter circled over our
heads as we sat under the stars.
Soon enough we were off, after an
other tinny or two, trompin' along
to the Valley with roadies to find the
bangin' beats. I didn't give myself
away as a Yank by asking for a
pitcher of beer only jugs of
amber fluid for me!

Rummaging about was all good
fun, but I couldn't partake on the
final rite of passage of renting a vee
dub and driving through the Out
back. My mates carried all the
water, petrol and provisions needed
for the journey, which primarily
consisted of carrots bought at one
dollar per kilogram. I bade 'hooroo'
to my comrades and to Oz. But
she'll be apples, it's London to a
brick that I'll be back.

Johnny reckons there's a pot load of
Strine phrases he missed, and he'd be
stoked to hear your favourite. Email
