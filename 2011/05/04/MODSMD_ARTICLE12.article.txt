## PAC-12 GETS BIG TV DEAL 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
The Pac-12 is getting a whole lot richer.
The conference inked a new 12-year,
$3 billion television deal for football and
men's basketball on Tuesday morning
with the Fox and ESPN networks, accord
ing to Richard Sandomir of The New York
Times. The deal will kick in during the
2012-13 academic year, after the current

rights deal expires
and new confer
ence members
Colorado and II '
Utah are fully II I
integrated into l\ 1
the structure of yJ
the Pac-12 (the VL
conference is still \
the Pac-10, but will
begin being called the
Pac-12 in July).

As part of Pac-12
Commissioner Larry Scott's desire to
have every Pac-12 football and men's bas
ketball game televised, the conference
will also launch its own television net
work, and will be the sole owner of that
network. The Pac-12 cable network will
broadcast games not selected by ESPN or
Fox and will go on air for the first time in
2012. It will have its own online content
streaming channel, similar to ESPN's
ESPN3.

The deal with Fox and ESPN will pay
out approximately $250 million per year.
Unlike the Pac-10's current appearance
based method of disbursing revenue, the
funds from this rights deal will be evenly
split among the conference's 12 members.
Each school in the Pac-12 Arizona,
Arizona State, California, Colorado, Ore
gon, Oregon State, Stanford, UCLA,
USC, Utah, Washington and Washington
State will receive about $2l million
annually, a large increase from previous
years. The current TV deal pays out $6O
million annually, averaging out to $6 mil
lion per school for each year, and that
number varies based on the number of
times a given team appears on TV (an
agreement that has historically favored
the Southern California schools).
The contract also includes the Pac-12
championship game in football, which
will be held this December for the first
time. The game will pit the champions of
each of the conference's divisions against
each other, and will be played at the home
site of the team with the better record.
The television rights for the game will al
ternate between Fox and ABC (which,
along with ESPN, is a member of the Dis
ney family of networks.)
Scott will formally announce the deal
Wednesday morning at the Pac-12's

spring meetings in Phoenix.
The Pac-12's new television con
tracts outstrip those of the other
BCS automatic-qualifying confer
ences by a hefty margin. The At
lantic Coast Conference signed a
$155 million-per-year deal and the
Big-12 Conference will receive $l3O
million annually under its most re
cent agreement (though the Big 12
only has 10 programs). The Pac-12
even outdistanced the two largest
conferences, the Big Ten and South
eastern Conferences, which current
ly receive $220 million and $205 mil
lion respectively on an annual basis.
Stanford also announced that it
will switch radio responsibilities for
football and men's basketball. Start
ing next fall, Stanford games will be
broadcast on San Francisco's
KNBR-1050 AM, a move away
from the Cardinal's current
provider, XTRA Sports 860 AM.
Cardinal Sports LLC, the multime

dia and marketing partner for Stan
ford Athletics, did not disclose de
tails of the agreement. It was also
not disclosed whether Stanford's
student-run radio station, KZSU,

would retain rights to broadcast
football and men's basketball.
