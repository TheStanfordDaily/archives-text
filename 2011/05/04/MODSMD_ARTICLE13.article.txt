# MIDWEEK MASTERY
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
It's been the story of the Stanford baseball season so
far win one or two over the weekend, then take the
midweek game. With a 3-1 victory over the San Jose State
Spartans on Tuesday night, the Cardinal stuck to the script
it has followed all year.
Sophomore righthander Dean McArdle (6-2) kept the
Spartans' (30-17) bats quiet, giving up only three hits and
one unearned run over 5.1 innings, while Stanford batters
scattered six hits and capitalized on some mistakes from
the Spartans to grab the victory.
The Cardinal (21-16,6-9 Pac-10) got on the board first,
scoring in the fourth inning when senior catcher Zach
Jones came around on a sacrifice fly from freshman first
baseman Brian Ragira after Jones doubled to left.
Stanford also managed to squander a scoring opportu
nity later in the inning, falling short when sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger and freshman right fielder

GAME NOTES ! Stanford will look to improve on its mid
dling Pac-10 season when it hosts Pac-10 bottom feed
er Washington in a three-game series this weekend.
Stanford has played the nation's toughest schedule and
is only 6-9 in the Pac-10. Washington is having a diffi
cult season and sits in last place in the conference.


LAN GARCIA-DOTY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman first baseman Brian Ragira, above, had an RBI and a run in Stanford's 3-1 victory at San Jose
State yesterday. The Cardinal will try to climb the Pac-10 standings this weekend versus Washington.

Austin Wilson both walked to load
the bases with two outs before senior
designated hitter Ben Clowe struck
out swinging.
Ragira contributed to the scoring
again in the sixth inning, singling to
left, stealing second base, advancing
on a fielder's choice then scoring on a
wild pitch to make the score 2-0 in
Stanford's favor.
The Spartans wouldn't go down
without a fight, though, as they
showed signs of life in the bottom of
the sixth. McArdle was bounced from
the game after he gave up his only run
of the day, which came unearned after
Spartan runners reached base on a
single and an error to start the sixth.
The 5.1 innings marked McArdle's
best outing on the mound in over a
month, as he retired 11 straight bat
ters from the second to the fifth in
ning.
Freshman righty A.J. Vanegas
came in to relieve McArdle and al
lowed just one run on an RBI single
from Spartan right fielder Jason Mar
tin, which cut the lead to 2-1 through
six.
The Spartans couldn't muster any
more rallies off the Cardinal pitching
staff though, as Vanegas responded
with a shutdown inning in the bottom
half of the seventh after Stanford had
tacked on another run in the top of
the inning on an RBI single from
sophomore center fielder Tyler
Gaffney.
Vanegas then passed the ball to
Cardinal closer Chris Reed, and the
left-handed junior once again threw
down a dominant performance in the
last two innings, striking out four of
the seven batters he faced to snag his
fifth save of the year.
Other than extending the Cardi
nal's record to 10-1 in midweek
games this year (a factor that contin
ues to provide a huge boost to the
Card's postseason chances), the low
scoring win was important for Stan
ford because two players who had

straggled recently McArdle and
Wilson both had their best days at
the ballpark in quite some time.
McArdle got his first win since
April 3 and Wilson went 2-for-3 with a
walk. McArdle lost his spot as Stan
ford's Sunday starter and had given
up 11 runs over just 11.1 innings of
work in his last four appearances on
the mound. Wilson has been in and
out of the lineup while fighting his
propensity to whiff at the plate: Wil
son's strikeout total had ballooned to
lead the team and the Pac-10
before he was given a few days off.
The Cardinal returns home to face
another Pac-10 test this weekend,
hosting a three-game set against the
Washington Huskies at Sunken Dia
mond starting Friday night at 6 p.m.
