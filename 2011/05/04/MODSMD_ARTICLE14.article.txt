### Daniel Bohm 
If everything falls into place, the
Stanford tennis teams won't have to
leave campus in order to win national
titles this season. With the Taube Fam
ily Tennis Center already set to host the
last four rounds of the 2011 NCAA
Championships, both the men's and
women's tennis teams found out yes
terday that they will host first and sec
ond rounds matches here at Stanford.
The women's tennis team (23-0,8-0
Pac-10) received the No. 1 overall seed
in the tournament and will play Illi
nois-Chicago (18-4, 8-0 Horizon
League) in the first round on Saturday,
May 14. The winner of that match will
take on the winner of Pepperdine and
Long Beach State in the second round.
Staying on the Farm bodes well for
the Stanford women, who haven't lost
a home match since 1999. The Cardinal
ladies have won 179 consecutive
matches at home, including 32 in the
NCAA tournament, and are trying for
their 17th team title and second in a
row. Stanford took last year's team
NCAA Championship in a dramatic 4-
3 victory over Florida in Athens, Ga.
The Stanford men will also be at
home for the first two rounds after
earning the No. 8 national seed. The
Cardinal (18-5, 5-1 Pac-10) opens
against Army (13-11, 6-0 Patriot
League) on Friday, May 13.The winner
of the Stanford-Army match will take
on the winner of Cal Poly versus Wash
ington the following day.
The Stanford men have won 15
team national titles, but none since
2000. Virginia is the men's No. 1 overall
seed.
