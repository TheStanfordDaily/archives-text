# Women's soccer announces 2011 recruiting class
## 
### —Nate Adams 
After its second consecutive unde
feated regular season, Stanford should
be well-equipped to make another run
at a women's soccer title next year, as
the team announced yesterday an im
pressive class of freshmen that will be
joining the squad in the fall. The 2011
recruiting class brings six new players
to the Cardinal, including five players
with youth national team experience,
two state players of the year and two
Bay Area natives.
The class consists of forward Alex
Doll (Bethesda, Md.), midfielder Han
nah Farr (Hillsborough, Calif.), mid
fielder Lo'eau Laßonta (Rancho Cu
camonga, Calif.), midfielder Haley
Rosen (Rolling Hills, Calif.), defender
Lauren Schmidt (San Martin, Calif.)
and forward Chioma Übogagu (Cop
pell, Texas).
The class of 2015 will bolster a Stan
ford roster that, despite losing Her
mann Trophy winner Christen Press to
graduation, returns nine starters, in
cluding four All-Americans and eight
All-Pac-10 honorees.
Doll was named the Girls' High
School Scholar-Athlete of the Year
last season, when she posted 12
goals and 19 assists as she led
Bethesda-Chevy Chase High
School to its third consecutive state
title. As a forward the same posi
tion played by the departing Press
Doll should bring strong passing
ability and versatility on offense.
The sole two-sport athlete of the
class, Farr will also be playing
lacrosse on the Farm. She played a
key role bringing St. Ignatius Prep
of San Francisco to the 2011 Cen
tral Coast Section Division II final
with an 11-goal, three-assist season.
A midfielder, Farr has been praised
by Stanford head coach Paul Rat
cliffe for her "superb mentality" on
the field.
The other two midfielders in the
recruiting class, Laßonta and
Rosen, are also California natives.
Laßonta was named CIF Southern
Section's best offensive player after
notching 17 goals and 11 assists last
season, while Rosen scored a re
markable 22 goals and 17 assists in
her senior season at Palos Verdes
High.
Schmidt, the only defender in
Stanford's recruiting class, was the
team captain for Trinidad & Tobago
during the FIFA U-17 World Cup
last fall. She also helped a local club
team, the Mountain View-Los
Altos Avalanche, to the 2011 Cal-
North State Cup Championship.
Rounding out the class is Übo
gagu, ranked as the No. 3 recruit in
the nation by Top Drawer Soccer. A
member of the U.S. U-20 national
team, Übogagu holds a weighted
GPA of 4.975 and is the reigning
Gatorade Texas Player of the Year.
Known for her quick acceleration
and explosive offense, she is a four

time Dallas Morning News first
team All-American.
Stanford's recent crop of re
cruits' first chance for collegiate ac
tion will be when the Cardinal

opens its 2011 season versus Penn
State on Aug. 19 at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.
