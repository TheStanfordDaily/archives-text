# CARD SEASON COMES TO AN END
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
With a top-10 national ranking, a 19-8
regular season record that tied for the pro
gram's most wins since 1998 and a sweep of
the No. 3 team in the country, the men's vol
leyball team could have seen this season as
a huge success. But it was hard not to feel a
little disappointed when the Cardinal
walked off the Maples Pavilion floor after a
bitter fifth-set loss to No. 5 Long Beach two
weekends ago in the first round of the
MPSF Tournament.
The loss ostensibly ended Stanford's
postseason hopes because only one at-large
bid is available for the four-team NCAA
Tournament, and it was unlikely that the
Cardinal (19-9, 15-7 MPSF) was going to
snag it after being upset on its home court in
the first round of the MPSF Tournament.
(No. 1 USC ended up losing to No. 3 UC-
Santa Barbara in the MPSF Final, and was
awarded the at-large bid.)
Although there was certainly no shame
in losing to a plucky Long Beach State
squad (15-14, 12-10) that seemingly had
Stanford's number all season long the
49ers swept all three meetings in 2011
there were certainly bitter feelings consid
ering how close the Cardinal came to find
ing that elusive spark.
Head coach John Kosty said all season
that any team looking to win a national
championship required a solid end to the
regular season, and then needed to get hot
in the playoffs. He attributed last year's na
tional championship to a magical run at the
perfect time. This season, Stanford was its
hottest just before spring break, when it
won five straight matches, possibly peaking
too soon.
Last year when the Cardinal actually
managed to complete the daunting holy

grail of MPSF play by winning the regular
season title, MPSF Tournament title and the
national title Stanford had a couple of
three-game win streaks towards the end of
conference play that demonstrated how
well the team was playing. This year, after
the five-match win streak, the team never
found a groove and alternated wins and
losses in seven straight matches before a
small two-match streak entering the MPSF
Tournament.
It's impossible to point to any of the play
ers individually, because the statistics speak
for themselves. Junior outside hitter Brad
Lawson and junior libero Erik Shoji repeat
ed as AVC A First Team All-Americans, with
both racking up some impressive statistics:
Lawson posted 455 kills to go with a .331 hit
ting percentage, and Shoji had 2.62 digs per
set.
Junior setter Evan Barry had gigantic
shoes to fill with the graduation of AVCA
Player of the Year and First Team All-
American setter Kawika Shoji, Erik's older
brother. But Barry did exactly as Kosty pre
dicted when he handed him the keys to the
Cardinal offense, setting a very efficient
game to the tune of 1272 assists and the
third-highest assist-to-set ratio in the con
ference.
The vaunted freshman class that Kosty
brought in also contributed immediately
outside hitter Brian Cook was third on the
team in kills with 179 and Steven Irvin
played in almost every match and was sixth
in kills. That doesn't even include freshman
middle blocker Eric Mochalski, who fin
ished as one of just five Cardinal players to
appear in all 28 matches, starting 27 of them.
Mochalski was fourth on the team in kills
and had a .451 hitting percentage while
leading the team in total blocks.

Freshman Eric Mochalski, above center, had a strong first season for Stanford. Mochalski and
other youngsters will be looked upon to play larger roles in the 2011-2012 season.
