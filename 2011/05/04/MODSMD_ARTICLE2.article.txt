## STUDENT GOV'T ASSU addresses NomCom, Pub Board 13th Senate discusses new legislation in first meeting 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate settled
into office yesterday. At its first full
length meeting Tuesday night, it con
firmed the membership of Senate com
mittees, passed funding bills and dis
cussed two separate pieces of legislation
one that would create paid consultant
positions on the ASSU Publications
Board (Pub Board) and another that
would establish the office of ASSU Par
liamentarian.
The Senate also had its first disagree
ment over the purchase of balloons.
At the beginning of the meeting, the
Senate passed a bill that confirmed the
assignment of senators to its five differ
ent committees. The structure of these

committees differs slightly from previ
ous years. The Senate has eliminated the
Communications Committee and split
the Student Life, Housing and Educa
tion Committee in two. The latter's re
sponsibilities will now be divided be
tween the newly formed Academic Af
fairs Committee and Health, Wellness,
Housing and Dining Committee.
Senate Chair Rafael Vasquez 'l2
asked ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
to create these new committees.
"We would like to see how these com
mittees work this year instead of chang
ing the bylaws," Vasquez said.
The Senate also confirmed the Nomi
nation Committee's appointments to
University committees. Prior to the
votes, Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 asked if
there were any conflicts of interest since
one of the nominees, Deepa Kannappan
'l3, also serves on the Constitutional
Council.
Cruz said it was not against the ASSU

governing documents for members to
serve concurrently on University com
mittees. The Senate unanimously ap
proved the nominees afterward.
The conversation then turned toward
funding bills, with five different student
organizations presenting requests for fi
nancial support. Since the Appropria
tions Committee has not had any official
meetings yet, the Senators decided to go
through each request line-by-line.
A request from the Stanford Israel
Alliance, which included $5OO to buy two
balloon arches for an event to celebrate
Israel Independence Day, sparked a dis
cussion among the Senators.
"I think two arches of balloons would
be awesome, but I'm not sure if that's the
best way of spending student money,"
said Senator Ben Laufer 'l2. "I think
everything else is really awesome, but
I'm not sure if that's going to add to the
