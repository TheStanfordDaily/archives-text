# Economist editor speaks on the Farm
## John Micklethwait reveals his 'paranoid optimism' SPEAKERS & EVENTS 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of the Econo
mist, spoke Tuesday afternoon at the Bechtel Conference
Center to a packed crowd of Stanford scholars, students
and community members. The Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies and the Europe Center spon
sored the talk, which was a part of the Payne Distin
guished Lectureship series.
Micklethwait began with a quote from economist
Herbert Stein, stating, "If something cannot go on forev
er, it will stop."
He framed his speech by applying this idea to five
major topics: the world economy, China, the euro, rising
inequality and the size of governments.
The lecture was very timely, as Micklethwait men
tioned Osama bin Laden's death several times, and said
the recent political turmoil in the Middle East was "a re
freshing reminder of how quickly the world can change."
Micklethwait described himself as a "paranoid opti
mist." A mix of this paranoia, optimism and at times
humor characterized his talk. The longtime editor
drew laughter early from the crowd when he said, "Jour
nalists are the prostitutes of the political world."
Micklethwait spoke at length about India and China,
the latter of which he called "fragile."
"Asia is a cockpit of competing rivalries," he said.
Moving on to the European Union, Micklethwait dis
cussed his pessimism about the strength of the euro.
While he doubted that the euro zone would fall apart, he
observed that "the current rescue plan for those curren
cies in trouble is unstable,"
He blamed the leadership of the European Union,
which he referred to as "a dysfunctional quartet" and
said he believes Germany is the only country that could
leave the union without enduring severe economic costs.
"It's a currency union that is almost self-starting to
wards disaster," Micklethwait said. "Some kind of re
structuring has to happen. Plan A has failed."
He then discussed income inequality, specifically in
America.
"America used to be a place with infinite tolerance for
inequality and capitalism," Micklethwait said. "Now, I'm
not so sure,"
He also predicted an imminent battle between the
government and public sector unions, starting with pen
sions. He further remarked that "governments have be
come too large and cumbersome and need modernizing."
He said the two places that really matter in this glob
al debate are California and Britain. Speaking about Cal
ifornia, Micklethwait said "in no place in the world is
there such a gap between the sophistication in the private
sector and the dysfunction in the public sector" than in
this state.
Micklethwait closed his talk, to laughter once again,
by telling the crowd, "Donald
Trump. He cannot go on forever."
Micklethwait was named Edi
tors' Editor of the Year 2010. After
studying history at Magdalen Col
lege, Oxford, he worked as a
banker at Chase Manhattan from
1985 to 1987 before joining the
Economist as a finance correspon
dent in 1987. Since then, his roles
at the Economist have included
setting up the publication's Los
Angeles bureau, serving as its
media correspondent, editing the
business section, running the New
York bureau and editing the Unit
ed States section.
Micklethwait has visited Stan
ford so many times he has lost
count.
"I like coming to Stanford for
two reasons: one is because it's a
front-ranking university full of
ideas," Micklethwait said in an in
terview with The Daily. "On top of
that you've got that particular rela

tionship between Stanford and Sil
icon Valley, so you're always in
trigued."
Reaction from students who at
tended the talk was overwhelm
ingly positive.
"I liked the way he structured
the talk in terms of things that
can't go on," said Justin Costa-
Roberts 'll.
"I'm an Economist subscriber
and think highly of the publica
tion," said Bill Rowan 'll. "Being a
reader, you're obviously interest
ed in the things he talked about
today."
After the event officially
ended, Micklethwait stayed to
speak with audience members
one-on-one.
"I think, if you want the honest
truth, out of all the people in Amer
ica who need my help and advice I
expect Stanford graduates are the
least," he said. "But I think, keep
trying to do what you want to do."
