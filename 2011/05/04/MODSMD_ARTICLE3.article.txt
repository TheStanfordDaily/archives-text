# Economist editor speaks on the Farm
## John Micklethwait reveals his 'paranoid optimism' SPEAKERS & EVENTS 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of the Econo
mist, spoke Tuesday afternoon at the Bechtel Conference
Center to a packed crowd of Stanford scholars, students
and community members. The Freeman Spogli Institute
for International Studies and the Europe Center spon
sored the talk, which was a part of the Payne Distin
guished Lectureship series.
Micklethwait began with a quote from economist
Herbert Stein, stating, "If something cannot go on forev
er, it will stop."
He framed his speech by applying this idea to five
major topics: the world economy, China, the euro, rising
inequality and the size of governments.
The lecture was very timely, as Micklethwait men
tioned Osama bin Laden's death several times, and said
the recent political turmoil in the Middle East was "a re
freshing reminder of how quickly the world can change."
Micklethwait described himself as a "paranoid opti
mist." A mix of this paranoia, optimism and at times
humor characterized his talk. The longtime editor
drew laughter early from the crowd when he said, "Jour
nalists are the prostitutes of the political world."
Micklethwait spoke at length about India and China,
the latter of which he called "fragile."
"Asia is a cockpit of competing rivalries," he said.
Moving on to the European Union, Micklethwait dis
cussed his pessimism about the strength of the euro.
While he doubted that the euro zone would fall apart, he
observed that "the current rescue plan for those curren
cies in trouble is unstable,"
He blamed the leadership of the European Union,
which he referred to as "a dysfunctional quartet" and
said he believes Germany is the only country that could
leave the union without enduring severe economic costs.
"It's a currency union that is almost self-starting to
wards disaster," Micklethwait said. "Some kind of re
structuring has to happen. Plan A has failed."
He then discussed income inequality, specifically in
America.
"America used to be a place with infinite tolerance for
inequality and capitalism," Micklethwait said. "Now, I'm
not so sure,"
He also predicted an imminent battle between the
government and public sector unions, starting with pen
sions. He further remarked that "governments have be
come too large and cumbersome and need modernizing."
He said the two places that really matter in this glob
al debate are California and Britain. Speaking about Cal
ifornia, Micklethwait said "in no place in the world is
there such a gap between the sophistication in the private
sector and the dysfunction in the public sector" than in
this state.
Micklethwait closed his talk, to laughter once again,
