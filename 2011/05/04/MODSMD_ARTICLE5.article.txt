# Panel debates solutions to Washington debt battle
## 
### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
Tuesday night's panel on the current budget
battle in Washington brought together political
journalists and Stanford faculty at Cubberley
Auditorium to discuss the merits of the Ryan
and Obama budget plans, as well as the chal
lenges in coming to a bipartisan solution to the
growing deficit.
The event featured speakers David Leon
hardt, economics correspondent for The New
York Times and 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner; John
Harris, editor in chief of Politico; Susan Davis,
congressional correspondent for the National
Journal and David Brady, professor of Political
Science and senior Hoover fellow. James
Fishkin, chair of the Department of Communi
cations, moderated the discussion.
Leonhardt opened the panel by praising the
Ryan budget plan. The plan proposes greater
cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary
domestic spending as well as a lower top tax rate
than does the Obama plan.
"The Ryan budget is a reason for optimism,"
he said. "It is more arithmetically honest than
anything the Republican Party has done in the
last years."
