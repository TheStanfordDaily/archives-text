# Panel debates solutions to Washington debt battle
## 
### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
Tuesday night's panel on the current budget
battle in Washington brought together political
journalists and Stanford faculty at Cubberley
Auditorium to discuss the merits of the Ryan
and Obama budget plans, as well as the chal
lenges in coming to a bipartisan solution to the
growing deficit.
The event featured speakers David Leon
hardt, economics correspondent for The New
York Times and 2011 Pulitzer Prize winner; John
Harris, editor in chief of Politico; Susan Davis,
congressional correspondent for the National
Journal and David Brady, professor of Political
Science and senior Hoover fellow. James
Fishkin, chair of the Department of Communi
cations, moderated the discussion.
Leonhardt opened the panel by praising the
Ryan budget plan. The plan proposes greater
cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary
domestic spending as well as a lower top tax rate
than does the Obama plan.
"The Ryan budget is a reason for optimism,"
he said. "It is more arithmetically honest than
anything the Republican Party has done in the
last years."

David Leonhardt, economics correspondent for The New York Times, and Susan Davis, congressional
correspondent for the National Journal, weigh in on the U.S. national debt in Cubberly Auditorium.
Davis echoed Leonhardt, com
mending the Republicans for "the
refreshing amount of candor" in
their budget proposal.
Even so, Democrats and Repub
licans have not yet managed to
reach a compromise to cut the fed
eral debt, which is fast approaching
the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.
The problem, Leonhardt contin
ued, is not the gap between the two
parties but that the voters do not
want the deficits solved.
"Is the American public dumb?"
Brady said. "You can't have every
thing. And yet, two-thirds of the
time, Americans want a balanced
budget, increased expenditures and
lower taxes."
"Well, we can't have that," he
said.
In addition to this, Davis said the
Ryan budget plan is incredibly po
litically risky. Medicare is one of the
most beloved entitlement pro
grams in the country. Cutting
Medicare will target senior citizens,
who, according to Davis, are some
of the most politically aware voters
in the country.
Harris noted that Democrats
have little incentive to bargain. It
might become "irresistible" for
President Barack Obama to take
advantage of the opening present
ed by the Ryan plan; Obama could
present himself as a defender of tra
ditional social programs and as a
candidate of not only young voters
but old voters, too.
According to Davis' most recent
polling data, the public is almost
evenly divided between Obama's
and Ryan's deficit reduction plans.
Davis offered advice to those
audience members who might be
undecided about these two plans.
"I think that the key is to con
sume as much news as you can," she
said. "There's nothing you should
n't read. In a world where the media
is simply more polarized, we need
to be a little more discerning and
read things that don't necessarily fit
in our ideological world."
Brady took a step back to offer a
global perspective on the $14.3 tril
lion debt.
"This is not an American prob
lem," he said. "Every democracy
has this problem and no democracy
has dealt successfully with this
problem."

Leonhardt and Davis made sure
to end the discussion on a more
hopeful note.
"We certainly can solve the
[deficit] problem," Leonhardt said.
"There is a lot of room for posi
tivity," Davis added.
