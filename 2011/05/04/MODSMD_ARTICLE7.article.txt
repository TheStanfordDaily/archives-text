The archers line up and
shoot their arrows into
the air. Some land on the
stretch of grass surround
ing the targets, others on
the white, black, blue, red or yellow
circles. After a few more attempts,
the members of the Stanford
archery team walk over to collect
their arrows.
One archer. Matt Cooper 'l4,
follows a rope tied between his
stand emblazoned with "Com
petitive Archery sees no limits"
and the target. He collects his ar
rows, stows them in his belt and fol
lows the rope back to his stand,
where he positions his feet between
two markers on the grass, a modifi
cation made to suit archery equip
ment to the needs of the visually im
paired.
Cooper is the first blind member
of Stanford's archery team. With
training and equipment from
Courtney and Janice Walth, a cou
ple from Lodi, Calif, who specialize
in visually impaired archery, he has
been practicing the sport since early
this school year.
"He's very self-driven," said
Stanford archery coach Francis Par
chaso. "He approached me wanting
to join the team."
Cooper uses the same equip
ment as sighted archers, with the ex
ception of the foot markers to ori
ent him in the correct direction.
There are also differences in the dis
tance of the targets for visually im
paired archers. The technique, how

ever, is very much the same.
"It's about repetitive motion,
learning how to do the same thing
over and over again," Parchaso
said. "In a sense what he does is
more forgiving because he's less
likely to ... second-guess himself."
Second-guessing himself doesn't
seem to be a problem for the enter
prising freshman. He has already
declared his major Science,
Technology and Society (STS) —,
impressed his dorm mates with his
skills at table tennis and pool and
has a personal recording studio in
his room in Freshman-Sophomore
College (FroSoCo).
A self-described music lover,
Cooper enjoys mixing new songs on
a program called Cakewalk Sonar
and then playing his music on mas
sive speakers in his room. Though
he usually relies on the electronic
sounds pre-recorded on the soft
ware, he recently recorded a song
with friends, in which each person
created different sounds that he
mixed together.
Just as he has found ways to
adapt archery and music recording
to his advantage, he has created a
"seamless modus operandi" for his
coursework, according to Robert
McGinn, professor of STS and
Management Science and Engi
neering (MS&E).
All of Cooper's textbooks are
translated into Braille for him and
he has a printer in his room that
converts texts to Braille. His com
puter reads text back to him and he
uses a device called a Braille Note
with a Braille keyboard that he uses
to take notes and write papers. Pro
fessors send his exams to the Office
of Accessible Education (OAE),
where they are converted into
Braille. According to the OAE, ap
proximately 19 of the 938 under
graduates registered with the OAE
are visually impaired.
"Matt is a case in point for the
influence of technology and science
on society, but it's not as if it's only

the technology," McGinn said. "It's
the technology working in conjunc
tion with the personality and drive
of the individual."
Cooper has a guide dog named
Loti who responds to commands only
in French, by nature of the fact that
she was trained in Quebec. Cooper
was 11 when he got Loti. However,
most guide dog schools only provide
the animals to people over 18.
Cooper's independence stands
out to his professors, coaches and
teammates.
"It's really impressive what he's
doing," said Eric Feldman 'l2, a

member of the archery team. "It's
just an inspiration to shoot around
him."
McGinn echoed Feldman's
praise.
"One has to admire an individ
ual like Matt who is doing so well in
his academic coursework and has
an incredible will and determina
tion, as well as intellect," he said.
But Cooper is quick to share the
credit for his success, describing his
contribution to blazing a new trail
in archery as one "where we're all
paving the way together."
"It's a group effort," he added.

Cooper's humility doesn't sur
prise Emily Palmer, one of his high
school classmates.
"Matt has an incredible sense of
empathy," she said. "He doesn't put
himself above other people. In high
school, we were all blown away by
his accomplishments . . . but he
wasn't self-centered."
"He'd point out other people's
strengths," she added.
Cooper is preparing to compete
in three archery tournaments this
summer in Sacramento in a division
for the visually impaired. Courtney
Walsh has high hopes for his per

formance.
"If Matt keeps it up, he could go
to World's [World Archery Cham
pionship] in the next three to four
years," Walsh projected.
For his own part, Cooper shrugs
at the praise he's received.
"Everybody else says,'lt's amaz
ing; it's great.' And I say, 'You know
what? It's life,'" he said. "What else
am I going to do? It's blaze a trail or
sit in my dorm room all day."

All of Cooper's textbooks are
translated into Braille for him and
he has a printer in his room that
converts texts to Braille. His com
puter reads text back to him and he
uses a device called a Braille Note
with a Braille keyboard that he uses
to take notes and write papers. Pro
fessors send his exams to the Office
of Accessible Education (OAE),
where they are converted into
Braille. According to the OAE, ap
proximately 19 of the 938 under
graduates registered with the OAE
are visually impaired.
"Matt is a case in point for the
influence of technology and science
on society, but it's not as if it's only

the technology," McGinn said. "It's
the technology working in conjunc
tion with the personality and drive
of the individual."
Cooper has a guide dog named
Loti who responds to commands only
in French, by nature of the fact that
she was trained in Quebec. Cooper
was 11 when he got Loti. However,
most guide dog schools only provide
the animals to people over 18.
Cooper's independence stands
out to his professors, coaches and
teammates.
"It's really impressive what he's
doing," said Eric Feldman 'l2, a

member of the archery team. "It's
just an inspiration to shoot around
him."
McGinn echoed Feldman's
praise.
"One has to admire an individ
ual like Matt who is doing so well in
his academic coursework and has
an incredible will and determina
tion, as well as intellect," he said.
But Cooper is quick to share the
credit for his success, describing his
contribution to blazing a new trail
in archery as one "where we're all
paving the way together."
"It's a group effort," he added.

Cooper's humility doesn't sur
prise Emily Palmer, one of his high
school classmates.
"Matt has an incredible sense of
empathy," she said. "He doesn't put
himself above other people. In high
school, we were all blown away by
his accomplishments . . . but he
wasn't self-centered."
"He'd point out other people's
strengths," she added.
Cooper is preparing to compete
in three archery tournaments this
summer in Sacramento in a division
for the visually impaired. Courtney
Walsh has high hopes for his per

formance.
"If Matt keeps it up, he could go
to World's [World Archery Cham
pionship] in the next three to four
years," Walsh projected.
For his own part, Cooper shrugs
at the praise he's received.
"Everybody else says,'lt's amaz
ing; it's great.' And I say, 'You know
what? It's life,'" he said. "What else
am I going to do? It's blaze a trail or
sit in my dorm room all day."

Matt Cooper (second row, far right) is the first blind member of Stanford's archery team. Thanks to funds from Courtney and Janice Walth, a couple who
specialize in visually impaired archery, Cooper has enthusiastically taken up the sport this year.
The archers line up and
shoot their arrows into
the air. Some land on the
stretch of grass surround
ing the targets, others on
the white, black, blue, red or yellow
circles. After a few more attempts,
the members of the Stanford
archery team walk over to collect
their arrows.
One archer. Matt Cooper 'l4,
follows a rope tied between his
stand emblazoned with "Com
petitive Archery sees no limits"
and the target. He collects his ar
rows, stows them in his belt and fol
lows the rope back to his stand,
where he positions his feet between
two markers on the grass, a modifi
cation made to suit archery equip
ment to the needs of the visually im
paired.
Cooper is the first blind member
of Stanford's archery team. With
training and equipment from
Courtney and Janice Walth, a cou
ple from Lodi, Calif, who specialize
in visually impaired archery, he has
been practicing the sport since early
this school year.
"He's very self-driven," said
Stanford archery coach Francis Par
chaso. "He approached me wanting
to join the team."
Cooper uses the same equip
ment as sighted archers, with the ex
ception of the foot markers to ori
ent him in the correct direction.
There are also differences in the dis
tance of the targets for visually im
paired archers. The technique, how

ever, is very much the same.
"It's about repetitive motion,
learning how to do the same thing
over and over again," Parchaso
said. "In a sense what he does is
more forgiving because he's less
likely to ... second-guess himself."
Second-guessing himself doesn't
seem to be a problem for the enter
prising freshman. He has already
declared his major Science,
Technology and Society (STS) —,
impressed his dorm mates with his
skills at table tennis and pool and
has a personal recording studio in
his room in Freshman-Sophomore
College (FroSoCo).
A self-described music lover,
Cooper enjoys mixing new songs on
a program called Cakewalk Sonar
and then playing his music on mas
sive speakers in his room. Though
he usually relies on the electronic
sounds pre-recorded on the soft
ware, he recently recorded a song
with friends, in which each person
created different sounds that he
mixed together.
Just as he has found ways to
adapt archery and music recording
to his advantage, he has created a
"seamless modus operandi" for his
coursework, according to Robert
McGinn, professor of STS and
Management Science and Engi
neering (MS&E).
