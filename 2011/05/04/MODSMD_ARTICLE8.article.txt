## EDITORIAL Nepotism on the Row 
### 
Every year, current row staffs
go through the process of se
lecting the people to take
their places and lead the row com
munity for the following year. Un
doubtedly, many of these new staff
members are familiar to the houses
in which they will work by serving
as previous staff members, resi
dents or at least friends.
Living in a row house is known
to be an advantage when going
through the process of applying to
staff. Because of this, some people
choose to draw tier one junior year,
with the hope and expectation that
it will help them be able to staff in a
row house senior year. Those who
are able to staff junior year are al
most guaranteed a position the fol
lowing year, and seniors who staff
also have a good chance of being
selected RA if they choose to re
turn as a co-term.
The experience gained by being
on staff is obviously valuable when
reapplying, but even having been a
resident has its benefits. People
who have lived in a house know
about the house's traditions and
events, as well as the issues that can
arise in a particular house. In addi
tion, someone valuing the commu
nity of a house enough to want to
be on staff is only a good sign for his
or her future dedication to the role.
Another advantage in the appli
cation process is simple friendship
with current staff members. It is
usually a good thing for the staff
members to personally know appli
cants in order to have more confi
dence in applicants' abilities than
just a good application and inter
view could provide. This can also
work to an applicant's disadvan
tage if the staff members are aware
that the person has a history of irre
sponsible behavior, despite a good
interview.
Although familiarity with the
house and with staff members can
be valuable in the row staff applica
tion process, in too many cases
friendships and history take prece
dence over ability and competence,
leading to ineffective staffs. Row
staffs play an incredibly important
role at Stanford; they are responsi
ble for the building communities
and maintaining the health and
safety of their residents. If they are
not up to par, it can significantly tar
nish the experiences of the students
for whom they are responsible.
This year, Residential Educa-

tion took a step towards lessening
the power of nepotism by institut
ing a first round interview for Res
ident Assistant applications with
an employee of ResEd and, in
some interviews, a current RA.
These interviews only provided
recommendations to the staffs and
were in no way binding; a staff is
free to choose a candidate who re
ceived low marks from the initial
interview. While the movement to
ward some sort of screening of ap
plicants is good, row staffs know
more about who can fill their roles
and handle the specific issues that
arise in their houses.
We recommend having a first
round interview held by staff
pooled from various houses for all
row applicants. Applicants would
have to be approved through this
process before being considered
by individual houses. This would
prevent people from obtaining
staff positions through pure nepo
tism, while leaving the evaluations
of applicants in the hands of cur
rent staffs. However, it is impor
tant that each house staff have the
final say on the selections for their
houses' new staffs, as each house
has its own unique issues, follow
ing from its history, location, archi
tecture, etc.
The row is an important and
unique part of our university and
community and it is essential that
its leaders are responsible, compe
tent and dedicated to maintaining a
fun, exciting and healthy culture for
all their residents.
