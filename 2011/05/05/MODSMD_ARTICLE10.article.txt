# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Dear Editor,
I'm writing in response to the op
ed, "A Thumb on the Scale of Jus
tice" that appeared in The Daily on
Friday, April 29 As Dean of Student
Life, I oversee the Office of Judicial
Affairs and helped to develop the
Alternate Review Process (ARP).
The ARP is a pilot process in which
faculty, staff and students review
complaints of sexual violence. The
training to which Mike Armstrong
and Daniel Barton refer prepares
these reviewers to hear cases in the
ARP. We regularly seek feedback
about the content and presentation
from the reviewers and incorporate
their suggestions into subsequent
trainings. We also seek feedback
from the students who go through
the process in an effort to continual
ly make improvements.

Based on the training materials
mentioned in the op-ed, I believe
the authors may have old training
information. Having said that, we
will revisit our training. Ultimately,
I want all students in the process,
both student complainants and re
sponding students, to feel they have
been treated fairly and respectfully.
We are committed to doing the
right thing and being transparent
about the process.To that end, I wel
come Mike Armstrong and Daniel
Barton to communicate with me di
rectly regarding any future con
cerns about the process or about the
experience of students they may be
representing in the process.
