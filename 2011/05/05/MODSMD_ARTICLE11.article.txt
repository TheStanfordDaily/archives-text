# SEEING GREEN
## Buzzkill 
### Holly Moeller 
As a teaching assistant for the
pilot section of Bio 44Y, I
spend Wednesday after
noons accompanying 10 students of
field ecology to Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Only five miles from
the main quad, we've battled rat
tlesnakes and squeezed past poison
oak but the nearest I've come to
disaster was almost letting a wasp fly
into our class van.
When we're worried about being
stung (knock on wood, I've so far
evaded the experience), we tend to
see bees and wasps as the flying
enemy, rather than as pollinators,
critical to the reproductive life of
most of the world's flowering plants.
Of course, the value of pollination
isn't lost on farmers or beekeepers:
the former pay the latter to haul
hivef uls of bees from crop field to or
chard every spring.
The inhabitants of these hives are
European honeybees, first imported
to the Americas in 1607. Today,
about three million colonies are kept
in wooden hives across the United
States; half visit California every
April to pollinate $2-billion-worth of
almonds before heading north and
west to Washington orchards or
Montana honey farms. On the East
Coast, bees are trucked from Florida
orange groves to Maine blueberry
patches every year. The USDA esti
mates that this pollination adds $l5
billion in value to U.S. crops each
year. And countless backyard gar
deners and small-scale farmers reap
similar benefits from local, wild
hives.
Up at Jasper Ridge or here on
main campus, bees operate with
great focus and intensity. It's hard to
imagine anything interfering with
their nectar-gathering mission. But
bees get sick, too.Tracheal mites clog
bee airways; fungal infections starve
bee larvae. Every winter, beekeepers
anticipate a loss of 15 percent of their
healthy hives.
Suddenly, in 2006, mortality
spiked. Beekeepers who'd moved
their hives to Florida's sunnier
climes to overwinter returned to find
30-90 percent of their hives aban
doned: a queen and her immature
brood might remain, but all the adult
workers were gone. These workers
were nowhere to be found, and with
out them, the hives starved.
Over subsequent years, hive mor
tality has hovered near 33 percent
double the normal rate and scien
tists have christened the mysterious
disappearing act "Colony Collapse
Disorder," or CCD.

Five years after CCD was first re
ported, its causes remain mysterious.
Recent molecular analyses impli
cate the Varroa mite-borne Israeli
acute paralysis virus, which is highly
correlated with CCD. But other re
search highlights the combined at
tack of a fungus, Nosema ceranae,
and virus, Iridoviridae. Alternate hy
potheses include pesticide toxicity,
combinations of all of the above and
(totally unsupported by science) cell
phone interference.
The jury's still out on the causes
of CCD, but beekeepers have appar
ently been quick to respond. Al
though the number of kept hives has
been falling for decades, there's been
no change in the rate of decline at
tributable to CCD. Nor have the
prices of apples, pears or almonds
spiked at least no more than can
be explained by inflation and rising
transportation (i.e. fuel) costs. So far,
bees are still doing their jobs, and
beekeepers are managing to replace
hives lost to CCD by splitting exist
ing hives or purchasing new colonies
from queen breeders.
Despite the lack of acute eco
nomic consequences, scientists and
beekeepers are deeply alarmed.
Such dramatic mortality, even if not
immediately devastating, highlights
the vulnerability of our agricultural
and economic systems. For example,
colonies trucked up and down the
country each year experience
unique transportation stresses. And,
just as businessmen on planes carry
contagious diseases across oceans,
bee colonies moved thousands of
miles between pollination customers
can quickly circulate new diseases
throughout the beekeeper commu
nity.
Our globalized world comes with
a huge suite of immediate benefits:
production efficiency, exchange of
ideas, expert specialization. But each
of these benefits is also a cost to
the stability and resilience of our
lifestyles. If Colony Collapse Disor
der were twice as devastating and
pollinators-for-hire couldn't meet
demand, our native pollinators
couldn't shoulder the load. If our
transit system failed. New Yorkers
would go hungry and Californians
would go thirsty.
Our high-tech lifestyles necessi
tate highly specific training: I strug
gle to talk to my students about their
sociology courses and it's even easy
for me to get out of my scientific
depth. This works fine if we can al
ways phone-a-friend with particular
expertise. But the less we know

about something, the less likely we
are to know who to call and, eventu
ally, the less we respect the subject
matter compared to our own special
ty. (For example, my stinger-cen
tered feelings about the wasp hover
ing by the van door, compared to
newfound respect after reading up
on pollinator biology for this col
umn.)
Of course, it's impossible to hold
all the world's knowledge in a single
mind. So the trick is learning how to
respect things we don't understand,
while still being able to recognize
misdirection. In other words, we
need to be specialized enough to do
our jobs, but broadly educated
enough to recognize the difference
between being (as my Dad would
say) blinded by brilliance or baffled
with BS.
We must be the beekeeper who
knows how to compensate for his
losses, the biologist who knows
which diseases to look for, the bio
chemist who knows how to screen
for them or, most importantly, the
missing link that brings all these
pieces together.

Suddenly, in 2006, mortality
spiked. Beekeepers who'd moved
their hives to Florida's sunnier
climes to overwinter returned to find
30-90 percent of their hives aban

brood might remain, but all the adult
workers were gone. These workers
were nowhere to be found, and with

of CCD, but beekeepers have appar

though the number of kept hives has
been falling for decades, there's been
no change in the rate of decline at

prices of apples, pears or almonds
spiked at least no more than can
be explained by inflation and rising
transportation (i.e. fuel) costs. So far,
bees are still doing their jobs, and
beekeepers are managing to replace
hives lost to CCD by splitting exist
ing hives or purchasing new colonies
from queen breeders.
Despite the lack of acute eco
nomic consequences, scientists and
beekeepers are deeply alarmed.
Such dramatic mortality, even if not
immediately devastating, highlights
the vulnerability of our agricultural
and economic systems. For example,
colonies trucked up and down the
country each year experience
unique transportation stresses. And,
just as businessmen on planes carry
contagious diseases across oceans,
bee colonies moved thousands of
miles between pollination customers
can quickly circulate new diseases
throughout the beekeeper commu

Our globalized world comes with
a huge suite of immediate benefits:
production efficiency, exchange of
ideas, expert specialization. But each
of these benefits is also a cost to
the stability and resilience of our
lifestyles. If Colony Collapse Disor

pollinators-for-hire couldn't meet
demand, our native pollinators
couldn't shoulder the load. If our
transit system failed. New Yorkers
would go hungry and Californians
would go thirsty.
Our high-tech lifestyles necessi

sociology courses and it's even easy
for me to get out of my scientific
depth. This works fine if we can al
ways phone-a-friend with particular
expertise. But the less we know

about something, the less likely we
are to know who to call and, eventu
ally, the less we respect the subject
matter compared to our own special
ty. (For example, my stinger-cen

newfound respect after reading up
on pollinator biology for this col

Of course, it's impossible to hold
all the world's knowledge in a single
mind. So the trick is learning how to
respect things we don't understand,
while still being able to recognize
misdirection. In other words, we
need to be specialized enough to do
our jobs, but broadly educated
enough to recognize the difference
between being (as my Dad would
say) blinded by brilliance or baffled
with BS.
We must be the beekeeper who
knows how to compensate for his
losses, the biologist who knows
which diseases to look for, the bio
chemist who knows how to screen
for them or, most importantly, the
missing link that brings all these
pieces together.

The trick is learning
how to respect things
we don t understand,
while still being able
to recognize
misdirection.

As a teaching assistant for the
pilot section of Bio 44Y, I
spend Wednesday after
noons accompanying 10 students of
field ecology to Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Only five miles from
the main quad, we've battled rat
tlesnakes and squeezed past poison
oak but the nearest I've come to
disaster was almost letting a wasp fly
into our class van.
When we're worried about being
stung (knock on wood, I've so far
evaded the experience), we tend to
see bees and wasps as the flying
enemy, rather than as pollinators,
critical to the reproductive life of
most of the world's flowering plants.
Of course, the value of pollination
isn't lost on farmers or beekeepers:
the former pay the latter to haul
hivef uls of bees from crop field to or
chard every spring.
The inhabitants of these hives are
European honeybees, first imported
to the Americas in 1607. Today,
about three million colonies are kept
in wooden hives across the United
States; half visit California every
April to pollinate $2-billion-worth of
almonds before heading north and
west to Washington orchards or
Montana honey farms. On the East
Coast, bees are trucked from Florida
orange groves to Maine blueberry
patches every year. The USDA esti
mates that this pollination adds $l5
billion in value to U.S. crops each
year. And countless backyard gar
deners and small-scale farmers reap
