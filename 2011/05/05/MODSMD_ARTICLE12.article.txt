## Reflections on the ROTC debate and decision 
### JOHN ETCHEMENDY Stanford Provost 
Last Thursday, the Faculty Sen
ate passed a motion recom
mending that President Hen
nessy initiate discussions with the
U.S. military about reinstating
ROTC at Stanford.This was the most
difficult issue to come before the
Senate in many years.
The issues involved in the ROTC
debate were complex and varied, in
volving everything from the Univer
sity's obligation to educate our na
tion's leaders, to the role of the mili
tary in society, to academic control
and integrity, among others. But in
the end, the issue that garnered the
most emotional attention and
aroused the most passionate debate
was the military's continuing dis
crimination against transgender indi
viduals.
The Faculty Senate is often called
upon to decide controversial issues.
When it does, there are inevitably

members of the community who dis
agree, sometimes strongly, with the
outcome. Still, senators are often able
to craft compromises that lead to
comfortable consensus.
This was different. It was clear
that whichever way the decision
went, it would be interpreted by
some members of the community as
a sign of disrespect a sign that their
interests, feelings and principles were
somehow less important, less valued,
than those of other members of the
community.
If the vote went against ROTC,
those students whose goal is military
service would be told they could pur
sue this objective, but only if they did
so at another institution. How could
they see this as anything but a sign
that the University viewed their goal
as somehow unseemly something
to be pursued out of sight of the rest
of the community?

But if the vote went in favor of
ROTC, transgender students would
see this as a sign that the University
condones the military's policies to
ward transgender individuals or at
the very least considers discrimina
tion against them to be less objection
able than discrimination against gay
men and lesbians.
There was not a senator in the
room who did not recognize and ag
onize over this aspect of the debate
who did not wish the issue could
be resolved without seeming to favor
one part of our community over an
other.
In the end, the Senate made its de
cision based on the value that ROTC
would bring to the campus and the
belief that Stanford has an obligation
to help educate military leaders. Al
though I could not vote as provost,
that's a decision I support. Many sen
ators, deeply troubled by the discrim

ination, were swayed by the hope
that as more military leaders are
drawn from communities like ours
communities where tolerance and
acceptance are the norm the more
quickly any remaining discrimina
tion based on sexual orientation or
gender identity will genuinely cease.
I hope that is true. And I know
that every senator who voted to re
turn ROTC to campus hopes it is true
and deeply opposes any policies or
practices that discriminate against
transgender individuals, as do the
president and I.
It took great courage for our
transgender students to publicly ex
press their opposition to ROTC. I
thank them for doing so. I appreciate
the heartfelt and moving statements
made by fellow students, particularly
the new and outgoing presidents of
the ASSU. It continues to trouble me
that any student would interpret the

ROTC decision as a sign that the
University does not honor and re
spect its transgender students, faculty
and staff
I wish the ROTC debate could
have been resolved without divisive
ness. As provost, I hope some good
will come of the issues raised and the
discussion that ensued. I hope the
campus will come together to recog
nize the continuing ignorance and
hostility transgender people face, to
affirm our condemnation of that dis
crimination and to express how
much we value their membership in
the University community.
Our community is far from per
fect, but it is remarkably accepting.
Let us use this opportunity to reaf
firm our values and to strengthen our
community.
