## GOULD AMBITION 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
As tennis legend Dick Gould sits com
fortably in the Taube Tennis Center
lounge, he thinks back on the long
and storied history that brought him
there.
Gould, currently the John L. Hinds Director
of Tennis, has been a fixture in the Stanford ten
nis community for over 50 years. He arrived on
campus in 1956 and, apart from a six-year hiatus,
has never left.
In 1966, Gould was hired as the men's tennis
coach at Stanford a position he held for the
next four decades. Under his watch, the men's
team achieved an almost unprecedented level of
success. In 39 seasons, his Cardinal won an as
tounding 17 NCAA team titles for one stretch
of 35 years, every four-year player left with at
least one championship ring. In the 1980s and.
19905, Gould was named the ITA-Wilson Coach
of the Decade.
The men's tennis squad has been by far the
most successful Stanford sports team over that
time span, rivaled only by the women's team,
which, starting in 1982 when the women's NCAA
Tennis Tournament was founded, began its own
run of dominance. In the past 45 years, the two
Stanford tennis teams have won 34 of the 100
NCAA titles that Stanford has collected in its il
lustrious athletic history.
After stepping down as head coach in 2004
and handing the men's team to his pupil cur
rent head coach John Whitlinger Gould has
overseen an eclectic range of duties for Stanford
tennis, starting with fundraising and moving to
mentoring young players, overseeing technology
upgrades in Taube and securing prestigious
events for Stanford, like the 2011 NCAA Cham
pionships.

Gould starts his story with a brief history les
son, just scratching the surface of the well of
memories that his career here at Stanford has
given him. When Gould first started here, the
Stanford athletic scene was a different beast

the football team wasn't winning Orange Bowls
and the women's soccer team wasn't finishing
consecutive regular seasons undefeated.
In those days, says Gould, tennis was prime
time.

"Back in the seventies, we had a couple of
players who really drew big crowds Roscoe
Tanner and Sandy Mayer to start and then, of
course, John McEnroe," he says. "In those days
tennis was one of the biggest draws on campus, as
we were one of the only teams that were doing
really well and there were more fans than could
watch on our outdoor courts. [We even] decided
to move some big matches indoors, into Maples."
Gould cracks a smile remembering when ten
nis matches were the marquee events on campus.
"Sports Illustrated was there," he continues.
"The band, the dollies, KZSU, everybody. We'd
have three matches in Maples, against big oppo
nents only, on Friday nights and, let me tell you,
the atmosphere was electric."

The Stanford tennis teams have
maintained a high level of success
over the last 40 years and will look to
add to their trophy case this spring
when they host NCAAs.
With a streak of 16 consecutive
NACDA Director's Cups an an
nual award given to the college or
university with the most overall ath
letic success it's no secret that
many of Stanford's once-struggling
sports programs have made re
markable turnarounds. That phe
nomenon garners well-earned at
tention from fans on campus and
around the country, but may also
obscure another incredible accom
plishment of Stanford athletics.
While other programs were
coming into form, Stanford's tennis
teams have been consistently win
ning for decades. Even today, the
women haven't lost a match at
home in over 12 years they're the
defending NCAA champions and
they're undefeated in 2011. The
men, meanwhile, are ranked No. 6 in
the country, are riding a ten-match
winning streak and boast the reign
ing NCAA singles champion in jun
ior Bradley Klahn.
Despite that consistency, atten
dance at Stanford tennis matches
has declined steadily in the years
since Gould's departure as head
coach.
While Gould will always be nos
talgic for the days that tennis owned
the sporting spotlight, Gould still
believes that Whitlinger's current
men's squad is "a legitimate title
contender."
Adding to Stanford's chances
this year, of course, is its home court
advantage. Both teams the top
seeded and women and the eighth
seeded men will have the oppor
tunity to make a run at national title
without ever leaving the Farm.
"Home court advantage makes
a gigantic difference, especially for a
team that's really good but not quite
great, as this year's men's team is,"
Gould says. "For this team to take
the title, we're going to need every
thing to go right."
While Gould will always treas
ure the time he spent coaching some
of the game's greatest athletes, he
still takes pride and pleasure in his
role with the current team. He in
sists that this year's batch of top
players Klahn for the men and
senior Hilary Barte for the women
"are the most fun players to
watch that I have ever seen."
Stanford hosts the NCAA Tour
nament beginning May 19 at the
Taube Tennis Stadium, and while
Gould is no longer coaching, he'll
certainly be just as invested in the
action as he's been for over half a
century.

As tennis legend Dick Gould sits com
fortably in the Taube Tennis Center
lounge, he thinks back on the long
and storied history that brought him
there.
Gould, currently the John L. Hinds Director
of Tennis, has been a fixture in the Stanford ten
nis community for over 50 years. He arrived on
campus in 1956 and, apart from a six-year hiatus,
has never left.
In 1966, Gould was hired as the men's tennis
coach at Stanford a position he held for the
next four decades. Under his watch, the men's
team achieved an almost unprecedented level of
success. In 39 seasons, his Cardinal won an as
tounding 17 NCAA team titles for one stretch
of 35 years, every four-year player left with at
least one championship ring. In the 1980s and.
19905, Gould was named the ITA-Wilson Coach
of the Decade.
The men's tennis squad has been by far the
most successful Stanford sports team over that
time span, rivaled only by the women's team,
which, starting in 1982 when the women's NCAA
Tennis Tournament was founded, began its own
run of dominance. In the past 45 years, the two
Stanford tennis teams have won 34 of the 100
NCAA titles that Stanford has collected in its il
lustrious athletic history.
After stepping down as head coach in 2004
and handing the men's team to his pupil cur
rent head coach John Whitlinger Gould has
overseen an eclectic range of duties for Stanford
tennis, starting with fundraising and moving to
mentoring young players, overseeing technology
upgrades in Taube and securing prestigious
events for Stanford, like the 2011 NCAA Cham
pionships.

Gould starts his story with a brief history les
son, just scratching the surface of the well of
memories that his career here at Stanford has
given him. When Gould first started here, the
Stanford athletic scene was a different beast

the football team wasn't winning Orange Bowls
and the women's soccer team wasn't finishing
consecutive regular seasons undefeated.
In those days, says Gould, tennis was prime
time.

"Back in the seventies, we had a couple of
players who really drew big crowds Roscoe
Tanner and Sandy Mayer to start and then, of
course, John McEnroe," he says. "In those days
tennis was one of the biggest draws on campus, as
we were one of the only teams that were doing
really well and there were more fans than could
watch on our outdoor courts. [We even] decided
to move some big matches indoors, into Maples."
Gould cracks a smile remembering when ten
nis matches were the marquee events on campus.
"Sports Illustrated was there," he continues.
"The band, the dollies, KZSU, everybody. We'd
have three matches in Maples, against big oppo
nents only, on Friday nights and, let me tell you,
the atmosphere was electric."

The Stanford tennis teams have
maintained a high level of success
over the last 40 years and will look to
add to their trophy case this spring
when they host NCAAs.
With a streak of 16 consecutive
NACDA Director's Cups an an
nual award given to the college or
university with the most overall ath
letic success it's no secret that
many of Stanford's once-struggling
sports programs have made re
markable turnarounds. That phe
nomenon garners well-earned at
tention from fans on campus and
around the country, but may also
obscure another incredible accom
plishment of Stanford athletics.
While other programs were
