## GOULD AMBITION 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
As tennis legend Dick Gould sits com
fortably in the Taube Tennis Center
lounge, he thinks back on the long
and storied history that brought him
there.
Gould, currently the John L. Hinds Director
of Tennis, has been a fixture in the Stanford ten
nis community for over 50 years. He arrived on
campus in 1956 and, apart from a six-year hiatus,
has never left.
In 1966, Gould was hired as the men's tennis
coach at Stanford a position he held for the
next four decades. Under his watch, the men's
team achieved an almost unprecedented level of
success. In 39 seasons, his Cardinal won an as
tounding 17 NCAA team titles for one stretch
of 35 years, every four-year player left with at
least one championship ring. In the 1980s and.
19905, Gould was named the ITA-Wilson Coach
of the Decade.
The men's tennis squad has been by far the
most successful Stanford sports team over that
time span, rivaled only by the women's team,
which, starting in 1982 when the women's NCAA
Tennis Tournament was founded, began its own
run of dominance. In the past 45 years, the two
Stanford tennis teams have won 34 of the 100
NCAA titles that Stanford has collected in its il
lustrious athletic history.
After stepping down as head coach in 2004
and handing the men's team to his pupil cur
rent head coach John Whitlinger Gould has
overseen an eclectic range of duties for Stanford
tennis, starting with fundraising and moving to
mentoring young players, overseeing technology
upgrades in Taube and securing prestigious
events for Stanford, like the 2011 NCAA Cham
pionships.

Gould starts his story with a brief history les
son, just scratching the surface of the well of
memories that his career here at Stanford has
given him. When Gould first started here, the
Stanford athletic scene was a different beast

the football team wasn't winning Orange Bowls
and the women's soccer team wasn't finishing
consecutive regular seasons undefeated.
In those days, says Gould, tennis was prime
time.

"Back in the seventies, we had a couple of
players who really drew big crowds Roscoe
Tanner and Sandy Mayer to start and then, of
course, John McEnroe," he says. "In those days
tennis was one of the biggest draws on campus, as
we were one of the only teams that were doing
really well and there were more fans than could
watch on our outdoor courts. [We even] decided
to move some big matches indoors, into Maples."
Gould cracks a smile remembering when ten
nis matches were the marquee events on campus.
"Sports Illustrated was there," he continues.
"The band, the dollies, KZSU, everybody. We'd
have three matches in Maples, against big oppo
nents only, on Friday nights and, let me tell you,
the atmosphere was electric."
