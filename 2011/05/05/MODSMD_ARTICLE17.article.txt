# BIG DEAL BENEFITS CARD
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Director of Athletics Bob
Bowlsby shed light on the Pac
12's new media deal on Wednes
day, detailing the ways in which
both Stanford and the conference
would benefit from the confer
ence's freshly-inked TV contract.
"It's a very large opportunity
for us going forward both finan
cially and from an exposure
standpoint," he said.
The conference will earn $3
billion over 12 years from its part
nership with Fox and ESPN.
Every football and men's basket

ball game will be televised and
available in all markets, either by
those networks or by a new Pac
-12 channel, which will be created
by the newly formed Pac-12
Media Enterprises. Most
women's basketball games will
also find their way to the air
waves, and a conference-specific
station means that smaller sports
can also be televised.
"The exposure we're going to
get on Fox national and ESPN
and ESPN2 is substantial for our
men's basketball program. For
football, we're going to have a lot
of exposure not just in frequency
but also in terms of time place

ment," Bowlsby said.
In announcing the deal, commis
sioner Larry Scott emphasized
three priorities: increased rev
enues, improved national expo
sure and the creation of a Pac-12
network.
"With today's announcement
with Fox Sports and ESPN, I am
thrilled to be here today to say
that we will be able to achieve all
three of these goals," Scott said.
According to Bowlsby, who
was in Phoenix for the announce
ment of the deal, the conference's
annual revenue will be split
equally among all 12 member
schools, and the first year of the
deal will see the conference earn
about $lBO million, with revenue
increases in each of the successive
years.
The difference in Stanford's
annual take-home between this
contract and the last one is dra
matic.
"After transactional costs and
overhead, it'll be about triple
what we're getting now. The dif
ference will be about $5 million
and change versus $l5-16 million
and change," Bowlsby said.
The money will not kick in
until 2012-13, and Bowlsby said
that the Athletics Department
has not yet begun to do serious
modeling of the distribution of
the new revenue. That said, he in
dicated that Stanford's cut of the
deal was larger than he had ex
pected and that the new money
would be able to provide for the
department in a number of ways,
although Bowlsby was in favor of
a conservative approach.
"We have not had the ability to

put away reserves for facility needs.
We've had generous people donate
money," he said. "We're going to try
and save as much of it as we can."
Some of the facilities upgrades
may go right into helping Stanford
optimize as much of its deal as pos
sible. Bowlsby said that the depart
ment would look into optimizing its
venues to help with digital distribu
tion through media such as ESPN3
and 3D television.
In other areas, Bowlsby did an
ticipate spending more money on
chartering flights for the men's and
women's basketball teams so that
the squads could avoid missing sig
nificant class time during the con
ference schedule. He also figured
that money could be spent to rein
force the budgets of some of Stan
ford's smaller teams, some of
which, such as fencing, have faced
financial issues in the past few
years.
"We try and fund our sports on a
level to be excellent at what they
do. And we do it for all 35-varsity
sports. But there is no question this
will give us a chance for stability,"
he said.
Bowlsby also entertained the
idea of adding a 36th varsity sport.
"We'd have to think about it to
think about what we might add. No

plans for expansion, but it's not out
of the question. We're more than
meeting our gender equity require
ments. We'd be open-minded about
it," he said.
One area where Bowlsby did
not anticipate spending money was
on the hiring of new staff. The de
partment has had to lay off numer
ous staff members in the past two
years including 21 in 2009 but
Bowlsby said he did not "expect to
add a lot of people."
Bowlsby was noticeably opti
mistic but recognized that the in
flux of money would not be able to
help the Athletics Department
clear every hurdle it might face.
"This isn't a silver bullet that is
going to solve all of our problems,"
he said. "But it will give us an infu
sion of revenue that will be very
helpful."
