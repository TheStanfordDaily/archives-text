# Sports a welcome reprieve
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
It was 1 a.m. a couple days ago
and I was Gchatting with my
friend when I realized some
thing crazy. I hadn't watched
Sports Center all day. I hadn't
watched a single minute of either
NBA game, despite being just a
matter of feet from a television.
Heck, I hadn't even seen a single
highlight of Francisco Liriano's no
hitter, despite having watched the
last two innings on Game Cast (I
mean, I was definitely paying atten
tion in that review session ...)
While most of you can probably
last 24 hours without sports high
lights, I'm not built the same way.
You might as well ask me to go 24
hours without oxygen or fruit
snacks (the two essentials of life as
far as I can tell). In the past year, I've
probably had at least twice as many
days where I watched Sports Center
five times as days where I was
sports-free. And I like it that way.
As I looked back on my Sports-
Center-less Tuesday, it struck me
what a lousy day I'd been having. I
had spent a good part of the day
doing homework (Seriously?
Homework? At Stanford?) and I
just generally felt miserable. And it
hit me. These are the times where
sports really come through for me.
I have written before on how
deep the pain of being a sports fan
can get. (As I'm writing this, my An
gels found away not to score de
spite having the bases loaded and
one out as if I really needed a re
minder.) But yet, there are still bil
lions of us out there, so sports must
be doing something good. And one
of the biggest benefits sports can
have is distracting us from the rest
of our lives. When discussing this,
many people do so in the context of
September 11th or other global
conflicts, and these are certainly
valid points. But for Average Joe,
distractions are needed much more
often and for much less important
reasons.
And really, what's a better dis
traction than getting a full day's
sports highlights in an hour? Of
course, some days you might need a
distraction from the sports world it
self, but in most cases, a fight with a
friend, relationship issues, job prob
lems, financial trouble and whatev
er else has made your day suck can
be temporarily relieved by diving
catches, alley-oops and ridiculous
home run calls.
One of the great things about
sports is that no matter what else is
happening in your life, the sports
world keeps going. While you're
waiting to hear back from that po
tential employer, you can still watch
an entire playoff series take place.
When you get sick and can't do any
thing fun for days, you've got
dozens of sporting events to help
you pass the time. When you wake
up in the morning and can't believe
you have to deal with what hap
pened the day before, at least the
sports world will be new today.
And you don't even need to be
unhappy to get fresh sports all the
time. When you have better things
to do than watch sports (I hear
that's a possibility, but I'm still look
ing into the validity of these claims),
you can still come back and see
what happened. That's the beauty
of sports you can be out on a hot
date or alone in your room with
three problem sets, but Andre Ethi
er will still get a hit (when he's
healthy, of course). The sports world
never stops.
Of course, some things never
seem to change. Day 82 of the NFL
lockout probably won't give us a
whole lot more insight than Day 81,
and who knows when the steroid
debate will ever finish.
But when the front pages of
ESPN.com and Yahoo Sports have
no mention of Liriano less than 24
hours after his no-hitter, you know
the sports world can move on
quickly.
No, sports cannot solve all of
life's problems. But as I sat down to
catch the last few highlights of the 1
a.m. Sports Center, for the first time
all day, I was at ease.
