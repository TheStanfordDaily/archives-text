## New findings pave way for hydrogen fuel Molybdenum sulfide shown to be a cheap, effective catalyst 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Researchers at Stanford and the Techni
cal University of Denmark (DTU) are
bringing the dream of a green-powered
world one step closer to reality.
Up to this point, scientists have encoun
tered a practical hurdle in the production of
clean hydrogen fuel: the lack of cheap and
abundant catalysts that can expedite the
generation of hydrogen and oxygen. Recent
findings by chemical engineering professor
Jens Norskov and his peers may effectively
overcome this hurdle.

The concept of imitating plant photosyn
thesis in fuel production is not new. In fact,
one feasible procedure today is to use a
platinum catalyst in conjunction with a
light-absorbing electrode to produce hydro
gen fuel from sunlight and water.
But platinum is both expensive and
scarce. According to Norskov and his team,
a better option is molybdenum sulfide, a
natural catalyst that is both cheap and abun
dant.

"Molybdenum sulfide is a good alterna
tive," Norskov said. "There are other cata
lysts that work but they're based on plat
inum and similar materials, and they are too
rare and too expensive for widespread use,"
Norskov and his peers hope to further
develop a procedure called photo-electro
chemical (PEC) water splitting. In this
process, sunlight hits PEC cells and this ab
sorbed energy is used to split water mole
cules into hydrogen and oxygen.

DTU researchers have created a device
that harvests energy from sunlight ener
gy that is later used to power the conversion
of single hydrogen ions into hydrogen gas.
This latter process required a catalyst, which
is where Norskov and his team came in.

"We have been studying catalysts and
chemical processes for a long time but obvi
ously one of the big challenges in that field
is to find catalysts for making fuels from
sunlight," said Norskov, who is the professor
of photon science at the SLAC National Ac
celerator Laboratory.
The Stanford researchers developed a
theoretical method to examine catalyst
behavior.
"We do calculations of the elec
tronic structure of materials be
cause that in the end is what deter
mines whether the electronic struc
ture is what determines all the
properties of a material," Norskov
said.

As the Stanford researchers de
veloped an "understanding of what
is important a catalyst for hydro
gen," they were able to identify
molybdenum sulfide as an inexpen
sive but effective catalyst.
These findings pave the way for
future collaboration between
Norskov's research team and other
scientists on the Farm and beyond.
Thomas Jaramillo, assistant profes
sor of chemical engineering, is one
of these fortunate scientists. Fie has
worked closely with Norskov over
the years.
"In my research team, we are ul
timately experimental," Jaramillo
said. "We can synthesize a lot of in
teresting materials and we have a
lot of control over the composition
of the material as well as the nanos
tructure of the material. We can
work collaboratively [with
Norskov] in that when we find in
teresting things in the lab, we can
communicate that to him and his
team."
Norskov's group, in turn, uses
these findings to perform theoreti
cal calculations and predictions.
"We're in constant communica
tion with one another and our out
put serve them as inputs and their
outputs can serve as our inputs, and
vice versa," Jaramillo said.
Norskov, Jaramillo and their
peers are adamant about continu
ing their research on energy effi
cient and clean fuels.
"You lose a lot of the energy
from the sunlight in transferring
that into a fuel, hydrogen for in
stance," Norskov said.
Hydrogen is an attractive source
of fuel because it is energy dense
and serves as a relatively clean fuel.
But PEC water splitting is not a
surefire answer to the world's ener
gy needs yet, the researchers said.
"We would like to find catalysts
and materials to absorb sunlight
that are more efficient in doing it so
we don't lose a lot of energy and
that is in the end that will make this
competitive," Norskov said.
"Let me stress: we're not sure
that there is not a solution," he said.
"But we're trying to get there."
