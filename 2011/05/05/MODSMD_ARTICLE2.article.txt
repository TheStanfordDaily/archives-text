## New findings pave way for hydrogen fuel Molybdenum sulfide shown to be a cheap, effective catalyst

Researchers at Stanford and the Techni
cal University of Denmark (DTU) are
bringing the dream of a green-powered
world one step closer to reality.
Up to this point, scientists have encoun
tered a practical hurdle in the production of
clean hydrogen fuel: the lack of cheap and
abundant catalysts that can expedite the
generation of hydrogen and oxygen. Recent
findings by chemical engineering professor
Jens Norskov and his peers may effectively
overcome this hurdle.

The concept of imitating plant photosyn
thesis in fuel production is not new. In fact,
one feasible procedure today is to use a
platinum catalyst in conjunction with a
light-absorbing electrode to produce hydro
gen fuel from sunlight and water.
But platinum is both expensive and
scarce. According to Norskov and his team,
a better option is molybdenum sulfide, a
natural catalyst that is both cheap and abun
dant.

"Molybdenum sulfide is a good alterna
tive," Norskov said. "There are other cata
lysts that work but they're based on plat
inum and similar materials, and they are too
rare and too expensive for widespread use,"
Norskov and his peers hope to further
develop a procedure called photo-electro
chemical (PEC) water splitting. In this
process, sunlight hits PEC cells and this ab
sorbed energy is used to split water mole
cules into hydrogen and oxygen.

DTU researchers have created a device
that harvests energy from sunlight ener
gy that is later used to power the conversion
of single hydrogen ions into hydrogen gas.
This latter process required a catalyst, which
is where Norskov and his team came in.

"We have been studying catalysts and
chemical processes for a long time but obvi
ously one of the big challenges in that field
is to find catalysts for making fuels from
sunlight," said Norskov, who is the professor
of photon science at the SLAC National Ac
celerator Laboratory.
The Stanford researchers developed a
theoretical method to examine catalyst
