# Men's soccer bests Santa Clara in exhibition match
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
After a very narrow 1-0 loss at
the hands of Major League Soccer's
San Jose Earthquakes two weeks
ago, the men's soccer team returned
to its winning ways with one of its
best performances of a successful
spring season in a 4-2 victory over
Santa Clara last night.
Freshmen Tyler Conklin and
Austin Meyer both scored their first
collegiate goals in a wild second
half that featured end-to-end action
and six goals. Conklin's goal started
the scoring spree and was quickly
followed by a strike from sopho
more forward Adam Jahn.
The Broncos answered back
with a goal of their own, but the
Cardinal responded with freshman

forward Adrian Berg's second goal
of the spring.
A questionable call allowed
Santa Clara to draw within one
when a Bronco player appeared to
bat the ball into the goal with his
arm, but Meyer was perfectly posi

tioned to pounce on a rebound in
front of the goal and calmly slot it
away for the final margin.
Stanford missed several other
chances to score in front of a crowd
of about 150 spectators, but head
coach Bret Simon said he was

pleased with the team's effort as a
whole.
The Cardinal returns to action in
its final game of the spring on May
13, when it hosts UC-Davis at 7 p.m.
