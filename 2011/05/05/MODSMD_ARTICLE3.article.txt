### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In a Wednesday evening discussion at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, New York Times
columnist and Middle East expert Thomas
Friedman explored the causes and implica
tions of the popular uprisings in the Arab
world. The talk, titled "Democracy and Ener
gy: the View from Tahrir Square," was spon
sored by Students for a Sustainable Stanford,
theASSU Speakers' Bureau, Stanford in Gov
ernment and Hillel.

Friedman opened his talk by explaining the
context of the Middle East's recent history, es
pecially the fact that nearly all of the region's
governments are autocratic.
"For the last 50 years, we in the West... ba
sically treated and looked upon the Arab
world as a collection of big gas stations," he
said. "Our basic message to them all was, 'Guys
and they were only guys here's the deal.
Keep your pumps open, your prices low, don't
bother the Israelis too much and you can do
whatever you want out back.'"
Fie went on to describe how the al Qaeda

terrorism network and its now deceased
leader, Osama bin Laden, were a product of
what was going on "out back." He added that
there were three large "human deficits" in the
Arab world: freedom, women's empowerment
and education.

"[Arabs] know their own human potential
and it was not being in any way developed,"
Friedman said. "If I got to write the 'bill of par
ticulars' for all these Arab regimes, they would
be guilty of the worst crime I can think of: the
soft bigotry of low expectations about their
own people."
The revolution in Egypt carried particular
significance, given its size and stature in the
Arab world. Friedman spoke about his experi
ences covering the downfall of its former pres
ident, Hosni Mubarak, and the challenges still
facing the country. He characterized the cur
rent transition of moving from "Middle East
wholesale" to "Middle East retail."

Friedman placed special emphasis on the
Muslim Brotherhood, a large Egyptian Is
lamist group and the main political opposition
during Mubarak's rule.
"Mubarak cleared out the entire political

space between his regime and the Muslim
Brotherhood," he said. "He refused to allow
the emergence of a single authentic, legiti
mate, centrist Arab nationalist party."

He described how Mubarak used this
arrangement to his advantage, by presenting
himself to the U.S. as the only alternative to the
Islamic rule of the Brotherhood.

The next topic of discussion was Israel's
role in the region and the evolution of the
struggle for Palestinian statehood. Friedman
explained how the country's security situation,
which depends on stability of the Egyptian and
Syrian borders, was deteriorating. He added
that Israel needed to find a credible Palestin
ian negotiation partner and that its enemies in
Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas were baiting it.
"They are dedicated on one proposition
Israel must never leave the West Bank," Fried
man said. "That is the central principle of their
strategy because if Israel stays in the West
Bank, in a very short period of time, you will
have Israel ruling a minority of Jews over a
majority of Arabs between the Mediterranean
