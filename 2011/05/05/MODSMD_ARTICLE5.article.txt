## Distinguished experts ponder China's future Conference looks at the rising superpower's foreign policy 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Distinguished researchers of Chinese
politics and international relations dis
cussed the worldwide ramifications of a
rising China yesterday as part of the Ok
senberg conference series.

The conference, titled "Constraints on
China's Foreign Policy: Inside and Out,"
consisted of a keynote address delivered
by Thomas Christensen, professor of pol
itics at Princeton. The conference was fol
lowed by two panel discussions.

In his address, Christensen noted that
China, as a rising power, will encounter
international challenges and suggested
that China's losses are not necessarily
America's gains.
"This is not a zero-sum game," he said.
"It's not to the benefit of the United
States when China has abrasive policies
towards its neighbors and has tensions
with our allies, and although many Amer-
icans might think that and say
'That will help us bolster our al
liances,' we can bolster our al
liances on our own."
China is now more influential
in international organizations and
in the global economy, Chris
tensen said.
He noted that last year China
opposed sanctions on North
Korea after that country attacked
a South Korea naval ship and
shelled a South Korean Island. In
addition, China's loud protest of
U.S.-South Korean military exer
cises and its maritime tension
with Japan have cast it in a nega
tive light with some neighboring

countries.
Christensen observed that Chi
nese leaders have recently en
countered difficulties in handling
certain international problems.
"I don't see China reaching out
in a systematic way to solve vari
ous long-term problems, to
change its overall diplomatic
strategy," he said. "Instead, I see
China running up against the nor
mal problems of a great power as
its power rises and then behaving
extremely badly in response to the
challenges that are created by
those normal frictions of growth
and interaction in new ways with
neighbors and with faraway pow
ers."
He added that between 2006
and 2008, China played a con
structive role in international af
fairs. For example, it put pressure
on North Korea and Sudan and

sent the first non-African peace
keeping force to Darfur.
Following Christensen's talk,
Stanford professor of political sci
ence Jean Oi moderated the first
panel. The discussion centered on
topics including rising income in
equality, popular dissatisfaction
with the government and the rise
of nationalist sentiment. The pan
elists were Terry Sicular of Stan
ford's economics department,
USC professor of political science
Stan Rosen and George Washing
ton University professor Bruce
Dickson.
Dickson argued that although
the Chinese are wealthier, this in
creased prosperity may not result
in a transition to a democratic sys
tem any time soon.
The second panel dealt with
the implications of China's grow
ing influence around the world. It

was moderated by Michael Arma
cost, a distinguished fellow at the
Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Re
search Center. The panelists were
Scott Kastner from the University
of Maryland, Ely Ratner from the
RAND Corporation and Tai Ming
Cheung from UC-San Diego.
Ratner's analysis focused on
foreign threats to China, such as
terrorist groups carrying out at
tacks in China or on Chinese in
terests abroad. Ratner said that
groups urged retaliation after the
Chinese government cracked
down on dissent in the mostly
Muslim region of Xinjiang in re
sponse to the 2009 riots. China
may continue to face the chal
lenges posed by international ter
rorism as its influence grows.
"In addition to problems of
perceived mistreatment of Mus
lims in China, Islamist groups
could also target Chinese inter
ests as punishment for supporting
secular or autocratic regimes par
ticularly in the Muslim world," he
said.

Other topics raised included
the role of the Chinese military.
Students came away more
knowledgeable about the issues
relevant to China's rise. Jimmy
Ruck *ll, a history major, is work
ing on an honors thesis on the role
of the Chinese military in contem
porary China. He noted the signif
icance of outside threats to China
and how these threats may pre
vent China from importing re
sources to fuel its economic
growth.
"It's important to realize that
China faces threats themselves,"
Ruck said. "The idea that there's
terrorism against them and then
this constant push for resources, I
thought they were some pretty
important points."
Xiaojun Li, a fourth-year doc
toral student in political science,
said that the greatest insight he
gained was on the importance of a
nation's domestic and foreign
policies.
"It's important now to look at
both domestic and foreign policy
as well as the implications for
both China and the U. 5.," Li said.
Sungmin Rho, a third-year doc
toral student in political science
said she enjoyed hearing about
the diversity of views on China's
role in the world.
"It was interesting in that we
could actually hear more opinions
of current events and current poli
cies and how American policy
makers perceive China and at the
same time how other countries
perceive China," Rho said.
The Oksenberg lecture series
began in memory of Michel Ok
senberg, who died in 2001. He was
a fellow at the Shorenstein Asia-
Pacific Research Center and the
Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies. Oksenberg
served on the National Security
Council in the years that the Unit
ed States and China normalized
diplomatic relations.
