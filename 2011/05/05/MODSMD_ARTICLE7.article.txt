## Chaparral, Claw examine funding strategies 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Following this year's elections,
most campus publications received
their special fees requests with the
exception of the Stanford Chaparral
and the Claw Magazine. These re
sults have forced the latter groups to
re-evaluate their budgets and devel
op new strategies for funding in the
next year.

The Chaparral and the Claw
failed to pass undergraduate special
fees by a margin of less than 1 per
cent in their share of "yes" votes. The
Chaparral earned 48.48 percent in
total "yes" votes and 19.93 percent
in "yes" votes as a percentage of the
undergraduate student body. The
Claw earned 49.56 percent and 18.1
percent, respectively.
To receive special fees funding, a
given group must have the approval
of at least 50 percent of voters and
these voters must constitute at least
15 percent of the undergraduate stu
dent body.
Both publications indicated dif
ferent strategies in their efforts to
obtain special fees this past elections
season. The Stanford Chaparral, a
humor magazine, printed four dif
ferent flyers and emailed various

lists, tactics that were not used last
year.

"Last year we got above 50 per
cent approval, but not the total 15
percent 'yes' votes, so we tried very
hard this year to get above 15 per
cent," Chaparral editors Josh Meisel
'l2 and Billy Kemper 'll wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We got 19 per
cent 'yes' votes, but only 48.4 per
cent of our total votes were 'yes'
votes. Next year we know we have to
keep both requirements in mind."
According to the two, the Chap
arral is currently in its 112 th volume.
The magazine publishes five 32-
page issues a year, each with its own
theme. One of these issues is typical
ly a parody of a national publication.
The Chaparral is also responsible
for publishing the fake Stanford
Daily each year.
"We requested $22,150," Meisel
and Kemper said. "$20,600 was for
printing, $1,350 for mailing subscrip
tions and $2OO for office supplies.
The reason for the high price of
printing is that we publish 6 issues.
The Leland Quarterly and the Claw
have about half our printing costs
but also publish half as many issues."
Meisel and Kemper also empha
sized the Chaparral's long history at
Stanford, noting that it was created

eight years after Stanford's found
ing. Stanford Chaparral alumni have
gone on to animate for Disney and
write for popular television shows,
including "The Office," "SNL," "Fu
turama" and "King of the Hill."
Although the Chaparral has long
standing experience with special fees,
the process of applying for special
this type of funding was entirely new
for the Claw, a campus literary maga
zine. According to Claw editors in
chief Alice Nam 'll and Max Mc-
Clure 'll, the decision to apply for
special fees emerged within the first
few weeks of spring quarter.

"We were hesitant to add to the
mad clamor for special fees," Nam
and McClure wrote in an email to
The Daily. "We opted instead for a
soft campaign; we sent fliers an
nouncing the new issue and encour
aging students to join the magazine.
"But we didn't make a single
special fees flier or ask anyone to
vote. Who knows if we'd do it again,
but in the scramble of the first
weeks of spring quarter, that's what
we decided."

The Claw, which publishes three
times per year, requested $12,500 in
special fees for 2,000 copies. The
money from special fees was intend
ed for printing.

According to Nam and McClure,
the goal of the Claw's special fees
campaign was not necessarily to re
ceive special fees, but rather to gain
more publicity for the magazine.
The editors hoped the special fees
campaign would encourage new
members to join the magazine,
which seeks to publish investigative
reports, essays, fiction and articles
on fine art.

"Between petitioning and talk
ing to supporters, we wanted to find
out what we needed to do to make
the Claw a more prominent part of
the Stanford community," Nam and
McClure said. "We got that and
we're very grateful."
Both publications are dependent
on the ASSU Publications Board for
funding next year. In addition, the
Stanford Chaparral plans to fund
the magazine through the Stanford
Fund and alumni donations.

"Of course, asking alumni to
fund the magazine is not reasonable
as a permanent solution," Meisel
and Kemper said. "But our dedicat
ed alumni are willing to help keep
the magazine alive given this rare
occasion."
