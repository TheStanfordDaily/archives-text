## BLENDING Mixed-race students hope for multicultural campus community TOGETHER 
### ASHLEY MENZIES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
These students are part of the growing
country-wide phenomenon of individuals
who identify themselves as "mixed race."
The number of people who check both
the black and white boxes has increased
by 134 percent to 1.8 million since the 2000 census,
the first time it allowed such an option. Among
American children, the multiracial population has
increased nearly 50 percent to 4.2 million since 2000.
"The growth of this population is clearly a trend
that will surely increase every decade into the 21st
century," wrote history professor A1 Camarillo in an
email to The Daily.
At Stanford, this rise in the mixed-race popula
tion may finally create a multicultural community
in which mixed-race students feel they can belong.
Multiracial associations have in recent years
been popping up on college campuses all around
the country. These organizations aim to promote
multicultural awareness and provide students with
a safe environment to discuss multiracial issues.
Many Stanford students were surprised that an or
ganization for mixed-race students does not exist
on campus.
Marcus Turner 'l2, who is half black and half
Latino and grew up in a predominately African-
American community, thinks that it would be ben
eficial to have a multiracial association on campus.
Although Turner was always taught to embrace his
African-American heritage and is proud of being
half black, he feels unable to identify with the black
community at Stanford. His inability to speak Span
ish also makes him feel like an outsider to the Lati
no community. He believes that a multiracial asso
ciation "would give us a place where we belong."
Ogiemwanye struggled with where she be
longed for much of her life. She did not identify
with either race because she "looked different."
For example, her skin seemed too fair and her hair
too wavy for her Nigerian background, and too
dark and too coarse for her Jewish background.
She only began to identify as black during her
sophomore year of college. At that time,
Ogiemwanye did not consider herself black be
cause she had associated the term black with cer
tain cultural stereotypes.
Before coming to Stanford, Ogiemwanye
thought of her experiences as distinct from those of
other blacks she had interacted with. Her college
studies, which focused on social justice issues, caused
her to realize that "race is a social construct."
Even though others usually see her as black,
Ogiemwanye is proud of her black and Jewish iden
tity.
"I've taken pieces of both sides and let that be
who I am," she said.
To a similar tune, other mixed-race students
Turner, Markham, Burns, Smith and Krumm also
identify as biracial.
Although Burns, who is often mistaken for being
Indian, is only one fourth-white and three-fourths
black, she often tells others that she is half white and
half black for convenience.
With his curly hair, olive-colored skin and al
mond-shaped eyes, Krumm who identifies as Ja
maican and white has been asked if he was a
number of races, including a mix of black, white, Chi
nese and Latino.
Gunther is often mistaken for being completely
white, though he's part Filipino. Because society
perceives him as being of one race, he usually iden
tifies as white, unless he is with his family. In middle
school, he tried to befriend people in the Asian com
munity but did not feel accepted because of his ap
pearance. Even his Filipino family members joking
ly comment, "He's so white," according to Gunther.
Owusu had a similar experience growing up half
Samoan and half black. He said he has always iden
tified himself as black because he has darker skin
and that is how others view him. Yet he still wishes
to embrace his other background.
"Whenever I see someone that is Polynesian, I do
say I'm half Samoan," Owusu said. "I'm proud of
that."
Many students agree that society has helped
shape the way they identify themselves, for better or
for worse. If their physical features are more charac
teristic of one race than the other, they tend to feel a
stronger tie with that aspect of their ethnic back
ground.
Camarillo believes that in the near future stu
dents will be able to identify themselves in a differ
ent manner.
"A substantial portion of the multiracial popula
tion will reject 'one-race' categories and will express
an identity that can't be contained in such limited
historical terminology (e.g. black, white, Asian,
etc.)," he said.
Assistant professor of English Vaughn Rasberry
also observed a change in norms concerning racial
identity. In Rasberry's opinion, the increase of indi
viduals in America identifying themselves as mixed
race is not just the result of a sociological trend, but
"also registers some dissatisfaction with conven
tional racial or ethnic categories."
One day. Smith hopes, "someone who is mixed
race does not have to 'choose' a major ethnicity to
identify by, so that we really can be everything."
