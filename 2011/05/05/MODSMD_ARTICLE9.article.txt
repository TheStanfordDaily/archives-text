## THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC America, **** Yeah! 
### Shane Savitsky 
Wolfram Alpha tells me that
I'm currently 3,457 miles
from my home in Scranton,
Pennsylvania and that I'm 5,335
miles from that glorious Farm that
you all inhabit right now. Needless to
say, I should be living the Oxford life.
And in away, I definitely am. I think
I had a pretty quintessential English
weekend or at least I tried to.
It all started on Friday morning. I
woke up to watch Kate Middleton
slip out of my grasp forever. (Speak
ing of, remember last week's dis
course on British accents? That defi
nitely applies to Kate, who is a 9.5 by
default. By my rules, that means her
British accent makes her an 11!
That's goddess territory, honestly.)
It's just really frustrating. Prince
William is almost bald before he's
30, and he still gets one of the most
beautiful women on the planet. They
say "love is blind," but I don't think
that counts when there's an HRH
title at stake. So while most of you
were probably sound asleep in bed, I
was drowning my sorrows with gin
and tonics like a 40-year-old man.
Some people suggested drinking
every time you saw a funny hat or
Elton John, but I don't think anyone
could have survived that game.
Then we can fast-forward to Sat
urday evening. Now, note that May 1
is largely celebrated here in Oxford.
At 6 a.m. on May Morning, the Mag
dalen College choir sings from the
top of Magdalen Tower as people
flood High Street. It's all very cele
bratory and fun, but who wants to
wake up at 6 a.m. on a Sunday? Short
answer: you don't. Oxford students
generally just stay out partying, par
tying (yeah!) all night —so that's
what I did. From the college bar to
the club to a sunrise on High Street,
it was all a fantastic evening/night/
morning. It was pure Oxford tradi
tion in the best of ways.
And then we have Sunday. Well,
Sunday was perhaps less exciting in
terms of Oxford tradition, but still
quite traditional nonetheless. I liter
ally spent the entire day writing my
tutorial paper. You know the stereo
type about going abroad and doing
no work? Yeah, that doesn't hold
when you do the Stanford in Oxford
program. 2,500 words a week and
that's just for your tutorial. This
quarter, I'll probably do quadruple
the writing I'd do at Stanford. How
disgusting is that? At least I'll come
back well versed in the ways of BS.
Ah, and so would complete my
quintessential Oxford weekend,

You can take the boy out
ofAmerica,butyou
cannot take the
America out of the boy.

right? You're wrong. Because when I
wrapped up my tutorial paper at
roughly 3:15 a.m. British Standard
Time, I sat down on Twitter just for a
quick moment to see what was going
on in the world when I was greeted
with a message from the New York
Times: "President Obama to make
unplanned announcement at 10:30
p.m." It was only 15 minutes to wait.
How could I not?
And so, the news that we are so
familiar with at this point ended up
coming across the wire. Osama bin
Laden was killed by U.S. Navy
SEALS. I managed to stay awake
until 5:45 a.m. while watching a live
stream of CNN. Trust me, I was
thrilled. Sunday evening was a time
when everyone in the United States
even the most liberal human be
ings like myself could count
themselves as complete neoconserv
atives. I was so glad that I ended up
working late so I could be a witness
to history in real-time.
Yet I think Osama's death cer
tainly proves one thing for me: I can
not escape America. I'm here in
England. I had the perfect Oxford
weekend. I've been absolutely lov
ing my time here and my adaptation
to English culture (however similar
it may be to our own), but that surge
of pure American pride I felt on
hearing President Obama's speech
on Sunday night showed me that
while you can take the boy out of
America, you cannot take the Amer
ica out of the boy. I've loved my few
weeks abroad thus far, but really,
there's no place like home.

Yet I think Osama's death cer
tainly proves one thing for me: I can
not escape America. I'm here in
England. I had the perfect Oxford
weekend. I've been absolutely lov
ing my time here and my adaptation
to English culture (however similar
it may be to our own), but that surge
of pure American pride I felt on
hearing President Obama's speech
on Sunday night showed me that
while you can take the boy out of
America, you cannot take the Amer
ica out of the boy. I've loved my few
weeks abroad thus far, but really,
there's no place like home.
