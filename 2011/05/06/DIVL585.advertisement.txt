Senior Danny Sandbrink (above) has regained the form that saw him finish 2-1 with a 2.81 ERA. That included a
clutch postseason performance against Pepperdine in the NCAA Tournament when he pitched his first collegiate
complete game and gave up just one run. Sandbrink leads the ballclub again this year with a 2.27 ERA and is 3-0
thanks to a renewed confidence in the "funk" ball, his signature pitch that is a variation on a two-seam fastball.
