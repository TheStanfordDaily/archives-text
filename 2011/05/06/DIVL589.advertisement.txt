Uniting an ensemble of singers with the awe-inspiring musical inventions of
Mac Arthur Fellow Trimpin, TheGursZyklus ["Gurs Cycle"] explores the history
and legacy of the French internment camp of Gurs. Drawing on rare letters of
Jewish internees during World War 11, the music of Spanish Civil War internee
Conlon Nan car row, and memories of Trimpin's own post-war German youth, The
Gurs Zyklus is innovative, immersive, and profoundly moving.
