# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Pop Goes the Weasel 
### Kristian Bailey 
Sometime within the past week,
I got derailed. On Sunday
evening, I felt an overwhelm
ing desire to crumple into my room
mate's futon and devolve into a hot
mess of tears. In the time since then,
I've had an overwhelming sense of
sadness not overwhelming in
that I don't feel happy, but in the
sense that even when I have high
highs, like seeing Mae Jemison,
being accepted into Sophomore
College and finalizing housing pref
erences for next year with my won
derful "drawmies," I return to this
low state of emptiness and confu
sion. No matter how urgent my as
signments were, I could not bring
myself to complete them I'd read
the same sentence repeatedly with
out comprehending it, and when I
could get moving, it would be very
slowly. My side of the room has be
come a heap of clothes, books and
folders, and I've been staying up
late, agonizing about my work, but
not doing anything about it.
I've always spent a lot of time re
flecting about how I feel, why I feel
that way and how those feelings in
fluence my thoughts and actions.
I've rarely not been able to explain
my feelings, even when I'm sad. My
distress was puzzling, though, be
cause I couldn't attribute it to any
one thing, or even a conglomera
tion of things.
In an effort to shed some light
on how I arrived in this state, I de
cided to start rereading and digitiz
ing my journal. I usually run
through a 240 page Moleskine
notebook (no, I did not have to
specify that I use Moleskines; yes, I
am slightly pretentious, but they
make me happy) in about two or
three months, but given my infre
quency of writing in these fast
paced months, I discovered on
Monday night that I still haven't
finished a journal I started on No
vember 28, 2010. This date coin
cides with my first trips home and

back to Stanford, Winter Break and
my evaluation of fall quarter/re
assessment of my priorities for the
winter, my hopes for 2011 and fears
about being away from home for
half a year and my development at
Stanford over the past five months.
I've never been able to reread a
journal completely, even one from
years ago, but this process has been
different as I've been finding many
"clues" and have been able to read
my past self as though I were a
character separate from my current
one.

When I arrived at the end of Jan
uary on Wednesday morning,
around the time when my winter
quarter angst began to develop, a
light bulb went off in my head: Win
ter Quarter was something I want
ed to be over as soon as possible, so
much so that I immediately jumped
on board the "spring quarter is
going to be so much better" band
wagon and believed that all of my
problems would/did go away from
the very first day of this quarter.
I've stuck with that a lot and,
while I am happier than I was last
quarter, even in my current trou
bles, I only realized then how I seg
mented my life between the quar
ters, and how naive that was.
I shared this with one of my best
friends the one with whom I'd re
solved to make spring quarter reso
lutions and who also had an emo
tionally difficult winter quarter.
While I rarely use quotes in my
columns, her words were too beauti
ful not to share. "We wanted to be

lieve in the severance between
quarters too badly. Momentum
blinded us, protected us. But a con
structed narrative can't register
contradictions; once a hole in our
story is exposed, everything else dis
places itself. We can't locate the pre
cise moments that produce sadness
because the origins are structural.
All the shit that I've relegated to the
past, neutralized with false symbol
ism, hasn't evaporated — it under
girds the whole system, hostile and
silent," she said. And it seemed that
while one level of my consciousness
allowed me to exist in my fantasy
world, a deeper level never stopped
acknowledging my former anguish
and anxiety, caused me this recent
depression and refused to let go
until I recognized it myself.
"So we were shocked into recog
nition of winter's lovely traces. So
we're forced into consciousness.
Then what happens now? This time
we can't take refuge in compart
mentalization — clearly that was a
little counter-productive. But how
do we move forward?" my friend
asked.

And that's what I'm wondering
now.
I've already spoken to my teach
ers and professors and one thing
that I've come to love about the
University in the past week is how
accommodating the faculty is with
extensions and the number of re
sources available as safety nets. In
the worst-case scenario, if I were
not able to complete any more as
signments the rest of the year, there
are structures like taking an incom
plete that would not prevent me
from graduating on time, from con
tinuing to do well, etc. And though
I'm fairly sure this won't be the case
for me, knowing that I could do this
takes off a load of stress.
For now, I've scheduled an ap
pointment with CAPS, plan to take
a mental health day over the week
end by going to the beach with
some friends who also appreciate
solitude and continue to work on
my assignments one piece at a time,
but I still don't know: how do I
move forward?

cides with my first trips home and

back to Stanford, Winter Break and
my evaluation of fall quarter/re
assessment of my priorities for the
winter, my hopes for 2011 and fears
about being away from home for
half a year and my development at
Stanford over the past five months.
I've never been able to reread a
journal completely, even one from
years ago, but this process has been
different as I've been finding many
"clues" and have been able to read
my past self as though I were a
character separate from my current
one.

When I arrived at the end of Jan
uary on Wednesday morning,
around the time when my winter
quarter angst began to develop, a
light bulb went off in my head: Win
ter Quarter was something I want
ed to be over as soon as possible, so
much so that I immediately jumped
on board the "spring quarter is
going to be so much better" band
wagon and believed that all of my
problems would/did go away from
the very first day of this quarter.
I've stuck with that a lot and,
while I am happier than I was last
quarter, even in my current trou
bles, I only realized then how I seg
mented my life between the quar
ters, and how naive that was.
I shared this with one of my best
friends the one with whom I'd re
solved to make spring quarter reso
lutions and who also had an emo
tionally difficult winter quarter.
While I rarely use quotes in my
columns, her words were too beauti
ful not to share. "We wanted to be

lieve in the severance between
quarters too badly. Momentum
blinded us, protected us. But a con
structed narrative can't register
contradictions; once a hole in our
story is exposed, everything else dis
places itself. We can't locate the pre
cise moments that produce sadness
because the origins are structural.
All the shit that I've relegated to the
past, neutralized with false symbol
ism, hasn't evaporated — it under
girds the whole system, hostile and
silent," she said. And it seemed that
while one level of my consciousness
allowed me to exist in my fantasy
world, a deeper level never stopped
acknowledging my former anguish
and anxiety, caused me this recent
depression and refused to let go
until I recognized it myself.
"So we were shocked into recog
nition of winter's lovely traces. So
we're forced into consciousness.
Then what happens now? This time
we can't take refuge in compart
mentalization — clearly that was a
little counter-productive. But how
do we move forward?" my friend
asked.

And that's what I'm wondering
now.
I've already spoken to my teach
ers and professors and one thing
that I've come to love about the
University in the past week is how
accommodating the faculty is with
extensions and the number of re
sources available as safety nets. In
the worst-case scenario, if I were
not able to complete any more as
signments the rest of the year, there
are structures like taking an incom
plete that would not prevent me
from graduating on time, from con
tinuing to do well, etc. And though
I'm fairly sure this won't be the case
for me, knowing that I could do this
takes off a load of stress.
For now, I've scheduled an ap
pointment with CAPS, plan to take
a mental health day over the week
end by going to the beach with
some friends who also appreciate
solitude and continue to work on
my assignments one piece at a time,
but I still don't know: how do I
move forward?

Are you having trouble moving for

popped? Do you have advice for

Sometime within the past week,
I got derailed. On Sunday
evening, I felt an overwhelm
ing desire to crumple into my room
mate's futon and devolve into a hot
mess of tears. In the time since then,
I've had an overwhelming sense of
sadness not overwhelming in
that I don't feel happy, but in the
sense that even when I have high
highs, like seeing Mae Jemison,
being accepted into Sophomore
College and finalizing housing pref
erences for next year with my won
derful "drawmies," I return to this
low state of emptiness and confu
sion. No matter how urgent my as
signments were, I could not bring
myself to complete them I'd read
the same sentence repeatedly with
out comprehending it, and when I
could get moving, it would be very
slowly. My side of the room has be
come a heap of clothes, books and
folders, and I've been staying up
late, agonizing about my work, but
not doing anything about it.
I've always spent a lot of time re
flecting about how I feel, why I feel
that way and how those feelings in
fluence my thoughts and actions.
I've rarely not been able to explain
my feelings, even when I'm sad. My
distress was puzzling, though, be
cause I couldn't attribute it to any
one thing, or even a conglomera
tion of things.
In an effort to shed some light
on how I arrived in this state, I de
cided to start rereading and digitiz
ing my journal. I usually run
through a 240 page Moleskine
notebook (no, I did not have to
specify that I use Moleskines; yes, I
am slightly pretentious, but they
make me happy) in about two or
three months, but given my infre
quency of writing in these fast
paced months, I discovered on
Monday night that I still haven't
finished a journal I started on No
vember 28, 2010. This date coin
cides with my first trips home and

back to Stanford, Winter Break and
my evaluation of fall quarter/re
assessment of my priorities for the
winter, my hopes for 2011 and fears
