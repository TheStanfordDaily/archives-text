## Using My Faculties 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
Two summers ago, I landed my
first research assistantship
with a professor. After hear
ing about his expertise in the field, I
only became more nervous about
our fateful first meeting. On that
day, I was literally shaking when I
walked into his office, and this was
already after I stood outside his
door for five minutes taking deep
breaths in order to regulate my
breathing. I still wonder what he
must've thought when I advanced
meekly into his office and intro
duced myself in a quavering voice.
And now, as I look back on it, he was
probably thinking, "What's wrong
with herT

I was terrified, and this is be
cause I've always regarded teachers
and professors as an elite group far
removed from their students. All of
this is strange in light of the fact
that, well, my dad is a university
professor. You think I would've
grown up with the notion that pro
fessors have homes and families just
like everyone else even as they give
you grades and write recommenda-

tion letters that could determine
your entire future.
Rather, I was one of those kids
who, in my single digit ages, did
think that the teachers lived at
school. Where else would they go?
It made complete sense to me at the
time. And then in middle school, I
experienced the first of my revela
tions. One of my best friends in sixth
grade was the daughter of our sci
ence teacher. And if she had a
house, that meant that her father
had to live in that house with her.
Therefore, because she did not live
at our middle school, her father had
to live in a house that was not our
middle school. Q.E.D.
Armed with the knowledge that
teachers lived in residences sepa

rate from their classrooms, I went to
high school. But even if they didn't
sleep at their desks, teachers were
still not people to befriend. One of
my absolute favorite teachers had a
habit of calling me an idiot, ridicul
ing my attempts at programming in
Java and making plenty of jokes at
my expense. But I never would've
shot back with a retort the way I
would've with a friend. Even with
this informality, which I completely
enjoyed, I would still never have
brought myself to retaliate. It just
wasn't allowed.
As a result, even in college I still
regarded professors as a completely
separate and elite class of people.
These were the foremost minds of
our day, the premier academics of
our age, and I was just the under
graduate wasting their time. The
more well known or senior the pro
fessor, the more terrified and intim
idated I became. I resented the stu
dents who could chat with a profes
sor easily and without a trace of

fear, but I could not bring myself to
emulate their behavior.

Unsurprisingly, it was Facebook
that helped me overcome my prob
lems. I first friended a professor on
Facebook during my sophomore
year. The class was in a 300-person
lecture hall, so I knew that my iden
tity would still be anonymous. And
after perusing some pictures of my
professor from her fourth grade
class and seeing what kinds of
music she liked, I began to internal
ize a key realization: professors
aren't demigods or some other kind
of superior beings.
It took me nearly two years into
my student career before I was able
to fully act upon this revelation. I
slowly, tentatively began to work on
my level of social ease with profes
sors. And I realized that it is possi
ble for a certain kind of friendship
to happen between students and
professors. Most importantly, it fi
nally struck me that professors
don't dismiss undergraduates as
stupid, immature children; they
may want to talk to us just as much
as we want to learn from them. I
learned this two summers ago as I
met with my professor and we
talked about my research project.
He liked my ideas, and I was pleas

antly surprised when the professor
I held in such high regard found my
work valuable.
Now, I'm quite comfortable with
the notion of student-professor in
teraction. But there are, of course,
always limitations. You're never
quite friends with your professor
the way you're friends with your
college roommate, and I'm never
sure when to try to take the extra
step. Do I invite a professor out to
lunch? Do I post on his Facebook
profile? Can I be sarcastic with a
professor? How do I balance the re
spect I feel for a professor with the
informality of friendship?
The delicate balance between
professor-friendship and peer
friendship is best explained with a
story. One time, during a break in a
small seminar class, my professor
and I walked out of class together
and soon realized we were both
headed to the restroom. Talk about
"awkward." We made small talk
about some academic paper until
we arrived, at which point conver
sation promptly halted and was
only revived when we were wash
ing our hands. With a friend, I
might've chatted all the way
through. But again, this wasn't just
my friend down the hall. It was my
professor. And the rules aren't
quite the same.

Miriam wonders, if any of her profes
sors read this, will they email her?
