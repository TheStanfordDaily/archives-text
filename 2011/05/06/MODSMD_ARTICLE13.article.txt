## My Journey from Stanford to Semiconductors 
### 
Have you ever wanted to
work on cutting-edge tech
nology, while getting paid to
travel around the world? Would
you enjoy applying your science
and engineering knowledge to solv
ing the challenge of manufacturing
the semiconductor chips inside your
smart phone, laptop or game con
sole? If you nodded yes to either of
these questions, you will want to
read about my career path at KLA-
Tencor after graduate school.
I truly enjoyed solving scientific
problems when I was pursuing my
Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford. Yet,
I was also eager to see my hard
work have a more immediate im
pact. Unfortunately, certain kinds of

scientific research do not lend
themselves to instant returns. I de
cided to change my career path. I
left academic research to become
an applications development engi
neer in the semiconductor industry.
I was very excited about the deci
sion, but also quite nervous. Even
though I had spent my graduate
school years in the middle of the Sil
icon Valley, I had only a textbook
understanding of how semiconduc
tors work. But the hiring team con
vinced me that while semiconduc
tor knowledge was something I
could learn on the job, it was the
critical thinking skills I gained in
graduate school that were just as
important. So, off I went!

KLA-Tencor is a semiconductor
equipment manufacturer. Our
products help chipmakers manage
"yield" (the percentage of finished
chips that are usable) throughout
the entire wafer fabrication process,
from research and development
(R&D) to the final product. In a re
cent edition of The Stanford Daily,
my colleague, Mark Roulo, gave an
overview on the responsibilities of
the mechanical, optical, electrical,
software and algorithm engineers
involved in the development of our
products. How do application
"apps" engineers fit in the picture?
We are the liaison between the fab
