# CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP
## My Journey from Stanford to Semiconductors 
### 
Have you ever wanted to
work on cutting-edge tech
nology, while getting paid to
travel around the world? Would
you enjoy applying your science
and engineering knowledge to solv
ing the challenge of manufacturing
the semiconductor chips inside your
smart phone, laptop or game con
sole? If you nodded yes to either of
these questions, you will want to
read about my career path at KLA-
Tencor after graduate school.
I truly enjoyed solving scientific
problems when I was pursuing my
Ph.D. in Chemistry at Stanford. Yet,
I was also eager to see my hard
work have a more immediate im
pact. Unfortunately, certain kinds of

scientific research do not lend
themselves to instant returns. I de
cided to change my career path. I
left academic research to become
an applications development engi
neer in the semiconductor industry.
I was very excited about the deci
sion, but also quite nervous. Even
though I had spent my graduate
school years in the middle of the Sil
icon Valley, I had only a textbook
understanding of how semiconduc
tors work. But the hiring team con
vinced me that while semiconduc
tor knowledge was something I
could learn on the job, it was the
critical thinking skills I gained in
graduate school that were just as
important. So, off I went!

KLA-Tencor is a semiconductor
equipment manufacturer. Our
products help chipmakers manage
"yield" (the percentage of finished
chips that are usable) throughout
the entire wafer fabrication process,
from research and development
(R&D) to the final product. In a re
cent edition of The Stanford Daily,
my colleague, Mark Roulo, gave an
overview on the responsibilities of
the mechanical, optical, electrical,
software and algorithm engineers
involved in the development of our
products. How do application
"apps" engineers fit in the picture?
We are the liaison between the fab
rication (or "fab") customers and
our internal R&D group. KLA-
Tencor has customers around the
world and apps engineers work di
rectly with the customers to find the
defects causing yield losses at dif
ferent stages of the chip manufac
turing process. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our equipment in
order to show the customer how
they can improve their processes.
The effect of our work can be im
mediate such as helping a chip man
ufacturer increase its yield in order
to meet the demand for the latest
gadget for the next holiday season.
Our work can also have more long
term impact by improving the chip
manufacturing process in ways that
can last for years. Technical knowl
edge of our products, along with a
deep understanding of chip fabrica
tion, is essential to solving our cus
tomers' problems. Interpersonal
skills, knowledge of the competi
tion's capabilities, as well as an un
derstanding of our customers' busi
ness dynamics are all critical in pro
moting and selling our products.
What is the interaction between
our R&D team and other business
oriented functional groups, includ
ing marketing and sales? In work
ing face-to-face with our customers,
apps engineers get first-hand expo
sure of the latest challenges en
countered by our customers and
what role our tools played in solv
ing them. This information is criti
cal in guiding our engineering ef
forts and informing the marketing
strategies of current and next gen

eration products. Apps engineers
represent the customers in the de
velopment of our products. Our in
volvement begins in product defini
tion and prototype testing, runs
through the later stages of detailed
characterization all the way to
product demonstrations for cus
tomers. Our effort can have a tangi
ble effect on convincing customers
to purchase our products. As listed
in our job title, "we develop the ap
plications of the products." Our
role is essential in making sure
KLA-Tencor products show real
value to customers, a crucial neces
sity in today's dynamic business en
vironment.
In the past three years, I have en
joyed the daily challenges I have
faced both on the customers' home
turf or back in the office with the in
ternal teams. The analytical and
project management skills I gained
as a graduate student at Stanford
are put in practice every day. Work
ing in a unique position, interacting
with both customers and the engi
neers and business people of KLA-
Tencor, I have expanded my career
tremendously. I am surrounded by
incredibly smart people from all
over the world. While enjoying the
experience of being an apps engi
neer, I have also opened the doors
to all kinds of opportunities that I
would not have known about prior
to my journey at KLA-Tencor.

cent edition of The Stanford Daily,
my colleague, Mark Roulo, gave an
overview on the responsibilities of
the mechanical, optical, electrical,
software and algorithm engineers
involved in the development of our
products. How do application
"apps" engineers fit in the picture?
We are the liaison between the fab
rication (or "fab") customers and
our internal R&D group. KLA-
Tencor has customers around the
world and apps engineers work di
rectly with the customers to find the
defects causing yield losses at dif
ferent stages of the chip manufac
turing process. We demonstrate the
capabilities of our equipment in
order to show the customer how
they can improve their processes.
The effect of our work can be im
mediate such as helping a chip man
ufacturer increase its yield in order
to meet the demand for the latest
gadget for the next holiday season.
Our work can also have more long
term impact by improving the chip
manufacturing process in ways that
can last for years. Technical knowl
edge of our products, along with a
deep understanding of chip fabrica
tion, is essential to solving our cus
tomers' problems. Interpersonal
skills, knowledge of the competi
tion's capabilities, as well as an un
derstanding of our customers' busi
ness dynamics are all critical in pro
moting and selling our products.
What is the interaction between
our R&D team and other business
oriented functional groups, includ
ing marketing and sales? In work
ing face-to-face with our customers,
apps engineers get first-hand expo
sure of the latest challenges en
countered by our customers and
what role our tools played in solv
ing them. This information is criti
cal in guiding our engineering ef
forts and informing the marketing
strategies of current and next gen

eration products. Apps engineers
represent the customers in the de
velopment of our products. Our in
volvement begins in product defini
tion and prototype testing, runs
through the later stages of detailed
characterization all the way to
product demonstrations for cus
tomers. Our effort can have a tangi
ble effect on convincing customers
to purchase our products. As listed
in our job title, "we develop the ap
plications of the products." Our
role is essential in making sure
KLA-Tencor products show real
value to customers, a crucial neces
sity in today's dynamic business en
vironment.
In the past three years, I have en
joyed the daily challenges I have
faced both on the customers' home
turf or back in the office with the in
ternal teams. The analytical and
project management skills I gained
as a graduate student at Stanford
are put in practice every day. Work
ing in a unique position, interacting
with both customers and the engi
neers and business people of KLA-
Tencor, I have expanded my career
tremendously. I am surrounded by
incredibly smart people from all
over the world. While enjoying the
experience of being an apps engi
neer, I have also opened the doors
to all kinds of opportunities that I
would not have known about prior
to my journey at KLA-Tencor.
