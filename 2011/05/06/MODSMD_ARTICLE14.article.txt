## OREGON EXPRESS CARD HITS ROAD FOR CRUCIAL SERIES 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off its first series win over
Washington in several years, the
Stanford Softball team will hit the
road this weekend for a crucial
Pac-10 showdown with Oregon.
The Cardinal and the Ducks are
separated by just a game in the
crowded conference standings,
with Stanford tied for third place
and Oregon tied for fifth.
After dispatching the Huskies
with a 3-1 win in the series finale last
Sunday, the No. 10 Cardinal (36-11,
8-7 Pac-10) maintained the momen
tum with a 12-0 midweek victory
over struggling Santa Clara. The
Broncos (6-29) were outmatched
and overpowered by senior pitcher
Ashley Chinn, who twirled her fifth
shutout of the season and improved
to 16-3 with a miniscule 1.99 ERA in
26 appearances.

Stanford head coach John
Rittman will likely turn to sopho
more Teagan Gerhart tonight in
the series opener. The Cardinal
ace has rebounded nicely from an
arm injury that shut her down for
the latter half of last season, al

ready topping the 20-win plateau
for the second time in her career.
Gerhart's 1.61 ERA is third in the
Pac-10, and she is also fourth in
wins and third in strikeouts.

She will have to be in top form to
slow down the No. 12 Ducks, who
have won five of their last six
games. Oregon swept rival Oregon
State at home in Eugene two week
ends ago before nearly sweeping
then-No. 9 Arizona on the road.

Oregon head coach Mike
White has gotten inspired play
from sophomore pitcher Jessica
Moore, as well as junior Kelsey
Chambers. Moore is 18-7 in the cir
cle and will in all likelihood square
off with Gerhart tonight, while
Chambers added to her team
leading home run total with two
against the Wildcats.
"This weekend it will be very
important to come out each day
with a lot of energy in order to take
the series," said sophomore second
baseman Jenna Rich.

The Cardinal had plenty of en
ergy against Santa Clara, when
Rich hit her team-leading ninth
home run of the year and Stanford
stole two bases to tie the single-sea
son team record, set last year at 82.
Rich's double-play partner, jun
ior shortstop Ashley Hansen, has
cooled off a bit the two-time All-
American's batting average is

down a couple of points to an oth
erworldly .486, still good enough to
lead the Pac-10 by thirty points.
Hansen was recently one of 25
players named to USA Softball's
National Collegiate Player of the
Year watch list. She leads the na
tion in doubles per game and is
fifth in batting average.

But one of the real difference
makers this season for the Cardi
nal has been the improvement of
junior Sarah Hassman.The speedy
outfielder sets the table in front of
Hansen and Rich and has been
doing it at a very impressive clip,
bumping her batting average up
.140 points over last year to .411
with a .517 on-base percentage.

Hassman has also been a
demon on the base paths, with a
Pac-10-leading 31 steals in just 33
attempts, letting the heart of the
Stanford lineup rack up RBI.

If the offense can maintain its
record-setting pace —no Stan
ford Softball team has hit over .300
for a season and this year's squad
is currently sitting at .317 the
Cardinal should be in good shape
to win its fourth series of the year
at a critical time of the season
After this weekend's series at
Oregon, Stanford visits Arizona
State in the last three games of the
year before the NCAA Regionals
begin on Thursday, May 19. The

Cardinal is still in position to pos
sibly host a regional site, as it did
last season, which would be a big
boost for Stanford's hopes for
Women's College World Series.
"At this point in the season, we
can't afford to give any games
away," Rich said. "Our team will
need to gain all the momentum we
can going into the postseason.
First pitch against the Ducks is
scheduled for 6 p.m. tonight, with a
2 p.m. start on Saturday and 12
p.m. finale on Sunday.

Fresh off its first series win over
Washington in several years, the
Stanford Softball team will hit the
road this weekend for a crucial
Pac-10 showdown with Oregon.
The Cardinal and the Ducks are
separated by just a game in the
crowded conference standings,
with Stanford tied for third place
and Oregon tied for fifth.
After dispatching the Huskies
with a 3-1 win in the series finale last
Sunday, the No. 10 Cardinal (36-11,
8-7 Pac-10) maintained the momen
tum with a 12-0 midweek victory
over struggling Santa Clara. The
Broncos (6-29) were outmatched
and overpowered by senior pitcher
Ashley Chinn, who twirled her fifth
shutout of the season and improved
to 16-3 with a miniscule 1.99 ERA in
26 appearances.

Stanford head coach John
Rittman will likely turn to sopho
more Teagan Gerhart tonight in
the series opener. The Cardinal
ace has rebounded nicely from an
arm injury that shut her down for
the latter half of last season, al

ready topping the 20-win plateau
for the second time in her career.
Gerhart's 1.61 ERA is third in the
Pac-10, and she is also fourth in
wins and third in strikeouts.

She will have to be in top form to
slow down the No. 12 Ducks, who
have won five of their last six
games. Oregon swept rival Oregon
State at home in Eugene two week
ends ago before nearly sweeping
then-No. 9 Arizona on the road.

Oregon head coach Mike
White has gotten inspired play
from sophomore pitcher Jessica
Moore, as well as junior Kelsey
Chambers. Moore is 18-7 in the cir
cle and will in all likelihood square
off with Gerhart tonight, while
Chambers added to her team
leading home run total with two
against the Wildcats.
"This weekend it will be very
important to come out each day
with a lot of energy in order to take
the series," said sophomore second
baseman Jenna Rich.

The Cardinal had plenty of en
ergy against Santa Clara, when
Rich hit her team-leading ninth
home run of the year and Stanford
stole two bases to tie the single-sea
son team record, set last year at 82.
Rich's double-play partner, jun
ior shortstop Ashley Hansen, has
cooled off a bit the two-time All-
American's batting average is

down a couple of points to an oth
erworldly .486, still good enough to
lead the Pac-10 by thirty points.
Hansen was recently one of 25
players named to USA Softball's
National Collegiate Player of the
Year watch list. She leads the na
tion in doubles per game and is
fifth in batting average.

But one of the real difference
makers this season for the Cardi
nal has been the improvement of
junior Sarah Hassman.The speedy
outfielder sets the table in front of
Hansen and Rich and has been
doing it at a very impressive clip,
bumping her batting average up
.140 points over last year to .411
with a .517 on-base percentage.

Hassman has also been a
demon on the base paths, with a
Pac-10-leading 31 steals in just 33
attempts, letting the heart of the
Stanford lineup rack up RBI.

If the offense can maintain its
record-setting pace —no Stan
ford Softball team has hit over .300
for a season and this year's squad
is currently sitting at .317 the
Cardinal should be in good shape
to win its fourth series of the year
at a critical time of the season
After this weekend's series at
Oregon, Stanford visits Arizona
State in the last three games of the
year before the NCAA Regionals
begin on Thursday, May 19. The

Cardinal is still in position to pos
sibly host a regional site, as it did
last season, which would be a big
boost for Stanford's hopes for
Women's College World Series.
"At this point in the season, we
can't afford to give any games
away," Rich said. "Our team will
need to gain all the momentum we
can going into the postseason.
First pitch against the Ducks is
scheduled for 6 p.m. tonight, with a
2 p.m. start on Saturday and 12
p.m. finale on Sunday.
