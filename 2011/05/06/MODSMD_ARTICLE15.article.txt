It's a name you don't often hear

doesn't get much playing time.
She hardly plays inside the
main stadium. But ask anyone
on the women's tennis team who the
glue of the squad is, and they won't
hesitate before naming senior Jen
nifer Yen as the person who truly
unites the team.
"We call her the glue on the team,"
said sophomore Mallory Burdette.
"That's kind of been our thing with

her this year. She's our glue."
A local girl from just across the

Senior Jennifer Yen (at right) is regarded by many of
her teammates as the "glue" of the squad. The
Freemont, Calif, native has appeared in just ten
matches this year, but continues to leave her mark
in the locker room.
rounded person who is a pleasure
to spend time with.
"To Jen, Stanford is just the per
fect place," Burdette detailed. "She
has so many different sides to her.
Stanford, I think, allows her to
bring out all those sides of her. If I
could say anyone is the epitome of
a Stanford student, I would say that
is Jen."
Fellow senior Hilary Barte is
one of the girls who has known Yen
the longest, and their friendship has
deepened to the point where they
have nicknames for each other that
describe exactly how much each
person cares about the other.
"She might get mad at me for
telling you this, but I actually call
her kidney sister," Barte said. "If I
needed a kidney, she would give it
to me and if she needed one, I
would give it to her. That captures
the relationship. She is the best and
truest friend I could have asked
for."
Everyone has experienced the
uncertainty that comes with fresh
man fall quarter, and it is out of that
uncertainty that Barte and Yen's
friendship developed. Yen stepped
up to stay at Barte's side when she
needed her most.
"Freshman year, we had our
physicals and it turned out I had
something that needed attention,"
Barte explained. "I had to go to all
these meetings really early in the
morning. She [Yen] voluntarily
came to all of them with me. From
then on, I knew right away that she
was a real friend I could count on
for life," she said. "I can't say
enough good things about her. She
saved me so many times through
out Stanford that I feel forever in
debted to her."
The roster's third senior, Car
olyn McVeigh, chose her words
carefully when describing Yen and
her interactions with teammates
and friends.
"The first word would have to be
compassionate," McVeigh said.
"She's always forward looking and
really aware of how everyone else is
doing. She's trying to make sure
everyone else is doing well before
she takes care of herself. She cares a
ton about the team and her friends.
"Genuine is another," McVeigh
continued. "She's just very true to
herself. She says what she means
and she's one of those honest peo
ple, She's always herself and never

tries to change her behavior de
pending on whom she's with. She's
true to her identity and her goals."
Burdette points out Yen's calm
confidence as one thing she gets the
most strength from.
"Regardless of whether she
plays or not, I feel like one of the
greatest things about Jen is that she
stays calm throughout everything,"
Burdette explained. "No matter
what's happening, whether things
are really tense out on the court or
tense off the court, you can always
look to Jen and see someone who is
relaxed. That's huge to have some
one like that on our team."
On a personal level, Burdette
says she has learned from Yen to
not be as harsh on herself and oth
ers in all areas of her life. Yen can
see all sides to a problem and has a
greater capacity to forgive than
most.
"She's just very understanding
and she sees things from all sides,"
Burdette said. "That's one of the
biggest things I've learned from
Jen. I'm not nearly as good at it as
she is, but as a leader, as a captain,
she just sees things from all sides.
She has a very good understanding
of where everyone stands and
what's really going on."
Yen is the figure on the team
that the girls go to first for support
in all matters, tennis or not.
"She's just absolutely invalu
able," Barte said. "We wouldn't be a
team without her. She puts in so
much effort, emotionally and phys
ically, but I think more than any
thing, we all know we can always
count on her. No matter what your
problem is, she is the first person to
call you and ask if you're alright, to
be there and give you a hug, or just
be there with you," she said. "She
[Yen] is absolutely pivotal to the
team."
With graduation almost upon
the three seniors, they have started
to consider the uncomfortable idea
of being apart. However, both
Barte and McVeigh expressed their
absolute certainty that multiple
decades later, their friendship will
be as strong as it is today.
"Jen is going to be one of my life
long friends," McVeigh said with a
laugh. "It's cheesy, but I can't imag
ine going a year without seeing her.
I will definitely stay in touch with
her until we're in our 60s and 70s,
wearing our Stanford tennis shirts
in the crowd acting ridiculous and
loving Stanford. Our relationship is
unbreakable."

fect place," Burdette detailed. "She
has so many different sides to her.
Stanford, I think, allows her to
bring out all those sides of her. If I
could say anyone is the epitome of
a Stanford student, I would say that
is Jen."
Fellow senior Hilary Barte is
one of the girls who has known Yen
the longest, and their friendship has
deepened to the point where they
have nicknames for each other that
describe exactly how much each
person cares about the other.
"She might get mad at me for
telling you this, but I actually call
her kidney sister," Barte said. "If I
needed a kidney, she would give it
to me and if she needed one, I
would give it to her. That captures
the relationship. She is the best and
truest friend I could have asked
for."
Everyone has experienced the
uncertainty that comes with fresh
man fall quarter, and it is out of that
uncertainty that Barte and Yen's
friendship developed. Yen stepped
up to stay at Barte's side when she
needed her most.
"Freshman year, we had our
physicals and it turned out I had
something that needed attention,"
Barte explained. "I had to go to all
these meetings really early in the
morning. She [Yen] voluntarily
came to all of them with me. From
then on, I knew right away that she
was a real friend I could count on
for life," she said. "I can't say
enough good things about her. She
saved me so many times through
out Stanford that I feel forever in
debted to her."
The roster's third senior, Car
olyn McVeigh, chose her words
carefully when describing Yen and
her interactions with teammates
and friends.
"The first word would have to be
compassionate," McVeigh said.
"She's always forward looking and
really aware of how everyone else is
doing. She's trying to make sure
everyone else is doing well before
she takes care of herself. She cares a
ton about the team and her friends.
"Genuine is another," McVeigh
continued. "She's just very true to
herself. She says what she means
and she's one of those honest peo
ple, She's always herself and never

tries to change her behavior de
pending on whom she's with. She's
true to her identity and her goals."
Burdette points out Yen's calm
confidence as one thing she gets the
most strength from.
"Regardless of whether she
plays or not, I feel like one of the
greatest things about Jen is that she
stays calm throughout everything,"
Burdette explained. "No matter
what's happening, whether things
are really tense out on the court or
tense off the court, you can always
look to Jen and see someone who is
relaxed. That's huge to have some
one like that on our team."
On a personal level, Burdette
says she has learned from Yen to
not be as harsh on herself and oth
ers in all areas of her life. Yen can
see all sides to a problem and has a
greater capacity to forgive than
most.
"She's just very understanding
and she sees things from all sides,"
Burdette said. "That's one of the
biggest things I've learned from
Jen. I'm not nearly as good at it as
she is, but as a leader, as a captain,
she just sees things from all sides.
She has a very good understanding
of where everyone stands and
what's really going on."
Yen is the figure on the team
that the girls go to first for support
in all matters, tennis or not.
"She's just absolutely invalu
able," Barte said. "We wouldn't be a
team without her. She puts in so
much effort, emotionally and phys
ically, but I think more than any
thing, we all know we can always
count on her. No matter what your
problem is, she is the first person to
call you and ask if you're alright, to
be there and give you a hug, or just
be there with you," she said. "She
[Yen] is absolutely pivotal to the
team."
With graduation almost upon
the three seniors, they have started
to consider the uncomfortable idea
of being apart. However, both
Barte and McVeigh expressed their
absolute certainty that multiple
decades later, their friendship will
be as strong as it is today.
"Jen is going to be one of my life
long friends," McVeigh said with a
laugh. "It's cheesy, but I can't imag
ine going a year without seeing her.
I will definitely stay in touch with
her until we're in our 60s and 70s,
wearing our Stanford tennis shirts
in the crowd acting ridiculous and
loving Stanford. Our relationship is
unbreakable."

It's a name you don't often hear
in the recaps and highlights. She
doesn't get much playing time.
She hardly plays inside the
main stadium. But ask anyone
on the women's tennis team who the
glue of the squad is, and they won't
hesitate before naming senior Jen
nifer Yen as the person who truly
unites the team.
"We call her the glue on the team,"
said sophomore Mallory Burdette.
"That's kind of been our thing with

her this year. She's our glue."
A local girl from just across the
Bay in Fremont, Yen has a love for
her product design curriculum,
something which her teammates
say she has a lot of natural talent
for. Product design classes
combined with a devotion to her
religion and her team make
Yen one of those ideal Stan- ?
ford candidates, a well- JL
