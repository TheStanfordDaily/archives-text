# Sports not immune to tragedy
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I've been feeling a bit conflicted
watching the news this week.That
Osama bin Laden was a very, very
nasty man is unquestionable
he had the blood of many inno
cent people on his hands but the re
sponse to his demise has left me feeling
a little uncomfortable.

It would obviously have been far
better to have captured him alive, be
cause the U.S. could have brought him
to real justice in a civilized court of law
and shown everyone around the world
what American values really are. And
though it should still be viewed as a
good thing that he is no longer free to
cause death and destruction, I can't help
feeling that we should be celebrating his
death with a little less fervor and paying
a little less attention to the grim details.
I often feel the same way when it
comes to sports. That particular world is
one of entertainment rather that reality,
but it still has its fair share of villains
from real cheats to simply those players
or teams who are just too good and
know it. However much you dislike
them, though, the good thing is that in
sports, everyone eventually gets their
comeuppance losing a crucial game,
making a stupid mistake, getting caught
out or, at the very least, time finally
catching up with them and their once
impressive skills losing their shine.
But there is a big difference between
that and injury. I think most well-in
formed fans know that, and it's always a
heartwarming feeling when a stadium
full of supporters applaud an injured
player opposing or not â€”as they
move off the pitch. For a brief moment,
all bad feelings are put aside as every
one shows their respect, if not for the
player's skills, then at least for the com
mitment to the cause and the price paid
for that.

The human craving for the morbid
truth is strong, though. Even if you can
claim not to have done it yourself,
everyone has seen the cars slowing
down to have a good look at a road ac
cident, and tabloid newspapers make a
living out of exposing the murky se
crets of celebrities' private lives.
When it comes to auto-racing it's
hard to say that crashes don't make
races more exciting, and slow-mo
tion replays of tackles in contact
sports are a prerequisite of any live
coverage.
However, I can unfortunately
claim to have seen two people die, or
at least get fatally injured, live on TV,
and they are without question my
worst sports memories.
The first incident was when For
mula 1 World Champion Ayrton
Senna crashed at the lead of the 1994
San Marino Grand Prix; the second
was when Daniel Jimeno Romero
was gored at the Running of The Bulls
in Pamplona in 2009. After both, I was
scanning the screen hoping to see
some sign of optimism, but when that
didn't appear, I just switched off the
TV.

Death is a cruel reality of life, and
sports without danger wouldn't be
sports. The professionals are always

trying to go faster and hit harder, and
that attitude is what makes them so
good. At the same time, as fans, we
want to know what they are doing
and how they are doing it, and we
need the slow-motion replays and
exhaustive analysis just to keep up.
We also want to be able to endlessly
debate the legality of plays and tack
les, and in so doing we cross over into
the territory of occasionally watch
ing and re-watching some horrific
injuries.
As someone who has broken

bones and had surgery to fix sports
injuries, I can't help but wince every
time anyone even looks like they
have a serious injury something
all too familiar in soccer, not be
cause of its inherent dangers but be
cause there is often just a little bit of
faking. I'll happily laugh when an
opposing player is unfairly sent off
or reprimanded by the referee, but
physical injury is a whole different
ballpark.
My team winning is always a
great result, but how it wins, and the
consequences for those involved,
are what really count. Bad news
sells, but there is a reason I always
start reading a newspaper from the
back. As Earl Warren once said,
"The sports section records peoples'
accomplishments; the front page
nothing but man's failures." Reading
about sports should be inspiring, so
please spare me the grisly analysis.

Tom Taylor failed to mention that
several of the "sports injuries" he
claims to have suffered were paper
cuts from shuffling his deck of cards
in preparation for the Cribbage
World Championships. To pick his
brain about"Muggins" hit him up at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.

"Sports
without danger
wouldn't be
sports."
