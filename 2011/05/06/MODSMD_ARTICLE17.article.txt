# Sports not immune to tragedy

I've been feeling a bit conflicted
watching the news this week.That
Osama bin Laden was a very, very
nasty man is unquestionable
he had the blood of many inno

a little uncomfortable.

It would obviously have been far

player opposing or not â€”as they

all bad feelings are put aside as every
one shows their respect, if not for the
player's skills, then at least for the com

for that.

The human craving for the morbid
truth is strong, though. Even if you can
claim not to have done it yourself,
everyone has seen the cars slowing
down to have a good look at a road ac
cident, and tabloid newspapers make a
