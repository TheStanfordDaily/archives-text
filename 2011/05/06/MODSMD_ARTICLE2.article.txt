# TIME TO MAKE A MOVE
## Stanford still searching for a spark 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN 
If ever there was a time for the
Stanford baseball team to make a
run, the time is now. The seventh
place Cardinal will host last-place
Washington for a three-game series
this weekend at Sunken Diamond,
where it will have a chance to make
up some serious ground in the Pac-10
standings.

The No. 28 Cardinal (22-16, 6-9
Pac-10) comes into the series with a
bit of confidence, having beaten San
Jose State 3-1 on Tuesday a nice
rebound after dropping two of three
to Arizona State in the desert last
weekend. Stanford was propelled by
a strong outing by sophomore starter
Dean McArdle (6-2), who struck out
four and allowed only five baserun
ners in five and a third innings. It was
McArdle's longest outing since he
went six and two-thirds on April 3,
when the Cardinal defeated Wash
ington State for Coach Mark Mar
quess' 1400 th career victory Stan
ford is hoping that this is a sign of
things to come.

Washington (13-27, 4-11) comes
into the series with a sense of ur
gency the Huskies dropped two of
three at archrival Washington State
over the weekend and have lost
seven of ten overall. They did man
age to win the series finale in Pull
man, scratching out a 6-5 victory be
hind six and two-thirds innings of
strong relief by senior righthander
Jacob Clem. It was a rare bright spot
for coach Lindsay Meggs in what has
been a tough season from the start.
Washington hasn't won a series since
taking two of three from the Oregon
Ducks in early April, and the
Huskies have won just one other se
ries over the course of the entire sea-

son, when they took two of three
from Nevada in late March.

For the Cardinal, this season has
been a tale of home and away. Stan
ford boasts an outstanding 12-5
record at home, but is just 10-11 on
the roOad, perhaps a sign of the
team's youth (the Cardinal starts just
one upperclassman in its everyday
lineup). During its last homestand,
Stanford took two of three from

UCLA and then defeated Cal in a
non-conference game, despite the
fact that both teams currently reside
ahead of the Cardinal in the Pac-10
standings. Especially noticeable in
the contrast between Stanford's
home and away games this season
has been the team's success in close
games in games decided by one
run this season, Stanford is 4-1 at
home but just 1-4 on the road.
In order for the Cardinal to con
tinue its success at the Sunken Dia
mond, it will need sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty and sen
ior catcher Zach Jones to continue to
produce. Piscotty leads the team in
batting average (.356), slugging per
centage (.470) and on-base percent
age (.410), and he is third in RBI
(24). Jones leads the team in home
runs with four and has 25 RBI this
season, which all came in the past 23
games.
In addition to Piscotty and Jones,
the Cardinal will look to its vaunted
sophomore class to set the table.
Centerfielder Jake Stewart leads the
team with fourteen doubles and
seven stolen bases and is second in
total bases with 62, while left-fielder
Tyler Gaffney is second on the team
in on-base percentage (.403). Addi
tionally, Stanford hopes that slump
ing shortstop Kenny Diekroeger will
find the form that made him a fresh
man All-American a year ago. As the
Cardinal's bats have gone this sea
son, so has the Cardinal Stanford
is 15-3 when scoring five runs or
more this year.
Looking for redemption will be

NOTES ! With five games in the next five days,
the No. 28 baseball team will need efficient
pitching performances if it is to move up in the
