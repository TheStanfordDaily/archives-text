## SONGS ABOUT MOMS 
### 
With Mother's Day this Sunday (did you forget?),
Intermission decided it was a good time to scroll through
our iPods and dig up our favorite mom-related songs (Hello,
Spice Girls!).

"Motherlover" â€”Andy Samberg &
Justin Timberlake
This sequel to "Dick in a Box" was possibly the greatest
Mother's Day gift "Saturday Night Live" has ever given us.

"Stacy's Mom" Fountains of Wayne
It's the song that probably has an embarrassingly high play
count on your iPod (especially if you're into College Humor's
"Prank Wars"). It's also the song you pray to dear God no
one's ever dedicated to your own mother.

"Dear Mama" 2pac
This song is so good that the Library of Congress is preserv
ing it in its National Recording Registry because of its cultural
significance (the more you know).

"Hey Mama" Kanye West
Even people famous for being douchebags are nice to their
moms.

"Mama" Spice Girls
Suddenly Intermission's having flashbacks to many, many
shameless viewings of "Spice World."
