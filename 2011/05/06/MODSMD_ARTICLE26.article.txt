Three years in the making, "Helplessness
Blues" can hardly be called a lazy effort
by its band, Fleet Foxes. After scrapping
the greater part of a first album, the band buck
led down with producer Phil Ek (The Shins,
Band of Horses) to turn out their sophomore
effort after they exploded onto the indie scene
in 2008. However, fans of the first album,
beware; if you're looking for a bright, folksy
album like "Fleet Foxes," this is not it. The
album is somber and introspective, more invest
ed in recreating the quality of memories and
contemplation than the pastoral atmosphere of
their first release. The vocal harmonies are sub
tler; instead of building a platform for Robin
Pecknold's lead vocals, they sound more like
ornamentation for the main melody line. Not to
say that they are not beautiful they are. In
fact, the whole album can be described as mov
ingly beautiful. But does that intrinsically make
it a good album? The argument can go both
ways, but it cannot be denied that there is some
thing to be admired in Fleet Foxes, be it their
harmonizing, their role in the resurgence of folk
or Pecknold's songwriting flair. After all, there is
something to be admired in a band like Fleet
Foxes, which is heavily influenced by folk clas
sics like Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Neil
Young, but manages to retain enough of its
character to create its own distinctive sound.
With its opening, "Montezuma," the album
sets its soul-searching tone. Pecknold's stream of
consciousness lyrics try to make sense of what
fades and what remains: "Gold teeth and gold
jewelry/Every piece of your dowry/Throw them
into the tomb with me/Bury them with my
name ." Framed in the most polished vocal har
monies of the album, Pecknold's voice sings as if
lost in thought, with the instrumentation serv
ing as the background of his mind. It's a beauti
ful opening for an album structured around the
laboriousness of its creation.
"Helplessness Blues," the single and
arguably the best track, is the pensive epitome

of the whole album. It's the finest example of
Peckold's songwriting ability, a vivid description
of the emotional turmoil following self-interro
gation regarding one's place in the world.
Through a quick, driving melody on acoustic
guitars, soft percussions and minimal har
monies, the song manages to capture the
dreamy quality of the worlds of introspection
and personal thought. It's impossible not to
associate the tune with the introspection every
Stanford student goes through at least once dur
ing his or her education: "What the heck am I
doing here?" Thankfully, the weight of the song
is alleviated by the bucolic instrumental "The
Cascades," a short, sweet track that serves as a
middle marker for the album.
An interplay of the fragility and strength of
memory, "Lorelai" comes on next. With an
opening upbeat, finger-plucking melody, the
song builds on soft percussions and a delicate
flute line, culminating in Pecknold's discreetly
sorrowful vocals. In contrast, in "The Shrine/An
Argument," he lets out a bellow in the first
minute that is stunningly honest, a vulnerable
facet of the front man which he rarely, if ever,
has revealed before.
While "Helplessness Blues" most certainly
delivers a more sophisticated sound than their
past releases the voices are crisper, the
melodies more intricate there is still no
denying the Arcadian quality of the music Fleet
Foxes makes. Underneath the philosophical
questioning in the lyrics, their acoustic music
still stands as a welcome departure from the
highly electronically focused popular music
scene. And regardless of whether beauty makes
an album, there's no denying it makes the listen
ing experience all the more enjoyable.
