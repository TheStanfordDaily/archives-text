## BIRCH STREET IS STREETS AHEAD 
### â€“ josh GLUCOFT contact josh: glucoft@stanford. edu 
Specialization is nat
ural. For example,
individuals within
a population of trout
will tend to specialize in
a different type of prey.
Focusing makes each
fish a better hunter and
increases its likelihood of
success. The same
approach has been taken
by the owners of Bistro
Elan, who have limited
the restaurant to serving
only dinner, with the
recently opened Birch
Street, which serves only

lunch. In this case, Birch Street is certainly
successful in its speciali2ation, and it offers
excellent midday fare.
The restaurant has a modern, almost
industrial Californian feel to it, with a little
commotion stemming from the dense
setup. A short wait can spring up from the
limited seating inside and handful of tables
outside, so the restaurant serves best as a
relaxed and somewhat upscale lunch with
a friend. The menu is not particularly veg
etarian friendly, however, so make sure that
friend is omnivorous.
The menu is suffused with delicious
meat options. The lamb meatballs, for
example, in the Greek Salad are mouthwa
tering. The black olives and eggplant crisps
save the salad from getting lost in the shad
ow of the flavor of the lamb, and a splash
of color from the radish slices adds to the
allure of the vegetarian half of the plate.
Likewise, the Sauteed Marinated Beef
Tenderloin literally melts on your tongue.
The dish is arranged similarly to the Greek
Salad, and its accompanying greens are not
outstanding; in both cases, they provide a
nice contrast to the meat, but the meat is
so succulent no respite is really needed.
Birch Street's seafood offerings are
fantastic. The Pan Seared Albacore Tuna is

as varied in taste as it is in
color. The dish is beautiful
to look at and a pleasure to
eat. The excitement created
by the rainbow hues of the
ingredients is fulfilled by the
strong but not overwhelm
ing presence of sweet, sour,
salty and spicy tones. The
Swedish Tartine borders on
being too rich from perhaps
too much mayonnaise, but
it is a decadent treat that is
worth the post-meal lethar
gy. The asparagus and
cucumber give just the right
amount of crunch to pair

nicely with the buttery smoothness of the
shrimp, egg and sweet pan de mie.
If you have time for more than one
course for lunch, Birch Street's starters are
worth a try. The Swedish Yellow Pea Soup
is hearty and flavorful without being too
thick thanks to the robust yellow peas and
sweet chunks of ham. A touch of Dijon
adds just the right amount of sinus-tin
gling rush and rounds out the dish very
nicely. The Chilled Cucumber Soup is
more refreshing and weather appropriate
for the next few months, although it bor
ders on being a bit too salty.
Overall, the plating at Birch Street is
phenomenal, an unfortunately rare feature
in restaurants that also manage to have an
inviting atmosphere. It's difficult to order
wrong, and the menu need not be particu
larly expansive to offer a variety of
scrumptious dishes. Focusing on lunch

allows Birch Street to deliver a solid experi
ence that is likely to improve over time.

The restaurant is "Definitely worth trying."
