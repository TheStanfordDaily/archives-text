Last Sunday, Stanford's quartet
in-residence, the St Lawrence
String Quartet, put on yet
another thrilling Sundays with the St.
Lawrence performance of Beethoven's
string trio in Eb; Schubert's enormous
string quintet in C, his last instrumen
tal work and only string quartet; and
Osvaldo Golijov's "Yiddishbbuk" for
nearly 700 people in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
One of the violinists, Scott St.
John, was away for the concert on
paternity leave. Though he left big
shoes to fill, his substitute, Mark
Fewer, took to the role admirably and
melded perfectly with the rest of the
group. Additionally, Andres Diaz, who
has played with the group many times
over the years, played second cello for
the Schubert quintet, making it the
highlight of the performance. The
third movement of the quintet was so
exciting that some members of the
audience exuberantly forgot the estab
lished rule of "don't clap in between
movements" before sinking with low
ered eyes quickly and quietly back
down to their seats.
The string trio played is designat
ed op. 3, though it was actually the
105 th piece Beethoven wrote opus
