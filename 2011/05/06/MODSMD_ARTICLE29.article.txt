cally; both composers and publishers
were historically astonishingly incon
sistent with numberings. The piece
itself was exhilarating to listen to; it
featured several seemingly mini
cadenzas which violinist Geoff Nuttall
played to the amazement of all listen
ers. At other times, he and violist
Lesley Robertson played technically
complicated fast passages at the same
time, quite a difficult feat for any
ensemble without a conductor.
Staying true to their tradition of
keeping a varied program for their
quarterly Sundays concerts, the pro
gram was kept varied, this time with
Osvaldo Golijov's (born 1960) piece
"Yiddishbbuk," the movements of
which bear the initials of the five peo
ple commemorated in the work three
children who died at a concentration
camp, a pioneer of the Yiddish literary
movement and those of Leonard

Bernstein, the renowned Jewish con
ductor and composer. "Yiddishbbuk"
was written specifically for the St.
Lawrence String Quartet (SLSQ), and
it was originally intended to premier
this year in March, but wasn't finished
in time. Going by the average opinion
of the audience, the wait was by and

large worth it; though the technically
difficult-to-play piece (it's difficult for
a listener to tell whether this challenge
was accomplished) was very modern,
one can't explain the audience's appre
ciation merely as a function of popu
larity of modern classical music:
autumn this year, the quartet pre-

miered a piece by John Adams which
was less-than-enthusiastically received.
As for the piece itself,
"Yiddishbbuk" seemed almost to be a

perpetual fully diminished chord and
evoked images of the color tan. It's not
pleasant to the ear, but it's not meant
to be. "Yiddishbbuk" is highly disso
nant and full of large, dramatic jumps
in the melodies, dynamics and a seem
ing lack of consistent rhythm or time
signature, not to mention heavy use of
screechy harmonics written for all the
instruments.

Overall, the concert was yet
another stimulating performance by

the St. Lawrence String Quartet.
Though the group (thankfully) per
forms more than once a quarter, this
concert was a re-affirmation of the
fact that their quarterly "Sundays with
St. Lawrence" concerts are always the
most interesting.
