# GET FUNKY
## 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Danny Sandbrink's schedule isn't that of the
typical college student, or any kind of stu
dent for that matter. He's awake at 7:00 in
the morning, asleep by 10:30 at night, does
n't take classes anymore and spends time
perfecting his Funk.
That's his signature, after all, and it's been working
well as of late.
After beginning his senior season for the No. 28 Stan
ford baseball team as a reliever, Sandbrink has fought
his way back into the starting rotation behind an unchar
acteristic pitch that is stumping opposing batters.
"The Funk is kind of like a two-seam fastball," he ex
plained. "I just put a lot of pressure on my index finger.
When you throw it, it looks like a fastball and then it dips
at the end, with the same velocity as my fastball," he said.
"This year what's really made the difference is that I've
been able to control it a lot more, and throw it for strikes
a lot more."
The righthander developed the pitch during his sen
ior season in high school. And when he arrived on the
Farm, former Stanford pitching coach Jeff Austin came
up with the name because of the pitch's sudden move
ment.
"It's very effective because it seems to be his regular
fastball, and it's not recognizable," said senior catcher
Zach Jones. "But [behind the plate,] it isn't unpre
dictable. Once you get used to it, it's not hard to catch."
Sandbrink fooled quite a few
opponents with the pitch his fresh
man year, posting the second-best
ERA for the Cardinal and helping
keep Stanford's season alive with a
pair of crucial postseason starts in
elimination games. But two consec
utive up-and-down seasons left
Sandbrink on the outside looking
in when it came time for head coach
Mark Marquess to set the 2011
starting rotation.
As a senior, he didn't start until
March 29 over a month into the
season when he earned his first
win of the year with a three-inning,
hitless effort over Saint Mary's.
"He was never really complain
ing, even when he wasn't playing as
much and wasn't in a prominent role
at the beginning of the year," said
senior outfielder Dave Giuliani.
"But he just always came up there,
gave it his all and actually put up re
ally great numbers."
Just three starts later, Sandbrink
is 3-0, reaching the three-win mark
for the first time in his Stanford ca
reer despite having made half as
many appearances as in any other
season. His last victory came in
commanding fashion over No. 7
Arizona State, setting a career high
with nine strikeouts in his first
complete game since freshman
year.
"He went up there last weekend
and really dominated," Giuliani
said. "He showed the rest of the
team a lot of courage in sticking it
out, and he ended up throwing 128
pitches.
"He was struggling at that point,
but he went out there and gave it his
all, and got us a complete-game win,
which was huge for us," Giuliani
added.
Teammates see Sandbrink as a
leader by example, always showing
up to compete and work hard. Yet in
the latter regard, his off-the-field life
has taken an unconventional turn
this quarter. When Sandbrink gradu
ated early with a degree in econom
ics, he stopped taking classes but
began new intellectual pursuits
this time, in the corporate world.
Through a parent of a former
teammate, Sandbrink began an in
ternship performing data analysis
for Cisco Systems, Inc., opting not to
take his final quarter off.
It's a half-hour commute

hence the stringent sleeping tenden
cies and Sandbrink's shortened
workday allows him to get back to
campus for afternoon practices and
games.
"It's kind of tough sometimes,
when everyone else wants to stay up
late and I have to get up earlier,"
Sandbrink said. "But I think it's
going to be good for me and give
structure to my everyday life.
"Every day when I come home
from work, I'm way more excited to
be with my teammates and playing
baseball," he added.
Playing at the next level is Sand
brink's eventual aspiration, but re
gardless of his future baseball ca
reer, he sees the internship as a ne
cessity not a backup plan.
"The main thing is to help me
build my resume for after pro base
ball," Sandbrink said. "Afterwards
I'm going to try to find a job. When
you're an athlete in college, you
don't really have much time to build
your resume, especially when you
play baseball all year and play sum
mer ball."
He blew away the competition
last summer by going 7-0 in the St.
Louis Metro Collegiate Baseball
League with a league-best 1.26
ERA, and he has carried over some
of that statistical success to his sen
ior season Sandbrink's stellar
.201 opposing batting average and
2.27 ERA lead the Cardinal through
38 games this year.
But before being evaluated for
Major League Baseball's upcoming
draft in early June, Sandbrink has
another type of national prestige in
mind.
"I came into the season trying to
put the team over myself, trying to
focus on making sure everyone is
doing their best," he said. "Making it
to [the College World Series in]
Omaha is the ultimate goal, rather
than focusing on myself and my
playing time."
There should be no shortage of
playing time for Sandbrink this
week, with Stanford playing five
games in as many days beginning
tonight. Sandbrink is slated to pitch
for the Cardinal on Saturday against
Washington, in a 2 p.m. matchup at
Sunken Diamond.
