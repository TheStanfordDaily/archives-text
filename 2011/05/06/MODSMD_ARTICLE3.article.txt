# GET FUNKY

Danny Sandbrink's schedule isn't that of the
typical college student, or any kind of stu
dent for that matter. He's awake at 7:00 in
the morning, asleep by 10:30 at night, does
n't take classes anymore and spends time
perfecting his Funk.
That's his signature, after all, and it's been working
well as of late.
After beginning his senior season for the No. 28 Stan
ford baseball team as a reliever, Sandbrink has fought
his way back into the starting rotation behind an unchar
acteristic pitch that is stumping opposing batters.
"The Funk is kind of like a two-seam fastball," he ex
plained. "I just put a lot of pressure on my index finger.
When you throw it, it looks like a fastball and then it dips
at the end, with the same velocity as my fastball," he said.
"This year what's really made the difference is that I've
been able to control it a lot more, and throw it for strikes
a lot more."
The righthander developed the pitch during his sen
ior season in high school. And when he arrived on the
Farm, former Stanford pitching coach Jeff Austin came
up with the name because of the pitch's sudden move
ment.
"It's very effective because it seems to be his regular
fastball, and it's not recognizable," said senior catcher
Zach Jones. "But [behind the plate,] it isn't unpre
dictable. Once you get used to it, it's not hard to catch."
