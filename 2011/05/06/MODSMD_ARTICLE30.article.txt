## 'Enclave': Underground dystopian 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
There's been a resurgence of interest in
young adult dystopian fiction, especially
after the recent explosion of "The Hunger
Games" onto the literary scene. Any trend will
have its hangers-on, of course just look at all
the vampire romances that have hit shelves in the
wake of the popular success of "Twilight." But
"Enclave," by Ann Aguirre, is no such mooch; it's
a fun, compelling, original take on a post-apoca
lyptic future.
Deuce has just turned 15, which means she
has earned the right to a name and a place in her
subterranean enclave as either a Builder, a Breeder
or a Hunter. She's a Hunter; she has been training
her whole life for the job of venturing out into
the underground tunnels and bringing back meat
for the group. It's a dangerous task, as the tunnels

are infested with monsters called Freaks, vaguely
humanoid carnivores that eat humans. What's
possibly more dangerous is the hunting partner
she's been assigned, a dark, handsome and myste
rious boy named Fade.
Fade's not from the enclave. Nobody quite
knows where he came from it's common
knowledge that no one can survive for very long
in the tunnels alone. He grudgingly follows
orders and doesn't really socialize, but he's good
with a knife, and the enclave needs every Hunter
it can get, even if it doesn't know it. The Freaks
seem to be getting smarter more human, even
but the elders won't listen to Deuce or Fade,
and the elders make the rules. Deviation from
their laws can lead to exile, which is tantamount
to certain death. That is, until Fade shows her

that there's an entire world above ground, which
is completely unlike the fire-and-brimstone land
scape the elders warned her she would find.
Deuce is a tremendously compelling protag
onist; she's a girl who relies on her wits and her
skill with a knife to survive in the grim, gloomy
underground. She has just the right mix of inde
pendent thought and adherence to duty to be
believable. She is not the revolutionary that some
of the other characters are; unlike Fade, for
instance, she's never known a world beyond the
boundaries defined by enclave elders, so she
shouldn't and doesn't immediately buy
into a new and radical set of beliefs she knows
her place. But neither does she blindly believe
what she's told; after being confront
ed with incontrovertible evidence

that everything is not as it seems, she
is willing to question the worldview
she's held for 15 years and to do what
is right. She makes some difficult
choices in this story, and the author
handles them very well.
Fade, too, is believable, but this is
where the novel starts edging into
cliches. Almost as soon as he and
Deuce are paired together, the reader
can tell that there will be romantic
tension. And there is heaps of it,
especially when they encounter a
hostile tribe and eventually end up
with two more companions: the deli
cate but tenacious Tegan, and the
gruff, bull-headed Stalker. Not every
opposite-gender friendship needs to
have romantic undertones, but that's
what seems to sell (see "Twilight" and
"The Hunger Games"), so authors,
including Aguirre, are reluctant to
break this particular mold and it
really ought to go.
The world of "Enclave" is very
well-illustrated the level of detail is
wonderful but seems somewhat
gimmicky. The intended effect is,
undoubtedly, to show just how much
human society has regressed in the
wake of the preceding disaster, but
some of the scenes in which Deuce
interacts with technological artifacts
and text she can't read feel contrived,
like the author is sharing some inside
joke with readers, at the expense of
her characters. Used once or twice,
the effect is quite potent; sprinkled
liberally in every chapter and it grows
somewhat tiresome.

The inevitable flaws aside,
"Enclave" is a compelling treatment
of a familiar and recently popular
genre. Throw in a cast of strong, sym
pathetic protagonists, as Aguirre has
done, and it should be no surprise
that readers are left waiting eagerly
for book two.
