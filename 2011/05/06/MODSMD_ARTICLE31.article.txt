# 'FICK'-ING AROUND
## WITH DIRECTOR ANDY FICKMAN 
### 
As far as Hollywood bigwigs go, Andy
Fickman's a bit of a goof. His company
"Oops Doughnuts Production," which
operates within Disney Studios in Burbank,
Calif., is brimming with pop tarts, abnormally
oversized action figures, piles of scripts and, natu
rally, bedazzled cell phones and footballs
props from his 2007 box office hit, "The Game
Plan." In addition to "The Game Plan," Fickman,
the man alternatively known as Randy Flickman
(a common mistake), Herr Direcktor and Ficky
(but never Mr. Fickman), has directed box office
hits such as "Race to Witch Mountain," "You
Again" and "She's the Man." He's even got Betty
White's approval.
"Andy is wonderful because he's just as nutty
as the rest of us," White said.
Fickman will stop by Stanford this Tuesday
to give students a glimpse into Hollywood's
inner-workings and advise them on breaking into
the biz. But before all that, he's kindly taken a
moment to warm us up with some silly answers.

Enter
AF: Andy Fickman.
Eye Color
AF: Skittles.
Smile Size (S, M, F)
AF: Medium, but willing to try Small and/or
Large.
Favorite director who's not you:
AF: Again endless, endless, endless list... but
if looking for a rogue's gallery Capra,
Fhtchcock, Ford, Peckinpah, Allen, Spielberg.
Favorite actress/actor to work with:
AF: I have been lucky to have worked with amaz

ing, wonderful, creative, talented folks no
favorites though Dwayne "The Fick" Johnson
has the most muscles.
If you were a piece of candy, what kind would
you be?
AF: Tootsie Pop or gravy. Is gravy a candy?
Maybe gravy-flavored candy.
On a typical Saturday night you're most like to
be found...
AF: I think on a typical Saturday night I am like
most normal folks I am home alone, in a
thong, drinking beer I brewed in my bathtub,
cooking up some stolen Omaha Steaks, Googling
"Chinese Kitten Fetish Singers" or "other hit
songs from that girl who made that 'Friday' song"
and then waiting until around midnight when I
normally drive over to the medical marijuana
store and get my prescription for my glaucoma,
then go home and Google "how do you get glau
coma," then drunk dial old girlfriends and cry
that they never understood me, then sleep until
the people whose home I broke into come back
and I have to run.
Pick one quality you find absolutely irresistible
in a woman?
AF: Smart and witty. Oh crap, that's two ... okay
narrowing that down to one ... boobs.
Edward or Jacob?
AF: Tough one I mean Edward II of
Caemafon was the sixth Plantagenet king who
pretty much was the toast of England from 1307-
1327, which is impressive given health, dental and
hygiene issues during that time, but Jacob was the
son of Isaac & Rebecca, and he was Abraham's
grandson and fathered Joseph who had that
amazing technicolor dreamcoat which was awe
some. It is hard to pick I think with these two
it really is historically about who had the best abs,
so I say Jacob.

If you could have any super power what would
you choose?
AF: To truly be "silent but deadly."
What's your fondest college memory?
AF: I enjoyed all six years of it!
When did you first know you wanted to go into
entertainment?
