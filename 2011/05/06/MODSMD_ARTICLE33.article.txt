# NINTENDO'S NEXT: ANOTHER DREAMCAST?
## 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
For as little official information
we have on Nintendo's upcom
ing console (apparently nick
named Project Cafe ), the gaming
community has already given it a life
time's worth of dismissive labels,
euphoric praise and, of course, inter
net memes. Like with politics, pop
music and everything else in the age
of the Internet, rumors, speculation
and fervent fanaticism fly fast in the

world of videogames.
Most of that, as you'd

expect, is irreverent but
charming garbage like
"leaked" images of the

new console showing
nothing but two Wiis

duct-taped together, per
haps with a name tag

slapped on the side that reads

"Hello, my name is Wii 2." But
amidst the ocean of humor and
rumor is a common thread that
made for a more productive, if not
entertaining, discussion.
Gaming pundits are explicitly
comparing Project Cafe to a beloved
console of yesteryear, the Sega
Dreamcast. Most of that stems from
the timing of Nintendo's announce
ment with Sony and Microsoft
likely nurturing their next consoles
for another three years or so,
Nintendo's targeted 2012 release
could be a tragic retelling of the
Sonic-maker's last dance with the
console market. Sega announced its
promising console in 1998 and
released it on North American shores
in Sept. 1999. It carried enticing and
creative promise, and ultimately
marked many gaming firsts the
leap to 128-bit graphics, online mul
tiplayer and more.
The only trouble, of course, is that
Sony announced its powerful succes
sor to the Play Station at E3 1999 and

completely knocked the Dreamcast
out of the water in terms of power
and third-party developers. Add in
support for DVD playback and a
release date just a year away, and the
Dreamcast was dead in the water just
18 months after it released.
I can't deny that the timing of
Nintendo's announcement evokes an

almost eerie sense of
deja vu. Combined

with numerous reports claiming that
the console will only be "comparable"
in power to the Xbox 360 and
Play Station 3, it's enough to make me
wonder what will put Nintendo over
the edge and into what we insist on
calling "the next generation" the
same problem our dearly departed
Dreamcast had. But for how easy that
part of the comparison is to make, it's
pretty superficial.
It's worth pointing out, though,
that Nintendo doesn't seem to be
relying too heavily on gimmicks or
quirky hardware (as it arguably did
with the Wii). Even with the mysteri
ous controller-screen that has every
one talking, Nintendo has gone on
record that old-fashioned buttons
and joysticks still reign supreme.
Unofficial sources are insisting that
the controller will feature traditional
face and shoulder buttons, ad-pad
and, most importantly, dual joysticks
a feature Nintendo hasn't includ
ed since the Game Cube and whose
omission severely limited the types of
software that worked well with
Dreamcast.

Nintendo is getting
serious in other areas that Sega

missed as well. Before it even made
an official announcement, the Big-N
insistently said it's willing to reach
into the vault to get quality third
party developers on board with its
new hardware. That's a major depar
ture from the Wii and Game Cube,
and a huge difference-maker com
pared to the Dreamcast, which infa
mously failed to get Electronic Arts

sports titles. Nintendo is
/ taking this seriously with
' a controller and hardware
specs that will finally allow

games to be ported from its

competitors, and if the

hoard of partners it amassed

to support the 3DS is any

indication, it means business.
Rumors are already swirling

about projects from big names like
Rockstar and Capcom.

Even if Nintendo's newest con
sole meets a similar end to Sega's last,
I'm convinced it will be for different

reasons. Like the Dreamcast, I have
no doubt it will be less powerful than
Sony and Microsoft's next offerings,
but Nintendo has shown in the last
seven years that it can do enough to
differentiate its hardware to render
that gap irrelevant the Wii runs
on 10-year-old hardware and came
out a year after the 360, and it still

became the fastest-selling console in
history. More so now than ever, inno
vative flair goes farther than graphical
fidelity in determining the success of
a console. With the possible excep
tion of online support, Nintendo has

the basics on lockdown in away Sega
simply didn't, and seems poised to
wage its war, once again, with its cre
ativity. It's too early to make a call on
Cafe, but whether or not it kicks off
the next "generation," Nintendo has
the ball in its court and I'm excited to
see what it does with it.
In any case, we'll know a lot
more when E3 hits Los Angeles in
about a month.
