## meeting ALLY MCBEAL 15 years later 
### – liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
As a 13-year-old, I was addicted to HBO's "Sex
/\ and the City." Perhaps intoxicated by the
Apromise of illicit material or clothes I would
never own, I trolled You Tube for illegal postings and
stashed DVDs of the show under my bed. To the stu
dent at an all-girls middle school I was back then
(and probably still am at heart), the lifestyle and
dilemmas of Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and
Samantha were what I had to look forward to as an
adult woman. Seven years later, I'm by no means an
adult, but I realize how sensationally limited the
worldview of the fab four was.
Thanks to my friends at Netflix, I at last discov
ered a network show that preceded and was contem
poraneous with "Sex and the City," airing from 1997
to 2002: David E. Kelley's seminal work, "Ally
Mcßeal." Stars such as Calista Flockhart, Jane
Krakowski and Robert MacNicol have migrated to
"Brothers and Sisters," "30 Rock" and "Grey's
Anatomy" respectively, but they began together on
this Fox legal dramedy about a young lawyer at a
firm where her former high school sweetheart and

his new wife also work. As much as this
premise sounds like "Grey's" or any contem
porary workplace dramedy, the tone of the
series is decidedly whimsical. Looking
back on "Ally Mcßeal," I can see that
whimsy is something no longer present in
American TV and that perhaps we need the
exaggeration of whimsy to learn from televi
sion more than the dramatic exaggeration of
reality.
By actively avoiding, or mocking, the
domestic space of its characters, "Ally Mcßeal"
affords its characters a base level of credibility.
Love the women of "SATC" as we do, their
general lack of professional ambition, save

Miranda's martyr-like home/work balance,
painted a skewed portrait of female cama-

raderie and romantic desire. Ally (Calista

Flockhart) goes from being the victim

of sexual harassment as the workplace
PYT (the series begins with a lawsuit
against her boss for grabbing her tush
and his counterargument that it's a
compulsion) to being entrenched in a
network of powerful women, from her
roommate Renee of the DA's office to
her boss's girlfriend Judge Whipper.
On "SATC," at the end of the day,
Carrie calls her friends; on "Ally
Mcßeal," Ally goes home alone. The i
social nature of the setting of "Ally
Mcßeal," the offices of Cage & Fish,

allows for a consistent community of playful
ness that doesn't scorn weirdness (a la all the
transitory men on SATC) but embraces it.
The law firm sits atop a bar, where the lawyers
have befriended the singer Vonda Shepard
and turn to the dancing twins for comfort at
the end of an episode. By stripping the apart
ment of its symbolic value as a physical repre
sentation of one's true identity, "Ally Mcßeal"
has the spirit of a sitcom in the suit of a legal
drama.

Similarly, whimsy and insight shine through
using the same mechanism on the show: thought,
not action. Where legal shows like "Law & Order:
SVU" churn out crazy cases for the shock value of
their narrative events, the cases that Cage & Fish
choose to take lead them to discussion. For exam

pie, Ally and Georgia (Ally's ex-boyfriend's
wife) try a case challenging anti-polygamy
laws in Massachusetts; at first, I was disap
pointed by the exploitation of such tradi
tional television fodder (see "Big Love"),
but the trial caused Georgia to question
whether her relationship with Billy had
been improved by Ally's entrance into
their lives. The courtroom is a literal freak
show within the freak show that is "Ally
Mcßeal," and through those layers of freaki
ness, the characters learn that the law's
effort to mediate lives is misguided.
The hierarchy of the legal system and
the workplace reinforces how helpless the
characters are to the insanity occurring
around and inside them. Richard Fish, for
instance, has a fetish for "waddles," the skin
that hangs down from a woman's neck; John
Fish likes to "take a moment"; and Ally her
self hallucinates to see the "dancing baby" of
mid-90s fame. These failures to follow social

cues enable viewers to enjoy the show's action

without fear of real-world consequences, because
the characters are already so "damaged." In cur
rent dramedies, symptoms such as these would
be preludes to breakdowns and epiphanies;
however, "Ally Mcßeal" argues that we must
| embrace our demons, not necessarily lay them
L to rest, and learn to communicate in spite of
f them.

The irreverent natures of the show's
haracters make it a very enjoyable 45 min
utes of television. Rather than bending
over backward to represent the lives of its
viewers, or the idealized future lives of
the teenagers staying up late to watch it
without their parents' knowledge, "Ally
Mcßeal" brandishes the individuality of
its characters and the mind of its creator.

porary workplace dramedy, the tone of the
series is decidedly whimsical. Looking
back on "Ally Mcßeal," I can see that
whimsy is something no longer present in
American TV and that perhaps we need the
exaggeration of whimsy to learn from televi
sion more than the dramatic exaggeration of
reality.
By actively avoiding, or mocking, the
domestic space of its characters, "Ally Mcßeal"
affords its characters a base level of credibility.
Love the women of "SATC" as we do, their
general lack of professional ambition, save

Miranda's martyr-like home/work balance,
painted a skewed portrait of female cama-

raderie and romantic desire. Ally (Calista

Flockhart) goes from being the victim

of sexual harassment as the workplace
PYT (the series begins with a lawsuit
against her boss for grabbing her tush
and his counterargument that it's a
compulsion) to being entrenched in a
network of powerful women, from her
roommate Renee of the DA's office to
her boss's girlfriend Judge Whipper.
On "SATC," at the end of the day,
Carrie calls her friends; on "Ally
Mcßeal," Ally goes home alone. The i
social nature of the setting of "Ally
Mcßeal," the offices of Cage & Fish,

allows for a consistent community of playful
ness that doesn't scorn weirdness (a la all the
transitory men on SATC) but embraces it.
The law firm sits atop a bar, where the lawyers
have befriended the singer Vonda Shepard
and turn to the dancing twins for comfort at
the end of an episode. By stripping the apart
ment of its symbolic value as a physical repre
sentation of one's true identity, "Ally Mcßeal"
has the spirit of a sitcom in the suit of a legal
drama.

Similarly, whimsy and insight shine through
using the same mechanism on the show: thought,
not action. Where legal shows like "Law & Order:
SVU" churn out crazy cases for the shock value of
their narrative events, the cases that Cage & Fish
choose to take lead them to discussion. For exam

pie, Ally and Georgia (Ally's ex-boyfriend's
wife) try a case challenging anti-polygamy
laws in Massachusetts; at first, I was disap
pointed by the exploitation of such tradi
tional television fodder (see "Big Love"),
but the trial caused Georgia to question
whether her relationship with Billy had
been improved by Ally's entrance into
their lives. The courtroom is a literal freak
show within the freak show that is "Ally
Mcßeal," and through those layers of freaki
ness, the characters learn that the law's
effort to mediate lives is misguided.
The hierarchy of the legal system and
the workplace reinforces how helpless the
characters are to the insanity occurring
around and inside them. Richard Fish, for
instance, has a fetish for "waddles," the skin
that hangs down from a woman's neck; John
Fish likes to "take a moment"; and Ally her
self hallucinates to see the "dancing baby" of
mid-90s fame. These failures to follow social

cues enable viewers to enjoy the show's action

without fear of real-world consequences, because
the characters are already so "damaged." In cur
rent dramedies, symptoms such as these would
be preludes to breakdowns and epiphanies;
however, "Ally Mcßeal" argues that we must
| embrace our demons, not necessarily lay them
L to rest, and learn to communicate in spite of
f them.

The irreverent natures of the show's
haracters make it a very enjoyable 45 min
utes of television. Rather than bending
over backward to represent the lives of its
viewers, or the idealized future lives of
the teenagers staying up late to watch it
without their parents' knowledge, "Ally
Mcßeal" brandishes the individuality of
its characters and the mind of its creator.
