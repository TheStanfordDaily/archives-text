## ROXY SASS SEXY TIME MANAGEMENT 
### 
It was a waim Sunday evening.
Roxy was getting her Twitter on
when the first glimmers of the
rumor began. White House

announced a press conference, e-whis
pers of bin Laden s death started to
pepper the Internet and Roxy knew
what to do: she turned on CNN.
But suspecting she would be in
for a sizeable wait before the big news,
Roxy made sure none of it was wasted
listening to Wolf Blitzer pontificate
about the historic nature of the event.
Instead, what better to do than to send
out a quick booty call and bring over
some company to truly take advantage
of her time? Roxy doesn't need her
hands or mouth to keep one ear at the
ready for the president's announce
ment, and the political anticipation of
the announcement only made the sex
ual anticipation of Roxy's latest romp
all the more exciting.
Once Obama finished his speech,
Roxy was struck by a few revelations.
Firstly, in making the country wait so
long for the address, Obama certified his
status as total tease —and Roxy kind of
liked it Secondly, Navy SEALs just got
so sexy that Roxy might have to restrain
herself when looking at a marine mam
mal seal or even an envelope seal

Thirdly, Pakistan had more explaining
to do than a significant other caught
with a lover hiding in the closet.

But fourthly, and most impor
tantly: Roxy realized that even the
most momentous foreign policy

announcement in recent years could
n't keep her attention completely on a
Sunday night. Her eyes may have been
glued to the screen, but the rest of her
body was, erm, busy doing something
else. No precious time was idly wasted,

and hey — multi-tasking just got a lot
more fun.
Roxy s been given many lectures
about time management, but they
never seem to stick. Sexytime
Management (copyright pending),
however, is much more intriguing.
Need to finish that essay? Promise
yourself a booty call scheduled to
arrive on your doorstep as soon as you
finish but not a minute before. Even
Roxy could pump out an 80-page the
sis if it meant getting pumped after she
turned it in.
Midterm season getting you
down? Get it back up by spicing up
your time-management incentives.
Roxy knows that today s youth is
already a multi-tasking, overloaded
generation so release your load a
little with some pleasant procrastina
tion or delayed gratification. Lots of
studying now means more fun times
later, or getting both done at the same
time is equally admirable. Pairing your
o-chem with some os of your own is
doubly productive and that's just
being smart about it. America f*' *'*
yeah.
