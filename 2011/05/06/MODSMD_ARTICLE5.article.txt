## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Trimpin previews 'Gurs Zyclus' show 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Artist Trimpin does not know what his
May 14 performance will sound like, but he'll
have an idea soon. He discussed this upcom
ing show, The Gurs Zyklus (The Gurs Cycle),
and his creative process at the Aurora Forum,
moderated by founder Mark Gonnerman and
art professor Paul DeMarinis in Pigott The
ater Thursday night.
Trimpin, a Seattle-based multimedia artist,
spoke of the creative process he experiences
when he produces art. Much of his work, he
said, is a result of trial and error.
He recalled a water installation that had
been particularly challenging because he
could not control the flow of the water. After
pouring himself a glass of vodka while taking
a break, he noticed that its flow was exactly
what he wanted, but realized that he could not
get away with an alcoholic sculpture,
"I asked the physicists why this was hap
pening with water and not vodka, but after
looking in the books for a week they came
back and told me they don't know," he said. "A
lot of this you really have to learn on the job."
Beginning Monday, Trimpin's team of per
formers will converge on Memorial Auditori
um, where they will explore the way their in
struments sound in the performance space
and fit together the final pieces of their show.
The performance will feature many such re
sults of trial and error, including a harp played
by water droplets and an organ played by fire.
"There's still something about art practice
that goes back to a very long time ago, before
the era of patent disclosures and everything,"
DeMarinis said. "There are these kinds of
things you know how to do, things you know
how to get out of materials because of this ex
perience. It's craft knowledge, something the
hands know."

Over the last year,Trimpin has been an artist
in residence at the Farm, where he has dedicat
ed much of his time to working on the cycle, a
performance piece mixing unconventional in
struments, music and other media focusing on
Gurs, an internment camp in France during the
Spanish Civil War and World War 11. This per
formance will mark the end of his stay.
Though he was born almost a decade after

the end of World War 11, Trimpin felt a con
nection with the victims of the Holocaust
from a young age when he stumbled upon an
abandoned cemetery and tried to puzzle out
the alien "symbols" on the gravestones. After
learning that the symbols were Hebrew let
ters that spelled out the names of his home
town's former Jewish residents many of
whom had been deported to Gurs in World
War II he became haunted by the atroci
ties of the war.

The name constantly resurfaced over the
years. His musical mentor, Conlon Nancar

row, was held at Gurs during the Spanish Civil
War. It was this continual cycle of violence
that inspired the project's name.
"I chose the title because in ways we didn't
learn anything in 70 years," he said, noting
that even today there are internment camps
still operating albeit under different
names.

The performance will also feature the
story of local resident Manfred Wildmann,
who was held at Gurs during WWII. After
reading about Trimpin's project, he contacted
the artist and shared with him the drawings he

had made of the camp when he was a boy.
Writings and mementos from other Gurs
prisoners will also be shown during the per
formance.
"It's part of my healing process," he said.
"This baggage isn't something you can just
shake off."
The world premiere of The Gurs Zyklus
will be held May 14 at 8 p.m. in Memorial Au
ditorium.
