## Milroy reflects on fire's aftermath at model shop 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The model shop at Stanford's
Product Realization Lab (PRL) is
expected to be operational May 18
following last month's fire, accord
ing to PRL co-director Craig Milroy
M.S. 'BO 'B2. The Apr. 23 blaze
caused the Stanford Fire Marshal to
briefly close the model shop, lead
ing to machinery damage and an al
most month-long repair process be
fore classes can resume work there.

"[The restoration] is taking
longer than anyone would want,"
Milroy said. "But [the University is]
just doing a phenomenally good job
of dealing with us and helping us get
back in shape."
"Basically they've gone in and
they've cleaned every surface in the
shop, getting any smoke and water
damage off of it they could," Milroy
added. "They've sealed the room up
and pumped it full of ozone for two
days ... to get rid of that smoke
smell, and then the painters and the
floor people are going to come in."
The second room in the model
shop is already done with that part
of the process, so today at about
noon the shop will be reopened, al
though the machines won't all be
operational. Milroy intends to
closely examine the machines with
a millwright this afternoon.
"We're trying to figure out which
ones are damaged beyond repair,
which ones need repair and which
ones survived just fine," Milroy said.
"It's mostly an issue of water dam
age, as opposed to any other kind of
damage."
In a woodshop, the equipment
isn't usually lubricated with oil, like
in a machine shop, because of the oil
and wood dust. The dry lubricant
isn't water repellant.
"Already on Sunday morning
the staff had started to deal a little
bit with that damage and the clean
ing crew also tried to deal with that
damage and correct some of it,"
Milroy said. "But they've had to
cover all the equipment back up for
the other cleaning process to take
place."
The shop's table saw, which was
right next to the fire, was out of
commission after suffering water
damage and relatively severe heat
damage that could have impacted
its safety systems.

"That's a saw we really want run
ning in excellent condition," Milroy
said.

Fie said that the University rec
ognized this need and permitted the
purchase of another saw. The new
table saw will cost $4,200 plus tax,
Milroy said.

Some equipment, including the
band saws and the wood lathe, are
more straightforward machines
that do not need to be in pristine
condition. Other pieces of equip
ment include two disc sanders, a belt
sander and spindle sander, all of
which were doused with water but
still turn on. The extent of their in
ternal rust damage is unclear.
"The sprinklers didn't complete
ly put that fire out, but damped it
down quite a bit," Milroy said.
When the firefighters arrived,
they put out the remaining flames,
but as part of the process added
water and spread it to the floor in
the second room, which otherwise
only suffered smoke damage.
Restoration and repairs began in
earnest afterwards.
"The facilities people came in
and said, 'Okay, we need to get this
shop up and running right away; it's
a teaching facility,"' Milroy said.
"And so they started contracting
with other groups to get the clean
ing done."
Since the fire, workers have
looked at floor damage, painters
have been lined up for next week
and the Environmental Health and
Safety (EH&S) department came
to do a hazard analysis.

"The facilities people
came in and said,
'Okay, we need to get
this shop up and
running right away;
it's a teaching facility"
CRAIG MILROY
Meanwhile, classes have seen
some minor disruptions but none of
them have had to radically change
curriculum mid-stream.
One course, called "The Chair"
and taught through the Depart
ment of Art and Art History, was
using the PRL's model shop and
welding room. Although it was not
previously planned, they have been

able to work in the Art and Art His
tory department's sculpture lab and
the PRL's machine shop.
Another class, "Computer-
Aided Product Creation," is work
ing in the foundry and requires so
called "pattern boards," but since
the model shop equipment was
down, they had to contract with an
outside firm to cut the pieces.
"Knock on wood, I think with a
little readjustment everyone's
worked out pretty well," Milroy
said.

"I think the disturbance has
been as minimal as it could be," he

added.
Milroy stated that "the Universi
ty's done a fantastic job of getting
us back up and running."
After the Apr. 23 fire and the
death of an undergraduate at a Yale
machine shop, EH&S is reviewing
safety practices and policy with the
PRL.

"Any time there's an accident
like this, you'd be foolish not to re
view the standard procedures in
place and say, 'could we have pre
vented this' and 'what could we do
in the future to keep it from hap
pening again," Milroy said. "And we
do that all the time, not just when
there's a disaster. We go through re
views of our procedures at least
every year. I don't think anything
major's going to change."
One slight change, however, is
the addition of a few pointers about
fire prevention.
After the Yale incident, there is a
"need to maintain vigilance," Mil
roy said.
"As people start to use the shop,
they probably get a little more calm
and relaxed about using stuff and
it's our job to make sure we don't let
our guard down, know that there's a
lot of potential things that could
happen and we want to minimize all
those," he added.
