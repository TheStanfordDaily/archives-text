## Stanford-supported Gravity Probe B confirms two tenets of Einstein's theory of general relativity 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
A Stanford and NASA team led by physics professor Francis Everitt con
firmed two tenets of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, ending one
of the space agency's longest-running ventures.
The project, which was geared toward developing and using a satellite
called Gravity Probe B (GP-B), spanned five decades and ultimately cost
more than $750 million. It was designed to empirically study the geodetic ef
fect, which is the warping of space and time around gravitational bodies, and
frame-dragging, which is how much a spinning object carries time and space
as it rotates.
"GP-B confirmed two of the most profound predictions of Einstein's uni
verse, having far-reaching implications across astrophysics research," Everitt
said in an interview with the Stanford Report. "Likewise, the decades of tech
nological innovation behind the mission will have a lasting legacy on Earth
and in space."
The experiment was dreamed up in 1959, but at the time, the technology
wasn't available to create such a device. GP-B was to house a star tracker and
four ultra-precise gyroscopes that would then orbit Earth at about 400 miles
above the surface.
After more than four decades, the probe finally made it to orbit in
2004 and ran for 17 months. Unexpected electrical charge on the gyro
scopes, which were niobium superconductors, caused them to inadver
tently twist, throwing off the satellite's readings. It took five years to ob
tain the data.
Technologies developed for GP-B have led to systems that can control
aerodynamic drag, magnetic field and thermal variation. They have helped
advance the Global Positioning System (GPS) and NASA's Cosmic
