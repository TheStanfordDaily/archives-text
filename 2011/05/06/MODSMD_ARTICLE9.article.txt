## EDITORIAL Admission Interviews: No, Thanks 
### 
Admission criteria to Har
vard University in 1869 in
cluded command of Latin
subjunctive, facility with cube roots
and recall of major river basins and
the history of Pharsalia appar
ently a province of ancient Greece.
The rigid, well-defined admission
procedures of the 19th-century
have given way to a more flexible
contemporary framework for eval
uation that allows consideration of
non-academic ability, socioeco
nomic background and interper
sonal skills. The Alumni Interview
Pilot Program purports to offer
Stanford Admission a window into
these intangible qualities and en
hance its ability to holistically ap
praise applicants. However, on bal
ance the program will be marginal
ly effective at best, discriminatory
at worst and probably not worth
the effort to fully implement.
An applicant's file which in
cludes test scores, transcripts, es
says and recommendations al
ready contains a wealth of academ
ic and non-academic information.
The interview allegedly serves two
unique purposes. First, it allows an
interviewer to confirm or deny the
personality traits and academic
background cited in the paper ma
terials. Given the proliferation of
essay prep resources and the posi
tive uniformity of recommenda
tions, the interview can be a valu
able tool to test whether an appli
cant actually possesses a particular
trait say "poise" cited by a
recommender or a personal state
ment. This frees admission officers
from having to approach all enco
mia in paper materials with a grain
of salt; the reviewer will know if the
materials are corroborated or not.

Second, the interview delivers in
sight into the applicants "intangi
bles" over and above that cited in the
paper materials. This seems dubious
prima facie. Consider a clear example
of when the interview is supposed to

generate additional information to
the paper materials: a candidate is
charming in the interview and
demonstrates interpersonal skills
that will serve him well in student
leadership. The interviewer duly re
ports this to the admission officer, and
the datum is taken into account.
However, this information on the ap
plicant's interpersonal skills could
just as easily have come from a
teacher recommendation. The added
credibility of the unbiased interview
er's word does not support the argu
ment that the interview enables bet
ter identification of the applicant's in
tangibles than do the paper materials.
Rather, this second advantage of the
interview appears to collapse into the
first advantage, namely that inter
views simply reinforce or undermine
the paper materials.
The threshold question for justi
fying alumni interviews is therefore
whether the ability of interviews to
confirm/disconfirm claims made in
the paper materials outweighs the
disadvantages of enacting such a
program. The answer is likely no,
because although paper materials
may be inaccurate, interview feed
back is similarly dubious. Although
all alumni interviewers undergo
the same training, their preparation
is less rigorous than that of an ad
mission officer and their reports
therefore appropriately discount
ed. Moreover, the variability of in
terview circumstances and statisti
cally guaranteed poor performanc
es further devalues the information
gleaned from an interview. Shawn
Abbott, former director of admis
sion, noted last June in the Examin
er that admission officers rarely
changed their decisions based on
interview feedback.
That anecdotal evidence for the
redundancy of alumni interviews is
borne out in a 1991 empirical study
by Comila Shahani, which conclud-
Ed that alumni interviews do not
add incremental predictive value
to paper materials using admission
outcome or freshman GPA regres
sors. Therefore, alumni interviews
do not predict future academic
performance and are redundant to
admission decisions even given
their ostensibly unique access to
applicant intangibles.
Interviews also have the poten

tial to disadvantage applicants
from poor socioeconomic and eth
nic minority backgrounds. Christ
ian Connell's research demon
strates that the social skills of high
school graduates from those com
munities lag behind those of their
middle and upper class counter
parts due in part to insufficient
adult interaction. Regardless of
correction protocols that the ad
missions office may try to build
into alumni training, interviewers
will either overcompensate or dis
advantage underprivileged appli
cants, in both cases yielding tainted
information.

Facilitating an alumni-inter
viewing network capable of serv
ing over 30,000 applicants will be a
monumental task. Indeed, even
taking into account the potential
benefit of energizing the alumni
community, the costly endeavor is
at most a wash. The benefits of ob
taining unreliable data that only
serve to test the veracity of claims
made in paper materials are mea
ger, while the program has poten
tially damaging effects to Stan
ford's diversity promotion efforts.
Therefore, this Board urges the
Admission Office to reconsider its
alumni interview program.
