## THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY Reflections on a Transgender Childhood 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I loved reading as a kid. The Eng
lish major within me is a bit
ashamed to say this, but my fa
vorite books are still the books I read
from when I was 11 or 12. There's
something really magical about that
love of reading as a child, when you
did it for the sake of doing it, when
there were no papers to write or no
class discussion to prepare for. Those
were the days before I was trained to
critically deconstruct everything I
read, and I could completely lose my
self in the narrative and the charac
ters. I miss those days.
But after some more reflection, I
didn't just read because I loved it. I
never met anyone transgender until
I reached college, so when I was
younger, I desperately looked for
somebody like me in the books I
read, the movies and TV shows I
watched. I was always interested in
narratives where girls disguised
themselves as boys and ran away to
find adventure, about girls who
wanted to be princes and knights,
about girls who didn't quite fit into
pink and dresses, about girls who
were too restless to wait around for
the boy to save them so they took
matters into their own hands. And I
guess one good thing about being
born female meant that I could feed
into my obsession of Disney princess
movies without shame —my par
ents thought that I identified with
the female main characters, but in re
ality, my two-year-old self (and I
admit, still my 22-year-old self) want
ed to be the prince that saves the hot
princess and lives happily ever after
with her. I didn't know quite how to
articulate it at the time, but that's
what I believed, deep down.
Though I came close, I never
could find myself in those brave
heroines or the gallant princes that I
discovered during my reading and
watching excursions. As a result, I led
a lonely childhood, a childhood
where I thought I was completely
alone, because there no other kids
like me, not in the people I met in
real life or my imagination. I thought
children like me did not exist, that I
was a freak it was a feeling that
sat long with me and defined my
childhood, and the residue of that
loneliness still haunts me today.
Things are getting better,
though. LGB kids are coming out
younger and younger, because
there are more representations of
themselves in the media while I
had to dig into the deep recesses of
my local library to find some ob
scure lesbian teen novel published
10 years ago, LGB kids are seeing
themselves in the mainstream. Glee,
for example, with its same-sex cou
ples, would not have existed when I
was in high school. It's empowering
to see this pattern emerging in films,
television shows and books.
However, as all things trans are,
there are literally no trans represen
tations in media. I wonder if things

would have turned out differently if
my 12-year-old self had picked up a
book that had a trans character I
wonder if I would have realized
things sooner. There are very few
films and television shows that con
tain transgender characters, and not
many of them focus on the young
trans person's experience. Only in
the last couple years has there been
young adult fiction published that
involves transgender characters.
What non-gender-conforming kids
need right now is somebody to show
them that they're not alone, some
body they could relate to on a basic
level. I didn't have that. I wish I did.
I suppose I should have higher
goals for myself, like becoming the
next Nabokov or Woolf, or securing
myself a place in the literary canon.
But I'll admit that my greatest aspi
ration is to write that book I
would've loved to have read when I
was 12 years old because if I had
had something like that when I was
younger, if I had seen myself in the
books I read or the movies I watched
it probably would have saved me
a couple years of grief. The fact that
children like me were not present in
the media I consumed does not
mean that children like me didn't
exist they do. I was one.
I suppose it's a good thing that I
was lonely, that in my continual fail
ure to find someone like myself, I
gained a level of self-awareness that
a lot of kids my age didn't have. But
at the same time, I would have given
anything to feel a little less lonely.
But as I'm looking forward to my
future, I realize this is my chance to
change things for that young kid
who resembles my 12-year-old self,
looking for somebody to relate to.
Here's my chance to make it a little
easier for them. And that's what I'm
going to do.

ed to be the prince that saves the hot
princess and lives happily ever after
with her. I didn't know quite how to
articulate it at the time, but that's
what I believed, deep down.
Though I came close, I never
could find myself in those brave
heroines or the gallant princes that I
discovered during my reading and
watching excursions. As a result, I led
a lonely childhood, a childhood
where I thought I was completely
alone, because there no other kids
like me, not in the people I met in
real life or my imagination. I thought
children like me did not exist, that I
was a freak it was a feeling that
sat long with me and defined my
childhood, and the residue of that
loneliness still haunts me today.
Things are getting better,
though. LGB kids are coming out
younger and younger, because
there are more representations of
themselves in the media while I
had to dig into the deep recesses of
my local library to find some ob
scure lesbian teen novel published
10 years ago, LGB kids are seeing
themselves in the mainstream. Glee,
for example, with its same-sex cou
ples, would not have existed when I
was in high school. It's empowering
to see this pattern emerging in films,
television shows and books.
However, as all things trans are,
there are literally no trans represen
tations in media. I wonder if things

would have turned out differently if
my 12-year-old self had picked up a
book that had a trans character I
wonder if I would have realized
things sooner. There are very few
films and television shows that con
tain transgender characters, and not
many of them focus on the young
trans person's experience. Only in
the last couple years has there been
young adult fiction published that
involves transgender characters.
What non-gender-conforming kids
need right now is somebody to show
them that they're not alone, some
body they could relate to on a basic
level. I didn't have that. I wish I did.
I suppose I should have higher
goals for myself, like becoming the
next Nabokov or Woolf, or securing
myself a place in the literary canon.
But I'll admit that my greatest aspi
ration is to write that book I
would've loved to have read when I
was 12 years old because if I had
had something like that when I was
younger, if I had seen myself in the
books I read or the movies I watched
it probably would have saved me
a couple years of grief. The fact that
children like me were not present in
the media I consumed does not
mean that children like me didn't
exist they do. I was one.
I suppose it's a good thing that I
was lonely, that in my continual fail
ure to find someone like myself, I
gained a level of self-awareness that
a lot of kids my age didn't have. But
at the same time, I would have given
anything to feel a little less lonely.
But as I'm looking forward to my
future, I realize this is my chance to
change things for that young kid
who resembles my 12-year-old self,
looking for somebody to relate to.
Here's my chance to make it a little
easier for them. And that's what I'm
going to do.

I thought I was
completely alone,
because there were
no other kids like me.
