# No FREE LUNCH
## Happier Campers 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
It's spring quarter and the sun and 70-degree weath
er is hopefully here to stay. This means that if you
live somewhere with seniors, or are one, you proba
bly know someone participating in Camp Stanford. The
formula is simple, no class plus a liberal addition of
kegs, frisbees and fountains equals one hell of a quarter.
If you want a commitment-free quarter on the Farm
you have two options. The first, if you want to be official
about it or are finishing up a thesis or clearing incom
pletes, is to apply for a Permit to Attend for Services
Only (PSO). For the bargain price of $3,900 you have
the privilege of living on campus, using the gym and get
ting to wipe your academic record clear of incompletes.
The second option is to graduate winter quarter and
apply for a Post-Graduation Quarter (PGQ). Down
side of the PGQ, no submitting a senior thesis, cleaning
up your academic record or using the gym; upside, it's
free.
Both of these are great options for the select few who
can actually complete all of the coursework required for
their major before the spring quarter of their senior
year. The people who can pull this off are usually those
among us who were finishing off their four-year plan in
Ist quarter freshman IHUM, transferred in a lot of cred
it from somewhere else or had some other special cir
cumstance like attending summer quarters, and (not to
start up the techie-fuzzy debate) probably aren't receiv
ing a degree that says engineering. Congratulations for
getting done, and enjoy your quarter of relaxation.
However, the University's all or nothing policy
requiring coursework to be either fully completed be
fore spring quarter or for full enrolment leaves
everyone else stuck in some iteration of Camp Stanford
wannabe. This usually looks like a real class or two to
fulfill remaining requirements, plus a lot of fluff to get
to 12 units.
Let's say it's winter quarter of you're senior year.
You're well past the 180 units required to graduate,
you've knocked out all of the University GER's and for
all intents and purposes you've completed your major
except for that final pesky three-unit class that's only
offered in the spring. A real Camp Stanford experience
is out you have coursework that still needs complet
ing. But now comes the interesting part: how best to get
to 12 units. Let the racketeering begin. The class you
have to take is three units, throw in a POLISCI seminar
that sounds mildly interesting and meets Tuesdays and
Thursdays for two hours, and you're at eight. Throw in
Lifestyle Fitness Challenge for two units, Beach Volley
ball for one, and Introductory Wine tasting for another
one, and there are your 12 units.
There's nothing wrong with this. It's totally under
standable to want to take as light of an academic load as
possible your senior spring. But we'd bet that the world
class wine tasting and yoga programs probably weren't
why most of us ended up at Stanford, and it seems
wasteful to require academically apathetic seniors to
try to find the easiest way to navigate past the minimum
unit requirement. You end up with seniors taking on
three or four units because they need to and eight or

nine units because they have to.
So what's the answer? Well a quick and easy fix
would be to let 12th quarter seniors register like a grad
uate student for their final quarter at Stanford. This
would lower the minimum unit requirement down to
eight units and reduce the tuition rate from $12,900 for
12-20 units to $8,390 for 8-11 units, giving seniors a
choice of how academically involved they'd like their
final quarter to be. While this would be much better
than the current system, it means a revenue loss for the
University, so don't hold your breath.
An even better solution would be to remove the
minimum unit requirement altogether for 12th quarter
seniors and simultaneously eliminate the Post Gradua
tion Quarter. This means that every senior would be re
quired to maintain their University services for $3,900 a
quarter, and any academic credit they choose to enroll
in would be billed by unit. We were unable to find the
exact numbers on how many seniors choose which en
rollment option, but we'd imagine that it would be
something of a wash in terms of revenue the gain
from those graduating early and hanging around of
campus would help to balance the loss from billing by
the unit. Not to mention the upside of a lot happier and
more productive seniors, doing what they need to do
and not having to fudge the rest. Just ask the Develop
ment Office tasked ensuring we all donate profusely
to Stanford once we graduate about the economic
upsides of an entire graduating Stanford class having a
better, sunnier, more laid back experience their last
quarter on the Farm.

tasting and yoga programs
weren't why most of us ended

offered in the spring. A real Camp Stanford experience
is out you have coursework that still needs complet
ing. But now comes the interesting part: how best to get
to 12 units. Let the racketeering begin. The class you
have to take is three units, throw in a POLISCI seminar
that sounds mildly interesting and meets Tuesdays and
Thursdays for two hours, and you're at eight. Throw in
Lifestyle Fitness Challenge for two units, Beach Volley
ball for one, and Introductory Wine tasting for another
one, and there are your 12 units.
There's nothing wrong with this. It's totally under
standable to want to take as light of an academic load as
possible your senior spring. But we'd bet that the world
class wine tasting and yoga programs probably weren't
why most of us ended up at Stanford, and it seems
wasteful to require academically apathetic seniors to
try to find the easiest way to navigate past the minimum
unit requirement. You end up with seniors taking on
three or four units because they need to and eight or

nine units because they have to.
So what's the answer? Well a quick and easy fix
would be to let 12th quarter seniors register like a grad
uate student for their final quarter at Stanford. This
would lower the minimum unit requirement down to
eight units and reduce the tuition rate from $12,900 for
12-20 units to $8,390 for 8-11 units, giving seniors a
choice of how academically involved they'd like their
final quarter to be. While this would be much better
than the current system, it means a revenue loss for the
University, so don't hold your breath.
An even better solution would be to remove the
minimum unit requirement altogether for 12th quarter
seniors and simultaneously eliminate the Post Gradua
tion Quarter. This means that every senior would be re
quired to maintain their University services for $3,900 a
quarter, and any academic credit they choose to enroll
in would be billed by unit. We were unable to find the
exact numbers on how many seniors choose which en
rollment option, but we'd imagine that it would be
something of a wash in terms of revenue the gain
from those graduating early and hanging around of
campus would help to balance the loss from billing by
the unit. Not to mention the upside of a lot happier and
more productive seniors, doing what they need to do
and not having to fudge the rest. Just ask the Develop
ment Office tasked ensuring we all donate profusely
to Stanford once we graduate about the economic
upsides of an entire graduating Stanford class having a
better, sunnier, more laid back experience their last
quarter on the Farm.
