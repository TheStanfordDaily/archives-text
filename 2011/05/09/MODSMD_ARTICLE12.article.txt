## Green gone: a blessing? 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
In what became an increasingly
expected move, Jeremy Green
decided Sunday to stay in the
NBA Draft, thereby foregoing
his final season of collegiate eligi
bility.
When a team loses its top scorer
and three-point threat, the ramifica
tions are normally dire. Certainly, when
the Lopez twins left the Farm after
their sophomore season, there was a
tangible drop off in the Cardinals play,
and the results spoke for themselves:
Stanford went from a Sweet 16 squad
to a CBI contestant.
But Green is no Brook or Robin,
and the Cardinal is no powerhouse. In
fact, his early departure may very well
be a blessing in disguise for a program
that has nowhere to go but up.
Green's Stanford career began
promisingly enough, as he established
himself as the Cardinal's top shooter
off the bench in his freshman year. As a
starter in his sophomore season, he
provided a nice compliment to Landry
Fields on a team that at times featured
nearly as many walk-ons as scholarship
athletes. He seemed to be poised to
take over as the team's primary leader
as a junior.
But his improvements were mar
ginal at best and only in one area
shooting which simply wasn't
enough. He was never a passer or ac
tive on the boards, seldom showed a
willingness to drive to the basket and
was a constant liability on defense. His
one great trait may have worked as a
role-player, but as the featured star, his
lack of an overall game and general in
ability to come through in the clutch
did not make for a potent combination.
Add in the fact that Green was sus
pended for spring quarter for academ
ic reasons and was thus unable to
practice with his teammates and the
veracity of his alpha dog status comes
even more into question.
It's also worth noting the state of
Stanford basketball. The beginning of
the Johnny Dawkins era, while flashing
occasional signs of promise see
2009's Kentucky game has been un
derwhelming overall and is in need of a
spark (and fast, lest Dawkins's time on
the Farm be cut short long before any
one would have hoped). With the 2010-
11 season in mind, Green was almost
certainly not going to be that catalyst,
unless he had yet-to-be-seen potential
in numerous areas. But he'd still likely
be the Cardinal's first option, which
leads to an obvious conundrum and an
evident conclusion: the team would
have been stuck in neutral. The status
quo means the bottom of the Pac-12,
which, at this and any other point, is un
acceptable.
Given that the risk is only that Stan
ford remains as forgettable as it has be
come over the past few years, the Car
dinal can turn toward its younger play
ers for the jumpstart the squad desper
ately needs. The immediate future of
the program rests on the shoulders of
the 2010 recruiting class, generally
ranked in the top 15 in the country.
Thrown into the fire almost immedi
ately, there were solid early returns:
Dwight Powell and Anthony Brown
made the Pac-10 All-Freshman team,
Aaron Bright improved steadily
throughout the year and Josh Huestis
demonstrated good tenacity in limited
minutes. That doesn't even account for
John Gage, who showed a shooter's
touch at times, and Stefan Nastic, who
missed nearly the entire year with a
foot injury.
Green's departure means signifi
cant opportunities for the group to fill
the void and then some instead
of having them play second fiddle for
another season. Brown in particular
showed skills hustle, a nose for the
ball and a solid offensive game that
could make him into a bona fide star,
and Powell is probably the most natu
rally skilled big man the Cardinal has
had since the Lopez twins. The growth
of the duo and their classmates is criti
cal to the success of Stanford basket
ball. The other veterans a comple
mentary set are exactly what the
younger players need, from the ever
consistent Josh Owens to seasoned
role-players like Jarrett Mann, Jack
Trotter and Andrew Zimmermann.
And Stanford's lone scholarship re
cruit â€” the highly touted Chasson
Randle only adds to this intriguing
blend.

Ultimately, the 2011-12 Stanford
men's basketball team may be a case
study of Bill Simmons's Ewing Theory
at work. The concept is simple: a star
athlete leaves a team, and the squad
becomes inexplicably better, perhaps
as a result. The Cardinal is ripe for this.
Green's skill set meant that there were
inherent tradeoffs with his game that
didn't always work to Stanford's ben-

A star leaves the
team, and the squad
becomes inexplicably
better.

efit, even though he was always
looked to for buckets; the recruiting
class of 2010 is tremendously skilled
and now slightly experienced; the
biggest strength gains at the collegiate
level are generally seen between
freshman and sophomore years,
meaning that Brown, Powell and
friends will likely not be string beans
when they hit the court in November;
Dawkins has to start winning, and
soon, and he knows this; and the other
veteran players have games that make
them valuable in supporting roles.
This is not to say that Stanford
won't miss Green at all. Certainly, he
could provide electrifying threes that
few others could replicate. But if this
year showed anything, it was that
Green was not the player to lead Stan
ford's resurgence, and with him on the
team, it would be more difficult for
others to step up. Brown, Powell and
the rest of the current freshmen may
not be saviors either, but with the pro
gram already bottomed out, it's better
to roll the dice on new talent than to
stick with what the Cardinal has al
ready come to know.

Wyndam Makowky will probably
have a pronounced Ewing effect
when he finally leaves The Daily's
