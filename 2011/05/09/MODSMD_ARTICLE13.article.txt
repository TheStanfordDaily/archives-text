# BACK ON TRACK
## BASEBALL SWEEPS HUSKIES 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford baseball may have
come away with it first series sweep
of the season over the visiting Wash
ington Huskies this weekend, but
the final result didn't preclude some
late-inning drama. After riding
eight solid innings from sophomore
righty Mark Appel to a 6-2 win on
Friday, Stanford made things inter
esting by surrendering a four-run
lead on Saturday before eking out
an 8-7 victory on Saturday and com
ing from behind with a six-run
eighth to win 7-2 on Sunday. The
No. 28 Cardinal (25-16,9-9 Pac-10)
evened its conference record with
the sweep and is back on track after
winning just one weekend series in
the past month.

After dropping out of the top 25
last week, the sweep couldn't come
at a better time.
"It was tough losing last week to
Arizona. We thought we were really
close to winning that series," said
senior righthander Danny Sand
brink, who started Saturday's game.
"And the sweep this weekend was
huge for us, absolutely, as far as
thinking about postseason and kind
of getting back on track."
Friday's season-high crowd of
3,202 may have come for Fireworks
Night, but Appel (4-5) put on a
show of his own in the opener with
a career-best nine strikeouts across
eight innings, giving up two runs
(one earned) and getting the win.
Stanford never trailed, as it got on
the board early with a fielder's
choice and a sacrifice fly from fresh
man first baseman Brian Ragira.
Appel gave up a couple hits in the
second as Washington (13-30,4-14)
crawled to within 2-1 but struck out
the side in the third and continued
to cruise as Stanford built up a four
run lead through just four innings
against Flusky starter Geoff Brown,
who was chased after three-plus in
nings. Sophomore center fielder

Tyler Gaffney knocked in senior
catcher Zach Jones with his confer
ence-leading fifth triple in the
fourth, which stretched the lead to
5-1.
Zach Wright replaced Brown in
the fourth and matched Appel in
ning-for-inning, shutting down
Stanford until freshman right field
er Austin Wilson got an eighth-in
ning sacrifice fly for the Cardinal's
sixth run. Junior lefty Chris Reed
came in to get the save, allowing the
first two runners he faced to reach
base but coaxing a double play and
a groundout to ice the game at 6-2.
Before a dramatic ninth-inning
finish, Saturday's game looked to be
more of the same Sandbrink
cruised through seven innings, leav
ing with a 7-3 lead after striking out
six and walking two. But things got
shaky as soon as Reed took the
mound in the eighth, when the
Husky offense has its biggest inning
of the weekend. Second baseman
Jacob Lamb singled and first base
man Troy Scott doubled to open the
inning, then catcher B.K. Santy
looped one to the outfield to drive
in Lamb. Right fielder Chase Ansel
ment loaded the bases with another
single and Ryan Wiggins drove in a
pair before the Huskies tied the
game with a sacrifice bunt and an
RBI groundout.
"The comeback in the ninth is re
ally all I care about, but it was tough
for Reed for sure," Sandbrink said.
"I thought he had good stuff, and
those balls just found some holes. I
thought he pitched well and kind of
gave up some well-placed hits."
Jones, whom head coach Mark
Marquess penciled in for his 2011
debut in the leadoff spot this week
end, helped Stanford bounce back
in the ninth with a double off Adam
Cimber to open the frame. That
proved to be the only hit of the in
ning, as Gaffney sent him to third
with a fly out before a pair of inten
tional walks loaded the bases.
Cimber and the Huskies looked
poised to send it to extras in the next
at-bat, as the Washington closer had
senior Dave Giuliani down 0-2. But
the Cardinal left fielder knocked a
