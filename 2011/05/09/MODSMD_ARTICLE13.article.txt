# BACK ON TRACK
## BASEBALL SWEEPS HUSKIES 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford baseball may have
come away with it first series sweep
of the season over the visiting Wash
ington Huskies this weekend, but
the final result didn't preclude some
late-inning drama. After riding
eight solid innings from sophomore
righty Mark Appel to a 6-2 win on
Friday, Stanford made things inter
esting by surrendering a four-run
lead on Saturday before eking out
an 8-7 victory on Saturday and com
ing from behind with a six-run
eighth to win 7-2 on Sunday. The
No. 28 Cardinal (25-16,9-9 Pac-10)
evened its conference record with
the sweep and is back on track after
winning just one weekend series in
the past month.

After dropping out of the top 25
last week, the sweep couldn't come
at a better time.
"It was tough losing last week to
Arizona. We thought we were really
close to winning that series," said
senior righthander Danny Sand
brink, who started Saturday's game.
"And the sweep this weekend was
huge for us, absolutely, as far as
thinking about postseason and kind
of getting back on track."
Friday's season-high crowd of
3,202 may have come for Fireworks
Night, but Appel (4-5) put on a
show of his own in the opener with
a career-best nine strikeouts across
eight innings, giving up two runs
(one earned) and getting the win.
Stanford never trailed, as it got on
the board early with a fielder's
choice and a sacrifice fly from fresh
man first baseman Brian Ragira.
Appel gave up a couple hits in the
second as Washington (13-30,4-14)
crawled to within 2-1 but struck out
the side in the third and continued
to cruise as Stanford built up a four
run lead through just four innings
against Flusky starter Geoff Brown,
who was chased after three-plus in
nings. Sophomore center fielder

Tyler Gaffney knocked in senior
catcher Zach Jones with his confer
ence-leading fifth triple in the
fourth, which stretched the lead to
5-1.
Zach Wright replaced Brown in
the fourth and matched Appel in
ning-for-inning, shutting down
Stanford until freshman right field
er Austin Wilson got an eighth-in
ning sacrifice fly for the Cardinal's
sixth run. Junior lefty Chris Reed
came in to get the save, allowing the
first two runners he faced to reach
base but coaxing a double play and
a groundout to ice the game at 6-2.
Before a dramatic ninth-inning
finish, Saturday's game looked to be
more of the same Sandbrink
cruised through seven innings, leav
ing with a 7-3 lead after striking out
six and walking two. But things got
shaky as soon as Reed took the
mound in the eighth, when the
Husky offense has its biggest inning
of the weekend. Second baseman
Jacob Lamb singled and first base
man Troy Scott doubled to open the
inning, then catcher B.K. Santy
looped one to the outfield to drive
in Lamb. Right fielder Chase Ansel
ment loaded the bases with another
single and Ryan Wiggins drove in a
pair before the Huskies tied the
game with a sacrifice bunt and an
RBI groundout.
"The comeback in the ninth is re
ally all I care about, but it was tough
for Reed for sure," Sandbrink said.
"I thought he had good stuff, and
those balls just found some holes. I
thought he pitched well and kind of
gave up some well-placed hits."
Jones, whom head coach Mark
Marquess penciled in for his 2011
debut in the leadoff spot this week
end, helped Stanford bounce back
in the ninth with a double off Adam
Cimber to open the frame. That
proved to be the only hit of the in
ning, as Gaffney sent him to third
with a fly out before a pair of inten
tional walks loaded the bases.
Cimber and the Huskies looked
poised to send it to extras in the next
at-bat, as the Washington closer had
senior Dave Giuliani down 0-2. But
the Cardinal left fielder knocked a

screamer to second baseman Willy
Reel, who fumbled the ball and let
Jones score the winning run on an
error.
The late-inning heroics contin
ued on Sunday, as Stanford found
itself down 2-1 against freshman
righty Austin Voth through seven
innings. Cimber replaced the Wash
ington starter in the seventh and
had one solid inning, but despite a
10-1 record when leading after
seven, Cimber and the Huskies fell
apart in the next inning as Stanford
rallied for six runs.
Jones led off the rally once again
with an infield single, and sopho
more third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty got on with a single after
Gaffney flied out. That moved
Stanford ahead in the hits column
seven to eight and gave Ragi
ra a big opportunity with one out
and two men on.
The freshman came through,
nailing a two-run triple off the wall
in center to put Stanford up 3-2.
Kenny Diekroeger immediately
followed that with a double his
second of the game â€”to Ansel
ment in right field, scoring
Diekroeger for an insurance run.
That marked Cimber's last pitch, as
the usually effective reliever
stepped out for senior righthander
Jacob Clem.
Kenny's younger brother, desig
nated hitter Danny Diekroeger,
kept the run parade going, sneaking
a comebacker past Clem and into
center field. By then, the wheels
had clearly begun to come off for
Washington, as freshman second
baseman Lonnie Kauppila fol

lowed Diekroeger by reaching on a
fielding error by third baseman
Troy Scott.
The bleeding wouldn't stop
there, however, as Giuliani
knocked in an RBI double. Still
with just one out, the Huskies in
tentionally walked Wilson to load
the bases for the man who started
the inning, Jones. The Cardinal
catcher knocked a sac fly to right
field before Clem finally got out of
the inning by coaxing a grounder
from Gaffney.
Busick got into a bit of trouble
after a walk and a hit-by-pitch to
start the top of the ninth but coaxed
a double play out of Eric Peterson
and struck out Ty Afenir to end the
game at 7-2.
Stanford has plenty to feel good
about after the sweep, but one of
those positives is certainly Jones.
The veteran catcher is pushing his
average close to .250 after an
abysmal start to the season and had
four hits including two that
started crucial late-inning rallies
to go with four runs and a pair of
RBI out of the leadoff spot.
"I think it says a lot about his
work ethic, since he started the year
so poorly," Sandbrink said. "He's
spent a lot of extra time in practice
and in the cage, just to improve his
output, and it's really shown. He's
hitting a lot better, and he's given
the coaches confidence to put him
there. It's huge for us, because Zach
runs so well, and him being on base
in the top of the lineup is definitely
a sparkplug for us."
Stanford has a busy week ahead,
taking on Pacific in Stockton to
morrow at 6 p.m. before returning
home to play UC-Davis at 5:30 p.m.
on Tuesday.

ing from behind with a six-run
eighth to win 7-2 on Sunday. The
No. 28 Cardinal (25-16,9-9 Pac-10)
evened its conference record with
the sweep and is back on track after
winning just one weekend series in
the past month.

After dropping out of the top 25
last week, the sweep couldn't come
at a better time.
"It was tough losing last week to
Arizona. We thought we were really
close to winning that series," said
senior righthander Danny Sand
brink, who started Saturday's game.
"And the sweep this weekend was
huge for us, absolutely, as far as
thinking about postseason and kind
of getting back on track."
Friday's season-high crowd of
3,202 may have come for Fireworks
Night, but Appel (4-5) put on a
show of his own in the opener with
a career-best nine strikeouts across
eight innings, giving up two runs
(one earned) and getting the win.
Stanford never trailed, as it got on
the board early with a fielder's
choice and a sacrifice fly from fresh
man first baseman Brian Ragira.
Appel gave up a couple hits in the
second as Washington (13-30,4-14)
crawled to within 2-1 but struck out
the side in the third and continued
to cruise as Stanford built up a four
run lead through just four innings
against Flusky starter Geoff Brown,
who was chased after three-plus in
nings. Sophomore center fielder

Tyler Gaffney knocked in senior
catcher Zach Jones with his confer
ence-leading fifth triple in the
fourth, which stretched the lead to
5-1.
Zach Wright replaced Brown in
the fourth and matched Appel in
ning-for-inning, shutting down
Stanford until freshman right field
er Austin Wilson got an eighth-in
ning sacrifice fly for the Cardinal's
sixth run. Junior lefty Chris Reed
came in to get the save, allowing the
first two runners he faced to reach
base but coaxing a double play and
a groundout to ice the game at 6-2.
Before a dramatic ninth-inning
finish, Saturday's game looked to be
more of the same Sandbrink
cruised through seven innings, leav
ing with a 7-3 lead after striking out
six and walking two. But things got
shaky as soon as Reed took the
mound in the eighth, when the
Husky offense has its biggest inning
of the weekend. Second baseman
Jacob Lamb singled and first base
man Troy Scott doubled to open the
inning, then catcher B.K. Santy
looped one to the outfield to drive
in Lamb. Right fielder Chase Ansel
ment loaded the bases with another
single and Ryan Wiggins drove in a
pair before the Huskies tied the
game with a sacrifice bunt and an
RBI groundout.
"The comeback in the ninth is re
ally all I care about, but it was tough
for Reed for sure," Sandbrink said.
"I thought he had good stuff, and
those balls just found some holes. I
thought he pitched well and kind of
gave up some well-placed hits."
Jones, whom head coach Mark
Marquess penciled in for his 2011
debut in the leadoff spot this week
end, helped Stanford bounce back
in the ninth with a double off Adam
Cimber to open the frame. That
proved to be the only hit of the in
ning, as Gaffney sent him to third
with a fly out before a pair of inten
tional walks loaded the bases.
Cimber and the Huskies looked
poised to send it to extras in the next
at-bat, as the Washington closer had
senior Dave Giuliani down 0-2. But
the Cardinal left fielder knocked a

screamer to second baseman Willy
Reel, who fumbled the ball and let
Jones score the winning run on an
error.
The late-inning heroics contin
ued on Sunday, as Stanford found
itself down 2-1 against freshman
righty Austin Voth through seven
innings. Cimber replaced the Wash
ington starter in the seventh and
had one solid inning, but despite a
10-1 record when leading after
seven, Cimber and the Huskies fell
apart in the next inning as Stanford
rallied for six runs.
Jones led off the rally once again
with an infield single, and sopho
more third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty got on with a single after
Gaffney flied out. That moved
Stanford ahead in the hits column
seven to eight and gave Ragi
ra a big opportunity with one out
and two men on.
The freshman came through,
nailing a two-run triple off the wall
in center to put Stanford up 3-2.
Kenny Diekroeger immediately
followed that with a double his
second of the game â€”to Ansel
ment in right field, scoring
Diekroeger for an insurance run.
That marked Cimber's last pitch, as
the usually effective reliever
stepped out for senior righthander
Jacob Clem.
Kenny's younger brother, desig
nated hitter Danny Diekroeger,
kept the run parade going, sneaking
a comebacker past Clem and into
center field. By then, the wheels
had clearly begun to come off for
Washington, as freshman second
baseman Lonnie Kauppila fol

lowed Diekroeger by reaching on a
fielding error by third baseman
Troy Scott.
The bleeding wouldn't stop
there, however, as Giuliani
knocked in an RBI double. Still
with just one out, the Huskies in
tentionally walked Wilson to load
the bases for the man who started
the inning, Jones. The Cardinal
catcher knocked a sac fly to right
field before Clem finally got out of
the inning by coaxing a grounder
from Gaffney.
Busick got into a bit of trouble
after a walk and a hit-by-pitch to
start the top of the ninth but coaxed
a double play out of Eric Peterson
and struck out Ty Afenir to end the
game at 7-2.
Stanford has plenty to feel good
about after the sweep, but one of
those positives is certainly Jones.
The veteran catcher is pushing his
average close to .250 after an
abysmal start to the season and had
four hits including two that
started crucial late-inning rallies
to go with four runs and a pair of
RBI out of the leadoff spot.
"I think it says a lot about his
work ethic, since he started the year
so poorly," Sandbrink said. "He's
spent a lot of extra time in practice
and in the cage, just to improve his
output, and it's really shown. He's
hitting a lot better, and he's given
the coaches confidence to put him
there. It's huge for us, because Zach
runs so well, and him being on base
in the top of the lineup is definitely
a sparkplug for us."
Stanford has a busy week ahead,
taking on Pacific in Stockton to
morrow at 6 p.m. before returning
home to play UC-Davis at 5:30 p.m.
on Tuesday.
