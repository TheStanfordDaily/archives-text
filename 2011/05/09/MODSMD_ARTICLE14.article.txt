## Oregon shuts down Card, takes series in Eugene 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball dropped two
of three in Eugene over the week
end, snapping the Cardinal's 10-
game win streak over Oregon and
returning both teams to .500 in
conference play.

The series leaves No. 10 Stan
ford and No. 12 Oregon with iden
tical records on the year, both at
37-13 overall and 9-9 within the
Pac-10. Stanford started strong
with a dominant 4-1 victory on Fri
day but would never hold a lead
again during the series. The Cardi
nal bats fell silent Saturday, get
ting shut out 2-0. The offense sput
tered back to life on Sunday but
stalled when it counted, stranding
a remarkable 15 runners over
seven innings while converting
only once in a 4-2 loss.
The series opener featured a
brilliant performance by sopho
more pitcher Teagan Gerhart,
along with a pair of stolen base
records. Gerhart fanned a career
high 15 batters in a complete
game win, giving up just one
earned run on three hits. It was her
22nd complete game and 21st win
of the season.
Neither team was able to
scratch out runs through the first
three innings. The Cardinal came
close in the second, when junior
left-fielder Maya Burns was
nailed at the plate after a throwing
error by Oregon's first baseman
Monique Fuiava.
Oregon broke the stalemate in

the fourth, as Fuiava tripled in
Samantha Pappas who had
reached first earlier on a walk.
In the fifth, Hassman walked
with one out and advanced to sec
ond by stealing her 32nd base of
the year. In doing so, she set two
new Stanford records in the cate
gory; she broke Jessica Mendoza's
2001 single-season steals record to
add to her own legacy, but it was
also the 83rd stolen base for the
Cardinal this year, breaking last
season's record of 82.
Stanford would take the lead in
the sixth, capitalizing on two Ore
gon errors. Freshman pinch run
ner Caitlyn Pura scored and soph
omore pinch hitter Alix Van
Zandt reached safely on an error
by Pappas in center field. Van
Zandt came around to score as
junior third baseman Jenna Be
cerra singled up the middle, giving
Stanford a 2-1 lead.
The Card padded its lead in the
final frame when freshman right
fielder Michelle Prong went yard
to right, scoring herself and junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen. The
home run, Prong's fourth, gave
Stanford its final 4-1 lead. Ore
gon's Jessica Moore took the loss,
moving to 18-8 on the year.
Moore was back in the circle
for Oregon on Saturday but with
much more impressive stuff. She
allowed just five hits and struck
out eight in a complete-game
shutout. Stanford senior Ashley
Chinn also pitched a good game,
allowing just two runs, but took
the loss due to lack of run support.
The loss dropped Chinn to 16-4 on
the year.
Oregon got on the board in the
first, when shortstop Kelsey
Chambers hit a solo shot to left
field.
Oregon tallied again in the
third, increasing its lead to 2-0.
Second baseman Kaylan Howard
led off the inning with a double,
