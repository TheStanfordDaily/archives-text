## Oregon shuts down Card, takes series in Eugene 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball dropped two
of three in Eugene over the week
end, snapping the Cardinal's 10-
game win streak over Oregon and
returning both teams to .500 in
conference play.

The series leaves No. 10 Stan
ford and No. 12 Oregon with iden
tical records on the year, both at
37-13 overall and 9-9 within the
Pac-10. Stanford started strong
with a dominant 4-1 victory on Fri
day but would never hold a lead
again during the series. The Cardi
nal bats fell silent Saturday, get
ting shut out 2-0. The offense sput
tered back to life on Sunday but
stalled when it counted, stranding
a remarkable 15 runners over
seven innings while converting
only once in a 4-2 loss.
The series opener featured a
brilliant performance by sopho
more pitcher Teagan Gerhart,
along with a pair of stolen base
records. Gerhart fanned a career
high 15 batters in a complete
game win, giving up just one
earned run on three hits. It was her
22nd complete game and 21st win
of the season.
Neither team was able to
scratch out runs through the first
three innings. The Cardinal came
close in the second, when junior
left-fielder Maya Burns was
nailed at the plate after a throwing
error by Oregon's first baseman
Monique Fuiava.
Oregon broke the stalemate in

the fourth, as Fuiava tripled in
Samantha Pappas who had
reached first earlier on a walk.
In the fifth, Hassman walked
with one out and advanced to sec
ond by stealing her 32nd base of
the year. In doing so, she set two
new Stanford records in the cate
gory; she broke Jessica Mendoza's
2001 single-season steals record to
add to her own legacy, but it was
also the 83rd stolen base for the
Cardinal this year, breaking last
season's record of 82.
Stanford would take the lead in
the sixth, capitalizing on two Ore
gon errors. Freshman pinch run
ner Caitlyn Pura scored and soph
omore pinch hitter Alix Van
Zandt reached safely on an error
by Pappas in center field. Van
Zandt came around to score as
junior third baseman Jenna Be
cerra singled up the middle, giving
Stanford a 2-1 lead.
The Card padded its lead in the
final frame when freshman right
fielder Michelle Prong went yard
to right, scoring herself and junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen. The
home run, Prong's fourth, gave
Stanford its final 4-1 lead. Ore
gon's Jessica Moore took the loss,
moving to 18-8 on the year.
Moore was back in the circle
for Oregon on Saturday but with
much more impressive stuff. She
allowed just five hits and struck
out eight in a complete-game
shutout. Stanford senior Ashley
Chinn also pitched a good game,
allowing just two runs, but took
the loss due to lack of run support.
The loss dropped Chinn to 16-4 on
the year.
Oregon got on the board in the
first, when shortstop Kelsey
Chambers hit a solo shot to left
field.
Oregon tallied again in the
third, increasing its lead to 2-0.

left side.
Sunday once again saw Moore
on the mound for Oregon it was
her third straight game, although
this time in relief. Gerhart was back
in the circle for Stanford but picked
up the loss to fall to 21-9.
Stanford's offense recovered
from its poor showing the day be
fore and would've scored more if
not for some poor luck. Cardinal
hitters had Oregon's pitchers on
the ropes and repeatedly threat
ened to score, leaving at least two
men on base every single inning, to
taling 15 in all.
The Ducks took an early 2-0
lead on a two-run home run by right
fielder Christie Nieto in the second,
but the Cardinal halved that lead in
the fifth when Hansen hit an RBI
blooper to right field, scoring Be
cerra. Oregon struck twice more in
the bottom of the sixth, again on a
home run, this time by catcher
Alexa Peterson.
Stanford refused to go down

without a fight though, scoring one
in the seventh and stranding two
more. Hassman singled in Pura with
two outs, but Hansen grounded out
to end the game. Moore got the win
for Oregon in relief, her second in
two days. She was Oregon's pitcher
of record for three straight games.
Despite the series loss, Stanford
is focused on the future.
"As long as we continue to com
pete and remain mentally tough,
our confidence as a team will con
tinue to grow," said sophomore
Jenna Rich. "We'll eventually take
care of business in Oklahoma City

ries."
Up next, Stanford closes out its
regular season at top-ranked Ari

Sun Devils are red hot at the mo

ranking in the country and the top

Sunday once again saw Moore
on the mound for Oregon it was
her third straight game, although
this time in relief. Gerhart was back
in the circle for Stanford but picked
up the loss to fall to 21-9.
Stanford's offense recovered
from its poor showing the day be
fore and would've scored more if
not for some poor luck. Cardinal
hitters had Oregon's pitchers on
the ropes and repeatedly threat
ened to score, leaving at least two
men on base every single inning, to
taling 15 in all.
The Ducks took an early 2-0
lead on a two-run home run by right
fielder Christie Nieto in the second,
but the Cardinal halved that lead in
the fifth when Hansen hit an RBI
blooper to right field, scoring Be
cerra. Oregon struck twice more in
the bottom of the sixth, again on a
home run, this time by catcher
Alexa Peterson.
Stanford refused to go down

without a fight though, scoring one
in the seventh and stranding two
more. Hassman singled in Pura with
two outs, but Hansen grounded out
to end the game. Moore got the win
for Oregon in relief, her second in
two days. She was Oregon's pitcher
of record for three straight games.
Despite the series loss, Stanford
is focused on the future.
"As long as we continue to com
pete and remain mentally tough,
our confidence as a team will con
tinue to grow," said sophomore
Jenna Rich. "We'll eventually take
care of business in Oklahoma City

ries."
Up next, Stanford closes out its
regular season at top-ranked Ari
zona State (48-5,15-3 Pac-10). The
Sun Devils are red hot at the mo
ment, holding not only the top
ranking in the country and the top
spot in the conference standings
but having swept their past three
conference series.

Stanford Softball dropped two
of three in Eugene over the week
end, snapping the Cardinal's 10-
game win streak over Oregon and
returning both teams to .500 in
conference play.

The series leaves No. 10 Stan
ford and No. 12 Oregon with iden
tical records on the year, both at
37-13 overall and 9-9 within the
Pac-10. Stanford started strong
with a dominant 4-1 victory on Fri
day but would never hold a lead
again during the series. The Cardi
nal bats fell silent Saturday, get
ting shut out 2-0. The offense sput
tered back to life on Sunday but
stalled when it counted, stranding
a remarkable 15 runners over
seven innings while converting
only once in a 4-2 loss.
The series opener featured a
brilliant performance by sopho
more pitcher Teagan Gerhart,
along with a pair of stolen base
records. Gerhart fanned a career
high 15 batters in a complete
game win, giving up just one
earned run on three hits. It was her
22nd complete game and 21st win
of the season.
Neither team was able to
scratch out runs through the first
three innings. The Cardinal came
close in the second, when junior
left-fielder Maya Burns was
nailed at the plate after a throwing
error by Oregon's first baseman
Monique Fuiava.
Oregon broke the stalemate in

the fourth, as Fuiava tripled in
Samantha Pappas who had
reached first earlier on a walk.
In the fifth, Hassman walked
with one out and advanced to sec
ond by stealing her 32nd base of
the year. In doing so, she set two
new Stanford records in the cate
gory; she broke Jessica Mendoza's
2001 single-season steals record to
add to her own legacy, but it was
also the 83rd stolen base for the
Cardinal this year, breaking last
season's record of 82.
Stanford would take the lead in
the sixth, capitalizing on two Ore
gon errors. Freshman pinch run
ner Caitlyn Pura scored and soph
omore pinch hitter Alix Van
Zandt reached safely on an error
by Pappas in center field. Van
Zandt came around to score as
junior third baseman Jenna Be
cerra singled up the middle, giving
Stanford a 2-1 lead.
The Card padded its lead in the
final frame when freshman right
fielder Michelle Prong went yard
to right, scoring herself and junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen. The
home run, Prong's fourth, gave
Stanford its final 4-1 lead. Ore
