## Jeremy Green stays in NBA Draft, ends Stanford career 
### â€”Jacob Jaffe 
Junior guard Jeremy Green has
decided to stay in the NBA Draft
and skip his senior season at Stan
ford, as announced by head coach
Johnny Dawkins. Green put his
name in the draft on April 28 but
did not hire an agent, keeping him
eligible to return to school by May
8. However, Green chose to remain
in the draft, ending his college ca
reer.
In three years on the Farm,
Green had a major impact, starting
62 of his 97 career games and aver
aging 13 points per contest. He
holds the school record for three
pointers in a season with 93, and he
ranks second on the career list with
228 triples.

Last year, Green ranked fifth in
the Pac-10 in scoring with 16.7
points per game, earning him All-
Pac-10 honors for the second con
secutive year. He shot 42.9 percent
from beyond the arc and made 2.8
threes per game, good for second in
the conference. He stepped up his
game over the final stretch of the
season, scoring over 20 points in
eight of Stanford's last 11 games.
In Green's three years, Stanford
compiled a 49-48 overall record and
made the postseason just once, a
CBI semifinal appearance in his
freshman year.
ESPN.com's Chad Ford ranks
Green as the 107 th prospect in this
year's draft. Draft Express.com
ranks Green 54th among NCAA
juniors. The NBA Draft takes place
June 23 in Newark, N.J.
