## ASSU explains spending cap on campaigns $4OO cap on class president slates sparked by 2011 race 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
One of the last bills passed by the 12th
ASSU Undergraduate Senate before its
April 26 turnover imposed a campaign
spending cap of $4OO on future class presi
dent slates. The cap came after years of what
many considered overspending on branded
apparel to promote candidates.
"The point of the campaign is to get you
to actually engage with people one on one,
so that you aren't just buying really extrava
gant parties or merchandise," said Dan Ash
ton 'l4, deputy chair of the 13th Undergrad
uate Senate.
The cap was set at $4OO in order to strike
a balance between allowing candidates to
get their names out around campus and re
stricting them to a reasonable and fair level
of promotion.
"The idea is to limit the need to blow
money on it and make it more about the can
didates and the issues that they're standing
on," Ashton said. "I think everyone would
agree that... it was the necessity to [in
order to] get your name out there you had to
be that extravagant."
Lauren Felice 'l4, whose slate Face To
Face lost in the most recent sophomore class
president election, co-sponsored the bill in
the Senate, Felice said the name of her slate
came from the group's hope to emphasize
personal communication.
"It was a risky tactic that didn't pan out,
but I still feel like the concept has value," she
said.
For class president slates, money is large
ly spent either on merchandise, like shirts
and sunglasses, or on gatherings and parties.
Felice said the $4OO cap "cuts out heavy
spending," like buying hundreds of expen
sive items for the class, but still allows for
spreading the slate name in small ways, like
flyers.
"I felt like in all of the class president
races, money was a factor," Felice said.
Although Face To Face did not keep an
exact account of its spending, Felice said the
group did exceed $4OO in its campaign
spending.
The winning slate for sophomore class
president, The Quad, aimed to in
crease its visibility by handing out
t-shirts, sunglasses and bike seat
covers in addition to posting flyers
and a large banner near Meyer Li
brary. Members of the slate said
they supported the spending cap
bill.
"Spending caps allow slates to
demonstrate how resourceful they
can be," said Dhruv Amin 'l4, a
member of The Quad slate. "When
elected, they have to be resourceful
with the limited budget that class of
ficers have."
Amin said the group debated
how much to spend on the campaign
beforehand and, based on the budg
ets of past slates, self-imposed a
spending cap of $6OO to try to show
that they could spread their name
inexpensively by finding good deals.
Still, Amin said spending was the
lesser part of the campaign.
"It's only going to help you get
your name out there, but there's no
replacement for getting out and
meeting everyone," he said. "We al
ways went in knowing we weren't
going to win it without knowing the
entire freshman class."
In addition to the promotion of
personal interaction during a cam
paign, the cap also serves to lower
the financial barrier to be able to run
on a class president slate. The 12th
Undergraduate Senate passed a

similar bill in November, limiting
ASSU Executive slates to $l,OOO
after looking back on a 2008 election
where each executive slate spent
nearly $4,000 campaigning.
"People have been trying to
make it a fair system for a while so
that people don't spend over the
top," Ashton said. "It became the
kind of thing where you needed to
spend a certain amount of money to
compete with other slates."
"When people see people walk
ing around with a slate's t-shirts
everywhere, I think it's a little intim
idating for other people who in the
future feel like they want to run for
class president but don't feel like
they can spend the money to pro
vide that," Felice said.
According to Ashton, there is
also a movement in the ASSU to
potentially provide some cam
paign funding to serious candi
dates who are on financial aid in
order to further level the field. No
specific bill has yet been proposed
on this matter.
The class president spending
cap bill was originally intended to
impose a similar cap on Under
graduate Senate candidates but
was cut down to cover only class
president slates. The main reason
for striking the language regarding
senators was confusion over the
typical senate candidate endorse
ments and how to account for
goods that the candidates them
selves do not purchase.
