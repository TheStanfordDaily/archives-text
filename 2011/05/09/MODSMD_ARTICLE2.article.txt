## ASSU explains spending cap on campaigns $4OO cap on class president slates sparked by 2011 race 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
One of the last bills passed by the 12th
ASSU Undergraduate Senate before its
April 26 turnover imposed a campaign
spending cap of $4OO on future class presi
dent slates. The cap came after years of what
many considered overspending on branded
apparel to promote candidates.
"The point of the campaign is to get you
to actually engage with people one on one,
so that you aren't just buying really extrava
gant parties or merchandise," said Dan Ash
ton 'l4, deputy chair of the 13th Undergrad
uate Senate.
The cap was set at $4OO in order to strike
a balance between allowing candidates to
get their names out around campus and re
stricting them to a reasonable and fair level
of promotion.
"The idea is to limit the need to blow
money on it and make it more about the can
didates and the issues that they're standing
on," Ashton said. "I think everyone would
agree that... it was the necessity to [in
order to] get your name out there you had to
be that extravagant."
Lauren Felice 'l4, whose slate Face To
Face lost in the most recent sophomore class
president election, co-sponsored the bill in
the Senate, Felice said the name of her slate
came from the group's hope to emphasize
personal communication.
"It was a risky tactic that didn't pan out,
but I still feel like the concept has value," she
said.
For class president slates, money is large
ly spent either on merchandise, like shirts
and sunglasses, or on gatherings and parties.
Felice said the $4OO cap "cuts out heavy
spending," like buying hundreds of expen
sive items for the class, but still allows for
spreading the slate name in small ways, like
flyers.
"I felt like in all of the class president
races, money was a factor," Felice said.
Although Face To Face did not keep an
exact account of its spending, Felice said the
group did exceed $4OO in its campaign
spending.
