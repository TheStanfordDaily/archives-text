# KNBR WINS RIGHTS
## Cardinal sports switch to 1050 AM; effect on KZSU unclear 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford sports are getting a new home at
least on the airwaves.
Beginning next August, KNBR 1050 AM
will have exclusive rights to broadcast Cardinal
football and men's basketball games, a change
from current provider XTRA Sports 860
(KTRB), which has carried the University's
games for the past three years. Cardinal Sports
LLC, the multimedia rights holder for Stanford
Athletics and a business unit of Learfield

Sports, announced the agreement last Tuesday
in a press release.
According to Keith Kowalski, an affiliate
manager at Learfield Sports, the switch has
been in the works since last September when
XTRA Sports 860 went into receivership and
was taken over by Comerica Bank. The sta
tion's financial troubles were a primary motiva
tion behind the Cardinal's search for a new
broadcasting partner, he said.
"At that point, we decided to look for anoth
er station, because the future of KTRB was still
in doubt," Kowalski said.

"In September, we really canvassed the mar
ket," he added. "We were basically searching all
major players in the market, and we were trying
to determine who would be a good fit for us...
we also wanted a station that thought we were a
good fit for them."
This search for a new station intensified in
January, Kowalski said, following the Cardinal's
victory over Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl.
"I think the interest obviously grew," he said.
"The nice thing about Stanford is that it's al-
ways been a winning program, but I
think with that Orange Bowl appear
ance, it certainly took the program to
an even higher level than what it was
before."
When Cardinal Sports LLC's
contract with XTRA Sports 860 ex
pired in April, it decided to ink a deal
with KNBR, which won out over
other Bay Area radio stations like
Sportsßadio 95.7 (KBWF). Sport
sßadio 95.7 formerly "The Wolf,"
an FM country music station
made the switch to an all sports for
mat last month after obtaining the
rights to broadcast San Jose Sharks
and Oakland A's games.
Dwight Walker, the vice presi
dent and marketing manager at En
tercom, the owner of KBWF, said
the company had been in negotia
tions to broadcast Stanford football
games until late last month when
Cardinal Sports LLC cut off talks,
citing that it was close to a deal with
another station.
Kowalski said Cardinal Sports
LLC decided to go with KNBR, be
cause it was "a proven radio station,"
and because they were looking to
have the University's football, men's
basketball and coaches' shows to all
be housed under the same station.

"Everyone in the Bay Area
knows KNBR," Kowalski said.
"They know where to find the Gi
ants and the 49ers and the Warriors.
It's just a great station to be on."
"We have had games on there in
the past, and I think it just being the
sports leader in the market will
allow us to really attach ourselves
with that," he added. "Hopefully,
the success of the program will con
tinue, and we'll be able to stay with
this station for several years to
come."
The only major change between
the new contract with KNBR and
the old one with XTRA Sports 860
is a reduction in the amount of
coaches' shows, Kowalski said.
KNBR will air 10 coaches' shows,
called "Inside Stanford Sports,"
throughout the year or approxi
mately one show per month.
It is still unclear how the change
will affect KZSU, the University's
student-run radio station, which cur
rently broadcasts the Cardinal's
football and men's basketball
games. Kowalski said, "There will
not be another station in the Bay
Area that will broadcast Stanford

athletics," but also said he was unfa
miliar with KZSU's contract. He did
not know if the deal would impact
the station's previous agreement.
KZSU programming director
Mark Mollineaux 'l3 said the sta
tion's current contract gives it the
right to broadcast all Cardinal foot
ball games, including bowl games.
This agreement allowed the station
to air the Orange Bowl this year, he
said.
While KZSU hopes to continue
carrying men's basketball and foot
ball games, the loss of these sports
would not hinder the main thrust of
its sports department, which is
women's basketball and baseball,
Mollineaux said. KZSU is currently
the only radio station that broadcasts
these sports.
"We hope to continue to broad
cast as we do," Mollineaux said. "The
thing we are most proud of is our ex
clusives with women's basketball
and baseball, but obviously we are
trying to find everything we can do to
keep doing what we're doing."

tions to broadcast Stanford football
games until late last month when
Cardinal Sports LLC cut off talks,
citing that it was close to a deal with
another station.
Kowalski said Cardinal Sports
LLC decided to go with KNBR, be
cause it was "a proven radio station,"
and because they were looking to
have the University's football, men's
basketball and coaches' shows to all
be housed under the same station.

"Everyone in the Bay Area
knows KNBR," Kowalski said.
"They know where to find the Gi
ants and the 49ers and the Warriors.
It's just a great station to be on."
"We have had games on there in
the past, and I think it just being the
sports leader in the market will
allow us to really attach ourselves
with that," he added. "Hopefully,
the success of the program will con
tinue, and we'll be able to stay with
this station for several years to
come."
The only major change between
the new contract with KNBR and
the old one with XTRA Sports 860
is a reduction in the amount of
coaches' shows, Kowalski said.
KNBR will air 10 coaches' shows,
called "Inside Stanford Sports,"
throughout the year or approxi
mately one show per month.
It is still unclear how the change
will affect KZSU, the University's
student-run radio station, which cur
rently broadcasts the Cardinal's
football and men's basketball
games. Kowalski said, "There will
not be another station in the Bay
Area that will broadcast Stanford

athletics," but also said he was unfa
miliar with KZSU's contract. He did
not know if the deal would impact
the station's previous agreement.
KZSU programming director
Mark Mollineaux 'l3 said the sta
tion's current contract gives it the
right to broadcast all Cardinal foot
ball games, including bowl games.
This agreement allowed the station
to air the Orange Bowl this year, he
said.
While KZSU hopes to continue
carrying men's basketball and foot
ball games, the loss of these sports
would not hinder the main thrust of
its sports department, which is
women's basketball and baseball,
Mollineaux said. KZSU is currently
the only radio station that broadcasts
these sports.
"We hope to continue to broad
cast as we do," Mollineaux said. "The
thing we are most proud of is our ex
clusives with women's basketball
and baseball, but obviously we are
trying to find everything we can do to
keep doing what we're doing."
