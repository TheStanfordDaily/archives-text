## Conference focuses on women in politics 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
A star-studded lineup of speakers filled the medical
school's Li Ka Shing Center on Saturday, May 7 for the Stan
ford Conference on Women's Political Empowerment,
sponsored by Stanford in Government. The event brought
together some of the biggest names in Bay Area and Cali
fornia politics, including Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren '7O
from San Jose, Attorney General Kamala Harris and Elaine
Alquist, a state senator representing Santa Clara.
The event centered around four panel discussions, each
of which explored a different obstacle to increased political
participation by women. A panel featuring law professor
Deborah Rhode discussed the gender bias in media cover
age of candidates for office and explained how the media in
dustry itself lacked large numbers of women.
The most well attended panel, entitled "Strategies for
Empowerment," brought together Lofgren and three Bay
Area activists whose nonprofits sought to help women be
come more politically active. The panelists pointed to a se
vere lack of participation by women in national and local
politics. Mary Hughes of Hughes & Company, a political
consultancy, explained that about 16 percent of congres
sional representatives are women, and that the number of
women candidates has basically stagnated since 1992.
Hughes also said the issue was not that male candidates
were generally more successful in politics than their female
counterparts, but that there are simply many more men run
ning for office than women.
"If women run, they win in the same proportions as
men," Hughes said. "So it's not because we don't know how
to win. We raise the same amount of money."
"What we don't know how to do very well is figure out why
women aren't running," she added.
Anne Moses, the director of IG
NITE, a non-profit geared toward
helping women in high school and
college become more politically ac
tive, shed some light on the issues
that prevent women from running
for office. She highlighted several is

sues, including a general lack of polit
ical awareness among young people.
"When Nancy Pelosi was Speaker
of the House, in San Francisco, stu
dents didn't recognize her name, and
they didn't know what Speaker of
the House was," she said. "We were
sitting in San Francisco, in her dis
trict, where she was in the paper
every minute of every day."
Moses added that women face a
set of challenges in running for office
that are not experienced by their
male counterparts. Most prominent

among these obstacles were the feel
ing that women are unqualified, gen
erally have less robust support net
works and the inherent difficulties in
simultaneously running for office
and having a family life.
"Not only do women feel less qual
ified than men when they are objec
tively qualified, but they actually
place higher value on having qualifi
cations," she said. "They think that
you need to have multiple advanced
degrees to run for office. Men don't
actually think that, and in fact they're
right."
Lofgren described her political
career, which began upon her gradu
ation from Stanford in 1970 with an
internship at the office of California
Congressman Don Edwards, whose
seat she later won in 1994. She spoke
generally about her experiences as a
woman in Congress.
When one member of the audi
ence asked whether it was better to
support a liberal male candidate or a
conservative woman, Lofgren re
sponded that policy positions took
precedence.
"Not all feminists are women,"
she said.

The conference closed with an ad
dress from Harris, the first woman to
become California's attorney gener
al. She described the arc of her ca
reer, from her time in the Alameda
County prosecutor's office to her
successful bid to become San Fran
cisco's district attorney.
She described the type of ques
tions she faced right after becoming
the DA in the city.
"The reporter would come up to

me and put a camera and micro
phone in my face and say, 'So, what's
it like to be the first women district
attorney of San Francisco?"' Harris
said. "I said, 'Honestly, I don't know
what to tell you. I've always been a
woman.' And then I would say, 'But
I'm sure a man could do the job just
as well.'"
