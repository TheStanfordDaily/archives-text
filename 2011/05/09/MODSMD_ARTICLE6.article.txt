ter for Corporate Governance and the

Legal experts from Chinese and American universities gathered at the Law School
for a conference entitled "Law and the Chinese Transformation." Increasing uniformity
between U.S. and Chinese law was hotly debated by various panelists.
Chinese law, giving academic credit
for language courses, hosting speak
er series on Chinese culture and ex
panding exchange programs with
schools in China.
Weixing Shen, the vice dean at
Tsinghua School of Law, added that
Chinese law schools are responding
to growing legal market interde
pendence by offering courses in
common law as well.
"Decades ago, we didn't teach
courses in tort law," Kramer said.
"We taught courses in California
tort law. Only as growing consisten
cy emerged across the states, were
we able to teach principles of tort
law that would allow students to
take these principles and under
stand tort law in each state."
Kramer remarked that this trend
might continue across international
borders, paving the way for increas
ing universality in legal education.
However, Li Guo, the assistant
dean at Peking University Law
School, argued that interdepend
ence would not bring about stan
dardization of legal education

across both countries.
"One thing we will not do is
eliminate our current bachelor of
laws program," he said.
Remarks by the audience pre
empted the topic of the following
panel on the rule of law in China.
For audience member Michael
Moore, general counsel at Fujitsu,
the event sparked a lingering ques
tion.
"Will increasing interdepend
ence and convergence in legal mar
ket and education lead to China
adopting a precedent-based com
mon law system?" he asked.
Although Moore was hesitant to
say that much progress in rule of
law could be achieved without sig
nificant change in China's political
system, he was optimistic about re
forms that are occurring in non-po
litically sensitive sectors.
The panel on U.S. and Chinese
legal education was followed by a
keynote speech by Condoleezza
Rice, political science professor and
former U.S. secretary of state, who
spoke on recent trends in U.S.-
China relations over the past
decade.
When asked to comment on the
biggest prerequisite for China's fur
ther progress toward the rule of law,
Rice said, "China's leaders need to

learn not to fear its people."
The speech was interrupted by
two members of the audience who
stood up and protested against de
cisions of the Bush Administration
regarding the Iraq war, calling Rice
a "war criminal." The protestors
were escorted out of the conference
room by security guards.
In an interview with The Daily,
second-year law student Michelle
Yuan, co-president of the China
Law and Policy Association, said
her motivation for organizing the
event stemmed from students' job
interview experiences.
"We realized that a lot of firms in
the valley have Chinese ties," Yuan
said.
Yuan noted that firms were in
terested in going to the Chinese
market or wanted to develop rela
tions with China.
"So when we put together this
conference, we knew that it would
appeal to a lot of law students," she
added.
In fact, Yuan observed that the
approximate 400 registered partici
pants were evenly split between law
students, attorneys and local com
pany representatives.
