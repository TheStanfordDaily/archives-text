## SSD airport shuttle starts new service 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students traveling home via San Francis
co International and Mineta San Jose Inter
national airports for summer vacation will
have an additional option for transportation
to the airport, as the ASSU is set to expand
its shuttle service to include spring quarter.
After partnering with Super Shuttle, the
shuttle service will cost $l3, down from the
winter break rate of $l5, and students will
be able to purchase tickets online via the
ASSU website.
"In terms of major changes for the shut
tle service: one, the cost is going down for
the tickets; two, more students are using it;
three, we're being more sustainable and
four, we're expanding the services so it
doesn't just operate during winter but also
during spring," said Ernestine Fu 'l3, the ex
ecutive director of the ASSU Student Ser
vices Division (SSD), which operates the
shuttle.
Winter break's shuttle service posted an
approximate $2,000 loss, despite the fact
that tickets were $l6, but several steps have
been taken to make it profitable again.
These steps include operating the shuttle
under SSD and hiring a director for the pro
gram.
"Normally, the shuttle service is
a little disorganized, in that it's
under ASSU as a whole, so you
have the executive presidents and
VPs trying to run it," Fu said. "Now
it's been shifted to the Student Ser
vices Division under more scalable
projects like the Stanford Concert
Network, Student-Initiated Cours
es and the Wellness Room."
This winter break's partnership
with Super Shuttle also increased
cost efficiency, as buses are now
being replaced with cars and vans.
"The main problem in a bus
with fifty seats is it doesn't fill up,"
Fu said.
"This was the first time we used
cars and vans," she said. "Pretty
much they all filled up."
The changes have resulted in fi
nancial gains for the ASSU. Fu said
"a little over 300 students" pur
chased tickets for last winter
break, resulting in the first prof
itable season for the shuttle.
She said numbers published in
January indicated that 362 riders
had generated $5,340 in revenue,
more than compensating for the

ASSU's $5,112 in costs.
"The shuttle service operates at
zero dollars right now for ASSU,
except we have a shuttle service di
rector who we pay a stipend in
order to help manage the logistics,
and we have a couple interns
working on the project," Fu said.
The decision to expand the pro
gram to include summer transfers
was the product of increased person
nel attention as well as positive stu
dent feedback from winter break.
"Students were thanking us, be
cause they thought the winter
break shuttle service operated very
smoothly," she said. "People actual
ly emailed me after the winter
break shuttle service asking if we
could provide tickets from the air
port back to campus after break."
Furthermore, SSD is taking
steps to make the service more sus
tainable. In addition to the buses
to-vans transition, Fu said this
summer's operations would be en
tirely paperless. All marketing will
be done online via the ASSU web
site and social media such as Face
book. Ticket sales, meanwhile, will
be operated via eGroups and the
SSD website. Bookings for the
shuttle open today.
