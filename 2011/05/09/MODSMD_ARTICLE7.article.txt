## SSD airport shuttle starts new service 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students traveling home via San Francis
co International and Mineta San Jose Inter
national airports for summer vacation will
have an additional option for transportation
to the airport, as the ASSU is set to expand
its shuttle service to include spring quarter.
After partnering with Super Shuttle, the
shuttle service will cost $l3, down from the
winter break rate of $l5, and students will
be able to purchase tickets online via the
ASSU website.
"In terms of major changes for the shut
tle service: one, the cost is going down for
the tickets; two, more students are using it;
three, we're being more sustainable and
four, we're expanding the services so it
doesn't just operate during winter but also
during spring," said Ernestine Fu 'l3, the ex
ecutive director of the ASSU Student Ser
vices Division (SSD), which operates the
shuttle.
Winter break's shuttle service posted an
approximate $2,000 loss, despite the fact
that tickets were $l6, but several steps have
been taken to make it profitable again.
These steps include operating the shuttle
under SSD and hiring a director for the pro
gram.
