band, The Sea People, is made up of
students, and the fountain is the

restaurant in Palo Alto.
On Saturday afternoon, White
Plaza was home to "A Taste of Palo

ganized by fraternity Phi Kappa Psi
and sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi

(AEPhi) to benefit the Ecumenical
Hunger Program (EHP), a food
bank in East Palo Alto. The event
brought food vendors from Palo

buy food and watch student groups
perform. Corporate sponsors cov

The vendors donated the food to
support the cause as well as to gain
more exposure in the Stanford com

the campus and students," said Lucy
Montoya, marketing manager at

dors. "They support us so much
throughout the school year, so it's
great to be able to support them and
