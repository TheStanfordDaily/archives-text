## TASTE EST Festival brings Palo Alto restaurants and student performance groups to White Plaza 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Fried plantains, an indie
band's lead singer croon
ing unintelligible syllables
into a microphone and a
group of friends dipping
their feet into a fountain evoke a
carefree vacation in a world beyond
the Stanford campus but the
band, The Sea People, is made up of
students, and the fountain is the
Claw. In fact, the only exotic part of
the scene is those plantains, cour
tesy of Coconuts, a Caribbean
restaurant in Palo Alto.
On Saturday afternoon, White
Plaza was home to "A Taste of Palo
Alto," an annual food festival or
ganized by fraternity Phi Kappa Psi
and sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi

(AEPhi) to benefit the Ecumenical
Hunger Program (EHP), a food
bank in East Palo Alto. The event
brought food vendors from Palo
Alto to campus, so attendees could
buy food and watch student groups
perform. Corporate sponsors cov
ered the event's costs, and all pro
ceeds went to EHP.
The vendors donated the food to
support the cause as well as to gain
more exposure in the Stanford com
munity.
"We like to support the commu
nity and local events, especially with
the campus and students," said Lucy
Montoya, marketing manager at
The Counter, one of the food ven
dors. "They support us so much
throughout the school year, so it's
great to be able to support them and

the cause [EHP]."
At noon, nine vendors opened
their stalls, selling Thai food, sushi,
cider, frozen yogurt, cake, Jamaican
jerk chicken and chili, among other
options. Student groups, including a
cappella group Mixed Company,
belly dance group Arabesque and
juggling group Down with Gravity,
took the makeshift stage over the
course of the next four hours to en
tertain the meandering crowd.
"The event works to promote
community in three ways," said co
director Arty Rivera 'll. "First, to
support a local charity, such as EHP.
Second, to promote local small
businesses ... and third, to provide
a venue for student groups to per
form."
Last year, the event raised
$3,600, a number this year's organ
izers sought to beat. Although there
was only one more food stall this
year, turnout was significantly high
er, according to Rivera. He credited
the turnout to more aggressive
marketing and a change in layout.
"We chose to put seating around
White Plaza, so people can sit down
and linger, and let the crowd build
up," he said.
Students and families wandered
around from stall to stall, sampling
foods, tie-dying shirts or spinning
the wheel at Stanford Federal
Credit Union's (SFCU) stall to win

SFCU gear.
"There's a great cause, good
people, good music and long lines,
which indicate popularity," said
Praveen Bommannavar, a third
year graduate student in Manage
ment Science and Engineering
(MS&E).
The popularity of the event sur
passed organizer expectations.
Only halfway through the event,
The Counter's chili stall was the
only vendor left standing. Thai ven
dor Siam Orchid fully restocked its
dishes earlier but still was unable to
keep up with demand. Latecomers
grumbled about the lack of food,
but the organizers reached their
goal of surpassing last year's total
early on.
"I'm happy that people are
sticking around because they're
having genuine fun," Rivera said,
noting "getting more food" as a
goal for next year's festival.
"The event gets people who
aren't necessarily aware of all the
tastes available right by the campus
to experience new foods and lets
restaurants get their name out," he
added.
Indeed, festival-goers, particu
larly the ones who came early
enough to get food, enjoyed the va
riety, camaraderie and sunshine.
"We get to be outside, there's
music and you get to hang out with
your friends," said Sarah Itani 'l2, a
member of AEPhi. "It's one of my
favorite events at Stanford."
