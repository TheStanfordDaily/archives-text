## WHAT'S SHAKIN,' BACON? Dan McCabe, chief development officer of Network for Good, speaks on Kevin Bacons SixDegrees.org 
### SUZANNE STATHAIOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Footloose, Apollo 13 and Animal House star Kevin Bacon
is making an appearance at Stanford tomorrow to talk
about "Social Networking for Social Good" at 5:30 p.m. in
Paul Brest Hall, alongside Graduate School of Business
professor Jennifer Aaker, who has researched how social
media can be an amplifying force for social good. Bacon's charita
ble social media website, SixDegrees.org, is linked with Network for
Good, a website that enables one to donate, volunteer and
fundraise for charities and nonprofits. The Stanford One Degree
challenge is SixDegrees.org's initiative to look for the "next big
idea" that will connect people to advance charitable causes.
The Stanford Daily spoke with Network for Good's Chief De
velopment Officer Dan McCabe about his work with Kevin Bacon,
the Six Degrees site and the One Degree challenge.
How did Bacon come up with the name SixDegrees.org? What is
its significance?
Bacon became known for the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game.
This went on for a while. In some cases, he didn't want to be known
just because of all the people he's been in movies with, but it became
excessively popular, so he figured he had to do something good with
this. He ended up registering SixDegrees.org.
How is his website a social networking website for charity?
There are these things called Charity Badges, which are visual bill
boards for favorite causes. You go to the site, go to your profile, pick
your charity badge and write a brief story about why you're so pas
sionate about this badge. It's great for people getting involved in
fundraising.This year, he wanted to go to college campuses because
students know the latest and greatest of social media.

As an actor, it seems interesting that
Kevin Bacon should be involved in
technology and social networking.
What does Bacon know specifically
about social media?

Kevin would be the first to say that he
isn't an expert in social media. How
ever, he realizes that as a celebrity, he
can attract attention and do some
thing good with it. Bacon called us
[Network for Good] and came up
with his site. The site is managed by
Network for Good, but Kevin is di
rectly involved.

Why did Bacon and Network for
Good challenge Stanford to come up
with charitable ideas?

There was a collaborative brainstorm
to do a challenge. We wanted to come
up with a new idea for Six Degrees. He
figured college students would have a
great idea. I have a colleague at the
Haas center who has told me all the
things you were doing. We got into a
conversation about expanding the

definition of public service. A few
months later, I called him and talked
to him about this idea.

Did Bacon and Professor Jennifer
Aaker know each other before set
ting up this event?

Jen's theories and mantra of the "but
terfly effect" line up almost perfectly
with Kevin's philosophy of small
groups of people creating ripple af
fects. They've never met before, and I
don't think he's intimately familiar
with her work, but I think there'll be
some pretty cool sparks on stage.

How will Kevin and Network for Good
work with the winners of the challenge?

Kevin will meet the finalists and the
winner personally. With the winner,
he'll have a lot of conversations to re
fine ideas. AOL has joined this too, and
if students want to make something
more than an idea, AOL has offered
the winner office space for six months.
By the end of the year, we hope to
launch either a campaign or tool for
Six Degrees, and we'll recognize the
student who came up with the idea.
