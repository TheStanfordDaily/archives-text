### SUZANNE STATHAIOS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Footloose, Apollo 13 and Animal House star Kevin Bacon
is making an appearance at Stanford tomorrow to talk
about "Social Networking for Social Good" at 5:30 p.m. in
Paul Brest Hall, alongside Graduate School of Business
professor Jennifer Aaker, who has researched how social
media can be an amplifying force for social good. Bacon's charita
ble social media website, SixDegrees.org, is linked with Network for
Good, a website that enables one to donate, volunteer and
fundraise for charities and nonprofits. The Stanford One Degree
challenge is SixDegrees.org's initiative to look for the "next big
idea" that will connect people to advance charitable causes.
The Stanford Daily spoke with Network for Good's Chief De
velopment Officer Dan McCabe about his work with Kevin Bacon,
the Six Degrees site and the One Degree challenge.
How did Bacon come up with the name SixDegrees.org? What is
its significance?
Bacon became known for the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game.
This went on for a while. In some cases, he didn't want to be known
just because of all the people he's been in movies with, but it became
excessively popular, so he figured he had to do something good with
this. He ended up registering SixDegrees.org.
How is his website a social networking website for charity?
There are these things called Charity Badges, which are visual bill
boards for favorite causes. You go to the site, go to your profile, pick
your charity badge and write a brief story about why you're so pas
sionate about this badge. It's great for people getting involved in
fundraising.This year, he wanted to go to college campuses because
students know the latest and greatest of social media.
