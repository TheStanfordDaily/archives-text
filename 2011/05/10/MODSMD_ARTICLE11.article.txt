# SPRINGTERNSHIPS
## Stanford students get a head start doing part-time interships during spring quarter 
### YIBAI SHU 
The rush to secure summer
internships as the school
year winds down is a famil
iar feeling for many Stan
ford students. However,
some students' voyages into the profes
sional world begin even before classes
end, with part-time internships during
spring quarter.
Edward Zhu 'l3 is one of these early
starters. About a month ago, he began a
part-time internship with Morgan Stan
ley Smith Barney in San Francisco. Zhu
works at least two full days at the firm
each week. For a stipend, he helps man
agers analyze portfolio returns and con
sider alternatives to investments in the
wealth management section of the com
pany.
Zhu stumbled upon the internship

in his search for summer work. He de
scribed how, as a sophomore, he had set
himself "high standards" and did not
have much success getting offers from
big investment firms like Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
After initiating contact with a num
ber of alumni who worked in finance, an
alumnus who works at Morgan Stanley
responded to Zhu with an opportunity
to work in the spring.
" [Being a part-time intern] would be
a really good experience for me, and I'm
going to do my best to see if I could
work around my schedule, because I
don't want to pass it up," Zhu said.
For Zhu, the work experience is an
opportunity to explore the finance in
dustry, his desired career path. The in
ternship, for him, is away to learn "on
the fly," as his supervisors generally ex
pect him to perform a good deal of

problem solving on his own.
The biggest difference between a
spring and summer internship, howev
er, is not the delegated responsibility,
but the balance of coursework and
company work. Zhu is taking three
major classes this quarter, but considers
his two-day-per-week internship a good
fit for his schedule, though he has occa
sionally skipped lectures in order to
meet his employer's expectation that he
be present for the duration of his work
days.
Indeed, Zhu's experience is not un
common. Many of his finance-oriented
friends have done similar part-time in
ternships in the past or, like Zhu, during
the present quarter.
Certain student groups also offer
opportunities to get started in the pro
fessional world while attending classes.
Stanford Women in Business (SWIB)
has been running a program referred to
as the "springternship" for five years.
"A lot of the students don't really get
business experience in their academic
coursework,"' said Rebecca Johnson 'll,
SWIB co-president. "I think the
springternship is a conceivable way to
give students hands-on practical educa
tional experiences outside to compli
ment what they're learning in the class
room."
Johnson herself did a part-time in
ternship with the technology start-up
Cooliris during spring quarter of her
sophomore year. She worked on a mar
ket-research project related to user con
sumption in the Chinese market.
"It really helped me lay groundwork
for my later internships and other things
I did in the business," she said. "It con
vinces me that I should do everything I
[can] to help continue the program."
The springternship team offers op
portunities in business firms and non
profit organizations. They contact com
panies that may be interested in getting
Stanford interns and then collect re
sumes from student applicants. After a
brief pre-screening, all resumes are for

warded to the firms.
"This year, we have received
about 50 applications in total," said
Elise Thygesen 'l3, who directs the
springternship program. Approxi
mately 30 of those students will score
an internship, for which they also
earn academic credits. They work in
a variety of fields, including technol
ogy start-ups, medical device compa
nies, finance firms and fashion busi
nesses.
In addition to providing internship
opportunities, SWIB also offers work
shops that guide students on how to
cope with different work environ
ments. SWIB checks in with interns to

see if they have problems coordinat
ing study and work.
"We as an organization try to limit
to 10 or fewer hours a week," Johnson
said. "We really emphasize balancing
out work and study."
She noted that the students usually
worked on one specific project rather
than a number of small tasks, and for
that reason, seemed to cope well with
the program.
As summed up by Johnson, "The
springternship... [helps students] fig
ure out what they are passionate
about, what they think would lead to a
long-term career and to really give
them the opportunity to delve into
those opportunities in the real world
in addition to their classroom experi
ences."
