## I HAVE TWO HEADS Internet (Dis)connection 
### Rachel Kolb 
A week ago, I had an experience
that raised fresh questions for
me about the digitally inter
connected nature of the Stanford
campus. One of my classes required
some collaboration for a group proj
ect, and the night before an assign
ment was due, one of my peers pro
posed that we all meet to discuss lo
gistics but via Gchat, not in person.
Hold on, what ever happened to
conversing face-to-face? Feeling al
most as odd as if I were shuffling into
a room of strangers, I logged online
and joined the chat session. The dia
logue proceeded in a remarkably re
laxed manner for people who lacked
the benefit of formal introductions,
but as we were wrapping up, one of
the group members typed, "Wait, do
any of you know who each other is?
In real life, I mean?"

Cue the sudden awkwardness.
Two of us had at least met, but the
other two or three were complete
strangers. What was more, our class
was a large lecture, which made it un
likely that any of us would even rec
ognize each other should that
serendipitous chance arise. The mo
ment highlighted the peculiarity of
our interaction: even though we were
all Stanford students, our dialogue
had functioned on the same plane as
an anonymous Internet chat room.
My roommate laughed when I told
her about the incident: "How hard
can it be to meet up? You go to the
same school!"

Indeed we do, but we also go to a
school in which an intensely wired-in
culture is taken for granted. Call it the
flip side of being in the heart of Silicon
Valley, but at Stanford, it can become
all too easy to forget where the line
lies between knowing each other au
thentically, in person, and knowing
each other only via a network. After
all, I go through each day plugged into
my iPhone, laptop, Facebook, both
my blog and those of other people
and various email accounts â€”as I
know is true for almost all of my
friends. I, like the majority of us, live in
a fast-paced technological hub in
which I know other people by their
digital selves and am busily produc
ing the kind of digital persona that I
myself would like to project.
When I step away from Stanford,
much of this digital preoccupation
falls away. Maybe it's the simple fact
of leaving the Bay Area air behind,
but I check my smartphone and email
less. I am online less often. And, most
strikingly of all, I never fail to be
amazed by how wonderful it is to see
longtime friends in person, instead of
the texting, instant messaging and
Skype interactions that characterize
our long-distance relationships. Yet,
in the rhythm of campus life, I suspect
that this truth is often lost on me and
my Stanford peers. We can often fail

to take advantage of the opportuni
ties for real interaction that lie all
around us.
This strikes me as contrary to one
of the selling points that Stanford
claims: the opportunity to meet, con
verse and network with other brilliant
students and faculty. The best part of
Stanford, they say, is the people
with which I've come to wholeheart
edly agree. I still recall one high
school college advisor, who himself
had gone to Stanford, telling me that
his best memories from his under
graduate years involved late nights in
the hallways discussing overarching
life questions with his friends. Now, in
the 21st century, I've had many in
tense Stanford conversations of my
own so how strange is it that a fair
number of them, like my recent group
project collaboration, have taken
place online rather than face-to-face?
Because logging on to a network
makes it easier to instantly access the
people we want to talk to. Ever since
my freshman year, when many of my
friends were concentrated in the
same dorm, the people I know at
Stanford have become more physi
cally dispersed, and in many cases,
technology is what ends up bridging
the gap. Dropping a quick email or
text can maintain the illusion of being
in constant conversation. Plus, high
tech communication solutions bring
the added bonus of being able to cre
ate and project the exact voice that
we want to exhibit which gives our
generation a skewed sense of possess
ing the freedom to be whoever we
want to be. Doesn't this, in itself, fit
right into the self-inventing mindset
of being a Stanford student?
In away, it's reassuring that the
wired-in nature of our campus allows
us to stay in touch despite busy sched
ules, but I wonder about the extent to
which we're allowing digital inter
change to become a substitute for real
life interaction. I have friends with
whom I can recognize an entirely dif
ferent dynamic functioning when we
talk via text message and when we talk
in person. Feeling this gap can be sur
prising, if not downright unsettling. For
Pete's sake, we do go to the same
school and unplugging ourselves, if
only to take a walk across campus, can
be a bigger boon to a relationship than
we might think.
