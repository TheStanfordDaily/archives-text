# FRESHLY BAKED
## Where Is Our Spring Fling? 
### Tim Moon 
Where do you go to school?"
"Mm, Stanford?" "Stanford!
Damn, look at you, going to
an Ivy."
I've run into these sort of ex
changes many a time, when people
who've vaguely heard of Stanford's
reputation assume that it's an Ivy
League school, and every time, I just
sort of smile and nod along. Unless it
was said by a friend who's just left
themselves open for a good ball-bust
ing, I tend not to go out of my way to
correct the mistake, since a) I've al
ways thought correcting a minor mis
take like that to be sort of douchey and
b) given the Ivies' reps, it's not like it's
an insult to be lumped in with them.

Whenever I think about Stanford
and the Ivies though, I'm pleased with
the characterization of Stanford as an
"Ivy League school that's not an Ivy
League school," and we've got a whole
lot of things going for us here that
aren't over there. We've got a Division
-1 sports program that has won sixteen
straight Director's Cups and has seen
Final Four basketball teams (both
men and women) and a top-five foot
ball team in the past decade. We get to
sunbathe in February while our East
Coast friends are freezing and slogging
through a foot of snow. We have Ike's.
However, there's something our
East Coast friends do that is a definite
source of envy, and it always happens
around this time of year. No, it's not
that they get out of school now (al
though that did always used to make
me jealous), but it is related.
Slope Day. Lawnparties. Spring
Fling. Any of these sound familiar?
These massive, all-campus tradi
tions celebrate the end of the school
year. There are concerts with big

names Cornell's Slope Day had
Nelly, Princeton brought in Wiz
Khalifa for their Lawnparties, Yale
had Lupe Fiasco for their Spring
Fling, Penn had Lupe Fiasco for their
Spring Fling (not a typo, Yale and
Penn both call their celebrations
Spring Fling and they both brought
in Lupe Fiasco this year must've
been confusing for Lupe). There is
fun in the sun. There are freely flow
ing EANABs and uh ... non-EAN
ABs.

Sounds pretty awesome, right? An
opportunity for the whole campus to
come out and celebrate the end of the
year, to see all your friends before part
ing ways for the summer (or forever),
to quench your thirst from a day of
frolicking in the sun with an ice-cold
non-EANAB (or two).

All these other schools have these
big, school-sponsored celebrations,
but what do we have? The closest thing
might be Battle of the Classes, and al
though it's a step in the right direction,
especially now that it's been combined
with Spring Faire, no one's going to be
mistaking it any time soon for a Slope
Day (I'm also sure that there are a
bunch of people who just read that and
had no idea what/when Battle of the
Classes and Spring Faire are). Sure,
fraternities might throw a couple of
open parties and individual houses or
dorms might have a barbecue, and you

can always toast the end of the year
with your group of friends, but for the
most part, I've always felt like our
school year just sort of fizzles to an
end.

As weird as it might feel to want
to co-opt traditions from other
schools, a good idea is a good idea.
(And for people hesitant to follow
in the footsteps of those hoity-toity
Ivy Leaguers, just think of it as rip
ping off Georgetown's Georgetown
Day or Syracuse University's
Mayfest or any other of the many
spring celebrations out there.) And
we certainly do have our own
unique traditions to be proud of, like
Full Moon on the Quad and Mau
soleum Party, but I'm sure that peo
ple wouldn't picket against a bangin'
day of fun just because it's not one of
the traditions we already have.
Would there be obstacles? Sure,
throwing something as large in scope
as an all-campus event would raise is
sues of money, space, clearing things
with the right people, etc., but we've
seen various student groups and or
ganizations put together events like
Full Moon, Vision Earth and Snow
chella before, so it wouldn't be impos
sible. Those last two events could be a
model, with multiple student groups
working together to throw the end-of
the-year celebration that Stanford
should have.

Stanford's the best at so many
things, surely we can do at least as well
as those Ivies. Just as long as we don't
call it Spring Fling.

Tim knows you want to end the year
with a bang. Tell him what would make
a Stanford-style year-end celebration
would need at timmoon@stanford.edu.
