## Should I stay or should I go? 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
I'm not sure what it was, but
something got me thinking
about endings this weekend.
Maybe it was Jeremy Green's
decision to end his Stanford ca
reer and turn pro, or perhaps it was
Phil Jackson coaching his last NBA
game. Or maybe it was my own last
game as coach of Stanford's club base
ball team I don't know for certain,
but what I do know is that I realized
there are both good and bad ways to
hang 'em up.
Jeremy Green's departure from
Stanford was definitely not the best
way to go out. I don't want to dwell on
Green for too long my friend and
colleague Wyndam Makowsky did a
fine job of just that yesterday but I
have to say that Green's decision to
leave Stanford early for the NBA is a
rare one, to put it one way. That may
come across as pompous, but Stanford
players especially Stanford players
who won't be first-round picks and
likely won't be drafted at all don't
tend to leave school early.
Green leaves Stanford with more
questions than answers. There is a
cloud swirling above him and his aca
demic record. No one is quite sure
what his relationship with Johnny
Dawkins and the rest of the coaching
staff was like and frankly, he just
isn't a very big NBA prospect.
Unfortunately for Green, he will
not be remembered as a Stanford leg
end, even though he is one of Stan
ford's best players in the last few years.
Instead, he ends his Stanford career
without a trip to an NCAA Tourna
ment and leaves with fans scratching
their heads asking, "Why?"

Phil Jackson's last hurrah as an
NBA coach may be even more puz
zling than Green's decision. In all
probability, Jackson arguably the
greatest coach in professional sports
history (I see you, Scotty Bowman
and Red Auerbach) coached his
last game Sunday in Dallas, as his Lak
ers got pulverized by the Mavericks,
122-86.

Jackson, who spent his entire ca
reer winning with the Bulls and Lak
ers, put a team out on the court Sun
day that played like it didn't want to
be there and acted like a bunch of
middle schoolers after losing a game
of kickball. The Lakers got down
early, and the only fight they showed
in trying to get back in the game was to
throw cheap shots at the Mavericks
once the game was out of reach.
Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum
got themselves ejected for essentially
using Mavericks players as punching
bags meaning three Lakers play
ers, Ron Artest being the other, were
ejected or suspended in the series for
violent fouls.
Joe Posnanski of Sports Illustrat
ed, perhaps the best sportswriter
around, summed up Jackson's depar
ture pretty well in his column yester
day.
"We will want to say again (be-

cause it's apparently the thing to say)
that this shameful and abominable
exit should not diminish from Phil
Jackson's long and breathtaking ca
reer ... but it sure doesn't leave a
happy echo. No champion in memory
has gone out with such a lack of class.
No great team in memory had so little
respect for their coach that they sent
him off in such a disgraceful fashion,"
Posnanski wrote. And he is spot on.
What will we remember about
Phil Jackson a few years from now?
Of course we will remember the 11
NBA championships, the triangle of
fense, Jordan, O'Neal and Bryant
and not, I think, Sunday's classless dis
play. Still, that is no way for a legend to
end his career.
Not everyone in fact almost no

one can go out like John Elway or
David Robinson. If there is a good
way to retire, they found it. Both
Elway and Robinson went out as
champions, Elway of Super Bowl
XXXIII in 1999 and Robinson of the
2003 NBA Finals. Neither pulled a
Brett Favre and made his retirement
process a three-ring circus, nor did ei
ther let his skills diminish enough to
make him a forgettable member of a
memorable team. In fact, both were
productive members of their title
squads.
In sports, as in life, finding the right
time to say enough is enough can be a
difficult task. You can't always find
the fairytale that Robinson and
Elway did and sometimes legends
like Jackson leave us with a sour taste
in our mouths.

because he wasn't ready to leave The
Daily. Draw more Brett Favre paral
