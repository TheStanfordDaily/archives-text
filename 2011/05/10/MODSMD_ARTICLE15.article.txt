# CARD TAMES TIGERS
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
With its quota of late-inning
heroics filled for the week, the
Stanford baseball team won in tra
ditional fashion on Monday. The
No. 25 Cardinal scored early and
often and held Pacific to one run

over the final seven innings in an
11-5 victory.
Playing a rare midweek game
away from home, Stanford (26-16,
9-9 Pac-10) sustained its momen
tum following a weekend sweep
over visiting Washington and im
proved its winning streak to five
games.

On Saturday, Stanford had a
walk-off win against Washington
on a misplayed ground ball to sec

ond base with two outs and the
bases loaded. On Sunday, the Car
dinal, trailing 2-1 in the eighth in
ning, rallied for six runs to raise the
brooms in Sunken Diamond.
Monday's game versus Pacific
(15-28), postponed from March 23
due to rain, featured 16 runs, 26
hits, five errors and three Cardinal
home runs, but seemed oddly tame
compared to the weekend festivi
ties.
Freshman first baseman Brian
Ragira named the Pac-10 Play
er of the Week after hitting .571
with six RBIs last week once
again jump-started the Cardinal
offense. After senior catcher Zach
Jones led off the game with a single
and sophomore outfielder Tyler
Gaffney reached via error, Ragira
stepped to the plate and did exact
ly what the reigning Player of the
Week is supposed to do: launch a
three-run blast over the fence in
right center.
"Obviously I'm feeling pretty
good at the plate, but more than
anything, I'm not thinking too
much," Ragira said. "Just trying to
get the foot down a little earlier
and trusting the hands and letting
them work."
The lead would not last for long,
though. Starter A.J. Vanegas
worked out of a jam unscathed in
the first after allowing back-to
back singles, but could not escape
another tough spot in the second.
The freshman got two quick outs
but then ran into trouble, A double,
two singles, two walks and two
passed balls later, Pacific led 4-3.
That would be the one opportu
nity Pacific would get.
Gaffney tied the game with a
solo shot to start the fourth, and the
brothers Diekroeger, Kenny and

Sophomore outfielder Tyler Gaffney helped propel Stanford's offense to an 11-5 road win over Pacific. Gaffney
reached base all five times he came to the plate and scored four runs as the Cardinal won its fifth straight game.
Danny, each added an RBI to give
Stanford a 6-4 lead.
From there, the Cardinal
bullpen took over. Head coach
Mark Marquess handed the ball to
junior Elliott Byers, who held the
Tigers to one run over two innings.
After that, it was all sophomore
Sahil Bloom.
Having played limited innings
this season, Bloom had his best out
ing of the season. The righthander
made sure Stanford would not need
any more last-minute magic. Bloom
tossed five shutout innings, scatter
ing three hits and one walk while
striking out five.
The Cardinal offense supported
Bloom, scoring five more runs over
the final six innings. In the fourth,
Jones doubled and came around to
score on a Gaffney single. Follow
ing a stolen base, sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty scored
Gaffney on a single to center.
"It definitely feels different
[playing with a lead], but I don't
think as a team we play any differ
ently," Ragira said. "In the begin
ning of the season, we were able to
score early in the game and hold on
to win, but now even when we get
the lead, we seem able to keep tack
ing on."
Stanford tacked on two more in

the sixth with the third home run of
the night this one by freshman
outfielder Austin Wilson and a
sacrifice fly by Ragira. Piscotty
capped the scoring in the eighth
with an RBI double that brought
home Gaffney.
The Cardinal will put its winning
streak on the line tonight when it
plays host to UC-Davis. The last
time the Aggies visited Sunken Di
amond, Stanford barely escaped
with a 3-2 victory.
First pitch is scheduled for 5:30
p.m.
