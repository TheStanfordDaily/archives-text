## THE 						SPORT YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 'l3 
I don't know if you caught it, but just a couple
of weeks ago, Stanford played host to what
might have been the game of the year, if only
I could remember which sport. And to get it
out of the way early no, Andrew Luck was
not playing, but someone named Evan Barry sure
put on a show. Maybe it would help to go over what
I do remember from that night...

For starters, the match was action-packed, partic
ularly on the defensive end, filled with amazing
back-and-forth rallies and featured clutch perform
ances from both of Stanford's repeat First Team All-
Americans in the sport. LSJUMB was there (I guess
that's not very helpful, as I've seen the Band making
an effort to get out to just about every sport this
spring), but even they weren't the rowdiest fans at
the game (now that ought to help).
By now you might be thinking one of several
things: one, why won't this stupid columnist get to his
obviously trivial point so I can go watch the Red Sox
beat up on the Blue Jays? Two, who does this kid
think he is, trying to make fun of me for not knowing
anything about what he is talking about? Or three,
how did I not know this awesome sport in which my
school was the defending national champion?
I assume that most of you are picking option two,
although number one might have some clout with all
you fellow members of RSNation. But I guess my
target audience is those in the last boat.
The match I was describing (and just recently re
membered in vivid detail) was the No. 4 men's
volleyball team's Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Tournament quarterfinal matchup against
No. 5 Long Beach State at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday, April 23.

I'll stop here and won't be offended if some of
you stop reading now because you think you don't
really care about or like men's volleyball. Tall men
running and jumping around in spandex just don't
do it for you, and that's okay, but I would like to
point out that the men's team actually doesn't wear
spandex.

For those of you still reading, thank you. And to
reward you, I'd like to hand out some statistics that
ought to make those who stopped reading a little
jealous. In that MPSF quarterfinal match, Stanford
and Long Beach State were tied a total of 42 times in
the five sets and 144 minutes it took to complete.
There were also a whopping 14 lead changes in the
222 total points won in the match.
Sixty-one points either saw a team take the lead,
tie the score or win the match. I don't know about
you, but for all the "parity" in major college and pro
fessional sports that brings in viewers and makes for
tight finishes, it's hard to get much closer than that.
You techies in the audience (all seven of you)
have already figured out that those 61 points ac
count for over 27 percent of the match. Congratula
tions, now put on some sunscreen and come out of
your room to enjoy the sunny weather you saw peo
ple talking about on Twitter (#reasonthree-
StanfordisbetterthanHarvard).

And on the subject of parity, let's talk about the
MPSF and men's volleyball. In the American Volley
ball Coaches Association's national rankings at the
end of the season, MPSF schools occupied seven of
the top eight spots. Ohio State finished in the top
spot by virtue of its victory in the NCAA title match.
but all-in-all, 11 of the top 15 volley
ball teams in the country play in the
MPSF. For reference, there are only
12 teams in MPSF men's volleyball.
Stanford plays in the Pac-10 in
most sports baseball, football
and basketball, to name a few
and just for fun, let's take a look at
how those sports stacked up nation
ally. There are 10 teams in the bas
ketball and football editions of the
Pac-10, and this year, there were
four nationally ranked teams at the
end of the season combined.
Pac-10 baseball has three ranked
teams in the top 25 right now, with
two more hovering on the edge.
So that's a grand total of seven
nationally ranked teams from three
different sports. Seven versus 11
I'm just an American studies major,
but it seems like one is bigger than
the other.
I understand you gridiron gurus
who are in a race to see who can spit
out your mouthpiece first and tell
me that the number of quality

teams across the country is way
greater in football. Let me assure
you, I know that there are 120 Divi
sion-I FBS football teams. I also
know there are 346 D-I basketball
teams and close to 300 baseball
teams.
I understand all of your cries just
as much as I don't understand Jere
my Green's decision to stay in the
upcoming NBA Draft. But all jokes
aside, my point here is not that
MPSF men's volleyball is far supe
rior to any other sport, but that it's
still one of the greatest shows on
turf... err, court.
The sport has some of the best
all-around athletes in the country,
simply given the fact that a volley
ball player must possess the raw
athleticism to jump very high, the
mental ability to think through a
complex set of strategies very
quickly and the hand-eye coordina
tion to hit a ball with power that is
impressive by anyone's standards.
Junior outside hitter Brad Law
son is one of the two aforemen
tioned repeat All-Americans (jun
ior libero Erik Shoji is the other),
and watching him spike a volleyball
is a spectacle I would encourage all
10 of you still reading to go and do
before it's too late. (As a side note,
hop on You Tube and watch him
sing an equally impressive version
of the national anthem. It might
move you more than you think.)
And when you have the chance
to watch a game with as much ac
tion as a good men's volleyball
match has, do it. Stanford had an
up-and-down year that included a
sweep of the No. 2 team in the coun
try but then never really got hot
after spring break and ran into a
Long Beach team that had the Car-

dinars number all season long (3-0
against the Card in 2011).
I don't want this column to be
one of those long tirades about fans
not coming out to a sport I think is
worthy; I don't think those are ef
fective or particularly interesting,
with apologies to my fellow colum
nists. I just think that you ought to
check out the MPSF and all it of
fers.
As the beat writer that went to
most of the team's home matches
this season, I got to see the fast
paced game that is rally-scoring vol
leyball. And it was a great experi
ence because Stanford played 23 of
its 28 matches against nationally
ranked opponents this year. As a
sports fan, I enjoy watching good
competition, and if the MPSF does
anything well, it's ensure tremen
dous competition.
And that's all Fm trying to tell
you here today. You may have lost
your shot at seeing the men's vol
leyball team compete this season,
but next year's squad has some seri
ous potential to bring the KA Kra
zies out in force in May and maybe
go after a second national title in
three years.

Miles Bennett-Smith, despite his
impressive collection of spandex,
will always have to enjoy MPSF
volleyball from the sidelines. Live
the dream and schedule a meet-up

I don't know if you caught it, but just a couple
of weeks ago, Stanford played host to what
might have been the game of the year, if only
I could remember which sport. And to get it
out of the way early no, Andrew Luck was
not playing, but someone named Evan Barry sure
put on a show. Maybe it would help to go over what
I do remember from that night...

For starters, the match was action-packed, partic
ularly on the defensive end, filled with amazing
back-and-forth rallies and featured clutch perform
ances from both of Stanford's repeat First Team All-
Americans in the sport. LSJUMB was there (I guess
that's not very helpful, as I've seen the Band making
an effort to get out to just about every sport this
spring), but even they weren't the rowdiest fans at
the game (now that ought to help).
By now you might be thinking one of several
things: one, why won't this stupid columnist get to his
obviously trivial point so I can go watch the Red Sox
beat up on the Blue Jays? Two, who does this kid
think he is, trying to make fun of me for not knowing
anything about what he is talking about? Or three,
how did I not know this awesome sport in which my
school was the defending national champion?
I assume that most of you are picking option two,
although number one might have some clout with all
you fellow members of RSNation. But I guess my
target audience is those in the last boat.
The match I was describing (and just recently re
membered in vivid detail) was the No. 4 men's
volleyball team's Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Tournament quarterfinal matchup against
No. 5 Long Beach State at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday, April 23.

I'll stop here and won't be offended if some of
you stop reading now because you think you don't
really care about or like men's volleyball. Tall men
running and jumping around in spandex just don't
do it for you, and that's okay, but I would like to
point out that the men's team actually doesn't wear
spandex.

For those of you still reading, thank you. And to
reward you, I'd like to hand out some statistics that
ought to make those who stopped reading a little
jealous. In that MPSF quarterfinal match, Stanford
and Long Beach State were tied a total of 42 times in
the five sets and 144 minutes it took to complete.
There were also a whopping 14 lead changes in the
222 total points won in the match.
Sixty-one points either saw a team take the lead,
tie the score or win the match. I don't know about
you, but for all the "parity" in major college and pro
fessional sports that brings in viewers and makes for
tight finishes, it's hard to get much closer than that.
You techies in the audience (all seven of you)
have already figured out that those 61 points ac
count for over 27 percent of the match. Congratula
tions, now put on some sunscreen and come out of
your room to enjoy the sunny weather you saw peo
ple talking about on Twitter (#reasonthree-
StanfordisbetterthanHarvard).

And on the subject of parity, let's talk about the
MPSF and men's volleyball. In the American Volley
ball Coaches Association's national rankings at the
end of the season, MPSF schools occupied seven of
the top eight spots. Ohio State finished in the top
spot by virtue of its victory in the NCAA title match.
but all-in-all, 11 of the top 15 volley
ball teams in the country play in the
MPSF. For reference, there are only
12 teams in MPSF men's volleyball.
Stanford plays in the Pac-10 in
most sports baseball, football
and basketball, to name a few
and just for fun, let's take a look at
how those sports stacked up nation
ally. There are 10 teams in the bas
ketball and football editions of the
Pac-10, and this year, there were
four nationally ranked teams at the
end of the season combined.
Pac-10 baseball has three ranked
teams in the top 25 right now, with
two more hovering on the edge.
So that's a grand total of seven
nationally ranked teams from three
different sports. Seven versus 11
I'm just an American studies major,
but it seems like one is bigger than
the other.
I understand you gridiron gurus
who are in a race to see who can spit
out your mouthpiece first and tell
me that the number of quality

teams across the country is way
greater in football. Let me assure
you, I know that there are 120 Divi
sion-I FBS football teams. I also
know there are 346 D-I basketball
teams and close to 300 baseball
teams.
I understand all of your cries just
as much as I don't understand Jere
my Green's decision to stay in the
upcoming NBA Draft. But all jokes
aside, my point here is not that
MPSF men's volleyball is far supe
rior to any other sport, but that it's
still one of the greatest shows on
turf... err, court.
The sport has some of the best
all-around athletes in the country,
simply given the fact that a volley
ball player must possess the raw
athleticism to jump very high, the
mental ability to think through a
complex set of strategies very
quickly and the hand-eye coordina
tion to hit a ball with power that is
impressive by anyone's standards.
Junior outside hitter Brad Law
son is one of the two aforemen
tioned repeat All-Americans (jun
ior libero Erik Shoji is the other),
and watching him spike a volleyball
is a spectacle I would encourage all
10 of you still reading to go and do
before it's too late. (As a side note,
hop on You Tube and watch him
sing an equally impressive version
of the national anthem. It might
move you more than you think.)
And when you have the chance
to watch a game with as much ac
tion as a good men's volleyball
match has, do it. Stanford had an
up-and-down year that included a
sweep of the No. 2 team in the coun
try but then never really got hot
after spring break and ran into a
Long Beach team that had the Car-

dinars number all season long (3-0
against the Card in 2011).
I don't want this column to be
one of those long tirades about fans
not coming out to a sport I think is
worthy; I don't think those are ef
fective or particularly interesting,
with apologies to my fellow colum
nists. I just think that you ought to
check out the MPSF and all it of
fers.
As the beat writer that went to
most of the team's home matches
this season, I got to see the fast
paced game that is rally-scoring vol
leyball. And it was a great experi
ence because Stanford played 23 of
its 28 matches against nationally
ranked opponents this year. As a
sports fan, I enjoy watching good
competition, and if the MPSF does
anything well, it's ensure tremen
dous competition.
And that's all Fm trying to tell
you here today. You may have lost
your shot at seeing the men's vol
leyball team compete this season,
but next year's squad has some seri
ous potential to bring the KA Kra
zies out in force in May and maybe
go after a second national title in
three years.

impressive collection of spandex,
