## THE
						SPORT YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH 'l3 
I don't know if you caught it, but just a couple
of weeks ago, Stanford played host to what
might have been the game of the year, if only
I could remember which sport. And to get it
out of the way early no, Andrew Luck was
not playing, but someone named Evan Barry sure
put on a show. Maybe it would help to go over what
I do remember from that night...

For starters, the match was action-packed, partic
ularly on the defensive end, filled with amazing
back-and-forth rallies and featured clutch perform
ances from both of Stanford's repeat First Team All-
Americans in the sport. LSJUMB was there (I guess
that's not very helpful, as I've seen the Band making
an effort to get out to just about every sport this
spring), but even they weren't the rowdiest fans at
the game (now that ought to help).
By now you might be thinking one of several
things: one, why won't this stupid columnist get to his
obviously trivial point so I can go watch the Red Sox
beat up on the Blue Jays? Two, who does this kid
think he is, trying to make fun of me for not knowing
anything about what he is talking about? Or three,
how did I not know this awesome sport in which my
school was the defending national champion?
I assume that most of you are picking option two,
although number one might have some clout with all
you fellow members of RSNation. But I guess my
target audience is those in the last boat.
The match I was describing (and just recently re
membered in vivid detail) was the No. 4 men's
volleyball team's Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation Tournament quarterfinal matchup against
No. 5 Long Beach State at Maples Pavilion on
Saturday, April 23.

I'll stop here and won't be offended if some of
you stop reading now because you think you don't
really care about or like men's volleyball. Tall men
running and jumping around in spandex just don't
do it for you, and that's okay, but I would like to
point out that the men's team actually doesn't wear
spandex.

For those of you still reading, thank you. And to
reward you, I'd like to hand out some statistics that
ought to make those who stopped reading a little
jealous. In that MPSF quarterfinal match, Stanford
and Long Beach State were tied a total of 42 times in
the five sets and 144 minutes it took to complete.
There were also a whopping 14 lead changes in the
222 total points won in the match.
Sixty-one points either saw a team take the lead,
tie the score or win the match. I don't know about
you, but for all the "parity" in major college and pro
fessional sports that brings in viewers and makes for
tight finishes, it's hard to get much closer than that.
You techies in the audience (all seven of you)
have already figured out that those 61 points ac
count for over 27 percent of the match. Congratula
tions, now put on some sunscreen and come out of
your room to enjoy the sunny weather you saw peo
ple talking about on Twitter (#reasonthree-
StanfordisbetterthanHarvard).

And on the subject of parity, let's talk about the
MPSF and men's volleyball. In the American Volley
ball Coaches Association's national rankings at the
end of the season, MPSF schools occupied seven of
the top eight spots. Ohio State finished in the top
spot by virtue of its victory in the NCAA title match.
