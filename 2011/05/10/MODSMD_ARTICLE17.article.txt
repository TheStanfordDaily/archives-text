## Stanford's Barnhart, Buehler named to U.S. World Cup squad 
### Nate Adams 
Assistant coach Nicole Barnhart
'O4 and Rachel Buehler 'O7 were
named to the United States soccer
team that will compete in the 2011
Women's World Cup in Germany
this June. Both former Stanford
stars are expected to play key roles
for the team, but another former
Cardinal player Kelley O'Hara
'lO was among the final cuts for
the national squad.
All three Stanford icons were
part of a 29-member camp that
ended on May 6, but U.S. head
coach Pia Sundhage cut that num
ber to 21 for this summer's final ros
ter.
Barnhart, now a volunteer
coach, set the Stanford record for
most shutouts (35) and goals
against average (0.45) during her
career as a goalkeeper from 2000-
04. She has the most international
experience of any recent Stanford
graduate and should compete with
the currently injured Hope Solo for
the starting spot this summer.
Buehler, a defender, played on
the Farm in 2003 and from 2005-07,
playing alongside Barnhart during
her rookie season. She has some in
ternational experience at the junior
level, twice competing in the U-19
Women's World Cup.
O'Hara, the winner of the Her
mann Trophy in 2009 as the best
player in the NCAA, was not se
lected despite being an active par
ticipant in the team's preparation
up to this point.
The U.S. drew into Group C of
the tournament with South Korea,
Colombia and Sweden. The Amer
ican squad will open against the
Koreans on June 28 at 8:45 a.m.
