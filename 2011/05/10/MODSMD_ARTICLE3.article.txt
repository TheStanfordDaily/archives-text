## 'Outsourced' actor speaks at Crothers 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Rizwan Manji, star of NBC's hit tele
vision series "Outsourced," spoke last
night at the Crothers Memorial Lounge
about "life, acting and what it is like to be
a South Asian Muslim in Hollywood."
The show follows the life of an Amer
ican call center manager whose job is
outsourced to Bombay, India. Manji
plays the manager's scheming assistant
manager, Rajeev. During his talk, actress
Aneesh Sheth, who guest stars in the last
two episodes of the season, joined him.
They began with a Q&A session with
Elahe Popat 'l3 and then responded to
questions from a largely South Asian au
dience.
Manji began by discussing his child
hood in Canada, his "horrendous ac

cent" and his decision to pursue acting
despite the fact that his parents pushed
him to pursue law.
"I think the first play I got a role in
was in junior high school," he said. "Once
you get a laugh, you're like, 'Oh my god,
I want to do this for the rest of my life.'"
Although his parents' support for his
career increased with time "My dad, I
think, has become my agent," Manji said
the political environment made it dif
ficult for him, a Muslim actor, to find
work.
Reflecting on this challenge, he said,
"2001 was also the time when 9/11 hap
pened, and suddenly jobs for people that
looked like me sort of stalled a bit."
After numerous TV roles, he landed a
part on "24" in 2010, when he made the
decision to portray a terrorist in spite of
his previous aversion to those roles.

"The only problem I had for the
longest time was playing terrorist roles,"
he said. "For me personally, being Mus
lim, I felt like I did not want to perpetu
ate that stereotype."
When he was offered that role, how
ever, he came to a realization.
"In order to show the good part, you
also have to show the other part," he
said. "That could have been my rational
ization because 1 needed money ... At
that time, I felt okay doing that."
Regardless of the "doctor" and "cab
driver" stereotypes that Manji men
tioned, he concluded that being South
Asian in Hollywood has actually been
beneficial.
"1 have always felt, a hundred per
cent, that being Indian has helped me in
this career," he said. "Especially
because when I walk in the room, I
look different... that's something
that I'm going to bring to it, no mat
ter how horrible my audition is."
"When there is a role for a Cau
casian actor, you have so many
choices," he added. "But when
you're auditioning for a part that's
specifically written for an Indian,
there are less."
Furthermore, his role on "24"
was received positively by his own
Muslim community.
"It was funny because at my
mosque, everything else I did peo
ple didn't care about, but this was
'You were on "24" and you acted
with Anil Kapoor that's so ex

citing!'"
Manji began acting on "Out
sourced" in 2010, when he decided
to audition after "laughing out
loud" while reading the script. The
producers originally auditioned
him as the workplace clown
Gupta.
He jokingly described the audi
tion as a"South Asian Student As
sociation meeting." Manji got the
part of Rajeev after all of the orig
inal candidates were eliminated in
favor of his portrayal.
Sheth, on the other hand, spoke
about being the only South Asian
transgender actress on television.
"I got a lot of criticism from the
transgender community because I
was a stripper on the show, and
they thought I was negatively rein
forcing stereotypes," Sheth said.
"One of my teachers in acting
school said, 'lf you're getting
stereotyped, at least you're work
ing.'"
"You have to start with some
thing," she added. "I never thought
I could be a transgender actress."
Sheth also has a background in
social work and mentioned a pas
sion for working with LGBT
youth and a desire to mix televi
sion with activism. She mentioned
that she even fought for transgen
der visibility at her "Outsourced"
audition.
She described the role as "a
great opportunity" for transgen
der people to gain visibility.
"I would love to one day be that
one transgender actress who
books a role as a genetic woman,"
Sheth said.
Sanskriti, a South Asian cam
pus organization, hosted the event.

to audition after "laughing out
loud" while reading the script. The
producers originally auditioned
him as the workplace clown
Gupta.
He jokingly described the audi
tion as a"South Asian Student As
sociation meeting." Manji got the
part of Rajeev after all of the orig
inal candidates were eliminated in
favor of his portrayal.
Sheth, on the other hand, spoke
about being the only South Asian
transgender actress on television.
"I got a lot of criticism from the
transgender community because I
was a stripper on the show, and
they thought I was negatively rein
forcing stereotypes," Sheth said.
"One of my teachers in acting
school said, 'lf you're getting
stereotyped, at least you're work
ing.'"
"You have to start with some
thing," she added. "I never thought
I could be a transgender actress."
Sheth also has a background in
social work and mentioned a pas
sion for working with LGBT
youth and a desire to mix televi
sion with activism. She mentioned
that she even fought for transgen
der visibility at her "Outsourced"
audition.
She described the role as "a
great opportunity" for transgen
der people to gain visibility.
"I would love to one day be that
one transgender actress who
books a role as a genetic woman,"
Sheth said.
Sanskriti, a South Asian cam
pus organization, hosted the event.
