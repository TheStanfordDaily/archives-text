## 'Outsourced' actor speaks at Crothers 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Rizwan Manji, star of NBC's hit tele
vision series "Outsourced," spoke last
night at the Crothers Memorial Lounge
about "life, acting and what it is like to be
a South Asian Muslim in Hollywood."
The show follows the life of an Amer
ican call center manager whose job is
outsourced to Bombay, India. Manji
plays the manager's scheming assistant
manager, Rajeev. During his talk, actress
Aneesh Sheth, who guest stars in the last
two episodes of the season, joined him.
They began with a Q&A session with
Elahe Popat 'l3 and then responded to
questions from a largely South Asian au

looked like me sort of stalled a bit."
After numerous TV roles, he landed a
part on "24" in 2010, when he made the
decision to portray a terrorist in spite of
his previous aversion to those roles.

"The only problem I had for the
longest time was playing terrorist roles,"
he said. "For me personally, being Mus
lim, I felt like I did not want to perpetu
ate that stereotype."
When he was offered that role, how
ever, he came to a realization.
"In order to show the good part, you
also have to show the other part," he
said. "That could have been my rational
ization because 1 needed money ... At
that time, I felt okay doing that."
Regardless of the "doctor" and "cab
driver" stereotypes that Manji men
tioned, he concluded that being South
Asian in Hollywood has actually been
beneficial.
"1 have always felt, a hundred per
cent, that being Indian has helped me in
