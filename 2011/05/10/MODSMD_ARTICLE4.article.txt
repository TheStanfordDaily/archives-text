## School board votes on calendar today 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”An Le Nguyen 
The Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD) Board of Educa
tion will vote today on a proposed
change to the district calendar. If ap
proved, the measure would kick off
the 2012-13 academic year Aug. 16,
12 days in advance of the current
Aug. 28 start date.
In recent months, school officials
have called for a reform of the school
calendar; their main push is to wrap
up the first semester before winter
break. The early start proposal goes
hand in hand with a Dec. 21 semester
end date, rather than the current Jan.
24 end date. The school year would
conclude May 30 under the proposal.
The debate over calendar
changes has sparked numerous dis
cussions in the local community.
School of Education senior lecturer
Denise Clark Pope is among the pro
ponents of the change.
Pope, co-founder of Challenge
Success, argued that a student's
schedule has a significant impact on
stress levels. Daily school hours and
the number of breaks count more
than people think, according to
Pope.
Though the course of the past
months, the PAUSD staff solicited
feedback on the calendar reform
from various entities. In addition to
meeting with high school depart
ments, the district also issued a sur
vey to its teachers, parents and stu
dents.
According to the current propos
al report, some "2,700 parents, 430
high school students, 165 high school
staff and 310 elementary/middle
school staff completed a survey."
"The responses show that there
was support among all parties for the
notion of finals before winter break,
with the strongest support coming
from the high schools," the report
said.

The majority opinion on finals did
not translate, however, to a consensus
on the calendar debate.

"Although there were strong pref

erences for when finals should occur,
the same level agreement did not
exist when it came to when the school
year should start which is directly
related to the length of the first se
mester if the semester is to conclude
before winter break," the report said.
Survey respondents cited curricu
lum challenges, conflicts with family
activities and conflicts with college
application deadlines as potential ob
stacles to the proposed change.
The public session of today's
meeting will commence at 6:30 p.m.
in the boardroom of the Palo Alto
Unified School District administra
tive building.
