## New mass spec sorts cells by type 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The mass spectrometer, a machine previ
ously used to detect metal contamination in
circuits and minerals, can be used to exam
ine the identity and behaviors of individual
cells, Stanford researchers demonstrate in
this week's Science magazine.
The ability of the new procedure to iden
tify more characteristics of each cell at once

comes as a major
breakthrough to immunologists, stem cell
researchers and cancer scientists alike.
"Suddenly we go from seeing 10-15 pa
rameters up to 30-100," said Garry Nolan,
professor of microbiology and immunology,
whose lab did the research on this project.
He described this development as "a
quantum leap" that allows scientists to
