## New mass spec sorts cells by type 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The mass spectrometer, a machine previ
ously used to detect metal contamination in
circuits and minerals, can be used to exam
ine the identity and behaviors of individual
cells, Stanford researchers demonstrate in
this week's Science magazine.
The ability of the new procedure to iden
tify more characteristics of each cell at once

comes as a major
breakthrough to immunologists, stem cell
researchers and cancer scientists alike.
"Suddenly we go from seeing 10-15 pa
rameters up to 30-100," said Garry Nolan,
professor of microbiology and immunology,
whose lab did the research on this project.
He described this development as "a
quantum leap" that allows scientists to

"look more deeply into normal and
abnormal immune cell development
and cancers."

According to Erin Simonds, a doc
toral researcher in Nolan's lab work
ing on leukemia research, the lab has
used this technology to examine dif
ferences between cancer cells and nor
mal cells to better understand the dis
ease process. Scientists can also use the
mass spectrometer to better identify
individual cancers and might one day
be able to personalize cancer drug
therapies.
"It gives cancer researchers a much
broader perspective... it allows you
to look at the entire cancer in one shot
and look at the way that cancer is quite
heterogeneous," he said. "Once you
find the parameters that help define a
person's cancer or get a fingerprint of
that person's cancer, then you can tai
lor therapy to treat that person's can
cer more effectively."
Sean Bendall, a postdoctoral schol
ar and fellow first author of the study,
explained that the machine would
help speed up the scientific process

and hopefully lead to therapies. Fie
saw it being used to screen the effec
tiveness of drugs on multiple types of
cells to help determine side effects. It
could also be utilized to differentiate
stem cell lines and help further that
field of research.

"Being able to ask more questions
all at once leads to more answers, and it
just makes things move faster," he said.
Researchers at the University of
Toronto developed the mass spec
trometer itself and had the idea of ap
plying it to single cell analysis.They en
listed Nolan as an expert in single cell
biology to apply previous biological
analysis tools to the machine in an ef
fort to facilitate the machine's transi
tion to the biology lab.

Nolan and the Toronto researchers
based the technique on the traditional
Fluorescence Activated Cytometry
System (FACS) developed by
Leonard Herzenberg at Stanford in
the 19705. Nolan pursued his doctoral
work in the Herzenberg lab in the
1980s.The FACS can test up to 10 or 12
cell parameters at once by attaching
antibodies to the cell labeled with or
ganic fluorescent molecules. It then
reads the cells by capturing the emit
ted light frequencies from the fluores
cents as the cells pass through an acti
vating laser.
The mass spectrometer labels mol

ecules in the cell with rare earth ele
ments from the bottom of the period
ic table, which are attached to antibod
ies instead of organic fluorescents.The
signals from these elements are more
easily differentiated than wavelengths
of different colors.

"When you look at a rainbow, the
colors aren't totally separate. One
color blends into the next... and so
with anything that uses light-based de
tection, there are only so many colors
or dyes you can use before everything
blends together and you can't meas
ure things anymore," Bendall said.
Mass spectrometry allows for high
er resolution measurement because
different elements have distinct mass
es and, unlike light, these signals do
not blend.

The single cells labeled with differ
ent metals are then heated to vapor
ization and the machine reads the ions
of any elements bound by antibodies
to the cell.The resulting readings allow
scientists to determine which of the
multiple parameters a given cell ex
hibits, giving a clear picture of that
cell's identity.
The machine is commercially
available and is being adopted by labs
around the world.
