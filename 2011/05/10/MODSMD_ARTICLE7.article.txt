# Wu mulls future of Internet
## Talk looks at Web monopolies 
### SARAH FLAMM 
Net neutrality theorist Tim Wu spoke
Monday afternoon at a talk hosted by the
Center for Internet and Society. He dis
cussed the threat of the Internet being run
by one giant corporation, as has been the
case with other information industries in
the course of American history.
Wu is currently on leave from his pro
fessorship at Columbia Law School to
serve as a senior advisor at the Federal

Trade Commission in Washington, D.C. In his lecture, held at
the Law School, he explored a topic presented in his book,
"The Master Switch."
"Is the problem of the recurring monopoly destined to be
the fate of the Internet as well?" Wu asked the audience of
students, Silicon Valley software engineers and professors.
Wu also pondered whether the Internet could be ruled by
one "corporate leviathan" in possession of the master switch.
To address these questions, he drew from the history of
the radio, telephone, television and film industries and a the
ory of a three-phase cycle that repeats itself across industries.
According to this theory, a disruptive invention improves
and replaces existing technologies approximately every 20
years. Next, there is period of openness characterized by
wide experimentation with the new technology's capabilities
and limitations. Finally, there is the consolidation phase, in
which key players force out competition and monopolize the
industry.
"We can learn so much from looking back at the way in
dustries have consolidated over time," said law school lectur
er Anthony Falzone, executive director of the Fair Use Pro
ject. "We have the same concerns in the present with how
things were in the past."
Wu said the Internet has gone through the first phase of
invention, and is now either in the second phase of open ex
perimentation or the beginning of the third phase of consol
idation. He cited Facebook, Google and Twitter as possible
examples of consolidation.
One problem with consolidation and monopolies, Wu
noted, is that the industry gets stuck in a state of lack of inno
vation.
"You want companies to be overtaken if something bet
ter arises," he said.
He referred to the case of Hosni Mubarak, the recently
ousted president of Egypt, saying that if a company gains too
much power, it may become erratic and abusive,
"You want them to be a little insecure so that the compa
ny is always cautious," he said.
If barriers to entry are too high, better services and prod
ucts cannot emerge.
First year law school student Christian Geib, who attend
ed the talk, thought this was already a problem.
"To get any traction on a new project you must go
through a big, established company like Google or Face
book," he said.
