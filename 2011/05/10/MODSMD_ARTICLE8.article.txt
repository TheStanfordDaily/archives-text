## Class of 2011 aims to break all-time Senior Gift record 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
With one month left before graduation, the class of
2011 has reached a 10-year record of participation in Se
nior Gift donations and is on track to beat Stanford's all
time participation record. The Senior Gift is a student
driven initiative intended to raise money to fund finan
cial aid and other undergraduate programs.
Currently, the campaign counts nearly 60 percent par
ticipation and aims to break the all-time record of 78
percent.
"This is exceptional progress ... It's difficult to do
anything new or unprecedented at Stanford, and this is a
way that Stanford's class of 2011 can leave as a record
breaking class," wrote Alii Brian, assistant director of
student and young alumni development, in an email to
The Daily.
"Participating in Senior Gift is away for seniors to
send a message that Stanford was an important time in
their lives and an opportunity to leave something behind
as they get ready to leave," Brian said in an interview.
Because the campaign aims to reach maximum par
ticipation, there is no minimum donation required. This
year's campaign is asking seniors do
nate $20.11, an amount intended to
commemorate their graduation
year. The money raised will be
matched by donations from Peter
Bing '55 and the Atwell Match, a
program that matches donations
from recent graduates and current
students. The Parents' Advisory
Board also pledged to donate $5,000
for every 10 percent of student par
ticipation.
More than 75 percent of the

money raised will be spent on need
based financial aid for undergradu
ate students, while the remaining
funds will finance programs such as
Sophomore College and undergrad
uate research.

Historically, Stanford has lagged
behind peer institutions such as Har
vard, Princeton and Yale, where sen
ior gift participation rates range
from 80 to 99 percent. In recent
years, however, the University has
seen resurgence in Senior Gift par
ticipation.

"Stanford once had a very strong
Senior Gift program, culminating
with the class of 2000, who set the all
time record of 78 percent class partic
ipation," Brian said. "In the years

after, senior participation fell dramat
ically ... but recently, classes have re
engaged with this campaign."
In the remaining weeks before
graduation, the 80-student team will
continue to host a number of events
to raise awareness about the cam
paign, including a free wine tasting
planned for this Friday.
"Our team this year is confident
that Stanford seniors have valued
and appreciated their Stanford expe
rience just as much, if not more, than
seniors at other universities, and one
way to show this is through Senior
Gift participation," Brian said.
