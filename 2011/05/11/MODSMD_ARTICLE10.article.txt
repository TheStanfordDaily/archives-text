## OP-EDS It Gets Better 
### VINEET SINGAL '12 
Last week, I saw a You Tube
video that I have not been
able to stop thinking about.
The video, titled "It Gets Better,"
is Google's attempt to highlight the
"It Gets Better Project" spearhead
ed by media pundit and author Dan
Savage. The project started when
Dan and his spouse, Terry, posted a
video in response to the recent rise
in suicides among gay American
teenagers. They talked about how
they were both heavily bullied in
high school but had an incredible
time in college and after, found each
other, fell in love and even adopted
a son and started a family.
The message was simple: being
bullied for being gay in high school
sucks, but stick it out, because it gets
better.
Dan and Terry spread the video
to their personal networks, and
soon, this grassroots effort became
the "It Gets Better Project," with
thousands of other individuals and
couples, including celebrities like
Adam Lambert, Kathy Griffin and
Lady Gaga candidly sharing their
own personal stories with the same
essential central message. Even
President Obama took the opportu
nity to offer his sympathies for the
families of those affected by the sui
cides and to offer advice to LGBT
high school students nationwide suf
fering from bullying.
As I watched the video, I was re
minded of my time attending middle
school in New Zealand. Every single
day, a group of older boys would tell
me to go back to my country and
make offensive remarks about my
ethnicity. Add to that the fact that I
was also obese and hadn't hit puber
ty, and the jokes got even crueler.
Things sometimes got really ugly
with physical altercations that often
left me hurt and bruised. I remem
ber often hiding in some remote cor
ner of the school so the bullies
wouldn't find me during lunchtime.
Bullying is one of the most horri
ble things you can ever experience
in your life, because it crushes your

self-esteem and makes you utterly
powerless. It still pains me as I think
about it. Bullying is also, unfortu
nately, not limited to high school and
not limited to the LGBT communi
ty-
Bullying is real and present at
even an accepting community like
Stanford. I know personal friends
who have been verbally and, in some
cases, physically bullied by so-called
friends, roommates, significant oth
ers, teammates and sometimes even
complete strangers.
But you don't have to accept any
of it.
You don't have to accept it be
cause you can't give them the satis
faction that they have gotten to you.
You don't have to accept it be
cause doing so will validate their
claims over your mind, your body
and most importantly, your self-re
spect.
You don't have to accept it be
cause you are an incredible, inspir
ing individual with a beautiful, rich
life ahead of you that you cannot
wait to get to.
It honestly does get better. Fast
forward a few months from New
Zealand. My parents moved to New
York City. My school was more di
verse and a lot more accepting. I had
always been shy, introverted and
quiet, but I made the best decision of
my life and joined the debate team.
I devoted to it all my time and ener
gy, gained much-needed self-esteem
and confidence and graduated as
one of the top debaters in the coun
try. After I entered Stanford, I start
ed exercising and eating better,
gradually lost weight and gained a fit
physique. I worked at free clinics ed
ucating others to make similar
lifestyle changes and now run a non
profit organization that is, among
other things, working to expand
such education to clinics nation
wide.
I know it can sometimes feel ex
cruciatingly hard and painful right
