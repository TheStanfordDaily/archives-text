# Relay for Life

### KELSEY BECHELLI, '11 
When my twin sister and I
were four months old and
our brother Matt was
three, our dad noticed that he could
not stay awake at night to help my
mom care for us. Fie could not pick
us up because we were too heavy
for him. For a 33-year-old family
oriented guy, these symptoms were
worrisome and prompted him to go
to the doctor. My dad was diag
nosed with chronic myelogenous
leukemia, an aggressive cancer of
the blood.
Immediately, my parents re
searched treatment options and de
cided to go forward with a bone
marrow transplant. Essentially, in
tensive chemo and radiation thera
py killed all of my dad's cells, strik
ing a careful balance not to kill him
but to kill everything else in his
body. With all cells inside of my dad
completely wiped out (people can
only survive in this state for a num
ber of hours), doctors injected
healthy bone marrow from my
uncle Mike into my dad, rescuing
him. No one really knew what
would happen next, as this treat
ment was experimental at the time.
My dad's body began reproducing
Mike's cells and things looked great
for about five months.
When my dad relapsed, the doc
tors told him there was nothing
they could do. The cancer was
back, stronger than before and his
only option was to wait a year, until
his body could undergo another
bone marrow transplant. Knowing

that he probably did not have a
year to wait, my mom contacted a
doctor conducting cancer research
at Fred Flutchinson Cancer Re
search Center in Seattle, Washing
ton. Dr. Flugano enrolled my dad
in her study of an interferon drug.
This drug and the work of an amaz
ing team of cancer researchers put
my dad in remission and he has
been cancer free for the last 20
years.
The most recent cancer statistics
estimate that in 2011, approximate
ly 1.5 million people will be diag
nosed with cancer and over half a
million people will not survive their
battle with the disease. My dad was
there, teaching me how to ride my
bike, helping me with math home
work, encouraging me on a daily
basis to be the best I can be. I cannot
imagine what my life would have
been like without him there. I Relay
because I am and always will be
grateful for the cancer research that
saved my dad, and I hope that it
continues to save others in the fu
ture. Stanford Relay for Life will
take place this weekend, May 14 to
May 15, at the Stanford track. We in
vite you to participate in our games,
win awesome prizes, listen to the
best bands on campus, eat delicious
food, hear inspiring stories and
most importantly, support our fight
against cancer or honor someone
you love this weekend at Stanford
Relay for Life.
