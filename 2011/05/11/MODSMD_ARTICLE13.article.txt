# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Dear Editor,

The editorial in The Stanford Daily
of May 6,2011 is correct in pointing
out that alumni interviews of
prospective students may not add
to the information that the Admis
sion Office already has. However,
it misses the point when it states
that the interviews may be detri
mental to disadvantaged candi
dates who may not be as "poised"
as those from more privileged
backgrounds. I was an alumni in
terviewer for many years for Yale,
and the main purpose of that role
was to provide personal experi

ence and impressions of Yale to the
candidates to help them decide if
Yale was the right school for them.
It can serve to reassure all candi
dates that their application would
be considered "holistically." Serv
ing on the alumni interview com
mittee served also to bond alumni
to the University, although it does
create more work for the Admis
sion Office. In any case, the call for
Stanford to end the alumni inter
view committee does not seem to
stand on much merit.
