## On Ecotourism 
### Johnny Bartz 
Iwas a child who dreamt of frol
icking in the rainforest with
macaws, monkeys, iguanas and
butterflies, however it wasn't until I
came to Stanford that I actually re
alized those dreams. Since I'm all
about sharing experiences, I'd like
to plant the seeds for you to have
your own rainforest adventure on
an ecotourism trip. It isn't as hard or
expensive as you think.
First, there is a distinction one
must make when labeling some
thing as ecotourism. It is an experi
ence out in nature where the
wildlife acts naturally. This means
no feeding the monkeys to make
them come close to tourists for pic
tures. The field guides should be of
high caliber with specialized
training in tropical ecology and fa
miliarity with the proximate natural
system. The way in which one views
nature and the activities on an eco
tourism trip should ensure the fu
ture sustainability of the ecosystem,
and lastly you as the ecotourist must
give something back to the environ
ment or surrounding community.
The example that epitomizes a

proper ecotourism venture is Rain
forest Expeditions (RFE), a compa
ny that operates three ecolodges on
the Tambopata River in the Madre
de Dios region of Peru. It's cushy
ecotourism there are showers,
scented sheets, delicious cooked
meals and the best guides in all of
Peru as far as I'm concerned. Not to
mention you can fly to Puerto Mal
donado after a quick stop in Cuzco
(perfect chance to check out Machu
Picchu and the Sacred Valley of the
Incas), jump on a boat and in three
hours you are in the middle of the
rainforest.
One of the lodges, called Posada
Amazonas, has an interesting profit
sharing scheme between the eco
tourism company and the local Es
e 'eja community. Community mem

bers are involved in the decision
making process surrounding the
ecotourism operation, and many of
them are also employed at the
lodge. RFE is most famous for its
giant river otters found at oxbow
lakes and macaws at the clay lick.
The Tambopata Research Center
boasts the largest clay lick in the
world that attracts thousands of
birds every day, ranging in size from
parrotlets to the macaws. There is
nothing more spectacular than the
cacophony of the flocks of resplen
dent birds.
The lodges value scientific col
laboration, and each summer they
host Stanford students to conduct
research. Projects range in content
from forest carbon stocks, to stream
fish ecology, to macaw reproduction
and the impacts of tourists on
wildlife. For more information,
check out the Tambopata Summer
Research Program through the An
thropology department.
Yet, for every actual ecotourism
place one may visit, there are at

least five operators of what I like to
call 'poser ecotourism.' It's usually
small, unorganized, informal trips
led by 'knowledgeable local guides'
who are nothing more than people
who can speak English and enter
tain a crowd.
One such example I experi
enced was in Iquitos, Peru. A kid my
age approached my friend and me
on the street, and soon we had ne
gotiated a good price and were
aboard a little boat humming down
the Amazon. There were many
memorable kitsch 'ecotourism' ac
tivities, but the best/worst was a
visit to an island of tame rainforest
animals. Monkeys were thrown into
our arms which we carefully set
on the ground, for fear of the dis
ease. A coati attacked me from a
nearby tree, crazed by the shiny
carabineer on my backpack. An
anaconda was put around my neck,
which thankfully did not suffocate
me. The icing on the cake was the
sad toucan that didn't even have
the dignity to fly away from my
shoulder. It wasn't ecotourism and
more importantly it didn't come
with a rabies shot.
Unfortunately, many 'eco

tourism' adventures follow the lat
ter example. I highly encourage you
to do your homework before being
disappointed or supporting an ac
tivity that actually harms surround
ing ecological and human commu
nities. A good way to determine le
gitimacy is to look for websites, sus
tainability certifications, testimoni
als and photos of the lodges and ac
tivities.
If all else fails, and you're ready
to get your hands dirty and brave
the mosquitos, I suggest you find a
conservation project that sounds
interesting and contact the re
searchers with an offer to volunteer
your time for a week or two. Usual
ly you'll 'make a donation' which
essentially is a modest fee to cover
your basic food and lodging ex
penses. You won't have laundry
service or scented sheets, but you
will gain hands-on experience
working in the field while making
positive contributions to an envi
ronmental cause.
Whether you actually work on a
project or simply exercise the
power of the purse, wherever you
travel, ecotourism or not, you carry
an impact on local economies and
environments. Trust me, responsi
ble travel is the new cool thing.

ecotourism experience. Tell him

to plant the seeds for you to have
your own rainforest adventure on
an ecotourism trip. It isn't as hard or
expensive as you think.
First, there is a distinction one
must make when labeling some
thing as ecotourism. It is an experi
ence out in nature where the
wildlife acts naturally. This means
no feeding the monkeys to make
them come close to tourists for pic
tures. The field guides should be of
high caliber with specialized
training in tropical ecology and fa
miliarity with the proximate natural
system. The way in which one views
nature and the activities on an eco
tourism trip should ensure the fu
ture sustainability of the ecosystem,
and lastly you as the ecotourist must
give something back to the environ
ment or surrounding community.
The example that epitomizes a

proper ecotourism venture is Rain
forest Expeditions (RFE), a compa
ny that operates three ecolodges on
the Tambopata River in the Madre
de Dios region of Peru. It's cushy
ecotourism there are showers,
scented sheets, delicious cooked
meals and the best guides in all of
Peru as far as I'm concerned. Not to
mention you can fly to Puerto Mal
donado after a quick stop in Cuzco
(perfect chance to check out Machu
Picchu and the Sacred Valley of the
Incas), jump on a boat and in three
hours you are in the middle of the
rainforest.
One of the lodges, called Posada
Amazonas, has an interesting profit
sharing scheme between the eco
tourism company and the local Es
e 'eja community. Community mem

bers are involved in the decision
making process surrounding the
ecotourism operation, and many of
them are also employed at the
lodge. RFE is most famous for its
giant river otters found at oxbow
lakes and macaws at the clay lick.
The Tambopata Research Center
boasts the largest clay lick in the
world that attracts thousands of
birds every day, ranging in size from
parrotlets to the macaws. There is
nothing more spectacular than the
cacophony of the flocks of resplen
dent birds.
The lodges value scientific col
laboration, and each summer they
host Stanford students to conduct
research. Projects range in content
from forest carbon stocks, to stream
fish ecology, to macaw reproduction
and the impacts of tourists on
wildlife. For more information,
check out the Tambopata Summer
Research Program through the An
thropology department.
Yet, for every actual ecotourism
place one may visit, there are at

least five operators of what I like to
call 'poser ecotourism.' It's usually
small, unorganized, informal trips
led by 'knowledgeable local guides'
who are nothing more than people
who can speak English and enter
tain a crowd.
One such example I experi
enced was in Iquitos, Peru. A kid my
age approached my friend and me
on the street, and soon we had ne
gotiated a good price and were
aboard a little boat humming down
the Amazon. There were many
memorable kitsch 'ecotourism' ac
tivities, but the best/worst was a
visit to an island of tame rainforest
animals. Monkeys were thrown into
our arms which we carefully set
on the ground, for fear of the dis
ease. A coati attacked me from a
nearby tree, crazed by the shiny
carabineer on my backpack. An
anaconda was put around my neck,
which thankfully did not suffocate
me. The icing on the cake was the
sad toucan that didn't even have
the dignity to fly away from my
shoulder. It wasn't ecotourism and
more importantly it didn't come
with a rabies shot.
Unfortunately, many 'eco

tourism' adventures follow the lat
ter example. I highly encourage you
to do your homework before being
disappointed or supporting an ac
tivity that actually harms surround
ing ecological and human commu
nities. A good way to determine le
gitimacy is to look for websites, sus
tainability certifications, testimoni
als and photos of the lodges and ac
tivities.
If all else fails, and you're ready
to get your hands dirty and brave
the mosquitos, I suggest you find a
conservation project that sounds
interesting and contact the re
searchers with an offer to volunteer
your time for a week or two. Usual
ly you'll 'make a donation' which
essentially is a modest fee to cover
your basic food and lodging ex
penses. You won't have laundry
service or scented sheets, but you
will gain hands-on experience
working in the field while making
positive contributions to an envi
ronmental cause.
Whether you actually work on a
project or simply exercise the
power of the purse, wherever you
travel, ecotourism or not, you carry
an impact on local economies and
environments. Trust me, responsi
ble travel is the new cool thing.
