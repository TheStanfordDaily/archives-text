# OP-ED
## ROTC: Provost Etchemendy, Open, Not Close The Doors To Dissent 
### JONATHAN POTO, '13 
Last Thursday, a week after the
Faculty Senate's controversial
decision to support the rein
statement of ROTC at Stanford,
Provost John Etchemendy issued an
op-ed directed at students who felt
the decision condoned prejudice
against transgender people. While
reaching out to the student body was
a commendable action in itself,
Etchemendy's taking sides with the
pro-return camp, then undemocrati
cally calling for an end to the anger of
the anti-return camp without ad
dressing their additional frustrations,
sends a message that Stanford's ad
ministration does not respect the
rights of the students to oppose deci
sions made by the administration.
Provost Etchemendy attempts to
reach out to the anti-return commu
nity saying, "It took great courage
for our transgender students to pub
licly express their opposition to
ROTC." Etchemendy, however, fol
lows this with a contradictory assess
ment of those opposed to ROTC's
return, saying, "It continues to trou
ble me that any student would inter
pret the ROTC decision as a sign
that the University does not honor
and respect its transgender students,
faculty and staff."
After reading such a bold state
ment, I was hoping for Provost
Etchemendy to defend it name
ly, by addressing the lingering con
cerns of the transgender population
on campus. Etchemendy, rather
than doing this, simply tells the op
position to stop being so angry at
the administration because
"whichever way the decision went,
it would be interpreted by some

members of the community as a
sign ... that their interests, feelings
and principles were somehow less
important," i.e. because the decision
was hard. This shows disrespect to
ward transgender people who are
understandably upset when they
see what appears to them as Stan
ford condoning sexual discrimina
tion and institutionalizing it for the
long haul by supporting a group
that represents the perpetrators of
sexual discrimination. Note that I
say, "what appears to them." Even
though this topic is by no means
clear, Etchemendy must do more to
show respect for the gravity of the
issue, discrimination, or else the all
of LGBT community, all members
of some racial or non-racial minori
ty group and the rest of the Stanford
population are threatened in their
right to have respectful, emotional
and anti-administrative discourse.
By making an ill-conceived attempt
to quiet the debate by asking stu
dents to bow down to faculty and
administrative decisions, Provost
Etchemendy manifests a false no
tion that the administration of Stan
ford has moral supremacy over its
students that in the face of dis
sent, the administration reigns.
Provost Etchemendy, as a lead
ing administrator and an incredibly
intelligent individual, should be
aware of and able to address the ad
ditional concerns of the transgen
der population. Instead,
Etchemendy falls rank-and-file be
hind faculty senators who "were
swayed by the hope that as more
military leaders are drawn from
communities like ours ... the more

quickly any remaining discrimina
tion based on sexual orientation or
gender identity will genuinely
cease," then simply says, "I hope
that is true," His blind hope leaves
open the unanswered questions
that lie at the root of the continued
frustration. What reason have we to
believe that by training future mili
tary leaders in a liberal institution
that those leaders will not be forced
to conform once they reach the mil
itary? That ROTC itself does not re
inforce the discriminative? That our
"liberal" institution, which fails to
truly listen to all the concerns of the
transgender population, will ingrain
in future leaders here the values
they need to stand up to years and
years of established discrimination
in the military? By not attempting
to assuage these concerns,

Etchemendy effectively says that
students' concerns come second to
the prerogatives of the institution,
and that the administrators of this
school, rather than offering their in
credible perspective to enlighten all
students on the intricacies of these
controversial topics, will choose to
evade dissent.
Provost Etchemendy ends his
op-ed with a plea to the transgender
population and their allies, saying,
"Our community is far from perfect,
but it is remarkably accepting. Let
us use this opportunity to reaffirm
our values and to strengthen our
community." To you, Provost
Etchemendy, I return this plea, ask
ing you to take another brave step
from what you've already done, and
address the lingering concerns of
the transgender population and

their supporters. Our community of
students is not perfectly wise in our
views. However, our community of
students, willing to stand up to what
we see as discrimination, is remark
ably accepting. If you have the
courage to address our reasonable
reservations then we will change the
tone of our dissent and work with
you more collaboratively. We want
the opportunity to stand in equity
with the administration in strength
ening the values of this institution,
so that future generations of Stan
ford students can promote a well
thought-out set of values in the insti
tutions they are destined to lead. We
will not, however, accept any call for
passivity, for servility or for weak
ness in doing so.
