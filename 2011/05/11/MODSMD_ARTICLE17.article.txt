## CARDINAL ROLLS Baseball beats Aggies, moves to 11-1 in midweek games 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford baseball team
continued its midweek magic on
Tuesday, overpowering UC-Davis
in every facet of the game en route
to an 11-4 victory.
The Cardinal (27-16, 9-9 Pac
-10) clobbered the Aggie pitching
staff for 14 hits and got a solid start
ing performance from sophomore
righty Dean McArdle, who extend
ed his record to 7-2 by holding the
Aggies (14-26) to just three earned
runs in 6.1 innings.

Freshman right fielder Austin
Wilson, who went 3-for-5 on Tues
day night, said the game was anoth
er example of the team's high con
fidence and good hitting as of late.
"I feel like we're just hot as a
team right now," Wilson said.
"We're kind of clicking, and just
getting into a good win streak right
now."
Wilson's solid night at the plate
raised his batting average to .331
on the year, but he wasn't the only
one who had a good night at the
dish, as sophomore third baseman
Stephen Piscotty went 2-for-3 with
two walks and three RBI and
freshman designated hitter Danny
Diekroeger, shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger and sophomore center
fielder Tyler Gaffney all had two

RBI.
After not registering a hit in the
first two innings, Stanford brought
19 men to the plate in the third and
fourth innings, pushing across nine
runs on eight hits to boast a 9-1 lead
after four.
After freshman first baseman
Brian Ragira plated another run in
the fifth, UC-Davis chipped away
at the Cardinal lead in the top of
the seventh, when pinch hitter
Spencer Brann smashed a two-run
home run over the right field wall
to cut the lead to 10-3.
McArdle was chased from the
game after giving up two more sin
gles in the inning, and another run
scored when junior lefty Scott
Snodgress' pitch got past senior
catcher Zach Jones, making the
lead 10-4.
Sophomore Kenny Diekroeger
answered back in the bottom of the
inning with an RBI single for Stan
ford j ust after Ragira dashed all the

way to second base on a dropped
third strike.
Snodgress passed the ball to fel
low junior A.J. Talt to close out the
game, and the righty sidearmer
cruised through the ninth, striking
out one and giving up one hit be
fore shutting the door on the Ag
gies with a soft grounder to second
base.
With the victory, the Cardinal
extended its winning streak to six
games and is now 12-1 in games
played on either Monday or Tues
day this season.
Despite giving up 12 hits to UC-
Davis on Tuesday, Wilson said the
team had "no concerns" going into
another weekend of Pac-10 confer
ence play, this time at Oregon.
"We're very confident, the win
last weekend against Washington
was huge," Wilson said. "So getting
this win, going into Oregon, I feel
like this confidence will help us a
lot.

"We're feeling good and swing
ing the bat well, hopefully that can
just stay within us and we can con
tinue to pick each other up," he
added.
That confidence stems largely
from the Cardinal's hot bats, as
Wilson's improved hitting along
with Piscotty's extraordinary .373
batting average means that nine
Cardinal hitters now have batting
averages above .300.
Wilson attributed the team's
success to better maturity for a
team that regularly starts seven or
eight underclassmen, including his
own development at the plate.
"For me, it's been better plate
discipline and really seeing the ball
well," Wilson said. "It's been not
missing my pitch, and I've just been
working on that in the cage, just
driving the ball to center field and
letting the hits come, basically."

GAME NOTES: Perhaps peaking at the right
time, Stanford enters this weekend's series
at Oregon riding a season-long six-game
winning streak. Last weekend the Cardinal
swept Washington to move into a tie for
fifth place in the Pac-10 at 9-9. After being
ranked to start the season, Oregon has
had a disappointing season.



JOHN SCHOECH/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore righty Dean McArdle, above, improved to 7-2 on the season in Tuesday's 11-4 win over UC-Davis.
McArdle went 6.1 innings and allowed four runs on 10 hits while striking out one. This was an encouraging outing
for McArdle, who had struggled of late. Stanford travels to Oregon for a three-game series this weekend.
