I don't quite know what to make
of the controversy over Pitts
burgh Steelers running back
Rashard MendenhalPs tweets
about the successful operation to
kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
To give a quick recap, Mendenhall
posted a couple of bin Laden-related
tweets on May 2, the day after the news
initially broke. He first wrote, "What
kind of person celebrates death? It's
amazing how people can HATE a man
they have never even heard speak.
We've only heard one side..."

He also later added another tweet,
saying, "For those of you who said you
want to see Bin Laden burn in hell and
piss on his ashes, I ask how would God
feel about your heart?"
Despite an attempt to clarify those
messages, Mendenhall's comments
whipped up a predictable storm of con
troversy across the Internet, with
sports commentators and other ath
letes rushing to pass judgment. The
Steelers organization issued a state
ment distancing itself from Menden
hall and his comments, and he quickly
lost one of his corporate endorsements.
The running back was generally ostra
cized and condemned for what looked
like a statement in favor of bin Laden.
A commentator at a Pennsylvania
newspaper, Mark Madden, even
opined that the Steelers should cut
Mendenhall if he does not apologize
and that the organization should bar its
players from maintaining public ac

counts on social networks like Twitter
and Facebook.

I disagree with Madden's stance on
cutting Mendenhall the premise
that you can be fired from your job for
expressing contrarian views worries
me deeply. However, it's interesting
that he would suggest preventing ath
letes from accessing social network
ing.

Before the advent of the Internet
and the spread of social networking,
athletes and their comments were
generally filtered by several sources
before ever reaching the public eye.
Every professional and college team
has media relations staff tasked specif
ically with managing the public per
sonas of their athletes.

Generally, athletes (and anyone,
for that matter) speak much more
carefully when there's a journalist
waving a microphone or a camera in
their faces.The "old media," as it were,
acts as a kind of filter itself, as only a
small fraction of sound bites from a

press conference actually end up in
print or on Sports Center. Even then,
there's always a media relations
staffer on hand to shut down the inter
view if the questions get too edgy.
By contrast, social networking
websites and other Internet media
platforms, like Hogging, allows players
to reach fans and the public unfiltered.
Twitter doesn't have any of the con
trols that exist in the traditional media
business; no Steelers staffer monitors
every tweet from every player. How
ever, that forum is just as public, and
sometimes even more so, than the san
itized comments that dreary sports
writers and columnists (like yours
truly) write up and run in print on a
weekly basis.
So back to the original question:
should professional and college teams
ban athletes from using Twitter or
maintaining public Facebook pro
files? My initial reaction, naturally, is
that they shouldn't to do so would
abridge the First Amendment rights
that my colleagues and I hold dear.
However, athletes are very public rep
resentatives of their teams and
achieve large followings in the first
place only because of those high-pro
file positions. Whether I agree with it

or not, Mendenhall's comments did
not reflect well on the Steelers, whom
he is charged with representing in
public.
Still, I like having athletes on Twit
ter, and I think the fans and the athletes
themselves like it, too. The best solu
tion, then, is probably one that com
bines the speed and connectivity of
new media with the controls that exist
ed in older media.Teams shouldn't kick
athletes off Twitter altogether, but in
stead should require that players put all
tweets through their media depart
ment before sending them out into the
web. Athletes will still get to tweet, fans
will get to connect with their favorite
players and organizations won't find
themselves unexpectedly embarrassed
by the players who represent them.
