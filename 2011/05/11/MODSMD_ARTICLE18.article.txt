I don't quite know what to make
of the controversy over Pitts
burgh Steelers running back
Rashard MendenhalPs tweets
about the successful operation to
kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
To give a quick recap, Mendenhall
posted a couple of bin Laden-related
tweets on May 2, the day after the news
initially broke. He first wrote, "What
kind of person celebrates death? It's
amazing how people can HATE a man
they have never even heard speak.
We've only heard one side..."

He also later added another tweet,
saying, "For those of you who said you
want to see Bin Laden burn in hell and
piss on his ashes, I ask how would God
feel about your heart?"
Despite an attempt to clarify those
messages, Mendenhall's comments
whipped up a predictable storm of con
troversy across the Internet, with
sports commentators and other ath
letes rushing to pass judgment. The
Steelers organization issued a state
ment distancing itself from Menden
hall and his comments, and he quickly
lost one of his corporate endorsements.
The running back was generally ostra
cized and condemned for what looked
like a statement in favor of bin Laden.
A commentator at a Pennsylvania
newspaper, Mark Madden, even
opined that the Steelers should cut
Mendenhall if he does not apologize
and that the organization should bar its
players from maintaining public ac

Teams should
keep track of
