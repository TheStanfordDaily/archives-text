# Pac-12 unveils preliminary football TV schedule
## 
### â€”Daniel Bohm 
Four 2011 Stanford football
games were selected to be broad
cast on ABC and ESPN yesterday.

The sister networks announced
their initial Pac-12 TV schedule,
which will likely be amended be
fore the college football season
kicks off in September.
Stanford's Sept. 17 game at Ari
zona is set to be televised on ESPN
at 7:45 p.m. and its Oct. 22 game ver
sus Washington is scheduled to be
on either ABC, ESPN or ESPN2 at
5 p.m. The following week, on Oct.
29, Stanford travels to Los Angeles
for a much-anticipated game at
USC, which ABC is scheduled to
televise at 5 p.m. The last game that
has already been assigned a TV slot
is the Cardinal's season finale,
which comes at Stanford Stadium
against Notre Dame on Nov. 26.
Like the Washington game, Stan
ford's matchup with Notre Dame
will be broadcast on either ABC or
one of the two main ESPN net
works.
It is likely that more Stanford
games will be added to the TV
schedule at a later date. The most
notable unassigned game is Stan
ford's Nov. 12 tussle with Oregon,
which pits two of the nation's pre
season top-10 teams against one an
other. ABC and ESPN have yet to
confirm which games will be broad
cast on Nov. 12.
As a conference, the Pac-12 will
see at least 20 games broadcast by
ABC or ESPN throughout its inau

gural season. As the season pro
gresses, selections that have yet to
be confirmed will be announced ei
ther six or 12 days in advance of the
relevant game.
