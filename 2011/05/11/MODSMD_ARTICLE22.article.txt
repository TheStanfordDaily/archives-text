Head coach John Vargas an
nounced the newest members of
the Stanford men's water polo team
yesterday, confirming that Alex
Bowen, Michael Carter, Robert
Dunlevie and Clayton Evans will be
taking to the water with the Cardi
nal this fall.
For a team that fell in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
Championship final and ended the
2010 season 15-8 (5-3 MPSF), the
announcement is a small but impor
tant development as the fall season
approaches and Stanford looks to
make another run at the conference
title.
A San Diego native, Bowen is a
two-time prep All-American and
earned first-team honors as a senior
last fall. He's a two-time selection to
the San Diego Union Tribune's All-
Academic First Team and holds the
CIF San Diego Section's career
scoring record with 547 goals.

Bowen also boasts considerable
international experience, having
played with the U.S. Youth and Ju
nior National Teams since 2008. As
a junior Olympian, Bowen is a six
time All-American.
Carter, the only recruit that hails
from a state other than California,
comes to Stanford from
Lawrenceville, N.J. after moving to
the U.S. with his parents from
South Africa. He was named to the
Northeast Zone Youth/Junior
Team every year from 2008-10 and
was an All-American at the 2010
junior Olympics. Carter has also
made a splash on Lawrenceville's
swimming team, earning All-
American honors in his junior and
senior seasons.
Dunlevie won't be moving far
this fall, as he's a product of the
nearby Sacred Heart Preparatory
School. He was a team captain for
the Gators and led them to a sec
ond-place finish in the CCS Divi
sion II championships last year.
Stanford has seen contributions
from the Dunlevie family before, as
Robert's older sister Vee is a cur
rent member of the women's water
polo team.
The only goalie of the bunch,
Evans is a 2010 All-American out
of Los Angeles' Loyola High
School. He captained the Cubs dur
