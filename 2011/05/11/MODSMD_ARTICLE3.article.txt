## Tablo delves into identity at Asian Images 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Korean hip-hop star and Stanford
graduate Tablo spoke Tuesday evening
at the annual Asian Images event in his
first public appearance in over a year.
Daniel Seonwoong Lee 'Ol M.A.
'O2, also known as Tablo, the front man
for Korean hip-hop group Epik High,
addressed a variety of topics with an
intimate gathering of students in Cub
berley Auditorium.
Christopher Sung 'l2 moderated
the discussion, and questions from au
dience members for Lee were re
ceived via text message. Sung opened
the discussion by asking Lee about
identifying with multiple cultures; Lee
has lived in Korea, Canada and the
U.S.
"I never really thought of myself as
Asian until I was put into a position
where I had to," he said. "Learning to

deal with being Asian was learning to
deal with being different."
Lee also addressed issues of
parental pressure, discussing his par
ents' initial disappointment in his cho
sen career path.
"When I told [my parents] I wanted
to do music, they actually thought I
was insane," Lee said.
"The dilemma between doing what
they wanted and following my passion
... wasn't a dilemma at all," he added.
"If you seriously consider giving up
your passion, it probably means you
aren't passionate enough. If you have a
passion you just go."
Sung proceeded to ask Lee a series
of difficult questions, including his atti
tude towards the influence of academ
ics on entering a creative industry. Lee
graduated from Stanford with a bach
elor's and master's degree in English
Literature in just three and a half years.
"How Stanford affects careers is

different for everyone," he said. "It's
dependent on whether you're apply
ing your time on what you envision or
hope your future to be. If you're spend
ing all of your time on academics...
that's all you're going to get out of
Stanford or any college."
"I spent a lot of time doing things
that no one asked me to do," he added,
like performing his music on campus
and in clubs in San Francisco.
Instead of focusing on his music ca
reer, Lee spoke about his college
roommate, who spent much of his time
at Stanford photographing landscapes
and was recently featured in a "100
most creative people" list.
"I wish I could tell you he was in
[the magazine] for photography, but
he's actually working at Google," Lee
said.
Lee's roommate helped to create
Google Streetview.
"He merged his 'inside time' at
Stanford, with his major in computer
science or whatever, and his outside
hobby to create something new," Lee
said. "That's a remarkable example
of what you can do."

Lee also answered two "darker"
questions, as Sung called them: bat
tling depression and dealing with re
cent attacks by Internet communities
on his Stanford credentials, which af
fected his family in Korea. He first ac
knowledged the campus phenome
non known as the Stanford Duck
Syndrome.
"When I was here, we didn't have
that term," he said. "I think it de
scribes pretty much what I went
through, too ... I went through de
pression at Stanford but not because
of Stanford, and I was treated at Stan
ford medical center. It wasn't some
thing that was blocking my life entire
ly, but maybe that's because I was
open to seeking help and speaking to
people about it."
Lee then turned to the attempts
by netizens last summer to defame
him and his family over the validity of
his Stanford degree, before becom

ing visibly upset by the memories.
"It's not exactly a South Korean
problem; it's an Internet problem,"
he said. "The Internet doesn't have
borders."

"My stress was never about
whether or not people believe what
people were saying about my creden
tials; it was never about being recog
nized," Lee said. "It doesn't change
my past, what I've learned or what
I've accomplished. My stress had
everything to do with the fact that my
family was being attacked. It never
went beyond that for me."
Lee remained in good spirits
throughout his discussion, pausing
only to note his nervousness and to
joke occasionally with Sung. When
asked if Lee had any imparting wis
dom for students, he wasn't sure how
to answer.

"How do I give advice? Success is
overrated. Friendship is underrated.
And the best movies are R-rated," he
joked.
The Asian Images event was
hosted by the Stanford Asian Amer
ican Students' Association as part of
an annual series that brings promi
nent members of Asian Pacific Is
lander cultures to discuss identity
and life in the public eye with Stan
ford students.
