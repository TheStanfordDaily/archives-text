## Tablo delves into identity at Asian Images 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Korean hip-hop star and Stanford
graduate Tablo spoke Tuesday evening
at the annual Asian Images event in his
first public appearance in over a year.
Daniel Seonwoong Lee 'Ol M.A.
'O2, also known as Tablo, the front man
for Korean hip-hop group Epik High,
addressed a variety of topics with an
intimate gathering of students in Cub
berley Auditorium.
Christopher Sung 'l2 moderated
the discussion, and questions from au
dience members for Lee were re
ceived via text message. Sung opened
the discussion by asking Lee about
identifying with multiple cultures; Lee
has lived in Korea, Canada and the
U.S.
"I never really thought of myself as
Asian until I was put into a position
where I had to," he said. "Learning to

deal with being Asian was learning to
deal with being different."
Lee also addressed issues of
parental pressure, discussing his par
ents' initial disappointment in his cho
sen career path.
"When I told [my parents] I wanted
to do music, they actually thought I
was insane," Lee said.
"The dilemma between doing what
they wanted and following my passion
... wasn't a dilemma at all," he added.
"If you seriously consider giving up
your passion, it probably means you
aren't passionate enough. If you have a
passion you just go."
Sung proceeded to ask Lee a series
of difficult questions, including his atti
tude towards the influence of academ
ics on entering a creative industry. Lee
graduated from Stanford with a bach
elor's and master's degree in English
Literature in just three and a half years.
"How Stanford affects careers is

different for everyone," he said. "It's
dependent on whether you're apply
ing your time on what you envision or
hope your future to be. If you're spend
ing all of your time on academics...
that's all you're going to get out of
Stanford or any college."
"I spent a lot of time doing things
that no one asked me to do," he added,
like performing his music on campus
and in clubs in San Francisco.
Instead of focusing on his music ca
reer, Lee spoke about his college
roommate, who spent much of his time
at Stanford photographing landscapes
and was recently featured in a "100
most creative people" list.
"I wish I could tell you he was in
[the magazine] for photography, but
he's actually working at Google," Lee
said.
Lee's roommate helped to create
