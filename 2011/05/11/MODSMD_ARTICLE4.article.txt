# School of Medicine aims to turn'pure' science into cures
## Emphasis placed on translational research 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In recent years, the conversa
tion on medical advances has
brought forth a striking observa
tion: new medical treatments have
emerged in low numbers despite
simultaneous increases in re
search funding and published
findings. Critics blame these stag
nant numbers on a lack of transla
tional research at the national
level Stanford, however, stands
out as an exception to this trend.

The School of Medicine has
spearheaded various programs
with the objective of "translating"
scientific discoveries into human
trials and studies. The Interdisci
plinary Translational Research
Program (ITRP), for instance,
links the basic sciences with clini
cal science to develop new diag
nostic and therapeutic treatments.
The program serves as a collabo
rative breeding ground for med
ical students, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and clinical
fellows.
"I think we're a big exception,"
said Irv Weissman, director of
Stanford's Institute of Stem Cell
Biology and Regenerative Medi
cine.
"In all honesty, the University
top to bottom wants this, to bring
in people who are the translation
alists who bring not only clinical
excellence, but a history of doing
and wanting to do clinical trials,"
Weissman said.
But more could be done.
National Institutes of Health
(NIH) appropriations have in
creased from approximately

$3,569 billion in 1980 to nearly
$30,860 billion in 2010. In 2010, the
Food and Drug Administration's
(FDA) Center for Drug Evalua
tion and Research approved 21
new molecular entities, down from
26 in 2009.
According to Philip Pizzo, dean
of the School of Medicine, looking
at dollar values alone can be mis
leading.
"It is certainly true that funding
for biomedical research has been a
major resource for the U.S. and
has helped make this nation the
leader in biosciences," Pizzo wrote
in an email to The Daily." [But] it is
also true that on average that
funding has not kept pace with in
flation over the last decade."
"We are looking at bleak fund
ing for research over the next
years, below inflation, because of
the national economy," he said.
Medical school experts say that
obstacles to translational research
and new treatment development
come in many other shapes and
forms.
Pocketbook, priorities and Big
Pharma
In general, scientists obtain
funding for biomedical research
by submitting grant proposals to
the NIH and other agencies.
"NIH is our biggest funder,"
said Kathleen Thompson, director
of the medical school's research
management group. "They fund a
little more than half of the re
search in the School of Medicine."

As desirable as it is, federal
funding comes with strings at
tached.
"What their focus is or what their
budget is for each institute, and what
areas of disease they're most inter
ested in are typically what's driving

whether or not we do research in
certain areas," Thompson said.
Neurobiology professor Ben Bar
res thinks that academia needs to
look beyond federal agencies to fi
nance translational research, espe
cially given the current funding crisis.

"I would like to see much more
collaboration between academia
and industry," Barres said.
"There's some parts that we are
very good at and there are other
good parts industry is good at," he
added.

At Stanford, industry funding
does exist, but it is small relative to
other money sources.
"We do get industry sponsored
projects," Thompson said. "They're
typically in the form of clinical trials,
but it's only about 10 percent of our
overall research funding that comes
from clinical trials."

Meanwhile, the medical school's
clinical trial volume has remained
fairly flat over the past three years.

"We were almost in the exact
same place that we were in the last
two years," Thompson said.
Even when industry isn't the one
paying the bills, the evolution from
discovery to treatment still relies on
pharmaceutical companies. Once
medical findings are published, the

idea is to get them picked up by the
pharmaceutical industry. Translation
to diagnostic and therapeutic appli
cations usually hinges on this latter
step.

But Big Pharma hasn't always
been game. Industry players are not
too keen about financing research
when they do not own the intellectu
al property rights.
Stanford scientists, for their part,
have reservations about industry ties
too.

"I think there is a lot of effort
going on to try to improve relation
ships with industry sponsors,"
Thompson said. "But there are also
issues related to our academic free
dom that sometimes becomes an
issue with industry sponsors the
right to publish freely [for example].
Sometimes industry sponsors want
you to keep certain information con
fidential and we just can't do that,
that's not what our mission is."
Medical mentality
In the past, there has been a pre
vailing bias in favor of "pure" sci
ence, rather than research on med
ical applications and disease treat
ments. A decade ago, translational
science which often involves
grunt work did not necessarily

help the ambitious young scientist
who aimed to ascend the university
hierarchy.
But at Stanford, a change has
come. The Masters of Medicine
(MOM) program, started by Barres,
is a clear example of this change.
Unique to the School of Medicine,
the MOM program aims to provide
doctoral students with training in
clinical medicine to enhance transla
tional research.

"We have this huge interest in
our incoming Ph.D. students ... 20
percent applied to take this pro
gram," Barres said.
He explained that the students
accepted to the MOM program
"learn about research" and "human
biology and human disease,"
That's not to say "pure" science
isn't important.
"I know from my own work that
and from being on the faculty here
for about 40 years, that we don't get
translational science unless we have
people doing pure science," Weiss
man said. "Sometimes, like in stem
cell research, the pure science dis
covery can lead rapidly to transla
tion to medical trials and hopefully
soon medical therapies."
For now, the challenge is finding a
way to provide interested students
with the opportunity to participate
in this innovative field.

"The big thing for us is to be able
to fund people who want to be in
that place in translation," Weissman
said. "So that means instead of the
government cutting back on fund
ing, for people who want to do a joint
M.D. and Ph.D. degree, we ought to
increase it."

"I don't know of many people,
hardly anybody, who would say, 'I do
pure science and I don't care about
the medical implications,"' he added.
"On the other hand ... the drive to
ward translating discoveries is quite
recent."

"Getting the best and brightest
people to work on disease is the bat
tle," Barres said.
On that front, Stanford has al
ready made significant headway.

Ties to a broken healthcare system
Medical advances need to reach
actual patients in order to make a
difference. Weissman noted that the
imperfect healthcare system is an
other impediment to the develop
ment and application of new treat
ments.
"What has held back the transla
tion of advances in institutions like
Stanford to treat the general popu
lace, I would argue, is the lack of a
comprehensive medical insurance
for all people, rich and poor," he said.
According to Weissman, the U.S.
healthcare system is not national,
even with the Obama plan.
"These findings when done at
Stanford ... wouldn't budge the sta
tistics, unless everybody adopted
them," he said. "That costs money, it
costs the health care system. And in
our particular health care system, if
you're uninsured, you don't get
these therapies, largely."
Prognosis for the future
The future for translational re
search, especially at Stanford, still
shines brightly.
"This is time when people mov
ing into medical research careers
will be able to do the most to change
the outlook for curing and/or treat
ing serious mainline diseases,"
Weissman said.

Furthermore, the benefits of
medical progress may simply need a
little more time before they are fully
felt.

"It is important to know that in
vestments in research need to be
considered long-term ones," Pizzo
said. "Discoveries take years and
sometimes it's more than a decade
before they progress to a clinical
outcome. So the assumption that re
cent investments will have immedi
ate payoffs is unlikely.
"That said, there have been
major advances over the years in
clinical medicine because of re
search funding."
