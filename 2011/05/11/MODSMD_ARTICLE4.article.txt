# School of Medicine aims to turn'pure' science into cures
## Emphasis placed on translational research 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In recent years, the conversa
tion on medical advances has
brought forth a striking observa
tion: new medical treatments have
emerged in low numbers despite
simultaneous increases in re
search funding and published
findings. Critics blame these stag
nant numbers on a lack of transla
tional research at the national
level Stanford, however, stands
out as an exception to this trend.

The School of Medicine has
spearheaded various programs
with the objective of "translating"
scientific discoveries into human
trials and studies. The Interdisci
plinary Translational Research
Program (ITRP), for instance,
links the basic sciences with clini
cal science to develop new diag
nostic and therapeutic treatments.
The program serves as a collabo
rative breeding ground for med
ical students, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows and clinical
fellows.
"I think we're a big exception,"
said Irv Weissman, director of
Stanford's Institute of Stem Cell
Biology and Regenerative Medi
cine.
"In all honesty, the University
top to bottom wants this, to bring
in people who are the translation
alists who bring not only clinical
excellence, but a history of doing
and wanting to do clinical trials,"
Weissman said.
But more could be done.
National Institutes of Health
(NIH) appropriations have in
creased from approximately

$3,569 billion in 1980 to nearly
$30,860 billion in 2010. In 2010, the
Food and Drug Administration's
(FDA) Center for Drug Evalua
tion and Research approved 21
new molecular entities, down from
26 in 2009.
According to Philip Pizzo, dean
of the School of Medicine, looking
at dollar values alone can be mis
leading.
"It is certainly true that funding
for biomedical research has been a
major resource for the U.S. and
has helped make this nation the
leader in biosciences," Pizzo wrote
in an email to The Daily." [But] it is
also true that on average that
funding has not kept pace with in
flation over the last decade."
"We are looking at bleak fund
ing for research over the next
years, below inflation, because of
the national economy," he said.
Medical school experts say that
obstacles to translational research
and new treatment development
come in many other shapes and
forms.
Pocketbook, priorities and Big

In general, scientists obtain
funding for biomedical research
by submitting grant proposals to
the NIH and other agencies.
"NIH is our biggest funder,"
said Kathleen Thompson, director
of the medical school's research
management group. "They fund a
little more than half of the re
search in the School of Medicine."

As desirable as it is, federal
funding comes with strings at
