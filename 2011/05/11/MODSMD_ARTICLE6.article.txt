## Five appointed to Searsville Dam Committee 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Billy Gallagher 
Five Stanford faculty members specializ
ing in environmental science, history and law
have been named to a committee tasked with
studying the Searsville Dam for the next two
years. The committee will consider the needs
of the University, the surrounding communi
ty and the environment in order to recom
mend a course of action for its future.
Robert Reidy, vice president for Land,
Buildings and Real Estate, asked the five
members to join the Searsville Study Steer
ing Committee. The professors are Chris
Field, professor of biology and of environ
mental earth system science and faculty di
rector for the jasper Ridge Biological Pre

serve; Jeffrey Koseff, professor in the School
of Engineering and the director of the
Woods Institute for the Environment;
Pamela Matson, dean of the School of Earth
Sciences and a professor in environmental
studies; Barton Thompson Jr., a professor of
natural resources law and the director of the
Woods Institute and Richard White, a pro
fessor of American history.
The Searsville Dam and Reservoir, locat
ed in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, is
the only one of Stanford's water storage
dams located directly on a stream. Once used
for recreation, the lake now suffers from sed
imentation that has reduced the water quan
tity to 10 percent of its original capacity. The
dam is still a source of non-potable water
used at Stanford for landscape irrigation.
"There are many complicated issues in
volved in Searsville Dam and Reservoir, and
it is very important to the University that we
consider possible future actions with great

care," said Jean McCown, director of commu
nity relations, in a press release, "So we are
fortunate that scholars who have committed
their lives to studying environmental issues
have volunteered to help."

They will look at potential research and
academic programs at the Jasper Ridge Bio
logical Preserve, the University's water sup
ply and storage needs, biological diversity
including both the habitats and wetlands cre
ated by the reservoir as well as potential fish
passage upstream of the dam, the possible ef
fects on upstream and downstream flood risk
and the cost and impact of sediment removal,
disposal and ongoing management.
The committee will be helped by staff and
faculty members specializing in areas includ
ing engineering, hydrology, risk manage
ment, biology, land use, environmental plan
ning and environmental law.
