## Senate passes spending bills ASSU also approves Pub Board, Parliamentarian, Chief of Staff hills 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Senate passed a handful of
funding bills, approved its budget for next year
and passed several action items, notably creating
ASSU Parliamentarian and Publications Board
consultant positions and appointing Emma
Ogiemwanye 'l2 as ASSU executive chief of staff.
The senators began the meeting by reviewing
funding bills from student organizations. Three
examined in-depth were requests from fraternity
Sigma Phi Epsilon for funding to fix a community
house in East Palo Alto, from Project Motivation
for reserve funds for a keynote speaker and from
the Stanford African Students Association for the
majority of its spring funding to go toward a
speaker.

All three funding bills passed unanimously.
The ASSU budget also passed unanimously
after considerable debate. The rise in the alloca
tion for Senate associates from $250 to $l,OOO
generated contention, as senators mostly agreed
that the position was important, but many
thought it was not taken seriously enough to re
ceive more funding. After noting that the ASSU
endowment had increased enough to allow for
the extra allocation, the budget bill passed.
Several times throughout the meeting, sena
tors requested additional outlets for information
about past Senate actions. ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2 pointed to the online ASSU
Senate archives, noting that the hardcopy Senate
archive files were thrown away when the ASSU
rented space to Courserank.
A later bill creating the office of ASSU Parlia
mentarian was amended to include the responsi-
bility of highlighting year-to-year
changes in bills, especially budgets,
so that senators could better under
stand the decisions they were mak
ing.
Publications Board Director
Alice Nam 'll presented a bill cre
ating two consultant positions,
meant to assist student publications
in developing and learning their
publications' print layout and web
design strategies. The bill passed,
and applications will open soon for
the two paid positions.
Print design and web design
"were two things that were specific
to publications that weren't really
available anywhere else," Nam
said.
"We wanted to make sure that
especially new groups that have the
motivation have the resources to
learn print design and web design,"
she added.
Another major bill was the ap
pointment off Ogiemwanye as
chief of staff to Cruz and Vice Pres
ident Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3. Both Executives testified to
Ogiemwanye's commitment to the
position, saying they planned to
have daily meetings or calls with
her.
Other senators echoed the be
lief in Ogiemwanye's commitment.
"I came by the executive office
after last night's committee meet
ing and lo and behold they were
skyping Emma," said Senator
Daniel DeLong 'l3.
The Senate met some disagree
ment over the bill to form the Ad
Hoc Committee on the Governing

Documents of the Association,
meant to update and improve
ASSU documents. In the bill's list
of members, the Senate had trouble
deciding whether to allow the com
mittee to nominate additional, full
voting members, or to leave that
power to the Senate. The Senate
compromised by allowing the com
mittee to appoint ex officio mem
bers, while keeping the appoint
ment of voting power in the Senate.
The open forum brought a pres
entation from Keshav Rao 'l2
about a new social network called
Locra. Rao and two others are
building the site, locra.org, as a cen
tral place to find charitable oppor
tunities and track service participa
tion. Rao said the Haas Center for
Public Service had expressed much
early interest in the site as well.
The Senate was mostly im
pressed with the website, particu
larly in the resource it presents to
them as a Senate, Senator Alon El
hanan 'l4 noted that the Senate
could follow up with the site to en
sure that service groups receiving
ASSU funding were completing
their projects.
The Senate Appropriations
Committee agreed to meet with
Rao and other Locra leaders at a
later date.
The final bill approved at the
meeting appointed DeLong as in
ternal development chair for the
Senate, who will be in charge of so
cial events for senators.
The bill was presented as a no
tice for next meeting, but Elhanan
motioned to suspend the rules in
the interest of allocating any more
Senate time away from an internal
social affair.
