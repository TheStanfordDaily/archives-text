## ROCK ON, RICE CONDOLEEZZA RICE MAKES CAMEO ON NBC'S 30 ROCK 
### LAUREN WILSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The last two weeks have been good
to Condoleezza Rice. On the polit
ical front, there was Osama bin
Laden. Last week, after President
Obama announced the death of

the former al-Qaeda leader, Rice proudly
stepped back into the media spotlight, credit
ing the Bush administration her administra
tion for helping to lay the groundwork for
bin Laden's death.

Then there's the personal legacy. Two
weeks ago, Rice made a rare cameo appear
ance on NBC's comedy series "30 Rock,"
poking fun at herself as the spurned lover of
high-powered GE executive Jack Donaghy
(Alec Baldwin).
Rice's torrid love affair with Jack sur
faced in the season one episode "The
Break Up" when Jack coyly mentioned his
relationship with a "high-ranking African
American member of the Bush administra
tion." But with barely a vague suggestion of
phone sex and a handsome attache, the re
lationship ended thanks to Jack's jealous
suspicions of Condi's flirty relationship
with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin.
The real-life Rice described how she was
slightly caught off-guard to hear about her
secret sitcom lover.
"Yeah I was a little surprised," Rice said.
"I thought it was a kind of funny, funny sto
ryline."
Rice, who admits to being an infrequent
viewer of "30 Rock," reassured us that Jack
had nothing to worry about.
"He didn't have to worry about that,
ok?" she laughed.
In its five seasons, "30 Rock" has carved
a niche for itself in the primetime market
with its eccentric antics and wacky story
lines (check Liz Lemon's recent comeup
pance by a plastic bag). It has also taken its
fair share of playful jabs at the Bush admin
istration at one point, Jack leaves GE to
go work for the federal government only to
discover the White House in total shambles,

replete with leaky ceilings and nary a work
ing pen in sight.
So a silly, fabricated romance between
the two powerful figures seemed like a nat
ural extension of the show's characteristic
zaniness. Condi isn't Jack Donaghy's only
high-profile lover the long list also in
cludes Martha Stewart and shower-buddy
Greta Van Susteren.
The former Secretary of State first heard
about her alleged paramour through an old
co-worker.
"She had seen this storyline develop
about Alec Baldwin and me and she said
'Gee wouldn't it be fun if you did a cameo
about it'," Rice said. "I said sure, sure, sure
and somebody who represents me got in
touch with them."
Rice frequently fields offers for these
kinds of appearances, including a chance to
compete on "Dancing with the Stars" which
she refused.
"That's maximum embarrassment to be
on 'Dancing with the Stars,' but [3O Rock]
kind of appealed to me because it's kind of a
quirky show," she said. "And I like Alec
Baldwin and I love Tina Fey."
Neither party initially put much effort
into pursuing the appearance, so the idea
languished for a year.
"Then out of the blue, they came back
and said, 'Gee we'd really like to do it next
week or something'," Rice said. "It was one
of those things where it was really very close
in time."
To prepare, Rice ran lines with one of her
co-workers, a former child actress, before

jetting off to New York the week of March
16 to film. The appearance aired in the April
28 episode "Everything Sunny All the
Time."
In the episode. Jack's current wife Avery
Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) is detained in
North Korea by a pop culture-obsessed,
megalomaniacal Kim Jong-Il (Margaret
Cho). Desperate to bring Avery home, Jack
has no choice but to come groveling to his
bitter ex-girlfriend for help. But be
fore Condi agrees to help him, she chal
lenges Jack to a piano/flute-off. A profes
sional flutist came in to teach Baldwin how
to hold the instrument properly. Rice, on the
other hand, is a famously accomplished pi
anist and picked out the pieces played on
the show herself. Condi eventually trumps
Jack on the third and final song, an excerpt
of Mozart's D Minor Concerto.
"That one would be impossible for the
flute to play," Rice said. "I wasn't trying to
be fair. I was trying to get revenge, right?"
During the scene, Jack apologizes for
breaking up with Condi via text message
("Me + U = :(").
"Well I thought, my goodness, how could
you do that and I mean to go out with Karl
Rove on Valentine's Day? My goodness,"
Rice joked.
Despite his character's conservative
leanings, Alec Baldwin is notorious for his
liberal activism, most famously lampooned
in "Team America: World Police" as the
head of Hollywood's activist, liberal crowd.
However, the two set aside their political
differences during the taping.

"He made me feel very relaxed because I
[hadn't] had time to memorize lines," Rice
said. "And he said, 'Nobody remembers
lines. We just make it up.' He was really
great."
As for "30 Rock's" own lampooning of
the Bush administration, Rice has no beef.
"Everybody pokes fun at each other,"
Rice said. "That's the nice thing about
American politics. If you can't laugh togeth
er then you've lost something really impor
tant."
"It's nice to see professors not taking
themselves too seriously," said Anissa Chi
tour 'l3. "It did make me laugh, but it didn't
change my opinion of her as a politician or
professor."
However, Rice has no plans to continue
her acting career nor does she think there's
a future for Jack and Condi.
"No I think they're done. Big split's
over," she said.
And although the Osama bin Laden as
sassination eclipsed her appearance the fol
lowing week, Rice certainly is not disap
pointed.
"It's a real victory for American patience
and persistence," Rice said. "It took us al
most 10 years, but it shows you can't escape
America's long reach. I think this is a victo
ry across presidents and I think that's a good
thing."
"I think Jack would have liked it," she
added.
