## On the burner: Bacon's Six Degrees Actor promotes social media as a force for social change 
### SUZANNE STATHATOS 
It was just late last month that
producers released the new X-Men:
First Class international trailer. But
yesterday, Paul Brest Hall was filled
with students and faculty eagerly
awaiting the appearance of the up
coming film's "Sebastian Shaw."
Fulfilling expectations, Footloose,
Apollo 13 and Animal House star
Kevin Bacon took his place in the
cluster of burgundy leather chairs
on stage.
Ideas of social media and social
change came together on May 11 as
Jennifer Aaker, Stanford GSB pro
fessor and author of The Dragonfly
Effect, Bill Strathmann, CEO of
Network for Good, and Bacon
spoke about the evolving, interac
tive form of social good social
networking.
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice helped sponsor this event be
cause of the One Degree service
challenge associated with the talk, a
contest Six Degrees created for
Stanford students to propose chari
table ideas involving social media.
"The challenge that preceded it
gets students thinking differently
about public service and about how
social networking can be used for
the common good," said Thomas J.
Schnaubelt, assistant vice provost
and executive director of Haas.
Aaker admitted her initial skep
ticism of social media. In 2008, she
attributed social media to three
things narcissism, stalking and
lack of concentration.

But everything changed over a
summer at UC-Berkeley. Some of
her students showed her a Power-
Point on the impact of social media
and its effect on two men's lives.The
men, Sameer Bhatia and Vinay
Chakravarthy, harnessed social
media to register over 20,000 South
Asian bone marrow donors for
cures over the course of only a few
weeks.

Bhatia and Chakravarthy had a
four-point mantra "focus on a
single goal, grab attention, tell a
story and enable others to act."
"After listening to this, all I could
think about was, 'What could I do
now?"'Aaker recalled.

Aaker now works closely with
Stanford students on social media
and the 100K Cheeks Campaign.
"The goal of the organization is
to utilize some principles of The
Dragonfly Effect and to create tools
to allow other people to take ac

tion," said Vineet Singal 'l2, a mem
ber of 100K Cheeks.
The focus then moved to Bacon
as he described what motivated him
to start Six Degrees.
"I was at a point in my life where
I was feeling as though I was doing
little things here and there, and I
could keep doing little things,"
Bacon said. "But I felt like I wanted
to make a difference."
Bacon expected "Six Degrees," a
trivia game based on his celebrity
social web, to eventually fade out.
"I thought it was going to go
away; I thought it was a joke at my
expense," he said. "It didn't go
away."
So, Bacon embraced his brand,
but he wanted to take himself out of
the equation. He asked celebrities to
choose charities to write about on his
website. However, he realized that
celebrity faces alone aren't enough
to convince people to donate.
"Most people get connected to
causes through the people they real
ly have a connection with," he said.
Schnaubelt recognized the po
tential of social media, but pointed
out some of its imperfections.
"We need to recognize that this
tool also has limitations," he said.
"Social media relationships aren't a
replacement for real relationships.
People didn't go to Tahrir Square
just because somebody tweeted
them. They likely went because
someone they really knew tweeted
them."
"The same thing will likely be
true of using social media with any
form of public service," Schnaubelt
added.
When asked if social media
might have a negative impact on so
cial activism, Bacon replied, "It's
here. It's not going away. So why not
see if it's a tool for good?"
Aaker echoed Bacon, describing
any dichotomy between social and
"traditional media" as a thing of the
past.
"Anyone who's doing any mar
keting, any branding, any social ac
tivism, they're thinking how they're
here right now and how social
media complements groundbreak
ing acts," she said.
Strathmann recognized that so
cial media groups for social change
do have the potential to fail, which
he said can occur when groups don't
provide "a very clear and simple ac
tion" or when "actions are too com
plicated."
After fielding questions from the
audience, the panel introduced the
three finalists of Bacon's One De
gree challenge.
The three finalists Net Effect,
Billionaire Effect and Dispatch and
Response each gave presenta

tions on their ideas.
"I think all three ideas are ab
solutely remarkable," Bacon said,
announcing Billionaire Effect as
the final winner. "There are aspects
of all of them that could be used."

The talk closed fittingly with
Aaker describing how to realize
change.

"Most revolutions are sparked
by the actions of a few ordinary
people, and your biggest mind is a
clear mind and a very large idea,"
she said.

Aaker echoed Bacon, describing
any dichotomy between social and
"traditional media" as a thing of the
past.
"Anyone who's doing any mar
keting, any branding, any social ac
tivism, they're thinking how they're
here right now and how social
media complements groundbreak
ing acts," she said.
Strathmann recognized that so
cial media groups for social change
do have the potential to fail, which
he said can occur when groups don't
provide "a very clear and simple ac
tion" or when "actions are too com
plicated."
After fielding questions from the
audience, the panel introduced the
three finalists of Bacon's One De
gree challenge.
The three finalists Net Effect,
Billionaire Effect and Dispatch and
Response each gave presenta

tions on their ideas.
"I think all three ideas are ab
solutely remarkable," Bacon said,
announcing Billionaire Effect as
the final winner. "There are aspects
of all of them that could be used."

The talk closed fittingly with
Aaker describing how to realize
change.

"Most revolutions are sparked
by the actions of a few ordinary
people, and your biggest mind is a
clear mind and a very large idea,"
she said.

On Wed, May 11, at Paul Best Hall, Kevin Bacon talked to students about the social good of social media.
GSB professor Jennifer Aakerand Network for Good CEO Bill Strathmann joined Bacon forthe discussion and
the announcement of the One Degree challenge winner.
It was just late last month that
producers released the new X-Men:
First Class international trailer. But
yesterday, Paul Brest Hall was filled
with students and faculty eagerly
awaiting the appearance of the up
coming film's "Sebastian Shaw."
Fulfilling expectations, Footloose,
Apollo 13 and Animal House star
Kevin Bacon took his place in the
cluster of burgundy leather chairs
on stage.
Ideas of social media and social
change came together on May 11 as
Jennifer Aaker, Stanford GSB pro
fessor and author of The Dragonfly
Effect, Bill Strathmann, CEO of
Network for Good, and Bacon
spoke about the evolving, interac
tive form of social good social
networking.
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice helped sponsor this event be
cause of the One Degree service
challenge associated with the talk, a
contest Six Degrees created for
Stanford students to propose chari
table ideas involving social media.
"The challenge that preceded it
gets students thinking differently
about public service and about how
social networking can be used for
the common good," said Thomas J.
Schnaubelt, assistant vice provost
and executive director of Haas.
Aaker admitted her initial skep
ticism of social media. In 2008, she
attributed social media to three
things narcissism, stalking and
lack of concentration.

But everything changed over a
summer at UC-Berkeley. Some of
her students showed her a Power-
Point on the impact of social media
and its effect on two men's lives.The
men, Sameer Bhatia and Vinay
Chakravarthy, harnessed social
media to register over 20,000 South
Asian bone marrow donors for
cures over the course of only a few
weeks.

Bhatia and Chakravarthy had a
four-point mantra "focus on a
single goal, grab attention, tell a
story and enable others to act."
"After listening to this, all I could
think about was, 'What could I do
now?"'Aaker recalled.

Aaker now works closely with
Stanford students on social media
and the 100K Cheeks Campaign.
"The goal of the organization is
to utilize some principles of The
Dragonfly Effect and to create tools
to allow other people to take ac

tion," said Vineet Singal 'l2, a mem
ber of 100K Cheeks.
The focus then moved to Bacon
as he described what motivated him
to start Six Degrees.
"I was at a point in my life where
I was feeling as though I was doing
little things here and there, and I
could keep doing little things,"
Bacon said. "But I felt like I wanted
to make a difference."
Bacon expected "Six Degrees," a
trivia game based on his celebrity
social web, to eventually fade out.
"I thought it was going to go
away; I thought it was a joke at my
expense," he said. "It didn't go
away."
So, Bacon embraced his brand,
but he wanted to take himself out of
the equation. He asked celebrities to
choose charities to write about on his
website. However, he realized that
celebrity faces alone aren't enough
to convince people to donate.
"Most people get connected to
causes through the people they real
ly have a connection with," he said.
Schnaubelt recognized the po
tential of social media, but pointed
out some of its imperfections.
"We need to recognize that this
tool also has limitations," he said.
"Social media relationships aren't a
replacement for real relationships.
People didn't go to Tahrir Square
just because somebody tweeted
them. They likely went because
someone they really knew tweeted
them."
"The same thing will likely be
true of using social media with any
form of public service," Schnaubelt
added.
When asked if social media
might have a negative impact on so
cial activism, Bacon replied, "It's
here. It's not going away. So why not
see if it's a tool for good?"
Aaker echoed Bacon, describing
any dichotomy between social and
"traditional media" as a thing of the
past.
"Anyone who's doing any mar
keting, any branding, any social ac
tivism, they're thinking how they're
here right now and how social
media complements groundbreak
ing acts," she said.
Strathmann recognized that so
cial media groups for social change
do have the potential to fail, which
he said can occur when groups don't
provide "a very clear and simple ac
tion" or when "actions are too com
plicated."
After fielding questions from the
audience, the panel introduced the

gree challenge.
