## SEEING GREEN Going Topless 
### Holly Moeller 
I don't care how long (or short) of a
time you've spent lounging in the
Stanford bubble. If you haven't
popped out yet to see a sea otter, I
have an assignment for you: Drop
everything and get to the coast.
Charismatic fur balls await.
Today, sea otters are the poster
children of cuddle appeal, but their
endearing behaviors were lost on the
fur hunters of the 1800s. Otter fur
lined jackets (and the fur trade lined
pockets), but soon otters no longer
lined the Pacific Coast.
The sea otter, however, is a "key
stone species" its impact on our
coastal ecosystems is disproportion
ately large compared to its natural
abundance in the marine community
so its removal had profound effects
that we only noticed recently, as the
otter staged a dramatic return over
the last 70 years.
Otters like shellfish. So much so
that where otters live, abalone and sea
urchins are rare. Urchins eat kelp, so
once otters devour the urchins, kelp
grows in abundance. That's good news
from a restoration perspective: the re
turn of the otter has also meant the re
turn of kelp forests, historically "more
natural" than rocky urchin barrens.
And it makes the seaweed industry
happy (kelp products turn up in ice
cream and toothpaste, among other
things). But plenty of fishermen find
the change less palatable: the (now de
funct) abalone industry, for example,
arose largely because the loss of otters
led to a population explosion in the
snails. In the sea otter's absence, we
humans partially assumed the role of
top predator, a role we're hesitant to
relinquish.
Although the otter drama has died
down, other predator comebacks re
main controversial. Wolves, which ex
erted top-down controls on herbivore
populations all across the northern
portion of our continent, are slowly
(under the stewardship of biologists
and conservationists) regaining their
ecological foothold in places like Yel
lowstone National Park. Where once
an ecosystem was falling apart at the
seams (overgrazing by elk decimated
forests, leading to a lack of proper
dam-building materials and many un
happy beavers; shifting vegetation
changed the face of the park and its
complement of animal species),
wolves have almost magically stabi
lized it. For biologists observing the
system, the reintroduction of wolves
must have been like finding the miss
ing key and unlocking a treasure trove.
Of course, most of the nearby
ranchers would rather the key had
been permanently lost. Their treas
ures are their herds, and wolves are
often blamed for any loss of stock. I,
for one, am glad the wolves are back to
playing their native role and hop
ing they extend their range East, to
control a deer population explosion
that's decimating my childhood
forests. Hiking past the leafless stalks
of what should be the next generation
of trees, I'm frequently willing to
shoot Bambi myself.
The dramatic and complex effects
stemming from the loss of top preda
tors (and the reversals associated with
their return) is not unique to these sys
tems. Such "trophic cascades"
("trophic" for food chain, "cascade"
for the direct and indirect ripples
spreading downward through the sys
tem) have been found around the
world. As we continue to monitor the
accidental experiments created by
human impacts, we'll doubtless find
many more examples.
Will this knowledge help us predict
the effects of future species losses?
Probably not. Ecology is a com
plex science, and its overriding conclu
sion is that, well, "it's complicated." In

some cases, apex predators and their
top-down cascading effects rule the
system. In other situations, though, the
controls are bottom-up, and the com
munity is limited by nutrients, the rate
of plant growth or some other funda
mental factor. And, because we're
seeing all these systems as snapshots
(often heavily impacted by human ac
tivity),it's hard to guess where the real
balance between these two regimes
lies.
One thing is clear, though. We are
an inextricable part of the system. Of
course, we always have been. But be
fore we learned to use oil for cheap
energy, before we domesticated crops
and settled onto farms, before we or
ganized ourselves into hunter-gather
er clans, our own cascades were much
smaller.
Today, though, we are the keystone
species. Our top-down effects cascade
through the system when we fish out
top predators like sharks or when we
shoot the one mountain lion found
roaming in Redwood City. Our bot
tom-up effects transform ecosystem
processes when we add fertilizers or
pollute landscapes.
Our ability to modify the world has
evolved faster than the world's ability
to deal with our modifications. Of
course, there's a growing feeling that
we should try to limit these modifica
tions not least because they're put
ting our future existence on this plan
et in serious jeopardy.
In a few pet systems, especially
here in America, we entertain dreams
of systems "restored" to the way they
"must have looked" before us. But un
less our population shrinks dramati
cally, it will be very hard to avoid
pressing all of our accessible land area
and most of our coastal waters
into direct human service.
So perhaps the real moral from the
story of the otter, or of the wolf is to
impose our will with impunity, under
standing that ecosystem cascades, like
true waterfalls, are incredibly power
ful, sometimes beautiful and often im
possible to control.
