# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## Apparently, Oxford Is a Good School 
### Shane Savitsky 
Everybody lied to me, guys. For
years, I had heard about how
going abroad was supposed to
be an easy GPA boost, no work and
partying every night. Problem is, I'm
here in Oxford and I've probably
done more work in four weeks than a
usual quarter back on the Farm. A
wise, wise man once wrote, "Nobody
said it was easy, no one ever said it
would be this hard." I think that cer
tainly holds true in this case.
Between all of my commitments,
I'm supposed to write 3,000 words
every week. If you think that 3,000
words doesn't sound too bad, try to
fill up 15 pages in Microsoft Word
every week while reading two or
three books and trying to travel a lit
tle bit on the weekends. It's kind of
nuts. I almost forgot that I had to
write a column this week because of
my pressing academic work but
don't fear: I'm still here. I think the
biggest slap in the face is that I'm only
getting 13 units from this quarter. Se
riously? Somehow, Stanford deems a
tutorial that requires you to write
2,500 words a week as only worthy of
six units. Honestly, the writing I'll do
for my tutorial alone probably equals
the amount of writing I'd do in a full
quarter at Stanford.
Oh, and then, the worst is that I
have to hear about all of my friends in
other Bing programs who are doing
almost zero work. Somehow writing
a story in Spanish is equal to my 12
pages on why the English school of

international relations differs from
constructivism. Some of my friends
are actually taking more units than I
am and going out six nights a week!
So all of you who are in Madrid or
Paris or Berlin, live it up while you
can.
I'm writing 3,000 words a week.
I'm being run academically ragged.
My average bedtime has probably
shifted toward 4 a.m., and I pull an
average of one all-nighter a week.
But here's the weird thing: I love it. I
don't think I've ever felt more aca
demically stimulated in my life. I'm
obviously partial to the American
way of teaching, but the tutorial sys
tem is an absolutely brilliant inven
tion.There have of course been times
back at Stanford where I would blow
off my reading and have to bullshit
my way through section, but there's
no possible way of doing that in a tu
torial here. (Note to self: ask Oxford
students if bullshitting a tutorial
paper is actually possible.) You're ac
tually forced to sit down, read a few
books, formulate a worthwhile argu
ment and then defend it in a one-on
one setting. Furthermore, I'm study
ing the exact topic I wanted to focus
on: post-Cold War international rela
tions. My tutorial is nothing more and
nothing less. It's unlike anything I've
ever done before and it's incredibly
refreshing.
There's also a certain amount of
camaraderie here in the Oxford pro
gram inherent with so much work

being constantly due. When every
one around you is in the same boat of
being absolutely overwhelmed with
work, you learn to develop sympathy
for others and make friends pretty
quickly.

Honestly, I think certain classes
back at Stanford could benefit a lot
from a system like this. I feel like I've
learned more about international re
lations in two weeks than I did in an
entire quarter of Political Science 1.
For the record, that's not a condem
nation or disparagement of our
teaching resources or classes back at
Stanford. Rather, it's simply a prod
uct of a completely new learning ex
perience in an almost surreal envi
ronment. The academic component
here has just been fantastic.
So again, all of you previously
mentioned Bing folks spread around
Europe, enjoy your wild nights while
they last. I'm sure papers are going to
terrify you when you finally get back
to campus in the fall. While you have
a questionably-fueled night at a rave
in the Marais, I'm forced to deal with
a Red Bull-fueled night in Magdalen
College Library to write about dem
ocratic peace theory. (And here's the
best part: I still get to party too!)
Honestly, I wouldn't have it any other
way.

You can email Shane at savitsky@stan
ford.edu, but any response would in
crease his weekly word count. Do you
really want to do that to him?

Somehow writing a
story in Spanish is
equal to my 12 pages
on why the English
school of international
relations differs from
constructivism.
