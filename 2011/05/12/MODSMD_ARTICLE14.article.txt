## My Father's Stanford 
### RENEE DONOVAN, '14 
The class of '7B wore white armbands
against their black graduation robes to
protest apartheid in South Africa.
Tuesday, the Students Confronting
Apartheid by Israel (SCAI) implored Stan
ford to divest from companies profiting from
Israeli military occupation of Palestinian
land. I didn't see any armbands, and it wasn't
the SCAI's fault. It's that when you walk up
to most Stanford students and try to interest
them in divestment, more often than not they
could care less.
Stanford University: a school dedicated to
the blowing winds of freedom, strewn with
anguished Rodin sculptures and smiling
tourists; my question: when did the tourists re
place the hippies? You can do anything here,
create the next six-figure iPhone app, make a
start-up your sophomore year, everything ex
cept go to class, toss a ball and linger at dinner
with your classmates. Forget the Farm, this
place is the Lab. Students are fed opportunity
with 10 silver spoons, and the options over

whelm them. Instead of sitting with the feel
ing of not knowing what it is they want to do
with their lives, students take off in all 10 di
rections at once. Some don't have time for
class. Most don't have time to run around and
toss a ball, and none have time to stay at din
ner any longer than it takes them to shovel
down their food.
My father's Stanford was about sitting on
the grass and shooting the breeze. Playing Ul
timate barefoot on Roble Field. My Stanford
shoots emails, texts, anything to increase effi
ciency and decrease face-time. My Stanford
needs Frisbee cleats. Where are the artists?
The hippies? The movers and shakers?
The irony is, my father's movers and shak
ers were the same privileged kids as the stu
dents I'm charging with complacency. And
maybe they weren't all that different from the
assholes down the hall in my freshman dorm.
Maybe my dad was the asshole down the hall.
But for all their privilege and cluelessness and
self-interest, they didn't have the option to in

dulge short attention spans with Facebook
profiles or iPhone screens. They too were fed
by silver spoons, just not as many. If there is
any instance where less is more, I argue it is
the number of silver spoons jabbing at a stu
dent's mouth to grab her attention.
I know my diamond shoes are too
tight; I have access to all those spoons, and in
stead of taking advantage of Stanford, I com
plain,"No one here wants to sit in the sun and
pretend to know about politics with me!" I
assure you I would not write this if I didn't
believe something vital to the health of my
student body were at stake. When students
are spread so thin between being Olympians
and entrepreneurs, many miss the whole
point of attending college. They get jaded, or
close-minded or lonely. I miss the point a
good deal of the time; I'm too busy to care
about divestment, or the Dalai Lama's visit
to campus or the girl upstairs who needs
someone to talk to.
It feels like a terrible waste of privilege to

be at Stanford and feel jaded. I want to care
passionately about divestment, and I don't
think that joining one more politically correct
club is the solution. Call me a romantic, but I
have a hunch the solution starts with sitting
on the grass and shooting the breeze. After
all, how am I going to care passionately about
people harmed by Israeli settlements if I'm
too busy to care about the people around me?
This is an invitation to my generation to take
the time with me to learn how to care about
people again. Take a break from your honors
theses, your coding, your weightlifting, and
look me in the eye and talk to me. Let's strum
the same three chords on guitar for an hour
and sing our hearts out. Let's get sidetracked
together, and let the long-term goals go for a
moment. We're still young —let's act like it.
We can't go back to 1978, but maybe we can
slow down 2011 until we get our priorities
straight.
