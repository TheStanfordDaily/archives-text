## WEST COAST FEEL Cardinal and three MPSF foes dive into NCAAs 
### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's water polo team travels to
the National Collegiate Champi
onship in Ann Arbor this weekend
with a couple of lofty goals: a success
ful tournament would give the Cardi
nal its first national championship
since 2002 and earn a 101 st team title
for Stanford athletics as a whole.
After Stanford earned a third
place finish with a 2-1 record in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation

(MPSF) tournament, the Cardinal
(25-1) heads into the NCAA Tourna
ment via an at-large bid. Even after
the third-place finish, the squad will
have the number-one seed in the
eight-team tournament.
Three of Stanford's MPSF rivals
will be traveling to the NCAA Tour
nament as well: CaI,USC and UCLA
all got the call to Ann Arbor. The
other four teams are automatic qual
ifiers that won their respective con
ferences: UC-Irvine from the Big
West Conference, Indiana from the
Collegiate Water Polo Association,

UC-San Diego from the Western
Water Polo Association and lona
College from the Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference.
Other than the one blemish at the
MPSF Tournament, Stanford has
demonstrated its prowess in tourna
ments, with undefeated records at the
Michigan Kickoff, Stanford Invita
tional and UC-Irvine Invitational.
"We've been a good tournament
team because we play a lot of people
and keep attacking teams," said Stan
ford head coach John Tanner. "This
weekend we will continue to use our

bench and push for goals in all phas
es of offense."
The one tournament blemish
came in a game against UCLA that
Stanford lost 9-8, ending the Cardi
nal's 24-game winning streak.
"We had several lapses against
UCLA, particularly in the middle of
the game, where we went significant
periods without generating big stops
or finishing quality chances," Tanner
said.
Stanford will continue to lean on

Sophomore Jillian Garton (above) and the Stanford water polo team travel to Michigan this weekend for the NCAA championships. The
Cardinal is one of four Mountain Pacific Sports Federation teams to make it to Michigan. Stanford starts against lona College on Friday.
its depth and offensive talent in the
NCAA Tournament the Cardinal
has played at least thirteen players in
each game this season and boasts five
players that have tallied over 30 goals
this season.
Two-meter players sophomore
Annika Dries and junior Melissa Sei
demann have led the Cardinal offen
sively. Dries, who was named MPSF
Player of the Year, leads the team with
58 goals and Seidemann is second
with 44. On the perimeter, junior driv
er Alyssa Lo is third on the team with
38 goals.
In the cage, Stanford has benefited
from the combined play of senior
goalie Amber Oland and sophomore
goalie Kate Baldoni. As a team, the
Cardinal is first in the MPSF, letting
up just 4.73 goals per game.
That goals-against average is par
ticularly impressive as the tourna
ment looms, especially considering
that the tournament's top four seeds
are all familiar foes from Stanford's

conference.
Tanner said that, for the most part,
the squad will know exactly what to
expect, as it has faced each team in the
NCAA Tournament besides UC-San
Diego and lona.
"At this point in the season there
aren't any significant secrets in terms
of players or teams among the four
MPSF schools," Tanner said. "We
don't know much about lona, but
they will have their hands full with
us."
Stanford will face lona College at 3:00
p.m. in Ann Arbor on Friday, May 13.
They will face either USC or UC-
Irvine on Saturday, May 14.
