# Teams need a nuisance
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
That guy is so annoying.
It's not something you
want to hear about your
self at a frat party, but it
might be the ultimate
sports compliment from an oppo
nent.
While watching the Mavericks-
Lakers series, my friend uttered that
phrase in regard to J.J. Barea. And
while my friend is no more a Lakers
fan than Paul Pierce, his conclusion
was fairly obvious to anyone watch
ing that series.
Barea all 75 pounds of him (if
he's actually six feet tall, I'm Yao
Ming) got under the skin of every
player on the Lakers. His nagging de
fense, exaggerated flops and surpris
ing offensive bursts were big reasons
why the Lakers went from two-time
champions to embarrassing under
achievers in the span of one round.
The 11.5 points and 5.5 assists he av
eraged over the course of the four
games certainly played a big role, but
the little things the annoyances, if
you will may have done even more
to derail the Lakers' quest for anoth
er three-peat.
Take Ron Artest in Game 2. While
Artest might have the shortest fuse in
the league, Barea did just enough to
light it, causing Artest to commit one
of the silliest flagrant fouls you will
ever see (it was halfway between
clotheslining the Rock and ripping
the mask off a Scooby Doo villain).
That got Artest banned for a game,
which might have been the difference
between Dallas going for the sweep
in Game 4 and the Lakers attempting
to tie the series.
Just two games later, after Barea's
best game as a pro helped the Maver-

icks build an insurmountable lead
(he had never dropped 22 and eight
in the regular season, let alone the
playoffs), the frustration escalated
for the Lakers. Lamar Odom got
ejected for trying to turn Dirk Now
itzki into Sean Cattouse (he wasn't as
successful though yet another
professional player that needs train
ing from Andrew Luck). Only a few
minutes later, Andrew Bynum took
things to another level, decking
Barea with the cheapest of cheap
shots, a blatant elbow to the midsec
tion while Barea was off the ground
and defenseless.
By that point, the game and series
were in the books, so the only casual
ties for the Lakers were Bynum's
first five games of next season and
the league-wide respect for the Lak
ers franchise. The actions, though,
speak to the serious frustration the
Lakers felt, and that was in no small
part due to Barea.
So what can you make of a guy
who pisses off hrs opponents to no
end? Personally, I love it. Sports are all
about finding that edge, the one thing
that's going to put you or your team
over the top. And while the answer for
Marshawn Lynch is beast mode,
many players take it upon themselves
to make their opponents lose their
focus or confidence, and that is often
even better than just being good.
Staying in the NBA, let me just
throw out some names. Zaza Pachu
lia. Anderson Varejao. Joakim Noah.
If you're an NBA fan at all, you prob
ably groaned at least once while
reading those names. Why? Because,
despite being fairly unskilled in most
normal aspects of the game (like
shooting the ball), all three manage
to maintain successful NBA careers
by annoying the hell out of their op
ponents. No one enjoys playing
against these guys. Whether it's goad
ing your players into getting ejected,
flopping or just being plain ugly in all
aspects of the game, these guys bring
out the worst in their opponents.
Do I like any of these guys? Of
course not. I don't think you could
root for any of these players unless
you're a fan of their team. But as irri
tating as they are to play against, you
have to appreciate what they bring to
a team.
A guy like Barea is never going to
carry a team to a championship, and
he certainly shouldn't be calling out
his next opponent. But if you want
someone to give you that little boost,
that one spark to lead your team to a
title, just think of your least favorite
players to play against.

Jacob Jaffe does like J.J. Redick, Bruce
Bowen and Paul Pierce's wheelchair,
though. Tell him your favorite players
