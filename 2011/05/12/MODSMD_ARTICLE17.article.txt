### REBECCA HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two weeks after taking the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
title, Stanford lacrosse will travel to
Gainesville, Fla., to take on the
Florida Gators in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament. The trip to
Gainesville will mark Cardinal's
second consecutive year in the
NCAA Tournament and just its
third appearance in history.

The two will match up for the
first time ever, with the Gators
starting a lacrosse program just one
year ago. The Cardinal and Gators
have five opponents in common this
season, including Denver, North
western, Ohio State, Syracuse and
Vanderbilt. The Cardinal (16-2, 6-0
MPSF) compiled a 3-2 record
against those opponents, falling to
Vanderbilt and losing a one-goal

the second consecutive yearthatthe Card has qualified for the postseason.
game to Northwestern.
Florida (15-3, 5-1 American
Lacrosse Conference), which
played several of those common
opponents multiple times, grabbed
a 6-1 record against those teams,
losing only to Northwestern in the
ALC Championship game.
Although Stanford has won
seven consecutive MPSF titles, the

Cardinal is 0-2 in the NCAA Tour
nament. Stanford lost to North
western in the 2006 tournament,
and it fell to James Madison in 2010.
Last year was the first time that the
MPSF champion had a play-in
game to the tournament, and Stan
ford matched up against Massachu
setts to get a bid into NCAAs.
There's a lot of pressure on the
team this year going into the tour
nament besides having the title
up for grabs, the Cardinal's success
could help to prove that West Coast
lacrosse is a force to be reckoned
with.

"Florida is definitely going to be
a challenging team, but we are more
experienced and we are ready to
make our mark in the NCAA Tour
nament and show that the West
Coast knows how to play lacrosse,"
said sophomore defender Eliza
beth Adam.
Stanford's first-round matchup
is set for Saturday, May 14 in
Gainesville. The winner will then
face either Pennsylvania or Duke
on May 21 or May 22.
