Two weeks after taking the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
title, Stanford lacrosse will travel to
Gainesville, Fla., to take on the
Florida Gators in the first round of
the NCAA Tournament. The trip to
Gainesville will mark Cardinal's
second consecutive year in the
NCAA Tournament and just its
third appearance in history.

The two will match up for the
first time ever, with the Gators
starting a lacrosse program just one
year ago. The Cardinal and Gators
have five opponents in common this
season, including Denver, North
western, Ohio State, Syracuse and
Vanderbilt. The Cardinal (16-2, 6-0
MPSF) compiled a 3-2 record
against those opponents, falling to
Vanderbilt and losing a one-goal
