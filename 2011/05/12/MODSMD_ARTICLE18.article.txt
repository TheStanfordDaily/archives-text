# CARDINAL CHATTER
## YOU NEED A NICKNAME, KID 
### DEAN MCARDLE SOPHOMORE PITCHER 
In baseball, perhaps more so than any other sport,
there's a lot of down time. With a 35-man roster and
ample time to think, nicknames are inevitable.
With the chattering in the dugout during games, the
nicknames become ingrained in the team and are a
vital part of keeping life in the dugout interesting.
They don't have to be funny, meaningful, or cre
ative, but most of them mix a little of each. Here's a lit
tle sample of some of the nicknames on our team:
• Sophomore first baseman Justin Ringo: Cave
Man
• Sophomore center fielder: Jake Stewart: Scoob-a
doob-doob, Stewie, Stewman.
• Freshman right fielder Austin Wilson: Big Willy,
Black Stealth.

• Senior outfielder Dave Giuliani: Italian Stallion,
Meatball.
• Senior catcher Zach Jones: McDopeboy.
• Freshman second baseman Lonnie Kauppila:
Kappi, Ron.
• Junior pitcher Allan Talt: Tall-T,Treeßeard.
• Junior outfielder Jack Mosbacher: Simple Jack, 16
to 24.
