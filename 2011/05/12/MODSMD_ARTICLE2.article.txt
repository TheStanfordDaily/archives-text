## Wilentz talks partisanship in America Scholar initiates lecture series with thoughts on politics, past and present 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
Sean Wilentz, a professor at Princeton Univer
sity, spoke yesterday to an audience of mostly
professors and members of the Stanford commu
nity.
The talk was the first of Wilentz's two events in
the 2011 Wesson Lecture Series, entitled "The
Long and Tragical History of Post-Partisanship."
It was endowed by Robert G. Wesson and spon
sored by the Center for Ethics and Society.
Wilentz explained that the pair of lectures is
related to contemporary politics, "but is actually
rooted in historical concerns." He noted that he
planned to focus on the first 100 years of Ameri
can history before "speeding" to the present.
"The lectures are much more like road maps
than they are like pieces of evaluation," Wilentz
said.
Wilentz discussed a divide between President
Barack Obama's post-partisanship rhetoric dur
ing his campaign and later Gallup polls showing
Obama as the most divisive president in his first
two years of office. He predicted that post-parti
sanship rhetoric would reappear in the 2012 pres
idential elections and might be used against
Obama.
He then proceeded to examine the develop
ment of early political parties in America. Wilentz
focused on George Washington's 1796 farewell
address, which he said provided the locus of anti
party thought. Wilentz believed the speech, which
has been "commonly viewed as an Olympian
statement," was in fact "deeply political" in re
gards to the Adams-Jefferson race for President.
Wilentz emphasized that the ideas on parti
sanship throughout American history are not all
the same, though there are "communal threads"
running through them. Most notable among
these threads is a "desire to see political conflict
replaced by high-minded collaboration."
Wilentz is a contributing editor to The New
Republic and Newsweek and has written approx
imately 300 articles, reviews and op-ed pieces for
publications such as The New York Times, The
Los Angeles Times and The New York Review of
Books. His major work to date, 2005's "The Rise
of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln,"
received the Bancroft Prize and was a finalist for
the Pulitzer Prize.
"It was an interesting talk on
areas of American history I knew
little about," said Kieran Ober
man, a postdoctoral scholar in po

litical science, who completed his
Ph.D. at Oxford University.
The second lecture in the series
is tonight from 5:30 to 7 p.m. in
Building 360, room 105. A discus
sion seminar is set to take place on
Friday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
