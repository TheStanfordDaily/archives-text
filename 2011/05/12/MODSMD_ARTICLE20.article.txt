# Softball closes Pac-10 schedule against Arizona State
## 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
After struggling against the
Oregon Ducks last weekend, the
Stanford Softball team faces a tall
task as it heads to the desert to
take on the Arizona State Sun
Devils in the last Pac-10 series of
the year.
No. 11 Stanford (37-13,9-9 Pac
-10) squares off against the No. 1
Sun Devils (48-5,15-3 Pac-10) in a
three game series starting Friday

night, and the Cardinal will need a
better offensive performance than
last weekend if it wants to overtake
the Devils this weekend.
Stanford scored just eight runs
all weekend and dropped two of
three to the Ducks, despite another
ridiculous weekend at the plate
from junior Ashley Hansen, who
went 9-for-15 with two doubles and
four RBI.
The Cardinal's only win of the
weekend was a 4-1 victory on Fri
day night behind a three-hit, one
run, 14-strikeout pitching per
formance from sophomore Tea
gan Gerhart, who extended her
record to 21-8 on the season with
the win.
The Sun Devils come in to the
weekend scorching hot, having
won their last 11 games, all against
Pac-10 opponents. The Devils are
led offensively by Katelyn Boyd
and Lacy Goodman, who both
have batting averages over .400.
As a team, Arizona State has
clobbered 67 home runs an av
erage of 1.26 long balls per game.
In contrast, the Cardinal has hit
just 41 home runs all season and no
Stanford player has double-digit
home runs so far this year. Arizona
State has three players with 10 or
more bombs.
Stanford and Arizona State
start a three-game series Friday
night in Tempe at 7 p.m.
