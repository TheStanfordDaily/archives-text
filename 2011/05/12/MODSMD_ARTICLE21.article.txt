# KZSU to retain all broadcast rights following KNBR deal
## 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
In a move that reaffirmed the
long-standing agreement between
Stanford Athletics and KZSU 90.1
FM, the student-run radio station
confirmed that it would retain its
coverage of Stanford men's bas
ketball and football games next
year. The station's broadcast rights
were unaffected by Monday's an
nouncement that Bay Area radio
station KNBR 1050 AM had ac
quired the broadcast rights to both
Cardinal football and men's bas
ketball.
KZSU Sports Director JD Had
don confirmed earlier reports
Wednesday that KZSU would con
tinue to broadcast both football
and men's basketball, in addition
to its exclusive broadcasts of
women's basketball and baseball
games.
"The verdict is that literally
nothing changes for KZSU," Had
don said. "It's the same contract,
just with a different provider."
He added that the switch from
XTRA Sports 860 to KNBR, which
also holds the rights to San Francis
co Giants, Golden State Warriors
and San Francisco 49ers games,
would only be a positive thing for
Stanford sports coverage.
