## Tentative plans call for concessions from local labor groups 
### MARIANNE LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto is in the midst of finalizing its
operating budget for fiscal year 2012. A se
ries of budget hearings by the Palo Alto
City Council and Finance Committee will
take place this month, including a special
meeting today at the council chambers.
The city plans to modify the existing
budget in several ways, with a primary focus
on concessions for safety labor groups. The
proposed budget would also adjust spend

the total city budget will be $463 million, a
3.2 percent increase from last year.

pension plans, similar to those that the non
safety staff changes already made," Perez
said. "We have a two-tier pension system

that reduces the benefits for non-safety
staff and, therefore, the cost to the city. In
addition, we seek employee contributions
to healthcare premiums."
According to Pamela Antil, assistant city
manager, a primary change is an increase in
concessions from labor groups in both the
police and fire departments.
"The largest portion of our general fund
dollars goes to pay the salaries and benefits
of our employees ... A critical component
of the city's ability to maintain quality serv

has been working with labor groups over
the last several years to achieve wage and
