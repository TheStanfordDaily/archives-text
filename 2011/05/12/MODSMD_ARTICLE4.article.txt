# City officials detail budget proposal
## Tentative plans call for concessions from local labor groups 
### MARIANNE LEVINE STAFF WRITER 
Palo Alto is in the midst of finalizing its
operating budget for fiscal year 2012. A se
ries of budget hearings by the Palo Alto
City Council and Finance Committee will
take place this month, including a special
meeting today at the council chambers.
The city plans to modify the existing
budget in several ways, with a primary focus
on concessions for safety labor groups. The
proposed budget would also adjust spend
ing to confront the effects of the recent eco
nomic recession.
In the FY 2012 operating budget pro
posal, City Manager James Keene reveals
that the combination of lower sales tax rev

enues and increasing costs for employee
benefits has forced the city council to re
evaluate the budget. The proposed general
fund budget is $146 million, which repre
sents a 2.7 percent increase from the FY
2011 budget. According to the document,
the total city budget will be $463 million, a
3.2 percent increase from last year.
In an email to The Daily, Director of Ad
ministrative Services Lalo Perez explained
that the budget changes are a response to
the costs of healthcare and pension plans,
which are increasing much faster than city
revenues.
"We need to make changes to our safety
pension plans, similar to those that the non
safety staff changes already made," Perez
said. "We have a two-tier pension system

that reduces the benefits for non-safety
staff and, therefore, the cost to the city. In
addition, we seek employee contributions
to healthcare premiums."
According to Pamela Antil, assistant city
manager, a primary change is an increase in
concessions from labor groups in both the
police and fire departments.
"The largest portion of our general fund
dollars goes to pay the salaries and benefits
of our employees ... A critical component
of the city's ability to maintain quality serv
ices for the community, in the face of declin
ing revenues and growing personnel costs,
has been working with labor groups over
the last several years to achieve wage and
benefit concessions," the budget
proposal reads.
"The proposed budget projects
that the city will receive about $4.3
million in concessions from the
labor groups in police and fire,"
Antil wrote in an email to The
Daily. "If those concessions are not
achieved, the budget staff will have
to come back to the city council for
consideration of other operating
and service cuts."
Antil said she was confident that
these concessions would be met.
According to Perez, if labor groups
are unable to meet these condi
tions, Palo Alto will be forced to im
plement reductions in its safety pro
grams first.
Apart from the concession
changes, Perez indicated that Palo

Alto plans to use a $1 million place
holder to create an Office of Emer
gency Services. Perez said staff
members are "working on the
specifics" of the new office. The
funds for this development "will in
clude staff and non-salary items as
sociated with community emer
gency preparedness, which is a
council priority," he said.
Perez emphasized that the im
pact of the proposed FY 2012 budg
et is contingent on whether or not
the labor groups agree to provide
the concessions. If the labor groups
do not act accordingly, cutting the
safety programs would be one of
few ways to balance the city's budg
et. The city may also need to make
budget reductions during the fiscal
midyear timeframe.
In addition to these points, the
proposed budget incorporates
plans to continue to improve Palo
Alto's infrastructure by renovating
libraries as well as increasing sus
tainable practices within the corn

munity. Furthermore, the proposal
outlines the city's intentions to con
tinuously upgrade its infrastructure
by proactively repairing and replac
ing utilities.
According to the tentative budg
et, the city intends to support Cal
train's efforts to develop a long
term financial plan. Another priori
ty is the promotion of programs fo
cusing on youth well being.
Antil expressed optimism about
the budget proposal.
"The main goal of the budget
continues to be to provide the
highest level of desired and en
hanced services to the community
within our means, while still being
mindful of changes that are immi
nent in the future with regard to
sustainability, infrastructure needs
and changes in technology and its
application to the services we pro
vide," Antil said.
