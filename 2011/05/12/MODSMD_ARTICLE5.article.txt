## Protest in White Plaza supports campus janitors Rally aims to pressure University, UGL services to save the jobs of 29 janitors 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ An Le Nguyen 
More than 20 protestors converged in White Plaza
Wednesday afternoon to rally on behalf of 29 janitors
who are set to lose their jobs this June. The Stanford
Labor Action Coalition organized the rally in protest
of UGL (UNICCO) Services, a services subcontrac
tor that jointly employs the janitors with Stanford
University.
Last December, the University's contract with UGL
Services, which replaced a preceding contract with
ABM, initiated a complex rehiring process. UGL Ser
vices was contractually obligated to offer all ABM
workers the opportunity to keep their jobs. However,
several of the workers did not meet background check
and identity verification criteria that were stipulated by
federal law, University officials said in January.
The issue has not yet been completely resolved.

tration to take action.
According to Eric Griffis 'l2, a
member of the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition, most of the janitors
have worked at Stanford University
for many years some for decades.
"Stanford continues to shirk re
sponsibility for this issue by claim
ing that only UGL determines hir
ing and firing even though UGL
would clearly respond to the needs
of its client, Stanford," Griffis wrote
in an email to The Daily.
In addition to yesterday's rally
one of several this year the Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition has dis
tributed flyers, enlisted the help of
other student activist groups and or
ganized worker-student council
meetings on the issue. Griffis said
the coalition also emailed workers in
other unions at Stanford and initiat
ed a petition on behalf of the jani
tors.
The petition alleges, "UNICCO
and Stanford are blatantly violating
the Northern California Maintenance
Contractors Agreement with Service
Employees International Union,
Local 1877, the union that represents
the workers." Thus far, it has accrued
more than 2,000 signatures.
