More than 20 protestors converged in White Plaza
Wednesday afternoon to rally on behalf of 29 janitors

Labor Action Coalition organized the rally in protest
of UGL (UNICCO) Services, a services subcontrac

and identity verification criteria that were stipulated by
federal law, University officials said in January.
The issue has not yet been completely resolved.
