# Report urges rethinking of high-speed-rail plan
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
The proposed high-speed-rail
system faces weak oversight and will
cost much more than initially antici
pated, according to a report released
by the state Legislative Analyst's Of
fice. The controversial project was
approved by voters in November
2008 but has since faced mounting
criticism and great financial uncer
tainty, especially in light of the ongo
ing state budget crisis.
Although the project was pro
jected to cost $43 billion, new esti
mates put the price tag at $63 billion,
with the segment between San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles slated to cost
much more than the initial proposal
had anticipated.
The report called for either shift
ing the project to the California De
partment of Transportation (Cal
trans), which has more expertise in
this field, or to a newly created state
department dedicated to the project.
Under the current system, the proj
ect is headed by the California High-
Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), a
group of nine appointed board
members, several paid staffers and
hundreds of consultants. This
arrangement, the report argued,
gives CHSRA too much autonomy
and not enough accountability to the
state government.
CHSRA was also sharply criti
cized for its "flawed business plan,"
and the report predicted that most of
the re venue that the agency hopes to
reap would fail to materialize. A
cited example was the agency's gam
ble that it would receive $l7 billion
to $l9 billion in federal funds so
far, only $3.6 billion has been grant
ed and the majority in the House of

Representatives has opposed any
further funding.
The report also recommended
that the state legislature reject the
rail authority's 2011-12 budget re
quest for $lB5 million to fund project
development and instead allocate
only $7 million to the agency. That
amount would be used to identify
the best two options to begin con
struction. Unless federal deadlines
are renegotiated and the project's
governance structure is revamped,
the report argued that the project
should be halted altogether.
