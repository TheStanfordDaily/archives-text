### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elizabeth Titus 
Silicon Valley business leaders
and Stanford humanities scholars
convened on Wednesday for Bib
lioTech, a conference looking to
strengthen ties between the two
groups as the nationwide discussion
about the relevance of the humani
ties and the value of a humanities
Ph.D. continues.
Speakers from Google, TED
Media, Sequoia Capital and other firms
came to campus to discuss how doctor
al students in humanities can con
tribute to the tech industry and how Sil
icon Valley can reap Stanford talent.
The conference came in "an era
where we can no longer make dis
tinctions between the humanities,
the sciences and the social sciences,"
said co-organizer Anais Saint-Jude, a
doctoral student studying 17th cen
tury French theater.
One keynote speaker, Marissa
Mayer '97 M.S. '99, discussed entry
points for humanities doctoral stu
dents in the Valley, including "social
media, marke ting, product design and
more." Mayer is the vice president for
consumer products at Google.

Stanford President John Hen
nessy, himself a former technology
entrepreneur who retains invest
ments in Silicon Valley and serves on
the boards of Cisco and Google, de
livered opening remarks on Wednes
day morning. In a statement, Hen
nessy called the conference
"groundbreaking."
Other speakers included Patrick
Byrne of Overstock.com, June
Cohen of TED Media, John Hagel
111 of Deloitte Center for Edge,
Damon Horowitz of Google,
Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital
and Vivek Ranadive of TIBCO.
Horowitz and Byrne hold doctorates
from Stanford.
The conference was sponsored by
a litany of groups within Stanford,
ranging from Hennessy's office to
the English department to the Ca
reer Development Center.
"The days when you can expect
to get a teaching position with a
Ph.D. are gone," said co-organizer
David Palumbo-Liu, a professor of
comparative literature, "Things are
far less certain than they used to be."
