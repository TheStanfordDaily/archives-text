## FacSen eyes curriculum changes Study on Undergraduate Education reports progress 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford (SUES) served
as the focal point of Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting. History profes
sor James Campbell 'B3 Ph.D. 'B9
and biology professor Susan Mc-
Connell, who jointly chair SUES,
delivered a presentation on the
shortcomings of the undergraduate
curriculum and general solutions to
these shortcomings.
Campbell noted that institutions
of higher learning have seen an in
crease in the rigor of their under
graduate majors specifically, an
"escalation of what we expect per
unit." This change in rigor is particu
larly "acute in the so-called STEM
fields" and "has been most acute at
Stanford," he said.

Undergraduate requirements
bring an added challenge by rein
forcing a culture of instrumentality
in which students strategically
choose classes to check off general
education requirements (GERs).
"Many students here simply game
the system" by basing their class se
lection on courses that count for
multiple GERs and "the likely per
centage of A's," Campbell said. De
tailed data on students' course selec
tions demonstrated "a very strong
culture of instrumentality," he
added.

Another danger in current Stan
ford trends is the foreclosing of op
portunities as students isolate them
selves in "silos" rather than explor
ing different areas of study.
According to Campbell, at the
crux of the SUES agenda is a push
to "reclaim a vision of liberal edu
cation." More specifically, SUES
maintains that the GERs should be
modified to introduce students to a
wide array of areas in the humani
ties, social sciences, natural sci
ences, applied sciences and tech
nology. This aim goes hand in hand
with an underlying commitment to
cultivate students who are respon
sible and well-informed members
of society, according to the SUES
co-chairs.

Under the current GER system,
undergraduates must complete a
three-part Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) series, a two-part
Program Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) series, five Disciplinary
Breadth courses, two Education for
Citizenship courses, one Writing in
the Major (WIM) course and a for
eign language component.
But one of the problems with this
system, the co-chairs argued, is a
front-loading of GER require
ments. Many of these requirements
are completed freshman year. This
frontloading can be especially detri
mental to the humanities, since
some students view humanities
GERs as "something you need to
get through" before proceeding to
"real" courses, Campbell said.
"There's no need to frontload
the humanities in the freshman
year," McConnell said.
Campbell detailed the "ideal
arc" of an undergraduate's four
years on the Farm: exploration for
freshman year, focus for sophomore
year, reflection for junior year and
synthesis for senior year.
"We are thinking very hard
about the senior year," McConnell
said, alluding to potential capstone
projects.
She noted that a reform of un
dergraduate education comes with
"a lot of trade-offs between free
dom and structure." On the one
hand, the SUES committee wants
students to have the flexibility to
pursue their academic passions; on
the flip side, it sees the need for
structure to guide and provide
freshman with a shared, first-year
experience.
McConnell stated that SUES
was "drawn to the idea that every
freshman take a big ideas course."
This course would provide a
meta-dimensional look at how
knowledge is created and transition
students toward university-level
thinking. The strategy is to promote
"the use of pedagogical strategies

that are specific to freshmen" and
move forward with what works. She
also alluded to possible develop
ment of new courses on topics such
as sustainability and global warm
ing.
McConnell also underlined the
important role of introductory sem
inars. Two-thirds of freshmen take
these seminars and, by the end of
sophomore year, this statistic goes
up to 75 percent. SUES is still delib
erating the pros and cons of requir

ing students to take a seminar.
The co-chairs cited another suc
cessful model for undergraduate ed
ucation.
"In the freshman year, we can
capitalize on the success of SLE,"
McConnell said.
Given the fact that 96 percent of
students live on campus, the SUES
committee considered further "inte
grating learning into the resi
dences," as SLE currently does.
Other notable recommendations

include a lasting commitment to
breadth, an appreciation of diversi
ty and difference and a new commit
ment to scientific analysis. The latter
objective would ensure that all stu
dents not only those in "techie"
fields have an understanding of
scientific fact, theory and inductive
and deductive reasoning.
Throughout the report, Camp
bell and McConnell both refer
enced the Commission on Under
graduate Education (CUE), a pred
ecessor to SUES that reevaluated
the undergraduate curriculum in
1994. According to Campbell, the
CUE study found that "Stanford
was a premier research university
and a body of undergraduates that
had no idea what that meant." The
latter statement no longer applies,
Campbell said, but more should be
done.
Thursday's presentation was the
third report by SUES to the Faculty
Senate this year. A full report
with more definitive recommenda
tions will be made in the fall of
2011.
"Between now and next fall, one
of the things I'd like to see is very,
very clear elevators speeches,"
Etchemendy said, referring to the
need for clearly delineated goals
that could be retained by both facul
ty and student over time.

ences, applied sciences and tech
nology. This aim goes hand in hand
with an underlying commitment to
cultivate students who are respon
sible and well-informed members
of society, according to the SUES
co-chairs.

Under the current GER system,
undergraduates must complete a
three-part Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) series, a two-part
Program Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) series, five Disciplinary
Breadth courses, two Education for
Citizenship courses, one Writing in
the Major (WIM) course and a for
eign language component.
But one of the problems with this
system, the co-chairs argued, is a
front-loading of GER require
ments. Many of these requirements
are completed freshman year. This
frontloading can be especially detri
mental to the humanities, since
some students view humanities
GERs as "something you need to
get through" before proceeding to
"real" courses, Campbell said.
"There's no need to frontload
the humanities in the freshman
year," McConnell said.
Campbell detailed the "ideal
arc" of an undergraduate's four
years on the Farm: exploration for
freshman year, focus for sophomore
year, reflection for junior year and
synthesis for senior year.
"We are thinking very hard
about the senior year," McConnell
said, alluding to potential capstone
projects.
She noted that a reform of un
dergraduate education comes with
"a lot of trade-offs between free
dom and structure." On the one
hand, the SUES committee wants
students to have the flexibility to
pursue their academic passions; on
the flip side, it sees the need for
structure to guide and provide
freshman with a shared, first-year
experience.
McConnell stated that SUES
was "drawn to the idea that every
freshman take a big ideas course."
This course would provide a
meta-dimensional look at how
knowledge is created and transition
students toward university-level
thinking. The strategy is to promote
"the use of pedagogical strategies

that are specific to freshmen" and
move forward with what works. She
also alluded to possible develop
ment of new courses on topics such
as sustainability and global warm
ing.
McConnell also underlined the
important role of introductory sem
inars. Two-thirds of freshmen take
these seminars and, by the end of
sophomore year, this statistic goes
up to 75 percent. SUES is still delib
erating the pros and cons of requir

ing students to take a seminar.
The co-chairs cited another suc
cessful model for undergraduate ed
ucation.
"In the freshman year, we can
capitalize on the success of SLE,"
McConnell said.
Given the fact that 96 percent of
students live on campus, the SUES
committee considered further "inte
grating learning into the resi
dences," as SLE currently does.
Other notable recommendations

include a lasting commitment to
breadth, an appreciation of diversi
ty and difference and a new commit
ment to scientific analysis. The latter
objective would ensure that all stu
dents not only those in "techie"
fields have an understanding of
scientific fact, theory and inductive
and deductive reasoning.
Throughout the report, Camp
bell and McConnell both refer
enced the Commission on Under
graduate Education (CUE), a pred
ecessor to SUES that reevaluated
the undergraduate curriculum in
1994. According to Campbell, the
CUE study found that "Stanford
was a premier research university
and a body of undergraduates that
had no idea what that meant." The
latter statement no longer applies,
Campbell said, but more should be
done.
Thursday's presentation was the
third report by SUES to the Faculty
Senate this year. A full report
with more definitive recommenda
tions will be made in the fall of
2011.
"Between now and next fall, one
of the things I'd like to see is very,
very clear elevators speeches,"
Etchemendy said, referring to the
need for clearly delineated goals
that could be retained by both facul
ty and student over time.

on undergraduate education's shortcomings and potential solutions.
The Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford (SUES) served
as the focal point of Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting. History profes
sor James Campbell 'B3 Ph.D. 'B9
and biology professor Susan Mc-
Connell, who jointly chair SUES,
delivered a presentation on the
shortcomings of the undergraduate
curriculum and general solutions to
these shortcomings.
Campbell noted that institutions
of higher learning have seen an in
crease in the rigor of their under
graduate majors specifically, an
"escalation of what we expect per
unit." This change in rigor is particu
larly "acute in the so-called STEM
fields" and "has been most acute at
Stanford," he said.

Undergraduate requirements
bring an added challenge by rein
forcing a culture of instrumentality
in which students strategically
choose classes to check off general
education requirements (GERs).
"Many students here simply game
the system" by basing their class se
lection on courses that count for
multiple GERs and "the likely per
centage of A's," Campbell said. De
tailed data on students' course selec
tions demonstrated "a very strong
culture of instrumentality," he
added.

Another danger in current Stan
ford trends is the foreclosing of op
portunities as students isolate them
selves in "silos" rather than explor
ing different areas of study.
According to Campbell, at the
crux of the SUES agenda is a push
to "reclaim a vision of liberal edu
cation." More specifically, SUES
maintains that the GERs should be
modified to introduce students to a
wide array of areas in the humani
ties, social sciences, natural sci
ences, applied sciences and tech
nology. This aim goes hand in hand
with an underlying commitment to
cultivate students who are respon
sible and well-informed members
of society, according to the SUES
co-chairs.
