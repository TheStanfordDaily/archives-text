## FacSen eyes curriculum changes Study on Undergraduate Education reports progress 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Study of Undergraduate Ed
ucation at Stanford (SUES) served
as the focal point of Thursday's Fac
ulty Senate meeting. History profes
sor James Campbell 'B3 Ph.D. 'B9
and biology professor Susan Mc-
Connell, who jointly chair SUES,
delivered a presentation on the
shortcomings of the undergraduate
curriculum and general solutions to
these shortcomings.
Campbell noted that institutions
of higher learning have seen an in
crease in the rigor of their under
graduate majors specifically, an
"escalation of what we expect per
unit." This change in rigor is particu
larly "acute in the so-called STEM
fields" and "has been most acute at
Stanford," he said.

Undergraduate requirements
bring an added challenge by rein
forcing a culture of instrumentality
in which students strategically
choose classes to check off general
education requirements (GERs).
"Many students here simply game
the system" by basing their class se
lection on courses that count for
multiple GERs and "the likely per
centage of A's," Campbell said. De
tailed data on students' course selec
tions demonstrated "a very strong
culture of instrumentality," he
added.

Another danger in current Stan
ford trends is the foreclosing of op
portunities as students isolate them
selves in "silos" rather than explor
ing different areas of study.
According to Campbell, at the
crux of the SUES agenda is a push
to "reclaim a vision of liberal edu
cation." More specifically, SUES
maintains that the GERs should be
modified to introduce students to a
wide array of areas in the humani
ties, social sciences, natural sci
ences, applied sciences and tech
nology. This aim goes hand in hand
with an underlying commitment to
cultivate students who are respon
sible and well-informed members
of society, according to the SUES
co-chairs.

Under the current GER system,
undergraduates must complete a
three-part Introduction to the Hu
manities (IHUM) series, a two-part
Program Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR) series, five Disciplinary
Breadth courses, two Education for
Citizenship courses, one Writing in
the Major (WIM) course and a for
eign language component.
But one of the problems with this
system, the co-chairs argued, is a
front-loading of GER require
ments. Many of these requirements
are completed freshman year. This
frontloading can be especially detri
mental to the humanities, since
some students view humanities
GERs as "something you need to
get through" before proceeding to
"real" courses, Campbell said.
