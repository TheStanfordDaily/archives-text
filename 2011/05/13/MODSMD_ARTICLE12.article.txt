Twenty-nine Stanford janitors
more than one in five of
those who clean academic
buildings will lose their jobs this
June if Stanford does nothing to de
fend them. For five months, work
ers and students organized by Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) have demonstrated and
petitioned for these workers' jobs.
Due to these efforts, 26 janitors
were permanently rehired, while a
further 29 were provisionally re
hired until some unconfirmed date
in June. Despite this, the adminis
tration continues to maintain its
non-involvement and to push the
responsibility for the situation onto
UGL-Unicco, the janitorial servic
es subcontractor and the janitors'
direct employer. Stanford claims
that this situation only concerns
UGL-Unicco and the janitors'
union, Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) Local 1877,
since Stanford does not directly
employ these janitors.
While this may be contractually
true, the unjust treatment of any
member of the Stanford communi
ty should ethically concern us all.
We believe that the Stanford ad
ministration is shirking its responsi
bility to ensure just treatment for
all members of the Stanford com
munity. UGL-Unicco will work to
satisfy the needs and wants of its
client, Stanford University. If the
administration indicates its interest
in the continued employment of all
29 janitors, UGL-Unicco will sure
ly allow them to stay.
Many of the 29 have worked at
Stanford for more than a decade
without incident. Yet, a reasonable
person might ask, the University is
still under budgetary pressure
shouldn't we value fiscal security
above janitors' jobs? Such a ques
tion assumes incorrectly, however,
that Stanford would cut any ex
penses whatsoever by laying off the
workers in question.
Since Stanford pays UGL-
Unicco a monthly lump-sum, only
UGL-Unicco benefits from these
lay-offs. Since the prior wages of
the janitors were factored into the
lump-sum negotiated with the Uni
versity, UGL-Unicco would greatly
increase their profits by firing cur
rent janitors, especially those who
have seniority and make up to
$13.09 per hour with full benefits,
and in their place hiring new work
ers for $9.15 who have no benefits
or healthcare, a number far below
Stanford's living wage of $13.49 per
hour without health benefits. In this

way, Stanford students and admin
istrators will be paying the same
amount of money for inferior, inex
perienced, untested and untrusted
services. Only UGL-Unicco's bot
tom line benefits.
UGL-Unicco has also tried to
force janitors out by pretending
they are illegal immigrants. In a
previous op-ed, a UGL-Unicco
janitor and a student from SLAC
explained that when Stanford re
placed ABM with UGL-Unicco
last year, citing a desire for im
proved service, 55 of 134 janitors
were issued letters stating that they
would no longer be offered work
after December Ist due to identity
check discrepancies. The op-ed
went on to explain that all of the
workers were able to present 1-9
documentation, fulfilling the feder
al requirement for legal authoriza
tion to work in the United States.
As a result, "whatever problems
that may have come up with the ad
ditional identity checks that UGL-
Unicco performed were not a valid
reason to end these workers' jobs."
Considering this record of false
claims, and UGL-Unicco's lack of
disclosure of the source database
for these discrepancies, the root of
this issue is clearly not based on an
issue of documentation.
In addition to the 29 workers
whose jobs are at stake, this situa
tion has the grave potential of set
ting a precedent that could affect
the job security, wages and benefits
of all Stanford workers in the future.
Stanford should not stand for UGL-
Unicco mismanaging contract funds
that Stanford has allocated in good
faith to improve services, not to fire
experienced workers whose wages
we've already agreed to pay.
We applaud the efforts of the
UGL-Unicco workers and their
student supporters in advancing
this cause and encourage other stu
dents to actively participate in this
campaign to demonstrate our care
and value for all members of the
Stanford community. We call on the
University's administration to use
its leverage over UGL-Unicco to
support these efforts until the con
tractor permanently rehires all cur
rent j anitors, the demand that 2,000
members of the Stanford commu
nity articulated in a December pe
tition. Stanford has a founding
commitment to "promote the pub
lic welfare ... on behalf of human
ity and civilization"; by allowing a
contractor to fool us with a bait
and-switch, we sell out our values
too cheaply.

In addition to the 29 workers
whose jobs are at stake, this situa
tion has the grave potential of set
ting a precedent that could affect
the job security, wages and benefits
of all Stanford workers in the future.
Stanford should not stand for UGL-
Unicco mismanaging contract funds
that Stanford has allocated in good
faith to improve services, not to fire
experienced workers whose wages
we've already agreed to pay.
We applaud the efforts of the
UGL-Unicco workers and their
student supporters in advancing
this cause and encourage other stu
dents to actively participate in this
campaign to demonstrate our care
and value for all members of the
Stanford community. We call on the
University's administration to use
its leverage over UGL-Unicco to
support these efforts until the con
tractor permanently rehires all cur
rent j anitors, the demand that 2,000
members of the Stanford commu
nity articulated in a December pe
tition. Stanford has a founding
commitment to "promote the pub
lic welfare ... on behalf of human
ity and civilization"; by allowing a
contractor to fool us with a bait
and-switch, we sell out our values
too cheaply.

Twenty-nine Stanford janitors
more than one in five of
those who clean academic
buildings will lose their jobs this
June if Stanford does nothing to de
fend them. For five months, work
ers and students organized by Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) have demonstrated and
petitioned for these workers' jobs.
Due to these efforts, 26 janitors
were permanently rehired, while a
further 29 were provisionally re
hired until some unconfirmed date
in June. Despite this, the adminis
tration continues to maintain its
non-involvement and to push the
responsibility for the situation onto
UGL-Unicco, the janitorial servic
es subcontractor and the janitors'
direct employer. Stanford claims
that this situation only concerns
UGL-Unicco and the janitors'
union, Service Employees Interna
tional Union (SEIU) Local 1877,
since Stanford does not directly
employ these janitors.
While this may be contractually
true, the unjust treatment of any
member of the Stanford communi
ty should ethically concern us all.
We believe that the Stanford ad
ministration is shirking its responsi
bility to ensure just treatment for
all members of the Stanford com
munity. UGL-Unicco will work to
satisfy the needs and wants of its
client, Stanford University. If the
administration indicates its interest
in the continued employment of all
29 janitors, UGL-Unicco will sure
ly allow them to stay.
Many of the 29 have worked at
Stanford for more than a decade
without incident. Yet, a reasonable
person might ask, the University is
still under budgetary pressure
shouldn't we value fiscal security
above janitors' jobs? Such a ques
tion assumes incorrectly, however,
that Stanford would cut any ex
penses whatsoever by laying off the
workers in question.
Since Stanford pays UGL-
Unicco a monthly lump-sum, only
UGL-Unicco benefits from these
lay-offs. Since the prior wages of
the janitors were factored into the
lump-sum negotiated with the Uni
versity, UGL-Unicco would greatly
increase their profits by firing cur
rent janitors, especially those who
have seniority and make up to
$13.09 per hour with full benefits,
and in their place hiring new work
ers for $9.15 who have no benefits
or healthcare, a number far below
Stanford's living wage of $13.49 per
hour without health benefits. In this

way, Stanford students and admin
istrators will be paying the same
amount of money for inferior, inex
perienced, untested and untrusted
services. Only UGL-Unicco's bot
tom line benefits.
UGL-Unicco has also tried to
force janitors out by pretending
they are illegal immigrants. In a
previous op-ed, a UGL-Unicco
janitor and a student from SLAC
explained that when Stanford re
placed ABM with UGL-Unicco
last year, citing a desire for im
proved service, 55 of 134 janitors
were issued letters stating that they
would no longer be offered work
after December Ist due to identity
check discrepancies. The op-ed
went on to explain that all of the
workers were able to present 1-9
documentation, fulfilling the feder
al requirement for legal authoriza
tion to work in the United States.
As a result, "whatever problems
that may have come up with the ad
ditional identity checks that UGL-
Unicco performed were not a valid
reason to end these workers' jobs."
Considering this record of false
claims, and UGL-Unicco's lack of
disclosure of the source database
for these discrepancies, the root of
this issue is clearly not based on an
issue of documentation.
In addition to the 29 workers
whose jobs are at stake, this situa
tion has the grave potential of set
ting a precedent that could affect
the job security, wages and benefits
of all Stanford workers in the future.
Stanford should not stand for UGL-
Unicco mismanaging contract funds
that Stanford has allocated in good
faith to improve services, not to fire
