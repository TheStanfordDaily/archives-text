# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Escape 
### Kristian Bailey 
Last night I hiked all the way to
In-N-Out at one in the morn
ing. It started out as a trip to
get Mexican food at a taqueria on S.
California Avenue, and then to
Happy Donuts on El Camino, once
I realized the taqueria was only
serving alcohol that late. Well, really
it started out as an attempt to es
cape for a little bit. As I wrote about
last week, I was feeling at a rock
bottom of sort; this week I felt more
like I was flint scraping along that
bottom layer, just barely rising in el
evation. I have evolved, or de
volved, into an identity crisis of
sorts. This is the best I can do to ex
plain it:

Part of this crisis is figuring out
who I am as an academic I know
I want to build my own curriculum
in one of Stanford's many great in
terdisciplinary programs, but which
one, I am unsure. STS was one of the
reasons I chose to come to Stanford
and could make the difference be
tween my being a straight-up fuzzy
or having some technical proficien
cy, yet American Studies has always
been up my alley and the Philoso
phy and Literature track sound in

creasingly appealing as SLE draws
to an end. But the majority of this
crisis stems from bigger issues.
I'm currently in an IntroSem
called "Can Machines Know? Can
Machines Feel?" which is a comput
er science class examining the phi
losophy behind strong artificial in
telligence. As a "fuzzy," this class has
meant less to me about whether ma
chines can or will be able to mimic
the human mind and more about
what it means to be human, to be
conscious, to have free will (if we
have it at all) questions of that
sort. Couple this with our spring
SLE curriculum, which moves forth
into modernity in all of its violence
and mass production and sex and
existential crises, as well as my real
ization that my winter quarter prob

lems didn't simply disappear, and
you can get a small glimpse into
why I'm feeling so lost. I've been
wondering what it means to be
growing up in the 21st century
whether society is progressing, or
whether our morals and intellect
are declining as a result of our
changing culture; I've been won
dering what it means to be happy
and whether our generation is or
can be any happier than other peri
ods in history; I've been wondering
who I am as a person and how my
future will appear. And yet another
part of my crisis stems from self-in
duced academic stress.

As I expressed in "Mid Year
Evaluation," an op-ed I wrote for
the last volume in January, I've had
a fear of "failure" a fear of
achieving anything less than my ex
pectations of perfection. "Nobody's
perfect" is something my mother
still reminds me, and while I under
stand this (and will be the first to list

all of my flaws), I excuse myself
from this adage with the following
logic: I'm not perfect, but my stan
dards can be and my imperfect self
can aim for those standards. For the
first time in a while, I felt the feeling
of failure.

For the last two weeks, I've
been agonizing over an oral pres
entation in SLE that counts to
wards what exempts SLE students
from having to take PWR. So far,
everyone in my section has blown
us away with thoughtful, original
and nuanced arguments that shed
light on the texts we've read in a
new way. I missed the mark for
finishing the reading on time with
my depressive lack of motivation
(described last week), and part of
my anxiety stemmed from the fear
that I wouldn't and couldn't
match my classmates' stellar per
formances. So, even though I
started my assigned Freud read
ing the week of April 18,1 did not
finish said text until last night. As
of nine a.m. yesterday, I had noth
ing, and while the impending
deadline forced me to put some
thing together, it did not come
anywhere near my standards. And

somehow, that was liberating.
So was something about my late
night bike ride. It felt great to get
away from campus, to be under an
empty black sky, to feel the fluores
cence and emptiness of suburban
California at night and to just be
one with my thoughts. I recognized
that I couldn't simply escape my
problems, that I'll have to deal with
them eventually.
I started feeling liberated and
being more realistic about my ex
pectations on Wednesday, when I
officially asked to take an incom
plete in SLE and hand in my Marx
term paper after our deadline in
just over a week. While I'm aiming
to finish the paper before I leave
Stanford for the summer, I feel
much better giving myself the time
I need to figure out my problems;
while we do pay to grow academi
cally at Stanford, I think another
equally important part of the expe
rience is to grow as individuals, and
that's what I'm doing now.

night bike run to In-N-Out. Sign up at

I realized the taqueria was only
serving alcohol that late. Well, really
it started out as an attempt to es
cape for a little bit. As I wrote about
last week, I was feeling at a rock
bottom of sort; this week I felt more
like I was flint scraping along that
bottom layer, just barely rising in el
evation. I have evolved, or de
volved, into an identity crisis of
sorts. This is the best I can do to ex
plain it:

Part of this crisis is figuring out
who I am as an academic I know
I want to build my own curriculum
in one of Stanford's many great in
terdisciplinary programs, but which
one, I am unsure. STS was one of the
reasons I chose to come to Stanford
and could make the difference be
tween my being a straight-up fuzzy
or having some technical proficien
cy, yet American Studies has always
been up my alley and the Philoso
phy and Literature track sound in

creasingly appealing as SLE draws
to an end. But the majority of this
crisis stems from bigger issues.
I'm currently in an IntroSem
called "Can Machines Know? Can
Machines Feel?" which is a comput
er science class examining the phi
losophy behind strong artificial in
telligence. As a "fuzzy," this class has
meant less to me about whether ma
chines can or will be able to mimic
the human mind and more about
what it means to be human, to be
conscious, to have free will (if we
have it at all) questions of that
sort. Couple this with our spring
SLE curriculum, which moves forth
into modernity in all of its violence
and mass production and sex and
existential crises, as well as my real
ization that my winter quarter prob

lems didn't simply disappear, and
you can get a small glimpse into
why I'm feeling so lost. I've been
wondering what it means to be
growing up in the 21st century
whether society is progressing, or
whether our morals and intellect
are declining as a result of our
changing culture; I've been won
dering what it means to be happy
and whether our generation is or
can be any happier than other peri
ods in history; I've been wondering
who I am as a person and how my
future will appear. And yet another
part of my crisis stems from self-in
duced academic stress.

As I expressed in "Mid Year
Evaluation," an op-ed I wrote for
the last volume in January, I've had
a fear of "failure" a fear of
achieving anything less than my ex
pectations of perfection. "Nobody's
perfect" is something my mother
still reminds me, and while I under
stand this (and will be the first to list

all of my flaws), I excuse myself
from this adage with the following
logic: I'm not perfect, but my stan
dards can be and my imperfect self
can aim for those standards. For the
first time in a while, I felt the feeling
of failure.

For the last two weeks, I've
been agonizing over an oral pres
entation in SLE that counts to
wards what exempts SLE students
from having to take PWR. So far,
everyone in my section has blown
us away with thoughtful, original
and nuanced arguments that shed
light on the texts we've read in a
new way. I missed the mark for
finishing the reading on time with
my depressive lack of motivation
(described last week), and part of
my anxiety stemmed from the fear
that I wouldn't and couldn't
match my classmates' stellar per
formances. So, even though I
started my assigned Freud read
ing the week of April 18,1 did not
finish said text until last night. As
of nine a.m. yesterday, I had noth
ing, and while the impending
deadline forced me to put some
thing together, it did not come
anywhere near my standards. And

somehow, that was liberating.
So was something about my late
night bike ride. It felt great to get
away from campus, to be under an
empty black sky, to feel the fluores
cence and emptiness of suburban
California at night and to just be
one with my thoughts. I recognized
that I couldn't simply escape my
problems, that I'll have to deal with
them eventually.
I started feeling liberated and
being more realistic about my ex
pectations on Wednesday, when I
officially asked to take an incom
plete in SLE and hand in my Marx
term paper after our deadline in
just over a week. While I'm aiming
to finish the paper before I leave
Stanford for the summer, I feel
much better giving myself the time
I need to figure out my problems;
while we do pay to grow academi
cally at Stanford, I think another
equally important part of the expe
rience is to grow as individuals, and
that's what I'm doing now.

Kristian is wondering if anyone
wants to join him for another late
night bike run to In-N-Out. Sign up at
