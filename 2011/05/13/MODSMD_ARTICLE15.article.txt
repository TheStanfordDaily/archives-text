# MARKS MY WORDS
## Constructing Your Criticism 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
I was happily full and carrying a
steaming hot cup of coffee as I
left the dining hall and bumped
into a friend I hadn't seen in awhile.
We made the usual small talk and
discussed the finer points of the
brunch options at Lag Dining. Then
he made the first move that pro
pelled us into new territory.
"Yo, Miriam, I really enjoy read
ing you every week." Pause. We each
made a face. "Haha. I mean, reading
what you write."
Aha! There is, of course, nothing
I love more than getting some im
promptu face- praise for my column.
Seeing the thumbs ups on Facebook
or I guess the new Daily Face
book plug-in is one thing, but the
compliments I manage to garner
from face-to-face interactions defi
nitely count for more. I soaked it up
by first feigning surprise. "Oh! You
read my column?"
Well, obviously he read it. I admit
I was deliberately extending the
moment, basking in a brief ray of
fame and glory before I would have
to go home and start writing a paper.
I couldn't just let the conversation
go. It was time to try eking some

more specific praise from this guy.
"So, do you like it? Which one was
your favorite?"
You'd think that was cue enough
for him to start gushing about how
much he loves "Marks My Words."
Nope.
"I mean, it's funny sometimes.
But it's a little predictable."
What! Predictable? I hid my irri
tation. "Um, what do you mean?"
"Well, each week there's just
some new awkward situation and
how Miriam thinks you should deal
with it. Kinda boring after awhile,
right?"
Predictable? Boring?! After the
initial moments of shock, disbelief
and horror, I was calm once again. I
had suddenly realized that this com
ment meant more to me than any of
the praise I'd gotten before.

It was another reminder that
sometimes it's good to hear the cold,
hard truth, a lesson best described in
yet another anecdote. You've proba
bly experienced some version of the
friend-asking-for-advice-on-her
outfit scenario. Recap: you and your
friends are getting dressed up to go
out, and your friend asks if a top
looks good on her. And, omgs,
maybe she just bought it from Nord
strom's and it's, like, so cute and stuff
and there's this guy she really wants
to hook up with tonight, so it looks
good on her, right?
Sometimes it might look great,
and you can just say so. But what if it
just doesn't look that good? Maybe
it's way too slutty, a bad color or not
quite slutty enough (i.e., a turtleneck
sweater). Then you have to decide
what to tell her.

There is, interestingly, that weird
inverse relationship between your
degree of honesty regarding her
choice of outfit and the degree of
your friendship with her. If you
don't know her that well, you'll
probably say something like, "Oh
