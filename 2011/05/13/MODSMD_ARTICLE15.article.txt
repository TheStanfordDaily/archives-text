# MARKS MY WORDS
## Constructing Your Criticism 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
I was happily full and carrying a
steaming hot cup of coffee as I
left the dining hall and bumped
into a friend I hadn't seen in awhile.
We made the usual small talk and
discussed the finer points of the
brunch options at Lag Dining. Then
he made the first move that pro
pelled us into new territory.
"Yo, Miriam, I really enjoy read
ing you every week." Pause. We each
made a face. "Haha. I mean, reading
what you write."
Aha! There is, of course, nothing
I love more than getting some im
promptu face- praise for my column.
Seeing the thumbs ups on Facebook
or I guess the new Daily Face
book plug-in is one thing, but the
compliments I manage to garner
from face-to-face interactions defi
nitely count for more. I soaked it up
by first feigning surprise. "Oh! You
read my column?"
Well, obviously he read it. I admit
I was deliberately extending the
moment, basking in a brief ray of
fame and glory before I would have
to go home and start writing a paper.
I couldn't just let the conversation
go. It was time to try eking some

more specific praise from this guy.
"So, do you like it? Which one was
your favorite?"
You'd think that was cue enough
for him to start gushing about how
much he loves "Marks My Words."
Nope.
"I mean, it's funny sometimes.
But it's a little predictable."
What! Predictable? I hid my irri
tation. "Um, what do you mean?"
"Well, each week there's just
some new awkward situation and
how Miriam thinks you should deal
with it. Kinda boring after awhile,
right?"
Predictable? Boring?! After the
initial moments of shock, disbelief
and horror, I was calm once again. I
had suddenly realized that this com
ment meant more to me than any of
the praise I'd gotten before.

It was another reminder that
sometimes it's good to hear the cold,
hard truth, a lesson best described in
yet another anecdote. You've proba
bly experienced some version of the
friend-asking-for-advice-on-her
outfit scenario. Recap: you and your
friends are getting dressed up to go
out, and your friend asks if a top
looks good on her. And, omgs,
maybe she just bought it from Nord
strom's and it's, like, so cute and stuff
and there's this guy she really wants
to hook up with tonight, so it looks
good on her, right?
Sometimes it might look great,
and you can just say so. But what if it
just doesn't look that good? Maybe
it's way too slutty, a bad color or not
quite slutty enough (i.e., a turtleneck
sweater). Then you have to decide
what to tell her.

There is, interestingly, that weird
inverse relationship between your
degree of honesty regarding her
choice of outfit and the degree of
your friendship with her. If you
don't know her that well, you'll
probably say something like, "Oh

totally, you look SO good, he'll be
all over you tonight." And, paradox
ically, if you're a close friend, you'll
likely say, "Hmm it's alright, but
maybe try that other top you wore
to the progressive last quarter?"
The difference, I think, lies in the
balance between how much you
care about your friend and how
much you want her to like you. If
you just befriended the girl with the
new top, you probably want to de
velop your friendship by only show
ering her with compliments or, at
the very least, by avoiding any sort
of confrontation. As a result, the last
thing you'd do is offer a criticism,
however constructive, of her new
outfit. You'll play it safe, matching
your compliment closely to the ap
praisal that she already gave her
outfit, and keep quiet after that.
However, if the girl with the new
top is your best friend already, you
don't need to keep trying to get her
to like you. You have an established
relationship, a long history of late
nights, study sessions and social out
ings together. If you give her an
honest opinion, she'll have to take it

because she a) can't afford to pick a
huge fight with her best friend over
something as minor as a difference
of opinion on her new top and b) re
spects and values your opinion.
Chances are you also care about
her, and you don't want her to go
out looking less attractive than she
could.

That's why, because construc
tive criticism is probably only used
at a certain level of friendship, it
means that much more when you
hear it. It's why people don't like
constant compliments that eventu
ally might sound fake. Someone
willing to tell you to try a different
outfit or write a more interesting
column is saying, "Hey, I think
we're good enough friends that you
won't hate me if I give you my hon
est opinion."
And so, despite my initial horror
that someone might label my col
umn as "boring" and "predictable,"
it reminded me that this guy
thought of me as a friend with
whom he could speak freely.
Frankly, he made a good point, too.
That was a good enough feeling to
quickly override my resentment.

Following this logic, if you email Miri
am constructive criticism, you're auto
matically her friend. Send her a mes
sage at melloram@stanford. edu.

thing you'd do is offer a criticism,
however constructive, of her new
outfit. You'll play it safe, matching
your compliment closely to the ap
praisal that she already gave her
outfit, and keep quiet after that.
However, if the girl with the new
top is your best friend already, you
don't need to keep trying to get her
to like you. You have an established
relationship, a long history of late
nights, study sessions and social out
ings together. If you give her an
honest opinion, she'll have to take it

because she a) can't afford to pick a
huge fight with her best friend over
something as minor as a difference
of opinion on her new top and b) re
spects and values your opinion.
Chances are you also care about
her, and you don't want her to go
out looking less attractive than she
could.

That's why, because construc
tive criticism is probably only used
at a certain level of friendship, it
means that much more when you
hear it. It's why people don't like
constant compliments that eventu
ally might sound fake. Someone
willing to tell you to try a different
outfit or write a more interesting
column is saying, "Hey, I think
we're good enough friends that you
won't hate me if I give you my hon
est opinion."
And so, despite my initial horror
that someone might label my col
umn as "boring" and "predictable,"
it reminded me that this guy
thought of me as a friend with
whom he could speak freely.
Frankly, he made a good point, too.
That was a good enough feeling to
quickly override my resentment.

I was happily full and carrying a
steaming hot cup of coffee as I
left the dining hall and bumped
into a friend I hadn't seen in awhile.
We made the usual small talk and
discussed the finer points of the
brunch options at Lag Dining. Then
he made the first move that pro
pelled us into new territory.
"Yo, Miriam, I really enjoy read
ing you every week." Pause. We each
made a face. "Haha. I mean, reading
what you write."
Aha! There is, of course, nothing
I love more than getting some im
promptu face- praise for my column.
Seeing the thumbs ups on Facebook
or I guess the new Daily Face
book plug-in is one thing, but the
compliments I manage to garner
from face-to-face interactions defi
nitely count for more. I soaked it up
by first feigning surprise. "Oh! You
read my column?"
Well, obviously he read it. I admit
I was deliberately extending the
moment, basking in a brief ray of
fame and glory before I would have
to go home and start writing a paper.
I couldn't just let the conversation
go. It was time to try eking some

more specific praise from this guy.
"So, do you like it? Which one was
your favorite?"
You'd think that was cue enough
for him to start gushing about how
much he loves "Marks My Words."
Nope.
"I mean, it's funny sometimes.
But it's a little predictable."
What! Predictable? I hid my irri
tation. "Um, what do you mean?"
"Well, each week there's just
some new awkward situation and
how Miriam thinks you should deal
with it. Kinda boring after awhile,
right?"
Predictable? Boring?! After the
initial moments of shock, disbelief
and horror, I was calm once again. I
had suddenly realized that this com
ment meant more to me than any of
the praise I'd gotten before.

It was another reminder that
sometimes it's good to hear the cold,
hard truth, a lesson best described in
yet another anecdote. You've proba
bly experienced some version of the
friend-asking-for-advice-on-her
outfit scenario. Recap: you and your
friends are getting dressed up to go
out, and your friend asks if a top
looks good on her. And, omgs,
maybe she just bought it from Nord
strom's and it's, like, so cute and stuff
and there's this guy she really wants
to hook up with tonight, so it looks
good on her, right?
Sometimes it might look great,
and you can just say so. But what if it
just doesn't look that good? Maybe
it's way too slutty, a bad color or not
quite slutty enough (i.e., a turtleneck
sweater). Then you have to decide
what to tell her.

There is, interestingly, that weird
inverse relationship between your
degree of honesty regarding her
choice of outfit and the degree of
your friendship with her. If you
don't know her that well, you'll
probably say something like, "Oh

totally, you look SO good, he'll be
all over you tonight." And, paradox
ically, if you're a close friend, you'll
likely say, "Hmm it's alright, but
maybe try that other top you wore
to the progressive last quarter?"
The difference, I think, lies in the
balance between how much you
care about your friend and how
much you want her to like you. If
you just befriended the girl with the
new top, you probably want to de
velop your friendship by only show
ering her with compliments or, at
the very least, by avoiding any sort
of confrontation. As a result, the last
thing you'd do is offer a criticism,
however constructive, of her new
outfit. You'll play it safe, matching
your compliment closely to the ap
praisal that she already gave her
outfit, and keep quiet after that.
However, if the girl with the new
top is your best friend already, you
don't need to keep trying to get her
