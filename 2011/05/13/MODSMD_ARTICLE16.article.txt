# OP-ED
## ROTC Redux 
### BEN BARRES Professor Chair of Neurobiology 
Dear Editor,
In an op-ed piece this past
Wednesday, Jonathan Poto 'l3 ex
pressed frustration at Stanford's de
cision to reinstate ROTC and at our
Provost's op-ed affirming his sup
port of the transgender community
at Stanford. Though I can well un
derstand Mr. Poto's frustration, I
feel his view is not entirely fair to
our leadership. As a transgender
faculty member, I have received
only strong support from the Stan
ford community and leadership for
the past 15 years. I feel very proud
and lucky to be at a place where our
leadership has repeatedly taken
real actions to support the transgen
der community. Most recently, this
includes the inclusion of student
health insurance benefits that cover
medical treatment and surgeries for
transgender students, a substantial

benefit that exists at few other uni
versities (at our sister institution
Harvard, whenever a certain well
known professor makes trans-pho
bic statements to the students, these
statements are met with silence by
their leadership something that
would never happen here). As was
clear from his highly moving op-ed
piece, our Provost has deep and
genuine respect for our transgender
community and he truly anguished
over the ROTC decision. Important
values were in conflict there
could be no decision that would be
fair to all. In a highly respectful Fac
ulty Senate discussion, this issue
was discussed fully and a decision
was made to reinstate ROTC.
Though some in our transgender
community may not agree with this
decision, there are many of us that
do. Personally, I believe that at pres

ent our military is a highly unsafe
place for transgender soldiers. Even
women are not safe in the military.
Up to 40 percent of female soldiers
have been sexually assaulted while
the military top leadership looks
the other way, rarely punishing the
perpetrators. The removal of "don't
ask, don't tell" is a landmark step
forward, and in time, the military
will admit transgender soldiers.
And when this happens, thanks to
reinstatement of ROTC here, there
will be Stanford trained officers in
command who will support this
transition. In the meantime, I am
very proud of the way our LGBT
students and their friends have or
ganized and worked together to im
prove the lives of transgender stu
dents at Stanford. But I think it
would be wise for those students
frustrated by the ROTC decision to
realize that in life one wins some
and loses some. And sometimes it is
better to be graceful in defeat than

to alienate one's strongest support
ers. There is much left to be done,
and I am certain that our leadership
will continue to be fully supportive.
Our Provost really cares about all
of our various diverse communities
at Stanford, and we are very (very!)
lucky to have him here.
