# Pilot interview program made permanent
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown 
The option for Stanford appli
cants to interview with alumni vol
unteers will graduate from the pilot
stage to a permanent program this
coming year. The change follows
approval in April by the Faculty
Senate Committee on Undergrad
uate Admission and Financial Aid.

As before, the program will be
optional; applications will be con
sidered complete with or without
an interview and students who do
not to participate will not incur a
penalty. Alumni will continue to
contact applicants directly if an in
terview is available in their region,
and applicants still cannot request
one.
As previously reported, the in
terview option has been over
whelmingly popular. During the
2010-11 application season, alumni
volunteers interviewed roughly

3,000 students, which met the pilot
program's goal. The program was
introduced to provide the Office of
Undergraduate Admission infor
mation about applicants that might
not show in paper applications and
offer candidates a more in-depth
chance to learn about Stanford.
The program started in 2008-09,
initially with 378 alumni interview
ers spread between Atlanta, Den
ver, Portland, New York and Lon
don. For 2010-11, the number of in
terviewers grew to 1,061 and loca
tions expanded to include Philadel
phia, Portland, Raleigh/Durham,
Minneapolis-St. Paul, Washington
D.C., Massachusetts and Virginia.
According to a press release,
Dean of Admission Richard Shaw
said the University intends to roll
out the program in Chicago, Dallas,
Houston, Seattle, Singapore, Ore
gon and Minnesota for the 2011-12
application cycle. He added that
Stanford will expand the program
worldwide over the next few years,
in the meantime "focusing on refin
ing our infrastructure to support
global expansion."
