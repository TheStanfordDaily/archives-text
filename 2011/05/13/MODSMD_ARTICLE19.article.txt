## BURNED IN THE DESERT 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The anticipated duel between
Arizona State's pitcher Dallas Es
cobedo and Stanford's own Tea
gan Gerhart lived up to its billing,
as both aces pitched complete
games, but the Sun Devils' offense
scratched out a couple of key hits
and Escobedo pitched her way
out of two bases-loaded jams on
the way to a 3-1 victory over the
Cardinal in the desert.

Arizona State (49-5,16-3 Pac
-10) came into the matchup as the
nation's top-ranked squad, and its
potent offense got on the board
early. Shortstop Katelyn Boyd,
who was one of ten players re
cently named as finalists for the
National Player of the Year award
along with Stanford junior Ashley
Hansen, led off the bottom of the
first inning with a home run to left
field. Freshman right fielder Cait
lyn Pura made a running catch
with a runner on to limit the dam
age for the No. 12 Cardinal (37-14,
9-10), and Gerhart settled down
she didn't allow another run
until the sixth inning.
But the night was one full of
squandered offensive opportuni
ties for the Cardinal. Escobedo
proved to be wild, walking six bat
ters and hitting two more. Hansen
reached base on an infield hit in
the first inning and sophomore

After losing a 3-1 decision last night at Arizona State, sophomore pitcher Teagan Gerhart (above) dropped to
21-10. She was also thrown out trying to steal second base, the first time in 23 attempts she has been caught.

second baseman Jenna Rich fol
lowed that up with an infield hit of
her own.

Freshman designated player
Michelle Prong walked to load the
bases with just one out. The next
two Cardinal batters struck out on
riseballs from Escobedo, and Ari
zona State was out of the jam.
Stanford would load the bases
again in the third inning, but Pura
popped out and junior left fielder
Maya Burns Hied out to center, elim
inating another Cardinal threat.
Gerhart found her rhythm with
her sister Kelsey Gerhart catch
ing behind the plate, striking out
two batters in a quick fourth in
ning as Stanford headed into the
late innings trailing by just one
run.

And when Hansen led off the
top of the fifth inning with her
eighth home run of the season, it
looked like the Cardinal might fi
nally break through and get to Es
cobedo. But the freshman calmed
down and retired the side.

In the bottom of the frame, the
Sun Devils showed why they have
lost just five games all year and
clinched the Pac-10 title outright. A
leadoff walk was followed by a sin
gle through the left side and then a
sacrifice bunt put runners on sec
ond and third with one out.
That's when Kristen Donnen
wirth came through with her 47th
and 48th RBI of the season, fighting
a pitch off her hands and into center
field that plated both runners. Ger
hart coaxed two pop-outs to end
the inning, but the damage was
done.
Stanford went down in order in
both the sixth and seventh innings,
and Escobedo finished off the game
to improve to 26-3 Teagan Ger

hart dropped to 21-10.
With two more hits, Hansen
pushed her batting average back to
.497. She has two more games
against the Sun Devils before the
end of the regular season, but is cur
rently leading the Pac-10 in average
by .61.
The loss dropped Stanford
under .500 in conference play at 9-
10 and, coupled with Oregon's vic
tory over UCLA, put it back into
the fifth spot in the Pac-10 stand
ings. With a lot of teams jockeying
for postseason position, Stanford is
likely right on the bubble in its
chances of grabbing one of the 16
bids to host a first round-matchup
when the NCAA Tournament be
gins on May 20.
The series continues tonight at 7
p.m., with the finale scheduled for
tomorrow at 2 p.m. The NCAA
Tournament field will be an
nounced Sunday afternoon.

ARIZONA STATE 3
5/12, Tempe, Ariz.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
After losing a 3-1 decision last night at Arizona State, sophomore pitcher Teagan Gerhart (above) dropped to
21-10. She was also thrown out trying to steal second base, the first time in 23 attempts she has been caught.

second baseman Jenna Rich fol
lowed that up with an infield hit of
her own.

Freshman designated player
Michelle Prong walked to load the
bases with just one out. The next
two Cardinal batters struck out on
riseballs from Escobedo, and Ari
zona State was out of the jam.
Stanford would load the bases
again in the third inning, but Pura
popped out and junior left fielder
Maya Burns Hied out to center, elim
inating another Cardinal threat.
Gerhart found her rhythm with
her sister Kelsey Gerhart catch
ing behind the plate, striking out
two batters in a quick fourth in
ning as Stanford headed into the
late innings trailing by just one
run.

And when Hansen led off the
top of the fifth inning with her
eighth home run of the season, it
looked like the Cardinal might fi
nally break through and get to Es
cobedo. But the freshman calmed
down and retired the side.

In the bottom of the frame, the
Sun Devils showed why they have
lost just five games all year and
clinched the Pac-10 title outright. A
leadoff walk was followed by a sin
gle through the left side and then a
sacrifice bunt put runners on sec
ond and third with one out.
That's when Kristen Donnen
wirth came through with her 47th
and 48th RBI of the season, fighting
a pitch off her hands and into center
field that plated both runners. Ger
hart coaxed two pop-outs to end
the inning, but the damage was
done.
Stanford went down in order in
both the sixth and seventh innings,
and Escobedo finished off the game
to improve to 26-3 Teagan Ger

hart dropped to 21-10.
With two more hits, Hansen
pushed her batting average back to
.497. She has two more games
against the Sun Devils before the
end of the regular season, but is cur
rently leading the Pac-10 in average
by .61.
The loss dropped Stanford
under .500 in conference play at 9-
10 and, coupled with Oregon's vic
tory over UCLA, put it back into
the fifth spot in the Pac-10 stand
ings. With a lot of teams jockeying
for postseason position, Stanford is
likely right on the bubble in its
chances of grabbing one of the 16
bids to host a first round-matchup
when the NCAA Tournament be
gins on May 20.
The series continues tonight at 7
p.m., with the finale scheduled for
tomorrow at 2 p.m. The NCAA
Tournament field will be an
nounced Sunday afternoon.
