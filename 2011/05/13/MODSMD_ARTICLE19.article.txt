## BURNED IN THE DESERT 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
The anticipated duel between
Arizona State's pitcher Dallas Es
cobedo and Stanford's own Tea
gan Gerhart lived up to its billing,
as both aces pitched complete
games, but the Sun Devils' offense
scratched out a couple of key hits
and Escobedo pitched her way
out of two bases-loaded jams on
the way to a 3-1 victory over the
Cardinal in the desert.

Arizona State (49-5,16-3 Pac
-10) came into the matchup as the
nation's top-ranked squad, and its
potent offense got on the board
early. Shortstop Katelyn Boyd,
who was one of ten players re
cently named as finalists for the
National Player of the Year award
along with Stanford junior Ashley
Hansen, led off the bottom of the
first inning with a home run to left
field. Freshman right fielder Cait
lyn Pura made a running catch
with a runner on to limit the dam
age for the No. 12 Cardinal (37-14,
9-10), and Gerhart settled down
she didn't allow another run
until the sixth inning.
But the night was one full of
squandered offensive opportuni
ties for the Cardinal. Escobedo
proved to be wild, walking six bat
ters and hitting two more. Hansen
reached base on an infield hit in
the first inning and sophomore

NOTES; After dropping the first of a three
game set with No. 1 Arizona State, the
No. 11 Cardinal likely needs to win at
least one of the two remaining games to
ensure that it will host one of 16 NCAA
Regional sites when NCAA Tournament
play begins next Friday. Junior Ashley
Hansen is also aiming for a .500 batting
average, sitting at .497 after last night.
