# PLAY TIME IS OVER
## NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS BEGIN SATURDAY 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
J As the Stanford
women's tennis team
heads into its 30th
;traight appearance in
e NCAA Tournament
s weekend, the 2010
t A title isn't the only
it will be defending. The
i inu. z Cardinal will look to ex
tend its NCAA-record home
winning streak to an eye-pop
ping 180 consecutive matches

when the first and second
rounds of the NCAAs com
mence this weekend at the
Taube Family Tennis Center.
The undefeated Cardinal
(23-0, 8-0 Pac-10) has not par
ticipated in a regular-season
match since its victory over No.
9 Cal on April 16. Other than an
exhibition against the USTA
Junior National Team and the
Pac-10 individual tournament,

the Cardinal has focused solely
on what's been dubbed by some
as May Madness.
Senior Carolyn McVeigh,
who will be starting in her
fourth and final NCAA cham
pionship, talked about the type
of preparation required to re

peat as national champions.
"We've been trying to strike
the right balance between prac
ticing hard and staying fresh,''
she said. "It's almost two
straight weeks of intense

fVilkj I 'Jlili


matches, so we've been saving up
our energy while honing in on our
individual games."
McVeigh said that the girls have
been battling each other to augment
their practices.
"We've been playing a lot of
practice sets to keep match mentali
ty alive," she said. "Live points al
ways contribute to slight pressure
situations, helping us stay focused."
The top-seeded Cardinal steps
out to face Illinois-Chicago (18-4,8-
0 Horizon League) on Saturday in
the first round. The Flames, who just
won their 15th straight conference
championship, will be making their
13th straight NCAA Tournament
appearance.
McVeigh admitted that she has
little knowledge of Illinois-Chica
go's players, but that she will stick to
her normal on-court warm-up rou
tine.
"It's all about adjusting. I tend to
move my ball around and try to de
cipher [my opponent's] strengths
and weaknesses," she said. "It's hard
because girls' rally balls might be dif
ferent from their live balls. Mostly,
we try to focus on our own games."
On match day, McVeigh said that
she and her teammates are always
focusing on maximizing perform
ance.
"We are in constant preparation,
but on match day we wake up at
least four hours before we play, have
breakfast together, get a light hit in,
decompress, organize equipment,
get hydrated," she said. "It's eating,
sleeping, hitting, eating, hitting and
even some tennis dreaming."
The other teams that will be play
ing at Stanford's site will be No. 27
Pepperdine (14-7, 6-0 WCC) and
No. 36 Long Beach State (20-5,10-1
Big West), who will meet before the
Cardinal's match on Saturday morn
ing the winners of the two Satur
day matches will meet at noon on
Sunday in the second round.
Match play will run as usual,
with three doubles matches played
for the first point followed by six si
multaneous singles matches worth
one point each. As the NCAA
Tournament is a single-elimination
format, it's win or go home for the
64 competing teams. Sixteen are
seeded, meaning there are 16 dif
ferent locations for the first and

second rounds with four teams
playing at each.
Stanford's home advantage
could prove tremendous, as the Car
dinal women have won 179 consecu
tive home matches as well as 42
straight matches overall.
The streak has certainly been on
the minds of McVeigh and her team
mates.
"It's definitely inspiring," she
said. "We'll have our family and
friends in the stands, but we can't
take any team lightly. Some of the
country's best have their bull's-eye
on us and will try to take us down."
Freshman Nicole Gibbs, who an
chors the middle of the lineup,
added to McVeigh's sentiments.

"Playing in front of all of my
classmates will give me that much
more fire on court," she said. "It's a
special experience to play NCAAs
as a freshman and competing on our
home courts."
Gibbs was confident that the
team's supporters would respond
and come out in force for the
NCAAs.
"I have them rallied," she said.
Long Beach State and Pepper
dine will kick off the first round at 9
a.m. at Taube Family Tennis Center
on Saturday morning. Stanford faces
Illinois-Chicago at noon.
