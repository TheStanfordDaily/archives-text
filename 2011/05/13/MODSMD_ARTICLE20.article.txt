## Freshman Brown accepts invite to USA U-19 World Championship Training Camp 
### – Wyndam Makowsky 
Freshman guard/forward Anthony Brown
was invited to and will attend the USA Men's
U-19 World Championship Training Camp
next month. He will join 16 of the nation's top
basketball players aged 19 years or younger, all
of whom are competing for a spot on the 12-
person squad that will play at the 2011 FIB A
U-19 World Championship.
Brown, a four-star recruit in 2010, made
the Pac-10 All-Freshman Team after averag
ing 8.7 points and 3.2 rebounds a game in his
first season. He came on strong toward the
end of the year, beginning with a breakout 21-
point, eight-rebound performance against
Oregon State in the middle of Pac-10 play.
With the departure of Jeremy Green to the
NBA, Brown will be expected to take on a
greater —if not primary scoring role in

the 2011-2012 season.
Brown will not be the Pac-10's only repre
sentative at the camp. Cal's Allen Crabbe
the conference's freshman of the year and
Richard Solomon will be there, as will current
high school senior and Arizona commit Josiah
Turner.
The weeklong camp will take place in Col
orado Springs, Colo, at the U.S. Olympic Train
ing Center from June 17-24. The team will be
selected almost immediately after, as the
World Championships begin June 30 in Latvia.
