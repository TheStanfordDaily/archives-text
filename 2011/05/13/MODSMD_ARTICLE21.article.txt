Pac-10 Championships in Tucson, Ariz. The
men's team enters the event ranked at No. 12 in

the country, while the women's team is unranked.
The men's team, which last won a confer
ence title in 2002, will rely on a core of talented
runners to boost its point totals. The team's
best events are the distance races, where junior
Chris Derrick will defend his titles in the 5,000
and 10,000 meters. Senior Elliott Heath is ex
pected to contend as well, after winning the
NCAA indoor title in the 3,000 meters.
Though the women's team is ranked behind
several Pac-10 opponents, it will send several
field event standouts to Arizona. Junior Kate
rina Stefanidi will defend her title in the pole
vault. In the running events, the Cardinal's best
hope for success is senior distance runner
Stephanie Marcy.
The running events will start on Friday
evening, with the field events and the remain
