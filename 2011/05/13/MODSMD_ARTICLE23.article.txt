# English response to FIFA too late
## 
### Tom Taylor 
On Tuesday, the UK gov
ernment held a parlia
mentary committee to
investigate how soccer is
being run in England and
why London's bid for the 2018 FIFA
World Cup failed so dismally. Stealing the
headlines were serious allegations made
by the former head of the English Foot
ball Association (FA), Lord Triesman,
about corruption up to the very highest
level of the world governing body.
This news won't have been viewed
kindly by the global powers of the game.
Though current MI A President Sepp
Blatter promised swift action for any
proven wrongdoing, both he and rival
Mohamed bin Hammam will be far more
focused on winning the upcoming FIFA
presidential election in June and would
be happy to put this all behind them. And
it's not as if bin Hammam can use this to
strengthen the case for his candidacy, be
cause his own country of Qatar won the
right to host the 2022 World Cup under
serious allegations of fraud.
In England, fans won't exactly be
happy with the news not much will
make up for losing the right to hold the
World Cup but they'll surely feel a bit
of delight at the thought of some of the
biggest names in soccer politics being
made to squirm. Many feel that FIFA has
long shunned the birthplace of the game,
even to the point that Blatter once made
the ludicrous claim that the origins of soc
cer lie not in England, but in China. No
one can seriously claim to have invented
the concept of kicking a ball around
that's like saying you invented the wheel,
or fire but it is an indisputable histori
cal fact that the rules of this game were
formulated in England.
Of course, Blatter seems to court con
troversy on many topics, once arguing
that women's soccer would be improved
by the players wearing tighter shorts.
It's hard not to feel this is all too little,
too late. According to the allegations,
members of the FIFA executive commit
tee asked the FA chief for bribes to win
their support. A clearer-cut case of cor
ruption would be hard to find, and if true,
the question has to be asked why nothing
was done back then, before the climax of
the bidding process in December. The
college equivalent would be like sitting
through a final exam watching all those
around you blatantly cheating, but keep
ing quiet, trusting in the system. Would it
really be a big surprise when you get your
final grade and find you've fallen signifi
cantly behind the curve?
The harsh truth might just be that the
FA was happy enough to go along with a
rigged election and just underestimated
the necessary lengths (and money) need
ed to win that way. During the drawn-out
process, the English team suffered the
embarrassment of having the seemingly
innocuous gifts of a few handbags to ex
ecutive committee members sent back
over suspicions that they constituted
bribery, and there had reportedly been
offers of invitations to the recent Royal
wedding. Compared to the millions of
dollars quoted in the recent allegations,
those "bribes" are almost laughable.
If England is truly the motherland of
soccer, it needs to start acting like it.
When your child starts hanging out
with a bad crowd of people and doing
things you don't approve of, it's not
just a parental right but a responsibil
ity to be brutally honest. Going along
with the flow or sitting back and doing
nothing just isn't good enough
sometimes you have to be cruel to be
kind.
Had the English FA taken a stand
during the bidding process either
exposing these allegations or perhaps
threatening to drop out in protest
it may not have changed the result,
but it would surely have had far
greater impact. Now it just comes
across as the losing side being bitter,
and while us fans are undoubtedly

upset, it's hard not to feel there might
be some truth behind this. There is no
smoke without fire, and the heads of
FIFA, like most politicians elsewhere,
are certainly no saints.
When the tiny desert state of
Qatar won the right to host the World
Cup, it was a victory for real fans
everywhere. Not because of any de
serving reason like a storied soccer
history, large fan base or infrastruc
ture suitable for such a massive un
dertaking (the 2010 World Cup Final
was viewed by 700 million households
worldwide), but because the absence
of those attributes from Qatar's bid
highlighted the flaws in the selection
process far more than these recent
English claims of misconduct have.

An Englishman through-and
through, Tom Taylor was one of the
handbag designers whose gifts to the
FIFA were sent back. What he won't

tell you is that the committee mem
bers weren't concerned about bribery
they just found his designs dread
ful. To judge for yourself contact him

When your child starts hanging out
with a bad crowd of people and doing
things you don't approve of, it's not
just a parental right but a responsibil
ity to be brutally honest. Going along
with the flow or sitting back and doing
nothing just isn't good enough
sometimes you have to be cruel to be
kind.
Had the English FA taken a stand
during the bidding process either
exposing these allegations or perhaps
threatening to drop out in protest
it may not have changed the result,
but it would surely have had far
greater impact. Now it just comes
across as the losing side being bitter,
and while us fans are undoubtedly

upset, it's hard not to feel there might
be some truth behind this. There is no
smoke without fire, and the heads of
FIFA, like most politicians elsewhere,
are certainly no saints.
When the tiny desert state of
Qatar won the right to host the World
Cup, it was a victory for real fans
everywhere. Not because of any de
serving reason like a storied soccer
history, large fan base or infrastruc
ture suitable for such a massive un
dertaking (the 2010 World Cup Final
was viewed by 700 million households
worldwide), but because the absence
of those attributes from Qatar's bid
highlighted the flaws in the selection
process far more than these recent
English claims of misconduct have.

An Englishman through-and
through, Tom Taylor was one of the
handbag designers whose gifts to the
FIFA were sent back. What he won't

tell you is that the committee mem
bers weren't concerned about bribery
they just found his designs dread
ful. To judge for yourself contact him
