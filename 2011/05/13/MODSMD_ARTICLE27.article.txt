## AWESOMELY BAD MOVIES 
### 
The quarters swiftly coming to an end, and times are defi
nitely hectic. With everyone knee-deep in midterms and
papers and finals looming ominously on the horizon, it's
naturally the perfect time to do some heavy procrastinat
ing. If your brain's burnt out and you're in dire need of
some mindless entertainment, check out Intermission's list
of so-bad-they're-good movies.

"The Room"
Tommy Wiseau's 2003 masterpiece still holds the unofficial
crown of "Worst Movie Ever Made."

"Big Trouble in Little China"
Kurt Russell helps his sidekick rescue his mail-order bride
from the evil Lo Pan, a sorcerer who must marry a green
eyed girl to achieve immortality. This is a movie that's really
only awesomely bad because of its ridiculous special effects.
Wait for the part when a henchman gets so frustrated, he lit
erally explodes.

"Orphan"
Most. Preposterous. Plot. Twist. Ever. We really wish we could
tell you but seriously, watch it for yourself.

"Leprechaun: Back 2 Tha Hood"
Intermission was lucky enough to catch a viewing of this on
BET one lazy afternoon. Warwick Davis (aka Professor
Flitwick) plays a malicious leprechaun seeking revenge on the
"urban youths" who stole his gold.

"Mac & Me"
If movie product placement
has any redeeming qualities,
you won't find them in this
cheap "E.T." knock off. At
one point, a kid in a wheel
chair rolls off a cliff. 'Nuff
said.
