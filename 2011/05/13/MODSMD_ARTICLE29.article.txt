## 
### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
On May 10, producer and
director Andy Fickman
visited Stanford and
offered students rare inside tips
on how to break into the film
industry. Famous for his work on
well-known films like "She's the
Man" with Amanda Bynes and
"You Again" starring Kristen Bell,
Fickman imparted funny and
candid advice on how to survive
Hollywood.
A clip that was played before
the talk showed Fickman being
goofy and enthusiastic on the set
of "You Again" a presence he
immediately brought to the room
as he spoke to students.
Fickman acknowledged how
as a director, it can be hard to
choose between directing inde
pendent films, like his work on
the Emmy-winning "Reefer
Madness," or films helmed by
large Hollywood studios, like
"She's the Man." When asked,
however, which he preferred
more, he answered simply, "I'm a
director. 1 love directing."
As far as life in Hollywood
goes, Fickman was honest, warn

ing students who wanted to break
into the industry, "You have to
love it, because it will kick your
ass every day. You're literally going
to an organization that will never
want you." He noted that even
established actors and directors
can have a hard time finding
work, and new people flow into
the business every day looking for
their big break, creating a highly
competitive environment.
He also addressed how the
film industry is struggling to han
dle the prevalence of Netflix and
movie streaming. "Nothing scares
Hollywood more," Fickman said.
He pointed out that Hollywood
has weathered previous techno
logical developments from
TVs to DVDs while remaining
a billion-dollar industry.
However, DVD sales have been
dropping and studios are forced
to adjust. Fickman predicts that
eventually budgets for movies will
shrink since returns will drop. He
noted that Hollywood studios are
likely to cut personnel as well,
though he thinks they will survive
by simply selling more new tech

nology to consumers like the
recent 3-D TV craze.
Despite the hardships the
industry faces, Fickman's love of
the craft shone through. When
discussing how he got the role of
director for "She's the Man," he
explained that he could not just
sell himself as someone who
could direct a teen movie he
had to explain his love and
knowledge of everything from
Shakespeare to John Hughes to
sports movies to convince the stu
dio he had the background for
just that one film.
He gave everyone similar
advice to succeed: "See every
movie. Read every book. Lose any
ego you have." He encouraged
people to view their work in
Hollywood not as a career, but an
artistic journey. Fickman's bright,
hilarious presence is certainly
proof that such a journey in
Hollywood can be fun and
worthwhile.
