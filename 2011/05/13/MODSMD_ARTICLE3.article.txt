## BRINGING IT HOME STANFORD HOSTS ARMY IN TOURNEY OPENER 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The NCAA Championships have finally arrived on
the Farm, as the eighth-seeded Stanford men's tennis
team begins its postseason journey on its home court
today with a matchup against Army.
It's been an up-and-down season for the Cardinal.
Stanford jumped out to a hot start with a 7-0 record, then
lost five of six matches in its toughest stretch of the sea
son only to end on a 10-game winning streak, finishing
18-5 overall and 5-1 in Pac-10 play.
Head coach John Whitlinger's team hopes to carry
the momentum of its current winning streak into the
NCAAs and is excited to get back on the courts after
nearly a month since its last match, when the Cardinal
defeated then-No. 15 Cal on April 23.
Whitlinger says his team is ready to go.
"We're anxious to get back into a dual match situa
tion, and guys are fired up that we get to host the first
and second round," he said.

It won't be an easy start, as the visiting Army squad is
also coming in hot the Black Knights have won 12 of
their last 16 matches, earning the Patriot League's auto
matic berth to the NCAAs by winning the conference
tournament.

The Black Knights (13-11, 7-0 Patriot League)
haven't had much top-level competition this season
Stanford will be the first ranked team they've played all
year. In contrast, 20 of the Cardinal's 23 matches have
been against ranked opponents.
But Whitlinger is unwilling to look past this first match.
When asked what worries him most about the matchup,
Whitlinger highlighted his unfamiliarity with the Army
squad the Black Knights aren't a team that Stanford
has played recently.
"I don't know a lot about them to be honest,"
Whitlinger said. "I know they're one of the 64 teams and
therefore a strong team, but I don't know a lot of
specifics about their players. I do know their coach [Jim
Poling], and he's a great teacher so I know he'll have
them ready to play that's for sure. We just have to
make sure we are as well."
The Stanford men have a rich history in the NCAA
Tournament, with 17 team titles and a number of singles
