## BRINGING IT HOME STANFORD HOSTS ARMY IN TOURNEY OPENER 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The NCAA Championships have finally arrived on
the Farm, as the eighth-seeded Stanford men's tennis
team begins its postseason journey on its home court
today with a matchup against Army.
It's been an up-and-down season for the Cardinal.
Stanford jumped out to a hot start with a 7-0 record, then
lost five of six matches in its toughest stretch of the sea
son only to end on a 10-game winning streak, finishing
18-5 overall and 5-1 in Pac-10 play.
Head coach John Whitlinger's team hopes to carry
the momentum of its current winning streak into the
NCAAs and is excited to get back on the courts after
nearly a month since its last match, when the Cardinal
defeated then-No. 15 Cal on April 23.
Whitlinger says his team is ready to go.
"We're anxious to get back into a dual match situa
tion, and guys are fired up that we get to host the first
and second round," he said.

It won't be an easy start, as the visiting Army squad is
also coming in hot the Black Knights have won 12 of
their last 16 matches, earning the Patriot League's auto
matic berth to the NCAAs by winning the conference
tournament.

The Black Knights (13-11, 7-0 Patriot League)
haven't had much top-level competition this season
Stanford will be the first ranked team they've played all
year. In contrast, 20 of the Cardinal's 23 matches have
been against ranked opponents.
But Whitlinger is unwilling to look past this first match.
When asked what worries him most about the matchup,
Whitlinger highlighted his unfamiliarity with the Army
squad the Black Knights aren't a team that Stanford
has played recently.
"I don't know a lot about them to be honest,"
Whitlinger said. "I know they're one of the 64 teams and
therefore a strong team, but I don't know a lot of
specifics about their players. I do know their coach [Jim
Poling], and he's a great teacher so I know he'll have
them ready to play that's for sure. We just have to
make sure we are as well."
The Stanford men have a rich history in the NCAA
Tournament, with 17 team titles and a number of singles
and doubles titles to boot. The team
hasn't taken home the ultimate
prize since 2000, but is confident
going into this tournament not
only is Stanford peaking at the right
time and riding a ten-game winning
streak, but the Cardinal will enjoy
home advantage throughout the
entire tournament. Stanford has a
13-1 record atTaube this season.
Whitlinger was cautious about
reading too much into the benefits
of hosting the tournament, but ad
mitted it will be a factor.
"You always feel good when you
have a lot of people pulling for you,
that's for sure," Whitlinger said. "I
know that when we do get a decent
crowd here they pull for you hard,
and it pumps you up as a player...
and it pumps you up as a coach.
"It might make a little difference
here and there," Whitlinger contin
ued. "In a certain point or a certain
match, when things aren't going
your way, when something happens
on the court that gets the crowd
going and gets you going, it can only
help us. It definitely can't hurt us, so
we're looking forward to it."
Whitlinger admitted to taking a
quick look at the Cardinal's draw
if Stanford defeats Army, it will
go on to face the winner of Cal Poly
vs. Washington. Other dangerous
opponents Stanford could face in
the first few rounds include No.l
seeded Virginia and No. 9-seeded
Texas A&M.
"I've been telling the guys not to
look ahead too far, but you can take
a peek a little," he said. "It's a tough
road for sure. I don't know about
Army, but I know that if we happen
to get by them, we barely got by
Washington up in Seattle. They're a
very excellent team, and Cal Poly is
having a good year, so whoever
comes out of that match, it will be a
challenge.
"And then if you look beyond
that you get, potentially, the nine
seed and the one-seed," he said.
"It's not an easy road, but it's the
road we've been given and it's a
road we're looking forward to go
on."
Stanford starts its championship
push at 2 p.m. this afternoon against
Army.

road for sure. I don't know about
Army, but I know that if we happen
to get by them, we barely got by
Washington up in Seattle. They're a
very excellent team, and Cal Poly is
having a good year, so whoever
comes out of that match, it will be a
challenge.
"And then if you look beyond
that you get, potentially, the nine

"It's not an easy road, but it's the
road we've been given and it's a
road we're looking forward to go
on."
Stanford starts its championship
push at 2 p.m. this afternoon against
Army.
