Baguettes, introduced into Vietnam during
French rule, were originally reserved for
the rich, who would dip them into sweet
ened condensed milk. Eventually, the bread was
culinarily repurposed from bank toy, or "foreign
cake," into bank mi, or "wheat cake," to serve as
the scaffolding for the delectable street food com
prised of mayonnaise, pate, ham and a variety of
other variegated ingredients. For an equally suc
cessful transformation into multicultural fusion
cuisine, a restaurant needs to cherry pick the
most delicious ingredients and effective cooking
techniques. Madame Tarn Gourmet Asian Bistro
provides pan-Asian cuisine that poaches the right
ideas from a variety of cultures but is unable to
produce a particularly memorable experience.
The restaurant has an understated and wel
coming decor filled with earthen tones. A narrow
setup can produce a bit of commotion and makes
it serve best as an upscale but not fancy dinner
among friends.
There are some dishes that are fairly solid.
The Caviar Tuna Tartare, for example, is a bright
and colorful dish that is an excellent starter to
share. The salmon roe can overwhelm the subtle
ty of the tuna, though, in part because the avoca
do and cucumber bedding seems to be an overly
ambitious understudy, resulting in a bit of a
dearth of tuna. The Grapefruit Jicama Salad is
strong as well. The meatiness of the walnuts, the
burst of the grapefruit, the satisfying crunch of
the jicama and cabbage they all come together
in a refreshingly light salad. The Salt and Pepper
Fresh Dungeness Crab is delicious and worth the
work it takes to fish out the meat (excuse the
pun). At times, though, the texture and flavor,

especially when combined with the sauteed
onions, can be very reminiscent of liver and
onions, which is an unfortunate relationship.
Much of the rest of the menu, however, is
fairly mediocre. The Seafood Cellophane
Noodles, similar to Pad Thai, are tasty without
being too salty. The mushrooms pick up some of
the slack where the shrimp seems to have gotten
lazy, and in the end, a pleasing yet unremarkable
plate emerges. On the other hand, the Tamarind
Prawns are quite good, but they are served on a
completely uninspired garnish. The Korean BBQ
Beef Short Ribs have the savory sweetness to be
expected from the tradition, but the meat does
not fall apart as it should and ends up too chewy.
The Claypot Chicken is certainly not bad, but it is
entirely forgettable. Similarly, the Mango Papaya
Salad is fun to eat but nothing special at all.
And some of the menu is a clear miss. I was
shocked to receive the Vegetarian Noodle Pho
without a heaping pile of basil; mistakes happen.
Regardless, the flavor profile of the broth is not
particularly nuanced or interesting; it has a
straightforward, savory monotone to it.
Furthermore, the flavor profile of the broth is not

Buddha's Vegetarian Imperial Rolls lack any excite
ment. There is not enough crunch from the jicama
or taro, producing a mouthfeel that is just off.
Madam Tarns is a good option for a group of
friends looking for Asian food but unable to decide
on exactly what. The menu offers a deep roster of
decent options with influences from across
Southeast Asia against a mainly Thai and

Vietnamese backdrop. However, there are no real
standout plates that make the restaurant spectacu
lar. The bistro ends up in the "middle of the road."
