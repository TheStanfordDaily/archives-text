Walking through the black curtain
and into the Oak Room at
Tresidder last Saturday, Stanford
students were transported to a 1930s
cabaret. Scattered among rows of black
chairs was the occasional bleached-blonde
wig draped over the back or stiletto sticking
out from beneath the black rungs.
Genderfuk has been hosted by the
Queer-Straight Alliance for over 10 years.
The theme of this year's event was
Victor/Victoria, inspired by the 1980s cult
film of the same name.

"Genderfuk 2011 specif
ically focuses on finding both
internal and external beauty
and acknowledging the full
gender and sexuality spec
trum," explained Nathaniel
Williams 'l3, event coordina
tor and MC for the night. "It
also dually serves as a chance
to continue a long-time
LGBT tradition of drag and
performance."

At Genderfuk, people played with and
transcended the confines of gender. Men
and women alike dressed in drag, freely
challenging traditional gender norms. The
wide range of extravagant costumes was
well received by the students, and compli
ments reverberated through the night.

Many of the students said that they enjoyed
the event, and the sheer numbers of enthu
siastic students packed into the room con
firmed this.
"The Queer-Straight Alliance is dedi
cated to hosting events that increase aware
ness and visibility for queer and LGBT
identified students," Williams said. "Also,
our events are intended to help educate
others and help them become more com
plete allies to our respective communities."
With rainbow flags hung around the
DJ station and makeshift stage, Genderfuk

achieved just that. Student
groups Arabesque and Catch
a Fyah held short perform
ances, and Arabesque even
provided a belly-dancing
tutorial to the eager audience.
As the night progressed, the
stage (d) evolved into a dance
floor, but the camaraderie
and openness of the event
prevailed.
"We wanted each and

every guest to leave feeling individually
affirmed and enlightened within a larger
sense of community," Williams said.
