## Shakespeare (kind of) in the park: 'As You Like It' 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
The usual connotations of spring include
merriment, courtship and green growing
things and the Stanford Shakespeare
Company's spring show includes generous help
ings of all three. The troupe mounts an ambi
tious production of the Bard's popular romantic
comedy "As You Like It" in the wooded grove
immediately west of the Oval. The usually non
descript clearing is transformed by a cascade of
lights, a set of ornate trellises and a rope-and
plank swing attached to a convenient tree. It was
an inspired choice of location; the set, coupled
with the dramatic lighting design, renders a con
vincing analogue of the Forest of Arden, adding

a dimension of realism to the production that
would have been difficult to achieve on a con
ventional stage.
The actors, of course, take full advantage of
the given space. The realities of Rosalind's (Ellie
Oates 'l4) flight, and Celia's (Sunny Huang 'l4)
impulsive decision to join her, quickly become
apparent as Celia vents her frustrations on the
forest floor and kicks up clouds of dust in the
process. The wrestler Charles (Philip Balliet 'l2)
and his young challenger Orlando de Bois
(David Raymond 'l3) pound each other into
real dirt. Multiple actors step onto the swing
when delivering especially impish lines, and

Jaques' (Alex Connolly l l 1) famous "All the
world's a stage" monologue is particularly
engaging, not to mention one of the more
risque renditions, as he demonstrates the seven
stages of life upon his companions, going so far
as to send one of them scrambling backwards
across a log.
One of the Company's greatest strengths is
the effortless chemistry between its actors, which
has only improved since "Julius Caesar" last quar
ter. Especially in such a bawdy and unabashedly
physical production, intra-troupe dynamics can
make or break the experience and StanShakes
did marvelously. Each romance in the play has a
unique flavor, which is no mean feat, considering
that "As You Like It" features not one, but four
(and a half) courtships. The protagonists Orlando
and Rosalind's true love is convincing despite the
inevitable difficulties of Shakespearian gender
bending; Oates's spontaneity and deviousness are
wonderfully counterbalanced by Raymond's com
pelling earnestness. Oliver (Philip Bowen '11) and
Celia's whirlwind love-at-first-sight hits the audi
ence out of nowhere, which was actually the
Bard's intention not to mention that the actors'
loud and emphatic styles of acting match each
other, and their roles, very well. Touchstone (Kevin
Hurlbutt'l4) and Audrey's (Camille Brown'l4)
over-the-top sensuality is a constant source of
comic relief. And the love triangle of Silvius (Joe
Camp '11), Phebe (Erika Harrell '11) and

Rosalind's male persona, "Ganymede," is equal
parts pathetic, uncomfortable and hilarious, just as
it should be.
In addition to talented acting, the play comes
alive through a number of campy-but-cute mod
ernizations which Shakespeare himself might well
have countenanced. The costumes, for example,
involved the layering of doublets and bodices over
what appear to be hand-dyed dresses and shirts.
Equally innovative was the incorporation of
music, in the form of faux-drunken carousing and
guitar-accompanied verse.
Were it not for fire regulations, one could
easily imagine a bonfire arising in this Forest of
Arden, with the exiles holding sing-alongs, a la
Robin Hood's merry band. These contemporary
details help render the play readily accessible to a
modern audience, although given the actors'
expressivity and enthusiasm, they are just icing
on the cake.
The Stanford Shakespeare Company's rep
utation for excellence is well-deserved, and "As
You Like It" is no exception.
'As You Like It" runs through Sunday, May 15, at
8:15 p.m. each evening.
