Age, as it often does to many
great performers, has hard
ened Stevie Nicks' voice.
Time has made her sound raspier,
guttural. With her husky croon, she
was once capable of being sad and
seductive in the same breath. Behind
her steely, no-bullshit exterior were
hints of delicacy, melancholy and
childlike vulnerability. Yet the overly
nasal Stevie Nicks of today has none
of the texture of her "Gold Dust

Woman" or "Sara." Now, she just
sounds downright garish, a reality all
too present in the artist's first album
in nearly a decade "In Your Dreams."
There has always been some
thing slightly mystical about Stevie,
yet her klutzy, rather simplistic song
writing reeks of the kind of New Age
drivel you'd expect of an aging diva.
The album's opening track, "Secret
Love," was originally written by
Nicks during Fleetwood Mac's gold
en "Rumours" period. Glossed over
with easy-listening niceties, the song
sounds a bit embarrassing. Nicks'

best songs have manipulated the

haunting, banshee-like quality of her
voice, yet there is nothing that is as
precisely eerie about her here. In
songs like "Secret Love," the awful
"Wide Sargasso Sea" and "New
Orleans," you can feel her voice des
perately straining for some sort of
nuance under its heavy weight. She
tries boy, does she try but
Nicks can't achieve the kind of frail,
tremulous wonder her voice was
once capable of capturing.
The angelic precision of Nicks'
voice is altogether absent from the
album. There's no trace of that
slightly prurient, little princess voice
that matured into a robust, gruff
hum in such tracks as the titular "In
Your Dreams" or "Annabel Lee."
These songs have an odd country
club feel to them that feels entirely
inappropriate for Nicks. If anything,
this sort of fast-paced, jive-y rhythm

makes Nicks' basic vocal inefficien
cies appear more pronounced. Gone
are the days of the poetic, aching bal
lads with which Stevie used to haunt
us. Instead, we're now left with cheap
nostalgia in the form of "Italian
Summer," in which the lyrics " The
wind blows through yon/It tears you
apart" have all the subtlety of a
sledgehammer.
The album's best track, unsur
prisingly, is one which Nicks penned
with fellow Fleetwood Mac alum
Lindsey Buckingham, "Soldier's
Angel." Equal parts bitter and seduc
tive, the song has some of the bite of
the group's best works, with Nicks'
voice in top form. Furthermore,
"Ghosts are Gone" has some of the
charge of Nicks' work from her
"Belladonna" period she is power
ful, commanding and completely
rapturous.

It's useless to pine for the Stevie
Nicks who is now gone and, in
particular, to view her new album as
a platform for doing so. Maybe it's a
blessing that we get the real Stevie
just a week after horrendous "Glee"
cover versions of "Rumours" pollut
ed our psyche. Yet I can't help but
think back to the more intriguing,
complex Stevie the world once knew
when confronted with the banalities
of this elevator music. Some of the
tracks on the album are pleasant. A
few are even catchy. But "pleasant"
and "catchy" are never words one
should use to describe Stevie Nicks.
