On Saturday, May 7,
Everyday People went
back to the basics with
their spring show, Throwback in
Black. True to its name, the show
paid tribute to Everyday People
traditions, performing pieces that
were arranged and sung by for
mer members of the group.

The show consisted of a fan
tastic mix of the classics and more
modern pieces but with a twist.
The entire group incorporated a jazzy
and soulful spin on traditional pieces Eke
Ben E King's "Stand By Me" and AEcia
Keyss "It's a Mans Mans World/FalEri'
In addition to showcasing the
group's harmonious sound, the
spring show gave members the
opportunity to display their indi
vidual talent through solos through
riveting covers of Coldplay's "The
Scientist" and Adele's "Hometown
Glory."
"It took us all year to put this
together. The Everyday People
spring show showcases a diverse
group of people with a diverse
group of voices," said Shawnee
Baughman 'l2. "This coming
together creates a soulful sound
that can reach any audience."
"Everyday People is full of
people with a passion for music
and singing," said Emily Mann
'l3. "The spring show lets us
share that passion with others."
Though Everyday People's
spring show represents the cul
mination of a successful year, the
show also was meant to celebrate
the soon-to-be graduating sen
iors in the group. After presenting
them with bouquets of flowers, the
entire group joined together with
Everyday People alumni to perform
an upbeat rendition of Sly & the
Family Stone's "Everyday People."
Throwback in Black was a
true glimpse into what Everyday
People is all about passion,
creativity and true love of music.
