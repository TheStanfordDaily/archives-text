## 'BRIDESMAIDS': DELICATE FLOWERS THEY ARE NOT

cc ■ ■v ridesmaids" is not a
I— l C romantic comedy. Sure,
a comedy, and I'll
grant that romance may make an
appearance, but protagonist Annie
(Kristen Wiig) is no traditional rom
com heroine: regardless of whether
she gets her guy, she doesn't need
him. It's less about how a lonely girl
is saved by her Prince Charming, and
more about how a hot mess of a
maid of honor navigates the murky
waters of friendship and manages to

save herself. Above all, though, it's a
story about girl love, equipped with
all the heart-warming appeal of
Apatow's classic bromance but with a
female cast (Is there a term for that?
A girlmance?).
It's immediately obvious the
screenplay was written by women
the heroines aren't the traditional
"quirky!" female leads you'd find in
any Kate Hudson or Katherine Heigl
romcom. Where most women in
these sorts of movies are sweet and

silly in a controlled, effortlessly
attractive way, these characters are
full of actual flaws (though I did
choke a bit listening to the rail-thin
Kristen Wiig complain that her rival
was skinnier than her).
"Bridesmaids" isn't afraid to reveal
that ladies aren't exactly the delicate
flowers Hollywood so often portrays
them as (I know, spoiler alert, right?),
but still manages to avoid the carica
turized "strong female character"
trope. Annie isn't Cinderella, but she

isn't Lara Croft, either.
The movie's strength is in its
characters. Each of the bridesmaids is
fantastic: Wendi McLendon-Covey's
Rita (a crude, jaded housewife) and
Ellie Kemper's Becca (a saccharine
sweet newlywed) have an absurd rap
port. And Rose Byrne's Lillian, that
one impossibly flawless friend you
can't stand, perfects the craft of
snooty one-upmanship.
"SNL" vets Kristen Wiig and
Maya Rudolph have fantastic on
screen chemistry, probably from
years of performing together on the
live sketch show. Some of the most
hilarious scenes in the movie flow
effordessly thanks to the pair's natu
ral camaraderie.
Other great bits to look out for
include Wiig's drug-and-alcohol
induced breakdown on a plane;
Annie's snotty but clueless room
mates and above all else, every
ridiculous over-the-top event
planned by Annie's archrival Helen.
However, like many Apatow
movies, the movie took the low road
with a couple of jokes, namely a
scene in which the bridesmaids get
food poisoning at the same time and
proceed to vomit on each other and
violently excrete into a sink it
probably could have been done with
a little more class. The film set the
scene up well but lingered just a few
moments too long.
At the end of the day,
"Bridesmaids" is as funny as any
other Apatow bromance, using the
traditional formula but evading the
sort of been-there-done-that vibe
that his movies have been giving off
as of late thanks to the female per
spective. However, it's definitely a
flick worth viewing for both girls and
guys.
