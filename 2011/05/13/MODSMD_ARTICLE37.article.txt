# A 						TALK WITH TAUBA
## THE 						STANFORD ALUM IS THE ART WORLD'S RISING STAR 
### â€” alex FIALHO contact alex: afialho@stanford. edu 
In a recent interview, you said that you have
always thought of yourself as an artist. Did
you ever consider attending a more traditional
arts school, and what eventually inspired you
to attend Stanford? Is there anything in partic
ular that you learned in your undergraduate
years that still resonates with you either per
sonally or in your practice?
TA: I considered it, but then decided I wanted
to have access to other things besides great art
resources. I think it was the right decision for
me, but in away I wasted the opportunity
because on a day-to-day basis, I just kept choos
ing painting over everything else. I wish I could
go back and take some of the classes at Stanford
that I didn't make time for. I've actually
watched some of them on the Internet in the
past few years, particularly a modern physics
class that I've always regretted dropping.

The content of your work often foregrounds
language, particularly through handwriting,
typography, and fonts. What drives your inter
est in these forms? And in an increasingly digi
tal age, do you view the waning importance of
the written word with a sense of nostalgia, or
perhaps inevitably?
TA: I'm not nostalgic about things like hand
writing or hand-set typography, I just think
they are beautiful and still wonderfully useful.
In the past, I took sort of a Luddite's position
against digital technology, but I've changed my
mind about that. I use a computer all the time
now, and I'm totally enchanted with what is
possible in that realm.

Who do you consider your primary audience?
Do you worry about the accessibility of your
work, and if so, how do you reconcile these
worries with the need to challenge yourself
conceptually?
TA: Wow, that is a tough question. It's so hard
to know how other people see you or your
work. It seems impossible to really understand
that objectively. But when I think about what I
want to have come across, I know that I want
the things I make to exist right on the line
dividing the accessible and the difficult to pen
etrate. Too far in the accessible direction and
the work doesn't stay compelling for very long;
it's apprehended, and then there is nothing else
to think or wonder about, but work that is too
opaque can be ungenerous and almost hostile.
I suppose I simply want my work to keep giv
ing the more you think about it.

Who outside of the visual arts inspires you?
I was recently really inspired while reading
about John Milnor. I'm trying to learn about
topology, and he just won the Abel Prize for his
work in that area.
As a long time Bay Area resident, are there any
"can't miss" arts locations that are a bit off the
beaten track?
TA: Steven Leiber's basement.
