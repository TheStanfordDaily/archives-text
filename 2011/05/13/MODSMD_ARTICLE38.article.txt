## Mixed Co. to provide murderous entertainment 
### â€” william DOOLEY contact william: wdooley@stanford. edu 
If sex and violence are the cornerstones of
American entertainment, Mixed Co. got
the message loud and clear.
Following last quarter's highly successful lin
gerie-clad "Love Sucks" show, Stanford's oldest co
ed a cappella group returns tonight with the com
ically gruesome "Murder at Mixed Co. Manor."

The show starts at 8 p.m. in Toyon Lounge
"Murder" kicks off with a decapitation in
the first 10 minutes and never looks back. One
by one, members get killed off in creative and
hilarious ways, ratcheting up the suspense in a
traditional whodunit.
"No other show has as many gruesome
deaths, including 'Sweeney Todd,"' joked Peter
Pham 'l3. "We provide equal opportunity death.
Also, we sing sometimes."
The music is obviously any a cappella

show's raison d'etre, and thankfully, president
Jessica Asperger 'l3 assures us that the group is
"loaded with vocal talent." That talent and
enthusiasm will be unleashed on current pop
staples such as "Battlefield" by Jordin Sparks and
"Black and Gold" by Sam Sparrow, as well as
classics such as "Somebody to Love" by Queen.
But Asperger hopes that the show will add
up to something even more.
"What's cool about our show is that, unlike
other a cappella groups, we try and put on a full

show. There is a plot, there are costumes and we
try and make songs fit into a larger narrative. It's
more of a full experience."
"You will be hard pressed to find a show
that will make you laugh, cry and leave you
aurally satisfied," Pham added. "Ours will."
If that's not enough, you should also "come
for the hot French maid" Asperger added.
