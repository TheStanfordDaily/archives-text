## WHO WILL BE THE 'GREY'S ANATOMY' OF 2011 FINALES? 
### â€“ liz STARK contact liz: estark12@stanford. edu 
Last spring, "Grey's Anatomy"
revived its dreary season with a
two-part finale in which a wid
ower of a former patient seeks
vengeance against Derek Shepherd
and commits mass murder along the
way. Shonda Rhimes engineered the
perfect ending doubling as a begin
ning: she created a conflict needing
to be resolved specifically within the
finale (given that the season was
already lacking a major point of ten
sion since Katherine Heigl's depar
ture) and carrying over its repercus
sions to a guaranteed seventh season.
As we enter the week of finales, hav
ing seen "30 Rock" and "Fringe" con
clude last week, let's assess the field:

"Community" (Thursday, May 12):
A year that began so well for

NBC's underdog comedy has lost
some of its narrative focus in the
home stretch. The strength of the
show's experimentation with genre
brought us the highs of the "Dinner
with Andre" and recap parody
episodes, culminating in the return
of paintball wars last week.
"Community" could address the lin
gering threads of Jeff/Britta, Pierce as
villain or Shirley's baby, or it could
surprise us again with another pair
ing like Jeff and Annie in the season
one finale.
"Desperate Housewives" (Sunday,
May 15):
The return of the dreaded Paul
has steered this season of ABC's
aging dramedy away from the super
natural and back toward "reality."
Reality on Wisteria Lane means woe,
be it financial or marital. The four
protagonists all find themselves in
dark places, as new character Renee
(Vanessa Williams) has provided the
spark of humor and hope all season.
"Desperate Housewives" will be
around for two more seasons, and
hopefully Renee will be able to
spread her positivity.
"The Office" (Thursday, May 19):
Though the future of "The
Office" as a TV show is clear in that
it will definitely return next fall, the
future of "The Office" as a story is
not. Will Ferrell has been enlisted as
temporary star power, but I hope
that the season finale will set up a
new power structure at Dunder
Mifflin and within the series to fill
the void of Steve Carell, with more
love for characters like Andy and
Erin.
"Grey's Anatomy" (Thursday, May 19):
"Grey's" finds itself at an impor

tant juncture in that its progression
as a television show seems to have
aligned with its content: I hope that
the season finale will redeem me for
years of loyal viewership and name a
chief resident of Seattle Grace. The
arms race for the position has
reached a fever pitch, reducing the
residents to their achievements and
empowering the attendings. I miss
the banter of the old days and hope
the drama of the announcement will
bring some of that back.
"Saturday Night Live" (Saturday,
May 21):
Justin Timberlake hosts the
finale of a season that saw the rise
of some great new characters
(most importantly, Stefon) and the

retirement of others (RIP Penelope
and Gilly).

"Glee" (Tuesday, May 24):
The kids of "Glee" will finally
have their day in the sun at
Nationals. Undoubtedly, Fox will
have pulled out all the stops for the
team's trip to New York City, but
there remains the question of scope
in my mind. For example, one of
recent episode brought together
Gwyneth Paltrow, Cheyenne Jackson,
Stephen Tobolowsky and Mr. Schue's
ex-wife; I hope that the trip to NYC
will keep the literal and figurative

focus on the Glee club. Given season
one's expectedly unexpected loss at
regionals, "Glee" won't get off too
easily by awarding our heroes the
championship. This is also the night
of the season finale for monster reali
ty hits "Dancing with the Stars" and
"The Biggest Loser."

"American Idol" (Wednesday, May
25):
Though I admittedly don't
watch this show, the latest season on
the reality program that pioneered
the genre has undergone a tonal
shift. The addition of Jennifer Lopez
and Steven Tyler has altered the
focus from spectacle to content, as
summer hits like "The Sing Off"
have done. The question remains
whether "A.1." can maintain its
supremacy with new programs such
as NBC's "The Voice" or the immi
nent arrival of "The X-Factor" on the
same network.
