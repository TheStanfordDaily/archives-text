# OFFENSE HITTING STRIDE AT RIGHT TIME
## No. 25 Card journeys to Oregon 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN 
Winners of six straight and seven of its
last eight games, Stanford baseball hopes it
can continue to move its way up the con
ference standings in its final regular-sea
son series outside of California this year
when it heads to Eugene this weekend to
take on the Oregon Ducks.
Currently tied for fifth-place in the con
ference, the No. 25 Cardinal (27-16, 9-9
Pac-10) comes into the series following
two mid-week blowout victories over Pa
cific and UC-Davis after sweeping Wash

ington over the weekend. The theme of the
win streak has been offense, as the Cardi
nal has hit .364 en route to a 7.7 runs per
game average in that span.
The Cardinal freshmen have been im
pressive over that streak, especially first
baseman Brian Ragira and outfielder
Austin Wilson. Ragira, who leads the team
in RBI with 38 this season and is second in
slugging at a .471 clip, was named Pac-10
Player of the Week after hitting .571 with
six RBI in the games against San Jose State

Sophomore righthander Mark Appel (above) has emerged as the staff ace out of the marquee Friday night starting slot. Despite a
4-5 record, Appel has a 3.31 ERA in 12 appearances for the Cardinal, which is now tied for fifth in Pac-10 play with nine games to
go in the conference slate. He will get the ball tonight in a critical series-opener against the Oregon Ducks in Eugene.
