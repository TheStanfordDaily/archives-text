# OFFENSE HITTING STRIDE AT RIGHT TIME
## No. 25 Card journeys to Oregon 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN 
Winners of six straight and seven of its
last eight games, Stanford baseball hopes it
can continue to move its way up the con
ference standings in its final regular-sea
son series outside of California this year
when it heads to Eugene this weekend to
take on the Oregon Ducks.
Currently tied for fifth-place in the con
ference, the No. 25 Cardinal (27-16, 9-9
Pac-10) comes into the series following
two mid-week blowout victories over Pa
cific and UC-Davis after sweeping Wash

ington over the weekend. The theme of the
win streak has been offense, as the Cardi
nal has hit .364 en route to a 7.7 runs per
game average in that span.
The Cardinal freshmen have been im
pressive over that streak, especially first
baseman Brian Ragira and outfielder
Austin Wilson. Ragira, who leads the team
in RBI with 38 this season and is second in
slugging at a .471 clip, was named Pac-10
Player of the Week after hitting .571 with
six RBI in the games against San Jose State

Sophomore righthander Mark Appel (above) has emerged as the staff ace out of the marquee Friday night starting slot. Despite a
4-5 record, Appel has a 3.31 ERA in 12 appearances for the Cardinal, which is now tied for fifth in Pac-10 play with nine games to
go in the conference slate. He will get the ball tonight in a critical series-opener against the Oregon Ducks in Eugene.
and Washington. Ragira is the sec
ond Cardinal freshman to garner
the honor this year, after second
baseman Lonnie Kauppila won
the award for the week of April 4.
Wilson followed up Ragira's
performance with some excellent
play of his own. The right fielder
comes into the weekend having
raised his average to .331 in the
midst of his current eleven-game
hitting streak. During the stretch,
Wilson is batting .462 with a .641
slugging percentage, and with his
homer on Monday, Wilson is now
tied for the team lead in homers
with Ragira and senior catcher
Zach Jones, who all have 4.
Sophomore starter Dean
McArdle, the beneficiary of the
Cardinal's recent offensive success
in the team's victory over UC-

Davis on Tuesday, remarked how
much easier life is for a pitcher
with a lot of run support.
"You just go out there and try
to throw it in the zone," he said.
"The last couple of weeks it's been
really nice to have the run support
every night."
Tlie Cardinal's opponent, Ore
gon (24-23-1, 5-13 Pac-10), comes
into the weekend hoping to spur
some late-season momentum that
could garner them an NCAA in
vite. The Ducks were swept at
home last weekend by UCLA in a
series that severely damaged their
postseason hopes, but with anoth
er nine Pac-10 games still left on
the slate, Oregon has plenty left to
fight for. The Ducks enter the
weekend following bad weather
on Wednesday that forced them to

end their game against Seattle in a
7-7 tie, a rarity in baseball. The
Ducks defeated the Redhawks 10-
5 in their game on Tuesday, which
snapped their three game losing
streak.
Although the Ducks have at
times struggled to score runs this
season, they have been paced by
junior second-baseman Danny
Pulfer, a 2010 All-Pac-10 honorable
mention who leads the Ducks in
hitting with a .330 average to go
along with 11 doubles. Freshman
catcher Aaron Jones is second on
the team in hits with 44 and doubles
with eight. Oregon is hitting just
.245 as a team this season, while
Stanford is hitting at a .304 clip.
The Ducks have offset their
spotty offense with outstanding
starting pitching. The Oregon rota

tion is led by junior lefthander and
preseason All-American Tyler An
derson, who is the all-time leader
in strikeouts at Oregon and has a
1.73 ERA this season. Anderson
has been backed up in the rotation
this year by junior Madison Boer,
junior Alex Keudell and sopho
more Christian Jones, all of whom
have an ERA of 3.26 or lower.
The Cardinal-Ducks series
opens today at 7 p.m. in Eugene
and continues with games at 2 p.m.
tomorrow and 1 p.m. on Sunday.
Expected starters will be sopho
more Mark Appel, senior Danny
Sandbrink and junior Jordan Pries
for Stanford, and Anderson,
Keudell and Jones for Oregon.
