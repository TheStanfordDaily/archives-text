## ROXY SASS That's what she (or he) said 
### 
Roxy's heard it all, and she knows
that, unless you're speaking
about the most mundane of
topics ("I have class until 12," "Her hair
was brown," "My knee bruises seem a lot
bigger these days," etc), what you say is
rarely what you mean. Roxy, however,
has a resume full of skills, at the top of
which is communication skills —espe-
cially oral communication —and those,
dear readers, lend themselves to one
thing: conversation decoding.
Roxy's not here to deliver the
watered-down version. People aren't
usually that mean when there's a chance
to say it in a nicer way —and that's why
sugar-coating of all types has plagued
campus communications since 1891.
And when it comes to someone to lick
all that sugar off... Who you gonna
call? Roxy('s tongue).
And so, without further ado:
He says: "I've slept with three girls."
He's slept with eight; get a free STD
screening at Vaden. She says: "I don't
sleep with guys who I'm not dating." She
has and will again. But just to be safe,
you should probably compliment her
hair or something.
At lunch, he says: "Don't worry
about the check —111 pay" He means:
"I'm getting some later, right?" (Roxy
defers here to the wisdom of Phyllis from
"The Office": If you order the most
expensive thing on the menu, "Oh yeah,
you'll have to put out")
At a crowded party, she says:
"Where's your friend?" She means: "I
want your friend to be my two-backed
beast accomplice."
He says: "Wanna get lunch some
time?" He means: "Now's the time for
you to tell me if you have a boyfriend." If
you don't, it gets awkward.
She says: "I love Jane Austen." She
means: "Buy me flowers every Sunday"

If she says she loves literature but hates
Jane Austen, she means: "If you ever
misspell something in a text, we're
done."
He says: "How about we go back to
my room and watch some 'Family
Guy?" He means: "This is so easy, I
might cry a tear of happiness."
She says: "I'm really focused on my
med school apps/thesis/job search right
now." She means: "Get ready for a rough
ride, after which I'll kick you out to
study some more." You might leave with
a few scratches.
He says: "I'm a nice guy" He
means: "I'll spoon the hell out of you,
and you'll think fondly of me once a
month or so while you lie in the arms of
your much hunkier boyfriend."
He says: "I love 'Arrested
Development'!" He means: "I looked at
your Facebook interests and am hoping
to charm my way to your heart via
shared interests." Be nice to this one; he's
trying.
Roxy admits this isn't a perfect sci
ence: intuition about a comment's true
meaning takes years to cultivate. In the
meantime, Roxy hopes to encourage a
more honest discourse about all topics
including sexing and its variants. At least
you can tmst that when she says, "You're
cute. I'm bored. How about a quick
bang?" she means exactly that.
