## CRIME & SAFETY Small blaze at Kappa Sigma chars balcony Little damage, no injuries in quickly extinguished fire 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) responded
to a one-alarm call at Kappa Sigma
at about four p.m. Thursday after a
plasma TV box full of combustible
packing material caught fire on a
balcony.
A fire truck and several police
vehicles arrived outside the build
ing at around 4:15 p.m. Fire fighters
placed a ladder against the wall next
to the balcony and spent time reset
ting the sprinkler and alarm sys
tems.

After the fire was put out, the
balcony was "scorched but still
structurally sound," said Assistant
University Fire Marshal Alison
Pena.

Nothing inside the structure was
damaged, but there was "just a
smoky smell in the room," she said.
According to Kappa Sig House
Manager Andrew Wyhinny 'll and
President Brian Barnes 'l2, the
room's occupants reportedly dis
covered the fire as they were com
ing home. Three residents started
throwing pans of water on the fire,
while a fourth grabbed and emptied

a fire extinguisher. The fire contin
ued to burn, so they had to use a sec
ond fire extinguisher. By that point,
the heat of the fire caused the exte
rior sprinkler to go off, activating
the fire alarm.

Pena didn't hear about anyone
setting an alarm off. She said that
the students should have pulled a
fire alarm rather than going for the
equipment.

SUDPS officials speculated that
a live cigarette fell off the balcony
railing and into the box, igniting the
packing material. This theory has
not yet been confirmed. The room's
occupants told officials they did not
smoke.

Another source could have been
heat from the Christmas lights
wrapped around the railing. But
since the lights were not plugged in
at the time, officials deemed them
unrelated to the fire.

"It's a good thing the sprinkler
went off, otherwise balcony could
have set on fire," Pena said. "It had
the potential of being a lot worse."
Pena emphasized that Student
Housing doesn't allow smoking in
side and that balconies still count as
part of the building. She added that
in unrelated incidents, people
smoking and disposing of butts in
mulch had caused a lot of small
mulch fires because of the dry

weather.
The fire crew replaced the bal
cony's sprinkler head, pressurized
the pipe and reset the fire alarm.
They also replaced the fire extin
guisher, which was empty.
A crowd of about a dozen fra
ternity members lingered around
the house after the fire. The alarm
went off a second time as officials
worked to reset the system. By 4:30
p.m., most officials had departed.
According to Wyhinny, one resi
dent of the room in question had
left for the Sharks game.
"It was very lucky ... for us,"
Wyhinny said. "We actually wanted
to save the place. We love it it's
our house."
