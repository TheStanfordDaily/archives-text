## Panel debates future of teacher education 
### CATHYZHU 
Thursday afternoon, the School of Education
brought together experts in education to answer
the question, "Does teacher education have a fu
ture?"
The panel debated nontraditional methods for
teacher education emerging from organizations
like Teach for America (TFA) and their efficacy
compared to the theory-based work of education
school.
"University teacher education is under at
tack," said School of Education Dean Deborah
Stipek, who moderated the panel.
With the emergence of increasingly diverse
paths to a teaching career, people are questioning
the purpose and value of professional schools for
education, she said. School of Education profes
sor Pam Grossman stated that a central problem
of preparatory education for teachers is that it dis
tances itself from the practice of teaching.
Steve Farr, chief knowledge officer at Teach
for America, shares this view; he believes practical
teaching experience improves teaching more
than instruction in theory.
"We can change [teaching] behavior more in
two hours of putting people on their feet teaching
than [we can through] a hundred hours of making
people listen to lectures about teaching," he said.
However, Deborah Ball, the dean of the
school of education at the University of Michigan,
believes that questioning the purpose and value
of teacher education is not an immediate priority.
"The real problem is that we have no system

atic way of evaluating teachers," she said.
She argued that the priority in teacher educa
tion should be to define a standard skill set begin
ning teachers must acquire before they are al
lowed to teach a class.
But this raises the question of whether a na
tional standard could be agreed upon. Ball and
Grossman believe it's a matter of striking a bal
ance between specific standards and universal ex
pectations.

When asked by Stipek what proportion of
teachers certified by schools of education would
meet her standard, Ball said an "appallingly low"
number would. There is still a gap for schools of
education to fill in preparing teachers before they
began teaching.
