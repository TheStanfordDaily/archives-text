## Panel debates future of teacher education 
### CATHYZHU 
Thursday afternoon, the School of Education
brought together experts in education to answer
the question, "Does teacher education have a fu
ture?"
The panel debated nontraditional methods for
teacher education emerging from organizations
like Teach for America (TFA) and their efficacy
compared to the theory-based work of education
school.
"University teacher education is under at
tack," said School of Education Dean Deborah
Stipek, who moderated the panel.
With the emergence of increasingly diverse
paths to a teaching career, people are questioning
the purpose and value of professional schools for
education, she said. School of Education profes
sor Pam Grossman stated that a central problem
of preparatory education for teachers is that it dis
tances itself from the practice of teaching.
Steve Farr, chief knowledge officer at Teach
for America, shares this view; he believes practical
teaching experience improves teaching more
than instruction in theory.
"We can change [teaching] behavior more in
two hours of putting people on their feet teaching
than [we can through] a hundred hours of making
people listen to lectures about teaching," he said.
However, Deborah Ball, the dean of the
school of education at the University of Michigan,
believes that questioning the purpose and value
of teacher education is not an immediate priority.
"The real problem is that we have no system

atic way of evaluating teachers," she said.
She argued that the priority in teacher educa
tion should be to define a standard skill set begin
ning teachers must acquire before they are al
lowed to teach a class.
But this raises the question of whether a na
tional standard could be agreed upon. Ball and
Grossman believe it's a matter of striking a bal
ance between specific standards and universal ex
pectations.

When asked by Stipek what proportion of
teachers certified by schools of education would
meet her standard, Ball said an "appallingly low"
number would. There is still a gap for schools of
education to fill in preparing teachers before they
began teaching.
Discussing what reforms in teacher education

were needed to reach those stan
dards, panelists agreed on the need
to move from theory to practice.
It would be irresponsible, how
ever, to have student teachers
"practice" teaching in classrooms
where they would be accountable
for student performance, Ball ar
gued. Gross proposed that simula
tion-based training practices bor
rowed from clinical psychology
could provide an effective middle
ground.
During the Q&A session fol
lowing the panel, an audience
member asked if the emergence of
programs such as TFA would be
come a part of the attacks made on
schools of education - the success
of the former calling into question
the value of the latter.
Farr responded that TFA was a
complement to and not a substi
tute for teacher education. It
serves a different purpose: increas
ing the supply of much needed
teachers to less-developed areas.
The panel sparked lingering
questions for many audience
members.
"One thing ... that would be
good to hear more about is the
preparation of good teacher edu
cators," said Michelle Brown, a
fourth year doctoral student at the
school of education. "There's a
pipeline problem where we al
ready don't have enough good
teachers, so naturally we won't
have enough good teacher educa
tors."

This panel is part of the Cub
berley lecture series, which seeks
to create a public forum for discus
sion of critical issues in education.

In an interview with The Daily,
School of Education External Re
lations Associate Holly Materman
spoke about the motivations for
putting together this panel.
"The graduate school model,
the Teach for America model and
teacher residency programs are
just three of the many different
models emerging," she said. "We
should stop spending time arguing
about who has the best system to
prepare teachers, but instead look
at... how all three paths to teach
ing can leverage best practices."
