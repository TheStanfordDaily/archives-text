## Hospital expansion gets key local votes 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
The hospital expansion project
moved a step forward this week as the
Menlo Park City Council accepted
the University's traffic deal and the
Palo Alto City Council voted unani
mously to accept Stanford's offer of
$3.7 million for traffic mitigation re
lated to the planned expansion.

Under this deal, Menlo Park
stands to receive $3.7 million for
traffic and infrastructure improve
ments related to the expansion. The
University will pay Menlo Park in
three different payouts one after
final project approval and the re
maining amounts in 2013 and 2018.
By approving the deal, the Council
has also agreed to not sue over the
project's environmental impact re
port.

The Palo Alto City Council voted
4-2 to recommend certification of
the Final Environmental Impact for
the expansion after four years of ne
gotiations with the University.
Next week, the council will de

bate the project's development
agreement. As part this agreement,
Stanford would provide $7 million in
health care programs and services,
$23 million in housing program fees,
$l2 million to support climate
change initiatives and $3.4 million
for the city to improve bicycle and
pedestrian paths near the medical
center.
Barring future obstacles, the $3.5
billion expansion plan is projected to
add 1.3 million square feet of new
development and more than 2,200
new employees to Palo Alto by 2025.
