## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Tyler Brown An Le Nguyen 
Two large gas pipelines buried
along Junipero Serra Blvd. will be
among the first sections updated
under PG&E's plan to test or re
place aging pipelines.
At a May 9 meeting with Stan
ford officials, PG&E engineers pro
posed replacing or relocating some
of the pipelines found on University
land. PG&E expects to replace Line
109, which has been around since
1936, by 2013. Line 132, which was
installed in 1947, is slated to be re
placed by 2014.

"Stanford officials will continue
to work closely with PG&E on its
testing and replacement work as
well as ensure that important ongo
ing local projects in the vicinity of
the pipelines are appropriately co
ordinated with the utility company,"
said Larry Gibbs, associate vice
provost of the Environmental
Health and Safety department, in a
statement to the Stanford Report.
The proposal still needs to be
fleshed out and approved by the Cal
ifornia Public Utilities Commission
in order for the projects to proceed.
