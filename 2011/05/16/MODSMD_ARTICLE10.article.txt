## Walking the Talk Vineet Singal takes the stage in Tampa Bay to promote patient empowerment through education 
### JANE YOON 
Squinting at the lights which masked
the large audience in the darkness be
yond, Vineet Singal took his place in
front of the crowd. Sweaty palms be
trayed his nerves. "Don't stare, but
don't look at your feet. Don't slouch, but don't
be stiff. Don't speak quickly, but not too slow
ly. And remember. Breathe,"
So began the TEDx talk by Singal 'l2, on
April 22 in Tampa Bay, Fla. TEDx was created
as part of TED, a nonprofit devoted to sharing
"ideas worth spreading" through conferences
in which a range of speakers give talks on top
ics they are passionate about. TEDx was
specifically designed to give communities, or
ganizations and individuals the opportunity to
present ideas through conferences at the local
level. As the executive director of Anjna Pa
tient Education, Singal attended this confer
ence to give a talk about this nonprofit organi
zation, which he co-founded with Donovan
Barfield 'l2.

Singal and Barfield founded Anjna Patient
Education in 2010 in order to break the cycle of
preventable chronic disease. The organization
aims to increase access to quality health educa

tion programs for underserved populations at
free clinics. Anjna develops and distributes
health education material to patients that is
translated into 15 different languages. It also
trains clinic volunteers and health educators
with a health curriculum through local Anjna
chapters at universities.
At the TEDx conference, Singal spoke
about the inspiration for Anjna and its goals.
The idea for Anjna came to Singal when he
took a leave of absence in the fall of 2009 to
work full time at St. Vincent's House Free Clin
ic in Galveston, Tx.
At that time, Galveston was a community
ravaged by Hurricane Ike and the failing econ
omy. St. Vincent's lacked the resources to keep
up with the demand. Here, Singal worked in
close contact with patients by taking vitals,
doing case histories and performing physical
exams.

"Every day, I saw patients suffering from
obesity and stress-related diseases," he said.
"There are terrible consequences, leading to
amputation, blindness and heart failure. What
I found in speaking with these patients was
that most of them had a poor diet and did not
do any exercise, which contributed to the
chronic diseases."

Singal realized that what was missing at the

clinic was the education component of patient
counseling. Singal successfully sought permis
sion to launch a health education program
within the clinic.

In the summer of 2010, Singal expanded
upon the St. Vincent's health education pro
gram by starting Anjna Patient Education with
Barfield at Stanford.

"The issue of quality healthcare for med
ically underserved populations resonated
deeply with me, and I wanted to help improve
the existing health education infrastructure for
free clinic patients," Barfield said. "Vineet and
I started Anjna Patient Education working as
just us two in a one-room double at Crothers
Memorial. Now it has grown to well over 100
volunteers with support from highly regarded
organizations."
Anjna is currently in the process of branch
ing out to other universities. The first chapter
was formed by Chis Itoh at UC-Berkeley, and
the next chapter will be started at San Jose
State University in the upcoming months,
Barfield said.

In the future, the organization plans to uti
lize new methods including Short Messag
ing Service (SMS) and iPad technology to
improve health education by harnessing the
technology and expertise available at Stanford

and in the Silicon Valley, according to Singal.
Megan Winkelman 'l3 currently leads the
interactive health module project by building
interactive iPad apps for health education,
specifically designed for low-literacy popula
tions.

"I'm interested in using education of the
health care system to empower patients, in the
hopes that education will help them see their
health as within their own control," Winkel
man said. "This tool is empowering for the pa
tient, efficient for the health care practitioner
and cost-effective for the health care provider
as it leads to more accurate diagnosis and more
effective treatment."

After spending nearly 150 hours preparing,
refining and rehearsing the talk forTEDx, Sin
gal said that he hoped he conveyed a message
that people could take home regardless of
their background and that this talk might in
spire audience members to take action.
"I wanted to ... do justice to the cause that
I am representing," he said. "I felt like I was the
messenger. I wasn't Vineet Singal at the talk. I
was someone talking about the issues sur
rounding chronic disease in America, especial
ly from a student perspective,"

"I'm interested in using education of the
health care system to empower patients, in the
hopes that education will help them see their
health as within their own control," Winkel
man said. "This tool is empowering for the pa
tient, efficient for the health care practitioner
and cost-effective for the health care provider
as it leads to more accurate diagnosis and more
effective treatment."

After spending nearly 150 hours preparing,
refining and rehearsing the talk forTEDx, Sin
gal said that he hoped he conveyed a message
that people could take home regardless of
their background and that this talk might in
spire audience members to take action.
"I wanted to ... do justice to the cause that
I am representing," he said. "I felt like I was the
messenger. I wasn't Vineet Singal at the talk. I
was someone talking about the issues sur
rounding chronic disease in America, especial
ly from a student perspective,"
