## EDITORIAL Higher Education is Not a Bubble 
### 
The rising cost of higher edu
cation is one of the few fea
tures of American economic
life to remain constant over the last
few decades. Since 1978, the infla
tion-adjusted cost of college tu
ition has increased 650 percent;
here at Stanford, the cost of tuition
and room and board now stands at
$52,341 per year. Despite many
universities' (including Stanford's)
efforts to increase need-based fi
nancial aid, the dramatic rise in the
cost of education has left the aver
age college senior with nearly
$25,000 in debt. While skyrocket
ing student debt is cause for seri
ous concern, investment in tuition
should not be viewed as a bubble
destined to pop. The bubble hy
pothesis implies that the costs of
education now dwarf the benefits,
a premise that the facts do not sup
port. Higher education is a good
investment for most students, es
pecially those lucky enough to find
themselves at Stanford.
The most recent data show that
buying a college education still
yields a consistently good return
on investment. According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, people
aged 25 years or older with a bach
elor's degree made $412 more
each week and were half as likely
to be unemployed in 2010 than
those with only a high school diplo
ma. Recipients of professional de
grees did even better, making $984
more each week than people with
only diplomas. On average, then, it
only takes several years of work

for an education to pay for itself in
pure dollar terms.
To compare the bubble in high
er education to the bubble in hous
ing prices, then, you must believe
that aggregate investment in col
lege education does not confer eco
nomic value equivalent to tuition.
Some have asserted that college
degrees promise prestige or con
tacts, which only influence the dis
tribution of wealth between those
with degrees and those without, not
the aggregate amount of wealth
across society. With each college
student convinced that her degree
will entitle her to an inside track in
the American economy, bubble
proponents argue that college
loans end up financing an expen
sive arms race for prestige, granting
individual benefits at the cost of ag
gregate economic productivity.
Yet, this argument is also un
convincing. In a globalized labor
market, American workers with
out degrees will continue to see
their wages drop. As a society, we
have pinned our hopes on a
smarter economy, driven by brain
power rather than elbow grease.
Until bubble theorists can explain
how to train engineers, program
mers, doctors, lawyers and other
"thinking" professionals without
sending them to places like Stan
ford, higher education will remain
an excellent social investment. Be
yond the individual benefits, there
is something about Stanford that

has consistently generated the
exact kinds of economic jugger
nauts we need to thrive as a nation.

To students and to Americans,
the last decade has shown that col
lege is worth its price. Nonetheless, it
is perfectly reasonable to inquire as
to why that price has climbed so
high. One theory holds that the ris
ing cost of tuition simply reflects
high demand for education running
up against limited supply. To take
this a step further, it is not the supply
of education per se that is limited,
but rather the supply of prestige.
Prestigious schools such as
Stanford can maintain their pres
tige in only one way: by attracting
the best students and faculty mem

bers. It is they who secure research
grants, make donations and raise
the pedigree of a university. Like
wise, top students and brilliant re
searchers have a much greater in
centive to attend or work for pres
tigious schools. Only in those envi
ronments can they mingle with the
best minds in their respective
fields and feel confident that they
will have the resources they need
to conduct their work.

Unfortunately for tuition-pay
ing families, prestige is not free. To
stay ahead of their competition,
universities are forced to build
more state-of-the art labs and
recreation centers, which in
evitably drive up administrative
costs.This effect applies not just to
top-flight universities like Stan
ford, but also to 2nd and 3rd tier
schools with nowhere near the
name recognition we enjoy here
on the Farm.

The ascendancy of prestige at
the expense of tuition-paying stu
dents and parents has not been
without benefits. Many of the in
tellectual and technological devel
opments of our age would have
been impossible were it not for the
improvement and expansion of re
search and education facilities.
Some universities have already re
alized that families can only be
squeezed so far. The expansion of
need-based financial aid at Stan
ford in recent years is a prime ex
ample of the University's recogni
tion of the need to enhance equity
and access on campus.
As students, as alumni and as
citizens, we must realize that rising
tuition is not a burden imposed by
some unseen nemesis, nor is it a
bubble. So rest easy, Stanford: your
education here has real and meas
urable benefits, both to you and to
society as a whole.
