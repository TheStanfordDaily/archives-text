## EDITORIAL Higher Education is Not a Bubble 
### 
The rising cost of higher edu
cation is one of the few fea
tures of American economic
life to remain constant over the last
few decades. Since 1978, the infla
tion-adjusted cost of college tu
ition has increased 650 percent;
here at Stanford, the cost of tuition
and room and board now stands at
$52,341 per year. Despite many
universities' (including Stanford's)
efforts to increase need-based fi
nancial aid, the dramatic rise in the
cost of education has left the aver
age college senior with nearly
$25,000 in debt. While skyrocket
ing student debt is cause for seri
ous concern, investment in tuition
should not be viewed as a bubble
destined to pop. The bubble hy
pothesis implies that the costs of
education now dwarf the benefits,
a premise that the facts do not sup
port. Higher education is a good
investment for most students, es
pecially those lucky enough to find
themselves at Stanford.
The most recent data show that
buying a college education still
yields a consistently good return
on investment. According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, people
aged 25 years or older with a bach
elor's degree made $412 more
each week and were half as likely
to be unemployed in 2010 than
those with only a high school diplo
ma. Recipients of professional de
grees did even better, making $984
more each week than people with
only diplomas. On average, then, it
only takes several years of work

for an education to pay for itself in
pure dollar terms.
To compare the bubble in high
er education to the bubble in hous
ing prices, then, you must believe
that aggregate investment in col
lege education does not confer eco
nomic value equivalent to tuition.
Some have asserted that college
degrees promise prestige or con
tacts, which only influence the dis
tribution of wealth between those
with degrees and those without, not
the aggregate amount of wealth
across society. With each college
student convinced that her degree
will entitle her to an inside track in
the American economy, bubble
proponents argue that college
loans end up financing an expen
sive arms race for prestige, granting
individual benefits at the cost of ag
gregate economic productivity.
Yet, this argument is also un
convincing. In a globalized labor
market, American workers with
out degrees will continue to see
their wages drop. As a society, we
have pinned our hopes on a
smarter economy, driven by brain
power rather than elbow grease.
Until bubble theorists can explain
how to train engineers, program
mers, doctors, lawyers and other
"thinking" professionals without
sending them to places like Stan
ford, higher education will remain
an excellent social investment. Be
yond the individual benefits, there
is something about Stanford that
