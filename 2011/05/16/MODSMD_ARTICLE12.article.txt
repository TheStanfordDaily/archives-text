# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Led from behind 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I have had a fraught relationship
with religion. As a queer person,
I've always felt that I had to
choose one or the other, that either I
could be religious or queer. I could
never be both.

I grew up Catholic. My family in
stilled in me a deep-rooted faith in
some higher power. I went to
Catholic school for most of my life. I
went to church every Sunday. But I
struggled with my faith when I first
came out as gay and even more
when I came out as transgender. For
years I have had to put up with ho
mophobic statements from all levels
of my religious community from
the members and priests of my local
church all the way up to the Pope. I
quickly became cynical of religion
a cynicism that only increased
when I came out as transgender.
I questioned God, questioned
why He made me this way, if He had
made a mistake, if I was a mistake. I
hated my body and the God who put
me in it. And since that moment, I
admit that my faith has not been the
same.

But last Tuesday I attended a
prayer service led by Victoria Rue,
an ordained Roman Catholic fe
male priest this was mind-blow
ing for me, because in all my life I
had never met a female Roman
Catholic priest. According to the law
of the Roman Catholic Church,
women are barred from priesthood.
She also happened to be lesbian
identified. (And her partner is a
Presbyterian. How cool is that?) I
could not have imagined that a
woman like her would exist.
Her sermon was about how God
leads us all from behind, that God
isn't the type to lead you through life
by the hand, but blows a gentle wind
on our backs. Oftentimes we go on a
roundabout, time-consuming way,
but we do end up where we need to
go and learn more about ourselves
on the way.
I could have heard the same ser
mon from a priest at my home
parish, but listening to Victoria, lis
tening to this priest, listening to
someone like me, someone I could
relate to someone who I could
tell probably dealt with the same

struggles I did â€”it felt different.
More empowering. This was the first
time I conceived that I could possi
bly be both a Catholic and transgen
der, that perhaps being made trans
gender is not as much a mistake or a
curse and more a blessing and a new,
more interesting way to perceive the
world.

Common rhetoric used today is
that people like me were "born in
the wrong body." When I first came
out to myself, I felt that way. But
after a lot of reflection, experiencing
life in this body has led to a lot of in
sights and realizations about my
identity. I've always believed that
everything happens for a reason. I
don't think it's a coincidence that I
ended up at Stanford, one of the
most transgender-friendly schools
in the nation. I don't think it's a coin
cidence that I dreamed of writing a
column since my days doing graph
ics for The Stanford Daily as a lowly
freshman. And I don't think it's a co
incidence I gained an amazing read
ership both inside and outside the
Stanford community. I have come to
realize that if there is a God, He has
been leading me from behind, espe
cially when it comes to my transi
tion. I have reached my masculinity
in an unconventional, roundabout
way. And I admit I was resentful to
God at first, but my journey to man
hood has taught me a lot about my
self. Looking at it that way, being
transgender can be seen as a gift, as
a means to a level of introspection
and appreciation that I don't think I
could have reached as a non-trans
gender person.
Religion will always be a part of
my life. Being a Roman Catholic
isn't just going to church every Sun
day. It's part of my culture. It's part
of me as much as my identity as a
transgender person, as much as

being a Stanford student, an English
major, a human being. And I'm glad
that I met Victoria. I think I was
meant to meet her, so I could finally
come to terms with my faith after
years and years of battling with my
self. And for the first time, and I
never thought I'd say this, I'm
thankful to God for making me this
way and giving me this life.
What I learned from reflecting

on my life and reflecting on Victo
ria's sermon is this: what I'm doing
now is the groundwork for some
thing better. And I don't know what
that "something" is quite yet, but I
know it will be great. The quality of
my life and my self-esteem has im
proved since my dark, frightened
days as a child, and I could only
imagine that as I look out into the
blank and terrifying future that
good things are coming. I know they
will.
