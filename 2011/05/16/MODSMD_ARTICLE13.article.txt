# No FREE LUNCH
## The 						Price of Presidency 
### Zack Hoberg Dave Grundfest 
The ASSU Senate recently imposed a $4OO spend
ing cap on class president campaigns in response
to big spending from slates during election season.
The money spent on the campaigns was, appropriately,
seen as ridiculous and prohibitive to some potential can
didates, and this spending cap is certainly a good start.
But it's only a start.
First off, it only covers class president slate elections,
and while ASSU exec slates' spending is already capped
at $l,OOO, ASSU Senate campaigns have no constraints.
The bill passed apparently tried to limit this but ran into
some confusion and abandoned that side of the issue,
leaving Senate campaigns a spending free for all.
More interesting though is where we as a student
body choose to draw the line between "appropriate"
spending levels and prohibitive excess. Campaigns
spending hundreds of dollars on free tanks and plastic
sunglasses have an advantage simply from name recog
nition, and not every Stanford student has the means to
finance that.
The Daily article regarding the matter reported that
the specific cap of $4OO tried to balance the requirement
for publicity with that excessive cost and quotes Dan
Ashton 'l4, a member of the new ASSU Senate, as say
ing that, "The point of the campaign is to get you to ac
tually engage with people one on one, so that you aren't
just buying really extravagant parties or merchandise."
It seems very hard to strike that balance what's
prohibitive? How much money does a candidate realis
tically need to spend on their campaign? There has ap
parently even been talk in the Senate about providing
assistance in campaigns to those on financial aid. You
can argue about the number and whatever it is people
will spend right up to it (and, let's be honest, over it
who is really going to audit a student election that thor
oughly? ), and it will still be a disproportionate burden
on less affluent students.
So maybe the extreme solution is the best one no
spending at all. It costs nothing to send out emails to a
billion different lists, to publicize on Facebook, to talk to

people in dining halls, to stand out in White Plaza and
yell at/debate with passers-by about campaign issues.
Maybe allow a universal public finance option where
everyone gets 100 flyers and a uniform box of chalk
courtesy of the ASSU it would allow campaigns to
get the name out but why does anything more extrav
agant than that benefit anyone?
Stanford just isn't that big. A presidential slate of four
people could, if they put the effort in, easily speak per
sonally with a huge proportion of the student body. Add
in volunteer representatives (a.k.a. friends guilted into
making announcements at dorm meetings), and most
students could easily be addressed by a campaign, for
free. This year 800 votes would have won you a senate
seat the numbers involved simply don't require any
thing more than face to face interactions. The point is
that the elections could go on without 10,000 more fly
ers and slate-branded t-shirts. Voters would be just as in
formed about what really matters potentially even
more informed, if they were forced to base their deci
sions on actually talking to candidates or their represen
tatives instead of the relative prevalence of each slate's
logo gear on campus. The only reason spending on elec
tions is necessary now is because everyone else does it.
The real question is what does all the spending ac
tually get us? Yes, everyone needs more frat shades, but
beyond that, the student body actually doesn't really
benefit from higher budget campaigns. If you allowed


everyone to spend what they want
ed, you might be able to claim some
thing about fundraising, but who is
really going to give money to some
one else to run for student govern
ment (other than the campus spe
cial interest groups that hardly need
more representing). The simple fact
is that campaigns will be self fi
nanced, which means income dis
parities present in the student body
will matter.

Once you set a budget cap with
the intention that everyone is only
able to spend up to the cap, effec
tively everyone will. At that point,

success in the election becomes a
combination of how creatively can
you spend the money, how many
people you can actually speak to
and (most importantly either way)
how many people you know. There
is no reason then not to cut the
spending altogether. We'll still have
elections, for better or for worse, we
will still have presidents and sena
tors and execs and the playing field
will be completely leveled.
There's no downside to seeing
just how creative our candidates can
be with a hundred fliers and a box of
chalk...

cial interest groups that hardly need
more representing). The simple fact
is that campaigns will be self fi
nanced, which means income dis
parities present in the student body
will matter.

Once you set a budget cap with
the intention that everyone is only
able to spend up to the cap, effec
tively everyone will. At that point,

success in the election becomes a
combination of how creatively can
you spend the money, how many
people you can actually speak to
and (most importantly either way)
how many people you know. There
is no reason then not to cut the
spending altogether. We'll still have
elections, for better or for worse, we
will still have presidents and sena
tors and execs and the playing field
will be completely leveled.
There's no downside to seeing
just how creative our candidates can
be with a hundred fliers and a box of
chalk...

If you would like to recommend the
manufacturer/specifications of chalk
provided to candidates, contact Dave
