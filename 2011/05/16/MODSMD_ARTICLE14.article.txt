# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### 
To the Stanford Community,
We are all 110-percent engrossed
at this great University in our own
worlds with little time to venture be
yond. But every once in a while,
something so special occurs in our
universe here at Stanford that it de
serves special attention and consid
eration. This can happen in the class
room, in a lecture series, in perform
ing arts or in a multitude of other
areas.

In my 50 years at Stanford five
as a student-athlete, and 45 as an em
ployee, 38 of which were served as
the men's tennis coach I have had
the opportunity to witness many of

these events on campus. Just in my
own special area of athletics alone, I
have been privileged to watch on
campus the USA-USSR track and
field spectacle during the height of
the Cold War, a Super Bowl, World
Cup soccer games, dual match inter
collegiate tennis matches played be
fore more than 7,000 in Maples Pavil
ion and the Fed Cup tennis finals be
tween the United States and Russia.
The incredible 12-1 football sea
son and yet another Final Four ap
pearance by our women's basketball
team this year are sterling examples
of the fantastic performances of our
student athletes. Flow proud we can

and should be.
Unfortunately, not all these great
performances receive the support
they merit. Specifically, I refer to our
men's and women's tennis teams. Of
the 100 national team championships
won by Stanford (Thank you, men's
gymnastics, for getting us to this mile
stone last month!), 34 have been won
by the storied men's and women's
tennis teams —l7 by each program.
The tradition continues this year,
headed by our defending national
champion women's team and 2010
NCAA doubles champ and singles
semi-finalist, senior Hilary Barte.
Our women have not lost at home in
over 12 years, winning 179 matches
in a row, a national record in any
sport. Our men also have a legiti
mate shot at the title as well and are
led by 2010 NCAA singles champi
on, junior Bradley Klahn.
And yet, despite the presence of
these two great teams and all of the
exciting individuals that comprise
them, our student attendance this
year has been subpar. There is an in
credible home court advantage in
tennis if there is a large and boister
ous crowd supporting its players. We

have a unique and rare opportunity
to tangibly contribute to the final
success of these teams this year, as
we host the 2011 NCAA Men's and
Women's Tennis Championships at
the beautiful Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.

I trust we can rise to the challenge
of giving our teams the support they
merit and in turn give them that boost
to make a real difference in results.
The 12-day NCAA Tennis Champi
onships, hosted from May 19 to 30, are
comparable to the Orange Bowl or
the Final Four being held at Stanford,
with the Cardinal as a legitimate con
tender for both titles. We hope to see
you there.
