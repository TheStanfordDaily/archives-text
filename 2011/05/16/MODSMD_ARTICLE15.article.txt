## SETTING THE TONE Men start NCAA Tournament with back-to-back wins 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team
started the NCAA Tournament in
style this past weekend, dispatching
of Army and Washington to clinch
its spot amongst the final 16 teams.
The match against Army was a
blowout from the very start with
the Cardinal easily winning 4-0
and the match against Washington
was deceptively close, with the Car
dinal still managing a resounding 4-
1 victory. With the two wins, Stan
ford has now won 12 straight match
es and is on its longest winning
streak since taking 18 matches in a
row back in 2001.

Army, making its fifth appear
ance in the NCAA Tournament,
was blitzed early and often on Fri
day afternoon by the No. 7 Cardi
nal. Experience and depth clearly
showed, as Stanford dominated
every match of the day. The tone
was set with the doubles point,
when the teams of Bradley
Klahn/Ryan Thacher and Alex
Clayton/Jamin Ball both quickly
disposed their opponents by scores
of 8-3.Those victories left the Cardi
nal needing only three points to
clinch the match. Juniors Bradley
Klahn and Ryan Thacher and soph
omore Dennis Lin were more than
ready for the task, as they were the
quickest of the six Stanford singles
players to win.
Klahn, out of the No. 1 spot, de
feated Asika Isoh, 6-1,6-2. Thacher,
out of the No. 2 spot, took out Gary
Kushnirovic, 6-0,6-1, and Lin, out of
the No. 4 spot, beat Tripp Johnson,
6-0,6-1. If either of those three had
faltered, seniors Alex Clayton and
Ted Hirshmann and sophomore
Matt Kandath would have been
more than capable of providing
Stanford with one of the requisite
four points, as each was solidly

ahead when the Cardinal clinched
the match with its fourth team
point.
On Saturday afternoon, the Car
dinal had the task of facing a famil
iar and pesky opponent, the No. 25
Washington Huskies. The last time
these two teams had faced off on
April 8 in Seattle the match had
been a close one, which Stanford
had managed to win 4-3. The stage
was set for Saturday's playoff match
to be just as exciting, with a berth in
the sweet sixteen on the line.
After locking up the doubles
point, the Cardinal quickly found it
self locked in several closely con
tested singles matches, with the ex
ception coming from an unlikely

source.
Freshman Daniel Flo had been
fairly quiet all season, competing in
just three matches, but on Saturday
he burst onto the scene in spectacu
lar fashion, rewarding his entry into
the lineup with a tidy 6-2, 6-1 win
over his opponent. Max Manthou,
out of the No. 6 position. Flo's victo
ry was followed up by No. 1 player
Bradley Klahn's 6-4, 6-4 triumph
over his familiar Husky foe, Jeevan
Nedunchezhiyan, putting Stanford
on the brink of victory. After a de
feat out of the No. 2 position for
Ryan Thacher, senior Alex Clayton
clinched the victory for Stanford
when he lost after a sloppy first set,
taking the match 4-6,6-3,6-1.

The atmosphere those two days
at the Taube Family Tennis Center
was lively, with fans coming to sup
port both teams.
"Taube Family Tennis Stadium is
definitely one of the best venues to
play at when there is a good crowd,"
said senior Ted Kelly. "College ten
nis is all about playing in front of
your best friends."
The Cardinal now will rest and
prepare for Thursday, May 19, when
the NCAA Tournament heads into
the round of 16. Stanford, seeded
eighth, will be taking on ninth-seed
ed Texas A&M at 6 p.m.
