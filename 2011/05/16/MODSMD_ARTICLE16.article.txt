# Grow up, Jorge Posada
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
Last week I talked about end
ings in sports and lo and
behold, the difficulty of end
ings reared its ugly head yet
again this week.
I am, of course, talking about the cat
fight between Jorge Posada and the New
York Yankees on Saturday. As many of
you loyal readers know, I grew up a Yan
kees fan, so the drama in the Bronx on
Saturday, when Posada refused to play
for the Yankees when he was slotted in
the No. 9 spot in the lineup, has been
chief on my mind ever since. (Some of
you might not care about Posada or the
Yankees, but I would venture a guess
that the Yankees have more fans at Stan
ford than any baseball team other than
the San Francisco Giants —this would
be great information to collect, Depart
ment of Admission).
Posada's frustration over his lacklus
ter start to the season —he is hitting just
.165, and the switch-hitter is hitless from
the right side of the plate and his sub
sequent relegation to the bottom of the
lineup is not just the a symbol of the wan
ing of a former star's career. Posada's
struggles, and his reaction to them,repre
sent a crossroads for sports' most-storied
franchise.
1n2009, when the Yankees won their
27th World Series Championship, they
were led by the so-called "core four"
Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte
and Mariano Rivera. Just a year and a
half later, Rivera is the only member of
the group still performing well. Pettitte is
retired, Posada was told to pack up his
catcher's gear in spring training and will
only be a DJJ (a change he is clearly
struggling with) and Jeter seems to have
lost his ability to lift the ball —there
have been loud calls for him to be

dropped from the leadoff spot. One
has to think that the 41-year-old
Rivera will eventually slow down as
well (but perhaps not).
The Yankees will always have the
ability to spend money to bring in good
players, but they won't necessarily
have the continuity and the leadership
that the core four previously provided.
Put more bluntly there seems to be
trouble in paradise.
Posada's tantrum wasn't the first
noteworthy show of frustration. There
were Jeter's all-too-public contract ne
gotiations last offseason. There have
also been the calls for Jeter to move
down in the lineup and questions as to
why Posada was moved and not Jeter.
The great Yankees teams of the '9os
and 'oos had then fair shares of internal
drama, but I'm not sure there was any
thing as dramatic as the winding down
of the careers of four Hall of Fame- or
borderline Hall of Fame-caliber stars.
There are so many layers to this
Posada rift, like the fact that Posada
and manager Joe Girardi clearly
weren't on the same page when it
came to Posada's alleged back stiffness
and general manager Brian Cash
man's midgame announcement of
Posada's insubordination. These are
not the sorts of relationships and

chasms that characterize a champi
onship organization. Is a major over
haul coming? Perhaps.
The question of whether Posada
would be forgiven, however, was
quickly answered by Yankees fans be
fore Sunday's 7-5 loss to the rival
Boston Red Sox.The fabled "Bleacher
Creatures" included Posada, who was
out of the starting lineup, in their
game-opening roll call. Still, if Posada
continues to struggle at the plate, he
will have no way to help the Yankee
team, even though he is making $l3
million this season. He doesn't play de
fense anymore, and when he is on base,
he clogs up the base paths. This situa
tion may have come to a head Satur
day, but it could get downright ugly if
things get worse.
Maybe this is all an overreaction.
Maybe if the Yankees hadn't entered
Sunday's game having lost eight of
their last 11, this wouldn't be a big deal.
History says Posada and Jeter will
begin to hit better than they have, and
Jeter has already shown some signs of
life. The Yankees' issues extend be
yond Posada, but if they are going to
continue to compete for World Series
titles, then the elder statesmen like
Posada can't be involving themselves
in little spats like Saturday's.

Daniel Bohm has a history of "little
spats " when the sandwich artists at Sub
