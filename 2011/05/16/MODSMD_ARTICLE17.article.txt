# Baseball takes a hit, drops two in Eugene

### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford baseball slipped back below .500 in
Pac-10 play in rainy Eugene this weekend, losing
twice to Oregon in a three-game series that could
have turned out much worse for the Cardinal.

Coming off a six-game winning streak, No. 25
Stanford (28-18,10-11 Pac-10) was outscored 14-3
by the Ducks in the first game and a half before
rallying for a dramatic Saturday victory behind
freshman hitting. But ninth-place Oregon (26-24-
1,7-14) came up with enough defensive gems on
Sunday to halt another late rally from the Cardi
nal, taking the series and pushing Stanford back to
sixth in the conference.
Stanford came into Eugene with a 4-6 record in
the series opener, and the unsettling trend contin
ued with another slow Cardinal start to the three

game set. Oregon lefthanderTyler Anderson (7-2)
was impressive in seven innings of work, yielding
just four hits and holding Stanford to one un
earned run.The Cardinal's only other tally came in
the ninth when freshman right fielder Austin
Wilson scored after a leadoff double that extend
ed his 12-game hit streak but after a five-day,
five-game stretch last week that saw Stanford
score six or more runs in each contest, the firepow
er on Friday fell short in a 6-2 loss.
Fewer than half of Oregon's batters were able
to figure out Cardinal starter Mark Appel; never
theless, of the four Ducks that had hits, a trio
second baseman Danny Pulfer, designated hitter
Kyle Garlick and shortstop KC Serna recorded
three each. Four Stanford errors and a season-high
five walks by Appel proved costly, with the sopho
more righthander falling to 4-6 on the season.
Matters were looking even worse for the Car
dinal on Saturday. After chasing senior Danny
Sandbrink with four runs in 1.1 innings, the Ducks
scored in each of the first five frames to build an 8-
1 lead. Juniors A.J. Talt and Chris Reed were final
ly able put a stopper to the Oregon onslaught and
give Stanford a chance to come back. The duo
combined for five spotless innings of relief and
gave up no hits to a Duck squad that had 23 base
knocks in the first 14 frames of the series.
Stanford loaded the bases with three singles to
start the sixth, and a pair of freshman bats sparked
the beginnings of a rally. One run came around on
a sacrifice fly by designated hitter Danny
Diekroeger, followed by a clutch, two-out double
by second baseman Lonnie Kauppila that cut the
Oregon lead to four.
To shut down Stanford in the seventh, the
Ducks brought in senior Kellen Moen, who led
Oregon pitchers in opposing batting average and
ERA coming into the contest. The move quickly
backfired.

In 34.1 innings this season, Moen had allowed
only six earned runs, yet it took Stanford just two
thirds of an inning to bridge the four-run gap. Se
nior catcher Zach Jones and sophomore center
fielder Tyler Gaffney battled from two-strike
counts to get on base with consecutive singles be
fore sophomore third baseman Stephen Piscotty
doubled on his first pitch to bring them both home.
Moen never had a chance to settle down, and
freshman first baseman Brian Ragira ripped a
triple on the next at-bat to cut the lead to one.
Moen was pulled, but sophomore shortstop
Kenny Diekroeger came through again for the
Cardinal with a game-tying single. An eighth-in
ning single by Jones made for a 9-8 lead, which
Stanford held for the victory.

Jones picked up where he left off in the rubber
game, leading off the game with a triple and com-
