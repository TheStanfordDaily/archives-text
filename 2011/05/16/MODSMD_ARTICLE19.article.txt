## No. 1 ASU overpowers Cardinal in Tempe 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball ended a strong regu
lar season on a bit of a downer last week
end, dropping two of three at No. 1 Ari
zona State. With the series loss, Stanford
ends its 2011 season at No. 11, finishing
with a very respectable 38-15 overall
record.

The Cardinal finished its brutal confer
ence schedule just under .500, with 10 wins
and 11 losses. That means Stanford closes
the year fifth in the eight-team conference,
one game behind Arizona and Oregon and
one ahead of both Washington and
UCLA. Seven of the eight Pac-10 teams
are ranked nationally in the top 15, making
it arguably the toughest and deepest con
ference in the country. Arizona State (50-6,
17-4 Pac-10) entered the series as the
unanimous number one in the polls, riding
a 12-game conference winning streak after
sweeping its last three series.
Thursday's 3-1 loss was a close game,
as the Card failed to convert despite op

portunities. Sun Devil Katelyn Boyd led
off the game with a solo home ran to left,
putting the Cardinal in an early hole.
Stanford loaded the bases in the first and
third innings but didn't tally until the
fifth, when junior shortstop Ashley
Hansen tied the game with her eighth
home run of the year.
Hansen was recently named one of ten
finalists for USA Softball's Player of the
Year, putting up career offensive numbers
for the Cardinal. She finished the season
batting an astounding .506 with a .568 on
base percentage, 24 doubles and nine
home runs. She went 7-for-ll with three
runs, two RBI and two home runs in the
ASU series.
Arizona State responded in the bottom
of the fifth, scoring twice on Krista Don
nenwirth's shallow single to center. Sopho
more pitcher Teagan Gerhart took the loss,
giving up six hits and an unusually high five
walks. Arizona State's rookie pitcher Dal
las Escobedo got the win.
On Friday, the Cardinal offense explod
ed for six runs to break Arizona State 's 12-
game winning streak. Stanford starter
Ashley Chinn and Gerhart combined to
limit the opposition to just one run on five
hits. Gerhart was credited with the win

after she took over in the third for
Chinn. ASU's Mackenzie Popescue
got tagged with the loss after giving
up four runs in just two and a third
innings of work.
Stanford relied heavily on the
long ball, with three players going
yard for the Cardinal. Junior center
fielder Sarah Hassman started the
scoring with a two-run shot in the
third, plating junior Jenna Becerra.

It was Hassman's first collegiate
home run. Hansen kept the inning
alive with an infield single, and jun
ior second baseman Jenna Rich
gave Stanford a 4-0 lead with a two
run home run of her own.

ASU would get its only run of the
game in the bottom of the third,
when catcher Katelyn Castillo drew
a walk, stole second and then pro
ceeded to score on two wild pitches
by Chinn.
In the fifth, Stanford picked up
another run as Rich singled in Hass
man for her third RBI of the game.
Hansen then capped off the scoring
for the Cardinal with a solo home
run in the top of the seventh.
Saturday's rubber match saw Es
cobedo dominate the Cardinal line
up. The Cardinal registered just four
hits two each by Hassman and
Hansen and only scored when
Escobedo pitched a four-walk third.
Gerhart also allowed just four hits,
but surrendered seven walks in al
lowing four earned runs.

All four ASU runs came in the
fifth. Boyd doubled in the first run,
and Stanford then intentionally
walked catcher Kaylyn Castillo,
which backfired when right fielder
Annie Lockwood lined a home run
to left. The one win and two losses
over the weekend push Gerhart to
22-11 on the year, while Escobedo's
two wins moved her to 27-3 on the
year.

With the regular season finished,
the Cardinal now turns its focus to
the playoffs, which start this week
end. Stanford earned a No. 15 seed
and will be hosting its regional,
which includes Nebraska, Pacific
and Fresno State. The Cardinal's
first postseason matchup is against
Pacific (37-17) on May 20.
