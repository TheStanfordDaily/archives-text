## No. 1 ASU overpowers Cardinal in Tempe 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Softball ended a strong regu
lar season on a bit of a downer last week
end, dropping two of three at No. 1 Ari
zona State. With the series loss, Stanford
ends its 2011 season at No. 11, finishing
with a very respectable 38-15 overall
record.

The Cardinal finished its brutal confer
ence schedule just under .500, with 10 wins
and 11 losses. That means Stanford closes
the year fifth in the eight-team conference,
one game behind Arizona and Oregon and
one ahead of both Washington and
UCLA. Seven of the eight Pac-10 teams
are ranked nationally in the top 15, making
it arguably the toughest and deepest con
ference in the country. Arizona State (50-6,
17-4 Pac-10) entered the series as the
unanimous number one in the polls, riding
a 12-game conference winning streak after
sweeping its last three series.
Thursday's 3-1 loss was a close game,
as the Card failed to convert despite op

portunities. Sun Devil Katelyn Boyd led
off the game with a solo home ran to left,
putting the Cardinal in an early hole.
Stanford loaded the bases in the first and
third innings but didn't tally until the
fifth, when junior shortstop Ashley
Hansen tied the game with her eighth
home run of the year.
Hansen was recently named one of ten
finalists for USA Softball's Player of the
Year, putting up career offensive numbers
for the Cardinal. She finished the season
batting an astounding .506 with a .568 on
base percentage, 24 doubles and nine
home runs. She went 7-for-ll with three
runs, two RBI and two home runs in the
ASU series.
Arizona State responded in the bottom
of the fifth, scoring twice on Krista Don
nenwirth's shallow single to center. Sopho
more pitcher Teagan Gerhart took the loss,
giving up six hits and an unusually high five
walks. Arizona State's rookie pitcher Dal
las Escobedo got the win.
On Friday, the Cardinal offense explod
ed for six runs to break Arizona State 's 12-
game winning streak. Stanford starter
Ashley Chinn and Gerhart combined to
limit the opposition to just one run on five
hits. Gerhart was credited with the win
