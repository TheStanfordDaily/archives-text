The No. 1 women's water polo team brought home a national championship on Sunday after defeating Cal in the
final of the NCAA Tournament, 9-5. The team avenged a loss in last year's final with Stanford's 101st team title.
"We passed the ball really well,"
said head coach John Tanner. "We
had good spacing in our frontcourt
offense and made some good deci
sions in front of the goal, giving us a
comfortable margin early. Every
one looked solid on the offensive
end."
The following day, Stanford
faced fourth-seeded USC in a re
match of last year's national cham
pionship game which Stanford
painfully lost, 10-9. The two squads
were quite familiar with each other,
as the semifinal matchup marked
their fourth meeting this season.
Two of the meetings this season
involved overtimes, including a 10-9
triple overtime game when Stan
ford and USC were ranked No. 1
and No. 2, respectively.
This time around, the Cardinal
made things a little less dramatic,
doubling up the Women of Troy 8-4.
Strong performances by senior
leaders were the theme of this game
and the weekend as a whole
against USC, senior driver Kim
Krueger led all scorers with three
goals.
"We work so hard in practice to
make practice just like the game,"
Krueger said. "I went out there and
did what I knew I could do. It really
helps when I know I have all my
teammates behind me."
Senior goalie Amber Oland,
meanwhile, had ten saves in the
cage and held USC to one goal in
the first half.
"We really focused on stopping

[USC's] 6-on-5," Oland said. "We
knew where they were shooting.
We've scouted them a ton and went
out there and executed."
Oland equaled USC's first-half
offensive production before the
match was over, scoring a goal of
her own on a pool-length toss with
1:05 left in the game.
The win over USC put Stanford
into the final against Cal. MPSF
Player of the Year and sophomore
two-meter Annika Dries led the of
fensive attack against the Bears
with a game-high five goals, avoid
ing any drama as she scored three
goals in the first half to give Stan
ford a comfortable 4-1 lead.
"We planned to give [Dries] the
ball," Tanner said. "They don't have
defenders that can match up with
her. She was unreal so explosive
and determined. Our whole team
did a great job of setting her up."
On the defensive end, Oland had
another stellar performance with
eleven stops. She stopped a penalty
shot that led to an offensive run by
the Cardinal, padding its lead to 6-1
early into the second half.
"Between [Krueger] and
[Oland], they had their two best
games each in their four-year ca
reers," Tanner said.
Stanford defeated Cal for the
second time this season by a final
score of 9-5 to claim the national
title. Oland, Dries, Seidemann and
Krueger were named to the NCAA
All-Tournament First Team with
Dries named as the Most Valuable
Player.
"It was a wonderful day," Tanner
said.
