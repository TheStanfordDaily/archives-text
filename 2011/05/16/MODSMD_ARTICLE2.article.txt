### KEVIN ZHANG DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford's No. 1 women's water
polo team went into Sunday with
thirty straight victories against Cal,
going undefeated against the cross
bay rival since 2000. The Cardinal
(28-1) continued that streak when it
mattered most yesterday, earning an
emphatic 9-5 win over the No. 2
Bears (24-4) in the National Colle
giate Championship final.

After the third-place MPSF
Tournament finish that failed to give
Stanford an automatic berth, the
Cardinal still managed to earn an at
large bid and the No. 1 seed of the
NCAA Tournament that took place
last weekend in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Stanford's first opponent in the
eight-team tournament was lona
College on Friday. The Cardinal
started the tournament on the right
foot, scoring a season-high 22 goals
while holding lona to just seven. Ju
nior two-meter Melissa Seidemann
led all scorers with five, while junior
driver Alyssa Lo and freshmen
driver Kaitlyn Lo both had hat
tricks.
