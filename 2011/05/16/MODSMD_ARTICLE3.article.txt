## Stanford clarifies policy on student right to protest 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
The last three weeks have brought a slew of protests
to campus, including the April 29 protest of the Faculty
Senate's decision to recognize ROTC and last Wednes
day's rally for janitors set to lose their jobs. Flowever,
some students have regarded the University's policy on
campus disruptions with confusion.
Protestors in two rallies organized by the student
group Stanford Says No To War (SSNW) were frustrat
ed after being interrupted on two separate occasions at
the Law School. The students sought to rally against ap
pearances by UC-Berkeley professor John Yoo on
April 22 and political science professor and former U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on May 6.
"We're trying to create an open forum of discussion
in a non-disruptive, non-hostile way," said Josh Schott
'l4.
By not allowing students to do so, Stanford is "not
living up to that policy," he added.
In an email to The Daily, University spokesperson
Lisa Lapin clarified Stanford's policy toward on-cam
pus protests. The University officially designates White
Plaza as its free speech area and forbids disruptions
elsewhere that disturb University events or officials.
In addition, Stanford asks to be notified about for
mal protests and gives approval for some protests to
occur outside of White Plaza. Students were given per
mission to stage the ROTC protest in front of the Law
School, but the University did not receive any other
registrations for protests in that location.
The SSNW-organized protests opposed the appear
ances of Yoo and Rice because of both speakers' rela
tionship with torture.
"We were protesting that the University was invit
ing individuals who have legalized torture and there
fore are war criminals," said Schott, who participated in
both protests. "By doing this, the University is legit
imizing torture."
In order to convey this point to event attendees,
Schott and others posted and distributed flyers at the
door to the Law School auditorium, where the speech
es took place. They were all escorted out of the build
ing and were asked to join a protest outside, where oth-
ers were holding a rally.
Schott said his group had offi
cially registered to attend the
speeches and believed that it had a
right to be inside the building.
Judicial Affairs policy states that
students cannot "prevent or disrupt
the effective carrying out of a Uni
versity function or approved activi
ty," like the Law School events.
However, Schott said he made a
point not to disturb the event,
claiming that he and his colleagues
only sought to inform speech atten
dees.

"Any [student] can go out and
start handing out flyers in any
building they want to; that's not a
violation of the rules," he said.
Schott did note that, after talk
ing to building managers, the
group's flyers were put back up on
Law School walls. Still, the group
was forced to leave the building.
Lapin said the ban on unregis
tered protests extends to the events
themselves but mentioned that she
was unaware of the recent SSNW
protests.

"No one [is] allowed to protest
inside an event," Lapin said.
Barriers to free speech at Stan
ford have been challenged several
times. In late January, a report by
the Foundation for Individual
Rights in Education (FIRE), a non
profit dedicated to free speech,
named Stanford a "red-light"
school for its free speech restric-

tions. The report cited limited ac
cess to free speech policies, includ
ing a password barrier that only al
lowed full access to individuals with
a SUNet ID.

Following FIRE's ranking, the
password protection on these poli
cies was removed, and FIRE now

lists Stanford as a "yellow-light"
school. Still, this ranking describes
Stanford as having "at least one am
biguous policy that too easily en
courages administrative abuse and
arbitrary application," according to
the FIRE website. The policy on
free speech in White Plaza is cited
as one such ambiguous policy.

Students have also taken action
by starting "Free Speech Fridays,"
an hour-long open microphone ses
sion to allow students to publicly
share their ideas every Friday from
noon to 1 p.m. in White Plaza. That
period is the only hour on week
days in which the University per
mits amplified sound in White
Plaza, as long as students make a
prior reservation with Student Ac
tivities and Leadership.
University policy is written to
protect these free speech rights.
"The university setting is exactly
the place for the exchange of ideas
and open discourse," Lapin said.
"To censor debate or exclude view
points would be contrary to the
mission of the University, which
values freedom of expression and
upholds freedom of speech."

Schott contended this view
point, citing an earlier incident
where protestors passed out flyers
about Rice in front of the Stanford
Bookstore and were told to leave,
because the University is private
property.

By definitions from Student Ac
tivities and Leadership, the Book
store opens onto White Plaza.
"It's a climate of trying to keep
the students quiet," Schott said.
"The students aren't trying to dis
rupt; the students aren't trying to
create a hostile environment. The
students are just trying to dissemi
nate information on who the per
son is who is signing the books or
giving the lecture."
