## Stanford clarifies policy on student right to protest

The last three weeks have brought a slew of protests
to campus, including the April 29 protest of the Faculty
Senate's decision to recognize ROTC and last Wednes

In order to convey this point to event attendees,
Schott and others posted and distributed flyers at the
