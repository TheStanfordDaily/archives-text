# SHOTS FIRED NEARLAG
## Two suspects released after questioning; investigation into motive still ongoing, police say 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
According to the Stanford
University Department of Pub
lic Safety (SUDPS), multiple
shots were fired in the Lagunita
parking lot at 7:17 p.m. on the
evening of Saturday, May 14.
The authorities have since de
tained and questioned possible
suspects and reported that no
one was injured.
The Stanford police alerted
students via email and text a lit
tle after 8 p.m., stating that one
"outstanding suspect" is a black
male, aged 18 to 20, "with a slen
der build and long dreadlocks."
The suspect may have been
armed with a silver handgun.
In a subsequent announce
ment to the campus, the Stan
ford police said, "it is unknown
if any of the gunshots were di
rected at an individual." Wit
nesses saw an individual firing
several gunshots into the park
ing lot asphalt before fleeing
the scene in a vehicle, said to be
a white Lexus.
An officer responding to the
incident identified and pursued
the vehicle in question. During
the police chase, the vehicle's
two passengers exited and made
a run for the wooded area bor
dered by Campus Drive, Quarry
Road, Palm Drive and El
Camino Real. Police later

brought two individuals found
in that vicinity into custody for
questioning.
"The suspects were de
tained, questioned, then re
leased," said Stanford police
sergeant Chris Cohendet. The
authorities are currently trying
to locate the firearm, he added.
A second vehicle involved in
the incident is described as an
older car with two scissor doors
and large rims. The car is said to
be burnt orange, brown or gold
in color. According to Cohen
det, that vehicle's driver is still
at large, and the police are still
trying to follow up on this lead.
"The driver of the second
vehicle was observed waving a
handgun, possibly silver in
color, out of the open window
on the driver's side of the vehi
cle as he left the scene on Santa
Teresa Street," read an alert by
the Stanford police. "One wit
ness described the driver wav
ing the handgun as a black male
wearing a baseball cap with a
red brim."
At present, the investigation
is still ongoing, and a motiva
tion for the incident has not yet
been determined.
"We're still actively investi
gating it," Cohendet said.
He noted that "there were a
couple of events on campus"
happening around the time of the
shooting, one of which was Black -
fest, a concert that took place at
Roble Field, across the street from
the Lagunita parking lot.
"I don't know if this was associ
ated with that event, but the shoot
ing happened right after," Cohen
det said.
"It is unclear whether the appre
hended suspects have any Universi
ty affiliation," said University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. "At the
moment, it appears that they
don't."
While suspects have been de
tained and questioned, the investi
gation is still an open case and more
information will be available in the
days to come.
"We don't believe there is any
threat or danger to the campus,"
Lapin said.
"I think that it is an isolated inci
dent," Cohendet concurred.
"It is concerning when someone
is carrying a firearm on campus," he
said. "But I don't think the motive
of this was to hurt anyone."
