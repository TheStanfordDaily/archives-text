## Yearly refund rate sees little change Number of requests up from fall quarter.; but total dollar amount refunded drops 
### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
Compared to last spring, this quarter's special fees refund re
quests have remained consistent.The total dollar amount request
ed, however, has dropped by half from spring quarter 2010, ac
cording to data provided by Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE).
In the first two weeks of every quarter, students have the op
tion to request a refund of special fees paid to volunteer student
organizations (VSO) through their University bills; The Daily is
one group that receives special fees. Requests are logged through
a Stanford-hosted page, where students can pick and choose those
groups from which they wish to receive a refund. Alternatively,
they can opt out completely from paying special fees, which total
$lll per quarter in the current academic year.
In this spring's two-week refund period, 957 undergraduates
requested refunds, and 356 of these were full refund requests. The
total amount refunded from all groups was $51,957.67, with the
average refund asking for $54.29.
These numbers are similar to the refund rate in spring quarter
2010, which saw 959 requests and 322 full refunds. However, a
much higher amount was refunded then $99,776 was returned
to students, with the average refund
totaling $lO4.
These statistics are still "fright
eningly high," according to Senate
Appropriations Chair Brianna
Pang 'l3, who is also a current Daily
staff member.

Past years have shown an up
ward trend in refund requests over
the course of the academic year. Ac
cording to Pang, this trend is due to a
rising awareness of the refunds
process.

Indeed, fall quarter 2010's statis
tics are much lower, with 559 refund
requests and 429 full refunds. In the
fall, $56,245 was requested back,
making the average refund request
$lOO.

The Appropriations Committee,
which is responsible for running the
special fees process, is working on
figuring out why students are re
questing special fees refunds from
student groups and why certain
groups are targeted over others.
"That's the flaw in the refund sys
tem that should be fixed," said Pang.
"We have no data why some groups
are getting more money refunded
than others."

Pang posited three reasons why
students might request refunds from
a group: the fees are a financial bur
den, students are morally and ethi
cally opposed to the group or stu
dents do not see themselves using
the group's services.

"I don't think that most students
here want to hurt a group's function
ality," said Senate Chair Rafael
Vazquez'l2.
Rather, he continued, students are
attracted by "free money." According
to Pang, when students on financial
aid request refunds, the money actu
ally returns to their pockets instead
of the Financial Aid Office.

Another problem is that students
may still take advantage of a group's
services after refunding that group;
groups only receive a list of the
SUID numbers of students who de

cline to pay their fees.
In order to combat this trend,
Pang, Vazquez and ASSU President
Michael Cruz 'l2 are currently fo
cused on passing a bill through the
Senate to reform the special fees re
fund process.

"This is something that has been
pushed by the VSO leaders, basical
ly, for the past three years," Vazquez
said.

The bill would require students
to provide a rationale for requesting
refunds. It would also make avail
able their names and SUID num
bers to the president and financial
officer of the specific groups from
which they demand refunds.
"It's then up to the president and
financial officer to figure out
whether or not they want to bar the
individual from their services," Pang
said.

"It gives the group more owner
ship to give their services to the peo
ple who pay for the services,"
Vazquez added.
Pang and Vazquez have also at
tempted to address concerns about
privacy by including a consequences
clause in the bill. If the president or
financial officer publicly releases
the names of the students who re
quested refunds, then those stu
dents have a right to file a case
against them with Judicial Affairs.
Pang added that releasing the
list of students who refunded would
not solve all of the problems with
enforcement.

In order to help alleviate some
of those issues, Vazquez is in sup
port of an initiative to require stu
dents to appear in person to the
ASSU offices in Old Union to re
quest special fees refunds.
The reform bill will be up for de
bate this Tuesday and will be put to
a vote next Tuesday.
Vazquez and Pang shared high
hopes for the bill but expressed
doubts that they would ever see a
zero refund rate.

"We're in a recession," Vazquez
said, "Whatever money people can
get, they will [try to] get."
