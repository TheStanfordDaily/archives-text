### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
Compared to last spring, this quarter's special fees refund re
quests have remained consistent.The total dollar amount request
ed, however, has dropped by half from spring quarter 2010, ac
cording to data provided by Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE).
In the first two weeks of every quarter, students have the op
tion to request a refund of special fees paid to volunteer student
organizations (VSO) through their University bills; The Daily is
one group that receives special fees. Requests are logged through
a Stanford-hosted page, where students can pick and choose those
groups from which they wish to receive a refund. Alternatively,
they can opt out completely from paying special fees, which total
$lll per quarter in the current academic year.
In this spring's two-week refund period, 957 undergraduates
requested refunds, and 356 of these were full refund requests. The
total amount refunded from all groups was $51,957.67, with the
average refund asking for $54.29.
These numbers are similar to the refund rate in spring quarter
2010, which saw 959 requests and 322 full refunds. However, a
much higher amount was refunded then $99,776 was returned
