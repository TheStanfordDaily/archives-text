## KZSU retains rights to football, men's basketball 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When news first broke that a new radio
station, KNBR 1050 AM, had won exclu
sive rights to broadcast the Cardinal's foot
ball and men's basketball games starting
this fall, officials at KZSU 90.1 FM, the stu
dent-run radio station on campus, started
asking where the deal left them.
"I wasn't concerned when I heard about
a deal being made," said KZSU sports di
rector J.D. Haddon 'l3. "It's more when I

was reading the press releases by KNBR.
Some of the language they used, I wouldn't
say concerned me, but confused me about
what it meant for us."
The station first heard about the change
in the sports' broadcasting home when stu
dents at KZSU came across online reports
and brought them to Haddon's attention.
KZSU business manager Abra Jeffers, a
graduate student in Management Science
& Engineering, said this caused the station
to question whether it would be able to
continue carrying the Cardinal's football

and men's basketball games next year.
"When we saw the news about the po
tential contract, we weren't informed
ahead of time," she said. "So we were con
cerned."
But last Wednesday, KZSU announced
that it would retain its ability to broadcast
these two sports next year and that the con
tract with KNBR would have no impact on
its current sports coverage. The station is
also the exclusive broadcaster for Cardinal
baseball and women's basketball
games, among other sports.

Haddon said KZSU received
confirmation of its broadcast rights
from Eric Kwait, the general manag
er of Cardinal Sports LLC. Cardinal
Sports LLC, a property of Learfield
Sports, is the exclusive multimedia
rights holder for Stanford Athletics.
Kwait did not respond to re
quests for comment from The Daily.

Haddon said that KZSU would
be able to continue its coverage be
cause of its status as a student-run
non-profit station.
"We don't go through the same
process that a commercial station
would go through," he said. "I'm
sure KNBR has exclusive rights in
terms of the fact that no other com
mercial station would be able to
cover those sports, but I think why
we don't conflict is because we are
considered a different entity as a
whole."

There remains, however, some
confusion over how KZSU receives
its rights to broadcast Stanford ath
letics. Both Haddon and Jeffers said
they were not aware of any written
contracts with the University that
delineates these rights.

"If there are contracts with
KZSU, I've never seen them," Had
don said. "From my understanding,
it's much more of an assumed rela
tionship."
Haddon said he is currently
working on trying to find out how
these rights are given to the station.
He believes it might be tied to the
fact that the station's FM license is
owned by Stanford's Board of
Trustees and given to KZSU's
Board of Directors to oversee the
station's operations. The Board of
Directors consists of University fac
ulty and staff members, two KZSU
staff members, one student and the
general manager of a local public
television and radio station, all of
whom are appointed by the Univer
sity's president.
"It would be kind of circular logic
for them to draw up some sort of
contract," Haddon said. "Stanford
gives the right to broadcast Stanford
sports to KZSU, which in turn
means they gave it to the Board of
Trustees, which in turn means they
just gave it to Stanford. That kind of
makes no sense,"
But Haddon said that while there
may not be an official contract,
KZSU has always been on good
terms with the University and that
this announcement only serves as a
confirmation of their relationship.
"I've always felt respected by
Stanford Athletics," he said. "I never
felt at all that they were trying to do
anything behind our backs."

He called men's basketball and
football the "pillars" of the sports
department and said the loss of
these sports would have been
"tremendous on many levels." He
cited the fact that football is the sta
tion's most listened to program.
"To lose two of the major sports
on campus, that would have been a
huge blow in terms of building a re
lationship with the Stanford com
munity and in terms of what we can
cover," Haddon said. "It would have
also been a financial blow."

KZSU, in fact, receives outside
contributions. Haddon said many of
these come from listeners of the sta
tion's football and men's basketball
coverage. Jeffers confirmed that
these sports fans help with KZSU's
operating expenses and allow the
station to cover away games, giving
it funding for airfare and hotel
rooms.

She also said the loss of these
sports would have had a huge im
pact on the station.
"We were really concerned
about what we perceived as a poten
tial loss of two of our most important
sports," Jeffers said. "But we were
just hoping that our good relation
ship with the University wasn't
going to change, and we are thrilled
that's the case."
