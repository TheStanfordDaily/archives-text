## KZSU retains rights to football, men's basketball 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When news first broke that a new radio
station, KNBR 1050 AM, had won exclu
sive rights to broadcast the Cardinal's foot
ball and men's basketball games starting
this fall, officials at KZSU 90.1 FM, the stu
dent-run radio station on campus, started
asking where the deal left them.
"I wasn't concerned when I heard about
a deal being made," said KZSU sports di
rector J.D. Haddon 'l3. "It's more when I

was reading the press releases by KNBR.
Some of the language they used, I wouldn't
say concerned me, but confused me about
what it meant for us."
The station first heard about the change
in the sports' broadcasting home when stu
dents at KZSU came across online reports
and brought them to Haddon's attention.
KZSU business manager Abra Jeffers, a
graduate student in Management Science
& Engineering, said this caused the station
to question whether it would be able to
continue carrying the Cardinal's football

and men's basketball games next year.
"When we saw the news about the po
tential contract, we weren't informed
ahead of time," she said. "So we were con
cerned."
But last Wednesday, KZSU announced
that it would retain its ability to broadcast
these two sports next year and that the con
tract with KNBR would have no impact on
its current sports coverage. The station is
also the exclusive broadcaster for Cardinal
