In Monday's article "Yearly re
fund rate sees little change," The
Daily incorrectly reported that the
officers of special-fees groups cur
rently have the right to a list of the
SUID numbers of individuals who
refunded their group. In fact, this
policy was overturned.
It was also incorrectly reported
that, under a proposed bill to reform
the refund process, students could
file a case with Judicial Affairs if
VSOs released their names to the
public. In fact, the bill only states
that students can file a case with the
"appropriate judicial body."
