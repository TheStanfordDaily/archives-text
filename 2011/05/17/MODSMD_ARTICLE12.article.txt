## Guatemala's Wise 'Doctor Pablo' Pediatrics professor Paul Wise has spent the past 40 summers volunteering, training and researching in the Guatemalan highlands

In San Juan El Mirador, a traditional
town in the highlands of Guatemala
2,500 miles from Stanford, pediatrics
professor Paul Wise is working to trans
form the local medical scene.
"Doctor Pablo," as the locals affectionately
call him, has been traveling to Guatemala for
40 years now, ever since he was a teenager. He
has met with doctors, policymakers and clinics
from the area in an attempt to bring the tiny

Guatemalan town up to Western medical
standards. Last summer, local health promot
ers honored him with a ceremony.
Wise first visited Guatemala the summer
after his freshman year at Cornell University.
He had been interested in marine biology
specifically sharks but was thinking about
pursuing something that would have more of
an immediate impact on the world. He headed
to Guatemala to get a glimpse of the "real
world."
He got his wish. The hospital ward Wise
was assigned to was full of severely mainour

ished children, with two to three children for
every one bed. Initially, Wise was angry with
the parents for letting their children become
so sick. But when Sunday came and the local
parents were allowed to visit their children,
Wise saw that the problem was neither neglect
nor lack of love. It had to do with the overar
ching medical care system.
That was 1970.
Wise, who is now a pediatrics professor at
the Stanford School of Medicine and senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies (FSI), has since returned
to Guatemala each summer to provide med
ical care, train local health promoters, conduct
research and talk to various organizations and
agencies.

Professor Paul Wise, known to the locals as
"Doctor Pablo," provides medical care for
underserved communities in Guatemala
every summer.
"You have to get out and go to
these places," Wise said. "You can't
do justice work in Guatemala sitting
in Palo Alto."
Jake Rosenberg, a student purs
ing a joint MD/PhD at the Stanford
School of Medicine, accompanied
Wise on one of his trips last summer.
Rosenberg said that Wise's work al
ways emphasized caring for each pa
tient with individualized attention.
"Wise very much encouraged
that you treat a patient in
Guatemala with the same standards
you would treat your mother [or as]
you would treat a patient at Stan
ford Hospital," Rosenberg said.
Wise earned his bachelor's de
gree in Latin American studies and
his medical degree from Cornell
University, as well as a master's of
public health from the Harvard
School of Public Health. After
spending the first 23 years of his ac
ademic life at Harvard Medical
School, Harvard School of Public
Health and Boston University
School of Medicine, Wise came to
Stanford in 2004.
"I was here maybe three weeks
and I was asked to do an informal
brown bag lunch seminar [to talk
about my research]," Wise said, re
calling his first month at Stanford.
"It was over the summer, and I did
n't expect many people to attend."
But to Wise's surprise, there
were two Nobel Prize winners
among the attendees.
"This would have never hap
pened at Harvard," he continued.
"It struck me that this is such an in
timate university ... The intimacy
and the ability to craft intensely
across disciplinary kinds of work is
very special here."
In fact. Wise's interest lies in in
terdisciplinary discourse, and he
works "right smack in the middle of
the interaction" between technolo
gy and social justice.

"A theme that has run through
my life and continues to be the core
of my academic work is the relation
ship between technical innovation
and questions of social justice,"
Wise said.
Gesturing to the Clark Center as
a meeting place of technology, de
sign and innovation, he emphasized
the importance of respecting tech
nological change while at the same
time recognizing that technological
innovation raises profound ques
tions of justice.
"You can be an intensive care
doctor, or a neonatologist, or a sur
geon, and that is extremely relevant
to the kinds of justice questions that
take place in rural Guatemala, the
Eastern Congo or in Burma," Wise
said. "These are not disconnected."
Wise's work in Guatemala is not
only about providing physical care
for the patients, but also the less tan
gible, yet much-needed, follow-up
care. He described that part of a
health promoter's role is not just to
translate the language, but also to
translate the culture. He added that
sometimes, the patients who need
care have no obvious disease or
symptoms their problems are
nothing like those that you could
understand as a physician working
solely in Palo Alto.
For this reason, Wise is not only a
physician during his visits to
Guatemala, but also a research fig
ure who trains local people to work
on and deal with their uniquely
local situations.
"I strongly believe that we have a
role to play and can make a differ
ence, even freshmen undergraduate
students," Wise said. "I've been to a
lot of very 'complicated' environ
ments, war-torn areas, and what I
don't want students to ever feel is
immobilized ... particularly those
getting into technical career paths
[like] medicine or biodesign."
"[They] have to recognize that
the work they do is directly relevant
to questions of justice," he added.
