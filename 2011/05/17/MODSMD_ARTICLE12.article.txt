In San Juan El Mirador, a traditional
town in the highlands of Guatemala
2,500 miles from Stanford, pediatrics
professor Paul Wise is working to trans
form the local medical scene.
"Doctor Pablo," as the locals affectionately
call him, has been traveling to Guatemala for
40 years now, ever since he was a teenager. He
has met with doctors, policymakers and clinics
from the area in an attempt to bring the tiny

Guatemalan town up to Western medical
standards. Last summer, local health promot
ers honored him with a ceremony.
Wise first visited Guatemala the summer
after his freshman year at Cornell University.
He had been interested in marine biology
specifically sharks but was thinking about
pursuing something that would have more of
an immediate impact on the world. He headed
to Guatemala to get a glimpse of the "real
world."
He got his wish. The hospital ward Wise
was assigned to was full of severely mainour

ished children, with two to three children for
every one bed. Initially, Wise was angry with
the parents for letting their children become
so sick. But when Sunday came and the local
parents were allowed to visit their children,
Wise saw that the problem was neither neglect
nor lack of love. It had to do with the overar
ching medical care system.
That was 1970.
Wise, who is now a pediatrics professor at
the Stanford School of Medicine and senior
fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for In
ternational Studies (FSI), has since returned
to Guatemala each summer to provide med
ical care, train local health promoters, conduct
research and talk to various organizations and
agencies.
