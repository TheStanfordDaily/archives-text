# OPINIONS
## I HAVE TWO HEADS The
						Parent Trap 
### Rachel Kolb 
I'm going to begin this column
with a confession. Since coming
to Stanford, I think that only a
handful of days have gone by in
which I haven't talked to some
member of my family. Okay, so from
my standpoint that wasn't a confes
sion. It was more of a declaration of
fact. Simply put, my family is impor
tant to me yet I've traveled
through my time at Stanford ob
serving a range of complex attitudes
that college students can have to
ward their families, particularly par
ents or parental units.

College is a time of renegotiating
our relationships with our parents.
To restate some old bildungsroman
esque truths, it is a time of pursuing
independence, of discovering one's
identity away from home and also
of establishing our position as
adults even with the people with
whom we can sometimes feel most
like children. We all, I think, can feel
a divide between our home selves
and our school selves, between what
we were and what we are becoming,
and between what different groups
of people perceive us to be. Our re
lationships with family, perhaps like
nothing else, can bring this problem
into sharper relief.
To return to the point: while at
Stanford, I've noticed that my peers
demonstrate two general viewpoints
when talking about their parents.
Some people, like me, freely admit to
keeping in constant touch, some
times to the point of excusing them
selves from conversations to make
phone calls home. Others shrug and
shift their eyes as if to say, "Parents?
Oh, I forgot, I haven't talked to mine
in about two weeks." Likewise, when
I travel home and attend so-called
"grown-up" gatherings, the perspec
tives I encounter among the parents
there follow the same mold. Families
either appear well connected and
well informed about each other's
lives or they sigh and say, "Little
Jimmy's fallen off the face of the
earth since he went off to school. I
just trust him to be safe."
Total connection or total discon
nection: these are the extremes that
bound our rediscovered relation
ships with our parents, and it seems
healthy to settle into a spot some
where in between. This can be chal
lenging, seeing as our society also
circulates dual perceptions over
what can characterize modern par
ent-child interactions. First of all, we
have all heard about the growing
trend of micromanaging parents, or
members of the baby boomer gener
ation-slash-economic elite who ex
cessively invest in their children's
success to the extent of rendering
said children incapable of making
their own decisions. On the other
hand, we have also all encountered
assumptions of youthful independ
ence through dismemberment
namely, that young people, after
their stormy adolescent years, will
naturally proceed to sever the last
frayed ties of their filial relation
ships when they head off to college.
According to this viewpoint, college
begins a turbo leap into the adult di
mension or represents the casting
off point when the ship sails for the
western horizon: whichever analogy
you prefer, the bottom line is "Bye
bye, mom and dad, I'm on my way."
I'll be blunt: I believe that nei
ther approach demonstrates what a

strong parent-child bond should be,
even though I have seen both in ac
tion at Stanford. As college stu
dents, we should be neither para
lyzed by our parents' overinvest
ment in our lives nor so shortsight
ed that we fail to realize the benefits
of sustaining a closer interactive re
lationship. Now, from a cynical
point of view those benefits are sim
ply material: for many of us, after
all, it is our parents who foot our tu
ition bill. Yet it is also our parents
who have, in large part, worked to
provide us with the opportunities
that we have. I think most Stanford
students I have met realize this, but
in the flurry of campus life, it can be
easy to forget the larger context of
our family structure and of why
those relationships matter.
During a recent conversation I
had with my mother, the topic of
parent-child relationships came up.
We began discussing the metaphys
ical concept that parents feel no
"us-them" barrier with their chil
dren, and that children are similarly
heedless of parental boundaries. In
other words, among family, "What's
yours is mine." This struck me as a
central tenet of the parental-rela
tions dilemma that college students
can face. Many of us might have
gone about our younger lives feel
ing no barrier between our parents
and ourselves, in terms of resources
or shared language or finance or
even personal space. Now we find
ourselves pressed to establish clear
boundaries about our lives and the
future directions that we would like
to take. When these boundaries in
volve family members, we are not
always sure of where to draw the
line.

While at Stanford, like the rest of
my peers, I have had to strike my
own balance about how to involve
my family in my life while also pur
suing my own independence. Call it
an adjustment period. Call it self
reinvention or realignment. I just
feel fortunate that, even though the
content and the context of our con
versations might have changed
since I left home, the dialogue has
not stopped.

Total connection or total
disconnection: these are
the extremes that
bound our rediscovered
relationships with our
parents.
