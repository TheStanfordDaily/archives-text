# FRESHLY BAKED
## Space Kimchi 
### Tim Moon 
Two years ago, a friend and I
made a documentary for a
film class about multiracial
students and their experiences at
Stanford. One, who was half Chi
nese, mentioned in her interview
how she had never felt attracted to
the Asian-American community at
Stanford, saying, "I feel like at times
they do become very stereotyped,
just to be very honest. They become
about getting boba, or about eating
Asian food, or about other things
like that, which to me are cultural
elements, but that's not what it's re
ally about."

As someone who thinks that
food is an incredibly important part
of our lives, I've always found this
statement really interesting. Cer
tainly, food isn't all there is to a cul

ture, but isn t it at least a part of it!
Are things like music, art and histo
ry really more what a culture is
"about" than cuisine?
There's a quote floating around
out there that goes, "What is patri
otism but the love of the food one
ate as a child?" Now, I don't know
that the love of the food you eat as a
child is the equivalent of patriotism,
but food is certainly an important
part of a cultural identity. Take, for
instance, the country of my parents,
South Korea. If I asked you to name
a Korean food, kimchi would surely
be one of the first to come to mind,
and not without reason; Koreans
are crazy about kimchi. During the
Vietnam War, canned kimchi was
delivered to Korean soldiers after
South Korea's president wrote a let
ter to President Johnson saying that
the soldiers were miserable without
kimchi, and the prime minister, de
livering the letter, told Johnson that
when abroad, he missed kimchi
more than his wife. In 2008, Yi So-
Yeon, the first South Korean in
space, brought along a specially en
gineered space-friendly version
that South Korean scientists spent
years of research and millions of
dollars to develop. And last year,
South Korea was hit with the Great
Cabbage Shortage of 2010, leading
to a spike in the prices of Napa cab
bage, a key ingredient of kimchi,
and forcing the government to sus
pend import duties on cabbages in
an attempt to cope with the situa
tion. Koreans and kimchi might be a
bit of an extreme example, but in
cases like this, food is more than just
what people like to eat, it's an im
portant element of identity, of na
tional pride.

Cultural groups at Stanford pro
vide both opportunities for students
of a particular culture or students
interested in that culture to meet
and interact as well as opportunities

to share that culture with the
greater Stanford community. How
well they do at providing these op
portunities is up for debate and
varies from group to group, but for
the most part, I would contest the
characterization of these groups as
being "about getting boba or about
eating Asian food," as most groups
seem to make an effort to also ex
plore those elements of culture that
it is "really about." At least, that's
what it seems like based on all the
emails I get.

See, I can't remember the last
time that I went to a cultural event
that didn't involve food. As a bona
fide "twinkie," so to speak, I've
never been particularly attracted to
the Asian-American community
here either, and flyers advertising
culture nights and Asian-American
speakers talking about Asian-
American issues just haven't
piqued my interest. But if a flyer
promises a delicious respite from
normal dining hall food? I'm there.
And a lot of people seem to feel
this way, as the food events I've
been to are generally well attended.
Maybe this was the source of my in
terviewee's discontent with cultural
groups, that the food events can be
superficial in that they attract peo
ple who might not be particularly
interested in that culture and are
only there for the dumplings.
And maybe that's true. Maybe
most of these people will eat their
plate of mandu that they think are
gyoza and leave, but maybe some
will ask why it's called mandu and
learn a little something. And even if
they don't, they've still been ex
posed to a little piece of that culture,
just the same as if they'd seen a
dance or heard a pop song. Food is
just as important a part of culture as
anything else, and by holding events
where people can be exposed to the
food of a culture (speaking of
which, many kudos to Stanford
Dining for last week's Spring Faire),
cultural groups can reach a greater
audience.

After saying the word "kimchi" so
many times, Tim is really craving
some. Tell him where to get the best at
