## TOURNEY ROMPS No. 1 Cardinal sweeps past UIC, Pepperdine 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The 2011 NCAA Champi
onships began brilliantly for the de
fending national champion Stan
ford women's tennis team, which
recorded two shutouts to make it to
the second weekend of the tourna
ment. The Cardinal overwhelmed

University of Illinois-Chicago on
Saturday before defeating No. 27
Pepperdine on Sunday.
This year marks the 30th consec

utive season Stanford has made an
appearance in the NCAA Tourna
ment. Stanford is undefeated on the
year with 24 wins, including an 8-0
record in Pac-10 play.
The result against Illinois Chica
go on Saturday was typical of the
Cardinal's performance all season,
but the players that achieved it
were not. Stanford played without

two of its top players, sophomore
Stacey Tan and freshman Kristie
Ahn. Both were resting minor in
juries.

For doubles, Ahn's partner,
freshman Nicole Gibbs, paired up
with junior Veronica Li. In singles,
senior Jennifer Yen replaced Tan at
the sixth spot. Gibbs and Li proved
a dominating duo, recording an 8-0
win at the second spot. Stanford
won the doubles point when senior
Hilary Barte and sophomore Mal
lory Burdette recorded an 8-1 win
at the top spot.
"[Burdette] played probably the
best doubles I've ever seen her play
with me," Barte said.

Head coach Lele Forood talked
about what in Burdette's play has
made her better recently.
"She's hitting touch shots and
tough volleys," Forood said. "She's
hitting better overheads, and her
game is coming together. She's
doing more things well on the dou
bles court. She's becoming an even
more versatile doubles player."
No. 18 Nicole Gibbs lost just one
game on the way to a 6-0,6-1 victo
ry over Ilinca Cristescu. Second off
the court was senior Carolyn
McVeigh, defeating Jana Knoppe
6-2, 6-1. The clincher came at the
top spot thanks to Barte. Ranked
third in the nation, Barte received a
fight from her opponent, Mariya
Kovaleva. Barte won just one game
in the first set, but responded by
winning 12 games in a row for a 1-6,
6-0,6-0 victory.
"I don't know what was happen
ing [in singles]," Barte said. "I was
kind of low energy, and my concen
tration was all over the place. After
I lost the first set, she kind of settled
down, and I just got into my grove.
It was my first match in a while. It
was nice to play three sets though,
as weird as that sounds. It was nice
to have a mental performance like
that."

Sunday's fight against Pepper
dine proved to be a tougher con
test, but Stanford had Tan back in
the lineup to help out. Tan, pairing
up with McVeigh, won her doubles
match 8-5 on court three. For the
second day in a row, Barte and Bur
dette played well at the top spot to
win 8-5 and clinch the doubles
point.

Li won Stanford's next point
when she walked off the court at
the fifth spot with a 6-1,6-1 victory
over Megan Moore. Barte earned
her team-leading fourth point of
the weekend with a 6-2,6-1 victory
against Arianna Colffer to put the
Cardinal one point away from the
second weekend. The win came
when Gibbs, recording her second
singles victory on the weekend, de
feated Ale Granillo 6-2,6-3.
"The thing with Nicole is that
she's become kind of automatic this
year," Forood said. "She just went
out and did what she does, which is
dominate her opponents. She really
gets after it, gets on top of her oppo
