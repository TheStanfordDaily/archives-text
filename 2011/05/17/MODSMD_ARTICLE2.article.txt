# Study provides food for thought
## Psychological conditions maybe an effect of digestive disorders 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
A paper published in PLoS One
last week by researchers from the
School of Medicine reveals that
short-term digestive problems early
in life may increase one's risk for de
pression and other psychological
problems. Standing counter to pre
viously held medical assumptions,
the new findings suggest that human
psychological conditions may be the
consequence not the cause of
gastrointestinal disorders.
Medicine professor Pankaj Pas
richa, chief of gastroenterology and
hepatology, spearheaded the study.
In collaboration with research asso
ciate Liansheng Liu and other col
leagues at Stanford, UC-San Fran
cisco and the University of Kansas,
Pasricha began tracing the psycho

logical symptoms of gastrointestinal
disorders such as irritable bowel
syndrome and functional dyspepsia.

"A characteristic feature of dis
orders such as irritable bowel syn
drome or functional dyspepsia is
their association with psychological
problems such as anxiety or depres
sion," Pasricha wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The current thinking
generally is that the latter cause or
exacerbate gastrointestinal symp
toms.

"We sought an alternative expla
nation, namely that gastrointestinal
problems cause depression and anx
iety. Thus, both long-lasting pain and
psychological problems can result
from a single cause, gastric irritation,
if it occurs in vulnerable individu
als."

According to Pasricha, the gut
has its own nervous system one

that is connected to the brain by
nerves such as the vagus nerve but
operates "relatively independently."
It is this complex communication
system that is responsible for
changes in the gut getting sent di
rectly to the brain.
Using developmental models of
gastrointestinal illness, products of
more than a decade's worth of con
struction, Pasricha and his col
leagues unearthed the time connec
tion between age and intestinal vul
nerability. The long-term impact of
the digestive irritation is largely de
pendent on not only the genetic
makeup of the patient but also its
early onset during development,
when the internal organs are espe
cially sensitive.
"As an example, we have pro
duced a model of irritable bowel
syndrome in adult rats that results

from neonatal irritation of the
colon as well," Pasricha said.
"So there is something vulner
able in the nervous system
during this period of life that
renders the animal suscepti
ble to other insults and causes
long-lasting changes."

In this particular study, re- | |
searchers followed a procedure in
which they subjected 10-day-old
Sprague-Dawley rats to mild gastric
irritation via oral doses of 0.1-per
cent idoacetamide, an alkylating
agent. Such treatment resulted in
temporary inflammation as well as a
brief period of hypersensitivity after
the inflammation healed.
Some eight to 10 weeks later, the
rats were tested with sucrose prefer
ence. Forced swimming tests were
used to examine depression-like be
havior. Elevated plus maze (EPM),

The results were striking. The
rats that experienced early gastric
problems were much more likely
than the control rats to exhibit de
pressed and anxious behaviors.
