# Study provides food for thought
## Psychological conditions maybe an effect of digestive disorders 
### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
A paper published in PLoS One
last week by researchers from the
School of Medicine reveals that
short-term digestive problems early
in life may increase one's risk for de
pression and other psychological
problems. Standing counter to pre
viously held medical assumptions,
the new findings suggest that human
psychological conditions may be the
consequence not the cause of
gastrointestinal disorders.
Medicine professor Pankaj Pas
richa, chief of gastroenterology and
hepatology, spearheaded the study.
In collaboration with research asso
ciate Liansheng Liu and other col
leagues at Stanford, UC-San Fran
cisco and the University of Kansas,
Pasricha began tracing the psycho

logical symptoms of gastrointestinal
disorders such as irritable bowel
syndrome and functional dyspepsia.

"A characteristic feature of dis
orders such as irritable bowel syn
drome or functional dyspepsia is
their association with psychological
problems such as anxiety or depres
sion," Pasricha wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The current thinking
generally is that the latter cause or
exacerbate gastrointestinal symp
toms.

"We sought an alternative expla
nation, namely that gastrointestinal
problems cause depression and anx
iety. Thus, both long-lasting pain and
psychological problems can result
from a single cause, gastric irritation,
if it occurs in vulnerable individu
als."

According to Pasricha, the gut
has its own nervous system one

that is connected to the brain by
nerves such as the vagus nerve but
operates "relatively independently."
It is this complex communication
system that is responsible for
changes in the gut getting sent di
rectly to the brain.
Using developmental models of
gastrointestinal illness, products of
more than a decade's worth of con
struction, Pasricha and his col
leagues unearthed the time connec
tion between age and intestinal vul
nerability. The long-term impact of
the digestive irritation is largely de
pendent on not only the genetic
makeup of the patient but also its
early onset during development,
when the internal organs are espe
cially sensitive.
"As an example, we have pro
duced a model of irritable bowel
syndrome in adult rats that results

from neonatal irritation of the
colon as well," Pasricha said.
"So there is something vulner
able in the nervous system
during this period of life that
renders the animal suscepti
ble to other insults and causes
long-lasting changes."

In this particular study, re- | |
searchers followed a procedure in
which they subjected 10-day-old
Sprague-Dawley rats to mild gastric
irritation via oral doses of 0.1-per
cent idoacetamide, an alkylating
agent. Such treatment resulted in
temporary inflammation as well as a
brief period of hypersensitivity after
the inflammation healed.
Some eight to 10 weeks later, the
rats were tested with sucrose prefer
ence. Forced swimming tests were
used to examine depression-like be
havior. Elevated plus maze (EPM),

The results were striking. The
rats that experienced early gastric
problems were much more likely
than the control rats to exhibit de
pressed and anxious behaviors.

open field and light-dark box tests
were used to assess anxiety
behaviors.
These behaviors manifested them
selves in decreased consumption of
sugar water, less active swimming in
warm water and a tendency to stay
in the dark areas during the maze
test.
The treated rats also exhibited
higher than normal levels of the
stress hormones corticosterone and
corticotrophin as well as an in
creased resting level of corti
cotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), a
hormone linked with depression in
humans and other animals.
According to Pasricha, the treat
ment interferes with the develop
ment of the central nervous system.
The signaling from the gut to the
brain permanently changes its func
tion to induce anxiety and depres
sion in the animals.
Moreover, blocking the rats'
sense of perception with the addi
tion of a drug did not cause any sig
nificant change in their behavior.
This indicates that the treated rats
were not responding to any current
pain. However, inhibiting the re
lease of CRF dramatically reduced
depression- and anxiety-like behav
ior, even in the rats that had initially
experienced gastric irritation.
Having found the causal link in
the vagus nerve between the gut
and the nervous system, Pasricha is
now investigating the specific mech
anisms that govern this phenome
non.

"We are now exploring the mol
ecules that are involved in signaling
between the gut and the brain and
the role of nerves such as the vagus
that may be mediating these
changes," Pasricha said. "There are
lots of questions to be asked, and we
hope that this research will open up
some new perspectives on depres
sion and anxiety and the relation
ship to gastrointestinal disorders.
There has been a lot of speculation
linking autism to gastrointestinal
disease."
Research regarding the link be
tween the nervous and gastroin
testinal systems has opened up new
realms of possibilities for novel
treatments and approaches. Electri
cal modulation of the vagus nerve, a
method patented by Cyberonics,
has been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration to treat stimu
lation for several years.
Pasricha alluded to other scien
tists who have proposed theories on
this linkage.
"Others have espoused theories
around this connection. Pierre Pal
lardy, the French alternative thera
pist, is certain that the roots of de
pression lie in the stomach," Pas
richa said. "In his 2007 book 'Gut In
stinct: What Your Stomach Is Trying
to Tell You,' he outlines his belief in
the power of the stomach to cause
or cure a wide range of physical and
mental ailments. Whether our re
search validates this or not is open
to question, but [it] certainly gives
food for thought."

open field and light-dark box tests
were used to assess anxiety
behaviors.
These behaviors manifested them
selves in decreased consumption of
sugar water, less active swimming in
warm water and a tendency to stay
in the dark areas during the maze
test.
The treated rats also exhibited
higher than normal levels of the
stress hormones corticosterone and
corticotrophin as well as an in
creased resting level of corti
cotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), a
hormone linked with depression in
humans and other animals.
According to Pasricha, the treat
ment interferes with the develop
ment of the central nervous system.
The signaling from the gut to the
brain permanently changes its func
tion to induce anxiety and depres
sion in the animals.
Moreover, blocking the rats'
sense of perception with the addi
tion of a drug did not cause any sig
nificant change in their behavior.
This indicates that the treated rats
were not responding to any current
pain. However, inhibiting the re
lease of CRF dramatically reduced
depression- and anxiety-like behav
ior, even in the rats that had initially
experienced gastric irritation.
Having found the causal link in
the vagus nerve between the gut
and the nervous system, Pasricha is
now investigating the specific mech
anisms that govern this phenome
non.

"We are now exploring the mol
ecules that are involved in signaling
between the gut and the brain and
the role of nerves such as the vagus
that may be mediating these
changes," Pasricha said. "There are
lots of questions to be asked, and we
hope that this research will open up
some new perspectives on depres
sion and anxiety and the relation
ship to gastrointestinal disorders.
There has been a lot of speculation
linking autism to gastrointestinal
disease."
Research regarding the link be
tween the nervous and gastroin
testinal systems has opened up new
realms of possibilities for novel
treatments and approaches. Electri
cal modulation of the vagus nerve, a
method patented by Cyberonics,
has been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration to treat stimu
lation for several years.
Pasricha alluded to other scien
tists who have proposed theories on
this linkage.
"Others have espoused theories
around this connection. Pierre Pal

richa said. "In his 2007 book 'Gut In

the power of the stomach to cause

A paper published in PLoS One
last week by researchers from the
School of Medicine reveals that
short-term digestive problems early
in life may increase one's risk for de
pression and other psychological
problems. Standing counter to pre
viously held medical assumptions,
the new findings suggest that human
psychological conditions may be the
consequence not the cause of
gastrointestinal disorders.
Medicine professor Pankaj Pas
richa, chief of gastroenterology and
hepatology, spearheaded the study.
In collaboration with research asso
ciate Liansheng Liu and other col
leagues at Stanford, UC-San Fran
cisco and the University of Kansas,
Pasricha began tracing the psycho

logical symptoms of gastrointestinal
disorders such as irritable bowel
syndrome and functional dyspepsia.

"A characteristic feature of dis
orders such as irritable bowel syn
drome or functional dyspepsia is
their association with psychological
problems such as anxiety or depres
sion," Pasricha wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The current thinking
generally is that the latter cause or
exacerbate gastrointestinal symp
toms.

"We sought an alternative expla
nation, namely that gastrointestinal
problems cause depression and anx
iety. Thus, both long-lasting pain and
psychological problems can result
from a single cause, gastric irritation,
if it occurs in vulnerable individu
als."

According to Pasricha, the gut
has its own nervous system one

that is connected to the brain by
nerves such as the vagus nerve but
operates "relatively independently."
It is this complex communication
system that is responsible for
changes in the gut getting sent di
rectly to the brain.
Using developmental models of
gastrointestinal illness, products of
more than a decade's worth of con
struction, Pasricha and his col
leagues unearthed the time connec
tion between age and intestinal vul
nerability. The long-term impact of
the digestive irritation is largely de
pendent on not only the genetic
makeup of the patient but also its
early onset during development,
when the internal organs are espe
cially sensitive.
"As an example, we have pro
duced a model of irritable bowel
syndrome in adult rats that results

from neonatal irritation of the
colon as well," Pasricha said.
"So there is something vulner
able in the nervous system
during this period of life that
renders the animal suscepti
ble to other insults and causes
long-lasting changes."
