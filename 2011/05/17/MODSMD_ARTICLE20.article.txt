# FAN FORUM
## ENJOY CARD SPORTS WHILE YOU CAN 
### SAM SVOBODA '11 
So here I am again, writing a sports column for The
Daily, roughly three and a half years after my last
sports column ran. When I was first asked to write
this Fan Forum, I'll admit I was hesitant. But I fig
ured I couldn't let my final quarter at Stanford be
the only quarter that I didn't contribute anything to The
Daily's sports section, right?
The sports editor (incidentally, my first "protege" at
The Daily, from our days covering the 2008 women's soc
cer team) suggested writing about my experience with the
hurling team here, which I helped found during my fresh
man year four years ago. While this would certainly be a
new topic to most readers, I recently wrote a piece on the
hurling team for Stanford's new "Champions" website. I'm
sure a lot of Daily readers have not read that piece, but I
thought I could do something more worthwhile than sim
ply rewriting something I already wrote. And I didn't want
this final column to be all about me. (Funny, given that
we're already two paragraphs in and it is entirely about me
so far. Just bear with me.)
My next thought was to write about the time I dominat
ed Beatles Rock Band with Toby Gerhart, since I seem to
tell everyone that story anyway and who doesn't love
reading about Toby? But as life altering as that story would
have been to readers, I decided against it. I also decided
against writing about how my Chicago Bulls' NBA Playoff
series against Miami is good vs. evil, because 1) it would be
rather tough to relate to Stanford
and 2) it's obvious. I even considered
writing a football column simply to
try to get Ted Miller to link to my ar
ticle on the ESPN Pac-12 Blog, but
those wouldn't exactly be the no
blest of journalistic intentions.
Finally, a topic came to me on
Sunday night, through a combina
tion of factors. I read back through
last week's Fan Forum, in which
Miles Bennett-Smith encouraged
people to take notice of the under
appreciated men's volleyball team.
And earlier in the day, the Stanford
women's water polo team won the
national championship, reminding
me of my freshman year at The
Daily (that was the first team I was a
beat writer for).
Given that I was writing a col
umn, I also thought back to my
freshman year column-writing, and I
realized that my first ever column
here was similar to Miles', just on a
broader scale it was encouraging
people to take advantage of their
opportunity to watch so many
world-class teams on the Farm. As
my younger self put it, "You won't
have the chance to see so many great
teams for so little cost ever again."
I look back on this article with
mixed emotions. On one hand, I'm
grateful that I got to see so many
great teams, athletes and games

through my time here. But I also
know I could have heeded my own
advice much more thoroughly.
There are still teams here that I
haven't seen compete even once,
and while I've definitely been busy
through my four years here, I cer
tainly could have spent a little more
time supporting our teams.
So, after much rambling, I want to
use my farewell (slash comeback?)
column to give the same advice in
my senior spring as I did in my fresh
man fall: take the opportunity to
check out all the incredible teams
and student athletes we have here.
Go support your athlete friends, but
also go watch Cardinal teams you
might not know anyone on. Follow
the "big" sports like football, but
also give the lesser-known sports a
chance. Fleck, go watch the club
sports teams as well honestly, we
can use all the fans we can get.
This all might seem obvious, but I
guess I'm living proof that it's not all
that easy to follow up on. In the end, I
guess my advice on Stanford sports is
the same advice I would give as a sen
ior about Stanford as a whole: take all
the opportunities you can to enjoy
and appreciate it, because it goes in
credibly quickly. Now if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to go back to pretend
ing I'm not graduating in 26 days.

Sam Svoboda is not only a lesser
Rock Band player than his editor, but
his hypothetical friendship with Toby
Gerhart isn't nearly as well devel
oped. Boast about your real athlete
