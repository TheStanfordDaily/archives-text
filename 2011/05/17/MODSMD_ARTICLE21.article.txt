# Men's lax is viable addition
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
It was posed nearly as a light
hearted, throw-in question. Dur
ing a conference call earlier this
month to discuss the Pac-12's
new media deal, a reporter asked
Director of Athletics Bob Bowlsby
whether the (vast) influx of new money
would lead Stanford to consider
adding a 36th varsity sports team. His
response suggested greater openness
to the idea than one might expect
despite struggles with finances over the
past few years, he wasn't entirely
against the idea. If anything, it sounded
like something he'd at least like to ex
plore.

"We'd have to think about it to
think about what we might add. No
plans for expansion, but it's not out of
the question. We're more than meeting
our gender equity requirements. We'd
be open-minded about it," he said.
The third sentence about "gender
equity" is code for "Stanford is meeting
its Title IX obligations." So if Bowlsby
and co. get serious about adding anoth
er team, allow me to propose a candi
date: men's lacrosse.
It is not the most obvious choice.
The sport is largely concentrated on
the East Coast, and there is no Division
I lacrosse team west of Colorado. Ele
vating the sport to varsity status would
be a risk, but it's one that should be con
sidered.

While Stanford has a club team
and a very good one, at that lacrosse
is one of the few sports the Athletic De
partment sponsors that has a women's
squad but lacks a male counterpart.
This works in the men's favor; for ex
ample, the playing field is already taken
care of â€”despite slightly different
field dimensions for the men's and
women's game, Cagan Stadium is an
entirely appropriate venue for the
men's team to use. Beyond that,
though, the success of the women's
team which just wrapped up its best
year to date gives a rubric for the
men to follow. For example, with few
exceptions, the squad is made up al
most entirely of players from Mary
land, New Jersey, Virginia and other
eastern states. The recruiting focus is
appropriately national, and one future
consequence of the new media deal
that Bowlsby was most excited by was
the chance to continue to spread the
Stanford brand across the country.
With lacrosse, it'd be a symbiotic rela
tionship.
And indeed, the talent pools are in
creasing at dramatic rates. The number
of high schoolers playing the sport has
doubled in the past 10 years, according
to the National Federation of State
High School Associations. While this is
still an East Coast phenomenon, it is no
longer exclusive to that region par
ticipation has risen dramatically on the
West Coast, too. Appropriately, more
universities are adding lacrosse pro
grams.

But not on the Pacific Coast. At
least not yet. While the women can
compete in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation with other Pac-10
schools like Cal and Oregon, the men
would not have a western conference
they could join. The Air Force Acade
my and the University of Denver
the westernmost Division I programs
compete in the Eastern College
Athletic Conference with schools as
far east as Loyola in Maryland. It's a
costly expenditure.
That said, the status quo may not
last long. Stanford would not be the
only western school exploring the op
tion of adding men's lacrosse, as USC
told Lax Magazine.com that it is con
sidering adding the sport, too. A few
more universities would be needed for
a West Coast-based conference, but the
roots and developing interests are
there. As lacrosse continues to estab
lish a foothold in youth leagues across
the West, it is only a matter of time be
fore varsity teams at the collegiate level
begin to pop up, too.
Therein lies perhaps the most com
pelling argument for Stanford, which
sees itself as a trendsetter in a number
of fields. Lacrosse's growth is difficult
to ignore, so why not jump ahead of the
pack? The University's clout as both
the top athletic and academic school in
Division I is tremendous, and by creat
ing a hub for lacrosse on the West
Coast, Bowlsby and other administra
tors would be making a statement that
says, "We think this sport is for real,
come join us as we further cement its
place in collegiate athletics." Recruits
