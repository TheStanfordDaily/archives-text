## Gastric bypass promotes heart health in teens 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Ivy Nguyen 
Gastric bypass surgery for obese teens
may be even more effective at reducing the
risk of cardiovascular disease than it is for
adults who undergo the same procedure,
according to a recent study from the School
of Medicine led by bariatric surgeon John
Morton.
The study involved 99 adult patients and
33 adolescents who underwent gastric by
pass at Stanford between 2004 and 2010.
The adults in this group were, on average,
44.4 years old and had a body mass index
(BMI) of 52.3, while the adolescents were,
on average, 17 years old and had a BMI of
52.7. BMIs more than 25 are considered
obese; these patients were described as "se
verely overweight."
Although both groups lost approximately
the same amount of weight after their sur
gery, the teenage patients had a greater im
provement in several biochemical markers
thought to be predictive of heart problems.
Some of the markers the researchers tracked
include cholesterol levels, diabetes status and
blood pressure. The teenage group showed
higher levels of "good" cholesterol and
sharper drops in fasting glucose slower
drops are an indicator of diabetes.
By some counts, one in three adults and
one in five adolescents are considered obese.
Such excess weight can lead to conditions in
cluding high blood pressure, diabetes, heart
disease and shortened life span. Surgery is
often the last resort for these obese patients.
