# Refund patterns by quarter

ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
Recent data on special fees refunds yield interesting trends. The number of students asking
for a refund in spring quarter is generally higher than in fall quarter, as more students become
aware of the ability to get money back and the mechanism to do so. The total dollar
amount refunded hit its lowest level in the last three years this spring, with requests for
a full $lll refund and the average dollar amount for refunds both decreasing sharply.
