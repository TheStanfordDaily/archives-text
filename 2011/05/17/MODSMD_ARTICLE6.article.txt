## Scholar weighs pros and cons of Googlization Vaidhyanathan says users make Google "smarter with every click " 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies
at the University of Virginia, spoke about the ben
efits and dangers of Google on Monday a topic
especially close to home, given that the Internet
giant's founders are Stanford computer science
alums.
"My book is about us our willingness, our ease,
our enthusiasm for folding Google into our lives,"
said Vaidhyanathan, who authored "The
Googlization of Everything."
Many people find it hard to get directions to a
restaurant without relying on Google, he said. In
deed, between 60 and 70 percent of the Web
searches in the United States go through the com
pany's search engine and people constantly adopt
the software it produces from "Google Labs."
"How did this happen?" he asked. "Google's 12
years old now its voice is just starting to
change."
"What I thought we lacked when I started re
searching this book was an account of the nature
of the transaction," he said. "What do we give
Google? What does Google give us?"
One of Google's largest public services, he ar
gued, is scanning books in a partnership with the
University of Michigan's library and has since ex
panded to more than 60 institutions.
"When that plan was announced, it struck me
as pretty audacious ... I thought, "This may not be
the way we want to proceed here.' Google was un
likely to pay attention to privacy or quality of scans
like librarians would," he said.
He pondered why universities want to contract
with the company "to act as a custodian for hun
dreds of years of knowledge" and spoke about the
fascinating role that Google's "don't be evil"
motto plays in business and technology.
"It's part of the lore," he said. "It's part of the
story you get."
"I maintain to this day it is that sin that matters
when we deal with Google," he added.
"There's this weird assumption that good actually
rose out of brilliance. This story to me was fairly in-
complete," he said. "What was miss
ing from this story was the fact that,
for instance, Sergey Brin and Larry
Page worked on a grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation to devel
op what became Page√üank."
Thus, the public helped fund the
project that eventually became
Google, and it now contributes the
data critical to the company's suc
cess.
"We do a tremendous amount of
interaction with Google that con
stantly improves Google," Vaid
hyanathan said.
No other search engine company
can truly compete, because there are
none that are as well equipped. And
no other company boasts "the
sunken infrastructure" that Google
has, he observed.
"The question is, 'How are we
making Google smarter?"' he
added. "And we're making Google
smarter with every click."
But computer clicks don't make
up the entire picture.
"There is no such thing as a neu
tral algorithm," Vaidhyanathan said.
"Human beings do make deci
sions at Google," he said. "Human
beings make decisions what the algo
rithm cares about. It's not just the
computers."
Indeed, Google shows different
search results depending on location
and "learns" the preferences of users
who have Google accounts.
"What this does is, of course, nar
row our field of vision, because we're
outsourcing our decision making to
Google exponentially, which is much
better for shopping but much worse
for learning," he said.

A problem universities, libraries
and public schools face, he argued, is
a "public failure." Without the gov
ernment providing all the necessary
resources for these institutions,
Google can force change when it
takes over the work that the public
sector isn't necessarily doing.
"Really what we see here is
Google on the Web as a largely
benevolent Caesar," he said.
"Google is essentially the sover
eign of the Web," he added. "Google
is ruling the Web for us."
"We're not far enough into histo
ry," said community member Hazem
Nassar, who referred to Vaid
hyanathan's comparison of Google
to Caesar.
"This is all very recent, and the
rate of change is very fast," Nassar
said. "Google came out, and now
they're afraid of Facebook. I'd like to
hear more of what he has to say
about open source, especially mak
ing libraries more accessible."
