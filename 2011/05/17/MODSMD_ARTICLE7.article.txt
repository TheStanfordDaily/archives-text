## Stanford develops tiny, energy-efficient lasers 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF —An Le Nguyen 
Sometimes less is more. Stanford researchers,
led by associate professor of electrical engineer
ing Jelena Vuckovic, have demonstrated this fact
in developing tiny semiconductor lasers that use
less energy than ever before.
The electrical data interconnections that are
found in today's computers take up lots of ener
gy. Now, Vuckovic and her team have pioneered
a new generation of lasers that are much more ef

ficient than their predecessors. More specifically,
Vuckovic is developing a photonic-crystal laser,
which functions at low thresholds and does not
consume much energy.
This development proves, for the first time,
the feasibility of an electrically pumped laser that
is both easy to create and energy efficient.
However, the newly introduced laser needs to
address a number of concerns before it can go
into widespread use. Chief among these concerns
is the fact that the laser only works at relatively

cold temperatures —l5O Kelvin and below.
Vuckovic and her team are nonetheless opti
mistic about future progress. Their goal is to come
up with a laser that can work at room tempera
ture without sacrificing energy efficiency.
The Stanford Graduate Fellowships, the In
terconnect Focus Center and the Air Force Of
fice of Scientific Research are funding these re
search efforts.
