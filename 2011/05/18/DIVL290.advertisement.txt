Free and Open to the public
Fifty years ogo, the FDA
announced approval for the
birth control pill. The pill quickly
become the most popular form
of contraception in the country
and one of the best-selling drugs
in U.S. history. It was hailed as
o magic bullet that would holt
the global population explosion,
eradicate war and poverty
worldwide, and ensure hoppy
and stable marriages; it would
be given credit (or blame) for
the sexual revolution ond would
become the focus of widespread
challenges to the authority
of religious leaders, doctors,
pharmaceutical companies,
ond lawmakers. Don't miss this
chance to hear a distinguished
historian explore how science,
culture ond politics interacted
to shape this significant
chopter in American history.
