## Besos de Buenos Aires (BsAs) 
### Johnny Bartz 
I arrived in Buenos Aires last
Thursday deranged from a cou
ple flights of little-to-no sleep
and groggy from the in-flight fiesta
prompted by a rather instigating
stewardess, causing me to fall for
the biggest trick in the book:
charge the gringo double for the
taxi ride.
It was the quintessential multi
man, foreigner stakeout, pay up
front kind of operation. I of course
didn't fall for the: "Oh you only
gave me $l5O instead of $250" trick,
at which point I probably should
have become belligerent, demand
ed the money back, taken out the
bags and scolded the man for being
dishonest when he had a rosary
hanging from his rearview mirror,
but my Spanish was rusty and my
tongue not quite sharp as usual. Bi
envertidos a Argentina, I guess.
(For reference, a current taxi
fare from the Ezeiza airport into
the city of Buenos Aires should run
around 150 pesos, including the
tip).
While I was quick to point out to
my new Argentinian friends that
this kind of discriminatory taxi
scam had never happened to me
upon arrival in Brazil, they were
quick to quip something about los
ing a day earlier in the last World
Cup. We'll see who wins 2014.
Crime in Buenos Aires is equal
to that of any Latin American city,
so take care not to overtly display
your valuables. A prime example

was when a thief grabbed the Black
berry of the woman sitting next to
me on the bus as he ran out the
door. Lucky for her, my uncon
scious instincts grabbed the phone
out of the thief's very hands, return
ing it to a very stunned lady from a
very stunned, newly formed Argen
tinian hero.
So I'd say thieves .5, Johnny 1.
There is much to see in the city of
Buenos Aires, and it's a cheap
skate's dream with 30c bus rides,
cheap markets and food, and even a
taxi practically anywhere in the city
is less than $l5 USD.
There is plenty of sightseeing in
BsAs, but for that I would suggest a
good guidebook! Pay your respects
to the women in Plaza de Mayo on
Thursday who mourn the loss of
their children during the dictator
ship, take a photo in front of La
Casa Rosada and walk along the
brightly colored buildings, tango
dancers and well-fed stray dogs of
the Boca area. The Sunday market
in San Telmo is great for take-home
trinkets.

At Puerto Madero the walk
along the canal is nice. Check out
Puente de la Mujer, designed by the
famous Spanish architect Santiago
Calatrava, which is supposed to re
semble a woman performing the
tango, though this may be quite an
abstract interpretation. I will let
you decide if the beam stretching
into the sky is supposed to be the
arm or leg, however might I suggest
posing in different tango-inspired
positions with the bridge in the
background.

The Porteno fare is delicious to
any 20-something meatlover, how
ever vegetarians beware. You can
hit up street cafes all over the city,
and I suggest you try all varieties of
empanadas and milanesas to deter
mine which you like best. Just be
prepared to eat a lot of fries, and
forget about counting calories
you're on vacation. I've decided
that I'm an empanada de polio and
milanesa completa (fried/breaded
veal with two over-easy eggs on
top) kind of guy. Cafe de Los An
gelitos (Rivadavia 2100) is fre
quented by the rich and famous,
and it won't break the bank. Even if
you feel like the milanesa is reject
ing your body, a few minutes of rest
and perhaps a cafe con leche usual
ly solves the problem.
For dinner, I highly suggest
Desnivel (Defensa 855). The interi
or is unassuming, however the food

is exceptional at a reasonable price.
My beef tenderloin with mustard
sauce could have been cut with a
spoon, though I didn't really need to
as I inhaled it on account of its deli
ciousness. Washing down the gener
ous piece of meat with several glass
es of Malbec, I was satiated, but not
overly so that I couldn't nibble on
some flan for dessert.The full dinner
for 5 came in at only $BB USD.
Buenos Aires has a very late
schedule to say the least, and its
best that you just embrace it to get
the full experience of the city. After
a leisurely dinner between 9 and 10
p.m., you may want to go get some
dessert or coffee. The bar scene
starts up around this time as well,
and while there are hundreds to
choose from, you may want to start
with The Alamo (Uruguay 1175) or
Milion (Parana 1048). The Alamo is
frequented by expats while Milion
is a trendy cool bar that is inside of
an old mansion. You may want to
make Milion a later destination, as
the drinks are relatively expensive.
It's unthinkable to arrive at a
boliche (club) before midnight, and
they really don't get started until 1
or 2 a.m. The Palermo Hollywood
neighborhood is full of cool places
to dance the night away. Check out
Kika (Honduras 5339) or Esperan
to (Juan B. Justo 1625), and be
ready to get down to some
reggeaton or some awesome Lady
Gaga cumbia remixes.

empanada/milanesa combination.

empanadas and milanesas to deter
mine which you like best. Just be
prepared to eat a lot of fries, and
forget about counting calories
you're on vacation. I've decided
that I'm an empanada de polio and
milanesa completa (fried/breaded
veal with two over-easy eggs on
top) kind of guy. Cafe de Los An
gelitos (Rivadavia 2100) is fre
quented by the rich and famous,
and it won't break the bank. Even if
you feel like the milanesa is reject
ing your body, a few minutes of rest
and perhaps a cafe con leche usual
ly solves the problem.
For dinner, I highly suggest
Desnivel (Defensa 855). The interi

is exceptional at a reasonable price.
My beef tenderloin with mustard
sauce could have been cut with a
spoon, though I didn't really need to
as I inhaled it on account of its deli

overly so that I couldn't nibble on
some flan for dessert.The full dinner

Buenos Aires has a very late
schedule to say the least, and its
best that you just embrace it to get
the full experience of the city. After
a leisurely dinner between 9 and 10
p.m., you may want to go get some
dessert or coffee. The bar scene
starts up around this time as well,
and while there are hundreds to
choose from, you may want to start
with The Alamo (Uruguay 1175) or
Milion (Parana 1048). The Alamo is
frequented by expats while Milion
is a trendy cool bar that is inside of
an old mansion. You may want to
make Milion a later destination, as
the drinks are relatively expensive.
It's unthinkable to arrive at a
boliche (club) before midnight, and
they really don't get started until 1
or 2 a.m. The Palermo Hollywood
neighborhood is full of cool places
to dance the night away. Check out
Kika (Honduras 5339) or Esperan
to (Juan B. Justo 1625), and be
ready to get down to some
reggeaton or some awesome Lady
Gaga cumbia remixes.

empanada/milanesa combination.

I arrived in Buenos Aires last
Thursday deranged from a cou
ple flights of little-to-no sleep
and groggy from the in-flight fiesta
prompted by a rather instigating
stewardess, causing me to fall for
the biggest trick in the book:
charge the gringo double for the
taxi ride.
It was the quintessential multi
man, foreigner stakeout, pay up
front kind of operation. I of course
didn't fall for the: "Oh you only
gave me $l5O instead of $250" trick,
at which point I probably should
have become belligerent, demand
ed the money back, taken out the
bags and scolded the man for being
dishonest when he had a rosary
hanging from his rearview mirror,
but my Spanish was rusty and my
tongue not quite sharp as usual. Bi
envertidos a Argentina, I guess.
(For reference, a current taxi
fare from the Ezeiza airport into
the city of Buenos Aires should run
around 150 pesos, including the
tip).
While I was quick to point out to
my new Argentinian friends that
this kind of discriminatory taxi
scam had never happened to me
upon arrival in Brazil, they were
quick to quip something about los
ing a day earlier in the last World
Cup. We'll see who wins 2014.
Crime in Buenos Aires is equal
to that of any Latin American city,
so take care not to overtly display
your valuables. A prime example

was when a thief grabbed the Black
berry of the woman sitting next to
me on the bus as he ran out the
door. Lucky for her, my uncon
scious instincts grabbed the phone
out of the thief's very hands, return
ing it to a very stunned lady from a
very stunned, newly formed Argen
tinian hero.
So I'd say thieves .5, Johnny 1.
There is much to see in the city of
Buenos Aires, and it's a cheap
skate's dream with 30c bus rides,
cheap markets and food, and even a
taxi practically anywhere in the city
is less than $l5 USD.
There is plenty of sightseeing in
BsAs, but for that I would suggest a
good guidebook! Pay your respects
to the women in Plaza de Mayo on
Thursday who mourn the loss of
their children during the dictator
ship, take a photo in front of La
Casa Rosada and walk along the
brightly colored buildings, tango
dancers and well-fed stray dogs of
the Boca area. The Sunday market
in San Telmo is great for take-home
trinkets.

At Puerto Madero the walk
along the canal is nice. Check out
Puente de la Mujer, designed by the
famous Spanish architect Santiago
Calatrava, which is supposed to re
semble a woman performing the
tango, though this may be quite an
abstract interpretation. I will let
you decide if the beam stretching
into the sky is supposed to be the
arm or leg, however might I suggest
posing in different tango-inspired
positions with the bridge in the
background.

The Porteno fare is delicious to
any 20-something meatlover, how
ever vegetarians beware. You can
hit up street cafes all over the city,
and I suggest you try all varieties of
empanadas and milanesas to deter
mine which you like best. Just be
prepared to eat a lot of fries, and
