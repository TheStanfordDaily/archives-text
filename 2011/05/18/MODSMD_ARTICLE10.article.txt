## Besos de Buenos Aires (BsAs) 
### Johnny Bartz 
I arrived in Buenos Aires last
Thursday deranged from a cou
ple flights of little-to-no sleep
and groggy from the in-flight fiesta
prompted by a rather instigating
stewardess, causing me to fall for
the biggest trick in the book:
charge the gringo double for the
taxi ride.
It was the quintessential multi
man, foreigner stakeout, pay up
front kind of operation. I of course
didn't fall for the: "Oh you only
gave me $l5O instead of $250" trick,
at which point I probably should
have become belligerent, demand
ed the money back, taken out the
bags and scolded the man for being
dishonest when he had a rosary
hanging from his rearview mirror,
but my Spanish was rusty and my
tongue not quite sharp as usual. Bi
envertidos a Argentina, I guess.
(For reference, a current taxi
fare from the Ezeiza airport into
the city of Buenos Aires should run
around 150 pesos, including the
tip).
While I was quick to point out to
my new Argentinian friends that
this kind of discriminatory taxi
scam had never happened to me
upon arrival in Brazil, they were
quick to quip something about los
ing a day earlier in the last World
Cup. We'll see who wins 2014.
Crime in Buenos Aires is equal
to that of any Latin American city,
so take care not to overtly display
your valuables. A prime example

was when a thief grabbed the Black
berry of the woman sitting next to
me on the bus as he ran out the
door. Lucky for her, my uncon
scious instincts grabbed the phone
out of the thief's very hands, return
ing it to a very stunned lady from a
very stunned, newly formed Argen
tinian hero.
So I'd say thieves .5, Johnny 1.
There is much to see in the city of
Buenos Aires, and it's a cheap
skate's dream with 30c bus rides,
cheap markets and food, and even a
taxi practically anywhere in the city
is less than $l5 USD.
There is plenty of sightseeing in
BsAs, but for that I would suggest a
good guidebook! Pay your respects
to the women in Plaza de Mayo on
Thursday who mourn the loss of
their children during the dictator
ship, take a photo in front of La
Casa Rosada and walk along the
brightly colored buildings, tango
dancers and well-fed stray dogs of
the Boca area. The Sunday market
in San Telmo is great for take-home
trinkets.
