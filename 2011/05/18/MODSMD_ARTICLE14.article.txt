## CARDINAL CHATTER NCAA HOME COOKING 
### BRADLEY KLAHN '12, RYAN THACHER '12 ALEX CLAYTON '11 
Here we are, sitting in room 208 of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon waiting to go
to practice at 3 p.m. Unfortunately,
it rained today and we had to
change our practice time on four
different occasions. Denis' monthly allotment of
text messages ran out by noon today, so he was a
bit late to practice. The big match is on Thursday
night at 6 p.m., and we fully expect the campus
and especially the brothers of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon to be quite rowdy and inebriated
(you should check out the Facebook event too).
Hosting the NCAA Tournament this year is a
very exciting time for our team, and it's a great
opportunity for us. We are comfortable on our
home courts, and we feel it's a big advantage
being able to have the home-crowd support be
hind us as we progress deeper into the tourna

ment. At this time the previous two years, we
were thousands of miles away from Stanford
stuck in hotels with nothing to do but practice,
sleep and indulge the occasional team Sporcle
competition.

Now, we are able to go to class, stick to our
normal routine (for the most part) and not have
to worry about the new TSA pat-downs, flight
delays (canceled flight from Seattle to Eugene at
12 a.m., and driving five hours to play at 11 a.m.
the next day? It happened), cramped rental cars
and southern humidity. Unfortunately, this year
we were not able to see Gregory Hirshman wear
his tiger-skin onesie on the plane flights or see
Jamie Hutter take down an ounce of one of the
hottest sauces in the world, "100% PAIN." Our
trainer didn't even feel sorry enough to give him
some Turns.

With all that said, it's important that you get
to know the individuals on the team before com
ing out to watch Thursday night. Or at least, get
to know them as we do.

Ben-Jammin' Ball (Jamin Ball) freshman
from Palo Alto, Calif. Stepped up big this year;
assumed a starting role and a permanent desig
nated driver spot for the SAE house.
Alex clayTON senior from Plantation,
Fla. The most eligible bachelor on the team. Be
tween the job at Goldman Sachs and his passion
for creative writing, what's not to love?
Samuel "Mr. Nice Guy" Ecker sophomore
from Mequon, Wis. Man of many racquets. Also
happens to look similar to Justin Bieber.
Gregory "The Renaissance Man" Hirshman
senior from La Jolla, Calif. Tenacious fighter
who always finds away. Far too many skeletons in
his closet to ever become a politician; he dreams
about one day owning a "hybrid" vehicle.
Danny "Daniel-san" Ho freshman from
Rosemead, Calif. In his first dual match of the
year, came up clutch for the team in the second
round of NCAAs; not so clutch in English class,
however.
Fawaz "El" Hourani freshman from
Amman, Jordan. Gives the team its token inter
national player. Member of the Jordanian Davis
Cup team, which you've probably never heard of.
James "Jamerton" Hutter junior from
Menlo Park, Calif. Injuries kept him out of action
the past few years, but he still thinks he can
bench press more than you.
Matt "capTAIN" Kandath sophomore
from Gansevoort, N. Y. Hits both hands off both
sides. Absolutely loves receiving fan mail and
mail from his teammates. Write him he's a
chill dude.
Walker "Hard Hat" Kehrer sophomore
from Pacific Palisades, Calif. Strong contributor,
especially in doubles, until a few "missteps" took
him out of action.
Ted "Frank the Tank" Kelly senior from
Charlottesville, Va. A staple in the doubles
lineup for the majority of his career, we can al
ways count on him when we need to put a
match on ice.
Bradley "BK Broiler" Klahn —junior from
Poway, Calif. Last year's NCAA singles champi
on, knows some Spanish, volunteers at Green
peace.
Denis "Denise" Lin sophomore from
Thousand Oaks, Calif. An incredible talent for
shanking balls over the fence, known for aggres
sively pegging anyone and everyone he can, but
isn't always sure where it's going.
Ryan "Toucher" Thacher- Junior from Studio
City, Calif. Actually, he is the most eligible bach
elor on the team. An international TV star whose
favorite city is Vienna. If you don't believe me,
Google "Jake Pavelka."


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Juniors Bradley Klahn, front, and Ryan Thacher, back make up one of the nation's top doubles
tandems. Stanford's top pair won both of their matches on the first weekend of the NCAA tourney.
