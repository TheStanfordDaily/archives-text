# Old bowls better than BCS
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
Like most college football
fans, I don't particularly like
the Bowl Championship
Series. If nothing else, the
BCS routinely fails to live
up to its stated goal of crowning a true
national champion in college football.
Thus, I was extremely interested to
hear that the B CS is finally facing legal
action over possible violations of an
titrust law. Utah Attorney General
Mark Shurtleff filed a lawsuit against
the BCS, and the Department of Jus
tice, led by standout prosecutor Chris
tine Varney, opened its own inquiry
into whether the BCS is an illegal mo
nopoly.
The BCS' response to these legal
inquiries has been twofold. First, Ex
ecutive Director Bill Hancock made a
somewhat silly statement about how,
in essence, the government should
have better things to do than look into
college football which doesn't
make too much sense to me, seeing as
how the majority of bowl game partic
ipants are public schools that are
owned by you guessed it the
government.

However, the second threat lev
eled by BCS supporters is more inter
esting to me. They have claimed (cor
rectly, as it happens) that the destruc
tion of the BCS would not necessarily
lead to the creation of a playoff to de
termine the national champion. Un
like having a playoff, which most fans
agree is the best way forward, there is
no clear answer to whether or not the
BCS is superior to the system it re
placed.
For those of you who are unfamil
iar: prior to the creation of the BCS,
each bowl game acted as its own inde
pendent entity and selected its partic
ipants through agreements with con

ferences (rather than five games com
ing together with six conferences to
set the rules, as with the BCS). There
was no guarantee that the No. 1 and
No. 2 teams in the final rankings
would meet in a bowl game, which
often resulted in split national titles,
with multiple undefeated teams
claiming the top spot.
The original intent of the BCS was
to correct this flaw by ensuring that a
national title game between the
sport's top two teams was staged each
year. However, the BCS has failed
miserably in this aspect, as there are
almost always more than two teams
worthy of playing in the national
championship game. This year, TCU
went undefeated and beat Wisconsin
in the Rose Bowl, but didn't get a
crack at the title despite never losing.
So the question remains: would it
really be all that terrible to go back to
the bad old days of the free-for-all
bowl system? I've already established
that the BCS' claim that it crowns a
true national champion rings hollow;
the only reason to keep the BCS, then,
would be that it ensures more com
pelling matchups than the old bowl
system would.
In a little thought experiment, I've
guessed at what I think the four mar
quee bowls would have looked like
this past season if there were no BCS.
Rose: Oregon vs. Wisconsin
Fiesta: Oklahoma vs. Stanford*
Sugar: Auburn vs. Ohio State
Orange: Virginia Tech vs. Arkansas

*This is the only one I really ago
nized over; the spot could have easily
gone to Michigan State or a third SEC
school.
In my opinion, the differences be
tween this slate and the BCS are small
enough to be irrelevant; regardless of
which system you use, you will get a
very good set of games. Sure, the
smaller schools of the world like TCU
get left out, but with TCU and Utah
joining major conferences in the near
future, that will become less of a prob
lem â€” not to mention the fact that
preferring the BCS on the basis of the
fact that it better represents non-AQ
schools is far too rich with irony for
me to even contemplate.
Thus, the scare tactic of reverting
to the old bowl system wouldn't be
that bad even if it did happen. We
might lose the No. 1 vs. No. 2 title
game, but that game stopped deliver
ing a controversy-free national
champion a long time ago. The bowl
season would be just as compelling,
and each game would be free to up
hold its own tradition the Rose
Bowl could stage its Pac-12 vs. Big 10
matchup every year, without having
to host some team from Texas that is
going to jump to the Big East. Of
course, the BCS will continue to
come up with excuses to justify its ex
istence but now that I refuse to be
cowed by the threat of returning to
the old bowl system, I'm excited to
see what its PR spin doctors cook up
next.

It may be May, but for Kabir Sawh
ney, it's football season! Let him
know that your football season never
ends either at ksawhney@stanford.
