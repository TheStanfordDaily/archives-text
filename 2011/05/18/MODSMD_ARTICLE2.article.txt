## Administrators detail online privacy policy University officials have access to all transmitted information 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University officials have confirmed that all
electronic information transmitted on the
Stanford network is accessible to privacy offi
cers and other administrators.

In an email to The Daily, privacy officer
Susan Weinstein '72, MBA "79, wrote that the
University has access to "all electronic infor
mation stored on its systems." This includes
all emails sent to @stanford.edu addresses,
Zimbra accounts, chat lists and any website
requiring an SUID to log in, such as Course
work.

However, Weinstein maintains that the Uni
versity does not routinely police this informa
tion. It is only retrieved in one of two situations.
"Since the University respects the privacy
of its community, Stanford only accesses elec
tronic information when necessary to com
plete an investigation, or if access is required to
maintain its systems and keep them fully oper
ational," Weinstein said.

"In those rare instances when the Universi
ty has a need to access this information, the ac
cess is limited to the minimum necessary to ac
complish its purpose," Weinstein said.
The reasoning behind this access lies in the
University's responsibility for all uses of its
technological resources.

"When the @stanford.edu email address of
ficially became the primary email address for
students about four years ago the intention was
that it be used for Stanford business only,"
wrote Greg Boardman, vice provost for Stu
dent Affairs, in an email to The Daily. "When
we create email address distribution lists inter
nally they must meet that criteria ... All are
supposed to be for University business only
and all should allow students to opt out. They
are not to be shared or dispersed to other stu
dents or staff."
All of this is in accordance with the U.S.
Department of Education's Federal Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA),
which prohibits educational institutions
from sharing with outside sources much of
the personal information they retain about
students.

The notable exception to this policy is infor
mation transmitted over Stanford's network
from a desktop, laptop or mobile device
which can only be accessed while in transit.
"Once transmission is completed, the infor
mation may only be accessed if stored on Stan
ford's servers," Weinstein said.
There are, however, several ways students
can opt out of sharing personal information.
Axess allows individuals to dictate what per
sonal information will be shared on Stanford-
Who, the University's public directory. Further
more, some University-wide surveys are not
sent to students who have indicated
a preference against this practice.
"If a study/survey has been ap
proved because it supports the ac
ademic mission of the University,
one of two things happens con
cerning privacy: 1) if it is a survey
approved by the Provost's Office,
all students are included: 2) if it is
a study or survey that is approved
but not directly related to an inter
nal purpose, students who have re
quested privacy are excluded,"
wrote Boardman.
"An example of the first would
be the Senior Survey or the En
rolled Student Survey that we do
every 4 years," he added. "Exam
ples of the second kind are specific
studies run by a few faculty whose
study will support and inform aca
demic policy."
