involved family, is the first female president
of Costa Rica. She earned a master's in
public policy from Georgetown in 1989.
Her talk on Tuesday evening was part of
the GSB's "Global Speakers Series." Chin
chilla opened her speech by stating that her

country has developed in a relatively
peaceful and environmentally friendly way.
"We Costa Ricans have always believed
in achieving prosperity through peace,
freedom and the rule of law," Chinchilla
said. "That is a major national understand
ing and through history we have taken the
decision to follow our beliefs."
The country has not had a standing
army since 1949. According to the CIA
World Factbook, Costa Rica spends 0.6
percent of its GDP on defense.

search of companies wishing to in
vest in her country. Costa Rica's ex
ports include bananas, coffee and
beef, but it also has a growing high
tech sector. Chinchilla said she
plans for her country to be compet
itive in this industry.
She hopes that Costa Rica will
be Latin America's first developed
country and is a strong proponent
of free trade.

"We are very well-integrated
into the international economy,"
she said. "Our products compete
very well in the most important
markets in the world.That is why in
stead of being afraid of continuing
this path, we want to look for more
opportunities."
She stressed the importance of
education, particularly English-lan
guage education. To ensure that
Costa Rica becomes an internation
ally competitive player, Chinchilla
wants all high school graduates to
be fluent in English by 2017.

She also addressed China's grow
ing influence in Latin America.
"For Costa Rica, China means a
very important opportunity," she
said. "We are in certain ways com
plimentary economies. We do not
compete with them."
Anabel Gonzalez, the country's
minister of foreign trade, amended
this by adding "the United States is
the most important trade and in
vestment partner and has been so
for a long time."
"I believe it will remain so for a
long time," Gonzalez added.
Chinchilla also talked about her
keys to personal success, noting the
importance that having a strong
moral compass bears in life.
"If you don't believe in what you
are doing it's very hard to be suc
cessful," she said. "If you have
strong convictions and if you never
leave that set of basic values, I think
you are going to do very great."
Business school students who at
tended the lecture were generally
satisfied with what they heard.
"I think she has a very good
grasp of what countries in Latin
America need in order to be com
petitive and create jobs and solve

some of the problems," said Eduar
do Hurtado MBA 'l2.
Jon Elist MBA 'l2 noted that
emerging economies, such as China,
will play a role in Latin America.
"Going forward we're going to
be seeing more and more Chinese
influence in an area that tradition
ally has had strong relations with
the U. 5.," Elist said.
Naama Stauber MBA 'l2, was
curious to know about how Costa
Rica is working to solve problems
related to the achievement gap be
tween men and women.
"I would like to hear more about
what exactly do they do to address

this problem, specifically what do
they do to support females," she said.
Chinchilla's advice to maintain
one's values whenever pursuing a
goal impressed Stauber.
"I'm sure she wouldn't be able to
be at the place she's at if she wasn't
a strong woman with strong opin
ions," Stauber said.
"It's amazing that the GSB is
able to attract these high govern
ment figures from around the
world," Hurtado said. "I'm so happy
to be here."
