## Pera explains stem cell Ph.D. program vision Director discusses future of first program of its kind in the nation 
### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
A new doctoral program in stem cell biology
and regenerative medicine is set to launch in the
fall of 2012. Approved by the Faculty Senate on
April 28, the interdisciplinary program will
draw not only from the biomedical sciences but
also from the law, business and engineering
schools.
Renee Reijo Pera, professor of obstetrics
and gynecology, will direct the program. The
goal of the doctoral program is to create leaders
who will, in Reijo Pera's words, "change the
world" by translating basic stem cell biology
into cures and clinical therapies.
According to School of Medicine press re
lease, the first class will be made up of three to
six students. The program will eventually enroll
a total of 24 students.
"Even without [an official] website, we are
getting so many emails from students who want
more information about our program," Reijo
Pera said.
Students will be required to take three broad
biomedical sciences courses, called Stem Cell
Biology 1, 2 and 3. They will also have the op
tion of taking additional courses in law, engi
neering and business. Another unique compo
nent of the program is that students will under
go a clinical rotation where they will shadow
surgeons and physicians.
According to Reijo Pera, Stanford is truly
"special" in that it already has the faculty in
place to begin the program. When she and her
colleagues first considered founding a new doc
toral program in stem cell biology, they serious
ly debated another possibility: the expansion of
the current graduate program in the biomedical
sciences.
"We thought about all the options. We
looked at the possibility of expanding some of
the programs currently in place," Reijo Pera
said. "After really thinking about it, we came to
the conclusion that stem cell biology and regen
erative medicine are really unique."
"We couldn't find a natural home for the
program to fit into," she added. "And so, we es
tablished a new one."
