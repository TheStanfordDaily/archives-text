## Pera explains stem cell Ph.D. program vision Director discusses future of first program of its kind in the nation 
### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
A new doctoral program in stem cell biology
and regenerative medicine is set to launch in the
fall of 2012. Approved by the Faculty Senate on
April 28, the interdisciplinary program will
draw not only from the biomedical sciences but
also from the law, business and engineering
schools.
Renee Reijo Pera, professor of obstetrics
and gynecology, will direct the program. The
goal of the doctoral program is to create leaders
who will, in Reijo Pera's words, "change the
world" by translating basic stem cell biology
into cures and clinical therapies.
According to School of Medicine press re
lease, the first class will be made up of three to
six students. The program will eventually enroll
a total of 24 students.
"Even without [an official] website, we are
getting so many emails from students who want
more information about our program," Reijo
Pera said.
Students will be required to take three broad
biomedical sciences courses, called Stem Cell
Biology 1, 2 and 3. They will also have the op
tion of taking additional courses in law, engi
neering and business. Another unique compo
nent of the program is that students will under
go a clinical rotation where they will shadow
surgeons and physicians.
According to Reijo Pera, Stanford is truly
"special" in that it already has the faculty in
place to begin the program. When she and her
colleagues first considered founding a new doc
toral program in stem cell biology, they serious
ly debated another possibility: the expansion of
the current graduate program in the biomedical
sciences.
"We thought about all the options. We
looked at the possibility of expanding some of
the programs currently in place," Reijo Pera
said. "After really thinking about it, we came to
the conclusion that stem cell biology and regen
erative medicine are really unique."
"We couldn't find a natural home for the
program to fit into," she added. "And so, we es
tablished a new one."
According to Reijo Pera, stem
cell biology and regenerative medi
cine have not grown out of a single
discipline; they have evolved from
the "biology of what is a stem cell"
and the "engineering of material
for differentiation" into the arena
of regenerative medicine.
"Establishing a graduate pro
gram in stem cell biology is really
kind of a big deal," she said.
By doing so, Stanford has ful
filled what Reijo Pera considers is
one of its more important functions
as an academic institution

namely, recognizing what consti
tutes a discipline and what does not.
According to Reijo Pera, stem
cell biology is very similar to the
fields of genetics, biochemistry and
molecular biology, which all began
as divisions of biology but have now
evolved, after initial controversy,
into their own disciplines.
"For Stanford to approve [a pro
gram in] stem cell biology and re
generative biology means that they
recognize the field as a discipline
and believe that it's not going to di
minish in importance," Reijo Pera
said.
"We wouldn't start a program if
we thought this was just a fad," she
added.
She expects a degree in stem cell
biology and regenerative medicine

to be marketable and highly valu
able.

Because California passed
Proposition 71 in 2004 after the fed
eral government restricted funding
for stem cell research, the Califor
nia Institute for Regenerative Med
icine accorded Stanford $lB6 mil
lion to pursue further research. This
has allowed Stanford to not only
fund the new doctoral program in
stem cell biology but also to con
struct the new Lorry I. Lokey Stem
Cell Research Building and recruit
top stem cell researchers who will
teach the new doctoral students.
"We want to make this the best
program in the world," Reijo Pera
said. "Along with that, we want to
make sure that our classes are the
best, our students are the best and
our faculty do the best they can in
teaching them."
However, starting a new pro
gram planning courses, creating
a website and raising funds is not
so easy.
"I celebrated the first day and
then I started worrying about the
details the next day," she laughed.
"There's a lot of work."
