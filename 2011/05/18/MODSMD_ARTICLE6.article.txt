# STUDENT GOV'T
## Senate debates use of Nitery rooms, bills ASSU Senate adjourns early to attend SUES student town hall 
### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate raced against
the clock Tuesday night, setting out to finish its
weekly two-hour meeting in half that time, so its
members could attend the tail-end of the Study
of Undergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) student town hall, which was held con
currently in Toyon Lounge. Committee updates
and a discussion of three bills that the Senate
will vote on next week were the main order of
business.
During the meeting, Senator Daniel De-
Long 'l3 announced that two previously locked
rooms on the second floor of the Nitery will
soon be added to the ASSU reservation system.
The news came last night when DeLong re
ceived a phone call from Jeanette Smith-Laws,
director of operations and student unions, who
informed him that the rooms had been cleaned
and are ready for student use.
"I want to say this is a big win for the ASSU,
a big win for the administration and, most im
portantly, a big win for Stanford students," he
said.
"I want to say this is a big win for
the ASSU, a big win for the admin
istration and, most importantly, a
big win for Stanford students," he
said.
Smith-Laws was originally slat
ed to field questions about the
Nitery issue at Tuesday night's
meeting, but the Senate decided to
postpone her appearance because
of the shortened meeting time. She
will be added to next week's agen
da.
Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 then
asked DeLong about the two other
rooms that remained locked in the
Nitery.
"We're looking further into it,"
DeLong said. "From my under
standing, those two rooms are
going to be used essentially for sex
ual assault counselors."
Senator Brianna Pang 'l3 clari
fied that this is just a proposal for
the rooms.
ASSU Vice President Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 then said he
met with Greg Boardman, vice
provost of student affairs, yesterday
during lunch to discuss the remain
ing locked rooms. During their con
versation, they came to the conclu
sion that the ASSU could decide
how the space should be used up to
end of the quarter, but that they
would also establish a working
group one that included mem
bers of both the administration and
the ASSU â€”to draft a proposal
that would determine its long-term
purpose, Macgregor-Dennis said.
"Apparently, Boardman has the
final say," he said. "If we go ahead
with this plan, where the Senate
and the ASSU as a whole puts to
gether a proposal... and follows
certain steps, then he's prepared
even this quarter to publicly
state that the Nitery will then take

that direction."
Macgregor-Dennis finished by
saying that the sexual assault coun
selor will arrive on campus in two
weeks and that it might be in the
Senate's best interest to let the Uni
versity use the rooms as a counsel
ing space for the remainder of the
quarter.
The conversation then turned to
three bills that will be voted on next
week: one that would allow the
ASSU to release the names and
SUID numbers of students who are
requesting refunds for special fees,
another would create a publicly ac
cessible list of projects that the sen
ators and Senate committees are
working on and a piece of legisla
tion that would create the Under
graduate Senate Campaign Financ
ing Fund. This latter fund would
provide up to $lOO to low-income
students to run in Senate elections.

"I'm really upset not really
upset, but sad that we don't have
time to talk about this right now,"
said Elhanan, who authored the last
bill. "This is a really important bill,
something I've been working on for
a long-time and it's not something
we can just talk about in a second."

Senator Janani Ramachandran
'l4 then asked whether the Senate
would better use its time discussing
the three bills, since there was only
one hour left of the SUES town
hall.

Senator Brianna Pang 'l3 re
sponded by saying that they would
be missing the question and answer
session and, therefore, lose out on
hearing student opinions. Senate
Chair Rafael Vasquez "12 asked if
they wanted to take a straw poll to
decide whether or not they should
extend the meeting, but prior to the
vote, senators started packing up
their laptops and backpacks, and
the meeting came to its close.
Earlier in the evening, all fund
ing bills were passed.
