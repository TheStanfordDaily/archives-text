### KURT CHIRBAS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate raced against
the clock Tuesday night, setting out to finish its
weekly two-hour meeting in half that time, so its
members could attend the tail-end of the Study
of Undergraduate Education at Stanford
(SUES) student town hall, which was held con
currently in Toyon Lounge. Committee updates
and a discussion of three bills that the Senate
will vote on next week were the main order of
business.
During the meeting, Senator Daniel De-
Long 'l3 announced that two previously locked
rooms on the second floor of the Nitery will
soon be added to the ASSU reservation system.
The news came last night when DeLong re
ceived a phone call from Jeanette Smith-Laws,
director of operations and student unions, who
informed him that the rooms had been cleaned
and are ready for student use.
"I want to say this is a big win for the ASSU,
a big win for the administration and, most im
portantly, a big win for Stanford students," he
said.
