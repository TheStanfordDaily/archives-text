## Advancing the placement test 
### RUOKE YANG 
The Advanced Placement program
is getting a face lift. This year's
prospective freshmen will be
among the last high school stu
dents to take the old form of the
Advanced Placement (AP) exams. AP, a well
established program by College Board that
offers students the opportunity to take col
lege-level classes in high school, has come
under fire for its alleged inability to adequate
ly prepare students for college level work.
"Frankly, while AP is good preparation
and a strong foundation in general, many of
our faculty and departments do not view it as
comparable to courses here," wrote Richard
Shaw, dean of undergraduate admission, in an
email to The Daily.
Shaheen Jeeawoody 'l4 admitted that
there is a big gap between high school AP
classes and the courses offered at Stanford.
"There are plenty who have taken AP
Physics, and are going into Physics 41, then
didn't do so well at all because they didn't
know the material, [even though] they aced
the [AP] test," she said.
Denise Pope, a senior lecturer in the Stan
ford School of Education, recognizes this lack
of preparation as a big problem. Pope has
been working with schools in the Bay Area
that have decided not to offer certain AP
exams because of concerns that the tests do
not reflect college level work.
"Anything AP does to make students think
more critically, write better, I am for," she
said.
The old AP tests were criticized for at
tempting to cover too much material and en
courage rote memorization. One of the pro
posed reforms would reduce the course con
tent to a more manageable amount. The new
tests would also place increased emphasis on

free-response questions that promote critical
thinking and analysis.
Brandon Garcias 'l5, a prospective fresh
man, has had experiences with both AP and
its counterpart. International Baccalaureate
(IB).
In comparing the AP and the IB programs,
he noted that IB emphasizes writing and
short responses while AP's use of multiple
choice stresses regurgitation.
"Synthesizing information in an essay is
more demonstrative of your grasp of the
knowledge," he said.
Garcias did not think that stress on memo
rization in AP exams would prepare him for
college-level work.
While Pope thinks that the reforms to the
AP program are steps in the right direction,
she has uncertainties. She has suggested an
exam with one or two big questions based on
real scenarios and a recalibrated point struc
ture.
"The program fundamentally needs a
way to look at an individual as an indi
vidual in preparing them for col
lege," she said. "But at the current
scale of standardization and
numbers, that [problem] isn't
going to go away."
Still, standardization and
numbers do offer a gener
al measuring stick un
like GPAs, it is easy to
compare AP scores
across different high
schools. The standard that
AP sets is particularly relevant,
according to Shaw and Pope, in the program's
growth at schools where resources are tight.
In these cases, the standardization is particu
larly beneficial.
For topics like calculus, AP does manage to
teach the essential concepts, Pope said.

Shaw agreed that
the AP test has praisewor
thy aspects.
"AP does set a national
standard and the content is very
well thought out," he said. "Further, it
does assure with rigor of expectation
that students will be given well thought out
academic material which against a [regular
high school] curriculum is more accelerated."
While many schools rely on the AP pro
gram, it is not the only college preparatory
curriculum.
"If a high school does not offer AP, they
can have a structure that is comparable to
AP's difficulty," said Randall Williams, associ
ate dean of Undergraduate Advising and Re
search.
In fact, only 857 out of 1674 students in the
current freshman class received AP credit for

one or more AP test, according to Associate
Registrar Celeste Nguyen.
Shaw said that Stanford considers any stu
dent and "will try to understand the system in
which he or she is being educated."
While uncertainty over the specific
changes for AP remains, Shaw nevertheless
approved of the new initiative.
"We want students to have strong analyti
cal skills and that is a goal of our curriculum,"
he said. "So to the extent that goal can be ini
tiated at the secondary level, it is good."
Pope emphasized that the problems asso
ciated with AP stem from the fact that the
program is serving a whole spectrum of col
leges and high schools.
"That's a problem with tests like these,"
Pope said. "You can't please everyone."
