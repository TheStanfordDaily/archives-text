When Cal does something
better than Stanford,
there's something wrong
not just for rivalry's sake, but also
because our bankrupt neighbors
should rarely outperform us, given
that we are endowed with greater fi
nancial resources and blessed with a
nimbler administrative structure. So
students should be incredulous to
hear that Cal offers each of its 7,000
undergraduates email forwarding for
life, while Stanford cannot promise
the same. Preserving our digital iden
tities is a core concern. By working
collaboratively with the administra
tion, students can forge an acceptable
solution to all parties, but we must ap
proach such a negotiation firm in our
resolve that permanent loss of our
email addresses is unacceptable.
Last year, former ASSU Presi
dent David Gobaud appeared to
have secured lifelong email for
warding, only to have higher ad
ministration officials reverse the
decision the following summer, cit
ing miscommunication. Student
outrage was fleeting, and the issue
disappeared. The problem is that
only seniors faced with the impend
ing prospect of severed University
affiliation realize how important
continuity of email address is. But it
will take a concerted effort by
every single student, especially
elected ASSU officials, to sign peti
tions, write letters and negotiate
with the President and Provost to
preserve that continuity.
Take a moment to consider the
consequences of losing your @stan
ford.edu address. Think about the
prospective employers, former
Professors, fellow students, com
munity contacts, friends and family
who might for any reason try to
email you, only to have their mes
sages bounce. Many of them will ig
nore your mass entreaty to modify
their address books, and you won't
even know to contact others. Over
four years, Stanford students build
formidable networks of contacts
around their email addresses; a de

activated address could stymie the
next start-up collaboration or pre
clude a lasting friendship.
The disadvantages to the Uni
versity of providing email forward
ing pale in comparison to the mas
sive benefits of retaining email con
tinuity. The administration feared
that alumni might masquerade as
Stanford students. Setting aside the
obvious point that all kinds of ad
ministrators and University em
ployees get @stanford.edu ad
dresses as well, students proposed a
simple fix in a letter last year to the
administration: set up an automatic
reflector that alerts the sender to
the recipient's new alumni address.
The administration subsequently
balked at setting up a massive
"spam relay." In reality, such a solu
tion sounds much more intimidat
ing than it actually is it is techni
cally trivial to set up such an auto
mated system that does nothing
more than forward emails and send
a reflector message.
University officials also ap
peared uncomfortable about pro
viding a service in perpetuity, be
cause it limits Stanford's flexibility
in providing future email services.
Perhaps one day email will become
obsolete and the continued guaran
tee of forwarding email will become
onerous to the University. Most stu
dents are probably fine with the idea
of the University canceling its com
mitment to email forwarding in that
unlikely contingency. It is likely that
most students would even be
amenable to paying some nominal
fee to defray the expenditures of
email forwarding. (Senior Gift
Committee, take note: donations
would pour in if you convinced the
administration to change its mind.)
In fact, most students would proba
bly celebrate a University statement
that it would try its best to forward
emails but reserved the right to can
cel the service if it became too cum
bersome.
