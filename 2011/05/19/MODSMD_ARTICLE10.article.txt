# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Professors share 'Visions of Tomorrow' 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford 2020 "Visions of To
morrow" Symposium brought seven
professors to Dinkelspiel Auditori
um yesterday to speak about the sig
nificance and future of their respec
tive research.

Event organizers Danny Crich
ton 'll and Adam Adler 'l2 de
scribed the event as a "debate over
'consilience' the idea that all of
the diverse departments at this Uni
versity are universally connected."
"In an increasingly specialized
world, we want to show that no one
academic discipline is most impor
tant," Adler said. "The future will not
be made of'techies' and 'fuzzies.'"

Highlights included associate
professor of computer science
Mehran Sahami's "Grand Chal
lenges and Immense Impacts of
Computing," which delineated the
need for more computer sciences
majors at U.S. universities given the
three-to-one job-to-graduate ratio
in the field.
"I chose that title because it was

sufficiently general and vague that I
could talk about whatever I want
ed," Sahami said. "What I want to
talk about is the lack of wizards in
the world ... At a certain point
there's so much technology under
the hood that it appears like magic."

He showcased various recent in
novations at Stanford including a
self-driving car and the original
google.stanford.edu as examples
of computing as "an accelerant for
growth" which "allows this kind of
magic to happen."

He also mentioned the recent de
cline in the number of computer sci
entists, but juxtaposed this with the
83-percent increase in students that
Stanford's department has seen in
the last two years due to its curricu
lum restructure to focus on the holis
tic context of computing. Addition
ally, more than 1,600 students took
either CS 105 or CS 106A this year.
"Back in 2000 we were partying
like it was 1999, partially because it
was really close to 1999, but 2005
not so much," he said. "Every single
person from every single computer
science department, including the

very worst student from the very
worst department, can get a job.
What can we do? Say 'Come to com
puting, we've got cookies!

Director of Iranian Studies
Abbas Milani spoke on "Iran, Islam
and Modernity: The Future of the
Middle East." He hypothesized two
situations of international relations
that could exist in 2020.

"Imagine a world where the non
proliferation treaty (NPT) has col
lapsed," he said. "There are esti
mates that by then, if there is no
NPT, there will anywhere from 30 to
40 countries with nuclear bombs ...

Imagine that radical Islamists from
the Muslim brotherhood have won
power in regions in Pakistan and in
Libya and [that] the Hezbollah is the
absolute ruler in Lebanon."
"The other scenario: there is no
country in the Middle East that has a
nuclear bomb," he added. "There are
secular democratic governments.
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has
finally been resolved ... [Scholars]
