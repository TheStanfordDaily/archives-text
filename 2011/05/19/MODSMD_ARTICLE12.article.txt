## IN THE THICK OF A THESIS 
### ARMINE PILIKIAN 
Thesis-writing time? You mean
crunch-time, ugly-time, deep-deep
thoughts-time, blood-sweat-tears
time, days-without-showering
time, girl-don't-even-think-about
naptime time? Indeed, word association
might be one way to go about writing a thesis
choose a topic, break it down into about 17
different parts, pick one, write 50 pages on it
and have it represent your entire undergrad
uate career.

Undertaking such an endeavor takes in
tensive planning, a strict schedule and a heavy
dose of determination. Some students start
preparing as early as sophomore year. Chris
tine Kang 'll started planning at the end of
her sophomore year.
"It really helps to start early; then when

you come across something inter
esting you can say, 'Oh, okay. I want
to write about that'," Kang said.
Kang came across her topic, cor
porate insurance poli-

cies, while completing a directed reading in
her junior year. She is analyzing various insur
ance policies to see what they reveal about
the corporate governance of companies.
After Kang's professor encouraged her to
take on the topic, the only problem was trying
to narrow it down.
"It's just one paper, so it has to be a really
directed question, testable and manageable,"
Kang said.
Kang took several classes geared towards
helping honors students to help work out her
research plan, especially a thesis-timeline.
"Everyone has their own timeline, which is
what's hard about the thesis," she said. "But
the honors seminar gives you a lot of sup
port."
Even though students follow different
timelines, friends still manage to find time to
commiserate together. Irys Kornbluth 'll

gave her friends cred
it for keeping her
motivated.

"Talking to other people who are writing the
ses about their struggles is a really important
way to move forward," Kornbluth said. "You
have to realize that these frustrations are to
tally common."
According to Kang, one of the more popu
lar resources used by toiling thesis writers is
Google Scholar, a specialized search engine,
Kang used it at the beginning of her work to
evaluate the scope of her topic.
"You get a sense of different angles other
researchers have taken," Kang said. "Then
you focus on that small aspect of it."
For Valentin Bolotnyy 'll, finding that
small aspect to define was one of the more dif
ficult parts of the process. Bolotnyy only start
ed to zero in on a specific angle of his topic
two months ago.
"I was looking at broad questions that
people don't really even look at in their Ph.D.
dissertations," Bolotnyy said.

Bolotnyy's initial topic, the mortgage cri
sis, was much too broad.
"What you end up accomplishing is a lit
tle underwhelming given what you've set out
to do," he said. "You've set out to answer
why the financial crisis happened, why the
mortgage crisis happened, but you end up
tackling just one little part of it. Though
when you get down to that smaller part, it's a
lot easier."
A narrow topic, however, still presents a
daunting time commitment. Bolotnyy
spends 30 to 40 hours per week on his thesis,
and the hours increase with each passing
week. But despite the long hours, both
Bolotnyy and Kang believe the process is
worth it.
"It changed the way I look at the materi
als I study in classes ... When you're asked
to produce something original, it really tests
your understanding of what you've been
doing this entire time [in class]," Kang said.
The process revolves around understand
ing how theories apply to the real world, re
searching a topic thoroughly and experienc
ing a rapid evolution of one's academic in
terests. Kornbluth appreciates the chance to
devote herself to a topic she feels passion
ately about. Her research topic is the role of
cultural identity in the design practice of
fashion designers.
"Getting to have so much time to work on
something that I'm so interested in is great,"
she said. "And it's cool to see a study that I
helped design come to fruition and to have
that insider's perspective. Generally, it's a
great way to step back and think about the in
dustry I'll be going into before I actually enter
it."
Most important to the keen thesis writers
is the rush of creating a work in its entirety.
"You feel like you're adding something
new to the field, an element of discovery, an
element of ingenuity," Bolotnyy said.
And ultimately, if you're going to be put
ting in gargantuan amounts of effort, time and
emotional weight, you better love what
you're doing.
"Do it," Kornbluth said. "It's for you and
no one else."
