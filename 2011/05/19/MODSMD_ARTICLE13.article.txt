## SEEING GREEN The 						Girl Who Cried "Green!" 
### Holly Moeller 
VICTORIA, BC I spend a
lot of time fear-mongering
when I write a column. I
think about the world's numerous
problems and how to convey them
in non-technical terms. I list the
ways these problems affect us di
rectly and brainstorm metaphors
for their severity. Most of these tid
bits don't make it into the final
piece, but my columns do fall large
ly on the gloomy side.
So, when I looked at the sched
ule for the second International
Marine Conservation Congress
(IMCC), I was surprised to find the
conference's first day dedicated to
conservation success stories.
Upon further reflection, it wasn't
hard to come up with a long list of
happy conservation outcomes. But
the list of woes seems far longer. So
why, then, did an eminent group of
marine scientists and conservation
ists earmark an entire day for the
"win" column?
Partly, I'm sure, to give all of us
hope in increasingly frightening
times. And also to remind us to fold
that hope into our stories, so that we
can continue to motivate others'
conservation efforts with the prom
ise of eventual success.
Those of us at the IMCC share a
common passion: the oceans, their
fate and changing that fate for the
better. Our sense of the relative im
portance of the key threats (over
fishing, pollution, ocean acidifica
tion, etc.) may vary and our
methodologies for addressing them
(research, advocacy, politics) are
equally variable. But for most of us,
our passion defines us.
At the ripe old age of 24, though,
I've finally figured out that not
everyone cares about my passion.
(It'll take another 24 years for me to
figure out why they're so misguid
ed.) Of course, I've also gotten bet
ter at figuring out why everyone
should care the obvious result of
many hours spent thinking and talk
ing about the things I'm invested in.
We tend to care a lot about
things that are close to us: the local
weather, for example, the syllabus
for our term paper, how our grand
parents are doing and why our in
credible best friend still can't get a
date. In other words, proximity rules
our passions. That proximity can be
physical, intellectual or emotional.
Either way, the closer something
hits to home, the more likely we are
to respond.
That's part of the reason we've
been so slow to address global envi
ronmental threats. Sure, carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere are
rising fast. Sure, some mysteri
ous models say that the climate will
change, and the oceans will acidify
(and actual, tangible evidence is ac
cumulating, too). But these changes
are incremental, so gradual that it
would be impossible for you and I
to perceive a change on our own,
the way we notice when the temper
ature drops 20 degrees Fahrenheit
overnight. And the effects are
equally incremental: glaciers don't
melt overnight and coral reefs don't
dissolve in a day.
So how do we bring these effects
home? How do we motivate our-

selves to care?
Communicating science in the pres
ent day â€”of climate change and
ocean acidification, of global prob
lems with tough solutions is all
about balance. The fear balance.
Scare tactics can be effective
to a point. We've known since child
hood that fear of punishment is a
formidable motivator. So we tell
people that they don't want their
children to be spanked by sea level
rise. They don't want their favorite
vacation spot to be confiscated.
But as an environmental com
munications professor once told
me, "You need to scare people. Just
not so much that they shut down."
Climate change, when we really
meditate on it, is totally overwhelm
ing. The impacts are terrifying, but
the prevention steps are equally
paralyzing. How can we possibly
"get off" of fossil fuels? How can we
transition into a sustainable econo
my when we hardly know what
"sustainable" means?
Taken aback by the magnitude
of the problem, many people re
spond by ignoring it or by denying
its existence. So the conservation
community has taken to spitting out
bite-sized pieces of advice. "Drive
less, bike more." "Offset your car
bon emissions." "Buy fresh, buy
local." Climate change has been wa
tered down for general consump
tion, and the drink is becoming pop
ular.
Losing your audience is the same
as saying nothing except that
you're frustrated and out of breath.
But it can be equally frustrating to
watch people feel vindicated when
they remember their canvas shop
ping bag or when they choose one
vegetarian meal out of five. Mostly
we tell ourselves, "something is bet
ter than nothing," but sometimes
that something distracts us from the
real issues at stake, gives us a false
sense of security and allows us to
push a serious problem to the backs
of our minds.
Our challenge, now that the ma
jority of Americans acknowledge cli
mate change, is to keep the ball
rolling. We have to know our audi
ence and the changing state of their
knowledge. We must reward success
without indulging complacency. We
must continue to push the bound
aries of our communication, to intro
duce new issues and their solutions.
The IMCC, bolstered by a first
day jolt of hope, carries on with an
optimistic tone. The ocean is in trou
ble, but these people are busy find
ing solutions and communicating
their passion. At least here, in this
moment, in this place, the future
looks dim. A long way from bright,
but still better than black.
