# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## And I Would Walk 5,335 Miles... Ba Da Da Da 
### Shane Savitsky 
On Wednesday morning, I
woke up here in Oxford to a
Facebook feed filled with
friends excitedly discussing their
housing assignments for next year.
Super thrilling, right? With time dif
ferences, I had figured I probably
wouldn't see my housing assignment
until Wednesday night at best.
Thank God for technical glitches
from the Housing department. After
wrangling with Axess for the better
part of 15 minutes, I finally was able
to log into the Housing website.
Now, this climactic moment had
been kind of soul-crushing for me
the past two years: I ended up in
Naranja sophomore year (had been

hoping forToyon) and rode a beauti
ful #2846 into Loro this year (FloMo
again? Really?). Though housing for
both years ended up working out,
this was my time to use Tier 1. Next
year will be my senior year my
last stand at Stanford. I didn't want
things to be just "okay" and end up in
717 or Timbuktu or something. So
imagine my surprise when I checked
my housing results to see that I had
ended up in Xanadu with a draw
number of #I2.TWELVE.This is the
stuff of legend. Quite honestly, I
think I might have won Stanford.
And so, my assignment in
Xanadu led to me checking out the
house via Google Maps even
though I've been inside more times
than I can count. You know, I was just
excitedly theorizing about where my
room might be and what kind of
ragers I could potentially throw
there. Just the usual stuff. I've want
ed to live on the Row for so long that
it's kind of surreal to know that I'm
actually going to be living there
especially in the exact house I'd been
hoping for.
But then, a weird thing happened.
My Google Maps exploration of
Xanadu led to a Google Maps explo
ration of the entire Stanford campus.
I was just zooming around checking
out all of the places where memories
have been made for the past three
years. That Google Maps session led
me to browse Stanford's Wikipedia
page. From there, I inexplicably got a
strange craving for a 4x4 from In-N-
Out.
This all brought upon a realiza
tion: I really miss Stanford. I don't
mean that in an "I hate Oxford, and I
wish I was back on campus" kind of
way. I'm having the time of my life
here, all while learning so much and
making tons of new friends. No, I
think I finally just realized how much
Stanford has become my second
home. It's just weird to think how so
many of the people and things I care
about are concentrated in one small
slice of California. It's also weird to
think that I had never set foot on
Stanford's campus prior to 2008, yet
it can still mean so much to me now.
I'll tell you, going abroad has

been a rather interesting experience
thus far. It's forced me to reconsider
my thoughts about the way I ap
proach academics at Stanford. It's
been like freshman year all over
again in terms of making friends. It's
also forced me to put words like
"cheers" and "quid" and "loo" into
my everyday lexicon. Yet more than
anything, being here in Oxford has
really helped me to learn to appreci
ate things I take for granted back at
Stanford. I miss the weather. I miss
lending library facilities (Oxford li
braries are reference only). I miss
Lag Late Nite, I miss all of my best
friends, especially when a huge por
tion of them will be graduating in a
few weeks. But above it all, I miss the
Farm. It's where everything that's
good or bad in my collegiate life has
taken place the place where I've
been able to make my proverbial
"stand." It's been the place where
I've been allowed to create my own
little niche in the vast cosmic uni
verse. Like I've said already, it's my
second home.
So I guess it's a good thing that I'll
be spending this whole summer on
campus then, right?

Shane isn't quite sure whether it's good
he'll be on campus this entire sum
mer? Email him your thoughts and
reminisces about Stanford at savit

This is the stuff of legend.
Quite honestly, I think I
might have won Stanford.
