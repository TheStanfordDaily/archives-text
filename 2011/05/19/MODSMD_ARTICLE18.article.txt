## THURSDAY NIGHT LIGHTS Cardinal and Aggies tangle in Texas-sized showdown 
### ALEX ECKERT STAFF WRITER 
Now it gets interesting.
Tonight, the eighth-seeded
Stanford men's tennis team hosts
ninth-seeded Texas A&M in the
NCAA round of 16 and there
might not be two hotter teams in
the country right now than the
Cardinal and the Aggies.
Stanford (20-5, 5-1 Pac-10)
comes in riding a 12-game win
ning streak and handily won its
first two matches of the tourna
ment, defeating Army 4-0 and
No. 25 Washington 4-1.
Texas A&M (29-5,5-1 Big-12)
recently claimed the Big-12 tour
nament championship, defeating
Oklahoma in the finals, and it
hasn't given up a single point in
its last five matches. The Aggies
also had an auspicious start to
their tournament, defeating both
No. 34 Louisiana State and Al
corn State by counts of 4-0.
Senior Greg Hirshman ex
pects the match to be as good as
advertised.
"I haven't looked into a lot of
their players, but I know that
we're eight and they're nine, so
it's going to be a tough match,"
Hirshman said. "When you play a
team in the top-10 it really comes
down to a couple of points here
and there. Not just in individual
matches, but in the entire team
match.
"When you look back to the
[ITA National Indoor Champi
onship], where we went 1-2,
every match was 3-3 in singles
and came down to who won the
doubles point," Hirshman con
tinued. "It's going to be one of
those matches that it comes
down to a couple of points and I
think having the home court will

be a big help in getting those key
points."

Despite the tough competition
ahead, there are plenty of good signs
for the Cardinal. Four teams that
Stanford has defeated remain in the
field —No. 2 USC, No. 12 UCLA,
No. 14 Cal and unseeded Tulsa,
which defeated No. 13 Texas in one
of the only upsets of the early
rounds.
That being said, all five of the
Stanford's losses came at the hands
of teams still alive in the tourney.
Perhaps the best sign for the Cardi
nal is the advantage Hirshman inti
mated: this is their court.
Stanford has played exceedingly
well at home this season, going 15-1
with a lone loss coming in a nail
biter to second-seeded USC. Hirsh
man believes that playing at home
will play a huge factor going for
ward.
"I think getting a lot of people
out supporting us will definitely
help," Hirshman said. "Even if the
team is slightly worse, fans may in
spire them to get the win and the
reality is that there is no team, if
any, that is much better than us in
this whole tournament. That's why
home court advantage is so big in a
lot of pro sports. When teams are
roughly evenly matched, seemingly
little factors make a big differ
ence."
Both Hirshman and head coach
John Whitlinger are looking forward
to playing in front of bigger crowds,
not just because they can lift a team
to victory, but because the matches
provide some of the more memo
rable experiences that a young play
er can have.
Even in last weekend's matches
especially against Washington
the crowd at Taube Tennis Center

was one of the loudest of the season,
and the crowds will only get bigger if
Stanford keeps advancing.
Whitlinger talked about the last
time Stanford hosted the NCAAs.
"I know in 2006 how inspiring it
was when the place was full and we
played Duke," said Whitlinger. "It's
something that the guys will never
forget... I hope we get to the point
where the guys can experience
something like that."
Despite having optimism on its
home courts, the team is also
painfully aware of what happens if it
loses. Stanford has lost in the round
of 16 in both of the past two seasons
to UCLA last year and eventual
champion USC the year before that.
As a senior, Hirshman views this
tournament as especially meaning
ful.
"We're going so strong right now,
but if we lose on Thursday, it's over,"
he said. "We'd have nothing. Espe
cially for the seniors on the team
for me, Alex [Clayton] and Ted
[Kelly] if we lose that's the end of
college tennis for us. That's obvious
ly not something we want to happen,
and there's no better way to go out
than on a win."
"If you think back to when Pete
Sampras won the U.S. Open and
then retired, he went out on top.
That's what Ted, Alex and I are real
ly looking at as seniors. Everyone
wants to win and show what all our
hard work was for, but it is especial
ly meaningful for us seniors."
If the Cardinal manages to win
tonight, it most likely will play top
seeded Virginia a team that has
not lost all season —in the next
round.
There will be men's tournament
action all day today at the Taube
Tennis Center, with matches starting
at 9 a.m. and culminating with the
Stanford-Texas A&M match at 6
p.m. tonight.
