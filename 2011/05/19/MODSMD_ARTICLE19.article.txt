### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford softball team earned an at-large bid in
to the NCAA Tournament on Monday, grabbing the
No. 15 overall seed and the honor of hosting one of the
16 regionals.
In addition to the Cardinal's postseason berth, No.
19 Stanford (38-15) received more good news on
Wednesday when junior shortstop Ashley Hansen was
named Pac-10 Player of the Year.
Hansen is just the second player in Cardinal history
to earn the honor, and she did so mostly through her
otherworldly offensive numbers. Hansen batted an un
believable .506 for the season 63 points higher than
the next player than the next-best batting average
and she also led the Pac-10 in hits (88), doubles (24),
slugging percentage (.833) and on-base percentage
(.568).
Hansen was one of just eight players to be earn All-
Pac-10 Conference honors, as she and sophomore
pitcher Teagan Gerhart were named to the First Team.
Junior centerfielder Sarah Hassman and sophomore
second baseman Jenna Rich earned Second Team acco
lades, while senior pitcher Ashley Chinn and freshman
outfielder Corey Hanewich were named honorable
mentions.
The talented Cardinal hosts Pacific (38-17) on Fri
day in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament,
and should the Cardinal overtake the Tigers, it will
square off against the winner of Nebraska (39-12) and
Fresno State (34-17) on Saturday.
Stanford defeated Pacific by a score of 6-1 in a
matchup earlier this year in Stockton, and the Cardinal
is 21-10 all-time against the Tigers.
The Tigers earned a spot in the tournament by win
ning the Big West Conference this season, their first
ever conference championship. This is Pacific's first
NCAA Tournament berth since 2007.
Meanwhile, Stanford is making its 14th consecutive
tournament appearance, and in that span the Cardinal
has won six regional titles and made two appearances in
the Women's College World Series, in 2001 and 2006.

Should Stanford advance out of the regional, the
team would travel to face the winner of the Tuscaloosa
Region, which includes No. 2 seed Alabama, Jackson
State, Memphis and Chattanooga.
First pitch between the Cardinal and Tigers is sched
uled for 6 p.m. at Smith Family Stadium on Friday night.
