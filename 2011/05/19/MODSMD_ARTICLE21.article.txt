# Draft and lottery both silly

### Jacob Jaffe 
The fates of millions of dol
lars, years of media coverage
and many young men's
lives, all decided by a few
tiny, hollow balls weighing
about a tenth of an ounce.
Nope, for once I'm not talking
about Ma Lin or any other legendary
Chinese ping-pong players. It's not
even the SAE beer pong tournament.
No, it's something much more widely
known, and something much more pa
thetic than either of these.
It's the NBA Draft Lottery.
Anyone who turned on ESPN a lit
tle early on Tuesday night before
Game 1 between Dirk Nowitzki and
the Thunder got the treat of one of the
oddest spectacles in sports before the
game itself tipped off
For those of you that don't know,
the NBA uses a different system from
the other major sports leagues to de
cide the order of its draft. Instead of
making the order depend solely on the
teams' records and playoff perform
ances in the previous season, the NBA
holds a lottery to decide the order for
all the non-playoff teams. Teams with
worse records still have the best chance
to get earlier picks, but there is much
more randomness thrown in.
And, in this era where computers
can sort random numbers and display
the results in the blink of an eye (Stan
ford's housing draw apparently not in
cluded), it's only natural that the NBA
uses... ping-pong balls?

That's right, your favorite team's
first-round pick (who am I kidding,
you're probably a fair-weather Lakers
or Heat fan; you don't care about the
lottery) depends on which ping-pong
balls are randomly chosen in a highly
official, secretive process. Hey, if it
works for other lotteries, why not the
NBA?
As silly as this seems, the random
ness makes sense for the NBA. After
all, no other major sports league relies
so heavily on the power of one or two
star players. Think about it, in any other
league, even a player as talented as Le-
Bron James wouldn't be able to win a

title by himself He'd probably have to
team up with some of the other best
players in the league just to have a shot.
Can you imagine that happening in the
NBA? Oh wait...

In any case, after a massive specta
cle that involved some of the most
awkward, pointless interviews of all
time ("Hey John Wall, what are your
chances at getting two straight No. 1
picks in Washington?" "It all depends
on luck."), the order is set. The Cava
liers, trying to rebuild from He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named-But-Was-Just-
Named-In-The-Last-Paragraph,
earned the rights to two of the top four
picks. And the way the NBA Draft
works, especially with this year's class,
the Cavs have roughly a 10 percent
chance at getting a decent NBA player
in the first round.

Think about it this year's top
two picks in most people's minds and
mock drafts consist of a guy who was
hurt most of last year before coming
back in time to lead Duke to an upset
loss in the NCAA Tournament (Kyrie
Irving) and a guy who 90 percent of
the country didn't know about until
that same game (Derrick Williams).
And those are the best prospects
available. Other top-10 options in
clude a guy who didn't play organized
ball for the past year, a guy who might
not want to leave Europe for contract
reasons and a guy who averaged 6.3
points per game in Spain this year.
While this class is particularly lack
ing in flashy names (and good players),
it is in some ways par for the draft
course. Looking back, the draft is as
much of a crapshoot as the lottery.
Names like Sam Bowie, Darko Milicic
and Greg Oden are ingrained in the
collective basketball mind as warnings
and, in some cases, laughable mistakes.
But before you go bashing draft
blunders, take a closer look at old
drafts. Take 2007, when Greg Oden
was still Greg Oden-with-knees. Now
it seems silly to think of taking Oden
over Kevin Durant and A1 Horford,
who were the next two picks. But back
then, who knew?
Who knew Oden would have more
surgeries than playoff games by this
point? But when you look deeper at
that draft, though, you see even more
of the unpredictability of drafts in gen
eral. After Durant and Horford, there
were exactly zero players taken that
year that have made an All-Star or All-
NBA Team.
Marc Gasol, one of the stars in the
Memphis Grizzlies' surprising playoff
run this season, was taken 48th overall
that year. He was seen as a lesser ver
sion of his brother Pau, and as a for
eigner, most teams didn't know exact
ly what to make of him. As it turns out,
the 10 guys picked immediately before
him in that draft have started 78 NBA
games less than a full season —in
their careers combined (Gasol outdid
that mark this year alone). Gasol's
2,934 points in three seasons are over
double the 1,182 points scored by the
other 10 in their careers.
1n2007, what separated Gasol from
Kyrylo Fesenko, Stanko Barac, Sun
Yue, Chris Richard, Derrick Byars,
Adam Haluska, Reyshawn Terry,
Jared Jordan, Stephane Lasme and
Dominic McGuire?
NBA executives didn't know.
Would you?

Irving) and a guy who 90 percent of
the country didn't know about until
that same game (Derrick Williams).
And those are the best prospects
available. Other top-10 options in
clude a guy who didn't play organized
ball for the past year, a guy who might
not want to leave Europe for contract
reasons and a guy who averaged 6.3
points per game in Spain this year.
While this class is particularly lack
ing in flashy names (and good players),
it is in some ways par for the draft
course. Looking back, the draft is as
much of a crapshoot as the lottery.
Names like Sam Bowie, Darko Milicic
and Greg Oden are ingrained in the
collective basketball mind as warnings
and, in some cases, laughable mistakes.
But before you go bashing draft
blunders, take a closer look at old
drafts. Take 2007, when Greg Oden
was still Greg Oden-with-knees. Now
it seems silly to think of taking Oden
over Kevin Durant and A1 Horford,
who were the next two picks. But back
then, who knew?
Who knew Oden would have more
surgeries than playoff games by this
point? But when you look deeper at
that draft, though, you see even more
of the unpredictability of drafts in gen
eral. After Durant and Horford, there
were exactly zero players taken that
year that have made an All-Star or All-
NBA Team.
Marc Gasol, one of the stars in the
Memphis Grizzlies' surprising playoff
run this season, was taken 48th overall
that year. He was seen as a lesser ver
sion of his brother Pau, and as a for
eigner, most teams didn't know exact
ly what to make of him. As it turns out,
the 10 guys picked immediately before
him in that draft have started 78 NBA
games less than a full season —in
their careers combined (Gasol outdid
that mark this year alone). Gasol's
2,934 points in three seasons are over
double the 1,182 points scored by the
other 10 in their careers.
1n2007, what separated Gasol from
Kyrylo Fesenko, Stanko Barac, Sun
Yue, Chris Richard, Derrick Byars,
Adam Haluska, Reyshawn Terry,
Jared Jordan, Stephane Lasme and
Dominic McGuire?
NBA executives didn't know.
Would you?

The fates of millions of dol
lars, years of media coverage
and many young men's
lives, all decided by a few
tiny, hollow balls weighing
about a tenth of an ounce.
Nope, for once I'm not talking
about Ma Lin or any other legendary
Chinese ping-pong players. It's not
even the SAE beer pong tournament.
No, it's something much more widely
known, and something much more pa
thetic than either of these.
It's the NBA Draft Lottery.
Anyone who turned on ESPN a lit
tle early on Tuesday night before
Game 1 between Dirk Nowitzki and
the Thunder got the treat of one of the
oddest spectacles in sports before the
game itself tipped off
For those of you that don't know,
the NBA uses a different system from
the other major sports leagues to de
cide the order of its draft. Instead of
making the order depend solely on the
teams' records and playoff perform
ances in the previous season, the NBA
holds a lottery to decide the order for
all the non-playoff teams. Teams with
worse records still have the best chance
to get earlier picks, but there is much
more randomness thrown in.
And, in this era where computers
can sort random numbers and display
the results in the blink of an eye (Stan
ford's housing draw apparently not in
cluded), it's only natural that the NBA
uses... ping-pong balls?

That's right, your favorite team's
first-round pick (who am I kidding,
you're probably a fair-weather Lakers
or Heat fan; you don't care about the
lottery) depends on which ping-pong
balls are randomly chosen in a highly
official, secretive process. Hey, if it
works for other lotteries, why not the
NBA?
As silly as this seems, the random
ness makes sense for the NBA. After
all, no other major sports league relies
so heavily on the power of one or two
star players. Think about it, in any other
league, even a player as talented as Le-
Bron James wouldn't be able to win a

title by himself He'd probably have to
team up with some of the other best
players in the league just to have a shot.
Can you imagine that happening in the
NBA? Oh wait...

In any case, after a massive specta
cle that involved some of the most
awkward, pointless interviews of all
time ("Hey John Wall, what are your
chances at getting two straight No. 1
picks in Washington?" "It all depends
on luck."), the order is set. The Cava
liers, trying to rebuild from He-Who-
Must-Not-Be-Named-But-Was-Just-
Named-In-The-Last-Paragraph,
earned the rights to two of the top four
picks. And the way the NBA Draft
works, especially with this year's class,
the Cavs have roughly a 10 percent
chance at getting a decent NBA player
in the first round.

Think about it this year's top
two picks in most people's minds and
mock drafts consist of a guy who was
hurt most of last year before coming
back in time to lead Duke to an upset
loss in the NCAA Tournament (Kyrie
Irving) and a guy who 90 percent of
the country didn't know about until
that same game (Derrick Williams).
And those are the best prospects
available. Other top-10 options in
clude a guy who didn't play organized
ball for the past year, a guy who might
not want to leave Europe for contract
reasons and a guy who averaged 6.3
points per game in Spain this year.
