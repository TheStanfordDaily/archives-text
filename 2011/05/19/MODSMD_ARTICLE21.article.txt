# Draft and lottery both silly
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
The fates of millions of dol
lars, years of media coverage
and many young men's
lives, all decided by a few
tiny, hollow balls weighing
about a tenth of an ounce.
Nope, for once I'm not talking
about Ma Lin or any other legendary
Chinese ping-pong players. It's not
even the SAE beer pong tournament.
No, it's something much more widely
known, and something much more pa
thetic than either of these.
It's the NBA Draft Lottery.
Anyone who turned on ESPN a lit
tle early on Tuesday night before
Game 1 between Dirk Nowitzki and
the Thunder got the treat of one of the
oddest spectacles in sports before the
game itself tipped off
For those of you that don't know,
the NBA uses a different system from
the other major sports leagues to de
cide the order of its draft. Instead of
making the order depend solely on the
teams' records and playoff perform
ances in the previous season, the NBA
holds a lottery to decide the order for
all the non-playoff teams. Teams with
worse records still have the best chance
to get earlier picks, but there is much
more randomness thrown in.
And, in this era where computers
can sort random numbers and display
the results in the blink of an eye (Stan
ford's housing draw apparently not in
cluded), it's only natural that the NBA
uses... ping-pong balls?
