## Police locate firearm involved in Lag shooting 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ An Le Nguyen 
The Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety (SUDPS) is still
pursuing leads in the aftermath of the
May 14 shooting in the Lagunita
parking lot.
According to Stanford police ser
geant Chris Cohendet, detectives are
following up on statements made by
witnesses and by the suspects who
were taken into custody the night of
the shooting. The suspects attempted
to speed away from authorities in a
vehicle, but were apprehended after
they exited the vehicle and fled on
foot. Police officers examined the
area where the suspects were de
tained shortly thereafter.
"An officer canvassed the area
and located the handgun along the
path where the vehicle was resting,"
Cohendet said.
Initial statements from witnesses
described the handgun in question as
silver or black. The police found a
two-tone "black and silver handgun"
which seemed to correspond with
these statements, Cohendet said.
Cohendet stated that charges
have not yet been made since the in
vestigation is still ongoing. At present,
the incident only appears to involve
the "illegal discharge of a firearm," he
said.
