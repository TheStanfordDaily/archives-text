## ASSU creates diversity board Executive Community Board to promote student groups 
### ELENA STEPHENSON 
ASSU President Michael Cruz *l2 and
Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis
'l3 are set to introduce the ASSU Executive
Community Board this year, a new body de
signed to better address issues of diversity
and tolerance on campus. The organization
al chart on their website places the new
Community Board on the same level as the
traditional Executive Cabinet.
"The main reason for the change is the
fact that diversity/tolerance is an important
issue, but ASSU has had a hard time pro
ducing results," wrote Emma Ogiemwanye
'l2, ASSU executive chief of staff, in an
email to The Daily. "The hope is that it will
be 1) a forum to discuss issues and 2) have a
deliverable this year."
Such a deliverable, she said, would in
volve the use of ASSU resources to relieve

the strain on communities organizing nu
merous programs and initiatives.
The Community Board will consist of a
group of Community Action Representa
tives (CARs). In order to encompass a
broad definition of "community," any com
munity that applied for a position on the
new Board will be represented.
According to an open letter on the Exec
utive's website, among the represented
groups are the Queer/LGBT community,
the women's community, the religious/faith
communities and various ethnic communi
ties, such as the Native American,
Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander and
Black communities.

A new position, the chair of communi
ties, will be created under the new board.
Along with the chair of student life, the
chair of communities will serve as the pri
mary liaison between the Community
Board and the Executive Cabinet. The two
chairs will attend both bodies' meetings.
Community Board meetings will be held
