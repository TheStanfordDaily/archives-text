# Searsville comm. draws local criticism
## Critics call for Stanford-only group to include outside groups 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford recently named five faculty members to a
committee designed to determine the future of Searsville
Dam. The new committee, however, has sparked some
concern among due to its lack of representation from the
outside community or local nongovernmental organiza
tions (NGOs).

The Searsville Dam project has been a topic of contro
versy between the University and environmental ac
tivists in recent years. Environmental activists have
protested the dam's current interference with the natural
habitat of the steelhead trout, currently an endangered
species.

"I am concerned that at least for now the committee
doesn't have any outside participation," said Steve
Rothert, California regional director for American
Rivers, an NGO that has long been concerned about the
fate of the dam. "I recognize this is a very complex and
controversial issue. I recognize this is also Stanford's
dam. One might argue Stanford should make the deci
sion, but the dam also affects the community and public
resources that everyone has an interest in."
Rothert believes the University should seek advice
from those who are not directly involved in the commit
tee or linked to Stanford to achieve a durable solution.

According to Philippe Cohen, administrative director
at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, Stanford intends to
seek advice from public agencies and plans to discuss dif
ferent ways to engage the outside community in early
committee discussions. He revealed, however, that be
fore community discussion can begin, the committee
must outline its objectives for the dam.
"I think that Stanford needs to identify what it consid
ers its highest priorities with regard to the future of
Searsville before engaging the general public," Cohen
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Without that internal
clarity, there is too much potential for miscommunica
tion and confusion."

Cohen explained that communication with outside
agencies is not only important, but also necessary for the
Searsville Dam project. He stated that regardless of the
committee's final plan, Stanford must obtain permits
from various agencies, including the National Marine
Fisheries Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the
California Department of Fish and Game and the State
Water Quality Board.

"All of these agencies have public comment and out
reach components which further guarantees that there
will be plenty of opportunity for public input," Cohen said.
Cohen revealed that the University plans to partici-
