## Brinkley tells story behind 'Cambodia's Curse' 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In an appearance at the Stanford Bookstore
on Wednesday afternoon, author and communi
cation professor Joel Brinkley signed copies of
his new book, "Cambodia's Curse," offering an

inside look into the difficulties facing the country
and discussing his research for the book.
Brinkley opened the talk by briefly explaining
the recent history of Cambodia, starting with its
UN-supervised election in 1992.Though the elec
tion was very successful, with 90 percent of Cam
bodians voting, the country quickly fell back into

dictatorship its current leader, Hun Sen, has
ruled the country autocratically since 1997.
According to Brinkley, Cambodia has become
"invisible" to the outside world.

''The predominant view worldwide has been,
'Oh, but they're so much better off now than they
were under the Khmer Rouge,'" he said. "'No
reason to pay attention any longer.'"
The enduring legacy of the brutal Khmer
Rouge regime, which killed around a quarter of
the Cambodian population during its reign from
1975 to 1979, continues to suppress Cambodian
development up to the present. Brinkley de
scribed the prevalence of post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and other related illnesses in
the country. Between a quarter and half of all
Cambodians who survived the Khmer Rouge
suffer from PTSD and a study revealed that 62
percent of Cambodian emigrants in Long Beach,
Calif, have the disorder, he said.
"Soon that generation will die, you might
think, and everything will okay," Brinkley said.
"Actually Cambodia is the only place in the
world where it has been demonstrated that PTSD
and the related traumatic illnesses are being
passed to a second generation."
Brinkley described the dire state of Cambo
dia's economic development with a per-capita
annual income of roughly $650, the country is one
of the world's poorest, on par with Bangladesh
and Afghanistan. The result of that poverty is a
state where 40 percent of the country's children

are stunted from malnutrition and
10 percent are wasting.
He pointed to endemic corrup
tion in the government as a signifi
cant contributor to this problem
and said that Middle Eastern dicta
tors like Hosni Mubarak and
Muammar Qaddafi are "squeaky
clean" when compared to Hun
Sen's regime.
"The only overweight people
you will find anywhere in the nation
walk the halls of government,"
Brinkley said. "Many of them live in
mansions the size of hotels. I did a
rough calculation of the size of the
deputy prime minister's mansion
I estimated it to be around 60,000
square feet."
Because of Cambodia's unique
situation and national mentality,
Brinkley said he doubts the country
will ever experience an uprising
similar to what is being seen in the
Middle East today. He contrasted
two recent national surveys, one
that asked about people's current

condition and another that asked
for their satisfaction with their lives.
Only 3 percent of Cambodians re
ported that they were "thriving,"
with 22 percent saying they were
"struggling." However, 75 to 80 per
cent reported in the second survey
that they were satisfied with their
lives and that their country was
going in the right direction.
Brinkley concluded his talk by
discussing why the outside world,
the West in particular, should give
more attention to Cambodia. Be
yond ensuring accurate oversight of
the $l.l billion in aid that goes to
the government every year, he said
a strong Cambodia could help in the
United States' search for allies to
counterbalance a rising China.
"China is virtually buying [Cam
bodia], spending many billions of
dollars building roads, bridges, dams
and infrastructure so that they can
get their trucks to natural resources
without any hectoring about democ
racy and human rights," he said.
"Shouldn't it be important to hold
on to a state right in the center of
Southeast Asia?"
