## Brinkley tells story behind 'Cambodia's Curse' 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In an appearance at the Stanford Bookstore
on Wednesday afternoon, author and communi
cation professor Joel Brinkley signed copies of
his new book, "Cambodia's Curse," offering an

inside look into the difficulties facing the country
and discussing his research for the book.
Brinkley opened the talk by briefly explaining
the recent history of Cambodia, starting with its
UN-supervised election in 1992.Though the elec
tion was very successful, with 90 percent of Cam
bodians voting, the country quickly fell back into

dictatorship its current leader, Hun Sen, has
ruled the country autocratically since 1997.
According to Brinkley, Cambodia has become
"invisible" to the outside world.

''The predominant view worldwide has been,
'Oh, but they're so much better off now than they
were under the Khmer Rouge,'" he said. "'No
reason to pay attention any longer.'"
The enduring legacy of the brutal Khmer
Rouge regime, which killed around a quarter of
the Cambodian population during its reign from
1975 to 1979, continues to suppress Cambodian
development up to the present. Brinkley de
scribed the prevalence of post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and other related illnesses in
the country. Between a quarter and half of all
Cambodians who survived the Khmer Rouge
suffer from PTSD and a study revealed that 62
percent of Cambodian emigrants in Long Beach,
Calif, have the disorder, he said.
"Soon that generation will die, you might
think, and everything will okay," Brinkley said.
"Actually Cambodia is the only place in the
world where it has been demonstrated that PTSD
and the related traumatic illnesses are being
passed to a second generation."
Brinkley described the dire state of Cambo
dia's economic development with a per-capita
annual income of roughly $650, the country is one
of the world's poorest, on par with Bangladesh
and Afghanistan. The result of that poverty is a
state where 40 percent of the country's children
