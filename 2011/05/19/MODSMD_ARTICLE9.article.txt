## Third Eye Blind to play at CoHo 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
Verizon Wireless has teamed up
with the CoHo to bring San Francis
co-based Third Eye Blind to campus
for a free concert on Thursday, May
26. The concert is part of Verizon In
sider's Coffee Shop Series, a move
by the company to bring local bands
to bay-area coffee shops and pro
mote its new XOOM tablet.
As part of its marketing cam
paign, Verizon offered opportunities
for anyone to win free tickets to the
event by testing out the new XOOM
tablet at the Palo Alto Verizon store.
Links to the contest application are
also available on the CoHo's Face
book page and on the Verizon Insid
er site.
"It started about two months
ago," said Erick Guzman, director of
operations for the CoHo. "We want
ed to put together an event as our
way of thanking Stanford students

and it sort of fell into place."
With several hundred tickets
available, the event is large for the
CoHo, which will have to move out
all of its tables and chairs and shut
down its food service for the night.
In an email to The Daily, Nanci
Howe, director of the Student Activ
ities and Leadership, said the CoHo
has been working with the Depart
ment of Public Safety, Office of
Events and Protocol, Student Activ
ities and Leadership and other
groups to ensure the event goes
smoothly.
In addition, Howe said the event
would be treated like a typical con
cert, thereby requiring its organizers
to abide by University policies re
garding crowd management, securi
ty and promotions.
The Third Eye Blind perform
ance is the latest of a marketing cam
paign by Verizon targeted at Stan
ford students. When asked about
Verizon's motivation for bringing

these deals to Stanford, Jette
Speights, public relations manager at
Tribal Brands for Verizon Wireless,
said Verizon thought the "tech
savvy, music-loving Stanford com
munity would be a great fit for the
next program" in the Coffee Shop
Series. Speights added that Stephen
Jenkins, the lead singer of Third Eye
Blind, grew up near the campus and
used to frequent the coffee house in
the days when it operated under a
different management team.
This recent campaign to gain
campus visibility may also be part of
a larger push by Verizon Wireless to
challenge AT&T's dominance at
Stanford, an observation that has
spawned rumors of a University-
AT&T contract in the past. The mar
keting push also coincides with the
release of the iPhone on the Verizon
network.
