### DAILY NEWS STAFF Ivy Nguyen 
The Matadero Trail, a public hik
ing trail which runs between the
south of Page Mill Road and Foothill
expressway, opens today. The trail is
part of a network of trails that the
University agreed to construct as
part of its land-use agreement with
Santa Clara County in 2000.
The opening comes after over a
decade of criticism over the project.
The trails, which were proposed in
1995, prompted a 2006 lawsuit
against the county and the Universi
ty that claimed that the environmen
tal review of plans had been insuffi
cient.The state Supreme Court over
turned an appellate court ruling on
that case in February 2010.
The northern part of the trail,
which will run from El Camino Real
to Arastradero Road, remains
caught between two different routes

versity. The San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors rejected the
University's plan in 2010 and has
until Dec. 31 of this year to decide
whether it will accept $8.4 million

from the University to build one seg
ment along Alpine Road.
Stanford's $1 million offer to the

cently tabled, pending an environ
mental review of and more debate
