## EDITORIAL Reflecting on campus safety and community 
### 
Last weekend, we were
shocked and disturbed to
learn that shots had been
fired here on the Farm. As we all
struggle to understand what hap
pened, we must re-examine the
safety of our campus and to hold
any negligent students, administra
tors, or security personnel account
able. While this incident raises seri
ous concerns about current safety
measures, we must also seize this
rare opportunity to explore our
own attitudes about issues of race
and class.
The shots fired after Blackfest
made the issue of public safety in
stantly more important in the
minds of many students. We recog
nize the hard work and diligence of
the campus police and University
administrators who make our
events safe and enjoyable, but Sat
urday's incident demonstrates
some room for improvement.
The University is already work
ing to ensure that the event organ
izers complied with all Level 5
event rules, and there has been no
indication that they cut any cor
ners. If evidence emerges to the
contrary, those in charge of the
event should be held accountable.
However, it is possible that the
event's organizers followed all
event-planning guidelines faithful
ly, yet still could not prevent a
shooting from occurring. If that is
the case, then SAL should revisit its
Level 5 event policies to enhance
security measures, perhaps by
maintaining guest lists and check
ing IDs. For very large events, SAL
and University administrators
might also consider opening and
subsidizing enclosed venues like
Frost Amphitheatre that are easier
to secure than open fields or park
ing lots.
The University should explore
these options, rather than simply
cancelling community events like
Blackfest, because they provide a
great deal of value to our campus. It
brings together thousands of mem
bers of the Bay Area community,
from big-name artists to campus
organizations. Such events facili
tate our interaction with members
of the local community and the
broader world. It is unfortunate
that Saturday evening's violence
overshadows these benefits to the
Stanford community, and it would
be an overreaction to withdraw
support of such events in the future.
While we cannot abide by such vio
lence, neither can we permit con
cern over safety to morph into a

ban on large community events.
Communication with the public
during a violent incident is another
opportunity for improvement. The
vast majority of students learned
about the incident from a series of
text messages sent out on Saturday
evening. The AlertSU system is a
powerful tool, but its current itera
tion falls short in two respects.
First, message alerts are often
released an hour or more after an
incident occurs, which is far too late
if the goal is to redirect students
away from potentially dangerous
environments or situations. Alerts
should be sent as soon as possible
to warn students and to ensure
their safety. One likely cause of this
delay is the time it takes to gather
descriptive information about the
individual(s) responsible. This is
unhelpful, however, as the text
alert's primary function is to identi
fy the location and nature of the
crime. For students, knowing that
shots were fired near the Lagunita
parking lot would have been suffi
cient for them to avoid the threat. A
physical description, on the other
hand, is useful only in tracking the
suspect, a function that is the sole
responsibility of law enforcement.
By removing superfluous informa
tion from text alerts, the authorities
can provide students with informa
tion that is timely and thus action
able.
Second, AlertSU should avoid
descriptions such as "dark-skinned
male" that can lead students to
view large portions of the popula
tion and perhaps their own
classmates with unwarranted
suspicion. Even if minority stu
dents are not treated differently by
their peers in the face of such mes
sages, the alerts can have negative
psychological impacts. Knowing
that they match a vaguely worded
description of a suspect frequently
leads to the feeling that others are
watching them or are suspicious of
their actions. Furthermore, the re
minder of culturally-reinforced
links between racial and ethnic mi
norities and criminal activity has
been proven to negatively impact
self-esteem, an individual's feeling
of belonging, and other aspects of
mental health.

Descriptions of suspects are
clearly useful in some cases, and we
do not believe that police officers
should omit them entirely. But such
descriptions should only be sent if
they are specific enough to impli-

cate individuals rather than entire
ethnic groups.
Finally, we encourage students
to reflect on your reaction to Sat
urday's incident, both immediately
after hearing the news and later
on, as your thoughts and feelings
evolved. Talk with friends about
your reaction and your under
standing of the situation. We rarely
have the chance to raise the level
of discourse on campus regarding
race, class, and our perception of
peers. These issues are important
to explore while the incident is still
salient for many of us.

As students and administrators
continue to analyze what hap
pened last weekend, we should
work to ensure that our campus is
safe and that such an incident does
not happen again. But we must re
member that this is also an oppor
tunity to learn how people of dif
ferent races, backgrounds and
viewpoints understand an event
that has affected each and every
student on our campus.
