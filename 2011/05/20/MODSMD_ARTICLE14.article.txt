# MARKS MY WORDS
## Hear We Go Again 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
It was past midnight as I sat with a
friend at the 24-hour Fed-
Ex/Kinko's, sharing a King Size
Kit-Kat bar. We reminisced, as sen
iors are wont to do, about how we
met. "Let's see. I used to talk to [in
sert name of mutual friend] all the
time because he was a really good
listener. So I kept dropping by his
room, we became friends, then I
guess I met you through him."
Back up though a person who
is "good at listening?" Interesting.
It's a quality we sometimes forget
about in the assortment of adjec
tives that we typically use to de
scribe people. We often revert to the
mundane adjectives: words like
"nice" or "funny" or "easygoing"
(known as "chill" in the vernacular).
Describing a person as a good listen
er reaches a whole new level of artic
ulateness. But really, when was the
last time you described someone as
"nice"? Okay. Now, when was the
last time you described a friend as "a
good listener?" Right.
In any case, people rarely are de
scribed as good listeners, and yet
good listeners are pretty important
people. You like talking to a good lis

tener when you have something to
share, and we all have things to
share.
Don't believe me? Start by iden
tifying that one friend you have on
Facebook whose wall is a long col
lection of things that he/she shares
news stories, funny You Tube
videos or pictures of cute animals.
Maybe this person goes so far as to
like their own links and add com
ments to them. That's one extreme.
You get the idea.
Our desire to share isn't only lim
ited to technological means. Maybe
you have a friend who takes advan
tage of the "Let's Talk About Any
thing" campaign on campus, a group
of students who sit in public areas
with the namesake signs, welcoming
anyone to come and engage them in
conversation. Or maybe you have a

friend who calls their parents every
day because, let's be honest, one of
our parents' primary obligations is
to listen to us complain.
Of course, there's more to shar
ing something than just sharing it. If
you could talk to a wall and feel
good about it, you would. You
wouldn't need to post things on
Facebook or talk to the stranger
with a sign sitting in White Plaza.
But not many of us would feel satis
fied conversing with a wall because
most of the satisfaction we derive
from sharing is in the response you
get when you share something.
In the same way that you want to
see the "likes" pop up on your Face
book post or a thread of comments
develop on that link you just shared,
you want the person with whom
you're speaking in person to re
spond to you. That's what makes a
good listener: you can see them ab
sorbing everything you say, process
ing it and reacting to it.
What makes a bad listener? Last
week I caught up with someone
frustrated with one of her friends.

"Whenever I'm in his room talking
to him, he's always checking his
phone or staring at the computer.
It's really frustrating."
It's true, the technology sur
rounding us has made bad listening
even easier to do. Think about the
last time you hung out with a bunch
of friends who all pulled out an
iPhone and started checking you in
at the restaurant or playing Angry
Birds. That's right you just
weren't as interesting as Angry
Birds. How does that make you
feel?!

Still, you're not safe even when
your friend isn't armed with an
iPhone. The other day, after a rough
night in which I got maybe three
hours of fitful sleep in between
tending to a distraught friend, I ran
into one of my old roommates at a
cafe, where I was feverishly adding
sugar to a large coffee.
Now, I'm willing to bet that when
most of us are in the mindset of
"omgs, my life sucks right now," we
like to tell people about it. We love a
good vent, a chance to complain, an
opportunity for self-pity.
My friend saw me and enthusias
tically asked, "How's your day
going!" How was my day going?
"Terribly. I barely got any sleep, and
one of my friends is really upset
right now."
What would you do if your
friend said this to you? Hopefully
you're thinking that you'd ask what
was wrong. You'd ask if you could
help. You'd ask something you'd
react. Ideally.
So when my friend's response
was, "Oh that's good, well anyway ..
. " followed by a launch into some
thing completely unrelated and per-

taining entirely to her, I was pretty
irritated. I might as well have been
talking to a wall, although at least a
wall couldn't have started talking
about itself.
And this little interchange got
me thinking. There's a kid who lives
down the hall in my dorm, and he
prefaces 75 percent of what he says
with, "Listen! Listen." Whether he
wants to get my attention or we're
already deep in conversation, he
uses this phrase indiscriminately. I
used to mock him I'd say in re
sponse, "Listening! Listening." But I
have a greater appreciation for it
now. When he asks me to listen, I
will.

Miriam will listen to any comments
you have. Send them over to mel

That's what makes
a good listener:
you can see them
absorbing
everything you
say, processing it
and
reacting to it.
