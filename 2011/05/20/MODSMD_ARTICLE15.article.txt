# OBSESSIVE KOMPULSION
## Synthetic Synthesis? 
### Kristian Bailey 
My last few columns have
been more somber than I'd
imagined when I first envi
sioned "Obsessive Kompulsion."
Originally, the plan was to look at a
different one of my many tics each
week, leading in with a fun repre
sentative anecdote, expanding on
the broader implications of said tic
and ending with a message along
the lines of "yes, I'm 'special' (in the
sense that I do very weird things),
and I like myself because of those
'special' things." Column number
one ran this way it was about my
hoarding of memories but num
ber two took a turn for the dark
side, about my fear of flying and
mortality as sparked by 9/11, and
the most recent ones have dealt in
part with escapism, stress, existen

tialism, homesickness and depres
sion.
The trick with these recent
pieces (and with my original col
umn idea) is to write in such away
that I don't actually seem obsessive
compulsive or depressed. In each
case, my goal has been to express
thoughts and experiences that we
don't often share, in hopes that oth
ers will in turn continue the dia
logue ideally among individuals,
but at the least within the individual
him- or herself. Understanding that
what I write is permanent, my open
ness is an attempt to improve the
"Stanford Duck Syndrome," to
show that it is okay and even
healthy to give vent to what goes on
in our minds beyond the surface of
our "Lake Stanford."

If you couldn't tell already, I
don't have a column topic for this
week, so I am using this time and
space to reflect on my work thus far.
Looking back on this volume, I've
written one piece about SLE, three
lighthearted "cutesy" pieces about
why I love life at Stanford and seven
now eight pieces that deal
with my deeper personal develop
ment and experience. Within these
11 columns, I seem to jump between
extremes of "Yay, life is great!" and
"Ahh, life is horrible!"
This year and in particular
this quarter has been a whirl
wind; my mind has been stretched
in ways I could have never imag
ined.
One of my best friends accurate
ly summed up my experience this

year: to paraphrase, freshman year
is a dialectic with fall quarter as
the thesis (life is great) and winter
quarter as the antithesis (life is hor
rible), spring quarter becomes the
synthesis (life as something in be
tween great and horrible). In the
same way, applying this dialectic to
my own self has been useful this
week: I am not perfect and cannot
be perfect, but I am not worthless (if
you'll allow "worthless" to be the
antithesis of perfect in this duck's
mind), nor will I ever be. The syn
thesis of this dialectic is that I am
something in between: I am human.
I expressed concern last week
over what it means to be human, in
relation to machines and artificial
intelligence: are we just really com
plex machines? [or even simple ma

chines? (Machines in the sense that
our brains are "computers" in the
most literal sense of the term and
that we follow basic laws of na
ture,)] From this arose questions of
consciousness how do we each
experience the world and is it possi
ble to agree on an objective reality,
given our subjectivities? ques
tions of free will and questions of
human purpose.
This week, I've been struggling
with how humans possess such ca
pacities for violence and evil. We
studied the Holocaust in SLE this
