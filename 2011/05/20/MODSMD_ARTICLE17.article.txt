## Another Whalen hitting his stride 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's a refrain made popular by a handful of recent
Stanford football players: as recruits, they weren't seri
ously considering the Cardinal until they made their
trek to the Farm. Then Stanford skyrocketed to the top
of their list.

Griff Whalen was no exception. The Ohio native's
focus was on the Midwest until his visit, but after meet
ing with then-coach Jim Harbaugh, he was sold. But
unlike most of his teammates, he could not cushion the
distance from home with a scholarship offer if he
wanted to play for the Cardinal, he would have to walk
on.
It's a daunting decision, particularly when he had in
terest from schools that could have given him a schol
arship. But the combination of Harbaugh's energy and
Stanford's recent history with walk-ons at the wide re
ceiver position made the risk (and financial invest
ment) one worth making —just the year before, Ryan
Whalen (no relation) had come to the Farm and earned
a scholarship within two weeks. He was a model Griff
could emulate.
"[Harbaugh] said I'd have a chance to compete for
playing time and a scholarship. The year before, Ryan
Whalen had earned a scholarship so obviously I knew
there was some truth to that," Griff Whalen said.
"Hearing it is one thing, but seeing that just the year be
fore a wide receiver walked on and earned a scholar
ship and started playing right away it was pretty
big."
Years later, as Griff is slated to start for the Cardinal
in 2011 and Ryan is off to the Cincinnati Bengals after
a successful Stanford career, the two Whalen's stories
are as eerily similar as their last name: recruited walk
on wide receivers that turned down opportunities at
other schools to come to Stanford and earn full-rides
and starting roles. And if it wasn't for Ryan's success
during the 2007 season, Griff may never have taken the

risk of coming to the Farm.

"It would have been a different
decision process," he said.
As it stood, Whalen's recruiting
process was quite a bit different
from any other Stanford player.
Like many, he was a multi-sport ath
lete in high school. He came from an
athletic background his great
uncle is Hall of Fame pitcher Tom
Seaver. But instead of following his
footsteps to the diamond, Whalen
played lacrosse, which does not
often cross over with football in the
same way that baseball, track or
basketball do.

"I think one, maybe two other
guys out of about 115 have played
before," he said of his Cardinal
teammates.

Whalen was so serious about the
game that while he was sending out
his football highlights, he sent out
his lacrosse reel, too. He focused on
schools where he might be able to
play both sports, like Syracuse and

Ohio State. But his options were rel
atively limited, and his attention
shifted more toward football exclu
sively and schools such as Dayton,
Western Michigan and Toledo be
fore his decision-altering visit to
Stanford.
Since matriculating, the rising se
nior's progression has been gradual:
he saw spotty time as a true fresh
man, tallied his first catches as a
sophomore and became a reliable
slot-receiver as a junior. And this
past fall, after two seasons, he was
put on scholarship.
Now, with Ryan Whalen and
Doug Baldwin graduating, Griff
Whalen has all but locked down a
starting role for 2011 opposite class
mate Chris Owusu. While Stanford
generally likes to keep position bat
tles open as long as possible, Whalen
spent the entirety of spring practice
with the first team.
"It's been pretty natural. I'm
comfortable in that role. It's good to
keep getting more reps and gain
more experience," he said.
With the starting job essentially
in hand, he's passed many of the
benchmarks he's set for himself.
"It should be every walk-on's

goal to come in and earn a spot on
the team and see how far they can
go if they can get playing time,
become a starter and earn a scholar
ship," he said. "That's everyone's
goal to work as hard you can and
see what you can do for the team."
And, in a turn of events that
takes his story full circle, he attrib
utes some of his success to his
lacrosse background. He played on
Stanford's club team as a sopho
more, and he sees the skills needed
for the two sports as somewhat in
terchangeable.
"All of the different movements
you get from it is kind of like basket
ball, trying to guard people and juke
people and evade people. I think
that translates really well and it's
hard to replicate that in the spring if
you're just training or playing base
ball," Whalen said. "It has helped
me a lot."
Griff Whalen will begin the final
chapter of his Stanford career this
fall, seeing the field for the first time
on Sept. 3 when Stanford takes on
San Jose State.

trek to the Farm. Then Stanford skyrocketed to the top
of their list.

Griff Whalen was no exception. The Ohio native's
focus was on the Midwest until his visit, but after meet
ing with then-coach Jim Harbaugh, he was sold. But
unlike most of his teammates, he could not cushion the
distance from home with a scholarship offer if he
wanted to play for the Cardinal, he would have to walk
on.
It's a daunting decision, particularly when he had in
terest from schools that could have given him a schol
arship. But the combination of Harbaugh's energy and
Stanford's recent history with walk-ons at the wide re
ceiver position made the risk (and financial invest
ment) one worth making —just the year before, Ryan
Whalen (no relation) had come to the Farm and earned
a scholarship within two weeks. He was a model Griff
could emulate.
"[Harbaugh] said I'd have a chance to compete for
playing time and a scholarship. The year before, Ryan
Whalen had earned a scholarship so obviously I knew
there was some truth to that," Griff Whalen said.
"Hearing it is one thing, but seeing that just the year be
fore a wide receiver walked on and earned a scholar
ship and started playing right away it was pretty
big."
Years later, as Griff is slated to start for the Cardinal
in 2011 and Ryan is off to the Cincinnati Bengals after
a successful Stanford career, the two Whalen's stories
are as eerily similar as their last name: recruited walk
on wide receivers that turned down opportunities at
other schools to come to Stanford and earn full-rides
and starting roles. And if it wasn't for Ryan's success
during the 2007 season, Griff may never have taken the

risk of coming to the Farm.

"It would have been a different
decision process," he said.
As it stood, Whalen's recruiting
process was quite a bit different
from any other Stanford player.
Like many, he was a multi-sport ath
lete in high school. He came from an
athletic background his great
uncle is Hall of Fame pitcher Tom
Seaver. But instead of following his
footsteps to the diamond, Whalen
played lacrosse, which does not
often cross over with football in the
same way that baseball, track or
basketball do.

"I think one, maybe two other
guys out of about 115 have played
before," he said of his Cardinal
teammates.

Whalen was so serious about the
game that while he was sending out
his football highlights, he sent out
his lacrosse reel, too. He focused on
schools where he might be able to
play both sports, like Syracuse and

Ohio State. But his options were rel
atively limited, and his attention
shifted more toward football exclu
sively and schools such as Dayton,
Western Michigan and Toledo be
fore his decision-altering visit to
Stanford.
Since matriculating, the rising se
nior's progression has been gradual:
he saw spotty time as a true fresh
man, tallied his first catches as a
sophomore and became a reliable
slot-receiver as a junior. And this
past fall, after two seasons, he was
put on scholarship.
Now, with Ryan Whalen and
Doug Baldwin graduating, Griff
Whalen has all but locked down a
starting role for 2011 opposite class
mate Chris Owusu. While Stanford
generally likes to keep position bat
tles open as long as possible, Whalen
spent the entirety of spring practice
with the first team.
"It's been pretty natural. I'm
comfortable in that role. It's good to
keep getting more reps and gain
more experience," he said.
With the starting job essentially
in hand, he's passed many of the
benchmarks he's set for himself.
"It should be every walk-on's

goal to come in and earn a spot on
the team and see how far they can
go if they can get playing time,
become a starter and earn a scholar
ship," he said. "That's everyone's
goal to work as hard you can and
see what you can do for the team."
And, in a turn of events that
takes his story full circle, he attrib
utes some of his success to his
lacrosse background. He played on
Stanford's club team as a sopho
more, and he sees the skills needed
for the two sports as somewhat in
terchangeable.
"All of the different movements
you get from it is kind of like basket
ball, trying to guard people and juke
people and evade people. I think
that translates really well and it's
hard to replicate that in the spring if
you're just training or playing base
ball," Whalen said. "It has helped
me a lot."
Griff Whalen will begin the final
chapter of his Stanford career this
fall, seeing the field for the first time
on Sept. 3 when Stanford takes on
San Jose State.
