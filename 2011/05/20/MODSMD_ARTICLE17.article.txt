## Another Whalen hitting his stride 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's a refrain made popular by a handful of recent
Stanford football players: as recruits, they weren't seri
ously considering the Cardinal until they made their
trek to the Farm. Then Stanford skyrocketed to the top
of their list.

Griff Whalen was no exception. The Ohio native's
focus was on the Midwest until his visit, but after meet
ing with then-coach Jim Harbaugh, he was sold. But
unlike most of his teammates, he could not cushion the
distance from home with a scholarship offer if he
wanted to play for the Cardinal, he would have to walk
on.
It's a daunting decision, particularly when he had in
terest from schools that could have given him a schol
arship. But the combination of Harbaugh's energy and
Stanford's recent history with walk-ons at the wide re
ceiver position made the risk (and financial invest
ment) one worth making â€”just the year before, Ryan
Whalen (no relation) had come to the Farm and earned
a scholarship within two weeks. He was a model Griff
could emulate.
"[Harbaugh] said I'd have a chance to compete for
playing time and a scholarship. The year before, Ryan
Whalen had earned a scholarship so obviously I knew
there was some truth to that," Griff Whalen said.
"Hearing it is one thing, but seeing that just the year be
fore a wide receiver walked on and earned a scholar
ship and started playing right away it was pretty
big."
Years later, as Griff is slated to start for the Cardinal
in 2011 and Ryan is off to the Cincinnati Bengals after
a successful Stanford career, the two Whalen's stories
are as eerily similar as their last name: recruited walk
on wide receivers that turned down opportunities at
other schools to come to Stanford and earn full-rides
and starting roles. And if it wasn't for Ryan's success
during the 2007 season, Griff may never have taken the

top targets for redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck heading into next season.
