## Stanford extends football series with Notre Dame through 2019 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
Stanford Athletics Director Bob
Bowlsby announced Thursday that
Stanford's football series with
Notre Dame would continue
through the 2019 season, extending
the home-and-home format that
began 14 years ago.
The 2011 game, scheduled for
November 26 at Stanford Stadium,
will be the 26th contest between the
two perennial powers, with the
Fighting Irish holding a 17-8 all
time advantage. But the Cardinal
has taken the last two contests, in

eluding a 37-14 thrashing on the
road in South Bend, Ind.
With the return of last year's
Heisman trophy runner-up, red
shirt junior Andrew Luck, Stanford
will look to build on the program's
recent success with new head coach
David Shaw when the season kicks
off in September.
