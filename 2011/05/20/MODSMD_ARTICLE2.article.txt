## CARD DEFEATS TEXAS A&M, MOVES TO ELITE 8 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the end of three hours of emotional tennis
and an extraordinarily long rally, Stanford jun
ior Bradley Klahn fell to his knees and let out
a scream after Texas A&M's Austin Krajice's
forehand clipped the top of the net and landed
out. Klahn had capped off his team's come
back victory and the Stanford men's tennis
team advanced to the NCAA Tournament
quarterfinals. As his teammates rushed the
court to celebrate and a rowdy crowd cheered,
it was hard not to get the sense that this team
has more than a bit of magic left.
The eighth-seeded Cardinal (21-5,5-1 Pac-10)
knew that beating ninth-seeded Texas A&M

(29-6,5-1 Big-12) would be no easy task. Both
teams had been in the top ten all season and
had been playing their best tennis recently.
Stanford was riding a 12-match winning streak
and Texas A&M recently claimed the Big-12
Tournament championship.

The day started with three extremely tight
doubles matches and a boisterous crowd in the
stands to match the action on the court.
Sophomores Matt Kandath and Denis Lin
struck first for Stanford winning their

match 8-6 as both of the other two matches
were about to go the Cardinal's way. A&M
kept sticking around, though, and eventually
won the No. 3 doubles match, 8-6, despite a
large crowd rooting on the Stanford duo of
freshman Jamin Ball and senior Alex Clayton.
The doubles point came down to an incredible
match at the top slot.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team of juniors Klahn
and Ryan Thacher was ranked third in the
country, which set up a key matchup with
Texas A&M's squad of Austin Krajice and Jeff
Dadamo, who were ranked fourth. The sun
was out and the stands were full to witness one
of the highest-caliber doubles matches of the

MEN'S TENNIS
TEXAS A&M 2

season. In a back-and-forth affair
where each team managed to break
only once, the match came down to
a tiebreak. At 5-5, it seemed like it
could go either way and Stanford
had a match point at 7-6, but the
Aggies ended up securing a 10-8
victory in the tiebreak and earning
their team the doubles point.
Stanford had won the doubles point
in all but one of its matches in the
current winning streak (and that
lone loss came in a Klahn-less 6-1
victory at San Francisco), so head
coach John Whitlinger had to be
more than a little worried about his
team's chances. The crowd was a bit
deflated and as the warm after
noon turned into a chilly night, one

had to wonder if the Cardinal could
win four of the six singles matches
they needed to take the match.
But Stanford started singles play
with a bang. Kandath and Clayton
controlled both of their matches to
earn two quick points for the team
right off the bat. The Aggies man
aged to strike back at the No. 6 spot
to make it 2-2, but Thacher won his
match to put Stanford up 3-2. It was
up to Klahn to redeem his earlier
loss and he came through, out
lasting Krajice to seal the match for
the Card.
When asked what made the differ
ence Thursday night, Ball acknowl
edged the crowd and the high ener
gy of the match were on the players'
minds and in their ears.
"The crowd was awesome," Ball
said. "The energy was unreal and it
helped a lot. Everyone's excited to
do it again on Saturday."
Stanford now has a 13-match win

streak and is 16-1 at home. The Car
dinal's versatility as a team was
showcased once again on Thursday,
as the team was able to win despite
losing the doubles point, perhaps
the one component the team had
been able to rely on all season. But
Stanford will need all of that and
more tomorrow as it moves to the
Elite Eight.
The Card's next opponent is No. 1
Virginia (33-0,11-0 ACC).The Cav
aliers are undefeated, having blown
everyone they have played out of
the water this season and never let
ting any opponent win more than
two matches. Last night, they
blanked Illinois 4-0 after Stanford's
win. A bid to the semifinals will be
on the line when the match starts at
6 p.m. tomorrow night at Taube
Tennis Center.

helped a lot. Everyone's excited to
do it again on Saturday."
Stanford now has a 13-match win

streak and is 16-1 at home. The Car
dinal's versatility as a team was
showcased once again on Thursday,
as the team was able to win despite
losing the doubles point, perhaps
the one component the team had
been able to rely on all season. But
Stanford will need all of that and
more tomorrow as it moves to the
Elite Eight.
The Card's next opponent is No. 1
Virginia (33-0,11-0 ACC).The Cav
aliers are undefeated, having blown
everyone they have played out of
the water this season and never let
ting any opponent win more than
two matches. Last night, they
blanked Illinois 4-0 after Stanford's
win. A bid to the semifinals will be
on the line when the match starts at
6 p.m. tomorrow night at Taube
Tennis Center.
