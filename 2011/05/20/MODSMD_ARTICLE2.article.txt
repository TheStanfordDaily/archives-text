## CARD DEFEATS TEXAS A&M, MOVES TO ELITE 8 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the end of three hours of emotional tennis
and an extraordinarily long rally, Stanford jun
ior Bradley Klahn fell to his knees and let out
a scream after Texas A&M's Austin Krajice's
forehand clipped the top of the net and landed
out. Klahn had capped off his team's come
back victory and the Stanford men's tennis
team advanced to the NCAA Tournament
quarterfinals. As his teammates rushed the
court to celebrate and a rowdy crowd cheered,
it was hard not to get the sense that this team
has more than a bit of magic left.
The eighth-seeded Cardinal (21-5,5-1 Pac-10)
knew that beating ninth-seeded Texas A&M

(29-6,5-1 Big-12) would be no easy task. Both
teams had been in the top ten all season and
had been playing their best tennis recently.
Stanford was riding a 12-match winning streak
and Texas A&M recently claimed the Big-12
Tournament championship.

The day started with three extremely tight
doubles matches and a boisterous crowd in the
stands to match the action on the court.
Sophomores Matt Kandath and Denis Lin
struck first for Stanford winning their

match 8-6 as both of the other two matches
were about to go the Cardinal's way. A&M
kept sticking around, though, and eventually
won the No. 3 doubles match, 8-6, despite a
large crowd rooting on the Stanford duo of
freshman Jamin Ball and senior Alex Clayton.
The doubles point came down to an incredible
match at the top slot.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team of juniors Klahn
and Ryan Thacher was ranked third in the
country, which set up a key matchup with
Texas A&M's squad of Austin Krajice and Jeff
Dadamo, who were ranked fourth. The sun
was out and the stands were full to witness one
of the highest-caliber doubles matches of the
