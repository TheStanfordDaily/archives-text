# Better young than never?

### Tom Taylor 
I'm not sure when it happened, but
it worries me that I seem to have
grown old somehow, and there
doesn't appear to be much I can do
about it. Suddenly all the hottest
athletic talent is younger than me.The top
picks for the NBA Draft look like they
have barely left high school, the fastest
race-car drivers surely can't be old
enough to be sitting behind the wheel on
a public highway and the biography sec
tion in my local bookstore is stuffed with
accounts from sports stars not even
halfway through their careers.
As a kid, it was easy to look up to my
sports heroes. God-given ability aside, I
was always taught to look up to my elders
(and back then I was shorter than them,
too.) Now, though, it's getting a little more
complicated. I still have my childhood he
roes, but as they retire year-by-year, I
have to turn to fresh and inevitably
younger blood. Admittedly I still have
to look up to a lot of them every single
basketball player towers above me
but it's hard to feel quite the same about
someone who was still in diapers when I
was at the peak of my sporting prowess in
high school.
A critical part in having a hero is that
you can be inspired by them and can
dream of following in their footsteps.
Every fan harbors the delusion that one
of these days, a professional scout is going
to discover their incredible throwing
arm, right foot or whatever other body
part or skill might catapult them from the
sidelines to stardom. As time passes,
though, the number of athletes' careers I
have any chance of mimicking and the
number of sports I might somehow still
be eligible for are shrinking fast.
There's always a scattering of male
and female athletes who are unwilling to
accept defeat with the loss of then youth,
but they can normally count on both seri
ous skill and a history of training and
competing at the top level. And even that
isn't always enough take Formula-1
driver Michael Schumacher for example,
I wouldn't write him off from winning
more races, but his comeback hasn't even
compare to the bar he set just a few short
years ago.
However, I can't even count on past
experience I can't claim to have ever
trained as hard as most college athletes
during my extended life at university
so I'm starting from scratch. A trip to the
gym highlights the physiological disad
vantage I face the maximum heart
rate graph seems to imply I might die if I
aim for the same intensity level as a few
years ago.
Athletes in sports requiring raw
power or speed usually peak at a younger
age, but sports that are focused more on
endurance and skill can be better suited
to the slightly older. That means that I
might still have a chance if I set my sights
differently. Football, soccer and basket
ball are out. So perhaps that means I
could focus on cycling or triathlons, or
maybe I have to turn to darts.
But if I do that, then what happens to
the sports I've followed for so long? To be
really, really good at anything, you need
the ability and concentration to shut
everything out in order to focus intently
on your goal and not get distracted.
Learning and perfecting a new sport
would consume everything. Even if I did
n't become one myself I might well find
some new heroes, but at the expense of
old ones.
Faced with the unstoppable passage
of time, what should I do? I could take the
easy way out and choose to simply ignore
the new stars, spending my time harking
back to misty-eyed memories of the good
ole days of my youth, when athletes were
real athletes and sport was pure. Perhaps
I could drop by the physics department to
see if they've made any progress on
building a time machine.
Or maybe I need to accept the hard
truth; it's time to stop dreaming I'll ever
beat these younger and better ath
letes I should be dreaming about
ordering them around instead. The
top coaches are all much older than
me and surely it's only a matter of

time before a rich team-owner real
izes my potential.

Tom Taylor might want to try the
sport of croquet, which requires little
physical prowess but does reward a
solid understanding of geometry and
physics. If not, he can always try his
hand at speed golf or beer pong. Sug
