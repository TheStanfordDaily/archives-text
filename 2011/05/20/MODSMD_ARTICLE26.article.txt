Although Intermissions been sitting around, eagerly await
ing "Born This Way" (more specifically, to see if the
allegedly "greatest album of this decade" sinks or soars),
it's clear the songstress herself has been doing anything
but. Gaga's been racking up quite a bit of hyphenates late
ly from singer-Star Wars nerd to songwriter-hat intern.
Intermission's here to chart our favorite Gaga side jobs.
James Franco better watch his back.

V Magazine Columnist
Last week, Gaga made her debut as a columnist for V maga
zine, sprinkling her writing with obscure pop culture refer
ences and fun anecdotes from her pre-fame days.

Farmville Enthusiast
Gaga has single-handedly made the most awful app on
Facebook slightly less awful. Players can visit "GagaVille" and
unlock tracks from "Born This Way" until it disappears May
26.

E Street Band Fan Girl
While folks may compare her title single to a certain Material
Girl's repertoire, Gaga's also been paying respects to the
Boss. E Street saxophonist Clarence Clemons already made
an appearance on two tracks "The Edge of Glory" and
"Hair."

Hat Intern
Vogue UK reported that Gaga applied for
an internship with hat designer Philip
Treacy, the mastermind behind 36 of the
hats worn at the Royal Wedding, including
Princess Eugenie's monstrosity.

Metro Editor in Chief
On Monday, Gaga guested as EIC of the London newspaper
but naturally showed up for work in a beehive, fishnets and
revealing brassiere top. It's safe to say Intermission prays our
own EIC never even considers trying to pull off such an outfit.
