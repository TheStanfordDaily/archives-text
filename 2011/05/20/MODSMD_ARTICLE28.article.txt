## DEFINING THE DIRECTORY 
### â€” Jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
Innovation and collaboration
seem to be the two critical
themes for Seattle indie band
The Directory.
"We're trying to be uniquely
creative but still palatable for peo
ple," said lead singer Caleb Buse.
"We're trying to create songs that
people could enjoy just from hear
ing it for the first time, while also
bringing something new to the
table hopefully, though that's easi
er said than done."

The Directory was formed
when frontman Caleb Buse was
"getting frustrated" that the musi
cians he would play with lacked
similar motivation to be produc
tive and decided to start his own

project. After meeting guitarist
Tyler Cutforth and a drummer
who Buse thought was "really
great" but has since moved to
Korea to teach English (the current
drummer for the band is Dan

Dartnall), The Directory was
formed.
"I focus on my thing, and
they focus on their thing, and real
cool stuff comes out of it," Buse
said. "It's not like one person dic
tates the direction ... it's real col
laboration."

Cutforth, as Buse describes
him, is "super creative. He thinks
outside of the box when it comes
to guitar melodies," while Dartnall,
who Buse calls "a really great poet,"
has collaborated with Buse on

lyrics for the band's three newest
songs, which they debuted on their
recent trip down the coast and
played last night at the CoHo.
Buse himself lays down the foun
dation for the band, with piano
and vocals.
The Directory decided to
come to the CoHo after Buse

spoke with friend Stephanie

Werner 'll, who recommended
the venue. Having played at the
Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles, a hot
spot for gigs, The Directory was
excited to check out Stanford's
campus; the band has played gigs
mostly in their hometown of
Seattle. Buse describes the Seattle
music scene as "burgeoning."
"In the last half a year, things
have started coming together
there's a great music scene in
Seattle right now. Nationally,
there's some really cool acts com
ing out like Fleet Foxes and The
Head and the Heart," Buse said.
"It's really inspiring to see all these
really great bands coming out of
Seattle, and it's been really good to
connect with some of them it
