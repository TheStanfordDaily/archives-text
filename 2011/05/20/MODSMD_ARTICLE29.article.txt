## BAKLAVA IS AN ABSOLUTE TREAT 
### â€” josh GLUCOFT contact josh: glucoft@stanford. edu 
In Palo Alto alone, there are
approximately 100 full-serv
ice restaurants and about 90
more limited-service establish
ments. Sometimes, though, it
seems like they are all
Mediterranean or Middle
Eastern. There are simply so
many places serving falafel or

similar fare that it is easy to feel overwhelmed. Baklava,
however, stands out from the crowd with its incredible
Turkish cuisine.
The restaurant's decor effuses a strong cultural identity
without being kitschy or sacrificing too much formality.
The atmosphere works well for a long lunch or a somewhat
nicer but low-pressure dinner with close friends.
Baklava cooks its meat expertly. The chunks of lamb in
the Kuzu Kebab are mouth-watering and perfectly tender,
and the chicken of the Tavuk Shish Kebab is juicy and
seared with just the right amount of char to evoke feelings
of an open fire without making the outside too bitter or
dry. The grilled peppers partitioning the slices of meat are
delectably savory; likewise, the eggplant in the Karniyarik
melts away perfectly. However, the ground beef in the
Karniyarik is not quite as exciting as the other carnivorous
options. Neither the rice pilaf nor the grilled potatoes and
carrots that accompany these grilled dishes particularly
stand out in terms of flavor; the rice, especially, is under
whelming. Still, they frame the dish well aesthetically and
can provide a nice interlude between the pieces of meat.
Baklava also features a rotating roster of specialties that
are generally fantastic. The Swordfish Special, for example,
is cooked perfectly. The fish has a robust yet smooth texture
that makes it a substantial and delicious option. The Yogurt
Kabob Special is perhaps a bit weaker. The lamb comes in a

tzatziki sauce that is some
what flat, but the meat pick
up the slack and saves the
dish. The only real disap
pointment is that these
' dishes are not permanent
fixtures on the menu.
On top of these
specialties, Baklava does not

forget its roots and manages to deliver exceptional cuisine
even with the basics. The falafel appetizer is spot on. The
falafel has a wonderfully light crispiness to encase its creamy
filling, which has just the right amount of spicy kick Even
the complimentary pita is satisfying and comes with a phe
nomenal sundried tomato spread that by itself justifies a
visit to the restaurant. And of course, the baklava dessert
does not disappoint. The beautiful layers of phyllo rest on
an absolutely scrumptious base of pistachios and walnuts
with a touch of honey, producing an unforgettable dessert.
Not everything at Baklava is flawless. The Fish
Sandwich, for example, is simply boring. The dish is remi
niscent of cioppino in sandwich form, but the transforma
tion isn't entirely successful. Also, the classic dolma is actual
ly fairly decent, but the flavor is sometimes drowned by the
accompanying yogurt sauce; asking for it on the side may
be a good idea.
There are a dizzying array of restaurants in the area
falling somewhere at the intersection of North African,
Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine. There are only
a few, however, that provide the type of fare worth return
ing for. Baklava is such an establishment, and it is "definitely
worth trying."
