After a long midweek layoff in light of bad
weather, Stanford baseball hosts Arizona
tonight to kick off a three-game set that could
help either squad break from the middle of the
Pac-10.
The No. 25 Cardinal (28-18,10-11 Pac-10) sits
a game behind the No. 27 Wildcats (32-17,11-
10) for fifth in the conference, hoping to find its
rhythm after a tough series loss to Oregon last
weekend. On the tail end of a six-game win
streak, Stanford dropped two of three to the
Ducks before its Tuesday game against San
Francisco was canceled due to rain.
Stanford had been nearly perfect in mid
week games with an 11-1 record, so the squad
will have to find new ways to get back its win
ning touch.
"I don't think it's going to throw us off any
kind of rhythm," said junior reliever A.J. Talt.
