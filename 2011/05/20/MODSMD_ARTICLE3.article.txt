## Seeking a spark at Sunken 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
After a long midweek layoff in light of bad
weather, Stanford baseball hosts Arizona
tonight to kick off a three-game set that could
help either squad break from the middle of the
Pac-10.
The No. 25 Cardinal (28-18,10-11 Pac-10) sits
a game behind the No. 27 Wildcats (32-17,11-
10) for fifth in the conference, hoping to find its
rhythm after a tough series loss to Oregon last
weekend. On the tail end of a six-game win
streak, Stanford dropped two of three to the
Ducks before its Tuesday game against San
Francisco was canceled due to rain.
Stanford had been nearly perfect in mid
week games with an 11-1 record, so the squad
will have to find new ways to get back its win
ning touch.
"I don't think it's going to throw us off any
kind of rhythm," said junior reliever A.J. Talt.
"We had a tough series against
Oregon, but I don't think that an
extra day is going to have a big ef
fect on this weekend at all."

The Cardinal has been hovering
near the periphery of the national
rankings due to mid-season strug
gles, but with only two weeks left,
Stanford can still finish first or
last in the wide-open Pac-10.
Ascending to the conference
championship will be a stretch, re
quiring (among other things) a 6-0
finish for the Cardinal and an 0-6
finish for frontrunner Oregon
State, which is ranked second in the
country and without a series loss on
the season. But Stanford closes the
regular season with series against
the two teams it has the best chance
to leapfrog: Arizona and fourth
place Cal, a squad that's only two
games ahead of the Cardinal. Also
looking to move up is USC, cur
rently sharing the sixth spot with
Stanford despite a troubling 10-16
record outside of conference play.
At any rate, the Pac-10 is bound
to have a tight finish for a second
consecutive year. In 2010, only four
games separated the third and
ninth place teams, with Stanford
landing in fourth and eight teams
moving on to the postseason. Due
to its relative competitiveness, the
Pac-10 will likely send teams to the
NCAA Tournament with confer
ence records below .500, but the
Cardinal still needs to finish strong
ly — the one-game difference be
tween eighth and ninth place kept
Washington out of a regional last
season.
A series win this weekend would
secure at least an eighth-place finish
for Stanford. Though the Cardinal
has won seven of its last nine games,
the Wildcats are on an even hotter
run, taking eight of nine while
outscoring opponents by a com
bined score of 86-29.
Stanford's pitching staff has one
of its toughest tasks of the season
ahead of it. Last weekend in Eu
gene, Cardinal hurlers never gave
up more than two runs in an inning,
but the Ducks found hitting
throughout their order and were
able to score 20 times in the series.
"I think we just [need to] con-

centrate on the basics," Talt said.
"[Pitching coach Rusty] Filter is al
ways talking to the pitchers about
getting the first guy out of every in
ning ... simple goals are much eas
ier to accomplish, so we shouldn't
try to complicate things and think
too much."
Arizona's lineup will be just as
formidable as Oregon's, if not
more so. Leading the Pac-10 in
hitting at .326, Arizona has scored
in the double digits 18 times this
season. The Wildcats' top five bat
ters are all hitting better than .333
and have each started in all of Ari
zona's 49 games.
That's a far cry from Stanford's
offensive weaponry, which has been
juggled all year in hopes of finding
consistency at the plate. Only soph
omore third baseman Stephen Pis
co tty and senior catcher Zach Jones
have appeared in every contest for
the Cardinal, and Piscotty's .365 bat
ting average is the only mark above
.320 amongst Stanford starters.
Emerging as another source of fire
power has been sophomore center

fielder Tyler Gaffney, who led Stan
ford with seven hits against Oregon
last weekend and is second only to
Piscotty with a .418 on-base percent
age.
But runs will be at a premium
for the Cardinal in this series
thanks to an Arizona rotation that
deserves much of the credit for the
Wildcats' recent success. After his
fourth complete game of the year
last Saturday against Washington
State, junior Kyle Simon was
named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week.
Simon and Friday starter sopho
more Kurt Heyer both boast ERAs
below 2.75, a mark equaled by no
Stanford pitchers who have made
more than five appearances.
Despite Arizona's edge on
paper, Stanford has the upper hand
in at least one key area: home-field
advantage. The Cardinal is 16-5 at
Sunken Diamond this year, while
the Wildcats are just 8-11 on the
road.
Tonight's 5:30 p.m. start at
Sunken Diamond will be followed
by two 1:00 p.m. matinees on Satur
day and Sunday.

NOTES ! Arizona comes to the Farm for a
critical three-game set as conference play
winds down. The No. 25 Cardinal had a
tough time of it last weekend in Oregon,
dropping two of three games to the
Ducks. Sophomore righthander Mark

Appel will get the ball and try to win Stan
ford's 1 7th home game this year against
just five losses.

The No. 25 baseball team needs to regain the momentum it had before
last weekend's series loss at Oregon if it is to find its footing in a packed
Pac-10 field. With just six conference games remaining, the Cardinal trails
Arizona by a game and sits in a tie for sixth place.
After a long midweek layoff in light of bad
weather, Stanford baseball hosts Arizona
tonight to kick off a three-game set that could
help either squad break from the middle of the
Pac-10.
The No. 25 Cardinal (28-18,10-11 Pac-10) sits
a game behind the No. 27 Wildcats (32-17,11-
10) for fifth in the conference, hoping to find its
rhythm after a tough series loss to Oregon last
weekend. On the tail end of a six-game win
streak, Stanford dropped two of three to the
Ducks before its Tuesday game against San
Francisco was canceled due to rain.
Stanford had been nearly perfect in mid
week games with an 11-1 record, so the squad
will have to find new ways to get back its win
ning touch.
"I don't think it's going to throw us off any
kind of rhythm," said junior reliever A.J. Talt.
"We had a tough series against
Oregon, but I don't think that an
extra day is going to have a big ef
fect on this weekend at all."

The Cardinal has been hovering
near the periphery of the national
rankings due to mid-season strug
gles, but with only two weeks left,
Stanford can still finish first or
last in the wide-open Pac-10.
Ascending to the conference
championship will be a stretch, re
quiring (among other things) a 6-0
finish for the Cardinal and an 0-6
finish for frontrunner Oregon
State, which is ranked second in the
country and without a series loss on
the season. But Stanford closes the
regular season with series against
the two teams it has the best chance
to leapfrog: Arizona and fourth
place Cal, a squad that's only two
games ahead of the Cardinal. Also
looking to move up is USC, cur
rently sharing the sixth spot with
Stanford despite a troubling 10-16
record outside of conference play.
At any rate, the Pac-10 is bound
to have a tight finish for a second
consecutive year. In 2010, only four
games separated the third and
ninth place teams, with Stanford
landing in fourth and eight teams
moving on to the postseason. Due
to its relative competitiveness, the
Pac-10 will likely send teams to the
NCAA Tournament with confer
ence records below .500, but the
Cardinal still needs to finish strong
ly — the one-game difference be
tween eighth and ninth place kept
Washington out of a regional last
season.
A series win this weekend would
secure at least an eighth-place finish
for Stanford. Though the Cardinal
has won seven of its last nine games,
the Wildcats are on an even hotter
run, taking eight of nine while
outscoring opponents by a com
bined score of 86-29.
Stanford's pitching staff has one
of its toughest tasks of the season
ahead of it. Last weekend in Eu
gene, Cardinal hurlers never gave
up more than two runs in an inning,
but the Ducks found hitting
throughout their order and were
able to score 20 times in the series.
"I think we just [need to] con-

centrate on the basics," Talt said.
"[Pitching coach Rusty] Filter is al
ways talking to the pitchers about
getting the first guy out of every in
ning ... simple goals are much eas
ier to accomplish, so we shouldn't
try to complicate things and think
too much."
Arizona's lineup will be just as
formidable as Oregon's, if not
more so. Leading the Pac-10 in
hitting at .326, Arizona has scored
in the double digits 18 times this
season. The Wildcats' top five bat
ters are all hitting better than .333
and have each started in all of Ari
zona's 49 games.
That's a far cry from Stanford's
offensive weaponry, which has been
juggled all year in hopes of finding
consistency at the plate. Only soph
omore third baseman Stephen Pis
co tty and senior catcher Zach Jones
have appeared in every contest for
the Cardinal, and Piscotty's .365 bat
ting average is the only mark above
.320 amongst Stanford starters.
Emerging as another source of fire
power has been sophomore center

fielder Tyler Gaffney, who led Stan
ford with seven hits against Oregon
last weekend and is second only to
Piscotty with a .418 on-base percent
age.
But runs will be at a premium
for the Cardinal in this series
thanks to an Arizona rotation that
deserves much of the credit for the
Wildcats' recent success. After his
fourth complete game of the year
last Saturday against Washington
State, junior Kyle Simon was
named Pac-10 Pitcher of the Week.
Simon and Friday starter sopho
more Kurt Heyer both boast ERAs
below 2.75, a mark equaled by no
Stanford pitchers who have made
more than five appearances.
Despite Arizona's edge on
paper, Stanford has the upper hand
in at least one key area: home-field
advantage. The Cardinal is 16-5 at
Sunken Diamond this year, while
the Wildcats are just 8-11 on the
road.
Tonight's 5:30 p.m. start at
Sunken Diamond will be followed
by two 1:00 p.m. matinees on Satur
day and Sunday.
