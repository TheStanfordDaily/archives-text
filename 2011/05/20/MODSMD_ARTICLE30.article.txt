## ROBBER BARONS DELIVERS LAUGHS WITH 'PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE' 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Many jokes seem to be
overdone in comedy
sketches awkward
first dates, middle school parties
and the like leaving viewers frus
trated that they didn't spend those
10 dollars on food or perhaps a
nice margarita. Two things are for
tunate about the Stanford Robber
Barons' spring show: first, it's free
to students, and second, they avoid
any inanity with considerable suc
cess.
The 11-person sketch comedy
group's spring show is entitled
"Robber Barons: Passive
Aggressive," and though the title
doesn't seem to have anything to do
with the show, it is certainly worth
seeing. It began immediately after I
arrived, as Carlo Pasco 'l3 greeted
the viewers in a pair of boxers and a
70s mustache, assuring them, "I
usually look like this." An hour and
15 minutes of hilariousness ensued,
as the lights went up to reveal two
wig-donning lords feigning
grandiose accents and giving each
other dainty chest bumps.

"Passive Aggressive" runs
through over a dozen sketches in its
allotted time, which of course
means that it touches on over a
dozen random topics in that short
period. What makes the Robber
Barons so successful, though, is that
they cater to their audience
Stanford students using topics
such as Bing Overseas Study
Program interviews, the "bro" life
and hippie teachers, while, of
course, sticking to the politically
incorrect topics such as illegal
immigration and starving children
in Africa. The Robber Barons, how
ever, do a great job of turning those
entirely inappropriate topics, such
as "editing your Facebook profile
picture to make people think you
care about other cultures," as well as
seemingly random ones (including
a confrontation between a knight
and troll in a video game) into the
most hysterical skits.
A particularly stand-out sketch
was a scene from a PWR 2 class,

where an overly eager and delightfully
awkward student (Ellen Cerf'll)
gives a presentation on Britney
Spears, taking most of her speech to
closely analyze some of her biggest
hits. The best sketch of the night,
though, may have been a dialogue
delivered by Josh Freedman 'll, as a
thickly accented rabbi listing off the

absurdly similar names of some of the
members of his congregation.
Though the show is somewhat of
a mixed bag of tricks, with certain
skits delivering better punchlines than
others, the overall spectacle is hilari
ous and undoubtedly worth an hour
of time. Better yet, you won't miss
dinner.

"Passive Aggressive" is showing
May 19-21 at 8 p.m. in the Geology
Corner Lecture Hall 320. Tickets are
free for students and $lO for the gen
eral public.
