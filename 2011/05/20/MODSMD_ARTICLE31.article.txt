# CANNES
## THE 						GLITZ, THE GLAMOUR AND, OH YEAH, THE MOVIES 
### â€“ brady HAMED contact brady: bhamed@stanford. edu 
As I sit on the beach in the south of
France, looking at the craggy hills that
surround the bay filled with expensive
yachts and cruise ships, I realize just how
unique the Cannes experience is. I'm currently
at the prestigious, if pretentious, Cannes Film
Festival which runs for 10 days in a tiny town
on the French Riviera. This year's movie lineup
has been its most extravagant in years, from
Cannes favorites like Terrence Malick, Lars von
Trier, Pedro Almodovar and Woody Allen pep
pered throughout the week. The famous
celebrities are also making the trek across the
globe like it's the Oscars plus MTV Movie
Awards on steroids with A-listers ranging from
Kanye West to Johnny Depp to teen favorites
like Vanessa Hudgens.
However, the life of a student-journalist
here is a little less glamorous. The first barrier is
the intense hierarchy within the system. As
with most everywhere, it's more about who
you know, so stars and wealthy producers have
free reign of the festival. Next comes the press
with its own separate hierarchy of colored
badges ranging from the "Roger Ebert" white
to your unknown-blog-photographer orange.
At the lowest of the low are the film students,
struggling film producers and plain old

tourists. I was lucky enough to get a yellow
press pass, a step above orange, three below
white. Still pretty dismal, but I can attend any
screening I please... except the fancy tuxedo
required galas. For those below me, they stand
outside the Palais de Festival, the ugliest and

most important building to Cannes, for hours
on end, in tuxes and ball gowns holding tiny
signs that beg for a ticket to anything. Those
less curious about foreign films and more
intent on the stars set up camp at the sidelines
of the red carpet for as long as four hours.
I, instead, wait in long lines of up to a
mere hour for an obscure Israeli comedy,

watching the entire higher-level press saunter
through in front of me before finally getting a
seat in the back row next to a group of chatty
Italian web journalists. I actually liked the film
and am actually lucky to have gotten in at all,
but the experience is a bit absurd and tiring.
Also, to see the bigger films, all press must
attend 8:30 a.m. screenings. Try watching a
Spanish serial killer movie or a black and white
silent film at the crack of dawn on three hours
of sleep it's a character-building experience,
regardless of how enjoyable the movie is.
Fortunately, all of the journalists are in it

together. We wait in the long lines, we com
plain about the ingratiating Korean documen
taries, we praise the gutsy niche films and we
all trade stories and recommendations freely.
There is also the ever-present chance that
you'll see a celebrity. You're watching a movie
when suddenly Adrien Brody is a few rows
behind you. I even had a friend that had her
toe stepped on by Robert DeNiro like any

self-respecting Canadian, she apologized to
him. It's also definitely possible to break into
these parties. This is probably an appropriate
time to thank the editors of Indiewire and

Variety, who I have never met, but bouncers
and security will tell you that "I am with" them.
The stories from the even more exclusive par
ties get increasingly absurd, ranging from
impromptu Jamie Foxx concerts to free horse
rides around the villa. And while the drinks are
always free, no one is dancing because they're
all talking. This is a place where producers and
talent come together to meet and greet, rub
shoulders and make deals.
Without connections, I'm usually left on
the beach watching the parties happen on
exclusive yachts in the harbor or in a lavish
villa up in the hills. However, I'm perfectly
happy lounging on the beach, catching a
glimpse of Penelope Cruz or Meredith Vieira,
discovering tiny films months before they get
released in America and dressing up to get into
B-list (or C-list or D-list) party. Tonight, I'll be
watching a classic film the festival shows on the
beach under the stars along with a few of my
new journalist friends. Don't worry; you're
allowed to be jealous. I am too.
