There are three certainties when dealing
with this swashbuckling family-fun
film. Firstly, the film is going to plun
der enough pockets this weekend to have the
option for a fifth film. The "Pirates of the
Caribbean" franchise has grossed over $2.5 bil
lion worldwide. Secondly, Johnny Depp is
going to be delivering the same hilarious and
fun-drunken swagger of a performance. (It's
not a complaint, just inevitability.) And third
ly, this quasi-reboot will never live up to the
first film.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger
Tides sends Johnny Depp as Captain Jack
Sparrow on a quest for the fountain of youth.
Aiong the way, he runs into the dread pirate
Blackbeard (lan McShane) and his daughter
Angelica (Penelope Cruz). Capt. Jack and
Angelica meet under less than ideal circum
stances, as former lovers now thrown togeth
er by circumstance. Cruz holds her own in a

sexy, confident and extremely physically
demanding role. While she planned on doing
most of her own stunt work, due to her preg
nancy, her sister filled in for some of the
shoot.

As the film rollicks along, nothing feels
new or exciting. Even with new and flashier
director Rob Marshall at the helm, the movie
falls back into an eerily comfortable familiarity.

The bombastic
and inspiring
Hans Zimmer
score feels like
you never
stopped hearing

it, and the lavish sets
and Jack Sparrow's witty one-liners are
absolutely everywhere.
Where the film actually feels a little empty
is the lack of Orlando Bloom and Keira
Knightley. They grounded the film with their
outsiders' perspectives, not having been fully
indoctrinated into the pirate life until the third
installment. In this film, the romance is more
of an afterthought, and there's a hole where
Bloom and Knightley used to be.
Perhaps the biggest problem with the film
is the use of 3-D. When a film requires over
sized glasses to make cannonballs burst out of
the screen at the audience, everything always

seems about two shades darker. This isn't a
huge problem in most movies, where the
action is taking place in broad daylight against
vibrant colors. However, the majority of the
action in "On Stranger Tides" takes place at
night. Suddenly, all of the fun action is masked
in a haze of darkness. Not to mention, the 3-D
also seems to be the product of marketing
necessity, rather than any original, creative

impulses. There is never a moment where
viewers are actually excited by the effect.
Aside from a couple of ridiculous action
sequences and a few too many swings from a
chandelier, the action is constantly engaging
and thrilling. If you are a fan of the other
"Pirates of the Caribbean" movies, then you
will certainly fall for this one as well. It definite
ly is an adequate successor; however, it might

not be worth the price of the 3-D glasses.
And for those hardcore Johnny Depp/Jack
Sparrow fans, the last line is one you've been
waiting for since the first movie and feels like
the perfect ending.
