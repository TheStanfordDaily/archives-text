For cinephiles everywhere,
Terrence Malick's "The Tree of
Life" has been an event too
long in the making. After the tortur
ous wait, as the film's release was
delayed year after year, we finally live
in a world where "The Tree of Life" is
a reality.
Featuring Brad Pitt and the
soon-to-be-übiquitous Jessica

Chastain as parents during the 19505,
"The Tree of Life" loosely charts the
influence of each parent on their
children and the effect that takes.
This result is reflected as one of their
sons grows up and is played by Sean
Penn in present day. These two nar
ratives are intensely juxtaposed with
a larger macro vision of influence on
life the creation of earth. If this

sounds like it
might be dis
parate, confusing
or just plain
weird, then you're
only just starting
to understand the

unique complexity of this film. With
this, it becomes quickly evident that
there is no way to discuss or watch
this without opening up to the larger
philosophical discussions at hand,
for that is all there really is.
Malick leads the audience
through a thoroughly visual story,
reading more as a cinematic essay, or
dare I say a "text in conversation,"
than a traditional film. Wondrous
and powerful images of space, nature
and, most intriguingly, dinosaurs, are
not only sprinkled throughout the
conventional narrative, but are
woven into a 15-minute visual opera

of the creation of the universe. A
spiritual if not entirely religious over
tone is carried throughout, as the
inexorable forces of nature are pitted
against the passive yet ever powerful
notions of grace and mercy.
This tension is a repetitive
theme, as Pitt becomes the over
bearing and relentless father and
the serene Chastain the embodi
ment of grace. Fortunately, both
actors are extremely capable and
manage to create dynamic charac
ters while also working within this
more holistic framework. Their
partnership is a magical experience,
imbued with a certain spontaneity
from the director.
Much of the absolutely gor
geous film is captured as if it were a
series of memories from a childhood
possibly your own. The children
play kick-the-can in the street, they

chase their mother with a lizard
throughout the house, and it always
feels as if you knew them, were them.
The memories float ephemerally by,
and each is exploding with energy.
The same fleeting instances find a
connection with nature. The trees,
flowers, lizards, frogs and, yes, even
the dinosaurs are as much characters
in the film as Sean Penn, all con
tributing to a larger, grander message
that always seems just out of reach,
like a dream remembered too late in
the morning.
Here at the Cannes Film
Festival, "The Tree of Life" has
sparked a bit of a controversy after a
series of boos at the first screening.
Some have hated it, calling it preten-

tious and saying it values style
over substance. There is truly
more to this film than that,
but it is so visually new and
different that it's bound to
cause a discussion about the
religion, philosophy and pur
pose of cinema as a whole. For
a fun Friday night out with
friends, this may not be the
best choice. But for a film with

imagery this powerful and a
message so elusive, it deserves
to be seen in a theater with a
long coffee break afterward to
discuss and digest the scenes.
Most importantly, it deserves
to be seen, for better or for
worse.
