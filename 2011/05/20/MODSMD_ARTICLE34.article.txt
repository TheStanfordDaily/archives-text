Let's get the ridiculout plot of "Restless" right out of the
way. Enoch, (Henry Hopper, Dennis' son), has recently
lost his parents, dropped out of school, found an obses
sion with death and started hanging out at strangers' funerals.
He also now has an invisible friend named Hiroshi who is the
ghost of a Japanese Kamikaze pilot from World War 11. He's the
very definition of indie movie quirk. At one of these funerals,
he meets the terminally ill Annabel (Mia Wasikowska), his
manic-pixie dream girl. The film's directed by Gus Van Sant,
winner of the 2003 Palme d'Or for "Elephant."
Wasikowska elevates her given material into something
almost real. She delivers a finely nuanced performance and makes
her screen partner seem a thousand times better, which still isn't
saying much for Henry Hopper. Sadly, one good performance
cannot save this movie from its vintage-painted emptiness.
The movie never takes any dramatic or unexpected turns;

it ends just how it has to end, and
you are left wondering most of
the time why the ghost is a
Japanese fighter pilot.
