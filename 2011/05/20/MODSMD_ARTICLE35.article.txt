"W e Need to talk About
\/\ / Talk About
V T Kevin" is a win for fans of the origi
nal Lionel Shriver novel of the same name. The film
is great, but if you haven't yet read the book, you
might be left a little bit in the dark.
"Kevin" follows Eva (Tilda Swinton) in the
events leading up to and right after her son Kevin
(Ezra Miller) commits a Columbine-style high
school mass murder. The puzzle pieces are laid out all
through the movie, allowing you to peer directly into
Kevin's ghastly plans, completely unbeknownst to the
other characters. The movie weaves the past and
present together in an unsettling way, accentuating
the rise and fall of Eva's emotions.

Maybe that's part of the inevitability of the whole
thing. Sometimes we know what's going to happen,
and we are powerless to stop it. That's a bummer.
