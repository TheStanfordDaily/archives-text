# THE
						DARK SIDE OF L.A. NOIRE DO ROCKSTAR'S ADVANCES SACRIFICE GAMING'S ROOTS?

L.A. Noire is nothing if not ambitious. It's
clear from the outset that Team Bondi
and Rockstar have delivered the ground
breaking title they set out to develop and, as
advertised, the game admirably marries
Rockstar's traditional open-world formula with
a uniquely moody vibe and motion-capture
technology that makes for some of the most
realistic and emotive characters this side of
Pixar. I can already see this game as a sort of
"Matrix" for the medium not in its source
material or artistic flavor, but as a landmark

whose technical wizardry future
game-makers look to iterate and
improve. I suppose that was clear
enough even months ago, as L.A.

Noire's cinematic flair turned enough heads to
make it the first-ever game featured at the
Tribeca Film Festival.
Impressive to be sure, but I'm not certain
that's exactly a good thing. At least, not entirely.
I'll be the first to say that I'm having a wonder
ful time with the game, but most of what
makes L.A. Noire excellent comes not from the

way it excels in what makes
games so great, but from the
way it inches itself ever so

much closer to gaming's lifelong fetish of being
just like movies.
L.A. Noire offers an enthralling world and
story, but they aren't yours. Yes, it's technically
an open-world game and you're allowed to do
just about anything, but when Team Bondi has
clearly made its realistic characters and well
acted dialogue the game's main reward mecha
nism, there's no motivation to go off the beaten

path. Doing so, in fact, totally shatters the vibe
that L.A. Noire depends on for its immersion
the developers didn't intend for detective
Cole Phelps to sprint in circles like an idiot or
run over pedestrians in his patrol car, and the
world doesn't react to such behavior with near
ly as much realism and emotion as the charac
ters show in the game's outstanding, but pre
canned cutscenes.
If you don't agree, consider some of the
