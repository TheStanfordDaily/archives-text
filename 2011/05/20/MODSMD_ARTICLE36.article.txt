# THE 						DARK SIDE OF L.A. NOIRE DO ROCKSTAR'S ADVANCES SACRIFICE GAMING'S ROOTS?

L.A. Noire is nothing if not ambitious. It's
clear from the outset that Team Bondi
and Rockstar have delivered the ground
breaking title they set out to develop and, as
advertised, the game admirably marries
Rockstar's traditional open-world formula with
a uniquely moody vibe and motion-capture
technology that makes for some of the most
realistic and emotive characters this side of
Pixar. I can already see this game as a sort of
"Matrix" for the medium not in its source
material or artistic flavor, but as a landmark

whose technical wizardry future
game-makers look to iterate and
improve. I suppose that was clear
enough even months ago, as L.A.

Noire's cinematic flair turned enough heads to
make it the first-ever game featured at the
Tribeca Film Festival.
Impressive to be sure, but I'm not certain
that's exactly a good thing. At least, not entirely.
I'll be the first to say that I'm having a wonder
ful time with the game, but most of what
makes L.A. Noire excellent comes not from the

way it excels in what makes
games so great, but from the
way it inches itself ever so

much closer to gaming's lifelong fetish of being
just like movies.
L.A. Noire offers an enthralling world and
story, but they aren't yours. Yes, it's technically
an open-world game and you're allowed to do
just about anything, but when Team Bondi has
clearly made its realistic characters and well
acted dialogue the game's main reward mecha
nism, there's no motivation to go off the beaten

path. Doing so, in fact, totally shatters the vibe
that L.A. Noire depends on for its immersion
the developers didn't intend for detective
Cole Phelps to sprint in circles like an idiot or
run over pedestrians in his patrol car, and the
world doesn't react to such behavior with near
ly as much realism and emotion as the charac
ters show in the game's outstanding, but pre
canned cutscenes.
If you don't agree, consider some of the

subtle checks that Team Bondi places
on the player to keep them in line
with the "ideal" Cole. Like Heavy
Rain and some other filmic titles,
L.A. Noire places "run" on a separate
button away from the analog stick to
keep you from dashing about like a
madman, makes traffic unrealistically
deferential to prevent crashes or
other disasters that affect a real man's
life in ways the game can't account
for and scripts NPCs to call you out
for ignoring the task at hand. I'm not
trying to call out a conspiracy, but
these choices are made for a reason.
Team Bondi knows that the hook of
its game is in the gripping story and
the relatable characters it involves.
That linear narrative is contrasted
and potentially broken by unco
operative players in an open world
and, ironically but understandably,
the developers gently pull you back if
you leave the critical path.
I think L.A. Noire is a remark
able title in its own right, but its

unprecedented technology and
(potentially) powerful storytelling
shouldn't be confused as advance
ments of what gaming has tradition
ally been all about. I'm not saying
that classic games are necessarily bet
ter, but the relatively unornamented
narratives of Zelda, Metroid or even
flashier titles like Fallout empower
you to develop the context and char
acters however you like, partly in
your mind and partly through
dynamic feedback in the game.
They're not as jaw-dropping for
passers-by, but their simpler presen
tation frees them from predefined
notions of how your character
should act and how the world should
respond. L.A. Noire may wow audi
ences when shown next to more tra
ditional games, but it's not necessari
ly as engaging.
