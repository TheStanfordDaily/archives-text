cc -w-t was easy, folks," says cancer patient
I Roger Sagner as he slips into death, min
-A-utes after taking a lethal dose of medi
cine prescribed by his doctor. So begins "How to
Die in Oregon," a documentary by Peter
Richardson about Oregon's Death with Dignity
Act and the stories of the people who choose to
utilize it. Intimately shot, it brings people's stories
and decisions regarding the ends of their lives out
into the open, making for an emotional, harrow
ing and thoughtful experience.
The documentary tells many stories but
spends the most time with Cody Curtis, a 54-

year-old terminal cancer patient, and her family.
Cody, having gone through a year of incredibly
painful treatment only to find that her cancer
returned and she had only months to live, decides
to get the prescription for medicine that would
end her life. However, she struggles with her deci
sion when she outlives her six-month prognosis.
Her emotional journey, along with the conflicting
opinions of her family, provides a very nuanced
exploration of what it means to choose to end
one's life.
The documentary also follows Nancy

Ziedzielski, who
crusades to get
similar "Death

who went to the media after his insurance com

the prescription that would end his life but not
the costs of continued cancer treatment.
The documentary's quiet, unassuming
nature, coupled with the sadness of the stories
being told, makes for an incredibly emotional
viewing experience. The audience sees people in
their darkest, saddest moments, struggling with
the nerve-wracking choice of either pain-filled life
or death. It is difficult to sit through this film,
despite its unexpected moments of brightness
Cody's defiant sense of humor, for instance.
Watching the documentary also forces view

ers to question their own beliefs on whether "right
to die" laws are morally just. The documentary
does not favor one side of the issue; it simply tells
stories. This allows the audience to decide for itself
what is right. At some points of the film, such as
when Nancy tearfully speaks about her husband's
painful last days, one thinks that yes, people
should be able to choose when their lives end.

However, when we see someone like Randy
Stroup, who wants to continue to treat his illness
but whose insurance would rather pay for him to
