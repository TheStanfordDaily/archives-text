## ROXY SASS Breaking the honor code 
### 
Roxy wouldn't go so far as to
call herself a cheater, but she's
been mighty close. It's a little
inevitable: Stanford students are
smart, fit, attractive and often tinted
with ADD. Throw those all into a hot
and steamy Phi Sig dance floor or a
late-night study room, and sordid
thoughts start to flow.
Arnold's got Roxy thinking: real
monogamy is incredibly difficult. Of
course it has its perks a relation
ship is best when deep thrusts are
paired with deep trust but in col
lege, the long-term goal is hard to
keep in your frontal cortex, especially
when it's shriveled up with booze
and other miscellany.
So, cheating happens and
Roxy knows it can be both accidental
and not-so-accidental. Roxy's not
here to preach one moral side over
the other, so she'll give both sides of
the question (and you, if you'll let
her) a thorough examination:
For those committed official
ly or not to someone but looking
to dabble on the side, a few tips.
iPhone? Put on a passcode and adjust
your settings to not have your texts
show on your screen. The best part of
cheating is the sneaking: the secret
glances, the clandestine meetings, get
ting to use the word 'clandestine,' etc.
Don't ruin the fun by slipping up and
making out at a party. Trust Roxy:
people see you and they're not
(always) too drunk to remember.
And on a more moral note, if
the cheater plans to tell the cuckold,
don't let someone else tell first. It

sucks to find out your significant
other is sucking someone else
don't add insult to injury. And if the
cheater doesn't plan to tell, don't tell
anyone else, either. It's a first-world
country: we have time to gossip, and
we (especially Roxy) do it more than

we'd like to admit.
If your thoughts wander in
places they shouldn't, but you hesitate
to break the Honor Code, a few tips.
Roxy has far too much empirical evi
dence to support this theory: if
you've thought about it enough, add
tequila and you just might do it. If
you want to give monogamy a try,
avoid that hottie you really want to
turn into cougar prey, especially
when it's hunting hours. Even if you
think a beautiful relationship might
arise from it, be wary: a lot of rela
tionships are shaped by the way they
begin. If you started out on bottom,
you might end up feeling even lower
than before.
But these are thoughts far too
Debbie Downer for the joy of under
grad debauchery. If you're lucky
enough to have a relationship worth
being faithful for, keep it. For the rest
of you, remember: you're in college.
Be nice to those you date, but give
Roxy a call every once in a while.
