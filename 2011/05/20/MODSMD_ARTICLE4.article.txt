# SEIZING DESTINY
## NO. 2 STANFORD BACK IN ACTION AT NCAA TOURNEY 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The women's tennis team is at it again. After dispatch
ing two opponents last weekend to open its defense of the
NCAA national team title, the No. 2 Cardinal returns to
the court today against 16th seeded Northwestern (22-7,
9-1 Big Ten), a team that is riding a six-match winning
streak and seeking the upset.
If Northwestern were to advance, it would be the
fourth quarterfinal appearance for the Wildcats in the last
six years. And there is a history of success for their pro
gram on the Farm the last time the Wildcats came to
Stanford for the NCAA Tournament, their unseeded dou
bles team of Alexis Prousis and Cristelle Grier won the
2006 NCAA Doubles championship. That was also the
first year Northwestern made it to the quarterfinals,
sparking their recent run under head coach Claire Pol
lard.
That success has also included eight straight seasons of
at least 20 wins, including this year out of the Wildcats'
last 13 seasons, 11 of them have ended with 20 or more
wins.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
The top-seeded women's tennis team had little trouble last weekend in the first
two rounds of the NCAA Championships. The No. 2 Cardinal swept both
matches 4-0, but will face a tougher challenge against Northwestern today.
So far in the tournament, the
Wildcats knocked off Indiana Uni
versity-Purdue University at Fort
Wayne in the first round before fac
ing well-known foe Notre Dame in
the second. Overall, the Wildcats
feature a very dominant doubles
composition and a feisty singles
lineup.
Stanford freshman Kristie Ahn
understands the strength of the
Cardinal's opponent, but believes
in its ability to win.
"All the teams that have made it
to the Round of 16 are really good,"
Ahn said. "Northwestern is an in
door team, so they generally play
really fast. We are just going to go
out and give it our best, and I think
our lineup will be able to take
them."
Stanford has its own talent pool
to draw from, which will also re
ceive an important boost when Ahn
returns from time off. She and
freshman Nicole Gibbs are a com
bined 75-8 overall and are unde
feated at 42-0 in dual matches. The
two have been a large reason why
Stanford's depth has been able to
overcome a large portion of their
opponents.
"We really compliment each
other's game and always have a lot
of fun playing together because we
keep each other relaxed," Ahn said.
"It's great that we're both freshman

because we can grow together and
help each other along the way,
hopefully for the next four years."
The Cardinal also has a three
time All-America in Hilary Barte,
the No. 3 player in the country. The
senior is 27-5 overall, 16-4 in duals
and is enjoying a dominating sea
son all-around. She has combined
with sophomore Mallory Burdette,
Stanford's No. 2 player, for a 22-6
record in doubles play. The pair has
a top-three national ranking and a
reputation for tough coordinated
play.
Perhaps the greatest thing Stan
ford has going for it this weekend is
its home-court advantage. The Car
dinal has an NCAA-record home

winning streak of 181 matches (147
regular season, 34 NCAA Tourna
ment), an active streak that is a
record in any collegiate sport,
men's or women's. The streak has
lasted well over a decade the last
loss at home was a 5-4 defeat to Cal
ifornia on February 27,1999.

Ahn, however, is far less con
cerned with the home winning
streak than one might think.
"In the end, it's just a number,"
she said. "There's no added pres
sure to try and keep it going even
though it's obviously a phenomenal
testament to the Stanford tennis
program. The most important thing
is to stay healthy, to fine-tune our
games to make them that little bit
better and to not stress out."
The Stanford women acknowl
edged that other teams coming to
the Farm will be gunning to knock
off the No. 1 seed. Ahn also knows
that the Cardinal must be prepared
for what it will face.

"Other teams will be playing
their best tennis when they play
against us, so we have to be ready
for that," she said. "Practice has
been catered to what each player
needs in order to be ready. If people
want to play singles points, they'll
play, and the same goes for doubles
points. It's a question of what each
player personally must work on."
Stanford kicks off the second
weekend of the NCAA Tourna
ment tonight at 6 p.m. at Taube Ten
nis Center.

Wayne in the first round before fac
ing well-known foe Notre Dame in
the second. Overall, the Wildcats
feature a very dominant doubles
composition and a feisty singles
lineup.
Stanford freshman Kristie Ahn
understands the strength of the
Cardinal's opponent, but believes
in its ability to win.
"All the teams that have made it
to the Round of 16 are really good,"
Ahn said. "Northwestern is an in
door team, so they generally play
really fast. We are just going to go
out and give it our best, and I think
our lineup will be able to take
them."
Stanford has its own talent pool
to draw from, which will also re
ceive an important boost when Ahn
returns from time off. She and
freshman Nicole Gibbs are a com
bined 75-8 overall and are unde
feated at 42-0 in dual matches. The
two have been a large reason why
Stanford's depth has been able to
overcome a large portion of their
opponents.
"We really compliment each
other's game and always have a lot
of fun playing together because we
keep each other relaxed," Ahn said.
"It's great that we're both freshman

because we can grow together and
help each other along the way,
hopefully for the next four years."
The Cardinal also has a three
time All-America in Hilary Barte,
the No. 3 player in the country. The
senior is 27-5 overall, 16-4 in duals
and is enjoying a dominating sea
son all-around. She has combined
with sophomore Mallory Burdette,
Stanford's No. 2 player, for a 22-6
record in doubles play. The pair has
a top-three national ranking and a
reputation for tough coordinated
play.
Perhaps the greatest thing Stan
ford has going for it this weekend is
its home-court advantage. The Car
dinal has an NCAA-record home

winning streak of 181 matches (147
regular season, 34 NCAA Tourna
ment), an active streak that is a
record in any collegiate sport,
men's or women's. The streak has
lasted well over a decade the last
loss at home was a 5-4 defeat to Cal
ifornia on February 27,1999.

Ahn, however, is far less con
cerned with the home winning
streak than one might think.
"In the end, it's just a number,"
she said. "There's no added pres
sure to try and keep it going even
though it's obviously a phenomenal
testament to the Stanford tennis
program. The most important thing
is to stay healthy, to fine-tune our
games to make them that little bit
better and to not stress out."
The Stanford women acknowl
edged that other teams coming to
the Farm will be gunning to knock
off the No. 1 seed. Ahn also knows
that the Cardinal must be prepared
for what it will face.

"Other teams will be playing
their best tennis when they play
against us, so we have to be ready
for that," she said. "Practice has
been catered to what each player
needs in order to be ready. If people
want to play singles points, they'll
play, and the same goes for doubles
points. It's a question of what each
player personally must work on."
Stanford kicks off the second
weekend of the NCAA Tourna
ment tonight at 6 p.m. at Taube Ten
nis Center.
