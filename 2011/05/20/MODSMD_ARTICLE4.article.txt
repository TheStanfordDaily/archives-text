# SEIZING DESTINY
## NO. 2 STANFORD BACK IN ACTION AT NCAA TOURNEY 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The women's tennis team is at it again. After dispatch
ing two opponents last weekend to open its defense of the
NCAA national team title, the No. 2 Cardinal returns to
the court today against 16th seeded Northwestern (22-7,
9-1 Big Ten), a team that is riding a six-match winning
streak and seeking the upset.
If Northwestern were to advance, it would be the
fourth quarterfinal appearance for the Wildcats in the last
six years. And there is a history of success for their pro
gram on the Farm the last time the Wildcats came to
Stanford for the NCAA Tournament, their unseeded dou
bles team of Alexis Prousis and Cristelle Grier won the
2006 NCAA Doubles championship. That was also the
first year Northwestern made it to the quarterfinals,
sparking their recent run under head coach Claire Pol
lard.
That success has also included eight straight seasons of
at least 20 wins, including this year out of the Wildcats'
last 13 seasons, 11 of them have ended with 20 or more
wins.

The top-seeded women's tennis team had little trouble last weekend in the first
two rounds of the NCAA Championships. The No. 2 Cardinal swept both
matches 4-0, but will face a tougher challenge against Northwestern today.
