## Contractor to manage Suites clubs Some managers, chefs allege conflict of interest with ResEd asst. director 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The University is soliciting contrac
tors to take control over the manage
ment of Governor's Corner Dining So
ciety, also known as the Suites eating
clubs. According to Suites eating club
chief executive Morgan Priestley 'l2,
Student Organized Services (SOS),
which also manages Row chefs and
trains some self-op staff, will receive
the contract.
The contractor's role will be to
oversee the chefs at the Avanti,
Beefeater, Bollard and Middle Earth
eating clubs, managing their payrolls
and evaluating chef performance, ac
cording to Residential Education
(ResEd) Director of Operations
Aaron Buzay.
The process has been complicated
by allegations that ResEd Assistant
Director Zac Sargeant's role in the
process presents a conflict of interest.
His brother-in-law and former em
ployer, Nick Peters '94, is the chief ex
ecutive officer of SOS, a contractor
bidding to take over operations at the
Suites eating clubs.
Some of the chefs and managers al
lege that Sargeant pushed SOS as the
contractor of choice. Sargeant declined
to comment.
The relationship, confirmed by Pe
ters, has led some of the chefs and man
agers to cry foul. The concerned chefs
and managers said that at their last
meeting about the dining changes,
ResEd Associate Dean Nate Boswell
took Sargeant's normal place.
"Residential Education has been
deliberate to ensure that all conflicts of
interest and/or perceived conflicts of
interest have been addressed," wrote
Buzay in an email to The Daily.
Former eating clubs CEO Josh
Charnin-Aker 'll and former CFO
John Criste 'll took their concerns
about a conflict of interest to ResEd
Dean Deborah Golder.
"We were concerned about the
conflict of interest having Zac on
our case posed and first she kind of
brushed it off, and didn't really say
there was a conflict of interest,"
Criste said. "She said there is no
conflict of interest."
Criste said he and Charnin-
Aker asked if students would
maintain leadership at Suites Din
ing. The former managers said
Golder reportedly told them they
could speak to "people above her"
for clarification about the reasons
behind the changes, but didn't
specify who they were.

Management history
One consequence of the bid is
the four chefs don't have contracts
for next year a predicament un
seen in the nearly thirty years that
the dining society has been operat
ing. This year's contracts expire

June 9, thereby ending the chefs'
health insurance benefits. The din
ing society has elected to cover
chefs' health expenses out of pock
et until contracts are renewed.
In the past, the club managers
have been responsible for collect
ing board bills and hiring and firing
chefs. Typically, chefs have signed
their contracts for the following
year by the middle of May, but con
tracts can't be renewed until a ven
dor comes in, said Buzay.
"Every spring, we've got like 15
years of contracts in our managers'
office. We negotiate a contract with
each of the four chefs, and we say,
'Here's what we like, here's what
we don't like, here's what we want
you to do differently and here's
what we're going to expect from
you,'" Priestley said. "And then we
evaluate them appropriately and if
we want to hire them back then we
hire them back."
But the University no longer
considers the eating clubs' autono
my appropriate and has taken steps
to bring the dining society further
under its wing.
Several years ago, the University
began collecting Suites board bills
and the eating clubs signed a con
tract with Student Housing stipu
lating that Stanford janitors would
clean the common areas and bath
rooms.
The ultimate changes have been
waiting in the wings since at least
the beginning of the school year. In
September, ResEd hired Buzay
from Bethel University as director
of operations, tasking him with en
suring Res Ed's "compliance with
University standards and to up
grade operational policies," Buzay
said. According to Buzay, ResEd
has identified "several areas in need
of improvement" for Suites,
Res Ed's goal is to "prioritize a stu
dent management approach" and
"adjust and adhere to institutional
policy while limiting risk to the Uni
versity.
"The selection of an external
vendor to manage chef contracts
and help students supervise the
chefs is the last change necessary to
ensure compliance with University
policy and best practices, although
refinement of policy and practice
will be ongoing," Buzay added.
One other recent change is stu
dent manager and hasher pay
checks go through the University
payment system. Hashers had not
been paid since winter quarter until
last Tuesday, which managers ar
gued was in violation of California
labor relations law, since employers
are required to pay employees
within a month of services ren
dered.
"It's just an inefficient process at
this point," said eating clubs CFO
J.T. Sullivan 'll.
For the time being, chefs are still
paid through ADP, a private ac
counting company.
"The other problem with this
whole process is we are being filled
in on the fly with some of the things
that they want to do," Priestley said.
"There's a lot of things that we're
fighting, but there's a lot of things
we're never going to agree to and
never would have agreed to if we
knew everything the first time.
When we ask a tough question, a lot
of the times the answer we get back
is, 'we don't know, we haven't got
ten there yet."'
Delayed notification
"At the beginning of the quarter,
our understanding was tliat we
meet with [ResEd representatives]
at least once a week," Priestley said.
"My understanding was they want
ed to watch over what we were
doing," akin to the practice of
monitoring Row finances that
ResEd implemented at the start of
spring quarter.
"Which at first we were upset
about," he added,"because we've han
dled this well for 28 years, and people

don't walk off with money because
somebody else would notice."
Both the CEO and CFO watch
the same account and monitor the
other managers' accounts, and the
chefs are aware of weekly expenses.
"On the other hand it was sort
of okay," Priestley said. "We un
derstand where they're coming
from see where students'
money is going, right? And then we
find out... that they're going to
contract an outside vendor."
The first the chefs heard of the
contractor bid was via rumors
passed through University staff,
said Middle Earth chef Steven
Roland. The chefs informed the
managers and both parties later
met with Res Ed. But after request
ing a written plan for the changes
several weeks ago, neither the
chefs nor the managers have re-

ceived any paperwork to date.
"Ultimately, the outside con
tractor will be the company that
will lay down the law when it's per
taining to us chefs," Roland said.
"And they blatantly said our
salaries will be reduced and our
benefits will most likely not mirror
the package that we have today."
"When I asked [Sargeant]
whether he going to reduce my
salary, he said yes, meaning he
knows the vendor is going to do it,"
added Bollard chef Frank Flassan.
Buzay said chef compensation
would not be set until a contractor
is identified. He is "aware" that
Suites chefs are among the high
est-paid on campus, and said
ResEd will have no opinion on
chef compensation "until a com
plete contractual review has been
conducted."
Managers were told they would
have input on salaries, but will
have no influence on chef benefits.
ResEd "wants to retain the flex
ibility of the dining societies to
manage their finances and opera
tions in connection with the resi
dential programs as much as possi
ble," Buzay said. What this means,
he said, is that students will be al
lowed "to offer input into the per
formance of chefs as well as overall
operation of the dining facilities
and other local operations."
"As you can imagine, most ex
ternal vendors do not allow for this
operational flexibility and are hes
itant to prioritize student led
input," he added.
Regardless, students will be
part of a "yearly review of chef
staff and the implementation [of]
potential raises."
"We believe deeply in the
unique nature of student manage
ment and leadership that the Row
and Suites afford Stanford stu
dents and we are committed to
preserving the core tenets," Buzay
said. "We are also committed to
and responsible for upholding the
standards of the University."
Chefs have prepared over the
last week to apply as contractors
themselves, although they are likely
too late. Managers remain opposed
to Res Ed's changes and three chefs
are retaining legal counsel, saying
they intend to fight for their jobs.

"Ultimately, the outside
contractor will be the
company that will lay
down the law when it
pertains to us chefs."
