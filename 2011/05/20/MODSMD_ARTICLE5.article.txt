## Contractor to manage Suites clubs Some managers, chefs allege conflict of interest with ResEd asst. director 
### TYLER BROWN DESK EDITOR 
The University is soliciting contrac
tors to take control over the manage
ment of Governor's Corner Dining So
ciety, also known as the Suites eating
clubs. According to Suites eating club
chief executive Morgan Priestley 'l2,
Student Organized Services (SOS),
which also manages Row chefs and
trains some self-op staff, will receive
the contract.
The contractor's role will be to
oversee the chefs at the Avanti,
Beefeater, Bollard and Middle Earth
eating clubs, managing their payrolls
and evaluating chef performance, ac
cording to Residential Education
(ResEd) Director of Operations
Aaron Buzay.
The process has been complicated
by allegations that ResEd Assistant
Director Zac Sargeant's role in the
process presents a conflict of interest.
His brother-in-law and former em
ployer, Nick Peters '94, is the chief ex
ecutive officer of SOS, a contractor
bidding to take over operations at the
Suites eating clubs.
Some of the chefs and managers al
lege that Sargeant pushed SOS as the
contractor of choice. Sargeant declined
to comment.
The relationship, confirmed by Pe
ters, has led some of the chefs and man
agers to cry foul. The concerned chefs
and managers said that at their last
meeting about the dining changes,
ResEd Associate Dean Nate Boswell
took Sargeant's normal place.
"Residential Education has been
deliberate to ensure that all conflicts of
interest and/or perceived conflicts of
interest have been addressed," wrote
Buzay in an email to The Daily.
Former eating clubs CEO Josh
Charnin-Aker 'll and former CFO
John Criste 'll took their concerns
about a conflict of interest to ResEd
Dean Deborah Golder.
