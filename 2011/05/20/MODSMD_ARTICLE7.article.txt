## STUDENT LIFE Used clothing store, student art gallery open in Old Union Basement 'Union Underground' to focus on sustainability, student expression 
### NARDOS GIRMA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Most Stanford students have probably never
been to the Old Union basement, but Friday after
noon they will be able to witness its transforma
tion from a storage space to Union Underground,
a new student "art and sustainability collective."
The space is the brainchild of many students in
volved in a number of sustainability-focused
groups on campus, particularly Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford (SSS) and Green Living Council
(GLC).
Union Underground will combine the "Clothes
Loop," a used clothing store, and "Prevoir," an art
gallery exhibiting student art. However, the
Clothes Loop isn't meant to be purely a thrift
store.
"We don't just want it to be a Goodwill," said
Iberia Zafira 'l2, who worked on marketing and
advertising for the project. "We want [the space] to
be a community where students can freely express
themselves and feel empowered to act sustain
ably."
Shaan Chugh 'l4, who worked on marketing
with Zafira, agreed.
"It's something we created because we saw a
great student demand for it," Chugh said.
Union Underground incorporates elements of
campus-wide events like Vision Earth and Ditch
that Dumpster, an event at the end of spring quar
ter that allows students to give away used items
that are then sold during new student orientation.

What distinguishes Union Underground from
these events, however, is its role as a permanent
place where students can regularly find affordable
clothing and other supplies.
"Instead of having just two events or one event
at the end of the year, there was a need for having
something that was more permanent," said organ
izer Nicole Greenspan 'l2.
The store will go through a three-week trial pe
riod following its opening, which organizers say is
critical to determining its growth and future.
"We don't have a previous model of this at
Stanford that we can make accurate estimations
out of, so it's important to get baseline data from
these few weeks," said organizer Nicole Gaetjens
'l2.
All the items and clothing will be free during
the pilot period and, depending on the store's suc
cess, will continue to be free for as long as possible.
"Initially we had been working on a thrift store
model or another monetary model to make it fi
nancially sustainable," Gaetjens said. "That's an
example of how this project has evolved. There's a
possibility that we might switch to another model
later, but for this pilot it's going to be free."
The grand opening will take place this after
noon from 12:30 to 2:30 p.m. in the basement of
Old Union. Union Underground will be open from
12 to 4 p.m. every day, including weekends.
Although the students involved come from dif
ferent groups and have different objectives, they
have all come together for the project to promote
a collective theme.
"What ties all of us together is that we've all
identified the need for this sort of sustainability and
arts collective on campus," Chugh said.
