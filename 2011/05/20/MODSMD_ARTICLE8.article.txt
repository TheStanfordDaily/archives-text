## '30 Rock' writer Cannon talks comedic improv 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
Drama department lecturer Dan
Klein interviewed "30 Rock" pro
ducer Kay Cannon Thursday in
Roble Theater. The talk focused on
Cannon's writing style, her experi
ences on the award-winning show
and trying to enter the entertain
ment industry right out of graduate
school.

Although a she has been a writer
for "30 Rock" since the show's in
ception, Cannon had never written
for a TV show before landing the
"30 Rock" job.
"The beginning was scary and
crazy, for me especially," Cannon
told an audience of about 50 people.
"Every day it was like, 'what are we
doing today?'"
Originally an improviser, Can
non's writing style differed from
many of the writers on "30 Rock,"
whom she referred to as "Harvard
Lampoon guys."
"There's a very specific way they
write, and it's very different from
mine as an improviser," said Can
non. "Writers who sit down and
write might judge what they're put
ting down, but I always just try to

barf it out. I'm writing crap, but I'll
put it down."
Cannon mentioned funny inci
dents on set, goofs featuring Nerf ri
fles and Tina Fey improvising, but
the focus of the presentation was on
the amount of hard work that goes
into writing for a weekly television
show.
The hours and stress can be diffi
cult, a fact that is sometimes reflect
ed in "30 Rock," which is itself a
show about writing a comedy show.
One episode features Liz Lemon,
the head writer played by Tina Fey,
being completely exhausted and
overworked, an experience Cannon
said was easy to relate to and write
about.
"There's a ton of re-writing on
our show," said Cannon. "Some
times we'll spend an hour or two on
a joke, on one line,"
In addition to the long hours and
multiple rewrites, Cannon admitted
that putting a piece of her work out
into the writing room is one of the
few things that still makes her nerv
ous.
One audience member asked
about the offensive nature of some
of the jokes on "30 Rock," relating
the question to the Gaieties contro
versy at Stanford earlier this year.
Cannon objected to the idea of a
"line" that can never be crossed,
but she said that some topics in
her case, Sept. 11 and rape jokes
just don't play well with audiences.
She added that a show has to deal
with topics in an intellectually pro
found way and earn the right to tell
offensive jokes.
Cannon, who is teaching a class
about sketch comedy writing in San
Francisco this weekend, said it is ex

tremely important to remember
that your writing will be bad some
times, but encouraged students to
try new things.
"Getting into that community of
people who are equally as passion
ate to do what you want to do is im
portant," said Cannon.
The audience seemed apprecia
tive of the presentation, and multi
ple members approached Cannon
afterward.
"It was nice to see someone
who has actually succeeded in the
professional dramatic arts," said
Kevin Hurlbutt 'l4, "especially at
a school where it's not always
prominent."
