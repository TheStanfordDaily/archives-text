### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
Drama department lecturer Dan
Klein interviewed "30 Rock" pro
ducer Kay Cannon Thursday in
Roble Theater. The talk focused on
Cannon's writing style, her experi
ences on the award-winning show
and trying to enter the entertain
ment industry right out of graduate
school.

Although a she has been a writer
for "30 Rock" since the show's in
ception, Cannon had never written
for a TV show before landing the
"30 Rock" job.
"The beginning was scary and
crazy, for me especially," Cannon
told an audience of about 50 people.
"Every day it was like, 'what are we
doing today?'"
Originally an improviser, Can
non's writing style differed from
many of the writers on "30 Rock,"
whom she referred to as "Harvard
Lampoon guys."
"There's a very specific way they
write, and it's very different from
mine as an improviser," said Can
non. "Writers who sit down and
write might judge what they're put
ting down, but I always just try to

barf it out. I'm writing crap, but I'll
put it down."
Cannon mentioned funny inci
dents on set, goofs featuring Nerf ri
fles and Tina Fey improvising, but
the focus of the presentation was on
the amount of hard work that goes
into writing for a weekly television
show.
The hours and stress can be diffi
cult, a fact that is sometimes reflect
ed in "30 Rock," which is itself a
show about writing a comedy show.
One episode features Liz Lemon,
the head writer played by Tina Fey,
being completely exhausted and
overworked, an experience Cannon
said was easy to relate to and write
about.
"There's a ton of re-writing on
our show," said Cannon. "Some
times we'll spend an hour or two on
a joke, on one line,"
In addition to the long hours and
multiple rewrites, Cannon admitted
that putting a piece of her work out
into the writing room is one of the
few things that still makes her nerv
ous.
