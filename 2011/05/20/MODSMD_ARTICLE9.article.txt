## Medal of Honor winner Bucha explains leadership 
### ERIC DUNN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bud Bucha MBA'67 addressed an
audience filled with veterans, active
men and women of the armed servic
es and other members of the Stan
ford community to talk about what it
means to lead at Thursday's talk,
sponsored by the Graduate School of
Business Veterans Club.
No stranger to leadership, Bucha
was awarded the Medal of Honor in
1970 for his courageous service in
Vietnam. The Medal of Honor is the
most prestigious award possible for a
member of the military and remains
a rare distinction. Among the nearly
3,500 recipients of the award (half
during the Civil War) only 85 are
alive today. Since receiving the
award, Bucha has advocated on be
half of veterans and spoken about
the importance of serving those in
need. The GSB Veterans Club invit
ed him as part of an event that high

lighted military service and raised
awareness about military service at
Stanford.
Bucha began the talk explaining
the importance of connecting with
veterans. "I spend one day every
week talking to veterans," he said. "I
have learned from them what it
means to serve your country." He
stressed that those with the responsi
bility to lead men and women into
harm's way should "have the courage
to define an objective that is finite."
Bucha then outlined five charac
teristics of leadership: "integrity,
competency, confidence, compassion
and humility." He said each element
is "essential to what it means to be a
great leader" and argued that univer
sities like Stanford and West Point
are "trying to produce leaders of sub
stance."
"Integrity is the most fundamen
tal part of leadership," he said. "That
is why every military academy has
the same honor code: We will not lie,
steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us
anyone who does."
After speaking about humility
and service, he reflected on those
with whom he had served who had
fallen in combat.
"Ten of them are written on a
wall in Washington and every day I
think about the opportunities that I
have that they will never have," he
said. "Have you returned for what
you have been given?"
"It was a great honor to be in his
presence," said Captain Melissa In
gram, a director of the San Jose State
ROTC Program and a member of
the audience. "As someone who is in
charge of training leaders, I see his
humility as something to strive for."
When asked what his message
for Stanford was, Bucha's answer
was simple and direct.
"Always look out for those who
are weaker and meeker than you
are," he said. "Always. That is what it
means to be a leader."
