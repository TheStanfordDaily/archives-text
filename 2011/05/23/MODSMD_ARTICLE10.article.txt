## SoM disciplines five faculty members 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”An Le Nguyen 
The Stanford School of Medicine
has taken disciplinary action against
five faculty members who gave paid
promotional speeches on behalf of
drug companies, thereby violating
the School's conflict of interest rules.
This development comes five
months after ProPublica, a public in
terest media outlet, found that more
than a dozen of Stanford's doctors
served as paid speakers.
Following the ProPublica report,
Dean Philip Pizzo condemned these
violations in his Dec. 13, 2010
newsletter.

"Our preliminary investigation
suggests that some of the individuals
likely to be reported by ProPublica
had understandable reasons for con
fusion about Stanford's policies and
have already addressed them and
ceased activities like 'speakers' bu
reau' participation," Pizzo wrote
then. "Others, though, offered expla
nations why their activities contin

ued that are difficult, if not impossi
ble, to reconcile with our policy, and
here we have concerns."
