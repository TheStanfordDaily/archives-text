## SPEAKING OUT Free Speech Friday and Let's Talk encourage campus conversation 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI STAFF WRITER 
So reads the First Amendment of
the Bill of Rights in the Constitu
tion. Even though it has been writ
ten into American history, free
speech isn't necessarily easy to put
into practice.
According to Wesley Walker 'll, stu
dents are limited in class discussions at
Stanford, because they are constantly pan
dering to professors, trying to regurgitate
the viewpoint that will help them achieve
an "A," rather than sharing their own per
spective.
"We tend to learn more and better
when we talk with friends outside of class,"
Walker said. "That's meaty discussion. We
want to have profound discussions."
While the general realization of the
need for more communication at Stanford
had been growing in discussions among
Lyla Johnston 'll, member of The Spoken
Word Collective, and her circle of friends,
the actual idea for 'Free Speech Fridays'
hit Johnston spontaneously.
"I was going to sleep one night, and I
thought, 'Man, I feel like I have so much to
say,'" Johnston said. "And I wish I had a
venue to express myself.' And then it just
popped into my head."
Immediately acting on this burst of in
spiration, Johnston called her friends and
reserved the White Plaza stage for Friday,
April 29. With an open microphone on the

stage, Johnston, Walker and the others
urged passers-by to pour out their feelings,
read a poem or even talk about their day
anything to open up discussion.
"We were thinking of having the audi
ence down on the ground there and the
speaker on the stage," Johnston said. "But
we thought that might have been too hier
archical and too separational [sic], so we
just had everyone on the stage."
The second Free Speech Friday on May
13 coincided with other events at White
Plaza, including an Amnesty International
food fair and a band gig, attracting a crowd
from those milling about the sunny plaza.
This time, Free Speech Friday was opened

up to forms of expression other than spo
ken word. Chalk was brought out, and
soon a crowd of barefoot artists was cover
ing the backdrop of the stage with fantas
tical swirls, ornamented forms of the word
"love" and multi-colored hearts of varying
sizes. Rappers came out and freestyled. A
bearded guitarist sang and individuals
read poems by Shel Silverstein and Je
laluddin Rumi.
There was still heartfelt sharing of dia
logue as well. At one point, Johnston, who
was M.C.-ing the event, took the micro
phone in her own hands and shared the
story of her injury in Chile during the
earthquake last year. Trapped in a trem

bling 12-story apartment building, John
ston jumped from the third story window,
injuring her spine and pelvis.
One Stanford graduate sat on the stage
and honestly shared his experiences with
depression after his mother's suicide.
Lucia Hennelly 'll believes that this kind
of sharing could foster a healthier com
munity.
"This campus had huge mental health
challenges that were very, very much swept
under the rug or that a lot of people simply
aren't aware of," Hennelly said. "Huge sex
ual assault rates, depression and we don't
talk about that."
Free Speech Friday is not the only event
on campus geared toward trying to create
more of a community at Stanford. As part
of a wellness campaign associated with The
Bridge, students sat on benches around
White Plaza holding signs reading "Let's
Talk About Anything." Participants like
Sami Hartley 'll and Robin Thomas 'l2
had conversations ranging from inflatable
ties to politics.
"Sometimes we're so afraid of bursting
anyone's bubble that we hesitate to ac
knowledge that other people exist," wrote
Hartley in an email to The Daily. "We'll
suddenly become engrossed in the side
walk when another person approaches us
on the street, we stare at out phones until
we can escape bookstore lines and shove
our purchases at the cashier and we silent
ly zoom around campus from one bubble

Taking initiative and disregard
ing inhibitions is a key component
of Let's Talk.
"When students are able to put
their fears and boundaries aside
and truly open up to each other, the
impact on student mental health
and sense of community at Stan

ford is phenomenal," wrote Taylor
Winfield 'l3, participant and facili
tator in the movement, in an email
to The Daily.
Fear is perhaps the root of the is
sues espoused by Free Speech Fri
day and Let's Talk. The founders of
these events hope that their pres
ence at Stanford will erase this fear.
"Present your truth," Walker
said. "Talk because we want to know.
We can only grow with dialogue."

tion. Even though it has been writ
ten into American history, free
speech isn't necessarily easy to put
into practice.
According to Wesley Walker 'll, stu
dents are limited in class discussions at
Stanford, because they are constantly pan
dering to professors, trying to regurgitate
the viewpoint that will help them achieve
an "A," rather than sharing their own per
spective.
"We tend to learn more and better
when we talk with friends outside of class,"
Walker said. "That's meaty discussion. We
want to have profound discussions."
While the general realization of the
need for more communication at Stanford
had been growing in discussions among
Lyla Johnston 'll, member of The Spoken
Word Collective, and her circle of friends,
the actual idea for 'Free Speech Fridays'
hit Johnston spontaneously.
"I was going to sleep one night, and I
thought, 'Man, I feel like I have so much to
say,'" Johnston said. "And I wish I had a
venue to express myself.' And then it just
popped into my head."
Immediately acting on this burst of in
spiration, Johnston called her friends and
reserved the White Plaza stage for Friday,
April 29. With an open microphone on the

stage, Johnston, Walker and the others
urged passers-by to pour out their feelings,
read a poem or even talk about their day
anything to open up discussion.
"We were thinking of having the audi
ence down on the ground there and the
speaker on the stage," Johnston said. "But
we thought that might have been too hier
archical and too separational [sic], so we
just had everyone on the stage."
The second Free Speech Friday on May
13 coincided with other events at White
Plaza, including an Amnesty International
food fair and a band gig, attracting a crowd
from those milling about the sunny plaza.
This time, Free Speech Friday was opened

up to forms of expression other than spo
ken word. Chalk was brought out, and
soon a crowd of barefoot artists was cover
ing the backdrop of the stage with fantas
tical swirls, ornamented forms of the word
"love" and multi-colored hearts of varying
sizes. Rappers came out and freestyled. A
bearded guitarist sang and individuals
read poems by Shel Silverstein and Je
laluddin Rumi.
There was still heartfelt sharing of dia
logue as well. At one point, Johnston, who
was M.C.-ing the event, took the micro
phone in her own hands and shared the
story of her injury in Chile during the
earthquake last year. Trapped in a trem

bling 12-story apartment building, John
ston jumped from the third story window,
injuring her spine and pelvis.
One Stanford graduate sat on the stage
and honestly shared his experiences with
depression after his mother's suicide.
Lucia Hennelly 'll believes that this kind
of sharing could foster a healthier com
munity.
"This campus had huge mental health
challenges that were very, very much swept
under the rug or that a lot of people simply
aren't aware of," Hennelly said. "Huge sex
ual assault rates, depression and we don't
talk about that."
Free Speech Friday is not the only event
on campus geared toward trying to create
more of a community at Stanford. As part
of a wellness campaign associated with The
Bridge, students sat on benches around
White Plaza holding signs reading "Let's
Talk About Anything." Participants like
Sami Hartley 'll and Robin Thomas 'l2
had conversations ranging from inflatable
ties to politics.
"Sometimes we're so afraid of bursting
anyone's bubble that we hesitate to ac
knowledge that other people exist," wrote
Hartley in an email to The Daily. "We'll
suddenly become engrossed in the side
walk when another person approaches us
on the street, we stare at out phones until
we can escape bookstore lines and shove
our purchases at the cashier and we silent
ly zoom around campus from one bubble

During the second Free Speech Friday on May 13, artists of all types joined student speakers
on the White Plaza stage to exercise their first amendment rights.
to another."
Taking initiative and disregard
ing inhibitions is a key component
of Let's Talk.
"When students are able to put
their fears and boundaries aside
and truly open up to each other, the
impact on student mental health
and sense of community at Stan

ford is phenomenal," wrote Taylor
Winfield 'l3, participant and facili
tator in the movement, in an email
to The Daily.
Fear is perhaps the root of the is
sues espoused by Free Speech Fri
day and Let's Talk. The founders of
these events hope that their pres
ence at Stanford will erase this fear.
"Present your truth," Walker
said. "Talk because we want to know.
We can only grow with dialogue."
