## EDITORIAL Free Speech Rules: Still Illegal 
### 
Universities stand upon the
bedrock of free speech. An
open forum of ideas is the
very essence of the academy. Stan
ford should pride itself on fostering
an open environment in which all
students may express their views
without precondition, but this Edi
torial Board is disappointed by our
University's repeated refusal to
meet even this basic standard.

were moved off campus, making
them inaccessible to most students
who had planned to participate.
Why did this happen? Because
Stanford's policies on partisan
speech, as expressed in the Univer
sity's Administrative Guide Memo
15.1, had not changed. It has now
been more than six years since the
University first promised to update
its speech policies to reflect the 2004
agreement, and still no progress has
been made.

Last week, The Daily reported
that the student group Stanford
Says No to War had been prohibit
ed from passing out flyers on multi
ple occasions because doing so vio
lated the University's free speech
policy. This policy designates White
Plaza as the approved "free speech
zone" from 12-lpm. The implica
tion is that speech isn't free any
where else, and Stanford's policies
explicitly require that any other
protest or demonstration are
banned without prior approval
from the University.
Further, by confining speech ac
tivities to White Plaza, students are
unable to exercise their freedom of
speech at the locations where many
important decisions are made. This
was the case with the Stanford Says
No to War events, while demonstra
tions before the recent Faculty Sen
ate meeting to reinstate ROTC
only proceeded because the event
organizers received prior approval
from the University. Consider for a
moment how ridiculous this re
quirement is. When students on our
campus stage any kind of protest or
demonstration, is it almost always
in response to a University action.
This rule forces students to ask the
University for permission to protest
University policy.
Stanford's inconsistent and over
ly broad restriction of speech has ex
tended to political activity as well. In
2004, the Stanford Democrats at
tempted to hold a phone bank for
John Kerry in White Plaza during
the approved "free speech" hours.
Even though the event followed
every one of the University's rules,
administrators deemed it objection
able and prevented it from proceed
ing. Only after Kai Stinchcombe
MA 'O5 Ph.D. 'lO, president of the
Stanford Democrats, wrote an Oc
tober 11,2004 Daily op-ed alleging
that Stanford's free speech policy
was illegal did administrators prom
ise to revisit and update speech
rules. This put the issue to rest for all
parties involved, and the phone
banks were allowed to proceed.
But four years later, when the
Stanford Democrats attempted to
organize a phone bank for Barack
Obama, Stanford again denied
them permission, citing the very
rules that the University had prom
ised to revisit. The phone banks

Not only are these rules unrea
sonable and antithetical to academ
ic freedom, they are also almost cer
tainly illegal. Under California Ed
ucation Code, Section 94367, also
called the Leonard Law, private
postsecondary educational institu
tions may not punish students for
engaging in "conduct that is speech
or other communication that, when
engaged in outside the campus or
facility of a private postsecondary
institution, is protected from gov
ernmental restriction by the First
Amendment to the United States
Constitution." The Leonard Law
also "does not authorize the prior
restraint of student speech."
University lawyers argue that its
rules qualify as so-called "time,
place and manner" (TPM) regula
tions, which the Supreme Court has
allowed as restrictions on First
Amendment rights. However, Stan
ford would be hard-pressed to ex
plain how its policies meet the
Supreme Court's four-part test for
TPM restrictions, which requires
that they (1) be content-neutral, (2)
be narrowly tailored, (3) serve a sig
nificant public interest and (4) leave
open alternative channels of com
munication. If the present rules do
not meet any one of these criteria,
they are illegal. We believe they are
so egregious that they actually vio
late all four parts.
1. Content-Neutral?
When Stanford chooses to allow
expressions of speech, the approval
process is unilateral, opaque, and on
a case-by-case basis. To the extent
that speech policies are ambiguous,
the University is free to interpret
them however it wishes and its
past behavior has been far from con
sistent, as its history of silencing stu
dent political activity demonstrates.
2. Narrowly Tailored?
It is also laughable that restrict
ing free speech to a tiny fraction of
campus for one hour per day is a
"narrowly tailored" regulation.
Even if the entire campus were only
five times as big as White Plaza
and it is much, much larger than
that the present rule would ban

speech in more than 99 percent of
all possible circumstances.

3. Significant Interest?
Stanford claims speech restric
tions are necessary to avoid losing
its tax-exempt status. The IRS begs
to differ: in a 2002 document enti
tled "Election Year Issues," the
agency explains that to jeopardize
the University's tax-exempt status,
"the political activity must be that
of the college or University and
not the individual activity of its
faculty, staff, or students." More
over, "the actions of students gen
erally are not attributed to an edu
cational institution unless they are
undertaken at the direction of and
with authorization from a school
official." This would seem to refute
Stanford's primary rationale for
limiting student speech. While
other interests would seem rea
sonable say, avoiding class
room disruptions the current

policies are not narrowly tailored
for those interests.
4. Alternative Channels?
Even in the age of Facebook,
students have few avenues to ex
press dissatisfaction with Universi
ty policy. While this Editorial Board
supported the Faculty Senate's de
cision to vote in favor of ROTC's
return, we were discouraged that
many administrators and faculty
members outside of the ad hoc
committee declined to meet stu
dent groups advocating against
ROTC. Short of protesting, these
students had no other means of ex
pressing their dissent to University
officials.

For all these reasons, we chal
lenge University administrators
to change current speech policy.
The University must acknowl
edge that its vague and overly
broad regulations have created
problems for student groups, sup
press student dissent, and likely
violate California law. Nothing
less than our most fundamental
freedom is at stake.
