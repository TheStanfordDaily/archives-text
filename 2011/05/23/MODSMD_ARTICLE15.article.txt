## It's Hard to Write About the Good Things 
### 
If you've followed our column over the past few
months, you've probably noticed that we're some
what critical of several aspects of Stanford. We've
tried to weigh in on the most controversial topics on
campus, but as the joke goes about the liberal/conserva
tive divide in Synergy being drawn around paper tow
els, conflicts on campus are on relatively few fringe
questions.The hot button issues we've highlighted com
prise the five percent of on-campus topics that every
body doesn't agree on, and the simple truth is that even
with the enormous diversity of thought on campus, the
vision for Stanford's future is a widely shared one. That
said, we thought we'd run through what we've written
about, trying to put it in that context.
In our first column, we argued that introductory un
dergraduate education would be better served with
dedicated instructors rather than regular faculty. While
this may be the case, the problem is entirely overshad
owed by the unbelievable quality of upper level cours
es once you manage to wade your way out of IHUM
and the Math 50 series.

Next, we took up the concert scene, and although it
still would be nice to have a big name concert in Frost
in this lifetime, the social scene at Stanford is nothing to
complain about, especially when compared to other
universities of similar academic caliber. We definitely
wouldn't trade any other top 10 schools.
Then came ROTC. It's been invited back on campus,
which was probably a good thing. But either way, every

thing would have been all right, and life on campus,
even for those most affected populations, would have
been and will be just fine.
Then we dove into the alcohol policy and especially
personal responsibility. We still believe that the brunt of
the consequences surrounding a drinking incident
should fall on the individual doing the drinking rather
than on the institution enabling it. But taking a step
back and looking at the alcohol policy in a broader con
text, Stanford is an incredibly safe and sheltered place
to learn how to handle alcohol responsibly. Freshmen
RAs are on the student's side, law enforcement is rela
tively lenient and resources are committed to keeping
underage students from drinking irresponsibly rather
than drinking altogether.

We spent two columns on the ASSU election
process, the first on special interest and coalitions and
the second on campaign spending. In our minds, the



election process would be im
proved considerably if both were
limited significantly or done away
with entirely. But the best part
about the Undergraduate Senate,
Class Presidents and ASSU Execu
tive is that no matter how seriously
candidates take the elections, they
aren't tasked with doing very much
that's fragile enough to be broken.
In short, all they have the potential
to do is improvement.
Another two columns were de
voted to the quagmire that is special
fees. They could use an overhaul
we sure don't want to be the ones to
do it. We think that the primary
problem of the system stems from
the fact that this is the majority
opinion on campus. We hope that

FLiCKS finds away to operate next
year, but if not, it'll be a lesson
learned about reading (and writ
ing) the small print we're sure
they'll be back the next year.
We dove into the realm of the
Stanford administrators with a col
umn on the ongoing review of Judi
cial Affairs and another on Camp
Stanford. On the Judicial Affairs
front, we still think that faster case
time and maintaining the current
standard of proof is important. But
those we talked to tasked with re
forming it seemed reasonable, and
we tend to trust the decisions they
will make. And with Camp Stan
ford, while our proposed enroll
ment policy would likely be a net
positive, the fact that the University
cuts the seniors any slack at all is
pretty remarkable.
Finally, we spent a fair amount of
column space talking about housing
politics and the Row geography.
We'd like to see more draw parity

between pre-assigning and rush.
We'd like to see the Row revitalized
by recognizing that it is highly desir
able housing in low supply and
choosing to relocate administrative
functions elsewhere. But as with
everything else, there's only so
much complaining you can do about
something like the Row. Could you
make it better? Absolutely, but it's
pretty amazing that it's here in it's
current form in the first place.
We 've really enjoyed writing this
column, and we legitimately believe
that Stanford would be a better
place if some of the things we've
discussed were changed. But we
don't take any of it too seriously,
and neither should any one else. All
in all, it's a hell of a place to get to go
to school: let's enjoy it.

Write us about the good things or
things to change Dave and Zack
at Daveg4@stanford.edu and

problem of the system stems from
the fact that this is the majority
opinion on campus. We hope that

FLiCKS finds away to operate next
year, but if not, it'll be a lesson
learned about reading (and writ
ing) the small print we're sure
they'll be back the next year.
We dove into the realm of the
Stanford administrators with a col
umn on the ongoing review of Judi
cial Affairs and another on Camp
Stanford. On the Judicial Affairs
front, we still think that faster case
time and maintaining the current
standard of proof is important. But
those we talked to tasked with re
forming it seemed reasonable, and
we tend to trust the decisions they
will make. And with Camp Stan
ford, while our proposed enroll
ment policy would likely be a net
positive, the fact that the University
cuts the seniors any slack at all is
pretty remarkable.
Finally, we spent a fair amount of
column space talking about housing
politics and the Row geography.
We'd like to see more draw parity

between pre-assigning and rush.
We'd like to see the Row revitalized
by recognizing that it is highly desir
able housing in low supply and
choosing to relocate administrative
functions elsewhere. But as with
everything else, there's only so
much complaining you can do about
something like the Row. Could you
make it better? Absolutely, but it's
pretty amazing that it's here in it's
current form in the first place.
We 've really enjoyed writing this
column, and we legitimately believe
that Stanford would be a better
place if some of the things we've
discussed were changed. But we
don't take any of it too seriously,
and neither should any one else. All
in all, it's a hell of a place to get to go
to school: let's enjoy it.

things to change Dave and Zack
