## It's Hard to Write About the Good Things 
### 
If you've followed our column over the past few
months, you've probably noticed that we're some
what critical of several aspects of Stanford. We've
tried to weigh in on the most controversial topics on
campus, but as the joke goes about the liberal/conserva
tive divide in Synergy being drawn around paper tow
els, conflicts on campus are on relatively few fringe
questions.The hot button issues we've highlighted com
prise the five percent of on-campus topics that every
body doesn't agree on, and the simple truth is that even
with the enormous diversity of thought on campus, the
vision for Stanford's future is a widely shared one. That
said, we thought we'd run through what we've written
about, trying to put it in that context.
In our first column, we argued that introductory un
dergraduate education would be better served with
dedicated instructors rather than regular faculty. While
this may be the case, the problem is entirely overshad
owed by the unbelievable quality of upper level cours
es once you manage to wade your way out of IHUM
and the Math 50 series.

Next, we took up the concert scene, and although it
still would be nice to have a big name concert in Frost
in this lifetime, the social scene at Stanford is nothing to
complain about, especially when compared to other
universities of similar academic caliber. We definitely
wouldn't trade any other top 10 schools.
Then came ROTC. It's been invited back on campus,
which was probably a good thing. But either way, every

thing would have been all right, and life on campus,
even for those most affected populations, would have
been and will be just fine.
Then we dove into the alcohol policy and especially
personal responsibility. We still believe that the brunt of
the consequences surrounding a drinking incident
should fall on the individual doing the drinking rather
than on the institution enabling it. But taking a step
back and looking at the alcohol policy in a broader con
text, Stanford is an incredibly safe and sheltered place
to learn how to handle alcohol responsibly. Freshmen
RAs are on the student's side, law enforcement is rela
tively lenient and resources are committed to keeping
underage students from drinking irresponsibly rather
than drinking altogether.

We spent two columns on the ASSU election
process, the first on special interest and coalitions and
the second on campaign spending. In our minds, the
