# THE 						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## In Search of Someone Like Me 
### Cristopher Bautista 
I have recently come to this jar
ring realization I don't know
any Asian transmen or very
many transmen of color. I have sev
eral transgender friends at Stan
ford we are a tight-knit commu
nity. They are people whom I treas
ure and who I know care for me. I
have also reached out to other
transgender communities in the
area. But in my adventures both in
side and outside of the Stanford
bubble, I haven't met any Asian
transmen. And as I live in an area
that has a large Asian population,
it's really strange.
Not only am I a transman, but I
am also a transman of color. I am
Asian more specifically, Fil
ipino. I am a first generation Fil
ipino-American my parents
emigrated here from the Philip

pines in the 1980s, and I was born in
1988 down the street in Santa
Clara. I have lived my entire life in
the San Francisco Bay Area. I
come from a predominantly Fil
ipino community, attended schools
where Filipinos were the majority. I
took my ethnicity for granted until
I reached college, when all of a sud
den I was exposed to Caucasian
people and other non-Filipino peo
ple. I came to a place where some
people didn't even know what Fil
ipino was. It was certainly a culture
shock and Stanford is only 20
miles from my hometown.
A lot of my friends have told me
that I'm the first transgender per
son they've ever met, and many of
my readers have emailed me
telling me that my column is their
first exposure to the experiences of

transgender people. However, I
will admit that my experience has
many unique aspects to it, because
I am a transman of color. Not only
have I had to transition, but I have
also had to battle stereotypes sur
rounding Asian men such as
how I am perceived as more femi
nine than other men, less because
I'm trans and more because I'm
Asian (and I think I am very manly,
thank you very much). As an Asian
American, I have also had to con
front the traditional notions of
masculinity presented by both
America and the Philippines. I
have had to face my own insecuri
ties about not feeling attractive
enough because I am not white.
Ever since childhood I have had to
deal with the fact that there are not
many realistic and non-stereotypi

cal portrayals of Asians and Fil
ipinos in media (Filipinos can only
either sing or fight. We can't do
anything else, apparently). And al
though Asia is seen as a very trans
gender-friendly place, it's a culture
dominated mostly by transwomen.
Transmen are virtually invisible,
pushed aside. I am part of a mar
ginalized group within a group that
is marginalized enough already.
And I don't get it I mean,
there has to be other people like
me someplace, in the billions of
people on this earth. I've met many
LGB Asians and Filipinos. Howev
er, strangely enough, I don't know
any Filipino transgender people.
When I came out to my parents, I
remember my dad told me that
there were people like me all over
the Philippines. But where are

they? Are they hiding from me? Is
there some secret, exclusive club of
Filipino transmen that I'm not cool
enough for?
A couple weeks ago, I decided
to reach out beyond Stanford and
find other Asian (especially Fil
ipino) transmen. I joined Tumblr,
connected with Facebook, referred
to Google. I scrolled through web
page after webpage, blog after
blog, forum after forum, and this is
what I found strange: these online
communities were mostly white
transmen. It was alienating. I could
not find somebody like me, even in
something as incredible and vast as

the Internet.
Why am I so preoccupied with
finding other Filipino transmen?
There is something unique about
growing up trans in a Filipino
household. The Catholic culture
(church every Sunday), the family
centered mindset (I can't imagine
living more than twenty miles
away from my parents), the na
tional obsessions (when boxer
Manny Pacquaio fights, the crime
rate literally drops to zero because
everyone in the Philippines is
watching the match. Solution to
our country's problems: have him
fight 24/7.) and don't forget, the
rice (you can't have a complete
meal without rice). 1 have yet to
connect with another Filipino

transman, have yet to share and
compare experiences. I have yet to
discuss with another Filipino
transmen how we are treated com
pared to transmen of other ethnic
ities, about our family situations,
about our relationships with reli
gion, about our role models, about
our love of Filipino food. These are
all things I have wondered about,
all things that I wonder are univer
sal amongst Filipino transmen or
just unique in my own experience.

I'm still searching. I'm not giv
ing up hope.There's got to be a guy
like me out there, someone who
maybe even lives in the SF Bay
Area I could meet up and grab a
cup of coffee with. I would give
anything to meet somebody like
me. I can't be the only one.

I have recently come to this jar
ring realization I don't know
any Asian transmen or very
many transmen of color. I have sev
eral transgender friends at Stan
ford we are a tight-knit commu
nity. They are people whom I treas
ure and who I know care for me. I
have also reached out to other
transgender communities in the
area. But in my adventures both in
side and outside of the Stanford
bubble, I haven't met any Asian
transmen. And as I live in an area
that has a large Asian population,
it's really strange.
Not only am I a transman, but I
am also a transman of color. I am
Asian more specifically, Fil
ipino. I am a first generation Fil
ipino-American my parents
emigrated here from the Philip

pines in the 1980s, and I was born in
1988 down the street in Santa
Clara. I have lived my entire life in
the San Francisco Bay Area. I
come from a predominantly Fil
ipino community, attended schools
where Filipinos were the majority. I
took my ethnicity for granted until
I reached college, when all of a sud
den I was exposed to Caucasian
people and other non-Filipino peo
ple. I came to a place where some
people didn't even know what Fil
ipino was. It was certainly a culture
shock and Stanford is only 20
miles from my hometown.
A lot of my friends have told me
that I'm the first transgender per
son they've ever met, and many of
my readers have emailed me
telling me that my column is their
first exposure to the experiences of

transgender people. However, I
will admit that my experience has
many unique aspects to it, because
I am a transman of color. Not only
have I had to transition, but I have
also had to battle stereotypes sur
rounding Asian men such as
how I am perceived as more femi
nine than other men, less because
I'm trans and more because I'm
Asian (and I think I am very manly,
thank you very much). As an Asian
American, I have also had to con
front the traditional notions of
masculinity presented by both
America and the Philippines. I
have had to face my own insecuri
ties about not feeling attractive
enough because I am not white.
Ever since childhood I have had to
deal with the fact that there are not
many realistic and non-stereotypi

cal portrayals of Asians and Fil
ipinos in media (Filipinos can only
either sing or fight. We can't do
anything else, apparently). And al
though Asia is seen as a very trans
gender-friendly place, it's a culture
dominated mostly by transwomen.
Transmen are virtually invisible,
pushed aside. I am part of a mar
ginalized group within a group that
is marginalized enough already.
And I don't get it I mean,
there has to be other people like
me someplace, in the billions of
people on this earth. I've met many
LGB Asians and Filipinos. Howev
er, strangely enough, I don't know
any Filipino transgender people.
When I came out to my parents, I
remember my dad told me that
there were people like me all over
the Philippines. But where are

they? Are they hiding from me? Is
there some secret, exclusive club of
Filipino transmen that I'm not cool
enough for?
A couple weeks ago, I decided
to reach out beyond Stanford and
find other Asian (especially Fil
ipino) transmen. I joined Tumblr,
connected with Facebook, referred
to Google. I scrolled through web
page after webpage, blog after
blog, forum after forum, and this is
what I found strange: these online
communities were mostly white
transmen. It was alienating. I could
not find somebody like me, even in
something as incredible and vast as

the Internet.
Why am I so preoccupied with
finding other Filipino transmen?
There is something unique about
growing up trans in a Filipino
household. The Catholic culture
(church every Sunday), the family
centered mindset (I can't imagine
living more than twenty miles
away from my parents), the na
tional obsessions (when boxer
Manny Pacquaio fights, the crime
rate literally drops to zero because
everyone in the Philippines is
watching the match. Solution to
our country's problems: have him
fight 24/7.) and don't forget, the
rice (you can't have a complete
meal without rice). 1 have yet to
