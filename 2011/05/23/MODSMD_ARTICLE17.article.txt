5/22, Smith Family Stadium

No. 11 Stanford's stars stepped
up when it counted, particularly
sophomore pitcher Teagan Ger
hart. Showing why she was named
to the Pac-10 and All-West Region
First Teams last week, Gerhart
pitched three complete-game wins
for the Card, allowing just two runs
and 11 hits over 21 innings of work.
The three decisions move her to 25-
11 on the year. The team itself
moved to 41-15 (10-11 Pac-10), se
curing its twelfth 40-win season in
school history.
Fellow All-West First-Team
members Jenna Rich and Ashley
Flansen also played well for the
Card, accounting for six of the
team's nine RBI. Hansen, a junior
who leads the nation in batting av
erage and was recently named Pac
-10 Player of the Year, went 4-10
with 3 runs scored. Rich finished
with 4 RBI, at least one in every
game.
"Winning this weekend was a
huge feat for us," Rich said. "It will
provide a lot of momentum going
into Supers next week. Despite the
expected hostile environment
awaiting us in Alabama, we plan on
playing our game and taking care of
business."

Stanford opened the tournament
with a 3-0 shutout of Big West Con

ference champion Pacific (37-19),
beating the Tigers for the second
time this year. Gerhart stymied the
Pacific offense, allowing just three
hits and giving up no walks while
striking out four.

All three of the Cardinal's runs
came in the bottom of the third dur
ing a two-out rally, as Stanford capi
talized on a pair of Pacific errors.
Teagan Gerhart started the rally
when she reached on an error by Pa

cific first baseman Nicole Matson.
Junior centerfielder Sarah Hassman
singled weakly to third and reached
second on a throwing error, and
Gerhart scored on the play. Hansen
kept the inning alive with a single up
the middle setting up Rich, who
promptly doubled to centerfield,
plating Hassman and Hansen. Pacif
ic's Nikki Armagost (19-10) was sad
dled with the loss despite allowing
no earned runs and just four hits and

a walk.
Saturday's game was a slightly
closer affair against Fresno State
(35-19), which earned an at-large
berth to the postseason. Gerhart
once again pitched a three-hit com
plete game for the win, although this
game she gave up a solo home run to
Fresno's Nicole Angene.
The Cardinal struck first in the
top of the third. Teagan Gerhart led
off the inning with a walk and then
stole second. After Hassman
popped out, consecutive singles by
Rich, Flansen and freshman left
fielder Caitlyn Pura scored Ger
hart and Rich, giving Stanford a 2-
0 lead.
Stanford added another run in
the sixth when senior first baseman
Melisa Koutz singled in Pura. Stan
ford went on to load the bases with
no outs but failed to do any addition
al damage. Fresno State's Michelle
Moses failed to turn the game
around, taking the loss to move to
16-12.
Stanford needed to take just one
of two from No. 16 Nebraska (41-15)
Sunday, but made the second game
unnecessary with a 4-1 win. Gerhart
was solid in the circle, giving up one
run on five hits and a walk. Stanford
wrung nine hits and three walks
from the Cornhuskers' Ashley
Hagemann, moving her to 31-13 on
the year.
Stanford threatened in the third,
loading the bases with one out, but
Hagemann retired the formidable
duo of Hansen and Rich to escape
the jam. Hansen wouldn't be kept
down long, as she singled home Tea
gan Gerhart in the top of the fifth to
break the tie. Nebraska responded
in the sixth when second baseman
Julie Brechtel hit a solo shot that
tied the game at 1-1.
Hansen once again stepped up in
the final frame, driving in junior
third baseman Jenna Becerra for the
go-ahead run. Rich picked up an
RBI as her groundout to second
