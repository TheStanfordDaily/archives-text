# Card ekes out win over Arizona
## One run the decider against Wildcats 
### MIKE LAZARUS STAFF WRITER 
A few inches can be the differ
ence in a weekend of baseball. If
freshman right-fielder Austin Wil
son's two-out eighth-inning
groundball had been hit just a few
inches farther left, it would have
ended up in Arizona third baseman
Seth Mejias-Brean's web, and the
heartbreak would have continued
for Stanford.
But the ball bounced off the tip
of Mejias-Brean's glove, allowing
sophomore left-fielder Tyler
Gaffney to score the game-winning
run all the way from second and
giving No. 25 Stanford (30-19,12-
12 Pac-10) a series victory over No.
27 Arizona (33-19,12-12 Pac-10).
The game up until Wilson's sin
gle had been absolute torture.

Other than a solo shot in the sec
ond inning, junior pitcher Jordan
Pries was masterful. The righty
pitched seven innings of one-run
ball, allowing seven hits and strik
ing out six. Yet the offense blew op
portunity after opportunity.

"I threw a ton of changeups,"
Pries said. "Normally I'm mixing
everything, but today I was focus
ing on getting first pitch strikes and
staying ahead of batters."
Despite several hard-hit balls
right at Wildcat defenders, Stan
ford could not deliver the key hit.
The Cardinal stranded two runners
in the second, and sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger hit
into an inning-ending double play
in the fifth.

In the sixth, though, it became
apparent that the baseball gods

simply weren't on Pries' side. Se
nior catcher Zach Jones singled to
lead off the inning, and senior des
ignated hitter Ben Clowe sacri
ficed him over to second on the
first of his two sacrifice bunts in the
game. Gaffney then scorched a line
drive up the middle that would
have gone into center field and
surely plated the speedy Jones. But
in a cruel twist of fate, the ball rico
cheted off Arizona starter Konner
Wade's thigh, forcing Jones to stop
at third. One pitch later, sopho
more third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty hit into a 6-4-3 double play to
end the inning and prolong the suf
fering.
"Being a junior, I've had plenty
of outings where I haven't had
much run support," Pries said.
"You can't really let that get to you.
Whether you get the win or not, it's
not something you can control. Just
have to focus on throwing another
zero on the board."

In the seventh, the Cardinal's
offensive ineptitude simply be

came comical. After freshman first
baseman Brian Ragira and Wilson
led off the inning with singles, it
looked like Stanford could finally
make a winner out of Pries. Once
again, the Cardinal found a new
way not to score. Freshman second
baseman Lonnie Kauppila failed
to get down a sacrifice bunt, flying
out to center on a two-strike count.
Ragira and Wilson did not ad
vance, as sophomore outfielder
Jake Stewart and Diekroeger flied
out quietly into the sunny after
noon.
Finally in the eighth, Stanford
broke through. After Jones ad
vanced to second on another
Clowe bunt, Gaffney brought him
home with a single through the left
side to tie the game. Two batters
later, Wilson found just enough
room to send the Sunken Diamond
faithful home with a win.
Junior closer Chris Reed
recorded the final six outs in
cluding a perfect ninth to pre
serve the victory.
Stanford took the first game of
the series Friday night in another
nail-biter highlighted by more
dominant Cardinal pitching, this
time by sophomore Mark Appel,
who threw eight shutout innings
and tied a career-high with nine
strikeouts.
Once again, Stanford could not
find away to score until extra in
nings. In the bottom of the
eleventh, tied 0-0, pinch hitter
Brett Doran stepped to the plate
with the bases loaded after a walk,
a hit-by-pitch and another walk.
The freshman showed no nerves,
blasting a single off the left field
wall for a walk-off hit.
Arizona tied the series on Sat
urday, taking advantage of unchar
acteristically sloppy Cardinal base
ball with a 7-3 victory. Wildcat
starter Kyle Simon outdueled Stan
ford senior Danny Sandbrink, scat
tering eight hits over 7.1 innings
and striking out four. Simon baf
fled Cardinal hitters with off-speed
and breaking pitches throughout
the game, getting into a bit of trou
ble in the eighth before reliever
Matt Chaffee closed things out and
earned the save.
Wilson and Stanford would
have the last laugh, though, win
ning by the narrowest of margins
on Sunday. Stanford closes out its
regular season in the Bay Area,
heading to Cal Poly on Tuesday
and facing Cal for a three-game se
ries next weekend.

Sophomore left-fielder Tyler Gaffney, above, scored the game-winning run in Sunday's game against Arizona, in
a thriller until the final at-bat. The win clinched the series for the Card in a battle for conference position.
A few inches can be the differ
ence in a weekend of baseball. If
freshman right-fielder Austin Wil
son's two-out eighth-inning
groundball had been hit just a few
inches farther left, it would have
ended up in Arizona third baseman
Seth Mejias-Brean's web, and the
heartbreak would have continued
for Stanford.
But the ball bounced off the tip
of Mejias-Brean's glove, allowing
sophomore left-fielder Tyler
Gaffney to score the game-winning
run all the way from second and
giving No. 25 Stanford (30-19,12-
12 Pac-10) a series victory over No.
27 Arizona (33-19,12-12 Pac-10).
The game up until Wilson's sin
gle had been absolute torture.

Other than a solo shot in the sec
ond inning, junior pitcher Jordan
Pries was masterful. The righty
pitched seven innings of one-run
ball, allowing seven hits and strik
ing out six. Yet the offense blew op
portunity after opportunity.

"I threw a ton of changeups,"
Pries said. "Normally I'm mixing
everything, but today I was focus
ing on getting first pitch strikes and
staying ahead of batters."
Despite several hard-hit balls
right at Wildcat defenders, Stan
ford could not deliver the key hit.
The Cardinal stranded two runners
in the second, and sophomore
shortstop Kenny Diekroeger hit
into an inning-ending double play
in the fifth.

In the sixth, though, it became
apparent that the baseball gods

simply weren't on Pries' side. Se
nior catcher Zach Jones singled to
lead off the inning, and senior des
ignated hitter Ben Clowe sacri
ficed him over to second on the
first of his two sacrifice bunts in the
game. Gaffney then scorched a line
drive up the middle that would
have gone into center field and
surely plated the speedy Jones. But
in a cruel twist of fate, the ball rico
cheted off Arizona starter Konner
Wade's thigh, forcing Jones to stop
at third. One pitch later, sopho
more third baseman Stephen Pis
cotty hit into a 6-4-3 double play to
end the inning and prolong the suf
fering.
"Being a junior, I've had plenty
of outings where I haven't had
much run support," Pries said.
"You can't really let that get to you.
Whether you get the win or not, it's
not something you can control. Just
have to focus on throwing another
zero on the board."

In the seventh, the Cardinal's
offensive ineptitude simply be

came comical. After freshman first
baseman Brian Ragira and Wilson
led off the inning with singles, it
looked like Stanford could finally
make a winner out of Pries. Once
again, the Cardinal found a new
way not to score. Freshman second
baseman Lonnie Kauppila failed
to get down a sacrifice bunt, flying
out to center on a two-strike count.
Ragira and Wilson did not ad
vance, as sophomore outfielder
Jake Stewart and Diekroeger flied
out quietly into the sunny after
noon.
Finally in the eighth, Stanford
broke through. After Jones ad
vanced to second on another
Clowe bunt, Gaffney brought him
home with a single through the left
side to tie the game. Two batters
later, Wilson found just enough
room to send the Sunken Diamond
faithful home with a win.
Junior closer Chris Reed
recorded the final six outs in
cluding a perfect ninth to pre
serve the victory.
Stanford took the first game of
the series Friday night in another
nail-biter highlighted by more
dominant Cardinal pitching, this
time by sophomore Mark Appel,
who threw eight shutout innings
and tied a career-high with nine
strikeouts.
Once again, Stanford could not
find away to score until extra in
nings. In the bottom of the
eleventh, tied 0-0, pinch hitter
Brett Doran stepped to the plate
with the bases loaded after a walk,
a hit-by-pitch and another walk.
The freshman showed no nerves,
blasting a single off the left field
wall for a walk-off hit.
Arizona tied the series on Sat
urday, taking advantage of unchar
acteristically sloppy Cardinal base
ball with a 7-3 victory. Wildcat
starter Kyle Simon outdueled Stan
ford senior Danny Sandbrink, scat
tering eight hits over 7.1 innings
and striking out four. Simon baf
fled Cardinal hitters with off-speed
and breaking pitches throughout
the game, getting into a bit of trou
ble in the eighth before reliever
Matt Chaffee closed things out and
earned the save.
Wilson and Stanford would
have the last laugh, though, win
ning by the narrowest of margins
on Sunday. Stanford closes out its
regular season in the Bay Area,
heading to Cal Poly on Tuesday
and facing Cal for a three-game se
ries next weekend.
