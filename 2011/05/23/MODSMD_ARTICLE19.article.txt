# Tennis loss' silver lining
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
To the layman, the Stanford
men's tennis team's loss to
Virginia on Saturday was
simply another end to an
other season. However,
those who were at the match know
that it was one of the most exciting
sporting events anyone could ask for.
In fact, I've been at Stanford for
five years, and there are few games
that I can think of — in any sport
that matched the atmosphere and
tension at Taube Tennis Center on
Saturday.
To give you some perspective, No.
8 Stanford was playing No. 1 Virginia
in the quarterfinals of the men's ten
nis championships, which are being
played on the Farm this year. Virginia
came into the match undefeated
the Cavaliers hadn't played a close
match all season. They had absolutely
killed everyone they played. No play
er on their team dropped more than
three singles matches all season.Their
No. 2 singles player, Alex Domijan,
was 25-0 in dual matches. The Cava
liers' tightest matches of the year
were a trio of 5-2 victories back in
March.
The point is, Virginia was a heavy
favorite.
Early on, it looked like Virginia
was going to cruise to another victory
by quickly grabbing the doubles point
and earning wins at No. 6 and No. 4.
The Cardinal had its back against the
wall, down 3-0. But behind an electric
crowd led by costumed frat guys (an
elephant, a tiger, Spongeßob, etc.),
Stanford rallied. Junior Ryan
Thacher handed Domijan his first
loss of the year, and fellow junior
Bradley Klahn dispatched Michael
Shabaz at No. 1. When sophomore
Matt Kandath won at No. 5, the match
came down to two seniors on court
three: Stanford's Alex Clayton and
Virginia's Sanam Singh.
Although Clayton took the first
set and was up a break in the second,
Singh came back to square the match,
and after four deuces, he broke Clay
ton in the third set. Singh held serve to
take the final set 6-3, ending Stan
ford's season.
But the atmosphere surrounding
Clayton's match was special. In the
post-match press conference, Singh
said that it was the rowdiest crowd he
has ever faced.
"I've played in some very hostile
environments before," Singh said,
"but that was probably the most hos
tile I've ever played in. Everything
was stacked against us."
Between points, Stanford fans
