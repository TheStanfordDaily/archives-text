## RCCs talk computer problems Cluster; network issues most common complaints 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
As the University's first line of
defense for all computer and tech
nology-related issues, Resident
Computer Consultants (RCCs)
regularly face a huge number of
computing problems as they keep
students printing, surfing and cod
ing. According to several RCCs,
the most common issues this year
were maintaining residence com
puter clusters and registering In
ternet-enabled devices for net
work access.

Computer clusters posed the
most issues to RCCs this year, as al
most every RCC noted problems
with the computers' reliability and
speed.
"They're slow, and they're often
buggy. I've had the [cluster] com
puters re-imaged several times,"
said Soto RCC Matt Chun-Lum
'l2.

Though information from a Stu
dent Computing Services (SCS)
survey indicated that students
asked most frequently about com
puter cluster printers, Academic
Computing Consulting Services
Manager Sherwin Smith pointed
out that questions do not necessar
ily correlate with problems. He
also noted that problems are ex
pected with frequent use.
"The top questions asked of
RCCs were about the wireless net
work and cluster printers, which is
consistent with our understanding
that the wireless network and cen
tralized printing are two of the
most widely used technology serv
ices at Stanford," Smith wrote in an
email to The Daily.
Many RCCs were impressed
with the support that University
technical teams gave for clusters in
anticipation of and response to
problems.
"Stanford provides pretty qual
ity, excellent service consistently,"
said Joe Domenici 'l3, an RCC in
Stern Hall.
"It does a pretty awesome job
of keeping things running smooth
ly," he added.
The busiest time of any RCC's
year is at the start, when personal
printers and networks need to be
set up. Many RCCs expressed frus
tration with the registration sys
tem, although many admitted that
reading directions more carefully
could solve these problems.
"At least half of the dorm came
to me with registration questions. A
lot of times they were legitimate
questions in the sense that the regis
tration system is fairly faulty, espe
cially for Windows machines," said
Matei Daian 'l2, the RCC in Cas

tano.
Other RCCs discussed similar
problems in which they had to by
pass the registration system entire
ly in order to get students online.
However, according to the SCS
survey, only 2.3 percent of students
found the registration process diffi
cult. Smith said even with such low
numbers, residential computing is
still looking to improve the service
based on what students are saying.
"Alongside the quantitative
data, we are also paying close at
tention to the qualitative answers
that students provided in order to
find ways to improve our services,"
he said.
However many day-to-day
computer problems are, to some
extent, beyond the University's
domain. Countless hours are spent
networking printers and getting
rid of malware.
"Most of the problems are com
mon sense. They're more to do
with users than actual technical
problems," Chun-Lum said.
