Saturday's Society, Technology, Art and Nature (STAN) conference brought together a number of Stanford-affiliated
speakers and artistic performers. STAN was modeled after the popular 'TED talks.' Big names headlining STAN included
David Hornik, a venture capitalist at August Capital, and women's basketball head coach Tara VanDerveer.
