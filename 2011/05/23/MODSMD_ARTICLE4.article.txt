Several Stanford websites were taken offline
May 9 after being targeted by hackers looking to
sell cheap software. The affected sites, currently
offline and inaccessible, are those for the Stanford
Concert Network, the Green Alliance for Innova
tive Action and the ASSU.

According to Rowan Chakoumakos 'l3, chief
technical officer for Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE), the Stanford Information Security Office
(ISO) generally handles issues related to the Uni
versity's network security.

"Since the webmasters of the respective sites
did not remove the content in the designated time
set by the Stanford Information Security Office,
the websites were taken offline," Chakoumakos
wrote in an email to The Daily.
The main University website was unaffected.
Tina Darmohray, Stanford's chief information
security officer, said the ISO alerted SSE after the
initial intrusion, based on the contact information
attached to the machine.

"We could chuck out a very short-term patch,
but what we want to do is go in and implement a
more long-term solution," said the ASSU Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3.

He added that the main ASSU website will
likely be down until a comprehensive update is
implemented during the summer. However, sev
eral critical functionalities have been restored,
namely the Old Union room reservation system,
bookings for the ASSU airport shuttle and the
SSE website. With those services online, Macgre
gor-Dennis predicted that keeping the main web
site down would have a "marginal" impact on
ASSU operations.

"Because of a lack of investment in security in
the ASSU websites and servers, we need to go
back to some of the basics and look at the actual
server software that's on there," Macgregor-Den
nis said. "If we tried to just fix it straightaway, then
someone would just hack it again within a few
hours."
The hackers targeted Stanford
and other high-profile websites,
including websites for NASA,
Syracuse University and North
eastern University. These efforts
were part of an attempt to "flog,"
or sell, cheap versions of Adobe's
Creative Suite and other software
products. The scammers filled the
pages with nonsense text and
links to other hacked pages.
"Black hat SEOs [search en
gine optimizers] were simply try
ing to insert links to improve
search engine results for a web
site," Chakoumakos said. "Both
.edu and .gov domains are com
monly targeted due to the high
'Page Rank' assigned to them by
Google."
