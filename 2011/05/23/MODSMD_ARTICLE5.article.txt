## MEN'S TENNIS ELIMINATED IN HEARTBREAKER

The Stanford men's tennis team
fell on Saturday afternoon to top
ranked and undefeated Virginia in a
gut wrenching confrontation that
came down to the last match a
duel between two seniors. The No. 8
Cardinal laid it all out on the court
early Saturday evening, but its best
effort came up just short. UVA de

were lengthening over the Taube
Tennis Center.

It was a match that people will
long remember and a match that
was on the brink of going down in
the great trove of Stanford tennis
annals as one of the most memo
rable wins in recent years but it
was just not meant to be.
Building on the electric atmos

The deciding match against Virginia pitched senior Alex

that ended with a loss for Stanford.
matches as, on several occasions, the
chair umpires had to ask for deco
rum in the stadium to be main-

tained.
UVA senior standout Sanam
Singh the man who struck the
winning shot for the Cavaliers in his
back-and-forth decisive match
against Stanford senior Alex Clay
ton said as much in his postgame
news conference.

"We knew going into the match
that it was going to be very hostile,"
he said. I've played in some very
hostile environments before, but
that was probably the most hostile
I've ever played in. Everything was
stacked against us."
Much of Stanford's (21-6) suc
cess this season rested on its excel
lent doubles play; the Cardinal's cu
mulative dual-match doubles record
heading into the NCAA tourna
ment was an impressive 48-16. But
on Saturday against UVA (33-0),
just as on Thursday against A&M,
Stanford lost the doubles point.
Heading into singles play after
losing the often pivotal doubles
point can be difficult, and the Cardi
nal showed that on Saturday, quick
ly losing two matches on the fourth
and sixth courts to go down 3-0
on the brink of a speedy exit. But
then Stanford's upperclassmen and
top singles players asserted them
selves.

Junior Ryan Thacher was the
first to post a point for the Cardinal,
dispatching the towering Alex
Domijan, ranked No. 2 nationally,
forThacher's most impressive victo
ry of the year. Thacher's win gave
the crowd and his teammates
critical momentum. Fellow junior
Bradley Klahn's straight-set dis
mantling of fifth-ranked Michael
Shabaz followed Thacher's victory.
Stanford was then firmly back in the
match and down just one point. Sev
eral tension-filled minutes later, a
vociferous cheer erupted from the
back courts at Taube, signaling that
sophomore Matt Kandath, playing
on court five, had just outlasted his
opponent Justin Shane and
emerged victorious in their closely
contested, three-set affair.
Suddenly, Stanford and Virginia
were tied, three points apiece, and
the Cardinal was just one win away
from pulling off the upset. All eyes

turned to court three, where the two
seniors, Singh and Clayton, were
battling to see which team would ad
vance to the semifinals.

Clayton holds a special place in
the heart of head coach John
Whitlinger, having been the nation's
most prized recruit coming out of
high school in 2006 and becoming a
key building block in Whitlinger's
revival of the team.
"We're going to miss Alex Clay
ton," Whitlinger said. "He's a special
human being. He's like a son to me.
It hasn't always been easy for Alex
at Stanford, and his biggest legacy is
where he's leaving this program and
the foundation that we've built."
Clayton's match against Singh
was an intense and hard-fought en
deavor from the very beginning.
Singh complained to the chair um
pire in the first couple games of the
first set about the rowdiness of the
crowd, prompting two warnings
the first directed at Stanford's legion
of supporters and the second to the
UVA delegation of fans.
Clayton was able to convert a key
break chance late in the first set to
secure the 6-3 win. The second set
was even more closely contested,
with the match hanging in the bal
ance at 4-4. Singh proved himself ca
pable of dealing with Clayton's
tenacity and the crowd's distraction,

upping his game for the match's piv
otal stretch drive.

"After 4-4 in the second set, I
kind of found my second gear," he
said.

He would need all of that second
gear after winning the second set 6-
4 and heading into the decisive third
set with the entire fate of the two
teams' tournament hopes hanging
in the balance of this one set.
The final set of the final match
could have gone either way, with
each player threatening to break the
other's serve early in the set, only to
be foiled and exchange games.
Eventually, Clayton was the first
man to blink, losing his serve in the
set's eighth game, allowing Singh to
grab a 5-3 lead and serve for the
match.

When Singh's forehand skidded
past the outstretched racket of Clay
ton after a breathtaking exchange,
the Cavalier lifted his arms in victo
ry, and his jubilant teammates
swarmed around him. Stanford had
lost, but the team had put up an
amazing fight.
After the match was over,
Whitlinger put the loss in perspec
tive.

"I told the group, 'You can look
yourselves in the mirror and be
happy about yourselves.' We almost
pulled it off, and it would've been
awesome, but it just came up a little
short."

For senior Alex Clayton, his final
Stanford team match may have
ended in defeat. But more impor
tant things remain.
"It's hard being done," Clayton
said. "I've never teared up after a
match before in my life, and this is
the first time. This place has given
me so much, and I can never be
thankful enough. To get here, and
push the No. 1 team to the very end,
in the final match, at home, is the
most incredible experience I've ever
had in tennis."

Stanford's team season may be
over, but Klahn and Thacher will
each compete in the individual and
doubles tournaments later this
week. The singles competition be
gins on Wednesday, and doubles
starts on Thursday.
