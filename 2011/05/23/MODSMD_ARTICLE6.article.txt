### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a nail-biting match against
Northwestern in the round of 16,
the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team rallied to continue its quest for
a back-to-back national champi
onship with a victory over Georgia
in the quarterfinals Sunday after
noon.

Feeling confident and on its
home courts, Stanford (27-0, 8-0
Pac-10) didn't quite expect the chal
lenge it faced in moving past the re
lentless 16th-seeded Wildcats (22-8)
on Friday night.
Stanford dropped the doubles
point for the fourth time all season at
the start of the long battle. Though
Stanford's No. 1 doubles pair of sen
ior Hilary Barte and sophomore
Mallory Burdette clinched an 8-5
victory in doubles, freshmen Nicole
Gibbs and junior Veronica Li
dropped their set 5-8 to Northwest
ern as senior Carolyn McVeigh and
Tan were also defeated 6-8.
