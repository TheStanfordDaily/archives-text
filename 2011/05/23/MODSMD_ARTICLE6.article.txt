# WOMEN'S TENNIS AT FULL THROTTLE IN 4-0 WIN
## 
### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a nail-biting match against
Northwestern in the round of 16,
the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team rallied to continue its quest for
a back-to-back national champi
onship with a victory over Georgia
in the quarterfinals Sunday after
noon.

Feeling confident and on its
home courts, Stanford (27-0, 8-0
Pac-10) didn't quite expect the chal
lenge it faced in moving past the re
lentless 16th-seeded Wildcats (22-8)
on Friday night.
Stanford dropped the doubles
point for the fourth time all season at
the start of the long battle. Though
Stanford's No. 1 doubles pair of sen
ior Hilary Barte and sophomore
Mallory Burdette clinched an 8-5
victory in doubles, freshmen Nicole
Gibbs and junior Veronica Li
dropped their set 5-8 to Northwest
ern as senior Carolyn McVeigh and
Tan were also defeated 6-8.

Senior Hilary Barte, above, won her doubles and singles
matches on Friday and Sunday, helping the Card
clinch a close win against Northwestern and solid victory
over Georgia.
The score continued to flip-flop
as Gibbs tied the match at 1-1 with
her straight-set victory. However,
Tan's loss to Northwestern's Kate
Turvy on court four put Stanford
down 1-2 as the Cardinal found it
self in an unfamiliar position. The
top of the ladder came on strong,
however, as Barte and Burdette
captured wins to propel Stanford
into the lead for the first time all
night. Li and McVeigh were both in
very tight matches at the No. 5 and
6 spots as the home crowd watched
anxiously.
"It was nerve-wracking," said
Tan, who watched hopefully after
her loss. "Northwestern stepped up
their game and came out ready to
play with nothing to lose. I believed
that my teammates would give 100
percent and pull it out."
That's exactly what McVeigh
did, finally clinching the win for the
Cardinal at 1:34 a.m. as she breezed
through the third set and defeated
the Wildcats' Stacey Lee 7-5,3-6,6-
1. Li and Northwestern's Linda
Abu Mushrefova's match was un
finished after the Cardinal finally
secured a victory at 4-2.
Relieved to have survived the
potential upset it faced, the Cardi
nal looked to focus all its attention
on yesterday's quarterfinals match
against No. 8 Georgia (19-4), a team
that has made 26 straight NCAA
Tournament appearances.
Stanford appeared to have
reawakened after its Friday night
battle, sweeping the Bulldogs 4-0.
"We were definitely more in
spired to go out there and give it
all our effort," Tan said. "We did
not want to play hesitantly. There
were going to be nerves, but we
needed to go out there and do
what we've been doing all year

long: do our job."
The undefeated Cardinal was
not going to let the doubles point
slip away again. Barte and Burdette
clinched a fast win on court one, 8-
1. At one point, however, McVeigh
and Tan were down 1-3 before
bouncing back to secure the dou
bles point with their 8-5 win. Court
two's match was suspended at 7-7.
"I was really motivated, espe
cially after losing my match on Fri
day, to show the team that I'm going
to do my best," Tan said.
"[McVeigh] and I stuck to our game
plan, played solid tennis, and did
not make too many errors."
It was then on to singles as Tan,
supported by a fired up crowd, led
the charge with a 6-0, 6-0 domina
tion over Georgia's Cameron Ellis.
Barte defeated Chelsey Gullickson
at the No. 1 spot, with Gibbs closing
up the match by beating Maho
Kowase 6-2,6-3.
The Cardinal keeps rolling as it
faces No. 5-seeded Baylor (28-3)

which defeated 4th-seeded
North Carolina yesterday in the
semifinals this afternoon. The win
ner of that match will face the vic
tor of No. 6-seeded UCLA (22-5)
and No. 2-seeded Florida (29-1) in
the championship on Tuesday af
ternoon. Stanford has already de
feated both North Carolina and
Florida this season with victories
at the ITA National Team Indoor
Championships. They have not
faced Baylor.
Before learning the result of the
North Carolina-Baylor match. Tan
said that the Cardinal will focus on
itself going into tomorrow's semifi
nal.
"I think that we will be ready to
face either team," she said. "No
matter the outcome, we will pre
pare ourselves to play our best."
The show continues at 4 p.m.
today at the Taube Tennis Center.

noon.

Feeling confident and on its
home courts, Stanford (27-0, 8-0
Pac-10) didn't quite expect the chal
lenge it faced in moving past the re
lentless 16th-seeded Wildcats (22-8)
on Friday night.
Stanford dropped the doubles
point for the fourth time all season at
the start of the long battle. Though
Stanford's No. 1 doubles pair of sen
ior Hilary Barte and sophomore
Mallory Burdette clinched an 8-5
victory in doubles, freshmen Nicole
Gibbs and junior Veronica Li
dropped their set 5-8 to Northwest
ern as senior Carolyn McVeigh and
Tan were also defeated 6-8.

Senior Hilary Barte, above, won her doubles and singles
matches on Friday and Sunday, helping the Card
clinch a close win against Northwestern and solid victory
over Georgia.
The score continued to flip-flop
as Gibbs tied the match at 1-1 with
her straight-set victory. However,
Tan's loss to Northwestern's Kate
Turvy on court four put Stanford
down 1-2 as the Cardinal found it
self in an unfamiliar position. The
top of the ladder came on strong,
however, as Barte and Burdette
captured wins to propel Stanford
into the lead for the first time all
night. Li and McVeigh were both in
very tight matches at the No. 5 and
6 spots as the home crowd watched
anxiously.
"It was nerve-wracking," said
Tan, who watched hopefully after
her loss. "Northwestern stepped up
their game and came out ready to
play with nothing to lose. I believed
that my teammates would give 100
percent and pull it out."
That's exactly what McVeigh
did, finally clinching the win for the
Cardinal at 1:34 a.m. as she breezed
through the third set and defeated
the Wildcats' Stacey Lee 7-5,3-6,6-
1. Li and Northwestern's Linda
Abu Mushrefova's match was un
finished after the Cardinal finally
secured a victory at 4-2.
Relieved to have survived the
potential upset it faced, the Cardi
nal looked to focus all its attention
on yesterday's quarterfinals match
against No. 8 Georgia (19-4), a team
that has made 26 straight NCAA
Tournament appearances.
Stanford appeared to have
reawakened after its Friday night
battle, sweeping the Bulldogs 4-0.
"We were definitely more in
spired to go out there and give it
all our effort," Tan said. "We did
not want to play hesitantly. There
were going to be nerves, but we
needed to go out there and do
what we've been doing all year

long: do our job."
The undefeated Cardinal was
not going to let the doubles point
slip away again. Barte and Burdette
clinched a fast win on court one, 8-
1. At one point, however, McVeigh
and Tan were down 1-3 before
bouncing back to secure the dou
bles point with their 8-5 win. Court
two's match was suspended at 7-7.
"I was really motivated, espe
cially after losing my match on Fri
day, to show the team that I'm going
to do my best," Tan said.
"[McVeigh] and I stuck to our game
plan, played solid tennis, and did
not make too many errors."
It was then on to singles as Tan,
supported by a fired up crowd, led
the charge with a 6-0, 6-0 domina
tion over Georgia's Cameron Ellis.
Barte defeated Chelsey Gullickson
at the No. 1 spot, with Gibbs closing
up the match by beating Maho
Kowase 6-2,6-3.
The Cardinal keeps rolling as it
faces No. 5-seeded Baylor (28-3)

which defeated 4th-seeded
North Carolina yesterday in the
semifinals this afternoon. The win
ner of that match will face the vic
tor of No. 6-seeded UCLA (22-5)
and No. 2-seeded Florida (29-1) in
the championship on Tuesday af
ternoon. Stanford has already de
feated both North Carolina and
Florida this season with victories
at the ITA National Team Indoor
Championships. They have not
faced Baylor.
Before learning the result of the
North Carolina-Baylor match. Tan
said that the Cardinal will focus on
itself going into tomorrow's semifi
nal.
"I think that we will be ready to
face either team," she said. "No
matter the outcome, we will pre
pare ourselves to play our best."
The show continues at 4 p.m.
today at the Taube Tennis Center.
