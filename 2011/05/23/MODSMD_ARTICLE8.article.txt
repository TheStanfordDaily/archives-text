Stanford's College Student Interest Group in Neurology (Co-SIGN) hosted
a conference on neural prosthetics at the School of Medicine on Saturday
morning. The event, titled "Mind over Matter," brought attention to
a number of new developments in biomedical research. The focus of the
conference was on devices designed to help reverse impaired neurological
function and brought together prominent researchers from Stanford
and elsewhere to share their findings. Ophthalmology associate professor
Daniel Palanker explained the latest research in "optoelectronic retinal
implants," a device that uses images from video goggles projected
onto subretinal implants which then convert the images into an electric
current that can be recognized by the brain.
