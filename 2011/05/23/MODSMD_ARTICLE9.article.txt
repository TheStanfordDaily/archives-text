## Stanford 'has no right' to save janitors' jobs 
### SARAH FLAMM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On June 3, 29 Stanford janitors
are set to lose their jobs because
they are unable to meet the back
ground checks required by the Uni
versity's new janitorial subcontrac
tor, UGL (UNICCO) Janitorial
Services.
The University "will not inter
fere with the agreement and has no
right to do so," said Jeff Wachtel,
senior assistant to University Presi
dent John Hennessy. "This is not a
choice of the University, and we can
take no action."
According to Wachtel, UGL and
Local 1877, a chapter of the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) that represents the work
ers, mutually agreed upon a resolu
tion to the dispute. Under this
agreement, the janitors are slated to
lose their jobs. The union did not re
spond to requests for comment
from The Daily, and UGL said it
had no comment at this time.
The Student Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC), a student group
that has been advocating on behalf
of the janitors over the past several
months, has requested that the Uni
versity intervene to protect these
workers jobs. In a petition created
by SLAC and sent to Stanford and
UGL last December, some 2,000

Stanford community members
signed a statement that read,
"Workers should retain their em
ployment and the wages and bene
fits associated with their seniority
rights through a subcontracting
transition."
Stanford is attempting to re
move itself from these disputes,
which stem from its switch last No
vember to UGL from its previous
services subcontractor, ABM. At
the time, the University explained
the change by saying that UGL
would provide superior services.
Under an agreement with SEIU,
UGL was contractually obligated to
offer all ABM workers the opportu
nity to keep their jobs and initiated
an employment process to rehire
the workers. The employment
process consisted of background
checks on all 134 of the employees
in order to verify each individual's
identity as well as to check for any
criminal history.
According to a letter from UGL
to Stanford, which Wachtel provid
ed to The Daily, one of the purposes
of the process was to ensure that all
employees were lawfully eligible to
be employed in the United States
and that UGL complied with feder
al laws covering immigration and
employment.
One of those laws is the Immi
gration and Nationality Act, which
prohibits hiring anyone who is an
"unauthorized alien." Employers
must verify using "a form designat
ed or established by the Attorney
General by regulation" that the in
dividual is legally eligible to work in
the country.
Eric Griffis 'l2, a member of
SLAC, noted that an 1-9 form
which does not ask for a Social Se
curity number meets verifica
tion requirements, but that UGL
instead chose to use a system called
"E-Verify." That system issues "no
match" letters if a database detects
a mismatch between Social Securi
ty numbers provided on W-2 forms
with the Social Security Adminis
tration's records. UGL asked for I
-9 forms later on in the process.

In the letter to Stanford, UGL
wrote that its background checks
could not verify the identity of 30 of
the employees. After negotiations
between UGL and SEIU, the em
ployees were given until June 3 to

provide documentation establish
ing their eligibility to work in the
U.S. According to the settlement,
UGL will provide the workers
whose jobs will be terminated with
severance pay.

UGL also refuted allegations
that it is seeking to lay off more sen
ior workers, who are entitled to
higher pay and superior benefits
than newer hires, in its letter to the
administration. The gap in wages
can be fairly significant accord
ing to Griffis, senior employees
earn $13.09 per hour with benefits,
while new workers earn just $9.15
per hour and do not receive bene
fits.

UGL claimed that the 29 affect
ed employees are neither the
longest tenured nor the highest
paid janitors working at Stanford,
pointing out that nine of the em
ployees set for termination have
worked at the University for less
than five years. None of the affect
ed janitors have had their jobs for
more than 15 years, and UGL said it
would continue to employ 23 jani
tors who have worked at Stanford
for more than 15 years.
