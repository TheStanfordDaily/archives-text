## Stanford 'has no right' to save janitors' jobs 
### SARAH FLAMM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On June 3, 29 Stanford janitors
are set to lose their jobs because
they are unable to meet the back
ground checks required by the Uni
versity's new janitorial subcontrac
tor, UGL (UNICCO) Janitorial
Services.
The University "will not inter
fere with the agreement and has no
right to do so," said Jeff Wachtel,
senior assistant to University Presi
dent John Hennessy. "This is not a
choice of the University, and we can
take no action."
According to Wachtel, UGL and
Local 1877, a chapter of the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) that represents the work
ers, mutually agreed upon a resolu
tion to the dispute. Under this
agreement, the janitors are slated to
lose their jobs. The union did not re
spond to requests for comment
from The Daily, and UGL said it
had no comment at this time.
The Student Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC), a student group
that has been advocating on behalf
of the janitors over the past several
months, has requested that the Uni
versity intervene to protect these
workers jobs. In a petition created
by SLAC and sent to Stanford and
UGL last December, some 2,000

Stanford community members
signed a statement that read,
"Workers should retain their em
ployment and the wages and bene
fits associated with their seniority
rights through a subcontracting
transition."
Stanford is attempting to re
move itself from these disputes,
which stem from its switch last No
vember to UGL from its previous
services subcontractor, ABM. At
the time, the University explained
the change by saying that UGL
would provide superior services.
Under an agreement with SEIU,
UGL was contractually obligated to
offer all ABM workers the opportu
nity to keep their jobs and initiated
an employment process to rehire
the workers. The employment
process consisted of background
checks on all 134 of the employees
in order to verify each individual's
identity as well as to check for any
criminal history.
According to a letter from UGL
to Stanford, which Wachtel provid
ed to The Daily, one of the purposes
of the process was to ensure that all
employees were lawfully eligible to
be employed in the United States
and that UGL complied with feder
al laws covering immigration and
employment.
