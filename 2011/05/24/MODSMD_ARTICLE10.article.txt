# New method imitates rare disease using stem cells
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” An Le Nguyen 
A rare genetic disease is getting
its moment in the limelight thanks to
researchers at the School of Medi
cine. These scientists have found
that dyskeratosis congenita, which
impacts approximately one in a mil
lion people, can be imitated using
undifferentiated induced pluripo
tent stem (iPS) cells.

Prior research shows that the
rapid shortening of telomeres, the
protective caps found at the end of
chromosomes, causes dyskeratosis
congenita. In Stanford's most recent
study, published this week in Nature,
associate professor of medicine
Steven Artandi and his colleagues
used skin cells from five patients
with varying severities the disease to
create iPS cells.
They then used the iPS cells to
explain why those suffering from
dyskeratosis congenita experience
differing symptoms and differing
severities in these symptoms. Com
monly cited symptoms include ab
normal skin pigmentation, nail
growth, lung scarring, bone marrow
failure as well as cancer.
According to the Stanford re
searchers, a crucial element is the ac
tivity of telomerase, an enzyme that is
important to aging and cell renewal.
"We were very surprised to find
such a clear correlation between the
quantity of functional telomerase,
the severity of the cellular defect
and the severity of the patient's clin
ical symptoms," Artandi said in a
press release. "Our work suggests
that, in patients with dyskeratosis
congenita, tissue stem cells are los
ing their ability to self-renew
throughout the body. This is a new,
unifying way to think about this dis
ease, and it has important implica
tions for many other conditions."
Equally important, researchers
say that studying how telomerase in
fluences self-renewal may also con
tribute to existing knowledge on
aging and disease. The scientists in
tend to continue to create new iPS
cells to further understand cellular
self-renewal.
The National Institutes of Health
and the California Institute for Re
generative Medicine financed the
study.
