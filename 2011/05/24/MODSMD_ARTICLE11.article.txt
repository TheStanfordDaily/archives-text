## NEED FOR SPEED 
### KATY STORCH 
The pressure of pages and pages
of assigned reading is a phe
nomenon familiar to any Stan
ford student. For many of
these students, there is an al
lure to being able to blow through read
ing assignments at a rapid pace. David
Geeter 'l2 has made it his mission to
make the practice of speed-reading a re
ality for Stanford students through his
on-campus speed-reading workshop.
After Geeter attended an expensive
but well-reputed speed-reading work
shop in San Francisco, facilitated by an
organization called Iris Reading, he was
inspired to introduce the practice to
Stanford students as it was not being of
fered elsewhere on campus. His work
shop is a more economical and student
geared form of the workshop he attend
ed in San Francisco, a "speed-reading
boot camp" that is three hours long and
$25 per session.
"I want to provide ... wellness for
students by decreasing stress and build
ing their confidence to rip through docu
ments," Geeter said. "But I also
want to re-spark [the enjoy
ment in] reading."
However, while speed
reading may help stu
dents get through their
material faster, Adina

Glickman, associate director for academic
support in the Center for Teaching and
Learning, argues that it sacrifices reading
comprehension.
As an advocate of the importance of
reading comprehension and the indis
pensability of students engaging with the
texts they read, she expressed the need
for a different outlook on speed-reading.
She sees the technique as a supplement
to reading comprehension efforts.
"Reading is not about pace," Glick
man said. "The techniques of speed-read
ing ... can certainly assist students in
their comprehension of the text, but the
focus on pace is not the way to get the
most out of reading materials."
Geeter claims that his speed-reading
boot camp can teach students to read
three to five times faster. Using skills he
learned from the San Francisco work
shop, he drills students with physical eye
exercises and mental organizing tech
niques to help them increase their read
ing pace.
To start off the workshop, Geeter dis
cusses the faulty reading habits that
cause people

the most problems fixation, lingering
on single words and regression and
rereading passages or sentences over and
over again. Then he carries out a speed
drill to stimulate faster eye movement to
introduce the speed-reading operation.
The workshop then transitions to com
prehension drills, where Geeter assists
students in learning to process words in
groups rather than individually. Lastly, he
teaches students to apply both drills to
the text, reading slower in certain areas
of a document and faster in others.
"Students bring in their own materi
als, and we target the drills toward a par
ticular document," Geeter said. "But the
transition from the easier articles I pro
vide to the often technical articles that
students bring is the area I need to im
prove on."
Hailialoha Jensen 'l2, who attend
ed one of Geeter's workshops,
agreed. She commended his effort to
educate the Stanford community, but
felt that a lack of specialization was
the weakest

part of the session.
"The speed-reading
helped, but not to the
extent that I had
hoped," Jensen said.
"It's a really neat idea
but difficult for some

course material."
Jensen expressed the need for Geeter
to recognize what types of materials stu
dents are reading in order to make
speed-reading applicable to all texts.
However, she was impressed with many
other skills and resources Geeter provid
ed, including visual and physical tricks
that Geeter recommended in order to
maintain pace in reading, such as using
the tip of the finger or a pencil to follow
the words as one reads.
One thing is for sure
speed-reading is not a
magic pill that solves all of
one's academic problems.
This is especially true of its
maintenance and long-term
effectiveness.
"Speed-reading is like
taking a yoga class," Geeter
said about the importance
of self-discipline in up
keep of speed-reading
techniques. "It feels really
good, but it's hard to make
yourself do it all the time,
which makes it easy to revert
back to old habits."
Regina Getz-Kikuchi 'll, an
other attendee of the workshop,
felt that Geeter had done excel
lent work in producing a prod
uct for Stanford students.
