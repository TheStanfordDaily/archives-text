## I HAVE TWO HEADS Carpe Diem 
### Rachel Kolb 
During the last week, I had
one of those glorious
spring-quarter days that re
minded me all over again why I love
being at Stanford. The sky shone a
brilliant blue, I felt myself sur
rounded by great people, I biked
across campus after class feeling ex
uberant about what I had learned
and what I had yet to do. Why would
I ever want to leave this place?
It was one of those days, in other
words, that made me want to press
pause, to preserve the moment in an
elixir-filled vial for times to come
because I realized that this attitude
of feeling absolutely content in the
present stands in sharp contrast to
how I often go about my life at Stan
ford. In the back of my mind, I hope
I always remember how fortunate I
am to be here. I hope I take advan
tage of these undergraduate years
as much as I can. But in the cycle of
everyday life, I often fall into the
pattern of letting those moments
fall by the wayside.
Around the end of the quarter,
especially, around the time when I
start feeling a bit flat and burned
out, I tend to wake up and view each
day as another hurdle I need to
overcome. A paper is due, or a
group project, or a packed schedule
of class after class or meeting after
meeting, after which I'll return to a
slew of emails and a lingering sense
of guilt over not making more time
for more people, more activities,
more everything. Can we please
skip to next week, already? Or to
after finals week? To summer? I feel
fragmented. I come dangerously
close to convincing myself that I
take no joy in the pressures of my
present life. I only want to fast-for
ward, I only want it to be over.
I don't think I am alone. When I
ask friends how they are, I some
times receive the answers "Good,
once this week is over" or "Next
Tuesday can't come fast enough!"
Stanford has the reputation for
chill, in-the-moment spontaneity
just look at all those students out
fountain-hopping or playing Fris
bee this time of year but at the
same time, it can be easy to view
our time here as a never-ending
shopping list of obligations, which
stuns us into a mentality that only
desires to escape. Of course, escape
in far-reaching terms is life post-
Stanford. Next Tuesday is another
step closer to that day. And, while
we'll all be ready to graduate when
the time comes, I don't think many
of us want to rush through our lives
like the present moment means
nothing to us.
One of the special things about
Stanford is how so many people
want to be here. Some of my ac
quaintances from other schools re
port just wanting to finish their edu
cations so that they can settle into
their real lives. Give me that degree
now, and be done with it. I don't see
that attitude very often at Stanford.
But there is still the question: how
do we embrace a productive, get
things-done mentality without un
intentionally squandering these
years that we'll someday look back
on with such nostalgia?
I guess what I'm after is a sense
of perpetual carpe diem. But "seize
the day" isn't quite the sensation
I'm going for. There are plenty of
days that I and other Stanford stu-

dents do seize, if only to power
through to the other side. While tak
ing Latin in high school, I learned to
think about this phrase a different
way. The imperative verb "carpe"
doesn't mean "seize." Rather, it is
literally translated as pluck, enjoy,
make use of, even savor. The way
Horace originally intended the
phrase, we would grab onto the
present moment the same way we
pluck a ripe grape from the vine,
holding it in our hand before biting
down into its sweetness.

From this perspective, carpe
diem refers not so much to combat
ing each day before rushing off with
its spoils. Rather, it has a slower and
more contemplative feel. How can
we hang on to the day at hand, even
as our lives prompt us to press fast
forward and plow through? It often
isn't possible to divert our sources
of pressure, of course. Our entire
lives will involve stress or decision
making in one form or another, and
in the big scheme of things, many of
those details are only minutiae. We
might not be able to change our ex
ternal conditions, but we can adopt
a more balanced, more methodical
mindset with which to approach
them.
I still remember my Latin
teacher asking me, all while
stroking his beard, how would I
spend my very own carpe dieml
What would I do? Now I think I
would answer this question not in
terms of actual activities I al
ready have too many but in
terms of viewing the world in its
proper proportion. Resist the temp
tation to rush or get flustered. Re
member we don't have to do these
things, we get to. Savor the moment.
Whatever strategy that takes.

ly after. Send her your favorites at

I don't think many
of us want to rush
through our lives
like the present
moment means
nothing.
