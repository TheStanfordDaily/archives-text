# FRESHLY BAKED
## Lactose Intolerant 
### Tim Moon 
Last summer, I was browsing
the incredible cheese section
of Milk Pail Market, that won
derful little market, when I was in
terrupted by a man with a faint Eu
ropean accent.
"Do you eat cheese?"
I was a bit taken aback, and I
must have looked accordingly con
fused, as the man quickly followed
up his initial question by saying that
his wife was Asian and could not
stand all the cheese that he always
brought home, so he was wondering
if I was into cheese. I, in fact, was
very into cheese, and finding that
we were kindred spirits, we had a
nice conversation about cheese.
For a while, I thought that my
ability to eat cheese and drink milk
put me squarely in the extreme mi
nority of Asian-Americans who
aren't lactose tolerant, and I loved
it. I couldn't imagine life without
the cold milk poured over my bowl

of morning cereal, without the
gooey cheese hanging off the edge
of a slice of pizza, without a
Klondike bar. Whenever I saw my
afflicted friends having to down a
couple of Lactaid pills before dig
ging into a hot slice, I smirked a lit
tle on the inside, laughing at their
deficiency of the enzyme lactase.
One morning a couple of weeks
ago, I woke up, had a big bowl of ce
real with skim milk, then went back
to bed (it was a Sunday, and I was
tired). I woke up feeling extremely
uneasy, stomach a-churning, and I
curled in a fetal position on my bed,
fighting both the stomachache and
the realization that I might be be
coming lactose intolerant.
ARGHAAAHAH. Since then, the
couple of times I've had cereal, the
milk hasn't sat quite well with me,
but I've been hoping that the first
Sunday was just a case of bad milk
and that I've been imagining the
subsequent stomach aches out of
paranoia. I suspect, however, that it
might actually just be my stomach
hating me for forcing milk into it.
All good things must come to an
end, I suppose.
Like . . . Stanford. Having to
graduate and leave has been weigh
ing heavily on my mind recently,
and while it might not be quite as
devastating a change as losing the
ability to properly process lactose, it
is a pretty big step, one that I'm sure
has been on the minds of other
members of the great class of Oh-
Leven. (Non-seniors, the rest of this
might not relate specifically to you,
but you can always keep these com
ments in your pocket for later.)
Stanford's not perfect, but it's
pretty damn awesome. A friend
from home visited this past week
end, and seeing him impressed by
all the things that had become so
mundane to me (he kept describing
Stanford as "like a vacation spot")
confirmed again just how lucky I've
been to have spent the last four
years here and made the fact that
there's only four more weeks left
feel even weirder.
We'll be fine, of course. Will we
look back on our time here and,
every once in a while, wish that we
could go back, like how I'll sadly
look back upon my cheese-eating
glory days? Sure, but at least we had
that time, and reliving the past
through our memories is always

fun. Will we need to find other ways
to make friends, feed ourselves and
do other adult things? Sure, but if I
could switch to using almond milk
on my cereal, I can surely make
those adjustments too, and if I can
do it, anyone can do it. Some parts
are going to be even better, al
though we might not realize it yet
until I had to switch off of regu
lar milk, I never knew how delicious
almond milk was, but now I think I
might actually prefer it to normal
milk. I'm no Van Wilder, never
wanting to graduate, never wanting
to grow up I'm ready for what's
next, and that's the general sense
I've been getting from most seniors.
But there's still three weeks left,
no need to hurry ourselves out.
There's a Catalan proverb I've al
ways liked: "it's better that it should
make you sick than that you don't
eat it at all," and it seems especially
relevant with just four more weeks.
Three more weeks to do everything
that we need to do, have been
meaning to do, have always wanted
to do.
Like ... eating a wheel of cheese
(or a pizza, I guess, although that
wouldn't be as amazing ) with all my
friends. I'll take the stomachache.

Tim is partial to Comte, but if you
have a better suggestion for what
wheel of cheese he should eat, send
them his way at timmoon@stanford.
edu.

I suspect that it
might actually just
be my stomach
hating me for forcing
milk into it.
