# SPORTS SPECIAL OPINIONS EDITION
## FAN FORUM 'SUPERFANS' NEED TO LEAD RED ZONE 
### CYRUS PINTO '13 
This wouldn't be the first
thing to pop into your
head when you think
about Stanford. Most
people would scoff at
this idea, especially since we could
n't even fill up our tiny stadium dur
ing our nationally televised mar
quee game last season (vs. Arizona).
But let's take a step back for a sec
ond and look at our student section.
Not to be self-praising, but we did a
pretty good job we filled up our
section at every game except for the
Washington State game (don't for
get Harbaugh's anger at the fans,
let's not do this to Coach Shaw). In
previous years, we had trouble sell
ing out the student section. Last
year, we all but solved this problem.
However, going to the game is only
part of the experience; we need fans
to be loud.

This should be the goal of the
2011 football season. And it is an ur
gent one. We are competing with
schools that have student sections
two or three times our size, so to
match their noise level, each of us
has to be two or three times as loud.
This will always be a nagging prob
lem that will probably never be fully
addressed but we can mitigate it.
Enter the superfans.They are the
guys and gals that paint their bodies,
ring their cowbells and/or are in the
band.They help make football crazi

ness mainstream on campus. All we
need to do is spread their knowledge
and passion to the rest of the student
body. And this will be key to not just
keeping students' butts in the seats
(actually, they should be standing

up), but to creating more effective
cheering and yelling.
The first thing we need to work
on is timing our yelling. We rarely
get loud when the opposing players
are in the huddle. This is a critical

time when the play is called if we
start our yelling during the huddle, it
will not only increase the chances
that a play is not heard correctly, but


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Fans in the Red Zone cheer on the Stanford football team. The so-called "superfans," which include those with
painted bodies in the front row, could be Stanford's best chance at getting an effective cheering section this year.
it will also help build up the excite
ment among the general fans, who
usually take longer to join the
yelling. On the flip side, we should
not start chants when our team is in
the huddle on offense. We have to let
our offense call the play without
having to compete with extra noise.
1 don't expect every fan to have
this football knowledge; it's the job
of the yell leaders to inform them.
However, the yell leaders have not
been as effective as they could be in
their role a role that should wield
great power. Often, they do not start
yelling on defense until the opposing
team has broken out of the huddle,
and on offense, they start chants
when we are in the huddle. They
should take a cue from the band (su
perfans) they play softly during
the extra point after a touchdown
despite the huge temptation to
cheer.
I believe that employing more ef
fective means of spreading the super
fans' knowledge to the rest of the stu
dent population is the best way to
create a more mainstream football
culture. A good first step is to have
more effective yell leaders. With the
combination of our swelling fan base
and our tantalizing home schedule
(Notre Dame, Oregon, Washington
and Cal), we are positioned to create
a more hostile environment and
have College Gameday finally re
turn to the Farm. And with our su
perfans at the helm, we'll be ready
for the season.

With a lockout looming over the
NFL, Cyrus Pinto knows that it's
time to focus on making the most of
Saturday football next season. Swap
