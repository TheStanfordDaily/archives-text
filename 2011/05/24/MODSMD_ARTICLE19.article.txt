# Pac-10 needs baseball tournament
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
All across the nation
this week, college
baseball teams are
preparing for their
season-ending con
ference tournaments. The SEC plays
a tournament in Hoover, Ala., the
Big 12 heads to Oklahoma City, the
ACC sets up shop in Durham, N.C.,
and even smaller leagues like the
America East and the Horizon
League have tournaments to cap off
the regular season. However, there
is one notable exception to this con
ference tournament season the
Pac-10.

Unlike almost every other major
and minor conference in the coun
try, the Pac-10 doesn't have any sea
son-ending baseball tournament to
determine a champion. And while
the Pac-10 is exploring the possibili
ty of a postseason tournament when
the conference expands to 11 teams
next year (Colorado hasn't had a
baseball program since the mid-'Bos,
Utah currently plays in the Moun
tain West), it appears that the new
Pac-12 is missing out on a major op
portunity to draw in fans (and cash)
by neglecting to add a tournament
to the championship schedule next
year.
While the conference could be
capitalizing on the fact that it consis
tently boasts some of the best base
ball teams in the country, the Pac-10
currently lets the regular season end
quietly while in stark contrast
the SEC has its entire conference
tournament broadcast on ESPN.
This hole in the Pac-10 schedule
is particularly surprising because of
the conference's strength from top
to bottom. The Pac-10 has sent four
or more teams to the postseason in
nine of the last 10 years, and a Pac-10
team has played in the finals of the
College World Series in six of the
last 11 years.
Those stats don't mean that the
conference is just top-heavy with
good teams, either. Last year, eight
squads made an NCAA Regional
appearance, and Oregon State won
the national championship in 2007
despite finishing sixth in conference
with a 10-14 record.
But instead of letting teams like
the 2007 Oregon State squad have
one final run at the conference title
in the last weekend of the year,
teams are firmly stuck in their places
without a chance to salvage their
season and their postseason hopes,
despite how good the team might
actually be.
Because of this conference pari
ty, if the newly named Pac-12 were
to hold a conference tournament
between the top eight teams after
the regular season, the worst seed in
the tournament might have almost
as good a shot to win the title as the
top seed. And if a middle-of-the
