# Pac-10 needs baseball tournament
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
All across the nation
this week, college
baseball teams are
preparing for their
season-ending con
ference tournaments. The SEC plays
a tournament in Hoover, Ala., the
Big 12 heads to Oklahoma City, the
ACC sets up shop in Durham, N.C.,
and even smaller leagues like the
America East and the Horizon
League have tournaments to cap off
the regular season. However, there
is one notable exception to this con
ference tournament season the
Pac-10.

Unlike almost every other major
and minor conference in the coun
try, the Pac-10 doesn't have any sea
son-ending baseball tournament to
determine a champion. And while
the Pac-10 is exploring the possibili
ty of a postseason tournament when
the conference expands to 11 teams
next year (Colorado hasn't had a
baseball program since the mid-'Bos,
Utah currently plays in the Moun
tain West), it appears that the new
Pac-12 is missing out on a major op
portunity to draw in fans (and cash)
by neglecting to add a tournament
to the championship schedule next
year.
While the conference could be
capitalizing on the fact that it consis
tently boasts some of the best base
ball teams in the country, the Pac-10
currently lets the regular season end
quietly while in stark contrast
the SEC has its entire conference
tournament broadcast on ESPN.
This hole in the Pac-10 schedule
is particularly surprising because of
the conference's strength from top
to bottom. The Pac-10 has sent four
or more teams to the postseason in
nine of the last 10 years, and a Pac-10
team has played in the finals of the
College World Series in six of the
last 11 years.
Those stats don't mean that the
conference is just top-heavy with
good teams, either. Last year, eight
squads made an NCAA Regional
appearance, and Oregon State won
the national championship in 2007
despite finishing sixth in conference
with a 10-14 record.
But instead of letting teams like
the 2007 Oregon State squad have
one final run at the conference title
in the last weekend of the year,
teams are firmly stuck in their places
without a chance to salvage their
season and their postseason hopes,
despite how good the team might
actually be.
Because of this conference pari
ty, if the newly named Pac-12 were
to hold a conference tournament
between the top eight teams after
the regular season, the worst seed in
the tournament might have almost
as good a shot to win the title as the
top seed. And if a middle-of-the
pack squad (like Stanford this year,
which right now sits fifth in the con
ference with a 12-12 record) were to
win the Pac-12 Tournament, it
would have a nice feather in the cap
to encourage the NCAA to select
that team for the postseason or even
to host a regional, which only would
add to conference prestige and
pocketbooks.
Speaking of money, the Pac-12
could stand to earn a nice bit of cash
if it handled the postseason tourna
ment correctly. Last year, the SEC
Tournament had 126,071 fans show
up, an average of 9,698 per game, to
its eight-team, double-elimination
tournament. Is it possible for the
Pac-12 to draw numbers like that to
the gates? Probably not. But the
tickets, concessions and merchan
dise sold in one solid weekend (as
well as the money the conference
would earn from any television
broadcasts) could be substantial if

the Pac-12 could bring in just half the
fans that the SEC does right now.
With the extra coin, the confer
ence could then turn around and
help teams build new stadiums and
facilities, or even use it to help Col
orado reinstate a baseball program.
The influx of money would at least
prevent schools from cutting their
baseball programs, as Cal did earlier
this year before donors ponied up
$lO million to keep the Golden
Bears out on the diamond.
If the conference does indeed
want to pull the trigger on a postsea
son tournament, it needs to think
big in order to draw in fans and their
wallets. Other conferences have
their tournaments at minor league
ballparks in mid-sized cities, and
there are plenty of minor league
parks readily available in California

but the Pac-12 can do better than
a park in Sacramento or Modesto.
Perhaps the best minor league
option might be Las Vegas, home of
the Toronto Blue Jays' Triple-A af
filiate, the Las Vegas 51s. While the
coaches might not like the fact that
the Vegas strip will tempt their play
ers, fans would come out of the

woodwork to spend a weekend in
Vegas and watch some college base
ball. Perhaps the Pac-12 could even
convince AT&T Park, Dodger Sta
dium, Chase Field in Phoenix or
Safeco Field in Seattle to let the col
lege kids play a few, yet another en
ticing option for fans.

With the Pac-12's new media
deals now set in stone, the confer
ence has a major opportunity to
bring in new fans and lots of money,
and baseball is the one place where
other conferences are still clearly
ahead of the Pac-12 right now. With
a season-ending tournament,
though, the Pac-12 could quickly
catapult itself onto the national
media stage. Then, instead of watch
ing SEC baseball all Memorial Day
weekend, fans on the West Coast
and all over the nation would finally
get to see that the Pac-12 has some
of the best baseball the country has
to offer.

the regular season, the worst seed in
the tournament might have almost
as good a shot to win the title as the
top seed. And if a middle-of-the
pack squad (like Stanford this year,
which right now sits fifth in the con
ference with a 12-12 record) were to
win the Pac-12 Tournament, it
would have a nice feather in the cap
to encourage the NCAA to select
that team for the postseason or even
to host a regional, which only would
add to conference prestige and
pocketbooks.
Speaking of money, the Pac-12
could stand to earn a nice bit of cash
if it handled the postseason tourna
ment correctly. Last year, the SEC
Tournament had 126,071 fans show
up, an average of 9,698 per game, to
its eight-team, double-elimination
tournament. Is it possible for the
Pac-12 to draw numbers like that to
the gates? Probably not. But the
tickets, concessions and merchan
dise sold in one solid weekend (as
well as the money the conference
would earn from any television
broadcasts) could be substantial if

the Pac-12 could bring in just half the
fans that the SEC does right now.
With the extra coin, the confer
ence could then turn around and
help teams build new stadiums and
facilities, or even use it to help Col
orado reinstate a baseball program.
The influx of money would at least
prevent schools from cutting their
baseball programs, as Cal did earlier
this year before donors ponied up
$lO million to keep the Golden
Bears out on the diamond.
If the conference does indeed
want to pull the trigger on a postsea
son tournament, it needs to think
big in order to draw in fans and their
wallets. Other conferences have
their tournaments at minor league
ballparks in mid-sized cities, and
there are plenty of minor league
parks readily available in California

but the Pac-12 can do better than
a park in Sacramento or Modesto.
Perhaps the best minor league
option might be Las Vegas, home of
the Toronto Blue Jays' Triple-A af
filiate, the Las Vegas 51s. While the
coaches might not like the fact that
the Vegas strip will tempt their play
ers, fans would come out of the

woodwork to spend a weekend in
Vegas and watch some college base
ball. Perhaps the Pac-12 could even
convince AT&T Park, Dodger Sta
dium, Chase Field in Phoenix or
Safeco Field in Seattle to let the col
lege kids play a few, yet another en
ticing option for fans.

With the Pac-12's new media
deals now set in stone, the confer
ence has a major opportunity to
bring in new fans and lots of money,
and baseball is the one place where
other conferences are still clearly
ahead of the Pac-12 right now. With
a season-ending tournament,
though, the Pac-12 could quickly
catapult itself onto the national
media stage. Then, instead of watch
ing SEC baseball all Memorial Day
weekend, fans on the West Coast
and all over the nation would finally
get to see that the Pac-12 has some
of the best baseball the country has
to offer.

All across the nation
this week, college
baseball teams are
preparing for their
season-ending con
ference tournaments. The SEC plays
a tournament in Hoover, Ala., the
Big 12 heads to Oklahoma City, the
ACC sets up shop in Durham, N.C.,
and even smaller leagues like the
America East and the Horizon
League have tournaments to cap off
the regular season. However, there
is one notable exception to this con
ference tournament season the
Pac-10.

Unlike almost every other major
and minor conference in the coun
try, the Pac-10 doesn't have any sea
son-ending baseball tournament to
determine a champion. And while
the Pac-10 is exploring the possibili
ty of a postseason tournament when
the conference expands to 11 teams
next year (Colorado hasn't had a
baseball program since the mid-'Bos,
Utah currently plays in the Moun
tain West), it appears that the new
Pac-12 is missing out on a major op
portunity to draw in fans (and cash)
by neglecting to add a tournament
to the championship schedule next
year.
While the conference could be
capitalizing on the fact that it consis
tently boasts some of the best base
ball teams in the country, the Pac-10
currently lets the regular season end
quietly while in stark contrast
the SEC has its entire conference
tournament broadcast on ESPN.
This hole in the Pac-10 schedule
is particularly surprising because of
the conference's strength from top
to bottom. The Pac-10 has sent four
or more teams to the postseason in
nine of the last 10 years, and a Pac-10
team has played in the finals of the
College World Series in six of the
last 11 years.
Those stats don't mean that the
conference is just top-heavy with
good teams, either. Last year, eight
squads made an NCAA Regional
appearance, and Oregon State won
the national championship in 2007
despite finishing sixth in conference
with a 10-14 record.
But instead of letting teams like
the 2007 Oregon State squad have
one final run at the conference title
in the last weekend of the year,
teams are firmly stuck in their places
without a chance to salvage their
season and their postseason hopes,
despite how good the team might
actually be.
Because of this conference pari
ty, if the newly named Pac-12 were
to hold a conference tournament
between the top eight teams after
the regular season, the worst seed in
the tournament might have almost
as good a shot to win the title as the
top seed. And if a middle-of-the
pack squad (like Stanford this year,
which right now sits fifth in the con
ference with a 12-12 record) were to
win the Pac-12 Tournament, it
would have a nice feather in the cap
to encourage the NCAA to select
that team for the postseason or even
to host a regional, which only would
add to conference prestige and
pocketbooks.

ment correctly. Last year, the SEC
