# Cultures direct food choices
## Assimilation pressures many to pick junk food

the control group; the
statistics were 75 percent
and 25 percent for the re
spective groups. White par
ticipants showed no change.
The findings point to the con
clusion that the "threat" to
their American identity pushed
these participants to choose
more mainstream foods.
"The claim is that it carries
over at many other levels; it's
not just about food," Monin
said. "It's like when I'm telling
you your food makes you
weird, it means you're weird.

Asian Americans may change their eating
habits to favor less healthy mainstream Ameri
can foods in an effort to fit in with white Amer
ican society. These findings have emerged from
a recent study by researchers at Stanford and
other institutions, who suggest that such behav
iors could contribute to the trends of increasing
obesity among generations of immigrants.
"It's not just being here that exposes them to
worse food," said Benoit Monin, associate pro
fessor of organizational behavior at the Gradu
ate School of Business and an author of the
study. "It's something about the identity threat
that Asian Americans face that leads them to
want to fit in and eat... less healthy food."
The study, titled "Fitting in but Getting Fat,"
appears in Psychological Science and involves
researchers at Stanford, the University of Wash
ington and UC-Berkeley.
The first part of the study asked participants
on the Stanford campus to list their favorite
foods. Those in the experimental group were
asked whether they spoke English by the exper
imenter before receiving the questionnaire,
while those in the control group were not asked
that question. Both groups were then asked to
list their favorite foods.
The study found that more of the "threat
ened" Asian-American participants listed tradi
tional American foods as their favorites than

All these things are connected
when a group feels like it's not accepted."
In the second portion of the study, Asian and
white Americans in Seattle, Wash., were again
randomized into two groups. One group was
told, "Actually, you have to be American to be in
this study," and a control group did not hear that
phrase. The participants were then asked to pick
a dish from two menus, one Asian and one
American, to be eaten at a later date.
Again, the "threatened" group was more
likely to choose an American dish than the con
trol group, and the choices they made contained
on average 182 more calories and 12 more
grams of fat.
"Even though it's not a lot of calories, you
can imagine if every day they're governed by

this desire to fit in, it's really going to add up,"
Monin said.
Monin hopes that the study will help bring
unconscious behaviors to light and eventually
allow ethnic foods to become increasingly
mainstream. He said acceptance of food would
help immigrants feel more accepted overall and
that it would be beneficial for American culture
as a whole.
"On the other side, it'd be good for white
Americans also," he said. "If the healthier ethnic
foods become more available and normal, it
would be good for them if they're eating fewer
cheese steaks and burgers and whatever else is
considered mainstream food in America."
