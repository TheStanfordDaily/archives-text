# Back to the finals
## Card looks to defend title against Florida 
### JACOB JAFFE NATE ADAMS 
For the second consecutive year,
the Stanford women's tennis team
has made it to the finals of the
NCAA Tournament. And for the
second consecutive year, the Cardi
nal's opponents will be the Florida
Gators.

Last night, Stanford took down
Baylor 4-1 in the semifinals at Taube
Tennis Center to advance to today's
final. The top-seeded Cardinal se
cured the doubles point thanks to
wins of 8-2 on court one and 8-6 on
court two. The fifth-seeded Bears
tied the score at one when Stanford
freshman Kristie Ahn was forced to
default her match after only three
games of singles, exiting due to a lin
gering ankle injury.
From there, it was all Stanford.
Despite struggles from its top sin
gles player, senior Hilary Barte, the
Cardinal won three singles matches
in straight sets to earn the win.
Sophomore Stacey Tan was most
impressive, winning 6-1,6-4 on court
five to regain the lead for the Cardi
nal. Junior Veronica Li followed
with a 6-4, 6-3 win on court six to
give Stanford its third point, and
sophomore Mallory Burdette
clinched the victory with a 7-5, 6-4

win on court two.
"The win today awesome," Bur
