# Back to the finals
## Card looks to defend title against Florida 
### JACOB JAFFE NATE ADAMS 
For the second consecutive year,
the Stanford women's tennis team
has made it to the finals of the
NCAA Tournament. And for the
second consecutive year, the Cardi
nal's opponents will be the Florida
Gators.

Last night, Stanford took down
Baylor 4-1 in the semifinals at Taube
Tennis Center to advance to today's
final. The top-seeded Cardinal se
cured the doubles point thanks to
wins of 8-2 on court one and 8-6 on
court two. The fifth-seeded Bears
tied the score at one when Stanford
freshman Kristie Ahn was forced to
default her match after only three
games of singles, exiting due to a lin
gering ankle injury.
From there, it was all Stanford.
Despite struggles from its top sin
gles player, senior Hilary Barte, the
Cardinal won three singles matches
in straight sets to earn the win.
Sophomore Stacey Tan was most
impressive, winning 6-1,6-4 on court
five to regain the lead for the Cardi
nal. Junior Veronica Li followed
with a 6-4, 6-3 win on court six to
give Stanford its third point, and
sophomore Mallory Burdette
clinched the victory with a 7-5, 6-4

win on court two.

Senior Hilary Barte cruised through doubles to help Stanford take
the early lead over Baylor, but she struggled in singles. The rest of
her team stepped up to secure the 4-1 semifinal win over the Bears.

Freshman Nicole Gibbs clinched the doubles point for Stanford along with her partner, junior Veronica Li. The
Cardinal won 4-1 to force a rematch in the NCAA finals with Florida. Last year, Stanford won a nailbiter over
the Gators to win the national title. Stanford and Florida, the top two seeds in the field, will face off at 4 p.m.
dette said. "I feel like it was definite
ly not a super easy match. A lot of
people had close matches, and a lot
of matches had us fighting really
hard. I was excited to be able to
clinch and bring home the win at the
end. So I think overall it was a really
good performance from us, on sin
gles and in doubles."
Ahn's early exit was the only
down-note for Stanford, which
would have otherwise swept the
match. After suffering a minor
ankle injury in last month's Pac-10
Singles Tournament which she
won Ahn has played through
pain and occasionally been
scratched from her usual spot in the
doubles lineup.
When asked if she thought Ahn
would be playing today, Burdette
wasn't optimistic.
"As of right now, no," she said. "I
think we're going to go forward
planning to not have her in doubles
or singles."
Despite her probable absence,
though, Burdette thinks the team
has enough depth and experience to
make up for it and succeed.
"We would all want her out
there, but I don't think it's going to
shake us too much," she said. "Our
doubles team will be the same, and
in singles all year, we've pretty much
had seven players that we moved in
and out of the lineup."
That seventh player is Carolyn
McVeigh, a talented senior who has
received significant playing time
this year, especially after Ahn's in
jury.

While Stanford's lineup might be
a little different today, a lot of the
storylines from last night's match
will be familiar to Cardinal fans.
Yesterday's match marked the sec
ond straight year the Cardinal elim
inated the Bears in the NCAA
Tournament. Last year, Baylor was
the No. 1 seed, and No. 8 seed Stan
ford pulled the upset in the quarter
finals on its way to a national title. To
win that title, the Cardinal had to
pull out a grueling 4-3 win in the fi
nals when Burdette rallied for a
three-set win. Stanford's opponent
in those finals was also Florida, who
advanced yesterday with a 4-0
sweep of No. 6 UCLA.
Today's final matchup pits the
two best teams in the country
against each other. The No. 2-seed
Gators are actually ranked ahead of
Stanford in the ITA rankings, and
their only loss all season was to the
Cardinal in the finals of February's
National Team Indoors in Char
lottesville, Va. Other than that
match, Florida is 30-0, losing multi
ple points in a dual match just three
times. The Cardinal has gone all 28
matches this season without losing
more than two points, and Stanford
has not lost a dual match since Feb.
26,2010. That 47-match streak pales
in comparison to the Cardinal's
home winning streak, though, which
spans 184 matches and over 12 years.
Burdette, who will finish her sec
ond straight season with a finals
match against the Gators today, said
that last year's ending will make
today's match particularly competi
tive.
"For both teams, I think we all
know each other's games really well
and how we do things," she said.
"We know how we want to go out
there and play all those matchups,

so it's a matter of executing."
Stanford's streak will be tested
this afternoon, when Stanford and
Florida clash for the national title.
Doubles play begins at 4 p.m. at
Taube Tennis Center, with singles
play to follow.
