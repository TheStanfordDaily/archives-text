# Football and break plans
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky Between the lines 
In the midst of special dinner
preparations on Friday, I sent a
short survey to a few email lists.
The goal? To get a broad look at
students' views on the football
games bookending the Thanksgiving
recess.

Stanford, unlike most schools, of
fers a full week of vacation during that
time. Due to the quarter system's late
start time, there is no fall break in Octo
ber; instead, it's combined with
Thanksgiving, allowing students a full
nine days of uninterrupted freedom.
This means that, in most cases, there is
ample time for travel home or else
where before the crush of finals period
begins.

It's a nice and deserved vacation,
but it has an unintended consequence:
fans leave campus during the tail end
and generally, the wildly important
portion â€”of Stanford football's sea
son. Big Game is almost always held
during either Thanksgiving weekend
or the one before it, and the other con
test usually holds significance, too, be it
a crucial Pac-10 matchup to help deter
mine the final standings and bowl
placement or a meeting with rival
Notre Dame.

Most other schools would only be
at risk of losing students for one game
on the Saturday following Thanks
giving since they'd still be in session
during the prior weekend. But the Car
dinal could be missing a chunk of the
Red Zone for two games at a time
when the team may need its most bois
terous supporters more than ever.
So I sent out a survey. A crude, un
scientific survey that would never be
admissible for any purposes other than
to see the thoughts of a handful of stu
dents. It was anonymous, meaning that
in theory, someone could have submit
ted the form a dozen different times.
And it should in no way be seen as rep
resentative of the body as a whole. It
was merely sent out of curiosity. Don't
take it as anything more. Here's what I
found.
laskedthe group if they had attend
ed last year's Big Game and Oregon
State contest, and if they planned to at
tend this year's Big Game and Notre
Dame matchup. For both 2010 and
2011,1 questioned whether or not they
made their travel plans around these
games.
A total of 89 people replied, with
comments ranging from "I was part of
AxeComm, so the Big Game was a big
deal" to "I care so, so much more about
seeing my family and enjoying my
break than Stanford football." Overall,
56 percent of responders said they
made it to Berkeley last season, while
only 36 percent said they had gone to
see the Cardinal take down the
Beavers. The numbers matched up
roughly to the respondents' future
plans: 65 percent said they'd be at Big
Game in 2011 (which has the added
benefit of being at home), with 22 per
cent unsure. Just 27 percent said they
would definitively be at the Notre
Dame contest, with 35 percent still not
sure of their plans.
The results make sense: not only is
Cal the major rival, but in both 2010
and 2011, the game was/will be held on
the first weekend of break. Classes con
clude just a day before, and staying in
the area for a single extra day to see the
two schools battle for the Axe makes
sense when you still have eight days in
which you can be at home. By contrast,
both the Oregon State and Notre
Dame games are held only two days
after Thanksgiving, which is still seen as
part of the holiday. Friends from other
schools are off then, too, and while the
Irish are a rival and the Beavers are a
conference foe, the normative aspect
of the game is not nearly as high as the
annual Stanford-Cal tussle it's un
derstandable that the inclination to get
back to the Farm may not be too
strong.

It's also hard to predict the future.
For example, the Oregon State game
this year held massive ramifications for
Stanford win, and be practically
guaranteed a BCS bowl; lose, and play
somewhere that few non-diehards
would care about. But plane tickets are
booked well in advance and for
good reason so even an interested
fan that would have gone to the game
if he or she was on campus may have
been hand-tied by prior travel purchas
es. I asked the surveyed participants if
they made/would make their Thanks
