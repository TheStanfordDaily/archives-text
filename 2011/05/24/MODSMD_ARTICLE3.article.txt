## PA mulls police, fire dept. merge Move part of effort to balance city budget shortfall 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Elena Stephenson 
The city of Palo Alto is consid
ering consolidating its fire and po
lice departments into a single "de
partment of public safety" to elim
inate extraneous administrative
costs. Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety spokesman
Bill Larson said that while the Uni
versity has relationships with the
two departments, the proposed
merger's impact on the Stanford
community remains unclear.
Stanford's fire service, including
dispatching, is contracted out to
the city of Palo Alto. Stanford's po
lice service, on the other hand, is
separate from the city's and falls
under the jurisdiction of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's office, Lar
son said.

City manager James Keene first
broached the potential merger at a
City Council meeting earlier this
month, citing the city's increasing
health-care costs as one of the
main motivations behind the
change. Police chief Dennis Burns,
who has acted as interim fire chief
since July 1,2010, supported the ar
gument for a single leader of a unit
ed Public Safety Department. Sev
eral consulting firms have also re
leased reports with similar recom
mendations, advocating for a per
manent consolidation of the two
positions.

By merging the two depart
ments and drastically reducing ad
ministrative costs and increasing
overall efficiency, Keene hopes to
avoid sticky financial situations in
the future. Palo Alto is currently
trying to avoid service and staffing
cuts and minimize disruption to
public safety operations. He ex
pressed the need for a long-term
vision of the city's public safety
services at the committee meeting.
"I just have to think that for the
long term at least, efficiencies on
support, the administration back
bone and all of those sorts of things
are worthwhile," he said then.
