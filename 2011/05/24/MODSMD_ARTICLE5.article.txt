## Soroush discusses poet Rumi Event begins three-talk lecture on Persian writer 
### IVY NGUYEN DESK EDITOR 
Iranian scholar Abdolkarim
• presented the first part of a
series of lectures on Iranian poet
and Sufi mystic Rumi on Monday.
The event kicked off a week of talks
from Soroush on the subject, the re
mainder of which will be conducted
in Persian.

Speaking to an audience that
filled the aisles and overflowed into
the hallway, Director of Iranian
Studies Abbas Milani introduced
Soroush as "one of the most influ
ential thinkers in Iran."

"The program he taught on tele
vision soon became one of the most
popular programs on television
those days, and his ability to conjure
thousands of lines of verse became
very popular very quickly," Milani
said of Soroush. "Like everything
that became popular very quickly,
the plug was pulled very quickly be
cause the regime didn't want him to
become as popular as he was."
Soroush began the night by re
counting Rumi's life. The poet, born
in 1207, composed thousands of
lines of verse.

Between the ages of 55 and 68,
he produced 25,000 lines that be
came the Masthavi or "Spiritual
Couplets," which many today use as
an introduction to the Sufi faith.

"Every evening, Rumi would sit
and some of his students, who were
laymen, surrounded him, and he
produced verses to them and they
took it down," he said.

Soroush also noted that Rumi's
story and work transcend political
boundaries. Although he is com
monly considered an Iranian poet,
Rumi never lived in Iran, and in
stead traveled throughout present
day Afghanistan and Turkey.
"It is not appropriate to insist on
the point that he was an Iranian; he
was a meta-historical, meta-geo
graphical figure," Soroush said. "All
of his teachings tell us that the main
land is elsewhere, where our souls
have come from."

In recent years, Rumi has en
joyed worldwide popularity; many
of his works have been translated
into different languages and studied
in many different cultures.
"Nevertheless, you have to be
careful first and foremost he be
longs to Iranian culture, and then he
belongs to the world culture,"
Soroush said.

Soroush then sparked some con
troversy among the audience when
he explained the poets and
prophets.

"In the Quran, there are verses
that say poets cannot become
prophets and that prophets are no
good as poets," he said. "You have to
have direct access to reality as a
prophet, and if you have imagination,
the revelation would be contaminat
ed as a result. For a prophet, being a
poet is tantamount to denigration."
Nonetheless, Soroush considers
Rumi a prophet and a poet of love
because of the transcendence of his
message.
"He deserves that title, the
prophet of love," Soroush said. "A
prophet is someone who has re
ceived insight, someone whose mes
sage has become transcendental or
becomes eternal."
That the poet's writings have
been referred to by some as the Per
sian Quran is testament to that title,
he said. While the Quran teaches a
message of fear and awe, Rumi's
writings describe a relationship with
God that's similar to one of a lover
and his beloved. This message is
part of what makes Rumi's writings
appealing and relevant today, ac
cording to the scholar.
"Every generation makes his
own selection [of Rumi's writing] to

meet their needs, in order to put it in
its proper place in this day and age,"
Soroush said.
While Soroush's lecture focused
on the philosophical nature and
modern relevance of Rumi's writ
ing, the room was charged with the
political tension of Iran, as Milam's
remarks remained on the audi
ence's mind.
Milani recounted the time he
and Soroush met with several Iran
ian scholars at Stanford ten years
ago.
"Many of those people in that
first gathering are now in prison," he
said. "This talk is held in their mem
ory and in hope of their freedom."
The series is sponsored by the
Program in Iranian Studies, the
Daryabari Endowment in Persian
letters, the Abbasi Program in Is
lamic Studies, the Persian Students
Association, the Stanford Speakers
Bureau and the Graduate Student
Council.
