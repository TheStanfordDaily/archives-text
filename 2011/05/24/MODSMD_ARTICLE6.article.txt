## $20 million endowment established for bioengineering projects 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Stanford University and the Wallace H. Coul
ter Foundation have established a $2O million en
dowment to support translating ideas and re
search into medical treatments and devices, ac
cording to a press release from the School of
Medicine.This endowment allows the Wallace H.
Coulter Translational Research Grant Program
to continue in perpetuity and was funded by a
$lO million grant from the Coulter Foundation,

which was matched by the Office of the Presi
dent.
The grant program was founded five years
ago after Stanford became one of nine universi
ties to receive a $5 million grant from the Coulter
Foundation for the period between 2006 and
2011. Over those five years, the program funded
25 projects by co-investigators from the Bioengi
neering Department and a clinical department in
the School of Medicine.
Some results of that program include the de
velopment of a blood test that could be an alter
native to amniocentesis, a new type of surgical
dressing that could prevent scarring, a drug that
could improve cognition for patients with Down
syndrome and a cheap ventilator for hospitals in
developing nations that are unable to afford the
current models.

These grants differ from those from the Na
tional Institutes of Health and other federal
agencies because projects follow the Coulter
Process, which outlines a more business-like
model, according to bioengineering chair Russ
Altman.
"This is more like business," Altman said in
the press release. "The projects have quarterly
milestones and can be killed by the oversight
committee if the milestones are not met this is
not how academic grants usually go. There is a
very strong emphasis on keeping focused on
what is needed for successful transfer to profes
sional management via a start-up or a license to
an existing company."
This development process follows that of in-
dustry and includes a commercial
ization analysis as part of the proj
ect. This analysis has attracted fund
ing from venture capital and bio
medical companies, according to
Elias Caro, vice president of tech
nology development at Coulter.
Thus far, 12 projects from this pro
gram have led to the formation of
start-ups or have been licensed by
an existing company. The projects
have received $43 million in follow
up funds, with nearly half coming
from non-government sources.
