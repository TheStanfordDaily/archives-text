### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Electrical engineering professor
Robert Helliwell AB '42 ENG '44
Ph.D. '4B died May 3 in Palo Alto at
the age of 90 of complications from
dementia.
Born in 1920 in Red Wing,
Minn., Helliwell moved to Palo Alto
with his mother after his father died.
He earned his bachelor's, master's
and doctoral degrees from Stanford
and joined the electrical engineer
ing faculty in 1946.
Helliwell is most famous for his
research in how radio waves interact
with charged particles in the atmos
phere. He embarked on this re
search topic by chance in 1950, when
a graduate student monitoring radio
waves from distant lightning heard
strange whistling noises from a
speaker and later mentioned them
to Helliwell. These noises, termed
"whistlers," were a result of very low
frequency radio waves.
He later applied this phenome
non to make fundamental discover
ies about how radio waves could be
used to study the ionized atmos
phere high above the earth's surface.
When electrical noise from the city
power lines near Stanford interfered
with his effort to detect natural
whistlers, Helliwell traveled to
Antarctica, where he established a
research site in 1957.
The Stanford Radio Science Lab
oratory conducted ionospheric and
magnetospheric experiments at Siple
Station from 1971 until it closed in
1988. Today, Stanford graduate stu
dents in the VLF Group are still ana
lyzing data from that research. Helli
well also wrote what is considered a
classic work on whistlers, "Whistlers
and Related lonospheric Phenome
na." He is the namesake for the Hel
liwell Hills, an Antarctic mountain
range along the coast of Victoria
Land on the Ross Sea.

Helliwell's distinguished career
was decorated with the Antarctic
Service Medal in 1966 and the Ap

pleton Prize of the Royal Society of
London in 1972 for his work in
ionospheric physics. He was a mem
ber of the National Academy of Sci
ences, fellow of the American Geo
physical Union and chaired one of
the commissions of the Internation
al Union of Radio Science (URSI).
A memorial service for Helliwell
will be held June 7 at 3 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
