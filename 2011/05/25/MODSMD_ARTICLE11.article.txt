## KING OF THE ITCHEN RUE ROYALE TO FRENCH HOUSE ROYALTY 
### OLIVIA SIMONE JEW 
Imagine you're a chef. One day,
while preparing dinner, you hear a
knock on the door to your kitchen,
and there stands Nelson Mandela,
excitedly awaiting your food.
Not many chefs have had an experi
ence like this one, but Juan Jose, the chef
for French House and Phi Psi, has had
many extraordinary culinary and life ex
periences. For the past five years, every
weekday, from morning until night, Jose
creates delicious food for the residents of
both houses.
Juan Jose, or "J.J.," as he is fondly re
ferred to by house residents, has gone
through quite an interesting journey to
end up at Stanford.
Born in Majorca, an island off the
Mediterranean coast of Spain, Jose
trained at Le Cordon Bleu culinary acad
emy. But he didn't always know that he
wanted to become a chef. He originally
was headed for a career as a lawyer and
attended the University of Salamanca for
a short time before realizing that it wasn't
for him.

"I was the black sheep," Jose said. "I
was at the University for one year and
said 'I don't like it, I don't want to do this.'
My girlfriend and I were both rebellious,
so we both left for France. And we slept
by the beautiful river under the bridges,
with all the hippies, painters at the time."
In need of money, he got a job in the
kitchen of Maxim's, a world-famous, land
mark restaurant on the rue Royale.
Jose had no previous cooking knowl
edge, so he began with peeling potatoes
and other menial tasks. After his first
month, his supervisor told him he had the

ability to become something more in the
kitchen. He recommended Jose for Le
Cordon Bleu, the world's largest hospital
ity education institution, where renowned
chefs such as Mario Batali and Julia Child
have trained in the art of cooking.
Jose spent five years training at Le
Cordon Bleu. He was initially to learn the
craft of making sauces as a saucier. Find
ing that working as a saucier was not to his
liking, Jose then trained as a pastry chef,
and, after not enjoying either of the two
positions, he finally spent three years
training in cooking.
After Le Cordon Bleu, Jose returned
home to Majorca and worked for a yacht
company as a private chef, cooking for
various important figures visiting Major
ca. He met an ambassador who asked him
to come to New York and work as a chef
for the United Nations.
At the U.N., each ambassador has his
or her own chef who accompanies the am
bassador on trips around the world and
prepares meals for dignitaries, heads of
state, monarchs and even actors. During
his 27 years at the U.N., Jose met a range
of prominent figures, such as Nelson
Mandela, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon,
Robert Redford and Steven Spielberg.
The life of a chef in the U.N. is exciting
but also demanding. Jose described
spending 24 hours a day, seven days a
week with the ambassadors. The chefs
would spend months with the ambassa
dors while the U.N. was in session, and
then spend a month of each year volun
teering their services for a non-profit
cause, such as UNICEF or Doctors With
out Borders, as was Jose's case.

The most unusual circumstances
Jose has cooked in were while
working with Doctors Without Bor
ders in Kosovo during the war with
Serbia.
"We had bombs all over us," Jose
recalled. "The doctors were still op
erating like it was nothing, and they
were asking me for food, and I was
like 'Wow!'"
Jose has almost met countless
world leaders. His meeting with
Nelson Mandela stands out in his
mind.
"I was in the ambassador house
and Mr. Mandela was coming to
have dinner," he said. "The wife of
the ambassador asked me to do
African food, because he thought it
would impress him. I went to go buy
the things in Brooklyn, and we had
everything ready; the dinner was
supposed to be at six o'clock. Mr.
Mandela came to the kitchen office
where you put the food through."
Mandela had wanted to come
and meet the chef, expressing how
much he loved Spanish food while
the ambassador stood behind Man
dela whispering "Spanish, Spanish
food!" leaving Jose to change the
entire dinner from African to Span
ish food in an hour.
"But the surprise to see Mr.
Mandela in front of you was one of
the beautiful days of my life."
Jose described travelling to all
parts of the world with the principal
ambassadors he worked with, and
occasionally travelling on his own
abroad in search of recipes at the
request of the ambassadors.
"All of the ambassadors had
their own private planes. My fa
vorite ambassador asked me to find
out the recipe of a dish that he liked
in Brazil. So I had to get the plane,
go to Brazil, eat at that restaurant,
give $5OO to the chef to give me the
recipe, and make that recipe for the
ambassador. You have to under
stand, they already have every
thing. You cannot cook classics, so
you have to improve, you have to
improvise every time."
"Food is very important for
some ambassadors," Jose said in re
flecting on the importance of food
within the scope of the U.N. and in
ternational relations. "I mean,
sometimes food is religion. And
they're out of their own country, so
they want the food from their own
country."
When his daughter was born,
however, Jose retired from the
U.N., leaving with full benefits. He
and his wife, who also works in the
hospitality business, moved to the
Bay Area. After a short term of
staying at home as a retired father,
however, Jose needed to get out of
the house.
"I retired, I really didn't need to
work. But I was in the house, and I
noticed there was more work to be
done in the house, and I was the
maid of the house ... I just wanted
to get out of the house. It's not my
natural ambiance." Jose started
looking for away to fill his time out

side of his home.
Though Google wanted to hire
him, Jose came to Stanford to look
into working in one of the houses,
eventually deciding that he liked
French House. Jose explained that
working on the school year calen
dar suits him and his family, as he is
able to travel to Europe during the
summer and see his family in Spain.
"I came for one year, maybe two.
Well, now, this is my fifth year. I love
to work here with the students. It's
not a job, it's having fun. That's why
I come back every year."

The students in French House
speak highly of Jose, praising his
homemade baguettes and scrump
tious special dinners, which most re
cently featured Kobe beef and lob
ster surf 'n' turf.

Beyond getting to consistently
taste his world-class cooking skills,
the residents enjoy their relation
ship with the chef.
"He has a really funny sense of
humor," said Eduard Negiar 'l3.
"Since he knows that French House
in general is pretty liberal, he pre
tends to like Sarah Palin and stuff,"

to which the residents responded by
putting up posters of Obama all
around the kitchen.
"JJ.'s a really interesting guy,"
said Charlie Janac 'l3. "He has
some great stories to tell, and it's
pretty cool he's our chef, because,
well, the food's always great."
"I have a lot of fun with the stu
dents, it's a very fun house," Jose
said. "The most rewarding thing for
me is to see people happy with my
food. Food is one of the most diffi
cult things as a profession, to make
everyone happy in the house."

Eventually, Jose and his wife
hope to move back to Majorca or
Portugal. But for now, he likes Cali
fornia, which he says reminds him
of Majorca in some ways. He also
seems to have developed a taste for
American food. Despite his high
brow culinary education and back
ground, Jose's favorite food is Ken
tucky Fried Chicken wings. Jose
joked, "It may be junk food, but I
love it."
