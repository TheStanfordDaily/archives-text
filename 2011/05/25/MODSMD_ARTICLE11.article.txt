## KING OF THE ITCHEN RUE ROYALE TO FRENCH HOUSE ROYALTY 
### OLIVIA SIMONE JEW 
Imagine you're a chef. One day,
while preparing dinner, you hear a
knock on the door to your kitchen,
and there stands Nelson Mandela,
excitedly awaiting your food.
Not many chefs have had an experi
ence like this one, but Juan Jose, the chef
for French House and Phi Psi, has had
many extraordinary culinary and life ex
periences. For the past five years, every
weekday, from morning until night, Jose
creates delicious food for the residents of
both houses.
Juan Jose, or "J.J.," as he is fondly re
ferred to by house residents, has gone
through quite an interesting journey to
end up at Stanford.
Born in Majorca, an island off the
Mediterranean coast of Spain, Jose
trained at Le Cordon Bleu culinary acad
emy. But he didn't always know that he
wanted to become a chef. He originally
was headed for a career as a lawyer and
attended the University of Salamanca for
a short time before realizing that it wasn't
for him.

"I was the black sheep," Jose said. "I
was at the University for one year and
said 'I don't like it, I don't want to do this.'
My girlfriend and I were both rebellious,
so we both left for France. And we slept
by the beautiful river under the bridges,
with all the hippies, painters at the time."
In need of money, he got a job in the
kitchen of Maxim's, a world-famous, land
mark restaurant on the rue Royale.
Jose had no previous cooking knowl
edge, so he began with peeling potatoes
and other menial tasks. After his first
month, his supervisor told him he had the

ability to become something more in the
kitchen. He recommended Jose for Le
Cordon Bleu, the world's largest hospital
ity education institution, where renowned
chefs such as Mario Batali and Julia Child
have trained in the art of cooking.
Jose spent five years training at Le
Cordon Bleu. He was initially to learn the
craft of making sauces as a saucier. Find
ing that working as a saucier was not to his
liking, Jose then trained as a pastry chef,
and, after not enjoying either of the two
positions, he finally spent three years
training in cooking.
After Le Cordon Bleu, Jose returned
home to Majorca and worked for a yacht
company as a private chef, cooking for
various important figures visiting Major
ca. He met an ambassador who asked him
to come to New York and work as a chef
for the United Nations.
At the U.N., each ambassador has his
or her own chef who accompanies the am
bassador on trips around the world and
prepares meals for dignitaries, heads of
state, monarchs and even actors. During
his 27 years at the U.N., Jose met a range
of prominent figures, such as Nelson
Mandela, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon,
Robert Redford and Steven Spielberg.
The life of a chef in the U.N. is exciting
but also demanding. Jose described
spending 24 hours a day, seven days a
week with the ambassadors. The chefs
would spend months with the ambassa
dors while the U.N. was in session, and
then spend a month of each year volun
teering their services for a non-profit
cause, such as UNICEF or Doctors With
out Borders, as was Jose's case.
