## EDITORIAL Make the Stanford Dream Need-Blind for All 
### 
We see them in our class
rooms and cultural
shows, in our labs and on
our sports teams. They are often
distinguished by a strange accent, a
distinct garb, a new perspective in a
classroom discussion, or even by a
modest "eh" at the end of a sen
tence. Stanford's international un
dergraduate students add ines
timably to campus culture, talent
and diversity. These exceptional
men and women often travel far
from everything they have known
to experience the benefits of a
Stanford education, and, as a con
sequence, enrich the undergradu
ate experience of all students. Nev
ertheless, systemic inequity in the
Stanford admission process bars
many talented students from entry
into our classrooms, and prohibits
the best applications from ever
reaching our school.
Stanford proudly touts the fact
that 80 percent of its undergradu
ates are on some form of financial
assistance. The University further
advertises that for all domestic ap
plicants, admission is need-blind,
meaning that students are consid
ered based solely on merit and not
on ability to pay tuition. However,
for 7 percent of the class of 2011, the
admission process did not depend
so much on meritocracy. Interna
tional students are forced to let the
University know, on their applica
tions, whether they will ever require
financial aid. Those who tick the
box face an additional level of
screening, which, in the case of the
class of 2010, cut their acceptance
rate down to 3 percent. This bias is
well known among international
applicants, who often choose not to
apply at all, or who foreclose on the
opportunity to ever take aid and
later face severe financial hardship.
In its treatment of international
students, Stanford is far behind its
peer institutions. Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Dartmouth and MIT

are all need-blind for all applicants,
regardless of citizenship. On aver
age, these institutions have three
times the number of international
students on financial aid.
Frankly, current admission poli
cy betrays the University's basic
tenets of fairness and meritocracy.
Jane Stanford directed the Univer
sity to "open an avenue whereby
the deserving and exceptional may
rise through their own efforts from
the lowest to the highest station in
life." The notion that applicants
from one country should be judged
on a lower academic scale due to
wealthy donors from that country
is as absurd as applicants from
Texas being favored to those from
other states if wealthy Texans spon
sor the University. Our peer institu
tions have long forsaken such clas
sist, inequitable and aristocratic
policies in shaping their admission
departments. Yet, Stanford has
seen fit to continue judging inter
national applicants by different
standards than all other students.
Stanford administrators have
nearly uniformly expressed desire
for need-blind admission. Karen
Cooper, the Director of Financial
Aid, said she would "love to be
need-blind for international stu
dents." John Pearson, Director of
the Bechtel International Center,
said that, "ideally, it would be won
derful to be at the same state as
[our] peer schools," and that we
would likely see increased diversi
ty on campus were we to imple
ment need-blind financial aid. In
the past, President Hennessy has
also expressed a desire to make
Stanford need-blind for all stu
dents. There has also been no
shortage of student outcry against
the current policy; since 2006, there
have been six Daily articles citing
the need for more international fi
nancial aid.

Of course, the principal obstacle
to need-blind international admis
sion is cost.The University estimates
that such a policy would cost an ad
ditional $25-$3O million a year, re
quiring a $250-$3OO million addition
to our endowment to be sustainable.
The University has stated that it
would be difficult to secure dona
tions dedicated solely to interna
tional financial aid, and further that
domestic financial aid can be subsi
dized by federal and state grants,
whereas international aid cannot re
ceive such subsidies. Furthermore,
donations to international financial
aid are often given with the caveat
that they be applied only to appli
cants of a particular nationality,

while international students are in
eligible for government grants and
loans.

These difficulties, while substan
tial, should not keep Stanford from
throwing its full weight behind uni
versal need-blind admission. After
all, the University holds most of the
chips; federal and state grants con
tributed only $8 million to domestic
financial aid this year, compared to
$llB million from Stanford.
At present, Stanford's admission
department suffers from a funda
mental inefficiency. Students are
being judged eligible for a Stanford
education by different standards de
pending on their country of citizen
ship, meaning that more deserving
students are either denied admission
in favor of less deserving ones, or
don't even apply, reducing the com
petitiveness of every class to gradu
ate from our University. U.S. citizens
and international students alike

should cry out against a policy that
denies them the opportunity to col
laborate with and learn from the
best that the world has to offer. The
world should lament the loss of fu
ture leaders that may have emerged,
had they had access to a Stanford ed
ucation.
It is difficult to believe that this
University, which has recently fin
ished construction of gorgeous new
business, law and engineering facili
ties, cannot now apply its astounding
wherewithal towards opening the
American Dream the Stanford
Dream to any deserving student
regardless of geographic origin.
While we recognize the challenges
associated with this proposition, this
Editorial Board urges the Universi
ty to adopt need-blind admission for
all students. In a flat world, we sim
ply can no longer afford to keep
turning away the world's most
promising young men and women

had they had access to a Stanford ed
ucation.
It is difficult to believe that this
University, which has recently fin
ished construction of gorgeous new
business, law and engineering facili
ties, cannot now apply its astounding
wherewithal towards opening the
American Dream the Stanford
Dream to any deserving student
regardless of geographic origin.
While we recognize the challenges
associated with this proposition, this
Editorial Board urges the Universi
ty to adopt need-blind admission for
all students. In a flat world, we sim
ply can no longer afford to keep
turning away the world's most
promising young men and women
We see them in our class
rooms and cultural
shows, in our labs and on
our sports teams. They are often
distinguished by a strange accent, a
distinct garb, a new perspective in a
classroom discussion, or even by a
modest "eh" at the end of a sen
tence. Stanford's international un
dergraduate students add ines
timably to campus culture, talent
and diversity. These exceptional
men and women often travel far
from everything they have known
to experience the benefits of a
Stanford education, and, as a con
sequence, enrich the undergradu
ate experience of all students. Nev
ertheless, systemic inequity in the
Stanford admission process bars
many talented students from entry
into our classrooms, and prohibits
the best applications from ever
reaching our school.
Stanford proudly touts the fact
that 80 percent of its undergradu
ates are on some form of financial
assistance. The University further
advertises that for all domestic ap
plicants, admission is need-blind,
meaning that students are consid
ered based solely on merit and not
on ability to pay tuition. However,
for 7 percent of the class of 2011, the
admission process did not depend
so much on meritocracy. Interna
tional students are forced to let the
University know, on their applica
tions, whether they will ever require
financial aid. Those who tick the
box face an additional level of
screening, which, in the case of the
class of 2010, cut their acceptance
rate down to 3 percent. This bias is
well known among international
applicants, who often choose not to
apply at all, or who foreclose on the
opportunity to ever take aid and
later face severe financial hardship.
In its treatment of international
students, Stanford is far behind its
peer institutions. Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, Dartmouth and MIT

are all need-blind for all applicants,
regardless of citizenship. On aver
age, these institutions have three
times the number of international
students on financial aid.
Frankly, current admission poli
cy betrays the University's basic
tenets of fairness and meritocracy.
Jane Stanford directed the Univer
sity to "open an avenue whereby
the deserving and exceptional may
rise through their own efforts from
the lowest to the highest station in
life." The notion that applicants
from one country should be judged
on a lower academic scale due to
wealthy donors from that country
is as absurd as applicants from
Texas being favored to those from
other states if wealthy Texans spon
sor the University. Our peer institu
tions have long forsaken such clas
sist, inequitable and aristocratic
policies in shaping their admission
departments. Yet, Stanford has
seen fit to continue judging inter
national applicants by different
standards than all other students.
Stanford administrators have
nearly uniformly expressed desire
for need-blind admission. Karen
Cooper, the Director of Financial
Aid, said she would "love to be
need-blind for international stu
dents." John Pearson, Director of
the Bechtel International Center,
said that, "ideally, it would be won
derful to be at the same state as
[our] peer schools," and that we
would likely see increased diversi
ty on campus were we to imple
ment need-blind financial aid. In
the past, President Hennessy has
also expressed a desire to make
Stanford need-blind for all stu
dents. There has also been no
shortage of student outcry against
the current policy; since 2006, there
have been six Daily articles citing
the need for more international fi
nancial aid.

Of course, the principal obstacle
to need-blind international admis
sion is cost.The University estimates
that such a policy would cost an ad
ditional $25-$3O million a year, re
quiring a $250-$3OO million addition
to our endowment to be sustainable.
The University has stated that it
would be difficult to secure dona
tions dedicated solely to interna
tional financial aid, and further that
domestic financial aid can be subsi
dized by federal and state grants,
whereas international aid cannot re
ceive such subsidies. Furthermore,
donations to international financial
aid are often given with the caveat
that they be applied only to appli
cants of a particular nationality,

while international students are in
eligible for government grants and
loans.

These difficulties, while substan
tial, should not keep Stanford from
throwing its full weight behind uni
versal need-blind admission. After
all, the University holds most of the
chips; federal and state grants con
tributed only $8 million to domestic
financial aid this year, compared to
$llB million from Stanford.
At present, Stanford's admission
department suffers from a funda
mental inefficiency. Students are
being judged eligible for a Stanford
education by different standards de
pending on their country of citizen
ship, meaning that more deserving
students are either denied admission
in favor of less deserving ones, or
don't even apply, reducing the com
petitiveness of every class to gradu
ate from our University. U.S. citizens
and international students alike

should cry out against a policy that
denies them the opportunity to col
laborate with and learn from the
best that the world has to offer. The
world should lament the loss of fu
ture leaders that may have emerged,
had they had access to a Stanford ed
ucation.
