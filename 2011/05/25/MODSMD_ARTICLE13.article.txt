## Free Speech? 
### SEBASTAIN GOULD, '12 
Editor's Note: This is a response to
the Editorial Board's piece, "Free
Speech Rules Still Illegal," which
ran on Monday, May 23,2011.
"The pen is mightier than the
sword," Edward Bulwer-Lytton.
How does this bear on the ques
tion of free speech? My formulation
is simple: if we cannot trust students
with the Second Amendment, why
should they have access to the First?
Because misuse of the Second
Amendment has deadly conse
quences, we have limitations on the
extent to which we can exercise our
right to bear arms at schools, or
in bars, or at sporting events and
government buildings. Beyond that,
it is pretty much free reign, as long
as those few laws that do exist are
respected. We accept the unques
tioningly paternalistic guidance of
those who created the laws because
we believe that men are fallible and
some places are safer and better off
without firearms there. The benefit,
if one exists at all, is far outweighed
by the potential for harm (especial
ly in the case of the bar).
What this means for Stanford
students, though, is that they are not
responsible enough to have
firearms. Because we cannot be
trusted to handle firearms safely,
they have been removed from cam
puses. Instruments of potential
harm are too great of a temptation
for those who lack a strong moral
compass.
Why, then, do we allow those
same individuals the right to a good
education? What will stop them
from writing editorials to papers,

from creating leaflets to scatter,
from causing violent protest and
open rioting? One can do more
harm with the power of persuasion
than they can ever do by them
selves. If we accept laws that keep us
from harming ourselves, why
should we not allow them to decide
when and where we get to use our
freedom of speech? Karl Marx
started a hundred revolutions, al
beit a while after his death; presi
dents of our own country, more than
once, have led us into wars we
should not have fought.
I will ask again, one last time: if
we cannot trust a person to not
harm themselves and others with a
firearm, why can we trust them to be
safe with words? One can do even
more damage with words, a crowd
and no weapons, than one ever
could with a weapon by him or her
self. Some of us may be senators,
justices or presidents one day
can we trust them with a nation if
we cannot trust them with a cam
pus?
I left Stanford to learn the ways
of war. I could not learn about war at
Stanford, nor could I start a Stan
ford Gun Club —my application
was denied so I looked elsewhere
for that activity. Quite analogously,
if your application for a protest is
turned down, maybe you should
look elsewhere for an outlet. On
campus you are limited by tradition
and paternalistic forms of authority.
While they may seem too conserva
tive with their approach to permis
sions to run activities, they may be
right they have created a top-tier
University in only one century.
