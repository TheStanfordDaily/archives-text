# WANDERLUST
## Bon Voyage! 
### Johnny Bartz 
As we finish up the year, it's
time for me to bid my
farewells to column writing
and to Stanford. It's been a great
five-year fun, er, I mean run. I'll
start off by saying it was a pleasure
to write for you, dear reader, and I
thank you for your ongoing reader
ship.

I've taken you along with me to
Stockholm, Venice, Rio de Janeiro,
Muscat, Brisbane, Buenos Aires,
given you a crash course on flying
politesse, divulged my spring break
picks, given you the low-down on
ecotourism and discussed current
and future problems in the environ
mental sustainability of aviation.
Most importantly, I've admitted to
my double life as a Stanford student
and world traveler.

Being an ardent environmental
ist of the naturalist kind, some of my
friends and colleagues have certain
ly raised eyebrows at my travel
habits. Though flying is probably
the most carbon intensive activity
that one can perform, short of burn
ing large swaths of tropical rainfor
est, I've legitimized it to myself in
terms of the value of cultural ex
change. That is, dispelling myths

about the United States when I am
in rural areas of Brazil, promoting
others to think differently about
how the international media may
portray our country. I consider it a
form of diplomacy.
And the kicker is that if you buy
a dirt-cheap fare while you're at it,
you're not really helping out the air
line industry in that the plane is
going anyway and fleet utilization
does not depend on low-yielding
customers like us. So unless you're
buying full-fare business class tick
ets on your trip to Europe, you're
not having much of a 'consumer im
pact' on your flight you're just
filling up the plane. (Hey I think
it's a much better argument than my
vegetarian friends that only eat
meat that 'would be wasted other
wise.')
I'm not saying that you should
travel abroad every other weekend
like I've been doing lately but
maybe you should consider adding
a bit more panache to your Stanford
life with a trip once in a while. Con
sider it an educational expense.
(You can save a lot of money on
booze if you buy it in Argentina!)
Remember, your college years

are a time to explore with new
friends, surroundings and classes,
but you shouldn't just stop there.
Now is your opportunity to start ex
ploring the world. Not to mention,
there is nothing more relaxing than
forgetting all of your Stanford
stresses and problems with a week
end on Waikiki beach. Maybe the
Stanford ducks can't go south for
the entire winter, but a week is defi
nitely within reason.
So go ahead: visit your friends at
other schools. Take a risk (within
reason!) and stay with an acquain
tance from abroad. Take a quarter
to study at a Bing program, using
your location as a platform to ex
plore Europe or South America.
Write a research grant for that
short-term field research project
that you've always dreamed of (we
are a research university after all!).
You'll be refreshed, more worldly
and all-around a better person. (Ok,
so I can't guarantee that last point,
but you get the picture).
