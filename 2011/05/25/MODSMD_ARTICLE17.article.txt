## LOSS ENDS HOME SLATE 
### DANIEL E. LUPIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Playing in its final home game of
the 2011 season, the Stanford base
ball team took on the giant-slaying
Cal Poly Mustangs, owners of a 6-4
record against top-25 competition
this season. That record now stands
at 7-4.

The Cardinal (30-20, 12-12 Pac
-10), ranked No. 25 in the USA Today
Coaches' poll, had won nine of its past
12 contests and 46 of 51 all-time
games against the Mustangs (27-23,
15-9 Big West) before Tuesday. But
Stanford's offense was not able to fig
ure out Cal Poly's pitchers last night,
falling 3-1.

Sophomore third baseman
Stephen Piscotty was one of just a
handful of highlights for Stanford,
going 3-for-3 to improve his Stanford
best batting average to .364. Sopho
more outfielder Tyler Gaffney's sin
gle in the sixth extended his hit streak
to 15 games, the second-longest
streak by a Cardinal hitter this sea
son. Sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger ended an 0-for-ll slump
when he led off the second with an in
field single, inching his average to .299
after playing most of the season close
to .400.
Things didn't go as well on
the mound, at least in the early in
nings. Sophomore starter Dean
McArdle went just four innings for

Stanford, giving up four hits and all
three runs while striking out three. Ju
nior Brian Busick pitched three out
standing innings in relief for the Car
dinal, striking out three while giving
up only two hits.
The Stanford offense couldn't
capitalize on Busick's strong effort, as
Cal Poly first baseman Matt Jensen
went 3-for-4 with a home run and two
RBI enough for the win, as the

Cardinal mustered just one run.
The Cardinal started the game
promisingly enough, with McArdle
retiring the side in order in the top of
the first. Senior catcher Zach Jones
then led off the bottom half of the in
ning with his team-leading 15th dou
ble of the season, eventually scoring
on Gaffney's RBI groundout. That
double by Jones was Stanford's only
extra-base hit of the game.

McArdle struggled a little bit in
the second, as Jensen drove home D.J.
Gentile to plate Cal Poly's first run.
On offense, the Cardinal was not able
to capitalize on its opportunities,
stranding two runners in scoring posi
tion. That would be a continued
theme throughout the game for the
offense.

Both pitchers, McArdle and Cal
Poly's Kyle Anderson, cruised

through the third and fourth innings
before McArdle ran into all kinds of
problems in the fifth. Jensen contin
ued his strong performance with a
leadoff homer, his first home run of
the season. He then surrendered an
infield hit to Chris Hoo after falling
behind 3-0, and again found himself
behind 3-0 to Jimmy Allen and was
