# Defending his crown

### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
After seeing its dual-match season come to an
end on Saturday afternoon in a thriller against
the University of Virginia, the Stanford men's
tennis team sends its delegation of players back
to the Taube Tennis Center today to kick off the
NCAA Singles and Doubles Championships.
Stanford will be represented by the team of
juniors Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher in the
32-team doubles draw, with the same pair of
teammates participating in the 64-man singles
draw as well. Klahn and Thacher will be the No. 8
seed in the doubles tournament and Klahn will

be the No. 13 seed in the singles event. Thacher
received an at-large bid.
The field this year is deep, with USC's Steve
Johnson coming in as the overall No. 1 seed. Out
of his past 17 matches, Klahn's only loss was to
Johnson in the Pac-10 Singles Championships.
The singles tournament kicks off with all
first-round matches Wednesday staggered be
tween the 12 courts that comprise the Taube
Tennis Center. The doubles tournament is set to
start on Thursday, when the first-round traffic of
the singles event has died down, and will also be
held at the various Taube courts. Stanford's
matches are scheduled exclusively in the after
noon, as chosen by the host Cardinal. The two

tournaments will proceed quickly, with a round
being played in its entirety every day, setting up
the two finals to be played on Monday, May 30.
Klahn will be in the unique position of de
fending his 2010 title in the singles tournament.
A year ago at the University of Georgia, Klahn
seeded 13th, as he is this year blitzed the
field and impressively claimed the NCAA sin
gles title. He has been working all season to
reach that summit again for him, the biggest
difference this year will be playing on the home
court.

For the second straight year Bradley Klahn is the No. 13 seed in the NCAA individual tournament. Last season Klahn rode lucky number 13 to an NCAA
title. This year, he will try to defend his championship on his home courts at Stanford. Klahn's first match is today at noon at the Taube Tennis Center.
presence at Taube recently, marking
a noticeable change from much of
the regular season.
"The crowd at the NCAAs has
been unbelievable, it's something
that I've never experienced before
people coming out in bunches
and bunches," Klahn said. "The
support has really just been incred
ible, providing such an electric at
mosphere for us, I've never played
in anything like it, the stadium
rocking so much that it's basically
shaking with excitement. It juices
us players up, it really gets us going
and provides us with that little bit of
extra effort that is so important to
have in a close match."
Heading into the NCAA Singles
Championship as the defending
champion gives Klahn the prover
bial bull's-eye on his back. But
when he's asked, Klahn says the

extra pressure has barely affected
him, if at all.
"I'm not approaching it any dif
ferently," Klahn said. "It's a big
tournament, but I'm just going to
approach it the same way I do any
other tournament —by being fo
cused from the first round on, going
out there, taking care of business
and trying to play smart tennis."
After such a bitter and close de
feat, Klahn is motivated to defend
his home court and take care of
business.
"I couldn't be more excited to get
back out on the court," he said. "To
get back into that competitive at
mosphere and to try and defend my
title on my home court it's going
to be pretty cool. I definitely feel
ready to go, I can't wait."
Both Thacher and Klahn hit the
courts this afternoon for their first
round singles action, and then start
doubles play with the rest of the field
tomorrow afternoon.
