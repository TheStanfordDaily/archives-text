### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
After seeing its dual-match season come to an
end on Saturday afternoon in a thriller against
the University of Virginia, the Stanford men's
tennis team sends its delegation of players back
to the Taube Tennis Center today to kick off the
NCAA Singles and Doubles Championships.
Stanford will be represented by the team of
juniors Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher in the
32-team doubles draw, with the same pair of
teammates participating in the 64-man singles
draw as well. Klahn and Thacher will be the No. 8
seed in the doubles tournament and Klahn will

be the No. 13 seed in the singles event. Thacher
received an at-large bid.
The field this year is deep, with USC's Steve
Johnson coming in as the overall No. 1 seed. Out
of his past 17 matches, Klahn's only loss was to
Johnson in the Pac-10 Singles Championships.
The singles tournament kicks off with all
first-round matches Wednesday staggered be
tween the 12 courts that comprise the Taube
Tennis Center. The doubles tournament is set to
start on Thursday, when the first-round traffic of
the singles event has died down, and will also be
held at the various Taube courts. Stanford's
matches are scheduled exclusively in the after
noon, as chosen by the host Cardinal. The two

tournaments will proceed quickly, with a round
being played in its entirety every day, setting up
the two finals to be played on Monday, May 30.
Klahn will be in the unique position of de
fending his 2010 title in the singles tournament.
A year ago at the University of Georgia, Klahn
seeded 13th, as he is this year blitzed the
field and impressively claimed the NCAA sin
gles title. He has been working all season to
reach that summit again for him, the biggest
difference this year will be playing on the home
court.
