# Get rid of preseason polls
## 
### Kabir Sawhney Follow the Money 
As I scrolled through my
Twitter feed this morn
ing on my way to class, I
noticed the latest itera
tion of what has be
come a spring rite among college foot
ball writers: the "way too early" top 25.
This morning's rankings from Sports
Illustrated's Andy Staples looked well
thought-out and thoroughly re
searched, with a significant explana
tion of each team's current status and
the number of returning players,
alongside other factoids.
College football junkies like myself
comb over these rankings and
every other tidbit of football news that
crosses the wire but the rankings
remain an extremely flawed science.
The only reason they are so popular is
because fans can't wait for football
season to start. It's not like there's any
thing else interesting to watch the
Miami Heat's "Big Three" is dominat
ing the postseason to everyone's cha
grin and the Stanley Cup Playoffs are
in the cable netherworld of Versus.

Even so, I still think it's time to junk
preseason rankings altogether. For
starters, they are almost always proved
wrong —it is simply impossible to
predict the season's results before it
even starts. They warp perceptions
among fans and the all-important poll
voters, who are reluctant to drop a
team that doesn't lose, even if it is
clearly inferior to teams below it.
Through this mechanism, the presea
son rankings deprive deserving teams
with low rankings from getting to big
time bowl games at season's end.
The bigger problem with presea
son rankings is that they're often
based as much on fact as they are on

reputation and perceptions. Tradi
tional football powerhouses always
get the benefit of the doubt and end
up highly ranked, even if there are few
empirical reasons to believe they de
serve such a ranking. As you might ex
pect with such an exercise, teams with
a record of recent successes get
ranked pretty highly as well, even if
they lose their entire defensive front
and top offensive playmakers to the
draft or (if it's an SEC school or Ohio
State) some sort of violation-induced
ineligibility.
To illustrate my point, let's look at
Staples' rankings from last season and
compare them with how the season
actually shook out. His top team, Al
abama, underperformed expecta
tions, going 10-3 with a win in the Cap

ital One Bowl over Michigan State.
His No. 2, Boise State, almost finished
the season undefeated once again, but
lost in overtime to Nevada to lose the
WAC title and any shot at a BCS bowl.
No. 3 Ohio State was actually about on
the mark the Buckeyes finished 12-
1 after beating Arkansas in the Sugar
Bowl. No. 4 Texas was a colossal flop,
going 5-7 and 2-6 in the Big 12 to miss
out on a bowl berth (not to mention a
season-ending loss to archrival Texas
A&M). No. 5 lowa didn't do so hot ei
ther, going 8-5 after eking out a 27-24
win over Missouri in the Insight Bowl.
Meanwhile, that list has some pret
ty glaring omissions as well. The
biggest one was the failure to include
our very own Stanford Cardinal,
which (as some of you may recall) fin
ished 12-1 with a No. 4 ranking and a
romp of Virginia Tech in the Orange
Bowl. Slightly less significant was the
fact that Auburn, the eventual nation
al title winner, was also not on the list.
The best alternative is to hold off

on ranking teams at all until the sixth
week of the season, when the sports
writers and coaches who vote in the
polls have a much better idea of which
teams actually deserve a chance at a
marquee bowl game. Tradition and
perception will still undoubtedly play
a role, but teams will be unable to get a
leg up on the competition solely by
virtue of their reputation.
Of course, the worst part of moving
away from ranking teams in the pre
season is the inability of passionate
college football followers like
yours truly —to get their fix before
the season starts. I guess I'll just have
to go back to my remote, doomed to
an endless channel surf in search of
Versus (which I'm starting to suspect
doesn't really exist).

Kabir Sawhney projected Stanford to
have three losses, including one to
Washington, in the 2010 season. Give
him a low ranking at ksawhney
@stanford.edu.
