# Police chief expands on crime trends
## SUDPS says this year's trends show little change 
### MARIANNE LeVINE STAFF WRITER 
Though an increase in commu
nity alerts from the Stanford Uni
versity Department of Public Safe
ty (SUDPS) may have given the
impression crimes were on the rise
in the 2010-11 academic year, Po
lice Chief Laura Wilson said cam
pus crime trends remain similar to
those of past years.
"I believe that awareness has
been increased as a result of the in
creased number of community
alerts that have been issued, not
necessarily [due to] an increase in
the amount or type of crime," Wil
son wrote in an email to The Daily.
"My hope is that increasing aware

ness will result in people taking ap
propriate precautions to safeguard
their property and themselves."
Wilson noted that the increase
in community alerts helps fulfill
the intent of the Clery Act, a law
requiring higher education institu
tions to issue alerts about certain
types of crimes.
While crime rates overall did
not spike this year, Wilson re
vealed that three particular inci
dents that took place this year
were unusual for campus crime ac
tivity. These incidents were the
"stranger assault" at Manzanita
Field on January 3, the attempted
sexual assault in Escondido Village
on April 9 and the recent shots
fired in the Lagunita parking lot on

May 14.
Wilson also stated that there
was a noticeable increase in the
number of sexual misconduct
cases reported to both the police
and campus security authorities.
"My opinion is that the in
creased reporting does not reflect
an increase in the actual number of
sexual assaults," Wilson said.
In addition, there was also a no
table increase in the number of al
cohol transports. Wilson attributes
this increase in transports to im
provements in the staff-training
program.
"I attribute the increased num
ber of transports to the continued
education of students who hold staff
positions, such as RAs, that is slowly
changing the culture and expecta
tions around seeking assistance for
students who have made poor deci
sions that result in their needing
medical attention," Wilson said.
The main concerns for SUDPS in
the 2010-11 academic year included
non-stranger sexual assault, risky al
cohol use by students and people
visiting campus, bicycle/pedestrian
safety and student mental health.
SUDPS launched a series of new
initiatives this year to reduce cam
pus crime. Among these initiatives
was the implementation of the
Building Manager Liaison Program,
which deals with University person
nel managing the approximate 800
buildings on campus.
SUDPS is also working with the
ASSU to produce a training video
for SUDPS personnel, which "focus
es on the perceptions students, par
ticularly students of color and the
LGBT community, have when con
tacted by the police, in an effort to

continue to build community and
enhance trust between police offi
cers and the community," Wilson
said.
Wilson plans to continue to fos
ter a more trusting relationship be
tween students and campus police
next year with the implementation
of a Police Advisory Committee.
The committee will provide feed
back to SUDPS on how to best en
hance its services to the community.
According to Wilson, the committee
will include representatives from
the student body, faculty, staff and
parents.
SUDPS also intends to continue
its Community Police Academy, a
one-unit class offered to faculty, staff
and students through the Law
School. The class gives students the
opportunity to observe situations
from a police officer's point of view
and aims to develop a stronger rela
tionship between the police depart
ment and the Stanford community.
"I continue to advocate that
crime prevention is a community ef
fort and that everyone must play a
role in creating and maintaining a
safe campus," Wilson said.
