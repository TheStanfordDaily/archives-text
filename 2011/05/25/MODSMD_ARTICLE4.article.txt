## ASSU talks refunds, janitors Senators pass new bill allowing release of names 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate opened Tuesday night's meet
ing with a discussion featuring
Jeanette Smith-Laws, director of
operations and student unions.
After talking about how to better
utilize spaces in Old Union and
Tresidder, funding bills for various
student groups were all passed
unanimously, with only a few ab
stentions due to conflicts of inter
est with senators.
The first bill discussed among
the senators dealt with the special
fees refund process specifical
ly, how the identities of students
who request refunds are distrib
uted to various groups.
Sebastain Gould 'l2, an Iraq
War veteran, spoke to the Under
graduate Senate about the bill and
strongly opposed the idea of re
leasing student names to groups,
calling such a move a violation of
privacy.
"I don't think student groups
should have a list of students who
are poor or morally opposed [to a
group]," Gould said.
Senators Dan DeLong 'l3 and
Ben Laufer 'l2 said Gould's point
was valid. However, other senators
noted that the ASSU Constitution
specifically allows for student
groups to deny services to those
students who request refunds.
Senator Dan Ashton 'l4 re
sponded to concerns about group
leaders abusing these lists and said
people should trust student lead
ers to handle the lists.
"We need to have faith in stu
dents," Ashton said.
"The very reason you're pass
ing this bill is because you don't
trust students," Gould said in re
sponse.
A motion was passed to end the
debate after 30 minutes, but the
conversation continued outside of
the meeting between ASSU Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2, bill sponsor
Brianna Pang 'l3 and Gould.
Further discussion about the
issue occurred near the end of the
meeting. Following an initial 5-5
split vote, the bill kept its original
form and the senators approved
the release of both names and
SUID numbers.
The bill passed 11-1, with only
Laufer in opposition. Laufer ex
pressed lingering concerns over
giving student groups the names
of people who asked for special
fees refunds. He added that if
groups use the list, it would make

for long lines and a huge hassle for
events.
"I wanted to defend as many
privacy issues as possible," Laufer
said, while acknowledging that
groups should have the ability to
enforce regulations.
The next bill under discussion
involved the controversy regard
ing the impending layoffs of jani
tors at Stanford. Representatives
from the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) encouraged the
ASSU to pass a resolution of sup
port in an attempt pressure the
University to keep these janitors
employed.
Several senators expressed hesi
tation in encouraging the Universi
ty to engage in actions where it may
not have a legal basis. Jeff Wachtel,
senior assistant to University Presi
dent John Hennessy, has previously
said that the University "will not in
terfere in the agreement and has no
right to do so."
"I don't think this is the respon
sibility of the Undergraduate Sen
ate," Laufer said. "I don't think we
necessarily have enough informa
tion to make a decision yet. I don't
know if what we do will have any
impact on the University either."
Senator TaraTrujillo 'l4 argued
that this was an opportunity to
show that the student body cares
about the issue and to give the
University a larger reason to act.
The bill was later amended to
encourage the University based
on its moral rather than legal
obligation to act. Language
that implied the termination of
the janitors would be 'unfair' was
removed; the bill simply states
that the janitors' jobs are being
terminated. The bill was passed
unanimously after these amend
ments.
The meeting concluded with
Cruz giving his executive report to
the Senate, which included details
on a meeting with Vice Provost
Greg Boardman about the role of
the ASSU. Boardman and Cruz
also discussed plans to establish a
committee to look help work with
community centers on campus.
