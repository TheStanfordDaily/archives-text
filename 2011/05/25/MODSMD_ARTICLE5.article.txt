## Device could reduce surgical scarring 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
Stanford researchers have devel
oped a wound dressing that could
significantly reduce scar tissue
caused by incisions.
"This work actually started 20
years ago when I was an intern at
Massachusetts General Hospital,"
lead author Geoffrey Gurtner said
in a press release. "I realized early on
that we were not going to solve the
problem of scarring with current sur
gical tools and techniques."
Gurtner is professor and associ
ate chair of surgery at Stanford.
After surgery, when sutures are
removed, the surrounding skin pulls
the edges of incisions in different di
rections, causing scar tissue to thick
en and spread. The new dressing
eliminates this tension and reduces a
considerable amount of scarring.
Co-author Reinhold Dauskardt,
professor of materials science and
engineering, and his peers devel
oped the dressing in his lab. It is
made of a thin and elastic silicone
plastic, which is stretched over
wounds after sutures are removed.
An adhesive is added to the dressing
to help it stick to the patient's skin.
The dressing contracts and provides
uniform compression on the wound.
Scar tissue is less flexible than
normal skin and can cause problems
like limited motion. According to
the study's authors, current meth
ods of removing scars for in
stance, surgical excision, steroid in
jections and laser therapy are
generally expensive, painful or inef
fective.
The device was tested in pigs,
which have similar skin to that of
humans. The device reduced the
area of scars caused by one inch in
cisions by six-fold compared to pigs
in a control group with the same
sized incisions. The study said the
stress-shielded wounds showed al
most scarless closures eight weeks
after sutures were removed.
The wound dressing has also
been tested on nine female patients
who had undergone abdominoplas
ties, or tummy tucks. The authors
noted that some of these wounds
demonstrated varying degrees of
improvement. They speculate this
may have been due to differences in
the amount of tension present in the
dressings when they were applied to
the wounds. The researchers cau
tioned that this was a preliminary
clinical study.
The authors have indicated that
larger clinical trials are being
planned, with the dual objectives of
including greater ethnic diversity
among the patient population and
identifying the ideal range of stress
shielding forces for wounds.
