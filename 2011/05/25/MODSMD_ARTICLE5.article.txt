## Device could reduce surgical scarring 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Billy Gallagher 
Stanford researchers have devel
oped a wound dressing that could
significantly reduce scar tissue
caused by incisions.
"This work actually started 20
years ago when I was an intern at
Massachusetts General Hospital,"
lead author Geoffrey Gurtner said
in a press release. "I realized early on
that we were not going to solve the
problem of scarring with current sur
gical tools and techniques."
Gurtner is professor and associ
ate chair of surgery at Stanford.
After surgery, when sutures are
removed, the surrounding skin pulls
the edges of incisions in different di
rections, causing scar tissue to thick
en and spread. The new dressing
eliminates this tension and reduces a
considerable amount of scarring.
Co-author Reinhold Dauskardt,
professor of materials science and
engineering, and his peers devel
oped the dressing in his lab. It is
made of a thin and elastic silicone
plastic, which is stretched over
wounds after sutures are removed.
An adhesive is added to the dressing
to help it stick to the patient's skin.
The dressing contracts and provides
uniform compression on the wound.
