# CHAMPIONS NO MORE
## CARD UNABLE TO DEFEND NATIONAL TITLE 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Last year, sophomore Mallory Burdette
was the heroine of the Stanford Cardinal,
clinching the 4-3 victory over the Florida
Gators to win the 2010 Women's Tennis Na
tional Championship. This year was a differ
ent story. With the match score tied at 3-3,
the pressure of victory once again fell on
Burdette's shoulders. Despite saving four
match points, Burdette lost to Gator sopho
more Lauren Embree 5-7,6-3,7-6 (8-6), and
the 2011 national championship went to
Florida with a final score of 4-3.

"Obviously it's not as fun being on this
side," Burdette said, fighting back tears.
"But I had my game plan when I went out
there today, and I executed pretty well for
most of the match ... I'm pretty proud of
the way I played, but obviously I came up a
little short"
Stanford's loss ended a 184-match win
ning streak at the Taube Tennis Center that
began in February 1999.
The title came down to Burdette's roller
coaster match after Stanford relinquished a

3-1 lead. After dropping the doubles point,
the Cardinal quickly won five first sets in
singles at the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 matches
and looked poised to win its 17th national
title. Instead, junior Veronica Li and senior
Carolyn McVeigh each lost three-setters,
meaning the match came down to Burdette
vs. Embree on court two.
Missing from Stanford's lineup was Pac
-10 champion Kristie Ahn, sidelined from
the championship match with an ankle in
jury that was re-tweaked in her semifinal
match against Baylor. With her on the side
lines, the doubles lineup was almost entirely
new. There was still Hilary Barte and Bur
dette teaming up at the top, but the second
team consisted of freshman Nicole Gibbs
and Li, moving up from her usual spot at No.
3 doubles. Carolyn McVeigh, Li's usual part
ner, was paired with sophomore StaceyTan.
"It's hard to lose an impact player like
[Ahn]," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "But we felt comfortable with the
lineup we were putting out today. There was
no question [Ahn] was going to take up
space. We were going to play with six
healthy players for a chance to win ... we
felt good about that, and we came pretty
close."

The new pairings combined with the
Gators' mastery of doubles play meant the

A year after winning the clinching match in the title showdown, Stanford sophomore Mallory Burdette, above, dropped the decisive match in
this year's championship to Florida's Lauren Embree. Burdette won the first set and had a 4-0 lead in the third, but was unable to hold on.


MIKE KHEIR/The Stanford Daily
Stanford's three seniors, from left to right, Jennifer
Yen, Carolyn McVeigh and Hilary Barte, hold up the
runner-up trophy. Barte won her No. 1 singles match
while McVeigh lost at No. 6. Yen didn't compete.
day started poorly for the Cardinal
(28-1). All Stanford pairs struggled to
get points despite regularly getting to
deuce or earning advantage points.
The team appeared timid initially,
letting Florida (31-1) run out to early
leads. The match was eventually
clinched when the Gators won the
No. 3 doubles.
In singles, the Cardinal came out
reinvigorated and grabbed momen
tum early. On court one, Barte in
her final dual match in a Cardinal
uniform channeled four years of
energy into a truly dominant per
formance. Her opponent, Allie Will,
rarely gained momentum in the
match and as Will's shrieks echoed
around the stadium, Barte, the na
tion's No. 3 player, rode the crowd's
energy to a 6-2,6-4 victory and Stan
ford's first point of the day.
Over on court two, Burdette ran
into early trouble. In a difficult
matchup, Burdette's hard-hitting and
accurate baseline game was matched
against the defensive- and move
ment-focused game of Embree. Her
Gator opponent frequently returned
consecutive balls and continued to
force Burdette to hit extra shots. De
spite winning the first game, Bur
dette found herself in a 1-5 hole.
Gibbs quickly got the crowd be
hind her on court three with loud,
demonstrative celebrations. She
struggled in her semifinal match
against Baylor, but in this match, she
was back to her winning ways. She
was second off the court with a 6-4,7-
5 score, putting Stanford ahead 2-1.
With five of Stanford's players win
ning their first set, the day was look
ing positive for the Cardinal.
Back on court two, Burdette
found her top game and orchestrated
an incredible rally back from 1-5
down. Reeling off six games in a row,
Burdette used good net play to take
the first set 7-5.
Meanwhile, McVeigh was locked
in a tight first set at No. 6. She and
Florida's Olivia Janowicz played to a
tiebreaker in the first set and
McVeigh staved off a set point and
eventually pulled out the set to a loud
cheer from the crowd.
Tan, also on the outside courts,
was already in the third set of her
match, having lost the first and dom
inated in the second when McVeigh
wrapped up her first set. The crucial
game came at 4-4 for Tan. Her oppo

nent, the Gators' Joanna Mather,
called a ball out. After the umpire
overturned the ball, Tan had a game
point instead of a break point. De
spite losing the next point, Mather
botched an overhead to give Tan a
second game point. Mather again
dug in and won the next point, but
Tan hit a massive swinging volley
from the service line to win her third
game point. She capitalized on this
one to gain the 5-4 lead and all mo
mentum was hers.
Tan earned four match points in
the next game, taking the match 3-6,
6-2,6-4. The win also gave Stanford a
3-1 lead, putting the Cardinal one
point away from its second national
title in as many years.
After Tan's win, though, it was all
downhill for the Cardinal. Burdette
dropped the second set 6-3 on court
two, and Li, after winning the first set,
lost the next two to Florida's Alex
Cercone. That narrowed the Cardi
nal lead to 3-2.
Burdette started the third set on
fire, giving Stanford fans a glimpse of
the end line and the national title. Up
4-0 and showing no signs of slowing
down until a sudden hiccup occurred,
Burdette lost control of her ground
strokes and was broken at love. Sud

denly, Embree was there to pounce.
As Burdette's energy waned, Em
bree fought all the way back to take a
5-4 lead before Burdette won anoth
er game but only after fighting off
two match points.
Janowicz proved too tough in the
third set, and outlasted McVeigh, 6-
7(8-6). 6-3,6-1 and all eyes in the sta
dium turned to Burdette and Em
bree. With both players exhausted
from long rallies at the baseline, the
match was tied 6-6 and headed to a
tiebreaker with the NCAA Champi
onship on the line.
Burdette went up 2-0 on a power
ful forehand and a brilliant low pick
up volley. A few unforced errors
later, and all of a sudden Embree had
a 4-2 lead. Again, Burdette fought
back using two volleys to tie the score
at 4-4. After failing to return a fast
serve to the body and sending a tired
forehand long, Embree had two
championship points. Burdette saved
both again, bringing the score to 6-6,
with both players needing to win by
two to earn the championship.

Burdette controlled the next
point and had an overhead to give
her the lead and a championship
point. However the overhead caught
the frame of her racket and went into

the net. Ultimately, Burdette lost the
final point of the season on a fore
hand that sailed long. As Stanford
fans leaned back in shock, the few
Gator fans who made the trip began
their cheering.
Stanford's record-breaking streak
ended in fittingly dramatic fashion
for a team with such an impressive
winning streak. The bar remains at
184 undefeated home wins dating
back to February 12,1999 over a
decade of dominance at Taube Ten
nis Center.

Forood says she's pleased with the
way her players battled through in
jury and adversity, and enjoyed the
home support.
"It was an incredible match," she

said. "It was the most electric atmos
phere I think I've experienced in a
college tennis match. It was an amaz
ing day, and we just came up a little
short today."
When asked about the streak,
Forood believed it wasn't the most
important thing the team lost today.
"We know it's not going to go on
to infinity," she said. "At some point
we're going to take a loss here, and
we'll just start over again. It hap
pened to be today. The streak doesn't
mean a lot to us. It's interesting, but

it's not a motivating thing."

For Barte, the match stands as the
last team competition of her illustri
ous career.

"With this team especially, we had
a lot of mountains to climb, and we

climbed them," she said. "The memo
ries that I'm going to take away from
the team, I'm going to have them for
the rest of my life."
Despite the loss in the finals, Stan
ford still brought home a few acco
lades for the night. Barte was named
to the top spot of the All-Tourna
ment Team, Gibbs earned the third
spot and McVeigh earned the sixth
spot. In doubles, Barte and Burdette
earned first spot All-Tournament
Team.

Stanford's season isn't completely
over. No. 3 Barte, Gibbs, Ahn, Bur
dette and Tan are all slated to play in
the NCAA Individual Champi
onships beginning today though
Ahn may not compete because of her
injury. Barte and Burdette, the No. 4
doubles team in the nation, and Ahn
and Gibbs are scheduled to compete
in doubles starting Thursday.

point and had an overhead to give
her the lead and a championship
point. However the overhead caught
the frame of her racket and went into

the net. Ultimately, Burdette lost the
final point of the season on a fore
hand that sailed long. As Stanford
fans leaned back in shock, the few
Gator fans who made the trip began

Stanford's record-breaking streak
ended in fittingly dramatic fashion

way her players battled through in
jury and adversity, and enjoyed the

"It was an incredible match," she

said. "It was the most electric atmos

college tennis match. It was an amaz
ing day, and we just came up a little
short today."
When asked about the streak,
Forood believed it wasn't the most
important thing the team lost today.
"We know it's not going to go on
to infinity," she said. "At some point
we're going to take a loss here, and
we'll just start over again. It hap
pened to be today. The streak doesn't
mean a lot to us. It's interesting, but

it's not a motivating thing."

For Barte, the match stands as the
last team competition of her illustri
ous career.

"With this team especially, we had
a lot of mountains to climb, and we

climbed them," she said. "The memo
ries that I'm going to take away from
the team, I'm going to have them for
the rest of my life."
Despite the loss in the finals, Stan
ford still brought home a few acco
lades for the night. Barte was named
to the top spot of the All-Tourna
ment Team, Gibbs earned the third
spot and McVeigh earned the sixth
spot. In doubles, Barte and Burdette
earned first spot All-Tournament

Stanford's season isn't completely

Sophomore Mallory Burdette will be
back in action in the women's invididual
tournament beginning
today. She and Barte will also try for
the women's doubles title together
starting tomorrow.
Last year, sophomore Mallory Burdette
was the heroine of the Stanford Cardinal,
clinching the 4-3 victory over the Florida
Gators to win the 2010 Women's Tennis Na
tional Championship. This year was a differ
ent story. With the match score tied at 3-3,
the pressure of victory once again fell on
Burdette's shoulders. Despite saving four
match points, Burdette lost to Gator sopho
more Lauren Embree 5-7,6-3,7-6 (8-6), and
the 2011 national championship went to
Florida with a final score of 4-3.

"Obviously it's not as fun being on this
side," Burdette said, fighting back tears.
"But I had my game plan when I went out
there today, and I executed pretty well for
most of the match ... I'm pretty proud of
the way I played, but obviously I came up a
little short"
Stanford's loss ended a 184-match win
ning streak at the Taube Tennis Center that
began in February 1999.
The title came down to Burdette's roller
coaster match after Stanford relinquished a

3-1 lead. After dropping the doubles point,
the Cardinal quickly won five first sets in
singles at the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 matches
and looked poised to win its 17th national
title. Instead, junior Veronica Li and senior
Carolyn McVeigh each lost three-setters,
meaning the match came down to Burdette
vs. Embree on court two.
Missing from Stanford's lineup was Pac
-10 champion Kristie Ahn, sidelined from
the championship match with an ankle in
jury that was re-tweaked in her semifinal
match against Baylor. With her on the side
lines, the doubles lineup was almost entirely
new. There was still Hilary Barte and Bur
dette teaming up at the top, but the second
team consisted of freshman Nicole Gibbs
and Li, moving up from her usual spot at No.
3 doubles. Carolyn McVeigh, Li's usual part
ner, was paired with sophomore StaceyTan.
"It's hard to lose an impact player like
[Ahn]," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "But we felt comfortable with the
lineup we were putting out today. There was
no question [Ahn] was going to take up
space. We were going to play with six
healthy players for a chance to win ... we
felt good about that, and we came pretty

A year after winning the clinching match in the title showdown, Stanford sophomore Mallory Burdette, above, dropped the decisive match in
this year's championship to Florida's Lauren Embree. Burdette won the first set and had a 4-0 lead in the third, but was unable to hold on.

Stanford's three seniors, from left to right, Jennifer

day started poorly for the Cardinal
(28-1). All Stanford pairs struggled to
get points despite regularly getting to
deuce or earning advantage points.
The team appeared timid initially,
letting Florida (31-1) run out to early
leads. The match was eventually
clinched when the Gators won the
No. 3 doubles.
In singles, the Cardinal came out
reinvigorated and grabbed momen
tum early. On court one, Barte in
her final dual match in a Cardinal
uniform channeled four years of
energy into a truly dominant per
formance. Her opponent, Allie Will,
rarely gained momentum in the
match and as Will's shrieks echoed
around the stadium, Barte, the na
tion's No. 3 player, rode the crowd's
energy to a 6-2,6-4 victory and Stan
ford's first point of the day.
Over on court two, Burdette ran
into early trouble. In a difficult
matchup, Burdette's hard-hitting and
accurate baseline game was matched
against the defensive- and move
ment-focused game of Embree. Her
Gator opponent frequently returned
consecutive balls and continued to
force Burdette to hit extra shots. De
spite winning the first game, Bur
dette found herself in a 1-5 hole.
Gibbs quickly got the crowd be
hind her on court three with loud,
demonstrative celebrations. She
struggled in her semifinal match
against Baylor, but in this match, she
was back to her winning ways. She
was second off the court with a 6-4,7-
5 score, putting Stanford ahead 2-1.
With five of Stanford's players win
ning their first set, the day was look
ing positive for the Cardinal.
Back on court two, Burdette
found her top game and orchestrated
an incredible rally back from 1-5
down. Reeling off six games in a row,
Burdette used good net play to take
the first set 7-5.
Meanwhile, McVeigh was locked
in a tight first set at No. 6. She and
Florida's Olivia Janowicz played to a
tiebreaker in the first set and
McVeigh staved off a set point and
eventually pulled out the set to a loud
cheer from the crowd.
Tan, also on the outside courts,
was already in the third set of her
match, having lost the first and dom
inated in the second when McVeigh
wrapped up her first set. The crucial
game came at 4-4 for Tan. Her oppo

nent, the Gators' Joanna Mather,
called a ball out. After the umpire
overturned the ball, Tan had a game
point instead of a break point. De
spite losing the next point, Mather
botched an overhead to give Tan a
second game point. Mather again
dug in and won the next point, but
Tan hit a massive swinging volley
from the service line to win her third
game point. She capitalized on this
one to gain the 5-4 lead and all mo
mentum was hers.
Tan earned four match points in
the next game, taking the match 3-6,
6-2,6-4. The win also gave Stanford a
3-1 lead, putting the Cardinal one
point away from its second national
title in as many years.
After Tan's win, though, it was all
downhill for the Cardinal. Burdette
dropped the second set 6-3 on court
two, and Li, after winning the first set,
lost the next two to Florida's Alex
Cercone. That narrowed the Cardi
nal lead to 3-2.
Burdette started the third set on
fire, giving Stanford fans a glimpse of
the end line and the national title. Up
4-0 and showing no signs of slowing
down until a sudden hiccup occurred,
Burdette lost control of her ground
strokes and was broken at love. Sud

denly, Embree was there to pounce.
As Burdette's energy waned, Em
bree fought all the way back to take a
5-4 lead before Burdette won anoth
er game but only after fighting off
two match points.
Janowicz proved too tough in the
third set, and outlasted McVeigh, 6-
7(8-6). 6-3,6-1 and all eyes in the sta
dium turned to Burdette and Em
bree. With both players exhausted
from long rallies at the baseline, the
match was tied 6-6 and headed to a
tiebreaker with the NCAA Champi
onship on the line.
Burdette went up 2-0 on a power
ful forehand and a brilliant low pick
up volley. A few unforced errors
later, and all of a sudden Embree had
a 4-2 lead. Again, Burdette fought
back using two volleys to tie the score
at 4-4. After failing to return a fast
serve to the body and sending a tired
forehand long, Embree had two
championship points. Burdette saved
both again, bringing the score to 6-6,
with both players needing to win by
two to earn the championship.

Burdette controlled the next
point and had an overhead to give
her the lead and a championship
point. However the overhead caught
the frame of her racket and went into

ning their first set, the day was look
ing positive for the Cardinal.
Back on court two, Burdette
found her top game and orchestrated
an incredible rally back from 1-5
down. Reeling off six games in a row,
Burdette used good net play to take
the first set 7-5.
Meanwhile, McVeigh was locked
in a tight first set at No. 6. She and
Florida's Olivia Janowicz played to a
tiebreaker in the first set and
McVeigh staved off a set point and
eventually pulled out the set to a loud
cheer from the crowd.
Tan, also on the outside courts,
was already in the third set of her
match, having lost the first and dom
inated in the second when McVeigh
wrapped up her first set. The crucial
game came at 4-4 for Tan. Her oppo

nent, the Gators' Joanna Mather,
called a ball out. After the umpire
overturned the ball, Tan had a game
point instead of a break point. De
spite losing the next point, Mather
botched an overhead to give Tan a
second game point. Mather again
dug in and won the next point, but
Tan hit a massive swinging volley
from the service line to win her third
game point. She capitalized on this
one to gain the 5-4 lead and all mo
mentum was hers.
Tan earned four match points in
the next game, taking the match 3-6,
6-2,6-4. The win also gave Stanford a
3-1 lead, putting the Cardinal one
point away from its second national
title in as many years.
After Tan's win, though, it was all
downhill for the Cardinal. Burdette
dropped the second set 6-3 on court
two, and Li, after winning the first set,
lost the next two to Florida's Alex
Cercone. That narrowed the Cardi
nal lead to 3-2.
Burdette started the third set on
fire, giving Stanford fans a glimpse of
the end line and the national title. Up
4-0 and showing no signs of slowing
down until a sudden hiccup occurred,
Burdette lost control of her ground
strokes and was broken at love. Sud

denly, Embree was there to pounce.
As Burdette's energy waned, Em
bree fought all the way back to take a
5-4 lead before Burdette won anoth
er game but only after fighting off
two match points.
Janowicz proved too tough in the
third set, and outlasted McVeigh, 6-
7(8-6). 6-3,6-1 and all eyes in the sta
dium turned to Burdette and Em
bree. With both players exhausted
from long rallies at the baseline, the
match was tied 6-6 and headed to a
tiebreaker with the NCAA Champi
onship on the line.
Burdette went up 2-0 on a power
ful forehand and a brilliant low pick
up volley. A few unforced errors
later, and all of a sudden Embree had
a 4-2 lead. Again, Burdette fought
back using two volleys to tie the score
at 4-4. After failing to return a fast
serve to the body and sending a tired
forehand long, Embree had two
championship points. Burdette saved
both again, bringing the score to 6-6,
with both players needing to win by
two to earn the championship.

Burdette controlled the next
point and had an overhead to give
her the lead and a championship
point. However the overhead caught
the frame of her racket and went into

the net. Ultimately, Burdette lost the
final point of the season on a fore
hand that sailed long. As Stanford
fans leaned back in shock, the few
Gator fans who made the trip began
their cheering.
Stanford's record-breaking streak
ended in fittingly dramatic fashion
for a team with such an impressive
winning streak. The bar remains at
184 undefeated home wins dating
back to February 12,1999 over a
decade of dominance at Taube Ten
nis Center.

Forood says she's pleased with the
way her players battled through in
jury and adversity, and enjoyed the
home support.
"It was an incredible match," she

said. "It was the most electric atmos
phere I think I've experienced in a
college tennis match. It was an amaz
ing day, and we just came up a little
short today."
When asked about the streak,
Forood believed it wasn't the most
important thing the team lost today.
"We know it's not going to go on
to infinity," she said. "At some point
we're going to take a loss here, and
we'll just start over again. It hap
pened to be today. The streak doesn't
mean a lot to us. It's interesting, but

it's not a motivating thing."

For Barte, the match stands as the
last team competition of her illustri
ous career.

"With this team especially, we had
a lot of mountains to climb, and we

climbed them," she said. "The memo
ries that I'm going to take away from
the team, I'm going to have them for
the rest of my life."
Despite the loss in the finals, Stan
ford still brought home a few acco
lades for the night. Barte was named
to the top spot of the All-Tourna
ment Team, Gibbs earned the third
spot and McVeigh earned the sixth
spot. In doubles, Barte and Burdette
earned first spot All-Tournament
Team.

Stanford's season isn't completely
over. No. 3 Barte, Gibbs, Ahn, Bur
dette and Tan are all slated to play in
the NCAA Individual Champi
onships beginning today though
Ahn may not compete because of her
injury. Barte and Burdette, the No. 4
doubles team in the nation, and Ahn
and Gibbs are scheduled to compete
in doubles starting Thursday.

Stanford senior Hilary Barte got the
Cardinal on the board with a 6-2,
6-4 victory at the No. 1 spot. Barte,
the No. 3 player in the nation, started
a run of three consecutive Stanford
singles victories giving the Card
a 3-1 lead.

Sophomore Mallory Burdette will be
back in action in the women's invididual
tournament beginning
today. She and Barte will also try for
the women's doubles title together
starting tomorrow.
Last year, sophomore Mallory Burdette
was the heroine of the Stanford Cardinal,
clinching the 4-3 victory over the Florida
Gators to win the 2010 Women's Tennis Na
tional Championship. This year was a differ
ent story. With the match score tied at 3-3,
the pressure of victory once again fell on
Burdette's shoulders. Despite saving four
match points, Burdette lost to Gator sopho
more Lauren Embree 5-7,6-3,7-6 (8-6), and
the 2011 national championship went to
Florida with a final score of 4-3.

"Obviously it's not as fun being on this
side," Burdette said, fighting back tears.
"But I had my game plan when I went out
there today, and I executed pretty well for
most of the match ... I'm pretty proud of
the way I played, but obviously I came up a
little short"
Stanford's loss ended a 184-match win
ning streak at the Taube Tennis Center that
began in February 1999.
The title came down to Burdette's roller
coaster match after Stanford relinquished a

3-1 lead. After dropping the doubles point,
the Cardinal quickly won five first sets in
singles at the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 matches
and looked poised to win its 17th national
title. Instead, junior Veronica Li and senior
Carolyn McVeigh each lost three-setters,
meaning the match came down to Burdette
vs. Embree on court two.
Missing from Stanford's lineup was Pac
-10 champion Kristie Ahn, sidelined from
the championship match with an ankle in
jury that was re-tweaked in her semifinal
match against Baylor. With her on the side
lines, the doubles lineup was almost entirely
new. There was still Hilary Barte and Bur
dette teaming up at the top, but the second
team consisted of freshman Nicole Gibbs
and Li, moving up from her usual spot at No.
3 doubles. Carolyn McVeigh, Li's usual part
ner, was paired with sophomore StaceyTan.
"It's hard to lose an impact player like
[Ahn]," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "But we felt comfortable with the
lineup we were putting out today. There was
no question [Ahn] was going to take up
space. We were going to play with six
healthy players for a chance to win ... we
felt good about that, and we came pretty
close."

The new pairings combined with the
Gators' mastery of doubles play meant the

A year after winning the clinching match in the title showdown, Stanford sophomore Mallory Burdette, above, dropped the decisive match in
this year's championship to Florida's Lauren Embree. Burdette won the first set and had a 4-0 lead in the third, but was unable to hold on.

Stanford's three seniors, from left to right, Jennifer
Yen, Carolyn McVeigh and Hilary Barte, hold up the
runner-up trophy. Barte won her No. 1 singles match
while McVeigh lost at No. 6. Yen didn't compete.
day started poorly for the Cardinal
(28-1). All Stanford pairs struggled to
get points despite regularly getting to
deuce or earning advantage points.
The team appeared timid initially,
letting Florida (31-1) run out to early
leads. The match was eventually
clinched when the Gators won the
No. 3 doubles.
In singles, the Cardinal came out
reinvigorated and grabbed momen
tum early. On court one, Barte in
her final dual match in a Cardinal
uniform channeled four years of
energy into a truly dominant per
formance. Her opponent, Allie Will,
rarely gained momentum in the
match and as Will's shrieks echoed
around the stadium, Barte, the na
tion's No. 3 player, rode the crowd's
energy to a 6-2,6-4 victory and Stan
ford's first point of the day.
Over on court two, Burdette ran
into early trouble. In a difficult
matchup, Burdette's hard-hitting and
accurate baseline game was matched
against the defensive- and move
ment-focused game of Embree. Her
Gator opponent frequently returned
consecutive balls and continued to
force Burdette to hit extra shots. De
spite winning the first game, Bur
dette found herself in a 1-5 hole.
Gibbs quickly got the crowd be
hind her on court three with loud,
demonstrative celebrations. She
struggled in her semifinal match
against Baylor, but in this match, she
was back to her winning ways. She
was second off the court with a 6-4,7-
5 score, putting Stanford ahead 2-1.
