# CHAMPIONS NO MORE
## CARD UNABLE TO DEFEND NATIONAL TITLE 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
Last year, sophomore Mallory Burdette
was the heroine of the Stanford Cardinal,
clinching the 4-3 victory over the Florida
Gators to win the 2010 Women's Tennis Na
tional Championship. This year was a differ
ent story. With the match score tied at 3-3,
the pressure of victory once again fell on
Burdette's shoulders. Despite saving four
match points, Burdette lost to Gator sopho
more Lauren Embree 5-7,6-3,7-6 (8-6), and
the 2011 national championship went to
Florida with a final score of 4-3.

"Obviously it's not as fun being on this
side," Burdette said, fighting back tears.
"But I had my game plan when I went out
there today, and I executed pretty well for
most of the match ... I'm pretty proud of
the way I played, but obviously I came up a
little short"
Stanford's loss ended a 184-match win
ning streak at the Taube Tennis Center that
began in February 1999.
The title came down to Burdette's roller
coaster match after Stanford relinquished a

3-1 lead. After dropping the doubles point,
the Cardinal quickly won five first sets in
singles at the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 matches
and looked poised to win its 17th national
title. Instead, junior Veronica Li and senior
Carolyn McVeigh each lost three-setters,
meaning the match came down to Burdette
vs. Embree on court two.
Missing from Stanford's lineup was Pac
-10 champion Kristie Ahn, sidelined from
the championship match with an ankle in
jury that was re-tweaked in her semifinal
match against Baylor. With her on the side
lines, the doubles lineup was almost entirely
new. There was still Hilary Barte and Bur
dette teaming up at the top, but the second
team consisted of freshman Nicole Gibbs
and Li, moving up from her usual spot at No.
3 doubles. Carolyn McVeigh, Li's usual part
ner, was paired with sophomore StaceyTan.
"It's hard to lose an impact player like
[Ahn]," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "But we felt comfortable with the
lineup we were putting out today. There was
no question [Ahn] was going to take up
space. We were going to play with six
healthy players for a chance to win ... we
felt good about that, and we came pretty
close."

The new pairings combined with the
Gators' mastery of doubles play meant the
