## SEEING GREEN How Tree-Hugging Became a Competitive Sport 
### Holly Moeller 
In 2007,1 wrote my first "Seeing
Green" piece while stranded in
Princeton's student center (I
went to the public rival-down-the
road, Rutgers) as my boyfriend
coached swim practice. The column,
"Oil for Breakfast," detailed the
myriad invisible ways fossil fuels
support our daily lives fueling the
machine to fix the nitrogen to fertil
ize the corn to feed the pig to make
the sausage, for example.
I recently read back over that first
essay with some amusement. First, I
had listed the price of gas at $ 1.95 per
gallon. Second, the final copy suf
fered from several grammatical mis
steps introduced by an overzealous
editor (which reminds me of how
grateful I am for Kristian's patience
with me this year).
Four years later, the numbers cer
tainly need updating, but the col
umn's message is as disturbingly true
as ever. But is it as shocking?
Maybe I'm just enrobing myself
in thicker and thicker bubbles, but it
seems to me that we're far more en
vironmentally aware than we used to
be. As the price of oil steadily rises
and global warming predictions
swirl around our shared conscious
ness, we're constantly alerted to the
many ways we depend on emitting
carbon dioxide. And environmental
catastrophes like the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill last year or this
year's threat of radiation leakage
keep ecological issues on the news
docket.
We've come a long way in the
150-plus years that separate us from
transcendentalists like Emerson and
Thoreau, whose writings are some
times identified as the origin of the
environmental movement. The au
thors introduced a foreign concept
to America's Puritan tame-the
wilderness roots when they suggest
ed that, perhaps, that very wilderness
might have some spiritual value.
Although such ideas have long
been appreciated by those of us who
find solace in pristine landscapes and
silent forests, the environmental
movement didn't really catch on
until it became obvious that hurting
the planet also hurts us.That's why so
many of us have heard of Rachel
Carson: her 1962 book, "Silent
Spring," outlined clear linkages be
tween pesticide use, environmental
degradation and human health.
Suddenly, the country was up in
arms. Spurred on by Carson's words
and environmental disasters like the
1969 Cuyahoga River Fire, America
founded the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, passed the Clean Air
Act and vowed to protect endan
gered species. The effects were as
tounding. Despite industry protests,
we cleaned our waterways, filtered
our smokestacks and blocked major
construction projects in National
Parks.

America was Beautiful again.
But once the immediately appar
ent dangers were addressed, many
Americans lost interest. A radical
few operated on the outskirts, chain
ing themselves to trees or calling for
voluntary human extinction. Their
antics garnered attention, but little
sympathy. As far as most Americans
were concerned, the environmental
crisis was over.

Of course, they were wrong. At
the same time that we were celebrat
ing our grand environmental
cleanup, the phrase "climate
change" was making its rounds in sci
entific circles. It is this latest crisis
that has reawakened the environ
mental movement or, at least, a
modern version of it.
The carbon dioxide problem is a
harder sell than its predecessors. We
can't flash photos of sick seabirds
like we do after major oil spills. We
can't highlight elevated skin cancer
rates like we did to close the ozone
hole. But what the issue lacks in
charisma, we've made up for with
marketing.
Depending upon whether you
believe that the ends justify the
means and what ends you find ac
ceptable you may or may not ap
prove of the current popularization
of environmentalism. Sure, there are
plenty of people who are curbing
their carbon footprints because they
understand the global ramifications
of their actions. Some of them prob
ably started after they watched A1
Gore's movie or listened to a scien
tist's testimony. Many still respond to
the call of the wild or feel an ethical
duty to protect nature. But most peo
ple who have gone green did it be
cause it was trendy.
"Greenwashing" is America's lat
est fad. Corporations use environ
mentalism often coupled with
personal health benefits to move
products. Just as we had to have
those colorful sunglasses or coveted
the latest Apple product, we've
made following the ecotrends de
rigueur in many social circles. De
pending on which marketing survey
you read (i.e., whether it's one that's
trying to inflate the earth-friendly
market share or not), up to 83 per
cent of Americans have gone green
with their pocketbooks in some way
for a variety of reasons.
This modern commercialization
of environmentalism is at once both
restrictive and expansive. Its mes
sages are none too scientific, and its
motivation is, frankly, profit. But it's
also engaged a growing swath of
Americans, some of whom will even
tually graduate from buying recycled
toilet paper, to biking to work, to
backyard composting. And as eco
nomic downturns transform us from
spendthrifts to penny pinchers, the
old mantras of "waste not, want not"
and "every little bit helps" apply
equally well to environmental goals
as to financial ones.
So maybe that's the message for
the seasoned tree-hugger and for the
environmental neophyte. Keep
going green. And when you're there,
go greener.
