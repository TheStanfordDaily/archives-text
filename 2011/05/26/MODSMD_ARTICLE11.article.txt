Do Not Soap
Fountains!
Dear Editor,
In the last two days, four of Stan
ford's decorative fountains were
soaped. Although soaping foun
tains is not a new prank, as the cam

pus manager for Water Conserva
tion I'd like to remind those who
soap fountains that this activity
wastes our valuable resources.
Soaped fountains have to be
drained and flushed, wasting water,
and staff have to be taken off other
tasks to clean up the fountains and
associated plumbing. Stanford has

many beautiful fountains for all to
enjoy, but when they are soaped
they have to be turned off for drain
ing and cleaning. Please spread the
message: "Do not soap fountains!"
