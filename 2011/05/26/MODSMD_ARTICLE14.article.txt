# THIS COLUMN IS IRONIC
## "I'll See You in Another Life, Brotha!" 
### Shane Savitsky 
May 23 must be a day con
nected with loss in my life.
Just a year ago, I gathered
with a group in Yost to watch the
final episode of "Lost," arguably the
greatest television series of all time.
And it was also the day that I fin
ished writing this final edition of
"This Column Is Ironic." (You don't
get to read it for another three days,
but that's the miracles of publish
ing!) For those of you keeping
count, this is column #26 for me
the culmination of an entire aca
demic year's worth of my inane
musings and ramblings. Whether
this is your first time reading or

your twenty-sixth, I cannot thank
you enough for wasting a few min
utes of your day with my bad jokes
and Kesha references. It means
more than you know.
Mostly, I've tried to be funny.
Sometimes, I've even tried to get
real. We've gone on quite a journey
together. I started things off by pok
ing fun at Stanford events and insti
tutions. I even tried to make fun of
myself a little bit. Then, this crazy
transatlantic adventure of mine
happened, which I hope gave you
an amusing insight into the Stan
ford in Oxford program. This col
umn has been my creative outlet of
sorts while abroad, so I hope you've
enjoyed the new twist on my con
tent. Writing an academic paper is
hard enough when you know that
just your professor or TA will grade
you on it, but writing a column that
can potentially reach thousands of
really smart people forces you to at
tempt to produce something worth
while every week.
Speaking of the "Lost" finale, I
think this final column has a lot in
common with a lot of the same
themes (spoiler alert for the rest of
this column ... but really, it's been a
year). Christian Shephard would
probably say that it's meant to help
"to remember and to let go."
This whole experience at The Daily
has allowed me to create a kind of
lasting chronicle of my junior year
at Stanford. Through good times
and bad this year, I've tried to write
something that connects to my
Stanford experience. And maybe, if
I was able to do things the way I
hoped, my columns every week
somehow connected to your Stan
ford experience, too.
My apologies for being so overt
ly sentimental both this week and
last. You can blame it on being away
from the Farm, but you can also
blame it on Damon Lindelof and
Carlton Cuse. As research for this
column, I've watched the final scene
of "Lost" like five times and it al
ways makes me weepy. I'm a sap, I'll
admit. I've already admitted to lik
ing Hugh Grant movies in print, so I
don't think this could really damage

my non-existent street cred any fur
ther. While the end of "This Column
Is Ironic" might not necessarily pre
cipitate the pop culture maelstrom
that preceded the end of "Lost," if I
can succeed in making one person
tear up even out of happiness
that this column has finally ended
then I'll have done my job.
Maybe, like "Lost," I can even force
my readers to ponder the deepest
philosophic questions of life. For ex
ample, maybe the next time you get
in your car, you can ponder, "Which
seat can I take?" (You didn't think I
could finish off this column without
an already-outdated pop culture
reference, did you?)
And indeed, perhaps last week's
declaration of missing Stanford was
a bit preemptive. Maybe I should
have saved the sentimentality for
the obvious reflection that this final
column would bring. But you know
what? I think it provides a great

I've already admitted to
liking Hugh Grant
movies in print, so I don't
think this could really
damage my non-existent
street cred any further.

bridge between the two. I'll make
one final connection to "Lost"
another quote from the finale, in
fact: "The most important part of
your life was the time that you spent
with these people. That's why all of
you are here. Nobody does it alone.
You needed all of them, and they
needed you." Now, I'm not (again:
spoiler alert!) Christian Shephard

referring to some constructed after
life. Rather, I hope you can use those
words to make some connection to
your Stanford experience thus far.
Our time on our own island that
beautiful little bubble we call the
Farm is too short. Most of us have
far less than six seasons to make the
most of it. Don't let it pass you by;
otherwise, you'll find yourself
screaming,"We have to go back!"

This may be the end, but Shane isn't
going anywhere â€”for another year,
at least. Email him at savitsky@stan
