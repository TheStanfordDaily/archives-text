# Mixing drugs causes adverse blood glucose effect
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”An Le Nguyen 
A relatively common drug combi
nation the antidepressant Paxil and
the cholesterol-lowering Pravachol
may cause rises in blood glucose levels.
These findings, published Wednesday,
result from a collaboration between
investigators at the School of Medi
cine, Vanderbilt University and Har
vard Medical School.
The discovery comes as a surprise
since neither of the drugs produces the
same blood glucose effect when taken
independently. According to re
searchers, the increase is more severe

among diabetics for whom blood glu
cose control is crucial. The investiga
tors also examined pre-diabetic lab
mice examined to both drugs.
Data from the Food and Drug Ad
ministration and electronic medical
records provided the backbone for the
findings.
"These kinds of drug interactions
are almost certainly occurring all of the
time, but, because they are not part of
the approval process by the Food and
Drug Administration, we can only
learn about them after the drugs are on
the market," said bioengineering pro
fessor Russ Altman in a press release.
It is not uncommon for drugs to
produce adverse effects when used in
combination. But since drugs are test
ed and approved individually, render
ing predictions of combined effects im
possible.
Studies of mice showed the same
effect when the two medications were
used in conjunction; the mice demon
strated a spike in fasting glucose levels
when treated with Paxil and Pravachol
together for three weeks. But the im
pact isn't limited to mice.
"Between 13 and 15 million people
in this country have prescriptions for
these drugs," said Altman, who is the
study's senior author. "By extrapolat
ing from the electronic medical
records at Stanford and elsewhere, we
can predict that between 500,000 and
one million people are taking them si
multaneously."
