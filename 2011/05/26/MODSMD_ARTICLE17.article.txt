## SOLID SINGLES START Three of five Cardinal players advance to round two 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
On its first day of individual tourna
ment play, the Stanford women's tennis
team advanced three of its five players
senior Hilary Barte, freshman Nicole
Gibbs and sophomore Stacey Tan into
the second round. It was an injury-filled
day, with two of Stanford's players ham
pered by injuries and one Cardinal player
benefiting from an opponent's ailment.
Before play had even begun, the Cardi
nal had already lost one of its best players.
Freshman and 2011 Pac-10 singles cham
pion Kristie Ahn was forced to pull out
with a recurring ankle problem. She also
was on the sideline for Stanford's champi
onship matchup against Florida on Tues
day evening.

"Obviously it's frustrating because I re
ally looked forward to playing both team
and individuals," Ahn said. "There's noth
ing I can really do though so now I'm just
focusing on recovering and playing tour
naments for the summer. It was a little sad
watching some of my teammates play
today and watching again from the side
lines."

Despite Ahn missing out, Stanford still
had plenty of talent on display in the first
round of the NCAA tournament. Barte,
Gibbs, Tan and sophomore Mallory all
participated in singles play.
For Tan, the second round came easy.
Up 2-0 in the first set, her opponent de
faulted due to injury.

Gibbs proved dominant again, running
off to a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Anastasia
Putilina of Utah. Putilina was 14-8 at
Utah's No. 1 spot, with a seven-game win
streak and a 6-1 conference score.

Barte played on court one again, this
time as the third seed in the tournament.
She came up against Natalie Pluskota of
Tennessee, who was 15-10 in the regular
season for the Vols, including 7-3 in SEC
Play-

Continuing her impressive run of late,
Barte blew by Pluskota for a 6-1,6-1 victo
ry. Her movement into the net was what
separated her from her opponent, as a
powerful forehand and net-charges to get
the finishing volley catapulted Barte into
the next round.

"They were very composed, especially
after a tough loss, to come back the next
day," Ahn said. "People say the hardest
day is the day after a loss. I think they
played very composed and they did work.
They got off the court as fast as they

could."
Burdette struggled on the day
with a stomach problem as well as
last-minute changes in the draw.
Her initial opponent was meant to
be Nazari Urbina of Texas A&M,
but Urbina failed to earn a seed for
the tournament coming out of a
weaker Big-12 Conference. In
stead, Burdette was put up against
the University of North Carolina's
number one, Zoe De Bruycker. De
Bruycker earned a 9-16 seed and
came from a team ranked fourth in
the nation playing in a very compet
itive ACC league. De Bruycker is
29-16 this year, including 7-4 in
ACC play. Even so, Burdette insists
it didn't affect her game.
"I'm kind of a don't-look-at-the
draw girl," Burdette said. "I only
knew who my opponent was that
morning. When we talk about other
players, we pretty much just say
play your own game."

With her new opponent, Bur
dette went on to drop her first
round match despite dominating
the first set 6-1. Ultimately, Bur
dette would lose her second set
tiebreaker and go on to lose the
third set, ending her singles play for
the season.
"I'm definitely struggling with a
stomach pull and I was not serving
at 100 percent," Burdette said. "I
think at the beginning of the match
it didn't really affect me, because
she was struggling with my weird
soft serves. As the match went on,
she started to adjust and so my serv
ice games became much more diffi
cult.
"I just hope that I'm able to
serve 80 or 90 percent tomorrow,"
Burdette continued. "Hilary and I
are playing great doubles. I really
want this stomach thing to get bet
ter so we can get out there and com
pete."
Singles play continues at tomor
row Taube Tennis Center, followed
by the first round of doubles.
