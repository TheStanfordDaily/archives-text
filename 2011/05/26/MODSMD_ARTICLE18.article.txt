# Thacher out in first round
## Klahn cruises in straight-set victory 
### ALEX ECKERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After itching to get back on the
court since Stanford's heartbreak
ing loss to Virginia in the team quar
terfinals last weekend, No. 9-seeded
junior Bradley Klahn began his de
fense of last year's NCAA singles
title against No. 55 Jason Jung of
Michigan yesterday afternoon.
Meanwhile, his doubles counterpart
junior Ryan Thacher nearly
beat his second top-five opponent
in as many matches.
After USC defeated Virginia in a
thrilling team championship final
on Tuesday, the tournament
switched gears to individual play
a 64-player singles tournament and
a 32-team doubles tournament.
Last season, then-sophomore
Klahn surprised the field en route
to his first NCAA singles champi
onship. Now ranked No. 9 in the
country, Klahn has a target on his
back.
The day started with a three
hour rain delay, pushing all of the
matches back and threatening to
cancel all 64 of the day's scheduled
matches. Luckily, by 3 p.m., the sky
had cleared and championship ten
nis was in full swing on all seventeen
of the courts at the Taube Tennis
Center.
Klahn started slow. Coming off a
decisive 6-4, 6-2 victory over No. 5
Michael Shabaz of Virginia in the
team tourney, Klahn seemed unable
to get the upper hand on Wednes
day. When Jung broke Klahn's serve
in the seventh game of the first set
to take a 5-3 advantage, it seemed
increasingly likely that Klahn
would fall behind a set. Klahn's
frustration was apparent as he re
peatedly tried to pick it up, but Jung

Men's Singles Championships on Wednesday, but he and fellow junior

seemed to return every shot.
With his back against the wall
and down 5-3, Klahn found a sec
ond gear. He held serve, broke Jung
and then held serve again to take a
6-5 lead. Jung was able to force a
first-set tiebreak, but Klahn out
lasted the Michigan senior 7-5 in
the tiebreak to take control of the
match. Jung was clearly deflated in
the second set and Klahn con
trolled play the rest of the way,
claiming a 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory.
"Jason is a tough out," Klahn
said. "He is solid and going to make
you work. There's always those first
round jitters coming into a tourna
ment like this. I started to find my
game toward the end of the first
and start of the second, and I was
able to work my way back into the
match."
Klahn said he doesn't want to
rest on his title from last year and is
treating this year's tournament no
differently than any other year's,
taking everything one match at a
time.
"I'm trying not to think about
last year," Klahn continued. "This is
a new year and there are a lot of
good players out here. I have confi
dence in winning this tourney
knowing I have done it before, but I
just need to go out there, compete
hard and stick to my game plan. It's
nice being at home with the crowd
so hopefully that will help out a
lot."
As Klahn won the first set and
took control of his match, Thacher
had begun his own battle against
No. 4 Blaz Rola of Ohio State. On
paper, the 46th-ranked Thacher
was a heavy underdog, but the

Stanford junior was coming in with
plenty of confidence from unlikely
victory over second-ranked Alex
Domijan of Virginia in the team
play. Domijan had won the Nation
al Indoor Championships earlier in
the season and was undefeated in
dual match play before Thacher
dismantled him 6-4, 6-3 on Satur
day afternoon.
Thacher took the early lead in
yesterday's match winning the
first set 7-5 and it looked like he
would pull of his second major
upset of the tournament. However,
Rola bounced back to win the sec
ond set 6-3. Thacher threatened
again in the third, breaking Rola's
serve early to take a 3-1 lead, but
Rola responded by winning five
straight games to secure victory
5-7, 6-3. 6-3.After the match, Rola
expressed his respect for Thacher.
"I knew it was going to be a
tough match," he said. "Ryan is a re
ally good player and has done great
things at Stanford. I came in fully
prepared for today's match. We ex
changed a lot of breaks, played a
good match and had good points.
I'm really happy that I came
through."
Despite the loss in singles play,
Thacher will compete later today in
the doubles tournament alongside
Klahn. Thacher and Klahn are the
No. 3 doubles squad in the country,
but are coming off two straight loss
es in duals play.
Klahn next faces No. 17 Austin
Krajicek in a rematch of the decid
ing match between Stanford and
Texas A&M in last week's round of
16. Klahn won that match 6-4,6-3 to
put Stanford into the quarterfinals.
Klahn faces off with Krajicek at
10 a.m. today and will join Thacher
in doubles sometime after 2 p.m.
