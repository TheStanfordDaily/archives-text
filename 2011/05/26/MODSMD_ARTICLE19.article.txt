## Cardinal and Crimson Tide contend for trip to College World Series 
### â€”Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford Softball
team heads to Tuscaloosa,
Ala., this weekend to clash
with the Alabama Crimson
Tide in a best-of-three series
with a trip to the Women's
College World Series on the
line.
After sweeping its way
through the regional with vic
tories over Pacific, Fresno
State and Nebraska, Stanford
(41-15) looks to punch its
ticket to its first College
World Series since 2004.
The Cardinal will, once
again, lean heavily on junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen,
who hit .400 this past week
end, scored three runs and
drove in three RBI. She was
named one of the three final
ists for the Amateur Softball
Association of America's Na
tional Player of the Year
award on Wednesday.
Hansen leads the nation in
doubles per game (0.45),
ranks second in batting aver
age (.500) and eighth in on
base percentage (.562).
Hansen leads the Pac-10 in
batting average, on-base per
centage, hits and doubles. She
is the first Cardinal player
ever to be named one of the
three finalists for the award.
Stanford also got solid
weekends in the regional from
sophomore Jenna Rich, who
had four of the team's nine
RBI, and sophomore pitcher
Teagan Gerhart, who shut
down the opposing offenses
all weekend while posting a
0.67 ERA and going 3-0.
The No. 2 seed Crimson
Tide (49-8) pounded its way
through the Tuscaloosa Regional,
dominating Jackson State, Mem
phis and Chattanooga with 8-0,7-1
and 11-2 victories.
The win was the seventh
straight regional victory for the
Tide. The program has advanced
to the College World Series four
times in the last six years.
Senior Whitney Larsen leads Al
abama offensively, as she batted
.700 with four runs, a double, triple
and nine RBI in the NCAA Re
gional. The Tide also impresses on
the mound, as freshman pitcher
Jackie Traina pitched a no-hitter
against Jackson State in the first
game of the regional, allowing just
one runner to reach base on an in
field error.
The Cardinal and Crimson Tide
play the first game of a best-of
three series Thursday at 5 p.m.
PST in Tuscaloosa.
