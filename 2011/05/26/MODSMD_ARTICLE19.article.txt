### â€”Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford Softball

Ala., this weekend to clash
with the Alabama Crimson
Tide in a best-of-three series
with a trip to the Women's
College World Series on the
line.
After sweeping its way
through the regional with vic
tories over Pacific, Fresno
State and Nebraska, Stanford
(41-15) looks to punch its
ticket to its first College
World Series since 2004.
The Cardinal will, once
again, lean heavily on junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen,
who hit .400 this past week
end, scored three runs and
drove in three RBI. She was
named one of the three final
ists for the Amateur Softball
Association of America's Na
tional Player of the Year
award on Wednesday.
Hansen leads the nation in
doubles per game (0.45),
ranks second in batting aver
age (.500) and eighth in on
base percentage (.562).
Hansen leads the Pac-10 in
batting average, on-base per
centage, hits and doubles. She
is the first Cardinal player
ever to be named one of the
three finalists for the award.
Stanford also got solid
weekends in the regional from
sophomore Jenna Rich, who
had four of the team's nine
RBI, and sophomore pitcher
Teagan Gerhart, who shut
down the opposing offenses
all weekend while posting a
0.67 ERA and going 3-0.
