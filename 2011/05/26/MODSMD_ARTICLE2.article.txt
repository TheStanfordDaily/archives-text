## Social media moves to academia Conference examines role of social media, business globalization 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) hosted a
conference on social media and the globalization
of business on Wednesday. The conference fea
tured two main presentations on social media
and the workplace, which focused on trends in
using social media platforms (SMPs) for various
business functions.
The Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Cen
ter (APARC) and the Stanford Program on Re
gions of Innovation and Entrepreneurship
(SPRIE) co-hosted the event.
"Social media is such a new field that compa
nies are really confused about where it's going ..
. they don't have a clear idea of return on invest
ment, they don't understand which SMP to use
for which kind of corporate activity," said Rafiq
Dossani, APARC senior research scholar, in an
interview with The Daily.
But experts are starting to detangle the com
plexities of social media.
Philip and Stephen Jordan of Green LMI Con
sulting, a strategic consulting firm presented their
paper on "Social Media Trends with Silicon Val
ley employers," studying how social media is used
for professional development and recruitment in
the Valley.
Their research found that 52 percent of firms
"use social media for ... finding and recruiting

new candidates." Despite the buzz around social
media the writers emphasized that "core skills"
are still the most essential element in a resume
and social media tools should only be used to
augment these skills.
Following brief presentations by Tuomo
Nikulainen, a researcher at ETLA, the Research
Institute of the Finnish Economy, and Rahim
Fazal, CEO and co-founder of Involver, an SMP,
Dossani presented his paper on "Social Media in
the Workplace,"
Dossani's research examined corporate social
media policy and practices. Dossani set two con
ditions to decide the value of an SMP to a busi
ness organization namely, whether it im
proves the reliability of existing information or
enables the generation of new information. His
research found that SMPs were more valuable
for interaction between people with weaker ties
to each other.
Using a small sample of firms, Dossani found
marked differences between corporate use of in
ternal and external SMPs. In fact, 45 percent of all
firms use internal SMPs, or social media for re
cruitment within the firm. Additionally, 90 per
cent of all firms use external SMPs for recruit
ment and marketing and business development.
Social media platform Tinkedln, a profes
sional networking website came up as preferred
for recruitment, and Wiki "came out as the star
across all possible uses," Dossani said.
In response to Dossani's presentation,
APARC Director-emeritus Henry Rowen noted
the study's lack of citations, which indicates the
