# An ode to Mariano Rivera
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
I hate the Yankees. I should just
start by getting that out of the
way. If you've read any of my
columns over the past couple
years, I've probably made a
reference to how evil they are in al
most every one. Which is what makes
this column that much more ridicu
lous. I can't believe I'm doing it, but
I'm going to talk about how great one
of the Yankees is.
Why? Because Mariano Rivera is
really, really, really good, and if even I
can admit it, I can't see who would dis
agree.
Rivera just pitched in his I,oooth
game for the Yankees. That's right,
there are three zeros in that number.
That's the equivalent of pitching in
every game for over six full seasons,
which is almost unheard of In fact,
pitching in 1,000 games for one team
was unheard of until Rivera notched a
scoreless ninth inning yesterday. And
that's not even counting another 100
games of postseason and All-Star
Games.
Longevity is great and all, but what
makes the 41-year-old Rivera special
is how successful he's been over that
span. His 572 saves are second all
time, but even that number doesn't
tell the whole story. His career ERA
of 2.22 and WHIP of 1.00 would both
be considered exceptional for a single
season, but as career numbers they
are mindboggling. Excluding his
rookie season, he's allowed one home
run every 21.65 innings.
Consider a guy like Sandy Koufax,
known as one of the best pitchers in
history. He played in an era where
pitchers dominated overall, which
made the league lower the mound
and shrink the strike zone after Ko
ufax retired. Even so, Koufax's career
ERA is over half a run higher than
Rivera's, his WHIP is higher, his
strikeout-to-walk ratio is substantially
worse and he gave up home runs
roughly twice as often. Yep, one of the
best pitchers ever playing in an era
where the rules and the game favored
the pitcher still gave up more gopher
balls than Rivera did to all those
juicers.
And it's not just Koufax. Look at
any of the all-time greats. Cy Young
himself can't compare to Rivera in
any of these categories except home
runs, but home runs had hardly been
invented yet in the pre-Ruth era.
Since then, even the best pitchers
Warren Spahn, Greg Maddux, Randy
Johnson, you name it can't match
Rivera in any of these categories.
Stats not enough for you? How
about clutch situations? Rivera pitch
es the most important inning in base
ball, the ninth, better than anyone in
history. How about the playoffs?
Rivera's playoff ERA of 0.71 is the
best in history. His K/BB ratio is over
five, his WHIP is under 0.8 and he's
given up just two home runs in 139.2
postseason innings. And his 42 playoff
saves are the most in history.
Yeah, but he's getting old, right?
As a lifetime Yankee hater, my answer
is "if only." Since 2006, his ERA and
WHIP are even lower, 1.98 and .90, re
spectively. In that span, he's allowed
only one run in 28 postseason innings.
If you've watched Rivera at any
point over the last 15 years, you're
probably screaming one thing right
about now: 'And he only throws one
pitch!"
That cutter, which might as well be
named after Rivera at this point, has
got to be the best pitch in baseball his
tory. For the past decade and a half,
Rivera has thrown this one pitch over
90 percent of the time, and it still baf
fles hitters. It's not that fast (low-90s),
it doesn't have that much movement,
but the timing of the movement and
the location are just good enough that
the best players in baseball haven't
been able to figure him out. Even for
someone that's rooted against him
during every one of his 17 Major
League seasons, there's something in
credibly impressive about a guy that
can walk to the mound a thousand
times and tell the hitter exactly what
he's going to see and still be able to get
him out.
With this resume behind him,
Rivera is clearly a Hall of Famer.That
much is not in doubt. He's now made
a fairly irrefutable case as the best re
liever of all time as well.
Frankly, I don't think that's strong
enough. The Yankees have been, as

hard as it is for me to say, the class of
the Major Leagues for the period of
time Rivera has been there. More
than anyone other person more
than Joe Torre, George Steinbrenner
and definitely more than Derek Jeter
(don't get me started), Rivera has
been responsible for the Yankees'
modern dynasty.
At this point, Yankee fans and
Yankee haters alike have to come to
terms with the fact that Mariano
Rivera is one of the best pitchers in
baseball history. Period.
I'll leave you with one final statis
tic, and like many in baseball, it re
quires some explaining. Because
players from different eras are so

hard to compare, baseball stat freaks
have found away to control for era
and ballpark, and the result is a statis
tic called ERA+. For ERA+, higher
numbers are better than lower num
bers, and the average is set at 100. The
second-best ERA+ in history is Pedro
Martinez's 154. In total, 767 players
have an ERA+ between 100 and 154.
Rivera? 205.
I will always hate the Yankees and
I think everyone else should, too. But
when your team is losing to the Evil
Empire in the ninth inning, don't turn
off the television in frustration. Yes,
your team will lose, but at least you
can watch one of the best pitchers in
baseball history.

Jacob Jaffe disregards the fact that
"Moneyball" says it's statistically
much easier to be a closer than a
starter. Discuss the differences with
