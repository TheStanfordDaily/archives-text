# Stanford weighs in on speed rail
## Trains draw criticism, praise 
### MATT BETTONVILLE STAFF WRITER 
The California high-speed rail project
has been a hotly contested issue at the
state level since voters passed the nearly
$lO billion California Proposition 1A in
2008. As the California High Speed Rail
Authority (CHSRA) moves closer to be
ginning construction on the project, mem
bers of the Stanford community, students
and experts alike, are weighing in on the
prospects and perils the high-speed rail
could face.
The rail line, if constructed, will shuttle
riders from downtown San Francisco to
the Los Angeles/Anaheim area in two
hours and 40 minutes, taking a route
through California's Central Valley. Fu
ture plans aim to expand the line, allowing
it run from Sacramento to San Diego.
High-speed rail has had great success in

Europe, but no lines yet exist in the Unit
ed States.
Funding for the project has trickled in
slowly and is being matched by the state
of California. According to CHSRA
media contact Rachel Wall, the rail au
thority received $3.5 billion in federal
funds, which will enable the construction
of a segment of rail in the Central Valley.
Following the government's invest
ment in infrastructure, currently under
way with the CHSRA, the line will be li
censed to a private operator who will be
required to run trains at profit. Wall said
there is significant demand from various
parties to run the line,
"The high-speed rail industry and sup
pliers and operators have been literally
knocking on our doors weekly to stay ap
prised of what is the United States' only
true high-speed rail system," she
said.
The plan to begin in the Central
Valley has met several criticisms,
most prominently the idea that the
state is building a rail to nowhere.
The first rail line will cover a 150-
mile segment from Merced, Calif.,
to Bakersfield, Calif., with the ob
jective of targeting riders in the
Madera and Fresno areas along the
way.
Graduate School of Business
professor Alain Enthoven co-au
thored a study titled "The Financial
Risks of California's Fligh-Speed
Rail Project," which points to mis
calculations in the CHSRA plan,
including incorrectly estimated in
frastructure cost and rider de
mand.
"Both our state and federal gov
ernments are suffering from dan
gerously large and intractable
deficits, and we shouldn't be look
ing for new ways to spend money
unless they are clearly good invest
ments. CFISR is a loser," Enthoven
wrote in email to The Daily.
Another key concern is what
would happen if rail revenue can
not meet costs. Many critics fear
that the state will end up subsidiz
ing the train, a measure forbidden
by Prop IA. Citing experts from
Amtrak and around the world, En
thoven's study concludes, "the pro
posed project cannot financially
function without a legally forbid
den operating subsidy."
Still, CHSRA insists that the
law will be upheld.
"The bond measure authorized
$9 billion for high-speed rail infra
structure construction in Califor
nia," Wall said. "That is it. That is
the only state money that is going
to go toward this project."
Other supporters insist that
precedent indicates the demand
will be there, Fligh-speed rail pro
ponent Daniel Jacobson 'l2, along
with CHSRA, pointed to Euro
pean high-speed trains as support
ing evidence. The populations
there depend on rails like the AVE
line from Madrid to Barcelona,

which is similar to the one from San
Francisco to Los Angeles.
Before Prop IA, the state gov
ernment conducted feasibility
studies to determine whether the
high-speed rail was the best option
to alleviate growing population
transportation demand. Many sup
porters of the project agree with
the state's decision that high-speed
rail is a more economic option than
building additional freeways and
airports.
"When you look at the econom
ic future of the state, I don't think
there's a project that's more cru
cial," Jacobson said.
He noted that the economic
stimulus from the project's con
struction, transportation and job
creation made the project a must
for the state. He also pointed to the
minimized environmental impact
of trains relative to cars or planes.
CHSRA hopes to reduce depend
ence on roads and airways as well.
"We do anticipate making it an
enticing, competitive option to pull
cars off the freeways," Wall said.
She added that "California has
hundreds if not thousands of flights
every day" from Northern Califor
nia to Southern California.
Enthoven, however, saw the
project as a poor way to invest in
the state's future.
"It is being and will be paid for
by cuts in support for education,"
he said. "As to which is more im
portant for our future, there is no
contest, not even close.
"Maybe in the 1960s we could
afford a moon shot, but not now
with health care over 17 percent of
the GDP and growing," he added.
Jacobson, on the other hand, in
sisted that the state needs trans
portation infrastructure and can
not wait much longer.
"Yes, it's tough to fund some
thing that big right now, but the
cost of doing nothing is not zero,"
he said. "To expand highways and
airports to handle the same capaci
ty when California hits 60 million
people by 2050 is going to be two,
three, four times the cost."
Construction is set to begin on
the Central Valley line in Septem
ber 2012.
