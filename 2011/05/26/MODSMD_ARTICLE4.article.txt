## U.S. tech chief enlightens Farm's students and staff 
### SARAH FLAMM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Aneesh Chopra, the U.S. Chief Tech
nology Officer (CTO), gave an overview
of the government's efforts to encourage
entrepreneurship yesterday. His talk was
the last session of the DFJ Entrepreneur
ial Thought Leaders Seminar Series.
Chopra reports directly to President
Barack Obama and is responsible for ad
vancing "the president's technology agen
da by fostering new ideas and encouraging
government-wide coordination," accord
ing to the White House website.
"If I am successful, I will convince you

that there has never been a better time to
be an innovator," Chopra said to an audi
ence of Stanford students, professors, en
trepreneurs and community members.
Chopra described three sectors that are
ripe for technological innovation and in
vestment: healthcare, education and clean
energy.
"Can you imagine being a billionaire
and solving the healthcare system at the
same time?" Chopra said.
He continued to describe the "huge po
tential for entrepreneurship" in health
care, such as digitizing the system and
moving hospitals and doctors from
paper to record-based systems.
Chopra also pointed to new market
opportunities that will result from
shifting the payment system from
one that focuses on volume to one
that focuses on value.
On the education front, Chopra
described a need to move from
print to digital learning. For exam
ple, he spoke about the develop
ment of digital tutors, a machine
learning system that determines
student's needs and then presents
materials in away that best match
es individual's level and learning
style.
The third field Chopra men
tioned was clean energy, which
shows great potential for invest
ment. He touched upon the need to
modernize the smart grid and im
prove energy efficiency through
better monitoring systems.

The government plays an impor
tant role in encouraging innovation
in these fields, Chopra said. He
highlighted a range of initiatives
that the Obama administration has
undertaken, such as investing in
wireless connectivity and human
capital, as well as shaping good
market conditions for innovation
through cyber policy, patents and
regulatory barriers reductions.
He also mentioned Obama's
Open Government Directive, which
makes data universally available to
the public through websites like
data.gov. Chopra said that making
more data public and available for
entrepreneurs to explore would fuel
new products and services.
"I appreciated hearing about ef
forts to make data more accessible
to the public and the opportunities
that arise when given access to
data," said Pat Kuehnle 'll, who in
terned at the Department of Edu
cation right after the Open Govern
ment initiative was launched.
Chopra also underscored the
need to fix the current broken im
migration system in order to retain

the "best and brightest innovators."
Chopra, who was born in Trenton,
New Jersey, and is a second-genera
tion immigrant from India, said this
issue deeply resonates with him. He
mentioned that a comprehensive
immigration overhaul could in
clude granting green cards to doc
toral and master's students upon
graduation or issuing "startup
visas" to entrepreneurs.
According to Chopra, the equiv
alent of bottom-up change as ap
plied to the technology sector is en
trepreneurship. By tapping into
places like the Silicon Valley, one
can overcome the political stale
mate in Washington and bring
change.
Chopra's visit served not only to
inform people about government
initiatives that build infrastructure
that supports entrepreneurs, but
also to encourage entrepreneurs to
serve their country by entering
healthcare, education and clean
technology sectors.
