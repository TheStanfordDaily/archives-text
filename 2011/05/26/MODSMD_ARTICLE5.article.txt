## Scholars delve into mental states 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€”An Le Nguyen 
Researchers at the School of Medicine are one step
closer to unlocking the secrets of the brain. Michael
Greicius, assistant professor of neurology, and his col
leagues say that mental states can be identified using
patterns of activity in the human brain's coordinated
"networks."
Their findings, published today in Cerebral Cortex,
may advance the effort to create diagnostic tests for var
ious brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Gre
icius and his team used brain-imaging data to figure out
which of four mental states their subjects were engaged
in remembering events of the day, doing mental
math, relaxing or singing silently to themselves.
Unlike other studies that use time-controlled tech
niques, the Stanford study allowed experimental sub
jects to carry out the mental activities at their own nat
ural pace. This new method is the standard fMRI proce
dure with a twist and enables researchers to understand
what the human brain does in free-flowing mental
states.
"With standard fMRI, you need to know just when
your subjects start focusing on a mental task and just
when they stop," Greicius said in a press release. "But
that isn't how real people in the day-to-day world
think."
Using fMRI scans from 14 men and women, Gre
icius' team concentrated on networks of brain regions
that activate together during a given mental state. The
team made maps of coordinated brain activity for each
state, examining 90 brain regions that constituted most
of the brain's gray matter.
With this mental mapping complete, the researchers
attempted to identify which among the four mental
tasks subjects were performing and correctly predicted
them with 80-percent accuracy.
The Stanford investigators hope that this advance
will be helpful in determining cognitive disorders. Gre
icius and hrs peers previously demonstrated that differ
ent disorders show up on fMRI scans with deficiencies
specific to different brain networks.
