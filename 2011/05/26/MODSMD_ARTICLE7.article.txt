## Police, leaders rethink safety after shooting Blackfest organizers stress need for additional measures 
### MIKE WHEET 
In response to the shooting that
occurred in the Lagunita parking
lot on the evening of Saturday, May
14, campus police and student lead
ers are considering changes to secu
rity measures at large events.
The incident happened across
the street from Roble Field, where
Blackfest had ended approximate
ly 30 minutes earlier. According to
some witnesses at the shooting, an
argument broke out and multiple
shots were subsequently fired at
the ground.
Student leaders involved with
Blackfest anticipate that the inci
dent will lead to increased security
in future years.
The most recent Blackfest was
much more crowded than expect
ed. In 2010, approximately 700 peo
ple attended. This year, Blackfest
artists Big Sean and Travis Porter
rapidly gained popularity and drew
a larger crowd, which included a
sizable number of students from
other universities and community
members unaffiliated with Stan
ford.
Blackfest co-chair Lexi Butler
'll said her group "organized the
event based on last year's atten
dance."
"No one knew it was going to
get that big," she added, referring
to this year's estimated 4,000 atten
dees.
While planning this year's event,
Blackfest organizers requested
enough security for a 1,000-person
crowd. Butler claimed additional
security might not have prevented
the incident and stressed that other
measures are needed to keep future
events safe.
"I think heads of the University,
security and students who plan big
events now realize that 'Hey, peo
ple will come to our campus.' We
need to think about how to protect
it," Bulter said.
Following the incident, the
Stanford Concert Network (SCN)
is reconsidering how it will work
with other student groups in the fu
ture. SCN provided $3,000 in fund
ing and technical support for
Blackfest, but was not involved in
organizing the event's security.
"[The shooting] might affect
how we run things on our end," said
Alberto Aroeste 'l3, financial man
ager for SCN. "We don't want to be
outsourcing our work. We work
very closely with the deputies."
Aroeste could not comment on
the concert network's involvement
in next year's Blackfest as the SCN
board had not discussed it yet.
The Stanford University De

partment of Public Safety
(SUDPS) is continuing to actively
investigate the case. After the
shooting, SUDPS officers detained
and questioned two suspects who
attempted to flee the scene. The po
lice released the suspects because
there was not sufficient evidence to
make an arrest.
Officers also found a handgun
near the area where the suspects
were apprehended. Detectives in
vestigated the registered owner of
the handgun and whether the
owner could legally possess a
firearm. To date, both questions re
main unanswered and charges
have not been made.
"Nothing has been brought to
the D.A. at this time, the detectives
are still doing fact-finding," said
Sergeant Chris Cohendet.
He added that SUDPS hopes
that charges can be brought for
ward soon.
Cohendet also acknowledged
that large events will require
greater security in future.
"We have to look at these
events in a new way," he said.
"Someone could've seriously been
hurt or killed."
Blackfest organizers and police
say that the shooting, combined
with other security incidents this
past year, should remind everyone
of campus's vulnerability.
"This year, our safe little bubble
has been shaken," Butler said.
"The Stanford community is a
very safe community, but it's not in
vincible to outsiders," Cohendet
said. "Students and community
members need to be aware of their
surroundings."
