## INNOVENTIONS How the university brings inventions to the market 
### ZAHRA TAJI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University news reports seem con
stantly flooded with research
findings and inventions devel
oped year round. In fact, accord
ing to the Association of Ameri
can Universities, universities brought on av
erage more than one new product to market
every day between 1998 and 2006. But while
the product is usually described with vivid de
tail, the behind-the-scenes process that makes
these new inventions official is rarely ex
plored.
Professors like James S. Harris, professor
of electrical engineering, who have issued
nearly 30 patents and have even more pend
ing, are no strangers to Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing (OTL), which manages
the University's intellectual property.
For example, when Harris founded Solar
Junction, a company he developed with his
lab that manufactures super high-efficiency
solar cells, he worked closely with the OTL to
protect the product of his lab's innovation.
Just last month, it broke the world record with
its solar cell efficiency of 43.5 percent.
As stated on its website, the OTL's mission
is to "promote the transfer of Stanford tech
nology for society's use and benefit while gen
erating unrestricted income to support re
search and education."
The implication of Stanford's patent poli
cy is that any patentable invention imple
mented "in whole or in part by members of
the faculty or staff of the University" will have
to be licensed through the OTL. This holds
true for research supported by any funding
source University or otherwise.
Whenever a student, faculty or staff devel
ops an invention, they must submit a disclo
sure form to OTL, who will evaluate whether

the product should be licensed to the industry.
If the product is licensed, an administra
tive fee is paid to the OTL before profit is di
vided into thirds between the inventor, the in
ventor's department and the University. But
if the product is not licensed, the OTL releas
es the inventor from the University's patent
policy, which gives the inventor freedom to
try to patent the invention on his or her own.
"As part of our charter [we] try and make
our research publicly accessible [so] that it
does something for society," Harris said. "It's
important to have exclusive licensing and to
do it in a right way. And I think the OTL has
found a good way to do that, and I think very
few other institutions have done so."
Harris stressed the importance of granting
exclusive licenses.
"You can imagine if Google didn't have an
exclusive license as things were starting to

look attractive, Microsoft, with
about 100,000 times the resources
to a startup company, could just
come in, license the patent and just
destroy them," Harris said.
Dean of Research Ann Arvin
described the important role the
OTL and its counterparts at other
universities play in translating ideas
into something with tangible public
benefit.
"We want faculty and students
to be engaged in inventing things,
and that's part of the way in which
ideas become products and useful
for the public good," Arvin said.
To Harris, licensing inventions is
a critical step to attracting investors
who are willing to support the
idea's development. Investors
often have less interest in publicly
owned patents, which makes the
OTL critical to researchers on cam
pus.
Shan Wang, professor of materi
al science and engineering and elec
trical engineering, licensed an in
vention he produced with his lab to
the startup Mag Array.
Mag Array was created in 2005
by Wang and Robert White, profes
sor of electrical engineering, to im
prove molecular diagnostics. The
startup uses nanotechnology to re
fine methods for diagnosing com
plex diseases such as cancer.
Despite the many intricacies of
the licensing process, Wang said the
patent process would be "much
more difficult... and complicat
ed" to navigate without OTL.
Jeffrey Schox, consulting associ
ate professor and founding mem
ber of Schox Patent Group, also de
scribed the licensing process as ex
tensively nuanced. According to

Schox, there are three pillars for
dealing with patent rights: scientific
understanding of the technology,
legal understanding of intellectual
property and, of course, business
consultation.
He said that there is often ten
sion between the inventor's ten
dency to downplay the potential of
his invention and the OTL's inter
est in showcasing its commerciality.
After all, Schox said the OTL "does
not want to get this wrong" and
"miss the next Google."
Another obstacle can be the am
biguity of a product's ownership. In
many cases, it may be unclear
whether the product belongs to
Stanford or to the inventor.
"This confusion could restrain
the inventions here on campus and
it could also restrain the funding of
those startups," Schox said, adding
that the inventor's uncertainty can
be a deterrent and make investing
seem less attractive.
For example, in Stanford v.
Roche, an intellectual property
case that recently reached the U.S.
Supreme Court, the University
challenged professor of medicine
Mark Holodniy's right to give the
rights of his patent for a method of
HIV detection to Roche, a biotech
company not affiliated with the
University.
Yet, despite the potential ambi
guities that have arisen and contin
ue to plague the licensing process,
director of OTL Katharine Ku em
phasized that Stanford's policy is
"very similar to most universities'
policies."
Despite this, the OTL and other
licensing centers are key to making
projects like Harris' super-efficient
solar cells a reality and to changing
the way people live today and in the
future.
