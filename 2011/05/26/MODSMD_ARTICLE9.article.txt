## INNOVENTIONS How the university brings inventions to the market 
### ZAHRA TAJI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University news reports seem con
stantly flooded with research
findings and inventions devel
oped year round. In fact, accord
ing to the Association of Ameri
can Universities, universities brought on av
erage more than one new product to market
every day between 1998 and 2006. But while
the product is usually described with vivid de
tail, the behind-the-scenes process that makes
these new inventions official is rarely ex
plored.
Professors like James S. Harris, professor
of electrical engineering, who have issued
nearly 30 patents and have even more pend
ing, are no strangers to Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing (OTL), which manages
the University's intellectual property.
For example, when Harris founded Solar
Junction, a company he developed with his
lab that manufactures super high-efficiency
solar cells, he worked closely with the OTL to
protect the product of his lab's innovation.
Just last month, it broke the world record with
its solar cell efficiency of 43.5 percent.
As stated on its website, the OTL's mission
is to "promote the transfer of Stanford tech
nology for society's use and benefit while gen
erating unrestricted income to support re
search and education."
The implication of Stanford's patent poli
cy is that any patentable invention imple
mented "in whole or in part by members of
the faculty or staff of the University" will have
to be licensed through the OTL. This holds
true for research supported by any funding
source University or otherwise.
Whenever a student, faculty or staff devel
ops an invention, they must submit a disclo
sure form to OTL, who will evaluate whether

the product should be licensed to the industry.
If the product is licensed, an administra
tive fee is paid to the OTL before profit is di
vided into thirds between the inventor, the in
ventor's department and the University. But
if the product is not licensed, the OTL releas
es the inventor from the University's patent
policy, which gives the inventor freedom to
try to patent the invention on his or her own.
"As part of our charter [we] try and make
our research publicly accessible [so] that it
does something for society," Harris said. "It's
important to have exclusive licensing and to
do it in a right way. And I think the OTL has
found a good way to do that, and I think very
few other institutions have done so."
Harris stressed the importance of granting
exclusive licenses.
"You can imagine if Google didn't have an
exclusive license as things were starting to
