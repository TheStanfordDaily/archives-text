APR = Annual Percentage Rate. Auto Loan Program: The rate is based on applicant's credit profile, model year of vehicle and term of
the loan, payment method and collateral as applicable. 3.74% Annual Percentage Rate (0.010247 daily periodic rate) is a fixed rate and
reflects a discount of 0.50% APR (0.001370 daily periodic rate) for a monthly recurring direct deposit of at least $5OO to yourSFCU
checking account, 0.25% APR (0.000685 daily periodic rate) for automatic transfer of payment using ACH, and 0.25% APR (0.000685
daily periodic rate) for service program discount (i.e. MAP Auto Finder, Drive Green or Premier Checking discount). Maximum rate
discount is 1.00%. Maximum term of loan is 72 months and maximum loan amount is $25,000. Graduates may be eligible for current
rate and discounts based on qualifications. You must agree to the terms and conditions of this program. Should you decide not to
continue to maintain the service which qualifies you for a special loan rate, or if you are in default on any loan you have with us, we
may, at our option, change the rate charged on all loans pursuant to the loan agreement to the greater of the non-reduced rate in
effect when the loan was made or the non-reduced rate in effect on the date the qualifier service for each loan was terminated. When
the rate increases in this fashion, it has the effect of increasing the number of payments required to pay the balance in full. Applicants
must have proof of income and proof of graduation (signed job letter is acceptable). Graduating Student Auto Loan offers expire
June 30,2011. Auto loans must fund by July 10,2011. Offer not available on existing SFCU auto loans. All loans are subject to credit
