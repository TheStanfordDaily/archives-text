## Innovative Student Government 
### 
Current Vision
Stanford 2.0 ran on a platform of
"Student government as social en
trepreneurship." The aim is to com
bine an experienced understanding
of the current infrastructure with
ways to create disruptive change
within student government, using
the design process as a key ingredi
ent. With the intention to run stu
dent government and the ASSU
with the attitude of a lean startup,
constantly innovating, prototyping
and iterating, the Executive aims to
get things done.
In an organization where institu
tional memory is a constant issue,
the ASSU is pretty lucky to have
Michael Cruz on board. Michael
served as an executive fellow, then
on the Senate twice (once as chair)
and then finally as vice president
after stepping in to fill the huge void
left by the departure of Kelsei
Wharton. The combination of his
experience with the vision, charisma
and understanding of service that
the new chief of staff, Emma
Ogiemwanye, brings to the team,
will only take the ASSU to the next
level.
Structure
As part of the movement to cre
ate a more innovative, collaborative
and agile student government, the
ASSU Executive has a bold new
structure. In an unprecedented
move, the Executive Cabinet has
been split into two distinct compo
nents, the Cabinet and Community
Board. Moreover, to ensure effec
tive management, part of the Cabi
net will now be overseen by the
chief of staff and the other part by
the vice president. The Executive
now includes a Project Management
and Implementation "swing team"
that is delocalized, serves the entire
Cabinet and is flexible in size to en
sure the transfer of ideas. For the

first time the Cabinet structure also
involves director positions such as
the director of design thinking and
the director of need finding to aug
ment the work of the cabinet mem
bers.
Talent and Resources
Tapping talent on campus is one
of the key foci of the Executive.
Aside from learning from experi
enced University administrators, the
ASSU is already reaching out to
people around Stanford and has had
productive discussions with people
at the d.school, GSB, STVP and var
ious other talent houses. When re
cruiting the Executive team, the
ASSU reached out to the top 100
headhunters in the world; this trend
of reaching out to and learning from
the best will continue this year.
Design
The ASSU Executive is excited
to embrace the design process, with
its focus on human values, to gear
the ASSU toward ensuring empathy
for the student body for which it is
designing solutions. Before rolling
out a massive project or initiative,
the ASSU will carry out intensive
need finding using the d.school's in
terview strategies among the stu
dent population to ensure that it is
meeting relevant pain points in the
student body. Additionally, the Ex
ecutive wants to be able to rapidly
prototype and get feedback on the
projects it launches, be they health
campaigns, sustainability initiatives
or other programs to build stronger
campus community groups.
Meeting and training
Members of the ASSU are being
trained to master the processes of em
pathy interviewing, defining problem
statements, ideating by brainstorming
without judgment, using idea selec
tion processes, rapidly prototyping
with a bias to action and effectively
getting user feedback. In order to cre
ate efficient ASSU operations while
still maintaining a rich diversity of
ideas, meetings in the ASSU will be
held in a collaborative fashion, repli
cating the format that is used in the
d.school, with whiteboards, sticky
notes and a volume of great ideas
dominating the discussion rather than
egos and restrictive attitudes.
Looking ahead
As the Executive merges the
ideas gathered in its comprehen

sive platform with the unbeliev
able talent it has attracted, you'll
see more innovation and design
thinking at every step of the way.
Each Cabinet member will form a
blueprint for the year and start
building a team to think bigger
than ever before. With the wide
spread changes, the ASSU is
poised to lead innovation in stu
dent government across the na
tion. Most importantly, the focus is
on getting a lot done.
Each person who has joined the
ASSU Executive so far is a rockstar.
If you want to leverage your skills
and passions, take Stanford to the
next level and change the way stu
dent government is run, come join
the rock show.
