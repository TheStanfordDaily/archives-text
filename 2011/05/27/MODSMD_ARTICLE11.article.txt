## Researchers turn human skin cells into neurons without stem cells 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
With the addition of four proteins,
adult human skin cells can be trans
formed into neurons over a month
long period. The findings, reported
yesterday in Nature, suggest a
process that doesn't require the re
programmed adult somatic cells
called induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells.
The method may make it easier to
produce patient- or disease-specific
neurons for study.
"We are now much closer to being
able to mimic brain or neurological
diseases in the laboratory," said
School of Medicine assistant profes
sor and lead researcher Marius
Wernig in a press release.
He expressed hope that one day
the cells could be used for human
therapies.
The researchers showed they
could convert human embryonic
stem cells to neurons by infecting
them with a virus that expressed the
same proteins used in the study. This
treatment, nicknamed "BAM" after

an acronym of the three proteins,
converted the embryonic stem cells
into functional neurons within six
days. The same treatment worked on
iPS cells, but the process is labor-in
tensive and relies on cell lines that
likely aren't as diverse as a natural
population.
The challenge was to do the same
for skin cells without stem cells as an
intermediary. The researchers found

that BAM treatment to skin cells
from fetuses and newborns didn't
have the same effect as it did on the
stem cells. The addition of a fourth
protein,called "NeuroD,"was the tip
ping point; it triggered the skin cells'
transformation into functional neu
rons within about four to five weeks.
The cells expressed electrical activity
characteristic of neurons and even in
tegrated and interacted with mouse
neurons on a laboratory dish.
In 2010, the same research group
showed that a similar method
worked on mouse skin cells, although
it works much less efficiently with
human cells. While they found that
approximately 20 percent of mouse
skin cells transform directly into
functional neurons, under current
culture conditions only about two to
four percent of human skin cells do
the same.
