## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
The Global Climate and Energy
Project (GCEP) has revised the con
tract with its corporate sponsors to
allow for more sources of funding to
the researchers it supports. The most
significant change is that the contract
lets GCEP co-fund research projects
with the government.
The agreement "enhances our
ability to fund high-risk, high-re
wards research efforts that could

have a tremendous impact in the en
ergy arena," said GCEP Director
Sally Benson in an interview with the
Stanford Report.
The nine-year-old program a
collaboration between Stanford and
industry scientists sponsored by
Exxon Mobil, GE, Schlumberger and
Toyota has so far supported 80 re
search programs with more than $lOO
million. Its mission is to support pre
commercial research on energy tech
nologies that ultimately lead to
greenhouse gas reductions.
Most recently, it announced near
ly $4 million in grants to Stanford fac
ulty researching solar technology,
carbon storage and biomass energy.
"We are confident that the added
flexibility of the updated GCEP
agreement, along with these new in
novative solar, carbon storage and
biomass efforts, will continue to keep
GCEP at the cutting edge of energy
research," GCEP management com
mittee chair Gary Leonard said to
Stanford Report.
