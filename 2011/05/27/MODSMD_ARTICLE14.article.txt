# STUDENT LIFE
## Foreign occupation begins at Daily, eh? 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN 
Kathleen Chaykowski 'l3
emerged from the deep snows of
some mountain in Canada, waving
the Maple Leaf flag in glowing
pride before The Stanford Daily
building. Chaykowski was deemed
the dark horse in the campaign for
editor in chief until she prevailed
early this morning.
When asked to comment on her
triumph, she paused in thought and
hm'ed.
"I am very pleased with the re
sults," Chaykowski said, after two
minutes of silent contemplation.
"It's really great, eh."

Oh, Canada

Chaykowski, who originally
hails from Ontario, has been lauded
for her exotic Canadian roots.
"The only person I know from
Canadia [sic] is Kathleen," said
news desk editor Billy Gallagher
'l4.

"Kathleen captivated my atten
tion with so many compelling sto
ries about Canadian bacon and
maple trees," concurred Ivy Nguyen
'l3, a news desk editor. "She told me
about the country's tumultuous
past, like the time when the Quebe
cois attempted to secede, presum
ably because they were tired of
being Canadian."
Chaykowski currently lists her
place of residence as California on
Facebook.

Her dreams, however, may in
spire a whirlwind tour of the world.
Chaykowski aims to pursue an illus
trious career in journalism and will
complete an internship at The Mail
& Guardian in South Africa this
summer. For the time being, the
only obstacle standing in the way of
her rise to stardom is the celebrated
relationship between journalism
and hard liquor.
"I have no doubt that Kathleen
can tackle the biggest issues on
campus ROTC, ASSU balloon
purchases, Cardinal football," said
sports desk editor Daniel Bohm 'lO,
a coterminal student. "But a glass of
scotch? No, I don't think so."
Members of the editorial staff
note that transitioning to the role of
editor in chief would not only be
beneficial for the paper, but for
Chaykowski as well.
"She's too easygoing and
happy," said deputy editor Kate Ab
bott 'l2. "The only way to crush her
optimism is to make her editor in
chief."
Chaykowski's victory, however,
was not free from controversy. It is
rumored that the incoming editor
bribed eligible voters with personal
favors.
"Yeah, I was kind of surprised to
find a chunky strawberry topper
outside my door with a personal let

ter attached to it," said ever-present
sports desk editor Miles Bennett-
Smith 'l3. "I was pretty sure by this
point that nobody else knew what
the hell those were. But I guess I'm
not the only one who appreciates
the finer portions of Jamba's
menu."

Reports that Chaykowski of
fered to throw in "a few free boosts"
to Bennett Smith's smoothie have
yet to be confirmed.
According to sports desk editor
Jacob Jaffe 'l2, Chaykowski offered
entire parcels of fruit snacks that
she intercepted en route to the
GovCo eating clubs.

"She sent me a few texts with
photos of the fruit snacks, but hon
estly I've got way more than I need
already," said Jaffe, who had just re
turned from a Safeway run.
"She did nothing for me," said
sports managing editor Nate
Adams 'l2, while gazing longingly
at her mesmerizing Winnipegian
features. "But that's ok. I'll have
plenty of chances with the copy staff
later ... just give 'em some free
quiz bowl points, and you're in."
Features desk editor Amy Julia
Harris 'll, a mentor to Chaykowski,
beamed in pride at her protege's
victory.
"Wow! Just... just wow! I'm re
ally, REALLY excited about this,"
Harris said, nodding her head ex
cessively as she spoke. "She'll defi
nitely bring a great feature to the
paper."
News managing editor An Le
Nguyen 'll was happy to pass on
her caffeine legacy to the incoming
editor in chief.
"I had my doubts about Kathleen
at first," Le Nguyen said, as she de
clined several offers of celebratory
champagne. "But when she told me
she had imbibed eight cups of cof
fee in one day, I knew I was in the
presence of someone special."

So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen,
adieu

While Chaykowski's ascension
to The Daily throne is highly antici
pated, there is little doubt that Vol
ume 239 editor in chief Zach Zim
merman's presence will be sorely
missed.
"He pumped up the mood in the
office by blasting TLC," said Wyn
dam Makowsky 'll. "The man par
tied like it was 1999."
Many staffers witnessed Zim
merman saying that he would never
devote his love to a "scrub," which
he described in song as "a guy who
thinks he's fly and is also known as a
buster" a descriptor that, thank
fully, is not fitting of Chaykowski.
"The show goes on," Zimmer
man said, with effortless swagger.
