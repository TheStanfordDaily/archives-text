## The

In the next few days, two of the
biggest soccer games in the
world will be played at Wem
bley, England's national sta
dium, in London the
Champions League Final and the
Championship Play-Off Final.
The first game is a huge deal. It's
the soccer equivalent of the Super
Bowl, pitting the best two Euro
pean clubs which effectively
means the best in the world
against each other in front of a
packed 90,000 seat stadium and a
potential TV audience of hundreds
of millions. The winning team will
walk away with 9m ($12.8 m),
which added to earnings from ticket
sales, TV rights and merchandise
through the earlier rounds of the
tournament could equate to some
thing like 50m ($71.3 m) in total in
come. It will also be the first time in
nearly 20 years that this game has
been played at the spiritual home of
soccer, and no one can doubt the
pedigree of the two teams involved:
Barcelona and Manchester United.
But that's just a warm-up the
real action will take place two days
later. I'd understand if you're a bit
suspicious of this statement, as the
two teams that will contest the Play-
Off Final Reading and Swansea
City are definitely not world
class, and I might be a little biased,
being from Reading. And although
there is some extra spice added by
the international flavor of the
match an English team against a
Welsh team the game certainly
doesn't have the global pull of the
Champions League Final. Where it
does win out is in pure, hard cash.
