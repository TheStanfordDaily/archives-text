## The 						price is right 
### Tom Taylor 
In the next few days, two of the
biggest soccer games in the
world will be played at Wem
bley, England's national sta
dium, in London the
Champions League Final and the
Championship Play-Off Final.
The first game is a huge deal. It's
the soccer equivalent of the Super
Bowl, pitting the best two Euro
pean clubs which effectively
means the best in the world
against each other in front of a
packed 90,000 seat stadium and a
potential TV audience of hundreds
of millions. The winning team will
walk away with 9m ($12.8 m),
which added to earnings from ticket
sales, TV rights and merchandise
through the earlier rounds of the
tournament could equate to some
thing like 50m ($71.3 m) in total in
come. It will also be the first time in
nearly 20 years that this game has
been played at the spiritual home of
soccer, and no one can doubt the
pedigree of the two teams involved:
Barcelona and Manchester United.
But that's just a warm-up the
real action will take place two days
later. I'd understand if you're a bit
suspicious of this statement, as the
two teams that will contest the Play-
Off Final Reading and Swansea
City are definitely not world
class, and I might be a little biased,
being from Reading. And although
there is some extra spice added by
the international flavor of the
match an English team against a
Welsh team the game certainly
doesn't have the global pull of the
Champions League Final. Where it
does win out is in pure, hard cash.
The losing team will walk away
with the entire gate receipts from
the match. With average ticket
prices over £5O ($80.9), this is a big
consolation prize even minus the
operating costs. So why are the
winners so generous? The real tro
phy at stake here is a place in the
English Premier League, making it
potentially the biggest prize
match in not just soccer, but in all
of sports.
The Premier League generates
over a billion dollars more than any
of the other major soccer leagues in
the world. Even finishing dead last
this year should still earn a club
around £4om ($64.7 m) from TV
rights alone. And those teams that
do finish at the bottom (and are
thus moved down a league) will be
guaranteed an income of another
£4om over the following three years
in "parachute payments" (intended
to protect teams from the financial
shock of moving down a league).
Factor in ticket sales, merchandise
and sponsorship, and the money at
stake could easily top slsom.
The two teams contesting the
Champions League Final will re
main at the cutting edge of soccer,
win or lose. They'll remain at the
top of their national leagues, be
cause both have already sealed
those titles, and they are guaran
teed another high-paying run in the
pan-European tournament next
year. Minus the trophy, the modest
cash prize and the extra notch by
their names in the history books, it
won't make a huge difference if
they win or lose. The Play-Off Final,
though, could make or break a
team, catapulting it to stardom or
dooming it to mediocrity. There is
no direct comparison in U.S. sports,
but it would be something like the
equivalent of the top college foot
ball teams being given the chance to
win a professional franchise. Imag
ine Stanford in the NFL.

But be careful what you wish for.
The financial shock of this sudden
leap in revenue can have unwanted
consequences. The teams dropping
down from the Premier League will
be hemorrhaging money and
with it, their star players but the
teams on the ascent are not im
mune to these concerns. Having im
pressed in the previous season,
their best players may be tempted

by offers from elsewhere and
the temptation to splash out and
buy a whole new squad can have
disastrous effects and saddle a club
with back-breaking debt. What
goes up often comes back down
again, and tasting the success of
promotion doesn't guarantee suc
cess once there. Fans accustomed to
the joy of seeing their team win con
sistently may have to trade this for
crushing defeat after crushing de
feat and the season-long fight just to
survive.

Realistically for the smaller
teams, though, this is a price worth
paying. They are unlikely to ever be
fighting for the top accolades, but

that doesn't mean they can't enjoy
the small victories that come their
way, and the hope however slight
it might be that the future could
be brighter. For most English soccer
fans, just the chance of seeing their
team play at Wembley is worth all
the frustration and heartbreak.
And I'm one of them. Come on,
Reading.

In addition to all of the money up for
grabs with relegation and promotion,
Tom Taylor has placed a £lom bet on
Reading to win, so let's just say it's no
coincidence that he thinks the Play-Off
Final is so important. Send him your

But that's just a warm-up the
real action will take place two days
later. I'd understand if you're a bit
suspicious of this statement, as the
two teams that will contest the Play-
Off Final Reading and Swansea
City are definitely not world
class, and I might be a little biased,
being from Reading. And although
there is some extra spice added by
the international flavor of the
match an English team against a
Welsh team the game certainly
doesn't have the global pull of the
Champions League Final. Where it
does win out is in pure, hard cash.
The losing team will walk away
with the entire gate receipts from
the match. With average ticket
prices over £5O ($80.9), this is a big
consolation prize even minus the
operating costs. So why are the
winners so generous? The real tro
phy at stake here is a place in the
English Premier League, making it
potentially the biggest prize
match in not just soccer, but in all
of sports.
The Premier League generates
over a billion dollars more than any
of the other major soccer leagues in
the world. Even finishing dead last
this year should still earn a club
around £4om ($64.7 m) from TV
rights alone. And those teams that
do finish at the bottom (and are
thus moved down a league) will be
guaranteed an income of another
£4om over the following three years
in "parachute payments" (intended
to protect teams from the financial
shock of moving down a league).
Factor in ticket sales, merchandise
and sponsorship, and the money at
stake could easily top slsom.
The two teams contesting the
Champions League Final will re
main at the cutting edge of soccer,
win or lose. They'll remain at the
top of their national leagues, be
cause both have already sealed
those titles, and they are guaran
teed another high-paying run in the
pan-European tournament next
year. Minus the trophy, the modest
cash prize and the extra notch by
their names in the history books, it
won't make a huge difference if
they win or lose. The Play-Off Final,
though, could make or break a
team, catapulting it to stardom or
dooming it to mediocrity. There is
no direct comparison in U.S. sports,
but it would be something like the
equivalent of the top college foot
ball teams being given the chance to
win a professional franchise. Imag
ine Stanford in the NFL.

But be careful what you wish for.
The financial shock of this sudden
leap in revenue can have unwanted
consequences. The teams dropping
down from the Premier League will
be hemorrhaging money and
with it, their star players but the
teams on the ascent are not im
mune to these concerns. Having im
pressed in the previous season,
their best players may be tempted

by offers from elsewhere and
the temptation to splash out and
buy a whole new squad can have
disastrous effects and saddle a club
with back-breaking debt. What
goes up often comes back down
again, and tasting the success of
promotion doesn't guarantee suc
cess once there. Fans accustomed to
the joy of seeing their team win con
sistently may have to trade this for
crushing defeat after crushing de
feat and the season-long fight just to
survive.

Realistically for the smaller
teams, though, this is a price worth
paying. They are unlikely to ever be
fighting for the top accolades, but

that doesn't mean they can't enjoy
the small victories that come their
way, and the hope however slight
it might be that the future could
be brighter. For most English soccer
fans, just the chance of seeing their
team play at Wembley is worth all
the frustration and heartbreak.
And I'm one of them. Come on,
Reading.

In addition to all of the money up for
grabs with relegation and promotion,
Tom Taylor has placed a £lom bet on
Reading to win, so let's just say it's no
coincidence that he thinks the Play-Off
Final is so important. Send him your
luck at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.
