# CLOSING TIME
## STANFORD ENDS PAC-10 SLATE AT CAL 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford baseball's regular
season comes to a close against
California this weekend, as the
Card heads to Berkeley for a
three-game series that has rival
ry drama written all over it.
The No. 23 Golden Bears (31-
18, 13-11 Pac-10) are just one

spot ahead of the No. 24 Cardi
nal (30-20,12-12) in both the na
tional and conference rankings,
and they will be looking for re
venge after Stanford took both
non-conference games between
the teams at Sunken Diamond
earlier this season. The Cardinal
pulled off a similar feat in 2009,
after having already been swept
by the Golden Bears in a week

end series to open Pac-10 play
the same year.
This time around, Stanford
will head to Berkeley to end the
season, coming in as one of three
teams tied for fifth in the Pac-10
and hoping to unseat fourth
place Cal. Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, Arizona and USC, the

two other schools with 12-12 con
ference records, will face off
against the two teams at the bot
tom of the standings namely,
Washington and Washington State
â€”in their respective series this
weekend. Stanford holds the
tiebreak over Arizona but not
USC, so the Cardinal cannot guar
antee a fourth-place finish unless
it gets some help, even in the case
of a sweep.
Ending the season on a high
note will be especially important,
with selections for the 64-team
NCAA Tournament to be re
leased on Monday at 9:30 a.m. and
regional play beginning on June 3.
The Golden Bears won't go
down easy, however, in what
should be one of the most evenly
matched series of the season for
Stanford. The squads boast two of
the Pac-10's most potent offenses,
with nearly identical numbers
the Cardinal holds only slight ad
vantages in batting average (.301
to .284), on-base percentage (.360
to .353), runs (270 to 261) and
homers (23 to 22).

But the Cardinal was held to
three or fewer runs in each of its
four games last week, scoring just
twice before the eighth inning
over that stretch and relying on
late-inning heroics in 1-0 and 2-1
victories over Arizona. The pair of
game-winning rallies the only
two times this season that Stan
ford has won while scoring fewer
than three runs was made pos
sible by stalwart pitching against
the Wildcats, as the Pac-10's top
offense was punched out 25 times
on the weekend despite averaging
just over five offensive strikeouts
per game on the season.

Cal is looking to avoid a similar
fate at the hands of the Cardinal
hurlers. The Golden Bears are
fresh off a 15-hit dismantling of
Pacific on Tuesday in a 9-2 win, be
hind four base-knocks from senior
left fielder Austin Booker. Booker
is one of just seven graduating
seniors between the teams in this
series, and he joins Stanford catch
er Zach Jones as one of only two
senior position players who have
held a consistent starting job in
the field this year.

Jones has been solid with three
hits against Cal this year, but Stan
ford's go-to guy in the first two
meetings with the Golden Bears
was sophomore centerfielder Jake
Stewart, whose welcome return
from appendicitis earlier this
month couldn't have come at a
better time. After recording two
hits in a 3-2 win over Cal on Feb.
22, Stewart came up huge with
four RBI in a 9-5 victory on April
25, launching a pair of two-run
doubles off senior righthander
Kevin Miller.
Stanford was in dire need of
clutch hitting in a 3-1 loss to Cal
Poly this Tuesday. Sophomore
third baseman Stephen Piscotty,
still leading the Cardinal in bat
ting average by 40 points, got on
base four times but never came
home to score, with the bottom
half of the order recording just
two hits. Piscotty, Stewart and
sophomore leftfielder Tyler
Gaffney who rides a 15-game
hitting streak into the series
will need to find away to spark of
fensive production against the
Golden Bears.

Play will kick off in Berkeley
this afternoon at 2:30 p.m., before
a rare Saturday doubleheader be
gins with planned 12:00 and 3:00
p.m. start times.
