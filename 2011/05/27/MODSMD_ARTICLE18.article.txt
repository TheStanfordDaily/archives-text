# FOOTBALL
## The
						path less walked on 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Nearly every player who joins the
Stanford football team follows the
same route: they hit the Farm in June
as incoming freshmen, go through
summer training camp and suit up in
time for the season's opening game.
But every now and then, a couple of
athletes choose a different path
one that leads them to the program
in the midst of both the academic
year and their Stanford careers.
Their backgrounds can be wildly
divergent, but generally, these play
ers, who begin with the Cardinal on a
tryout basis, share similarities
they've been actively involved in
athletics in college and have a burn
ing desire to, with no assurance of
playing time or even a spot on the
team, strap on a helmet and hit the
gridiron one last time.
"Later in life you can play almost
anything at a master's level," said
Dan Priestley 'O9. "But not football."
Priestley joined the Cardinal in
March of 2009, in between the first
and second sessions of spring prac
tice. A swimmer for four seasons
he won All-American honors as a
junior Priestley switched pro
grams after the Pac-10 Champi
onships of his senior year. Due to an
NCAA rule that allows for an extra
year of eligibility to athletes who
change sports, he was able to do
something he hadn't done since mid
dle school play football.
He had no illusions of grandeur,
and knew that the chances of getting
into a game were small indeed,
after earning a roster spot, he never
stepped on the field during the 2009
season. But as a scout team defen
sive end Priestley stands at 6-
foot-5 and put on 25 pounds of mus
cle after joining the program he

was able to assist the squad in its
weekly preparations. He was, in his
own words, essentially a freshman,
but with vast varsity athletics experi
ence and almost no wear or tear on
his joints due to the non-impact ele
ments of swimming. Priestley was
thus able to play the hundreds of
snaps per practice that the scout
team requires.
"I was there for a year to work
hard, have fun and contribute any
way I could," he said.
"We don't know if they can play
in a game on Saturday, but we want
to see if they can contribute in prac
tice," said director of player develop
ment Ron Lynn about spring walk
ons.
Priestley was an exception be
cause of his swimming background,
but generally, Lynn said that, in addi
tion to in-person meetings and "a lit
tle bit of an eyeball test," coaches
like to analyze between 30-50 plays
of high school film to see if a player is
fit to try out.
That was the case with sopho
more Cason Kynes, who walked on
to the team this spring. A high school
football player, Kynes joined the
Stanford rugby team during his
freshman season, but after helping
coach quarterbacks at his alma
mater during the following summer,
Kynes felt an itch to get back to the
gridiron.

"I was watching these guys on Fri
day nights and I thought, 'Man, I re
ally miss this, this is something I real
ly enjoy,'" he said.
It made sense: Kynes comes from
a football family one devoted to
the University of Florida. His grand
father and father both played for the
Gators. His three older brothers all
played high school football and one,
Matt, was a walk-on quarterback at
Florida in the mid-2000s and helped

teach Tim Tebow the Gators' play
book. His family owns season tickets
and growing up, Cason would travel
from northern Virginia to Gain
seville for a number of games every
year.
Playing for Florida was his
dream, but whereas Matt is 6-foot-2,
Cason is, by his own admission, "5-
foot-10 with shoes" and "not the
biggest, fastest or strongest guy." He
was a quarterback and safety in high
school, but was only lightly recruit
ed. He took one official visit to
Division 111 Wheaton College. When
he took off his pads after the playoffs
in his senior year, he thought he was
removing them for the final time.
But as his sophomore year ap
proached and he finished coaching
at his high school, he made the deci
sion to try and walk-on. He spoke
with Lynn throughout the fall and
submitted his game film. Then in
February, less than a week before the
first spring session was set to begin,
he received word: pass a physical and
get ready, because practice starts on
Monday.
"I put my head down and got to
work," said Kynes, who was placed at
strong safety and did enough to earn
a spot on the team.
Kynes may have been one of the
few players without a nameplate, but
he hardly felt like an outsider; Priest
ley echoed that sentiment. Both
players noted that once they hit the
field, they were dealt with just like
any other player.
"Guys were introducing them
selves to me and were interested in
getting to know me," Kynes said.
"From the coaches side, I was so im
pressed. From day one they treated
me just like any other player, even
though I hadn't proved anything of
myself. I was just a new guy stepping
in and yet they coached me just like
they would coach anyone else."
While the on field handling of the
spring walk-ons was similar to any
other player, the evaluations were a
bit different.

"They aren't treated any differ
ently, but each guy is evaluated, and
if he looks way out of place, we'll talk
to him. Don't want him wasting his
time and don't want him to get in
jured or injure someone else be
cause of lack of body control," Lynn
said.

Indeed, not every player who
tries out in the spring makes the cut.

Junior Stanley Fich, formerly of the
baseball team, contended for a ros
ter spot at outside linebacker this
year he and Kynes shared a lock
er but his bid ended after he suf
fered a knee injury.
But for those who do make it, the
chance to help the team and ingrati
ate themselves within the program
is the overriding objective, even if
the chances of actual playing time
are slim.
"My goal from day one was to

find away to contribute so that
when Stanford played on Saturday, I
would know that Stanford had a bet
ter chance of winning because I was
on the team," Kynes said. "It might
not be on the field, but that won't
stop me from competing in practice.
"It's a good group of guys that
play great football. That's what I
want to be a part of."
