# TAKING BACK TAUBE
## KLAHN AND THACHER CRUISING 
### DASH DAVIDSON STAFF WRITER 
It was a successful day
for Stanford men's tennis on
Thursday at the Taube Ten
nis Center.as junior Bradley
Klahn Stanford's lone
hope for the NCAA Singles
Championship advanced
to the third round. And his
day only got better from
there.

After defeating second
round opponent senior
Austin Krajicek in straight
sets, Klahn and his doubles
partner, fellow Stanford
junior Ryan Thacher, won
their opening match in the
doubles portion of the
NCAA Tournament.
Klahn had an easier time
on the court in the second
match of his title defense,
dispatching Krajicek 6-1,6-4

the second time in a
week that Klahn has defeat
ed Krajicek. A week ago, in
the round of 16 of the
NCAA Team Tournament,
the match between Texas
A&M and Stanford was
clinched by Klahn, when he
struck the final shot in his 6-
4,6-3 victory over Krajicek.
The luck of the singles draw

brought the two All-Ameri
cans back together again on
Thursday on the same court.
It was a different day and a
different tournament, but
unfortunately for Krajicek,
the result was the same.

The victorious Klahn,
the defending NCAA sin
gles champion from a year
ago when he shocked the
college tennis world in
Athens, Ga., acknowledged
the difficulty of facing Kra
jicek again.
"It's certainly hard," he
said about defeating the
same player twice in a week.
"I've known Austin for a
while. We're good friends
and travel together, so that's
not easy.

"I thought I started off a
lot better today ener
gized and not as sluggish as
yesterday," he continued. "I
thought I really played ag
gressively at the start, kind
of took it to him, got him off
balance a little bit. I was
pleased with my play."

Klahn will need to con
tinue his energized play as
he looks to repeat his title.
On Friday, he will face off
against No. 22 Jose Hernan
dez of the University of

North Carolina, who is com
ing off an impressive upset
win over Florida's Alexan
dre Lacroix, ranked No. 7 in
the country.

Klahn's side of the draw
has started to open up a lit
tle bit, as many of the top-

ranked players have fallen
to lesser-ranked foes. No. 2
Alex Domijan of Virginia,
No. 6 Eric Quigley of Ken
tucky and Lacroix have all
been removed from Klahn's
path, leaving No. 4 Rhyne
Williams of Tennessee as the
only higher-ranked player
left on his side of the draw.
Then again, as Klahn
showed the country last
year, rankings only mean so
much.
Seeded No. 3 in the dou
bles portion of the NCAA
tournament, Klahn and

Juniors Bradley Klahn (left) and Ryan Thacher (right) advanced to the round of 16 in the doubles
draw of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday. Klahn also advanced in the singles draw.
Thacher breezed through their
opening match against Kentucky's
Brad Cox and Eric Quigley, 6-1,7-6
(5). The Cardinal doubles team has
experienced success before in the
NCAA Tournament, losing a tight
match in last year's semifinals to
Drew Courtney and Michael
Shabaz of Virginia, who are seeded
No. 2 in this year's tournament.

Thacher, who lost a hard-fought
match against Ohio State's No. 5
seeded Blaz Rola yesterday, has
been eliminated from the singles
event but still has a chance to win a
national title on his home court with
teammate Klahn.
The doubles team returns to the
courts this afternoon at 3 p.m.
against the No. 24 seeded team of
Clifford Muarsland and Ashley
Watling, from the University of
