## TV SHOWS TO NETFLIX 
### 
Although our GPAs would probably disagree, Netflix
Instant Watch is, without question, the greatest thing to
ever happen to Intermission. Now that weve entere d this
weird TV purgatory where on-air shows are winding down
and trashy summer reality shows are still a couple weeks
away, Netflix is the perfect place to get your temporary
TV fix.

"Parks and Recreation"
Season one isn't that stellar, so skip it if you must, but seri
ously, it's literally one of the best shows on TV right now, so
get caught up. It's a proven fact that quality of life instantly
skyrockets once you start following the Ron Swanson
Pyramid of Greatness.
"Archer"
With "South Park", "Family Guy" and "The Simpsons" all
showing moderate to heavy signs of age, "Archer" is here to
answer all your adult cartoon needs.
"Better Off Ted"
If the Bluths decided to take cubicle jobs, you'd probably
end up with something similar to "Better Off Ted." Curse
ABC for yanking this one too soon. For those with limited
time commitment, make sure to at least check out the sub
lime "Racial Sensitivity" and "Jabberwocky."
"Pushing Daisies"
Another ABC show felled too soon, this time by the blasted
2007-08 writers' strike. The whimsical "forensic fairy tale" fol
lows Ned (Lee Pace), a pie-maker who can bring back the
dead with his touch.
"Party Down"
Although Intermission sorely misses the bow-tied crew of
cater waiters, if the show hadn't been cancelled, Adam Scott
wouldn't be on "Parks & Rec" now. At least we'll always have
the series to Netflix and reminisce.
