With two decades of work under his belt,
Stephan Jenkins and his band, Third Eye
Blind, were in for something of a home
coming on Thursday night. After having toured the
world, Jenkins has had little time to spend in Palo
Alto, a place he used to call home. Sitting down to
talk to Intermission with drummer Brad Hargreaves,
the Third Eye Blind singer told us of how he made
his mark here at the University, literally, and told of
past crushes from Branner Hall and his old exploits
in the CoHo before his show last night at Memorial
Auditorium for the Verizon Wireless' Coffee Shop
Series.

You graduated from Gunn High School Right?
Stephan Jenkins: I did.
How did it feel growing up around Stanford?
SJ: You know, I grew up here and then I left and I
really haven't been back. It's really fantastic to come
back here. I grew up in College Terrace, and I'm just
amazed it hasn't changed.
Is that good?
SJ: It's still quaint and I love that. It's gotten a lot

smaller, it seems. I rode around the campus. I went to Escondido
Elementary School, and my mom worked with Paul Berg in the bio
chemistry department. As soon as this interview is done, I'm going to
go up to Bill Dement's house, he's the sleep research professor. I'm
going to visit them they're like old friends and I haven't seen them
in years.
He stopped teaching his class last year.
SJ: He's old! He's just old, man.
Any pressures to ever come to Stanford, either of you?
SJ: I felt like I had already gone here, I felt like I had already gone to
Stanford. No, I didn't want to go here at all. Like a lot of people from
Gunn went to Stanford. To me it felt like going to Foothill [College],
But now I look at it, it's just picturesque. It's divine. It's beautiful. I
love Stanford.
Were you guys one of those biker kids that spend time around cam
pus? Did you spend time on campus when you were going to Gunn?
SJ: I did, yeah. When I was 8-years old, I came over here to MemAud
and I snuck in with two of my friends. Doors were open, no security
and I climbed up the catwalk to the very top and pissed off of
it. It was fantastic! It was a great moment. I marked that stage.
You pissed onto the stage?
SJ: Yeah.
So, the one you're playing on tonight?
r 'SJ: Yes.
How did that feel?

SJ: It felt like high-speed rail, my
friend. It was great. We used to ride
our bikes up to the Coffee House,
and they had this video game up
there called "Space Invaders." We'd
get these hot chocolate things and
play "Space Invaders."
And then I had a tutor, and she
was like a woman. She was just a
woman. She was so hot. She lived in
this great big palace called Branner
Hall, and she tutored me in English.
She was so old. She was a freshman
in college.
Did you have a crush?
SJ: I had a huge crush on her. She

had really strong legs. I was like in
the fifth grade. That was about it.
She had really athletic thighs.

So you guys are playing a "Coffee
Shop" Series on the stage behind us,
You guys are going to play electric
right? Not acoustic?

SJ: Yeah, we were going to play
acoustic ,and I guess the fire marshall
figured out and knew who our band
was and thought that would be a riot
and be a big problem. I don't think
he really understands Stanford stu
dents, they have their own agendas.
There's not going to be a riot.

When you guys go acoustic, Brad,

do you play?
Brad Hargreaves: Yeah, I do some
times. We were kind of disappointed
that we couldn't play the coffee shop.
We were looking forward to playing
that and it got changed to a normal
show for us, instead of something
that was unique
SJ: Yeah, I feel the same way, I would
have liked to play the coffee shop.
