With two decades of work under his belt,
Stephan Jenkins and his band, Third Eye
Blind, were in for something of a home
coming on Thursday night. After having toured the
world, Jenkins has had little time to spend in Palo
Alto, a place he used to call home. Sitting down to
talk to Intermission with drummer Brad Hargreaves,
the Third Eye Blind singer told us of how he made
his mark here at the University, literally, and told of
past crushes from Branner Hall and his old exploits
in the CoHo before his show last night at Memorial
Auditorium for the Verizon Wireless' Coffee Shop
Series.

You graduated from Gunn High School Right?
Stephan Jenkins: I did.
How did it feel growing up around Stanford?
SJ: You know, I grew up here and then I left and I
really haven't been back. It's really fantastic to come
back here. I grew up in College Terrace, and I'm just
amazed it hasn't changed.
Is that good?
SJ: It's still quaint and I love that. It's gotten a lot
