In the world of Death
Cab For Cutie fans,
there are those who

were swept up by the 2005
hit "Plans" and may or may

not have picked up the band's

2008 follow-up, "Narrow Stairs";

those who, early in the decade, soul
searched in the equally dark and
wondrous mire of "Transatlanticism"
or found a comforting balance of
solemn reflection and measured
prospection in "The Photo Album";
and those who fell for the boys
from Bellingham when they first

dissected yearning hearts into dark chords and crooning
vocals in "Something About Airplanes" and "We Have the
Facts and We're Voting Yes."

While it might be tempting to construct some hierar
chy of fandom among these groups, in reality they repre
sent the many ways in which people have connected to a
dynamic band over the last 13 years. Death Cab's seventh
studio album, "Codes and Keys," will likely evoke slightly
different reactions from different fans when it's released
on May 31. But at its core, it presents something for
everyone, and it does so in the most mature and heart
warming fashion to date.

Ever since a smiling Ben Gibbard hopped on stage at
San Francisco's Great American Music Hall in February
flashing a wedding ring from actress and singer Zooey
Deschanel, expectations for "Codes and Keys" swung away
from the bleak sounds of "Narrow Stairs" and toward
some bright, unknown potential that lingered for months.
But the band's latest release is not just some happiness
fest. Rather, its 11 tracks comprise a thoughtful presenta
tion whose layers grow richer and more complex from
beginning to end.
In the title track, an upbeat piano line dances atop
eager drums while, in a paradox of mood, Gibbard's
yearning vocals describe a relationship thinning with
every word. But by the end of the track, the paradox is
resolved with the realization that, unlike in the past, when
we might have expected Gibbard to succumb to the pains
of being without the one he loves, in this album a cau
tious sense of confidence pervades and ultimately prevails.
"Like a child throwing stones at the sky" love inevitably falls
back to earth, and, despite the occasional temptation to
lock our emotions behind codes and keys, ultimately "Wfe
are one/We are alive."

The theme that it's okay to love is repeated through
out the album, wrapped in upbeat melodies by bassist
Nick Harmer and drummer Jason McGerr and topped
with atmospheric touches by guitarist and producer Chris
Walla. Still carrying a weighty theme, the up-tempo
