Rather than explore one theme or
musical trend, the album runs in several
different directions at once. It is a
ble smorgasbord of themes and sounds.
Lady Gaga covers familiar territory —
sex, religion, rebellion while reaching
into her past with personal lyrics and
reminding listeners several times that we

are all" born this way.' Sound-wise, the
album draws variably from 'Bos pop,

'Bos rock and '9os-style dance
beats, as Gaga takes on a myriad
of personas from Queen to
"Government Hooker."
The results are mixed but

strong overall. At its best, first single
"Born this Way" is a reminder of why
Lady Gaga became huge in the first

place, with ridiculously catchy choruses
and playful lyrics. However, sometimes
it feels too referential to the point of
being stale and unoriginal, and even
shallow.

The album opens with "Marry the
Night," a synth-and-keyboard heavy
number that starts quiet but builds to a
loud, heart-pounding finish. It's soulful
and well-produced, and Lady Gaga's
vocals are fierce, offering a promising
prelude of what's to come.

The album continues with
"Government Hooker," where Gaga
croons, "Put your hands on me/John F.
Kennedy'' The song opens with an
unexpected operatic hook before mov
ing into a fun, electric beat and addictive
chorus. Another favorite is feminist
anthem "Schiebe," where Gaga speaks
German over a Euro-style dance beat.

"Judas," Gaga's homage to a biblical
love triangle, recalls "Bad Romance"
with its opening hook (" Judas/Jud-ah
ah") but features a harder, industrial
beat that masterfully blends with a
pleading pop chorus. In contrast, "Hair"
is a playful track with unimpressive
lyrics but a chorus that's more of a rock
anthem. "Americano" contrasts every
thing else on the album with its Latin
inspired sound, modern-musical lyrics
and lilting vocal opening.
Some of the coolest tracks, like
"Bloody Mary" with its creepy opening
children's chorus and slow, deliberate
build, and "Electric Chapel" with its
unusual opening guitar and some of
Gaga's best vocals, are great examples of
how Gaga pushes the boundaries of pop

with tracks that are nothing like any
thing else on the radio right now.
"Heavy Metal Lover" features some
of the dirtiest, catchiest lyrics ("I want
your whiskey mouth/all over my blond
south") on the album over a blistering
synth background, while "Highway
Unicorn (Road to Love)" channels
Springsteen for a pop anthem to uni
corns and motorcycles (because honest
ly, who would expect Gaga to choose
between the two?).

However, some of the bonus tracks
like "Fashion of His Love" and "Black
Jesus + American Fashion" rely too
much on 'Bos disco chords and sound



COURTESY INTERSCOPE
bland in contrast. "The Edge of
Glory," which should be one of the
album's standouts, uses an uninspired
dance beat when it could have stood
alone as a ballad.
Speaking of ballads, Lady Gaga
re-imagines "You and I," which she
has been performing on tour since
2009 as a simple piano-and-vocal
piece, with electric guitar and a chorus
of background singers that makes the
track sound, oddly, just a few steps
away from country.
Despite some missteps, Lady

Gaga has crafted an ambitious, unique
and complicated album that is much
more interesting than the average
radio pop song today. After all, it
would be asking too much of Gaga to
stick to just one style or persona. As
she points out in "Government
Hooker," "I could be anything/1 could
be everything."
