-w-t is true that the sandwich is

i named after the
fourth Earl of
Sandwich, but he did
not invent the dish;
the concoction has
been consumed for at
least a few millennia.
For example, the

Jewish leader Hillel from the first
century B.C. devised the "Hillel
sandwich" for Passover comprised
of bitter herbs between two pieces
of matzo (essentially crackers). The
simplicity of the dish, which has in
part facilitated the sandwich's
longevity, also makes it somewhat
difficult for a sandwich shop to be
spectacular. Such is the case with
Ace of Sandwiches a plethora of
delicious options but nothing phe
nomenal.

The store is an inconspicuous
stop in a corner mall with a handful
of tables. It is, of course, extremely
casual and essentially limited to a
quick lunch since it is only open
until the confusing time of 6 p.m.

Some sandwiches at Ace are
very good. For example, Ace's take
on the Classic Reuben is actually
quite interesting. The sandwich is
served between two thick, toasty
slices of rye that are delicious but

border on too bready for the con-

tents. But they have
moved the sandwich in
the right direction
rather than an explo
sion of dressing and
sauerkraut that leads to
the usual post-Reuben
lethargy, Ace produces

a manageable sandwich that is a
good introduction to a classic for
the uninitiated. The Plymouth

Rock combines some excellent fla
vors and is quite strong as well. The
cranberry sauce and stuffing,

though, feel moderately industrial
and don't really impart enough of
those warming, Thanksgiving emo
tions. Furthermore, while the

Dutch Crunch is in general excel
lent, it might be too much for this
sandwich and makes the mouth feel
a touch drier than is ideal.

The gravy on the Louisiana Po'
Boy suffers from the same issues as
the stuffing on the Plymouth Rock.
It masks the flare of the Dijon

somewhat, and the sandwich, while
providing a good variety of texture
and an interesting flavor profile,
does not entirely deliver what the

aesthetics appear to promise. One
