## Strong,but no trump cards at Ace Sandwiches

-w-t is true that the sandwich is

i named after the
fourth Earl of
Sandwich, but he did
not invent the dish;
the concoction has
been consumed for at
least a few millennia.
For example, the

Jewish leader Hillel from the first
century B.C. devised the "Hillel
sandwich" for Passover comprised
of bitter herbs between two pieces
of matzo (essentially crackers). The
simplicity of the dish, which has in
part facilitated the sandwich's
longevity, also makes it somewhat
difficult for a sandwich shop to be
spectacular. Such is the case with
Ace of Sandwiches a plethora of
delicious options but nothing phe
nomenal.

The store is an inconspicuous
stop in a corner mall with a handful
of tables. It is, of course, extremely
casual and essentially limited to a
quick lunch since it is only open
until the confusing time of 6 p.m.

Some sandwiches at Ace are
very good. For example, Ace's take
on the Classic Reuben is actually
quite interesting. The sandwich is
served between two thick, toasty
slices of rye that are delicious but

border on too bready for the con-

tents. But they have
moved the sandwich in
the right direction
rather than an explo
sion of dressing and
sauerkraut that leads to
the usual post-Reuben
lethargy, Ace produces

a manageable sandwich that is a
good introduction to a classic for
the uninitiated. The Plymouth

Rock combines some excellent fla
vors and is quite strong as well. The
cranberry sauce and stuffing,

though, feel moderately industrial
and don't really impart enough of
those warming, Thanksgiving emo
tions. Furthermore, while the

Dutch Crunch is in general excel
lent, it might be too much for this
sandwich and makes the mouth feel
a touch drier than is ideal.

The gravy on the Louisiana Po'
Boy suffers from the same issues as
the stuffing on the Plymouth Rock.
It masks the flare of the Dijon

somewhat, and the sandwich, while
providing a good variety of texture
and an interesting flavor profile,
does not entirely deliver what the

aesthetics appear to promise. One

The Ace of Clubs: one of the deli's most popular sandwiches.

of the biggest surprises on the
menu, though, is the Atomic
Pastrami. With jalapenos, jalapeno
chips, pepper jack cheese and
horseradish, one would expect a
sinus-clearing experience from just
the aroma. Somewhere along the
way, the spice simply didn't show
up, and the heat is tolerable even
for the non-adventurous. The sand
wich is still delicious, and the
crunch of the chips makes it a
pleasure to eat, but there may be
expectations left unmet.
Many sandwiches are only
moderately tasty or even mediocre.
The Ace of Clubs is an unfortunate

semi-namesake, because it is not
particularly strong. The French roll
it comes on is delectably buttery,
and the sandwich is decent but ulti
mately somewhat forgettable. The
Albuquerque Turkey has so much
potential with ingredients such as
Boar's Head Salsalito turkey, pepper
jack cheese and pesto. Somehow,
though, all the flavors end up rela

tively muted and, despite the excel
lent pressed focaccia, the sandwich
is not as stellar as expected. The
Tuna Panini is entirely under
whelming. It is refreshing to find
essentially a tuna melt that doesn't
ooze mayonnaise, and in that sense,
the sandwich is fairly crisp, but the
experience doesn't last a moment
longer than the life of the sandwich
itself.
There is probably not a single
displeasing option at Ace of
Sandwiches; the entire menu is
dependable. The reduced volatility,
though, comes with the standard
risk tradeoff you are less likely to
hit a home run. Accordingly, while
the shop does serve some very good
sandwiches, it ends up at the higher
end of "middle of the road."
