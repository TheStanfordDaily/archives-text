# MONSTER SLAYER
## WARM FUZZIES FROM THE STRANGEST OF SOURCES 
### – nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
There's not too much going on in gaming this
week. At least not on the surface. We're in the
proverbial calm before the storm that is E3
the Christmas Day of gaming, if all of Santa's presents
were juicy revelations and trailers that brought fanboys
to tears. That's not to say there isn't anything going on
right now, though developers and publishers are
busier now than ever, preparing their punchlines and
pyrotechnics, ironing out kinks in gameplay demos
and shuffling a lucky batch of journalist bigwigs
around L.A. to judge content for E3 awards. For every
one else, it's crickets. (If you're Sony, you might also be
fine-tuning your apology for one of the biggest net-

work security gaffes in history. I wonder who they'll
trot out on stage to deliver it.)
Given the paucity of new releases and big
announcements this week, I decided I'd embrace the

moment and delve into something totally outside the
mainstream totally, completely and entirely outside it.
Enter Garshasp: The Monster Slayer. The name
alone is no doubt enough to make you trip over your
tongue, which is exactly what you'd be doing with your
controller if you actually picked it up and played the
game. As soon as you stop chuckling at one of the most
poorly deployed late title cards in recent memory and
get down to business, you'll be glad of the unintention
al cheese-factor that seeps into every bit of the experi
ence. Aside from its laughably steely voice acting and
busted facial animations, the game is competent if not
yawn inducing. I say "mid-2000s action game"; you say
"light attack, heavy attack, block, roll and grab." Throw
in a busted camera and some PS2-era jank, and you'd
be about right. Garshasp is the most direct clone of
God of War you'll ever see without a Gameloff logo on
it. It's a complete rip-off that scored a whopping 49 on
Metacritic — forty-freaking-nine — and after 10 min
utes had me sighing "Oh, games ..." to myself with a
morbid sort of fascination. I'm sure most people

would've gone for Ctrl+Alt+Del even sooner.
So why am I wasting your time with this? Because
the awful reviews, antiquated controls and vapid pres
entation don't tell the whole story of Garshasp.

Remember that morbid fascination I mentioned a

moment ago? Turns out there's genuine academic
appeal to the origins of Garshasp if you're into that
sort of thing.

What if I told you this? Garshasp was developed in
Iran. It was built by a handful of guys using free soft-

ware on pretty standard computers, and it was digitally
released worldwide without a major publisher. Its story
is based on Persian legend, and back in Iran, that's a

bigger deal than you might think. Ambition might not
always equal aptitude or proper finances but

damn if I'm not impressed by the effort. I can't say that
I know everything about the legal and economic reali
ties of game development in Iran, but I'm sure that
putting out a $2O indie title on the PC that at least
superficially resembles major console releases isn't
quite as easy over there.

I don't mean to imply, by the way, that small stu
dios in foreign countries can't make great games. The
list of stunners from these lesser-known developers
runs deep, but you only have to go as far back as last
week The Witcher 2 from CD Projekt in Warsaw is
probably the most gorgeous RPG ever released, and
critics are eating it up. So am I. In fact, as I write this,
Steam is downloading a patch for Witcher 2 that's six
times the size of Garshasp.
Garshasp may be underwhelming, but it's also
inspiring. It's a small but moving testament to the global
appeal and accessibility of the medium. It was simple
and cheap to make, and the language of gameplay is

more universal than a subtitled film or book. I know it
sounds a little dramatic, but playing Garshasp was a
more touching experience than I would've thought
not because the game itself is great, but because in a
small but real way, I was connecting with people around
the world in away that only games can offer.
