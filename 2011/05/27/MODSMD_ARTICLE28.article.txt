CCnrihe Hangover: Part II," director Todd
Phillips' follow-up to his 2009 hit, is
-A- exactly that: the same premise, but
in a new city and with a bigger role for Mr.
Chow (Ken Jeong). The result feels more like an
unabashed re-make than a sequel and ultimately
fails to live up to the innovation and side-split
ting raunchiness of the original.
Set two years after Doug's (Justin Bartha)
wedding, "The Hangover: Part II" reunites the
wolf pack for dentist Stu's (Ed Helms) turn at
the altar. (Alas, Heather Graham's character has
been replaced by a decidedly less interesting
Jamie Chung). Given the disastrous turn of
events at the last bachelor party, Stu tries to sat
isfy his groomsmen with a bachelor brunch but
is vehemently overruled by Phil (Bradley
Cooper), the restless family man. At the behest
of Doug's wife, everyone's favorite bearded side
kick, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), gets invited last
minute to the wedding party, and the friends set
off for Thailand, also joined by the bride's

younger brother. After the rehearsal dinner, one
drink cuts to the next morning, and thereafter,
the story devolves into situations that seem all
too familiar: a case of mistaken identity, the
questionable use of animals, a ransom scheme,
an MIA groom and excessive male nudity, to
name a few.

At the outset, the char
acters seem rusty and tense
as though they, like the

audience, know what is
expected of them and are
unsure of whether they can

deliver. But once the insanity of events has com
menced and the phrase, "I can't believe this is
happening again," is exhausted, the story quickly
picks up steam. On one hand, the film retains a
constant level of humor simply be adhering so
strongly to the formula of the original, but on
the other, the predictability makes everything
less funny. To be fair, "The Hangover: Part II"
does have its moments, but overall, the script
lacks its predecessor's cleverness. In Bangkok,
which serves as the new Las Vegas, Stu, Phil and
Alan are like mere vestiges of their former selves,
invoking elements from the 2009 film rather
than bringing anything fresh to the characters.
Because Phillips was approached to draft a
sequel even before the theatrical release of "The
Hangover," it is somewhat surprising that he
opted not to deviate from its basic plot without
knowing of its commercial and critical success.
The main problem with the new installment is
that, particularly in Hollywood, lightning rarely
strikes twice. When a film becomes a block-

buster for the ways in which it pushes the enve

lope (in this case, liberating the R-rated comedy
and road movie conventions), one cannot sim
ply rehash the same story and expect it to per
form as well. Whether "The Hangover: Part II" is
a case of a director's commitment to his fanbase
gone awry or simply another lazy product of the
Hollywood industrial complex, the bottom line
is that it would have been better for Phillips to
have tried something new than to have not
tried.

Don't get me wrong, though: if you're look
ing for laughs, you will find them, and moviego
ers from this readership are sure to appreciate

the film's lone Stanford reference. In the bigger
picture, however, "The Hangover: Part II" is sim
ply not the big kick-off to summer movies that
it could have been. Today, in the age of sequels
and franchises that are renewed long past their
expiration dates ("Pirates of the Caribbean,"
anyone?), it's about time Hollywood realizes that
if it wants to bring audiences to the theaters, it
needs to give us something new.
