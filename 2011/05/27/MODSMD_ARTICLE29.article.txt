In "L'amour fou," Pierre
Thoretton's documentary
feature on the industrialist

Pierre Berge and his partner,
the fashion legend Yves Saint
Laurent, romantic and work
ing relationships take a back
seat to the tempestuous life
and times of the late designer.
After enjoying an illustri
ous career as a fashion designer
and icon, Saint Laurent passed
away in 2008 at the age of 71
with a public send-off worthy
of royalty. The streets of Paris
were packed with onlookers as
his body was transported to its
final resting place, and it is in
the aftermath that the first nar
rative begins. As self-described
"undertakers of art," Saint

Laurent and Berge amassed,
over a period of decades, a pri
vate art collection to rival a
modest museum. Once wid
owed, however, Berge sought
to breathe new life into the

treasures he and Saint Laurent
had cherished, resulting in a
massive auction held by
Christie's at the Grand Palais in
February 2009, the proceeds of
which Berge pledged to AIDS
research.

But despite the couple's
ties to the collection being the
purported premise of the film,
it is the second narrative, the
biography of Saint Laurent,
which effectively supplants the
first. Scenes of the flat they
shared together for decades,
interspersed with Berge's com
mentary, gradually segue into a
lengthy chronicle of Saint
Laurent's life, beginning with
his succession to the Dior fash

ion house at age 21 (Saint
Laurent and Berge first met at
Christian Dior's funeral)
through his retirement in
2002, until he succumbed to
brain cancer six years later.
Through photographs, footage
and personal accounts from
close friends, Saint Laurent
emerges as a tortured artist
who, throughout his career,
constantly battled depression
and substance abuse. Even
after the designer came into his
own and achieved success with
his namesake label, Berge
lamented that the only time
Saint Laurent seemed truly
happy was when the audience
broke into applause after the
unveiling of a new collection.
Featuring footage from
past runway shows, sketches
and photographs of Saint
Laurent's work, as well as

inside looks at the couple's
sumptuous Parisian flat and
Moroccan getaway, "L'amour
fou" is a visual treat. Ever

inspired by his surroundings,
the designer leaves no doubt
he was as stylish as the clothes
he produced. A true visionary
credited with revamping haute
couture early in his career,

Saint Laurent's eventual retire
ment was precipitated by his
belief that the industry had
been taken over by tradesmen.
Through the lenses of
Berge and those who knew
Saint Laurent best, "L'amour
fou" provides a privileged look
into the private life of a legend.
While fashionistas and diehard
YSL fans will probably enjoy
the experience regardless, lay
people (such as myself) are


more likely to find the documentary
too long and too disorganized.
Although Thoretton attempts to
make the designer's life dovetail with
Berge's coming to terms with his
death and finding meaning in the art
collection they shared, the narrative
ultimately feels muddled. Berge still
features prominently in telling his
partner's story but loses agency as the
dominant voice. Likewise, even
though the film concludes with
footage of the auction, after Saint
Laurent's exposition, the art collec
tion seems like a mere afterthought.
Despite the lack of narrative
cohesion, Thoretton succeeds in com
posing a beautiful elegy, made more
poignant by Berge's constant pres
ence. In the film's final scenes, he
calmly observes the auction, hoping
that each piece can bring its new
owner as much satisfaction as it


brought him and his partner.
