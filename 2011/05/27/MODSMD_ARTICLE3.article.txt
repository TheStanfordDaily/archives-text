# THREE WOMEN INTO SINGLES SWEET 16

### CHRISSY JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After suffering a heart
breaking defeat in the team
portion of the NCAA Na
tional Championship Tues
day night, senior Flilary

Barte, freshman Nicole
Gibbs and sophomore
Stacey Tan are moving for
ward and focusing their at
tention on a quest for an
NCAA individual title.
Each successfully survived
the round of 32 on Thursday
and will appear in the round
of 16 today. Barte and soph
omore Mallory Burdette
also coasted into the dou
bles round of 16 with their
victory over Michaela
Kissell and Dominica Za
prazna of Marshall.
Gibbs explained that the
Cardinal's loss to the Flori
da Gators was a huge disap

pointment, but she under
stands that, in order to suc
ceed, she cannot focus on
the past.
"Tennis is a sport where
you have to have a very
short memory for your loss
es," she said. "The team loss
definitely [hurts] morale
moving into individuals, but
at the same time, it's a very
separate event and we com
partmentalize that. The rea
son we were out there prac
ticing every day and work
ing hard was for the team
event, and now we are just
excited to get out there and
play more tennis after the
whistle blows."

Gibbs, who is unseeded,
was certainly focused on
Thursday in her win over
USC's Danielle Lao, 6-2, 6-
1, who plays No. 2 for the
Trojans.
"I think I played really
solid tennis today, and the
score reflected that," Gibbs
said. "She was definitely no
easy opponent, but I exe
cuted well, hit my forehand
well, and served well. I tried
to exploit her weaknesses
and impose my own
strengths."

Tan also moved on with

a victory, defeating Sanaa
Bhambri of North Carolina
State despite dropping the
first set 5-7. She rallied back
in the second set to win 6-3
and carried the momentum
on into the third set, which
she swept 6-1.
The Cardinal's highest
ranked player in the indi
vidual draw is the No. 3-
seeded Barte, who cruised
past Kelcy McKenna of Ari
zona State with a 6-1, 6-3
victory. If both Barte and
Gibbs win tomorrow in the
Round of 16, they would
face each other in the quar
terfinals.
"You have to view it as a
positive," Gibbs said of po
tentially playing a team
mate. "It means you got re
ally far in the draw. I don't
see it as changing the way I
view my teammates' match
es though. I'll still be there
to cheer her on tomorrow,
and we're all still a support
system for each other."
Barte also won 6-3, 6-0
alongside Burdette in the
first round of doubles yes
terday. The fourth-seeded
pair will take on the winner
