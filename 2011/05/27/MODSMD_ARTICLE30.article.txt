The idea of sitting in a movie theater for a mod
ern, black and white, silent movie that isn't for
class and doesn't star Charlie Chaplin could
easily come off as daunting and overly pretentious.
"The Artist," however, avoids both those labels. It's a
silent breath of fresh air in a landscape of loud, grat
ing movies and a hilarious respite from unoriginal
comedies.
The film opens in 1927 at the height of famous
silent actor George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) career.
While he may not be the most sensitive person, he
certainly is the most charming, using his extremely
well-trained pet Jack Russell terrier to wow the crowds
and impress everyone. Through a chance encounter, a
trope that seems to happen only in the realm of old
Hollywood movies, George gives ingenue Peppy

Miller (Berenice Bejo) her big break. The two are
smitten with each other, but their love comes with a
hitch, namely George's wife. He's happily married and
has far too much honor to do anything. Two years
later, the fictitious but all-powerful Kinograph Film

Studio head (John
Goodman) cancels all
silent films. George, for

reasons of his own, refuses to

work in a world of talking cinema,
and the inexorable wave of modernity
sweeps him by.
With each moment, "The Artist"
establishes itself as one of the smartest
films out there. It's made by expert
parody director Michel Hazanavicius,
famous for French spy films "OSS 117:
Cairo, Nest of Spies" and "OSS 117:
Lost in Rio." Here, he flexes his muscles
in a completely different genre,
approaching an antiquated idea with a
modern perspective. He plays upon
audience expectations of sound, creat
ing tension and breaking it with


incredible pacing.
The two leads, both famous in
their own right in France, are relative
ly new to American audiences but
destined for stateside stardom.
Dujardin, who won best actor for this
role at Cannes, is bursting with
charisma, from the comedy with his
dog to his Cary Grant tap dancing to

even his comically thin mustache. He
captures your heart, and you can't
help but sympathize, as he becomes a
forgotten memory in an ever-chang
ing world. Bejo shows off her own
tap talents and makes you believe the
turn from unknown nobody to radi
ant star all in a few scenes.
However, the award for best in
show, pun certainly intended, goes to
Uggy the dog. Not since Shadow from
"Homeward Bound" has there been a
dog so instantly loveable, and not
since Dug from "Up" has there been a
canine with such biting comedic wit,
and not since Lassie has there been a
dog so capably heroic. This pooch will
leave you begging for more.
Since "The Artist" is about the
relentless push toward modernity

and the gems that get lost in its wake,
it makes a really interesting reflexive
statement as well. Here is a film that
is so successful in using a past medi
um that it makes the audience feel a
bit of nostalgia or at least a reverence
for a long-forgotten art. Compared to
the latest 3-D sequel and its various
explosions and trendy rock sound
tracks, "The Artist" will seem pretty
out of place, but it's so pristine in its
presentation that it's impossible to
resist. Expect to see "The Artist" in
theaters come awards season. It'll cer
tainly get people talking, even if its
characters stay silent.
