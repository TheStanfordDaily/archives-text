## ROXY SASS Roxy Sass tries playing for the other team 
### 
It's simple logic: Roxy, being as
attractive (and as attracted to
others) as she is, has come to
an obvious conclusion. In order to
find and frolic with someone of an
equally Roxy-high caliber, an
extensive search must take place.
Why limit the candidates to just
one gender?

with someone at a party, she
thinks the likelihood of cheering
increases tenfold when it's with

another girl.
The choice, however, isn't that
clear. Lickin' Lass warns that when
two girls date, it means the time of
the month becomes the time of
the fortnight. And as much as
Roxy pretends her hormones don't
control her, let's be real. For those
at the mercy of monthly mood

In the end, Roxy's gonna leave
the lickin' to her sidekick. When
Roxy realized that dating girls
meant that two of her exes would
probably end up dating each other
someday, the fear of the awkward
love triangle was a little too much

just sharing a bed. Roxy looks
great in sweatpants, but when she
decides to get all fancy, she enjoys
having access to all the clothes in
another girl's wardrobe. Lickin'
Lass points out that having a lady
lover is also handy for sharing jew
elry (you don't have to be the
same size!), and a distinct lack of

economic sense.

Secondly, in a dorm setting,
sexiling isn't always an option, and
hookups are sometimes relegated
to a dorm bathroom or shower
for ladies only. Roxy has been
through many an awkward

encounter on the way in or out of
the shower with a boytoy in tow,
and the idea of waltzing in with
out hesitation is an intriguing one.
Plus, to be honest, Roxy's a bit of
an attention whore: while people
do occasionally burst into
