# CARD ROLLS TIDE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Alabama's Softball team
earned the second seed in the
NCAA Tournament on the
back of an impressive 49-8
record, going 19-6 in the
Southeastern Conference
(SEC). It was a perfect 23-0 at
home, including three easy
victories last weekend in the
NCAA Regional. All of that
went out the window Thurs
day, when the 15th-seeded
Stanford Softball team
stunned the Crimson Tide
with a 5-2 victory in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.

"It was a great win," said
Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "We told our team
that we knew it was going to
be a tough environment to
play. They have great fans
here and a very good Alaba
ma team. We just needed to
play the way we are capable

of playing, and we did that
tonight. We played relaxed
and under control."

The Cardinal (42-15,10-11
Pac-10) took advantage of a
trio of Alabama errors and
got a huge pitching perform
ance from sophomore Teagan
Gerhart, who went the dis
tance, allowing two runs on
five hits while striking out
eight.

Stanford got things going
early, taking advantage of un
characteristic wildness from
Alabama ace Kelsi Dunne
the three-time All-American
had walked just 63 batters in
204 innings this year but
handed out free passes to sen
ior first baseman Melisa

NOTES ! Led by ace pitcher Teagan Gerhart, the
No. 15 seed Cardinal upset second-seeded Al
abama on the road at the NCAA Super Re
gional, 5-0. Junior outfielder Sarah Hassman
drove in two runs and junior shortstop Ashley
Hansen banged out two more hits to raise her
batting average to .505 as Stanford pushed the
Crimson Tide to the brink of elimination in the
best-of-three series. One more win would send
the Cardinal to its first Women's College World
Series since 2004.

The Stanford softball team surprised host Alabama in the opening game of the
NCAA Super Regional, knocking off the No. 2 seed in decisive fashion, 5-2.
Freshman designated player Danielle Miller (above) scored the game's first run.

Koutz and junior third baseman
Jenna Becerra in the second inning.
Both came around to score in the in
ning as the Cardinal jumped out on
top, 3-0.

Junior outfielder Sarah Hass
man did the bulk of the damage, lac
ing a single to right field that scored
two. But perhaps the most impor
tant sequence happened in the bot
tom of the inning, after Stanford had
taken the lead. Gerhart had to wait
a long time in between innings and
hit the first batter in the bottom of
the second. The home crowd at
Rhoads Stadium sensed an oppor
tunity to get what has been a high
octane offense into gear.
But Gerhart stayed within her
self. She got ahead of Alabama's hit
ters and induced a simple ground
ball and a fly out before snuffing the
rally entirely with a ground out to
Becerra.

"We had timely hitting, great de
fense and great pitching, which was
key tonight," Rittman said. "Teagan
[Gerhart] was outstanding. She's
been hitting her spots and getting
ahead of hitters, and as a pitcher
that's the name of the game. We got
a great defense behind her, and
when she does get behind, she's not
afraid to let her defense go to work."
The younger sister of former
Stanford football star Toby, Teagan
Gerhart got some breathing room
in the top of the third when Alaba
ma made several mistakes in the
field. Freshman designated player
Danielle Miller reached on an error
by Crimson Tide third baseman
Courtney Conley, and then Koutz
laid down a nice bunt that Conley
couldn't handle cleanly for a single.
A sacrifice bunt by junior out-

fielder Maya Burns put runners at
second and third with just one out,
bringing Becerra to the plate. The
Camarillo, Calif, native lofted a fly
ball to left field that Kayla Braud
misplayed badly for her first error of
the season. Both runs scored, and al
though Becerra was thrown out try
ing to advance to third base, the
damage was done.
Working with her twin sister
Kelsey behind the plate, Teagan
Gerhart settled in and didn't allow a
hit until the fourth inning, when Al
abama senior Whitney Larsen hit
her 13th home run of the season, a
deep drive to left field.
Once again, it seemed like the
Tide might be able to make a move,
but Gerhart sent the next two bat
ters down with ease and struck out
the side in the fifth inning. She
stranded two runners at second and
third base with just one out again in
the sixth, and she ran into a bit of
trouble in the seventh when she
gave up a run-scoring double that
cut the lead to two.
Gerhart had reached the 100-
pitch plateau by this point, but had
no more trouble as she closed out
her 29th complete game and moved
to 26-11 on the season.
Junior shortstop Ashley Hansen

added to her astronomically high
batting average, which now stands
at .505, with two more hits. And
while the Cardinal struck out ten
times as a team, it scratched out just
enough to push Alabama to the
brink in the best-of-three elimina
tion series.
"Heading into the game, our
focus was on not getting too anxious
and treating this like any other
game," said sophomore second
baseman Jenna Rich.
The team appeared to do just
that on Thursday, but after the game
harped on the importance of staying
grounded.
"There's still a lot of ball to be
played and we need to come ready
tomorrow expecting them to have a
lot energy," Rich said. "We can't let
down at any point."
Despite a loss in the semifinals of
the SEC Tournament, the Crimson
Tide was one of the favorites to
make its seventh Women's College
World Series, but Stanford is in the
driver's seat needing to win just one
of the next two games to advance to
the eight-team World Series field
for the first time since 2004.
Super Regional action continues
today at 1:30 p.m. PST, when the
Cardinal and Crimson Tide go back
at it in Tuscaloosa.
