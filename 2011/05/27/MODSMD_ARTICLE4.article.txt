# CARD ROLLS TIDE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH DESK EDITOR 
Alabama's Softball team
earned the second seed in the
NCAA Tournament on the
back of an impressive 49-8
record, going 19-6 in the
Southeastern Conference
(SEC). It was a perfect 23-0 at
home, including three easy
victories last weekend in the
NCAA Regional. All of that
went out the window Thurs
day, when the 15th-seeded
Stanford Softball team
stunned the Crimson Tide
with a 5-2 victory in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.

"It was a great win," said
Stanford head coach John
Rittman. "We told our team
that we knew it was going to
be a tough environment to
play. They have great fans
here and a very good Alaba
ma team. We just needed to
play the way we are capable

of playing, and we did that
tonight. We played relaxed
and under control."

The Cardinal (42-15,10-11
Pac-10) took advantage of a
trio of Alabama errors and
got a huge pitching perform
ance from sophomore Teagan
Gerhart, who went the dis
tance, allowing two runs on
five hits while striking out
eight.

Stanford got things going
early, taking advantage of un
characteristic wildness from
Alabama ace Kelsi Dunne
the three-time All-American
had walked just 63 batters in
204 innings this year but
handed out free passes to sen
ior first baseman Melisa
