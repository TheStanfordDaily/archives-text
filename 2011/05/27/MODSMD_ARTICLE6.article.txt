## UNIVERSITY Faculty Senate focuses on faculty composition Etchemendy presents next year's budget 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Faculty composition and the
2011-12 University budget plan
were the focal points of the May 26
meeting of the Faculty Senate.
The Senate began the session by
addressing professorial gains, loss
es and composition. Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. *B2 then high
lighted key points of the Consoli
dated Budget for Operations and
the Capital Budget for the upcom
ing year.
Commitment to faculty diversity
Karen Cook, vice provost for
faculty development and diversity,
introduced the "Report on the Fac
ulty." She underscored a continued
"commitment to faculty diversity"
before embarking on a discussion
of faculty composition by gender,
race and ethnicity.
According to Cook, the number
of Stanford faculty dropped from
1,908 to 1,900 last year a conse
quence of 96 hires and 104 depar
tures, 66 of which were retirements,
likely due to enhanced Faculty Re
tirement Incentive Program
(FRIP). There were 65 departures
in the preceding year.
Women continue to rise in num
ber across the ranks of most pro
fessorships. In 2010, they made up
20.7 percent of full professors, 35.7
percent of assistant professors, 30.4
percent of associate professors and
41.7 percent of senior and center
fellows.
"University-wide, women are
now 26.3 percent of the faculty,"
Cook said.
Thursday's meeting also con
centrated on the stunted progress
in the hiring of underrepresented
minority (URM) faculty. Cook said
there has been no increase in the
proportion of URM faculty in the
past 10 years, especially since
turnover has offset the impact of
proactive hiring.
Stanford is home to 116 tradi
tional URM faculty members, who
represent 6.1 percent of the entire
faculty. Among this group, 2.6 per
cent are black/African American,
3.4 percent are Hispanic/Latino
and 0.16 percent are Native Amer
ican/Alaskan Native. Cook main
tained that the task at hand is to
"figure out what we can do to move
the bar on diversity higher."
According to history professor
Albert Camarillo, the current Fac
ulty Development Initiative (FDI)
borrows from it predecessor, the
"faculty affirmative action pro
gram." He stressed a continued
need for proactive leaders and co
operation in this effort. Camarillo
also underlined the need for "quick
responses to counteroffers" from
competing institutions of higher
learning.
"We are into the fourth year of
the FDI," Camarillo said. "We've
had some remarkable successes."
All things considered, he noted

that Stanford is "on track" to reach
its goal of hiring 10 URM col
leagues by the end of the fifth year
ofFDI.
Classics professor Richard
Sailer agreed that the faculty de
velopment initiative has been a
critical component in the endeavor
to enhance diversity. Fie stressed
the importance of "adding more
graduate students of color" since
the University "disproportionate
ly" hires back its own graduate stu
dents in the long run.
Sailer further noted that biggest

hurdle to faculty hires involves
partner issues. He said Stanford
sometimes loses faculty in cases
where a couple receives an offer,
but "one or the other of the part
ners was offered a faculty position
that was less ideal."
Dean Deborah Stipek spoke
about the successes of the School
of Education in encouraging facul
ty diversity.
"Whatever strategies are avail
able, it is very clear to me that it has
be part of the culture of the depart
ment or the school," Stipek said.
University budget plan
"This year the budget is a very
boring budget," Etchemendy said.
He noted that this fact bespoke
of the improved state of University
finances.
The budget plan consists of the
Consolidated Budget for Opera
tions and the Capital Budget,
which is one component of the
three-year Capital Plan. The Con
solidated Budget encompasses all
of the University's expected oper
ating revenue and expenditures,
and it is expected to see a surplus of
$203 million next year.
Etchemendy predicts $4.1 billion
in revenues, $3.8 billion in expendi

"This year the
budget is a very
boring budget...
The main

gathering cloud
on the horizon is
the federal
research budget."

tures and $lO4 million in transfers.
The Capital Budget includes
capital projects such as the Bing
Concert Hall, the Jill and John
Freidenrich Center for Transla
tional Research, the West Campus
Recreation Center and the Bio
engineering/Chemical Engineer
ing Building. That budget esti
mates $456 million in expenditures
for the following year.
While Stanford finances have
improved, "the recovery is not
complete," Etchemendy cau
tioned.
"This endowment payout here
is 12 percent below what we were
three years ago at the peak," he
said.
At the same time, tuition and
room and board income is project
ed to increase by 4.2 percent.
Etchemendy noted that the fi
nancial crisis led to two adverse ef
fects: a drop in the endowment and

increased financial stress felt by
students' families. The President's
Fund and The Stanford Fund filled
the financial hole left by this "dou
ble whammy" effect, he said. But
such a solution cannot continue in
definitely.
The provost said Stanford aims
to fill that financial hole by raising
additional endowment and build
ing an equal portion into the gen
eral fund. Remaining financial
gaps would be covered by money
from The Stanford Fund.
With financial aid under con
trol, the future of sponsored re
search might present the greatest
challenge in the coming year.
"The main gathering cloud on
the horizon is the federal research
budget," Etchemendy said.
In the last couple of years, spon
sored research increased thanks to
the American Recovery and Rein
vestment Act (ARRA), which pro
vided stimulus funding for re
search. This ARRA funding will
essentially disappear by 2012.
It is anticipated that total spon
sored research will fall by 1.7 per
cent next year, a figure that may

change once the federal budget is
determined. But the future may
not be as dire as these numbers
suggest.

"Historically, Stanford's share
of the federal research budget has
tended to increase in tight times,"
Etchemendy said.
While the federal budget may
remain flat in the coming years,
Stanford could receive a larger
portion of this money, thereby off
setting predicted falls in federal
funding.
Etchemendy also spoke at
length about incremental general
funds allocation, announcing that
undergraduate overseas seminars
would be reinstated in the future.
These seminars were "the number
one request from students" for re
instatement among programs that
had been cut, he said.
He discussed lessons learned in
previous years and defended the
University's decision to consoli
date cuts in one year rather than
spreading the cut over five years.
