### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Faculty composition and the
2011-12 University budget plan
were the focal points of the May 26
meeting of the Faculty Senate.
The Senate began the session by
addressing professorial gains, loss
es and composition. Provost John
Etchemendy Ph.D. *B2 then high
lighted key points of the Consoli
dated Budget for Operations and
the Capital Budget for the upcom
ing year.
Commitment to faculty diversity
Karen Cook, vice provost for
faculty development and diversity,
introduced the "Report on the Fac
ulty." She underscored a continued
"commitment to faculty diversity"
before embarking on a discussion
of faculty composition by gender,
race and ethnicity.
According to Cook, the number
of Stanford faculty dropped from
1,908 to 1,900 last year a conse
quence of 96 hires and 104 depar
tures, 66 of which were retirements,
likely due to enhanced Faculty Re
tirement Incentive Program
(FRIP). There were 65 departures
in the preceding year.
Women continue to rise in num
ber across the ranks of most pro
fessorships. In 2010, they made up
20.7 percent of full professors, 35.7
percent of assistant professors, 30.4
percent of associate professors and
41.7 percent of senior and center
fellows.
"University-wide, women are
now 26.3 percent of the faculty,"
Cook said.
Thursday's meeting also con
centrated on the stunted progress
in the hiring of underrepresented
minority (URM) faculty. Cook said
there has been no increase in the
proportion of URM faculty in the
past 10 years, especially since
turnover has offset the impact of
proactive hiring.
Stanford is home to 116 tradi
tional URM faculty members, who
represent 6.1 percent of the entire
faculty. Among this group, 2.6 per
cent are black/African American,
3.4 percent are Hispanic/Latino
and 0.16 percent are Native Amer
ican/Alaskan Native. Cook main
tained that the task at hand is to
"figure out what we can do to move
the bar on diversity higher."
According to history professor
Albert Camarillo, the current Fac
ulty Development Initiative (FDI)
borrows from it predecessor, the
"faculty affirmative action pro
gram." He stressed a continued
need for proactive leaders and co
operation in this effort. Camarillo
also underlined the need for "quick
responses to counteroffers" from
competing institutions of higher
learning.
"We are into the fourth year of
the FDI," Camarillo said. "We've
had some remarkable successes."
All things considered, he noted

that Stanford is "on track" to reach
its goal of hiring 10 URM col
leagues by the end of the fifth year
ofFDI.
Classics professor Richard
Sailer agreed that the faculty de
velopment initiative has been a
critical component in the endeavor
to enhance diversity. Fie stressed
the importance of "adding more
graduate students of color" since
the University "disproportionate
ly" hires back its own graduate stu
dents in the long run.
Sailer further noted that biggest

hurdle to faculty hires involves
partner issues. He said Stanford
sometimes loses faculty in cases
where a couple receives an offer,
but "one or the other of the part
ners was offered a faculty position
that was less ideal."
Dean Deborah Stipek spoke
about the successes of the School
of Education in encouraging facul
ty diversity.
"Whatever strategies are avail
able, it is very clear to me that it has
be part of the culture of the depart
ment or the school," Stipek said.
University budget plan
"This year the budget is a very
boring budget," Etchemendy said.
He noted that this fact bespoke
of the improved state of University
finances.
The budget plan consists of the
Consolidated Budget for Opera
tions and the Capital Budget,
which is one component of the
three-year Capital Plan. The Con
solidated Budget encompasses all
of the University's expected oper
ating revenue and expenditures,
and it is expected to see a surplus of
$203 million next year.
Etchemendy predicts $4.1 billion
in revenues, $3.8 billion in expendi

"This year the
budget is a very
boring budget...
The main

gathering cloud
on the horizon is
the federal
research budget."
