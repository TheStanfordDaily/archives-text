## EDITORIAL School of Medicine Deserves Praise 
### 
In December, non-profit media
outlet ProPublica published in
formation about a dozen Stan
ford School of Medicine faculty
members who had accepted pay
ments from pharmaceutical com
panies, mostly in exchange for the
faculty members giving promotion
al talks on behalf of the pharmaceu
tical companies. Accepting these
payments violates the Stanford In
dustry Interactions Policy (SUP)
enacted in 2006, which prohibits
faculty involved with education
from accepting gifts from industry.
Faculty members whose interac
tions are research-oriented are not
covered under SUP. Accepting the
payments is also a direct violation
of a policy created in 2009 banning
faculty from giving paid promotion
al speeches for pharmaceutical
companies. As a result, the choice of
the faculty to take the payments
was both dishonest and wrong, as
they have recognized.

The reasoning behind the
school policies is clear: taking
money from pharmaceutical com
panies creates conflicts of interest
in an area that should be based on
the best interests of science, and of
patients, not the incomes of doctors
or companies. Doctors maintaining
these kinds of relationships with
pharmaceutical companies easily
could be inclined to unduly favor
the company's brand-name drug
instead of alternatives when deal
ing with patients.

relationships with industry that
jeopardize the integrity of the med
ical community. It is important,
however, to constantly evaluate
policies and actions in order to
keep the best interests of patients
and society as the primary concern.
Stanford is a global leader in
biomedical innovation, and as such
the University must hold its faculty,
across all disciplines, to a high stan
dard. The School of Medicine is as
tute to recognize that long-term
success depends on the unassail
able credibility of scientific re
search. Keeping medical professors
unaffiliated with corporate inter
ests plays a key role in assuring that
ethical concerns do not compro
mise the scientific process.

After five months, the School of
Medicine has taken disciplinary ac
tion against five faculty members
for these policy violations. Follow
ing a preliminary investigation in
December, School of Medicine
Dean Philip Pizzo stated that some
of the accused faculty members
had understandable confusion re
garding Stanford's policies, while
others' explanations were hard to
reconcile with the policies. While
the fact that seven of the 12 indis
cretions were apparently due to
confusion speaks well of the inten
tions of the faculty members, this
editorial board hopes that follow
ing this investigation, the School of
Medicine will take steps to clarify
its policies in order to maintain the
integrity of the institution and its
faculty members.

We believe that these violations
jeopardize the reputation of the
University, and thus are pleased
that the School of Medicine is tak
ing disciplinary action. We can only
hope that their actions will fit the
severity of these violations. While
the Medical School has not re
leased details of the disciplinary ac
tion, we encourage them to do so as
a means of discouraging future vio
lations. Our hope is that this can
stand as an example of how seri
ously Stanford University regards
its reputation as a leading research
university of the highest academic
and ethical standard.

We would also like to praise the
Medical School for enforcing ethics
rules. We recognize that there is a
fine line between cooperation with
industry that benefits society and
