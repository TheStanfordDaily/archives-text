## No Need for Suites Contractor 
### 
Stanford Residential Education
says its mission is to "extend
the classroom into the resi
dences and complement the aca
demic curriculum with activities
and experiences essential to stu
dents' preparation for a life of lead
ership, intellectual engagement, cit
izenship and service." As residents
of Suites this year and members of
the Suites Dining Societies, we have
been beneficiaries of this ideal in
action. The Dining Societies have
run smoothly for almost 28 years
under the management of GovCo
Dining, a non-profit student run
corporation. It produces better
food and provides more responsive
management than we received from
Stanford Dining or in the Row
houses, and at a lower price. Unfor
tunately, it seems that ResEd has
been working to replace this system
with a third party contractor (as ex
plained in The Daily's May 20 arti
cle, "Contractor to manage GovCo
eating clubs") for reasons not ade
quately explained.
That contractor is Student Orga

nized Services (the irony seems lost
on ResEd), the same company that
has taken control at the Toyon Eat
ing Clubs and many Row House
kitchens. There, they have eliminat
ed student management, reduced
the quality of the chefs, eliminated
student hashing and taken their cut
for "contracting services."
The manner in which ResEd has
foisted these changes on students is
deeply troubling. The decision to
give the contract to SOS seems to
have been made long before ResEd
consulted any students or even the
current managers of GovCo Din
ing. What started as a request to
audit the finances of GovCo Dining
(a request with which student man
agers complied) seems to have actu
ally been the first phase of the in
tended takeover.
This whole affair seems to be
more than just an eager bureaucra
cy expanding its remit. Zac
Sergeant, the liaison from the
ResEd office to our student man
agers, is the former CEO of SEC,
the company from which SOS
eventually branched off. His broth
er-in-law Nick Peters is the current
CFO and founder of SOS. Dean of
ResEd Deborah Golder initially
denied that any conflict of interest
exists. When presented with ir
refutable evidence, ResEd back
tracked and its Director of Opera
tions Aaron Buzay insisted that all
potential conflicts of interest "have
been addressed," but we have seen
no documentation of any such ac
tion , and the website connecting
Sergeant to SEC was taken down
last week.

The transition has been sloppy.
Hashers went unpaid for months
when ResEd took over responsibil
ity for their payment. Worse yet,
our excellent chefs are set to lose
their health benefits this summer,
as their contracts have not been re

newed. If the new management
ever does get around to those con
tracts, it looks increasingly likely
that they will force pay or benefit
cuts.

We hope RedEd recognizes that
this affair represents a direct con
tradiction of their stated mission.
The job of Stanford University is to
educate. Education is not merely
classes, essays and problem sets. It
also means working with other stu
dents to publish newspapers, run
local government, and yes, feed
ourselves. At best, ResEd is trying
to protect us from ourselves. But
why? The Suites eating clubs are an
excellent example of what ResEd
ought to be promoting. The high
quality of the food has been a con
tinual source of pleasure for us, and
it would be foolish to risk depriving
future Suites residents of the expe
rience we have had. Just let them
be.
