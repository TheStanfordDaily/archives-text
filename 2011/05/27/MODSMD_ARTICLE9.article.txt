# MARKS MY WORDS
## TV Show-offs 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
It was a warm, lazy afternoon,
and the BBQ was going splen
didly. We joked about the
strange antics of our parents, and
then one person blurted out, "My
mom is really good at dressing up
like Dwight!" Bursts of laughter en
sued, and I joined along even as I
groaned inwardly. I knew what
would happen next. I reached for a
pita chip, took a hefty dollop of
hummus and leaned back in my
chair, physically removing myself
from the conversation. It happened.
And it lasted for a good ten minutes.
"The best episode is the one
where ..." "Are you crazy? It's
definitely the one when ..." "I
mean, that one was funny, but the
one right before that..." A dozen
episodes later, and after some pret
ty poor imitations of Dwight him
self, conversation trailed off.
For those of you who don't know,
Dwight is a character in "The Of

fice," a pretty popular television
show. And that was all I knew at the
time because I don't watch "The Of
fice" (gasp, I know). As a result, I
can't contribute to a discussion of the
best episode of "The Office" or talk
about my favorite character or gos
sip about the latest plot twist. Usual
ly this isn't a problem, but when con
versations take a turn towards "The
Office," I feel the tremendous pangs
of social isolation as I sit and wait for
a change of topic.
I always wonder if I should fake
it. Should I laugh along with every
one else? Should I loudly agree with
an, "Oh em gees, yeah, that episode
was so funny!" Or is it better if I sit
in silence until someone notices and
asks me incredulously, "Wait. You
don't watch 'The Office?!"' When I
quietly murmur, "No," I feel like I'm
admitting to murder. In response, I
usually get a look of pity, as if the
person wants to console me for the

tragedy that must be my life without
"The Office."

Luckily, these conversations
can't go on forever. In this particular
scenario, the conversation soon
began to wind down. In preparation
for my recovery, I sat up in my chair,
ready to reenter the fray. But the
conversation was suddenly revived
by an allusion to "30 Rock," another
TV show. I slumped back again with
a new pita chip in hand. I know that
Tina Fey is in "30 Rock," and I know
I like Tina Fey. That's all I know.
It's happened to me before and
probably to a lot of other people
suddenly everyone around you is
talking about some TV show that
you don't watch. I once sat patient
ly with just two of my friends as I lis

tened to them talk about the finer
points of "It's Always Sunny in
Philadelphia" for quite literally 15
minutes before they figured out
that I looked bored. It's happened
to me with "Modern Family." And
"Glee." "And How I Met Your
Mother."

You're probably thinking,
"Wow, it sounds like you should just
go watch TV." And maybe at this
point in time, that's true. These
days, television is probably the
thing we have most in common
after the weather. Remember how,
back in the day, people would jump
start their conversations with com
ments about the weather? Ah, the
good old weather: we're all in it,
we're all watching it and feeling it,
enjoying it or hating it together.
And that brings up a pretty gen
eral point as social creatures, we
like commonalities. We like meet
ing people and quickly identifying
shared interests, opinions and pref
erences. That's why we stay away
from topics like religion and poli
tics. Do you meet someone and
promptly announce your thoughts
on abortion? Probably not.
Rather, it makes more sense to
meet someone and comment off
handedly on that last episode of
"The Office." You'll both think it's
funny, you'll bond over your shared
interest and then you'll be lifelong
friends.

I've experienced that joy on rare
occasions. One time, a friend

loaned me the first two seasons of
"It's Always Sunny in Philadel
phia," promising that it was the fun
niest show he'd ever seen. It was de
cently funny, but nothing to make
me fall out of my chair or anything.
But you know what was better than
watching the show? A couple of
times, the show came up in conver
sation with other people. Those few
precious moments, in which I could
jump in enthusiastically with my fa
vorite episodes and characters and
plot twists, were pretty fun. No
more alienation, no more faking
knowledge of something in order to
impress other people. Those were
some glorious times.
An even more glorious conversa
tion, however, followed the previous
two at the BBQ. In fact, conversa
tion took the best turn I could've
hoped for someone brought up
my column! There it was: "The Of
fice," "30 Rock," and then "Marks
My Words." And there they were,
multiple people jumping in with
comments about different columns
of mine, feeling a sense of cama
raderie in their shared knowledge of
all those words I'd composed.
It was pretty cool for several
shining moments, "Marks My
Words" had attained some sem
blance of campus pop culture status.
And I certainly didn't feel very ex
cluded from the conversation. It was
all I could've hoped for in the past
few months of writing. Thank you,
readers, for making it happen.
