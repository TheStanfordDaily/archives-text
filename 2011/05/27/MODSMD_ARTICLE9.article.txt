## TV Show-offs 
### Miriam Ellora Marks 
It was a warm, lazy afternoon,
and the BBQ was going splen
didly. We joked about the
strange antics of our parents, and
then one person blurted out, "My
mom is really good at dressing up
like Dwight!" Bursts of laughter en
sued, and I joined along even as I
groaned inwardly. I knew what
would happen next. I reached for a
pita chip, took a hefty dollop of
hummus and leaned back in my
chair, physically removing myself
from the conversation. It happened.
And it lasted for a good ten minutes.
"The best episode is the one
where ..." "Are you crazy? It's
definitely the one when ..." "I
mean, that one was funny, but the
one right before that..." A dozen
episodes later, and after some pret
ty poor imitations of Dwight him
self, conversation trailed off.
For those of you who don't know,
Dwight is a character in "The Of

fice," a pretty popular television
show. And that was all I knew at the
time because I don't watch "The Of
fice" (gasp, I know). As a result, I
can't contribute to a discussion of the
best episode of "The Office" or talk
about my favorite character or gos
sip about the latest plot twist. Usual
ly this isn't a problem, but when con
versations take a turn towards "The
Office," I feel the tremendous pangs
of social isolation as I sit and wait for
a change of topic.
I always wonder if I should fake
it. Should I laugh along with every
one else? Should I loudly agree with
an, "Oh em gees, yeah, that episode
was so funny!" Or is it better if I sit
in silence until someone notices and
asks me incredulously, "Wait. You
don't watch 'The Office?!"' When I
quietly murmur, "No," I feel like I'm
admitting to murder. In response, I
usually get a look of pity, as if the
person wants to console me for the

tragedy that must be my life without
"The Office."

Luckily, these conversations
can't go on forever. In this particular
scenario, the conversation soon
began to wind down. In preparation
for my recovery, I sat up in my chair,
ready to reenter the fray. But the
conversation was suddenly revived
by an allusion to "30 Rock," another
TV show. I slumped back again with
a new pita chip in hand. I know that
Tina Fey is in "30 Rock," and I know
I like Tina Fey. That's all I know.
It's happened to me before and
probably to a lot of other people
suddenly everyone around you is
talking about some TV show that
you don't watch. I once sat patient
