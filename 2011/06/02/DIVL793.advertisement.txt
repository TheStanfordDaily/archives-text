Indulge your imagination with the
Creative Writing Program
The Stanford Creative Writing Program offers a variety of writing courses in fiction,
poetry and creative nonfiction. Our small class sizes help create a true workshop
environment. We also offer an opportunity to design an individual course of study
in poetry or prose with one of the recipients of our prestigious Stegner Fellowship.
We have many other opportunities for undergraduates, such as our Four-Minute
Reading Series featuring student work, and our Writers' Studio and Poet's House
which offer guidance and mentoring to undergraduates from practicing writers.
Guest authors for 2011-2012 include Mary Oliver, David Sedaris, Anne Patchett
and Martin Amis. Undergraduates will have the rare opportunity to take a course
from renowned poet Louise Gluck, the Mohr Visiting Poet during Winter 2011-
12, and best-selling author and M.D. Abraham Verghese, the Stein Visiting Writer
during Spring 2011-12.
