## Shaw discusses interview program 
### ELLORA ISRANI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The alumni interview program is
transitioning from its pilot stage to
become a permanent University fix
ture, a change that administrators
and alumni are calling a "positive de
velopment."
The Faculty Senate Committee
on Undergraduate Admission and
Financial Aid approved the program
in April, after they had initially des
ignated it as a pilot three years ago.
"We really didn't know, to be
honest, which way the faculty would
go on this," said Richard Shaw, dean
of Undergraduate Admission. "The
faculty, who really asked a lot of im
portant, pointed questions, ultimate
ly decided that they felt comfortable
with it and that they were willing to
get behind it."
The decision, largely based on 17
case studies written by alumni over
the past three years, saw one major
benefit to adding optional interviews
to the Stanford undergraduate ap
plication.
"They ultimately concurred that
an interview can add texture to an
applicant's file," he said. "The human
dynamic, meeting a person ... either
validates what you read in the file or
it adds to it."
One major concern raised, ac
cording to Shaw, was the availability
of "enough alumni nationally to be
able to meet the expectation of the
volume." He also mentioned "the
question of equity" as a key point, re
ferring the issues related to training
interviewers and ensuring that they
perform their tasks consistently.
According to Shaw, "the idea of
access do people have access to
the interviews themselves? and
the question of what might they add
to the applicant's candidacy" were
two other commonly cited concerns.
Steven Jewell '74, an alumni in
terviewer based in Portland, said it is
imperative to understand that the in
terviews are "not strictly evaluative"
meetings, but rather "conversations

with applicants."
"As an interviewer, I am trained
to view myself as an ambassador for
Stanford, not as a quasi-admissions
officer," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Many [applicants] have mis
conceptions about Stanford and the
college application process. Stanford
alumni are in a good position to help
applicants learn what Stanford can
offer them and to clarify misunder
standings."
Interviewers are trained exten
sively. Admissions officers conduct
90-minute training sessions during
their travels around the country and
local alumni officers conduct follow
up sessions. Each interviewer is also
given a reference handbook with
sample questions, which Jewell
called "comprehensive and excel
lent."
Among the pros of the program,
Jewell points to the financial benefit
that will be derived from interviews
through continued contact with the
wide alumni base.
"One third of Stanford's funding
comes from gifts, and tuition only
covers 60 percent of the cost of an
undergraduate education," he said.
"So, alumni giving is vital to making
a Stanford education affordable to
all undergraduates. Additionally, en
gaged alumni volunteer thousands
of hours of their time each year help
ing the University achieve its mis
sion."
Concerns that have been raised
about alumni interview programs in
clude the worry that students of
lower socioeconomic status will be
disadvantaged and that the lack of
consistency among interviewers
could bring unfair subjectivity.
Shaw deemed the first concern as
"stereotyping."
"Whether [applications] are low
income or first-generation or from a
rural area or whatever the case may
be, they already have a proven track
record, and they're quite capable of
talking about themselves and what's
important to them," he said. "It's our
responsibility as interviewers to
bring that out."
As for the second worry, Jewell
noted that the "talented and devot
ed alumni base" serves as "great am
bassadors for the University." Still,
the system is not perfect.
"Some interviewers will be more
effective than others," he said. "Con
tinued training and support will help
address this issue."
Shaw stressed that the interviews
are strictly optional; those who opt
against them will not be disadvan
taged during the admission process.
He noted the admission office's un
derstanding of the discrepancies in
applicant situations.
"Their schedules don't have
time, or they live in places where
they just cannot get to an interview
site, and so the thing to understand
here is that it's a piece of informa
tion that can be considered in the
file, but in no way does it penalize

the student if they choose not to
do," he said.
The pilot program included 12 in
terview locations, which Shaw says
were chosen because of the
"strength of the alumni presence in
those communities." The locations
were Atlanta, Denver, London,
Minneapolis/ St. Paul, New York
City, Philadelphia, Portland,
Raleigh/Durham, Washington D.C.,
Massachusetts and Virginia.
The official program proposes
seven new locations for the 2011-12
admission cycle: Chicago, Dallas,
Houston, Seattle, Singapore, Oregon
and Minnesota.
The permanent program is still in
its infancy and has a number of years
before its capacities meet the needs
of a constantly growing applicant
pool.
"Our intention here is to roll out
over a period of years; it's not all
going to happen at once," Shaw said.
"We need to build these things effec
tively, constructively, and build the
leadership around them as well as
the technology behind them."
