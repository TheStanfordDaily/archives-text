## POPULATION MATTERS Stanford debates forming a population-centric public health program 
### JULIA BROWNELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even without a formal school of
public health, numerous av
enues for public health related
research and study have
emerged at Stanford independ
ent of a formal structure. Driven by a
growing faculty and student interest, the
programs range from formal degrees to
pure research centers and even student
groups.
"It's an exciting time for population
sciences...
at Stanford, because there's a growing in
terest I think and a sense that in the fu
ture population sciences will grow, par
ticularly as the country grapples with cre
ating a new healthcare system," said
Philip Lavori, professor of biostatistics
and director of the Health Research and
Policy (HRP) department at the med
ical school.

Public health as a discipline

focuses on the science and practice
of improving and safeguarding the
health of communities, as opposed
to medicine, which focuses on indi-

viduals. Formally, it includes five disci-

plines: biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, health
services administration and social and behavioral sciences.
"They're all here, but they're scattered," said Donald Barr, professor of
human biology and pediatrics. "The students and faculty are interested in
subjects that affect the health of the public."
Yet Stanford has never made a formal move to create a school of public
health.
"A school of public health ordinarily encompasses subject matter not in
cluded within a school of medicine, and [Stanford's] goal is not to develop a
school of public health," said Victor Henderson, chief of the division of epi
demiology. "At Stanford, we're particularly interested in gaining knowledge
related to disease risk, treatment and prevention. Public health has an added
focus on training professionals who implement knowledge of disease pre
vention."
Barr added that at one point there was some interest in such a program,
describing serving on a committee years ago about making a program in
public health at Stanford.

"It just never coalesced," he said.
Although Stanford may still not be
looking to create a formal program in
public health, there has been movement
to combine many of the existing public
health related entities on campus. Facul
ty members from the school of medicine
have engaged in discussions about the
future of "population sciences" at Stan
ford.
"The question that we have is that,
since its quite easy to collaborate at Stan
ford ... what's the value of us trying to
figure out how to come together more in
timately?," Lavori said of forming a larg
er population sciences initiative.
A focus on population health sciences
is new for the Farm, which is traditional
ly more focused on biomedical research.
"Since the 60s, Stanford's medical
school has been built around biomedical
research," Barr said. "It's done very well,
but it has never had public health as a
core mission."
Lavori thinks that may be changing.
"Part of it is a natural turning from
things that have reached a great stage of
maturity, for example stem cell research.
They've got a building, wonderful grants,
CIRM has been terrific, the cancer cen
ter is doing well," he said. "There's also
now a critical mass of faculty at the
school who are interested in population
sciences ... It's time for us to think
about it's future here at Stanford."

The existing parts at Stanford include a number of degree granting pro
grams, research centers and student groups.
The only explicit public health related degrees at Stanford can be earned
in the Health Research and Policy (HRP) department within the Stanford
medical school. The department offers masters of science degrees in epi
demiology, biostatistics and health services research.
Henderson said that the masters programs, especially epidemiology, dif
fer from those in a formal public health school, taking a more clinical focus
to research and teaching.
Medical students early in their training can also pursue studies in public
health through two of the required scholarly concentrations, similar to ma
jors, offered on top of the traditional medical curriculum. The concentra
tions in community health and health services and policy research relate
most directly to those interested in population and community medicine.
"For a lot of our med students, the reason they go into medicine is be
cause they really want to make a difference for people who are dispropor
tionately suffering," said Lisa Chamberlain, director of the community
health scholarly concentration, adding that students can pursue this interest
through their concentration.
In addition to required and elective classes, students have the opportuni
ty to further their study through a research project, often community based,
sponsored by the medical scholars program. They can also pursue a master's
in public health across the bay at UC-Berkeley.
At the undergraduate level, many students study public health within ex
isting majors, most commonly through areas of concentration within human
biology.

"It's done very
well, but it has
never had public
health as a core
mission."
