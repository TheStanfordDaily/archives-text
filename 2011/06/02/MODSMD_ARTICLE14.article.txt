# Q&A WITH SALSA
## A 						look at three freshmen's new social networking company 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Felipe Munera 'l4 speaks about Salsa, a social
networking startup he recently co-founded with
Luke Knepper 'l4 and Bryant Tan 'l4.
Munera and Knepper officially launched
Salsa last week during a Wi-Fi enabled flight
from San Francisco to New York on their way to
the technology startup conference Tech Crunch
Disrupt NYC 2011. Tlie two debugged the site
on a laptop during their cab ride to the confer
ence, where they arrived with three hours of
sleep, 12 cups of coffee and plenty of enthusiasm.
Salsa's first product is use Salsa, a site where
users can make plans to hang out with friends by
linking their Salsa and Facebook accounts.
Users can share what they are interested in
doing and find friends who are free.
Business Insider described Munera, Salsa
CEO, as a "Colombian Justin Bieber." And
when The Stanford Daily interviewed Munera
about the new startup in his Twain dorm room,
his hair was just as long.
Why did you choose to start Salsa?
Personally I wanted to start a company long
ago. It was the reason I came to Stanford. It was
the only place where I could be this creative ...
Luke [Knepper] and I created this prototype
called Blue Bounce, but we needed something
more ... something that really disrupted the
normal way of thinking about social networking
... and that's where Salsa came from.
What does Salsa do?
We connect people to map social interaction the
way it's supposed to be, or the way it actually is
... Humans are happy when they hang out with
people they like, and in away, we're making the
world a happier place. This is much more than
one little webpage we're coding in college. This
is our dream. It's something big.

How did you end up going to Tech Crunch Dis
rupt?

I was browsing Tech Crunch, which I browse
two, three times a day, and thought about how
awesome it would be to go to Disrupt. If

there's something Stanford has taught me, it's
to always challenge your assumptions, and I
thought, why don't we go? We didn't really
have a finished product. We didn't have any
thing. We just had too much passion, and we
said, 'Let's go.'
What did you take away from the conference?
When we went to Disrupt, that really changed
everything. Disrupt is a very big event. It's
about companies that have something that's
going to disrupt the way people think about
technology. The requirement was for you to
have less than something like $2 million in
funding, and we had way, way less than that..
. We wanted to represent our university, and
the fact that we went there [to Tech Crunch
Disrupt] proved something.
What differentiates the idea behind Salsa from
other group-centered applications, like Face
book groups?
Salsa is dynamic. Other groups target messages
to the members of the group, and the perception
of who is in the group differs from person to per
son, which translates to lost social value. On
Salsa you can target different groups for differ
ent activities, and we set it up for you. Salsa is a
social dance and it also relates to food ... and
the main activities we help set up are "eat" or
"do something." Salsa is simple. It's very dynam
ic and it moves.
Why do you feel so confident in Salsa?
We're going to succeed, because our team is well
structured ... We're selling the impact we want
to create with Salsa as the mediator between
technology and social interaction. I'm con
vinced we can do it.
Is the hair really an homage to Justin Bieber?

I didn't have time to cut my hair. It was just so
much work, and we were rushing; I need a hair
cut.
