# HONING IN ON THE HUMANITIES
## 
### ARMINE PILIKIAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When fast paced quarters with a
whirlwind of midterms and
profoundly caffeinated essay
writing are the order of
things, following through with
sustained humanities research can seem like a
daunting task.
So, how does one escape the curse of the
cursory? The Stanford Humanities Center
(SHC) is one answer. A reclusive but beautiful
study area with a courtyard of whimsical plant
life and gurgling fountains, the Center is an
often-overlooked intellectual haven that sup
ports undergraduates pursuing research.
Stocked with visiting and on-campus pro
fessors, international artists, graduate students,
undergraduate researchers and last but not
least, luncheons, where students and academics
can converse over Indian food and brownie
squares, the Center is a bonding site for those
who want to engage deeply in research ques
tions.
Four undergraduate students, each paired
with one of the Center's fellows, spend an en
tire year at the Center developing a single
topic. Fellows are academic giants in a diverse
range of specialized fields, selected from a pool
of nearly 250 applicants annually. Although
their academic prestige might seem intimidat
ing, they give the students who work with them
the chance to travel deep into the complexities
of an intellectual arena, look at a concept
squarely in the face and decide if it needs some
reconstructive surgery.
Students usually tackle one aspect of their
fellow's research and are paid approximately
$1,400 per quarter for 10 hours of work per
week. To conclude the experience, the students
present their work during one of the Center's
weekly show-off-your-research lunches. These
presentations took place this year at a sympo
sium at the Center on May 25.
Undergraduates often reap the benefits of

their fellows' academic connections and exten
sive access to research facilities on campus. For
example, Harley Adams 'll, who is studying
colonial archives of the Indian Ocean with fel
low Giorgio Riello, has been working on a
quantitative spreadsheet of every factory in the
Indian Ocean from 1500 to 1800. Under Riel
lo's tutelage, he was able to work with the Spa
tial History Lab to digitally render this infor
mation on an interactive map, showing geo
graphic and chronological changes.
"What's interesting is that this information
has never been collected in such away before,
centered in one place," Adams said, describing
the approach as a new way to consider a place's
history. "Through just looking at the Indian
Ocean, you can see the entire world."
This project provides students with an ex
tensive research opportunity without having to
commit to completing an honors thesis.
"I ended up not doing an honors thesis, be
cause I'm double majoring, so this is my way of
doing a mini thesis," said Richard Sajor 'll,
who is currently researching the perception of
death in Medieval London with fellow Amy
Appleford.
For Sajor, the chance to explore his topic at
the Center helped satisfy his intellectual cu
riosity in away that classes could not.
"I'm somebody who has taken all the Me
dieval courses that I could ... this filled in a lot
of places where I felt like there weren't enough
classes," Sajor said.
Similarly, for Elizabeth Rasmussen *l2, the
Center was an academic jackpot for her inter
est in political trends in Peru. Rasmussen
worked with fellow Cecilia Mendez to investi
gate civil wars in 19th century Peru, which she
said she would have been unable to explore
through traditional coursework.
Having exhausted Stanford's language
courses, Rasmussen found an opportunity to
advance her language skills at the Center by
completing her reading, writing and conversa-
tions with Mendez in Spanish.
Although some students come
to the Center with highly specific
research interests, many find a
niche through the help of their
mentor. Elias Rodriquez 'l3 start
ed his first research project without
a clear-cut path. However, the
guidance of his fellow, Heather
Love, led him to a thesis on the
transience of identity in Virginia
Woolf's Waves, which relates to her
topic, the power of group stigmati
zation.
"She recognized what I was in
terested in and pushed me in cer
tain directions," Rodriquez said.
"Now, I feel like a lot of questions
she asks are the questions I ask
about all my other papers ... She
helped me figure out a method of

better intellectual engagement,
just by virtue of interacting with
her."
The fellows not only serve as ac
ademic guideposts for students but
also give students confidence in
their intellectual passions. Adams
and Riello look at 17th century
drawings of Canton ports just for
the enjoyment of admiring and en
gaging in art. Rasmussen and
Mendez typically start off their
meetings with conversations in
Spanish about the latest in South
American politics.
Adams described how the fel
lows help students see the long
term value of their work.
"As well as giving me actual
quantifiable help, it's also an inspi
ration to know that if you work on
something, you can get to a level
where it really is rewarding,"
Adams said.

topic. Fellows are academic giants in a diverse
range of specialized fields, selected from a pool
of nearly 250 applicants annually. Although
their academic prestige might seem intimidat
ing, they give the students who work with them
the chance to travel deep into the complexities
of an intellectual arena, look at a concept
squarely in the face and decide if it needs some
reconstructive surgery.
Students usually tackle one aspect of their
fellow's research and are paid approximately
$1,400 per quarter for 10 hours of work per
week. To conclude the experience, the students
present their work during one of the Center's
weekly show-off-your-research lunches. These
presentations took place this year at a sympo
sium at the Center on May 25.
Undergraduates often reap the benefits of

their fellows' academic connections and exten
sive access to research facilities on campus. For
example, Harley Adams 'll, who is studying
colonial archives of the Indian Ocean with fel
low Giorgio Riello, has been working on a
quantitative spreadsheet of every factory in the
Indian Ocean from 1500 to 1800. Under Riel
lo's tutelage, he was able to work with the Spa
tial History Lab to digitally render this infor
mation on an interactive map, showing geo
graphic and chronological changes.
"What's interesting is that this information
has never been collected in such away before,
centered in one place," Adams said, describing
the approach as a new way to consider a place's
history. "Through just looking at the Indian
Ocean, you can see the entire world."
This project provides students with an ex
tensive research opportunity without having to
commit to completing an honors thesis.
"I ended up not doing an honors thesis, be
cause I'm double majoring, so this is my way of
doing a mini thesis," said Richard Sajor 'll,
who is currently researching the perception of
death in Medieval London with fellow Amy
Appleford.
For Sajor, the chance to explore his topic at
the Center helped satisfy his intellectual cu
riosity in away that classes could not.
"I'm somebody who has taken all the Me
dieval courses that I could ... this filled in a lot
of places where I felt like there weren't enough
classes," Sajor said.
Similarly, for Elizabeth Rasmussen *l2, the
Center was an academic jackpot for her inter
est in political trends in Peru. Rasmussen
worked with fellow Cecilia Mendez to investi
gate civil wars in 19th century Peru, which she
said she would have been unable to explore
through traditional coursework.
Having exhausted Stanford's language
courses, Rasmussen found an opportunity to
advance her language skills at the Center by
completing her reading, writing and conversa-
tions with Mendez in Spanish.
Although some students come
to the Center with highly specific
research interests, many find a
niche through the help of their
mentor. Elias Rodriquez 'l3 start
ed his first research project without
a clear-cut path. However, the
guidance of his fellow, Heather
Love, led him to a thesis on the
transience of identity in Virginia
Woolf's Waves, which relates to her
topic, the power of group stigmati
zation.
"She recognized what I was in
terested in and pushed me in cer
tain directions," Rodriquez said.
"Now, I feel like a lot of questions
she asks are the questions I ask
about all my other papers ... She
helped me figure out a method of

better intellectual engagement,
just by virtue of interacting with
her."
The fellows not only serve as ac
ademic guideposts for students but
also give students confidence in
their intellectual passions. Adams
and Riello look at 17th century
drawings of Canton ports just for
the enjoyment of admiring and en
gaging in art. Rasmussen and
Mendez typically start off their
meetings with conversations in
Spanish about the latest in South
American politics.
Adams described how the fel
lows help students see the long
term value of their work.
"As well as giving me actual
quantifiable help, it's also an inspi
ration to know that if you work on
something, you can get to a level
where it really is rewarding,"
Adams said.
