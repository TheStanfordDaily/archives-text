## EDITOR'S FAREWELL Embracing Diversity 
### Zach Zimmerman 
I grew up in Daytona Beach, Fla.,
a town primarily known for
Spring Break, NASCAR and
driving on the beach. The warm
ocean was a good place to learn to
surf (despite being the shark-bite
capital of the world), and the public
schools prepared me adequately for
Stanford's rigorous academics.
However, what I realize now is that
it is an area lacking the rich diversi
ty many of us have come to take for
granted in our time on the Farm.
The global awareness of our
community is unparalleled. In fact,
the student body immediately rede
fined the way I interpreted the term
diversity. It no longer signified sim
ple differences in family origin; it
applied to those of different cultur
al and socioeconomic backgrounds,
of varying political ideologies and
sexual orientation. We are beyond
privileged to live and interact in an
environment that promotes a mutu
al understanding of each other's
lives.

This continuous dialogue, as
beneficial as it may be, is not always
easy. The nature of a heterogeneous
community is that there is rarely
universal agreement. It's a phenom
enon that, when coupled with the
inherent stress and competition of
higher education, can move from
highly thought provoking to over
whelming. When placed in these sit
uations, we run the risk of reacting
in ways we later regret, opting for
impulsive, passion-driven actions
over more eloquent, thought-out

responses.
In the short amount of time that
has comprised this volume, we have
been through a tremendous amount
as a community. We have encoun
tered events that have tested our re
siliency as a cooperative unit. We
have found ourselves divided by ar
guments that appeared to offer lit
tle room for compromise and have
been placed against many of our
closest friends on issues of student
life, academics and human rights
where there was no shortage of pas
sion. There have been trying times
to say the least.

The same can be said for The
Daily's coverage of these topics. As
a diverse group of students, we have
been challenged as an organization

to clearly define our roles as jour
nalists. Like the greater Stanford
community, we don't always agree.
The depth and breadth of our cov
erage comes under constant inter
nal scrutiny. We have occasionally
found ourselves toe-to-toe on how
to cover or not cover issues we feel
passionately about.
But as editor in chief, I found the
most value not in what we decided,
but in the processes by which we
made decisions. Observing a di
verse staff of stimulated minds shar
ing, discussing and debating opin
ions on topics ranging from ROTC
to the expansion of the humanities
has been among the more reward
ing and awe-inspiring experiences
of my life.
Attempting to constantly further
our understanding of the Stanford
community has been a primary goal
during the existence of this 120-
year-old organization. We wish to
improve the quality of our work by
becoming more in touch with your
lives. Although the nature of jour
nalism creates the occasional con
troversy, I am incredibly grateful for
your appreciation and support of a
staff dedicated to serving you in the
best way possible.
On that note, you have done an
unbelievable job of serving each
other.This community would not be
what it is without the endless desire
to grow and to learn. We may never
fully agree, but we can always try to
understand. As President John F.
Kennedy said, "If we cannot now
end our differences, at least we can
help make the world safe for diver
sity."
Thank you for an incredible vol
ume. It has been an absolute pleasure.
Sincerely,

ZACH ZIMMERMAN
President and Editor in Chief,
Vol. CCXXXIX
