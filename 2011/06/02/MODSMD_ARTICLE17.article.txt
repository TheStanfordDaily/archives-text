Ladies and gentlemen, wel
come to the 2010-11 Editori
al Board's final editorial.
Over the last several months, we
have delicately argued positions on
a variety of issues (read: shoved our
opinions in your faces), and urged
University officials to do a great
number of things differently. Why
they would take the opinions of a
band of presumptuous undergrads
into account is beyond us, but we
urged them nevertheless. We hope
our opinions have been insightful,
eye-opening, moving and maybe
even a little life changing. Realisti
cally, we hope at least a few of you
have read our pieces and found
them moderately less soporific
than the rest of The Daily. But since
our exhortation for lifetime access
to stanford.edu email accounts
racked up 60 times as many Face
book likes as our recommenda
tions on gun safety (really, guys?),
it's been a hit and miss edition.

11th year as Stanford's president,
which is right around the time
when our last four presidents threw
in the towel. Given how awesome
Hennessy is, and how Stanford
would be correspondingly less
awesome were he to leave, this re
alization makes us sad. Since we
don't like feeling sad, we demand
that Stanford use any means neces
sary to prevent our president from
leaving. If need be, keep him here
by force the force exerted by a
Hoover-sized pile of cash. Simply
put: there is no term limit on excel
lence. If this ironclad logic does not
a sufficiently sound argument
make, then let us continue by citing
some of Hennessy's more mind-be
fuddling achievements. We know
you will agree that Hennessy is, in
dubitably, the best thing since the
Dixie cup met the ping-pong ball.
Listing all of our fearless
leader's achievements would be
like numbering the stars, failing
Stats 60 or running the dish after
Cafe Night. Nevertheless, as stal
wart Stanford men and women, we
are wont to try. During his career,
Hennessy has been honored by the
Dalai Lama, helped author over
100 publications and added 35 bul
lets to the Honors and Awards sec
tion of his CV. He has founded
MIPS Computer Systems, urged
passage of the DREAM Act and
looked really good wearing red. His
less well-known achievements in
clude denying Emma Watson ad
mission to Stanford, diverting

Today, however, we'd like to
take a moment to reflect on an as
pect of Stanford that has never let
us down. One man at this universi
ty has consistently raised the bar
and made us proud. Some of you
know him as the founder of his own
cognac label. Others recognize him
as member of the board of direc
tors of Google, Cisco, Microsoft,
Goldman Sachs and the Illuminati.
Still others don't even know his
name, but are warmed by his dash
ing good looks and beautiful smile.
We're talking about our president,
John Le√üoy "Boss" Hennessy.
