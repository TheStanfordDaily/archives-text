# I HAVE TWO HEADS
## On the Fence 
### Rachel Kolb 
Like many other Stanford stu
dents, once you get me started,
I have a strong opinion about
many things. Yet, in everyday life,
there are several questions to which
my answer can be unexpectedly im
partial. What do you feel like eating?
Which movie do you want to see?
What do you want to do now? Any of
the above. No preference. 1 don't
know, and 1 don't care.
As the above might imply, I con
sider myself an even-keel person. 1
am not one of those dominant, fear
less-leader types who have an answer
to and a goal for everything, one of
those people who sweep others along
in the sheer force of their plans. My
distaste for making decisions goes so
far that my family used to tease me
that I had commitment issues. "I can
see both sides," I'd say, and hem and
haw about matters as inconsequen
tial as which book to check out from
the library.
Even concerning less everyday
topics, I sometimes have a hard time
making a case for one thing over an
other. Likewise, I sometimes have a
hard time defining myself or other
people within the realms of a specific
category. Our identities, after all, are
in constant flux, and different places,
people and circumstances prompt us
to slide from one role or perspective
to another. No one aspect of life in
deed can denote us truly, and I some
times resist absolute answers just as I

sometimes resist making even the
most minor decisions. I am intrigued
by complexity and inconsistency,
since which of us can say that we are
always consistent with ourselves? I
am often of two minds.

This sort of inconclusiveness, in
some ways, opposes outside percep
tions of what Stanford students are
supposed to be like. I sometimes
cringe at telling people that I go to
Stanford. The reasons for this vary,
but one is the assumptions that can
come with the self-designated label
of being a Stanford student: that I'm
one of those smart, confident individ
uals who have their act together, who
know the answer not only to those
tough homework assignments but
also to the question of how to go and
be successful and who are gunning
for that answer without so much as a
backward glance. We at Stanford
know that this stereotype is not al
ways true. We may be serious stu
dents, but like all people, we don't
have all the answers. We do frequent
ly have large aspirations, but we can
struggle with finding one way with
which to reconcile all our desires,
passions and interests.
One simplistic perception of edu
cation is that its function is to teach us
the right answer or to give us the
tools to go about finding it. After all,
we spend most of our academic years
shooting for the correct answer on
tests and trying to figure out the right

or "educated" way to do things. The
more highly educated we are, accord
ing to this binary viewpoint, the more
we will have proved ourselves as
good at being right. We will be able to
make complex decisions and back
them up with irrefutable evidence.
What is more, we will be able to point
to our degree to justify the extent of
our knowledge.

I think most of us can see the flaws
that arise from this binary perspec
tive, Being "right" isn't always knowl
edge; it can also be arrogance. Educa
tion can give us answers, yes, and
learning the standard methodologies
of a particular field is important, but
in a liberal arts setting, education
more often serves to raise further
questions. All of us have heard that
maxim that the more we learn, the
more we realize how much we don't
know. Even in the physical sciences,
where the objects and concepts being
studied are supposedly more con
crete, assumptions are made about
existent variables or conditions, and
the farther we get outside of the the
oretical vacuum, the more complex
life becomes. As with the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, sometimes it
just isn't possible to know everything

or to classify everything as one thing
or the other.
Most of us become starkly aware
of the gray areas inherent in our
fields of academic study, but we can
be less skilled at recalling them in
our social lives. After all, humans do
have an inherent tendency to cate
gorize everything even our
selves, whether it is in a census ques
tionnaire or an informal introduc
tion at a party. These classifications
can make life simpler, but they can
also make us miss out on the won
derfully strange occurrences all
around us. It is far more valuable to
approach education and life with a
questioning mind than a determina
tion to place everything neatly in a
box.
Over the last two quarters, I've
tried to break down such dualities
and concrete labels. I've tried to ex
plore the complexity of moments in
which we realize that we or our
peers or our world can be defined as
neither one thing nor the other. And,
dear readers, it's been fun. Thanks
for coming along for the ride.

Rachel wants to hear what you've
been on the fence about this year. Send

those people who sweep others along
in the sheer force of their plans. My
distaste for making decisions goes so
far that my family used to tease me
that I had commitment issues. "I can
see both sides," I'd say, and hem and
haw about matters as inconsequen
tial as which book to check out from
the library.
Even concerning less everyday
topics, I sometimes have a hard time
making a case for one thing over an
other. Likewise, I sometimes have a
hard time defining myself or other
people within the realms of a specific
category. Our identities, after all, are
in constant flux, and different places,
people and circumstances prompt us
to slide from one role or perspective
to another. No one aspect of life in
deed can denote us truly, and I some
times resist absolute answers just as I

sometimes resist making even the
most minor decisions. I am intrigued
by complexity and inconsistency,
since which of us can say that we are
always consistent with ourselves? I
am often of two minds.

This sort of inconclusiveness, in
some ways, opposes outside percep
tions of what Stanford students are
supposed to be like. I sometimes
cringe at telling people that I go to
Stanford. The reasons for this vary,
but one is the assumptions that can
come with the self-designated label
of being a Stanford student: that I'm
one of those smart, confident individ
uals who have their act together, who
know the answer not only to those
tough homework assignments but
also to the question of how to go and
be successful and who are gunning
for that answer without so much as a
backward glance. We at Stanford
know that this stereotype is not al
ways true. We may be serious stu
dents, but like all people, we don't
have all the answers. We do frequent
ly have large aspirations, but we can
struggle with finding one way with
which to reconcile all our desires,
passions and interests.
One simplistic perception of edu
cation is that its function is to teach us
the right answer or to give us the
tools to go about finding it. After all,
we spend most of our academic years
shooting for the correct answer on
tests and trying to figure out the right

or "educated" way to do things. The
more highly educated we are, accord
ing to this binary viewpoint, the more
we will have proved ourselves as
good at being right. We will be able to
make complex decisions and back
them up with irrefutable evidence.
What is more, we will be able to point
to our degree to justify the extent of
our knowledge.

I think most of us can see the flaws
that arise from this binary perspec
tive, Being "right" isn't always knowl
edge; it can also be arrogance. Educa
tion can give us answers, yes, and
learning the standard methodologies
of a particular field is important, but
in a liberal arts setting, education
more often serves to raise further
questions. All of us have heard that
maxim that the more we learn, the
more we realize how much we don't
know. Even in the physical sciences,
where the objects and concepts being
studied are supposedly more con
crete, assumptions are made about
existent variables or conditions, and
the farther we get outside of the the
oretical vacuum, the more complex
life becomes. As with the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, sometimes it
just isn't possible to know everything

or to classify everything as one thing
or the other.
Most of us become starkly aware
of the gray areas inherent in our
fields of academic study, but we can
be less skilled at recalling them in
our social lives. After all, humans do
have an inherent tendency to cate
gorize everything even our
selves, whether it is in a census ques
tionnaire or an informal introduc
tion at a party. These classifications
can make life simpler, but they can
also make us miss out on the won
derfully strange occurrences all
around us. It is far more valuable to
approach education and life with a
questioning mind than a determina
tion to place everything neatly in a
box.
Over the last two quarters, I've
tried to break down such dualities
and concrete labels. I've tried to ex
plore the complexity of moments in
which we realize that we or our
peers or our world can be defined as
neither one thing nor the other. And,
dear readers, it's been fun. Thanks
for coming along for the ride.
