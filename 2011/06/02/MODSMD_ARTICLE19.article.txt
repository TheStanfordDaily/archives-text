# THE
						TRANSITIVE PROPERTY
## Reflections at the End of a Long Journey 
### Cristopher Bautista 
So this is the end. I remember
ever since I was a young fresh
man working at The Stanford
Daily as a graphics editor, I dreamed
of writing a column. And as I ap
proach my last days at Stanford, I've
finally fulfilled this dream. It's a bit
surreal.

This column is dedicated to you,
readers. I admit I would not have
gone this far in my transition with
out writing this column in the first
place. I felt that even if I had just one
person reading this, one person to be
accountable to, then I would do
what I needed to do. I admit that
part of the reason why I went off to
legally change my name, start hor
mones, get that new driver's license
and so on was because I wouldn't
have had anything to write about for
that week otherwise. So the very act
of reading this column has helped
me with my transition. You've kept
me on my toes, readers, made me
take the steps I needed to take that I
wouldn't have been able to do if I

was doing this by myself because
I admit I'm kind of a lazy person. So
thanks, readers. I appreciate it. I
couldn't have done any of this with
out you.

And to my Stanford readers
thanks. Thanks for not only becom
ing aware, but doing something
about it. Two years ago, a transgen
der student would not have been
able to get a new ID without legally
changing his or her name a har
rowing process that might take
months or even years, depending on
what state (or country) you're from.
But now, Stanford is taking the steps
for transgender students to change
their name and gender in the Stan

ford roster without going through
the legal process. And during New
Student Orientation next school
year, one of my transgender friends
will speak about her experiences in
front of the entire incoming fresh
man class. That would have never
happened when I was a freshman, or
even at the beginning of this school
year. Transgender people, for so
long an invisible population, have
entered the sphere of the Stanford
community's consciousness. My
Stanford trans friends they're
talking about us, aware of us. Yeah,
there's still a long way to go al
though Stanford is probably one of
the safest campuses for transgender
people, that does not mean we've
reached full equality but we've
taken great steps from my days as a
sophomore, just coming out, scared
and alone. I know that I'm leaving
Stanford in good hands. I can gradu
ate with no regrets.
