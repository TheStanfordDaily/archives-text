# COMING OUT IN THE LOCKER ROOM
## Closeted Stanford athletes have 'fear of the unknown' 
### RYAN MAC SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The night before the 2008 Cana
da Cup, the final meet of the fall sea
son for the Stanford women's swim
ming team, Laura Wadden 'O9 lay in
bed awake.
Three weeks earlier, Wadden was
the poster child of a Stanford stu
dent campaign against Proposition
8, a California initiative to ban
same-sex marriage. She was left dev
astated by the results, as 52 percent
of state voters decided that mar
riage could only be between a man
and a woman.
In her Toronto hotel room, the
senior co-captain of the swimming
team was overcome with memories
and emotions of the past half-year.
She remembered imploring her fel
low students through a megaphone
to join her in the fight for equal
rights and recognition of same-sex
marriage. She recalled her encour
agement for her younger brother
Jack, a rower on the men's crew
team at Williams College, when he
told their parents the summer be
fore that he was gay.
But on Thanksgiving night in
2008, after months of supporting
others, Wadden wondered who
would be there for her.

The next day, she found her
coach, Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95, just

before the start of her first event.
"I'm bisexual," Wadden told her
coach.
At Stanford, coming out can still
be difficult, especially for athletes.
The University is home to about 800
varsity athletes, but only a handful
has come out while still representing
the Cardinal at the collegiate level.
It took Wadden four years to
confront her identity and tell her
coach, after questioning her own
sexuality since high school. Looking
back, she recalled her reasons for
closeting part of her identity for the
majority of her time at Stanford.
"I was just so scared," Wadden
said of the night before she con
fronted Maurer. "I didn't know if I
should come out or not, and I didn't
even know who to tell."
"Fear of the Unknown"
Wadden's situation is by no
means unique among Stanford ath
letes. Nor is it a development con
fined to the boundaries of the Farm.
Cyd Zeigler '95, founder of Out
sports.com, has heard hundreds of
stories of lesbian, gay, bisexual or
transsexual (LGBT) athletes at
every level of sport over 11 years of
running his website. He estimated
that the proportion of LGBT indi
viduals in sports was no less than
that in the world population, about 2
to 3 percent.

"That means there are hundreds
or thousands of collegiate athletes
who are gay," he said.
Across both amateur and profes
sional American sports, there has
been a slow outpouring of encour
agement for gay athletes. Prominent
sports figures, among them former
basketball star Charles Barkley and
various NFL players, have stated
their support and recognition of
LGBT issues. Some, like former Vil
lanova basketball player Will Sheri
dan, have chosen to come out after
keeping their sexual identities away
from the public eye.
Stories like these have been few
and far between at Stanford.
The University's nondiscrimina
tion policy protects against any un
lawful discrimination based on eth
nicity, gender, disability, religion or
sexual orientation in any school pro
gram or activity. Despite the stated
policies, Zeigler stated that closeted
student-athletes at Stanford main
tain a "fear of the unknown."
"You don't know for absolute
fact that your coach is going to ac
cept you and your teammates are
going to accept you," he said. "You
don't have it written in a contract
that these people are going to accept
you."

A Stigma in Stanford Sports?
Last Wednesday, eight current

and former Stanford athletes de
tailed their struggles on a panel for
LGBT issues in sports. Held by Safe
and Open Spaces at Stanford
(SOSAS), a group dedicated to
opening dialogue on queer issues,
the talk brought together athletes,
some out and some not, from across
several sports.
Sitting on couches in the
Women's Community Center, once
the rallying place for 2008's Prop. 8
protests, the athletes described their
internal struggles as gay lesbian or

bisexual in a realm that has not al
ways been welcoming of individuals
of all sexual orientations.

The organizer of that panel,
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-president of
Stanford Students for Queer Liber
ation (SSQL) and a Daily staffer,
said that some aspects of the Stan
ford Athletics Department lag be
hind the general campus attitudes
on LGBT issues. She cited the lack
of out athletes at the University as a

varsity swim team. Having won two golds at the Canada Cup, she said her
greatest victory was coming out to her coach Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95.
sign of the disparity.
"There's certainly a stigma asso
ciated with being gay, even being an
ally [of an LGBT student], and
being an athlete," she said.
While athletes on the panel were
quick to state that Stanford's stu
dent body and campus environment
have created a relatively welcoming
environment, some were still dis
comforted by the handling of LGBT
issues and the relative insensitivity
within their respective teams.
In an interview before her ap
pearance on the SOSAS panel,
Wadden recalled an instance during
her freshman year when some sen
ior swimmers joked about a team
mate who they thought was a les
bian.
"The fact they would laugh about
it made me feel that being a lesbian
would be an out-of-the-ordinary
thing that people wouldn't necessar
ily be cool with," she said.
One current Stanford women's
basketball player, who identified as
bisexual, did not feel that her team
mates were aware of the potential
harm created by fleeting insults
thrown around on the court. She did
not want to be identified because
she has not told her family of her
sexual identity.
"There are people on our team
who will say 'That's so gay,' or 'he's a
gay, she's a gay' and misuse the
word," she said.
Xanthe Travlos 'll, a field hock
ey player, came out to her team
mates in 2008 after becoming close
with another member of her team.
After concealing their relationship
for a year, she and her girlfriend
slowly come out to teammates,
which Travlos described as a "huge
relief."

But after a game against David
son College in October of that year,
Travlos heard the laughs and saw
the pointing from members of the
opposing team. As she and her girl
friend walked off the Stanford Var
sity Field Hockey Turf, which had
been sponsored in part by the Les
bian Equality Foundation of Silicon
Valley, Travlos realized that her
coming-out process would not be
without its difficulties.
She later traced the source of the
rumors to a member of the Stanford
coaching staff, who Travlos and her
girlfriend thought was someone
they could trust. That coach has
since left the team.
An Unprecedented Situation in the
Locker Room
While there has been no systemic
discrimination against individuals of
any sexual orientation in Stanford
sports, athletes said that it is often
the little things the insensitive re
marks among teammates or a
coach's inability to handle a situa
tion that convey that the Univer
sity's athletics programs do not yet
completely embrace LGBT partici

pants. Some, like Dwight Slater 'O2,
believe that homophobic aspects
have been ingrained in aspects of
sports culture.
In 1999, Slater, then a redshirt
freshman on the Stanford football
team, decided to relieve himself of a
burden that had weighed on his con
science since joining the Cardinal
that summer. A highly recruited of
fensive lineman from Florida, Slater
confronted then-head coach Tyrone
Willingham with a two-word state
ment not often heard in a football
locker room.
"I'm gay."
As a freshman, Slater struggled
with his own sexuality, his personal
relationship with his father and the
recent death of his mother. He saw
Stanford, more than 2,500 miles

away from home, as an escape.
But soon after arriving on cam
pus, Slater came to conclude that the
"hyper-masculine" nature of the
sport he played and his sexual iden
tity were not compatible. He often
found himself lying about where he
was going or what he was doing.
"The gay angle didn't fit in any
where, and I didn't know how to fit it
into my identity," he recalled. "I just
felt like a fraud the whole time."
In the most trying academic and
athletic environment he had ever
experienced, Slater was left alone on
the team, unable to confide in his
teammates or coaching staff. It took
months for him to tell Willingham, a
decision that only came after being
spurred on by the positive support
of a dorm event, "Crossing The
Line," in which he revealed his sexu
al identity to his fellow residents.
But when Slater later told his
head coach, he confided in a man
who he believed did not know how
to deal with such an unprecedented
situation.
"I don't think he was able to han
dle my situation," Slater said, "I was
n't able to handle it. At that time, I
don't think anybody had come out
on a team sport... He was willing
to work with me, but only on his
timeline."
Because his situation was so

unique, the football coaching staff
was neither trained nor prepared to
deal with his situation, inadvertently
making decisions that would force
Slater to come out to his father.
Looking back, Slater maintains
no ill will toward Willingham or the
other coaches, but remembers a di
vided team atmosphere, with some
teammates readily accepting of his
identity and others choosing to open
ly state their discomfort. He left the
team during his freshman year.
Slater is seen as one of the first
NCAA Division I football players
to announce that he was gay, but he
did not think his situation was
unique at the time or within his
sport.
"I was not the only one," Slater
said.

An Effort to Change A Culture
While Travlos and Wadden have
come out to their teammates and
coaches, they want to ensure that
any athlete can find that same com
fort and confidence. Along with Fet
ter, the pair made a presentation last
spring to Stanford Director of Athlet
ics Bob Bowlsby and proposed that
the Athletics Department institute
LGBT sensitivity training for its
coaches and staff
While Fetter has said that the envi
ronment within University locker
rooms and on Stanford playing fields
has been slow to change, the Athletics
Department has taken some initia
tive. In February, the department wel
comed an NCAA-sanctioned speak
er to lead a cultural diversity work
shop.
Senior Associate Athletics Direc
tor Earl Koberlein 'B6 said that sexu
al orientation in Stanford sports was
"not really an issue." In an email to
The Daily, Koberlein stated that the
University recruits individuals that
can excel academically and athletical
ly, regardless of sexual preference.
"Any student-athlete in need of
support is encouraged to meet with
Athletics Department or University
staffers who can provide needed sup
port, advice and connect them to Uni
versity resources as appropriate," he
said.

Some athletes are looking for the
Athletics Department to move be
yond their tacit acceptance of LGBT
athletes in varsity sports to actively
welcome them. While Koberlein was
not aware of any coaches making
public statements in support of gay or
lesbian athletes, the anonymous
women's basketball player believed
that a message from a Tara Van-
Derveer or a David Shaw could have
a profound effect on the perception
of LGBT participants in Stanford
sports.
Zeigler welcomed such state
ments. He hoped that a more open
environment within the Stanford
Athletics Department could convey
to closeted athletes that they would
be accepted and embraced by their
peers.
"A lot of people in sports don't

want to talk about this issue," Zeigler
said. "But when they're confronted
with a teammate coming out of the
closet, they are supportive, because
sports are about a few things. But at
the end of the day, [the team is] built to
win. As long as someone is contribut
ing to winning, that person can have
three legs or they can be purple."
This was something that Wadden
soon realized after coming out to her
coach and her teammates. While she
swam to two golds at the Canada
Cup, her biggest victory came outside
the pool when she revealed her iden
tity to Coach Maurer.
"It's okay, you're fine," her coach
said, wrapping her arms around Wad
den. "It's not that big of a deal."

varsity swim team. Having won two golds at the Canada Cup, she said her
greatest victory was coming out to her coach Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95.
sign of the disparity.
"There's certainly a stigma asso
ciated with being gay, even being an
ally [of an LGBT student], and
being an athlete," she said.
While athletes on the panel were
quick to state that Stanford's stu
dent body and campus environment
have created a relatively welcoming
environment, some were still dis
comforted by the handling of LGBT
issues and the relative insensitivity
within their respective teams.
In an interview before her ap
pearance on the SOSAS panel,
Wadden recalled an instance during
her freshman year when some sen
ior swimmers joked about a team
mate who they thought was a les
bian.
"The fact they would laugh about
it made me feel that being a lesbian
would be an out-of-the-ordinary
thing that people wouldn't necessar
ily be cool with," she said.
One current Stanford women's
basketball player, who identified as
bisexual, did not feel that her team
mates were aware of the potential
harm created by fleeting insults
thrown around on the court. She did
not want to be identified because
she has not told her family of her
sexual identity.
"There are people on our team
who will say 'That's so gay,' or 'he's a
gay, she's a gay' and misuse the
word," she said.
Xanthe Travlos 'll, a field hock
ey player, came out to her team
mates in 2008 after becoming close
with another member of her team.
After concealing their relationship
for a year, she and her girlfriend
slowly come out to teammates,
which Travlos described as a "huge
relief."

But after a game against David
son College in October of that year,
Travlos heard the laughs and saw
the pointing from members of the
opposing team. As she and her girl
friend walked off the Stanford Var
sity Field Hockey Turf, which had
been sponsored in part by the Les
bian Equality Foundation of Silicon
Valley, Travlos realized that her
coming-out process would not be
without its difficulties.
She later traced the source of the
rumors to a member of the Stanford
coaching staff, who Travlos and her
girlfriend thought was someone
they could trust. That coach has
since left the team.
An Unprecedented Situation in the
Locker Room
While there has been no systemic
discrimination against individuals of
any sexual orientation in Stanford
sports, athletes said that it is often
the little things the insensitive re
marks among teammates or a
coach's inability to handle a situa
tion that convey that the Univer
sity's athletics programs do not yet
completely embrace LGBT partici

pants. Some, like Dwight Slater 'O2,
believe that homophobic aspects
have been ingrained in aspects of
sports culture.
In 1999, Slater, then a redshirt
freshman on the Stanford football
team, decided to relieve himself of a
burden that had weighed on his con
science since joining the Cardinal
that summer. A highly recruited of
fensive lineman from Florida, Slater
confronted then-head coach Tyrone
Willingham with a two-word state
ment not often heard in a football
locker room.
"I'm gay."
As a freshman, Slater struggled
with his own sexuality, his personal
relationship with his father and the
recent death of his mother. He saw
Stanford, more than 2,500 miles

away from home, as an escape.
But soon after arriving on cam
pus, Slater came to conclude that the
"hyper-masculine" nature of the
sport he played and his sexual iden
tity were not compatible. He often
found himself lying about where he
was going or what he was doing.
"The gay angle didn't fit in any
where, and I didn't know how to fit it
into my identity," he recalled. "I just
felt like a fraud the whole time."
In the most trying academic and
athletic environment he had ever
experienced, Slater was left alone on
the team, unable to confide in his
teammates or coaching staff. It took
months for him to tell Willingham, a
decision that only came after being
spurred on by the positive support
of a dorm event, "Crossing The
Line," in which he revealed his sexu
al identity to his fellow residents.
But when Slater later told his
head coach, he confided in a man
who he believed did not know how
to deal with such an unprecedented
situation.
"I don't think he was able to han
dle my situation," Slater said, "I was
n't able to handle it. At that time, I
don't think anybody had come out
on a team sport... He was willing
to work with me, but only on his
timeline."
Because his situation was so

unique, the football coaching staff
was neither trained nor prepared to
deal with his situation, inadvertently
making decisions that would force
Slater to come out to his father.
Looking back, Slater maintains
no ill will toward Willingham or the
other coaches, but remembers a di
vided team atmosphere, with some
teammates readily accepting of his
identity and others choosing to open
ly state their discomfort. He left the
team during his freshman year.
Slater is seen as one of the first
NCAA Division I football players
to announce that he was gay, but he
did not think his situation was
unique at the time or within his
sport.
"I was not the only one," Slater
said.

An Effort to Change A Culture
While Travlos and Wadden have
come out to their teammates and
coaches, they want to ensure that
any athlete can find that same com
fort and confidence. Along with Fet
ter, the pair made a presentation last
spring to Stanford Director of Athlet
ics Bob Bowlsby and proposed that
the Athletics Department institute
LGBT sensitivity training for its
coaches and staff
While Fetter has said that the envi
ronment within University locker
rooms and on Stanford playing fields
has been slow to change, the Athletics
Department has taken some initia
tive. In February, the department wel
comed an NCAA-sanctioned speak
er to lead a cultural diversity work
shop.
Senior Associate Athletics Direc
tor Earl Koberlein 'B6 said that sexu
al orientation in Stanford sports was
"not really an issue." In an email to
The Daily, Koberlein stated that the
University recruits individuals that
can excel academically and athletical
ly, regardless of sexual preference.
"Any student-athlete in need of
support is encouraged to meet with
Athletics Department or University
staffers who can provide needed sup
port, advice and connect them to Uni
versity resources as appropriate," he
said.

Some athletes are looking for the
Athletics Department to move be
yond their tacit acceptance of LGBT
athletes in varsity sports to actively
welcome them. While Koberlein was
not aware of any coaches making
public statements in support of gay or
lesbian athletes, the anonymous
women's basketball player believed
that a message from a Tara Van-
Derveer or a David Shaw could have
a profound effect on the perception
of LGBT participants in Stanford
sports.
Zeigler welcomed such state
ments. He hoped that a more open
environment within the Stanford
Athletics Department could convey
to closeted athletes that they would
be accepted and embraced by their
peers.
"A lot of people in sports don't

want to talk about this issue," Zeigler
said. "But when they're confronted
with a teammate coming out of the
closet, they are supportive, because
sports are about a few things. But at
the end of the day, [the team is] built to
win. As long as someone is contribut
ing to winning, that person can have
three legs or they can be purple."
This was something that Wadden
soon realized after coming out to her
coach and her teammates. While she
swam to two golds at the Canada
Cup, her biggest victory came outside
the pool when she revealed her iden
tity to Coach Maurer.
"It's okay, you're fine," her coach
said, wrapping her arms around Wad
den. "It's not that big of a deal."

Laura Wadden '09, a former swimmer, dedicated significant time to a
campaign against Prop. 8 in 2008. Her personal struggle to come out to
her coach and teammates, however, was fraught with uncertainty and fear.
The night before the 2008 Cana
da Cup, the final meet of the fall sea
son for the Stanford women's swim
ming team, Laura Wadden 'O9 lay in
bed awake.
Three weeks earlier, Wadden was
the poster child of a Stanford stu
dent campaign against Proposition
8, a California initiative to ban
same-sex marriage. She was left dev
astated by the results, as 52 percent
of state voters decided that mar
riage could only be between a man
and a woman.
In her Toronto hotel room, the
senior co-captain of the swimming
team was overcome with memories
and emotions of the past half-year.
She remembered imploring her fel
low students through a megaphone
to join her in the fight for equal
rights and recognition of same-sex
marriage. She recalled her encour
agement for her younger brother
Jack, a rower on the men's crew
team at Williams College, when he
told their parents the summer be
fore that he was gay.
But on Thanksgiving night in
2008, after months of supporting
others, Wadden wondered who
would be there for her.

The next day, she found her
coach, Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95, just

before the start of her first event.
"I'm bisexual," Wadden told her
coach.
At Stanford, coming out can still
be difficult, especially for athletes.
The University is home to about 800
varsity athletes, but only a handful
has come out while still representing
the Cardinal at the collegiate level.
It took Wadden four years to
confront her identity and tell her
coach, after questioning her own
sexuality since high school. Looking
back, she recalled her reasons for
closeting part of her identity for the
majority of her time at Stanford.
"I was just so scared," Wadden
said of the night before she con
fronted Maurer. "I didn't know if I
should come out or not, and I didn't
even know who to tell."
"Fear of the Unknown"
Wadden's situation is by no
means unique among Stanford ath
letes. Nor is it a development con
fined to the boundaries of the Farm.
Cyd Zeigler '95, founder of Out
sports.com, has heard hundreds of
stories of lesbian, gay, bisexual or
transsexual (LGBT) athletes at
every level of sport over 11 years of
running his website. He estimated
that the proportion of LGBT indi
viduals in sports was no less than
that in the world population, about 2
to 3 percent.

"That means there are hundreds
or thousands of collegiate athletes
who are gay," he said.
Across both amateur and profes
sional American sports, there has
been a slow outpouring of encour
agement for gay athletes. Prominent
sports figures, among them former
basketball star Charles Barkley and
various NFL players, have stated
their support and recognition of
LGBT issues. Some, like former Vil
lanova basketball player Will Sheri
dan, have chosen to come out after
keeping their sexual identities away
from the public eye.
Stories like these have been few
and far between at Stanford.
The University's nondiscrimina
tion policy protects against any un
lawful discrimination based on eth
nicity, gender, disability, religion or
sexual orientation in any school pro
gram or activity. Despite the stated
policies, Zeigler stated that closeted
student-athletes at Stanford main
tain a "fear of the unknown."
"You don't know for absolute
fact that your coach is going to ac
cept you and your teammates are
going to accept you," he said. "You
don't have it written in a contract
that these people are going to accept
you."

A Stigma in Stanford Sports?
Last Wednesday, eight current

and former Stanford athletes de
tailed their struggles on a panel for
LGBT issues in sports. Held by Safe
and Open Spaces at Stanford
(SOSAS), a group dedicated to
opening dialogue on queer issues,
the talk brought together athletes,
some out and some not, from across
several sports.
Sitting on couches in the
Women's Community Center, once
the rallying place for 2008's Prop. 8
protests, the athletes described their
internal struggles as gay lesbian or

bisexual in a realm that has not al
ways been welcoming of individuals
of all sexual orientations.

The organizer of that panel,
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-president of
Stanford Students for Queer Liber
ation (SSQL) and a Daily staffer,
said that some aspects of the Stan
ford Athletics Department lag be

on LGBT issues. She cited the lack
of out athletes at the University as a

was neither trained nor prepared to
deal with his situation, inadvertently
making decisions that would force
Slater to come out to his father.
Looking back, Slater maintains
no ill will toward Willingham or the
other coaches, but remembers a di
vided team atmosphere, with some
teammates readily accepting of his
identity and others choosing to open
ly state their discomfort. He left the
team during his freshman year.
Slater is seen as one of the first
NCAA Division I football players
to announce that he was gay, but he
did not think his situation was
unique at the time or within his
sport.
"I was not the only one," Slater
said.

An Effort to Change A Culture
While Travlos and Wadden have
come out to their teammates and
coaches, they want to ensure that
any athlete can find that same com
fort and confidence. Along with Fet
ter, the pair made a presentation last
spring to Stanford Director of Athlet
ics Bob Bowlsby and proposed that
the Athletics Department institute
LGBT sensitivity training for its
coaches and staff
While Fetter has said that the envi
ronment within University locker
rooms and on Stanford playing fields
has been slow to change, the Athletics
Department has taken some initia
tive. In February, the department wel
comed an NCAA-sanctioned speak
er to lead a cultural diversity work
shop.
Senior Associate Athletics Direc
tor Earl Koberlein 'B6 said that sexu
al orientation in Stanford sports was
"not really an issue." In an email to
The Daily, Koberlein stated that the
University recruits individuals that
can excel academically and athletical
ly, regardless of sexual preference.
"Any student-athlete in need of
support is encouraged to meet with
Athletics Department or University
staffers who can provide needed sup
port, advice and connect them to Uni
versity resources as appropriate," he
said.

Some athletes are looking for the
Athletics Department to move be
yond their tacit acceptance of LGBT
athletes in varsity sports to actively
welcome them. While Koberlein was
not aware of any coaches making
public statements in support of gay or
lesbian athletes, the anonymous
women's basketball player believed
that a message from a Tara Van-
Derveer or a David Shaw could have
a profound effect on the perception
of LGBT participants in Stanford
sports.
Zeigler welcomed such state
ments. He hoped that a more open
environment within the Stanford
Athletics Department could convey
to closeted athletes that they would
be accepted and embraced by their
peers.
"A lot of people in sports don't

want to talk about this issue," Zeigler
said. "But when they're confronted
with a teammate coming out of the
closet, they are supportive, because
sports are about a few things. But at
the end of the day, [the team is] built to
win. As long as someone is contribut
ing to winning, that person can have
three legs or they can be purple."
This was something that Wadden
soon realized after coming out to her
coach and her teammates. While she
swam to two golds at the Canada
Cup, her biggest victory came outside
the pool when she revealed her iden
tity to Coach Maurer.
"It's okay, you're fine," her coach
said, wrapping her arms around Wad
den. "It's not that big of a deal."

Laura Wadden '09, a former swimmer, dedicated significant time to a
campaign against Prop. 8 in 2008. Her personal struggle to come out to
her coach and teammates, however, was fraught with uncertainty and fear.
The night before the 2008 Cana
da Cup, the final meet of the fall sea
son for the Stanford women's swim
ming team, Laura Wadden 'O9 lay in
bed awake.
Three weeks earlier, Wadden was
the poster child of a Stanford stu
dent campaign against Proposition
8, a California initiative to ban
same-sex marriage. She was left dev
astated by the results, as 52 percent
of state voters decided that mar
riage could only be between a man
and a woman.
In her Toronto hotel room, the
senior co-captain of the swimming
team was overcome with memories
and emotions of the past half-year.
She remembered imploring her fel
low students through a megaphone
to join her in the fight for equal
rights and recognition of same-sex
marriage. She recalled her encour
agement for her younger brother
Jack, a rower on the men's crew
team at Williams College, when he
told their parents the summer be
fore that he was gay.
But on Thanksgiving night in
2008, after months of supporting
others, Wadden wondered who
would be there for her.

The next day, she found her
coach, Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95, just

before the start of her first event.
"I'm bisexual," Wadden told her
coach.
At Stanford, coming out can still
be difficult, especially for athletes.
The University is home to about 800
varsity athletes, but only a handful
has come out while still representing
the Cardinal at the collegiate level.
It took Wadden four years to
confront her identity and tell her
coach, after questioning her own
sexuality since high school. Looking
back, she recalled her reasons for
closeting part of her identity for the
majority of her time at Stanford.
"I was just so scared," Wadden
said of the night before she con
fronted Maurer. "I didn't know if I
should come out or not, and I didn't
even know who to tell."
"Fear of the Unknown"
Wadden's situation is by no
means unique among Stanford ath
letes. Nor is it a development con
fined to the boundaries of the Farm.
Cyd Zeigler '95, founder of Out
sports.com, has heard hundreds of
stories of lesbian, gay, bisexual or
transsexual (LGBT) athletes at
every level of sport over 11 years of
running his website. He estimated
that the proportion of LGBT indi
viduals in sports was no less than
that in the world population, about 2
to 3 percent.

"That means there are hundreds
or thousands of collegiate athletes
who are gay," he said.
Across both amateur and profes
sional American sports, there has
been a slow outpouring of encour
agement for gay athletes. Prominent
sports figures, among them former
basketball star Charles Barkley and
various NFL players, have stated
their support and recognition of
LGBT issues. Some, like former Vil
lanova basketball player Will Sheri
dan, have chosen to come out after
keeping their sexual identities away
from the public eye.
Stories like these have been few
and far between at Stanford.
The University's nondiscrimina
tion policy protects against any un
lawful discrimination based on eth
nicity, gender, disability, religion or
sexual orientation in any school pro
gram or activity. Despite the stated
policies, Zeigler stated that closeted
student-athletes at Stanford main
tain a "fear of the unknown."
"You don't know for absolute
fact that your coach is going to ac
cept you and your teammates are
going to accept you," he said. "You
don't have it written in a contract
that these people are going to accept
you."

A Stigma in Stanford Sports?
Last Wednesday, eight current

and former Stanford athletes de
tailed their struggles on a panel for
LGBT issues in sports. Held by Safe
and Open Spaces at Stanford
(SOSAS), a group dedicated to
opening dialogue on queer issues,
the talk brought together athletes,
some out and some not, from across
several sports.
Sitting on couches in the
Women's Community Center, once
the rallying place for 2008's Prop. 8
protests, the athletes described their
internal struggles as gay lesbian or

bisexual in a realm that has not al
ways been welcoming of individuals
of all sexual orientations.

The organizer of that panel,
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-president of
Stanford Students for Queer Liber
ation (SSQL) and a Daily staffer,
said that some aspects of the Stan
ford Athletics Department lag be
hind the general campus attitudes
on LGBT issues. She cited the lack
of out athletes at the University as a

varsity swim team. Having won two golds at the Canada Cup, she said her
greatest victory was coming out to her coach Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95.
sign of the disparity.
"There's certainly a stigma asso
ciated with being gay, even being an
ally [of an LGBT student], and
being an athlete," she said.
While athletes on the panel were
quick to state that Stanford's stu
dent body and campus environment
have created a relatively welcoming
environment, some were still dis
comforted by the handling of LGBT
issues and the relative insensitivity
within their respective teams.
In an interview before her ap
pearance on the SOSAS panel,
Wadden recalled an instance during
her freshman year when some sen
ior swimmers joked about a team
mate who they thought was a les
bian.
"The fact they would laugh about
it made me feel that being a lesbian
would be an out-of-the-ordinary
thing that people wouldn't necessar
ily be cool with," she said.
One current Stanford women's
basketball player, who identified as
bisexual, did not feel that her team
mates were aware of the potential
harm created by fleeting insults
thrown around on the court. She did
not want to be identified because
she has not told her family of her
sexual identity.
"There are people on our team
who will say 'That's so gay,' or 'he's a
gay, she's a gay' and misuse the
word," she said.
Xanthe Travlos 'll, a field hock
ey player, came out to her team
mates in 2008 after becoming close
with another member of her team.
After concealing their relationship
for a year, she and her girlfriend
slowly come out to teammates,
which Travlos described as a "huge
relief."

But after a game against David
son College in October of that year,
Travlos heard the laughs and saw
the pointing from members of the
opposing team. As she and her girl
friend walked off the Stanford Var
sity Field Hockey Turf, which had
been sponsored in part by the Les
bian Equality Foundation of Silicon
Valley, Travlos realized that her
coming-out process would not be
without its difficulties.
She later traced the source of the
rumors to a member of the Stanford
coaching staff, who Travlos and her
girlfriend thought was someone
they could trust. That coach has
since left the team.
An Unprecedented Situation in the
Locker Room
While there has been no systemic
discrimination against individuals of
any sexual orientation in Stanford
sports, athletes said that it is often
the little things the insensitive re
marks among teammates or a
coach's inability to handle a situa
tion that convey that the Univer
sity's athletics programs do not yet
completely embrace LGBT partici

pants. Some, like Dwight Slater 'O2,
believe that homophobic aspects
have been ingrained in aspects of
sports culture.
In 1999, Slater, then a redshirt
freshman on the Stanford football
team, decided to relieve himself of a
burden that had weighed on his con
science since joining the Cardinal
that summer. A highly recruited of
fensive lineman from Florida, Slater
confronted then-head coach Tyrone
Willingham with a two-word state
ment not often heard in a football
locker room.
"I'm gay."
As a freshman, Slater struggled
with his own sexuality, his personal
relationship with his father and the
recent death of his mother. He saw
Stanford, more than 2,500 miles

away from home, as an escape.
But soon after arriving on cam
pus, Slater came to conclude that the
"hyper-masculine" nature of the
sport he played and his sexual iden
tity were not compatible. He often
found himself lying about where he
was going or what he was doing.
"The gay angle didn't fit in any
where, and I didn't know how to fit it
into my identity," he recalled. "I just
felt like a fraud the whole time."
In the most trying academic and
athletic environment he had ever
experienced, Slater was left alone on
the team, unable to confide in his
teammates or coaching staff. It took
months for him to tell Willingham, a
decision that only came after being
spurred on by the positive support
of a dorm event, "Crossing The
Line," in which he revealed his sexu
al identity to his fellow residents.
But when Slater later told his
head coach, he confided in a man
who he believed did not know how
to deal with such an unprecedented
situation.
"I don't think he was able to han
dle my situation," Slater said, "I was
n't able to handle it. At that time, I
don't think anybody had come out
on a team sport... He was willing
to work with me, but only on his
timeline."
Because his situation was so

unique, the football coaching staff
was neither trained nor prepared to
deal with his situation, inadvertently
making decisions that would force
Slater to come out to his father.
Looking back, Slater maintains
no ill will toward Willingham or the
other coaches, but remembers a di
vided team atmosphere, with some
teammates readily accepting of his
identity and others choosing to open
ly state their discomfort. He left the
team during his freshman year.
Slater is seen as one of the first
NCAA Division I football players
to announce that he was gay, but he
did not think his situation was
unique at the time or within his
sport.
"I was not the only one," Slater
said.
