# COMING OUT IN THE LOCKER ROOM
## Closeted Stanford athletes have 'fear of the unknown' 
### RYAN MAC SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The night before the 2008 Cana
da Cup, the final meet of the fall sea
son for the Stanford women's swim
ming team, Laura Wadden 'O9 lay in
bed awake.
Three weeks earlier, Wadden was
the poster child of a Stanford stu
dent campaign against Proposition
8, a California initiative to ban
same-sex marriage. She was left dev
astated by the results, as 52 percent
of state voters decided that mar
riage could only be between a man
and a woman.
In her Toronto hotel room, the
senior co-captain of the swimming
team was overcome with memories
and emotions of the past half-year.
She remembered imploring her fel
low students through a megaphone
to join her in the fight for equal
rights and recognition of same-sex
marriage. She recalled her encour
agement for her younger brother
Jack, a rower on the men's crew
team at Williams College, when he
told their parents the summer be
fore that he was gay.
But on Thanksgiving night in
2008, after months of supporting
others, Wadden wondered who
would be there for her.

The next day, she found her
coach, Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95, just

before the start of her first event.
"I'm bisexual," Wadden told her
coach.
At Stanford, coming out can still
be difficult, especially for athletes.
The University is home to about 800
varsity athletes, but only a handful
has come out while still representing
the Cardinal at the collegiate level.
It took Wadden four years to
confront her identity and tell her
coach, after questioning her own
sexuality since high school. Looking
back, she recalled her reasons for
closeting part of her identity for the
majority of her time at Stanford.
"I was just so scared," Wadden
said of the night before she con
fronted Maurer. "I didn't know if I
should come out or not, and I didn't
even know who to tell."
"Fear of the Unknown"
Wadden's situation is by no
means unique among Stanford ath
letes. Nor is it a development con
fined to the boundaries of the Farm.
Cyd Zeigler '95, founder of Out
sports.com, has heard hundreds of
stories of lesbian, gay, bisexual or
transsexual (LGBT) athletes at
every level of sport over 11 years of
running his website. He estimated
that the proportion of LGBT indi
viduals in sports was no less than
that in the world population, about 2
to 3 percent.

"That means there are hundreds
or thousands of collegiate athletes
who are gay," he said.
Across both amateur and profes
sional American sports, there has
been a slow outpouring of encour
agement for gay athletes. Prominent
sports figures, among them former
basketball star Charles Barkley and
various NFL players, have stated
their support and recognition of
LGBT issues. Some, like former Vil
lanova basketball player Will Sheri
dan, have chosen to come out after
keeping their sexual identities away
from the public eye.
Stories like these have been few
and far between at Stanford.
The University's nondiscrimina
tion policy protects against any un
lawful discrimination based on eth
nicity, gender, disability, religion or
sexual orientation in any school pro
gram or activity. Despite the stated
policies, Zeigler stated that closeted
student-athletes at Stanford main
tain a "fear of the unknown."
"You don't know for absolute
fact that your coach is going to ac
cept you and your teammates are
going to accept you," he said. "You
don't have it written in a contract
that these people are going to accept
you."

A Stigma in Stanford Sports?
Last Wednesday, eight current

and former Stanford athletes de
tailed their struggles on a panel for
LGBT issues in sports. Held by Safe
and Open Spaces at Stanford
(SOSAS), a group dedicated to
opening dialogue on queer issues,
the talk brought together athletes,
some out and some not, from across
several sports.
Sitting on couches in the
Women's Community Center, once
the rallying place for 2008's Prop. 8
protests, the athletes described their
internal struggles as gay lesbian or

bisexual in a realm that has not al
ways been welcoming of individuals
of all sexual orientations.

The organizer of that panel,
Holly Fetter 'l3, co-president of
Stanford Students for Queer Liber
ation (SSQL) and a Daily staffer,
said that some aspects of the Stan
ford Athletics Department lag be
hind the general campus attitudes
on LGBT issues. She cited the lack
of out athletes at the University as a

Laura Wadden '09, who identifies as bisexual, competed on the women's
varsity swim team. Having won two golds at the Canada Cup, she said her
greatest victory was coming out to her coach Lea Maurer '94 M.A. '95.
