## Do the Right Thing 
### BRANDON JACKSON, '12 Student Co-Chair, Board on Judicial Affairs 
/ / Te find beyond a rea
\A/ sonable doubt that
V V you violated the
Honor Code." These are the words
that no student ever hopes to hear.
However, as a judicial panelist for
the past two years, I've had the un
fortunate experience of informing
students that they have been found
responsible for violating the Honor
Code and/or the Fundamental
Standard.
Most students never plan to vio
late the HC or FS. Moreover, many

students fail to realize the actual im
plications of their actions until it's
far too late. As we finish up the
quarter and tackle our final exams,
projects and presentations, I offer
you a word of encouragement to
take extra precautions to avoid
making a mistake that could earn
you some very unfortunate conse
quences.
Now, I know what you're think
ing. "Brandon, Judicial Affairs
sucks! The process is too long, the
sanctions are too harsh and the staff

is simply out to get us." In my time
working with Judicial Affairs, I've
heard all of these complaints and
many more.
Regarding the length of the
process, there's no question that it's
currently too long. Cases often take
months on end to get resolved for
varying reasons. One can only try to
imagine the anxiety a responding
student goes through day in and day
out from the moment she receives
her first notice to the actual day of
the hearing.
And what about sanctions?
While the full range of the penalty
code ranges from a formal warning
to expulsion, the standard sanction
for first-time violations of the
Honor Code is a one quarter sus
pension and 40 hours of communi
ty service. For seniors and graduat
ing students, panels have typically
issued a two-quarter delay in con
ferral of their degree. Wanting to
get away from Stanford is one
thing. Being forced to take a break
is simply something you don't want
to be faced with.
Finally, before you give the staff
a hard time, I don't know anyone
who has a more stressful job on this
campus than the members of the
Office of Judicial Affairs. Nonethe
less, I can tell you this. If you ever
find yourself reporting or respond
ing to a possible violation, you will
be treated with the utmost respect
and care and will be guided through
a process that, in spite of its flaws, is
just and fair.
Am I here to scare you? Yes
but I'm also here to help you avoid
making a mistake that far too many
have already made before you. As
we go into this last week and you
find yourself in the middle of a
stressful situation with a tempting

or easy way out, I encourage you to
take a step back. There's no grade
or class worth jeopardizing your en
tire academic and/or professional
career. Talk to your peers (not
about your assignments), talk to
your professors, talk to me if you
want if you see the potential for
error. Not only can you prevent
yourself from making a mistake,
but you can also prevent others
from doing so too. If you see some
thing, say something before a viola
tion occurs.

Believe it or not, all of this
Honor Code jazz, along with the
current Judicial Charter, started
with us the students. A little less
than 100 years ago, we stepped up
and said that we were willing to
take responsibility for our actions
and to hold each other accountable.
That meant that regardless of who
we were, male, female, black, white,
athlete, international student,
wealthy, low-income, drama major
or CS, we were all accepted to this
great University and accepted the
condition of upholding the respect
and honor that sets this institution
apart from many others. It's be
cause of this declaration of integri
ty that our Stanford degrees still
mean something special in a world
filled with great lies and deceit.
I believe Spike Lee said it best
just "do the right thing" (notice
the quotes!).
