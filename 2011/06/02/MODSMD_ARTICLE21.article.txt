# FRESHLY BAKED
## Eat Together, Graduate Alone 
### Tim Moon 
People like to say that college is
the best time of your life. Four
years ago, as I lay in bed after
the first day of NSO, listening to the
quiet snores of my super awesome
roommate while reliving the crazi
ness of that first day in my head, I
knew there was no way that Stan
ford wouldn't end up being the best
time of my life.
Obviously, there were the aca
demics: like most everyone at Stan
ford, I was (and still am) a huge
dork, so I was crazy excited about
the variety and quality of classes
and about getting to be taught by
some of the most badass professors
in the world. There was our incredi
ble athletics program, with so many
great teams I could watch, many for
free. There were all the traditions
I'd heard so much about Full
Moon, Big Game, The Game, foun

tain hopping, Ski Trip, Exotic. And,
of course, there was the weather.
For someone who spent 18 years
growing up in Syracuse, one of the
snowiest cities in America, that in it
self was going to make these four
years awesome.
Four years later, I can say that
these four years have been the best
four years of my life, but it's not be
cause I found every class to be en
grossing and inspiring (IHUM sort
of dispelled that notion right away)
or because I got to see our football
team go from 4-8 my freshman year
to 12-1 this year (although that was
incredible) or because I got to do
every single tradition. Even the
weather didn't end up being all that
I'd hoped it would be, although that
was probably my fault for expecting
sunny, mid-70s weather year-round.
These four years have been the

best four years of my life because of
the people. Despite everything
there is to love about our academ
ics, weather and activities, what's
been more important have been the
people I've learned with, gone to
football games with, partied with
and shared meals with. I could go on
for pages about how fascinating,
how brilliant, how kind, how driven,
how creative, how diverse Stanford
students are, and getting to see this
firsthand, day after day, has been in
credible.
Which brings me to the title of my
final column "Eat Together,
Graduate Alone." It's a play on the
phrase live together, die alone (popu
larized by the cultural phenomenon
that was "Lost"), which has a couple
of possible readings. The first is that
we might live together, but all of us
die alone, in a metaphorical if not lit

eral sense. The second assumes an
implied "or" between the two state
ments, that if we don't live together,
we'll die alone. I much prefer the sec
ond reading, both because of how
depressing the first is and because of
how it highlights the importance of
community.
So we'll use that meaning eat
together, or graduate alone. Over
these past 15 weeks, almost every
column of mine has had some tie to
food (I'll admit that some of those
ties were a bit of a stretch hey,
just like this column's title!), and I
hoped to highlight the importance
of food in our lives, to highlight that,
in away, we really are what we eat.
However, more important than just
food itself are meals, when we share
food with people, Stanford students

However, more
important than just
food itself are meals,
when we share food
with people.
