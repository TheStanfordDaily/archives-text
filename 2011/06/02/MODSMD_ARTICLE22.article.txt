# OP-ED
## One step forward, two steps back 
### JUSTIN HEFTER '11 
When I came to Stanford as a
freshman in the fall of
2007,1 was shocked to see
the condition of the interfaith com
munity. Fragmented and scared, stu
dents would whisper about the
events of the previous year. Divest
ment, Muslims against Jews, Jews
against Jews. The anti-Israel divest
ment campaign of the previous year
had rocked the Stanford communi
ty. It drove people away from want
ing to learn about or discuss Israel,
drove Jewish students from wanting
to befriend Muslim students and
even drove Jews away from the Jew
ish community as a whole.

I was able to witness firsthand the
devastating effects of the 2006-07 di
vestment campaign, because I was
the only freshman to join the Stan
ford Israel Alliance. I joined be
cause, after facing anti-Semitic abuse
during high school, I found Israel
was the one place where I knew I
could be safe as a Jew, and I wanted a
place like that to exist for all people.
That's why I wanted to try to im
prove the condition between Jews
and Muslims on campus. I wanted to
make things friendlier, so that peo
ple did not have to be afraid to ex
press themselves, so that the discus
sion could be more positive. When I
discussed co-sponsoring a charity
drive for children in Israel and Gaza
with the Muslim Students Aware
ness Network my freshman year,
some of the Jewish/pro-Israel stu
dents looked at me like I was crazy.
Eventually we overcame the
emotional scars of divestment, and
the charity drive to send gift baskets
to children in Israel and Gaza went
forward. It was a major success be
cause it was a positive way to deal
with the conflict. Since then, the
number of Jewish and Muslim inter
faith events has increased. Political
disagreements surrounding Israel
have been handled in a more posi
tive light. We repeated the charity
drive my sophomore year and
launched an even more successful
microfinance campaign the year
after. The past few years have been a
huge step forward, but I fear that we
are on the verge of taking two steps
back.

This spring saw the initiation of a
renewed divestment campaign. Di
vestment calls to the University not
to do business with companies that
do business in Israel. While the cam
paign purports to be about a few
specific companies, in reality it is a
campaign to delegitimize Israel,
using literature from international
movements that try to convince
countries to boycott and sanction
the Jewish state. This campaign is di
visive because it places the blame
for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a
conflict that takes into account cen
turies of nuance, squarely on Israel's
shoulders. That's not fair; both sides
share responsibility.
Divestment aims to injure Israel
economically, without actually di
rectly helping the Palestinians. This
should be upsetting to anyone who
cares about Israel and also anyone
who cares about the Palestinians.
We should work toward change that
helps both sides of the conflict, not
simply injure one side or the other.
Regardless of our politics, the
campaign of divisiveness that is in
the process of being put forth can
only have destructive outcomes. We
don't know how our actions on cam
pus will affect a faraway conflict in
the Middle East, but we do know
what our actions will do to this com
munity. Therefore, the best solution
is for the people with different polit
ical views to come together and find
creative solutions to those disagree
ments that will help achieve a real
and lasting peace for the Middle
East and for all of the communities
on this campus. We do not need to
replicate the animosity in the Mid
dle East in order to make produc
tive change. I have faith that if any
where in the world there is a place
where Muslims, Jews and people of
all religious and political disposi
tions can come together to find con
structive solutions to the Middle
East conflict, it is Stanford Universi
ty. I implore you, Stanford Universi
ty, do not let this campus go back to
the way things were. We have
changed, and we are so much better
than divestment.
