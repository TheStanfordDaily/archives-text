## ONE WIN SHORT KLAHN, THACHER BESTED IN NCAA DOUBLES FINAL 
### ALEX ECKERT DASH DAVIDSON 
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher had plen
ty to prove as the NCAA Men's Tennis Tourna
ment reached its last few days of individual
competition. The two juniors were Stanford's
lone representatives in the singles and doubles
draw after a heartbreaking loss to Virginia in
the team competition and were the only Cardi
nal men left to defend Stanford's home court at
Taube Tennis Center. Klahn was defending his
singles title from last season, and Thacher was
coming off a disappointing first-round loss on
Wednesday and together, the pair was looking
to show they could get farther than the doubles
semifinal, where they were eliminated last year.
Despite all they had to show, their season
didn't end quite the way they wanted it to.
Klahn was knocked out of the singles draw in
Saturday's quarterfinals by No. 3 seed Rhyne
Williams of Tennessee. In doubles, the No. 3-
seeded Klahn/Thacher pair succeeded in ad
vancing past the semis, but lost in a tough final
match to No. 4-seeded Jeff Dadamo and Austin
Krajicek of Texas A&M.

Coming into the round of 16 on Friday,
Klahn was ranked No. 9 in the tournament field
and had only dropped one match in the past two
months a tough 7-6 (5), 6-5 loss to top
ranked Steve Johnson of USC in the Pac-10
Championship final. Stanford's top player had
shown no signs of slowing, winning his first two
matches of the tournament in two sets apiece.
Klahn's Friday match came against the
scrappy Jose Flernandez of North Carolina,
ranked No. 22 in the country. Klahn started the
match well, taking the first set 6-3, but then Her
nandez turned up the heat. Hernandez domi
nated the second set 6-3 and had Klahn running
all over the court, playing much more defensive
tennis than is characteristic of the hard-hitting
junior. Hernandez continued to control the
match and broke early in the third set. When
Hernandez was serving up 4-3 in the third set, it
seemed increasingly likely that Klahn's title de
fense was over. However, with his back against
the wall, Klahn responded forcefully. Klahn
won almost every point of the rest of the match
and broke Hernandez's serve twice en route to
a 6-3,3-6,6-4 victory.
"When he was serving at 4-3,1 told myself to
get strong in the legs and just make sure I get my
feet under every ball," Klahn said. "Then I start
ed getting behind the balls and getting more
pace and more depth and was able to draw some
errors out of him. That was the key right there. I
was working the tactics better. I came out on the
offensive more and played more aggressively
the last three games."
Moving on to the quarterfinals, Klahn faced
No. 4 Rhyne Williams of Tennessee. In chilly and
windy conditions, Klahn never seemed to be

able to get into the match. He played well, but
was broken early in both sets and was always
playing from behind. That turned out to be the
difference, as Williams secured a 6-4,6-4 victory.
"Obviously, it was a tough match," Klahn
said. "I thought Rhyne served well and that was
probably the difference. I'm normally pretty
comfortable returning, so that was tough on me.
It was a little breezy out there, and the way he
plays, with a real good forehand, he kind of
draws you into some errors. I never really found
my range and started off a little sluggish...
Rhyne played well; he's a great player, and best
of luck to him."
"I played unbelievable, and I served out of
my mind," Williams said after knocking out the
defending champion. "I don't think Bradley
came out too ready or that he really liked the
conditions out here today. Luckily for me, he
was a little sloppy and missed some balls. He's a

great guy and we've always been really good
friends growing up. I know his game really well
and he knows my game really well, so it was a
fun match."
Williams would go on to lose in the final to
Johnson who, despite losing the first set,
brought home a 4-6,6-2,6-1 victory for USC.
In doubles, Klahn and Thacher survived an
up-and-down match against Tulsa's No. 24
squad of Clifford Muarsland and Ashley
Watling on Friday, winning 7-5, 6-1. The Stan
ford duo went up early 2-0, then seemed to lose
energy and dropped three straight games.
Down 5-4 in the set and 40-0 in the game,
Thacher ripped a backhand return down the
line for a winner, an incredible shot that
pumped up the Stanford juniors and shifted the
momentum of the match in their favor. Klahn

draw following a heartbreaking loss in team competition. The pair came just short, losing in the final.
and Thacher won nine of the last
ten games of the match after that
point to move on to the quarterfi
nals.
"It's funny how doubles works,"
Klahn said. "The momentum
changes are so sudden. It can
change at any moment. I thought
that we picked it up in the second
set and were able to hold our serves
easier. We made a few too many er
rors in the beginning, but then we
cleaned it up as the match went on."
Although Klahn lost in singles on
Saturday, he still joined Thacher
later that afternoon in the doubles
semifinal to take on the No. 13 team
in the country Florida State's
duo of Vahid Mirzadeh and Connor
Smith. After dropping the first set,
Klahn and Thacher took control of
the match and proceeded to win 6-
7 (3), 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the
semis.
"They were really scrappy, and
the conditions were tough out there
today," Thacher said. "During the
first set, we were taking care of our
serve pretty well but couldn't find
the court on returns. We really just
tried to stay focused and have con
fidence knowing it would come.
Midway through the second set,
things turned a little bit and we
found our range a little more. I
think we started to put together
some better points, and things went
our way in the end."
After dispatching Florida State,
the Cardinal doubles team had to
go up another team from the Sun
shine State the No. 17 Florida
Gators' doubles squad of Sekou
Bangoura Jr. and Alexandre
Lacroix. In a long, back-and-forth
match, Stanford defeated Florida in
three grueling sets, 4-6,6-3,7-6 (4).
The three-setter was the second in
as many days for the Klahn and
Thacher duo, leaving the two jun
iors very happy to find themselves
in the final for the first time.
"It was obviously a tough match
coming down to the tiebreaker in
the final set, it can't get any closer
than that," Klahn said. "We fought
back in the second set and started
stepping it up. Florida made a few
more errors than they did in the
first then the third set was just a
dogfight."
Sunday's semifinal win set the
Cardinal team up for a finals
matchup Dadamo and Krajicek on
Monday afternoon. After dropping
a very tight first set to the Texas
duo, Klahn and Thacher found the

momentum slipping to the opposite
side of the net. They vainly tried to
rally back from the set deficit, only
to find the match and the title
already out of their reach. The
Aggie team closed out the match in
straight sets, 7-6 (4), 6-3.
Thacher was disappointed after
the match, upset to squander the
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of
home-court advantage in the
NCAA Tournament.
"We were excited to go out and
play the match," he said. "We knew
we needed to execute the game
plan. We got off to a good start, but,
unfortunately, it went to a tiebreak
er where anything can happen. We
just couldn't quite execute, but give
the Texas A&M guys credit; they
played a great match."
Even with the defeat, Klahn and
Thacher have made a strong state
ment with their doubles play this
season. They went 43-8 on the year,
bringing in three tournament titles
along the way from the Pacific
Coast Doubles, Sherwood Cup and
ITA National Indoor Champi
onships Consolation.
With another year left at the
Farm, the duo still has the chance to
go one step further in the tourna
ment and claim their first national
title.

Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher had plen

Despite all they had to show, their season

Klahn was knocked out of the singles draw in
Saturday's quarterfinals by No. 3 seed Rhyne

match to No. 4-seeded Jeff Dadamo and Austin
Krajicek of Texas A&M.

Coming into the round of 16 on Friday,
Klahn was ranked No. 9 in the tournament field
and had only dropped one match in the past two
months a tough 7-6 (5), 6-5 loss to top
ranked Steve Johnson of USC in the Pac-10
Championship final. Stanford's top player had
shown no signs of slowing, winning his first two
matches of the tournament in two sets apiece.
Klahn's Friday match came against the
scrappy Jose Flernandez of North Carolina,
ranked No. 22 in the country. Klahn started the

and he knows my game really well, so it was a
fun match."
Williams would go on to lose in the final to
Johnson who, despite losing the first set,
brought home a 4-6,6-2,6-1 victory for USC.
In doubles, Klahn and Thacher survived an
up-and-down match against Tulsa's No. 24
squad of Clifford Muarsland and Ashley
Watling on Friday, winning 7-5, 6-1. The Stan
ford duo went up early 2-0, then seemed to lose

and Thacher won nine of the last
ten games of the match after that
point to move on to the quarterfi
nals.
"It's funny how doubles works,"
Klahn said. "The momentum
changes are so sudden. It can
change at any moment. I thought
that we picked it up in the second
set and were able to hold our serves
easier. We made a few too many er
rors in the beginning, but then we
cleaned it up as the match went on."
Although Klahn lost in singles on
Saturday, he still joined Thacher
later that afternoon in the doubles
semifinal to take on the No. 13 team
in the country Florida State's
duo of Vahid Mirzadeh and Connor
Smith. After dropping the first set,
Klahn and Thacher took control of
the match and proceeded to win 6-
7 (3), 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the
semis.
"They were really scrappy, and
the conditions were tough out there
today," Thacher said. "During the
first set, we were taking care of our
serve pretty well but couldn't find
the court on returns. We really just
tried to stay focused and have con
fidence knowing it would come.
Midway through the second set,
things turned a little bit and we
found our range a little more. I
think we started to put together
some better points, and things went
our way in the end."
After dispatching Florida State,
the Cardinal doubles team had to
go up another team from the Sun
shine State the No. 17 Florida
Gators' doubles squad of Sekou
Bangoura Jr. and Alexandre
Lacroix. In a long, back-and-forth
match, Stanford defeated Florida in
three grueling sets, 4-6,6-3,7-6 (4).
The three-setter was the second in
as many days for the Klahn and
Thacher duo, leaving the two jun
iors very happy to find themselves
in the final for the first time.
"It was obviously a tough match
coming down to the tiebreaker in
the final set, it can't get any closer
than that," Klahn said. "We fought
back in the second set and started
stepping it up. Florida made a few
more errors than they did in the
first then the third set was just a
dogfight."
Sunday's semifinal win set the
Cardinal team up for a finals
matchup Dadamo and Krajicek on
Monday afternoon. After dropping
a very tight first set to the Texas
duo, Klahn and Thacher found the

momentum slipping to the opposite
side of the net. They vainly tried to
rally back from the set deficit, only
to find the match and the title
already out of their reach. The
Aggie team closed out the match in
straight sets, 7-6 (4), 6-3.
Thacher was disappointed after
the match, upset to squander the
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of
home-court advantage in the
NCAA Tournament.
"We were excited to go out and
play the match," he said. "We knew
we needed to execute the game
plan. We got off to a good start, but,
unfortunately, it went to a tiebreak
er where anything can happen. We
just couldn't quite execute, but give
the Texas A&M guys credit; they
played a great match."
Even with the defeat, Klahn and
Thacher have made a strong state
ment with their doubles play this
season. They went 43-8 on the year,
bringing in three tournament titles
along the way from the Pacific
Coast Doubles, Sherwood Cup and
ITA National Indoor Champi
onships Consolation.
With another year left at the
Farm, the duo still has the chance to
go one step further in the tourna
ment and claim their first national
title.

RYAN THACHER
Bradley Klahn and Ryan Thacher had plen
ty to prove as the NCAA Men's Tennis Tourna
ment reached its last few days of individual
competition. The two juniors were Stanford's
lone representatives in the singles and doubles
draw after a heartbreaking loss to Virginia in
the team competition and were the only Cardi
nal men left to defend Stanford's home court at
Taube Tennis Center. Klahn was defending his
singles title from last season, and Thacher was
coming off a disappointing first-round loss on
Wednesday and together, the pair was looking
to show they could get farther than the doubles
semifinal, where they were eliminated last year.
Despite all they had to show, their season
didn't end quite the way they wanted it to.
Klahn was knocked out of the singles draw in
Saturday's quarterfinals by No. 3 seed Rhyne
Williams of Tennessee. In doubles, the No. 3-
seeded Klahn/Thacher pair succeeded in ad
vancing past the semis, but lost in a tough final
match to No. 4-seeded Jeff Dadamo and Austin
Krajicek of Texas A&M.

Coming into the round of 16 on Friday,
Klahn was ranked No. 9 in the tournament field
and had only dropped one match in the past two
months a tough 7-6 (5), 6-5 loss to top
ranked Steve Johnson of USC in the Pac-10
Championship final. Stanford's top player had
shown no signs of slowing, winning his first two
matches of the tournament in two sets apiece.
Klahn's Friday match came against the
scrappy Jose Flernandez of North Carolina,
ranked No. 22 in the country. Klahn started the
match well, taking the first set 6-3, but then Her
nandez turned up the heat. Hernandez domi
nated the second set 6-3 and had Klahn running
all over the court, playing much more defensive
tennis than is characteristic of the hard-hitting
junior. Hernandez continued to control the
match and broke early in the third set. When
Hernandez was serving up 4-3 in the third set, it
seemed increasingly likely that Klahn's title de
fense was over. However, with his back against
the wall, Klahn responded forcefully. Klahn
won almost every point of the rest of the match
and broke Hernandez's serve twice en route to
a 6-3,3-6,6-4 victory.
"When he was serving at 4-3,1 told myself to
get strong in the legs and just make sure I get my
feet under every ball," Klahn said. "Then I start
ed getting behind the balls and getting more
pace and more depth and was able to draw some
errors out of him. That was the key right there. I
was working the tactics better. I came out on the
offensive more and played more aggressively
the last three games."
Moving on to the quarterfinals, Klahn faced
No. 4 Rhyne Williams of Tennessee. In chilly and
windy conditions, Klahn never seemed to be

able to get into the match. He played well, but
was broken early in both sets and was always
playing from behind. That turned out to be the
difference, as Williams secured a 6-4,6-4 victory.
"Obviously, it was a tough match," Klahn
said. "I thought Rhyne served well and that was
probably the difference. I'm normally pretty
comfortable returning, so that was tough on me.
It was a little breezy out there, and the way he
plays, with a real good forehand, he kind of
draws you into some errors. I never really found
my range and started off a little sluggish...
Rhyne played well; he's a great player, and best
of luck to him."
"I played unbelievable, and I served out of
my mind," Williams said after knocking out the
defending champion. "I don't think Bradley
came out too ready or that he really liked the
conditions out here today. Luckily for me, he
was a little sloppy and missed some balls. He's a

great guy and we've always been really good
friends growing up. I know his game really well
and he knows my game really well, so it was a
fun match."
Williams would go on to lose in the final to
Johnson who, despite losing the first set,
brought home a 4-6,6-2,6-1 victory for USC.

play the match," he said. "We knew
we needed to execute the game
plan. We got off to a good start, but,
unfortunately, it went to a tiebreak
er where anything can happen. We
just couldn't quite execute, but give
the Texas A&M guys credit; they
played a great match."
Even with the defeat, Klahn and
Thacher have made a strong state
ment with their doubles play this
season. They went 43-8 on the year,
bringing in three tournament titles
along the way from the Pacific
Coast Doubles, Sherwood Cup and
ITA National Indoor Champi
onships Consolation.
With another year left at the
Farm, the duo still has the chance to
go one step further in the tourna
ment and claim their first national
title.
