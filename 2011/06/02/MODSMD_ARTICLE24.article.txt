# Five years of Card memories
## 
### Daniel Bohm On My Mind 
All good things must
come to an end. Or
something like that. For
me, college gets to end a
second time, which
means I get to write a second farewell
column. I'm pretty sure I wrote one
last year, when I graduated from Stan
ford for the first time, but I don't re
member it, so I guess it wasn't very
memorable I'll try to make this one
better.
I've been here at Stanford for a
while. Five years in fact. When I came
to Stanford, the football team was ter
rible, the iPhone didn't exist and Bran
ner was still an all-freshman dorm. I
guess you can say things have changed
a bit. So I'd like to take this opportuni
ty to look back at some of the best
Stanford sports moments of the last
five years moments I will never for
get and times that made being a Daily
sportswriter the fun that it was.
During my freshman year, as I
mentioned, the football team was not
very good. In fact, it went 1-11, and I
don't think the Cardinal offense
scored a touchdown in a home game
during the school year. The men's bas
ketball team, however, was competi
tive (it ended up making the NCAA
Tournament as an 11-seed). It was
back when people actually went to
basketball games and the Sixth Man
Club's bogus slogan about being the
best student section in the country ac
tually made a semblance of sense.
No. 2 U CLA came to Maples Pavil
ion, and since my group of friends al-

ways stood in the front row of the stu
dent section, we camped outside
Maples the night before (and may or
may not have found our ways into
some hot tubs on that side of campus).
We weren't the only ones there
were actually about a dozen tents out
there that night. UCLA looked to be
blowing the Cardinal out, but "Down
town" Kenny Brown hit a three right
before halftime, cutting the Bruins'
lead to 12 before Lawrence Hill and
Anthony Goods went bananas in the
second half —there was a game-tying
three banked in by Hill I think and
next thing you knew, the crowd was
mobbing the court.
My sophomore year may have
been the most enjoyable collective
sports-watching year for me. It began
in the fall with a road trip with two
buddies, because heck, going to Los
Angeles to party for the weekend
sounded like fun. What was more fun
than partying was seeing the devastat
ed faces of USC fans who couldn't be
lieve their Trojans, who were 41-point
favorites, had just lost at home to Stan
ford. I remember being in my seat,
which was practically in San Diego
County, with about 100 other Stanford
fans and the band just going nuts, not
knowing if anyone anywhere could
hear us but we didn't care.
Also, the men's basketball team's
best season while I was at Stanford
was my sophomore year. Brook
Lopez was an All-American and the
team basically ran one play, which
meant Mitch Johnson fed Lopez the
ball on the right block about 489 times
a game. In baseball, the Cardinal went
to the College World Series and in the
first game of the whole series, Stanford
picked Florida State apart. Current
San Francisco Giants catcher Buster
Posey came in to pitch for FSU in a 5-
5 tie in the top of the ninth by the
time the Seminoles came to the plate
again, it was 16-5 Stanford.
I was there, along with about six
other non-parent Stanford fans, and
I'm not sure there is a better sports en
vironment anywhere than the College
World Series. Friendly Omaha-ians,

good barbeque, crazy LSU fans and
baseball what could be better?
That season also included a series
win over No. 1 Arizona State at
Sunken Diamond in which then-Sun
Devil coach Pat Murphy had an epic
meltdown and challenged fans to a
fight after being shut out in a Saturday
blowout Cardinal win.
The great moments continued
throughout my last three years. Re
turning to the L.A. Coliseum my senior
year to witness the dismantling of the
Trojan empire, watching Bradley
Klahn play in the first round of the 2010
U.S. Open, seeing the women's basket
ball team end UConn's absurd winning
streak, going to the Sun Bowl and, even
more awesome, the Orange Bowl.
I've watched sports my entire life
and been to hundreds of sporting
events, but there is nothing like root
ing on your school. No atmosphere in
the world matches that mix of energy,
naivety and youthful exuberance
(and, often, alcohol).
You are supposed to take what you
learn in college and use it in the real
world or at least that's what you're
told. Unfortunately, college sporting
events will always remain in college
and we students will keep getting
older. Hopefully the memories will re
main.

last year, when I graduated from Stan
ford for the first time, but I don't re
member it, so I guess it wasn't very
memorable I'll try to make this one
better.
I've been here at Stanford for a
while. Five years in fact. When I came
to Stanford, the football team was ter
rible, the iPhone didn't exist and Bran
ner was still an all-freshman dorm. I
guess you can say things have changed
a bit. So I'd like to take this opportuni
ty to look back at some of the best
Stanford sports moments of the last
five years moments I will never for
get and times that made being a Daily
sportswriter the fun that it was.
During my freshman year, as I
mentioned, the football team was not
very good. In fact, it went 1-11, and I
don't think the Cardinal offense
scored a touchdown in a home game
during the school year. The men's bas
ketball team, however, was competi
tive (it ended up making the NCAA
Tournament as an 11-seed). It was
back when people actually went to
basketball games and the Sixth Man
Club's bogus slogan about being the
best student section in the country ac
tually made a semblance of sense.
No. 2 U CLA came to Maples Pavil
ion, and since my group of friends al-

ways stood in the front row of the stu
dent section, we camped outside
Maples the night before (and may or
may not have found our ways into
some hot tubs on that side of campus).
We weren't the only ones there
were actually about a dozen tents out
there that night. UCLA looked to be
blowing the Cardinal out, but "Down
town" Kenny Brown hit a three right
before halftime, cutting the Bruins'
lead to 12 before Lawrence Hill and
Anthony Goods went bananas in the
second half —there was a game-tying
three banked in by Hill I think and
next thing you knew, the crowd was
mobbing the court.
My sophomore year may have
been the most enjoyable collective
sports-watching year for me. It began
in the fall with a road trip with two
buddies, because heck, going to Los
Angeles to party for the weekend
sounded like fun. What was more fun
than partying was seeing the devastat
ed faces of USC fans who couldn't be
lieve their Trojans, who were 41-point
favorites, had just lost at home to Stan
ford. I remember being in my seat,
which was practically in San Diego
County, with about 100 other Stanford
fans and the band just going nuts, not
knowing if anyone anywhere could
hear us but we didn't care.
Also, the men's basketball team's
best season while I was at Stanford
was my sophomore year. Brook
Lopez was an All-American and the
team basically ran one play, which
meant Mitch Johnson fed Lopez the
ball on the right block about 489 times
a game. In baseball, the Cardinal went
to the College World Series and in the
first game of the whole series, Stanford
picked Florida State apart. Current
San Francisco Giants catcher Buster
Posey came in to pitch for FSU in a 5-
5 tie in the top of the ninth by the
time the Seminoles came to the plate
again, it was 16-5 Stanford.
I was there, along with about six
other non-parent Stanford fans, and
I'm not sure there is a better sports en
vironment anywhere than the College
World Series. Friendly Omaha-ians,

good barbeque, crazy LSU fans and
baseball what could be better?
That season also included a series
win over No. 1 Arizona State at
Sunken Diamond in which then-Sun
Devil coach Pat Murphy had an epic
meltdown and challenged fans to a
fight after being shut out in a Saturday
blowout Cardinal win.
The great moments continued
throughout my last three years. Re
turning to the L.A. Coliseum my senior
year to witness the dismantling of the
Trojan empire, watching Bradley
Klahn play in the first round of the 2010
U.S. Open, seeing the women's basket
ball team end UConn's absurd winning
streak, going to the Sun Bowl and, even
more awesome, the Orange Bowl.
I've watched sports my entire life
and been to hundreds of sporting
events, but there is nothing like root
ing on your school. No atmosphere in
the world matches that mix of energy,
naivety and youthful exuberance
(and, often, alcohol).
You are supposed to take what you
learn in college and use it in the real
world or at least that's what you're
told. Unfortunately, college sporting
events will always remain in college
and we students will keep getting
older. Hopefully the memories will re
main.

Daniel Bohm actually shed a tear
while writing this, his last Stanford
Daily column. Reminisce about your

There is
nothing like
rooting on
your school.
