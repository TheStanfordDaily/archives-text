# Bring on the playoffs
## BASEBALL TOPS CAL AS POSTSEASON LOOMS 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After sweeping the Cat Bears to
close the regular season last
weekend, the Stanford baseball
team finished the year with a win
ning conference record and se
cured its place in the postseason.
The Cardinal will travel to Cal
State-Fullerton this weekend to
open the NCAA Baseball Cham
pionship as the No. 2 seed in the
Fullerton Regional.
The No. 24 Cardinal (32-20,14-
12 Pac-10) blew through the last
weekend series of the Pac-10 sea
son by riding some excellent
pitching to grab 3-2 and 4-2 wins
over No. 23 Cal (31-20,13-13) be
fore the third and final game of
the series was cancelled due to
rain with the Cardinal leading 7-1
in the fourth inning.
On Friday, sophomore
righthander Mark Appel pitched

7.1 innings while giving up just
two runs and no walks to outduel
Cal starter Erik Johnson, who
struck out 11 Cardinal batters in
seven innings of work. Appel
handed the ball to junior closer
Chris Reed to finish the Stanford
victory.

Once again, Reed was excel
lent. The lefty weaved his way
through the last 1.2 innings to col
lect his seventh save of the sea
son.
Sophomore left fielder Tyler
Gaffney paced the Cardinal of
fense on Friday, going 2-for-4 and
knocking in a pair of runs.
The pitching was the story
again in the first game of a sched

uled doubleheader on Saturday,
when junior righty Jordan Pries
tossed 7.1 innings while allowing
just two unearned runs before
getting into a spot of trouble in
the eighth, when he was forced to
hand the ball to Reed.
Reed came in with a 4-2 lead,
but after a wild pitch, runners
stood at second and third. Reed
induced a ground ball to first
base, and senior catcher Zach
Jones received the throw and
smartly blocked the plate to pre
vent a run from scoring and get
the second out of the inning. Reed
induced a fly ball to end the
eighth, then a double play to end
the ninth. He picked up his eighth
save of the year and preserved
Pries' win.

run and extending his current hit
ting streak to 17. Freshman right
fielder Austin Wilson matched
Cal's offensive output all on his
own, driving home two runs on
three hits.
Overall, Stanford is 27-1 when
leading after seven innings this sea
son, mostly thanks to Reed's left
arm. His pitching has garnered the
attention of many major league
scouts, who turned out in droves to
watch this weekend's series.
The Cardinal stormed out of the
gates in the second game of the
doubleheader and was leading 7-1
in the bottom of the fourth inning,
after bashing around Cal pitchers
Dixon Anderson and Kevin Miller
for nine hits and five walks, before
the game was called due to rain.
With the two victories, the Car
dinal finished at fifth place in the
powerful Pac-10 with a 14-12 con
ference record and will head to
Fullerton for the second year in a
row to start the postseason. No. 1
regional seed Cal State-Fullerton
had a phenomenal 40-15 record this
year to capture the Big West Con
ference title and the right to host
the four-team, double-elimination
regional for the tenth time in the
last 11 years. The Titans welcome in
the Cardinal as the No. 2 seed,
Kansas State (36-23) as the No. 3
seed and Illinois (28-25) as the No.
4 seed.
Stanford and Cal State-Fuller
ton have a long history, with the
Cardinal holding the all-time series

record, 53-42. To add to the rivalry,
this is the third time in the past four
years that the teams could square
off in the postseason, as the Titans
eliminated Stanford from the post
season last year with a 6-5 victory in
the Fullerton regional. Stanford
eliminated Fullerton with two wins
in the 2008 Super Regional on the
Titans' home field.
But before Stanford can take on
one of its fiercest nemeses, it must
pass through Kansas State, which
received an at-large bid to the tour
nament after it lost the Big 12
Championship in extra innings to
Texas A&M. The Wildcats earned
their third consecutive regional bid
and are led by brothers Jason and
Jared King, who combined for 18
home runs this year. Jason leads the
team with a .608 slugging percent
age, followed by younger brother
Jared and his .547 slugging percent
age.
But Kansas State doesn't tout a
terrifying pitching staff, as every
player who has started a game for
the Cats this year has an ERA
above 4.26 fact that seems to
bode well for a Stanford team that
bats .298 as a team, with Gaffney's
hitting streak, sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty batting a
team-high .361 and Zach Jones
boasting a .323 batting average in
his last 36 games after he started the
season hitting just .130 through 16
games.
The Cardinal opens up the dou
ble-elimination regional tourna
ment at Goodwin Field in Fullerton
at 4 p.m. on Friday against the
Kansas State Wildcats.

run and extending his current hit
ting streak to 17. Freshman right
fielder Austin Wilson matched
Cal's offensive output all on his
own, driving home two runs on
three hits.
Overall, Stanford is 27-1 when
leading after seven innings this sea
son, mostly thanks to Reed's left
arm. His pitching has garnered the
attention of many major league
scouts, who turned out in droves to
watch this weekend's series.
The Cardinal stormed out of the
gates in the second game of the
doubleheader and was leading 7-1
in the bottom of the fourth inning,
after bashing around Cal pitchers
Dixon Anderson and Kevin Miller
for nine hits and five walks, before
the game was called due to rain.
With the two victories, the Car
dinal finished at fifth place in the
powerful Pac-10 with a 14-12 con
ference record and will head to
Fullerton for the second year in a
row to start the postseason. No. 1
regional seed Cal State-Fullerton
had a phenomenal 40-15 record this
year to capture the Big West Con
ference title and the right to host
the four-team, double-elimination
regional for the tenth time in the
last 11 years. The Titans welcome in
the Cardinal as the No. 2 seed,
Kansas State (36-23) as the No. 3
seed and Illinois (28-25) as the No.
4 seed.
Stanford and Cal State-Fuller
ton have a long history, with the
Cardinal holding the all-time series

record, 53-42. To add to the rivalry,
this is the third time in the past four
years that the teams could square
off in the postseason, as the Titans
eliminated Stanford from the post
season last year with a 6-5 victory in
the Fullerton regional. Stanford
eliminated Fullerton with two wins
in the 2008 Super Regional on the
Titans' home field.
But before Stanford can take on
one of its fiercest nemeses, it must
pass through Kansas State, which
received an at-large bid to the tour
nament after it lost the Big 12
Championship in extra innings to
Texas A&M. The Wildcats earned
their third consecutive regional bid
and are led by brothers Jason and
Jared King, who combined for 18
home runs this year. Jason leads the
team with a .608 slugging percent
age, followed by younger brother
Jared and his .547 slugging percent
age.
But Kansas State doesn't tout a
terrifying pitching staff, as every
player who has started a game for
the Cats this year has an ERA
above 4.26 fact that seems to
bode well for a Stanford team that
bats .298 as a team, with Gaffney's
hitting streak, sophomore third
baseman Stephen Piscotty batting a
team-high .361 and Zach Jones
boasting a .323 batting average in
his last 36 games after he started the
season hitting just .130 through 16
games.
The Cardinal opens up the dou
ble-elimination regional tourna
ment at Goodwin Field in Fullerton
at 4 p.m. on Friday against the
Kansas State Wildcats.

After sweeping the Cat Bears to
close the regular season last
weekend, the Stanford baseball
team finished the year with a win
ning conference record and se
cured its place in the postseason.
The Cardinal will travel to Cal
State-Fullerton this weekend to
open the NCAA Baseball Cham
pionship as the No. 2 seed in the
Fullerton Regional.
The No. 24 Cardinal (32-20,14-
12 Pac-10) blew through the last
weekend series of the Pac-10 sea
son by riding some excellent
pitching to grab 3-2 and 4-2 wins
over No. 23 Cal (31-20,13-13) be
fore the third and final game of
the series was cancelled due to
rain with the Cardinal leading 7-1
in the fourth inning.
On Friday, sophomore
righthander Mark Appel pitched

7.1 innings while giving up just
two runs and no walks to outduel
Cal starter Erik Johnson, who
struck out 11 Cardinal batters in
seven innings of work. Appel
handed the ball to junior closer
Chris Reed to finish the Stanford
victory.

Once again, Reed was excel
lent. The lefty weaved his way
through the last 1.2 innings to col
lect his seventh save of the sea
son.
Sophomore left fielder Tyler
Gaffney paced the Cardinal of
fense on Friday, going 2-for-4 and
knocking in a pair of runs.
The pitching was the story
again in the first game of a sched

uled doubleheader on Saturday,
when junior righty Jordan Pries
tossed 7.1 innings while allowing
just two unearned runs before
getting into a spot of trouble in
the eighth, when he was forced to
hand the ball to Reed.
Reed came in with a 4-2 lead,
but after a wild pitch, runners
stood at second and third. Reed
induced a ground ball to first
base, and senior catcher Zach
Jones received the throw and
smartly blocked the plate to pre
vent a run from scoring and get
the second out of the inning. Reed
induced a fly ball to end the
