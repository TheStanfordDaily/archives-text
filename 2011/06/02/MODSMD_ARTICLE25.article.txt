## BASEBALL TOPS CAL AS POSTSEASON LOOMS 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After sweeping the Cat Bears to
close the regular season last
weekend, the Stanford baseball
team finished the year with a win
ning conference record and se
cured its place in the postseason.
The Cardinal will travel to Cal
State-Fullerton this weekend to
open the NCAA Baseball Cham
pionship as the No. 2 seed in the
Fullerton Regional.
The No. 24 Cardinal (32-20,14-
12 Pac-10) blew through the last
weekend series of the Pac-10 sea
son by riding some excellent
pitching to grab 3-2 and 4-2 wins
over No. 23 Cal (31-20,13-13) be
fore the third and final game of
the series was cancelled due to
rain with the Cardinal leading 7-1
in the fourth inning.
On Friday, sophomore
righthander Mark Appel pitched

7.1 innings while giving up just
two runs and no walks to outduel
Cal starter Erik Johnson, who
struck out 11 Cardinal batters in
seven innings of work. Appel
handed the ball to junior closer
Chris Reed to finish the Stanford
victory.

Once again, Reed was excel
lent. The lefty weaved his way
through the last 1.2 innings to col
lect his seventh save of the sea
son.
Sophomore left fielder Tyler
Gaffney paced the Cardinal of
fense on Friday, going 2-for-4 and
knocking in a pair of runs.
The pitching was the story
again in the first game of a sched

uled doubleheader on Saturday,
when junior righty Jordan Pries
tossed 7.1 innings while allowing
just two unearned runs before
getting into a spot of trouble in
the eighth, when he was forced to
hand the ball to Reed.
Reed came in with a 4-2 lead,
but after a wild pitch, runners
stood at second and third. Reed
induced a ground ball to first
base, and senior catcher Zach
Jones received the throw and
smartly blocked the plate to pre
vent a run from scoring and get
the second out of the inning. Reed
induced a fly ball to end the
eighth, then a double play to end
the ninth. He picked up his eighth
save of the year and preserved
Pries' win.
Gaffney was 2-for-4 again on
Saturday, knocking in another

Third baseman Stephen Piscotty, left, finished a phenomenal junior season last weekend that earned him a
spot on the All-Pac-10 First Team. Sophomore shortstop Kenny Diekroeger, right, got an honorable mention.
