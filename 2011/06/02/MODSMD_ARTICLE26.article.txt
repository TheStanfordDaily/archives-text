# Posey's injury part of the game
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
I hate traditions. I hate "that's
how we always do it" as an an
swer. I hate that people still com
plain about instant replay and
interleague play as though they
are ruining baseball. I hate that tradi
tions have driven the practice of things
from politics to daily life to sports.
Heck, I even own a shirt saying it.
That being said, not all rules need to
be changed.
Case in point, Buster Posey. If you
aren't one of the many Giants fans that
just groaned at the mention of Buster
Posey, let me explain. Posey is the
young, up-and-coming catcher for the
world champs and a big reason why
the Giants became world champs in
the first place. He's the club's cleanup
hitter and the everyday rock behind
the plate, anchoring San Francisco's
deadly pitching staff.
Or I should say, he was. That all
came to an end last Wednesday in the
12th inning of a game against the Flori
da Marlins. Scott Cousins, a young out
fielder who went to college at the Uni
versity of San Francisco before joining
the Marlins, went barreling into Posey
during a play at the plate. Cousins
scored the go-ahead and eventual win
ning run on the play, but the play is re
membered more for Posey's body
going one way while his left leg did not.
Posey's ankle folded on itself and
he lay on the dirt near the plate in
agony until he could be attended to by
the training staff As expected, later
test results showed that the damage
would require season ending surgery.
Left without one of their brightest
stars, the Giants have been justifiably
angry. This anger has led to many peo
ple, including the team's general man
ager Brian Sabean, calling for a rule
change.
Currently, baseball allows players
to run into the catcher at home plate in
an effort to dislodge the ball. The in
jury to Posey is making many people
feel that a change needs to be made to
this rule. Looking at the video of the
play, it seems that Cousins probably
could have chosen to go around Posey
instead of through him.

But does this injury necessitate an
overhaul of the rule book? I say no.
The injury was definitely sad, but in
juries are part of the game. They are
part of all sports, in fact. Caring about
players' safety is very important and
should not be underestimated. But re
acting to every major injury by chang
ing the rules is just a naive waste of

time.
What rule could stop the injury
that just happened to Posey? Some
people, including Sabean, have said
that players should be required to
slide into home plate just like any
other base. But slides have their own
negative effects. In April, the Twins'
new acquisition, second baseman
Tsuyoshi Nishioka, broke his fibula
when Nick Swisher slid legally into his
planted leg. And that's just one exam
ple. Bringing in mandatory slides at
home could put the runner in more
danger going up against a well

padded catcher in an exposed posi
tion. Legal plays have their costs, and
there aren't enough rule changes to
get rid of these plays.
It's only natural to try to prevent
serious injuries from happening
again, but in some cases, that's all you
can do. My hometown Angels has lost
their best batter for over a season and
a halt, because he broke his leg cele
brating a walk-off grand slam. Pitch
ers break their hands punching water
coolers, and players strain their backs
playing with their children. Injuries
happen, and athletes are fragile.

Sometimes, there's nothing you can
do about it.
Learning from one mistake is
often the best way to stop bad things
from happening in the future, but too
often people overreact to an injury.
Concussions are a big problem in
football, but the current plan of fining
and penalizing more and more people
for every big hit is pointless. Yes, con
cussions should be minimized, but
taking a player's money for a legal hit
is silly. Instead of changing rules,
change how players are taught to tack
le. Educate players on what is safe and

what isn't.
You'll never take injuries out of
sports. Any athlete who has played any
level of organized sports or even a
pickup game of anything physical can
tell you that accidents happen. Instead
of trying to manipulate the rules to
solve every individual problem, attack
the bigger problems, and maybe you'll
find some results.
