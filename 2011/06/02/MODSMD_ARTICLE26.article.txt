# Posey's injury part of the game

I hate traditions. I hate "that's
how we always do it" as an an
swer. I hate that people still com
plain about instant replay and
interleague play as though they
are ruining baseball. I hate that tradi
tions have driven the practice of things
from politics to daily life to sports.
Heck, I even own a shirt saying it.
That being said, not all rules need to
be changed.
Case in point, Buster Posey. If you
aren't one of the many Giants fans that
just groaned at the mention of Buster
Posey, let me explain. Posey is the
young, up-and-coming catcher for the
world champs and a big reason why
the Giants became world champs in
the first place. He's the club's cleanup
hitter and the everyday rock behind
the plate, anchoring San Francisco's
deadly pitching staff.
Or I should say, he was. That all
came to an end last Wednesday in the
12th inning of a game against the Flori
da Marlins. Scott Cousins, a young out
fielder who went to college at the Uni
versity of San Francisco before joining
the Marlins, went barreling into Posey
during a play at the plate. Cousins
scored the go-ahead and eventual win
ning run on the play, but the play is re
membered more for Posey's body
going one way while his left leg did not.
Posey's ankle folded on itself and
he lay on the dirt near the plate in
agony until he could be attended to by
the training staff As expected, later
test results showed that the damage
would require season ending surgery.
Left without one of their brightest
stars, the Giants have been justifiably
angry. This anger has led to many peo
ple, including the team's general man
ager Brian Sabean, calling for a rule
change.
Currently, baseball allows players
to run into the catcher at home plate in
an effort to dislodge the ball. The in
jury to Posey is making many people
feel that a change needs to be made to
this rule. Looking at the video of the
play, it seems that Cousins probably
could have chosen to go around Posey
instead of through him.
