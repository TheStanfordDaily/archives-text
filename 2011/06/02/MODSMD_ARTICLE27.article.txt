# The 						upside of crowd segregation
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I'm all in favor of equal rights,
but I can't help feeling we need
more segregation in sports. Be
fore you mistakenly accuse me
of being Stanford's solitary Ku
Klux Klan representative, though, I
should probably clarify this state
ment. I'm not talking about race or
color sports are unquestionably
better because of the contributions
from all sectors of our species I'm
talking about fans and team colors.
Last Saturday I was lucky enough
to go to the Aviva Premiership Rugby
Final in London, the culmination of
the English rugby union season and
one of the highlights on a rugby fan's
calendar. It was an exciting game, but
something was lacking for such a big
event. To get the best understanding
of what is going on, it is always best to
watch sports on TV, but to feel the
roller coaster of emotions, you have to
be there in person. Barring the tense
final few minutes, though, this
matched seemed a bit light on the sort
of passion I'm used to.
Some of the critical differences be
tween being a rugby fan and a soccer
fan in the UK are the tougher regula
tions in the stands. For example, while
alcohol is sold at soccer stadiums, it's
illegal to take drinks to your seat. And
perhaps more famously, soccer fans
are strictly segregated. Wearing the
opposing team's shirt in the wrong
section is enough to get you ejected
from the stadium (with no chance of a
ticket refund), and the physical divi
sions between the fans are highlight
ed by fluorescently clothed mobs of
stewards and police.
Living in this soccer police state
might not seem an attractive proposi
tion, but it does have its silver lining.
Standing side-by-side with your fel
low fans while being confronted with
the uniform mass of the opposition
supporters across the stadium ampli
fies the emotions. Playing with human
feelings in this way can of course be
dangerous the dark days of foot
ball hooliganism in the UK are testa
ment to that but the risk is worth it.
Skirting along the safe side of that fine
line gives us sedate and domesticated
Westerners a glimpse of something
primal. Our adrenaline pumps, the
heart races and we get to feel the raw
power of the multitude for a few mo
ments before heading out of the stadi
um and back to our normal lives.
At this rugby final, though, there
was no separation. Fans of both teams
sat intermingled and there were even
many shirts from other clubs scat
tered amidst the crowd. It would have
been impossible to taunt the opposi
tion from the comfort of amorphous
anonymity since he/she was sitting
right next to you. The only real chant
ing from the crowd were coordinated
cries of "Tigers" (for Leicester Tigers)
and "Sarries" (for London Saracens);
shouts that, in the acoustics of a stadi
um, ended up sounding so similar it
was hard to tell who was supporting

who. It wasn't exactly a library, and
the on-field action was exciting, but
the comparative silence seemed a lit
tle eerie.
According to American friends,
the support from the student section
at Stanford Stadium is a little weak by
college standards. But even that
seemed more antagonistic than this,
and at the very least, the Red Zone
packs all the students together in one
place.
Turning back to my favorite sport
of soccer, I can't help but feel that
rugby misses the trick. My club does
n't have the most vocal fans, but how
ever badly we might be playing, I al
ways feel involved because the
soundtrack of the game carries me
along. Though there is often an edgy
feeling when fans taunt each other,
throngs of adults acting in choreo
graphed harmony is quite a silly
thought. There is also a comical na
ture to soccer chants; some of the
songs are pretty ridiculous and even
the most insulting ones, including
those that annoy TV censors as thou
sands of fans swear in audible unison,
are hard to take too seriously. You can
definitely get carried along with the
mob without resorting to the violence
that soccer unfortunately became in
famous for.
Combating that violence is exactly
why the law segregating fans at soccer
stadiums was introduced, but it may
be that it has had an unintended, and
positive, impact on the atmosphere of
these grounds. Keeping two sets of
supporters separate has brought the
fans in each closer together.

Tom also wants to know why you're
wearing that Red Sox jersey at a
Rockies-Giants game. Tell him why
