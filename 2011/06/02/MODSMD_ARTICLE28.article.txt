# Down, out, done in Alabama
## 
### WILL DOOLEY STAFF WRITER 
Just one day after Stanford
handed the No. 2 Alabama Softball
team its first home loss of the year,
the Crimson Tide returned the
favor by ending Stanford's season
in taking the final two games of the
best-of-three Super Regional series
last Friday.

No. 11 Stanford ended the sea
son with a 42-17 overall record, Ki
ll in conference play good
enough for fifth in the eight-team
Pac-10. Alabama improved to 51-9
overall and heads back to the
Women's College World Series in
Oklahoma starting June 2.
After sophomore pitcher Tea
gan Gerhart's dominant perform
ance in Thursday's 5-2 victory, the
Card needed to win just one of two
to advance. But Alabama adjusted
and the Crimson Tide bats were
rolling early Friday, mercy-ruling
Stanford 10-0 in the fifth inning.
Gerhart lasted just three innings,
allowing four runs on six hits and
two walks. Senior reliever Ashley
Chinn didn't fare any better, get
ting lit up in two innings of work as
she allowed six runs on eight hits.
Gerhart took the loss, her 12th of
the year.
In the circle for the Crimson
Tide was pitcher Kelsi Dunne, who
looked nearly unhittable as she
struck out four in five scoreless in
nings. Stanford's offense sputtered
and failed to start, and was unable
to score in both losses. Stanford's
dynamic junior duo of centerfield
er Sarah Hassman and shortstop
Ashley Hansen were the only Car
dinal batters to register hits in the
first game, each singling to lead off
the fourth, but were stranded as
the next three hitters recorded
outs. Dunne got the win, moving
her to 27-4 on the year.
Game three saw the Cardinal
bounce back nicely before eventu
ally losing in a well-contested 1-0
heartbreaker. Gerhart regained
her game-one form, and the Stan
ford offense threatened Dunne

several times but could never con
vert when it mattered.
Gerhart, who got the loss de
spite pitching well, struck out six in
six innings of work, allowing just
one run on four hits. She finishes
the year with a 26-13 record.
Stanford threatened first, miss
ing a golden opportunity as it
loaded the bases with one out in
the second. Senior first baseman
Melisa Koutz led off the inning
with a single. Koutz's two singles
would account for half of Stan
ford's hits in the game. Junior right
fielder Maya Burns reached on an
error, and junior third baseman
Jenna Becerra was hit by a pitch to
load the bases. But Dunne worked
her way out of the jam by striking
out Gerhart and getting Hassman
to ground out to third to end the in
ning.
The Cardinal threatened again
in the top of the fourth, once again
advancing Koutz to third after she
singled. After Burns singled to give
Stanford runners at first and sec
ond, Alabama responded by
pulling Dunne in favor of reliever
Jackie Traina, who was lights-out
for the Crimson Tide. Becerra
bunted the runners to second and
third, but Gerhart was unable to
pick them up, grounding out to
first. Traina, who got the win, mov
ing her to 18-5, allowed no runs,
walks or hits in 3.2 innings of work,
dominating Stanford hitters in
striking out five while retiring eight
in a row to end the game,
Stanford never again threat
ened, and the Tide managed to
solve Gerhart just enough to
squeeze out a run in sixth. With one
out, Traina singled to first. Gerhart
got the next batter to pop out to
third, but first baseman Cassie Reil
ly-Boccia tripled in the go-ahead
run to give the Tide the lead and the
game.
The Cardinal was retired in
order in the seventh to make it offi
cial. Hansen, one of three finalists
for National Player of the Year,
ended the year with the highest sin
gle-season batting average (.495) in
Stanford history. She also set a new
single-season record for hits in a
season with 95.

Junior shortstop Ashley Hansen, above, ended a stunning season on a disappointing note as Alabama stormed back
to take last weekend's Super Regional. She was named USA Softball's Collegiate Player of the Year on Tuesday.
