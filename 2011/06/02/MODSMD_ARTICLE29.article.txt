# BRINGING PERSPECTIVE TO 101 TITLES
## 
### THE DAILY SPORTS STAFF â€“ Wyndam Makowsky 
When the men's gymnastics
team beat Oklahoma and Illinois
for the NCAA title this April, it was
a moment with deeper repercus
sions than just an individual squad's
accomplishments with the victo
ry, Stanford secured its 100 th
NCAA team championship. In the
process, it became just the second
school (after UCLA) to achieve
that status. A women's water polo's
title in May was the cherry on top,
and with some teams still in season,
there's a chance for more before the
academic year ends.
But with The Daily taking a brief
hiatus until the summer volume be
gins, here is a small look back at how
we got to this point, from the first
championship 76 years ago to the
101 st title in the present day, with a
little assistance from The Daily's
archives.
No. 1: Men's Track and Field. June
14,1925
Although Stanford had partici
pated in intercollegiate athletics
since the inception of the Universi
ty, it took nearly 35 years for the
school to win its first national title. It
occurred in Chicago, when Stanford
beat Michigan by over six points.
World record-breaking perform
ances by the Wolverines' DeHart
Hubbard were countered by the
new collegiate records set by discus
thrower Biff Hoffman (who would
win the MVP of the Rose Bowl as a
member of the football team in
1928) and shot putter Glenn Har
tranft.
Since the championship was won
in mid-June of that year and
thus, after the printing of the last
issue of the spring volume there
does not exist a Daily article about
the accomplishment. This was the
first of four championships for the
men's track and field team, the most
recent one coming in 2000.
No. 7: Men's Basketball. March 20,
1942
March Madness of the 1940s was
a far cry from the 68-team field of
the modern day. With just eight
teams in contention, schools need
ed to only knock off three competi
tors to win the title. The Pacific

Coast Conference's Stanford Indi
ans, under head coach Everett
Dean, did just that, downing Rice,
Colorado and finally Dartmouth to
win the NCAA championship, 53-
38. Howie Dallmar, who would go
on to coach at Stanford for over two
decades, was named the tourna
ment MVP.
The Daily's Mar. 30 recap stated:
"Poor passing in the early stages
nearly cost the Farm skyscrapers
the ball game, but they put things to
gether in top shape in time to wind
up with a flurry of baskets to win
going away."
The men's basketball program
has not won a title since that year.

No. 18: Men's Tennis. May 22,1980
On a rainy day in Georgia, Stan
ford found itself in an early hole.
Facing Cal, its nemesis, for the
NCAA title, the Cardinal dropped
the first set in five of its first six sin
gles matches, but rallied across the
board to win the championship, 5-3.
It was the sixth collected by the pro
gram, which, along with men's golf,
has been Stanford's most successful
to date.
The score was tied 3-3 after the
completion of singles play. But a
win by Jim Gurfein in the final
match of that side had a tangible af
fect. Ivan Maisel now a senior
writer at ESPN wrote in his May

23 recap for The Daily: "The mo
mentum had switched, this time for
good. After a 30-minute breather,
the doubles play began. All three
Stanford teams won their first three
sets, and after that there were few
surprises."
Peter Rennert, who would go on
to win two professional doubles ti
tles with John McEnroe, won at No.
1 singles, and he and Lloyd Bourne
won at No. 1 doubles as well to
clinch the title.
No. 50: Women's Volleyball. De
cember 19,1992
One of the more stunning upsets
in Stanford sports history also
marked the halfway point in the
Cardinal's road to 100 champi
onships. Even though the 1992
women's volleyball team was ar
guably the program's best to date
which, considering its stagger
ingly successful run in the 1980s, was
saying something it was a consid
erable underdog in the NCAA
final. The opponent: UCLA, win
ners of the past two national titles
and in the midst of a perfect season.
The Daily's Jan. 4,1993 recap put
Stanford's opponents in perspec
tive: "They boasted the nation's
leading team offense in kills, kill av
erage, and hitting percentage, losing
few games along the way, let alone
matches. Many in the media were
calling the Bruins the greatest colle
giate women's volleyball team ever,
and even CBS's commentators
were calling UCLA 'invincible.'"
The Cardinal knew all about it:
Stanford had dropped only two
matches all year; both were to the
Bruins. But Stanford was dominant

in the championship match, losing
only one set to win its first national
title.
No. 82: Women's Water Polo. May
12,2002
The Cardinal's first title in
women's water polo was a story of
revenge. In 2001, the first year of the
NCAA Championship, Stanford
entered the final game undefeated
but was defeated by UCLA. The
Bruins continued their success
against the Cardinal into the 2002
season, as UCLA downed Stanford
to win the MPSF Championship in
early May. But in the rematch (of a
rematch), the Cardinal jumped out
to an early lead and didn't look
back, leading 3-1 after the first quar
ter and going on to win 8-4. Goalie
Jackie Frank made 12 saves and was
named tournament MVP.
The Daily's recap illustrated the
keys to victory: "Stanford's depth
propelled it to victory. Six different
players scored in the match . ..
With the Bruins only down by two
[in the third quarter], after a UCLA
shot hit the crossbar, freshman
Kelty Luber scored to increase the
Stanford lead to three."
Stanford would wait nearly a
decade for its next women's water
polo championship, won just a few
weeks ago, the latest tally for Cardi
nal athletics.

Stanford has made a habit of winning NCAA titles in the last few decades, with the most recent championship coming from the women's water polo squad.
The team, pictured above with its championship trophy, lost just one game this year and beat out No. 2 Cal 9-5 to take the title match in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
last month. After losing in the final a year eariler, head coach John Tanner summed it up succintly: "It was a wonderful day," he said after the match.

would also be won in the Midwest.
This time it was in Columbus, Ohio,
where the men's gymnastics team
overcame a slow start on the parallel
bars to launch past Oklahoma and
Illinois for the NCAA champi
onship. Anchored by its perform
ances on the horizontal bars and in

the floor exercises, the Cardinal was
able to win a title for the second time
in three years, its sixth overall.
In the Daily's April 18 recap,
head coach Thom Glielmi said just
about all that needed to be said: "I
am ecstatic that men's gymnastics
was the team to reach the 100 th
title for Stanford... It is an in
credible achievement for Stan
ford, and the fact that it was men's
gymnastics that won it is just icing
on the cake."

about all that needed to be said: "I

When the men's gymnastics
team beat Oklahoma and Illinois
for the NCAA title this April, it was
a moment with deeper repercus
sions than just an individual squad's
accomplishments with the victo

NCAA team championship. In the
process, it became just the second
school (after UCLA) to achieve
that status. A women's water polo's
title in May was the cherry on top,
and with some teams still in season,
there's a chance for more before the
academic year ends.
But with The Daily taking a brief
hiatus until the summer volume be
gins, here is a small look back at how
we got to this point, from the first
championship 76 years ago to the
101 st title in the present day, with a
little assistance from The Daily's
archives.
No. 1: Men's Track and Field. June
14,1925
Although Stanford had partici
pated in intercollegiate athletics
since the inception of the Universi
ty, it took nearly 35 years for the
school to win its first national title. It
occurred in Chicago, when Stanford
beat Michigan by over six points.
World record-breaking perform
ances by the Wolverines' DeHart
Hubbard were countered by the
new collegiate records set by discus
thrower Biff Hoffman (who would
win the MVP of the Rose Bowl as a
member of the football team in
1928) and shot putter Glenn Har
tranft.
Since the championship was won
in mid-June of that year and
thus, after the printing of the last
issue of the spring volume there
does not exist a Daily article about
the accomplishment. This was the
first of four championships for the
men's track and field team, the most
recent one coming in 2000.
No. 7: Men's Basketball. March 20,
1942
March Madness of the 1940s was
a far cry from the 68-team field of
the modern day. With just eight
teams in contention, schools need
ed to only knock off three competi
tors to win the title. The Pacific

Coast Conference's Stanford Indi
ans, under head coach Everett
Dean, did just that, downing Rice,
Colorado and finally Dartmouth to
win the NCAA championship, 53-
38. Howie Dallmar, who would go
on to coach at Stanford for over two
decades, was named the tourna
ment MVP.
The Daily's Mar. 30 recap stated:
"Poor passing in the early stages
nearly cost the Farm skyscrapers
the ball game, but they put things to
gether in top shape in time to wind
up with a flurry of baskets to win
going away."
The men's basketball program
has not won a title since that year.

No. 18: Men's Tennis. May 22,1980
On a rainy day in Georgia, Stan
ford found itself in an early hole.
Facing Cal, its nemesis, for the
NCAA title, the Cardinal dropped
the first set in five of its first six sin
gles matches, but rallied across the
board to win the championship, 5-3.
It was the sixth collected by the pro
gram, which, along with men's golf,
has been Stanford's most successful
to date.
The score was tied 3-3 after the
completion of singles play. But a
win by Jim Gurfein in the final
match of that side had a tangible af
fect. Ivan Maisel now a senior
writer at ESPN wrote in his May

23 recap for The Daily: "The mo
mentum had switched, this time for
good. After a 30-minute breather,
the doubles play began. All three
Stanford teams won their first three
sets, and after that there were few
surprises."
Peter Rennert, who would go on
to win two professional doubles ti
tles with John McEnroe, won at No.
1 singles, and he and Lloyd Bourne
won at No. 1 doubles as well to
clinch the title.
No. 50: Women's Volleyball. De
cember 19,1992
One of the more stunning upsets
in Stanford sports history also
marked the halfway point in the
Cardinal's road to 100 champi
onships. Even though the 1992
women's volleyball team was ar
guably the program's best to date
which, considering its stagger
ingly successful run in the 1980s, was
saying something it was a consid
erable underdog in the NCAA
final. The opponent: UCLA, win
ners of the past two national titles
and in the midst of a perfect season.
The Daily's Jan. 4,1993 recap put
Stanford's opponents in perspec
tive: "They boasted the nation's
leading team offense in kills, kill av
erage, and hitting percentage, losing
few games along the way, let alone
matches. Many in the media were
calling the Bruins the greatest colle
giate women's volleyball team ever,
and even CBS's commentators
were calling UCLA 'invincible.'"
The Cardinal knew all about it:
Stanford had dropped only two
matches all year; both were to the
Bruins. But Stanford was dominant

in the championship match, losing
only one set to win its first national
title.
No. 82: Women's Water Polo. May
12,2002
The Cardinal's first title in
women's water polo was a story of
revenge. In 2001, the first year of the
NCAA Championship, Stanford
entered the final game undefeated
but was defeated by UCLA. The
Bruins continued their success
against the Cardinal into the 2002
season, as UCLA downed Stanford
to win the MPSF Championship in
early May. But in the rematch (of a
rematch), the Cardinal jumped out
to an early lead and didn't look
back, leading 3-1 after the first quar
ter and going on to win 8-4. Goalie
Jackie Frank made 12 saves and was
named tournament MVP.
The Daily's recap illustrated the
keys to victory: "Stanford's depth
propelled it to victory. Six different
players scored in the match . ..
With the Bruins only down by two
[in the third quarter], after a UCLA
shot hit the crossbar, freshman
Kelty Luber scored to increase the
Stanford lead to three."
Stanford would wait nearly a
decade for its next women's water
polo championship, won just a few
weeks ago, the latest tally for Cardi
nal athletics.
No. 100: Men's Gymnastics. April

championship was claimed in Chica

Stanford has made a habit of winning NCAA titles in the last few decades, with the most recent championship coming from the women's water polo squad.
The team, pictured above with its championship trophy, lost just one game this year and beat out No. 2 Cal 9-5 to take the title match in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
last month. After losing in the final a year eariler, head coach John Tanner summed it up succintly: "It was a wonderful day," he said after the match.
