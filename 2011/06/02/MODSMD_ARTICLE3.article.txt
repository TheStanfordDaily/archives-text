# QUEENS OF THEIR COURT
## BARTE, BURDETTE TAKE NCAA DOUBLES TITLE 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team
had representatives in every round of the
NCAA Tournament this year, and
thanks to some clutch play in a tiebreak
er, the pairing of senior Hilary Barte and
sophomore Mallory Burdette put the
heartbreaking loss in the team competi
tion in the past them and won the dou
bles championship on their home court.
Sophomore Stacey Tan almost shocked
the field by taking the singles crown, but
lost in the final just before Barte and
Burdette began their match.
As the 3rd seed in the tournament,
Barte and Burdette knocked off Clem
son's Josipa Bek and Keri Wong 7-6 (6),
6-0 in what was Barte's second run to a
doubles championship. In the first-set
tiebreaker, Stanford saved five set points
and overcame a 1-6 hole to win. That

comeback, along with Barte's brilliant
net play, allowed them to cruise to the 6-
0 second set and secure the champi
onship.
"Defending a title is always really
hard, as proven in the team event," Barte
said. "I'm proud of the way Mallory and
1 went about our business and you know,
battled through the tournament. It's
been a long two weeks."
During the tournament, the pair
recorded victories over two top-10 oppo
nents. In their semifinal matchup, they
upset the tournament's top doubles pair
of Jana Juricova and Mari Andersson of
California in a dominating 6-1, 6-4 per
formance.
"Especially these last two matches,
Hilary and I returned really, really well,"
