# QUEENS OF THEIR COURT
## BARTE, BURDETTE TAKE NCAA DOUBLES TITLE 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team
had representatives in every round of the
NCAA Tournament this year, and
thanks to some clutch play in a tiebreak
er, the pairing of senior Hilary Barte and
sophomore Mallory Burdette put the
heartbreaking loss in the team competi
tion in the past them and won the dou
bles championship on their home court.
Sophomore Stacey Tan almost shocked
the field by taking the singles crown, but
lost in the final just before Barte and
Burdette began their match.
As the 3rd seed in the tournament,
Barte and Burdette knocked off Clem
son's Josipa Bek and Keri Wong 7-6 (6),
6-0 in what was Barte's second run to a
doubles championship. In the first-set
tiebreaker, Stanford saved five set points
and overcame a 1-6 hole to win. That

comeback, along with Barte's brilliant
net play, allowed them to cruise to the 6-
0 second set and secure the champi
onship.
"Defending a title is always really
hard, as proven in the team event," Barte
said. "I'm proud of the way Mallory and
1 went about our business and you know,
battled through the tournament. It's
been a long two weeks."
During the tournament, the pair
recorded victories over two top-10 oppo
nents. In their semifinal matchup, they
upset the tournament's top doubles pair
of Jana Juricova and Mari Andersson of
California in a dominating 6-1, 6-4 per
formance.
"Especially these last two matches,
Hilary and I returned really, really well,"

After a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to Florida in the team final, sophomore Mallory Burdette,
left, and senior Hilary Barte, right, teamed up to take the doubles title on Monday.

Burdette said. "That's something
that definitely left us at times dur
ing the season. Going forward,
being even more solid on our re
turns is important. Also, continuing
to be aggressive and moving a lot to
the net. I think that only experi
ence can get you comfortable with
being aggressive at the net."
With the doubles title, Barte will
graduate as a four-time All-Ameri
can in both singles and doubles.
She has won the doubles champi
onship twice in a row this year
with Mallory Burdette and last
year with Burdette's older sister,
Lindsay.
"There aren't words to capture
what it can feel like," Barte said. "I
really don't think you can write a
better story than being able to go
out my senior year, last match of
the day, crowd's there, great weath
er, and go out on top."
"I don't want to say it's sad [see
ing Barte graduate] because it's the
way things go," Mallory Burdette
said. "She had a great four years
here and I'm happy I was able to
contribute to her getting another
doubles title. Part of it is sad but it
was a great ending. Hopefully we'll
get the wildcard and we'll get to
play together again in August at the
U.S. Open."
While Barte and Burdette were
no newcomers to the spotlight, the
singles championship featured Tan,
a Cardinal upstart. With a bit of
luck and a lot of determination, Tan
made it to the finals for the first
time in her two years at Stanford
last season, she failed to qualify
for the NCAA Tournament.
"I was really happy about how
well I did this year," Tan said. "I
didn't predict I would get this far. I
was just happy to have the oppor
tunity to play in the tournament
and compete against the top col
lege players in the nation."
Two opponents retired against
Tan No. 11 Josipa Bek of Clem
son retired in the first round, down
2-0 in the first set. No. 17 Lauren
Embree, the Gator that clinched
the NCAA title for Florida, retired
after losing the second set of their
semifinal matchup.
In the two matches Tan played
start-to-finish; she lost the first set
and stormed back to win the next
two sets both times. In the second
round, she defeated No. 28 Sanaa
Bhambri of NC State 5-7, 6-3, 6-1.
In the quarterfinals, Tan defeated
No. 49 Nina Secerbegovic of Bay
lor 5-7,6-1,6-4. In the round of 16,
Tan beat No. 21 Aeriel Ellis of
Texas 6-4,7-6 (6).
Unfortunately, Tan's luck ran
out in the title game. No. 1 Juricova
started off hot, winning the first set
in a dominating 6-0 performance,
"The first set, I was nervous a
lot,"Tan said. "I felt so nervous and

tight and couldn't hit out on my
shots and wasn't playing my game.
I feel like it was a bit of the champi
onship vibe and playing the No. 1
girl in the nation and wanting to
put up a tough match, but then get
ting nervous when it started going
by really fast."
The second set was an entirely
different story for Tan, however, as
she showed some real signs of life.
For the third time this tournament,
she had to come back from a first
set loss.
After being broken at 2-3, Tan
played brilliantly to break Juricova
back and tie the second set at 3-3.
The game progressed into a
tiebreaker the seventh
tiebreaker of the singles tourna
ment for Stanford players.
"The second [set] I was happier
about the way I played and I was
relaxed," Tan continued. "After the
first set, I told myself that I might as
well do my best to relax and just hit
out on my shots. If she still hits
amazing shots, then it's ok because
I gave it 100 percent of what I had
that day."
Stanford was 3-4 in those seven
tiebreakers, including Tan's loss in
the singles championship. Tan's
backhand had been great all day,
but late in the match it uncharac
teristically failed her and four con
secutive backhand errors put her
down 0-5 a backhand error
sealed the victory for Juricova.
"I feel like on the very close
points, she was able to get some
shots back that landed on the line
several times and helped her get
ahead in the tiebreaker," Tan said.
"She did serve very well, too, which
helped a lot."
There were several other im
pressive Cardinal performances
over the weekend. In an all-Stan
ford quarterfinal matchup of two
of the team's most dominant sin
gles players, freshman Nicole
Gibbs, the girl with the best record
of the year at 46-6, powered past
Barte, The rookie, after playing
with a dominating passing game
that continually forced volley er
rors out of Barte, upset the senior
in her last singles match in convinc
ing fashion, 6-4,6-1.
But in the semis, Gibbs suc
cumbed to the top-seeded Juricova
in a long, tight match. Juricova
struggled to get much past Gibbs
and was forced into two tiebreak
ers. Gibbs narrowly earned the first
set and took the lead, but dropped
the next two to be eliminated. The
final score was a wild one 7-6
(5), 5-7,6-7 (2).
While the team competition
provided some high drama, it
ended up being the individual and
doubles draws that were most fruit
ful for the Cardinal, which will have
to replace the talents of seniors
Barte, Jennifer Yen and Carolyn
McVeigh, but returns eight players
to the court next year.

The Stanford women's tennis team
had representatives in every round of the
NCAA Tournament this year, and
thanks to some clutch play in a tiebreak
er, the pairing of senior Hilary Barte and
sophomore Mallory Burdette put the
heartbreaking loss in the team competi
tion in the past them and won the dou
bles championship on their home court.
Sophomore Stacey Tan almost shocked
the field by taking the singles crown, but
lost in the final just before Barte and
Burdette began their match.
As the 3rd seed in the tournament,
Barte and Burdette knocked off Clem
son's Josipa Bek and Keri Wong 7-6 (6),
6-0 in what was Barte's second run to a
doubles championship. In the first-set
tiebreaker, Stanford saved five set points
and overcame a 1-6 hole to win. That

comeback, along with Barte's brilliant
net play, allowed them to cruise to the 6-
0 second set and secure the champi
onship.
"Defending a title is always really
hard, as proven in the team event," Barte
said. "I'm proud of the way Mallory and
1 went about our business and you know,
battled through the tournament. It's
been a long two weeks."
During the tournament, the pair
recorded victories over two top-10 oppo
nents. In their semifinal matchup, they
upset the tournament's top doubles pair
of Jana Juricova and Mari Andersson of
California in a dominating 6-1, 6-4 per
formance.
"Especially these last two matches,
Hilary and I returned really, really well,"

After a heartbreaking 4-3 loss to Florida in the team final, sophomore Mallory Burdette,
left, and senior Hilary Barte, right, teamed up to take the doubles title on Monday.

Burdette said. "That's something
that definitely left us at times dur
ing the season. Going forward,
being even more solid on our re
turns is important. Also, continuing
to be aggressive and moving a lot to
the net. I think that only experi
ence can get you comfortable with
being aggressive at the net."
With the doubles title, Barte will
graduate as a four-time All-Ameri
can in both singles and doubles.
She has won the doubles champi
onship twice in a row this year
with Mallory Burdette and last
year with Burdette's older sister,
Lindsay.
"There aren't words to capture
what it can feel like," Barte said. "I
really don't think you can write a
better story than being able to go
out my senior year, last match of
the day, crowd's there, great weath
er, and go out on top."
"I don't want to say it's sad [see
ing Barte graduate] because it's the
way things go," Mallory Burdette
said. "She had a great four years
here and I'm happy I was able to
contribute to her getting another
doubles title. Part of it is sad but it
was a great ending. Hopefully we'll
get the wildcard and we'll get to
play together again in August at the
U.S. Open."
While Barte and Burdette were
no newcomers to the spotlight, the
singles championship featured Tan,
a Cardinal upstart. With a bit of
luck and a lot of determination, Tan
made it to the finals for the first
time in her two years at Stanford
last season, she failed to qualify
for the NCAA Tournament.
"I was really happy about how
well I did this year," Tan said. "I
didn't predict I would get this far. I
was just happy to have the oppor
tunity to play in the tournament
and compete against the top col
lege players in the nation."
Two opponents retired against
Tan No. 11 Josipa Bek of Clem
son retired in the first round, down
2-0 in the first set. No. 17 Lauren
Embree, the Gator that clinched
the NCAA title for Florida, retired
after losing the second set of their
semifinal matchup.
In the two matches Tan played
start-to-finish; she lost the first set
and stormed back to win the next
two sets both times. In the second
round, she defeated No. 28 Sanaa
Bhambri of NC State 5-7, 6-3, 6-1.
In the quarterfinals, Tan defeated
No. 49 Nina Secerbegovic of Bay
lor 5-7,6-1,6-4. In the round of 16,
Tan beat No. 21 Aeriel Ellis of
Texas 6-4,7-6 (6).
Unfortunately, Tan's luck ran
out in the title game. No. 1 Juricova
started off hot, winning the first set
in a dominating 6-0 performance,
"The first set, I was nervous a
lot,"Tan said. "I felt so nervous and

tight and couldn't hit out on my
shots and wasn't playing my game.
I feel like it was a bit of the champi
onship vibe and playing the No. 1
girl in the nation and wanting to
put up a tough match, but then get
ting nervous when it started going
by really fast."
The second set was an entirely
different story for Tan, however, as
she showed some real signs of life.
For the third time this tournament,
she had to come back from a first
set loss.
After being broken at 2-3, Tan
played brilliantly to break Juricova
back and tie the second set at 3-3.
The game progressed into a
tiebreaker the seventh
tiebreaker of the singles tourna
ment for Stanford players.
"The second [set] I was happier
about the way I played and I was
relaxed," Tan continued. "After the
first set, I told myself that I might as
well do my best to relax and just hit
out on my shots. If she still hits
amazing shots, then it's ok because
I gave it 100 percent of what I had
that day."
Stanford was 3-4 in those seven
tiebreakers, including Tan's loss in
the singles championship. Tan's
backhand had been great all day,
but late in the match it uncharac
teristically failed her and four con
secutive backhand errors put her
down 0-5 a backhand error
sealed the victory for Juricova.
"I feel like on the very close
points, she was able to get some
shots back that landed on the line
several times and helped her get
ahead in the tiebreaker," Tan said.
"She did serve very well, too, which
helped a lot."
There were several other im
pressive Cardinal performances
over the weekend. In an all-Stan
ford quarterfinal matchup of two
of the team's most dominant sin
gles players, freshman Nicole
Gibbs, the girl with the best record
of the year at 46-6, powered past
Barte, The rookie, after playing
with a dominating passing game
that continually forced volley er
rors out of Barte, upset the senior
in her last singles match in convinc
ing fashion, 6-4,6-1.
But in the semis, Gibbs suc
cumbed to the top-seeded Juricova
in a long, tight match. Juricova
struggled to get much past Gibbs
and was forced into two tiebreak
ers. Gibbs narrowly earned the first
set and took the lead, but dropped
the next two to be eliminated. The
final score was a wild one 7-6
(5), 5-7,6-7 (2).
While the team competition
provided some high drama, it
ended up being the individual and
doubles draws that were most fruit
ful for the Cardinal, which will have
to replace the talents of seniors
Barte, Jennifer Yen and Carolyn
McVeigh, but returns eight players
to the court next year.
