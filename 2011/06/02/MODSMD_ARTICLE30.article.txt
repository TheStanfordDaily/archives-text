## Hansen named USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year 
### â€” Miles Bennett-Smith 
After a heartbreaking 1-0 loss at
Alabama left the No. 12 Stanford soft
ball team one game short of the
Women's College World Series, junior
shortstop Ashley Hansen found a rea
son to celebrate when she was just the
second position player ever to be
named USA Softball's Collegiate
Player of the Year on Tuesday.
Hansen is the first Stanford player
to win the award, which is given out by
the Amateur Softball Association of
America (ASA).The Chandler, Ariz.,
native certainly was deserving after
putting up some impressive statistics
in addition to leading the Pac-10 in
on-base percentage, hits and doubles,
she was third in the country in batting
average, posting an other-worldly .495
mark that is a new Stanford single
season record.
"My team has been there for me
through thick and thin this year, really
the past three years," the three-time
All-Pac-10 First-Team honoree said.

"I have eight other girls in the lineup
who are capable of getting the job
done, and that takes a lot of pressure
off of me."
With another year left on the
Farm, Hansen has a very good shot at
shattering some Stanford career
marks she is eighth in career hits
and RBI, seventh in runs scored, third
in doubles and tied for second in
triples.
"From the first day that she set foot
on campus, we knew she was not only
a special player, but a special person,"
said head coach John Rittman.' 'This is
huge for Stanford and our program to
have someone recognized as National
Player of the Year. I am so proud of
Ashley and all her accomplishments."
Hansen, who was already named
the Pac-10 Player of the Year, beat out
Big-12 Pitcher of the Year Chelsea
Thomas of Missouri and Arizona out
fielder Katelyn Boyd for the award,
which was announced at a banquet to
kick off the WCWS that gets under
way this week.
