## CAPITAL ONE CUP MISSES THE MARK 
### ALEX ROMANCZUK '11 
In his scholarship letters to
new recruits, Jim Harbaugh
was always fond of writing,
"As both the top academic
institution in the world and the
home of the top collegiate athlet
ic program in the world, Stanford
represents the greatest combina
tion of academic and athletic ex
cellence in existence."

While it's easy to dismiss any
thing Harbaugh says as motiva
tional hyperbole, a number of
people around this university are
of the same opinion. The first part
of the claim that Stanford is
the world's top academic institu
tion may be bold, arrogant,
pointless and non-confirmable,
but you can at least make a rea
sonable case that it's true. And the
second part of the claim that
Stanford boasts the top collegiate
athletic program is, of course,
indisputable.
Or is it? Since 1990, Stanford
has won 59 NCAA team titles
(easily more than any other
school). More notably, perhaps,
the Cardinal has taken home six
teen consecutive NACDA Direc
tors' Cups, the award given annu
ally to the collegiate athletics pro
gram with the most overall success
in the assorted NCAA champi
onships (and in football, which de
termines its champion outside the
purview of the NCAA). The Di
rectors' Cup used to be sponsored
by Sears, but people eventually
lost interest due to the predictable
nature of the competition, and
Sears dropped its sponsorship.
Minor changes to the formula
have failed to have any effect on
Stanford's remarkable streak.
Earlier this year, the folks at
ESPN got the brilliant idea to
hand out another award to the na

tion's most successful athletic
program. But being ESPN, they
want people to follow the results
of their Capital One Cup, so they
had to figure out away to make
Stanford's victory seem not so in
evitable. To do so, they made
three major changes to the basic
formula used by the Directors'
Cup.

First, the competition has been
divided into a men's division and
a women's division. This makes
sense in an individual sport,
where physical differences be
tween men and women might
make it impossible for women to
participate, but when it comes to
dividing the activities of an entire
athletics department, this distinc
tion is absolutely mystifying. No
college has separate departments
for managing their men's and
women's programs. By segregat
ing Stanford's dominant women's
teams into their own category
(which they currently lead, even
with the other modifications in
tended to weaken Stanford), the
Capital One Cup is simply shining
even more of a spotlight on the
high-revenue men's sports that al
ready receive the most media at
tention. If you add together the
point totals for the men's and
women's divisions, Stanford easi
ly sits at No. 1, with 165 points to
Cal's 140.
The second change with the
Capital One Cup is breaking the
sports into three tiers. The top
tier sports (football, basketball
and baseball on the men's side)
are worth three times as many
points as the bottom-tier sports
(such as cross-country, golf, and
tennis). Stanford has traditionally
dominated those lesser-known
sports (which don't receive as

much consistent attention from
athletics departments as, say, bas
ketball does), so this move makes
sense from that perspective. But
Auburn, which currently leads the
men's standings with 70 points,
collected 60 of those points from
its football championship over
Oregon in the fall. The smaller
programs have become nothing
but a tiebreaker to sort out the
most successful programs from
the three big championships.
The final change is that the
Capital One Cup ignores certain
sports entirely. Instead of allow
ing a school's best handful of pro
grams to count toward the formu
la (which still gave an advantage
to schools like Stanford, with
more programs), the new compe
tition simply fails to acknowledge
sports like men's gymnastics. I'm
sure the Stanford men, fresh off
their second championship in
three years, are happy to know all
of their hours of work and prac
tice are considered worthless.

So how do things look? The
Cardinal currently leads the
women's standings and sits in
fourth in the men's at 15 points
back. At first, I was mildly in
censed that ESPN would dare to
designate someone other than
Stanford as the most successful
collegiate athletics program. But I
understand their need for excite
ment, and I've now come to ap
preciate the opportunity they've
given us to win at something else.
So in these coming weeks and
months, let us (or more precisely,
our athletes) do just that: women,
keep doing what you're doing.
Men's baseball, football and
track? Go all the way. Maybe next
year they'll just give up and start
giving a prize for second place.

of their Capital One Cup, so they
had to figure out away to make
Stanford's victory seem not so in
evitable. To do so, they made
three major changes to the basic
formula used by the Directors'
Cup.

First, the competition has been
divided into a men's division and
a women's division. This makes
sense in an individual sport,
where physical differences be
tween men and women might
make it impossible for women to
participate, but when it comes to
dividing the activities of an entire
athletics department, this distinc
tion is absolutely mystifying. No
college has separate departments
for managing their men's and
women's programs. By segregat
ing Stanford's dominant women's
teams into their own category
(which they currently lead, even
with the other modifications in
tended to weaken Stanford), the
Capital One Cup is simply shining
even more of a spotlight on the
high-revenue men's sports that al
ready receive the most media at
tention. If you add together the
point totals for the men's and
women's divisions, Stanford easi
ly sits at No. 1, with 165 points to
Cal's 140.
The second change with the
Capital One Cup is breaking the
sports into three tiers. The top
tier sports (football, basketball
and baseball on the men's side)
are worth three times as many
points as the bottom-tier sports
(such as cross-country, golf, and
tennis). Stanford has traditionally
dominated those lesser-known
sports (which don't receive as

much consistent attention from
athletics departments as, say, bas
ketball does), so this move makes
sense from that perspective. But
Auburn, which currently leads the
men's standings with 70 points,
collected 60 of those points from
its football championship over
Oregon in the fall. The smaller
programs have become nothing
but a tiebreaker to sort out the
most successful programs from
the three big championships.
The final change is that the
Capital One Cup ignores certain
sports entirely. Instead of allow
ing a school's best handful of pro
grams to count toward the formu
la (which still gave an advantage
to schools like Stanford, with
more programs), the new compe
tition simply fails to acknowledge
sports like men's gymnastics. I'm
sure the Stanford men, fresh off
their second championship in
three years, are happy to know all
of their hours of work and prac
tice are considered worthless.

So how do things look? The
Cardinal currently leads the
women's standings and sits in
fourth in the men's at 15 points
back. At first, I was mildly in
censed that ESPN would dare to
designate someone other than
Stanford as the most successful
collegiate athletics program. But I
understand their need for excite
ment, and I've now come to ap
preciate the opportunity they've
given us to win at something else.
So in these coming weeks and
months, let us (or more precisely,
our athletes) do just that: women,
keep doing what you're doing.
Men's baseball, football and
track? Go all the way. Maybe next
year they'll just give up and start
giving a prize for second place.
