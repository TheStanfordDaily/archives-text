## SIGNS YOU MIGHT BE WANTED BY STANFORD POLICE 
### 
If youre like Intermission, you've probably learned a lot
from the Stanford Police this year, specifically what a hot
prowl is or how easy it is to get away as long as you "dis
appear into the groves." Similarly, you're probably frustrat
ed with their infuriatingly cryptic texts and how we never
ever really find out what happened. In any case,
Intermission's done its best to piece together five signs
that you might be wanted by the Stanford Police.

1 you drive a badass, souped-up car.
May 14: "Witnesses describe the second vehicle as an older,
2-door vehicle, possibly a Lexus or Buick, which is burnt
orange, brown or gold in color. This vehicle has distinct, large
rims (possibly 24 inches in diameter) and scissor-doors (doors
that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door,
rather than outwardly as with a conventional door)."

2You have dreadlocks.
May 14: "... a slender build and long dreadlocks, possibly
armed with a silver hand gun." Apr. 24: "... some of whom
may have had dreadlocks."
Yclu're a short man.
Apr. 24: "He stood about 5'2" to 5'4" and had a chubby
build." Apr. 9: "He stands 5'6" in height and has a chubby
build."
You're a little on the heavy side.
See the preceding point. Nothing will get you on Weight
Watchers faster than a campus-wide blast critiquing your
weight.
