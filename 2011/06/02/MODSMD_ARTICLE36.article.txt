## THIRD EYE BLIND ROCKS MEMAUD LIKE IT'S 1997 
### â€” jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
Last Thursday, the Verizon Wireless Coffee Shop
Series brought Stephan Jenkins and his band
home to perform at Memorial Auditorium.
Third Eye Blind, the beloved '9os alt-rock group,
delivered a killer show that transformed the palatial
auditorium into a house of rock.
Jenkins worked through his signature concert
moves, climbing on the amps, beating tambourines
against his chest and toying with a tall fedora
throughout the night, and his proud, high-energy
performance style captivated the traditionally stiff
Stanford crowd, bringing the whole house to its
feet. Up front, students swarmed around the foot of
the stage.

"Ah, springtime at Stanford University!" Jenkins
called out at the end of the first song, before standing
with his arms crossed, observing the audience coyly. "I
am thoroughly, completely enjoying this right now. I
grew up at Stanford University."
"This is my home and, uh, when I was like 8
years old, we used to ride our bicycles over here, and I
climbed to the top of that catwalk and peed off it,"
Jenkins said with a smile. "So this place is literally a
landmark for me."
Connecting with the audience from Jenkins'
opening words, Third Eye Blind moved into a more

solemn song, "Wounded," before setting aside
their electric guitars and clearing the stage for
Jenkins and his acoustic guitar.
Introducing the next song, "1 in 10," with
a dash of humor, Jenkins began, "I fell deeply
in love with this very dedicated lesbian." The
crowd laughed appreciatively. "And I got
absolutely nowhere, and I wrote her this song."
As the last acoustic chord of "1 in 10" died
out, loud calls from the audience demanded
the Third Eye Blind hit "Slow Motion." Jenkins
lowered his voice into the mic, "That was a
really good-hearted song. This is a really bad
hearted song," and began the dark ballad.
Jenkins noted an enthusiastic member of

the crowd in the balcony who was wearing a
Beat Cal shirt. "Well, my friends, I went to Cal,"
Jenkins said, "yet I love you. Do you love me?
'Cause I love you, there you go!" The crowd,
hesitant at first, cheered as Jenkins grinned.
"Let's get away from red and blue."
Jenkins then introduced guitarist Kryz
Reid, who worked an impressive guitar solo as
Jenkins ran off to grab two fistfuls of glow
sticks. The lights shut off and Jenkins held the
glowsticks over his head, cracking them slowly
as their colored light burst in an arch. The
band moved into "Monotov's Private Opera,"
and Jenkins threw the glowsticks out into the
crowd one by one as he worked through the
upbeat song, finally throwing the last bunch
in one triumphant swoop.
Abruptly, the band left the stage, but the
crowd remained, cheering, well aware that
Third Eye Blind couldn't leave without
indulging their fans in their most famous hit.

Jenkins and the band re-emerged on the
stage and kicked off their encore with "Water
Landing." The bassist Abe Millet, donning a

scruffy beard and sneakers, rocked the penul
timate song while drummer Brad Hargreaves
continued to anchor the band from the back
with his powerful, loud percussion.
Next came the first chord of "Never Let
You Go," begun as the entire auditorium
cheered and sang along, smiling the whole
way through.
The band closed their set with the power
ful "God of Wine," and Jenkins said that right
after their performance, the band would be
heading back to their studio in San Francisco
to record their next album.
"When we finish that album, if you'll have
us, we'll come back and play again," Jenkins
said. Here's to hearing Third Eye Blind rock the
house again soon.
