While the verdict's still out as to
whether Lady Gaga's "Born This
Way" lives up to the "greatest
album of the decade" hype, it's clear Gaga
won't be suffering from any sophomore
slump. Boosted by Amazon's decision to sell
the album for 99 cents, it exceeded industry
expecations, selling a stellar 1.11 million
units its first week, a figure that's definitely
pleasing Stanford's Mixed Company. The a
capella group is looking to capitalize on
Gaga's success with the first official a capella
cover of Gaga's latest single, "The Edge of
Glory," on iTunes now, and a little taste of
their next album, slated for a fall release.
Things were put in motion a couple
months back by Mixed Co. alum, Sidney Li,
who approached the group about recording a
cover of Britney Spears' "Hold It Against Me"
through A Capella Records (ACR), an inde
pendent label that has sent four of its artists to
"The Sing-Off," NBC's a capella reality show
competition. However, ACR President Chris
Crawford quickly presented the group with a
different option.
"He told us 'The Edge of Glory' just got
released as an additional single; it's number
two on Billboard, and we want to make that a
single from ACR, and Mixed Company is our
first choice. Are you willing to do this?"' said
Alex Cope 'l3, musical director. "And we said,
'Of course.'"
"We wanted one song on the album to be
pretty relevant to what's currently on the
charts," said Nick Chen 'l3, album manager.
"The problem was that 'Hold It Against Me'
came out in January... I think in retrospect,
people bought the song because it was
Britney's comeback, you know? It had no last

ing impact the way that I think 'The Edge of
Glory' will."
The third single was inspired by the
death of Gaga's grandfather last September.
"The song is about your last moment on
earth, the moment of truth, the moment
before you leave earth," Gaga said in an inter
view with Google. The power ballad does
seem to soar to epic, rapture-esque heights
with its heavy 'Bos influences, manifested in

electropop synthesizers and a guest saxo
phone solo by E Street Band-er Clarence
demons.
Crawford thought Mixed Co.'s talents
ideally suited the Gaga song.
"I mean, this song just is pure energy. It's
all about energy, the celebration of life," Chen
said. "What [Crawford] liked best about us
was our energy."
The group had to capitalize on that

enthusiasm to make the tight deadlines. With
only one Monday rehearsal to learn the song,
Mixed Co. rallied and spent 10 hours record
ing the cover two days later. Not all of Mixed
Co. made it into the studio just 10 mem
bers are featured, two from each of the vocal
sections (soprano, alto and bass) along with a percus
sionist and soloist.
"Basically, this entire thing happened within like 10
days from inception to final product," Cope said. "It's
really exciting."
The end result sounds like something you might
hear on a certain Fox series about show choirs.
"Yeah it sounds pretty' Glee'; a lot of it is super pro
duced," Cope said. "But I'm just blown away by how
professional it sounds and how amazing our soloist was.
I couldn't be happier."
Mixed Co. usually arranges its own songs in-house,
but due to the time crunch, deferred to a professional,
outside arranger.
"This whole process was very manufactured, but I
think after everyone heard the final product, there's no
denying it was an absolutely amazing experience" Chen
said.
Soloist Lauren Ottinger 'l3 was selected for lead
vocals just two days before the single was recorded.
"I always get weirded out hearing my own voice on
an album, but it's been really, really fun," Ottinger said. "I
think it was really an effort by the entire group."
