With typical flair, the Mendicants
opened their spring show
"Harry Potter and the Deathly
Mendicants" by running through the cen
ter aisle and handing roses to female audi
ence members. Opening with a soulful ver
sion of "Sh-Boom (Life Could Be a
Dream)" set the tone for a show full of fin
ger-snapping, feel-good music.
"Our spring show was the capstone to
our year as a group," said Derek Ouyang
'l3. "We've sung many on-campus and off
campus gigs, been on tour through Texas
and recorded 13 tracks for our 25th album,
so this show was an incredible way to wrap
up all the work we have done and treat our
friends to some fun music."
The group sang six songs from their
upcoming album, singing fresh and upbeat

covers of contemporary songs like "Sunday
Morning" and "Girl on TV". They also per
formed Mendicants hits such as "Brown-Eyed
Girl" and "Build Me Up, Buttercup" to the
great delight of students and alumni alike.
In their 90-minute show, they tra
versed a number of genres and time peri
ods, approaching all with suaveness and a
good dose of melisma. The group also
showed its spectrum of talents through
showcases of beat-boxing, guitar and even
a mouth-trumpet solo.
The loudest reaction, however, was to
the Mendicants version of Cee-Lo Green's
"Fuck You."
"As soon as we heard it, we pretty
much knew that it was a perfect song for
the Mendicants," Ouyang said, explaining
its appeal. "De Wei whipped up this awe-

some arrangement, and pretty soon we
found that it was mutating into a variety of
different forms. Matt Alcasid [the soloist]
just absolutely rocks the song, and I have a
feeling it's going to be a classic for a long
time, the modern heartbreak-revenge
song."
And the theme?
"The Harry Potter theme really came
out of nowhere," Ouyang said, "but we came
up with three really hilarious skits that only
marginally tied the show together. What was
more important was that we had plenty of
brand new songs to debut, mixed with some
classics for the alumni to enjoy."
