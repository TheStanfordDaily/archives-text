# SUMMER CONCERT GUIDE

Congratulations! You got your amazing internship up in
San Francisco/secured your research position on cam
pus. You're in for three months of the gorgeous
California summer we all know and love, and the target of jeal
ousy among your acquaintances. So why not give them good
reason to be jealous: bust out the nine-to-five and then take
advantage of the unrivaled opportunities to catch some great
music in the City.
The Bay Area is a must-stop for all major artists on tour
over the summer, regardless of the genre they're playing. It also
boasts a wide variety of venues, from stadiums suited for arena
oriented rock (AOR) to alternative underground clubs suited for
the carefully cultivated nonchalance of the indie scene.
Evidently, the opportunities to catch live music over the summer
are interminable. But if you really want to catch the best of the
best and not just head over to squeal at Justin Bieber (who,
ahem, you can catch at the Mountain Winery in Saratoga on
June 11 if you're willing to shell out a couple grand), read on.

Absolute Must
Florence and The Machine: June
12, Greek Theatre in Berkeley.
Forget Lady Gaga, Florence
Welch is the bomb and may well
be the David Bowie of our age.
Red-haired, six feet tall with an
onstage wardrobe self-described
as "Lady of Shalott meets
Ophelia...mixed with scary goth
ic bat lady," Florence's searing
onstage persona is lauded by the

world as the most spectacularly captivating one-woman show.
Did we mention she can sing? So head on over to Cal to catch
her effervescent mix of soul and pop off of her debut record
«T »
Lungs.

African Influences
Youssou N'Dour and Angelique Kidjo:
June 17, Paramount Theatre in San
Francisco
Possibly the two greatest, and hands-down
the most famous, singers in recent African
history come together for the San
Francisco Jazz Spring Season. Both are
amazing vocalists, and the emotional

quality of their music is breathtaking. If you're down for some
thing mellower than indie rock, check out this dynamic duo.

Because She Just Won't Go Away

Britney Spears and Nicki Minaj:
June 18, HP Pavillion in San
Jose
Admit it. You're curious.
Promoting her "comeback" (is it
the third now?) album, "Femme
Fatale", Miss Spears will be
appearing down in San Jose
with Nicki Minaj as her opening
act. Crass female rapper crossed
with raunchy pop star? If you
don't mind not hearing live
music at a concert, by all means.

Three In One
Okkervil River, Titus Andronicus and Julianna Barwick:
June 22, Fox Theater in Oakland
It's a great chance to experience three great indie bands that
are making waves. While Okkervil River, the more established
band and therefore the headliner, barely dropped its latest
release "I Am Very Far", on May 10, Titus Andronicus released
"The Monitor" last year, while Miss Barwick released "The
Magic Place" in March. A solid pick for the indie fan that
wants to get the most acts in one night.
The Class-A Summer Festival
Outside Lands: August 12-14, Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco.
Featuring the likes of Arcade Fire, The Black Keys, Muse, The
Shins, MGMT and plenty of other well-known and lesser
known acts, Outside Lands is San Francisco's answer to
Chicago's Lollapalooza. A three-day weekend chock-full of
great music and a laidback atmosphere in San Francisco's
most scenic park if there is one event you should not miss
over the summer, it's probably Outside Lands.

The Little Band That Could
Givers: September 7, Rickshaw Stop in San Francisco.
Five friends from Lafayette, Louisiana met in high school and
college and came up with one of the sunniest tracks of 2010.
"Up, Up, Up" landed the band the coveted title of "Band to
Watch" by the indie institution that is Stereogum, and now
brings the band to San Francisco. Check them out for psyche
delic feel-good pop before the start of autumn.
