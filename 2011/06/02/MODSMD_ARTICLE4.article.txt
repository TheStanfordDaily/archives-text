### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
President Barack Obama plans to nomi
nate political science professor Michael Mc-
Faul 'B6 M. A. 'B6 to the post of U.S. ambassa
dor to Russia. Pending confirmation by the
Senate, McFaul will succeed John Beyrle,
who assumed the role of ambassador in 2008.
Officials said Obama informed the Russ
ian president, Dmitri Medvedev, of his selec
tion last week at a G-8 meeting in France.
The decision broke a longstanding tradition
of designating career diplomats to serve as
envoys to Russia; in the last three decades,
seven out of eight ambassadors have been
professional diplomats.

McFaul, 47, is a leading expert on U.S.-
Russian relations and currently serves on the
National Security Council as the president's
top advisor in this capacity. He was one of
several Stanford professors chosen for
Obama's transition team in the months after
the 2008 presidential election.
At present, the scholar-advisor is a key
player in the president's "reset" policy for
U.S.-Russian relations, which, among other

things, aims to promote shared economic in
terests and mutual understanding between
the two nations.

Before rising to international prominence,
McFaul was formerly the director of the Cen
ter for Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law (CDDRL) and deputy director
of the Freeman Spogli Institute (FSI) for In
ternational Studies. He was named the Peter
and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover
Institution, but is currently on leave from this
position.
Current CDDRL Director Larry Dia
mond '73 M.A. '7B Ph.D. 'BO, who has worked
closely with McFaul through the years, com
mended his colleague for being "extremely
effective in his current role as the special as
sistant to the president."
"He's managed not only to achieve a very
important arms control agreement and to
'reset' U.S.-Russian relations . . . but he's
[also] managed to make a lot of progress in
realizing what he has long argued to be a nec
essary balance in American foreign policy,
between pursuing strategic interests and
standing up for our principles," Diamond
said.
He added that many proponents of de
mocratization and rule of law in Russia are
heartened by McFaul's expected move to
