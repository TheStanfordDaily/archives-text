# SUMMER MOVIE PREVIEW

We all know that the perfect summer
night consists of a best friend, some
extremely fattening popcorn you'll
regret having eaten the next morning and a
great (or so bad it's good) movie to curl up
with. Whether you're looking for a new take on
a childhood classic or the highly-anticipated
end to an epic saga, the summer 2011 releases
promise to offer a healthy mix of good and bad
for your viewing pleasure.

The Good:
"Winnie the Pooh"
Genre: Animation
Starring: Jim Cummings, Tom Kenny, Craig
Ferguson
Release Date: July 15,2011
The first movie based on the Pooh stories since
1977, "Winnie the Pooh" is Walt Disney
Studio's retake on a childhood favorite. "Pooh"
will feature traditional animation and two pre
viously unadapted stories and should be an
adorable way to spend an afternoon.

"The Tree of Life"
Genre: Drama
Starring: Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain
Release Date: May 27,2011
Terrence Malick's latest work generated signifi
cant Oscar buzz at the Cannes Film Festival,
where it won the much sought-after Palme
d'Or. Though it has a rather ambiguously
worded plot synopsis, this film, set in the 1950s
Midwest and starring Sean Penn as the main
character, Jack, should prove to be an enlight
ening take on the transition from adolescence
to adulthood.

"X-Men: First Class"

Genre: Action/ Adventure
Starring: James McAvoy, Rose Byrne, January
Jones, Jennifer Lawrence
Release Date: Jun. 3,2011
Based on the Marvel Comics books, the movie
covers the beginning of the X-Men saga, serv
ing as a precursor to the previously released
films in the series. A little bit sci-fi, a good part
action and featuring a whole lot of attractive
ness, this movie should be a win for both hard
core fans and the average Joe.

"30 Minutes or Less"
Genre: Comedy
Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Aziz Ansari
Release Date: Aug. 26,2011
If you're looking for a hysterical movie, the cast
of "30 Minutes or Less" should lead you right
into a red cushioned seat on its opening day.
Disregarding the hilariousness of Aziz Ansari,
the classic "dumb criminals take clueless pro
tagonists by surprise" always proves to be a
good choice for a comedy.

"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:

Part II"
Genre:
Action/ Adventure,
Fantasy
Starring: Daniel
Radcliffe, Rupert
Grint, Emma
Watson, Alan
Rickman
Release Date: Jul.
15,2011
By far the most
anticipated movie
of the summer,

"Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows: Part II" will be the final
installment of the decade-long Harry Potter
film series (in case you've been living under a
rock). Judging from the trailer, the film should
be worthy of the hype "Part II" seems as
action-filled and jaw-dropping as the second
half of the seventh book proved to be. Besides,
you'll probably be pressured into seeing it by a
friend, so you might as well enjoy the movie.

The Questionable:
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon"
Genre: Action/ Adventure
Starring: Shia Laßeouf, Josh Duhamel, Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley, Tyrese Gibson
Release Date: Jul. 1,2011
If you're wondering why you should go see yet
another Transformers movie, you'll be search
ing for an answer for quite a while. Though
Rosie Huntington-Whiteley should be an inter
esting new character to the mix, the
"Transformers" series is light enough on actual
plot that the first two movies have been more
than enough to satisfy real fans.

"Cowboys and Aliens"
Genre: Action, Sci-Fi
Starring: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia

Wilde
Release Date: July 29,2011
This movie has generated lots of hype, but the
plot seems pretty shaky. Aliens invading a
Western town (predictably called Absolution)
doesn't sound like a good movie in any context,
disregarding the very talented cast of Daniel
Craig and Harrison Ford, among others.

"Conan the Barbarian"
Genre: Action/ Adventure, Fantasy
Starring: Jason Momoa, Rose McGowan,
Rachel Nichols
Release Date: August 19,2011
"Conan the Barbarian" stars Jason Momoa as
Conan, a brute who battles monsters, witches
and archers in his bloodthirsty search for
revenge. Sounds like a great movie if you're
into watching two hours of dismemberment.

"Super 8"
Genre: Mystery
Starring: Kyle
Chandler, Elle
Fanning, AJ
Michalka
Release Date:
June 10,2011
"Super 8" is a

movie about people filming some mysterious,
possibly alien activity. Sound familiar?
Although that may sound like a rehash of a
gazillion other sci-fi flicks, with Steven
Spielberg producing and J.J. Abrams at the
helm, "Super 8" might not be one to immedi
ately cross off your list.

"Apollo 18"
Genre: Horror
Release Date: August 26,2011
Like "Super 8," "Apollo 18" is a 'documentary'
of'footage,' this time from a government
hushed mission to the moon. Yes, the distrib
uters actually claimed, originally, that the film
was real, a la marketing for "The Blair Witch
Project," but a dozen years later. "Apollo 18"
already proves to be terrible.

half of the seventh book proved to be. Besides,
you'll probably be pressured into seeing it by a
friend, so you might as well enjoy the movie.

The Questionable:
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon"
Genre: Action/ Adventure
Starring: Shia Laßeouf, Josh Duhamel, Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley, Tyrese Gibson
Release Date: Jul. 1,2011
If you're wondering why you should go see yet
another Transformers movie, you'll be search
ing for an answer for quite a while. Though
Rosie Huntington-Whiteley should be an inter
esting new character to the mix, the
"Transformers" series is light enough on actual
plot that the first two movies have been more
than enough to satisfy real fans.

"Cowboys and Aliens"
Genre: Action, Sci-Fi
Starring: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia

Wilde
Release Date: July 29,2011
This movie has generated lots of hype, but the
plot seems pretty shaky. Aliens invading a
Western town (predictably called Absolution)
doesn't sound like a good movie in any context,
disregarding the very talented cast of Daniel
Craig and Harrison Ford, among others.

"Conan the Barbarian"
Genre: Action/ Adventure, Fantasy
Starring: Jason Momoa, Rose McGowan,
Rachel Nichols
Release Date: August 19,2011
"Conan the Barbarian" stars Jason Momoa as
Conan, a brute who battles monsters, witches
and archers in his bloodthirsty search for
revenge. Sounds like a great movie if you're
into watching two hours of dismemberment.

"Super 8"
Genre: Mystery
Starring: Kyle
Chandler, Elle
Fanning, AJ
Michalka
Release Date:
June 10,2011
"Super 8" is a

movie about people filming some mysterious,
possibly alien activity. Sound familiar?
Although that may sound like a rehash of a
gazillion other sci-fi flicks, with Steven
Spielberg producing and J.J. Abrams at the
helm, "Super 8" might not be one to immedi
ately cross off your list.

"Apollo 18"
Genre: Horror
Release Date: August 26,2011
Like "Super 8," "Apollo 18" is a 'documentary'
of'footage,' this time from a government
hushed mission to the moon. Yes, the distrib
uters actually claimed, originally, that the film
was real, a la marketing for "The Blair Witch
Project," but a dozen years later. "Apollo 18"
already proves to be terrible.

We all know that the perfect summer
night consists of a best friend, some
extremely fattening popcorn you'll
regret having eaten the next morning and a
great (or so bad it's good) movie to curl up
with. Whether you're looking for a new take on
a childhood classic or the highly-anticipated
end to an epic saga, the summer 2011 releases
promise to offer a healthy mix of good and bad
for your viewing pleasure.

The Good:
"Winnie the Pooh"
Genre: Animation
Starring: Jim Cummings, Tom Kenny, Craig
Ferguson
Release Date: July 15,2011
The first movie based on the Pooh stories since
1977, "Winnie the Pooh" is Walt Disney
Studio's retake on a childhood favorite. "Pooh"
will feature traditional animation and two pre
viously unadapted stories and should be an
adorable way to spend an afternoon.

"The Tree of Life"
Genre: Drama
Starring: Brad Pitt, Sean Penn, Jessica Chastain
Release Date: May 27,2011
Terrence Malick's latest work generated signifi
cant Oscar buzz at the Cannes Film Festival,
where it won the much sought-after Palme
d'Or. Though it has a rather ambiguously
worded plot synopsis, this film, set in the 1950s
Midwest and starring Sean Penn as the main
character, Jack, should prove to be an enlight
ening take on the transition from adolescence
to adulthood.

"X-Men: First Class"

Genre: Action/ Adventure
Starring: James McAvoy, Rose Byrne, January
Jones, Jennifer Lawrence
Release Date: Jun. 3,2011
Based on the Marvel Comics books, the movie
covers the beginning of the X-Men saga, serv
ing as a precursor to the previously released
films in the series. A little bit sci-fi, a good part
action and featuring a whole lot of attractive
ness, this movie should be a win for both hard
core fans and the average Joe.

"30 Minutes or Less"
Genre: Comedy
Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Aziz Ansari
Release Date: Aug. 26,2011
If you're looking for a hysterical movie, the cast
of "30 Minutes or Less" should lead you right
into a red cushioned seat on its opening day.
Disregarding the hilariousness of Aziz Ansari,
the classic "dumb criminals take clueless pro
tagonists by surprise" always proves to be a
good choice for a comedy.

"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:

Part II"
Genre:
Action/ Adventure,
Fantasy
Starring: Daniel
Radcliffe, Rupert
Grint, Emma
Watson, Alan
Rickman
Release Date: Jul.
15,2011
By far the most
anticipated movie
of the summer,

"Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows: Part II" will be the final
installment of the decade-long Harry Potter
film series (in case you've been living under a
rock). Judging from the trailer, the film should
be worthy of the hype "Part II" seems as
action-filled and jaw-dropping as the second
half of the seventh book proved to be. Besides,
you'll probably be pressured into seeing it by a
friend, so you might as well enjoy the movie.
