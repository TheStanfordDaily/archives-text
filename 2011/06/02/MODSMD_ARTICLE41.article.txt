### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
With classes and finals almost out of the way and the joys
of summer about to begin, everyone needs a few good
books to read on the beach, on the plane or during
their commute to work, especially ones that aren't textbooks or
academic studies. Intermission's got your guide to summer reading
the fun kind (remember that?):

Summer Releases
"A Dance with Dragons" by George R. R.
Martin (July 12)

Given the success of the recent HBO
series "Game of Thrones," it should come as
no surprise that this is one of the most antici
pated books of the summer. That, and the fact
that fans have been waiting nearly six years for
"A Dance with Dragons." The preceding book,
"A Feast for Crows," came out in 2005.

"State of Wonder" by Ann Patchett (June 7
Patchett has a track record of produc
ing moving, critically-acclaimed novels that
straddle the nebulous divide between com
mercial and literary (previous books include
the popular "Bel Canto" and "Run"). "State
of Wonder," which features corporate
intrigue, South American cannibals, phar
maceuticals research and strong female
characters, promises to be just as good.

"Robopocalypse" by Daniel H. Wilson (June 7)
The much-lauded Wilson has landed on the New York Times list
multiple times, and "Robopocalypse" looks to be another winner. It
plays upon a bone-deep fear that's been around as long as computers
have the AI invasion and does so masterfully, with intense
action, high-concept horror and above all, the acutely sympathetic
human element that lesser sci-fi often lacks. Plus, where on earth are
there more mad (computer) scientists than here on the Farm?

Books You May Have Missed This Year
"Mockingj ay" by Suzanne Collins
The popular "The Hunger Games" trilogy has been compared
to "Harry Potter" and "Twilight" anyone who hasn't at least

heard of it has been living under a rock for
the past year. "Mockingjay" is the last
installment of the series, and the first book
is coming out as a film next year.

"The Dressmaker of Khair Khana" by
Gayle Tzemach Lemmon
Fans of "The Kite Runner" and "Three
Cups of Tea" will love Lemmon's debut
work; the true story of a young Afghani

schoolteacher who is forced to wear a
burqa and leave the classroom after the
Taliban takes power. In order to make ends
meet, she starts sewing dresses for local
stores, and ends up running a secret dress
making business that employs almost a
hundred local women. The book has
already been racking up rave reviews from
diverse sources don't miss out.

"On China" by Henry Kissinger
Despite having retired from the political scene over 30 years ago,
the former Secretary of State is still an important and somewhat contro
versial figure among policy makers and the general public. One of his
most famous accomplishments was the opening of relations with China,
which, given the country's ascendancy in global affairs, makes Kissinger's
insights and experience all the more relevant today. (Disclosure: I have
interned for Penguin Books, which publishes "On China.")

Relevant Classics
"Hamlet" by William Shakespeare
Most people first read "Hamlet" in high school, but how many
truly appreciate Shakespeare (without Spark Notes) when they're
15? "Hamlet" is ripe for a revisit; it's loaded with teen angst, identity
crises and daddy issues, which should sound awfully familiar to col
lege students, from freshmen home for the summer after their first
year away to seniors leaving the Stanford bubble and about to make
their own way in the world.

"I, Claudius" by Robert Graves
Graves paints a compelling, sympathetic portrait of one of
Rome's most trivialized emperors. Claudius suffered from a speech
impediment and chronic physical infirmities, which made him vul
nerable to assassination throughout his reign. (Ironically, the only rea
son he survived his predecessors' purges to eventually become emper
or was because they continually underestimated him.) He triumphed
over all of these difficulties by brains alone and became one of
Rome's most capable and efficient emperors an underdog story to
which many Stanford students can surely relate.

"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald
This is another standard high school
English text, which usually ended up popu
lar with the hipster crowd and "just another
assigned reading" to most other students.
Living the college life, though, gives readers
a whole new perspective on Fitzgerald's
most famous work; those undergrads
blessed with that privileged commodity of a
good draw number find themselves throw
ing house parties not quite as lavish as

Gatsby's Long Island affairs and then contemplating the meaning
lessness of it all on Monday morning.
