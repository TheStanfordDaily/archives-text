Move over, "Twilight."
A new book series is
poised to take over
American cinema.
"The Hunger Games," the
wildly popular post-apocalyptic
book series written by Suzanne
Collins, is rocking the entertain
ment industry as it comes to life
for an upcoming movie adapta
tion by director Gary Ross,
known for his work on
"Seabiscuit" and "Pleasantville."
The novel tells the story of
Katniss Everdeen, a self-reliant,
cynical teenager who partici
pates in the Hunger Games, a
yearly event organized by the
evil government of Panem, a
country composed of the
remains of the U.S. after envi-

ronmental catastrophe
destroyed most of the country.
The Hunger Games are Panem's
way of keeping the twelve dis
tricts of the country in line. In
the Games, two teenagers from
each district are chosen to fight
to the death on live television.

Katniss volunteers to represent
District Twelve, a poor coal-mining district, to save her
younger sister Primrose from the same fate.
Despite the dark subject matter, Collins' series has
only grown in popularity since the original book release
in 2008. With legions of intensely loyal fans who critical
ly oversaw the casting of the film, the hype has intensi
fied even though the movie has barely begun filming.
The casting of Jennifer Lawrence (known for her
Oscar-nominated turn in "Winter's Bone") as Katniss lit
up the blogosphere back in March. While her acting
skills are undeniable, fans criticized Lawrence for being
too blonde and curvy to play Katniss, described as an
emaciated, olive-skinned teen. However, Collins herself
defended the casting choice, saying "I never thought
we'd find somebody this perfect for the role. And I can't
wait for everyone to see her play it."

("The Kids Are Alright") and Liam Hemsworth ("The
Last Song") were announced to have joined the cast as
love interests Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne.
A few bigger names, like Elizabeth Banks as han
dler Effie Trinket, Lenny Kravitz as Katniss's stylist and
friend Cinna, Stanley Tucci as TV host Caesar
Flickerman and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch,
District 12's only living survivor of the games, rounded
out the casting news.
With the cast set, the hype now surrounds the
filming of the Hunger Games in the rumored location
of North Carolina. Lawrence is currently undergoing
training to learn how to hunt, fight and shoot Katniss's
signature bow-and-arrow. She made a splash with a
recent Entertainment Weekly cover showing her in
character for the first time; her trademark blonde locks
dyed a dark brown.
Be prepared for months of speculation and hype
surrounding the film, which will not be released until
Mar. 23,2012. Until then, it might be a good idea to
read Suzanne Collin's dystopic trilogy to be prepared
for when full-on "Hunger Games" mania hits the U.S.
next year.
