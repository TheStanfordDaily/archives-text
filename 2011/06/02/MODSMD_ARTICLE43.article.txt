Y ■ funny, goofy panda bear Po (Jack Black)
returns in the eagerly-awaited "Kung Fu
-A- Panda 2" with new jokes, an identity crisis
blended with daddy issues and some striking new
kung fu moves. These elements are all seamlessly

incorporated into the film

making it a cute treat
for the whole family.
Ready to tackle I
any villain who poses '
a danger to China, the
Dragon Warrior Po has

become, in stark contrast to the first "Kung Fu
Panda", a force to be reckoned with performing
some perfect combination hits with the Furious Five
and pummeling the enemy wolves. However, an even
greater danger arrives when a vicious peacock, Lord
Shen (Gary Oldman), develops a powerful weapon
that threatens to end the dominance of kung fu
the gunpowder cannon. To prevent this evil from
plunging the land into the darkness of Lord Shen's
horrible reign, the Dragon Warrior and his faithful
companions are called upon to save the day. Able to
stuff 38 or 40 bean buns in his ridiculously
large mouth, Po thinks, of course, that Shen is no
match for his size and awesomeness until he has a
flashback in the middle of a fight, a vision of his
mother abandoning him. Master Shifu (Dustin
Hoffman) instructs the confused and wounded Po to
set out on a journey to attain "inner peace."
Thus, Po goes to meet his fate and face his
nemesis, the white peacock, Lord Shen. The newly
introduced antagonist has a crazed look in his eye
that says he would blow up the whole world with his
cannons if he could. One of the movie's strengths,
however, is that there is much more to each character
than meets the eye. Even the evil peacock ends up
somewhat sympathetic he is simply seeking
approval from his own parents, who have disowned
him for past crimes. The lead-in at the start of the
movie shadow puppetry, incorporating traditional
Chinese elements is a beautifully illustrated histo
ry of the villain's former life.
