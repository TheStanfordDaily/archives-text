# FOREVER YOUNG?
## RECONCILING DREAMS & REALISM 
### – nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
Like most kids, my friends and I loved
to play make-believe. We'd travel into
the worlds of our favorite games,
building Hyrule Castle out of sofa pillows
and fending off Stalfos with our arrows of
light our enemies were Legos and our
weapons were Nerf guns, but we didn't care.
Zelda was probably our go-to fantasy realm,
but I'd be disingenuous if I didn't admit to
shouting out the names of beam attacks
from Dragon Ball Z and attempting to dress
up my buddy's dog like Star Fox. Even if
that last one didn't go so well, those are
memories I'll cherish. Back then, video
game worlds just seemed like more interest
ing places to be.
Fast forward to the present day—this
very week, in fact. As I slide ever closer to
the precipice of coffee and commutes that is
adulthood, those days seem far behind.
What's more, I fear that I'm dangerously
close to losing the imaginative spark that
made our fake Pokemon adventures and
runs through the Death Star trench so
much fun. It might be my hangover talking,
but I seem have taken on a jaded sort of
cynicism that just won't let me take that
mental journey into game worlds the way I
used to.
I was reminded of that just yesterday,
when I heard another grown man go on
and on about how great it would be to step
into the shoes of inFamous's delivery boy
turned-superhero, Cole MacGrath. Even
with the temporary funk of adulthood-itis
that I find myself in, I could give him just a
bit of leeway—the man speaking was Eric
Ladin, Cole's voice actor and mocap model
for the upcoming inFamous 2. When Greg
Miller of IGN asked why he wanted to play
Cole, Ladin's answer was understandable,
but it still made me cringe a little.
"Come on man, he's a superhero!
You're a guy... I mean, wouldn't you want
to play Cole? It's every guy's dream," he said.
I admit that I'd probably give a similar
answer for a Podcast interview leading up to
my game's release, and while I don't want to

put words in Ladin's mouth, a fact remains
his answer, and probably anyone else's,
implies that actually being a video game
character would be incredible. Better than
real life, even.
I'm tempted to agree for the sake of
doing mental CPR on my childhood
dreams, but at least for now, it's an exercise
in futility. When I think about what it
would really be like to, say, wear tacky over
alls, jump into pipes and step on goombas
all day, it just seems ridiculous. I snap back
into the real world, curl up with my coffee
and think about what I need to get done
that day.
Part of me is a bit proud that I can
function like a real-life adult. Another part
is afraid that my childhood fantasies the
ones that my friends and I reveled in so
much are slipping away forever.
For the sake of my own world-weary
vindication, excuse me while I cathartically
dismantle some of my other childhood
treasures. Let's start with Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles, something my buddies and I
still wax nostalgic about all the time. So,
you'd be a complete freak of nature, live in a
sewer and despite the fact that you can't
procreate, you're secretly obsessed with nail
ing a reporter with a yellow jumpsuit and a
bad case of 80s-hair. Kowabunga, dudes.
The world of Metal Gear Solid isn't
much better. You'd be a little more badass
than a turtle, but you'd be stuck freezing
your ass off in the Aleutian Islands, crouch
ing in the snow with a hand to your ear
while some bigwig drones on for hours on
your codec. When you finally got around to
your "sneaking mission," you'd discover that
Uncle Sam left you with little more than
cigarettes, military rations and a cardboard
box. Oh, and your name is Solid Snake.
You'd probably still be coping with the
snickers you always got during roll call back
in middle school.
And then there's my old favorite
Zelda. How does this sound? For starters,
you wouldn't have electricity, plumbing

or modern transportation. You sleep on a
log, dress like you're at the Renaissance
Festival every day and the world's only
accepted currency is gigantic, cumbersome
gems. You can't fit more than 500 rupees in
your wallet and there aren't any banks, so to
make ends meet you need to storm into
strangers' houses and smash everything in
sight. If not, you could try hacking your
sword at inexplicably identical bushes across
the land. Crazy chickens come attack you,
there's an incessant beeping whenever you
get hurt and you're followed at all times by a
crazy fairy that won't shut up. And the
worst part? You can't even speak back
There's no escaping the fact that games
are completely ridiculous. I might be too
old too naively dream my way into some
game-driven fantasy world, but after reflect
ing on it a bit, I'm okay with that. As a kid,
games added substance and drama to my
life. Things were pretty low-stakes in my
quiet suburban neighborhood, and games
gave me something to worry and wonder
about something that added a bit of
intrigue, emotion and complexity to my life.
Nowadays, my life is full of enough
drama, work and worrying all on its own.
But games still add balance to the mix and
provide an escape of a different sort. Their
crazy, overly simplistic worlds give me the
perfect break from the monotony of my
daily routine a breath of fresh air that
gets me ready to go back and tackle my real
world problems.
So while I can still chuckle at the
underlying insanity of Zelda and Mario, I
wouldn't have them any other way. Games
aren't the same pretend-paradise that they
used to be in my life, but even in adulthood,
I cherish them just as much.
