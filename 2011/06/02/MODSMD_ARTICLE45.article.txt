## ROXY SASS Summer Lovin' 
### 
Well, folks,
Roxy can
no longer

deny two things: that she's a bit of a
slut, and that school is ending. The
first is probably not news, but the
second might be if you've had your
head buried in the sand hoping to
avoid the end of another Stanford
year (trust Roxy, four go byway too
quickly).
Scared of summer? Too bad,
suckers. It's here so Roxy's going to
give you tips on how to embrace it
fully.
Roxy knows how it goes: you get
a fancy internship in a big city and are
pumped to move there for a summer
(#omglivingthelifebitches) until it's
time for first month's rent, damage
deposit and feeding yourself for a
week. No, your row house chef doesn't
actually move with you to New York.
If, like Roxy, you can't handle the sud
den expenses of living on your own,
enter new character: the sugar daddy
(or mama Roxy doesn't discrimi
nate). Roxy's investment in a set of

dassy-yet-slutty dresses once paid for
an entire month's worth of food (and
rent). Don't befriend your fellow
(broke) interns; pimp yourself out in
the most respectable way possible
until you find someone who'll buy
you dinner.

Or, as Roxy has experienced, you
might have just met that wonderful
lad or lass cute, witty, totally also
into [insert favorite band here] —but
summer's coming, and they're headed
on a service trip to South Africa while
you're interning in San Francisco.
Roxy has one word for you: Skype.
What exactly to do with Skype? Roxy
hates to give away the surprise. Figure
that one out yourself. Hint: putting the
chat in sepia tone really aids in histori

cal fiction role-play. Oh my heavens!
For the otherwise unattached,
summer is a great time to explore

something new while
keeping that quasi-fling
on call for fell. Droves of
international students (ay
caramba!) will flock to

campus for summer class, and
younger types (if that's your thing)
abound at tennis camps and EPGY.
(For those jonesin' for an older model,
Cougar Convention is in South San
Francisco this year.) Any summer fling
will be gone in the fall, so Roxy gives
you permission to take a mulligan on
any late-night regrets.
And that, friends, marks the end
of Roxy's last column of the year.
Carry on the Roxy spirit this summer
by flirting up a storm in very little
clothing, by getting experimental in
the lab and in the bedroom and by
infusing all your writing with just a lit
tle bit of sexual innuendo. Keep calm
and slut on.

Roxy's going to be in the Stanford area
this summer. If you are too, let her know
so she can add you to her to-do list:
