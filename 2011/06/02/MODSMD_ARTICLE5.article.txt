## Exec selects cabinet, board Macgregor-Dennis aims for a 'radically different' team 
### JANELLE WOLAK STAFF WRITER 
After 18 hours of interviews, ASSU Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2, Vice President Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 and Chief of Staff
Emma Ogiemwanye 'l2 finalized their roster
for the executive cabinet and the newly creat
ed community board. According to Macgre
gor-Dennis, the structure and mission of the ex
ecutive team are "already revolutionary" and
"radically different."
The student leaders held their first meeting
with the cabinet and board last Saturday after
noon.
"The vision for this year is to try to become
the world's most innovative student govern
ment," Macgregor-Dennis said.

"Almost every other department at Stan
ford and in the Silicon Valley is at the cutting
edge," he added. "So we're trying to bring the
student government up to the same level."
This year's ASSU Executive is substantially
larger than those of previous years, featuring
16 members in the executive cabinet and 18 on
the community board.
As a result, Ogiemwanye will not be the sole
person responsible for supervising the execu
tive team; Macgregor-Dennis will serve as
"point of contact" for seven of the members
and Ogiemwanye for nine. Communities Chair
Aracely Mondragon 'l3 will be the point of
contact for the 18 community board members.
In the applications for the 2011-12 execu
tive team, Macgregor-Dennis and
Ogiemwanye gave students the option to apply
for chair positions of their own creation.
"The whole point of the cabinet is to be a re
flection of hot spots for the campus, a reflection
of things that a large number of stu
dents are interested in,"
Ogiemwanye said. "Instead of just
deciding what those things are, we
decided to open it up to everybody
else and see what we were missing.
We actually got some really good
ideas."
Shadi Bushra 'l2 and Jonah
Rexer 'l2 proposed establishing a
chair of global engagement and will
both serve in that cabinet position.
According to Ogiemwanye, the two
balance each other out because
Bushra is "the man out on the
streets" while Rexer is a "knowl
edge resource." Together, they will
spearhead initiatives similar to the
Japan and Haiti relief efforts.
Another new position is the food
chair held by Janani Balasubraman
ian 'l4, who will use her position to
"connect various movements and
service groups," Ogiemwanye said.
DanThompson'l3 and Jonathan
Manzi 'l3, who have started their
own companies, will work as chairs
of entrepreneurship. One of their
goals is to establish an entrepre
neurship-themed dorm on campus.
Vineet Singal 'l2, founder of
Anjna Patient Education, will serve
as the chair of social entrepreneur
ship. Singal hopes to develop the
necessary infrastructure to enable
students to start their own social en-

trepreneurship projects on campus.
According to Ogiemwanye, the
ASSU has struggled in past years
with the translation of "the rhetoric
of tolerance into results." With this
in mind, Cruz and Macgregor-Den
nis established the community
board led by Mondragon and made
up of leaders from various commu
nities across campus.
The community board will in
clude Vivian Wong 'l2, last year's
chair of disabilities; Justin Lam,
head of the Asian-American Stu
dents' Association (AASA);
Chiney Ogwumike 'l4, forward on
the women's varsity basketball
team; and others.
"The ASSU has great ideas, but

they're not necessarily fit to the
communities that they're targeted
at... which creates a disconnect,"
Ogiemwanye said. "But if you have
a group of people who already have
an understanding of the needs of the
community, then you don't have to
worry so much."
"We're going to take what
they're doing to the next level,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "It's about
taking specific initiatives and scal
ing them up to the entire campus."
According to director of design
thinking Nishant Jacob 'l3, the goal
of next year's meetings is to move
away from "the old dogmatic struc
ture" where energy often "dies" to a
more collaborative "design think
ing" style. To that effect, Jacob and
Macgregor-Dennis encouraged
cabinet members to "connect on a
human level" by interviewing each
other about their goals and visions
at last Saturday's meeting. They
then brainstormed ways to keep
next year's meetings efficient, ener
getic and positive.
"Student government tends to
spend an enormous amount of time
in meetings, choosing sides and try
ing to defend those sides," Jacob
said. "The most effective way to
break through that is to replace that
binary dialogue with collaborative
brainstorm sessions."
"You reserve judgment, you en
courage wild ideas, you keep the en
ergy up," he added.

ecutive team are "already revolutionary" and
"radically different."
The student leaders held their first meeting
with the cabinet and board last Saturday after
noon.
"The vision for this year is to try to become
the world's most innovative student govern
ment," Macgregor-Dennis said.

"Almost every other department at Stan
ford and in the Silicon Valley is at the cutting
edge," he added. "So we're trying to bring the
student government up to the same level."
This year's ASSU Executive is substantially
larger than those of previous years, featuring
16 members in the executive cabinet and 18 on
the community board.
As a result, Ogiemwanye will not be the sole
person responsible for supervising the execu
tive team; Macgregor-Dennis will serve as
"point of contact" for seven of the members
and Ogiemwanye for nine. Communities Chair
Aracely Mondragon 'l3 will be the point of
contact for the 18 community board members.
In the applications for the 2011-12 execu
tive team, Macgregor-Dennis and
Ogiemwanye gave students the option to apply
for chair positions of their own creation.
"The whole point of the cabinet is to be a re
flection of hot spots for the campus, a reflection
of things that a large number of stu
dents are interested in,"
Ogiemwanye said. "Instead of just
deciding what those things are, we
decided to open it up to everybody
else and see what we were missing.
We actually got some really good
ideas."
Shadi Bushra 'l2 and Jonah
Rexer 'l2 proposed establishing a
chair of global engagement and will
both serve in that cabinet position.
According to Ogiemwanye, the two
balance each other out because
Bushra is "the man out on the
streets" while Rexer is a "knowl
edge resource." Together, they will
spearhead initiatives similar to the
Japan and Haiti relief efforts.
Another new position is the food
chair held by Janani Balasubraman
ian 'l4, who will use her position to
"connect various movements and
service groups," Ogiemwanye said.
DanThompson'l3 and Jonathan
Manzi 'l3, who have started their
own companies, will work as chairs
of entrepreneurship. One of their
goals is to establish an entrepre
neurship-themed dorm on campus.
Vineet Singal 'l2, founder of
Anjna Patient Education, will serve
as the chair of social entrepreneur
ship. Singal hopes to develop the
necessary infrastructure to enable
students to start their own social en-

trepreneurship projects on campus.
According to Ogiemwanye, the
ASSU has struggled in past years
with the translation of "the rhetoric
of tolerance into results." With this
in mind, Cruz and Macgregor-Den
nis established the community
board led by Mondragon and made
up of leaders from various commu
nities across campus.
The community board will in
clude Vivian Wong 'l2, last year's
chair of disabilities; Justin Lam,
head of the Asian-American Stu
dents' Association (AASA);
Chiney Ogwumike 'l4, forward on
the women's varsity basketball
team; and others.
"The ASSU has great ideas, but

they're not necessarily fit to the
communities that they're targeted
at... which creates a disconnect,"
Ogiemwanye said. "But if you have
a group of people who already have
an understanding of the needs of the
community, then you don't have to
worry so much."
"We're going to take what
they're doing to the next level,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "It's about
taking specific initiatives and scal
ing them up to the entire campus."
According to director of design
thinking Nishant Jacob 'l3, the goal
of next year's meetings is to move
away from "the old dogmatic struc
ture" where energy often "dies" to a
more collaborative "design think
ing" style. To that effect, Jacob and
Macgregor-Dennis encouraged
cabinet members to "connect on a
human level" by interviewing each
other about their goals and visions
at last Saturday's meeting. They
then brainstormed ways to keep
next year's meetings efficient, ener
getic and positive.
"Student government tends to
spend an enormous amount of time
in meetings, choosing sides and try
ing to defend those sides," Jacob
said. "The most effective way to
break through that is to replace that
binary dialogue with collaborative
brainstorm sessions."
"You reserve judgment, you en
courage wild ideas, you keep the en
ergy up," he added.
