## Bowlsby talks bowl task force A.D. explains aftermath of Fiesta Bowl improprieties 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In an interview with The Daily, Stanford Ath
letic Director Bob Bowlsby explained his role
on the task force appointed by the Bowl Cham
pionship Series (BCS), which was charged with
investigating the Fiesta Bowl's improprieties
and misuse of bowl funds. Some groups, howev
er, are voicing criticism in response to the task
force and its recommendations.
The bowl fired its CEO, John Junker, and
other employees in March upon release of a
"scathing" internal review, which detailed a
bevy of financial improprieties and misuse of
bowl funds. Most prominently, the investigation
uncovered an "apparent scheme" to reimburse
employees for at least $46,539 for contributions
to political campaigns, as well as an attempt to
conceal the reimbursements from the bowl's
board of directors (as a nonprofit, the Fiesta
Bowl is barred by state campaign finance laws
from making political donations). Other signifi
cant violations included a $33,000 birthday
party for Junker and a $1,200 trip to a Phoenix
strip club.

In its report published in late May, the task
force recommended a $1 million fine as well as
other sanctions, but said that the Fiesta Bowl
should remain a member of the BCS. Bowlsby
was one of seven members on the task force,
which was chaired by Graham Spanier, presi
dent of Pennsylvania State University. He
joined the panel at the request of Larry Scott,
commissioner of the Pac-10 Confer
ence.
Bowlsby noted that the task force
carried out four conference calls and
one in-person meeting with the Fiesta
Bowl's directors in order to determine
a punishment for missteps. He said the
task force did not meet with Junker.
He also described the task force's
decision-making process on the
bowl's final penalties.
"It was a collaborative process
with a lot of people on the board,"
Bowlsby said. "We had a couple of
BCS lawyers that were involved with
advising us as well.The BCS executive
director was involved in the delibera
tions."
"It was a process by which we iden
tified the strengths and weaknesses of
the organization and tried to enhance
the strengths and minimize the weak
nesses," he added.
Bowlsby also responded to allega
tions of a conflict of interest in his role
on the task force. According to Playoff
PAC, an anti-BCS political action
committee, the Fiesta Bowl annually
hosts and pays for the "Fiesta Frolic,"
a three-day golf and spa outing in Ari
zona for coaches, athletic department
administrators and their spouses.
Documents provided to The Daily by
Playoff PAC show that Bowlsby at
tended at least two Fiesta Frolics, one
in 2008 and one in 2001, when he was
the director of athletics at the Univer
sity of lowa.
"I would say that anyone who sug
gested that, one, doesn't know me very
well and, two, puts a very low price on
my integrity," Bowlsby said of the pos
sibility of a conflict of interest.
Chad Pehrson, a co-founder of
Playoff PAC, explained his concern
about the conflict-of-interest allega
tions.
"If someone's on a task force that's
charged with investigating or regulat
ing behavior, we would like those peo
ple to be independent," he said.
"When someone has repeatedly ac
cepted benefits from the objects of
their investigation, that calls into ques
tion their independence.
"I think it's a bigger issue for uni
versities," he added. "If I were presi
dent of a university, I would not allow
my employees [and] my administra
tors to accept benefits from bowl
games, because I think it might cloud
their judgment as to what's the best

course for the university's athletic pro
grams."
Pehrson suggested that college
football could follow the lead of other
professions in establishing a published
set of guidelines that state which ben
efits are acceptable and which ones
are sufficient to pose a conflict of in
terest.
"I think that would be a road they
should go down, but they don't cur
rently," he said. "They don't publish
that information. They don't say, 'You
can accept a golf game, but you can't
accept a first-class airplane ticket.'"
Bowlsby and Pehrson also had dif
fering views on the penalties levied on
the Fiesta Bowl, specifically the $1 mil
lion fine, which the task force recom
mended come in the form of contribu
tions to Arizona charities. Bowlsby
said this fine would come out of the Fi
esta Bowl's reserves.
Playoff PAC, on the other hand,
has argued that the payments do not
really constitute a penalty, since the
bowl is obligated to pay those funds
to charity anyway. In a statement pro
vided by Pehrson, Playoff PAC cites
the bowl's articles of incorporation,
which state that the bowl must use all
of its excess funds for "charitable pur
poses."
Other reforms listed in the task
force report include the removal of Fi
esta Bowl board members implicated
in "inappropriate conduct," the re
cruitment of at least two bowl board
members from the collegiate commu
nity, the introduction of an independ
ent audit and the hiring of an execu
tive director with "the highest ethical
standards." The report also urged an
nual meetings between representa
tives of the Fiesta Bowl and the BCS.

Director
In an interview with The Daily, Stanford Ath
letic Director Bob Bowlsby explained his role
on the task force appointed by the Bowl Cham
pionship Series (BCS), which was charged with
investigating the Fiesta Bowl's improprieties
and misuse of bowl funds. Some groups, howev
er, are voicing criticism in response to the task
force and its recommendations.
The bowl fired its CEO, John Junker, and
other employees in March upon release of a
"scathing" internal review, which detailed a
bevy of financial improprieties and misuse of
bowl funds. Most prominently, the investigation
uncovered an "apparent scheme" to reimburse
employees for at least $46,539 for contributions
to political campaigns, as well as an attempt to
conceal the reimbursements from the bowl's
board of directors (as a nonprofit, the Fiesta
Bowl is barred by state campaign finance laws
from making political donations). Other signifi
cant violations included a $33,000 birthday
party for Junker and a $1,200 trip to a Phoenix
strip club.

In its report published in late May, the task
force recommended a $1 million fine as well as
other sanctions, but said that the Fiesta Bowl
should remain a member of the BCS. Bowlsby
was one of seven members on the task force,
which was chaired by Graham Spanier, presi
dent of Pennsylvania State University. He
joined the panel at the request of Larry Scott,
commissioner of the Pac-10 Confer
ence.
Bowlsby noted that the task force
carried out four conference calls and
one in-person meeting with the Fiesta
Bowl's directors in order to determine
a punishment for missteps. He said the
task force did not meet with Junker.
He also described the task force's
decision-making process on the
bowl's final penalties.
"It was a collaborative process
with a lot of people on the board,"
Bowlsby said. "We had a couple of
BCS lawyers that were involved with
advising us as well.The BCS executive
director was involved in the delibera
tions."
"It was a process by which we iden
tified the strengths and weaknesses of
the organization and tried to enhance
the strengths and minimize the weak
nesses," he added.
Bowlsby also responded to allega
tions of a conflict of interest in his role
on the task force. According to Playoff
PAC, an anti-BCS political action
committee, the Fiesta Bowl annually
hosts and pays for the "Fiesta Frolic,"
a three-day golf and spa outing in Ari
zona for coaches, athletic department
administrators and their spouses.
Documents provided to The Daily by
Playoff PAC show that Bowlsby at
tended at least two Fiesta Frolics, one
in 2008 and one in 2001, when he was
the director of athletics at the Univer
sity of lowa.
"I would say that anyone who sug
gested that, one, doesn't know me very
well and, two, puts a very low price on
my integrity," Bowlsby said of the pos
sibility of a conflict of interest.
Chad Pehrson, a co-founder of
Playoff PAC, explained his concern
about the conflict-of-interest allega
tions.
"If someone's on a task force that's
charged with investigating or regulat
ing behavior, we would like those peo
ple to be independent," he said.
"When someone has repeatedly ac
cepted benefits from the objects of
their investigation, that calls into ques
tion their independence.
"I think it's a bigger issue for uni
versities," he added. "If I were presi
dent of a university, I would not allow
my employees [and] my administra
tors to accept benefits from bowl
games, because I think it might cloud
their judgment as to what's the best

course for the university's athletic pro
grams."
Pehrson suggested that college
football could follow the lead of other
professions in establishing a published
set of guidelines that state which ben
efits are acceptable and which ones
are sufficient to pose a conflict of in
terest.
"I think that would be a road they
should go down, but they don't cur
rently," he said. "They don't publish
that information. They don't say, 'You
can accept a golf game, but you can't
accept a first-class airplane ticket.'"
