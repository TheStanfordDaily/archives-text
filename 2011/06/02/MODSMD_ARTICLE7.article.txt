## Bowlsby talks bowl task force A.D. explains aftermath of Fiesta Bowl improprieties 
### KABIR SAWHNEY DESK EDITOR 
In an interview with The Daily, Stanford Ath
letic Director Bob Bowlsby explained his role
on the task force appointed by the Bowl Cham
pionship Series (BCS), which was charged with
investigating the Fiesta Bowl's improprieties
and misuse of bowl funds. Some groups, howev
er, are voicing criticism in response to the task
force and its recommendations.
The bowl fired its CEO, John Junker, and
other employees in March upon release of a
"scathing" internal review, which detailed a
bevy of financial improprieties and misuse of
bowl funds. Most prominently, the investigation
uncovered an "apparent scheme" to reimburse
employees for at least $46,539 for contributions
to political campaigns, as well as an attempt to
conceal the reimbursements from the bowl's
board of directors (as a nonprofit, the Fiesta
Bowl is barred by state campaign finance laws
from making political donations). Other signifi
cant violations included a $33,000 birthday
party for Junker and a $1,200 trip to a Phoenix
strip club.

In its report published in late May, the task
force recommended a $1 million fine as well as
other sanctions, but said that the Fiesta Bowl
should remain a member of the BCS. Bowlsby
was one of seven members on the task force,
which was chaired by Graham Spanier, presi
dent of Pennsylvania State University. He
joined the panel at the request of Larry Scott,
