## University divvies funds to academic, administrative units 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The 2011-12 budget will allot dif
ferent shares of monies to the Uni
versity's academic, administrative
and auxiliary units. Among these
units, the School of Medicine is ex
pected to have the largest share of
consolidated expenses next year.
Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D.
'B2 formally presented his budget
plan at the May 26 meeting of the
Faculty Senate. The budget will be
submitted to the Board of Trustees
for approval on Wednesday, June 8.
According to Etchemendy, the
budget plan will likely remain in its
current state.
"I don't anticipate any changes
from the proposal," he wrote in an
email to The Daily.
In drafting the budget,
Etchemendy said one key objective
was to "maintain support for core
academic activities" such as under
graduate financial aid and graduate
aid. He noted that other goals were
to "fund the highest priority initia
tives in the schools and other units"
and to "avoid undoing the budget
reductions made in the past few
years."
A final consideration was the po
tential decrease in sponsored re
search funding in 2012, with the dis
continuation of federal grants from
the American Recovery and Rein
vestment Act (ARRA).
"There has been no sponsored
research shortfall yet,"
Etchemendy said. "In fact we have
been seeing unexpectedly high re
search levels in the last two years.
"But the outlook for sponsored
research in the coming years is a sig
nificant concern, and so we have
been cautious to maintain a reserve
that will cushion the effects of a flat
federal research budget over the
next several years," he added.
The consolidated expenses are
divided among those for Stanford's
academic units including its
seven schools and those for ad
ministrative and auxiliary units.
Academic units
The University's academic units
are projected to have $3162.4 mil
lion in consolidated expenses next

year, with each school and academ
ic body spending different totals.
The School of Medicine is set to
receive 44 percent of consolidated
expenses for the University's aca
demic units in 2011-12 the high
est amount among the University's
academic units.
According to the budget plan,
the School of Medicine's "highest
priorities are to support current fac
ulty by raising gifts for professor
ships and research support for jun
ior faculty, diversifying research
funding sources, addressing critical
research needs and optimizing re
search space utilization."
The school expects an overall
surplus of $16.9 million next year,
compared to this year's $38.1 mil
lion surplus.
The SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory is slated to get 11 per
cent of consolidated expenses.
SLAC, which obtains 97 percent of
its funding from the Department of
Energy, has not received its 2011
funding from the federal govern
ment. Based on congressional con
tinuing resolutions, the laboratory is
projected to work with $350 million,
the amount it was designated in
2010.
The School of Humanities & Sci
ences (H&S) is projected to receive
12 percent of academic unit expen
ditures. According to the budget
plan, H&S will likely have revenues
of $408.6 million and expenses of
$393.1 million next year, with a sur
plus of $15.5 million.
The School of Engineering will
get 10 percent of consolidated ex
penditures and projects an $8.4 mil
lion surplus for 2011-12. Sponsored
research is expected to constitute 44
percent of the engineering school's
consolidated budget.

The Dean of Research will have
a 6-percent share of consolidated
expenses in its coffers. It has a
planned deficit of $1.5 million for
2011-12, stemming from $190.5 mil
lion in revenues, $196.1 million in
expenses and $4.2 million in net
transfers.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) is anticipated to have a
5-percent share of expenses. Ac
cording to the budget plan, the next
year's "consolidated budget is bet

ter than break-even at approxi
mately $6.1 million," after account
ing for costs associated with transi
tioning to the new Knight Manage
ment Center.
Stanford Libraries is allotted 3
percent of the consolidated budget
for academic units. This represents a
4-percent growth over Stanford Li
braries' budget this year.

The Law School and School of
Earth Sciences will both have 2-per
cent shares of total consolidated ex
penses for academic units. Stanford
Law School anticipates a "minimal
consolidated budget surplus of
$92,000" next year, while the School
of Earth Sciences expects a
$700,000 deficit.

The School of Education will see
a projected 1-percent share of con
solidated expenses and "a $1.3 mil
lion consolidated deficit in 2011-
12," according to the budget plan.
The remaining expenses, which
total 3 percent, will go to the
Hoover Institution, the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion and the Vice Provost for Grad
uate Education.
Administrative and auxiliary units
According to the budget plan,

consolidated expenses for adminis
trative and auxiliary units are pro
jected to total $1,066 million in the
2011-12, with the largest share going
to Land, Buildings and Real Estate
(LB RE).

LBRE will have a $2lB million
consolidated budget next year,
which represents a $15.2 million
spike from the budget projection
for the current year. This will make
up 20 percent of total administra
tive and auxiliary expenses.
Claiming 18 percent of these ex
penditures, Business Affairs and
Information Technology is close
behind LBRE with projected rev
enues and transfers of $184.2 mil
lion and expenses of $187.3 million.
The unit will use money from re
serves to cover the gap between
revenues and expenditures.
Residential and Dining Enter
prises (R&DE) makes up 15 per
cent of consolidated expenses for
administrative and auxiliary bodies
and is projected have a break-even
budget in 2011-12. R&DE expects
to use $24 million in new debt to
carry out projects to alleviate an ex
isting maintenance backlog, bring
ing the unit's total debt service ex
pense to $44 million next year.

According to the budget plan,
the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission (UGA), the Financial Aid
Office (FAO) and Visitor Informa
tion Services will launch "a strate
gic outreach plan that will allow
them to ramp up a presence world
wide," UGA and FAO are set to re
ceive 14 percent of consolidated ex
penses.

The department of Athletics, PE
and Recreation (DAPER) will
have a 9-percent share of expens
es, with anticipated revenues and
expenses both ringing in at a price
tag of $19.8 million in 2011-12. In
spite of this break-even state, Ath
letics has faced and may still face
continued budget challenges.
"The additional 15-percent de
cline in endowment payouts for
2010-11 combined with continued
increases in tuition created finan
cial aid expenses that exceeded
the endowment payouts," the
budget reads. "Despite a modest
rebound in the endowment, this
problem will continue in 2011-12,
and the department projects
needing to transfer approximately
$2.1 million from operating rev
enues to balance the financial aid
budget."
Among the remaining units,
the Office of Development is ex
pected to receive 7 percent of con
solidated expenses, the Office of
the President and Provost will re
ceive 6 percent and the Office of
Student Affairs will receive 5 per
cent. The remaining 6 percent of
expenses goes to the Stanford
Management Company, the Office
of the General Counsel and the
Office of Public Affairs.
