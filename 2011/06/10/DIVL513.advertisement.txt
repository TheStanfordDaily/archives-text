The Taube Center for Jewish Studies is the key address on campus for all aspects of Jewish
academic study - from ancient Judaism, to the study of contemporary Israel, or Hebrew,
or Yiddish, or Ladino. Affiliated with the Taube Center are nearly two dozen faculty across
seven departments. Hundreds of students take classes sponsored by the Center, and the
Taube Center has connected with it, one of the largest and most prominent programs in
graduate studies in Jewish topics in North America.
In addition, the Center sponsors many public events - lectures by leading writers, artists
and intellectuals. Some of these are in small, intimate forums, others are large lectures.
The Center sponsors a book series at Stanford University Press, and one of the most distin
guished of all journals in the field, Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, and Society.
