Stanford Continuing Studies Presents
Sticky Time : Crowded Fire Theater Workshop Reading
Please join us for a script-in-hand workshop of a new play
by Marilee Talkington. Sticky Time is a rich, experimental,
cross-disciplinary theatrical look at the birth, life, and
possible death of time. When twins are created from a
Big Bang, they seek to discover their origins before being
pulled back into the black hole of "un-time."
Through the use of fugue-like language and beautiful
unconventional movement, we witness the twins
concurrently living in the present, past, and future, each
attached to Time's wild fractured narrative.
Participating actors —all Crowded Fire Resident
Artists —will include Michele Leavy, Rami Margron,
Lawrence Radecker, and Mollena Williams.
Tuesday, June 14 - 7:30 pm
Pigott Hall (Building 260), Room 113
FREE; Open to public
