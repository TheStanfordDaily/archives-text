## Dalai Lama talks China, democracy with students 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fang Zheng was 22 years old
when a Chinese tank ran over his
legs. It was 1989, and he was one of
tens of thousands of protesters in
Tiananmen Square rallying against
the government's repressive policies.
On Thursday afternoon, in a
quiet, shady courtyard of the Stan
ford Park Hotel in Menlo Park,
Zheng rolled his wheelchair up to a
microphone to ask Tenzin Gyatso,
the 14th Dalai Lama, what the
prospects of democracy are in the
country where Zheng lived for four
decades. Leaning forward in a red
and gold chair, the Dalai Lama lis
tened closely, furrowed his brow and
then replied: "I myself hope to return
to Beijing. But right now I cannot."
In a rare private event during his
four days in the Bay Area, the 75-
year-old leader of Tibet met with
Chinese and Tibetan students and
scholars after giving two public lec
tures at Stanford the same day. For
70 minutes he spoke on the current
state of China, Tibet and India, inter
twining the lessons of human com

passion and religious harmony that
won him the Nobel Peace Prize in
1989 and made him one of the most
recognizable figures in the world.
Greeting a group of Chinese col
lege students from Stanford and UC-
Berkeley in the front row with a tra
ditional Chinese "ni hao" greeting,
the Dalai Lama immediately
launched into an assessment of
China's current political and social
state.
"After 60 years, there is no civil
war or external threat to China," he
said. "But they have kept certain
habits from the time when there was
threat: suppression, censorship and
too much control."
Chinese censorship, particularly
on the Web, has clouded the coun
try's reputation this year, especially
after Internet giant Google tem
porarily yanked its search engine
from China-based servers in March,
when it was found that Chinese
hackers had attacked Google and
other U.S. technology companies.
The Chinese media is also heavily
censored by the government.
