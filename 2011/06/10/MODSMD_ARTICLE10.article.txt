## Dalai Lama talks China, democracy with students 
### DEVIN BANERJEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Fang Zheng was 22 years old
when a Chinese tank ran over his
legs. It was 1989, and he was one of
tens of thousands of protesters in
Tiananmen Square rallying against
the government's repressive policies.
On Thursday afternoon, in a
quiet, shady courtyard of the Stan
ford Park Hotel in Menlo Park,
Zheng rolled his wheelchair up to a
microphone to ask Tenzin Gyatso,
the 14th Dalai Lama, what the
prospects of democracy are in the
country where Zheng lived for four
decades. Leaning forward in a red
and gold chair, the Dalai Lama lis
tened closely, furrowed his brow and
then replied: "I myself hope to return
to Beijing. But right now I cannot."
In a rare private event during his
four days in the Bay Area, the 75-
year-old leader of Tibet met with
Chinese and Tibetan students and
scholars after giving two public lec
tures at Stanford the same day. For
70 minutes he spoke on the current
state of China, Tibet and India, inter
twining the lessons of human com

passion and religious harmony that
won him the Nobel Peace Prize in
1989 and made him one of the most
recognizable figures in the world.
Greeting a group of Chinese col
lege students from Stanford and UC-
Berkeley in the front row with a tra
ditional Chinese "ni hao" greeting,
the Dalai Lama immediately
launched into an assessment of
China's current political and social
state.
"After 60 years, there is no civil
war or external threat to China," he
said. "But they have kept certain
habits from the time when there was
threat: suppression, censorship and
too much control."
Chinese censorship, particularly
on the Web, has clouded the coun
try's reputation this year, especially
after Internet giant Google tem
porarily yanked its search engine
from China-based servers in March,
when it was found that Chinese
hackers had attacked Google and
other U.S. technology companies.
The Chinese media is also heavily
censored by the government.

Fang Zheng, 44, was run over by a Chinese tank in 1989
and held captive for three years. On their first meeting, he
asked the leader about prospects of democracy in China.
"One point three billion people
have the right to know the reality
and to judge for themselves what's
right and what's wrong," the Dalai
Lama said. "Therefore the censor
ship is immoral. It's self-destruc
tive."
Censorship is just one part of the
trust deficit that China has created,
the Dalai Lama said. He compared
China to India, saying both suffer
from heavy corruption but India is
trusted by the international commu
nity because its democratic values
highlight individual freedom while
China's domestic policies encour
age suppression.

"Individual creativity of diverse
people is very necessary," he said.
"Look at India. For the last 60 years,
there has been accountability be
cause of democracy, rule of law and
freedom of information. And there
is secularism in the government
which does not mean rejection of re
ligion, but means respect for all reli
gions."
China's trust deficit is a hin
drance to talks between Tibet and
the Chinese government over
Tibet's autonomy. The Dalai Lama
called the tension "man-made" and
said it can "easily be solved" if the
Chinese government understood
that Tibet is not seeking separation
or independence, but instead
"meaningful autonomy" of gover
nance.

"Sooner or later we have to talk
to the Chinese government," the

Dalai Lama said. "It has to be un
derstood that we are not seeking
separation. We are not seeking inde
pendence. We are seeking meaning
ful autonomy."
Independence would refer to a
Tibet that governs itself at every
level without China's hand, while
autonomy would refer to a Tibet
that governs its internal affairs but
gives international and military
decision-making power to China.
Speaking to the group of Chi
nese students in attendance, the
Dalai Lama said, "You are the
people who will create this centu
ry. Please think more wisely." He
described groups of Chinese stu
dents who protest his visits to the
U.S. with "too much emotion, too
much anger."
"They never listen to my expla
nation," he said. "Good thing I sit

at a big table, otherwise they
would reach over and ..." He
made swinging motions with his
fists.

At 75 years old, the Dalai Lama
said he is looking toward "com
plete retirement." He now devotes
himself to two main commitments:
promoting human values through
secular paths and promoting reli
gious harmony.
"The future belongs to people,
not necessarily governments," he
said. "Basically all people want a
happy life. Everyone must have a
right to pursue that goal."
The private meeting was organ
ized by Tenzin Seldon 'l2, who made
news earlier this year when it was
found that her private Google e
mail account was hacked by some
one with a Chinese IP address. Sel
don, who was born and raised in

Tibet but fled to India with her par
ents, is a regional coordinator of the
New York-based nonprofit Stu
dents for a Free Tibet. She worked
for one of the Dalai Lama's non
profit organizations in India over
the summer, where she had the op
portunity to meet the Dalai Lama
and ask him to speak with Chinese
and Tibetan students on his visit to
the Bay Area.
"What struck me the most was
how knowledgeable His Holiness
was about the intricacies of China,"
she said after the event. "It's quite
an undertaking for a spiritual per
son to be on the level where he can
talk about political and economic
implications. This relates directly to
what I went through."
