## Police report shots at Lag parking lot 
### AN LE NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
According to the Stanford University De
partment of Public Safety (SUDPS), multiple
shots were fired in the Lagunita parking lot at
7:17 p.m. on the evening of Saturday, May 14.
The authorities have since detained and ques
tioned possible suspects and reported that no
one was injured.
The Stanford police alerted students via
email and text a little after 8 p.m., stating that
one "outstanding suspect" is a black male, aged
18 to 20, "with a slender build and long dread
locks." The suspect may have been armed with
a silver handgun.
In a subsequent announcement to the cam
pus, the Stanford police said, "it is unknown if
any of the gunshots were directed at an individ
ual." Witnesses saw an individual firing several
gunshots into the parking lot asphalt before
fleeing the scene in a vehicle, said to be a white
Lexus.
An officer responding to the incident identi
fied and pursued the vehicle in question. Dur
ing the police chase, the vehicle's two passen
gers exited and made a run for the wooded area
bordered by Campus Drive, Quarry Road,
Palm Drive and El Camino Real. Police later
brought two individuals found in that vicinity
into custody for questioning.
"The suspects were detained, questioned,
then released," said Stanford police sergeant
Chris Cohendet. The authorities are currently
trying to locate the firearm, he added.
A second vehicle involved in the incident is
described as an older car with two scissor doors
and large rims. The car is said to be burnt or
ange, brown or gold in color. According to Co
hendet, that vehicle's driver is still at large, and
the police are still trying to follow up on this
lead.
"The driver of the second vehicle was ob
served waving a handgun, possibly silver in
color, out of the open window on the driver's
side of the vehicle as he left the scene on Santa
Teresa Street," read an alert by the Stanford
police. "One witness described the driver wav
ing the handgun as a black male wearing a base
ball cap with a red brim."
At present, the investigation is still ongoing,
and a motivation for the incident has not yet
been determined.
"We're still actively investigating it," Cohen
det said.
He noted that "there were a couple of events
on campus" happening around the time of the
shooting, one of which was Blackfest, a concert
that took place at Roble Field, across the street
from the Lagunita parking lot.
"I don't know if this was associated with that
event, but the shooting happened right after,"
Cohendet said.
"It is unclear whether the apprehended sus
pects have any University affiliation," said Uni
versity spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. "At the mo
ment, it appears that they don't."
While suspects have been detained and
questioned, the investigation is still an open
case and more information will be available in
the days to come.
"We don't believe there is any threat or dan
ger to the campus," Lapin said.
"I think that it is an isolated incident," Co
hendet concurred.
"It is concerning when someone is carrying
a firearm on campus," he said. "But I don't
think the motive of this was to hurt anyone."
