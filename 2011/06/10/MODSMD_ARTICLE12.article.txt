## ROCK ON, RICE 
### LAUREN WILSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The last two weeks have been good to Condoleezza
Rice. On the political front, there was Osama bin
Laden. Last week, after President Obama an
nounced the death of the former al-Qaeda leader,
Rice proudly stepped back into the media spot
light, crediting the Bush administration her administration
for laying the groundwork for bin Laden's death.
Then there's the personal legacy. Two weeks ago, Rice
made a rare cameo appearance on NBC's comedy series "30
Rock," poking fun at herself as the spurned lover of high-pow
ered GE executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin).
Rice's torrid love affair with Jack surfaced in the season
one episode "The Break Up" when Jack coyly mentioned his
relationship with a "high-ranking African American member
of the Bush administration." But with barely a vague sugges
tion of phone sex and a handsome attache, the relationship
ended thanks to Jack's jealous suspicions of Condi's flirty rela
tionship with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
The real-life Rice described how she was slightly caught
off-guard to hear about her secret sitcom lover.
"Yeah I was a little surprised," Rice said. "I thought it was
a kind of funny, funny storyline."
Rice, who admits to being an infrequent viewer of "30
Rock," reassured us that Jack had nothing to wony about.
"He didn't have to worry about that, ok?" she laughed.
In its five seasons, "30 Rock" has carved a niche for itself in
the primetime market with its eccentric antics and wacky sto
rylines (check Liz Lemon's recent comeuppance by a plastic
bag). It has also taken its fair share of playful jabs at the Bush
administration at one point, Jack leaves GE to go work for
the federal government only to discover the White House in
total shambles, replete with leaky ceilings and nary a working
pen in sight.
So a silly, fabricated romance between the two powerful
figures seemed like a natural extension of the show's charac
teristic zaniness. Condi isn't Jack Donaghy's only high-profile
lover the long list also includes Martha Stewart and show
er-buddy Greta Van Susteren.
The former Secretary of State first heard about her alleged
paramour through an old co-worker.
"She had seen this storyline develop about Alec Baldwin
and me and she said 'Gee wouldn't it be fun if you did a cameo
about it'," Rice said. "I said sure, sure, sure and somebody who
represents me got in touch with them."
Rice frequently fields offers for these kinds of appearances,
including a chance to compete on "Dancing with the Stars"
which she refused.
"That's maximum embarrassment to be on 'Dancing with
the Stars,' but [3O Rock] kind of appealed to me because it's
kind of a quirky show," she said. "And I like Alec Baldwin and
I love Tina Fey."
Neither party initially put much effort into pursuing the ap
pearance, so the idea languished for a year.
"Then out of the blue, they came back and said, 'Gee we'd
really like to do it next week or something'," Rice said. "It was
one of those things where it was really very close in time,"
To prepare. Rice ran lines with one of her co-workers, a for
mer child actress, before jetting off to New York the week of
March 16 to film.The appearance aired in the April 28 episode
"Everything Sunny AH the Time."
In the episode, Jack's current wife Avery Jessup (Elizabeth
Banks) is detained in North Korea by a pop culture-obsessed,
megalomaniacal Kim Jong-Il (Margaret Cho). Desperate to
bring Avery home, Jack has no choice but to come groveling to
his bitter ex-girlfriend for help. But before Condi
agrees to help him, she challenges Jack to a piano/flute-off. A
professional flutist came in to teach Baldwin how to hold the
instrument properly. Rice, on the other hand, is a famously ac
complished pianist and picked out the pieces played on the
show herself Condi eventually trumps Jack on the third and
final song, an excerpt of Mozart's D Minor Concerto.
"That one would be impossible for the flute to play," Rice
said. "I wasn't trying to be fair. I was trying to get revenge,
right?"
During the scene, Jack apologizes for breaking up with
Condi via text message ("Me + U =:(").
"Well I thought, my goodness, how could you do that and I
mean to go out with Karl Rove on Valentine's Day? My good
ness," Rice joked.
Despite his character's conservative leanings, Alec Bald
win is notorious for his liberal activism, most famously lam
pooned in "Team America: World Police" as the head of Hol
lywood's activist, liberal crowd. However, the two set aside
their political differences during the taping.
"He made me feel very relaxed because I [hadn't] had time
to memorize lines," Rice said. "And he said/Nobody remem
bers lines. We just make it up.' He was really great."
As for "30 Rock's" own lampooning of the Bush adminis
tration, Rice has no beef.
"Everybody pokes fun at each other," Rice said. "That's the
nice thing about American politics. If you can't laugh together
then you've lost something really important."
"It's nice to see professors not taking themselves too seri-

ously," said Anissa Chitour 'l3. "It did
make me laugh, but it didn't change
my opinion of her as a politician or
professor."
However, Rice has no plans to
continue her acting career nor does
she think there's a future for Jack and
Condi.
"No I think they're done. Big
split's over," she said.

And although the Osama bin
Laden assassination eclipsed her ap
pearance the following week, Rice
certainly is not disappointed.
"It's a real victory for American
patience and persistence," Rice said.
"It took us almost 10 years, but it
shows you can't escape America's
long reach. I think this is a victory
across presidents and I think that's a
good thing."
"I think Jack would have liked it,"
she added.
