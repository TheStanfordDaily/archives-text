						DREAM DEFERRED
## 
### ASHLEY MENZIES 
Fermfn Mendoza'll comes from
what he calls a "mixed-status
family." His youngest brother
was born in the United States
and is a citizen by birth. His
older sister, a teacher who recently mar
ried, is a permanent resident. Mean
while, Mendoza, his parents and his
other brother, a sophomore in college,
are not legal residents.
The U.S. Senate's blockage of the
DREAM Act late last year keeps people
like Mendoza in legal limbo. The legisla
tion would have provided a path to citi
zenship for young, undocumented immi
grants who were brought to the United
States as children. Its failure leaves Men
doza, a public policy major, looking
ahead to future activism, graduation and
where he goes from there.
Mendoza was born in Mexico and
came to the United States with his fami
ly when he was 4 ye ars old, going on to at
tend middle and high school in Texas. His
parents had come to the U.S. on a three
month tourist visa and indefinitely ex
tended their stay. They moved for better
job security and to help their children
pursue better educations, they empha
sized to their son.
Mendoza's parents told him at an
early age that he wasn't an American cit
izen, and he was told never to speak
about his immigration status because he
"did not have papers." Nonetheless,
Mendoza grew up, went to school and
got involved in extracurricular activities
much like any other American with
his legal status in what felt like the distant
background.
"I didn't feel different at all growing
up," Mendoza said. "I had the same ac
cess to public education in the United
States. My immigrant identity only
pushed me to do better in classes."
Mendoza considers himself lucky. His
father has worked roofing houses for the
past 16 years, and his mother recently
changed jobs from dry cleaning to house
cleaning. They made sure Mendoza and
his siblings never worried about finances
and that their primary focus was school
work.
Mendoza did not want to work a
manual-labor job like his parents, which
motivated him further to excel in the
classroom.
"Even when I started attaining a level
of education that was higher than theirs,
I still convinced myself that what I was
doing was not as hard as what they were
doing," he said about his parents.
Mendoza took his schoolwork seri
ously and, in middle school, was encour
aged to apply to a program for gifted stu
dents. The application for the program
required documentation of his parents'
income, which, as unauthorized immi

grants, they had difficulty providing. His
counselors and other administrators at
the school were supportive and helped
him work around these obstacles, he
said. He began to feel more comfortable
with his immigration status.
A few years after gaining support
from his school, Mendoza felt comfort
able opening up to his peers. In 10th
grade, several of his projects in school fo
cused on immigration and the DREAM
Act. Because his school was 98 percent
Latino, many people were familiar and
concerned with immigration issues.
"I didn't see any reason to hide it,"
said Mendoza. "I was protected by edu
cators at my school."
Refining a World view
For Mendoza, the transition to Stan
ford was difficult because he was in a rad
ically different environment. There were
fewer Latino students, and he found peo
ple here less focused on immigration is
sues. Insecurities about his immigration
status sprung up again. Meanwhile, he
wrestled with being gay. He felt different
than other Stanford students and hid
those parts of his identity from his peers
during his freshman year.
But after a fellow student made jokes
about undocumented immigrants and
pointed out that Mendoza couldn't vote,
Mendoza felt it was time to assert him
self against what he felt were ignorant
views on immigration at Stanford and
nationwide. He tried to be more honest
about his background with himself and
others.
"I struggled with thinking of myself

as a person," Mendoza said. "What does
it mean to be human? People are calling
me illegal. I don't have any rights."
His sophomore year, he joined the
Stanford Immigrants Rights Project,
where the DREAM Act became the
group's focus as it facilitated President
Hennessy's public support of the legisla
tion. His junior year, he collaborated
with the group to plan Immigration
Week, which featured a series of immi
grant-rights demonstrations.
Last summer, Mendoza won a Haas
Center for Public Service fellowship to
work at Educators for Fair Considera
tion, which works to advance the educa
tions of low-income (and often undocu
mented) immigrant students. When his
fellowship ended, Mendoza was ready to
enter his senior year and prepared to
fight for the DREAM Act's passage.
After watching the House vote in favor
of the bill this fall, he was encouraged.
"It was definitely something new,"
Mendoza said. "The DREAM Act had
never passed in any chamber of Con
gress. It was a great symbol of support for
undocumented students at the govern
ment level."
But watching the Senate block the
bill soon afterward, he realized it was not
going to pass.
"I was sitting with my sister and I al
most cried," Mendoza said. "But I had to
hold it back."
Although Mendoza was disappoint
ed, he said the vote was re-energizing
and that he and other proponents of the
