# BEYOND BANDURA'S BOBOS

### JENNY THAI STAFF WRITER 
With twinkling eyes and a
gently wrinkled face in a
perpetual half-smile, Al
bert Bandura looks
every inch the quintes
sential kindly grandfather, from the
muted burgundy sweater to the soft lull of
his voice.
Bandura, a man of many talents, has
had a long and illustrious academic career
spanning over six decades. The David
Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social
Science in Psychology, Bandura has con
tributed immensely to the field of social
psychology, and is the father behind the
theory of self-efficacy and social learning
theory. Ranked as the most cited living
psychologist in the world, Bandura has
authored seven books to date and has
written over 180 articles.
Bandura was born and raised in
Mundare, a small hamlet in northern Al
berta, Canada with a population of ap
proximately 400 people, mostly immi
grants from Poland and Ukraine. His ele
mentary and secondary school years at
the only school in town were "very limited
in education resources," recalled Ban
dura. Usually, limited educational re
sources would be seen as a hindrance, but
Bandura looks back on his schooldays as
an opportunity for self-learning, a major
skill that is the center of his social learning
theory.
"We pilfered a teacher's trigonometry
book, so that we could study it ourselves,"
Bandura said. "The students had to take
charge of their own education."
Bandura's early resolve for scholastic
success was largely due to his upbringing
because his parents, though they received
no formal education, placed enormous
emphasis on academic development.
"My mother told me I could till the

land, play pool and drink myself to obliv
ion," Bandura said. "Or I could get an ed
ucation."
"Needless to say, I chose the latter,"
Bandura added with a lighthearted
chuckle.
Bandura's summers were spent pick
ing up carpentry, a skill set that would later
help pay for his college education. One
memorable summer after high school
graduation, Bandura ventured farther
north, where he worked at Whitehorse in
the Yukon filling in holes along the
Alaskan highway.
Bandura recalled the shock he re
ceived almost immediately upon his ar
rival.
"I pulled up to the base camp, and the
first thing I saw was an ambulance. I asked
someone if there had been an accident,
and someone told me,'No, that's our cook.
He drank all of the lemon extract for the
alcohol, so we have to take him in to get
his stomach pumped out.'"
The robust, quirky life of the workers
at Whitehorse was an exciting time for
Bandura, who saw the Yukon tundra as a
backdrop for "the blossoming of the psy
chopathology of everyday life."
"Booze was their main nutrient," Ban
dura said. "They were ordering large
quantities of sugar that they used to brew
up. This one morning they go up early [to
check] on the deepest alcoholic mash.
What they found there instead was half a
dozen drunken grizzly bears lumbering
around camp. Fortunately, they were a lit
tle too tipsy to actually be really danger
ous."
According to Bandura, fortuity a
factor generally avoided by psychologists,
who interpret such events as unpre
dictable plays a more important role in
shaping people's lives.
"In psych, we avoid fortuity," Bandura
said. "Fortuitous events are just nuisances
in our causal theories. I tried to bring some
science to bear on my fortuitous life, and

that's how I got into psych."
It was, in fact, fortuity that led B andura
to ultimately choose psychology as his
field of study for his bachelor's degree at
the University of British Columbia, a de
cision largely based on a chance en
counter with a course catalog.
"I had originally planned to major in
biology," Bandura said. "I was with pre
meds and engineers who had really early
schedules. I didn't have classes that early
those were at a time that I didn't know
even existed! So I had a lot of time. I no
ticed someone had left a course catalog.
While flipping through it, there was a
psych course that fit in with my schedule
that I decided to take."
Bandura was hooked on psych. Mak
ing use of his carpentry skills, he was able
to speed through his education, earning
his B.A. in three years and receiving his
M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of
lowa in three additional years. It was also
during his graduate student years, by an
other stroke of luck, that he met his wife,
whom he married in 1952.
"One morning, we were late to our golf
time, so they bumped us to a later time,"
Bandura said. "Two women were ahead
of us. They were slowing down, and we
were speeding up. I met my wife in the
sand trap. Had we been at the earlier time,
our lives would have never converged."
