# SAILING THE SEISMIC
## WAVES 
### KELLY VICARS 
Ten miles off the coast of
Costa Rica, Stanford re
searcher Jennifer Saltz
man stands on the ship
deck of the JOIDES Res
olution watching a gigantic steel drill
dig a 23-foot-wide hole in the floor of
the Pacific Ocean. The drill will
reach depths of up to 6,924 feet, or
about 1.3 miles, below the ocean
floor.
Its mission? To extract deep sam
ples of earth that could provide cru
cial insight into how subduction
zones places where one tectonic
plate of the Earth's crust is shoved
beneath another produces large
earthquakes, such as the recent mag
nitude-9 earthquake that ravaged
the coast of Japan. This type of re
search is the "smoking gun" in un
covering the environmental and cli
mate changes that have shaped the
planet's transformation throughout
history, from continental drift to the
extinction of the dinosaurs, Saltzman
said.
Deep-sea drilling has played an
integral part in shaping scientific un
derstanding of geologic phenomena,
such as major earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions and tsunamis. Aboard the
JOIDES Resolution, researchers are
drilling to depths previously un
heard of, where sediments could un
lock the secrets that may one day
allow scientists to foresee tectonic
disasters before they take place.
The ship, which is affectionately
called the JR, is the only American
ship in the world devoted solely to
scientific drilling. Its full acronym,
JOIDES, stands for Joint Oceano
graphic Institutions for Deep Earth
Sampling. "Resolution" honors the
HMS Resolution, a ship commanded
more than 200 years ago by Captain
James Cook, who explored the Pacif
ic and Antarctic Oceans. Today, the
JR roams waters across the globe,
from New Zealand to Tahiti to Cen
tral America to the Bering Sea.
Assisting in this endeavor are
over 100 individuals representing 10
nations on four continents: engi
neers, technicians, oilers, chemists,
researchers, curators, computer sci

ence and imaging specialists, a cap
tain, laundryman and professional
chefs. They work and live together
aboard the JR, where operations
continue 24 hours a day in the lab
stack an innovative research
space comprised of seven vertical
floors of laboratories.
Saltzman, director of outreach
education at the School of Earth Sci
ences and a lecturer in geological
and environmental sciences, was
part of this team, working a 12-hour
shift each day like every member of
the crew for the five-week research
voyage. She rose with the sunrise at 6
a.m. and worked until just before
sunset at 6 p.m.
She was hired from a nationwide
pool of applicants as the ship's edu
cation officer. Her duties included
sharing the JR's progress with stu
dents through blogs and live online
broadcasts as well as conducting re
search along with the rest of the
crew, spending days processing sedi
ment samples in the geochemistry
lab.
Saltzman jumped at the opportu
nity to participate in the five-week
research voyage when she was of
fered the position early this year.
Along with looking at the sedi
ment samples, she also got to share
her experience with student audi
ences around the country through
her blog posts on the JOIDES Reso
lution website. Her entries paint a
colorful portrait of life aboard the
JR and help explain the research in
ways that younger audiences can un
derstand. In one post, for example,
Saltzman described drilling into the
sediment on the seafloor as similar
to "pushing a giant straw through
layers of cake or Jello!"
Saltzman also found away to in
teract with her land-bound viewers
through live online broadcasts over
Skype. She spoke to many class
rooms in California and shared her
experiences as part of the research
team. A few weeks ago, Saltzman
talked to a sixth-grade earth science
class in Santa Clara, Calif. She took
them on a photo tour of the JR and
told them about some of the re
search methods the scientists use
some of which, like tasting the core

samples to test for differences in tex
ture, are strange and counterintu
itive.
Her broadcasts even made their
way back to the Stanford campus.
Kelly Marren 'l3, one of Saltzman's
advisees, tuned in from her laptop in
her dorm room.
"[I was] wowed by the highly sci
entific process of studying these core
samples, centimeter by centimeter,"
she said. "I can't believe all this is
taking place on a ship! I was very im
pressed by the dual existence of ship
life and research."
For Saltzman, teaching from
aboard the ship was an exciting as
pect of her job. She used her blog and
broadcasts to create a link between
the purely scientific aims of the re
search aboard the JR and the avid
minds of earth science students on
the Farm.
"I love teaching," she said. "I love
sharing what I know about the world
and helping people understand."
Though Saltzman's five-week
voyage ended when the JR returned
to port on April 13, the ship's re
search will continue when it em
barks on its next voyage, which is
planned to explore waters offshore
of Panama.
"We are FAR from understand
ing everything about how the Earth
system works, let alone how to de
sign all the tools and experiments to
get us there," Saltzman wrote in her
blog. "That is the exciting thing
about science. There is still so much
to learn and do. There is so much still
to discover."
