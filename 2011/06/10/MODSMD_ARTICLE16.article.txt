# SENIOR REFLECTIONS FROM DAILY EDITORS
## 
### 
AN LE NGUYEN

A wise Beatle once said, "Life is what
happens to you when you're busy
making other plans."
.
I concocted a lot of plans when I first ar
rived at Stanford. I distinctly remember own
ing three planners my freshman year because
having just one didn't suffice. I created color
coded checklists and spent hours agonizing
over internships and jobs. It's shameful, I
know.
Very few of these plans, however, panned
out as I previously intended and for this, I
am utterly thankful. During my time on the
Farm, three things in particular have sur
prised me for the better.
One, my major. As a high school senior, I
was 99 percent convinced that I would pursue
an English and biology double major because
they were subjects in which I excelled. I am
now leaving Stanford with degrees in eco
nomics and international relations, simply be
cause I love studying them.
Two, I never imagined that a single ex
tracurricular activity could take up 40 hours
of my life each week. And for that I
blame/thank Zach Zimmerman, who gave
me the opportunity to be news managing ed
itor at The Daily.
I spent more time in the newsroom than in
my own dorm this year and, quite frankly, I
couldn't have been happier. It has been a de
light to work with my fellow editors, writers
and photographers. The Daily has trans
formed from a hobby to a second home be
cause of these amazing individuals.
I am especially appreciative of Ivy
Nguyen, Kabir Sawhney, Tyler Brown, Cas
sandra Feliciano, Billy Gallagher, Josh Falk
and the newsies for contributing to Volume
239. Many thanks to Ellie Titus and Eric
Messinger for their continued guidance and
support.
Three, I am no longer afraid of life's sur
prises. Stanford has taught me to take the un
expected in stride and to relish new and excit
ing adventures.
Now, here comes the weepy part: I cannot
express enough gratitude for my wonderful
friends, roommates past and present, profes
sors and freshman dorm staff (shout out to
Donner 07-08) .And finally, my graduation re
flection would not be complete without a
word of thanks to my loving family, especially
my mom.
I'm perfectly content to allow things to just
"happen" so long as these remarkable indi
viduals continue to be a part of my uncharted
life journey.

MICHAEL LIU

Four years ago I was graduating high
school and not looking forward to it.
I didn't want to give up the familiar
relationships I spent years forming; I
wanted to hang onto that senior year
forever. Unsurprisingly, this desire to capture
a fleeting moment and tuck it away for pos
terity is actually quite related to what drew
me into photography. Photographs are in a
sense captured moments, photons from a past
time and place imprinted forever in a chemi
cal or digital medium.
In my time at The Daily as a photographer,
desk editor and managing editor I have been
given the privilege of sharing these moments
with the rest of the Stanford community
through photographs. Photojournalism is
tough as I learned the hard way: a politician's
emphatic gesture and a game winning touch
down all happen in an instant; one second of
hesitation can mean the difference between
the front page and the recycle bin. As I gained
experience I became quite skilled at catching
the smallest moments in a sea of activity.
However, eventually I found myself ob
sessed with capturing everything: "this event
was only happening now and if I didn't get a
photo the moment would be forever lost in
the depths of time," went my thinking. This
didn't apply just to photojournalism either
but followed me even on vacations. I became
so engrossed in my quest to preserve every
moment that I lost sight of the goal of vaca
tioning: to enjoy it.
I don't want to bash photography because
I absolutely love it, but it is important to re
member that life is not photography. Dynam
ic and ephemeral, life is actually quite the op
posite which is perhaps why photography can

be so powerful.
Nowadays, when I'm not on the job, I pur
posely avoid bringing a camera everywhere.
Sure this means I often miss shots I would
love to have captured, but it also means I am
able to live life in its full experience. Unlike
photographs you can't hold onto life's mo
ments forever. For me, embracing instead of
fighting that fact has been extremely liberat
ing.
Because of this realization I can now stand
here at another graduation, not dreading the
end of the past but looking forward to the
start of the future. Thank you to all my friends
on the Farm and at The Daily, past or present,
for helping me realize this.

DEVIN BANERJEE,
VOLUME 236
EDITOR IN CHIEF

I had a motto for Volume 236, which I
presented at the first staff recruiting ses
sion in the fall of 2009: "This is a profes
sional organization."
Not two weeks later, I made a makeshift
strap out of a freshman's backpack so that I
could play my saxophone during peak pro
duction hours. I blasted music from the editor
in chief office, annoying editors, writers and
outdoor passersby alike. To keep the staff
happy, I emptied my wallet on boba drinks,
candy and birthday cakes. And I gave more
post-midnight shoulder rubs than I can re
member, which might have been illegal, de
pending on how you look at it.
In earlier volumes, we took the distribu
tion golf cart on late-night campus joyrides.
We tried on a pair of women's pants that was
found in the office. We threw each other in the
fountain outside Old Union. We (jokingly)
tried to throw a freshman from the second
floor editorial office into the first-floor busi
ness office. We raced around the newsroom in
rolling chairs. We shot boba balls at each
other with straws. We wrestled. We danced on
tables. We slept in the office.
The Daily is a professional organization. It
does this community a service far greater
than it is given credit for. That service goes
above and beyond the inherent responsibility
that the organization has borne for 119 years:
to inform members of the Stanford communi
ty so that they may be active, responsible citi
zens.
But for the graduating seniors, leaving The
Stanford Daily means more than leaving an
important job. The experiences will, no doubt,
serve us well throughout our professional ca
reers. The work we have done has captured
and enhanced the vibrancy of this communi
ty. Yet these are not the first qualities that
come to mind as I reflect on my own four
years at The Daily. Because, even as I move to
the opposite coast to remain working in jour
nalism, I leave behind friends, a second fami
ly and a second home.

CRISTOPHER BAUTISTA

I started working at The Daily within
two weeks of arriving at Stanford as a
freshman. I had been editor in chief of
my school newspaper in high school
and I wanted to continue doing student
journalism in some capacity or another. I
found myself doing graphics. On nights when
I was waiting for graphics requests I'd sit
around in the office and read the opinions
columns. I enjoyed reading those columns,
and I found that I wanted to write a column
myself. I didn't know what about yet.
It wasn't until senior year that I found my
topic. By then, I had gone from a freshman
girl named Cristina and had transitioned to a
rising senior named Cristopher. I realized
that I, as a transgender person, had a unique
perspective I could impart to Daily readers. I
could write about my experiences as a trans
gender person as I took hormones, legally
changed my name and so on. There wasn't a
column that focused on transgender identi
ties in any university newspaper. I had some
thing to contribute.
I wrote my column, The Transitive Proper
ty, during Volume 238 and 239. Needless to
say, my experience writing my column was
perhaps my most rewarding experience this
year. I learned a lot about myself. Members of
the Stanford community learned about trans

gender identities for the first time. And per
haps most importantly, this column legit
imized identities that have long been ignored
and unacknowledged. I would like to thank
The Daily for taking on this controversial
topic you've not only helped educate the
Stanford community, you've also empower
ing a small, voiceless minority. My experience
at the The Daily has taught me the impor
tance of speaking my voice in the world. I can
leave Stanford with no regrets.

KAMIL DADA,
VOLUME 237
EDITOR IN CHIEF

As my Stanford undergraduate ex
perience comes to an end, I have
been trying to reflect on what has
been most meaningful to me.
Without a doubt, I readily reach
the conclusion that it is the people. Beyond
all the classes, deadlines, projects and ex
tracurricular activities, the one area of my
Stanford experience that has consistently
stuck out at me is the connection and rela
tionships with other people. I believe that life
isn't about delayed gratification. It is about
making the most of one's experiences and re
lationships today. We are all busy and have
little free time, but there is only so much we
can gain through stunted conversations
about work in between meetings on our
tightly packed schedules.
In a sense, some of my most meaningful re
lationships have come through failure. As a
typical Stanford student, I tried to portray
myself as a winner. However, in doing so, I
wasn't able to appreciate and come to terms
with my limitations, vulnerabilities and my
self as a whole. Only by putting myself out
there and going beyond the everyday worries
was I able to connect with other people at a
deeper level. I am still learning to open up to
others in this way and move beyond discus
sions in terms of midterms, problem sets, pa
pers and other "acceptable" topics of conver
sation. By only discussing our sleep depriva
tion or work-related stress, we restrict what
we reveal to other people. Broader concerns
almost seem out of place when there is so
much work to do on campus. That said, what
is important isn't necessarily the duration of
the conversation, but the quality of the con
versation. Some of the most profoundly mov
ing conversations I have had at Stanford have
been short.
So I would like to dedicate this farewell
column and my time at Stanford to everyone
on campus who made my life that little bit
better. Whether it was a smile and serendipi
tous conversation while walking across cam
pus, heart-felt advice, or a long philosophical
conversation that lasted all night, I thank you.
These are the memories and experiences that
I will cherish forever when I look back upon
my college years.

ELLEN HUET

Although I've written thousands of
words for The Daily over the last
three years, I've never been able
to use the first person, and even
now, it's making me a bit nervous.
The Daily was a group into which I was
nudged as a sophomore and for which I've re
luctantly and also whole-heartedly given
much of my time at Stanford. There's nothing
like the bonding of a newsroom to strengthen
the friendships I've made here, and it also
helps that those who've come through our
doors whether once or twice or every
night for a year are some of the most ded
icated and thoughtful folk I've met on the
Farm. (Shout-out to Duran for being a bailer
decades before current graduating seniors
were born.)
It's one thing to really dedicate oneself to
a student organization on campus; it's an in
credible experience that comes with ups and
downs, vaguely irrational attachment to a
group and a likely demise for one's GPA. But
at The Daily we're lucky to be able to take
pride in working toward a bigger goal as well.
Keeping independent student journalism
alive, kicking ass and taking names while
we're at it and double-checking the
spelling so we print it correctly the next day.
Many late nights, many rough times, a
handful of sweet victories and no regrets.
Thanks, Daily.

ELIZABETH TITUS,
VOLUME 238
EDITOR IN CHIEF

Of all the types of writing that go
into the newspaper, news briefs
have always been my favorite.
I'll keep this brief, too: It was an
incredible privilege to attend
Stanford and serve as editor in chief of The
Daily. I am deeply grateful to Rowland and
Pat Rebele, Harry Press and the George and
Emily Jacobs Scholarship Fund; The Daily
board of directors; the Friends of The Stan
ford Daily Foundation; Mary Liz McCurdy
and Claire Slattery, Daily business leaders;
Tim Crews and Evan Smith, editors;
Michael Kahan and Laura Selznick, aca
demic advisers; Glenn Frankel, mentor and
friend; and the many other professors, staff
and journalists who have shared their time
and wisdom.
Also deserving are my friends and Daily
colleagues. When I remember what was best
about my time at Stanford, I'll remember
them.
Above all, thanks to Mom, Dad, Abbey
and Grady. I love you.

NIKHIL JOSHI

My four years at Stanford have
many cherished characteris
tics; some of them will last
two degrees, friendships that
will hold for years and a re
markable amount of personal growth
while others are more ephemeral a care
free life in "the bubble," sleeping in on a
Tuesday, biking in the breeze on a sunny day.
Most of these aspects of life are probably
more attributable to my age (the 17 to 21 age
group being a particularly exciting time)
than my institution (Stanford). But one of
the most critical components of my last four
years would have been impossible to find
anywhere else: good advice.
My freshman year was, like I imagine it
is for most, a complete blur. I took lots of
introductory classes and met lots of new
people, but after 10 months still had ab
solutely no clue who I was or what I want
ed to do with my life. It was in this context
that during the first week of my sophomore
year I walked into the third-floor office of
one of my Sophomore College instructors
and asked him to be my Economics major
advisor.

But over the course of the next three
years punctuated by advising meetings
that started out quarterly but quickly be
came more frequent things began to
come into focus. My advisor counseled me to
take academia more seriously, so I spent a
year writing an empirical economics honors
thesis. He pushed me to think about the pol
icy world, so I interned at the White House
and got a master's in public policy. Mostly, he
got me to think like an economist and con
centrate on the important things in life and
not on all the noise.
Thank you Professor Noll, I couldn't have
done it without you.

AMY JULIA HARRIS

When I wrote my first features
article three years ago a
hard-hitting investigation of
Palo Alto's cafe culture I
had no idea that with one ar
ticle I would enter The Stanford Daily family.
But that was all it took. Since then. The Daily
has become the focal point of my time at
Stanford the place where I've spent late
nights dreaming up witty headlines, scram
bling to finish last-minute stories before pro
duction and learning all about all the inner
workings of the Stanford community. But
most importantly, The Daily is the place
where I grew up. It was through writing that I
met the amazing group of writers and editors
who have become my best friends, was forced
to evaluate and form convictions about issues
that arose in reporting and was challenged
and inspired to seriously pursue journalism. I
lost countless hours of sleep but gained irre
placeable life experiences through The Daily.
I can't say how thankful I am that I wrote for
my college paper or how much I'm going
to miss it.
