## THE 						AXE COMES HOME THE 						CARDINAL TRAVELS ACROSS THE BAY AND DISMANTLES THE BEARS 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The Axe is coming back to Stan
ford.
The No. 6 Cardinal football team
won Stanford's annual rivalry game
handily, defeating California by a
final score of 48-14. Stanford (10-1,
7-1 Pac-10) scored 31 points in the
first half to zero for the Golden
Bears (5-6, 3-5), playing a strong
game on both sides of the ball
throughout.
Tension between the two teams
bubbled to the surface early in the
game, as both benches emptied dur
ing the coin toss and faced each
other down at the center of the
field. The players exchanged taunts
and provocations, and both teams
were flagged with personal foul
penalties. Stanford sophomore
wideout Jamal-Rashad Patterson
was ejected after aiming a blow at
Cal defensive back C.J. Moncrease,
who provoked Patterson by spitting
at him.

"It's a rivalry game," said senior
cornerback Richard Sherman.
"Tempers flare. They were trying to
show their enthusiasm, and we were
trying to show our enthusiasm.
Even before that, in warm-ups, it
kind of escalated early on."
Stanford set the tone early in the
game, on Cal's first drive. On the
third play of the game, Cal quarter
back Brock Mansion fumbled the
ball, and it was pounced on by red
shirt junior defensive end Matt
Masifilo to give Stanford its first
possession of the game deep inside
Cal territory.
When asked whether it mattered
that his team turned the ball over on
its first drive, Cal head coach Jeff
Tedford said, "Absolutely. No ques
tion. You don't fumble a snap and
give them the ball down in the red
zone to start the game. There were a
lot of plays to be made, but we did
n't play well enough to win."
However, Stanford was unable
to fully capitalize on its early oppor
tunity. Indeed, the Card failed to

gain any offensive yardage on its
first drive it gained 15 yards on a
pass interference penalty. A field
goal from senior kicker Nate
Whitaker gave Stanford its first
points of the day.
On its next drive, the Golden
Bears appeared ready to match
Stanford and recover from their
early miscue. After a kickoff return
to the Cal 34-yard line. Mansion
and running back Shane Vereen
led the Golden Bears deep into
Stanford territory. However, Man
sion lofted up a pass into the Cardi
nal red zone that was easily picked
off by Sherman at the Cardinal's
own five-yard line.

"Turnovers cost us down in the
red zone us getting in the red
zone and turning the ball over
and then turning the ball over in
their end zone to give them a short
field," Tedford said.
After the Sherman intercep
tion, Stanford redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck
marched his offense down the

field, scoring its first touchdown of
the game on a short run from soph
omore running back Stepfan Tay
lor. The biggest play of the drive
was a scramble that Luck turned
into a 58-yard gain down the left
sideline, dodging and battering
through several Cal defenders be
fore finally running out-of-bounds
all the way down at the Cal 21-yard
line. The run included a memorable
stiff-arm on Cal defensive back
Sean Cattouse.

"It was just a lesson for me," Cat
touse said. "At the last second, I got
caught between making that big hit
and wrapping him up."
Stanford proceeded to score
touchdowns on its next five drives,
more or less imposing its will on
Cal's porous defense. The Cardinal
employed a highly balanced attack,
mixing its signature power running
game with throws from Luck at
short and long range. Its 467 total
offensive yards were almost per
fectly split 235 passing yards and
232 rushing yards. The performance

was especially notable because it
followed a weak showing last week
end against Arizona State, where
the Card could only muster 17
points.

"They knew what they had to
do," redshirt sophomore linebacker
Chase Thomas said about his team's
offense. "They made a lot of adjust
ments early and they weren't
stopped after that."
Stanford's defense also played
well, forcing three turnovers and
playing opportunistically. The Cardi
nal held the Bears to 6-of-14 third
down conversions and forced one
turnover on downs, limiting the of
fense to 299 yards overall. Mansion,
who started the season as Cal's back
up quarterback, had a rough day
under center, going 19-37 for 173
passing yards, including two inter
ceptions and one touchdown pass.
"We put a lot of pressure on
[Mansion],"Thomas said. "He does
n't have that much experience I

think he was exposed in the game.
He had a couple interceptions; he
fumbled a snap; he seemed pretty
rattled. I think that helped us out."
Comparatively, Luck had a very
strong game to lead the Stanford of
fense, going 16-20 for 235 yards and
two touchdowns, with no intercep
tions. Luck was also first on the team
in rushing with three carries for 72
yards.
After the game, Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh called Luck
the "best college football player in

the country," and his teammates had
similar words of praise.
"He's the greatest player I've
ever seen,"Taylor said. "He makes it
a lot easier it's hard to play de
fense out there against him; he can
run and pass. We all see him week in
and week out; he's a great quarter
back."
The win was also significant for
Stanford, as it broke a recent string
of futility in Big Game matchups.
Cal had won the last three Big
Games and seven of the last eight,
and there's no doubt the rivalry
added an extra dimension to the
game for both teams.
"We knew there was going to be
a lot of emotion in this game," Luck
said. "Obviously,you're not going to

be able to pull out all of those emo
tions ... it was a little tough not try
ing to get involved in everything, but
we knew we just had to play foot
ball."
Last year's close Big Game also
played into Luck's motivation.
Stanford had opportunities to win
that game, but eventually fell, 34-28,
after a Luck interception late in the
game.
"I definitely had some motiva
tion coming off of last year's disap
pointment," Luck said. "But, that
being said, it was a new year and you
can't really dwell on the past too
much."

caught between making that big hit
and wrapping him up."
Stanford proceeded to score
touchdowns on its next five drives,
more or less imposing its will on
Cal's porous defense. The Cardinal
employed a highly balanced attack,
mixing its signature power running
game with throws from Luck at
short and long range. Its 467 total
offensive yards were almost per
fectly split 235 passing yards and
232 rushing yards. The performance

was especially notable because it
followed a weak showing last week
end against Arizona State, where
the Card could only muster 17
points.

"They knew what they had to
do," redshirt sophomore linebacker
Chase Thomas said about his team's
offense. "They made a lot of adjust
ments early and they weren't
stopped after that."
Stanford's defense also played
well, forcing three turnovers and
playing opportunistically. The Cardi
nal held the Bears to 6-of-14 third
down conversions and forced one
turnover on downs, limiting the of
fense to 299 yards overall. Mansion,
who started the season as Cal's back
up quarterback, had a rough day
under center, going 19-37 for 173
passing yards, including two inter
ceptions and one touchdown pass.
"We put a lot of pressure on
[Mansion],"Thomas said. "He does

think he was exposed in the game.
He had a couple interceptions; he
fumbled a snap; he seemed pretty
rattled. I think that helped us out."
Comparatively, Luck had a very
strong game to lead the Stanford of
fense, going 16-20 for 235 yards and
two touchdowns, with no intercep
tions. Luck was also first on the team
in rushing with three carries for 72
yards.
After the game, Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh called Luck
the "best college football player in

the country," and his teammates had
similar words of praise.
"He's the greatest player I've
ever seen,"Taylor said. "He makes it
a lot easier it's hard to play de
fense out there against him; he can
run and pass. We all see him week in
and week out; he's a great quarter
back."
The win was also significant for
Stanford, as it broke a recent string
of futility in Big Game matchups.
Cal had won the last three Big
Games and seven of the last eight,
and there's no doubt the rivalry
added an extra dimension to the
game for both teams.
"We knew there was going to be
a lot of emotion in this game," Luck
said. "Obviously,you're not going to

be able to pull out all of those emo
tions ... it was a little tough not try
ing to get involved in everything, but
we knew we just had to play foot
ball."
Last year's close Big Game also
played into Luck's motivation.
Stanford had opportunities to win
that game, but eventually fell, 34-28,
after a Luck interception late in the
game.
"I definitely had some motiva
tion coming off of last year's disap
pointment," Luck said. "But, that
being said, it was a new year and you
can't really dwell on the past too
much."

The Axe is coming back to Stan
ford.
The No. 6 Cardinal football team
won Stanford's annual rivalry game
handily, defeating California by a
final score of 48-14. Stanford (10-1,
7-1 Pac-10) scored 31 points in the
first half to zero for the Golden
Bears (5-6, 3-5), playing a strong
game on both sides of the ball
throughout.
Tension between the two teams
bubbled to the surface early in the
game, as both benches emptied dur
ing the coin toss and faced each
other down at the center of the
field. The players exchanged taunts
and provocations, and both teams
were flagged with personal foul
penalties. Stanford sophomore
wideout Jamal-Rashad Patterson
was ejected after aiming a blow at
Cal defensive back C.J. Moncrease,
who provoked Patterson by spitting
at him.

"It's a rivalry game," said senior
cornerback Richard Sherman.
"Tempers flare. They were trying to
show their enthusiasm, and we were
trying to show our enthusiasm.
Even before that, in warm-ups, it
kind of escalated early on."
Stanford set the tone early in the
game, on Cal's first drive. On the
third play of the game, Cal quarter
back Brock Mansion fumbled the
ball, and it was pounced on by red
shirt junior defensive end Matt
Masifilo to give Stanford its first
possession of the game deep inside
Cal territory.
When asked whether it mattered
that his team turned the ball over on
its first drive, Cal head coach Jeff
Tedford said, "Absolutely. No ques
tion. You don't fumble a snap and
give them the ball down in the red
zone to start the game. There were a
lot of plays to be made, but we did
n't play well enough to win."
However, Stanford was unable
to fully capitalize on its early oppor
tunity. Indeed, the Card failed to

gain any offensive yardage on its
first drive it gained 15 yards on a
pass interference penalty. A field
goal from senior kicker Nate
Whitaker gave Stanford its first
points of the day.
On its next drive, the Golden
Bears appeared ready to match
Stanford and recover from their
early miscue. After a kickoff return
to the Cal 34-yard line. Mansion
and running back Shane Vereen
led the Golden Bears deep into
Stanford territory. However, Man
sion lofted up a pass into the Cardi
nal red zone that was easily picked
off by Sherman at the Cardinal's
own five-yard line.

"Turnovers cost us down in the
red zone us getting in the red
zone and turning the ball over
and then turning the ball over in
their end zone to give them a short
field," Tedford said.
After the Sherman intercep
tion, Stanford redshirt sophomore
quarterback Andrew Luck
marched his offense down the

field, scoring its first touchdown of
the game on a short run from soph
omore running back Stepfan Tay
lor. The biggest play of the drive
was a scramble that Luck turned
into a 58-yard gain down the left
sideline, dodging and battering
through several Cal defenders be
fore finally running out-of-bounds
all the way down at the Cal 21-yard
line. The run included a memorable
stiff-arm on Cal defensive back
Sean Cattouse.

"It was just a lesson for me," Cat
touse said. "At the last second, I got
caught between making that big hit
and wrapping him up."
