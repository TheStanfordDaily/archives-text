### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
The wait is over.
After heartbreaking finishes in
women's basketball and soccer ear
lier in the academic year, the Stan
ford athletics program has finally
broken through with its 100 th team
NCAA title. That honor comes
courtesy of the men's gymnastics
team, which secured its second
championship in three years on Fri
day night at the NCAA Team Finals
in Columbus, Ohio.
"I am ecstatic that men's gym
nastics was the team to reach the
100 th title for Stanford," said Stan
ford head coach Thorn Glielmi. "It
is an incredible achievement for
Stanford and the fact that it was
men's gymnastics that won it is just
icing on the cake."

Stanford scored a remarkable
363.450 in the team finals, edging
out runner-up Oklahoma (361.600)
and third-place Illinois (360.150).
That final mark came despite a
less-than-stellar start in Friday's
first event, the parallel bars. After
scoring the NCAA's best score of
the year with 61.500 in Thursday's
preliminaries, the Cardinal posted a
solid but unremarkable 59.950 on
Friday. Redshirt sophomore
Cameron Foreman and senior
Ryan Lieberman led Stanford with
scores of 15.200 in the event for
Foreman, it was a career best.
Next was the horizontal bar,
where Stanford showed why it was
the NCAA leader in the event en
tering Friday's meet. The Cardinal
recorded a score of 59.300, led by
