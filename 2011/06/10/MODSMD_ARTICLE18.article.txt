# M. GYMNASTICS
## Men vault Stanford to 100 championships 
### NATE ADAMS MANAGING EDITOR 
The wait is over.
After heartbreaking finishes in
women's basketball and soccer ear
lier in the academic year, the Stan
ford athletics program has finally
broken through with its 100 th team
NCAA title. That honor comes
courtesy of the men's gymnastics
team, which secured its second
championship in three years on Fri
day night at the NCAA Team Finals
in Columbus, Ohio.
"I am ecstatic that men's gym
nastics was the team to reach the
100 th title for Stanford," said Stan
ford head coach Thorn Glielmi. "It
is an incredible achievement for
Stanford and the fact that it was
men's gymnastics that won it is just
icing on the cake."

Stanford scored a remarkable
363.450 in the team finals, edging
out runner-up Oklahoma (361.600)
and third-place Illinois (360.150).
That final mark came despite a
less-than-stellar start in Friday's
first event, the parallel bars. After
scoring the NCAA's best score of
the year with 61.500 in Thursday's
preliminaries, the Cardinal posted a
solid but unremarkable 59.950 on
Friday. Redshirt sophomore
Cameron Foreman and senior
Ryan Lieberman led Stanford with
scores of 15.200 in the event for
Foreman, it was a career best.

recorded a score of 59.300, led by

senior Alex Busaglia's mark of
15.400, which tied for the best score
of the night.
Stanford came through with a
season-best effort on the floor ex
ercise, which may have pushed the
team over the edge in the final
standings. Sophomore Eddie
Penev's mark of 15.950 helped his
team secure the NCAA's second
best floor score at 62.450, while
seniors Josh Dixon, Tim Gentry
and Buscaglia all posted scores of
15.300 or above.
The Cardinal struggled a bit on
the pommel horse and still rings,
but pulled into a comfortable lead
in the vault. Lieberman and red
shirt junior Abhinav Ramani
boosted Stanford into the lead with
vault scores of 15.850 and 15.950,
respectively. Dixon, Buscaglia and
Gentry then all but secured Stan

ford's victory with marks of 16.000,
16.350 and 16.250.
With the win, the Stanford
squad captured its fifth title in pro
gram history the others came in
1992,1993,1995 and 2009. Glielmi,
who took over as head coach in
2003, now has two championships.
Stanford is just the second
school in history to boast 100 team
championships, behind UCLA's
nation-best mark of 106. The title
also continues a remarkable streak
for Stanford, which has won at least
one NCAA Championship for 35
years.
The men's gymnastics team wasn't
quite done, as members of the team
returned to action on Saturday for
the NCAA Individual Champi
onships. Buscaglia led the way, tak
ing home his first-ever individual
title on the horizontal bar. He was
n't alone in earning commenda
tions, as six Cardinal gymnasts
earned a total of nine All-America
honors.
As the NCAA leader on horizontal
bar for nearly the entire season,

Buscaglia lived up to his reputation
with the lights-out score of 15.750,
winning by nearly half a point.
Adding to a career night, Buscaglia
earned All-America honors on the
parallel bar with a sixth-place score
of 14.400.
Gentry had a phenomenal night as
well, earning a remarkable three
All-America honors with top-eight
finishes on the rings, vault and floor
exercise. The senior now has seven
All-America honors in his career.
Dixon and Penev added to their
All-American totals with fourth
and fifth-place finishes on the floor
exercise, while Foreman and fresh
man Chris Turner became first
time All-Americans on the parallel
bars and pommel horse, respective

The meet marks the end of an in
credible season for Stanford, which
regained its title as NCAA champi
on and established its program as
one of the best in recent history.

15.300 or above.
The Cardinal struggled a bit on
the pommel horse and still rings,
but pulled into a comfortable lead
in the vault. Lieberman and red
shirt junior Abhinav Ramani
boosted Stanford into the lead with
vault scores of 15.850 and 15.950,
respectively. Dixon, Buscaglia and
Gentry then all but secured Stan

ford's victory with marks of 16.000,
16.350 and 16.250.
With the win, the Stanford
squad captured its fifth title in pro
gram history the others came in
1992,1993,1995 and 2009. Glielmi,
who took over as head coach in
2003, now has two championships.
Stanford is just the second
school in history to boast 100 team
championships, behind UCLA's
nation-best mark of 106. The title
also continues a remarkable streak
for Stanford, which has won at least
one NCAA Championship for 35
years.
The men's gymnastics team wasn't
quite done, as members of the team
returned to action on Saturday for
the NCAA Individual Champi
onships. Buscaglia led the way, tak
ing home his first-ever individual
title on the horizontal bar. He was
n't alone in earning commenda
tions, as six Cardinal gymnasts
earned a total of nine All-America
honors.
As the NCAA leader on horizontal
bar for nearly the entire season,

Buscaglia lived up to his reputation
with the lights-out score of 15.750,
winning by nearly half a point.
Adding to a career night, Buscaglia
earned All-America honors on the
parallel bar with a sixth-place score
of 14.400.
Gentry had a phenomenal night as
well, earning a remarkable three
All-America honors with top-eight
finishes on the rings, vault and floor
exercise. The senior now has seven
All-America honors in his career.
Dixon and Penev added to their
All-American totals with fourth
and fifth-place finishes on the floor
exercise, while Foreman and fresh
man Chris Turner became first
time All-Americans on the parallel
bars and pommel horse, respective
ly-
The meet marks the end of an in
credible season for Stanford, which
regained its title as NCAA champi
on and established its program as
one of the best in recent history.
