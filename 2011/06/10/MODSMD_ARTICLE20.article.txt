## Pohlen helps end UConn win streak 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The great streak is finally over.
And going with it, in a small sense, is
Stanford's heartbreak.
Entering Thursday's game, a 71-
59 victory for Stanford over goliath
Connecticut (12-1), the No. 1
Huskies had won 90 consecutive
games, including two straight na
tional championships. It was the
longest winning streak in the histo
ry of NCAA Division I basketball,
narrowly beating the 88-game mark
set by the UCLA men's team from
1971-1974 under former Bruin head
coach John Wooden.

That is, until Jeanette Pohlen
launched the No. 9 Cardinal (9-2)
into cruise control over the Huskies
at Maples Pavilion on Thursday.
The senior guard posted a career
high 31 points. She kick-started the
offense with a game-opening three
pointer, and the Cardinal never
gave up that lead. Pohlen's perform
ance was the highlight of a feel
good victory for Stanford, which
had fallen to Connecticut in the

Final Four in two consecutive ap
pearances.

The game was no doubt marked
on Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's calendar before the sea
son began; the last meeting of the
coast-to-coast rivals was in the 2010
national championship game, which
VanDerveer's Cardinal seemed to
have in control before falling to the
Huskies, 53-47.
"It's not a national champi
onship," she said. "But this was a
great night for us, and we're excit
ed."
The Cardinal jumped out early
on the Huskies, building its lead as
high as 13 points in the opening
frame. Connecticut showed re
silience, though, posting an 11-2 run
to pull within 34-30 at the end of the
half.
But that was as close as Con
necticut would come. With leading
scorer Maya Moore going just 5-for
-15 with 14 points including a
scoreless 16 minutes to open the
game the Huskies couldn't keep
