## Pohlen helps end UConn win streak 
### NATE ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
The great streak is finally over.
And going with it, in a small sense, is
Stanford's heartbreak.
Entering Thursday's game, a 71-
59 victory for Stanford over goliath
Connecticut (12-1), the No. 1
Huskies had won 90 consecutive
games, including two straight na
tional championships. It was the
longest winning streak in the histo
ry of NCAA Division I basketball,
narrowly beating the 88-game mark
set by the UCLA men's team from
1971-1974 under former Bruin head
coach John Wooden.

That is, until Jeanette Pohlen
launched the No. 9 Cardinal (9-2)
into cruise control over the Huskies
at Maples Pavilion on Thursday.
The senior guard posted a career
high 31 points. She kick-started the
offense with a game-opening three
pointer, and the Cardinal never
gave up that lead. Pohlen's perform
ance was the highlight of a feel
good victory for Stanford, which
had fallen to Connecticut in the

Final Four in two consecutive ap
pearances.

The game was no doubt marked
on Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's calendar before the sea
son began; the last meeting of the
coast-to-coast rivals was in the 2010
national championship game, which
VanDerveer's Cardinal seemed to
have in control before falling to the
Huskies, 53-47.
"It's not a national champi
onship," she said. "But this was a
great night for us, and we're excit
ed."
The Cardinal jumped out early
on the Huskies, building its lead as
high as 13 points in the opening
frame. Connecticut showed re
silience, though, posting an 11-2 run
to pull within 34-30 at the end of the
half.
But that was as close as Con
necticut would come. With leading
scorer Maya Moore going just 5-for
-15 with 14 points including a
scoreless 16 minutes to open the
game the Huskies couldn't keep
up as Stanford reignited its offense
in the second half. Moore, who
posted a game-high 23 points
against the Cardinal in last year's
national championship, has aver
aged 24.8 points per game this sea
son.
"She's human," VanDerveer
said.
Speaking for herself, Moore
gave credit to Stanford's size and
assertiveness.
"They played a physical game
against us. It was that simple," she
said.
It didn't help that Pohlen
scored a pair of threes in the first
10 minutes of the second half, help
ing Stanford push its lead back up
to a comfortable 55-44. Down the
stretch, Pohlen closed out the
rally-savvy Huskies with six free
throws in the last 42.5 seconds of
the game.
As impressive as her career-best
effort was, Pohlen wasn't alone in
putting up big offensive numbers
on Thursday. Junior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had a solid
performance of her own with 12
points, while senior forward Kayla
Pedersen added 11 more.
However, it was Stanford's pun
ishing defensive work that hurt the
Huskies most. The Cardinal held
Connecticut to just 20-for-61 shoot
ing, good for only 32.8 percent.
Stanford was more efficient, scor
ing 25 field goals on 55 shots.

While the win will certainly be
remembered most for shutting
down Connecticut's record-break
ing streak, it has some added signif
icance for the Stanford faithful. In
killing the streak, Stanford showed
that it could still dance with UConn
after being the last team to defeat
the Huskies, eliminating them from
the 2008 postseason with an 82-73
victory.
The Cardinal also pushed a
streak of its own for consecutive
home wins up to 52 with the vic
tory.
And it certainly felt like a home
game. Despite students being most
ly off campus, Maples Pavilion was
packed with a sellout crowd of
7,329, all eager to see the nationally
televised rematch of last year's top
two squads in person. After the vic
tory, VanDerveer and Pohlen both
stepped back onto the court to
thank the crowd.
VanDerveer was sure to con
gratulate Connecticut and head
coach Geno Auriemma for their
record-breaking streak, but for her,
the focus of Thursday's outcome
was a little different.
"I'm just happy for our team,"
she said. "The streak is something
that they did. We're about Stanford
and what we want to do."
After a stunning finish to its
non-conference season, Stanford
will have to stay tough as it seeks an
11th straight Pac-10 title. With the
playoffs coming afterward, the Car
dinal may meet up with the Huskies
once more.

The Stanford women's basketball team shocked the nation when it defeated
the UConn Huskies, ending the juggernaut's 90-game winning streak.
Senior Jeanette Pohlen scored 31 points in front of a sellout crowd of 7,329.
The great streak is finally over.
And going with it, in a small sense, is
Stanford's heartbreak.
Entering Thursday's game, a 71-
59 victory for Stanford over goliath
Connecticut (12-1), the No. 1
Huskies had won 90 consecutive
games, including two straight na
tional championships. It was the
longest winning streak in the histo
ry of NCAA Division I basketball,
narrowly beating the 88-game mark
set by the UCLA men's team from
1971-1974 under former Bruin head
coach John Wooden.

That is, until Jeanette Pohlen
launched the No. 9 Cardinal (9-2)
into cruise control over the Huskies
at Maples Pavilion on Thursday.
The senior guard posted a career
high 31 points. She kick-started the
offense with a game-opening three
pointer, and the Cardinal never
gave up that lead. Pohlen's perform
ance was the highlight of a feel
good victory for Stanford, which
had fallen to Connecticut in the

Final Four in two consecutive ap
pearances.

The game was no doubt marked
on Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's calendar before the sea
son began; the last meeting of the
coast-to-coast rivals was in the 2010
national championship game, which
VanDerveer's Cardinal seemed to
have in control before falling to the
Huskies, 53-47.
"It's not a national champi
onship," she said. "But this was a
great night for us, and we're excit
ed."
The Cardinal jumped out early
on the Huskies, building its lead as
high as 13 points in the opening
frame. Connecticut showed re
silience, though, posting an 11-2 run
to pull within 34-30 at the end of the
half.
But that was as close as Con
necticut would come. With leading
scorer Maya Moore going just 5-for
-15 with 14 points including a
scoreless 16 minutes to open the
game the Huskies couldn't keep
up as Stanford reignited its offense
in the second half. Moore, who
posted a game-high 23 points
against the Cardinal in last year's
national championship, has aver
aged 24.8 points per game this sea
son.
"She's human," VanDerveer
said.
Speaking for herself, Moore
gave credit to Stanford's size and
assertiveness.
"They played a physical game
against us. It was that simple," she
said.
It didn't help that Pohlen
scored a pair of threes in the first
10 minutes of the second half, help
ing Stanford push its lead back up
to a comfortable 55-44. Down the
stretch, Pohlen closed out the
rally-savvy Huskies with six free
throws in the last 42.5 seconds of
the game.
As impressive as her career-best
effort was, Pohlen wasn't alone in
putting up big offensive numbers
on Thursday. Junior forward
Nnemkadi Ogwumike had a solid
performance of her own with 12
points, while senior forward Kayla
Pedersen added 11 more.
However, it was Stanford's pun
ishing defensive work that hurt the
Huskies most. The Cardinal held
Connecticut to just 20-for-61 shoot
ing, good for only 32.8 percent.
Stanford was more efficient, scor
ing 25 field goals on 55 shots.

While the win will certainly be
remembered most for shutting
down Connecticut's record-break
ing streak, it has some added signif
icance for the Stanford faithful. In
killing the streak, Stanford showed
that it could still dance with UConn
after being the last team to defeat
the Huskies, eliminating them from
the 2008 postseason with an 82-73
victory.
The Cardinal also pushed a
streak of its own for consecutive
home wins up to 52 with the vic
tory.
And it certainly felt like a home
game. Despite students being most
ly off campus, Maples Pavilion was
packed with a sellout crowd of
7,329, all eager to see the nationally
televised rematch of last year's top
two squads in person. After the vic
tory, VanDerveer and Pohlen both
stepped back onto the court to
thank the crowd.
VanDerveer was sure to con
gratulate Connecticut and head
coach Geno Auriemma for their
record-breaking streak, but for her,
the focus of Thursday's outcome
was a little different.
"I'm just happy for our team,"
she said. "The streak is something
that they did. We're about Stanford
and what we want to do."
After a stunning finish to its
non-conference season, Stanford
will have to stay tough as it seeks an
11th straight Pac-10 title. With the
playoffs coming afterward, the Car
dinal may meet up with the Huskies
once more.
