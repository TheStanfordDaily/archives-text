## QB Luck shuns NFL, returns to Cardinal 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Let's face it: Andrew Luck's de
cision to return to school does very
little for his football future. He's a
finished product who was the guar
anteed No. 1 choice in 2011. He'd be
a multimillionaire multiple times
over come April. So why come
back?
"It's a Rorschach test for peo
ple's values system."
That's his father, Oliver Luck,
talking to the (many, many) people
who question Luck's choice. Be
cause for his son, it's not about the
millions: it's about education, and
it's about the potential to take Stan
ford to heights unseen in the mod
ern era. In an era where the idea of
the amateur athlete is questioned
on a seemingly day-to-day basis,
Luck's decision epitomizes the con
cept of the student-athlete. And the
rub is this: it's not that surprising.
His public statements hinted at him
staying, and the decision fits exactly
with his humble, studious persona.
But armchair quarterbacks, wal
lowing in their ignorance, will al
ways question that which they do
not know. So let's break this down,
and look at why Luck stayed. To do
so, let's first look at the reasons to
leave. They number exactly two:
money and injury risk.
To the first: the NFL is currently
negotiating a new Collective Bar
gaining Agreement (CBA), with
one of the tenets being a rookie
wage scale. Simply put, the idea of
first-year players making the most
money at their position before play
ing a snap is troubling to many.
When the new CBA is signed, the
salaries are expected to be far lower
than they are now that is to say,
Sam Bradford's $5O million in guar
anteed money is a thing of that past.
But not so fast: the CBA discussions
are heated, and a lockout is entirely
possible. If that happens, a draft will
still occur, but no scale will be im
plemented. If that is the case, then
Luck would have one shot to make
a dramatic sum of money off the

bat.
By 2012, a scale will be in place,
and he'll stand to make tens of mil
lions of dollars less. But Luck comes
from a financially secure back
ground, and has made it clear over
and over that money is not an object
for him; his father's comments con
firm it. Even if the wage scale lowers
his earning power to about three
million a year Peter King's pro
jection he's still in the top two
percent of wage earners in the Unit
ed States. More than enough to live
comfortably, and if he really is as
good as he's projected to be, he'll
make his tens of millions on his next
deal.
To the second: Luck is the guar
anteed No. 1 pick in 2011. He is also
all but guaranteed No. 1 in 2012.
Any scout from coast to coast will
tell you that he is a historically gift
ed prospect; some say he's the best
since Peyton Manning, while others
say he's the best since John Elway.
No player will supplant him if he
stays healthy. (Perish any Jake
Locker comparisons one guy is a
quarterback; the other is a superior
athlete who throws the ball occa
sionally.) Manning was projected
No. 1 after his junior year, remained
in school, and went No. 1 after his
senior season. If he's injured, it's
still unlikely, unless it's (knock furi
ously on wood) career-ending.
Bradford was projected to go first
overall in 2009, went back to school,
got injured and barely played, then
still went No. 1 in 2010.That is to say,
Luck is almost certainly going to be
the first person walking across the
stage in New York in April 2012,
even if his arm is in a sling. He's not
exactly hurting his draft stock by
staying.
With those two concerns aside,
why go? If there is indeed an NFL
lockout, he won't be able to partici
pate in mini-camps and might have
to miss part of the season. Luck is a
football player; he doesn't want to
sit on the sideline.The team he'd be
going to, the Carolina Panthers, is
