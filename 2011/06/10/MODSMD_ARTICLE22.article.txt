## Alumnus David Shaw named head coach 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY KABIR SAWHNEY 
Stanford has named offensive
coordinator and running backs
coach David Shaw '95 the newest
head coach of the Cardinal football
program. Shaw was officially intro
duced at a press conference on
Thursday afternoon.
Shaw, who played wide receiver
for Stanford in the early 19905, takes
over the title of Bradford M. Free
man Director of Football from Jim
Harbaugh, who left the Farm for the
San Francisco 49ers after four sea
sons. Shaw served with Harbaugh
throughout his time at Stanford, as
well as at the University of San
Diego.
A favorite of players and alumni
alike, Shaw enters the top spot after
a coaching search that saw most of
its focus on in-house candidates, so
as to provide continuity with the
highly successful Harbaugh era.
Aside from Shaw, associate head
coach Greg Roman, defensive coor
dinator Vic Fangio and special
teams coordinator Brian Polian
were interviewed. Stanford had a
brief flirtation with Boise State's
Chris Petersen before he reaffirmed
his commitment to his current
school.
Shaw, 38, confirmed that he plans
to keep using the philosophy that
Harbaugh instilled during his
tenure, building a physical, running
team on offense and an aggressive,
hard-hitting defense. He said that he

was not willing to rest on the accom
plishments of last season, when the
Cardinal capped its first 12-win sea
son in history with a victory in the
Orange Bowl.
"Take the 2010 season out
standing, phenomenal. We're going
to put it in a box, we're going to put
a ribbon on it, we're going to put it
on the shelf for everybody to ad
mire," Shaw said. "But our goals are
not met. We're not done ... we have
a desire to be the first Pac-12 cham
pion."
Shaw also expressed his desire to
build a consistently strong program
at Stanford while embracing the
University's focus on academics.
"Two good years of football is
not enough," he said. "That's not
what we're aiming for. We're aiming
for consistency, for a team that's
going to make Stanford University
proud every time we step on the
field."
Athletic director Bob Bowlsby
said that he had serious discussions
with three external candidates
about Stanford's head coaching po
sition and contacted four other
coaches, but he declined to name
any of them.
"This is, in my estimation, the
most logical step that we can take,"
Bowlsby said at the press conference.
"[Shaw] is a proven recruiter. He's
got great college and NFL experi
ence. He understands and embraces
the athletic and academic merger at
Stanford University. His contribu
tion to the current state of affairs in
our football program is immeasura
ble, and he is a person of impeccable
character and integrity."
In Shaw, Stanford has found a
young coach with eight years of
NFL experience who is also likely to
be seriously dedicated to the Farm.
He is the 34th coach in the pro
gram's tenure, and no head man has
stayed for more than nine years.
"I went into the interview
process with the mindset that I
wanted this to be my last head
coaching interview ever," Shaw
said. Referring to the Stanford
women's basketball coach, he
added: "I want to be in the 25-and
up club thatTara VanDerveer is in."
Shaw began his coaching career
immediately after his graduation
from Stanford, heading first to
Western Washington before head
ing to the Philadelphia Eagles for
his first NFL job. He remained in
the professional ranks until he
joined Harbaugh's staff in San
Diego in 2006, then came to Stan
ford with Harbaugh the next year.
For his first three seasons with the
Cardinal, he operated as both the
wide receivers' coach and offensive
coordinator, but in 2010, while re
taining his coordinator title, he
switched his focus to running backs.
Now, he becomes the first Stan
ford alumnus to lead the Cardinal
program since Paul Wiggins '57,

who did so from 1980-1983.
Quarterback Andrew Luck, last
season's Heisman Trophy runner
up and the early favorite to win the
award in 2011, spoke about Shaw's
hire as well.
"He's a Stanford man," Luck
said. "I've known that since he was
recruiting me coming out of high
school. He has a deep, abiding love
and respect for Stanford. You can
really tell that. He's going to do a
wonderful job with this program
and the players are behind him 100
percent."
Luck commented on the differ
ences in style between Harbaugh
and Shaw.
"He's definitely a lot different
than Coach Harbaugh in a lot of as
pects," he said. "It's just different
personalities and people go about
things differently. I wouldn't say
there's one right way to do it."
Shaw's appointment comes at a
critical time for Stanford, which will
host about 20 recruits on campus
this weekend. Shaw will also have to
work to keep Roman, Fangio and
other members of Harbaugh's staff,
some of whom have received inter
est from other schools and profes
sional teams. However, he chose not
to elaborate on Stanford's attempts
to retain those coaches and its
search to fill open assistant posi
tions, saying, "We'll talk about that
as the week goes on."

build a consistently strong program
at Stanford while embracing the
University's focus on academics.
"Two good years of football is
not enough," he said. "That's not
what we're aiming for. We're aiming
for consistency, for a team that's
going to make Stanford University
proud every time we step on the
field."
Athletic director Bob Bowlsby
said that he had serious discussions
with three external candidates
about Stanford's head coaching po
sition and contacted four other
coaches, but he declined to name
any of them.
"This is, in my estimation, the
most logical step that we can take,"
Bowlsby said at the press conference.
"[Shaw] is a proven recruiter. He's
got great college and NFL experi
ence. He understands and embraces
the athletic and academic merger at
Stanford University. His contribu
tion to the current state of affairs in
our football program is immeasura
ble, and he is a person of impeccable
character and integrity."
In Shaw, Stanford has found a
young coach with eight years of
NFL experience who is also likely to
be seriously dedicated to the Farm.
He is the 34th coach in the pro
gram's tenure, and no head man has
stayed for more than nine years.
"I went into the interview
process with the mindset that I
wanted this to be my last head
coaching interview ever," Shaw
said. Referring to the Stanford
women's basketball coach, he
added: "I want to be in the 25-and
up club thatTara VanDerveer is in."
Shaw began his coaching career
immediately after his graduation
from Stanford, heading first to
Western Washington before head
ing to the Philadelphia Eagles for
his first NFL job. He remained in
the professional ranks until he
joined Harbaugh's staff in San
Diego in 2006, then came to Stan
ford with Harbaugh the next year.
For his first three seasons with the
Cardinal, he operated as both the
wide receivers' coach and offensive
coordinator, but in 2010, while re
taining his coordinator title, he
switched his focus to running backs.
Now, he becomes the first Stan
ford alumnus to lead the Cardinal
program since Paul Wiggins '57,

who did so from 1980-1983.
Quarterback Andrew Luck, last
season's Heisman Trophy runner
up and the early favorite to win the
award in 2011, spoke about Shaw's
hire as well.
"He's a Stanford man," Luck
said. "I've known that since he was
recruiting me coming out of high
school. He has a deep, abiding love
and respect for Stanford. You can
really tell that. He's going to do a
wonderful job with this program
and the players are behind him 100
percent."
Luck commented on the differ
ences in style between Harbaugh
and Shaw.
"He's definitely a lot different
than Coach Harbaugh in a lot of as
pects," he said. "It's just different
personalities and people go about
things differently. I wouldn't say
there's one right way to do it."
Shaw's appointment comes at a
critical time for Stanford, which will
host about 20 recruits on campus
this weekend. Shaw will also have to
work to keep Roman, Fangio and
other members of Harbaugh's staff,
some of whom have received inter
est from other schools and profes
sional teams. However, he chose not
to elaborate on Stanford's attempts
to retain those coaches and its
search to fill open assistant posi
tions, saying, "We'll talk about that
as the week goes on."

left the Farm to coach the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL.
Stanford has named offensive
coordinator and running backs
coach David Shaw '95 the newest
head coach of the Cardinal football
program. Shaw was officially intro
duced at a press conference on
Thursday afternoon.
Shaw, who played wide receiver
for Stanford in the early 19905, takes
over the title of Bradford M. Free
man Director of Football from Jim
Harbaugh, who left the Farm for the
San Francisco 49ers after four sea
sons. Shaw served with Harbaugh
throughout his time at Stanford, as
well as at the University of San
Diego.
A favorite of players and alumni
alike, Shaw enters the top spot after
a coaching search that saw most of
its focus on in-house candidates, so
as to provide continuity with the
highly successful Harbaugh era.
Aside from Shaw, associate head
coach Greg Roman, defensive coor
dinator Vic Fangio and special
teams coordinator Brian Polian
were interviewed. Stanford had a
brief flirtation with Boise State's
Chris Petersen before he reaffirmed
his commitment to his current
school.
Shaw, 38, confirmed that he plans
to keep using the philosophy that
Harbaugh instilled during his
tenure, building a physical, running
team on offense and an aggressive,
hard-hitting defense. He said that he

was not willing to rest on the accom
plishments of last season, when the
Cardinal capped its first 12-win sea
son in history with a victory in the
Orange Bowl.
"Take the 2010 season out
standing, phenomenal. We're going
to put it in a box, we're going to put
a ribbon on it, we're going to put it
on the shelf for everybody to ad
mire," Shaw said. "But our goals are
not met. We're not done ... we have
a desire to be the first Pac-12 cham
pion."
Shaw also expressed his desire to
build a consistently strong program
at Stanford while embracing the
University's focus on academics.
"Two good years of football is
not enough," he said. "That's not
what we're aiming for. We're aiming
for consistency, for a team that's
going to make Stanford University
proud every time we step on the
