Stanford has named offensive
coordinator and running backs
coach David Shaw '95 the newest
head coach of the Cardinal football
program. Shaw was officially intro
duced at a press conference on
Thursday afternoon.
Shaw, who played wide receiver
for Stanford in the early 19905, takes
over the title of Bradford M. Free
man Director of Football from Jim
Harbaugh, who left the Farm for the
San Francisco 49ers after four sea
sons. Shaw served with Harbaugh
throughout his time at Stanford, as
well as at the University of San
Diego.
A favorite of players and alumni
alike, Shaw enters the top spot after
a coaching search that saw most of
its focus on in-house candidates, so
as to provide continuity with the
highly successful Harbaugh era.
Aside from Shaw, associate head
coach Greg Roman, defensive coor
dinator Vic Fangio and special
teams coordinator Brian Polian
were interviewed. Stanford had a
brief flirtation with Boise State's
Chris Petersen before he reaffirmed
his commitment to his current
school.
Shaw, 38, confirmed that he plans
to keep using the philosophy that
Harbaugh instilled during his
tenure, building a physical, running
team on offense and an aggressive,
hard-hitting defense. He said that he

was not willing to rest on the accom
plishments of last season, when the
Cardinal capped its first 12-win sea
son in history with a victory in the
Orange Bowl.
"Take the 2010 season out
standing, phenomenal. We're going
to put it in a box, we're going to put
a ribbon on it, we're going to put it
on the shelf for everybody to ad
mire," Shaw said. "But our goals are
not met. We're not done ... we have
a desire to be the first Pac-12 cham
pion."
Shaw also expressed his desire to
build a consistently strong program
at Stanford while embracing the
University's focus on academics.
"Two good years of football is
not enough," he said. "That's not
what we're aiming for. We're aiming
for consistency, for a team that's
going to make Stanford University
proud every time we step on the
field."
Athletic director Bob Bowlsby
said that he had serious discussions
with three external candidates
about Stanford's head coaching po
sition and contacted four other
coaches, but he declined to name
any of them.
"This is, in my estimation, the
most logical step that we can take,"
Bowlsby said at the press conference.
"[Shaw] is a proven recruiter. He's
got great college and NFL experi
ence. He understands and embraces
the athletic and academic merger at
