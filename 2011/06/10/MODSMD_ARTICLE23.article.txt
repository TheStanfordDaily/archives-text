## Card upsets UW in Maples thriller 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Josh Owens brought Maples
Pavilion back to its glory days on
Thursday night, tipping in a missed
Jeremy Green three-point attempt
with 29 seconds left as the Stanford
men's basketball team upset No. 17
Washington, 58-56, creating a
three-way tie in the loss column
atop the Pac-10 Conference.
"I just tried to make a play," Owens
said. "I personally thought the shot
was going in. I got good position on
my man and got a fortunate roll."
The Huskies (12-4, 4-1 Pac-10)
are the highest-ranked team de
feated by the Cardinal (10-5, 3-1)
in head coach Johnny Dawkins'
tenure.

"I thought it was a terrific
game," Dawkins said. "Both teams
came out and played with a lot of
heart. It was a defensive battle by
both teams and we were fortunate
in the end."
The Stanford defense was
staunch throughout, holding the
Huskies' scoring offense
ranked third in the nation coming
into the game to nearly 33
points below its season average.
The Cardinal forced 15 turnovers,
including two key blocks by Owens
in the final minutes, and made cru
cial stops down the stretch to close
what was once an 11-point Wash
ington lead.

When asked about the differ
ence in the game, junior guard
Green was quick to respond.
"Defense," he said. "That's why
we win games."
After a traveling violation by

Stanford freshman forward Dwight
Powell, the Huskies had a chance to
tie or win the game with 1.1 seconds
left. Washington found the hot
hand in senior forward Justin Holi
day, but his contested shot fell short
to seal the game for the Card.
The game didn't look promising
from the tip, as three minutes of
scoreless play to begin the game
were marred by sloppy play by
both squads. Stanford finally found
its rhythm, thanks in large part to
the effort of Owens, who led the
Cardinal with 14 points on 7-of-9
shooting.
The junior dominated the
Washington big men in the first
half with a series of baseline
jumpers and a soft touch around
the rim. He was also responsible
for a potential highlight of the year
a one-handed slam over seven
foot Washington center Aziz N'Di
aye that sent the crowd at Maples
Pavilion into a frenzy.
"To tell you the truth I didn't
think I was going to dunk it at
first," Owens said. "I beat my man
off the dribble and I just realized,
'Hey, why not try to finish strong,'
and just went up."
The Cardinal led by as many as
six points in the opening half, but
Washington hung tough behind
play from junior guard Isaiah
Thomas. The reigning Pac-10 Tour
nament Most Outstanding Player
left Stanford freshman Aaron
Bright befuddled and single-hand
edly kept his team in the game de
spite foul trouble for his star team
mate, junior forward Matthew
Bryan-Amaning.
Stanford led by three with just
seconds left in the half, but a
Thomas floater over the out
stretched arms of Cardinal fresh
man forward Dwight Powell at the
buzzer closed the gap to 29-28. De
spite losing most of its lead, the
Cardinal managed to keep the
Huskies' high-powered offense to
just 35.7 percent shooting.
Washington head coach Loren
zo Romar's half time adjustments
paid off immediately for his squad.
The Huskies, behind consecutive
threes from senior forward Justin
Holiday, began to pull away in the
first 10 minutes of the starting pe
riod, leading by as many as 11
points with 10:37 left on the clock.
However, the home team
wouldn't go down without a fight.
Down 51-41 with 8:55 remain
ing in the game, Stanford went on a

run of its own. Aggressive play by
Owens and junior guard Jarrett
Mann, coupled with freshman for
ward Anthony Brown's putback,
brought the Cardinal within a
point with 4:17 to go.
A three by Green gave Stan
ford its first lead since the 18:43
mark in the second half, and the
team never looked back.
With just 2.5 seconds left in the
game, Holiday had a chance to tie
the game with a pair of free throws.
He missed the front end, and de
spite the regaining of possession
by the Huskies, Stanford's defense
proved too suffocating.
"I think we did a great job on
every possession," Dawkins said.
"We really focused in on defense
and made it as difficult on them as
we could to make any baskets."
Despite one of the most memo
rable wins in recent history, Stan
ford has just one day to regroup.
The Cardinal is set to host Wash
ington State at 5 p.m. on Saturday.
