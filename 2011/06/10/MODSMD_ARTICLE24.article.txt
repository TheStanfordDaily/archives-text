# AD BREAKS EVEN ON ORANGE BOWL
## STANFORD RANKS IN MIDDLE OF BCS PACK 
### KABIR SAWHNEY ELLORA ISRANI 
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the football
team's recent trip to the Orange
Bowl, according to officials in the
department. The Daily was unable
to independently verify this figure,
as Athletics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other fi
nancial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the end
of the day, with all things being con
sidered, we'll break even," said
Brian Talbott, chief financial officer
for Stanford Athletics. "We broke
even at worst."
Officials within the University's
budget office, including University
CFO Randy Livingston, did not

comment on financial returns from
the Orange Bowl and directed all
inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Virginia
Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3 game, held
at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gar
dens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue from
its bowl trip through a payout from
the Pacific-10 Conference, which
pools bowl revenue from all of its
teams and distributes it to schools
to cover bowl-related expenses,
chiefly travel and tickets. Stanford
paid for transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and was
required to cover 7,500 tickets
out of an allotment of 17,500 from
the Orange Bowl that it was un
able to sell.

In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among teams
that participated in the Bowl Cham
pionship Series (BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last year's
Sun Bowl in El Paso,Texas, where it
lost to Oklahoma, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for any
bowl to break even on a strict
revenue and expense basis, in the
hope that the fact that you went to a
bowl creates those ancillary bene
fits," he said.
"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable to
profit directly from the Orange
Bowl,Talbott pointed out that play
ing in the game will bring the athlet

ics program a wide range of bene
fits, many of which are not quantifi
able now but could translate into fi
nancial gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that the
Pac-10 gets as a payout; we know
what it costs us that piece is
easy," he said. "What's a lot tougher
is quantifying the ancillary benefits:
how many more ticket sales we're
going to get this year than last year
because we went to the Orange
Bowl, how many more donations
are we going to get this year be
cause we went to the Orange Bowl,
how much better is our recruiting
going to be because we went to the
Orange Bowl."
Season ticket renewals for next
year are already up Talbott said
he expects to beat the 90 percent re
newal target "substantially" and
even though new ticket sales have
yet to open, Athletics has already
collected four times as many de
posits to date as it did for all of last
year.
"Even taking it a little further,
the more people who come to any
game for us, the more they're going
to have to pay to park, the more
they're going to buy concessions,
the more they're going to buy mer
chandise," Talbott said. "All of these
things trickle down."
The publicity from the game, es
pecially because it was the only
football game on during the 8 p.m.
EST timeslot, could also be benefi
cial in recruiting players and retain
ing coaches. He noted that while
coaching impacts are felt more im
mediately, the recruiting gains will
probably be seen in the 2012 class,
as this year's group had already
committed by February.
"Everybody was watching," Tal
bott said. "That gets recruits' eyes;
they say, 'Hey, I could be on TV if I
play for Stanford.' And it helps re
tain coaches to some extent, al
though it makes them more popular
too, so they could leave, but coaches
like to be part of a successful pro
gram."
Talbott also noted that the Uni
versity as a whole could reap finan
cial benefits from its football victo
ry, as donations could benefit from
the Orange Bowl being "a very pub
lic success."
"It should break even, from a
strict 'revenue and expense related
to the bowl itself perspective," he
said. "I find it hard to believe that
we won't see significant upside in
those secondary areas that will
make it well worthwhile over time,"
Sizing up the competition
Nine other universities partici
pated in last season's BCS, a set of
five marquee bowl games including
the national title game and the Or
ange Bowl. From a profit stand
point, Stanford was right in the mid
dle of the pack.
Unlike Stanford, which is a pri
vate institution, public universities
are required to disclose their
NCAA bowl expense reports upon
request due to open-records laws,
most notably the federal Freedom
of Information Act. For the eight
public schools that participated in
the BCS, The Daily was able to col
lect detailed financial information,
including figures for profit or loss.
Among those schools, only two
Ohio State and Wisconsin
made a significant profit, with the
Buckeyes earning $288,876 on their
trip to the Sugar Bowl and the Bad
gers receiving $79,168 from the
Rose Bowl. Two other teams, Okla
homa and Arkansas, were close to
break-even the Sooners earned
$9,350 from the Fiesta Bowl, and
the Razorbacks received $5,525
from the Sugar Bowl.
The remaining four schools took
significant financial hits. Most no
table was Connecticut, which lost
just under $l.B million on its Fiesta
Bowl trip. Virginia Tech, the Cardi
nal's opponent in the Orange Bowl,
lost $421,046. Both participants in
the BCS National Championship
Game, Auburn and Oregon, ended
in the red, with the Tigers paying
$614,106 and the Ducks losing
$312,437.

Records were not available for
the Rose Bowl's second participant,
Texas Christian University, because
it is a private institution.
It appeared that conference af
filiation was an important factor in
determining whether a team made
or lost money. Both Ohio State and
Wisconsin are members of the Big
Ten Conference, which generally
pays out more revenue to its mem
ber schools than other conferences.
For perspective, Ohio State re
ceived $2 million from its confer
ence for its bowl appearance, while
Virginia Tech received just $1,725
million from the Atlantic Coast
Conference (ACC).The Pac-10 also
appeared to be slightly more gener
ous, as Oregon received just under
$2.3 million with the caveat that
the Ducks played in the title game
and thus were expected to have
higher expenses as well.
The Daily also compared finan
cial returns from the two partici
pants in the 2010 Orange Bowl,
lowa and Georgia Tech. The
Hawkeyes made a $55,954 profit,
while the Yellow Jackets took a
$198,910 loss. However, the two
teams did have a large gap in rev
enue, with lowa getting $1.95 mil
lion from the Big Ten compared to
Georgia Tech's $1.6 million payout
from the ACC.
Flaws in the bowl system
Matt Sanderson, one of the co
founders of Playoff PAC, a political
committee whose goal is to estab
lish a playoff for college football,
discussed Stanford's bowl finances
and the flaws of the bowl system
in general â€”in an interview with
The Daily.
"It shows you how bizarre this
system is, that actually breaking
even on a bowl is considered a suc
cess story," he said.
Jeff Passan, a Yahoo! Sports
columnist and a co-author of the
book "Death to the BCS," added
that it was "surprising and not sur
prising" that Stanford broke even
on the Orange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien
tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse,
like Virginia Tech or Ohio State, ac
tually made it easier for Stanford to
break even.
"The difference between a
school that breaks even and one
that bleeds is conscientiousness," he
said. "Football rules Virginia Tech.
Everyone wants a part of it.. .
Rather than leave itself open to crit
icism for being like every other
school and overvaluing football,
Stanford's approach was pragmatic:
enjoy the experience, don't go over
board."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universi
ties to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the play
off."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a
certain number of tickets and cover
any unsold ones. Thus, bowls trans
fer the majority of financial respon
sibility onto the participating
schools and actually take very mini
mal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on
Stub Hub and get the same tickets
for a fourth of the price. The bowls
are pushing all the risk of not selling
tickets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer
day-of-game tickets for as little as
10 percent of face value, elucidates
more than anything what a terrible
deal bowls are for schools," Passan
said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Univer
sity administrators and one
major revenue source: a bowl pay
out.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying confer
ences, including the Pac-10, plus an
other $6 million if a conference
qualifies a second team for the
BCS. This season, both Stanford
and Oregon qualified for the BCS,
giving the Pac-10 a $27.2 million
payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received pay
outs from its other bowl teams, Ari
zona and Washington, which played
in the Alamo and Holiday bowls,
respectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.

"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we
participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among
all 10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten.

because they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket ob
ligation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as
well as three nights at the Renais
sance Eden Roc Miami Beach for
the band, according to Max Chang
'l3, director of public relations for
the LSJUMB. The University also
chartered a plane for about 130 of
the 180 band members and subsi
dized travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac
-10, significant differences existed
between the three other Pac-10
bowl teams. Due to its participation
in the BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Ari
zona lost $274,932 on the Alamo
Bowl, while Washington came out
slightly ahead on its Holiday Bowl
trip, with a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiv
alent expense allowances of
around $l.l million. However, the
Wildcats were forced to cover
$552,375 in unsold tickets, while
the Huskies only had to take
$102,130 in ticket losses, with those
figures coming after the Pac-10's
contributions to covering unsold
tickets. Oregon paid for $555,575
in unsold tickets on its way to a
$312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 million
expense allowance.

how much better is our recruiting
going to be because we went to the
Orange Bowl."
Season ticket renewals for next
year are already up Talbott said
he expects to beat the 90 percent re
newal target "substantially" and
even though new ticket sales have
yet to open, Athletics has already
collected four times as many de
posits to date as it did for all of last
year.
"Even taking it a little further,
the more people who come to any
game for us, the more they're going
to have to pay to park, the more
they're going to buy concessions,
the more they're going to buy mer
chandise," Talbott said. "All of these
things trickle down."
The publicity from the game, es
pecially because it was the only
football game on during the 8 p.m.
EST timeslot, could also be benefi
cial in recruiting players and retain
ing coaches. He noted that while
coaching impacts are felt more im
mediately, the recruiting gains will
probably be seen in the 2012 class,
as this year's group had already
committed by February.
"Everybody was watching," Tal
bott said. "That gets recruits' eyes;
they say, 'Hey, I could be on TV if I
play for Stanford.' And it helps re
tain coaches to some extent, al
though it makes them more popular
too, so they could leave, but coaches
like to be part of a successful pro
gram."
Talbott also noted that the Uni
versity as a whole could reap finan
cial benefits from its football victo
ry, as donations could benefit from
the Orange Bowl being "a very pub
lic success."
"It should break even, from a
strict 'revenue and expense related
to the bowl itself perspective," he
said. "I find it hard to believe that
we won't see significant upside in
those secondary areas that will
make it well worthwhile over time,"
Sizing up the competition
Nine other universities partici
pated in last season's BCS, a set of
five marquee bowl games including
the national title game and the Or
ange Bowl. From a profit stand
point, Stanford was right in the mid
dle of the pack.
Unlike Stanford, which is a pri
vate institution, public universities
are required to disclose their
NCAA bowl expense reports upon
request due to open-records laws,
most notably the federal Freedom
of Information Act. For the eight
public schools that participated in
the BCS, The Daily was able to col
lect detailed financial information,
including figures for profit or loss.
Among those schools, only two
Ohio State and Wisconsin
made a significant profit, with the
Buckeyes earning $288,876 on their
trip to the Sugar Bowl and the Bad
gers receiving $79,168 from the
Rose Bowl. Two other teams, Okla
homa and Arkansas, were close to
break-even the Sooners earned
$9,350 from the Fiesta Bowl, and
the Razorbacks received $5,525
from the Sugar Bowl.
The remaining four schools took
significant financial hits. Most no
table was Connecticut, which lost
just under $l.B million on its Fiesta
Bowl trip. Virginia Tech, the Cardi
nal's opponent in the Orange Bowl,
lost $421,046. Both participants in
the BCS National Championship
Game, Auburn and Oregon, ended
in the red, with the Tigers paying
$614,106 and the Ducks losing
$312,437.

Records were not available for
the Rose Bowl's second participant,
Texas Christian University, because
it is a private institution.
It appeared that conference af
filiation was an important factor in
determining whether a team made
or lost money. Both Ohio State and
Wisconsin are members of the Big
Ten Conference, which generally
pays out more revenue to its mem
ber schools than other conferences.
For perspective, Ohio State re
ceived $2 million from its confer
ence for its bowl appearance, while
Virginia Tech received just $1,725
million from the Atlantic Coast
Conference (ACC).The Pac-10 also
appeared to be slightly more gener
ous, as Oregon received just under
$2.3 million with the caveat that
the Ducks played in the title game
and thus were expected to have
higher expenses as well.
The Daily also compared finan
cial returns from the two partici
pants in the 2010 Orange Bowl,
lowa and Georgia Tech. The
Hawkeyes made a $55,954 profit,
while the Yellow Jackets took a
$198,910 loss. However, the two
teams did have a large gap in rev
enue, with lowa getting $1.95 mil
lion from the Big Ten compared to
Georgia Tech's $1.6 million payout
from the ACC.
Flaws in the bowl system
Matt Sanderson, one of the co
founders of Playoff PAC, a political
committee whose goal is to estab
lish a playoff for college football,
discussed Stanford's bowl finances
and the flaws of the bowl system
in general â€”in an interview with
The Daily.
"It shows you how bizarre this
system is, that actually breaking
even on a bowl is considered a suc
cess story," he said.
Jeff Passan, a Yahoo! Sports
columnist and a co-author of the
book "Death to the BCS," added
that it was "surprising and not sur
prising" that Stanford broke even
on the Orange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien
tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse,
like Virginia Tech or Ohio State, ac
tually made it easier for Stanford to
break even.
"The difference between a
school that breaks even and one
that bleeds is conscientiousness," he
said. "Football rules Virginia Tech.
Everyone wants a part of it.. .
Rather than leave itself open to crit
icism for being like every other
school and overvaluing football,
Stanford's approach was pragmatic:
enjoy the experience, don't go over
board."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universi
ties to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the play
off."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a
certain number of tickets and cover
any unsold ones. Thus, bowls trans
fer the majority of financial respon
sibility onto the participating
schools and actually take very mini
mal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on
Stub Hub and get the same tickets
for a fourth of the price. The bowls
are pushing all the risk of not selling
tickets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer
day-of-game tickets for as little as
10 percent of face value, elucidates
more than anything what a terrible
deal bowls are for schools," Passan
said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Univer
sity administrators and one
major revenue source: a bowl pay
out.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying confer
ences, including the Pac-10, plus an
other $6 million if a conference
qualifies a second team for the
BCS. This season, both Stanford
and Oregon qualified for the BCS,
giving the Pac-10 a $27.2 million
payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received pay
outs from its other bowl teams, Ari
zona and Washington, which played
in the Alamo and Holiday bowls,
respectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.

"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we
participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among
all 10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten.

because they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket ob
ligation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as
well as three nights at the Renais
sance Eden Roc Miami Beach for
the band, according to Max Chang
'l3, director of public relations for
the LSJUMB. The University also
chartered a plane for about 130 of
the 180 band members and subsi
dized travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac
-10, significant differences existed
between the three other Pac-10
bowl teams. Due to its participation
in the BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Ari
zona lost $274,932 on the Alamo
Bowl, while Washington came out
slightly ahead on its Holiday Bowl
trip, with a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiv
alent expense allowances of
around $l.l million. However, the
Wildcats were forced to cover
$552,375 in unsold tickets, while
the Huskies only had to take
$102,130 in ticket losses, with those
figures coming after the Pac-10's
contributions to covering unsold
tickets. Oregon paid for $555,575
in unsold tickets on its way to a
$312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 million
expense allowance.

AN ASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the football
team's recent trip to the Orange
Bowl, according to officials in the
department. The Daily was unable
to independently verify this figure,
as Athletics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other fi
nancial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the end
of the day, with all things being con
sidered, we'll break even," said
Brian Talbott, chief financial officer
for Stanford Athletics. "We broke
even at worst."
Officials within the University's
budget office, including University
CFO Randy Livingston, did not

comment on financial returns from
the Orange Bowl and directed all
inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Virginia
Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3 game, held
at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gar
dens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue from
its bowl trip through a payout from
the Pacific-10 Conference, which
pools bowl revenue from all of its
teams and distributes it to schools
to cover bowl-related expenses,
chiefly travel and tickets. Stanford
paid for transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and was
required to cover 7,500 tickets
out of an allotment of 17,500 from
the Orange Bowl that it was un
able to sell.

In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among teams
that participated in the Bowl Cham
pionship Series (BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last year's
Sun Bowl in El Paso,Texas, where it
lost to Oklahoma, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for any
bowl to break even on a strict
revenue and expense basis, in the
hope that the fact that you went to a
bowl creates those ancillary bene
fits," he said.
"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable to
profit directly from the Orange
Bowl,Talbott pointed out that play
ing in the game will bring the athlet

ics program a wide range of bene
fits, many of which are not quantifi
able now but could translate into fi
nancial gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that the
Pac-10 gets as a payout; we know
what it costs us that piece is
easy," he said. "What's a lot tougher
is quantifying the ancillary benefits:
how many more ticket sales we're
going to get this year than last year
because we went to the Orange
Bowl, how many more donations
are we going to get this year be
cause we went to the Orange Bowl,
how much better is our recruiting
going to be because we went to the
Orange Bowl."

Buckeyes earning $288,876 on their
trip to the Sugar Bowl and the Bad
gers receiving $79,168 from the
Rose Bowl. Two other teams, Okla
homa and Arkansas, were close to
break-even the Sooners earned
$9,350 from the Fiesta Bowl, and
the Razorbacks received $5,525
from the Sugar Bowl.
The remaining four schools took
significant financial hits. Most no
table was Connecticut, which lost
just under $l.B million on its Fiesta
Bowl trip. Virginia Tech, the Cardi
nal's opponent in the Orange Bowl,
lost $421,046. Both participants in
the BCS National Championship
Game, Auburn and Oregon, ended
in the red, with the Tigers paying
$614,106 and the Ducks losing
$312,437.

Records were not available for
the Rose Bowl's second participant,
Texas Christian University, because
it is a private institution.
It appeared that conference af
filiation was an important factor in
determining whether a team made
or lost money. Both Ohio State and
Wisconsin are members of the Big
Ten Conference, which generally
pays out more revenue to its mem
ber schools than other conferences.
For perspective, Ohio State re
ceived $2 million from its confer
ence for its bowl appearance, while
Virginia Tech received just $1,725
million from the Atlantic Coast
Conference (ACC).The Pac-10 also
appeared to be slightly more gener
ous, as Oregon received just under
$2.3 million with the caveat that
the Ducks played in the title game
and thus were expected to have
higher expenses as well.
The Daily also compared finan
cial returns from the two partici
pants in the 2010 Orange Bowl,
lowa and Georgia Tech. The
Hawkeyes made a $55,954 profit,
while the Yellow Jackets took a
$198,910 loss. However, the two
teams did have a large gap in rev
enue, with lowa getting $1.95 mil
lion from the Big Ten compared to
Georgia Tech's $1.6 million payout
from the ACC.
Flaws in the bowl system
Matt Sanderson, one of the co
founders of Playoff PAC, a political
committee whose goal is to estab
lish a playoff for college football,
discussed Stanford's bowl finances
and the flaws of the bowl system
in general â€”in an interview with
The Daily.
"It shows you how bizarre this
system is, that actually breaking
even on a bowl is considered a suc
cess story," he said.
Jeff Passan, a Yahoo! Sports
columnist and a co-author of the
book "Death to the BCS," added
that it was "surprising and not sur
prising" that Stanford broke even
on the Orange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien
tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse,
like Virginia Tech or Ohio State, ac
tually made it easier for Stanford to
break even.
"The difference between a
school that breaks even and one
that bleeds is conscientiousness," he
said. "Football rules Virginia Tech.
Everyone wants a part of it.. .
Rather than leave itself open to crit
icism for being like every other
school and overvaluing football,
Stanford's approach was pragmatic:
enjoy the experience, don't go over
board."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universi
ties to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the play
off."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a
certain number of tickets and cover
any unsold ones. Thus, bowls trans
fer the majority of financial respon
sibility onto the participating
schools and actually take very mini
mal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on
Stub Hub and get the same tickets
for a fourth of the price. The bowls
are pushing all the risk of not selling
tickets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne


ANASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer
day-of-game tickets for as little as
10 percent of face value, elucidates
more than anything what a terrible
deal bowls are for schools," Passan
said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Univer
sity administrators and one
major revenue source: a bowl pay
out.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying confer
ences, including the Pac-10, plus an
other $6 million if a conference
qualifies a second team for the
BCS. This season, both Stanford
and Oregon qualified for the BCS,
giving the Pac-10 a $27.2 million
payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received pay
outs from its other bowl teams, Ari
zona and Washington, which played
in the Alamo and Holiday bowls,
respectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.

"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we
participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among
all 10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten.

because they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket ob
ligation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as
well as three nights at the Renais
sance Eden Roc Miami Beach for
the band, according to Max Chang
'l3, director of public relations for
the LSJUMB. The University also
chartered a plane for about 130 of
the 180 band members and subsi
dized travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac
-10, significant differences existed
between the three other Pac-10
bowl teams. Due to its participation
in the BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Ari
zona lost $274,932 on the Alamo
Bowl, while Washington came out
slightly ahead on its Holiday Bowl
trip, with a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiv
alent expense allowances of
around $l.l million. However, the
Wildcats were forced to cover
$552,375 in unsold tickets, while
the Huskies only had to take
$102,130 in ticket losses, with those
figures coming after the Pac-10's
contributions to covering unsold
tickets. Oregon paid for $555,575
in unsold tickets on its way to a
$312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 million
expense allowance.

AN ASTASIA YEE/The Stanford Daily
Stanford Athletics received
"zero" net income from the football
team's recent trip to the Orange
Bowl, according to officials in the
department. The Daily was unable
to independently verify this figure,
as Athletics declined to provide its
NCAA expense report or other fi
nancial documentation.
"I would say roughly, at the end
of the day, with all things being con
sidered, we'll break even," said
Brian Talbott, chief financial officer
for Stanford Athletics. "We broke
even at worst."
Officials within the University's
budget office, including University
CFO Randy Livingston, did not

comment on financial returns from
the Orange Bowl and directed all
inquiries to Talbott.
The Cardinal defeated Virginia
Tech, 40-12, in the Jan. 3 game, held
at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gar
dens, Fla.
Stanford earned revenue from
its bowl trip through a payout from
the Pacific-10 Conference, which
pools bowl revenue from all of its
teams and distributes it to schools
to cover bowl-related expenses,
chiefly travel and tickets. Stanford
paid for transportation, lodging and
meals for the team, the band and
University administrators and was
required to cover 7,500 tickets
out of an allotment of 17,500 from
the Orange Bowl that it was un
able to sell.

In terms of profit, Stanford
ranked in the middle among teams
that participated in the Bowl Cham
pionship Series (BCS).
Talbott added that Stanford
broke even on its trip to last year's
Sun Bowl in El Paso,Texas, where it
lost to Oklahoma, 31-27.
"That would be my goal for any
bowl to break even on a strict
revenue and expense basis, in the
hope that the fact that you went to a
bowl creates those ancillary bene
fits," he said.
"Ancillary benefits"
Though Stanford was unable to
profit directly from the Orange
Bowl,Talbott pointed out that play
ing in the game will bring the athlet

ics program a wide range of bene
fits, many of which are not quantifi
able now but could translate into fi
nancial gains in the long term.
"We know the numbers that the
Pac-10 gets as a payout; we know
what it costs us that piece is
easy," he said. "What's a lot tougher
is quantifying the ancillary benefits:
how many more ticket sales we're
going to get this year than last year
because we went to the Orange
Bowl, how many more donations
are we going to get this year be
cause we went to the Orange Bowl,
how much better is our recruiting
going to be because we went to the
Orange Bowl."
Season ticket renewals for next
year are already up Talbott said
he expects to beat the 90 percent re
newal target "substantially" and
even though new ticket sales have
yet to open, Athletics has already
collected four times as many de
posits to date as it did for all of last
year.
"Even taking it a little further,
the more people who come to any
game for us, the more they're going
to have to pay to park, the more
they're going to buy concessions,
the more they're going to buy mer
chandise," Talbott said. "All of these
things trickle down."
The publicity from the game, es
pecially because it was the only
football game on during the 8 p.m.
EST timeslot, could also be benefi
cial in recruiting players and retain
ing coaches. He noted that while
coaching impacts are felt more im
mediately, the recruiting gains will
probably be seen in the 2012 class,
as this year's group had already
committed by February.
"Everybody was watching," Tal
bott said. "That gets recruits' eyes;
they say, 'Hey, I could be on TV if I
play for Stanford.' And it helps re
tain coaches to some extent, al
though it makes them more popular
too, so they could leave, but coaches
like to be part of a successful pro
gram."
Talbott also noted that the Uni
versity as a whole could reap finan
cial benefits from its football victo
ry, as donations could benefit from
the Orange Bowl being "a very pub
lic success."
"It should break even, from a
strict 'revenue and expense related
to the bowl itself perspective," he
said. "I find it hard to believe that
we won't see significant upside in
those secondary areas that will
make it well worthwhile over time,"
Sizing up the competition
Nine other universities partici
pated in last season's BCS, a set of
five marquee bowl games including
the national title game and the Or
ange Bowl. From a profit stand
point, Stanford was right in the mid
dle of the pack.
Unlike Stanford, which is a pri
vate institution, public universities
are required to disclose their
NCAA bowl expense reports upon
request due to open-records laws,
most notably the federal Freedom
of Information Act. For the eight
public schools that participated in
the BCS, The Daily was able to col
lect detailed financial information,
including figures for profit or loss.
Among those schools, only two
Ohio State and Wisconsin
made a significant profit, with the
Buckeyes earning $288,876 on their
trip to the Sugar Bowl and the Bad

book "Death to the BCS," added
that it was "surprising and not sur
prising" that Stanford broke even
on the Orange Bowl.
"Surprising, sure, because its
peers in BCS-level bowl games al
most all took massive baths," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It's
not surprising because the Stanford
athletic department always has
struck me as being more conscien
tious than most."
Passan also said that not being a
traditional football powerhouse,
like Virginia Tech or Ohio State, ac
tually made it easier for Stanford to
break even.
"The difference between a
school that breaks even and one
that bleeds is conscientiousness," he
said. "Football rules Virginia Tech.
Everyone wants a part of it.. .
Rather than leave itself open to crit
icism for being like every other
school and overvaluing football,
Stanford's approach was pragmatic:
enjoy the experience, don't go over
board."
Sanderson said that the bowl sys
tem, and the BCS in particular, is set
up to make it difficult for universi
ties to make profits.
"There's a lot more revenue that
college football's decision-makers
are leaving on the table," he said. "If
we were to move to a playoff, a lot
more revenue would be available to
participating schools and to schools
that don't participate in the play
off."
Much of the blame for the distor
tions in the bowl system is placed on
ticket guarantees, where participat
ing schools are required to sell a
certain number of tickets and cover
any unsold ones. Thus, bowls trans
fer the majority of financial respon
sibility onto the participating
schools and actually take very mini
mal risk.
"The bowls are foisting blocks of
overpriced tickets on schools,"
Sanderson said. "Fans can hop on
Stub Hub and get the same tickets
for a fourth of the price. The bowls
are pushing all the risk of not selling
tickets off onto the schools."
"The false market created by ne

cessitating universities and confer
ences to purchase tens of thousands
of tickets at full price, when ticket
brokers and resale services offer
day-of-game tickets for as little as
10 percent of face value, elucidates
more than anything what a terrible
deal bowls are for schools," Passan
said.
The money trail: from bowls to con
ferences to schools
Stanford's zero profit estimate is
based on a number of expenses
most substantial among them are
unsold tickets and travel expenses
for the team, the band and Univer
sity administrators and one
major revenue source: a bowl pay
out.
According to the BCS media
guide, supplied by the Orange Bowl
Committee to The Daily, the BCS
pays out $21.2 million to each of the
six automatic qualifying confer
ences, including the Pac-10, plus an
other $6 million if a conference
qualifies a second team for the
BCS. This season, both Stanford
and Oregon qualified for the BCS,
giving the Pac-10 a $27.2 million
payout in total.
The Pac-10 also received pay
outs from its other bowl teams, Ari
zona and Washington, which played
in the Alamo and Holiday bowls,
respectively. The conference pools
these payouts to cover travel and
unsold ticket expenses for each par
ticipating team and then divides the
remainder equally among all 10
conference teams, regardless of
their involvement in a bowl.

"Basically what happens is all of
our bowl revenue is brought into
one pot from every bowl game we
participated in this year, from the
Championship Game, roughly $l7
million from that, $6 million from
the Orange Bowl and then there's
the other bowl games: the Alamo
Bowl and the Holiday Bowl," said
Kirk Reynolds, vice president of
public affairs for the Pac-10. "Those
revenues all come into one pot,
minus the expenses from each, and
then the rest is distributed among
all 10 institutions."
"Stanford would have gotten.

because they played in a BCS game,
$1.4 million plus change, and then
travel expenses for 600 people," he
said.
However, it seems the bulk of
that went this year to covering trav
el and tickets. Stanford had an obli
gation to sell 17,500 tickets to the
Orange Bowl but only managed to
sell about 10,000, a figure given by
Talbott and corroborated by
Reynolds.
"We did not meet the ticket ob
ligation," Talbott said. "We sold or
used about 10,000 tickets and our
obligation was about 17,500, but
part of the payout from the bowl to
Pac-10 is used to help offset some of
those ticket that we weren't able to
sell, so at the end of the day, we
won't have to eat 7,500 tickets."
The payout from the Pac-10 also
helped cover Stanford's travel ex
penses, which included an eight
night stay for the team at the
Fontainebleau Miami Beach as
well as three nights at the Renais
sance Eden Roc Miami Beach for
the band, according to Max Chang
'l3, director of public relations for
the LSJUMB. The University also
chartered a plane for about 130 of
the 180 band members and subsi
dized travel for the rest.
Despite the pooling of both risk
and revenue achieved by the Pac
-10, significant differences existed
between the three other Pac-10
bowl teams. Due to its participation
in the BCS National Championship
Game, Oregon received a much
higher expense allowance and had
much higher expenses than the
other two schools. NCAA bowl ex
pense reports revealed that Ari
zona lost $274,932 on the Alamo
Bowl, while Washington came out
slightly ahead on its Holiday Bowl
trip, with a $3,796 profit.
Both teams had roughly equiv
alent expense allowances of
around $l.l million. However, the
Wildcats were forced to cover
$552,375 in unsold tickets, while
the Huskies only had to take
$102,130 in ticket losses, with those
figures coming after the Pac-10's
contributions to covering unsold
tickets. Oregon paid for $555,575
in unsold tickets on its way to a
$312,437 loss, out of a $2.2 million
expense allowance.
