## Tablo battles attacks on Stanford record 
### KATE ABBOTT WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Daniel Seon Woong Lee, better
known in Korea as recording artist
Tablo, graduated from Stanford
with a seemingly uncontroversial
record: two English degrees, a bach
elor's in 2001 and a master's in 2002.
But over the past six months, an In
ternet campaign has launched at
tacking Lee's credentials and, he
says, threatening him and his family.
Lee, the frontman of premier Ko
rean rap group Epik High, became
aware of the allegations that he was
not a Stanford graduate in March,
when he began receiving threats to
his Twitter account. The sources of
the attacks were netizens vocal
participants in an online community
who question the validity of
Lee's Stanford degrees. An inter
vention from Stanford Registrar
Tom Black and a letter from English
professor Tobias Wolff did little to
help stop the movement.
"Initially, we treated this as a rou
tine check," Black said. "But Lee is a
moving target. Lee had an A aver
age, and that's the kind of thing they
would stretch. Exaggerations get
made when something like this goes
viral."

The campaign to discredit Lee's
degrees exploded. One of the largest
antagonists, the netizen group "We
Urge Tablo to Tell the Truth,"
formed in May and now has more

than 131,000 members, according to
Korean journalist So-young Sung.
The allegations range widely that
Lee has exaggerated his grade point
average and that he claims he was
best friends with Reese Wither
spoon when she attended Stanford,
for example.
"The Internet rumor was that my
entire Stanford experience and all
of my credentials are fraudulent,"
Lee wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Over time, this allegation spawned
many others that my entire fami
ly is a fraud, that I've stolen and
lived someone else's identity, et
cetera and has escalated to the
point where my entire existence is
being questioned. Some of the alle
gations are even based on fabrica
tions of what I've said or done ...
it's all very confusing."
Black said verifying a person's
degree from the University is not an
unusual practice, but he has never
seen a case this severe. Black re
leased a copy of Lee's transcript,
and when that did not prove satis
factory, he wrote a letter vouching
for Lee's attendance and gradua
tion. Recently, Black allowed cam
era crews to film him printing a de
gree to show that none of the
process is fraudulent.
"I've tried to put all the resources
that are permissible into this," Black
said, "because only I can officially

k
attest to his completion."
Black believes people are dis
puting the evidence because "they
couldn't absorb it."
"I think they assume someone
would put his education to better
use," he added.
"My full transcript and Stan
ford's official verifications have
been on the net since June," Lee
said. "I've tried to get the truth
across, but it's been strangely diffi
cult to do so, and anybody who has
tried to help me has been attacked
in similar ways."
Since Lee's transcript was posted
online, it has been viewed more
than 16,000 times, according to
Black.
During his time at Stanford, Lee
staffed in Okada as an ethnic theme
associate from 2000 to 2001 and
worked at the CoHo, where he also
performed music.
Nadinne Cruz, the Okada resi
dent fellow during Lee's time on
campus, remembers him as "very
polite and cooperative" and "a seri
ous student of literature."
She described him as a quiet soul
with an interest in playwriting. His
career choice was surprising to her,
given his subdued personality and
professed love for classical texts.
"We had conversations about
the state of the world and the
human condition," Cruz said. "We
talked about identity. He was a Ko
rean from Canada studying in
America. He lived in many different
worlds."
Lee pursued these questions
through writing and published a
book in 2008 "Pieces of You"
composed entirely of stories written
during his time in college. General
ly, Lee has not shied away from his
Stanford experiences, speaking of
them often in public appearances.
Sung, who writes for the Joon
gAng Daily and has followed the
diploma story, said Korean enter
tainment agencies often market
celebrities' academic backgrounds.
Lee's tendency to discuss earning
both of his degrees in four years
through the English co-term pro
gram doesn't seem plausible to
many Koreans, Sung said.
Lee is not the first celebrity to be
targeted by viral campaigns. Two
Korean entertainers "killed them
selves because of malicious com
ments posted by some netizens,"
Sung wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily, referring to Choi Jin-sil in
2008 and Uni in 2007.
"This Tablo case is very closely
associated with Korea's deep-root
ed culture of judging someone by
their educational background,"
Sung added. "I think Tablo men
tioned Stanford quite frequently
whenever he appeared in TV shows
... and that made some netizens
jealous of him."
The accusers' obsession is so
strong that Sung received a litany of
aggressive e-mails and phone calls
after conducting an interview with
Lee that some readers viewed as too
"cooperative."

There appears to be little, if any
thing, that will placate Lee's attack
ers. He and the netizens have taken
legal action against one another, but
Lee acknowledged that discovering
the "truth" might not play any part
in his accusers' motives.
"Some have expressed that they
want me, and my family, to disap
pear," Lee said. "To a degree, they
may have already achieved what
they want."

"I actually talked to one of those
netizens and he didn't even know
Tablo received an electronic tran
script from Stanford," Sung said.
"Nothing will satisfy them. I think
they just want to believe what they
want to believe."
Black said that he does not think
the netizens will stop asking ques
tions. He has stopped responding to
e-mails concerning Lee.
"It's all just rumor and innuen
do," Black said. "It's not truth
they're after. It's just to ruin his life."
Lee maintains that he is not
angry and even waited several
months before pursuing legal ac
tion. He hopes a documentary air
ing this weekend in Korea ("Tablo
Goes to Stanford," on Korean net
work MBC) will vindicate his repu
tation.
"I ask that you don't develop the
impression that what is happening
to me is in any way a reflection of
my homeland," he said. "Korea has
been host to some of the most beau
tiful moments of my life. The event
discussed here only reflects the pos
sible downside of social media any
where."
But a cultural divide still seems
to remain.
"We think about global citizens,"
Black said, "but sometimes the rest
of the world isn't ready for them."
