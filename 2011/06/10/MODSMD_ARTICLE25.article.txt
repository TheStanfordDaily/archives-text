## Tablo battles attacks on Stanford record 
### KATE ABBOTT WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Daniel Seon Woong Lee, better
known in Korea as recording artist
Tablo, graduated from Stanford
with a seemingly uncontroversial
record: two English degrees, a bach
elor's in 2001 and a master's in 2002.
But over the past six months, an In
ternet campaign has launched at
tacking Lee's credentials and, he
says, threatening him and his family.
Lee, the frontman of premier Ko
rean rap group Epik High, became
aware of the allegations that he was
not a Stanford graduate in March,
when he began receiving threats to
his Twitter account. The sources of
the attacks were netizens vocal
participants in an online community
who question the validity of
Lee's Stanford degrees. An inter
vention from Stanford Registrar
Tom Black and a letter from English
professor Tobias Wolff did little to
help stop the movement.
"Initially, we treated this as a rou
tine check," Black said. "But Lee is a
moving target. Lee had an A aver
age, and that's the kind of thing they
would stretch. Exaggerations get
made when something like this goes
viral."

The campaign to discredit Lee's
degrees exploded. One of the largest
antagonists, the netizen group "We
Urge Tablo to Tell the Truth,"
formed in May and now has more

than 131,000 members, according to
Korean journalist So-young Sung.
The allegations range widely that
Lee has exaggerated his grade point
average and that he claims he was
best friends with Reese Wither
spoon when she attended Stanford,
for example.
"The Internet rumor was that my
entire Stanford experience and all
of my credentials are fraudulent,"
Lee wrote in an e-mail to The Daily.
"Over time, this allegation spawned
many others that my entire fami
ly is a fraud, that I've stolen and
lived someone else's identity, et
cetera and has escalated to the
point where my entire existence is
being questioned. Some of the alle
gations are even based on fabrica
tions of what I've said or done ...
it's all very confusing."
Black said verifying a person's
degree from the University is not an
unusual practice, but he has never
seen a case this severe. Black re
leased a copy of Lee's transcript,
and when that did not prove satis
factory, he wrote a letter vouching
for Lee's attendance and gradua
tion. Recently, Black allowed cam
era crews to film him printing a de
gree to show that none of the
process is fraudulent.
"I've tried to put all the resources
that are permissible into this," Black
said, "because only I can officially
