## The
						Forgotten Social Network 
### BILLY GALLAGHER 
Silicon Valley's Sun Mi
crosystems, Cisco,
Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo,
Google and Facebook are
some of the largest tech
nology companies in the world. Stan
ford alumni founded the first five.
But if things had turned out a bit dif
ferently in the fall of 1999, would we
have been able to attribute the cre
ation of Facebook to Stanford as
well?
It was in 1999 that three Stanford
seniors, Tuyen Truong 'OO, Lawrence
Gentilello 'OO and Aaron Bell 'OO
founded their start-up Steamtun
nels.net, a social networking website
that paired information from the
1999 version of Stanford Who, called
Whols, with the photos in Stanford's
printed Facebook. Steamtunnels is
seen by some as a separate but early
form of the Facebook that exists
today.
In addition to the Facebook com
ponent, Steamtunnels also featured
a restaurant guide, events calendar,
bulletin board, online radio stations,
a textbook price comparison feature
and maps of Stanford's physical
steam tunnels on campus, the
founders said in a recent interview
with The Daily.
"We were always thinking of
ways to liven up the scene here,"
Truong said of the then-seniors' de
sire to enhance the social life for stu
dents.
Bell and Gentilello met during
their freshman year as residents in
Branner, which was an all-freshman
dorm at the time, known affection
ately as a boisterous "freshman man
sion." All three later joined Theta
Delta Chi.
Their last years of college coin
cided with the dot-com explosion.
"There was some ridiculous num
ber like eight legitimate startups and
$5O million raised in venture capital
in Theta Delt during the three years
that we were there," Gentilello said.
The trio was inspired to put the
printed Facebook in an online for
mat because students and fraterni
ties asked to borrow the trio's copies
so frequently.
Bell, a computer science major
who began working at Microsoft
when he was 15 years old, did most of
the programming for the site, which
he said was difficult without open
source code.
Truong posted students' photos
on the site by scanning the print
Stanford Facebooks in Meyer Li
brary, where he was supposed to be
working on his honors thesis in biol
ogy-
They never had a single, official
launch, as the trio first spread word
of the site on an e-mail list they sent
to friends about bar nights and social

events. So the website already had
users before freshmen arrived in the
fall.
Gentilello recalled the trio's early
plans for expansion.
"Our vision for Steamtunnels,
when we started it, was to expand it
to colleges across the country," Gen
tilello said.
They configured the site to re
strict access to only those with an IP
address on campus and a Stanford e
mail address. They also had a feature
on the site where users could accept
or deny the posting of their photo.
"We thought, 'How awesome
would it be if you met a John at a
party and go on and type in John and
find every John, Jonathan, Johnny,
and their info, what dorm they're in,
what classes they're taking?'"
Truong said.
As the site's "About Us" page
stated in 1999,"Let's face it, the Face
book is an integral part of Stanford's
social structure: you poured over it
freshman year getting to know your
class, and now it remains a desktop
reference more cherished and
abused than your Webster's Dictio
nary ... we put the Facebook on
line."
However, only a week after the
release of the beta version of the site,
the trio said the University pushed
for Steamtunnels to shut down, cit
ing potential Honor Code violations
and removing Gentilello and Truong
from academic advising positions.
They recalled a meeting with admin
istrators who confronted them about
shutting the site down.
"We were like'Woah, woah, these
pictures are public. Every student on
campus has these," Truong said.
"They really scared us," Gentilel
lo said, adding: "We weren't pre
pared to be kicked out of school for
this, so we folded."
Nadira Hira 'O2, who wrote the
original articles about Steamtunnels
for The Daily and now writes for
Fortune magazine, believes that the
success of Steamtunnels was hin
dered by its timing.
"I think the fact that it was so
ahead of its time put the administra
tion on the defensive," she said. "I
don't think that was a function of
them trying to stifle innovation. I
think they just were not prepared for
something like this to happen just
yet."
In an e-mail to The Daily, Marc
Wais, who was dean of students at
the time, defended the administra
tion's actions.
"In my meetings with students
that I can recall, everyone acted in a
polite, professional and respectful
fashion. At the end of the day,
though, I realize that the students
were not happy that we were asking
