# STANFORD CAPTURES ORANGE BOWL VICTORY
## The 						No. 4 Cardinal dominates Virginia Tech to cap off best season in football programs history 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The greatest season in Stanford
football history is complete.
The Cardinal capped its his
toric run with a 40-12 dismantling
of No. 13 Virginia Tech (11-3, 8-0
ACC) in last night's Discover Or
ange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla.
No. 4 Stanford (12-1, 8-1 Pac-10)
will finish the season with the most
wins in program history, a far cry
from its 1-11 record in 2006.
"Very few times in life does

anybody get a chance to be a
champion at something and be an
Orange Bowl champion," Stan
ford head coach Jim Harbaugh
said. "That's going to down in the
history of college football. We
started the season wanting to be
champions."
Stanford won the game in the
second half, when it outplayed the
Hokies on both sides of the ball.
Entering the locker room at half
time, the score stood at 13-12 in
favor of Stanford, and the game
looked destined for a close finish.

However, the Cardinal began to
pull away with its first drive of the
second half, when it scored on a
one-yard touchdown run from
senior fullback/linebacker Owen
Marecic, and never looked back.
"The second half had a point
explosion," Harbaugh said. "There
were no mistakes from there on
out, from halftime until the end of
the game. Everybody was just on
point and executed extremely
well."
"We just went back to the fun
damentals," said redshirt junior

tight end Coby Fleener. "We kept
plugging away and we started to
make some plays."
The offensive highlight of Stan
ford's second half was a drive with
around six minutes left in the third
quarter. After junior safety De
lano Howell intercepted a pass
from Virginia Tech quarterback
Tyrod Taylor on the Stanford
three-yard line, Stanford's offense
went 97 yards down the field for a
touchdown in exactly two plays
and 29 seconds. Sophomore run
ning back Stepfan Taylor, the

team's leading rusher, broke a 56-
yard run from the three-yard line
on the drive's first play, and red
shirt sophomore quarterback
Luck threw a deep 41-yard bomb
to a wide-open Fleener in the cen
ter of the field for a touchdown.
The score put Stanford up, 26-12,
and put all the momentum square
ly on the Cardinal sideline.
"I thought it was huge," Luck
said, speaking about the drive.
"Any time backed up in your own
end zone as an offense, you've got
a little bit of the hairs on the back
of your neck standing up because
you know how precarious that po
sition can be. And to go from one
end zone to the other end zone in
two plays, it's huge."
Luck, who won the Orange
Bowl MVP award, finished with
287 yards and four touchdowns on
18-of-23 passing. Fleener was by
far his favorite target for the game;
Luck found him for six receptions,
173 yards and three touchdown
catches. The tight ends as a unit
were huge for Stanford as they
comprised three of Luck's top five
targets.

Stanford's running game was
also instrumental in winning the
Orange Bowl. The Cardinal
amassed 247 yards on the ground,
including 118 yards from Stepfan
Taylor and another 99 yards from
senior Jeremy Stewart, who had
been sidelined for much of the sea
son by an injury sustained in Stan
ford's opener. The Cardinal offen
sive line opened up big holes for its
running backs, leading to several
long runs.
"I think the O-line plays with a
lot of pride," Luck said. "They sort
of kept at it, chipped away, kept
grinding and holes really started
opening up."
As the offense rolled up points
in the second half, the defense did
an impressive job of containing

The Stanford football team celebrates an emphatic win over Virginia Tech in the 2011 Orange Bowl. The Cardinal finished the season 12-1, a far
cry from its 1-11 season in 2006. The game marked the final time that Jim Harbaugh would take the field as head coach of the reborn program.
Tyrod Taylor, the ACC offensive
player of the year. Throughout the
game, but especially in the second
half, the defense dominated the line
of scrimmage it seemed like
Tyrod Taylor had Cardinal blitzers
in his face on almost every play.
Stanford successfully limited his
running ability, forcing him to
scramble in the backfield and make
tough throws. For the game, Stan
ford sacked Tyrod Taylor eight
times, including three from sopho
more linebacker Shayne Skov.
"We knew Tyrod would try to
extend plays with his legs so if guys
were missing [tackles] we knew
guys would have to be there to
cover him," Skov said. "We just had
to swarm to the ball and play well
on defense."
"We were trying to cage him in,
we really were," Harbaugh said.
"Sometimes it worked, sometimes it
didn't. He is such an elusive player."
Overall, Stanford limited the
Hokies to 288 offensive yards, in
cluding just 66 rushing yards. It also
forced Virginia Tech into eight
punts, compared to three from the
Cardinal.
For Virginia Tech, the loss
marked a disappointing end to the
season. The Hokies went undefeat
ed in the ACC after losing its first
two games of the season.
"It was frustrating," Tyrod Tay
lor said. "But you've got to bounce
back and look forward. [Stanford]

just outplayed us in all parts of the
game today."
After the game, the conversa
tion turned to the future of Har
baugh and Luck at Stanford. Har
baugh could bolt the Farm in the
coming weeks for a more high pro
file coaching job, either with an
NFL team or at the University of
Michigan, and some analysts be
lieve that his departure is immi
nent. Stanford has indicated it of
fered Harbaugh a raise from his
current salary.
Meanwhile, Luck is eligible to
declare for the NFL Draft as a red
shirt sophomore, and is currently
projected as the No. 1 overall pick
by several scouting services, includ
ing ESPN.
Both declined to comment after
the game on whether or not they
plan to remain at Stanford for next
season.
"I don't mean to be rude, but I'd
rather not address that subject any
more," Luck said when asked a sim
ilar question later.
For now, Flarbaugh, Luck and
the rest of the Stanford football
team will just savor this victory, and
reflect on what it means for the pro
gram.
"We're going to enjoy this mo
ment and these players that have
really created a bond, a brother
hood," Harbaugh said. "They really
love to play, they love to win, they
love playing for each other. I think
even more so than they love playing
the game, they like playing for each
other and winning for each other."

Shayne Skov, No. 11, led a Stanford defense that held Virginia Tech and
quarterback Tyrod Taylor, left, to a mere 12 points. The Cardinal held a potent
Hokies rushing attack to just 66 yards on the ground on the day.
