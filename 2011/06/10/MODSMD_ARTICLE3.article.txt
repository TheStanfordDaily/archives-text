# STANFORD CAPTURES ORANGE BOWL VICTORY
## The
						No. 4 Cardinal dominates Virginia Tech to cap off best season in football programs history 
### KABIR SAWHNEY MANAGING EDITOR 
The greatest season in Stanford
football history is complete.
The Cardinal capped its his
toric run with a 40-12 dismantling
of No. 13 Virginia Tech (11-3, 8-0
ACC) in last night's Discover Or
ange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Fla.
No. 4 Stanford (12-1, 8-1 Pac-10)
will finish the season with the most
wins in program history, a far cry
from its 1-11 record in 2006.
"Very few times in life does

anybody get a chance to be a
champion at something and be an
Orange Bowl champion," Stan
ford head coach Jim Harbaugh
said. "That's going to down in the
history of college football. We
started the season wanting to be
champions."
Stanford won the game in the
second half, when it outplayed the
Hokies on both sides of the ball.
Entering the locker room at half
time, the score stood at 13-12 in
favor of Stanford, and the game
looked destined for a close finish.

However, the Cardinal began to
pull away with its first drive of the
second half, when it scored on a
one-yard touchdown run from
senior fullback/linebacker Owen
Marecic, and never looked back.
"The second half had a point
explosion," Harbaugh said. "There
were no mistakes from there on
out, from halftime until the end of
the game. Everybody was just on
point and executed extremely
well."
"We just went back to the fun
damentals," said redshirt junior

tight end Coby Fleener. "We kept
plugging away and we started to
make some plays."
The offensive highlight of Stan
ford's second half was a drive with
around six minutes left in the third
quarter. After junior safety De
lano Howell intercepted a pass
from Virginia Tech quarterback
Tyrod Taylor on the Stanford
three-yard line, Stanford's offense
went 97 yards down the field for a
touchdown in exactly two plays
and 29 seconds. Sophomore run
ning back Stepfan Taylor, the

team's leading rusher, broke a 56-
yard run from the three-yard line
on the drive's first play, and red
shirt sophomore quarterback
Luck threw a deep 41-yard bomb
to a wide-open Fleener in the cen
ter of the field for a touchdown.
The score put Stanford up, 26-12,
and put all the momentum square
ly on the Cardinal sideline.
"I thought it was huge," Luck
said, speaking about the drive.
"Any time backed up in your own
end zone as an offense, you've got
a little bit of the hairs on the back
of your neck standing up because
you know how precarious that po
sition can be. And to go from one
end zone to the other end zone in
two plays, it's huge."
Luck, who won the Orange
Bowl MVP award, finished with
287 yards and four touchdowns on
18-of-23 passing. Fleener was by
far his favorite target for the game;
Luck found him for six receptions,
173 yards and three touchdown
catches. The tight ends as a unit
were huge for Stanford as they
comprised three of Luck's top five
targets.

Stanford's running game was
also instrumental in winning the
Orange Bowl. The Cardinal
amassed 247 yards on the ground,
including 118 yards from Stepfan
Taylor and another 99 yards from
senior Jeremy Stewart, who had
been sidelined for much of the sea
son by an injury sustained in Stan
ford's opener. The Cardinal offen
sive line opened up big holes for its
running backs, leading to several
long runs.
"I think the O-line plays with a
lot of pride," Luck said. "They sort
of kept at it, chipped away, kept
grinding and holes really started
opening up."
As the offense rolled up points
in the second half, the defense did
an impressive job of containing

The Stanford football team celebrates an emphatic win over Virginia Tech in the 2011 Orange Bowl. The Cardinal finished the season 12-1, a far
cry from its 1-11 season in 2006. The game marked the final time that Jim Harbaugh would take the field as head coach of the reborn program.
