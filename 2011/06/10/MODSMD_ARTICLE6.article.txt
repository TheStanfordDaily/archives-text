## Kappa Sigma appeal rejected 
### AN LE NGUYEN ZACH ZIMMERMAN EDITORS 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman declined Kappa
Sigma's appeal on Monday, uphold
ing Residential Education's deci
sion to revoke the fraternity's hous
ing for the coming academic year.
The chapter will have a chance to
apply for reinstatement in January
2012 as part of a formal relevancy
presentation to a review panel.
Following Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder's
March 11 decision to strip Kappa
Sigma of its housing, fraternity
members were given approximately
a week's time to present their case
for an appeal. Boardman stressed
that the appeal was not intended to
reintroduce specific incidents that
led to Golder's ruling, but to review
the process as a whole.
"The grounds for appeal were
based on whether the process was
unfair or if there were new facts to
consider that weren't presented
earlier," he said. "They did not pro
vide that evidence to me to overrule
Dean Golder's decision."
Boardman did make one
amendment to Res Ed's initial rul
ing. Instead of applying for housing
as part of a larger pool of unhoused
organizations, Kappa Sigma will be
given priority, allowing the chapter
to make the necessary changes with
an elevated possibility of reclaiming
its residence.
"If they make the progress we
expect them to make, they should
be given the first opportunity to
move back into their house,"
Boardman said. "It's going to take a
lot of hard work. It also requires
strong leadership and strong sup
port."

"When we ask them what Kappa
Sig stands for, we want them to have
an answer that is robust and com
plex," Golder added.
The University is slated to speci
fy the conditions on April 22.
"Everyone would have liked to
see a different outcome, and we
have worked tremendously hard for
another one to take place," wrote
Kappa Sigma President Brian
Barnes 'l2 in an email to The Daily.
"Unfortunately, the University felt
it was in all parties' best interest for
this hiatus to occur."
Boardman's decision came as a
particularly strong disappointment
to the younger crop of Kappa Sigma
members.
"Our house has been working
very hard for the past several
months to better the culture of the
fraternity and to take steps to create
the house that both the University
and the Kappa Sigma members
want," said Malcolm McGregor 'l3.
While members "may disagree"
with the University's ruling, they
are committed to "working whole
heartedly" to prove that the frater
nity should eventually return to its
house, McGregor said.
Kappa Sigma's current resi
dence will be used as a Row house
in the 2011-12 academic year, open
ing up approximately 55 new spaces
for upperclassmen, the majority of
which will be considered "pre
ferred" slots. According to Golder,
members of Kappa Sigma will be
prohibited from drawing into the
facility.
The converted house will take
on the name "1025 Campus Drive,"
indicative of its street address.
Staffing positions will be filled using
this year's unmatched applicants.
"We have vacancies that pop up
all the time, so we'll go back to the

list of folks that applied, and we'll
use that to drive and define our
process," Golder said. "We have
tons and tons of people that are
great applicants, but there just
weren't enough jobs to go around."
Even with short-term plans in
place following Kappa Sigma's re
moval, members of the fraternity
are optimistic they will return after
a one-year hiatus. Barnes said he
was "confident" that the chapter
could successfully "work with Resi
dential Education to meet their
proposed criteria" to regain their
house in the fall of 2012.
The beginnings of such an effort
have already been in the works.
"As part of the appeal that we
submitted, we laid out several
things that we've already done to
improve the culture of the house,"
McGregor said.
Moving forward, Kappa Sigma
will look to foster a sense of com
mon identity.
"In our Kappa Sigma chapter
bylaws, we have a mission state
ment and part of that mission state
ment is to further scholarship, lead
ership, community service, the de
velopment of social graces and the
development of cultural aware
ness," McGregor said. "That's
something that has always been
there, but in recent years, we may
have lost sight of that."
"I think in our future actions next
year, the things that we're doing are
upholding those goals," he added.
Barnes echoed these sentiments,
stating that current fraternity mem
bers "look forward to exceeding"
the University's expectations as
they strive to regain their house.
