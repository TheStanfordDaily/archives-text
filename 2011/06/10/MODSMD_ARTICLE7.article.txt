## Faculty Senate votes 'yes' on ROTC return 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Following more than a year of research and debate,
the Faculty Senate voted on Thursday 28-9, with three
abstentions, to extend an invitation for ROTC to return
to Stanford.The vote effectively ends the 40-year ban of
the program on campus.
"We believe that the majority of students support
the return of ROTC, and a substantial minority oppos
es it," said Committee Chair Ewart Thomas, professor
of psychology.
"No member of our committee objects to the mini
mizing of violence," he added. "We offer our recom
mendation in favor of minimizing the military-civilian
gap"
The ad hoc committee, established last March, re
leased its report last week announcing its support for a
Stanford ROTC program. ROTC was initially voted off
campus in 1970 after concerns of its academic merit
were raised. All ROTC programs were gone by 1973.
The report initially consisted of six clauses that
served as the cornerstone of the committee's recom
mendation, including the creation of a Stanford ROTC
Committee that would evaluate military professors and
courses, as well as serving as a mediator between the
University and the military.
Thomas presented the ad hoc committee's report to
the Faculty Senate; debate then proceeded for more
than an hour.
Professor William Perry '49 M.S. '55 presented the
initial proposal to investigate Stanford's relationship
with the military last year. He reminded the Faculty
Senate that they would not be debating ROTC if Con
gress had not recently repealed "don't ask, don't tell."

"That repeal would not have happened without sig
nificant support from senior military officials in the
U. 5.," he said. "Their enlightened views are obviously a
product of their education. Stanford has the opportuni
ty to help create military leaders that will later make
these enlightened decisions. This is the single most im
portant chance you will have to seize that opportunity."
"We can no longer free-ride on the public good
known as national security," added history professor
David Kennedy '63.
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2 distributed a
packet of compiled materials covering a range of stu
dent opinions about ROTC. He spoke on behalf of the
student body and urged the Senate to vote "no."
"ROTC does not align with the vision of this univer
sity," Cruz said. "Currently, Stanford is one of the safest
communities for transgender students in the world. I
want to make sure all Stanford students feel safe
enough to call this place home as well.
"A rejection of ROTC is a rejection of exclusion," he
added.
Imani Franklin 'l3, who served as one of two student
representatives on the ad hoc committee, spoke to the
Faculty Senate about why she supported the return of
an ROTC program.
"I came onto this committee knowing little to noth
ing about military lifestyles," she said. "Most of my
knowledge of the military came from watching 'Pearl
Harbor.' That is not okay.
"A large portion of the student body is entirely re
moved from a piece of the American population that
serves in the military," she said.
Franklin said that by allowing ROTC back onto
campus, the University could "hu
manize the people who fight our
wars."
"A huge part of our education at
Stanford is to expose to different
ways of life, nationally and global
ly," she said. "Military perspectives
have been invisible on this campus."
Fourteen students currently par
ticipate in ROTC programs
through cross-town agreements
with Santa Clara University, San
Jose State and UC-Berkeley. They
do not receive course credit for
their required military science
classes or physical training.
Some professors asked the com
mittee to clarify specific aspects of
its recommendation, including to
whom ROTC commanders would
report. The committee has pro
posed a program similar to those
found at MIT and Duke, where a
faculty committee reviews each po
tential professor and evaluates the
content of potential military sci
ence courses.
Later, an amendment was pro
posed to ensure that ROTC cadets'
chosen majors were not dictated by
their involvement in the program.
Political science professor Scott
Sagan, also a member of the com
mittee, said that some students
chose to attend other universities
because of their ROTC offerings
and a return could make Stanford a
more viable option for prospective
students.
"Some students do choose other
universities over Stanford who
offer on-campus ROTC programs,"
he said.

Others expressed concern about
the implications of interpreting the
University's nondiscrimination pol
icy in light of an endorsed ROTC
program.
"With respect to 'don't ask, don't
tell,' that goal is not yet accom
plished nor irreversible," political
science professor Gary Segura said.
"There is no evidence for any
palpable benefits to Stanford," he
added. "Furthermore, it will always
be an asterisk on our nondiscrimi
nation policy."
Graduate Student Council rep
resentative Justin Brown echoed
this sentiment.
"How large does a group of stu
dents need to be so that they can
feel as though their civil rights are
acknowledged and protected?" he
asked.
However, University general
counsel Debra Zumwalt said that
formal recognition of ROTC would
not violate the nondiscrimination
policy as it currently stands.
"Our policy prevents against il
legal discrimination," she ex
plained. "Based on all the informa
tion we have, we do not see an ille
gal discrimination and [ROTC]
does not violate our policy."
Additionally, Thomas said that a
small group of members of the
transgender community told the
committee they would not partici
pate in ROTC even if the ban on
openly serving were lifted.
Regardless, Brown said that
even the debate over the last
months has caused significant stress
for many of the parties involved.
"I have never seen the student
body so divisive," he said.
"It is reasonable to predict,
many members of the community
would regard this as the correct de
cision, while others will see it as a

mistake," Thomas said. "Our re
search over the last year shows that
this program will prevail into the fu
ture in shaping a more vibrant com
munity."
The Faculty Senate ultimately
voted in favor of the committee's
recommendation with three addi
tional amendments, including a
condemnation of the military's dis
criminatory policies against trans
gender people.
"Our support for reestablishing
the ROTC program should not be

misconstrued," read a joint state
ment released by President John
Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy. "We understand the
concerns about the military's con
tinuing discrimination against
transgender people, and we share
those concerns. But if the leader
ship of the military is drawn from
communities that teach and prac
tice true tolerance, change is more
likely to occur. The U.S. military has
demonstrated an ability and will
ingness to change over time, and we

believe Stanford can contribute by
providing leaders capable of help
ing create that change."
Approximately 30 students, in
cluding members of Stanford Stu
dents for Queer Liberation (SSQL)
and Stanford Says No to War, wait
ed outside of the Law School to
protest the Faculty Senate's deci
sion, while others applauded the
committee members as they exited.
