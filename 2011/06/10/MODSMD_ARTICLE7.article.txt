## Faculty Senate votes 'yes' on ROTC return 
### KATE ABBOTT DEPUTY EDITOR 
Following more than a year of research and debate,
the Faculty Senate voted on Thursday 28-9, with three
abstentions, to extend an invitation for ROTC to return
to Stanford.The vote effectively ends the 40-year ban of
the program on campus.
"We believe that the majority of students support
the return of ROTC, and a substantial minority oppos
es it," said Committee Chair Ewart Thomas, professor
of psychology.
"No member of our committee objects to the mini
mizing of violence," he added. "We offer our recom
mendation in favor of minimizing the military-civilian
gap"
The ad hoc committee, established last March, re
leased its report last week announcing its support for a
Stanford ROTC program. ROTC was initially voted off
campus in 1970 after concerns of its academic merit
were raised. All ROTC programs were gone by 1973.
The report initially consisted of six clauses that
served as the cornerstone of the committee's recom
mendation, including the creation of a Stanford ROTC
Committee that would evaluate military professors and
courses, as well as serving as a mediator between the
University and the military.
Thomas presented the ad hoc committee's report to
the Faculty Senate; debate then proceeded for more
than an hour.
Professor William Perry '49 M.S. '55 presented the
initial proposal to investigate Stanford's relationship
with the military last year. He reminded the Faculty
Senate that they would not be debating ROTC if Con
gress had not recently repealed "don't ask, don't tell."

"That repeal would not have happened without sig
nificant support from senior military officials in the
U. 5.," he said. "Their enlightened views are obviously a
product of their education. Stanford has the opportuni
ty to help create military leaders that will later make
these enlightened decisions. This is the single most im
portant chance you will have to seize that opportunity."
"We can no longer free-ride on the public good
known as national security," added history professor
David Kennedy '63.
ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2 distributed a
packet of compiled materials covering a range of stu
dent opinions about ROTC. He spoke on behalf of the
student body and urged the Senate to vote "no."
"ROTC does not align with the vision of this univer
sity," Cruz said. "Currently, Stanford is one of the safest
communities for transgender students in the world. I
want to make sure all Stanford students feel safe
enough to call this place home as well.
"A rejection of ROTC is a rejection of exclusion," he
added.
Imani Franklin 'l3, who served as one of two student
representatives on the ad hoc committee, spoke to the
Faculty Senate about why she supported the return of
an ROTC program.
"I came onto this committee knowing little to noth
ing about military lifestyles," she said. "Most of my
knowledge of the military came from watching 'Pearl
Harbor.' That is not okay.
"A large portion of the student body is entirely re
moved from a piece of the American population that
serves in the military," she said.
Franklin said that by allowing ROTC back onto
