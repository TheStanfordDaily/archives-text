## Stanford explores NYC tech campus 
### KATE ABBOTT ELIZABETH TITUS SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
University President John Hen
nessy announced during yesterday
afternoon's Faculty Senate meeting
that Stanford is investigating the in
vitation to establish a New York City
campus focused on applied science
and technology.
The University is "exploring" the
possibility, said spokeswoman Lisa
Lapin ahead of Thursday's meeting.
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg announced in Decem
ber that the city was seeking a
"world-class university" to partner
with and build an engineering school
on public land. The idea grew from
the city's concern over attracting
technology companies and jobs to
New York, which lacks a top gradu
ate school in engineering.
"This is sort of a first for us,"
Lapin said. The idea is "still in the ex
ploration stage," she added.
"I think remembering that we are
a university that serves this nation,
and I think we need to take a page
out of the President's State of the
Union address," Hennessy said
when asked about the advantages of
such a center. "I think the challenge
in the U.S. is to create more centers
of innovation and vibrancy, which
this university is qualified to under
take."
U.S. News and World Report
ranked Stanford's engineering
school second behind M.I.T. in 2010.
The school's doctoral programs in
computer science, electrical engi
neering and mechanical engineering
boast top rankings by the National
Research Council, according to the
school's website.
Hennessy stressed that this
would not be a satellite campus op
erating similarly to those hosted
abroad with typically one revolv
ing faculty member present each
quarter but an actual second
Stanford campus.
In addition to Stanford's 8,180-
acre home campus, the University
maintains Hopkins Marine Station
in Monterey, Calif., a program for
undergraduates in Washington,
D.C.,and 11 overseas programs.

He said that initially, there would
be at least computer science and
electrical engineering departments
that would "admit faculty and stu
dents in an integrated fashion with
the University."

These departments would serve
as building blocks from which the
campus could expand over time. The
initial concept envisions hosting 25
faculty members, 125 Ph.D. students
and 250 masters students from the
School of Engineering and the
Graduate School of Business, ac
cording to a press release shared at
the meeting.
According to Hennessy, much of
the response thus far has been posi
tive, but officials will discuss fi
nances, academic considerations and
other factors before reaching a final
decision.
"The time is coming when univer
sities will be in more than one loca
tion ... and I believe the institution
that figures out how to make it work
and make it work well will be in a sig
nificantly valued position," Hen
nessy said.
A team from Stanford, along with
representatives from approximately
15 other universities, attended an in
formational meeting with city offi
cials on Feb. 1 to learn more about
the project. Hennessy reiterated that
this project is "very much a competi
tion."
Official expressions of interest
are due by Mar. 16.
