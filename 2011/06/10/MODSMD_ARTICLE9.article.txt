## Stanford lowers standard of proof for sexual assault 
### ELIZABETH TITUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford will lower its standard of proof for
sexual-assault cases and open the appeals
process to alleged victims in response to
guidelines released to universities last week by
the Obama administration.
The swift development comes amid a
longer-term review of Stanford's judicial-af
fairs process and a one-year pilot program
specifically focused on improving the Univer
sity's handling of sexual-assault cases. It brings
Stanford into line with the vast majority of uni
versities that use the lower standard for sexu
al assault cases, an issue on which Stanford has
been an outlier for years, administrators said
Monday.
The changes are at the direction of the De
partment of Education's Office for Civil Rights,
which is stepping up its implementation of Title
IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimina
tion at schools that receive federal money.
"We have to do better, and we have to do
better now," Vice President Joe Biden said last
Monday, speaking at the University of New
Hampshire about sexual-violence prevention
and the new guidelines.

The Office for Civil Rights said in sexual
violence cases, preponderance of evidence is
the "appropriate" standard of proof and that if
schools provide appeals processes, they must
do so for both parties. Those guidelines differ
from Stanford's former rules, which required
alleged victims to prove their cases beyond
reasonable doubt and which only provided an
appeals process for "responding" students
those accused of sexual misconduct.
Although both parties may now appeal, the

grounds for doing so will remain the
same, said Assistant Dean of Student
Life Jamie Pontius-Hogan.

Stanford President John Hennessy ap
proved the changes to Stanford's process, ef
fective immediately, after universities re
ceived the new federal guidelines on April
4. '
Governing the process for sexual-vio
lence cases here is the Alternative Review
Process, a one-year pilot program set to end in
December. In addition to sexual assault, the
process and the new federal guidelines
cover sexual harassment, dating violence and
stalking. The Board on Judicial Affairs and
community members developed the pilot pro
gram in hopes it would resolve sexual-vio
lence cases more quickly and privately.
The federal directive means that no matter
the fate of the pilot program whether the
University keeps, changes or does away with it
the lower standard of proof and new ap
peals process will remain. Stanford must now
design its sexual-violence process around the
mandates, said Dean of Student Life Christine
Griffith.
"I feel like we have been given a charge to
say, 'We really need to figure that out before
the end of December,"' Griffith said.
The changes will also remain in place re
gardless of the conclusions of Stanford's "in
ternal review panel." Launched earlier this
school year, it is taking the first major look at
Judicial Affairs since the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997.

The standard of proof has been a specific
area of focus for the internal reviewers, who
are set to issue a report by the end of the school
year. Reviewers could count on one hand the

I number of other uni
* versities they found
using the high "be
yond reasonable doubt"

standard, which Stanford had had in place
since before 1997, Griffith said.
The Office for Civil Rights' efforts come as
the office investigates allegations by 16 Yale
students who say their university is violating
Title IX and tolerating a "hostile sexual envi
ronment."
Nationwide, 20 percent of female college
students and 6 percent of male college stu
dents will be victims of attempted or actual
sexual assault, according to the Department of
Education.
At Stanford from 2007 to 2009, an average
of about 11 "forcible sexual offenses" oc
curred each year, according to police.
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll
praised the changes after Boardman an
nounced them Monday.
"Lowering of the standard of proof is ab
solutely crucial to the women's community,"
Cardona said.
Survivors of sexual assault must not be de
terred from the judicial system because of too
high a standard, she added.
Addressing women's issues was an early
focus of Cardona's term; she and former Vice

ANGELINA CARDONA 'll, ASSU President
Stanford will lower its standard of proof for
sexual-assault cases and open the appeals
process to alleged victims in response to
guidelines released to universities last week by
the Obama administration.
The swift development comes amid a
longer-term review of Stanford's judicial-af
fairs process and a one-year pilot program
specifically focused on improving the Univer
sity's handling of sexual-assault cases. It brings
Stanford into line with the vast majority of uni
versities that use the lower standard for sexu
al assault cases, an issue on which Stanford has
been an outlier for years, administrators said
Monday.
The changes are at the direction of the De
partment of Education's Office for Civil Rights,
which is stepping up its implementation of Title
IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimina
tion at schools that receive federal money.
"We have to do better, and we have to do
better now," Vice President Joe Biden said last
Monday, speaking at the University of New
Hampshire about sexual-violence prevention
and the new guidelines.

The Office for Civil Rights said in sexual
violence cases, preponderance of evidence is
the "appropriate" standard of proof and that if
schools provide appeals processes, they must
do so for both parties. Those guidelines differ
from Stanford's former rules, which required
alleged victims to prove their cases beyond
reasonable doubt and which only provided an
appeals process for "responding" students
those accused of sexual misconduct.
Although both parties may now appeal, the

grounds for doing so will remain the
same, said Assistant Dean of Student
Life Jamie Pontius-Hogan.

Stanford President John Hennessy ap
proved the changes to Stanford's process, ef
fective immediately, after universities re
ceived the new federal guidelines on April
4. '
Governing the process for sexual-vio
lence cases here is the Alternative Review
Process, a one-year pilot program set to end in
December. In addition to sexual assault, the
process and the new federal guidelines
cover sexual harassment, dating violence and
stalking. The Board on Judicial Affairs and
community members developed the pilot pro
gram in hopes it would resolve sexual-vio
lence cases more quickly and privately.
The federal directive means that no matter
the fate of the pilot program whether the
University keeps, changes or does away with it
the lower standard of proof and new ap
peals process will remain. Stanford must now
design its sexual-violence process around the
mandates, said Dean of Student Life Christine
Griffith.
"I feel like we have been given a charge to
say, 'We really need to figure that out before
the end of December,"' Griffith said.
The changes will also remain in place re
gardless of the conclusions of Stanford's "in
ternal review panel." Launched earlier this
school year, it is taking the first major look at
Judicial Affairs since the Student Judicial
Charter of 1997.

The standard of proof has been a specific
area of focus for the internal reviewers, who
are set to issue a report by the end of the school
year. Reviewers could count on one hand the

I number of other uni
* versities they found
using the high "be
yond reasonable doubt"

standard, which Stanford had had in place
since before 1997, Griffith said.
The Office for Civil Rights' efforts come as
the office investigates allegations by 16 Yale
students who say their university is violating
Title IX and tolerating a "hostile sexual envi
ronment."
Nationwide, 20 percent of female college
students and 6 percent of male college stu
dents will be victims of attempted or actual
sexual assault, according to the Department of
Education.
At Stanford from 2007 to 2009, an average
of about 11 "forcible sexual offenses" oc
curred each year, according to police.
ASSU President Angelina Cardona 'll
praised the changes after Boardman an
nounced them Monday.
"Lowering of the standard of proof is ab
solutely crucial to the women's community,"
Cardona said.
Survivors of sexual assault must not be de
terred from the judicial system because of too
high a standard, she added.
Addressing women's issues was an early
focus of Cardona's term; she and former Vice
