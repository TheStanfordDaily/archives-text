Have you thought about integrating your current
graduate training in science with public policy?
Wanted to explore technology policy in the heart
of Silicon Valley? Not sure which skills would be the

Stanford's Master in Public Policy (MPP) program
recently began offering a concentration in science

is taught by Stanford faculty devoted to merging

of the rigorous and rewarding MPP degree.
