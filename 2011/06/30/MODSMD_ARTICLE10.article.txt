## SEEING GREEN Superfund Me 
### Holly Moeller 
Scattered across Santa Clara County
home during our tenure at Stanford
are 23 parcels of land so polluted that
they've been targeted for government inter
vention.

These "Superfund sites," numbering
more than 1,250 across the United States and
its territories, are contaminated by heavy
metals, organic solvents and petroleum
residues. Some are at risk of contaminating
the drinking water of hundreds of thousands
of people; others already have. Some sites are
so polluted that their very soil must be
scraped away; others will not be fit for human
habitation for generations.
But the purpose of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)-administered Su
perfund (or, as Congress originally passed the
legislation, the "Comprehensive Environ
mental Response, Compensation and Liabil
ity Act" of 1980) is the cleanup and long-term
rehabilitation of those sites that can be re
stored. And so EPA officials scurry about the
country, evaluating the extent of contamina
tion, implementing emergency controls when
necessary and designing cleanups in concert
with the affected state and community.
To see an extreme cleanup in action is to
see humans operating as though they were on
another planet or perhaps in the bowels of
the Fukushima reactor. All-white hazmat
suits attempt to shield workers from acute
toxicity or long-term carcinogenesis. As the
site's infrastructure, foundations, landscaping
and topsoil are stripped away, so too is the
identity of a place that was once untouched by
man, then bustling with human activity and
then finally rendered, through our activities,
poisonous to our very existence. One won
ders: how did this happen? Who allowed it to
happen?

The answers to such questions are simulta
neously simple and ambiguous. On the one
hand, there's usually one clear culprit: some
negligent business dumping waste in the
backyard, for example. But on the other
hand, many of the listed sites predate Super
fund (and other environmental) legislation.
Certainly, it's hard to imagine the polluters
were oblivious to the consequences of their
actions, though they might not have known
the specific dangers of their waste stream
(today, we still test only about one in 10 of the
new chemicals we release into the environ
ment).
It took environmental catastrophe to
rouse environmentalism in the American
public. So it's little wonder that, absent regu
lation, businesspeople worried more about

their bottom lines than a trickle of mercury
here or a few gallons of paint thinner there. If
the environment were affected, well, maybe
no one would notice.
In reality, Superfund sites are among the
easiest to link to their polluters: contamina
tion is physically present in the place where it
was dumped, or leaked, generally by the pre
vious or current owner. And so in 70 percent
of the cases, the EPA points its finger, and the
guilty party picks up the cleanup tab.
But that leaves three out of 10 sites un
funded. For 15 years, we met this shortfall
with specific taxes levied on the oil and gas in
dustry, chemical manufacturers and some
other corporations. When that tax expired in
1995, Congress continued to fund (a dwin
dling number of) the highest priority projects
by appropriating general funds that is, by
taking money out of America's back pocket.
This seems intuitively unfair: why should
we pay twice (with our health and with our
checkbooks) for the environmental miscon
duct of big business? Yet attempts to rein
state the tax have repeatedly failed. This year,
we'll see if Washington State has better luck
on a smaller scale, as its legislators debate a
one-percent tax on petroleum products, pes
ticides and fertilizers to pay for storm water
cleanup. (Rainfall picks up traces of these
pollutants when it flows over suburban lawns
and busy streets.)
The typical business propaganda, of
course, abounds: we'll drive industry and jobs
overseas! Increased prices will pass the tax on
to the consumer!
The latter is almost certain to happen.
And it should. Because both we and those
faceless corporate giants are complied in
something called the Tragedy of the Com
mons: we use nay, abuse natural re
sources not directly linked to or owned by
ourselves. Thus, when resources are de
stroyed or degraded, we experience no direct
personal costs. Indeed, even if only one per
son (or one company or one country) does
the damage, the burdens are diffused over a
larger local (or global) population.
So, when we take a long shower without
paying the cost of sustainable water, or when
we drive our cars without paying a carbon
emissions tax, or when we dump our sewage
into the ocean to mix with everyone else's.
