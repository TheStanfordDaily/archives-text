# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## Kiasu and the Rat Race 
### Aysha Kureishi 
££ "T That is this guy doing ?!?!" My mom
\A/ stares in disbelief as the light turns
T T green and the car in front of us stays
parked for one... two... three... four... five...
six...
"Honk at him," I suggest.
"Absolutely not."
No matter how slow or inattentive a driver
may be, my mother will never honk the horn at
a fellow driver. Instead ...
"Come on! DRIVE!"
The car slowly begins to move, and my
mother exhales in a very annoyed manner.
"So kiasu,' 1 she mutters, shaking her head
and rolling her eyes.
For the Western world, kiasu just sounds
like any other word in any other foreign lan
guage. But for those in the lion-port city of Sin
gapore, it's away of life. For many Singapore
ans, kiasu is the definition of the only way one
ought to live one's life.
Kiasu (key-ah-sue) is actually a Hokkien
word. Translated, it literally means "fear of los
ing." And not just losing at Yahtzee or Scrab
ble. We in Southeast Asia have taken the para
noia of not being the first or the best at every
thing to a whole other level. So much so that we
will go to extraordinary means to guarantee we
are the first and you are not.
Kiasu parents impose strict study laws on
their children in elementary school to ensure
that they are at the top of their graduating class
and score highest in their future A-levels. A
kiasu eater will take too much food from a buf
fet for fear that there will be none left later.
And a hard-core kiasu fan will "queue" for days
in advance to make sure he or she gets a limited
free ticket to a rock show. So will a hardcore fan
in America. But there is a darker side to being
kiasu.

Being kiasu doesn't only mean that you do
everything you can to get ahead. It also means
that you do everything in your power to make
sure that others don't get ahead of you. Stand
ing still on the escalator to prevent someone
from passing you is considered better than ac
tually competing to "reach the summit" by
walking. If you signal to change lanes in traffic,
the car next to you will purposely move forward
to prevent you from getting into "his" lane (de
spite the fact that you are going to a completely
different destination). A car in a light-con
trolled turn lane will purposefully take his time
to try and trap you behind a light, so he can take
off and leave you behind in the dust.

There is however, away to beat kiasu.
The term kiasu connotes self-preservation,
egocentrism and over-competiveness. The
method in which you overcome kiasu, there
fore, is to be everything that kiasu is not. That
means being overly kind and super-considerate
of others' feelings, but not in an insincere or sar
castic manner. You have to truly be genuine.
This throws a hardcore kiasu into a state of
total confusion, suspicion and paranoia. If you
have a cart full of groceries and you offer to let
the person behind you go ahead with his or her
four items, he or she will be shocked and quick
ly refuse the offer. A kiasu driver will be suspi
cious when you motion to let him or her in to
the flow of traffic. These calm acts of kindness
can be as powerful as a stun gun, not only in the
short term, but in the long term as well be
cause maybe in that moment of shock and con
fusion, your fellow citizens will question the
purpose of your actions. And when they realize
that it goes completely against the social norms
of kiasu, they'll begin to question their actions.
And then maybe, just maybe, they might act a
little differently toward other people.
Today, society is so caught up in the capital
ist rush that we often forget the need to uphold
the Golden Rule for ourselves, rather than
make sure others uphold it. "Do unto others as
you would they unto you" does not mean that if
you believe you have been mistreated, you
have the right to seek petty revenge. It is not
our place to supervise others and uphold the
Golden Rule for them. But when we take care
to treat people right, they will be inclined to do
the same for us.
Don't let kiasu define Southeast Asia for
you, though. The Singaporean government en
dorses communal welfare and random acts of
kindness. It is not uncommon to see a young
boy or girl spring up from his or her seat to
allow a pregnant woman to rest on the public
transit. If you seem lost, I can guarantee that a
well-meaning citizen will stop and ask you if
you need assistance. If you happen to trip on
the stairs (like myself) and your books, pens
and papers spill everywhere, a crowd of people
will come rushing to help you to your feet and
make sure you are unharmed and able to con
tinue on your way.
Although encountering kiasu can be annoy
ing, most people greet it comically. It's the part
of our culture that we make fun of. We even
