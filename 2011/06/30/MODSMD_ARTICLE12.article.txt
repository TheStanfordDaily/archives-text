## HANG UP THE HATS BASEBALL FALLS IN CHAPEL HILL, BUT LOOKING GOOD FOR 2012 
### JACK BLANCHAT STAFF WRITER 
After blasting its way through the first
round of the postseason, the Stanford baseball
team's season ended just one step short of the
College World Series when it dropped two
games to North Carolina in the Chapel Hill
Super Regional in early June. Despite finish
ing short of its ultimate goal a chance to
play for a national title in 2011 the Cardi
nal's run to the Supers for the first time since
2008 showed that the young, explosive team
looks primed for a run to Omaha in 2012.
The Cardinal started seven (and some
times eight) underclassmen for the majority of
the 2011 season, and the prevailing question at
the outset of spring was if the team could de
velop from a highly ranked recruiting class
into a force to be reckoned with on the nation
al scale. During the regular season, the Cardi
nal cruised past substandard foes but didn't
dominate against high-quality opponents en
route to a fifth-place finish in the Pac-10.
But by the time Stanford entered the post
season, the young Cardinal suddenly looked
like a group of veterans on a mission, dominat
ing the Fullerton regional from its spot as the
No. 2 seed. Behind sophomore starter Mark
Appel, who pitched a complete nine innings in
the first game of the regional, Stanford bashed
Kansas State 10-3 to take the opener.
The pressure racked up against Cal State
Fullerton in game two of the regional, but
Stanford got more excellent pitching from two
juniors Jordan Pries and Chris Reed
and critical plays from two sophomores
outfielder Tyler Gaffney and third baseman
Stephen Piscotty â€”to slip past hometown
Fullerton, 1-0.
Pries was perfect on the mound until he al
lowed a single to lead off the fifth inning. After
a sacrifice bunt and a strikeout, Titan second
baseman Greg Velazquez clubbed a shot into
the outfield that looked like it would end up as
an RBI double, but Gaffney made a diving
catch to end the inning and keep the game tied
at zero.
While replays showed that the ball
bounced off the turf before ending up in
Gaffney's glove, the favorable call kept the
momentum going Stanford's way, and Piscot
ty crushed a fastball over the left-field fence to

Junior reliever Brian Busick, pitching above, was a key part of a Stanford bullpen that was solid throughout the year. Busick will likely take over
for junior Chris Reed as Stanford's closer next season. Reed was selected 1 6th overall in the MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers.
give the Cardinal a 1-0 lead in the
bottom of the sixth inning.
Reed then came in and made sure
that was the only run Stanford would
need by getting the final out with a
runner on third base in the eighth in
ning. He then pitched a 1-2-3 ninth
inning to close out the most intense,
pressure-packed game of the season
and secure his ninth (and most im
portant) save of the year.
After grinding out the win over
Fullerton, Stanford once again un
leashed its offense to secure a trip to
the Super Regionals, defeating Illi
nois 14-2 behind two home runs from
senior Ben Clowe and another bomb
from freshman right fielder Austin
Wilson. The 14 runs were the most
Stanford had scored since a 22-run
performance against Washington
State back on April 2.
But upon arrival in North Caroli
na, the heat, humidity and postsea
son pressure (as well as outstanding
Tar Heel pitching) ended Stanford's
season.

In the first game of the best-of
three series, Stanford could hardly
muster any offense off Tar Heel se
nior Patrick Johnson, who struck out
seven and only allowed one run in 7.2
innings. After an early UNC run,
Stanford looked like it was in posi
tion to finally break Johnson in the
top of the seventh when senior Dave
Giuliani almost knotted the game up
with a shot to the warning track that
was chased down at the last moment
by centerfielder Ben Bunting, but
the Tar Heels swung the momentum
in their favor with a two-run home
run in the bottom half of the seventh
to knock Stanford starter Appel out
of the game.
The Cardinal answered right

back with two runs in the top of the
eighth on an infield single from fresh
man Brian Ragira, but the bullpen
promptly gave up two runs in the
bottom half of the inning to seal
Stanford's fate in game one, a 5-2 loss
that left the Cardinal in a do-or-die
position.
Pries got the call to try and square
the series up at one game apiece, but
the junior never quite found com
mand of the strike zone and gave up
three runs early on before he was
bounced from the game in the fourth
inning with Stanford trailing 3-1.
Meanwhile, UNC freshman Kent
Emanuel strode through the Cardinal
lineup by only giving up one run in six
innings of work, which looked like it
would be more than enough to secure
a victory when Stanford relievers
Brian Busick and Reed who was
battling a flu-like illness gave up
three more runs in the seventh inning
to extend the Carolina lead to 6-1.
That was partly due to a costly throw
ing error from Piscotty, his third of the
weekend.
But instead of whimpering
through the end of the game, the
Cardinal suddenly stormed back in
the bottom of the eighth inning
when, after an RBI from Ragira
scored Gaffney, Wilson rolled a
bases-loaded double all the way to
the wall in left-center to score three
runs and make the game 6-5. Giu
liani reached on a walk after Wil
son's double, but senior catcher Zach
Jones promptly grounded into his
second double play of the day to end
the scoring in the eighth and leave
the Cardinal down one run headed
to the ninth frame.
After Reed got two outs in the top
of the ninth inning, the sky quickly
turned dark with rain, leading to a
three-and-a-half-hour delay. When
play resumed, Reed came back out
to the mound, but he was unable to
prevent another run from scoring,
making the Tar Heel lead 7-5 when

the Cardinal came to bat with its sea
son on the line.
Clowe and freshman pinch hitter
Danny Diekroeger both struck out
before Piscotty grounded out harm
lessly to second base, sending the Tar
Heels into a frenzy on the field and
leaving Stanford scratching its head,

looking for answers as to how it pos
sibly could have been bounced from
the postseason so unceremoniously.

Looking Ahead
All in all, the story of the 2011 sea
son appears to be that Stanford looks
like a looming giant for 2012 and be

yond: the Cardinal will most likely
lose just seven players from a team
that had only four seniors. Reed's
breakout year prompted the Los An
geles Dodgers to take the Southern
California native with the 16th pick
in the MLB Draft, following in the
footsteps of former Cardinal closer
and current Washington National
Drew Storen, who was the 10th over
all pick in the 2009 draft.
In 2012, Stanford will bring back
several top prospects, including
Appel, who logged a team-high in in
nings while pitching against top
flight competition all year, as well as
junior lefthander Brett Mooneyham,
who missed all of 2011 after having
surgery on his pitching hand. The
bullpen will be a bit of a question
mark with Reed moving along to the
pros, but Busick looks fit to step into
the closer role after returning from
injury to finish out 2011 with solid
numbers, including a 2.79 ERA.
On offense, the Cardinal will re
turn the team's top nine hitters, in
cluding Piscotty, who hit .364;
Gaffney, who takes a 22-game hit
ting streak into 2012; Ragira, the Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year; Wilson, the
team's leader in home runs; and
sophomore shortstop Kenny
Diekroeger, who slumped slightly
this year after hitting .365 as a fresh
man in 2010. Defensively, the squad
must find away to replace Jones,
who started every game behind the
plate in 2011, but every other posi
tion player returns to the field.
Altogether, it appears that the
Cardinal's excellent postseason
groomed a young, potent team to be
ready for the chance to return to the
College World Series, and it appears
that Stanford's goal the one word
chanted after every game looks
like it might be on the horizon, closer
than ever: Omaha.

Senior catcher Zach Jones started all 57 games behind the dish forthe Cardinal
this season and bounced back from a tough start at the plate to finish
with a .255 average. Besides his catching, Stanford will also lose his postseason
experience from the team's 2008 College World Series run during
Jones' freshman year.
