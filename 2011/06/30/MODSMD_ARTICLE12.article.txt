## HANG UP THE HATS BASEBALL FALLS IN CHAPEL HILL, BUT LOOKING GOOD FOR 2012 
### JACK BLANCHAT STAFF WRITER 
After blasting its way through the first
round of the postseason, the Stanford baseball
team's season ended just one step short of the
College World Series when it dropped two
games to North Carolina in the Chapel Hill
Super Regional in early June. Despite finish
ing short of its ultimate goal a chance to
play for a national title in 2011 the Cardi
nal's run to the Supers for the first time since
2008 showed that the young, explosive team
looks primed for a run to Omaha in 2012.
The Cardinal started seven (and some
times eight) underclassmen for the majority of
the 2011 season, and the prevailing question at
the outset of spring was if the team could de
velop from a highly ranked recruiting class
into a force to be reckoned with on the nation
al scale. During the regular season, the Cardi
nal cruised past substandard foes but didn't
dominate against high-quality opponents en
route to a fifth-place finish in the Pac-10.
But by the time Stanford entered the post
season, the young Cardinal suddenly looked
like a group of veterans on a mission, dominat
ing the Fullerton regional from its spot as the
No. 2 seed. Behind sophomore starter Mark
Appel, who pitched a complete nine innings in
the first game of the regional, Stanford bashed
Kansas State 10-3 to take the opener.
The pressure racked up against Cal State
Fullerton in game two of the regional, but
Stanford got more excellent pitching from two
juniors Jordan Pries and Chris Reed
and critical plays from two sophomores
outfielder Tyler Gaffney and third baseman
Stephen Piscotty â€”to slip past hometown
Fullerton, 1-0.
Pries was perfect on the mound until he al
lowed a single to lead off the fifth inning. After
a sacrifice bunt and a strikeout, Titan second
baseman Greg Velazquez clubbed a shot into
the outfield that looked like it would end up as
an RBI double, but Gaffney made a diving
catch to end the inning and keep the game tied
at zero.
While replays showed that the ball
bounced off the turf before ending up in
Gaffney's glove, the favorable call kept the
momentum going Stanford's way, and Piscot
ty crushed a fastball over the left-field fence to

Junior reliever Brian Busick, pitching above, was a key part of a Stanford bullpen that was solid throughout the year. Busick will likely take over
for junior Chris Reed as Stanford's closer next season. Reed was selected 1 6th overall in the MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers.
