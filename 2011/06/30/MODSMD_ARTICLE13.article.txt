## Stanford well represented at World Cup 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
A total of six soccer players are represent
ing Stanford at the 2011 FIFA Women's
World Cup in Germany, with four current and
former Cardinal seeing action in the first
game of group play this week.
Already making an impact is American de
fenseman Rachel Buehler 'O7, whose goal on
a loose ball off a corner kick late in the open
er sealed a 2-0 victory for the United States.
The 76th-minute tally gave the U.S. squad the
only multi-goal victory thus far in the tourna
ment.
Joining Buehler on the American team is
goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart 'O4 and forward
Kelley O'Hara 'lO, though neither saw action
in the opening match.
The two current Stanford players in the
tournament, junior defender Alina Garcia
mendez and senior midfielder Teresa Noyola,
are both playing for Mexico. Despite their rel
ative youth, they both saw action in the Mexi
can squad's first match. While Noyola came in
as a late-game substitution, Garciamendez
at 20, the squad's fourth youngest player
started and played the full 90 minutes.
Another fairly recent Stanford grad in the
tournament is Ali Riley 'lO, who started for
the New Zealand team in its first match and
played the entire game.
Mexico and New Zealand will both have
their second match of group play today, while
the United States won't play again until Fri
day.
