# Football picks up early commits
## 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Stanford's 2012 recruiting class is shaping
up quickly, with three wide receivers joining
the mix last week to bring the football team's

commit tally to nine.
Four-star Deante' Gray, three-star Kodi
Whitfield and two-star Connor Crane are
three recruits that will help fill the void left by
departing seniors Doug Baldwin and Ryan
Whalen at the receiver position. All three
signed on June 23 and look to bolster the Car
dinal's offensive prospects in the years to
come.
