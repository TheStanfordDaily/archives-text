### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Stanford's 2012 recruiting class is shaping
up quickly, with three wide receivers joining
the mix last week to bring the football team's

commit tally to nine.
Four-star Deante' Gray, three-star Kodi
Whitfield and two-star Connor Crane are
three recruits that will help fill the void left by
departing seniors Doug Baldwin and Ryan
Whalen at the receiver position. All three
signed on June 23 and look to bolster the Car
dinal's offensive prospects in the years to
come.
Other standouts among Stanford's 2012
class are four-star recruits Noor
Davis and Alex Carter, ranked 18th
and 115 th in the ESPNU 500, re
spectively. Noor is projected to be
the second-best outside linebacker
in this year's class, while Carter's
experience as a defensive back
could translate to roles as a safety
or another receiver.
Stanford is tied with Utah for
fourth in the Pac-12 with nine re
cruits to date, behind Washing
ton's 15, Arizona State's 12 and
USC's 10.
