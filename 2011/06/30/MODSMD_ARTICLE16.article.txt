# JUST ANOTHER CUP
## Even with women's win, Capital One Cup is poor award 
### Jacob Jaffe 
The 2010-11 school year
was another banner
campaign for the Stan
ford Athletics program.
The football team set
numerous school records en route to
its best season ever and its first BCS
bowl victory, a 40-12 thrashing of Vir
ginia Tech, and a No. 4 ranking.
In typical Stanford fashion,
though, the football team was not the
only Cardinal squad to have a stellar
year. Stanford prides itself on the
depth of its athletics program, and
this depth was once again on display.
For the 35th straight year, the Cardi
nal won at least one national title.
This one was even more special, as
the streak-extending championship
was also the school's 100 th NCAA
team title. And again, in typical Stan
ford fashion, it came in a so-called
"small sport," men's gymnastics.
Title No. 101 came exactly a month
later, when the women's water polo
team dispatched archrival Cal in the
final.
Along with these triumphs, nu
merous other sports enjoyed remark
able seasons. This has led to more
awards for the school, including yet
another Director's Cup. Winning the
award for the best overall athletics
program in the country should be
quite an honor for any school, but for
Stanford, the Director's Cup has be
come merely an alarm clock, a re
minder that another year has passed.
Why? Because Stanford has now
won the cup 17 straight times. To put
this in perspective, star quarterback
Andrew Luck had not yet begun
kindergarten when the Cardinal
started this streak.
Ho hum, another Director's Cup.

Another performance so dominant
that you could take away both N C A A
titles and Stanford would still have
clinched the cup before baseball sea
son is even over. Big deal, this hap
pens every year. Didn't they create a
new award so Stanford wouldn't al
ways win? Didn't some idiot blabber
on about that for a whole column last
summer?
Ok, I'd be surprised if you remem
bered that. But you might have heard
a little bit about the Capital One Cup
in the past year. It's a new award that
is supposed to measure the same thing
as the Director's Cup, but is struc
tured, not coincidentally, in away that
hurts Stanford's chances by a) split
ting men's and women's programs
into separate awards, b) arbitrarily
making some "more popular" sports
count for two or three times as much
as others and c) even more arbitrarily
omitting some sports entirely. The
Capital One Cup comes with much
more money, much more coverage
and much more ESPN than the Di
rector's Cup, so it has become the new
award of choice.
So how did the Cardinal do in this
Cardinal-unfriendly competition?

Again, in typical Stanford fashion, the
depth of the women's program over
came the aforementioned restric
tions to give Stanford the inaugural
Capital One Cup on the women's
side. Despite heartbreaking finishes
in NCAAs in soccer, basketball and
tennis, Stanford still racked up 121
points across nine sports to hold off
Texas A&M and Cal for the title.
The win earns the program another
trophy, 200 grand and a presentation
at next month's ESPY Awards.
Meanwhile, the men will not win but
are slated to finish in the top five
pending the results of the final base
ball poll.
For any reasonable fan, this was a
great year. But if there's anyone who
can be unreasonably negative, who
can find the con amid hundreds of
pros, it's yours truly. Maybe it's just
because I'm a pessimist, or maybe
I'm channeling my inner Gordon
Gekko, but I'm feeling a little
greedy. I think Stanford deserves
both Capital One Cups, which I'll call
COCs (pronounce as you wish).
To start, just take a quick peek at
the Capital One Cup website. If you
want to know the scoring, there's a lit
tle box by the standings, and it starts
with the headline "EVERY CHAM
PIONSHIP COUNTS" (yep, it's in
all caps) before listing the scoring sys
tem.
Really? Take the men's side for

example. Removing co-ed sports
(since the COC decided that women
and men are separate but equal),
there are 16 NCAA sports, and you
can make it 17 if you want to split foot
ball into FBS and FCS. The COC only
has 14. Apparently gymnastics, water
polo and volleyball don't count as
championships. I wasn't aware that all
those players were playing for noth
ing. Oh by the way, how did Stanford
do in those sports? First, third and
seventh in the country. Hmm, coinci
dence.
But wait, the COC is all about pop
ularity, right? That's what it claims
anyway. So those sports, which have
fewer than 25 Division-I teams each,
aren't popular enough to qualify.
That's why women's gymnastics is not
in either; it only has 63 D-I teams.

Now, if women's gymnastics were like
men's lacrosse, which is away more
popular sport (and has no Stanford
varsity team, by the way) with its 61
D-I teams, it would not only be fac
tored in, but it would count for twice
as much as a minor sport like tennis
(262 D-I teams, Stanford a perennial
contender).
Glad that's cleared up. So, to sum
marize the brilliance of the COC, take
a look at Eastern Washington. Yep,
that Eastern Washington, known pre
viously for its red field and Rodney
Stuckey and that's about it. Well, this
year, EWU football lost by 23 to
Montana State, one of the two teams
to actually lose to Washington State,
Stuckey's alma mater then went on a
tear, squeaking by to win its remain
ing games and enter the FCS tourna
ment (yep, there is a college football
playoff in some parts of the country).
Despite having an average margin of
victory of less than a touchdown,
Eastern Washington edged out
Delaware for the FCS title. Shocking
ly, the Eagles did not place in the top
10 in any other sport.
But if you look at the men's COC
standings, you'll see Eastern Wash
ington way up there with 60 points,
which will likely net the Eagles a top
five or six finish. So winning the sec
ond-division football title gives it 60
points. On the other hand, if you add
up Stanford's points for finishing

fourth in the real football subdivision,
winning the national title in men's
gymnastics, winning the national title
in women's water polo, placing sec
ond in women's tennis, placing sec
ond in women's rowing, placing third
in men's water polo and placing
fourth in men's cross country, you get
56 points. Not even in Star Trek could
there be a universe where that makes
any logical sense.
So what's the takeaway, get rid of
all these awards? Well, no. It's still
good to see schools honored for hav
ing athletic success in a variety of
sports (even if the current men's
leader, Auburn, has scored points in
only two). And how bad can an award
be for Stanford if Stanford wins half of
it and takes home 200k in the process?
Sadly, the answer is "still pretty
darn bad."
But awards shouldn't overshadow
what a great year it was for Stanford
sports. Congrats to every athlete,
coach and staff member that con
tributed to Cardinal athletics this past
year. You made Stanford once again
the best athletic school in the country.
Maybe one day you'll reach the
same heights as Eastern Washington
football.

Jacob Jaffe is distraught that his
columns didn't earn Stanford any
Capital One Cup points. Send him

ing athletic success in a variety of
sports (even if the current men's
leader, Auburn, has scored points in
only two). And how bad can an award
be for Stanford if Stanford wins half of
it and takes home 200k in the process?
Sadly, the answer is "still pretty
darn bad."
But awards shouldn't overshadow
what a great year it was for Stanford
sports. Congrats to every athlete,
coach and staff member that con
tributed to Cardinal athletics this past
year. You made Stanford once again
the best athletic school in the country.
Maybe one day you'll reach the
same heights as Eastern Washington
football.

The 2010-11 school year
was another banner
campaign for the Stan
ford Athletics program.
The football team set
numerous school records en route to
its best season ever and its first BCS
bowl victory, a 40-12 thrashing of Vir
ginia Tech, and a No. 4 ranking.
In typical Stanford fashion,
though, the football team was not the
only Cardinal squad to have a stellar
year. Stanford prides itself on the
depth of its athletics program, and
this depth was once again on display.
For the 35th straight year, the Cardi
nal won at least one national title.
This one was even more special, as
the streak-extending championship
was also the school's 100 th NCAA
team title. And again, in typical Stan
ford fashion, it came in a so-called
"small sport," men's gymnastics.
Title No. 101 came exactly a month
later, when the women's water polo
team dispatched archrival Cal in the
final.
Along with these triumphs, nu
merous other sports enjoyed remark
able seasons. This has led to more
awards for the school, including yet
another Director's Cup. Winning the
award for the best overall athletics
program in the country should be
quite an honor for any school, but for
Stanford, the Director's Cup has be
come merely an alarm clock, a re
minder that another year has passed.
Why? Because Stanford has now
won the cup 17 straight times. To put
this in perspective, star quarterback
Andrew Luck had not yet begun
kindergarten when the Cardinal
started this streak.
Ho hum, another Director's Cup.

Another performance so dominant
that you could take away both N C A A
titles and Stanford would still have
clinched the cup before baseball sea
son is even over. Big deal, this hap
pens every year. Didn't they create a
new award so Stanford wouldn't al
ways win? Didn't some idiot blabber
on about that for a whole column last
summer?
Ok, I'd be surprised if you remem
bered that. But you might have heard
a little bit about the Capital One Cup
in the past year. It's a new award that
is supposed to measure the same thing
as the Director's Cup, but is struc
tured, not coincidentally, in away that
hurts Stanford's chances by a) split
ting men's and women's programs
into separate awards, b) arbitrarily
making some "more popular" sports
count for two or three times as much
as others and c) even more arbitrarily
omitting some sports entirely. The
Capital One Cup comes with much
more money, much more coverage
and much more ESPN than the Di
rector's Cup, so it has become the new
award of choice.
So how did the Cardinal do in this
Cardinal-unfriendly competition?

Again, in typical Stanford fashion, the
depth of the women's program over
came the aforementioned restric
tions to give Stanford the inaugural
Capital One Cup on the women's
side. Despite heartbreaking finishes
in NCAAs in soccer, basketball and
tennis, Stanford still racked up 121
points across nine sports to hold off
Texas A&M and Cal for the title.
The win earns the program another
trophy, 200 grand and a presentation
at next month's ESPY Awards.
Meanwhile, the men will not win but
are slated to finish in the top five
pending the results of the final base
ball poll.
For any reasonable fan, this was a
great year. But if there's anyone who
can be unreasonably negative, who
can find the con amid hundreds of
pros, it's yours truly. Maybe it's just
because I'm a pessimist, or maybe
I'm channeling my inner Gordon
Gekko, but I'm feeling a little
greedy. I think Stanford deserves
both Capital One Cups, which I'll call
COCs (pronounce as you wish).
To start, just take a quick peek at
the Capital One Cup website. If you
want to know the scoring, there's a lit
tle box by the standings, and it starts
with the headline "EVERY CHAM
PIONSHIP COUNTS" (yep, it's in
all caps) before listing the scoring sys
tem.
Really? Take the men's side for

example. Removing co-ed sports
(since the COC decided that women
and men are separate but equal),
there are 16 NCAA sports, and you
can make it 17 if you want to split foot
ball into FBS and FCS. The COC only
has 14. Apparently gymnastics, water
polo and volleyball don't count as
championships. I wasn't aware that all
those players were playing for noth
ing. Oh by the way, how did Stanford
do in those sports? First, third and
seventh in the country. Hmm, coinci
dence.
But wait, the COC is all about pop
ularity, right? That's what it claims
anyway. So those sports, which have
fewer than 25 Division-I teams each,
aren't popular enough to qualify.
That's why women's gymnastics is not
in either; it only has 63 D-I teams.

Now, if women's gymnastics were like
men's lacrosse, which is away more
popular sport (and has no Stanford
varsity team, by the way) with its 61
D-I teams, it would not only be fac
tored in, but it would count for twice
as much as a minor sport like tennis
(262 D-I teams, Stanford a perennial
contender).
Glad that's cleared up. So, to sum
marize the brilliance of the COC, take
a look at Eastern Washington. Yep,
that Eastern Washington, known pre
viously for its red field and Rodney
Stuckey and that's about it. Well, this
year, EWU football lost by 23 to
Montana State, one of the two teams
to actually lose to Washington State,
Stuckey's alma mater then went on a
tear, squeaking by to win its remain
ing games and enter the FCS tourna
ment (yep, there is a college football
playoff in some parts of the country).
Despite having an average margin of
victory of less than a touchdown,
Eastern Washington edged out
Delaware for the FCS title. Shocking
ly, the Eagles did not place in the top
10 in any other sport.
But if you look at the men's COC
standings, you'll see Eastern Wash
ington way up there with 60 points,
which will likely net the Eagles a top
five or six finish. So winning the sec
ond-division football title gives it 60
points. On the other hand, if you add
up Stanford's points for finishing

fourth in the real football subdivision,
winning the national title in men's
gymnastics, winning the national title
in women's water polo, placing sec
ond in women's tennis, placing sec
ond in women's rowing, placing third
in men's water polo and placing
fourth in men's cross country, you get
56 points. Not even in Star Trek could
there be a universe where that makes
any logical sense.
So what's the takeaway, get rid of
all these awards? Well, no. It's still
good to see schools honored for hav
ing athletic success in a variety of
sports (even if the current men's
leader, Auburn, has scored points in
only two). And how bad can an award
be for Stanford if Stanford wins half of
it and takes home 200k in the process?
