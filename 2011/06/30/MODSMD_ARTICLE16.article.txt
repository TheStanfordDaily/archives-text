# JUST ANOTHER CUP
## Even with women's win, Capital One Cup is poor award 
### Jacob Jaffe 
The 2010-11 school year
was another banner
campaign for the Stan
ford Athletics program.
The football team set
numerous school records en route to
its best season ever and its first BCS
bowl victory, a 40-12 thrashing of Vir
ginia Tech, and a No. 4 ranking.
In typical Stanford fashion,
though, the football team was not the
only Cardinal squad to have a stellar
year. Stanford prides itself on the
depth of its athletics program, and
this depth was once again on display.
For the 35th straight year, the Cardi
nal won at least one national title.
This one was even more special, as
the streak-extending championship
was also the school's 100 th NCAA
team title. And again, in typical Stan
ford fashion, it came in a so-called
"small sport," men's gymnastics.
Title No. 101 came exactly a month
later, when the women's water polo
team dispatched archrival Cal in the
final.
Along with these triumphs, nu
merous other sports enjoyed remark
able seasons. This has led to more
awards for the school, including yet
another Director's Cup. Winning the
award for the best overall athletics
program in the country should be
quite an honor for any school, but for
Stanford, the Director's Cup has be
come merely an alarm clock, a re
minder that another year has passed.
Why? Because Stanford has now
won the cup 17 straight times. To put
this in perspective, star quarterback
Andrew Luck had not yet begun
kindergarten when the Cardinal
started this streak.
Ho hum, another Director's Cup.
