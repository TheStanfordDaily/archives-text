# OLYMPIC SOCCER RIPE FOR RIDICULE
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Of all the memorable sights and
sounds that the Olympics will
bring to London next year, one of
the strangest might be a British
soccer team.
It might sound odd that the island that
brought this sport to the world and that holds
three Olympic gold medals has not competed
in the men's competition since 1956 and has
never entered a team in the women's. But so are
the complexities of international sports.
To play in the Olympics, teams must usually
qualify in earlier tournaments: in Europe, for ex
ample, this consists of the UEFA Under-21
Championship, and even to reach that tourna
ment, European teams must have succeeded in
an earlier group stage. Not only would the
Home Nations (England, Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales) have to unite to compete in
the Games, but they would have to do this sever
al years beforehand in order to pass through all
the qualification stages. Next year, however, is
an exception: as host, the U.K. might enter a
team or athlete in every sport, regardless of the
usual rules.

But life is never quite that easy. Only the
English FA supports the idea, with the other
three football associations rejecting it on princi
ple. Just broaching the subject seems dangerous,
since apart from the technical difficulties of how
to form such a team, there is the question of
whether membership should be based purely on
merit (potentially making the team almost ex
clusively English) or on a quota system (that
could be detrimental to the team and clearly un
fair). It raises the unthinkable prospect of the
four nations losing their historical privilege and
being forced to play together in other interna
tional tournaments. That would be something
like the MLB deciding there are too many base
ball franchises on the East Coast and making the
Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees join
forces.
As an English fan, I too am completely
against the idea. Not only does a British soccer
team make no sense, but if I'm being really,
really honest soccer has no place in the
Olympics. The Games should be the biggest
event in any sport that gets to grace its stage, and
in comparison to the World Cup, an Olympic

gold medal is just a consolation prize.
So what should we do?
There might just be away to please eveiyone
at least everyone in the U.K., that is and
take soccer back to its roots. With a guaranteed
ticket, we can surely select anyone we want, so
why pick professionals? Few locals will show
much more than a passing interest in the soccer
tournament, and should a professional British
team reach the final, many may dread the impli
cations of a positive result.
But if the team was entirely made up of ran

domly selected amateurs and chosen not on the
basis of skill but on enthusiasm (and passing a
basic fitness test), things would surely be differ
ent. If millions will tune in to watch reality TV,
surely reality sport can capture a similar audi
ence.
And it would be the perfect response to the
bigwigs of international sport, particularly soc
cer. Not only would it highlight the pointlessness
of Olympic soccer whose tournament will
take place a few short days after the climax of the
far more globally significant UEFA Euro 2012
Championship and the fact that the sport de
flects much needed attention away from far
more deserving Olympics activities, but would
also be a rejection of the status quo, a protest
vote that all is not well in the world of soccer.
While disputed by the major governing bod
ies, it is a generally accepted fact that the wishes
of corporations have been put far ahead of those
of real fans. Within the beautiful game itself,
money rules far more than anything else. The
gulf between the top teams and those just a few

Perhaps it's time to give
the amateurs a chance to
teach the pros a
lesson or two.
