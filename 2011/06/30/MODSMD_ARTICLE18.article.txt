A Adam Cole 'lO, de
scribing a typical scene at the Hopkins
Marine Station in Monterey. "You will
definitely see a harbor seal. And always
you can smell the ocean the same
ocean that inspired Steinbeck gray
green in the morning sun and thick with
swaying, gold-flecked life."
Alexandra Pounds 'll, another Hop
kins alum who will finish up her degree
in Earth Systems with a Concentration
in Ocean Science this fall, remembers
other details about the center.
"Looking out past the large boulders
that stick out of the water, you remem
ber all the biodiversity you saw at low
tide and wonder what it's doing under
the water," she said. "The sun and the
wind make everything feel fresh. The
mass covering of greenery the surrounds
the station is actually invasive, so you
don't feel bad trampling on it to get a bet
ter look at the baby sea lions lounging on
the beach."
Yet the picturesque Central Coast
oasis was not always so serene, a theme
that Hopkins Marine Station Director
Stephen Palumbi chronicled in his re
cent book, "The Death and Life of Mon
terey Bay." The book, released in No
vember 2010, covers the bay's tumul
tuous history, from the times of Spanish
exploration to cannery exploitation to
today's model of a successful ecosystem
revival.
Monterey Bay is "a story of revival"
because despite suffering problems sim
ilar to those faced by other ocean ecosys
tems, such as pollution and overfishing, it
has recovered dramatically since the
19305, Palumbi said.
In the 19205, the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion housed part of the California De


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
partment of Fisheries, which studied
the effects of the sardine fishing in
dustry. Researchers there found the
canneries' pollution and overfishing
to be unsustainable for the bay.
This data fell on deaf ears until
Julia Piatt, a marine biologist, advo
cated for a clean bay. Though she
won a series of court cases against the
canneries' pollution, nothing was
done, prompting Palumbi to call this
"a hollow victory."
Piatt subsequently established the
first community-based marine re
serve on the West Coast. With such a
reserve, she could protect the ani
mals from everything except pollu
tion, hoping that they could come
back strong when the pollution was
finally eradicated, Palumbi said.
Palumbi explained that the area
near the Hopkins Marine Station in
corporated the strongest protection
through a no-take zone for scientific
study and protection of the shoreline.
By the 19605, impressive abalone
colonies were growing, attracting the
return of sea otters. As the sea otters
consumed the herbivores, a vibrant
kelp forest returned.
Founded in 1984, the Monterey
Bay Aquarium changed the relation
ship between the bay and the com
munity. Instead of acquiring a profit
by taking precious resources out of
the bay for consumption and sale, the
aquarium and ecotourism business
profit by celebrating the ecosystem's
health and making it possible for oth
ers to do the same. As locals saw that
a healthy, productive and diverse
ecosystem was both beneficial for the
environment and "good for busi
ness," more people began to advo
cate for its growth.
The aquarium now sees more
than two million visitors per year,
whom it educates on the values of
ecosystem diversity by engaging
them with marine life directly be it
walking alongside massive tanks of
jellyfish or holding starfish.
Through the enlargement of
Piatt's original reserve, the anti-pollu
tion efforts of the region and the influ
ence of the Aquarium, Monterey Bay
is now in its best shape of the past 200
years. Some problems still exist, espe
cially pollution via agricultural runoff,
but "people are able to talk about it,
to come to grips using the bay and not
let future problems overwhelm the
bay as past problems used to,"
Palumbi said.
He noted that Stanford's classes
and various overseas and off-campus

opportunities including those in
Australia, Hawaii or Hopkins
best foster environmental discussion
among undergraduates as they allow
students to become involved with
real ecosystem issues.
"They open up the natural world
to real, intense academic study," he
said.
Hopkins offers combined lecture
and field classes on kelp forest ecolo
gy, marine conservation biology and
marine and molecular ecology, all of
which draw from the bay itself lit
erally.
"One day, one of our professors,
James Watanabe, went scuba diving
in the bay before class, scooped up a
bucket of life and brought it back,"
Cole recalled. "We spent several
hours sifting through it and examin
ing the diversity under a microscope.
That was pretty representative of
how Hopkins classes are run."
Be it working on worms that his
group collected in the tide pools or
analyzing the behavior of snails that
the students found crawling in the
bay, Cole described other hands-on
experiences in his time at Hopkins.
"Every class, every professor and
every research project at Hopkins is
inextricably linked to the ecosystem
that surrounds it," he said.
Like Cole, Pounds' quarter in
Monterey Bay instilled in her a last
ing love for the outdoors that she
hopes to incorporate into her future
career.
"Hopkins made me realize how
much I love being outside and inter
acting with nature I don't think a
desk job is right for me," she said. "I
need to be seeing and watching na
ture in a personal manner to have an
engaging life. At Hopkins, I interact
ed with the ocean, its variability and
changing mood, and now I could
never abandon that relationship."

SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
partment of Fisheries, which studied
the effects of the sardine fishing in
dustry. Researchers there found the
canneries' pollution and overfishing
to be unsustainable for the bay.
This data fell on deaf ears until
Julia Piatt, a marine biologist, advo
cated for a clean bay. Though she
won a series of court cases against the
canneries' pollution, nothing was
done, prompting Palumbi to call this
"a hollow victory."
Piatt subsequently established the
first community-based marine re
serve on the West Coast. With such a
reserve, she could protect the ani
mals from everything except pollu
tion, hoping that they could come
back strong when the pollution was
finally eradicated, Palumbi said.
Palumbi explained that the area
near the Hopkins Marine Station in
corporated the strongest protection
through a no-take zone for scientific
study and protection of the shoreline.
By the 19605, impressive abalone
colonies were growing, attracting the
return of sea otters. As the sea otters
consumed the herbivores, a vibrant
kelp forest returned.
Founded in 1984, the Monterey
Bay Aquarium changed the relation
ship between the bay and the com
munity. Instead of acquiring a profit
by taking precious resources out of
the bay for consumption and sale, the
aquarium and ecotourism business
profit by celebrating the ecosystem's
health and making it possible for oth
ers to do the same. As locals saw that
a healthy, productive and diverse
ecosystem was both beneficial for the
environment and "good for busi
ness," more people began to advo
cate for its growth.
The aquarium now sees more
than two million visitors per year,
whom it educates on the values of
ecosystem diversity by engaging
them with marine life directly be it
walking alongside massive tanks of
jellyfish or holding starfish.
Through the enlargement of
Piatt's original reserve, the anti-pollu
tion efforts of the region and the influ
ence of the Aquarium, Monterey Bay
is now in its best shape of the past 200
years. Some problems still exist, espe
cially pollution via agricultural runoff,
but "people are able to talk about it,
to come to grips using the bay and not
let future problems overwhelm the
bay as past problems used to,"
Palumbi said.
He noted that Stanford's classes
and various overseas and off-campus

opportunities including those in
Australia, Hawaii or Hopkins
best foster environmental discussion
among undergraduates as they allow
students to become involved with
real ecosystem issues.
"They open up the natural world
to real, intense academic study," he
said.
Hopkins offers combined lecture
and field classes on kelp forest ecolo
gy, marine conservation biology and
marine and molecular ecology, all of
which draw from the bay itself lit
erally.
"One day, one of our professors,
James Watanabe, went scuba diving
in the bay before class, scooped up a
bucket of life and brought it back,"
Cole recalled. "We spent several
hours sifting through it and examin
ing the diversity under a microscope.
That was pretty representative of
how Hopkins classes are run."
Be it working on worms that his
group collected in the tide pools or
analyzing the behavior of snails that
the students found crawling in the
bay, Cole described other hands-on
experiences in his time at Hopkins.
"Every class, every professor and
every research project at Hopkins is
inextricably linked to the ecosystem
that surrounds it," he said.
Like Cole, Pounds' quarter in
Monterey Bay instilled in her a last
ing love for the outdoors that she
hopes to incorporate into her future
career.
"Hopkins made me realize how
much I love being outside and inter
acting with nature I don't think a
desk job is right for me," she said. "I
need to be seeing and watching na
ture in a personal manner to have an
engaging life. At Hopkins, I interact
ed with the ocean, its variability and
changing mood, and now I could
never abandon that relationship."

A Adam Cole 'lO, de
scribing a typical scene at the Hopkins
Marine Station in Monterey. "You will
definitely see a harbor seal. And always
you can smell the ocean the same
ocean that inspired Steinbeck gray
green in the morning sun and thick with
swaying, gold-flecked life."
Alexandra Pounds 'll, another Hop
kins alum who will finish up her degree
in Earth Systems with a Concentration
in Ocean Science this fall, remembers
other details about the center.
"Looking out past the large boulders
that stick out of the water, you remem
ber all the biodiversity you saw at low
tide and wonder what it's doing under
the water," she said. "The sun and the
wind make everything feel fresh. The
mass covering of greenery the surrounds
the station is actually invasive, so you
don't feel bad trampling on it to get a bet
ter look at the baby sea lions lounging on
the beach."
Yet the picturesque Central Coast
oasis was not always so serene, a theme
that Hopkins Marine Station Director
Stephen Palumbi chronicled in his re
cent book, "The Death and Life of Mon
terey Bay." The book, released in No
vember 2010, covers the bay's tumul
tuous history, from the times of Spanish
exploration to cannery exploitation to
today's model of a successful ecosystem
revival.
Monterey Bay is "a story of revival"
because despite suffering problems sim
ilar to those faced by other ocean ecosys
tems, such as pollution and overfishing, it
has recovered dramatically since the
19305, Palumbi said.
