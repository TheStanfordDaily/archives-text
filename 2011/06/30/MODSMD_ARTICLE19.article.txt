# Pac-12 to become official
## 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Just over a year after the addi
tion of Utah and Colorado was an
nounced, the two schools will be
come an official part of the soon
to-be-Pac-12 tomorrow.

The conference will also split
into a North and South division
next year, with Stanford, Califor
nia, the Oregon schools and the
Washington schools in the North
and the remaining schools in the
South.

Utah's addition is expected to
make an immediate impact on the
Pac-12's football hierarchy,
though Stanford will not play the
Utes this year since the conference
schedule remains at nine games.
The squad finished the season
ranked No. 23 in the USA Today
Poll with a 10-3 record after climb
ing as high as sixth in the rankings
after an 8-0 start.

Colorado, on the other hand, is
likely to be competitive in men's
basketball. The Buffaloes finished
just outside the NCAA Tourna
ment bracket last year but finished
fifth in a competitive Big-12 before
falling in the semifinals of the con
ference tournament to highly
ranked Kansas.
