### MARIANNE LEVINE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At Stanford's 120 th commencement,
Mexican President Felipe Calderon empha
sized in his keynote address the importance
of maintaining one's principles, even when
they are challenged. Calderon also stressed
the graduates' responsibility to use their ed
ucation to find solutions to world problems,
drawing upon his own personal and political
experiences to illustrate these points.
"Today you leave Stanford with the best
tools and the best knowledge," Calderon
said. "To graduate from this University is a
huge honor and a great responsibility. It
means you have the ability to serve others, to
bring positive change this world needs and to
do what so many had said was impossible."
Calderon asked the class of 2011 to ques
tion whether they wanted to live their lives
with little impact on the world, or whether
they wanted to become agents of change. He
stated that the key to life is to graduate as a
human being, and to become a good citizen
of the world. Calderon revealed that one's
ideals are the guideposts for having a global
impact.
"Fight for your ideals with all your
heart," Calderon said. "It doesn't matter
how hard it feels. Defend your principles in
the face of adversity."

The president described how fighting for
his ideals led to his own rise to power. He re
vealed he learned this important lesson
while growing up in autocratic Mexico.
Calderon stated that prior to Mexico's de
mocratic transition, a single party controlled
all political activity. Those who protested
the autocratic regime were massacred or
merely disappeared. Growing up, Calderon,
whose family remained politically active,
often expressed his frustration with the sys
tem's injustice to his father.
"He told me, 'I understand your anger,
but we are doing this because it is the right
thing to do, because it is our moral duty to
our country,"' Calderon said. "The only way
to change Mexico peacefully is to appeal to

people's consciences; if we don't do that, no
one will."
Calderon discussed how his father's ad
vice remained with him throughout his polit
ical career.
"You must never stop defending your
ideas," he emphasized. "Do not hesitate in
your efforts because man's power to create is
bigger than man's power to destroy."
The President stressed to the class of 2011
to never give up on their principles and to
follow their passion. He listed the numerous
challenges that face the world today, focus
ing in particular on poverty and global
warming. Calderon cited the Club of Rome's
