Last weekend's USA Track
and Field Championships at the
historic Hayward Field featured
current and past Stanford ath
letes. The national competition in
Eugene, Ore., had implications
for qualifying for the World
Championships later this summer.
Junior Chris Derrick and se
nior Jake Riley, a pair of long-dis
tance runners, both competed in
the 5,000-meter. Derrick finished
seventh, and Riley followed in
12th. Senior runner JT Sullivan
competed in the 3000-meter
steeplechase and finished eighth.
Senior Stephanie Marcy ran a per
sonal best 33:18.18 in the 10,000
and finished 18th.

In the U.S. Junior Champi
onships, which took place along
side the national championships,
freshman Jeremy Hines finished
third in the shot put with a toss of
61-10.5. Freshman Katie Nelms
competed in the 100-meter hur
dles but was disqualified because
of a false start.
Stanford alumni also made a
splash in the meet. Jillian Ca
marena-Williams 'O4 was the only
Cardinal athlete to make the
World Championships team with
a second-place finish in the shot
put.

Lindsay Allen 'OB and Sara
Hall (formerly Sara Bei) 'O4
missed qualifying for the World
Championships after finishing
fifth and sixth, respectively, in the
3,000-meter chase. Lauren Flesh
man 'O3 placed eighth at the 5,000-
meter and Lauren Centrowitz 'O9
finished 18th in the heats but did
not qualify for the finals.
Russell Brown 'OB was the only
male alum participating and fin
ished 26th in the heats for the
1,500-meter, clocking in at
3:44.47.
