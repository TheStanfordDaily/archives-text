## TV RECAP Stupid is as stupid does

Everyone has a guilty pleasure. Some oth
erwise healthy people go wild on boxes
of Twinkies; some perfectly intellectual
students read "Twilight"; some generally ami
able techies troll strangers on lb I. Me? I watch
"The Bachelorette." In my defense, though, the
daft dancer-slash-dentist Ashley and her harem
of identical, clean-cut white boys have got a lot
to teach us (mostly about how not to go about
the dating world).
To catch you guys up: this year's bache
lorette is Ashley, and she's about a thousand
times more annoying than Ali; her personality
is built on insecurities, and her behavior is
based around mind games. So far this season,
she's made out with just about everyone, "fallen
in love" with the only guy completely disinter
ested in her within a week of having met him
and then cried about it for the rest of the season
when he decided to leave. You're now officially
caught up; I just spared you literally 10 hours of
viewing in two sentences. You're welcome.
This week, the primary lesson learned was
that, despite what Ash and the boys so persis

tently tell us, not every tacky tourist destination
in America can be the perfect place to fall in
love eventually you're going to have to pick
one. Regardless, the guys did their best to con
vince us that Chiang Mai, Thailand was in fact
the dreamiest damn setting on the planet.
Harvard boy Ames waxed eloquent on the
romance in the air as the camera panned
through crowded, stinking street markets, with
an instrument that must have been the
lovechild of a foghorn and a bagpipe blaring in
the background. Be still my heart.
The one-on-one date also taught me some
thing new: namely that watching two people
pretend to make out is a good deal more
uncomfortable than watching them actually go
at it. The date was with Ben F., who has so little
sex appeal that Ashley has to spend 100 percent
of her camera time trying to convince the cam
eraman that he is, in fact, oozing with sessuality.
In one memorable moment, the pair was sitting
in front of a temple and Ben leaned in for a kiss,
only to be told in Ashley's nasal whine that "this
place is too sacred for that!" Instead, the two

leaned in
close and
shared a
"mental" kiss:

"I'm picturing kissing you;" "I'm
picturing it too." It was like watching a
couple having phone sex while sitting
next to each other. I still shiver at the
thought of it.

The group date didn't have a
whole lot of life lessons, but it was one of
the more fantastic moments this season: in a
rare and highly appreciated bit of fan service,

the suitors were stripped down
and oiled up, given a brief lesson
in Thai boxing and then thrown
into a ring and told to kick the
crap out of each other. Viewers

were then subjected to Ashley's little worried
cries if you didn't want them to hit each
other, Ash, why did you create this challenge?—
as the guys gleefully wailed on one another.
Inevitably, Harvard-boy Ames discovered that
no amount of fancy schooling can help you

guile your way out
of a fight and was
sent to the hospital
for a mild concus
sion (perhaps the

world's least
glamorous
injury). Ashley
I was distraught,
| of course, but
" not distraught

¥ enough to go
check on Ames
in the hospital.

And from the rare
two-on-one date (in
which one man gets a rose
and the other gets sent

home), I was finally able to reach the conclu
sion that Ashley was actually, genuinely, legiti
mately awful. We all knew that she was inse
cure, and we all knew that she was fairly annoy-

ing, but today, I learned that she was
flat-out stupid. On her date, she told
William (a snake) and Ben C. (a
really nice, sincere guy) that she
would be sending one of them
home. William made a couple of

awkward attempts at excluding Ben
("here, pal, you sit over here 10 feet
away!"), then gave up on subtlety
and took Ashley aside to tell her that
Ben was completely disinterested in
her and was looking forward to
online dating after the show. It was
the most blatant attempt at sub
terfuge I have ever seen, but little
Ashley's jaw dropped. She proceed
ed to race back and send Ben home,

despite his insistence that he had
said no such thing, obviously. On the
bright side, he was just spared a
grim future with Miss Insecurity.
General conclusion of the
night: Chiang Mai is in fact not the
perfect place to fall in love.
