If "Cars 2" were made by Dream Works,
it'd be a pretty good movie. But because
"Cars 2" is, of course, a Pixar film, it's held
to a higher standard.
Pixar has been the movie studio that could
do no wrong. They have dazzled us with brilliant
films in the last decade such as the "Toy Story"
movies, "Monsters, Inc.," "Ratatouille," "WALL-
E" and "Up." They have shown us that it's possi
ble to make a film about French gourmet cook
ing starring a rat, to tell a robot love story and, in
a society that doesn't value old age, to have an
adventure film starring a 78-year-old. In recent
times, when only dark, serious movies could

gain award buzz, they really showed us that movies
could still be considered great despite being funny.
While the original "Cars" is generally not
considered one of Pixar's greatest movies, it's still
a solid piece of entertainment with that certain
Pixar magic. The cars are all well-developed,
three-dimensional characters and when
Lightening McQueen (Owen Wilson) shows how
much he's grown throughout his stay at Radiator
Springs, it's genuinely moving.
I wish I could say the same about "Cars 2,"
but instead of nuanced, it's simply loud and in
many ways, the characters feel one-dimensional. If
the original "Cars" was Pixar's sports movie, then
"Cars 2" is Pixar's spy movie. "Cars 2" brings back
all of the characters (with the exception of Doc
Hudson voiced by the late Paul Newman) from
the first film and introduces some new ones,
including two spy cars Finn McMissile (Michael
Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).
"Cars 2" focuses a good chunk of its time on
Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), the dimwitted-but
lovable tow truck. While I really liked Mater in the
first "Cars," a whole movie centered on him is real
ly a bit too much Mater. He works best when he's a
supporting character and grates when he's anything
more. The two spy cars Finn and Holley are bland
and nothing more than caricatures of the generic
British spies that they portray. Though the spy cars
are equipped with some very cool spy gadgets and
Finn's action sequences are especially very fun to
watch, as characters, they really are unmemorable.
"Cars 2" is colorful, busy and full of fun eye
candy. I enjoyed many of the details in the "Cars"
world including their version of drinks, airplanes,
Tokyo (including anime versions of the cars),
European street markets and allusions to other
Pixar films. There are many attempts at jokes, but
few hit the mark.
The conflicts and ideas in "Cars 2" should've
translated into Pixar's trademark poignancy but
end up feeling hollow. There's just too much going
on: spies, racing, tons of action and traveling that
really prevents the character development from
coming through.
While "Cars 2" has its fun moments, it lacks
heart and that extra special Pixar touch.
