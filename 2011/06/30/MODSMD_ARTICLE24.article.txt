## LMFAO's new 'Party' same refrain 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Their group name is LMFAO:
obviously, uncle and nephew
duo Redfoo and Sky Blu aren't
aiming for seriousness in their music.
The title of their second full-length stu
dio album, "Sorry for Party Rocking,"
reveals the same; LMFAO came to bring
a 60-minute barrage of electro-pop to
overstimulate their already sweaty,
dancing target audience. While "Sorry
for Party Rocking" is perfect for a night
out, its real failure comes in its tiresome
repetition the album sounds like one
endless song.
The duo's first album, "Party
Rock," released in 2009, introduced
their vision of endless nightlife. Singles
"I'm in Miami Bitch" and "Shots,"
along with the rest of the somewhat
interchangeable tracks, were almost per
fectly engineered for a hot, too-crowded
college party. Nonetheless, LMFAO
seemed like a "one-hit-wonder" type of
duo, not one with a whole lot of talent
behind the music.
However, for a group that doesn't
exactly display versatility in their musi
cal style or talent in their singles,
LMFAO has been wildly successful.
Exhibiting the marketing skills they
probably inherited from Motown
Records founder Berry Gordy, their
father (Redfoo) and grandfather (Sky
Blu), LMFAO quickly won the hearts of
college students around the world with
their perfect party lives and enormous
female entourage.
The first single from "Sorry for
Party Rocking," "Party Rock Anthem,"
quickly became the duo's most success
ful individual song of their first two
albums, perhaps for its somewhat
generic description of a party ("every
body just have a good time") that can

appeal to a broader scope of audiences.
However, compared to the rest of the
album, its sound completely blends into
the crowd.
In fact, the songs that shine some
what are those that feature the talents of
other artists. For instance, "Take It to
the Hole" features an annoying tinny
whine throughout the song, but a guest
appearance by Busta Rhymes gives the
song more credibility and differentiates
it, somewhat, from the other hour of
electro. Similarly, "Champagne
Showers," the second single from the
album featuring Natalia Kills, might be
a thinly disguised extended metaphor
for something else, but at least the
sound of a woman's voice breaks up the
rest of the album.
However, the key failure of "Sony
for Party Rocking" comes with its lack
of even one song that breaks the others'
mold. A few have promise: along with

the collaborations, which at least insert
another voice, "With You" seems like it
might introduce a new sound, with a
more sophisticated techno intro that
feels like it could've been produced by
Daft Punk. However, it quickly disinte
grates into almost the same beat as every
other tune on the album. To be blunt,
every song sounds the same, and a run
through of "Sorry for Party Rocking"
leaves listeners wanting a little more.
In the end, "Sorry for Party
Rocking" starts the party like it was
meant to do, but if you're looking for
some pensive music this summer,
LMFAO isn't for you. However, if you're
planning on partying, expect to hear
"Sorry for Party Rocking," which might
just be a ffat DJ's dream come true.
