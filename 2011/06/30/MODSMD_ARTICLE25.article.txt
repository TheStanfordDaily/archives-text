## Bon Iver hits sophomore slump 
### – natasha AVERY contact natasha: navery@stanford. edu 
Bon Iver's first album "For Emma, Forever Ago" is
a tough act to follow, and his eponymous sopho
more album is a testament to this fact.
"For Emma" was critically acclaimed because it was
more a meditation that stemmed from Vernon's volun
tary isolation in northern Wisconsin than a collection of
songs. "Bon Iver" takes an opposite approach, one that
front man Vernon himself described as an "ambitious
musical departure" from his previous work. Moving
away from a single thematic and musical core, each track
on "Bon Iver" represents a place and its particular feel.
This structural organization is successful, save for a cou
ple of missteps that render the album a noble attempt
and only that.
The album opens with "Perth," a reflective piece
that features Vernon's familiar, ghostlike vocals. The soft
drums, reminiscent of "Team," are the first indicator of
Bon Iver's expansion to a full band. Although instru
mentally denser, the quality of Bon Iver is retained
Vernon still mumbles his lyrics, drowning them in over
dubbing and causing the listener to focus more on the
music than the words themselves.
"Minnesota, WI" is another strong track that bene
fited from Bon Iver's newfound ambitions. The use of
an electric, modern sound layered on hillbilly guitar is
innovative and fresh. Vernon's use of his lower register
on the track is a welcome departure from his frequent
falsetto. Vernon further experiments with his voice in
"Hinnom, TX," and his use of range to differentiate
between the moods of the places he explores on "Bon
Iver" is an indicator of his openness to musical experi
mentation.
"Towers" is another accomplished piece that incor
porates the old Bon Iver (whispered vocals, soft guitar)
with some of the newer bells and whistles (such as the
surprising but fitting violin). On the other hand,
"Holocene" makes up for its plain melody and sparse
instrumentation with its intriguing lyrics: "Someway
baby, it's a part of me, apart from me/You're laying waste
to Halloween."
"Michicant," with its flawless use of layering and
harmony, is one of the strongest tracks in the album. It
establishes a sense of narrative within the place it is
describing "I was unafraid/I was a boy/I was a tender
age" — and advances the story in away that comple
ments the swells of the music.
However, by the time "Wash." comes around, these
spatial and territorial explorations
are hazier. "Wash.," despite the eerie
piano riff, doesn't really progress
past that, and "Lisbon, OH," and
"Calgary" are directionless. Without
a "Re: Stacks" to be building toward,
some of these songs seem lost.
The last track, "Beth/Rest," is
more face plant than misstep and
would be better used as a PSA for
synthesizer abuse. It seems overeager
and overambitious, as if all the
instruments that were subtly used
throughout the album were haphaz
ardly thrown in at the end. The

result is far from dynamite and fin
ishes an otherwise sound album
with an unimaginative synth ballad
that conjures up a mental image of
kids in mullets slow-dancing at
homecoming.
Despite considerable efforts,
even Bon Iver couldn't escape the
dreaded sophomore slump. "Bon
Iver" contains some wonderful
tracks, and, like any respectable sec
ond album, doesn't simply try to
recreate its predecessor. However,
"Bon Iver" loses some of its magic
when it tries too fiercely to tear away
from its past.
