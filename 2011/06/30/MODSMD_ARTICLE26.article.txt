# A 						'definitive' remake of Ocarina? No.

I don't think anyone is surprised by the
warm reception critics have given the
recent 3DS remake of "The Legend of
Zelda: Ocarina of Time." It's a sure seller and
perhaps the easiest boardroom pitch of all
time the original game holds the highest
Metacritic score in history, and the 3DS
release almost single-handedly justifies pur
chasing a software-starved system that
nonetheless holds Nintendo's highest-ever
price tag for handheld hardware.
Take a closer look at the remake's
Metacritic page, though, and a somewhat less
predictable trend emerges or at least a less
agreeable one, if you ask me. Amidst the
obligatory praise for a brilliant remake from
a company that often leaves its past
untouched, critics have been deifying
Ocarina 3D as the "definitive" release of the
1998 classic.
I want us on the same page about what
that really means, so let's unpack that claim a
little bit it may be less innocuous than it
seems.
Calling Ocarina 3D "definitive" implies
that it's not only better than the N64 release,
but that it somehow encapsulates the entire
essence of what that game really was and
does so even more effectively than the origi
nal game itself. We're talking about encom
passing, surpassing and rendering obsolete
one of the most revered and influential
games of all time. "Definitive" is just a word,
but it says a lot.
Before I get too dramatic about diction,
I'll let that thought sit for a bit and indulge
some of my cohort's claims. After all, it's
hard not to agree with at least a few of their
points. I've spent more time with the original
Ocarina than almost any other game, and I

can't shake the feeling that the 3DS version
represents a more accurate representation of
Miyamoto's original vision for the game.
Take a look at some of the concept art from
the mid 90s, then compare them to a few
screenshots, and you'll see what I mean.
Characters are more detailed but maintain
their stylistic flair, Link's animations are
more fluid but don't deviate from their roots
and Castle Town is actually made of poly
gons. I've already played the hell out of
Ocarina 3DS and delivered the final face-stab
to Ganon, and I never felt that I was playing
anything but good, old-fashioned Ocarina of
Time.

For that, outsourced developer Grezzo
should be praised. It was entrusted with an
all-time classic and tuned the game up just
enough to bring its visuals to where they
should have been 13 years ago and no fur
ther. The game looks not quite like it was,
but still as I remember it. It's a quietly
astounding feat that developers should
remember when touching up hallowed fran
chises (I'm looking at you, Halo).
But we're forgetting the most important
part of Ocarina of Time's legacy the
impact it had on the industry. Think back to
the context of the gaming landscape when it
came out and the pure innovation it brought
to the table. And of course, the countless
games that continue to iterate on its basic
principles. We simply can't talk about a
definitive version of Ocarina without

remembering that it largely defined an era of
gaming itself. Three-dimensional navigation
and intelligent cameras, expansive open
worlds, contextualized action it all came
from Ocarina, the same way Halo proved
that first-person shooters can hold up on
consoles.
As a pixel-to-pixel tribute, Ocarina 3DS
is shackled to a golden blueprint that once
turned the industry upside down for being
unique. It's a strict formula, and one that
makes it inherently unable to have the same
lasting impact on games again. Other than
another reminder that our industry may be
the most remake-friendly of any entertain
ment medium, it offers nothing notable or
new but some well-implemented (read: non
intrusive) motion controls. Compared to the
groundbreaking original, it's just a drop in
the sea.

I wouldn't call it sad, but perhaps
inevitably ironic: Ocarina 3DS was developed
in the context of an industry that its source
material largely defined, and by sticking to
the script could never have truly recreated
what the original really meant. Even if it did
make an ill-advised but ambitious attempt to
similarly redefine, say, open-world 3D games
on handhelds, it would surely deviate too
much from original to even carry the same
name.
Ocarina 3DS is one of my favorite



COURTESY NINTENDO
games of 2011, but it can never
replace my favorite game of all time.
Even putting my own pro-Zelda bias
aside, it's impossible to encapsulate
the core of what Ocarina of Time
has become. With 13 years of the

gaming industry's adolescent years
stretched out before it, it's clear
Zelda's maiden voyage into polygo
nal 3D has ascended beyond stan
dard accounts of controls, anima
tions and level design to an almost
divine position that for years bent
the arc of gaming history in its direc
tion. Ocarina 3DS is a well-crafted
love letter and a beautiful realization
of the developer's original intent, but

it's 13 years too late to have the
galactic influence that's so integral to
the legacy of its predecessor. I know
it's picky, but if you're paid to write
you need to be careful with words
and "definitive" is one that just does
n't belong here.
