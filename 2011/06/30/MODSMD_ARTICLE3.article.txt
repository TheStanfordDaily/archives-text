## University launches travel assistance program 
### BILLY GALLAGHER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University announced earlier this month
that it is launching a new International Travel
Assistance Program intended to provide im
proved medical, personal, travel and security as
sistance services to Stanford affiliates who are
traveling abroad on University-related business,
research or programs.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman announced the new program in a
June 6 University-wide email. The program cov
ers faculty, staff, postdoctoral scholars and stu

dents as well as their spouses, domestic partners
and dependents.
Assistant Vice President for Risk Manage
ment Tina Dobleman explained the Universi
ty's inspiration for the new program.
"Expanded global travel by faculty, staff, stu
dents and postdoctoral scholars created the de
sire for consolidated international travel assis
tance resources and services," Dobleman wrote
in an email to The Daily.
The program's website provides travel,
health and security information by country as
well as telephone numbers to call for interna
tional travel-related assistance. Before traveling,

anyone covered under the program can register
his or her travel plans, which will help the Uni
versity locate and contact that individual in case
of an emergency.
The new program includes medical referrals
to local doctors or clinics as well as assistance
with lost documents and prescriptions. The
Vaden Travel Clinic also assists students with
pre-trip planning and vaccinations.
Not all of the services under the program's
umbrella are new. Information resources have
been available to students in the past but were
not as easy to access as they are on the
new website.
Emergency medical evacuation
services have also been available to
students in the past; these services
have now been consolidated to three
vendors: International SOS, On Call
International and MEDEX Global
Solutions.
Dobleman said they were chosen
because they are "leaders in the field of
international travel assistance."
The International Travel Assis
tance Program is the result of a joint ef
fort between Student Affairs, Vaden
Health Center, Postdoctoral Affairs,
Bechtel International Center, Bing
Overseas Studies Program, Business
Affairs/Global Services, the Provost's
Office and Risk Management.
Dobleman said that because some
of the services included in the pro
gram are billed on a per-use basis, the
University does not yet have an annu
al cost determined for the program.
Information services (from country
profiles to health and security alerts),
medical referrals and general travel
assistance are available to students
for free.
"This program does not provide
medical insurance," Dobleman wrote.
"Participants are expected to pay for
medical office visits, clinical services,

hospitalization, prescriptions, etc. di
rectly to the medical provider. Expens
es should then be submitted to your
medical insurance provider for reim
bursement. It is important to under
stand your medical insurance cover
age before you travel, as some carriers
respond only to 'emergency' medical
expenses incurred overseas."
Despite Boardman's University
wide email, some students who spoke
to The Daily were unaware of the pro
gram's existence or what it entailed.
"It's too bad that the email came off
as a sweet-but-disposable gesture by
Stanford," wrote Elizabeth Rosen 'l3
in an email to The Daily. Rosen is a for
mer Daily staff writer.
"I'm used to traveling in countries
where I speak the language, namely
South America and France," Rosen
added. "But having something as sim
ple as a referral to an English-speaking
doctor when that's not the case seems
pretty valuable."
"I'm doing research in Tanzania
this summer, which is relevant because
I'm currently using the e vac services of
the program," wrote Anne Adelson
'l3 in an email to The Daily. "I may or
may not end up using that program for
Australia [in the fall]."
Dobleman explained that faculty,
staff, students and postdoctoral schol
ars do not need to sign up for the pro
gram as its services are currently avail
able to each of those groups.
