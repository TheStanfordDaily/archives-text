## University hires dean for sexual assault 
### ELLORA ISRANI NEWS EDITOR 
In an effort to complement and centralize
campaigns against relationship abuse and sexu
al assault on campus, the University recently
hired its first assistant dean for sexual assault
and relationship abuse, Angela Exson.
Dean Exson previously served as the assis
tant director of the Women's Leadership & Re
source Center and Campus Advocacy Network
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Accord-

ing to Associate Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Chris Grif
fith, Dean Exson will work pri
marily with "the staff who re
spond to urgent and emer
gency student situations" as
well as the Violence Against
Women (VAW) grant team.
"We created the position to
complement our existing pre
vention, education and re-

sponse structure," Griffith wrote in an email to
The Daily. "Angela's primary responsibility
will be to help provide a coordinated and con
sistent response to sexual violence and rela
tionship abuse."
Exson said personal experience and passion
for her field will define her role.

"I have been working in this field for over a
decade, and I have both a personal and profes
sional commitment to raising awareness, dis
pelling myths and engaging in honest dialogue
to prevent the occurrence of these issues," she
said. "The role of this office will be to provide
education and consultation regarding issues of
interpersonal violence and to deliver a coordi
nated, consistent and effective response."
Both Griffith and Exson individually noted
that the position will be a collaborative one,
meant to integrate itself within the University's
infrastructure and provide resources that fill
current voids. Griffith broke down Exson's role
into three parts: prevention, education and

training.
"[Exson] has served as the pri
mary source of information and
contact for faculty, staff and stu
dents and has conducted training
with those constituencies as well,"
Griffith added.
Viviana Arcia 'l3, president of
the Women's Coalition, noted that
Stanford has already taken many
steps to increase awareness of sexu
al assault and relationship abuse is
sues and to develop more effective
responses. These initiatives have in
volved the Office of Judicial Af
fairs, Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) and the Center for
Relationship Abuse Awareness.
Resident assistants, peer health ad
visors and the Survivors Group,
which Arcia co-founded, complet
ed additional training.
Because these resources often
function autonomously, commu
nication can sometimes be lacking

among the campus organizations
and student groups.
"Dean Exson and her office
will be instrumental in providing
the community with a sort of one
stop resource where students can
be advised of all their options,"
Arcia wrote in an email to The
Daily.
As for specific issues that
Exson's office could address,
Arcia offered two answers: "sensi
tivity training on the part of staff
and campus police" as well as
"campus culture."
"Misogyny and sexism still ex
ists at Stanford," she said. "We can

have these resources and these
amazing administrators, but I feel
like if more safeguards aren't
made against sexism or sexual ha
rassment on the part of students,
then we obviously won't get to the
root of the causes of sexual assault
including same-sex abuse and vio
lence against women."
Exson echoed this concern.
"There is often a great deal of
misinformation and mispercep
tion about these forms of violence
that lends itself to their preva
lence," she said. "This can present
a challenge in response and pre
vention efforts, because there may

be resistance if people feel that
their current knowledge and belief
systems are being tested or invali
dated."
Regardless of the specific ini
tiatives Dean Exson takes at Stan
ford, entrepreneurship and coop
eration could prove to be the cor
nerstones of her work.

"Our efforts will require collab
orative effort, creativity and com
munity accountability," she said. "I
think that all of these ideals are fos
tered and supported here at Stan
ford."

"Our efforts will require
collaborative effort... I think that all of
these ideas are fostered and supported
here at Stanford."
