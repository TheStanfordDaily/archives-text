## Hospital offers daycare compromise to parents Medical Center expansion depends on agreement 
### PHILIP BUI 
Following concerns expressed
by parents whose children's day
care is located near the proposed
Stanford Hospital & Clinics expan
sion, Stanford University Medical
Center has offered to relocate the
daycare to a different on-campus
site for the duration of the construc
tion, according to an announce
ment by Arboretum Parents Group
spokesperson Laura Pisani at Mon
day's Palo Alto City Council meet
ing.
After four years of debate and 96
community meetings, the $5 billion
hospital expansion project, which
Palo Alto Mayor Sid Espinosa
called "the largest development
project in the history of" the city in

a phone interview with The Daily,
was for the most part approved at
the June 6 Palo Alto City Council
meeting. It was delayed at a subse
quent meeting on June 20 when
parents from the Stanford Arbore
tum Children's Center expressed
concerns about air and noise pollu
tion from construction. The day
care is 38 feet from a proposed nine
story parking garage at Hoover
Pavilion.
Community members had previ
ously expressed concerns about the
increased traffic associated with the
Medical Center's expansion and the
potential environmental damage
from the construction process. As
part of the June 6 approval, Stan
ford agreed to pay $175 million to
Palo Alto to address these issues.
This includes $39.2 million for
infrastructure, community develop
ment and sustainability programs as
well as $9l million to current and
new hospital employees over the
next 51 years for Caltrain passes.

The remaining amount was des
ignated to other concerns about en
vironmental and sustainability im
pacts, including the relocation of
many trees in order to reduce the
number needed to be cut down for
the Medical Center's expansion.
Furthermore, some community
members had expressed "visual
aesthetic concerns," said Palo Alto
Deputy City Manager Steve Emslie
in a phone interview.
