## Hospital offers daycare compromise to parents Medical Center expansion depends on agreement 
### PHILIP BUI 
Following concerns expressed
by parents whose children's day
care is located near the proposed
Stanford Hospital & Clinics expan
sion, Stanford University Medical
Center has offered to relocate the
daycare to a different on-campus
site for the duration of the construc
tion, according to an announce
ment by Arboretum Parents Group
spokesperson Laura Pisani at Mon
day's Palo Alto City Council meet
ing.
After four years of debate and 96
community meetings, the $5 billion
hospital expansion project, which
Palo Alto Mayor Sid Espinosa
called "the largest development
project in the history of" the city in

a phone interview with The Daily,
was for the most part approved at
the June 6 Palo Alto City Council
meeting. It was delayed at a subse
quent meeting on June 20 when
parents from the Stanford Arbore
tum Children's Center expressed
concerns about air and noise pollu
tion from construction. The day
care is 38 feet from a proposed nine
story parking garage at Hoover
Pavilion.
Community members had previ
ously expressed concerns about the
increased traffic associated with the
Medical Center's expansion and the
potential environmental damage
from the construction process. As
part of the June 6 approval, Stan
ford agreed to pay $175 million to
Palo Alto to address these issues.
This includes $39.2 million for
infrastructure, community develop
ment and sustainability programs as
well as $9l million to current and
new hospital employees over the
next 51 years for Caltrain passes.

The remaining amount was des
ignated to other concerns about en
vironmental and sustainability im
pacts, including the relocation of
many trees in order to reduce the
number needed to be cut down for
the Medical Center's expansion.
Furthermore, some community
members had expressed "visual
aesthetic concerns," said Palo Alto
Deputy City Manager Steve Emslie
in a phone interview.
Stanford Medic°al Center is ex

pected to add 1.3 million square
feet: 144 additional beds in its main
hospital and 104 beds, new family
rooms and a relaxing "medical gar
den" at Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital. At the city council meet
ings, many Stanford doctors
stressed the importance of the addi
tional space in order to better serve
the community and the growing
population.
"Stanford will be able to build a
world class hospital it needs," Es
pinosa said.
Various community members,
including former San Francisco
49ers quarterback Steve Young,
had expressed support for the pro
posal.
"As a resident of Palo Alto, as
someone who for generations now
for my children and probably
their children have been benefi
ciaries of this hospital," Young said
at the June 6 meeting, "I urge you
to approve this project tonight in a
unanimous fashion."
In addition, the Medical Cen
ter's expansion will allow Stanford

to bring its hospital buildings up to
seismic standards. Currently, Stan
ford's main hospital building is not
up to standards set after the 1994
Northridge earthquake, but the
changes outlined in the current pro
posal should rectify any deficien
cies.
As for the daycare issue, the
University and the parents have
until July 6 to decide whether a
legal injunction on the expansion is
necessary. Many are hoping it will
be resolved amicably and the col
laborative partnership between
Stanford and the Palo Alto commu
nity will continue.
"Over the last two years, we
moved towards a much more col
laborative way of solving the is
sues," said Palo Alto City Council
member Pat Burt.
"The parents want their con
cerns to be met," he added. "Every
one expects the hospital and day
care will be resolved quickly and to
everyone's satisfaction. [We] hope
to have final approval in a week or
two."
Pisani said at the meeting that
the parents' group is "optimistic" a
sufficient solution is in the works.
