## Q&A with new School of Education Dean Steele 
### JENNY THAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After two years as Columbia
University provost, renowned so
cial psychologist Claude Steele will
return to Stanford as dean of the
School of Education, succeeding
current Dean Deborah Stipek on
September 1.
Steele served as a professor of
psychology at Stanford from 1991
to 2009. He was also the director of
the Center of Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity and the Cen
ter of Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences. His research fo
cuses on the individual psychologi
cal experience in domains such as
such as stereotype threat, a social
process that can drastically affect
the experiences and performances
of people belonging to negatively
stereotyped groups.
The Stanford Daily spoke with
Steele over the phone regarding his
new position.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):What
factors influenced your decision to
return to Stanford?
Claude Steele (CS):In a letter I
wrote to my colleagues, I state that
it "was far from an easy decision
perhaps the most difficult of my ca
reer ... the decision to accept the
Stanford offer came down to a diffi
cult-to-pass-up opportunity to play
a role in the field of education at this
critical time in our nation's history."
TSDfWhat are you looking forward
to most regarding your return to the
Farm?
CS:A chance to learn about and
from that School, to learn about the
issues of educational issues and
policies [and about] translating so
cial science and psychological re
search to educational issues and so
cial problems. It's a really rich envi
ronment, and there are really great
colleagues there.

TSD:What are some of the chal
lenges you see in the School of Ed
ucation, and how do you aim to ad
dress them?
CS:Just learning about the School,
that's my first challenge. I hope to
talk to the people in the search
committee. Stanford has a really
great faculty. They're very interest
ed in seeing a closer intellectual
community, so I suspect that's
something that's going to be a pri
ority trying to form that sense of
community. There's also an empha
sis to make [the School of Educa
tion] a strong focus of strong intel
lectual activity on campus a real
center.

TSD:Could you talk a little about
your experience as provost at Co
lumbia? What did you take away
with there?
CSr√üeing provost is a really amaz
ing job. You get to manage the uni
versity. You learn how the universi
ty works financially, what are the
important things in maintaining
their quality, what resources you
have available to ensure that quali
ty is maintained and maximizing
them. It's a privilege of a job to have

that vantage point... The School
of Education at Stanford is already
a very good school, so the first thing
is to do no harm.

TSD:What are some of the biggest
issues in education? Which are the
most urgent?
CS:Education is one of the hotter
topics in society right now: how to
educate our population really well,
to have education that makes us a
competitive society. How do you
have a system that delivers that
kind of education to all of our stu
dents? There are various theories
out there. Democratization of ac
cess to education that's very im
portant.

TSD:How do you feel about your
transition from pure social sciences
research to a program that is more
interdisciplinary and policy fo
cused?
CS:lt's nice to worry less about
basic social science and more about
applying those concepts to larger
societal issues. It's a very natural
thing to move from the Psychology
Department to the School of Edu
cation. I'm very comfortable in in
terdisciplinary settings. When you
spend your life in the social sci

ences, at some point, you want to
see how those social science con
cepts play out in the real world, and
so it's really exciting to come back.
