### JENNY THAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After two years as Columbia
University provost, renowned so
cial psychologist Claude Steele will
return to Stanford as dean of the
School of Education, succeeding
current Dean Deborah Stipek on
September 1.
Steele served as a professor of
psychology at Stanford from 1991
to 2009. He was also the director of
the Center of Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity and the Cen
ter of Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences. His research fo
cuses on the individual psychologi
cal experience in domains such as
such as stereotype threat, a social
process that can drastically affect
the experiences and performances
of people belonging to negatively
stereotyped groups.
The Stanford Daily spoke with
Steele over the phone regarding his
new position.
The Stanford Daily (TSD):What
factors influenced your decision to
return to Stanford?
Claude Steele (CS):In a letter I
wrote to my colleagues, I state that
it "was far from an easy decision
perhaps the most difficult of my ca
reer ... the decision to accept the
Stanford offer came down to a diffi
cult-to-pass-up opportunity to play
a role in the field of education at this
critical time in our nation's history."
TSDfWhat are you looking forward
to most regarding your return to the
Farm?
CS:A chance to learn about and
from that School, to learn about the
issues of educational issues and
policies [and about] translating so
cial science and psychological re
search to educational issues and so
cial problems. It's a really rich envi
ronment, and there are really great
colleagues there.

TSD:What are some of the chal
lenges you see in the School of Ed
ucation, and how do you aim to ad
dress them?
