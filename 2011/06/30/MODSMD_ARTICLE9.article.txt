## University to receive Anderson Collection 
### PIETER ILIASSOV 
Stanford recently accepted one
of the preeminent collections of
post-World War II American art, a
significant private donation known
as the 'Anderson Collection,' that is
expected to make the University a
major destination for art enthusi
asts.
The collection, built over the last
50 years by Harry W. Anderson,
Mary Margaret Anderson and
Mary Patricia Anderson Pence,
consists of 121 paintings and sculp
tures. It is one of the most expen
sive collections to be donated to
any university.
Many had expected the Ander
sons to donate the collection to the
San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, which has been a regular bene
ficiary of the couple. However, the
couple cited public education as a
motive for their unexpected move.
"We have always been closely
associated with colleges and uni
versities, and in making this gift to
Stanford, we anticipate the stu
dents, the public and the entire art
community will have the opportu
nity to fully engage the collection,"
they said in a statement. "Hopeful
ly, this gift makes a great university
greater and the world a grain of salt
better."
The University has announced
that by 2014, it will complete the
construction of a building to house
the collection.
According to Stanford Universi
ty spokeswoman Lisa Lapin, the
Anderson Gallery will be a part of
the new "arts district" adjacent to
the Cantor Arts Center and the
planned McMurty Building for Art
and Art History.
"An exact site plan has not been
determined, but we do hope we will
be able to announce architect selec
tion shortly," she wrote in an email
to The Daily. "Funding for the
building will be from University
sources and is expected to include
philanthropy."
She also emphasized that the
building itself is not included in the
Andersons' gift.
"The Andersons' gift to the
campus comprises works of art, not
a monetary contribution," she
wrote.
Though housing and maintain

ing the pieces will be at a financial
cost to the University, President
Hennessy released a statement
highlighting the educational value
of housing the collection at Stan
ford.
"It will be an honor to own this
beloved collection at Stanford Uni
versity and curate these works in
perpetuity for the benefit of future
generations of students, art schol
ars and the public," he said. "We in
tend to continue the Andersons'
tradition of making great art acces
sible by highlighting the collection
as a key element in our broad arts
initiative at Stanford."
In their statement, the Ander
sons explained that the impetus be
hind the collection came during a
1964 trip to Paris, where they were
inspired by the Louvre's French
Impressionist pieces. They initially
focused on Early Modernists and
Early American Modernists, be
fore shifting exclusively to post-
World War II American art.
Stanford has been intimately in
volved in the collection even prior
to the donation; in the time since its
inception, several Stanford profes
sors and 30 postdoctoral interns
have studied it.
Collection artists include Jack
son Pollock, Helen Frankenthaler,
Franz Kline, Morris Louis, Agnes
Martin, Robert Motherwell,
Nathan Oliveira, David Park, Mark
Rothko, David Smith, Frank Stella
and Wayne Thiebaud â€”B6 indi
viduals in all.
The Andersons described it as a
"collection of collections," given its
inclusion of a range of genres such
as abstract expressionism, color
field painting, post-minimalism,
California funk art, Bay Area figu
rative art, light and space contem
porary painting and sculptures.
"This arrangement with Stan
ford is a momentous occasion for
the Andersons," said Jason Linet
zky, manager of the Anderson Col
lection, in a statement. "It offers
the family their first true opportu
nity to maintain the integrity of the
core collection in perpetuity, to
launch an active and lasting legacy
and to engage the broadest possible
audience all long-held goals."
