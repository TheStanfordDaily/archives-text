The Graduate Student Council
discussed funding, equipment man
agement and future event planning
in their meeting Wednesday at the
Graduate Community Center.
The meeting kicked off with a
discussion over four different
events needing funding. Nandita
Garud, a third-year graduate stu
dent in genetics, represented the
Cross Disciplinary Healthcare In
novation Partnership at Stanford
and asked for funding for the
"health care happy hour" event
planned in August.
"This [event] is a new idea that
we're having," Garud said. "It's
something less formal."
A $3OO food budget was recom
mended for the event, which was
projected to bring in 80 people. The
vote, however, failed to pass with
four in favor of funding the event,
one abstaining and two voting
members asking to table the issue
until the next meeting so they could
better understand the "scope of the
event."

The remaining funding mea

sures, $75 for the Stanford Brewing
Club's beer judging class, $2BO for
the Russian Student Association's
dinner event and $2OO for a cultural
festival in August organized by
Bengalis at Stanford, all passed
unanimously with little discussion.
The meeting continued onto the
topic of equipment and an equip
ment master.

Justin Brown, a fifth-year geo
physics graduate student, intro
duced the issue.

"The old equipment master
he's done," Brown said. "Who's
going to be responsible for the
equipment?"
The issue came to a quick con
clusion when Addy Satija, GSC
housing co-chair, announced that
there was an equipment master
ready to take over in the fall and an
interim equipment master in the
summer.

The last matter for the council
was the July 4 barbeque. GSC co-
Chair Marine Denolle started the
conversation by praising the job
done by the Graduate Student
Council.

"I think it went very well," De
nolle said. "It was very intense be
cause it was actually hard to define
what was supposed to be done."
Due to a problem with leftover
buns and a few complications with
the barbecue, the council proposed
another barbecue event for Bastille
Day, a French national holiday on
July 14.
The bigger issue was about bet
ter planning the next event. Due to
a few complaints that all the mem
bers of the Graduate Student

Council should contribute to orga
nize a better barbecue, Cathy Jan, a
second-year graduate student in
electrical engineering, asked to
plan shifts for the next meeting.
"If we have all these tasks to do,
it's great that all of you showed up,"
Jan said. "Showing up for an hour
isn't going to cut it."
The next meeting of the Gradu
ate Student Council will be in two
weeks.
