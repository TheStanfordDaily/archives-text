## SEEING GREEN Into the Matrix 
### Holly Moeller 
Last week, the United Nations added 18
sites around the globe to its list of bios
phere reserves, bringing the total number
of sites so designated under its Man and the
Biosphere Program to 581.
Most of us are probably more familiar with
another U.N. collection: World Heritage Sites,
which identify "universally" valued spots for
conservation and awareness efforts. Indeed,
some particularly special locales receive both
designations.
But the purpose of biosphere reserves tran
scends basic conservation. The reserves are in
tended to showcase ways that humans can rec
oncile our needs and activities with those of na
tive flora and fauna. They highlight unique and
innovative strategies that are working —right
now.

Although the U.N.'s Program has existed for
more than 30 years, in some ways, these conser
vation ideas merging man with nature, rather
than separating man from it are really just
catching on.
For decades, we've tried strategies like the in
famous "fortress conservation," in which a par
cel of land is hermetically sealed off from human
access. In some cases, this has smacked of neo
colonialism, as the big, bad NGO swoops in to
buy up land and intimidate or bribe indigenous
people into exile.
In the United States, when an endangered
species is critically threatened, we're also willing
to cordon off plots of land, post signage and bar
entry. And in our national parks, where we want
people to enjoy and experience wild nature, we
must still somehow quantify and maintain
"wildness." In Maine's crowded Acadia Nation
al Park, for example, no backcountry hiking is
permitted because there simply isn't enough
backcountry to go around.
Most of us would probably agree that some
if not most closures are for the best. Amid
the extremes of the United States-landscape ma
trix, our preserves stand in stark contrast to the
great homogeneity of com and soy fields, for ex
ample. And because conventional wisdom dic
tates that planetary biodiversity is best preserved
by setting land aside, we have hard goals, like the
Convention on Biological Diversity's aim to
protect 17 percent of terrestrial systems and 10
percent of seascapes.
Simultaneously, our planet faces pressures
from a growing human population with shrink
ing resources. As our numbers swell and our oil
supported capacity for intensive crop produc
tion dwindles, we'll doubtless press more land
into agricultural service. Could you look pover
ty in the eye and demand its land for pristine
rainforest? Could you look hunger in the eye

and close its coral reef for biodiversity protec
tion? I couldn't.

If we could meet our conservation area goals,
though, would that be enough? A decade ago,
Ana Rodrigues and Kevin Gaston reviewed a
score of studies on the land area needed to meet
conservation goals. Their work, published in
Ecology Letters in 2001, found that areal re
quirements could skyrocket up to 66 percent in
some systems. If getting a sixth of an ecosystem
into protection is unlikely, two thirds is probably
impossible.
Since we're not going to secure everything in
the fortress, what else can we do?
Time to remind ourselves that scarcely any
part of the planet exists without human modifi
cation. In fact, some of our most iconic land
scapes were maintained by human activity. The
eastern North American Great Plains, for exam
ple, required periodic burning by Native Amer
icans to retain their "native" grass cover. And
humans evolved in Africa, where we've spent
millennia alongside "wildlife."
So where's the boundary between "us" and
"nature," between "wilderness" and "human
modified?" The extremes are obvious: compare
a distant Pacific atoll to an effluent-packed har
bor. Contrast the drones of pumps in Prudhoe
Bay with the deep silence of an aurora-lit tundra.
But then compare a California rice paddy
with a coastal salt marsh. Given that 90 percent
of California's wetlands have been lost to human
activity, professor Chris Elphick of the Universi
ty of Connecticut has found that rice farms can
make up some of the missing ground. Indeed,
these farms have proved exceptionally speciose:
after some wildlife-friendly management
changes, you can now spot about one in every
five California bird species in a rice field.

And that's where we turn to the U.N.'s Pro
gram and to research around the globe where
humanity is still living or learning to live in
step with nature.
We know that it's possible to overload the
natural system: intensive agriculture, other
worldly "minescapes" and other settings pro
vide evidence of that But we also know from our
evolutionary history, from our recent past and
from the evidence of our contemporaiy eyes,
that humans are fundamentally a part of the bal
ance of nature.

And so we come to the ultimate challenge:
the environmental version of Buddhism's "mid
dle way." If we want to protect biodiversity on a
grand scale, we have to do more than protect it
in discrete, firmly outlined patches. We have to

do it in our own backyards by forgoing
pesticides and growing native plants.
We have to note which species require
human absence, which tolerate some
degree of disturbance and which thrive
in our presence. And we have to create
and maintain a patchwork landscape
allowing for these differences, while
still providing for human needs.
So gather up your ones and zeros,
because the future of conservation is
out in that landscape matrix.

And so we come to the ultimate challenge:
the environmental version of Buddhism's "mid

grand scale, we have to do more than protect it
in discrete, firmly outlined patches. We have to

do it in our own backyards by forgoing
pesticides and growing native plants.
We have to note which species require
human absence, which tolerate some
degree of disturbance and which thrive
in our presence. And we have to create
and maintain a patchwork landscape
allowing for these differences, while
still providing for human needs.

Last week, the United Nations added 18
sites around the globe to its list of bios
phere reserves, bringing the total number
of sites so designated under its Man and the
Biosphere Program to 581.
Most of us are probably more familiar with
another U.N. collection: World Heritage Sites,
which identify "universally" valued spots for
conservation and awareness efforts. Indeed,
some particularly special locales receive both
designations.
But the purpose of biosphere reserves tran
scends basic conservation. The reserves are in
tended to showcase ways that humans can rec
oncile our needs and activities with those of na
tive flora and fauna. They highlight unique and
innovative strategies that are working —right
now.

Although the U.N.'s Program has existed for
more than 30 years, in some ways, these conser
vation ideas merging man with nature, rather
than separating man from it are really just
catching on.
For decades, we've tried strategies like the in
famous "fortress conservation," in which a par
cel of land is hermetically sealed off from human
access. In some cases, this has smacked of neo
colonialism, as the big, bad NGO swoops in to
buy up land and intimidate or bribe indigenous
people into exile.
In the United States, when an endangered
species is critically threatened, we're also willing
to cordon off plots of land, post signage and bar
entry. And in our national parks, where we want
people to enjoy and experience wild nature, we
must still somehow quantify and maintain
"wildness." In Maine's crowded Acadia Nation
al Park, for example, no backcountry hiking is
permitted because there simply isn't enough
backcountry to go around.
Most of us would probably agree that some
if not most closures are for the best. Amid
the extremes of the United States-landscape ma
trix, our preserves stand in stark contrast to the
great homogeneity of com and soy fields, for ex
ample. And because conventional wisdom dic
tates that planetary biodiversity is best preserved
by setting land aside, we have hard goals, like the
Convention on Biological Diversity's aim to
protect 17 percent of terrestrial systems and 10
percent of seascapes.
Simultaneously, our planet faces pressures
from a growing human population with shrink
ing resources. As our numbers swell and our oil
supported capacity for intensive crop produc
tion dwindles, we'll doubtless press more land
into agricultural service. Could you look pover
ty in the eye and demand its land for pristine
rainforest? Could you look hunger in the eye

and close its coral reef for biodiversity protec
tion? I couldn't.

If we could meet our conservation area goals,
though, would that be enough? A decade ago,
Ana Rodrigues and Kevin Gaston reviewed a
score of studies on the land area needed to meet
conservation goals. Their work, published in
Ecology Letters in 2001, found that areal re
quirements could skyrocket up to 66 percent in
some systems. If getting a sixth of an ecosystem
into protection is unlikely, two thirds is probably
impossible.
Since we're not going to secure everything in
the fortress, what else can we do?
Time to remind ourselves that scarcely any
part of the planet exists without human modifi
cation. In fact, some of our most iconic land
scapes were maintained by human activity. The
eastern North American Great Plains, for exam
ple, required periodic burning by Native Amer
icans to retain their "native" grass cover. And
humans evolved in Africa, where we've spent
millennia alongside "wildlife."
So where's the boundary between "us" and
"nature," between "wilderness" and "human
modified?" The extremes are obvious: compare
a distant Pacific atoll to an effluent-packed har
bor. Contrast the drones of pumps in Prudhoe
Bay with the deep silence of an aurora-lit tundra.
But then compare a California rice paddy
with a coastal salt marsh. Given that 90 percent
of California's wetlands have been lost to human
activity, professor Chris Elphick of the Universi
ty of Connecticut has found that rice farms can
make up some of the missing ground. Indeed,
these farms have proved exceptionally speciose:
after some wildlife-friendly management
changes, you can now spot about one in every
five California bird species in a rice field.

And that's where we turn to the U.N.'s Pro
gram and to research around the globe where
humanity is still living or learning to live in
step with nature.
We know that it's possible to overload the
natural system: intensive agriculture, other
worldly "minescapes" and other settings pro
vide evidence of that But we also know from our
evolutionary history, from our recent past and
from the evidence of our contemporaiy eyes,
that humans are fundamentally a part of the bal
ance of nature.

And so we come to the ultimate challenge:
the environmental version of Buddhism's "mid
dle way." If we want to protect biodiversity on a
grand scale, we have to do more than protect it
in discrete, firmly outlined patches. We have to

do it in our own backyards by forgoing
