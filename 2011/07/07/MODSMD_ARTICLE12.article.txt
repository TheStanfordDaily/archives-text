# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## Saving Face 
### Aysha Kureishi 
I never go outside without sunscreen. When
you move to the tropics and suffer horrible
equatorial sunburn a week later, you learn
immediately that a red, peeling face is not an at
tractive one. It's not particularly comfortable ei
ther. Every health and beauty magazine re
leased endorses sunscreen as the "miracle prod
uct" to protect one's face. Celebrities swear
that's how they maintain their doll-like looks
while lines of age inevitably show through the
cracks in their skin. Heck, you can't even buy
makeup without a saleslady waving an SPF
(sun-protection factor) number in your face.
Nowadays, it's all about preserving the youth in
your skin and saving face.
But in Asia, saving face goes much deeper
than sunscreens, hats and SPF ratings. Your
face is the most important element of your ap
pearance. In Asia, your face is much more than
the part of your body that contains your nose,
lips and eyes. To save face actually means to up
hold your social dignity and prestige. Your face
is your honor and respect. Loosing face is not
something that society easily forgives. A sun
burn can be healed in a week, but if you loose
face, it takes ages to climb back up the social and
business ladder if you can get a hand on a
rung at all.
Saving face is not a new concept in Asia. In
feudal Japan, Samurai warriors were expected
to choose death over losing social honor and fre
quently committed the "honorable" rite of sui
cide known as seppuku , which was essentially
self-disembowelment (this can be seen at the
end of Puccini's tragic opera "Madame Butter
fly"). In China, a disobedient woman who
shook the foundations of the Confucian chain of
command could be exiled from her home for
dishonoring her family. As you move farther
east to India, Pakistan and the Middle East, the
face and honor of a family in some religious and
ethnic groups becomes much more significant,
even worthy of murder. The honor of a family is
embodied completely within the sexual purity
of its female members, so much so that murder
ing a daughter or sister who is rumored to be
"impure" is deemed an act of honor, eu
phemistically known as "honor killing."
In everyday life in Southeast Asia, though, you
don't encounter Samurai warriors vowing to com
mit seppuku and other tragedies of the sort. Sav
ing face happens on a more superficial level that
simply causes inconveniences in daily life. For ex
ample, if you walk into a store asking for a
camisole, instead of clarifying what a camisole is
to better help you, the shopkeeper will either turn
you away or enthusiastically show you a lovely
pair of pants. If you are lost and you stop and ask
someone for directions, rather than admitting

that they don't know where your destination is
and thus lose face for their "ignorance," he or she
will point confidently in a random direction and
send you off on a wild goose chase. Once when I
grumbled about this to a Chinese friend, he
laughed and said never to trust anyone who gives
you directions in Asia, because it's inevitable that
you'll end up getting wrong instructions. Also, if
you need to know one thing about saving face, it's
to never say "no" in Asia. That denotes inflexibil
ity, impatience and rudeness. Instead, a passive
"maybe" or "I'll look into it" does the trick. So
does a one-word "yes."
Just recently, I went to the Chinese embassy in
Singapore to get a visa for an upcoming trip. I told
the guard at the gate that I was here to submit my
visa application documents. He pulled out a pam
phlet titled "How to Apply for a Chinese Visa"
and gave it to me. I explained that I had all my
documents done and needed to submit them to
the embassy for approval. He said, "yes." I asked
if I could go in. He said, "yes." We stared at each
other blankly for a few minutes as I waited for him
to open the gate. When it was clear that he wasn't
going to move, I then asked if I was at the right
place. He said, "yes." I asked if I was at the wrong
place. He said, "yes." Then I asked if he under
stood what I was saying. He said, "yes."
Saving face is taken so seriously in Asia that
the Chinese even have a hand motion for saying
someone has lost face. Slide your index finger
down across your face from your ear to the corner
of your lips in one quick, brushing motion. But
never, ever do this to an adult. Why not? Because,
of course, both you and he will lose face. You, be
cause you openly criticized someone and bluntly
accused him of losing face in a childish way, and
he, because someone publically called him out for
losing face. It's a lose-lose situation.
The way to maintain your face in Asia is tanta
mount to being polite in North America or Eu
rope. Simply, don't lose your cool in public and
don't put someone down. Also, paradoxically, if
you point out someone else's mistake, not only do
you make that person lose face, but you also lose
face for your social blunder. Just follow that age
old rule we all learned in kindergarten: if you can't
say something nice, don't say anything at all.
So when you venture onto the streets of South
east Asia, don't forget your map, your sunscreen,
your hat and your SPF (Self Preservation of
Face). A sunburned face isn't an attractive one.
Neither is a lost one.

to open the gate. When it was clear that he wasn't
going to move, I then asked if I was at the right
place. He said, "yes." I asked if I was at the wrong
place. He said, "yes." Then I asked if he under
stood what I was saying. He said, "yes."
Saving face is taken so seriously in Asia that
the Chinese even have a hand motion for saying
someone has lost face. Slide your index finger
down across your face from your ear to the corner
of your lips in one quick, brushing motion. But
never, ever do this to an adult. Why not? Because,
of course, both you and he will lose face. You, be
cause you openly criticized someone and bluntly
accused him of losing face in a childish way, and
he, because someone publically called him out for
losing face. It's a lose-lose situation.
The way to maintain your face in Asia is tanta
mount to being polite in North America or Eu
rope. Simply, don't lose your cool in public and
don't put someone down. Also, paradoxically, if
you point out someone else's mistake, not only do
you make that person lose face, but you also lose
face for your social blunder. Just follow that age
old rule we all learned in kindergarten: if you can't
say something nice, don't say anything at all.
So when you venture onto the streets of South
east Asia, don't forget your map, your sunscreen,
your hat and your SPF (Self Preservation of
Face). A sunburned face isn't an attractive one.
Neither is a lost one.

I never go outside without sunscreen. When
you move to the tropics and suffer horrible
equatorial sunburn a week later, you learn
immediately that a red, peeling face is not an at
tractive one. It's not particularly comfortable ei
ther. Every health and beauty magazine re
leased endorses sunscreen as the "miracle prod
uct" to protect one's face. Celebrities swear
that's how they maintain their doll-like looks
while lines of age inevitably show through the
cracks in their skin. Heck, you can't even buy
makeup without a saleslady waving an SPF
(sun-protection factor) number in your face.
Nowadays, it's all about preserving the youth in
your skin and saving face.
But in Asia, saving face goes much deeper
than sunscreens, hats and SPF ratings. Your
face is the most important element of your ap
pearance. In Asia, your face is much more than
the part of your body that contains your nose,
lips and eyes. To save face actually means to up
hold your social dignity and prestige. Your face
is your honor and respect. Loosing face is not
something that society easily forgives. A sun
burn can be healed in a week, but if you loose
face, it takes ages to climb back up the social and
business ladder if you can get a hand on a
rung at all.
Saving face is not a new concept in Asia. In
feudal Japan, Samurai warriors were expected
to choose death over losing social honor and fre
quently committed the "honorable" rite of sui
cide known as seppuku , which was essentially
self-disembowelment (this can be seen at the
end of Puccini's tragic opera "Madame Butter
fly"). In China, a disobedient woman who
shook the foundations of the Confucian chain of
command could be exiled from her home for
dishonoring her family. As you move farther
east to India, Pakistan and the Middle East, the
face and honor of a family in some religious and
ethnic groups becomes much more significant,
even worthy of murder. The honor of a family is
embodied completely within the sexual purity
of its female members, so much so that murder
ing a daughter or sister who is rumored to be
"impure" is deemed an act of honor, eu
phemistically known as "honor killing."
In everyday life in Southeast Asia, though, you
don't encounter Samurai warriors vowing to com
mit seppuku and other tragedies of the sort. Sav
ing face happens on a more superficial level that
simply causes inconveniences in daily life. For ex
ample, if you walk into a store asking for a
camisole, instead of clarifying what a camisole is
to better help you, the shopkeeper will either turn
you away or enthusiastically show you a lovely
pair of pants. If you are lost and you stop and ask
someone for directions, rather than admitting

that they don't know where your destination is
and thus lose face for their "ignorance," he or she
will point confidently in a random direction and
send you off on a wild goose chase. Once when I
grumbled about this to a Chinese friend, he
laughed and said never to trust anyone who gives
you directions in Asia, because it's inevitable that
you'll end up getting wrong instructions. Also, if
you need to know one thing about saving face, it's
to never say "no" in Asia. That denotes inflexibil
ity, impatience and rudeness. Instead, a passive
"maybe" or "I'll look into it" does the trick. So
does a one-word "yes."
Just recently, I went to the Chinese embassy in
Singapore to get a visa for an upcoming trip. I told
the guard at the gate that I was here to submit my
visa application documents. He pulled out a pam
phlet titled "How to Apply for a Chinese Visa"
and gave it to me. I explained that I had all my
documents done and needed to submit them to
the embassy for approval. He said, "yes." I asked
if I could go in. He said, "yes." We stared at each
other blankly for a few minutes as I waited for him
to open the gate. When it was clear that he wasn't
going to move, I then asked if I was at the right
place. He said, "yes." I asked if I was at the wrong
place. He said, "yes." Then I asked if he under
stood what I was saying. He said, "yes."
