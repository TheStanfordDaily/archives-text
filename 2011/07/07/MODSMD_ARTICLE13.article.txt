## SOCCER SHOWCASE S.J. EARTHQUAKES VISIT STANFORD STADIUM 
### KEVIN ZHANG RACHEL WOLFARD 
School may be out for the Cardinal faith
ful, but the team's usual home of Stanford
Stadium was buzzing with activity last Satur
day. It wasn't for a football game, the venue's
main event, and there were no national teams
or popular European squads in sight. Instead,
fans in the Stanford area came out in droves to
see the San Jose Earthquakes (5-5-6) play the
New York Red Bulls (5-3-10) in a nationally
televised Major League Soccer contest over
Independence Day weekend. San Jose squan
dered a late lead and settled for a 2-2 tie.

The match, which the Earthquakes relo
cated from the traditional Buck Shaw Stadi
um in Santa Clara, saw a crowd of 41,208
the largest ever for a non-doubleheader in the
Earthquakes' history.
The stadium change surprised many fans
when it was announced last April, but the
added exposure and publicity of the Stanford
hosted event seems to have paid off, accord
ing to the team.
"With more people, there was more elec
tricity," said San Jose Earthquakes President
Dave Kaval '9B MBA "03. "Being at Stanford
also enables us to have fireworks after the
game and is an opportunity for fans all over
the Bay Area to watch the Earthquakes."
Given Kaval's background, the decision to
move the game to Stanford may have been as
much about loyalty as business. Besides being
a Stanford alumnus, Kaval is a Cardinal foot
ball season ticket holder and says he enjoyed
working with the Stanford staff to make the
transition possible.
"As a season ticket holder, I believe that
Stanford Stadium is a hidden gem in the Bay
Area," Kaval said. "Having this marquee
matchup here is an opportunity for people to
see this. The Stanford staff has been tremen
dous to work with, and we would love to come
back."

Kaval has memories of Stanford's role in
the 1994 FIFA World Cup, when a then-larg
er Stanford Stadium was one of nine venues to
host the event in the U.S. and one of only
two on the West Coast.

"As an alumnus, I want to create new his
tory as Stanford did 17 years ago with the
World Cup," Kaval said. "That is why we
[honored] '94 World Cup players at half

time."
Former Team USA players Tab Ramos,
Thomas Dooley, Marcelo Balboa, Paul
Caligiuri, Fernando Clavijo, Mike Sorber,
Juergen Sommer, Cobi Jones and John
Harkes were on site Saturday evening, almost
17 years after their 1-0 loss to Brazil in the
Round of 16 at Stanford on July 4,1994.
When the pregame festivities outside Stan
ford Stadium concluded and the game got un
derway, the large crowd quieted early. In just
the seventh minute, Red Bull forward Joel
Lindpere put in the first goal of the game from
the outskirts of the 6-yard box.

It wasn't until the 37th minute that the
Earthquakes leveled the playing field with
midfielder Khari Stephenson's unassisted

goal. The Red Bulls and the Earthquakes en
tered halftime with a 1-1 tie.
In the 68th minute, San Jose took the lead
after forward Steven Lenhart split two Red
Bull defenders and hammered in a header
goal off of an assist from teammate Steven
Beitashour.
Toward the end of the game, the Red Bulls
picked up the intensity with back-to-back at
tempted shots on goal. San Jose goalkeeper
Jon Busch saved the first attempt and ener
gized the crowd as he blocked the second in
order to hold onto the lead. His efforts would
n't hold up, however, as Lindpere took con
trol of an assist from Red Bull forward Mehdi

Ballouchy and scored his second
goal of the game in the 85th minute
to put the score where it would end,
at 2-2.

Going into the match, one of the
other draws of the contest was
French national team player and
Red Bull forward Thierry Henry.
However, Henry was not present
during the match due to a red card
suspension.

Taking his place was Ballouchy,
a graduate of both Palo Alto's
Henry Gunn High School and
Santa Clara University.
"It was awesome," Ballouchy
said. "I went to school five minutes
from here. I went to college 20 min
utes from here. It's a special place
to play soccer."

Members of the Earthquakes
were also pleased with the atmos
phere and crowd at Stanford.
"It was fantastic [to be at Stan
ford]," said San Jose head coach
Frank Yallop. "I think the players
warmed up to the crowd a bit after
seeming a bit nervous in the begin
ning of the game. It is always tough
to play in a new stadium, because it
doesn't feel like home. But toward
the end of the game, it felt like home
and it was a great for everybody."

Lenhart noticed several differ
ences between Stanford Stadium
and Buck Shaw, the current home
for the Earthquakes.
"[The roar of the crowd at Buck
Shaw compared to Stanford] is like
a double-double at In-N-Out ver
sus a Big Mac," he said. "It was fun.
I wish I went to school here."
