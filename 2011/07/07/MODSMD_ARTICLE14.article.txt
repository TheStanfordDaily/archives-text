# DON'T PAY PLAYERS
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
We all know about Stan
ford's 34 varsity sports,
101 NCAA champi
onships and 17 Direc
tors' Cups. But maybe
the most impressive way to describe Car
dinal athletics is with a big fat zero.
According to a Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) report late last month, Stanford is
one of only four schools in an Automatic
Qualifying Conference and the only
one west of the Mississippi —that has
never recorded a major NCAA rules vio
lation.

That's something to be proud of, espe
cially in an athletic environment that's
hearing increasing calls for an end to colle
giate amateurism. In early June, South
Carolina coach Steve Spurrier, with the
backing of several other big-name SEC
coaches, introduced a pay-for-play pro
posal for football players that would in
clude a moderate $3OO stipend per game.
It would also break NCAA rules.
But let's not kid ourselves. Benefits are
already being doled out albeit improp
erly to star players nationwide; just ask
USC or Ohio State, or 62 of the 66 AQ
teams for that matter.

So what's the point of stemming the
Tide (Alabama: five infractions)? Is pay
ing college athletes something that should
have happened Sooner (Oklahoma:
seven infractions)? If almost everyone's
breaking the rules, shouldn't we join in the
fun too, and just grin and Bear (Cal: seven
infractions) the immorality of it all?
Or is pay-for-play even immoral in the
first place?

Advocates for plans such as Spurrier's
claim that players aren't getting their fair
share of the profits they help create. A six
figure scholarship over four years is nice,
yet it pales in comparison to the $7O mil
lion that a school like Texas makes on
football alone each season.

Let's clear up one thing, right off the
bat. Rule-breaking institutions have al
ways had their own interests in mind, not
those of the recruits. USC didn't want to
improve the financial situation of Reggie
Bush's family; it wanted to win football
games.

But even from an altruistic, give
players-what-they-deserve stand
point, what about the athletes that
aren't pulling in any money? It's well
documented that the overwhelming
majority of NCAA revenue comes
from football and men's basketball;
other sports are lucky to profit at all.
And if the goal is to align player pay
with the revenues they generate, then
athletes in the so-called "country
club" or "Olympic" sports which
are much harder to make a living in
post-graduation would be hung out
to dry. In away, the problem has al
ready manifested itself in major
NCAA violations, which surround
football 55 percent of the time, accord
ing to the WSJ report.
What's more, paying players would
present a host of logistical issues. One
of the best things about college athlet
ics is that it's completely devoid of all of

the revenue-sharing drama that's com
monplace in professional leagues. But
if they paid players, schools would
have to decide how big a slice of the
revenue pie they would be willing to
give up. And the possibility of —dare
I say it an NCAA lockout just isn't
fair to young players looking to devel
op their skills.
With the players under contract
and open bidding wars breaking out
for top recruits, the NCAA would be
forced to again mimic professional
leagues with a salary cap. Though it
would sure be fun to watch certain
cash-strapped, Division-I state schools
(particularly one in the East Bay)
struggle to keep up with the growing fi
nancial burdens that would be placed
on legitimate big-sport contenders, a
salary cap would be the only hope of
maintaining any parity in college ath
letics. But then, athletes would be
turned away from schools which had
so many other things going for them
just because their payroll exceeded
NCAA limits. By leveling the playing
field, the necessary salary-cap step
would neglect the one thing that truly
separates college and pro sports: the
college part.

And that's where Stanford comes
in. Coaches and administrators here
always talk about how Stanford sells it
self, how recruits are drawn to the
school by its world-class education.
Learning would have no value in a sys
tem that sold 18-year-old athletes to
the school that writes the biggest
check. So if you're concerned by sto
ries of top-tier athletes failing classes,
abandoning their education after two
years or ending up on the wrong side of
the law, then pay-for-play is not for
you.

Stanford's clean record doesn't just
indicate that the athletic department
can follow rules. It's also a reflection of
the value we place on a wide variety of
sports and the important role we give
education, even for student-athletes.
There's no need to institute pay
for-play to legitimize the misbehavior
of all but four major institutions in this
country. There's a right way to play
and win the game of college sports,
and Stanford knows just how.
