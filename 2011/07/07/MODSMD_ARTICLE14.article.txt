# DON'T PAY PLAYERS

We all know about Stan
ford's 34 varsity sports,
101 NCAA champi
onships and 17 Direc
tors' Cups. But maybe
the most impressive way to describe Car
dinal athletics is with a big fat zero.
According to a Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) report late last month, Stanford is
one of only four schools in an Automatic
Qualifying Conference and the only
one west of the Mississippi â€”that has
never recorded a major NCAA rules vio
lation.

That's something to be proud of, espe
cially in an athletic environment that's
hearing increasing calls for an end to colle
giate amateurism. In early June, South
Carolina coach Steve Spurrier, with the
backing of several other big-name SEC
coaches, introduced a pay-for-play pro
posal for football players that would in
clude a moderate $3OO stipend per game.
It would also break NCAA rules.
But let's not kid ourselves. Benefits are
already being doled out albeit improp
erly to star players nationwide; just ask
USC or Ohio State, or 62 of the 66 AQ
teams for that matter.

So what's the point of stemming the
Tide (Alabama: five infractions)? Is pay
ing college athletes something that should
have happened Sooner (Oklahoma:
seven infractions)? If almost everyone's
breaking the rules, shouldn't we join in the
fun too, and just grin and Bear (Cal: seven
infractions) the immorality of it all?
Or is pay-for-play even immoral in the
first place?

Advocates for plans such as Spurrier's
claim that players aren't getting their fair
share of the profits they help create. A six
figure scholarship over four years is nice,
yet it pales in comparison to the $7O mil
lion that a school like Texas makes on
football alone each season.

Let's clear up one thing, right off the
bat. Rule-breaking institutions have al
ways had their own interests in mind, not
those of the recruits. USC didn't want to
improve the financial situation of Reggie
