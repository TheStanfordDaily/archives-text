# Dawkins signs two-year extension
## 
### â€” Joseph Beyda 
Stanford announced yesterday that men's bas
ketball head coach Johnny Dawkins had signed a
contract extension through the 2015-16 season. His
previous contract, a six-year deal, was set to expire

before the 2013-14 season.
Entering his fourth year at the helm of the Cardi
nal program, Dawkins has a 49-48 record, including
a 20-win season in 2008-09 that saw Stanford reach
the semifinals of the College Basketball Invitation
al. He brought in a top-20 recruiting class last season
to help fill the void left by the departures of the
Lopez twins in 2008 and Landry Fields in 2010.
Dawkins helped develop Fields into a second-round
pick and starter for the New York Knicks and looks
to do the same with Pac-10 All-Freshmen honorees
Anthony Brown and Dwight Powell during their
sophomore seasons.
His successes off the Farm include a 2008
Olympic gold-medal run, serving as Player Person
nel Director, and an 11-year stint at Duke under
world-renowned coach Mike Krzyzewski. Dawkins
was also Duke's all-time leading scorer with 2,556
points from 1986 until 2006, when J.J. Redick, a
player of his, beat that record.
