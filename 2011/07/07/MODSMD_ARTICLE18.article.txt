# NEW CUP NOT AS PERFECT AS OTHERS
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I'm a better person than you.
Or at least, if you're an arts
student, my undergrad de
gree counts for more than
yours. When I compare the
successes of classmates, I see my fel
low science or technology friends
have landed well-paying jobs in fi
nance or consultancy whereas the
more socially oriented are stuck
working for NGOs. Based purely on
future monetary success, art degrees
are a waste of your time, your parents'
money and perhaps even your univer
sity's resources.
I hasten to add, before I get a land
slide of abuse, that I don't actually
agree with the above statement, but
it's the best way I could sum up in an
academic context my interpretation
of what is becoming an easy target for
abuse by Daily columnists: the Capi
tal One Cup. I do see some of the ar
guments behind an alternative to the
Directors' Cup; since Stanford basi
cally has the largest college athletics
program in the country, it is almost a
shoo-in.
But be careful what you wish for.
Patriotic friends of mine stand by

the argument that America is a class
less society, and while the raw statis
tics contradict this assertion, I have to
admit that the underlying intention is
good. The statement "all men are cre
ated equal" from the Declaration of
Independence is not just a memorable
phrase but should be a guiding princi
ple behind any system of government.
The Capital One Cup's version of
this quote is "every championship
counts," but though the words might
sound a little similar, the raw ideology
is very different. Glossing over the
fact that the statement is not true
some NCAA championships actually
don't count â€”it reminds me much
more of a quote from George Or
well's satirical book about the Russ
ian Revolution, "Animal Farm": "All
animals are equal, but some animals
are more equal than others."
It's not quite as catchy, but in the
interest of honesty, perhaps the Capi
tal One Cup's organizers should try:
"Most championships count, though
some count more than others."

The changes in the ranking system
from the Directors' Cup might seem
relatively benign, but before throw
ing your support behind this new
award, it is worth considering what its
long-term impact could be. Universi
ties are generally ideological bubbles
where equality rules far more than it
does in the outside world. You study
what you study because of raw inter
est rather than monetary greed, and
students from all backgrounds and
subjects mix freely as equals. College
athletes, regardless of the future job
prospects in their chosen discipline,
should be treated the same.
