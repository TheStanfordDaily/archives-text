Here we go again. An
other month, another
story about the illegal
exploits of a college
football program.
This time, it's the Oregon Ducks,
who apparently used a recruiter
named Will Lyles to funnel top
prospects to Eugene in exchange for
$25,000.
And while it's not particularly
shocking to find out that a top pro
gram may have been bending the
rules in order to win football games
Ohio State, Auburn and USC come
to mind the recent allegations
levied against Oregon could be a dis
aster for a program that appears to be
on the cusp of national prominence

for the next decade or more.
For the last 10 years, the Ducks
have been steadily climbing up the na
tional rankings thanks to some good
coaching, great recruiting and the
deep pockets of Nike's Phil Knight, an
Oregon alumnus. The Ducks got just
one Pac-10 title between 1957 and
1999, but they have captured four
conference championships since 2000
and made their way to three BCS
bowls in that time, including last
year's national championship game.
But now the Ducks have to deal
with the fact that their rise to success
may have been augmented by some il
legitimate recruiting, and Oregon
