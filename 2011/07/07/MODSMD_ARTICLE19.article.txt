# MISTAKES WILL COST THE DUCKS
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Here we go again. An
other month, another
story about the illegal
exploits of a college
football program.
This time, it's the Oregon Ducks,
who apparently used a recruiter
named Will Lyles to funnel top
prospects to Eugene in exchange for
$25,000.
And while it's not particularly
shocking to find out that a top pro
gram may have been bending the
rules in order to win football games
Ohio State, Auburn and USC come
to mind the recent allegations
levied against Oregon could be a dis
aster for a program that appears to be
on the cusp of national prominence

for the next decade or more.
For the last 10 years, the Ducks
have been steadily climbing up the na
tional rankings thanks to some good
coaching, great recruiting and the
deep pockets of Nike's Phil Knight, an
Oregon alumnus. The Ducks got just
one Pac-10 title between 1957 and
1999, but they have captured four
conference championships since 2000
and made their way to three BCS
bowls in that time, including last
year's national championship game.
But now the Ducks have to deal
with the fact that their rise to success
may have been augmented by some il
legitimate recruiting, and Oregon
fans should be considering just how
damaging the consequences might be
if they get slapped with several years
of probation and scholarship restric
tions from the NCAA.

When big football schools like
USC, Ohio State, Oklahoma or Al
abama are penalized for their wrong
doing, everybody in the college
sports world knows that the program
will be right back at the top when the
restrictions are lifted because, well,
they're USC (or Ohio State or Okla
homa or Alabama). These big pro

grams always succeed not only be
cause they can always lure in top re
cruits with a 100,000-seat stadium
and a trophy room filled with Heis
man statuettes and national titles, but
also because they can count on their
boosters to support them through
thick and thin.

But Oregon doesn't have that
same legacy of success to support it,
and that means that the punishment
that may be awaiting the Ducks could
be much more problematic than it
would be for a more established pro
gram.

Sure, the Ducks will still have their
swimming pool full of gold coins
courtesy of Phil Knight to help them
continue to upgrade their already
ridiculous facilities and attract top

tier recruits, but that doesn't mean
that Oregon won't suddenly become
old news after a couple of years out of
the spotlight. Consider the example
of new Pac-12 member Colorado.
The Buffaloes were a perennial con
tender for the Big-12 title during the
90s and early 2000s, but the Buffaloes
have had just one winning season
since a major recruiting scandal sur
faced in 2004.

Another factor that could nega
tively affect the Ducks is that the top
program in the Pac-12, USC, will be
coming off probation at the same
time. Because the Ducks have been
on their steady uptick for the last few
years, they now compete for a lot of
recruits against the Trojans, but if
Oregon is facing serious penalties

from the NCAA while USC is unfet
tered, the Trojans could quickly re
gain their dominant position in the
Pac-12.

Although it's probably too early
to speculate about the conference's
future power structure considering
that Oregon hasn't even been pun
ished for its recruiting malfeasances,
a world where USC is perched firm
ly atop the Pac-12 is just the picture
that the Ducks (and everyone else in
the conference, for that matter)
have been trying to overcome for
years. But thanks to USC's national
prominence and on-field success
over the past decade, it's well
equipped to rebound and fill any
void that the Ducks would leave
atop the Pac-12 the hallmark of a

powerhouse program.
So while Oregon has worked hard
and recruited well (maybe a little too
well) to reach this point, the potential
ramifications of its actions could
leave the Ducks where they started
over a decade ago looking up the
standings in the Pac-12 but with a
new set of questions to answer. In
stead of asking themselves what it
would take to get to the top, head
coach Chip Kelly and the Ducks
might be wondering what could have
been and that could be the most
bitter pill to swallow.
