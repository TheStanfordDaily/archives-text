This Utopia isn't perfect, because
there isn't an endless supply of re
sources and money, and so not all
sports can receive either varsity status
or NCAA recognition. But the inten
tion is good.

Or at least it was. There have al
ways been motives for concentrating
solely on the big sports not least,
the TV revenue they bring in but
the Capital One Cup turns the screw
even further on the little sports. The
Cardinal might be well-advised to
drop the six men's and six women's
varsity teams absent from the cup's
rankings in favor of creating new
teams to better suit this competition,
or perhaps to simply pour the savings
into the football program. Maybe that
is what other schools have been doing
for years, shirking sporting diversity
in search of success in just one big
money discipline, and maybe this ex
plains why Stanford traditionally has
struggled to compete at the very top
of the football hierarchy.
Even smaller sports actually in
cluded in the Capital One Cup might
be at risk. Men's lacrosse is worth
twice as much as golf, and so it would
make competitive sense to sacrifice
the latter in order to make space for a
new varsity team of the former. Can
you imagine if that had happened a

few years ago? Whatever you think of
either his sport or his private life, it is
hard not to feel some kind of respect
for the achievements of Tiger Woods
and a little bit of pride that one of his
tory's most iconic sportsmen went to
Stanford.

Smaller colleges whose athletics
programs are limited to a football or
basketball program may find a signif
icant advantage in this new ranking
system, but the larger and more var
ied athletics departments will almost
certainly lose out. Many student-ath
letes may find their sports disappear
ing before their very eyes as attention
shifts to the more important, i.e. high
er point-scoring, disciplines. The
breadth of the college sporting world
will surely narrow.
On its website, the NCAA claims
that it was formed "to protect stu
dent-athletes," but through its affilia
tion with this new championship
Capital One is an official "Corporate
Champion" of the NCAA it
seems to be doing the very opposite.
