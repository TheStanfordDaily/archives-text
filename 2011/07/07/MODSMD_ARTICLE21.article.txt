## SWINGING ON Silk Students flip for aerial fabrics classes 
### STEPHANIE YOUNG 
Tucked away in a back room of
the Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation, the
rock climbing wall exists, un
beknownst to many students.
But for students in the aerial fabrics
class, this rock wall is their home base, a
place where they twist, twirl, pull, stretch
and hang upside down multiple times a
week.
Aerial fabrics, described as "equal
parts grace, strength and adrenaline, and
100 percent Cirque Du Soleil," on the
Stanford Athletics Physical Education,
Recreation and Wellness website, is nei
ther an official Stanford varsity nor a
club team. Rather, the troupe holds of
fice hours, hosts aerial fabrics classes at a
variety of skill levels and performs in
shows the group's most recent expo
sition, the Aerial Fabrics Showcase
2011, took place in early June at the rock
climbing wall.
Also called aerial tissue or aerial
skills, aerial fabrics is a more recent phe
nomenon in the aerial arts and has
steadily grown in exposure and popular-

ity in mainstream culture per
formance artist, Pink, featured
these aerial silk skills in her 2010
Grammy performance. Rooted in
the circus arts, aerial fabrics has
been adapted from a highly special
ized skill to one that complete be
ginners can attempt with relative
ease. The once extremely stretchy
materials the type that the Stan
ford group still uses have be
come more rigid and less stretchy,
making the fabric much more ac
cessible to beginners and more eas
ily adapted for yoga and condition

al training.
Professionals usually know the
basics of static trapeze, aerial hoop
and rope in addition to aerial fab
rics but chooses to specialize in one
of the disciplines. Artists usually
have at least some previous dance
training or gymnastics on their re
sume, however, the group at Stan
ford hosts classes that assume no
background whatsoever.
For Sommer Panage 'OB M.S.
'O9, an instructor for both the aeri
al fabrics class at Stanford and at
the San Francisco Circus Center, a
class she took at Stanford as an un
dergraduate sparked her interest in
the art. Currently working at
Apple as a programmer, she still
trains and teaches almost every
day.

"Aerial arts has gotten me into
the best shape of my life," Panage
said, noting that "there's nothing I
love doing more than hanging up
side down 30 feet in the air getting
ready for a big drop or dancing my
way up and down a rope to my fa
vorite song."
Though she doubts that she'll
ever pursue the circus arts profes
sionally, Panage plans to continue
training, practicing and performing
in the foreseeable future.

Though safety is a concern for
many Panage does acknowl
edge that there isn't much in terms
of harnesses and lines because they
get tangled in the silk careful
habits and training, such as practic
ing low to the ground and the use of
mats, can make the art of aerial fab

rics a relatively secure hobby.

The various aerial fabrics classes
at Stanford, particularly the intro
ductory class, are designed for a two
fold purpose, according to Panage.
The first goal is to introduce stu
dents to the circus arts, the most fa
mous example being Cirque du
Soleil. The second is to encourage
students to pursue aerial fabrics as a
way to improve strength and flexibil
ity a typical aerialist can whip out
10 to 20 pull-ups, 50 v-ups and 50 to
100 pushups in addition to perform
ing the splits and a backbend and
to engage the muscles in the body in
a dynamic manner.
The beginning class teaches stu
dents how to climb and perform
tricks on the silk, but couples those
more awe-inspiring features with

the importance of stretching,
ground conditioning and safety. In
the intermediate level, students are
taught the basics of routine choreo
graphing with music. For the more
advanced students, students who
have trained outside of Stanford,
the silks at Arrillaga offer an av
enue to practice their skills on cam
pus. All of the classes have grown
in popularity and interest.
And according to Erica Lieber
man 'l4, one of the teaching assis
tants for the beginning aerial fab
rics class, the training comes with
an additional bonus.

"You're pretty much guaran
teed a six-pack," she said.
