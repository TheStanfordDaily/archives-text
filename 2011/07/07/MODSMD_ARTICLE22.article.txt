## ZELDA FROM TWIN PEAKS? NOT AS STRANGE AS IT SOUNDS 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
I always knew that Shigeru Miyamoto, the
video game luminary behind Mario and
Zelda, drew his inspiration from unusual
sources. No, not giant mushrooms Shigs is
famous for turning banal facets of his everyday
life into some of the most fantastical experi
ences in gaming. Mario was the name of his
landlord, Pikmin came from working in his
garden and Zelda was inspired by his child
hood trips to rural Japan.
Zelda fans like myself, however, owe credit
to an even less-predictable source of inspira
tion.

It turns out the TV drama "Twin Peaks"
played a small but important role in Zelda's
development as Miyamoto guided the series to
its golden age in the midst of the Clinton years.
According to interviews leading up to E3 and
the 25th anniversary of the series, Miyamoto

made David Lynch's anti
quated serial drama such a

water-cooler topic at the
office that he and long-

time series creators
Takashi Tezuka and

Eiji Aonuma could hard
ly help its influence from
creeping into their games.

Even by Shiggy's standards, that revelation
warrants a few head scratches or raised eye
brows. I've seen a few reruns of "Twin Peaks"
myself, and I'm not sure how schoolyard mur
ders, campy humor and creepy one-armed
dudes translate into the bright and quirky land
of Hyrule.

But if we zoom out a bit and take these
gentlemen's words at face value there's a
reasonable justification, both vague and specif-

ic, for "Twin Peaks" having a right
ful place in the Zelda-verse.

"At the time [we made
Link's Awakening], 'Twin
Peaks' was rather popular,"
Tezuka explained at a recent

"Iwata Asks" discussion. "The drama was all
about a small number of characters in a small
town ... I wanted to make something that,
while it would be small enough in scope to eas
ily understand, it would have deep and distinc-

tive characteristics."
"I thought, 'You really want to make
Zelda like that?!'" Aonuma said in response.
"Now the mystery is solved (laughs). When I
was reading Tanabe-san's comments in the
strategy guide, I saw, 'Tezuka-san suggested we
make all the characters suspicious types like in
the then-popular "Twin Peaks.'""
If you've played Link's Awakening, you'll
know it as a major turning point for the series
that took Link out of Hyrule, ditched Ganon
and the Triforce, and broke the fourth wall
whenever it could. Characters like Marin and
the shopkeeper aren't what they seem, and the
secrets hinted at by the Owl and the Ocarina
keep players guessing at what mysteries may be
lurking just under the surface. The isolated,
quirky setting of Koholint Island suspends the
player's disbelief; this isn't Hyrule, anything
could happen here. The main draw of Link's
Awakening and the legacy that's earned it a
couple remakes and re-releases isn't so dif
ferent from the sense of wonder that kept
viewers coming back for the next episode of
"Twin Peaks."

But that's an exceptional example, isn't it?
Link's Awakening is remembered fondly, but it
falls outside what many gamers consider the
"core" of the Zelda series. Surely the anchors of
the entire franchise games like "Ocarina of
Time" are immune to such outlandish

influences.
Nope.
It took a bit of a paradigm shift, but I'm
actually surprised at how natural it feels to view

Ocarina through this new lens. Most of its pre
sentation is basic, and its compelling material
comes more from the player's imagination
than the game itself. Mysterious characters fit
right in with that dynamic, and their low-res
textures and voiceless dialogue only add to the
player's personal concept of who they are.
And ultimately, the series is better for it.
We think of Zelda as an epic experience, but in
so many ways it's really not it's a simple
story with classic setup. It's not the clash of
nations or Patrick Stewart voiceovers that
bring us back again and again, but our own
sense of wonder and imagination. A game like
Zelda gives us just enough backstory to send
our childish dreams downstream and just
enough freedom to flesh them out with eddies
of our own design, emergent byproducts of an
interactive medium that feel epic for their con
text and intimate for their detail.
Given how much we cling to great games
as beacons of true originality, it's funny to see

some of the biggest names in the
industry talk candidly about their
inspirations from obscure or unre
markable parts of everyday life. But
if you're willing to accept that
games, like anything else, are part
of a back-and-forth exchange of
creative ideas, it makes the devel

opment process itself that much
more inspiring: men like
Miyamoto, of course, have no
communion with gaming gods that
spark billion-dollar ideas into their
minds. They're not crazy people,
drug addicts or geniuses. They're
normal people like you and me,

and the fact that they can deftly
translate a family vacation or a day
in the garden into a moving, engag
ing experience is damned impres
sive.
