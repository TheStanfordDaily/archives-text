## '4' sophisticated 
### â€” andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
A big, bold and brave performer, Beyonce
Knowles is known for her over-the-top
vocals, incredible stage presence and, most
of all, her ability to seemingly produce a hit on

command, whether it be in collaboration with oth
ers (see Destiny's Child, or, more recently, her
2010 hit "Telephone" with Lady Gaga) or on her
own ("Single Ladies," etc.) However, Queen B lays
quiescent in "4," the artist's fourth solo studio
album. Instead, Beyonce seems to take the road

less traveled, masterfully exploring the themes of
both individualism and romance in what proves to
be a more nuanced and sophisticated collection
than her previous work.
Beyonce's last two albums "B'Day,"
released in 2006 and the two-part 2008 album, "I
Am ... Sasha Fierce" solidified her status as a
powerhouse, stocked with chart-topping, club
dominating hits that had Beyonce all over the
radio and wowing crowds with her energetic live
performances. However, "4" reflects the strategic
move of a woman who already has a strong fan

base and uses this certainty to give her the freedom
to try something a bit different.

In fact, as far as commercialism is concerned,
"4" doesn't begin to compare to Beyonce's previ
ous albums. Frankly, there might be two Top-20
hits in the dozen songs "4" is composed of, but
Beyonce very clearly did not entirely write the
album for the profits it would bring in. Instead,

the vulnerability first introduced in the slower, impassioned "I
Am ..." half of her third album reemerges in "4." Beyonce is
all grown up now and takes the time to reflect more on what
she's experienced than what she has yet to do.
Ironically, where Beyonce falls flat is in attempts at her
previous style. The first single of "4," "Run the World (Girls),"
features uninspired lyrics albeit an empowering message
haphazardly thrown over the popular electro-hit "Pon de
Floor" by Major Lazer. Another upbeat attempt, "Party," also
disappoints; though the addition of Andre 3000 adds to the
song, Beyonce simply doesn't bring enough of the raw vocal
energy she usually delivers to her more popular tracks, leaving
"Party" strangely suspended between her upbeat and slower
songs.

Unexpectedly for many, her exploration with deeper top
ics comes with remarkable success. Though the songs are

more sentimental, Beyonce generally brings power to each and
every one of them, creating an album full of successfully varied
sound and thoughtful songwriting. One of the best songs of
the album is the first, "1+1," a slow ballad very obviously writ
ten about her hubby, rapper and music mogul Jay-Z. Beyonce
expresses some lyrical poeticism, singing, "7 don't know much
about algebra/But I know I+l =2/And it's me and you/That's all
we'll have when the world is through." The best by far, though, of
"4" is "I Was Here," the second-to-last song and final ballad, in
which she contemplates the power and humanity of the individ
ual, simultaneously delivering a particularly fantastic vocal per
formance.

"4" might not feature Beyonce's traditional barrage of hits,
but it's a wise album, expressing a more thoughtful side of a
woman usually seen as a larger-than-life personality.
