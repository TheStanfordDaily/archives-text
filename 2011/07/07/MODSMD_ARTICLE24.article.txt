## Humans, plot take back seat in 'Transformers'

Director Michael Bay's conclusion to the iconic robot trilogy
"Transformers" lives up to summer-blockbuster expecta
tions, using stylized special effects to mask a thinly devel
oped plot that, while much more understandable than its predeces
sor, is unable to surpass the 2007 hit that started it all.
Like the previous summer hit "X-Men: First Class,"
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon" features a clever appropriation
of American history, asserting that the true intention of Apollo 1 l's
mission to the moon was to investigate the crash site of what turns
out to be former Autobot leader Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard

Nimoy), who fled the robots' home planet Cybertron in order to
protect a valuable new technology from the antagonistic
Decepticons. The findings of Apollo 11 disappeared into the recesses
of classified government intelligence, only to reemerge in the present
day when the Decepticons begin searching for the long-lost ruins,
which may hold the key to restoring Cybertron. Human protagonist
Sam Witwicky (Shia Laßeouf), now a job-hunting college graduate
we can all relate to, gets sucked back into global conflict when his
Autobot friends become locked in battle against the
Decepticons with the fate of the Earth at stake.
Reprising his role as the neurotic, accidental mediator
between humans and robots, Laßeouf flaunts his fast-talking
comedic ability like a frat-boy version of Jesse Eisenberg, but
compared to the other films in the franchise, has relatively
less material to work with. Surprising and often humorous
cameos include John Malkovich, Frances McDormand,

Patrick Dempsey and Ken Jeong, but in the end, most of the
human characters feel unnecessary. Going back to its Hasbro
roots, Transformers is, at heart, a story about robots in dis
guise and, whether intentionally or not, Bay's latest film
reflects this. For despite the efforts made at interweaving the
human and robot narratives, by the end of the climactic bat
tle sequence, it seems quite clear that the real star is Optimus
Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen).
While many have been panning model Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley's acting chops as the Sexy Girlfriend, a
franchise staple, I found her comparable to Megan Fox, who
starred in the first two films. But whereas Fox's tomboyish
Mikaela was semi-plausible as a romantic interest for the
socially awkward Witwicky, Huntingon-Whiteley perpetually

looks like she stepped out of a Victoria's Secret ad, thus ren
dering the relationship almost farcical. And if rumors about
Fox's departure in conjunction with Bay's demands for an
overdy sexual performance are true, then I don't blame her.
Huntington-Whiteley is consistendy objectified and exploit
ed, being leered at not only by the camera but also by every
single male character including the Decepticons.
In true Michael Bay fashion, quick-cutting action and
grand explosions abound, which I would argue make the 3D
viewing experience worth the extra cost. While the humans
and their world still look slighdy less than perfectiy realistic,
the CGI and the transformers themselves are simply stun
ning. Live-action, 3D cinema technology may not have quite
hit its stride yet, but Bay makes highly effective use of it.
An instructor once told me that sequels rarely trump
the original and are almost always made for financial gain.
While this is almost certainly true of "Transformers," the
film never pretends to be more than what it is. Just sit back,
relax and let the high-budget, fast-paced action wash over
you.
