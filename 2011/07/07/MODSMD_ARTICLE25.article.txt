## Bentley's back

Just in case any (read: all) of you readers
haven't been faithfully watching "The
Bachelorette" for two hours a week, let me
introduce you to the man whose absolute scum
baggery has defined this season: a fine young
lump of human slime by the name of Bentley.
Bentley is that guy your mom warned you about
when you went off to college, telling Ashley to
her face that he had real feelings for her and then
turning to the camera and laughing about how
she was ugly, stupid and "haha, oh man, totally
falling for it!" He confounded me for every
episode that he showed up in, because his levels
of cruelty were so ridiculously, unrealistically evil;
at first, I thought the show had put him up to

playing with her mind, but if that were the case,
they wouldn't have had him leave the show early.
It remains a mystery.

Anyway, this episode was a big deal because
Bentley, after leaving the show three episodes ago,
returned for more screen time. We all assumed
that the producers had made him come back to
confess to Ashley that he didn't actually have feel
ings for her so she could stop freaking talking
about him every second of every episode, but to
my surprise, Bentley kept up his lies but for
the first time, Ash saw through them! I very, very,
very briefly felt a flicker of respect for her.
After Bentley, the episode was mostly forget
table and involved a lot of the 'Borings' (the suit
ors whose names and faces are unremarkable to
the point that I've had to come up with
mnemonic devices to remember them). The first
one-on-one date was with Southern Gent; the

group date involved Dragon Racing and paired
up Constantine and Ben F., which was inconve-

nient because I have never been able to tell them

apart. Blake, the festering sack of turds that loves
to badmouth the others behind their backs, was
finally sent home. He was confused; 1 was tri-

umphant. People complained about things that
weren't worth complaining about. Ash got inse
cure and cried. Yawn.

Since nothing much happened this episode,
I've decided that I need to spend some time on
Ames, because I find him infinitely and uninten
tionally hilarious. Ames is intended to be the

token intellectual, the manifestation of all that
"smart is sexy" jargon, and yes, he's charming,
but oh my god he is impossible to
take seriously. Everyone knows and
loves an 'Ames;' he's that guy in

your friend group that everyone
loves to give a hard time. Any
attempt at seriousness or charm will
be met with a resounding "SHUT
UP, AMES" from the crowd. He's
the guy who, when the suitors all
had to fight each other, got saddled
with the hot pink uniform and then
proceeded to get the living hell
kicked out of him and had to go to
a hospital in that same little pink
uniform. You love him in the same
way you would love a particularly
ugly pug: with affection, with pro
tectiveness and with not a hint of
romance. Unfortunately, nobody
seems to have told him that,
because in this episode, he tried to
be suave. He pulls Ashley into the
elevator, winks knowingly and
presses the button for the highest
floor (shut up, Ames). He goes in
for a tremendously awkward kiss;
she giggles and he hushes her (shut
up, Ames). The elevator doors
open and someone goes to enter;
Ames sort of herds them away while
still trying to maintain James Bond
status (for the love of God shut up,
Ames). I literally could not breathe
for laughing.
Tune in next week, when
Ashley will be crying about boys in
Taiwan.
