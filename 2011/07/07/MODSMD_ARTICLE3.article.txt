### ELAINA KOROS INTERN 
Graduate School of Business (GSB) pro
fessor emeritus Gerald Meier J.D. '66, an
early expert in development economics and
advocate for attention to developing coun
tries, died June 21 from complications related
to a malignant brain tumor. He was 88.
Meier, who taught at the GSB from 1962
to 2005, co-authored "Leading Issues in Eco
nomic Development," one of the first books
about economic development in America
and introduced Stanford's first course on the
economics of less-developed countries, after
then-GSB dean Ernie Arbuckle *33 MBA '36
recruited him to strengthen the program.
Through teaching undergraduates as well
as students in the GSB and Stanford Law

School, Meier became a prominent professor
and mentor to young people. From checking
in with former students to hosting reggae par
ties at his home, Meier connected with his stu
dents on a unique level.

"The main thing is ... how much he loved
students," said his son Andrew Meier. "He
taught generations of Stanford students and
he really enjoyed both his undergraduate and
graduates. I don't know how many GSB pro
fessors taught undergrads, but one thing he
loved doing was his sophomore seminar."

Meier wrote 34 books and over 50 articles
in scholarly journals. He often spoke over
seas, presenting to leaders of less-developed
countries and participating in global conven
tions. He also served as a consultant to the
World Bank.

"A prolific writer, Jerry was also a creative

teacher who encouraged me to spread my
wings in the classroom and bring globaliza
tion to life for GSB students," said former
GSB professor Peter Henry, in a statement
Andrew Meier provided to The Daily. "I am
sorry to see him go, but his legacy of intellec
tual curiosity, kindness and good humor will
stay with me always."

Meier, who was also a former Rhodes

Scholar, received his B.A. from Reed Col
lege, a B. Lift, from Oxford University and his
Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1953. Be
fore joining the Stanford community, Meier
taught at Harvard, Oxford, Williams College,
Yale University, the University of West In
dies, the University of Sussex and Wesleyan

University, where he introduced the first
university-level course in development
economics.

"Not many business schools are con
cerned with poverty and the reduction of
poverty," Meier said during the GSB's
75th anniversary celebration. "Stanford,
I'd say, is one of the few."
"Jerry will be missed by a huge num
ber of his admirers like me," said Harvard
economics professor Amartya Sen, in the
statement Andrew Meier provided to
The Daily.
Raised on the West Coast, near Seattle
and Tacoma, Washington, Meier devel
oped a love for the outdoors from an early
age. He enjoyed biking, swimming, being
near the beach, visiting the track shop and
working out at the gym, where he knew
all of the football coaches by their first
names.

A father of four sons David,
Daniel, Jeremy and Andrew and hus
band of 57 years to Gretl Slote, Meier
made his family, which saw his passion
firsthand and enjoyed hiking and spend
ing family summers abroad with him,
first.
