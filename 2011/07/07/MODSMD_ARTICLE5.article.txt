## VPUE launches Faculty College Initiative intended to foster multidisciplinary courses 
### HIROKO SUNAMARA INTERN 
Six teams of Stanford professors will focus on
creating innovative, team-taught curricula as part
of the 2012 Faculty College, unveiled by Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam at the Faculty Senate's June 9 meeting.
By providing the space, time and resources for
multidisciplinary education, Elam said he hopes to
revolutionize the concept of teaching itself at Stan
ford in a response to globalization.
"Twenty-first century education means re
sponding to the fact that students have changed
and we need new methodologies for reaching
them; that the world has changed and we need new
methodologies for connecting our students to it,"
he wrote in an email to The Daily. "Stanford needs
to keep evolving, to teach in ways that our stu
dents, and the global community, relate to."

The six main initiatives include the Ethics of
War Project; the Division of Literatures, Cultures
and Languages Project; the Electrical and Envi
ronmental Engineering Track Project; the Net
works Project; the Bioengineering Undergraduate
Design Project and the Arts Structured Liberal
Education Project.

Elam stressed collaboration as integral to each
initiative.

"What we're doing here is providing a different
and potentially unique platform for such proj ects,"
he said. "We're allowing faculty from across disci
plines to work collaboratively, to bounce ideas off
of each other and put the emphasis on undergrad
uate education."

"As we developed the idea of Faculty College,
certain projects surfaced as ones that would be

ideal for the first Faculty College class," he wrote.
He added that the projects chosen are reflections
of the individuals in the Faculty College class,
"stretching across schools from Law to Humani
ties and Sciences."

French and Italian associate professor Dan
Edelstein will work with biology Deborah Gordon
M.S. '77 and computer science professor Eric
Roberts on the "Networks Project,"
entitled "Social Animals, Social Revolutions and
Social Networks."

"Rather than simply trying to get students to
take more humanities classes, we tried to come up
with classes that already address some of the more
scientific issues that students are interested in [and
to] show how there is an important humanistic di
mension to those classes or topics," Edelstein said.
"One of the ideas we came up with was 'social
network,' which at the beginning we were going to
call 'From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg'... the idea
being that there's a long history to judicial network
and that it didn't just all start with Facebook," he
added.

Each team leads an initiative and is to meet col
lectively with its affiliates a minimum of two or
three times per quarter.

Col. Joseph Felter Ph.D. 'O5, senior research
scholar at the Center for International Security
and Cooperation, will work on the Ethics of War
project. His teammates include political science
professor Scott Sagan, philosophy professor
Debra Satz, senior Law School lecturer Allen
Weiner J.D. 'B9 and School of Medicine professor
Paul Wise.

Felter suggested there is a need for a broad
grasp of topics in the undergraduate community.
"So many of this century's greatest challenges
will require interdisciplinary approaches to under
stand and address," he said. "Today's students will
be better prepared to contribute to these efforts if
