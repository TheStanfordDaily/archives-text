## Cigarettes target black youths, study says 
### HARINI JAGANATHAN INTERN 
The leading menthol cigarette manufacturer
in the United States may be targeting its adver
tisement campaigns toward African American
youths, according to a School of Medicine study
recently published in the Nicotine and
Tobacco Research journal.

The study found that Newport, the leading
menthol cigarette, is also the most popular
brand among African-American smokers and
the second most popular brand among young
smokers. Author Lisa Henriksen, a senior re
searcher at the Stanford Prevention Research
Center, said she conducted the study in order to
supplement a body of studies that examine cig
arette-marketing techniques directed toward
certain demographics but do not include re

search on African Americans or youths.
"I worked on the FDA report about menthol
and noticed that there were few studies about
price, strategic marketing and price-vulnerable
groups who smoke menthol cigarettes, so that
was the reason for going back and looking at the
data," she said in a phone interview with The
Daily.

The study found evidence contradicting
claims made by Lorillard, Inc., the manufactur
er of Newport cigarettes, to the Food and Drug
Administration that it does not base availabili
ty of promotions on race or ethnicity.

"This evidence contradicts the manufactur
er's claims that the availability of its promotions
is not based on race/ethnicity," the study said.
The study examined data about advertise-
ments, promotions and pack prices
for Newport and for Marlboro, the
leading non-menthol cigarette.
Trained observers and researchers
looked at these factors in 407 stores
within walking distance from 91
high schools across California.

Flenriksen said the most chal
lenging part of completing the
study was data collection and ob
taining cigarette pack prices.
The study found that advertise
ments and promotions for New
port cigarettes were more likely to
be found in neighborhoods with a
higher proportion of African-
American students. The advertised
pack prices for Newport cigarettes
were also lower in those same
areas. These patterns did not ap
pear for non-menthol cigarettes.
Flenriksen emphasized that the
study found that cigarette manu
facturers target not only African

Americans, but also youths. She
called Lorillard's marketing
"predatory" in a statement to
Reuters.

"I hope [the research] will call
attention to the tobacco industry's
use of advertising and promotion
to target vulnerable groups and en
courage the FDA to consider that
evidence in banning menthol," she
said to The Daily.
Congress passed The Family
Smoking Prevention and Tobacco
Control Act in 2009, which per
mits states and communities to de
velop restrictions on the time,
place and manner of tobacco mar
keting. This act also banned a
number of cigarette additives in
cluding candy, fruit and spice be
cause of their possible appeal to
youth, but the question of a men
thol ban fell to the FDA, which
has the power to ban menthol cig
arettes under The Family Smok
ing Prevention and Tobacco Con
trol Act.

Stanford Law professor Robert
L. Rabin felt that the results of this
study could influence a future men

thol ban.
"The principal manufacturer of
menthol cigarettes, I think some
thing like 85 percent of their busi
ness is in menthol cigarettes, [is]
going to continue to lobby very
hard not to have a menthol ban,"
Rabin said. "There's lots of pres
sure on the other side. Stuff of this
kind is likely to increase pressure to
get menthol banned as an additive
in cigarettes."
Rabin also added that limiting
the ways that cigarette manufactur
ers can market is "more complicat
ed."

Henriksen said that she plans to
continue researching similar issues
on a broader scale. She recently re
ceived a grant from the National
Cancer Institute to examine tobac
co industry marketing in a sample
of stores across the nation.

"I hope I'll have some opportu
nity to look at this problem in a
larger, more representative sam
ple," she said.
