## 79 students still without housing 
### HAELIN CHO INTERN 
79 undergraduates who entered the Draw still
do not have housing for fall quarter ahead of the
waiting-list assignments that will come out July
23.
According to statistics on the Stanford Hous
ing Department website, there have historically
been students unassigned every year. The num
ber is down from 89 undergraduates in 2009 and
122 in 2010.
Nevertheless, some unassigned undergradu
ates are still finding the process frustrating.
According to Aaron Peterson 'l3, being left
without a housing assignment hinders some as
pects of his summer before junior year.
"I think it [the waiting-list process] absolutely
disadvantages us because we're starting off with
out the security of knowing where we're living,
and we just have to go through a whole, arduous
process that we weren't expecting or told about,"
Peterson said.
He added that he would rather be worrying
about classes and internships than his housing sit
uation.
According to Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney, the consistent group
of unassigned students is a product of the balanc
ing act between meeting the four years of guaran
teed housing for all undergraduates as well as ac
commodating the "significant number of cancel

lations over the summer."

"Student Housing is charged with
allocating enough housing to under
graduate students to meet this guar
antee while still keeping our housing
fully occupied," he wrote in an email
to The Daily. "Doing so makes the
best use of our facilities and allows
Stanford to accept the maximum
number of freshmen and transfer
students."
"Vacancies come from students
who decide to take a leave of ab
sence, are suspended or get accept
ed late to overseas-studies pro
grams," he added. "If we assigned
all students during the Draw, we
would open autumn quarter with a
significant number of vacancies,
and fewer students would be able to
attend the University."
Will Monroe T3, who is also
unassigned, is optimistic that the sit
uation will work itself out, despite
complaints about the wait list.
"The main thing that was disap
pointing was the news that we
couldn't keep our Draw group to
gether," Monroe said. "Even if we
get our bottom choice, it'd still be
cool as long as we [the Draw group]
can stay together. But since we can't
stay together, we're a bit worried
about what our housing situation is

going to be like next year."
The housing-assignment process
involves three different "rounds":
the Draw, the waiting list and con
tinuous assignments. If unassigned
after the first draw, students go on
the waiting list to wait for housing. If
they are still unassigned after the
second round, students go into con
tinuous assignments.

Shortly before the July 3 waiting
list-ranking deadline, Housing an
nounced that it had added Oak
Creek Apartments, which abuts
Stanford campus, to the list of resi
dences students may rank. Howev
er, Housing is also "currently con
sidering some additional projects to
build new undergraduate housing,"
Whitney said.
"There will probably be no addi
tional housing ready for occupancy
for at least two years," he wrote.
"We will meet our obligation to the
guarantee and have all undergradu
ate students with guaranteed years
remaining assigned by the end of
the first week of autumn quarter, if
not before."
Both Monroe and Peterson men
tioned that more clarity on the
Housing Department website could

help students on the waiting list fig
ure out the application process. Ac
cording to Monroe, the Housing
Department website could be more
helpful if the information were pre
sented more explicitly.
"It's a nightmare trying to find
the dates, the deadlines," Monroe
said. "They're hidden within, like,
three layers of pages that I have to
see when I've got to submit these
forms and stuff."

Housing, however, disputes
those claims about the website.

"We are in the process of revis
ing our site at this time, but the feed
back we generally receive is differ
ent from what you have heard,"
Whitney wrote. "What we have
found is that we have extensive in
formation on the website, but that
students do not always successfully
navigate deep enough into the of
ferings, causing them to sometimes
miss important details."
