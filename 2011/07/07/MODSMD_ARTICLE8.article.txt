## Obama chooses Stanford for high-tech initiative University one of six in Manufacturing Partner ship 
### HENRY ZHU 
Stanford is one of six universi
ties involved in the federal gov
ernment's Advanced Manufac
turing Partnership, an initiative
that aims to help create high-tech
manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
and boost the development of ad
vanced technologies. With assis
tance from the government, mem
bers of the group, which also in
cludes a group of U.S. companies,
are set to invest more than $5OO
million is research, development
and education over the next year.

President Barack Obama an
nounced the partnership June 24
at Carnegie Mellon University's
National Robotics Engineering
Center, located in Pittsburgh,
Penn., in front of representatives
from the six involved universities

Carnegie Mellon University,
UC-Berkeley, Georgia Institute
of Technology, MIT, University
of Michigan and Stanford.

The initiative is derived from a
recommendation by the Presi
dent's Council of Advisors on Sci
ence and Technology (PCAST),
which focuses on investment in
new and advanced technologies.
"In the last five months, the
PCAST has studied administra
tive actions to promote advanced
manufacturing," said Professor
Thomas Kenny, who represented
Stanford at the event, in a phone
interview with The Daily. "It pub
lished a report a few weeks ago;
the recommendation was that the
administration should have a new,
funded initiative that will consist
of partnerships between universi
ties and industries to promote
technologies, new design method
ologies and educational tools."

Obama also invited to the an
nouncement various government
agencies including the Depart

ment of Defense, the National
Science Foundation, the National
Institute of Standards and Tech
nology and the Department of
Energy as well as top execu
tives from large private-sector
manufacturing companies
among them Intel, Ford Motor
Co., Procter & Gamble, Johnson
& Johnson, Floneywell and Dow
Chemical.
Universities such as Stanford
were included in the initiative to
settle concerns that efficient prac
tices favored by corporations
could lower the demand for work
ers, decrease wages and worsen
the unemployment rate. The uni
versities' role is to foster an innov
ative environment and produce
both the tools and the skilled
workers to revolutionize manu
facturing.
"Stanford was pleased to par
ticipate [in the partnership] be
cause President Obama's initia
tive matches the mission of the
University, which is to advance in

novation through research and
education," wrote Stanford
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin in an
email to The Daily.
Part of that, Kenny said, is be
cause of the people on campus.
"Stanford is comprised of edu
cators, researchers, innovators
and leaders," he added.
Stanford's participation in
Obama's initiative will not re
quire a direct investment on the
University's part in the short
term. Already-existing facilities
dedicated to innovative manufac
turing, such as the Center for Inte
grated Systems, will wait for a se
ries of program-funding an
nouncements from government
agencies.

It can also write proposals to
organizations such as the Depart
ment of Energy, the Department
of Commerce, the Department of
Defense and the National Science
Foundation, in order to bring
