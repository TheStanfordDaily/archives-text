# Environment more important than genetics in autism risk
## 
### â€” Haelin Cho 
According to a recent study by researchers at the
UC-San Francisco and Stanford on autism in twins,
environmental factors are more predictive of autism
risk than genetic factors. The study found that envi
ronmental factors make up 62 percent of the risk of
autism while genetics, originaly thought to have been
90 percent, make up 38 percent.

The study was published in the Archives of Gener
al Psychiatry and was called the "largest, and the most
diverse [study] to look at twins" by The San Francisco
Chronicle. The study included 192 twins, both frater
nal and identical. The rate of identical twins with dual
autism was shown to be lower than predicted, and the
rate of fraternal twins with dual autism was higher.
Another study examining 298 autistic children in
the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system
and published in the same issue showed that the risk
for autism doubles with the use of antidepressants in
pregnant women. With autism rates estimated at one
percent of the children in the United States, scientists
are hoping these findings will help expand research of
the disorder.
