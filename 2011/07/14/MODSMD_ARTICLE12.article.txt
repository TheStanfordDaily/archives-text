## SEEING GREEN The 						Devil in the Digital? 
### Holly Moeller 
I've got to be honest. Graduate student life
conies with awesome perks: flexible
schedules, fun-loving coworkers and
amazing travel opportunities. But the green
eyed monster occasionally peers over my
shoulder.

It visited last week, while I flipped envi
ously through photos that my cousin, Jason
Moeller, had posted on his blog for the Na
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis
tration's (NOAA) Teacher at Sea program.
I'd been following his three-week adventure
aboard a pollock research vessel in the Gulf
of Alaska whenever I wasn't reading about a
friend's fieldwork in Greenland, getting up
dates on another's research in New Zealand
or Skyping with a classmate studying am
phibians in Costa Rica.
When I finally got back to work on my
own research, one thought lingered (along
side the envy): today's technological ad
vances let us live vicariously through the lives
of others more than ever. Those of us well
connected in the field can blog and email
every day. Even the most remote colleagues
send off updates, photos and videos with the
weekly supply helicopter.
Many scientific organizations have taken
advantage of this opportunity to merge sci
ence and education in modernized outreach
programs. Of course, no matter how upbeat
and entertaining a writer my cousin is (espe
cially impressive as he battled seasickness),
neither he nor any other similar writer will
have as many followers as, say, Lady Gaga's
Twitter account. But each effort reaches
someone —or some dozens —who knew
nothing about Alaska's pollock fishery, melt
ing on the Greenland ice sheet or other such
work.

It's on this principle that the Chester Zoo
in the United Kingdom founded its "Act for
Wildlife" site, highlighting global conserva
tion efforts linked to the hometown zoo. At a
time when youngsters seem more interested
in the Internet than the outdoors and adults
believe in conservation but rarely back their
feelings with finances, the zoo hopes that
bringing a personalized touch onto the living
room computer will inspire the next genera
tion of environmental philanthropists.
After reading about Chester Zoo's pro
ject, I asked my cousin (who coordinates ed
ucation efforts at the Knoxville Zoo when
he's not off gallivanting shipboard) what he
thought. Jason reminded me that a likely

goal of any zoo is to first to reach people in
person, actually getting them through the
doors to experience the animals firsthand.
But if the zoo can enhance that experience,
or expand its audience, using social media
and a well-designed web presence, so much
the better.

Each year, major zoos around the world
receive about 620 million in-person visits.
Some of the visitors like some of my col
leagues— find their calling in the experi
ence, pursuing careers in conservation or bi
ology as a result. Others, myself included,
need something more.
For me, "more" was a childhood hiking
through New Jersey's parks and preserves, a
college romance with a budding ornitholo
gist who proved you could make a living
doing what you loved and a field summer in
southeast Alaska.

I feel incredibly fortunate to have had
these and other experiences. The
world is getting smaller as humanity gets big
ger, and perhaps no part is shrinking faster
than the wilderness. While most people in
the United States will have zoo access at
some point, few will visit Alaska or hike the
High Sierras, and only a handful will conduct
research on the open Pacific or in the African
savannah.

In the age of viral You Tube lion-croco
dile tug-of-war clips and BBC's Planet Earth,
can good luck and elegant cinematography
transmit some of the magic these experiences
bring to those who have seen them in per
son?

I've seen many still and moving pictures
of things I will never witness in person. Some
motivated travel plans; others elicited a
"wow" and were filed away in memory. I'm
glad to have seen them all. I've also read
blogs and books on science, wildlife and
wilderness. Some passages have given me the
same chills I get when I stand before the
ocean or beneath a 1,000-year-old redwood.
Yet these chills stem from memory, from a
commonality of experience.
The irony perhaps a fortuitous one
is that as wilderness shrinks, and as, report
edly, our schoolchildren spend less time out
doors "in nature," we're better than ever at
transmitting awe-inspiring experiences that
most of those children would never have
seen otherwise.

But will my cousin's new lesson plans in
corporating his NOAA field days replace

long afternoons with fishing lines at
the local lake? Will an IMAX video
of a wildebeest stampede stand in
for robins tending a backyard nest
each spring?
I don't think we'll lose our sense

of awe in some ways, we'll prob
ably be more impressed than
ever. But I worry that we'll con
tinue to separate ourselves from
nature, a divide that's neither
"natural" nor healthy. I worry
that one day, Planet Earth
footage will evoke the same
sepia-tinged nostalgia that
Woodstock clips do. Because
we'll no longer remember it for
ourselves.

On Sunday, I thought these
sad thoughts while kayaking
through Elkhorn Slough, some 45
miles from Stanford. But it was
impossible to stay melancholy for
long amid flocks of seabirds and
rafts of sea otters. That's what
experiencing nature does for me.
