# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## Singlish Damn Good Walao!

£ £ ~w~ ""W~i, I'd like a coffee, please."

"Si mi!"
"Coffee."
"Kopi mail!"
"What?"
"Kopi-O can?"
"What is kopi-O!"
"Kopi-O! Ger, wai so gabra lah? Kopi-O
kopi no milk!"
"Oh! Yes, that's fine."
"So kopi-kosong den."
"What?"

In a country where English is one of four of
ficial languages, spoken by 80 percent of the
population, I find I still need a dictionary in Sin
gapore. The conversation above is one I recent
ly had while trying to buy a coffee from a local
kopitiam (coffee shop). After a few more ex
changes like this, I finally understood what the
sweet, old Chinese lady behind the counter was
asking me. "Si mi" was actually a simple
"what?" "Kopi" means coffee. " Kopi-O " is cof
fee with no milk, and " kopi-kosong " is plain cof
fee. It took me a while to figure out "Ger, wai so
gabra lah!" and when I did, I couldn't help but
laugh at the irony. The lady was asking me "girl,
why are you so confused?" To be honest, I'm
still confused. Because I was speaking English.
And so was she. So why couldn't we understand
each other?

In Singapore, there are actually two different
types of English: "proper" English, and what's
called "Singlish" (Singapore + English =
Singlish). Although the government highly dis
courages Singlish, it is still widely spoken be
cause, in general, even for a modern, effective
and efficient government like Singapore's, it's
pretty difficult to effectively discourage a prima
ry method of communication. In that kopitiam,
I spoke "proper" English. The lady was speak
ing "Singlish."
Singlish is not held in high regard in Singa
pore. It's often taken as a sign of low social
standing and low prestige. But at the same time,
it's something that Singaporeans can't help but
hold dear to their hearts. Locals will excitedly
ask me if I can speak Singlish and be disappoint
ed when I admit I cannot. Singlish is often the
central comic theme of local TV shows, and Sin
gaporeans themselves will make fun of the lan
guage. But at the same time, the two versions of
English don't only act as a language barrier, but
also as a social one. Someone who can speak
Standard English is higher up on the social and

business ladder than someone who
speaks Singlish, which is viewed as a patchy lan
guage used by those who can't communicate in
the "high-class" language, English. This made
me think why in the world in the year 2011 is
one language in a highly advanced country con
sidered better than another? And then the an
swer hit me like a running jibra. It's simply be
cause the language of a land reflects its culture.
Singapore was under British rule for 146
years (between 1819 and 1965). According to
Frantz Fanon, a psychiatrist and revolutionary
20th-century writer, the relationship between
the colonizers of a nation and those being colo
nized is one of veneration, hate and envy. Fanon
argues that the colonizers portray themselves as
higher class, so at the same time, the colonized
hate and envy the colonizers. The colonized
hate that they have been pushed down to sec
ond-class citizens in their own land but, at the
same time, strive to climb up in society in the
quickest way possible. Fanon theorized that the
way to climb the societal ladder would be to
adopt the habits and practices of the "higher"
class. In the case of Singapore, that meant imi
tating the colonizers, including learning "prop
er" English. Even today this mentality contin
ues, both consciously and subconsciously.
Other Asian languages also reflect their re
spective cultures. In Vietnam, where bike thiev
ery is rampant, there is no Vietnamese word for
"stolen." Instead, if you wish to report a stolen
bike to the authorities, you are obliged to
humbly explain (to save your own face and the
face of your fellow citizen who happened to
steal your bike) that "my bike is missing." On
the other hand, in Urdu (a language spoken in
Pakistan and India), there is no word for a neu
tral "missing." If something is actually missing,
it's either your own fault for losing it or someone
else has stolen it. Combine this with the Asian
idea of saving face, and it just so happens that
everyone is stealing everything from everyone
else. Or so it would seem.

Singapore, a mish-mash of different cultures,
has its own unique language that reflects that cul
tural diversity - a mish-mash language of so much
more than just Hokkien, Malay, Bhasa, Can
tonese and Tamil roots. To pick one Asian lan
guage and stick with it would be a slur on the Sin
gaporean prestige: an island nation in the middle
of the South China Sea completely unlike its
neighbors speaking primarily the language of an
other nation would indicate association with that

nation. So, to get around this issue,
Singapore chose to have four official
languages: Standard English,
Chinese, Malay and Tamil.
Consequently, Singapore hasn't
identified with one single country or
culture. But, through language, it
identifies with many.

Language doesn't only allow us
to communicate it also express
es culture. But then what about the
issue when multiple cultures speak
the same language? The Spanish
word " agarrar " means "to hold" in
Spain, but if you u agarrar"-ed
someone last night in Mexico, it
means something much more inti
mate. In Spain, you can " coger"
(catch/take) a bus, but you for sure
don't want to " coger " a bus in
Mexico or Latin America, because
that actually means to f — a bus. In
the U.S., Americans think "loo" is
a girl's name, and the British are
confused why it's called a "bath
room" if there's no bath in it! The
British know that a line is an object
in two-dimensional space, and the
Americans know that a "queue" is
the 17th letter of the alphabet. We
call it "English," but in reality,
there are so many different types
of English American, British,
Australian, Canadian and all the
different incomprehensible semi
dialects of the U.K.

In today's day and age, it's
extremely important to be able to
communicate in more than one dis
tinct language. Languages don't
only determine geographical bor
ders but also social borders. Being
multi-lingual is one of the strongest
forces breaking down these borders

and walls and one of the most
important steps to understanding
different cultures. Languages are
the most powerful tools we have to
build civilizations, the most influen
tial means to bring cultures and
empires together. To know a lan
guage is to know the history of a
people and to better understand the
human psyche.
The Stanford second-language
requirement isn't so bad after all.

guage used by those who can't communicate in
the "high-class" language, English. This made
me think why in the world in the year 2011 is
one language in a highly advanced country con
sidered better than another? And then the an
swer hit me like a running jibra. It's simply be
cause the language of a land reflects its culture.
Singapore was under British rule for 146
years (between 1819 and 1965). According to
Frantz Fanon, a psychiatrist and revolutionary
20th-century writer, the relationship between
the colonizers of a nation and those being colo
nized is one of veneration, hate and envy. Fanon
argues that the colonizers portray themselves as
higher class, so at the same time, the colonized
hate and envy the colonizers. The colonized
hate that they have been pushed down to sec
ond-class citizens in their own land but, at the
same time, strive to climb up in society in the
quickest way possible. Fanon theorized that the
way to climb the societal ladder would be to
adopt the habits and practices of the "higher"
class. In the case of Singapore, that meant imi
tating the colonizers, including learning "prop
er" English. Even today this mentality contin
ues, both consciously and subconsciously.
Other Asian languages also reflect their re
spective cultures. In Vietnam, where bike thiev
ery is rampant, there is no Vietnamese word for
"stolen." Instead, if you wish to report a stolen
bike to the authorities, you are obliged to
humbly explain (to save your own face and the
face of your fellow citizen who happened to
steal your bike) that "my bike is missing." On
the other hand, in Urdu (a language spoken in
Pakistan and India), there is no word for a neu
tral "missing." If something is actually missing,
it's either your own fault for losing it or someone
else has stolen it. Combine this with the Asian
idea of saving face, and it just so happens that
everyone is stealing everything from everyone
else. Or so it would seem.

Singapore, a mish-mash of different cultures,
has its own unique language that reflects that cul
tural diversity - a mish-mash language of so much
more than just Hokkien, Malay, Bhasa, Can
tonese and Tamil roots. To pick one Asian lan
guage and stick with it would be a slur on the Sin
gaporean prestige: an island nation in the middle
of the South China Sea completely unlike its
neighbors speaking primarily the language of an
other nation would indicate association with that

nation. So, to get around this issue,
Singapore chose to have four official
languages: Standard English,
Chinese, Malay and Tamil.
Consequently, Singapore hasn't
identified with one single country or
culture. But, through language, it
identifies with many.

Language doesn't only allow us
to communicate it also express
es culture. But then what about the
issue when multiple cultures speak
the same language? The Spanish
word " agarrar " means "to hold" in
Spain, but if you u agarrar"-ed
someone last night in Mexico, it
means something much more inti
mate. In Spain, you can " coger"
(catch/take) a bus, but you for sure
don't want to " coger " a bus in
Mexico or Latin America, because
that actually means to f — a bus. In
the U.S., Americans think "loo" is
a girl's name, and the British are
confused why it's called a "bath
room" if there's no bath in it! The
British know that a line is an object
in two-dimensional space, and the
Americans know that a "queue" is
the 17th letter of the alphabet. We
call it "English," but in reality,
there are so many different types
of English American, British,
Australian, Canadian and all the
different incomprehensible semi
dialects of the U.K.

In today's day and age, it's
extremely important to be able to
communicate in more than one dis
tinct language. Languages don't
only determine geographical bor
ders but also social borders. Being
multi-lingual is one of the strongest
forces breaking down these borders

and walls and one of the most
important steps to understanding
different cultures. Languages are
the most powerful tools we have to
build civilizations, the most influen
tial means to bring cultures and
empires together. To know a lan
guage is to know the history of a
people and to better understand the
human psyche.

£ £ ~w~ ""W~i, I'd like a coffee, please."

"Si mi!"
"Coffee."
"Kopi mail!"
"What?"
"Kopi-O can?"
"What is kopi-O!"
"Kopi-O! Ger, wai so gabra lah? Kopi-O
kopi no milk!"
"Oh! Yes, that's fine."
"So kopi-kosong den."
"What?"

In a country where English is one of four of
ficial languages, spoken by 80 percent of the
population, I find I still need a dictionary in Sin
gapore. The conversation above is one I recent
ly had while trying to buy a coffee from a local
kopitiam (coffee shop). After a few more ex
changes like this, I finally understood what the
sweet, old Chinese lady behind the counter was
asking me. "Si mi" was actually a simple
"what?" "Kopi" means coffee. " Kopi-O " is cof
fee with no milk, and " kopi-kosong " is plain cof
fee. It took me a while to figure out "Ger, wai so
gabra lah!" and when I did, I couldn't help but
laugh at the irony. The lady was asking me "girl,
why are you so confused?" To be honest, I'm
still confused. Because I was speaking English.
And so was she. So why couldn't we understand
each other?

In Singapore, there are actually two different
types of English: "proper" English, and what's
called "Singlish" (Singapore + English =
Singlish). Although the government highly dis
courages Singlish, it is still widely spoken be
cause, in general, even for a modern, effective
and efficient government like Singapore's, it's
pretty difficult to effectively discourage a prima
ry method of communication. In that kopitiam,
I spoke "proper" English. The lady was speak
ing "Singlish."
Singlish is not held in high regard in Singa
pore. It's often taken as a sign of low social
standing and low prestige. But at the same time,
it's something that Singaporeans can't help but
hold dear to their hearts. Locals will excitedly
ask me if I can speak Singlish and be disappoint
ed when I admit I cannot. Singlish is often the
central comic theme of local TV shows, and Sin
gaporeans themselves will make fun of the lan
guage. But at the same time, the two versions of
English don't only act as a language barrier, but
also as a social one. Someone who can speak
Standard English is higher up on the social and

business ladder than someone who
speaks Singlish, which is viewed as a patchy lan
guage used by those who can't communicate in
the "high-class" language, English. This made
