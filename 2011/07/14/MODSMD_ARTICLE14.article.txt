## LOCAL JOINS D-LINE RECRUIT ANDERSON A PALO ALTO NATIVE 
### KEVIN ZHANG INTERN 
For many student-athletes heading off to
school, moving across the country is a neces
sary process. But for incoming defensive line
man Kevin Anderson, that's not the case
Anderson is an alumnus of nearby Palo Alto
High School and the only Bay Area recruit in
Stanford's 2015 football class.

"I get the best of both worlds," Anderson
said. "I am able to get a great college experi
ence as a Stanford student-athlete but also can
go home for things like Sunday-night dinners."

The 6-foot-4 Anderson didn't seem entirely
destined to become a Cardinal player, as both
of his parents received degrees from Cal and
his brother currently plays football at Yale. On
top of that, Anderson was not always an athlet
ic standout. He never played organized tackle
football until he entered high school and was
on the junior varsity team until a postseason
call-up promoted him in his sophomore sea
son.

"I mostly played baseball in middle school,"
Anderson said. "However, I was always big
and knew my size would be good for football."
In his junior season, Anderson changed the

course of his career.
"The summer between my sophomore and
junior season, I found the weight room and
gained about 20 pounds," he said. "The varsity
coaches fit me very well and helped me
tremendously."

Anderson finished his first full season on
varsity as the Santa Clara Valley Athletic
League's (SCVAL) Defensive Lineman of the
Year after recording 68 tackles (18 for a loss)
and 6.5 sacks. After the season, he sent his
highlight reel to about 20 schools
and gained considerable interest.
The first university to give him
an offer was right across the street
from where he went to school.

"Everyone says, 'There's always
a special place in your heart for the
first school that gives you an offer,'"
Anderson said.

Although he received Stanford's
offer in February of his junior year,
Anderson had several objectives in
his high school career that he had
yet to complete. One was to im
prove upon Palo Alto's early post
season exit.

Before the start of the 2010 sea
son, the Vikings found themselves
underdogs, completely out of the
picture for the state, section and
even league titles. However, the
team went on an incredible run and
went 14-0 for the first time in school
history, defeating heavily favored
Centennial (Corona) in the state
championship game 15-13. Palo
Alto ended the season ranked No. 2
in the state and No. 13 in the coun
try.

Anderson was the SCVAL Line
man of the Year and Metro Area
Defensive Player of the Year while
earning first-team all-state honors
for his 113 tackles, 11.5 sacks and 2
blocked punts.
"It gives me chills thinking about
the season," Anderson said. "From
being ranked so low in the state to
second, matching up with a guy on
Centennial who weighed 100
pounds more than me, it was amaz
ing."

With Palo Alto in his past and his
future, Anderson looks forward to
living out more of his dreams with
the Cardinal.
