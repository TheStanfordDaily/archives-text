# LOCKOUTS A LOSS FOR FANS
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
We didn't grow up idoliz
ing Susan Richard
Nelson. We didn't
check the newspaper
to see what DeMau
rice Smith was up to every day. We did
n't have posters of Billy Hunter on our
bedroom walls. And we didn't see Roger
Goodell or David Stern in a single seg
ment of Top-10 Plays.

Instead, you probably followed play
ers. If you're like me, you grew up think
ing sports was about the games on the
field, court, ice, pavement, pool, course
or whatever other venues let athletes
show their talents. You probably didn't
think of your favorite star players bat
tling in the courtroom.

Unfortunately, this summer is a
growing-up process for all of us. We're
learning that money really does drive
sports. We're finding out that the names
listed above could matter a whole lot
