# LOCKOUTS A LOSS FOR FANS
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
We didn't grow up idoliz
ing Susan Richard
Nelson. We didn't
check the newspaper
to see what DeMau
rice Smith was up to every day. We did
n't have posters of Billy Hunter on our
bedroom walls. And we didn't see Roger
Goodell or David Stern in a single seg
ment of Top-10 Plays.

Instead, you probably followed play
ers. If you're like me, you grew up think
ing sports was about the games on the
field, court, ice, pavement, pool, course
or whatever other venues let athletes
show their talents. You probably didn't
think of your favorite star players bat
tling in the courtroom.

Unfortunately, this summer is a
growing-up process for all of us. We're
learning that money really does drive
sports. We're finding out that the names
listed above could matter a whole lot
more for our sports fandom than
Kobe, Leßron, Manning, Vick, A-
Rod or Pujols. And unlike when peo
ple usually talk about sports being a
business, we're not just giving excus
es for the latest big-name signing with
Scott Boras.
No, this is much worse than just a
greedy athlete or two. We've now got
greedy leagues. Greedy owners,
greedy lawyers and, of course, many
greedy players.
It's midsummer, a time when the
sports world is usually in a lull any
way. College sports are taking their
summer breaks, and baseball is the

only major pro sport still going. And
even for hardcore baseball fans, there
is a little feeling of the dog days once
their team's fate seems obvious but
70 games still remain on the schedule.
With such a lull, the current lock
outs of the NFL and NBA have even
less to compete with for media atten
tion. And as much as I love the latest
"things that have happened since the
lockout started" graphic and the in
credulous looks on my parents' faces
when they see the phrase "ESPN
legal analyst" on the television, I still
cannot stand lockout conversations.
Yes, I want these things to get settled
as much as anyone. I want players
playing, and I want seasons to go off
as planned. But updates on the war
between millionaires and billionaires
over a pile of money don't interest
me.

Maybe I'm just holding onto that
childhood naivety (the same one that
makes me love plain hot dogs, fruit
punch and board games), but I still
love sports for the actual sports them
selves. You can have all the steroid
rumors, contract negotiations, own
ership lawsuits and DUIs you like, I'll
stick with touchdowns, RBIs, buzzer
beaters and goals.
The thing is, there are still some
actual sports out there to care about.
The aforementioned lull in baseball
hasn't really happened. This week's
Home Run Derby was one of the best
in years, with Robinson Cano edging
out Adrian Gonzalez 12-11 in the
most exciting final ever. The guy that
won the All-Star Game, Tyler Clip
pard, gave up a single to the only bat
ter he faced. Even in exhibitions, you
see things you've never seen before.

At the All-Star Break, all six divi
sions are close no team leads its di
vision by more than 3.5 games, some
thing that has never happened be
fore, Even with guys like Joe Mauer
and Albert Pujols struggling out of
the gate, other formerly good players
are ascending the ladder to greatness.
Gonzalez, Matt Kemp, Jose Reyes,
Jose Bautista, Jair Jurrjens and Jered
Weaver all have put up crazy num
bers in the first half after years of talk
about their potential. The second half
should be quite a show.
This past weekend, the American
public discovered the Women's
World Cup, and it turns out that
women's soccer can be pretty dang
exciting. The win over Brazil was one
of the most heart-pounding, emo
tional games you'll see in any sport,
and even Americans can embrace

soccer when the U.S. is actually good
at it. The Gold Cup gave us a blown
lead and one of the best goals
you'll ever see but the WWC can
give America wins, and there isn't
much America loves more than win
ning.

Still, with lockouts marring two of
the nation's biggest sports, there isn't
much winning to go around. Whoev
er makes sacrifices, whoever gets a
bigger share of the pot, whoever
"wins" the negotiations, just settles
these lockouts. Until then, every
sports fan loses.
And I hate losing.

Jacob Jaffe would gladly go to court
over a change to the formula in
Welch's fruit snacks. Share your love
for caranuba wax, palmitate and red
40 at jwjaffe@stanford.edu.

actual sports out there to care about.
The aforementioned lull in baseball
hasn't really happened. This week's
Home Run Derby was one of the best
in years, with Robinson Cano edging
out Adrian Gonzalez 12-11 in the
most exciting final ever. The guy that
won the All-Star Game, Tyler Clip
pard, gave up a single to the only bat
ter he faced. Even in exhibitions, you
see things you've never seen before.

At the All-Star Break, all six divi
sions are close no team leads its di
vision by more than 3.5 games, some
thing that has never happened be
fore, Even with guys like Joe Mauer
and Albert Pujols struggling out of
the gate, other formerly good players
are ascending the ladder to greatness.
Gonzalez, Matt Kemp, Jose Reyes,
Jose Bautista, Jair Jurrjens and Jered
Weaver all have put up crazy num
bers in the first half after years of talk
about their potential. The second half
should be quite a show.
This past weekend, the American
public discovered the Women's
World Cup, and it turns out that
women's soccer can be pretty dang
exciting. The win over Brazil was one
of the most heart-pounding, emo
tional games you'll see in any sport,
and even Americans can embrace

soccer when the U.S. is actually good
at it. The Gold Cup gave us a blown
lead and one of the best goals
you'll ever see but the WWC can
give America wins, and there isn't
much America loves more than win
ning.

Still, with lockouts marring two of
the nation's biggest sports, there isn't
much winning to go around. Whoev
er makes sacrifices, whoever gets a
bigger share of the pot, whoever
"wins" the negotiations, just settles
these lockouts. Until then, every
sports fan loses.
And I hate losing.
