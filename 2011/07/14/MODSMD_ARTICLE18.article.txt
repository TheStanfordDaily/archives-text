# FINES THE BEST WAY TO GO

### Joseph Beyda 
It's all too easy to criticize
NCAA sanctions. They're al
ways branded as either ineffec
tive or over the top. The unfor
tunate truth is that, without
time travel, there's no real way to undo
the damage done when a school com
mits a major rules violation.
A week ago, I mentioned some of
the institutional flaws namely, an
unfair emphasis on major sports and a
lack of concern for education that
result when college players lose their
amateur status. But beyond these is
sues, how can the NCAA right the ship
on the playing field when major viola
tions are uncovered at a college?
This week's wrong answer: ask Ohio
State.

When Buckeye football coach Jim
Tressel covered up improper benefits
given to five of his players, the program
took matters into its own hands in ad
vance of its Aug. 12 date with the
NCAA Infractions Committee. After
asking Tressel to resign in May, Ohio
State vacated all 12 of its wins from last
season, including a Big Ten champi
onship and a Sugar Bowl victory.
It looks admirable, at first: finally, a
school owning up to its mistakes and
showing willingness to pay the price for
its actions.

Unfortunately, that price isn't right.
The Buckeyes will have officially post
ed a 0-1 record in 2010, but a victory is
more than a "W" in the record books. If
someone told you that Stanford didn't
win last year's Big Game, you wouldn't
believe them. You were there, you
watched the Bears get trounced 48-14,
you saw the frowns on Cal fans' faces
on the train ride home. Unless you
watch college football to keep track of
your school's all-time record, then all
that matters is what happens on the
gridiron, not what some bigwigs decide
later on.
