# FINES THE BEST WAY TO GO

### Joseph Beyda 
It's all too easy to criticize
NCAA sanctions. They're al
ways branded as either ineffec
tive or over the top. The unfor
tunate truth is that, without
time travel, there's no real way to undo
the damage done when a school com
mits a major rules violation.
A week ago, I mentioned some of
the institutional flaws namely, an
unfair emphasis on major sports and a
lack of concern for education that
result when college players lose their
amateur status. But beyond these is
sues, how can the NCAA right the ship
on the playing field when major viola
tions are uncovered at a college?
This week's wrong answer: ask Ohio
State.

When Buckeye football coach Jim
Tressel covered up improper benefits
given to five of his players, the program
took matters into its own hands in ad
vance of its Aug. 12 date with the
NCAA Infractions Committee. After
asking Tressel to resign in May, Ohio
State vacated all 12 of its wins from last
season, including a Big Ten champi
onship and a Sugar Bowl victory.
It looks admirable, at first: finally, a
school owning up to its mistakes and
showing willingness to pay the price for
its actions.

Unfortunately, that price isn't right.
The Buckeyes will have officially post
ed a 0-1 record in 2010, but a victory is
more than a "W" in the record books. If
someone told you that Stanford didn't
win last year's Big Game, you wouldn't
believe them. You were there, you
watched the Bears get trounced 48-14,
you saw the frowns on Cal fans' faces
on the train ride home. Unless you
watch college football to keep track of
your school's all-time record, then all
that matters is what happens on the
gridiron, not what some bigwigs decide
later on.
Vacating wins is a futile attempt
to rewrite the past. Most NCAA
sanctions, on the other hand, are an
all-too-powerful attempt to rewrite
the future. USC can attest to the fact
that postseason bans and scholar
ship reductions are quite effective in
downgrading an elite football pro
gram for years to come. Yet these
methods are overkill, punishing
hundreds of players current and
future for the mistakes of just a
handful of athletes and coaches. So
what's the proper balance between
potency and common sense when
penalizing a university with compli
ance issues?

This week's right answer: ask
Ohio State.

Before Tressel had even left, the
school imposed a $250,000 fine
against him. It was a significant hit,
even for a coach who used to make
$3.5 million a year. It was a focused
punishment, limited to the man

branded by university officials as
the sole guilty party in the investiga
tion. It was the best of both worlds.

That is, until Ohio State changed
its mind.

In light of the vacated wins, the
Buckeyes have decided to continue
paying the perpetrator instead, giv
ing Tressel over $50,000 more under
his contract and allowing him to re
tire instead of resign.
But college football fans should
n't be mad that Ohio State has tried
to save face for the man that
coached the school to an impressive
106-22 record (pre-vacation) over
the past 10 years. We should be
thankful that the Buckeyes have
pointed the NCAA in the right di
rection. If, as many analysts expect,
the league decides to not accept the
self-imposed sanctions, then it will
work creatively to find away to
punish Tressel despite the fact that
he's no longer a part of the Ohio
State program. It's an excellent op
portunity for the NCAA to set new
precedents and send one clear mes
sage: even if you leave, you aren't
off the hook.

The same warning should apply

to players as well. Star Buckeye
quarterback Terrelle Pry or, one of
the five athletes receiving improper
benefits, left school early when the
scandal worsened. As it stands, he'll
go unpunished and be given a mul
timillion-dollar salary by an NFL
team. He should be forced to give
some of that money whether it's
his scholarship cost or the value of
the benefits he received back to
the NCAA, which can reinvest it in
a young athletic program with a
cleaner track record or a develop
ing sport looking to make a name
for itself.

That's another issue entirely, es
pecially for less-wealthy offenders
or those who don't move on to the
next level. But with the high fre
quency of major infractions, there
should be more than enough incen
tive to find penalties that actually
harm the violator.
What a concept.

Joseph Beyda hopes he doesn't get
sanctions for selling self-auto
graphed t-shirts from his java com
puter programming club. Get in on
