# NEW SPORTS RISING
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I discovered a new sport last
week: cycling. I'm not going
to lie and say I'd never heard
of the Tour de France before,
but it's never been a focus of
mine until now. On top of facing a bit
of a gap in my schedule with the new
soccer season in Europe still a month
away and U.S. college sports mostly
winding down for the summer, I'd
been disheartened by the continual
failure of British teams or athletes in
general (compare, for example, the
success of Spanish tennis players to
their homegrown counterparts at
Wimbledon). Still, cycling managed
to catch my attention, at least for a few
days.

As I write this, it seems things have
changed a little. But at the start of the
Tour, Britain had more riders than
anyone else in the top 10, and one of
these was on exactly the same time as
the leader. Outside of track cycling, in
which we won a host of medals in Bei
jing, I don't really remember much
substantial success in this sport, so it
was pretty exciting to see this brief
flash of promise in the Super Bowl of
cycling.
Such unexpected successes can do
a lot to publicize otherwise ignored
