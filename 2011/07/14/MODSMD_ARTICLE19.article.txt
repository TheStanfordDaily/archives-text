# NEW SPORTS RISING
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I discovered a new sport last
week: cycling. I'm not going
to lie and say I'd never heard
of the Tour de France before,
but it's never been a focus of
mine until now. On top of facing a bit
of a gap in my schedule with the new
soccer season in Europe still a month
away and U.S. college sports mostly
winding down for the summer, I'd
been disheartened by the continual
failure of British teams or athletes in
general (compare, for example, the
success of Spanish tennis players to
their homegrown counterparts at
Wimbledon). Still, cycling managed
to catch my attention, at least for a few
days.

As I write this, it seems things have
changed a little. But at the start of the
Tour, Britain had more riders than
anyone else in the top 10, and one of
these was on exactly the same time as
the leader. Outside of track cycling, in
which we won a host of medals in Bei
jing, I don't really remember much
substantial success in this sport, so it
was pretty exciting to see this brief
flash of promise in the Super Bowl of
cycling.
Such unexpected successes can do
a lot to publicize otherwise ignored
disciplines. Winning a rare gold
medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics
suddenly made British fans aware of
the sport of curling a forgotten
sporting relic that originated in Scot
land. In 1999, the U.S. women's soc
cer team succeeded where the men
failed, not just by winning the World
Cup, but by securing a place in the
hearts of American fans. Fernando
Alonso even turned Spain, a country
hooked on soccer and motorbikes,
into Formula 1 fans. Win or lose, the
TV exposure alone can have a sub
conscious effect. In the U.K., amateur
runners and tennis players always ap
pear (apparently out of nowhere) in
the days following the London
Marathon or Wimbledon. But the
athletes disappear just as quickly, and
that is often the problem for these
sports: they can hit the headlines, but
most can't stay there for long.
We might be facing a unique op
portunity to do just that, at least in the
U.S., in the next few months. The
prospect of a simultaneous NBA and
NFL lockout would leave a huge hole
in the world of American sports.
Journalists might be able to partly fill
this by talking about the political
twists and turns of the situation, but
surely that wouldn't satisfy the fans
who'd otherwise tune in for Monday
Night Football.
I don't wish to overly criticize the
stance of these deserving athletes,
though I can't quite agree with their
motives. While many of their fans are
losing their homes and jobs in the
world financial crisis, players are
causing tumult in search of an extra
zero in their already substantial pay
checks. Not that I'm supporting the
team bosses either, but I'd rather see
this money filter down to the little
people, the fans, by making tickets
and replica gear cheaper. And both
parties might find they are biting the
hands that feed them. Something will
need to fill the dead air, and if there
were ever a chance for fringe sports or
even the already-popular college
sports to gain a greater slice of the pie,
this could be it. It won't be easy to go
against the power of and tradition
al loyalty to the NBA and NFL,
but with a little bit of ingenuity and a
hefty slice of luck, who knows?

The MLS and WNBA seasons will
be peaking at about the same time
that the NFL and NBA seasons are
due to start, providing the former
sports a great opportunity to steal
some of the spotlight. For both, it
could be a tempting proposition to
consider moving game times to fill the

vacant primetime slots or even to find
away to extend their respective sea
sons by a few extra weeks. Ironically,
any attempt to cash in on increased
coverage might work against them
provided that the warring parties in
the NBA and NFL make peace
but either way, it would be a win-win
situation for fans. At least they'd be
guaranteed some basketball and
"football."

But even given this opportunity, it
will require something extra special
for these two to break the over
whelming monopoly of their bigger
cousins: an extraordinary end to the
season, full of twists and turns, to etch
themselves into the memories of
watching fans and stay there through
the off season. Because if anything is
certain, it's that eventually, NBA
players will return to the court and
football stars will walk back out onto
the field, and when they do, they will
be seriously tough opposition.

hands that feed them. Something will
need to fill the dead air, and if there
were ever a chance for fringe sports or
even the already-popular college
sports to gain a greater slice of the pie,
this could be it. It won't be easy to go
against the power of and tradition
al loyalty to the NBA and NFL,
but with a little bit of ingenuity and a
hefty slice of luck, who knows?

The MLS and WNBA seasons will
be peaking at about the same time
that the NFL and NBA seasons are
due to start, providing the former
sports a great opportunity to steal
some of the spotlight. For both, it
could be a tempting proposition to
consider moving game times to fill the

vacant primetime slots or even to find
away to extend their respective sea
sons by a few extra weeks. Ironically,
any attempt to cash in on increased
coverage might work against them
provided that the warring parties in
the NBA and NFL make peace
but either way, it would be a win-win
situation for fans. At least they'd be
guaranteed some basketball and
"football."

But even given this opportunity, it
will require something extra special
for these two to break the over
whelming monopoly of their bigger
cousins: an extraordinary end to the
season, full of twists and turns, to etch
themselves into the memories of
watching fans and stay there through
the off season. Because if anything is
certain, it's that eventually, NBA
players will return to the court and
football stars will walk back out onto
the field, and when they do, they will
be seriously tough opposition.
