## LOCAL Google brings high-speed fiber network to campus Stanford residential division first test site in country for new service 
### HAELIN CHO INTERN 
The 850 homes in Stanford's res
idential subdivision will soon be the
first location in the country to have
access to the "ultra high-speed"
broadband Google Fiber network,
which will operate at speeds of up to
one gigabit per second more
than 100 times what most Internet
users across the country have access
to.

Installation of the network com
menced this past spring. According
to Stanford Campus Residential
Leaseholders (SCRL) Board of Di
rectors President James Sweeney,
also a management science and en
gineering professor, the Google
Fiber project is an opportunity for
the residents on campus to partici
pate in a project that will provide
more sophisticated Internet ser
vice, with perks ranging from video
linkages to faster downloads.
"What we got out of it was an op
portunity to get us a very cutting
edge of the technology with a pric
ing plan that is attractive," Sweeney
said.

According to its website, the
SCRL is a group of staff members
that "represents the interests of and
acts on behalf of Stanford campus
homeowners."

Campus residents will get free
use of Google Fiber for one year
after paying for installation. After
this period, Google will set a sub
scription price that residents can
choose to pay for further use of the
network, according to Sweeney. He
also said that some campus resi
dents already have access to Google
Fiber.

Several other cities competed
earlier this year for city-wide instal
lation of the network. According to
a post on the official Google Blog in
March, Kansas City was chosen as a
location where the project could
"build efficiently, make an impact
on the community and develop re
lationships with local government
and community organizations."
Google Communications Asso
ciate Jenna Wandres said imple
mentation of the project, which was
announced in October 2010, began
earlier this year. Google hopes to
finish installation soon.

"Stanford is Google Fiber's first
testbed with real customers," Wan
dres wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We hope this trial deployment will
facilitate the testing of new tech
nologies and techniques, enabling
us to scale more effectively and effi
ciently to much larger communi
ties."

Sweeney explained that Stan
ford applied for a different Google
wireless project several years ago
but was not chosen in that endeav
or. Instead, Google offered SCRL
the chance to be a part of Google
Fiber's test run.

He described the partnership be
tween the University and Google as
"a very positive relationship" and
disruption from the installation
process as minimal.
"There's things that have come
up which they haven't anticipated,"
Sweeney said, explaining that
Google broadened its Fiber ser
vices free of cost to Olmsted Ter
race Staff Housing, which was not
originally included in the project's
scope. "They really bent over back
ward to be very cooperative and
have successfully done so."
Another post on the Google
Blog indicates that the company in
tends "to offer service at a compet
itive price to at least 50,000 and po
tentially up to 500,000 people."
Wandres added that Google
also hopes that the Google Fiber
project will bring "new and unpre
dictable innovations."

"Our goal is to experiment with
new ways to make the Internet bet
ter and faster," she said.

Although Google is facilitating
implementation of Fiber, it will
need to collaborate with other com
panies, including Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E).
"Google needs to work with
PG&E to make sure that they avoid
the gas lines," said University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin. "That's
common with any project."
Lapin said that this would be
PG&E's only involvement in the
endeavor.

After the three-year contract
between Stanford and Google ex
pires, the organizations plan to
reevaluate the network's opera
tions.
