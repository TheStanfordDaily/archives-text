( ( w in them and you in me
I â€”so that they may be
brought to complete
unity. Then the world
will know that you sent
me and have loved them even as you
have loved me."

Taken from John 17:23, that
verse is the motto of one of the
newest faith-based organizations on
campus, Stanford United. De
scribed as a "student-initiated,
Christian-athlete fellowship group"
on its Facebook page, Stanford
United is the brainchild of Taylor
Skaufel 'll, who started the group
in spring quarter this last year.
Already a member of a Bible

study group with the football team,
Skaufel observed that there was a
lot of demand for a similar organi
zation among his fellow athletes,
and he decided to act on that en
thusiasm.

"I wanted to create something
that you could come to if you had
never been to Bible study before, if
you just wanted to learn about
Jesus," he said.
Despite the relative abundance
of faith-based organizations on
campus, Skaufel said newcomers
often find it difficult to approach the
already tight-knit groups. That's
where he stepped in.
"Stanford United really got
started because, for a lot of the
Christian groups here, people felt
uncomfortable going if they weren't

already a part of the group," he said.
To start the group, Skaufel invit
ed one member from every Stan
ford athletic team to a meeting.
After gauging their interest levels,
he had those team representatives
invite members to attend Stanford
United's first meeting with the hope
that it would make joining the group
easier for many students.
"Having someone personally in
vite you goes a long way," Skaufel
said.

Ben Johnson 'l2 has been a
member since the group's founding.
A runner for the cross-country and
track teams, Johnson met Skaufel in
a similar Christian athletes' organi
zation. The two became friends, and
when Skaufel decided to found his
own group, Johnson was quickly

asked to join.
"Taylor told me he was founding
this group, Stanford United, and
that I should join," Johnson said. "I
did, I helped out where I could and
here we are today."
Stanford United, unlike many
similar organizations, is not based
around specific sermons or other
explorative lessons. Instead, meet
ings are scheduled around personal
testimonies of faith that are shared
by the members.
"It's a lot of sharing of what God
does in your life, personally,"
Skaufel said. "For people who've
grown up in the Church or not
grown up in the Church, I feel like
you hear a lot of sermons on things,
but what you don't really get is what
He is doing in people's lives."

Jen Yen 'll also joined the group
in its inaugural days. During the sec
ond meeting, she stood up and
shared her own story about life at
Stanford, from struggling to accept
her role on the tennis team to trying
to learn how to "be real" with herself
and God in an intense college cli
mate. The best surprise, she said,
was when her teammates from ten
nis showed up to hear her speak,
