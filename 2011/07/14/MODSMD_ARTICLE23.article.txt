( ( w in them and you in me
I â€”so that they may be
brought to complete
unity. Then the world
will know that you sent
me and have loved them even as you
have loved me."

Taken from John 17:23, that
verse is the motto of one of the
newest faith-based organizations on
campus, Stanford United. De
scribed as a "student-initiated,
Christian-athlete fellowship group"
on its Facebook page, Stanford
United is the brainchild of Taylor
Skaufel 'll, who started the group
in spring quarter this last year.
Already a member of a Bible

study group with the football team,
Skaufel observed that there was a
lot of demand for a similar organi
zation among his fellow athletes,
and he decided to act on that en
thusiasm.

"I wanted to create something
that you could come to if you had
never been to Bible study before, if
you just wanted to learn about
Jesus," he said.
Despite the relative abundance
of faith-based organizations on
campus, Skaufel said newcomers
often find it difficult to approach the
already tight-knit groups. That's
where he stepped in.
"Stanford United really got
started because, for a lot of the
Christian groups here, people felt
uncomfortable going if they weren't

already a part of the group," he said.
To start the group, Skaufel invit
ed one member from every Stan
ford athletic team to a meeting.
After gauging their interest levels,
he had those team representatives
invite members to attend Stanford
United's first meeting with the hope
that it would make joining the group
easier for many students.
"Having someone personally in
vite you goes a long way," Skaufel
said.

Ben Johnson 'l2 has been a
member since the group's founding.
A runner for the cross-country and
track teams, Johnson met Skaufel in
a similar Christian athletes' organi
zation. The two became friends, and
when Skaufel decided to found his
own group, Johnson was quickly

asked to join.
"Taylor told me he was founding
this group, Stanford United, and
that I should join," Johnson said. "I
did, I helped out where I could and
here we are today."
Stanford United, unlike many
similar organizations, is not based
around specific sermons or other
explorative lessons. Instead, meet
ings are scheduled around personal
testimonies of faith that are shared
by the members.
"It's a lot of sharing of what God
does in your life, personally,"
Skaufel said. "For people who've
grown up in the Church or not
grown up in the Church, I feel like
you hear a lot of sermons on things,
but what you don't really get is what
He is doing in people's lives."

Jen Yen 'll also joined the group
in its inaugural days. During the sec
ond meeting, she stood up and
shared her own story about life at
Stanford, from struggling to accept
her role on the tennis team to trying
to learn how to "be real" with herself
and God in an intense college cli
mate. The best surprise, she said,
was when her teammates from ten
nis showed up to hear her speak,

even the girls who weren't Christian.
"They really got to see a whole
new side of me," she said. "Jesus is
just such a big part of my life, and it
was cool that I got to share that with
them."

The group aims to help clarify
Christianity for its members in addi
tion to acting as a general support
system for everyday life.
"Really, one of the main goals of
the group is to clarify what "Christ
ian" is, what we believe and why we
believe it, and to really care for oth
ers," Johnson said. "We try to figure
out who Jesus is and how he helps
us, and we help each other and ex
press our faith."
Group members have reported
positive experiences across the
board.

"I've been really blessed by
what's come of it," Skaufel said. "By
all the people sharing their stories
and just everything you get out of
that."

"We have a lot going on with
sports, with school, and if we're hav
ing a bad day, we can meet and
everyone is just there to support
one another," Johnson added.
"That's what I really love about
Stanford United, the level of caring
people have for each other."
Additionally, the wide pull of the
group ensures that a diverse com
munity is formed, one that the
members normally might not get to
experience.

"One of the best parts is to see
people, to come together in Christ
and just to put aside our differ
ences," Yen said. "Honestly, if it
weren't for the group, I don't think
that all of us would be hanging out
together, so it brings people from all
over."

Although Stanford United de
scribes itself as a Christian athletes'
group, Skaufel emphasized that the
organization is not solely for ath
letes.

"We started it with athletes, be
cause that's where I saw a big need,"
he said. "But there are definitely
people who are not athletes."
During the spring, the group met
about once a month, a schedule that
will continue into next year. Cur
rently, however, Stanford United is
hosting weekly Bible study sessions
for interested undergrad and gradu
ate students. The group is focusing
on the question "Who is Jesus?" for
study this summer.
"There's this saying that Jesus

was a man in the world but not of
the world," Skaufel said. "We're
looking into what that means."
Skaufel will officially be finished
with school at the end of the upcom
ing fall quarter, after which Stan
ford United's management will fall
into new hands. However, he is con
fident that the group will live on.
"There's a lot of people I know
who want to keep it going," he said.
"It'll be in good hands."
