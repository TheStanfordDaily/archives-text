## Harry and us: A generation's growth to adulthood 
### â€“ lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
Hordes of Stanford students will queue
up at midnight tonight for "Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part
II," the final act in the franchise's 14-year grip
on the pop cultural consciousness. While
countless fanatics of all ages will also be lining
up across the nation, it's this specific college
demographic late teens to early 20s who
will likely be blubbering the worst when the
screen fades to black.
The series debuted stateside in October
1998 to mild fanfare. It took nearly a year
before "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
built enough momentum to top The New
York Times' bestselling fiction list, but it wasn't
long before the ticking Potter-mania time
bomb exploded.
"Potter's" safe, classic themes a chosen
hero risking everything to save the world

contributed to the series's broad appeal.
Flipping back through "Harry Potter and the

Sorcerer's Stone," it's always a little surprising
how simple and chapter-book like this first
installment was (not to mention how short).
We were fortunate enough to be at the right
age (elementary school) to fully appreciate it.
That's the beauty of Rowling's writing. It
matured alongside us, adding increasingly
adult and complex themes as we learned to
understand them, all without losing the com

pulsive readability established in the first novel.
The "Sorcerer's Stone" film adaptation
was released three years later, introducing
the famous faces who would become indeli
bly linked with their characters. It added
another extension of the "Harry Potter" uni
verse; on top of Rowling's characters, we
could now track the growth of the actors
who portrayed them onscreen. It led to odd
juxtapositions between cinematic magic and
reality from pleasant in-character revelations

Emma Watson's going to Brown! to
more startling ones like Daniel Radcliffe's
recent revelation about overcoming an alco
hol problem.
While the films may not be perfect (the
first two come off as particularly clunky in
comparison to their sleeker successors), it's
rare that a movie adaptation complements the
original novels as well as the "Potter" films do.
That's thanks in no small part to the cast,
which maintained as much consistency as
humanly possible down to even the most
minor characters. The adult supporting cast
slowly turned into a veritable cavalcade of
Britain's finest actors. Dumbledore was the
only real shake up; Michael Gambon never
quite captured the headmaster's twinkle as
wholly as the late Richard Harris.

"Harry Potter's" generational resonance is
what allows it to tower over other popular fan
tasy series like "Chronicles of Narnia," "His
Dark Materials" and, arguably (these may be
fighting words), "The Lord of the Rings."
