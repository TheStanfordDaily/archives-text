## Caillat's 'All of You' a bright, mature album 
### â€” andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Since her debut in 2007, Colbie Caillat has come to epito
mize the carefree style often associated with Southern
California artists. Her simple guitar, soft voice and
unabashedly romantic lyrics make her a favorite among teenage
girls, and over the last several years, Caillat (pronounced "cah-
LAY") has learned how to play to her audience and polish her
style while still retaining the charm that has made her a
Grammy Award-winning artist. With her third album, "All of
You," Caillat takes yet another leap forward, refining her sound
to compose the quintessential summertime album.
"All of You" is more "produced" than Caillat's former
albums, featuring a more upbeat sound and more musical
complexity than the simple, lazy strum of a guitar. In most

pieces, this works to her advantage. For instance, the title track,
"All Of You," epitomizes the simple, signature style of Caillat's
first album: guitar-driven and romantic. However, the addition
of a gentle piano tinkle and a quicker pace than that of her first
single, "Bubbly," turn a good song into a great one. Caillat's
growth is also evident in her more mature lyrics both here
and throughout the album as she candidly speaks about

both the triumphs and the fears of a normal relationship.
However, in a couple spots, Caillat's sleekness weighs her
down. For instance, the second single from the album,
"Brighter Than The Sun," features Caillat attempting to make
her style a little more 2011-radio-friendly but losing in the
process the perfectly controlled vocals she is so well known for.
