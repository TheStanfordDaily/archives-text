# MUSIC REVIEW
## Caillat's 'All of You' a bright, mature album 
### â€” andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Since her debut in 2007, Colbie Caillat has come to epito
mize the carefree style often associated with Southern
California artists. Her simple guitar, soft voice and
unabashedly romantic lyrics make her a favorite among teenage
girls, and over the last several years, Caillat (pronounced "cah-
LAY") has learned how to play to her audience and polish her
style while still retaining the charm that has made her a
Grammy Award-winning artist. With her third album, "All of
You," Caillat takes yet another leap forward, refining her sound
to compose the quintessential summertime album.
"All of You" is more "produced" than Caillat's former
albums, featuring a more upbeat sound and more musical
complexity than the simple, lazy strum of a guitar. In most

pieces, this works to her advantage. For instance, the title track,
"All Of You," epitomizes the simple, signature style of Caillat's
first album: guitar-driven and romantic. However, the addition
of a gentle piano tinkle and a quicker pace than that of her first
single, "Bubbly," turn a good song into a great one. Caillat's
growth is also evident in her more mature lyrics both here
and throughout the album as she candidly speaks about

both the triumphs and the fears of a normal relationship.
However, in a couple spots, Caillat's sleekness weighs her
down. For instance, the second single from the album,
"Brighter Than The Sun," features Caillat attempting to make
her style a little more 2011-radio-friendly but losing in the
process the perfectly controlled vocals she is so well known for.
Her replacement sound, a somewhat robotic-sounding voice,

makes "Brighter Than The Sun"
one of those songs that gets irritat
ing after about five listens, with
only a chorus to salvage the track.
In contrast, but with no better a

result, "Favorite Song" has Caillat
almost yelling during the grating
chorus and, along with an unbe
lievably underwhelming contribu
tion from rapper Common, seems
out of place in the album.
Where Caillat slips up, though,
her lyrical brilliance saves her: she
proves to be immensely adept with
her metaphors. Her style is remi
niscent of Taylor Swiff, yet her tar
get audience and her style are
much more mature possibly

because Caillat, at 26, is at a differ
ent place in her life than Swiff.

Whereas Swift prefers singing of
the fresh perfection of a new rela

tionship, Caillat follows an old one,
from the uncertainty and instability
of the bad times ("All of You") to a
perspective far into the future ("I
Do," the album's first single), mak
ing her relate to a broader group of
listeners.

In the end, Caillat's strengths
win out as she delivers an album
worth several listens. "All of You"
expresses her lightheartedness in a
shiny, new package, capturing the
beauty of bright California sun
shine in 12 breezy songs.
