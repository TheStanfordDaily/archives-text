## Fumbled details betray 'Torchwood' high concept 
### â€” aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
TJris year's "Torchwood" is going to
be an interesting beast. The show
has had a shaky history since its
inception: when it first spun ofF from
"Doctor Who," it was envisioned as
"'Doctor Who' for adults," but its
attempts to be "adult" for its own sake
made the show more immature than the
source material (the second episode, for
example, featured an alien that possessed
a woman and absorbed energy from hav
ing sex with random men). Though it
improved slowly throughout the run, it
wasn't until two years ago, with the five
episode mini-series "Children of Earth"
that it finally found its footing with a story
that was not only mature but also com
pelling. Now, for the fourth season, subti
tled "Miracle Day," American network
Starz is footing the bill and providing
some Yankee sensibility.

Like "Children of Earth" before
it, "Miracle Day" abandons the monster
of-the-week format the first two seasons
used in favor of an overarching high con
cept: what if everyone on Earth stopped
dying? It's an interesting idea, with some
terrifying ramifications, most of which
would be even more terrifying if the show
weren't so direct about them. For some
reason, the new (and so far uninteresting)

characters introduced for American audi
ences Rex Matheson and Esther
Drummond, two CIA agents need
almost every plot point spelled out for
them, aided by a cast of characters that
seems perfectly willing to state the obvi
ous for their benefit.
But even if he could be more
subtle about it, it's gratifying to see
showrunner Russell T. Davies take the
concept so seriously, tackling it from all
the angles. Amid concerns about the
resulting explosive population growth and
whether or not a prisoner on death row

who survived execution can be freed,
there's a great moment when Gwen
Cooper, one of the three characters to
survive the entire run of the show, is
talked out of investigating the miracle by
her husband when he says their newborn
daughter could five forever (although nat
urally, it doesn't last very long).
Despite claims from Davies that
every effort has been made to make the
show accessible to a new audience, I
couldn't help but try to envision what I


COURTESY BBC
would be thinking if I hadn't seen the
past three seasons. Gwen's extreme
paranoia makes her seem more like a
former prisoner than an employee of
Torchwood Institute until it's finally
pointed out that she is the latter, and
it's entirely inconsistent with how she
appeared in the epilogue of "Children
of Earth." Captain Jack Harkness'
immortality is never directly pointed

out, even when he and Gwen are
actively discussing it, so the fact that
his injuries aren't healing doesn't
mean anything to someone new to
the show. These are the things that the
writers should have been spelling out
for new viewers, not the plot points
that were right in front of their faces.
By trying to please old fans while eas
ing in the new, the writers made con

cessions that end up hurting both
groups. Hopefully these are just grow
ing pains that will go away after the
first couple episodes.
After I watched this pre
miere, I went back and watched the
beginning of "Children of Earth" to
see how it compared. It's clear this
season is an entirely different show
than it was before, and not just

because now it's American. With
twice as many episodes, the writers
have much more room to breathe,
but this could be as much its downfall
as its salvation. The premiere lacks the
tight writing and the punch that
helped save the show from the brink
of cancellation two years ago. While
the high concept could easily outdo
that of "Children of Earth," it will take

some careful maneuvering to make
sure the rest of the season remains
compelling to both new viewers and
old.
