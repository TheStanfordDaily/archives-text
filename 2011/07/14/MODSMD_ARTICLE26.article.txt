## Fumbled details betray 'Torchwood' high concept 
### â€” aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
TJris year's "Torchwood" is going to
be an interesting beast. The show
has had a shaky history since its
inception: when it first spun ofF from
"Doctor Who," it was envisioned as
"'Doctor Who' for adults," but its
attempts to be "adult" for its own sake
made the show more immature than the
source material (the second episode, for
example, featured an alien that possessed
a woman and absorbed energy from hav
ing sex with random men). Though it
improved slowly throughout the run, it
wasn't until two years ago, with the five
episode mini-series "Children of Earth"
that it finally found its footing with a story
that was not only mature but also com
pelling. Now, for the fourth season, subti
tled "Miracle Day," American network
Starz is footing the bill and providing
some Yankee sensibility.

Like "Children of Earth" before
it, "Miracle Day" abandons the monster
of-the-week format the first two seasons
used in favor of an overarching high con
cept: what if everyone on Earth stopped
dying? It's an interesting idea, with some
terrifying ramifications, most of which
would be even more terrifying if the show
weren't so direct about them. For some
reason, the new (and so far uninteresting)

characters introduced for American audi
ences Rex Matheson and Esther
Drummond, two CIA agents need
almost every plot point spelled out for
them, aided by a cast of characters that
seems perfectly willing to state the obvi
ous for their benefit.
But even if he could be more
subtle about it, it's gratifying to see
showrunner Russell T. Davies take the
concept so seriously, tackling it from all
the angles. Amid concerns about the
resulting explosive population growth and
whether or not a prisoner on death row

who survived execution can be freed,
there's a great moment when Gwen
Cooper, one of the three characters to
survive the entire run of the show, is
talked out of investigating the miracle by
her husband when he says their newborn
daughter could five forever (although nat
urally, it doesn't last very long).
Despite claims from Davies that
every effort has been made to make the
show accessible to a new audience, I
couldn't help but try to envision what I
