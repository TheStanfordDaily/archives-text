Sunday was the final night of a weeklong
funk extravagan2a at Yoshi's Jazz Club
celebrating the 70th birthday of the
mayor of Chocolate City, master of the Bop
Gun, Dr. Funkenstein himself, George
Clinton. For those not in the know, Clinton is
the most important figure in the postmodern
evolution of pseudo-ironic black identity
encapsulated in the form of funk music.
Other than James Brown, no artist has been
more instrumental (pun intended) to author
ing the defining characteristics of the genre.
Influential and musically prolific, Clinton and
his Parliament-Funkadelic crew have been the
defining architects of funk's hyperbolic,
unabashedly absurd aesthetics. If Brown is the
father of funk, Clinton is its epicenter.
The dance floor at Yoshi's was surpris
ingly empty for a P-Funk show, but fittingly
vacant for the weirdly early 7 p.m. start time.
There were at least 10 performers in the band
it is not irregular for those on stage to be
without an instrument, such as Carlos "Sir
Nose" McMurray, a designated dancer clad in
a white-feathered robe and matching wide
brimmed hat admirably holding down
"Bop Gun" while Clinton remained offstage.
But it was not long before the man of the
hour appeared, wearing a camo suit, a gener
al's hat and a fittingly glazed expression.
Clinton no longer possesses anywhere near
the vocal range that made him one of flank's
most beloved prophets. In fact, he sounded
worse than the Pogues' Shane Magowan on
St. Patrick's day last year, which is to say real

ly, really growly. Thankfully, he surrounded
himself with a multitude of talented musi-

cians who more than made up for the decline
in Clinton's vocal purity. Now a self-pro
claimed "referee," he was a great anchor for
the plethora of musicians on stage.

As the first of two shows came to a close,
Clinton and crew tore through killer rendi
tions of "Mothership Connection,"
"Flashlight" and "Maggot Brain," bringing
most of the crowd to the dance floor. There
was a predictable collection of hipsters; the
occasional white-collar, blazer-wearing

banker type; and the more typical P-Funk
fans, but no one danced harder than two pre
pubescent children, whose inspired efforts
drew the praise of Clinton himself. Taking
advantage of the numerous guitarists, the
songs achieved a climax not heard on the
records. However, the first show closed on an
unconventional note with a cover of Aretha
Franklin's "Dr. Feelgood" featuring a gor-

geous guest vocalist.
A half hour later, Clinton opened the
second show with "Cosmic Slop." It was clear
that Clinton and the "Children of
Productions" made the most of their 30-
minute break between shows. With a

renewed energy and slighdy modified, but no
less extravagant costumes, they launched into
a mostly new set which featured appearances
from several members of Clinton's family. His
blood relatives proved to be musically adept

and charismatic additions to the

show, while his son's argyle sweater
clad friend who couldn't mask his

"undeniable whiteness" performed a
bizarre and ultimately flat rendition
of "Pull On My Dingle," or some

variant thereof. But this could not

detract from the truly awesome, gui
tar-driven renditions of such classics
as "Give Up the Funk," with most of
the audience joining in for the leg
endary chorus.

While it lacked the aggressive
(and perhaps desperate) stimulation of
two dudes on a laptop with a projected
visualizer—seemingly all the rage
with this generation Clinton and P-
Funk practiced the time-honored, glo
rious tradition of musicians playing
together simply to have fun. They were
all talented and ridiculous, some were
wasted and one was extremely fat, but
they united as one nation under a
groove. Consider this an entreaty from
your humble correspondents to "free
your mind" and see George Clinton
before you can't anymore.
