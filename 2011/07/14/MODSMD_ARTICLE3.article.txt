Gabarone, Botswana, about his new
position.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): Why did
you choose to accept this position?
Tim Hartman (TH): It's an incredible
job and an incredible opportunity to
be able to return to the Peace Corps
and serve the volunteers of the Peace
Corps and the people of Botswana in
addressing important challenges and
goals. Peace Corps gets in your blood,
and it's difficult to get out.
TSD: Could you talk about your ex
periences with the companies you
previously worked for? Did they in
fluence your decision to take this po
sition?
TH: The country director position is a
very broad one. It requires experi
ences and skills in many arenas: lead
ership, management and administra
tive skills, human resources, interna
tional development, cross-cultural
skills... It takes a while to gain com
petency in all of those different areas,
and I think all of my prior positions
contributed to my ability to serve as
Peace Corps country director.
TSD: What are the challenges the ini
tiative for HIV/AIDS prevention in
Botswana is currently facing?
TH: Those challenges, to some de
gree, are the same world over. Pre
vention requires behavior change ...
and that's hard for people the world
over. Knowledge is different than ef
fective behavior change, so I think the
challenges really are global. The
other [challenge] is that there's a very
high prevalence rate here, unfortu
nately, of people already with HIV.

Obviously, it's all that much easier for
the disease to spread, so that makes
the prevention challenges even
greater.

TSDrWhat ways do you go about pro
moting human behavior changes to
prevent HIV/AIDS?
TH: First you have to raise awareness.
People have to get tested and know
their status. They have to know that
there are things that they can do if
they are HIV positive ... We work in
Botswana with youth, helping them
with life skills and learning to make
good decisions, and hopefully a num
ber of those decisions are around sex
ual partners and how they can lead
safer lives.

TSD: How did your Stanford experi
ence including your degree in phi
losophy prepare you for this expe
rience?
TH: I think the education at Stanford
that I received helped me in critical
thinking and making good decisions.
.. Philosophy in general is all-around
critical thinking, problem solving,
looking from many angles, thinking
through challenging issues, good writ
ing and logical thinking. Those skills
are just so useful in life.

TSD: How has your experience in
Botswana been so far?

TH:It is phenomenal. I've only been
on the job three days now, and just on
the first day of work I had a most en
joyable lively exchange with the
Peace Corps staff... I was invited to
a dinner with one of the former presi
dents of Botswana, Festus Mogae, by
a previous country director, and I
mean, what an honor... It's just a
wonderful country. I couldn't be
more thrilled to be here.
