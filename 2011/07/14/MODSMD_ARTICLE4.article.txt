## U.S. Supreme Court rules against University 
### HIROKO SUNAMURA INTERN 
The U.S. Supreme Court decisively ended a
decade-long patent dispute over an HIV-screening
method developed by School of Medicine professor
Mark Holodniy with its June 6 ruling on Stanford v.
Roche that awarded patent rights to the pharmaceuti
cal firm.
In the court's 7-2 decision, the majority opinion,
written by Chief Justice John Roberts dismissed
Stanford's claim to the test's patent under the 1980

Bayh-Dole Act, which established protocol for assign
ing the patent rights of inventions made by institutions
receiving federal funds. It cited Roche and Stanford as
co-owners of the test, meaning no patent infringement
occurred.
The dispute stems from two contracts Holodniy
signed giving both Stanford and Cetus Corporation
a company later acquired by Roche rights to his
work: a 1998 copyright and patent agreement with
Stanford and a Visitor Confidentiality Agreement
with Cetus the following year.
The HIV test under dispute is
used worldwide. Stanford sued
Roche for its rights in 2005; the
Supreme Court decision addresses
an appeal filed, again by the Uni
versity, in 2009.

Stanford released a statement
soon after the decision stating that
it "respectfully disagrees." In the
same statement, Stanford General
Counsel Debra Zumwalt J.D '79
said the University is "disappoint
ed" by the decision and again cited
the Bayh-Dole Act.
"I do not think the Supreme
Court opinion adequately consid
ered the history and language of
the Bayh-Dole Act and the policy
behind the Act," she wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Prior to the
Bayh-Dole Act, when the federal
government funded research at
universities, the government kept
the patents to the inventions creat
ed through that research. The gov
ernment did not have a good track
record in commercializing the in
ventions resulting from the feder
ally funded research."
Its co-sponsor, former U.S. Sen.
Birch Bayh, filed an amicus brief
on behalf of the University.
"[The Bayh-Dole Act] auto
matically vests ownership rights in
the inventions arising from feder
ally funded research in the univer
sities, small businesses and non
profit organizations responsible
for their creation," he wrote in the
brief.

"Congress thought that univer
sities could do a better job of li

censing patents resulting from the
research and seeing that these in
ventions were developed and put
out in the marketplace so that peo
ple could benefit from them,"
Zumwalt said. "The government
kept certain rights, gave the rest of
the patent rights to the university
and required that universities
share any royalties from successful
patents with the faculty, employee
and student inventors.
The American Association of
Universities and U.S. Solicitor
General Neal Katyal also filed
briefs on Stanford's behalf.
The Court also dismissed
Holodniy's personal claim to the
test.

"[lt] has long been the rule that
inventors have title to their patents
initially, even if they make those
inventions while working for
somebody else," Roberts wrote in
the majority opinion. "The United
States as amicus curiae argues that
this provision operates to displace
the basic principle, codified in the
Patent Act, that an inventor owns
the rights to his invention."
In order to protect the interests
of its faculty and prevent future
conflicts, Stanford is currently su
pervising a small but critical
change to the language used in its
agreements. Rather than having
the employee say he or she "will
assign" patent rights, the employ
ee will instead sign, "I hereby
agree."
"This decision will also create
problems for the government's re
served rights," Zumwalt said.
