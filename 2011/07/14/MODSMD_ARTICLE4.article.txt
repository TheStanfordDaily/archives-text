## U.S. Supreme Court rules against University 
### HIROKO SUNAMURA INTERN 
The U.S. Supreme Court decisively ended a
decade-long patent dispute over an HIV-screening
method developed by School of Medicine professor
Mark Holodniy with its June 6 ruling on Stanford v.
Roche that awarded patent rights to the pharmaceuti
cal firm.
In the court's 7-2 decision, the majority opinion,
written by Chief Justice John Roberts dismissed
Stanford's claim to the test's patent under the 1980

Bayh-Dole Act, which established protocol for assign
ing the patent rights of inventions made by institutions
receiving federal funds. It cited Roche and Stanford as
co-owners of the test, meaning no patent infringement
occurred.
The dispute stems from two contracts Holodniy
signed giving both Stanford and Cetus Corporation
a company later acquired by Roche rights to his
work: a 1998 copyright and patent agreement with
Stanford and a Visitor Confidentiality Agreement
