## Lecture-streaming software released as open source code 
### KRISTIAN BAILEY 
Researchers from the Department of
Electrical Engineering recently released
open-source code to their ClassX program,
which allows real-time online streaming of
lectures and public access to recordings that
would otherwise require expensive class
room equipment to produce.
ClassX, used in nine Stanford classrooms
this past spring, allows live streaming in high
resolution and lets students zoom in, tilt and
pan to any specific area of the room. It also
provides video synchronization with lecture
slides and allows students to review the
videos as long as the professor chooses to
keep them online without the large stor
age requirements typically associated with
high-resolution video.
The project is the result of a year and a
half of development by electrical engineer
ing professor Bernd Girod, second-year
electrical engineering graduate students
Sherif Halawa and Derek Pang, and Ngai-
Man Cheung, who was an electrical engi
neering post-doctoral scholar during the
project.
"Our goal is to work on developing an
open contribution from other researchers,
developers and educators in building an
open, cost-effective and state-of-the-art edu
cation-viewing system for the general pub
lic," Pang said.
The groundwork for the program, devel
oped by Girod and researchers in their
Image, Video and Multimedia Systems
group (IVMS) began in fall 2009, when
ClassX was tested in two Stanford courses. It
was offered in nine classes total during the
2009-10 academic year and grew to cover 22
courses in 2010-11. The program has been
used in 25 Stanford courses to date.
Computer science professor Stephen
Cooper, who used ClassX in his CSIO6B
class, says his students enjoyed the program.
Cooper's winter CSIO6A class requested the
program too late in the quarter to use it, but
his spring quarter CSIO6B course did run
with ClassX.
Other professors who used the program
expressed some reservations.
"It's a very good first step, but it needs
considerable improvement," said chemical
engineering professor Chaitan Khosla, who
utilized the program in his E2O course. "If
the University is motivated about making
this a success, they should be putting much
more resources into this."
IVMS's decision to release the ClassX
code to the public could address both of
Khosla's concerns.
"We thought if we provided it to
the open-source community, it
would make the software easier to
use by other institutions and also at
tract the attention of other develop
ers," Halawa said. "These groups
would then join the efforts of our
team and actually contribute to
something advantageous to the stu
dents."

Neither Cooper nor Khosla
identified significant in-class atten
dance changes once ClassX became
available.

"Students have legitimate rea
sons for not being at lecture, and
they have not so good reasons,"
Cooper said. "My hope is that the
ratio of good to bad is higher. Let's
try anything that's good for stu
dents."

ClassX also gained interest from
outside institutions before the code
was released. ASSIA Inc., a Red
wood City-based management sys

tems designer for DSL providers,
uses ClassX to make training videos
and presentations similar to
TEDTalks available to employees
in the U.S. and at international sites.
The program is also receiving edu
cational and international attention.

"Georgia Tech sent us an email
asking about the system and how we
could make the system open
source," Cheung said.
"We decided to let them import
our system to their site so that they
could continue developing and
working on it," Halawa explained.
"The potential scope of the project
was understood beyond the United
States, with international groups
contacting the group," including In
dian companies and German uni
versities.

This interest coincides with Che
ung's ultimate vision for the project.
"We hope that by this project we
can improve all education quality
and make it more affordable and ac
cessible for many developing coun
tries," he said.
