## Study links sleep extension to athletic performance 
### ELAINA KOROS INTERN 
A School of Medicine study
on the men's basketball team
published in this month's issue of
Sleep concluded that sleep ex
tension an increase in the
time spent sleeping over baseline
amounts leads to improved
athletic performance.
The research team measured

sleep patterns during a two-week
baseline evaluation, then asked
11 members of the team to sleep
at least 10 hours a night over a
five-to-seven-week period. Re
searchers then tested the ath
letes' shooting accuracy and
sprint times.

"[The traditional athletic
training regimen] has a lot of em
phasis on the physical training:
the conditioning, the workouts,"

said Cheri Mah 'O6 M.S. 'O6, first
author and researcher at the
Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic
and Research Laboratory.
"When you get to Stanford,
there's a little bit more of the nu
trition, obviously coaching plays
a big factor, but in all of these em
phases, there hasn't been one on
sleep and recovery."

A main goal of the study was to
eliminate accumulated sleep debt,
which researchers assumed the ath
letes carried with them upon starting
the study, to naturally improve ath
letic performance. At the study's
conclusion, free-throw shooting ac
curacy increased by an average of
nine percent, three-point field goal
accuracy increased by an average of
9.5 percent and average sprint times
decreased by about five percent.
Despite the basketball team's
rigorous travel schedule, the ath
letes pursued the study, though it
was difficult to get them to agree ini
tially. The athletes received com
pensation.
"It was tricky, but generally I've
had a very good relationship with
many of the coaching staff and ath
letes and teams on Stanford's cam
pus, and it was the individual ath
letes' decision to participate in the
study," Mah said.
The researchers initiated the
study with several teams in order to
have a sample size large enough to
ensure accurate results, but ulti
mately decided it was not possible to
compare statistics between sports.

They chose to focus on the men's
basketball team, looking at physical
performance measures specific to
the sport over the regular winter sea
son.

During the study, researchers
also asked athletes to refrain from
drinking coffee and alcohol. When
sleeping at least 10 hours a night was
not an option, the athletes were
asked to take naps to make up for
missed nocturnal sleep hours.
"Every single person on this
planet, with the rare exception, is
going to benefit from getting a good
night's sleep," said sports perfor
mance coach Juan Pablo Reggiardo,
who works specifically with the
men's basketball team. "It's not just
for physical performance, it's that
mental alertness and focus."

Along with physical perfor
mance testing, researchers tested re
action time with the Psychomotor
Vigilance Task, levels of daytime
sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepi
ness Scale and mood through the
Profile of Mood States. As a result of
added sleep, daytime sleepiness and
mood both improved.
"These improvements following
sleep extension suggest that peak
performance can only occur when
an athlete's overall sleep and sleep
habits are optimal," the study said.
Although the study does not
prove that sleep extension can help

recreational athletes or non-ath
letes, research has shown that sleep
awareness can benefit the average
person.
William Dement, professor of
psychiatry, teaches Sleep and
Dreams, a class that focuses on un
derstanding sleep and sleep debt.
"Stanford students likely know
more about sleep than any other
university, although there

are a few other universities who ad
dress the issue," said Dement in a
statement Mah provided to The
Daily. "Sleep and Dreams certainly
made Stanford students more aware
about sleep, whether they took the
course or gained knowledge about
sleep through word of mouth from
Sleep and Dreams students."
Mah hopes to continue sleep re
search, bringing similar studies to
different sports teams and groups of
people.
"The bigger picture in all of this is
that we're hoping to continue to
build on this, not just in terms of re
search, but in trying to continue to
develop resources and education
and understanding of sleep as an im
portant part of athletic performance
and training for a lot of the Stanford
teams and athletes and coaches,"
she said.
