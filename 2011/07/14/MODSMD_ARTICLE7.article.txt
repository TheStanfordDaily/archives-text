## Study links sleep extension to athletic performance 
### ELAINA KOROS INTERN 
A School of Medicine study
on the men's basketball team
published in this month's issue of
Sleep concluded that sleep ex
tension an increase in the
time spent sleeping over baseline
amounts leads to improved
athletic performance.
The research team measured

sleep patterns during a two-week
baseline evaluation, then asked
11 members of the team to sleep
at least 10 hours a night over a
five-to-seven-week period. Re
searchers then tested the ath
letes' shooting accuracy and
sprint times.

"[The traditional athletic
training regimen] has a lot of em
phasis on the physical training:
the conditioning, the workouts,"

said Cheri Mah 'O6 M.S. 'O6, first
author and researcher at the
Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic
and Research Laboratory.
"When you get to Stanford,
there's a little bit more of the nu
trition, obviously coaching plays
a big factor, but in all of these em
phases, there hasn't been one on
sleep and recovery."
