## Board approves six new construction projects 
### MICHAEL TUSCHMAN INTERN 
The Board of Trustees ap
proved six new construction
projects at its June 9 meeting,
including the Stanford Re
search Computing Facility,
Satellite Research Animal Fa
cility, Stanford Auxiliary Li
brary 111, Bioengineering and
Chemical Engineering Build

ing, West Campus Recreation
Center and Olmsted Staff
Rental Housing.
The expected completion
dates span from late 2012 for
the Stanford Auxiliary Library
111 to late 2014 for the Bioengi
neering and Chemical Engi
neering Building. The project
ed costs range from $14.8 mil
lion for the Stanford Auxiliary
Library 111 to $194.3 million for

the Bioengineering and Chemi
cal Engineering Building.
Director of Campus Plan
ning David Lenox said all the
projects were approved in ac
cordance with the future goals
of the University.
"These are all critical pro
jects to support Stanford's aca
demic mission and campus life,"
Lenox said. "[The] key to the deci
sion-making process is making sure
that each of these buildings is sited
appropriately in accordance with
the long-range planning vision for
the campus."
The approved projects will
serve a variety of purposes. The
Bioengineering and Chemical En
gineering Building will allow for
the expansion of the Department
of Bioengineering and a relocation
of the Department of Chemical
Engineering and will provide both
wet and dry laboratory spaces.
"The Bioengineering and Chem
ical Engineering Building is the
fourth building in the Science and
Engineering Quad, completes the
definition of the quad and is consis
tent with the original Board of
Trustees concept and site approval
for the entire quad," Lenox said.
Additionally, the Stanford Re
search Computing Facility, a
22,100-square-foot building to be
located on SLAC's campus, will be
built with energy efficiency in
mind.

"This facility is designed to opti
mize the energy consumption these
machines require. By collocating all
these research computing rooms

into one facility, you'll get a more
energy-efficient result," said Board
of Trustees member Rick Sapp '7B.
Some of the projects have not
yet received finalized sources of
funding.
"When the budgets are pro
posed and at this preliminary stage,
it is often not known specifically
the mix of funding," said Universi
ty spokeswoman Lisa Lapin.
Approved projects are not ex
clusively academic. The West
Campus Recreation Center, a pro
posed sports and recreation center,
received project and construction
approval. The 75,000-square-foot
building, estimated to cost $35.5
million, will include basketball
courts, recreation spaces, a pool
and shower facilities.

Both the Auxiliary Library 111
and Stanford Research Computing
Facility were approved as off-cam
pus projects. Lenox said their prima
ry purpose will be to support expan
sion.

"[The projects] are located off
of the central campus to allow for
flexibility for the future growth of
other academic programs," Lenox
said.

Also approved were the Satel
lite Research Animal Facility and
an increase in funding to the Olm
sted Staff Rental Housing.
