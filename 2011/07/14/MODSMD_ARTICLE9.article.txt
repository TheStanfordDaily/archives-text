### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Harini Jaganathan 
Former Stanford art professor Richard Randell, a
nationally known artist, died of lung cancer at his
Sonoma County home on May 25 at age 81. Randell

was known for his large-scale contemporary sculp
tures and his instructional videos on African lan
guages among them "Kiswahili," "Hausa,"
"Shona" and "Bambara."

After working as an acting assistant professor of art
from 1968 to 1969, Randell joined the Stanford faculty
in 1970. Randell's media included bronze, wood, plastic
and metal, and his work is displayed in museums and
galleries across the country.

"He had a great sense of irony and the absurd," said
art history professor emerita Wanda Corn to the Stan
ford Report. "Students loved him for his talk and wis
dom as well as his teaching of metal and woodworking."
In 1992, he founded World of Languages, a
nonprofit organization to help his work with lin
guists from Stanford, Yale University and
UCLA in creating a video archive of songs and
performance arts from Kenya and Tanzania.
After Randell retired in the late 19905, he creat
ed award-winning stop-motion animations and
was granted two artist residence grants at the
Emily Harvey Foundation in Venice.
Randell is survived by four children and his wife,

Susan Harby. A memorial service is planned for the fall.
