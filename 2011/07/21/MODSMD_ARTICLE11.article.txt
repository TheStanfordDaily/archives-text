## SEEING GREEN Say, Don't Spray 
### Holly Moeller 
The news finally broke last week,
months after the first anxious reports
of browning and dying trees near lawns
and golf courses across America: unlike their
wild cousins in the Rockies and British Co
lumbia, these conifers aren't dying of pest
outbreaks - they're suffering from pesticides.
It seems that Imprelis, a recently released
DuPont herbicide marketed for environ
mental friendliness, is poisoning ornamen
tals like Norway spruce and eastern white
pine. Now, DuPont is promising new labeling
for Imprelis; the Environmental Protection
Agency is reevaluating its approval, and New
York and California are congratulating
themselves for never approving it in the first
place. Add Imprelis to the list of pesticides
whose ultimate toxicity took us by surprise.
At least this time we noticed the signs within
six months, not 25 years, as was the case with
DDT.

The herbicides, fungicides and insecti
cides applied to lawns each year may seem
the most gratuitous at least to those of us
who don't mind a dandelion or clover here
and there. But it's actually agriculture that
applies 80 percent of the 1.1 billion pounds of
pesticides used in the U.S. each year, quelling
insect outbreaks, smothering weeds and en
suring un-nibbled produce.
Of course, when we nibble that produce
or eat animals who've nibbled it any
residues and leftover toxins transfer to us.

How did we become so chemically depen
dent?

Most of the story should be familiar: it's
the tale of the Green Revolution, which
tripled our agricultural yields. By growing
hybrid crops with shallow root systems and
short stalks, farmers ensure that their plants
dedicate the majority of their energy to pro
ducing big yields. But these varieties also
need babying: lots of water to keep shallow
roots moist, fertilizer to support increased
fruiting and pesticide applications to knock
out wilder, tougher neighbors and natural
enemies.

Of course, pesticide application is not
without consequences. In sufficiently high
doses, some pesticides are acutely toxic to
humans as well as their intended victims.
Low-level, long-term exposures can cause
cancer, reduce fertility and disrupt endocrine
signaling. And many of the compounds don't
break down right away, so they're washed
into waterways and may accumulate down
stream persistent pollutants acting in un
intended ways on unintended targets.

Some new technologies have been devel
oped to reduce this spillover (and, of course,
make immense profits for their patent hold
ers).

In 1996, Monsanto began marketing its
Roundup Ready line crop varieties resis
tant to the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup).
Glyphosate is believed to break down quick
ly on fields, theoretically providing a local
ized, targeted attack on weeds. But beyond
campaigns against genetically modified
crops (nicknamed "Frankenfoods" by pro
testors), there are real fears that glyphosate
resistance could "escape" (through genetic
reshuffling by cross-pollination) and take off
in the wild weeds. Repeated application of
glyphosate on acre after rolling acre creates
strong selection pressure in favor of any plant
that evolves to tolerate the chemical. Like
antibiotic resistance, pesticide resistance can
spread rapidly through populations, devas
tating food supplies and livelihoods.
To minimize such risks, Roundup
Ready's sister seed, Bt-corn, comes with a
mandate that other corn strains be planted
alongside it. Bt-corn has been genetically
modified to produce a toxin normally manu
factured by the soil bacterium Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt). This Bt toxin is noxious to
insects that would normally attack the corn
in fact, farmers sometimes spray the bac
terium itself on crops.
Of course, any bug that developed a toler
ance for Bt toxin would have exclusive rights
to a field full of juicy, fat ears of corn. Its re
productive fitness would skyrocket, and that
field, and its neighbors, would be demolished
by the lucky arthropod's offspring. In theory,
though, any toxin-free corn nearby would
harbor an abundance of the same specie s, but
without resistant traits. Flopefully, that first
resistant bug would choose a mate from
among the susceptible population, and the
resistance trait would be lost in the genetic
shuffle. (Note: this only works if resistance
arises from a recessive mutation, i.e. one in
which two copies of the gene are needed
one from each parent.)
But who wants to plant an offering for the
enemy when Bt-corn is so profitable and suc
cessful? At least one in four farmers was will
ing to dodge the law back in 2008, when the
EPA surveyed U.S. corn plantings. With re
ports of resistance spreading in China and
India, our time bomb could explode at any
moment.

And so we find ourselves locked
into another arms race with evolu
tion, pitting our chemical engineer
ing against the random luck of mil
lions of mutating, adapting plants,
insects and fungi. To fail is to surren
der a huge and critical segment of
our food supply. But to prevail is to
release more and more toxins delib
erately into our environment, some
of which will have side effects far

deadlier than DuPont's Imprelis.
Some people are bowing grace
fully out of the dance, turning to the
traditional methods of "Integrated
Pest Management." They rotate
crops, use mechanical pest traps,
breed pest predators and plant a
range of plant varieties. These are
the tools organic farmers use with
the delicious success you can witness
at weekend farmers' markets or in
your own backyard garden.
