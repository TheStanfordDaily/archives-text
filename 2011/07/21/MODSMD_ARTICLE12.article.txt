# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## 'Peranakan' and the Asian Revival 
### Aysha Kureishi 
Sometimes you don't have to get voted off
the island to get away from the chaos and
stress. In Singapore, jumping into the car
and driving up to Malaysia for the weekend is
often the perfect mini-vacation to rejuvenate,
spend some quality time with family and feel
like you've gotten a million miles away from
all the kiasu hustle-bustle. Especially when lit
tle pockets of magic and adventure are a mere
three hours away from your writing desk ...
I discovered the word peranakan while
searching for a good restaurant where I could
experience some unusual cuisine. Since then, I
have learned that it is so much more than just
unusual cuisine: when I try to pin down exact
ly what peranakan is, teal porcelain, wooden
birdcages and rose jelly spring to mind. I find
exotic spices on the tip of my tongue, delicate
silks spun by my hand motions and an unusual
language burning in my throat. My fingers
touch wooden boxes carved with the finest de
tail; the aromas of fruity tea swirl up my nose;
my eyes are inundated with colors and pat
terns from a different time and world.

But all this still fails to capture the per
anakan essence. Perhaps that's because per
anakan is something intangible to us in the
modern era; the very name suggests some
thing out of reach and lost long ago.
Peranakan is a word used by both
Malayans and Indonesians to mean "descen
dant." It generally refers to the Chinese ances
tors who migrated south to Malaysia and then
across the sea to Indonesia and represents a
culture and a spirit that survived through hun
dreds of years of European domination,
provincial wars and a brief spell of Japanese
conquest. Now, when something is peranakan,
it is quaint, exotic, antique and very precious
to the Asian soul.

So last weekend, my family and I drove up
in our car, pondering the treasures that lay
ahead. My father's mind wandered to ancient
manuscripts written in Baba Malay (the lan
guage of the peranakans), my mother's mind
teemed with the thought of spices and exotic
recipes and my sister's musical imagination
buzzed with the thought of discovering a
whole new musical history. My own per
anakan vision was one of batik silks, tea trays
painted soft pink and teal, and little sparkling
chests inlaid with golden filigree. But when we
finally arrived in Malacca, we all glanced at
one another with the same thought circling:
how in heaven did we manage, in three hours,
to drive to Portugal?
The European influence from the 15th and
16th centuries is still very evident in Malacca.
Looming over the city like a distant cousin of
the Parisian Notre Dame is the neo-gothic

Church of St. Francis Xavier. The white hous
es line up perfectly next to the city's lazy river
in an enthusiastic nod to Lisbon, and the Jam
batan Old Bus Station Bridge could have been
plucked straight from the southernmost tip of
Moorish Spain.
But what tells us immediately that we're
not in Portugal is the unmistakable Asian
buzz. There is excitement in the air - you can
smell it in the fruit stand on the corner, hear it
in the din from the market next door, taste it in
the dust on your tongue. It's evident every
where: something is happening.
Like a secret that no one is supposed to
know, the phrase "Asia is rising" is spreading
all around the world in a whispered wildfire.
But there are few who realize that this isn't the
whole truth. "Asia is rising" implies a dormant
continent slowly stirring and shaking the slum
ber out of its oriental eyes and getting ready to
open the window for a whole new era of eco
nomic prosperity and cultural pride. But if you
travelled back in time a few hundred years to
just before the European colonists arrived in
Asia, you'd see a shockingly different picture.
Europe, a predominantly agrarian society
that was slowly recovering from the plague, was
poor compared to Asia, which was then a com
plex network of merchant trading routes
stretching from the Middle East up along the
Silk Road to Imperial China and down through
the flourishing peninsulas and archipelagos of
Southeast Asia and Indonesia. The Atlantic
Ocean seemed unconquerable by those explor
ers in Europe, but South Indian merchants
dominated the Indian Ocean in a furious trade
of spices, silks and gold. So what happened?
Why are we now all awed at Asia's stunning
"rise"?

Economist Angus Maddison has a simple
answer: the Europeans came and, in a deter
mined effort to gain capital, prosper and rise
as the leaders of the world, took advantage of
Asia in a mixture of exploitation, corruption
and gunboat diplomacy. At the fall of the
Roman Empire, Asia held almost 80 percent
of the world's collective GDP. By Marco
Polo's trips to Asia in the 13th and 14th cen
turies and the European rediscovery of the
Americas soon after, Asia's portion of the
