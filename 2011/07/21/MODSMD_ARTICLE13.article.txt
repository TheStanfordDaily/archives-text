## RECRUIT RATINGS FLAWED 
### Jack Blanchat 
Back in February 2008, high
school football players all
across the nation signed on
the dotted line and swore
their allegiances to the best
college football programs in the coun
try. After all the hats were firmly atop
the heads of the recruits, Rivals.com
ranked the top 50 recruiting classes in
the nation.
Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson
Tide sat atop the rankings as it brought
in a class that boasted three five-star re
cruits and 19 four-stars. Ohio State
nabbed the nation's top recruit
Pennsylvania quarterback Terrelle
Pryor and earned the fourth-best re
cruiting class in the country. And way
down at the bottom of the list was Stan
ford, where head coach Jim Harbaugh
had brought in zero five-star recruits
and just two four-star athletes.
But today, that 2008 Stanford re
cruiting class has vaulted the Cardinal to
an Orange Bowl victory and possibly a
top-five preseason ranking for 2011. All
of a sudden, three years later, this class
of seniors and redshirt juniors looks like
it might be the best Stanford football re
cruiting class in recent memory. Not bad
for a class that was ranked lower than
Minnesota, Rutgers and Kansas.
Almost every member of the recruit
ing class of 2008 has stepped up to be a
major contributor to the Stanford team
since the group's arrival on campus
and the ones who haven't yet seen their
names in the starting lineup will un
doubtedly be integral players this sea
son.

First, consider the two "four-star"
athletes: wide receiver Chris Owusu and
quarterback Andrew Luck. Owusu
missed quite a bit of time last season due
to injury, but he is the team's top return
ing receiver heading into 2011, a dynam
ic kickoff returner and the Cardinal's
consistent deep threat. Luck, of course,
will go down on the short list of the great
