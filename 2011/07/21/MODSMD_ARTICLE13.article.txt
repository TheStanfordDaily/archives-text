## RECRUIT RATINGS FLAWED 
### Jack Blanchat 
Back in February 2008, high
school football players all
across the nation signed on
the dotted line and swore
their allegiances to the best
college football programs in the coun
try. After all the hats were firmly atop
the heads of the recruits, Rivals.com
ranked the top 50 recruiting classes in
the nation.
Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson
Tide sat atop the rankings as it brought
in a class that boasted three five-star re
cruits and 19 four-stars. Ohio State
nabbed the nation's top recruit
Pennsylvania quarterback Terrelle
Pryor and earned the fourth-best re
cruiting class in the country. And way
down at the bottom of the list was Stan
ford, where head coach Jim Harbaugh
had brought in zero five-star recruits
and just two four-star athletes.
But today, that 2008 Stanford re
cruiting class has vaulted the Cardinal to
an Orange Bowl victory and possibly a
top-five preseason ranking for 2011. All
of a sudden, three years later, this class
of seniors and redshirt juniors looks like
it might be the best Stanford football re
cruiting class in recent memory. Not bad
for a class that was ranked lower than
Minnesota, Rutgers and Kansas.
Almost every member of the recruit
ing class of 2008 has stepped up to be a
major contributor to the Stanford team
since the group's arrival on campus
and the ones who haven't yet seen their
names in the starting lineup will un
doubtedly be integral players this sea
son.

First, consider the two "four-star"
athletes: wide receiver Chris Owusu and
quarterback Andrew Luck. Owusu
missed quite a bit of time last season due
to injury, but he is the team's top return
ing receiver heading into 2011, a dynam
ic kickoff returner and the Cardinal's
consistent deep threat. Luck, of course,
will go down on the short list of the great
est quarterbacks in Stanford (and
possibly college football) history.

But the other, less-"starred"
members of the 17-man class evi
dence just how talented and deep the
2008 Cardinal recruits really are.
Studs like Moose Martin, David De-
Castro, Delano Howell, Chase
Thomas and Michael Thomas, con
tributors like Johnson Bademosi and
Daniel Zychlinski, and possible 2011
starters like Alex Debniak and Sam
Schwartztein all came to the Farm
with three or fewer stars next to their
name.

So what does this tell us? It cer
tainly tells us that recruiting rankings
are imperfect. While Rivals did not
miss by calling Alabama the best re
cruiting class in the country the
Crimson Tide has already produced
three first-round picks: Mark In
gram, Julio Jones and Marcel Dareus
someone obviously overlooked
the talent pool that was assembled in
Palo Alto, especially compared to
the rest of the Pac-10.

Perhaps the most interesting part
of the 2008 recruiting rankings is not
just that Stanford and Harbaugh dug
up some drastically underrated high
school football players, but also that
the Cardinal had to consistently de

feat a Pac-10 conference that turned
in several other strong recruiting
classes. USC had the eighth-best
class. UCLA had the 13th best. Na
tional title contender Oregon had
the 19th best. Arizona State, Wash
ington, Cal and Arizona were all
ranked in the top 40. Somehow,
Stanford had the "worst" of all these
classes, and yet it still cruised to last
year's near-perfect season.
Additionally, this (formerly)
overlooked class has brought noth
ing but positive vibes to the Farm on
and off the field. They bust heads and
rack up points on the grid, then give
polite, well-spoken interviews and
represent the school well. In the col
lege football world, this is a tremen
dous achievement. Consider Pryor,
'oB's number-one recruit, who was
last spotted on ESPN sitting slack
jawed while watching Jon Gruden
make uncomfortable noises and talk
about how much he hates bubble
screens.

So as you watch members of the
recruiting class of 2008 take their last
snaps in cardinal and white this sea
son, consider this: someday, many
years from now, they might make a
"30 for 30" film about how Stanford
became a football powerhouse
overnight. I can hear it in my head al
ready "What if I told you... that a
school known for world class students
... suddenly made the traditional
football powerhouses look foolish?"
When you hear the opening mono

logue to that movie, you'll already
know exactly just how it happened.

One underrated, overlooked,
supremely talented recruiting class
turned a loser into a winner, a winner
into an Orange Bowl champion and
an Orange Bowl champion into

maybe a national champion.

Minnesota, Rutgers and Kansas.
Almost every member of the recruit
ing class of 2008 has stepped up to be a
major contributor to the Stanford team
since the group's arrival on campus
and the ones who haven't yet seen their
names in the starting lineup will un
doubtedly be integral players this sea
son.

First, consider the two "four-star"
athletes: wide receiver Chris Owusu and
quarterback Andrew Luck. Owusu
missed quite a bit of time last season due
to injury, but he is the team's top return
ing receiver heading into 2011, a dynam
ic kickoff returner and the Cardinal's
consistent deep threat. Luck, of course,
will go down on the short list of the great
est quarterbacks in Stanford (and
possibly college football) history.

But the other, less-"starred"
members of the 17-man class evi
dence just how talented and deep the
2008 Cardinal recruits really are.
Studs like Moose Martin, David De-
Castro, Delano Howell, Chase
Thomas and Michael Thomas, con
tributors like Johnson Bademosi and
Daniel Zychlinski, and possible 2011
starters like Alex Debniak and Sam
Schwartztein all came to the Farm
with three or fewer stars next to their
name.

So what does this tell us? It cer
tainly tells us that recruiting rankings
are imperfect. While Rivals did not
miss by calling Alabama the best re
cruiting class in the country the
Crimson Tide has already produced
three first-round picks: Mark In
gram, Julio Jones and Marcel Dareus
someone obviously overlooked
the talent pool that was assembled in
Palo Alto, especially compared to
the rest of the Pac-10.

Perhaps the most interesting part
of the 2008 recruiting rankings is not
just that Stanford and Harbaugh dug
up some drastically underrated high
school football players, but also that
the Cardinal had to consistently de

feat a Pac-10 conference that turned
in several other strong recruiting
classes. USC had the eighth-best
class. UCLA had the 13th best. Na
tional title contender Oregon had
the 19th best. Arizona State, Wash
ington, Cal and Arizona were all
ranked in the top 40. Somehow,
Stanford had the "worst" of all these
classes, and yet it still cruised to last
year's near-perfect season.
Additionally, this (formerly)
overlooked class has brought noth
ing but positive vibes to the Farm on
and off the field. They bust heads and
rack up points on the grid, then give
polite, well-spoken interviews and
represent the school well. In the col
lege football world, this is a tremen
dous achievement. Consider Pryor,
'oB's number-one recruit, who was
last spotted on ESPN sitting slack
jawed while watching Jon Gruden
make uncomfortable noises and talk
about how much he hates bubble
screens.

So as you watch members of the
recruiting class of 2008 take their last
snaps in cardinal and white this sea
son, consider this: someday, many
years from now, they might make a
"30 for 30" film about how Stanford
became a football powerhouse
overnight. I can hear it in my head al
ready "What if I told you... that a
school known for world class students
... suddenly made the traditional
football powerhouses look foolish?"
When you hear the opening mono

logue to that movie, you'll already
know exactly just how it happened.

One underrated, overlooked,
supremely talented recruiting class
turned a loser into a winner, a winner
into an Orange Bowl champion and
an Orange Bowl champion into

maybe a national champion.

Jack Blanchat has already started fill
ing out an application to narrate Stan
ford's fiiture "30 for 30" film. Help
