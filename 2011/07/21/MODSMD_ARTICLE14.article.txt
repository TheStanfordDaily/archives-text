# KIWIS ON THE FARM
## NEW ZEALAND WINS COLLEGIATE RUGBY MATCH 
### RACHEL WOLFARD INTERN 
If you don't know where to look, you might
think that summers at Stanford are totally free
of sports. But even in the dog days of July and
August, the Farm is host to an eclectic bunch of
sporting events that you would never find dur
ing the school year.
The latest unlikely matchup came last Sat
urday, when Stanford's own Steuber Field
hosted a rugby contest between all-stars from
the New Zealand Universities team and USA
Rugby's Collegiate All-Americans. It was the
final matchup of the California Summer Tour,
a three-game series played along the California
coast featuring top collegiate players from the
United States and New Zealand. The current
California tour was intended to showcase up

and-coming young players with hopes of either
playing in the Rugby World Cup that will be
held this September or being recruited to the
newly reinstated Olympic rugby team.
After losing the first two games to drop the
series, the Kiwis prevailed 23-20 after trailing
the U.S. 10-0 in the final game.
The series began on July 9 in San Diego,
where the Kiwis suffered their only defeat.
"[Our] team came out ready to play and
stunned them," said All-American and Cal
player Blaine Scully, reflecting on the first
game.

The second game of the tournament be
tween the New Zealand and American colle
giate teams was held in Santa Barbara on July
13. Stanford rugby coach Matt Sherman said
that the Kiwis had improved and were clearly
working hard as a team. However, the All-

Americans came out ready to play and won the
second game.
Although the All-Americans had already
achieved their victory in the California tour,
the final match was still held at Stanford's Steu
ber Field.

The game began with the American rugby
team on the offensive front. After three min
utes and two scrums, the All-Americans scored
the first seven points of the game. Soon after,
the All-Americans built on their lead, pulling
ahead with three more points to make the
score 10-0.

The intensity picked up after 20 minutes of
play, and the Kiwis eventually received a
penalty for aggressively reaching into a ruck. A
few more mistakes from the New Zealanders
allowed the All-Americans to gain
some yards and keep up the offense.
The Kiwis pushed through the
defensive line of the All-Americans
with five minutes to go in the first
half and scored their first five points
of the game. A direct kick through
the goal posts added another two
points to the Kiwis' score, leaving
the score 10-7 at halftime.
At the beginning of the second

half, both teams stepped up the in
tensity. The All-Americans quickly
put 10 more points on the board,
while the Kiwis added 13 to their
first-half tally to tie up the game at
20-20 with 20 minutes to go.

The All-Americans received a
penalty with just seven minutes left
in the game, which presented the
Kiwis with an opportunity to score
and take the lead. The Kiwi kicker
was feeling the pressure as he
stepped up to take the penalty kick

with a 20-20 scoreboard behind him.
His kick fell directly between the
posts, putting the score to its final
tally of 20-23.

The teams became more aggres
sive in the last minute, as did the
spectators. The All-Americans
charged down the field in hopes of
scoring to recover the lead. Making
it tauntingly close to a touchdown,
the All-Americans were stopped as
the buzzer rang and the game ended
at 20-23, giving the Kiwis their first
win.

"[New Zealand] definitely got
better as a team, and you can see
that in the way they played in the
last two games and the way they
came out ready to play today," Scul
ly said. "They improved dramatical
ly, and by the end, they were a very
good rugby team."
Even though the Kiwis came out
victorious last Saturday, Sherman
will remember the game fondly.
"It was a beautiful day, beautiful
atmosphere and a lot of fun," he said.
