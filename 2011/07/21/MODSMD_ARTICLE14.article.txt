# KIWIS ON THE FARM
## NEW ZEALAND WINS COLLEGIATE RUGBY MATCH 
### RACHEL WOLFARD INTERN 
If you don't know where to look, you might
think that summers at Stanford are totally free
of sports. But even in the dog days of July and
August, the Farm is host to an eclectic bunch of
sporting events that you would never find dur
ing the school year.
The latest unlikely matchup came last Sat
urday, when Stanford's own Steuber Field
hosted a rugby contest between all-stars from
the New Zealand Universities team and USA
Rugby's Collegiate All-Americans. It was the
final matchup of the California Summer Tour,
a three-game series played along the California
coast featuring top collegiate players from the
United States and New Zealand. The current
California tour was intended to showcase up

and-coming young players with hopes of either
playing in the Rugby World Cup that will be
held this September or being recruited to the
newly reinstated Olympic rugby team.
After losing the first two games to drop the
series, the Kiwis prevailed 23-20 after trailing
the U.S. 10-0 in the final game.
The series began on July 9 in San Diego,
where the Kiwis suffered their only defeat.
"[Our] team came out ready to play and
stunned them," said All-American and Cal
player Blaine Scully, reflecting on the first
game.

The second game of the tournament be
tween the New Zealand and American colle
giate teams was held in Santa Barbara on July
13. Stanford rugby coach Matt Sherman said
that the Kiwis had improved and were clearly
working hard as a team. However, the All-

Americans came out ready to play and won the
second game.
Although the All-Americans had already
achieved their victory in the California tour,
the final match was still held at Stanford's Steu
ber Field.

The game began with the American rugby
team on the offensive front. After three min
utes and two scrums, the All-Americans scored
the first seven points of the game. Soon after,
the All-Americans built on their lead, pulling
ahead with three more points to make the
score 10-0.

The intensity picked up after 20 minutes of
play, and the Kiwis eventually received a
penalty for aggressively reaching into a ruck. A
few more mistakes from the New Zealanders
