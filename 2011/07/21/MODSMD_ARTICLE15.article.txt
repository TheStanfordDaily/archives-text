# BEHIND THE BALLGIRL
## 
### ANGEL WANG INTERN 
Alright, I'll admit it. As cheesy as it sounds,
Maria Sharapova has been my hero ever since I
was a kid. She's fearlessly aggressive on the
court, her serves are killer and her mental
strength is remarkable. Did I mention she'd
won 23 WTA titles, including three Grand
Slams and Wimbledon by the age of 17? No big
deal.

At just 25 years old, Sharapova's done it all.
But if you ever watch her play, there's one thing
that you'll never see her do: pick up the tennis
balls after a point.
The fact is, she can't afford to waste energy
on trivial matters like picking up balls. Profes
sionals like Sharapova are playing for the tour
nament win, points for their WTA ranking and,
most importantly, a paycheck. With the stakes
so high, chasing after runaway balls might
break their focus. It's a risk they just can't take.
So if the players don't pick up the balls, who
does? It's a simple question with a simple an
swer: ballpersons.
Ballpersons are really the behind-the-scenes
magicians who ensure a fast-paced, high-inten

sity tennis match. Without them, a match would
be like the first day of high school all over again:
painful, frustrating and seemingly never-end
ing. Thankfully, viewers and players alike can
concentrate on the sport itself because of the
hard work of the ballpersons.
Woah, hold up. Did I just say hard work?
How hard can it be to be a ballperson? All you
have to do is pick up a tennis ball.
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

This year, I have the immense pleasure of
being a ballgirl in the Bank of the West Classic
(BotW). In its 41st year, the BotW is the world's
longest-running female-only tennis tourna
ment and is the first women's stop in the Olym
pus U.S. Open Series. This year, the BotW fea
tures four players ranked top-10 in the world
and 11 ranked in the top 30. So for a helplessly
tennis-crazed fanatic like me, getting to be a
ballgirl in this environment made me the happi
est teenager alive.
I was too happy. There was so much exuber
ance that I had no room for any other emotion.
At my first ballperson training session two
weeks ago, the word "nervous" wasn't even in

my vocabulary. True, I'd never had
any experience as a ballgirl, but I
thought that surely a tennis fanatic
like me would have no trouble pick
ing up tennis balls.
I was wrong. I confess that I had
my fair share of embarrassing mo
ments throughout practice that day,
but through them I was able to ap
preciate the difficulties that come
with being a ballperson.
There are six ballpersons on a
court during the match: one in each
of the four corners and two at the
net (one at each post). A ballperson
must always be alert both mentally
and physically. Since there are six
balls available for the tennis players,
ballpersons must be mentally aware
of who holds balls during the point.
Physically, ballpersons must be
agile when sprinting to the ball and
must be accurate when rolling the
balls to the correct location. Also,
ballpersons must have a good stage
presence; they must stand tall and
attentively when waiting for the
point and must enter and exit the
court in the proper fashion.

At the end of the training ses
sion, I was a bit overwhelmed. So
much information had been thrown
at me, and I was struggling to digest
it all. Over time, with the help of the
incredibly generous ballperson co
ordinators and the additional train
ing sessions, I was able to develop
my skills as a ballperson and fully
appreciate the undercover opera
tions of running a smooth match.
Alright, I'll admit it. I was com
pletely wrong in my original opinion
of ballpersons. But, as cheesy as it
sounds, I'm happy that I was wrong.
Being wrong taught me the danger
of forming preconceived notions
without truly understanding the sit
uation. Being wrong helped me re
alize the importance of having an
open mind and allowed me to ap
preciate all the intricacies of being a
ballperson.
And so I encourage you, too, to
shake off your ballperson preju
dices and come to the BotW this
Saturday. Come watch the players
work hard on the court and the
ballpersons work hard off the
court. Who knows what revelations
await us?
Oh, and did I mention that my
hero Maria Sharapova will be pre
sent at Stanford for the BotW?
No big deal.

balls available for the tennis players,
ballpersons must be mentally aware
of who holds balls during the point.
Physically, ballpersons must be
agile when sprinting to the ball and
must be accurate when rolling the
balls to the correct location. Also,
ballpersons must have a good stage
presence; they must stand tall and
attentively when waiting for the
point and must enter and exit the
court in the proper fashion.

At the end of the training ses
sion, I was a bit overwhelmed. So
much information had been thrown
at me, and I was struggling to digest
it all. Over time, with the help of the
incredibly generous ballperson co
ordinators and the additional train
ing sessions, I was able to develop
my skills as a ballperson and fully
appreciate the undercover opera
tions of running a smooth match.
Alright, I'll admit it. I was com
pletely wrong in my original opinion
of ballpersons. But, as cheesy as it
sounds, I'm happy that I was wrong.
Being wrong taught me the danger
of forming preconceived notions
without truly understanding the sit
uation. Being wrong helped me re
alize the importance of having an
open mind and allowed me to ap
preciate all the intricacies of being a
ballperson.
And so I encourage you, too, to
shake off your ballperson preju
dices and come to the BotW this
Saturday. Come watch the players
work hard on the court and the
ballpersons work hard off the
court. Who knows what revelations
await us?
Oh, and did I mention that my
hero Maria Sharapova will be pre
sent at Stanford for the BotW?
No big deal.
