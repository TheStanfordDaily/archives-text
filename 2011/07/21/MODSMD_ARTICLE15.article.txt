# BEHIND THE BALLGIRL

### ANGEL WANG INTERN 
Alright, I'll admit it. As cheesy as it sounds,
Maria Sharapova has been my hero ever since I
was a kid. She's fearlessly aggressive on the
court, her serves are killer and her mental
strength is remarkable. Did I mention she'd
won 23 WTA titles, including three Grand
Slams and Wimbledon by the age of 17? No big
deal.

At just 25 years old, Sharapova's done it all.
But if you ever watch her play, there's one thing
that you'll never see her do: pick up the tennis
balls after a point.
The fact is, she can't afford to waste energy
on trivial matters like picking up balls. Profes
sionals like Sharapova are playing for the tour
nament win, points for their WTA ranking and,
most importantly, a paycheck. With the stakes
so high, chasing after runaway balls might
break their focus. It's a risk they just can't take.
So if the players don't pick up the balls, who
does? It's a simple question with a simple an
swer: ballpersons.
Ballpersons are really the behind-the-scenes
magicians who ensure a fast-paced, high-inten

sity tennis match. Without them, a match would
be like the first day of high school all over again:
painful, frustrating and seemingly never-end
ing. Thankfully, viewers and players alike can
concentrate on the sport itself because of the
hard work of the ballpersons.
Woah, hold up. Did I just say hard work?
How hard can it be to be a ballperson? All you
have to do is pick up a tennis ball.
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

This year, I have the immense pleasure of
being a ballgirl in the Bank of the West Classic
(BotW). In its 41st year, the BotW is the world's
longest-running female-only tennis tourna
ment and is the first women's stop in the Olym
pus U.S. Open Series. This year, the BotW fea
tures four players ranked top-10 in the world
and 11 ranked in the top 30. So for a helplessly
tennis-crazed fanatic like me, getting to be a
ballgirl in this environment made me the happi
est teenager alive.
I was too happy. There was so much exuber
ance that I had no room for any other emotion.
At my first ballperson training session two
weeks ago, the word "nervous" wasn't even in
