# NETWORK BUBBLES BURSTING

### Tom Taylor 
The phone hacking scandal
that did away with one of
Rupert Murdoch's most
successful newspapers in
the U.K., the News of the
World, officially crossed the pond a
week ago with the announcement of a
preliminary investigation by the FBI
and calls for further scrutiny elsewhere.
Not only does the storm facing News
Corporation perhaps best known
through its Fox brand shows no sign
of relenting, but its effects may be wide
spread and long lasting throughout the
news industry. Although the wrongdo
ing at the News of the World was pretty
serious stuff, including hacking into and
deleting messages from the cell phone
of a child who was abducted and mur
dered, it has been a little surprising how
far and how quickly this wildfire has
spread. Not even Murdoch or his closest
advisors seem safe anymore, and if even
they can't be protected, could the im
pact of the scandal spread to apparently
unconnected divisions of the company
such as Fox Sports?
Within the U.S., Fox has a very im
portant share of the sports broadcasting
market. While ESPN is probably the
market leader and the network most
identifiably associated with sports, the
same could have been said about CNN
and news just a few short years ago. Fox
has worked hard to carve out a big slice
of athletic territory, showing this year's
Super Bowl, holding the exclusive
broadcast rights to the World Series and
recently taking joint share, with ESPN,
of the new Pac-12 football TV contract.
But the corporate world is a fickle place.
If other companies begin to fear that the
Fox brand has been damaged by its as
sociation with this scandal, they may
wish to withdraw their ads from Fox's
programming, creating a funding short
fall that could lead to a much more seri
ous problem than News Corporation's
current drop in share value.
In 2001, the U.K. channel ITV Dig

from the Football League the three
English professional football divisions
below the Premier League for Â£315
million (over ssoomillion) but spectac
ularly failed to meet these costs and im
