# NETWORK BUBBLES BURSTING

### Tom Taylor 
The phone hacking scandal
that did away with one of
Rupert Murdoch's most
successful newspapers in
the U.K., the News of the
World, officially crossed the pond a
week ago with the announcement of a
preliminary investigation by the FBI
and calls for further scrutiny elsewhere.
Not only does the storm facing News
Corporation perhaps best known
through its Fox brand shows no sign
of relenting, but its effects may be wide
spread and long lasting throughout the
news industry. Although the wrongdo
ing at the News of the World was pretty
serious stuff, including hacking into and
deleting messages from the cell phone
of a child who was abducted and mur
dered, it has been a little surprising how
far and how quickly this wildfire has
spread. Not even Murdoch or his closest
advisors seem safe anymore, and if even
they can't be protected, could the im
pact of the scandal spread to apparently
unconnected divisions of the company
such as Fox Sports?
Within the U.S., Fox has a very im
portant share of the sports broadcasting
market. While ESPN is probably the
market leader and the network most
identifiably associated with sports, the
same could have been said about CNN
and news just a few short years ago. Fox
has worked hard to carve out a big slice
of athletic territory, showing this year's
Super Bowl, holding the exclusive
broadcast rights to the World Series and
recently taking joint share, with ESPN,
of the new Pac-12 football TV contract.
But the corporate world is a fickle place.
If other companies begin to fear that the
Fox brand has been damaged by its as
sociation with this scandal, they may
wish to withdraw their ads from Fox's
programming, creating a funding short
fall that could lead to a much more seri
ous problem than News Corporation's
current drop in share value.
In 2001, the U.K. channel ITV Dig
ital bought the rights to show games
from the Football League the three
English professional football divisions
below the Premier League for £315
million (over ssoomillion) but spectac
ularly failed to meet these costs and im
ploded in 2002. The Football League,
and especially smaller clubs who had
committed to large budgets in antici
pation of the money from this contract,
was left with severe financial prob
lems, eventually receiving just a paltry
£4 yes, just $6.50! —in legal com
pensation.

Though the sports industry gener
ates a phenomenal amount of money,
both teams and TV companies often
push themselves to the financial limit in
pursuit of glory. It's a dangerous game
of Russian roulette that has a lot in com
mon with the risks taken by bankers
and economists in the run-up to our re
cent financial crisis. The biggest teams
have managed to convince themselves
that they can spend more and more
each year on players and other expens
es, disregarding the huge debts they are
accruing and the effects of ticket price
hikes on fans.

And it is not just the phone-tapping
crisis that could put this painfully into
perspective. Elsewhere, a Portsmouth

landlady named Karen Murphy is
fighting both BSkyß (in which Mur
doch holds a significant share and
which, until recently, he planned to
buy outright) and ESPN over the right
to show Premier League soccer match
es in her pub. Instead of screening
games through the satellite or cable
systems offered in the U.K., she sub
scribed to a Greek satellite provider
that offered games for around one
tenth of the cost. Technically, this was
in breach of U.K. copyright law, but by
arguing that the rules break the Euro
pean Union's agreements on free
trade, she has taken the case all the way
to the European Court of Justice. A
final ruling is still pending, but earlier
this year, an advocate at the court came
out in support of her stance.
If her case is upheld, it would be a
major blow for BSkyß, ESPN and the
English Premier League. BSkyß alone
paid £1.6 billion ($2.6 billion) for TV
rights for the 2010-13 period, and a sig
nificant slice of this money filters down
to the teams, funding big-money player
transfers and new stadiums while allow
ing clubs with huge debts to somehow
survive. Without the exclusive right to
screen these games in the U.K., the

number of subscriptions and amount of
advertising revenue would plummet.
Even assuming BSkyß had the spare
cash to still pay off this fee, it likely
wouldn't want to, leaving an inconceiv
able hole in budgets across the board.

Most people probably assume that,
as always, Murdoch will win out in the
end, but suddenly he doesn't quite seem
so invincible. The economic crisis was

triggered by some seemingly (at the
time) insignificant events that quickly
spiraled out of control. Could illegal
phone tapping and a pub landlady be
the pins that burst the sports bubble?

Tom Taylor hopes to sue ESPN for
monopolizing his television screen.

wish to withdraw their ads from Fox's
programming, creating a funding short
fall that could lead to a much more seri
ous problem than News Corporation's
current drop in share value.
In 2001, the U.K. channel ITV Dig
ital bought the rights to show games
from the Football League the three
English professional football divisions
below the Premier League for £315
million (over ssoomillion) but spectac
ularly failed to meet these costs and im
ploded in 2002. The Football League,
and especially smaller clubs who had
committed to large budgets in antici
pation of the money from this contract,
was left with severe financial prob
lems, eventually receiving just a paltry
£4 yes, just $6.50! —in legal com
pensation.

Though the sports industry gener
ates a phenomenal amount of money,
both teams and TV companies often
push themselves to the financial limit in
pursuit of glory. It's a dangerous game
of Russian roulette that has a lot in com
mon with the risks taken by bankers
and economists in the run-up to our re
cent financial crisis. The biggest teams
have managed to convince themselves
that they can spend more and more
each year on players and other expens
es, disregarding the huge debts they are
accruing and the effects of ticket price
hikes on fans.

And it is not just the phone-tapping
crisis that could put this painfully into
perspective. Elsewhere, a Portsmouth

landlady named Karen Murphy is
fighting both BSkyß (in which Mur
doch holds a significant share and
which, until recently, he planned to
buy outright) and ESPN over the right
to show Premier League soccer match
es in her pub. Instead of screening
games through the satellite or cable
systems offered in the U.K., she sub
scribed to a Greek satellite provider
that offered games for around one
tenth of the cost. Technically, this was
in breach of U.K. copyright law, but by
arguing that the rules break the Euro
pean Union's agreements on free
trade, she has taken the case all the way
to the European Court of Justice. A
final ruling is still pending, but earlier
this year, an advocate at the court came
out in support of her stance.
If her case is upheld, it would be a
major blow for BSkyß, ESPN and the
English Premier League. BSkyß alone
paid £1.6 billion ($2.6 billion) for TV
rights for the 2010-13 period, and a sig
nificant slice of this money filters down
to the teams, funding big-money player
transfers and new stadiums while allow
ing clubs with huge debts to somehow
survive. Without the exclusive right to
screen these games in the U.K., the

number of subscriptions and amount of
advertising revenue would plummet.
Even assuming BSkyß had the spare
cash to still pay off this fee, it likely
wouldn't want to, leaving an inconceiv
able hole in budgets across the board.

Most people probably assume that,
as always, Murdoch will win out in the
end, but suddenly he doesn't quite seem
so invincible. The economic crisis was

triggered by some seemingly (at the
time) insignificant events that quickly
spiraled out of control. Could illegal
phone tapping and a pub landlady be
the pins that burst the sports bubble?
