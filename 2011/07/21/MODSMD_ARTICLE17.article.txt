# SPORTS BRIEFS
## Cardinal athletes on four more watch lists 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF â€“ Joseph Beyda 
As watch-list nominations wrapped up this
week, three Stanford football players who had
been named to earlier lists were recognized
again for four awards.

Heisman Trophy runner-up Andrew Luck
was nominated for both the Walter Camp and
Davey O'Brien Awards for the player of the
year and the nation's top quarterback, respec
tively. He was one of three finalists for both
awards last year as a redshirt sophomore be
fore losing out to Auburn quarterback Cam
Newton in each.

Rising junior linebacker Shayne Skov was
named to his fourth watch list, the highest tally
for any Stanford football player this offseason.
After posting double-digit tackles in a bowl
game for his second straight season, he's in the
running for the Butkus Award for the best line
backer in the country.

Stanford also has an outside shot at winning
the Doak Walker Award for the second time in
three seasons, with rising junior Stepfan Taylor
on this year's list of the nation's top running

backs and hoping to live up to the legacy of2ooB
winner Toby Gerhart. Part of a by-committee
running core for the Cardinal, Taylor emerged
as Stanford's top back with over 200 yards per
game in 2010.
