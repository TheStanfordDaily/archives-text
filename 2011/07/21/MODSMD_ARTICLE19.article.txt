# Alumna Walsh wins gold in Moscow
## 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Former Stanford women's vol
leyball standout Kerri Walsh won
gold at the FIVB Swatch Moscow
Grand Slam in Russia this week,
playing alongside partner Misty
May-Treanor.
The two-time Olympic gold
medalists in beach volleyball have
now won 37 of the 67 FIVB tourna
ments that they have played in.
Their last title came at the Bejing

Grand Slam in June, and the two
were runners-up at the FIVB
World Championship late last
month.

Walsh was the all-around star of
Stanford's volleyball team in the
late '9os before making the transi
tion to the beach. She was only the
second player in NCAA history to
be named a first-team All-Ameri
can for all four years when she
achieved the feat in 1999, also being
recognized as the AVCA Co-Play
er of the Year her senior season.
The FIVB Tour will make its
next stop this coming week in
Canada for the Quebec Open.
