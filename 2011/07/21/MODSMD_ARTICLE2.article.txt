## UNIVERSITY Summer income cuts student costs Officials say R&DE summer revenue subsidizes room, board 
### BILLY GALLAGHER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Every summer, Stanford Conferences hosts be
tween 250 and 300 conferences on campus with a total
of between 16,000 and 20,000 guests. These confer
ences cover a broad spectrum of subjects and audi
ences of nearly all ages. All Residential & Dining En
terprises (R&DE) revenue generated from summer
conferences hosted on campus is used to subsidize the
cost of room and board for students during the rest of
the year, according to University officials.
The Stanford Conference Office was opened in the
1960s and has grown significantly in the decades since
then. It is currently one of the largest collegiate confer
ence operations in the world; in fact, Stanford repre
sented the largest conference operation sample in a re
cent study by the Association of Collegiate Conference
and Event Directors, International (ACCED-I),
which represents conference professionals in institu
tions of higher education.

"Every conference... is directly aligned with and
tied in some way to teaching, learning and/or research
ing at Stanford," wrote executive director of Stanford
Conferences Philip Gin in an email to The Daily. "Typ
ically, that means that faculty and/or students are in
volved with teaching the content of the conference, or
they are attending the conference to learn more about
the content."

The largest of these conferences include the Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), an academic
opportunity for middle and high school students that
has run since 1991; All Sports Camp, a daytime sports
activities camp for 7- to 12-year-old boys and girls that
has existed for over 30 years; and High School Summer
College, a program that allows 16- to 20-year-olds who
have not yet attended college to take summer classes at
Stanford for college credit.

The University also allows non-Stanford under
graduates and graduate students to take Stanford
courses during the summer for transfer credit to their
university or college.

"Student Housing facilities are used by a variety of
groups and organizations each summer," wrote execu
tive director of Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an
email to The Daily. "This usage of our residences
makes it possible for students to stay on campus in the
summer for work, study or research; supports pro-
grams across the campus and helps
keep academic-year room rates down
by providing income."

Branner Hall, Crothers Hall, Mir
rielees Apartments and Manzanita
Park (Castano and Lantana), as well
as parts of Escondido Village, Rains
Apartments, Munger Graduate Resi
dence and Lyman Graduate Resi
dences are used for student housing in
the summer.

Murray, Yost and East in Gover
nor's Corner; Otero and Rinconada in
Wilbur Hall and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
are all off-line for renovation this sum
mer.
All remaining facilities are used for
summer conferences. All Sports
Camp uses a variety of the athletic fa
cilities. EPGY residents live in 16 cam
pus facilities: Enchanted Broccoli For
est, Narnia, Kappa Alpha, Jerry, Sla
vianskii Dom, Durand, Synergy, Phi
Kappa Psi, Kairos, Bob, Xanadu,
Terra, Zap, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Delta
Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta. The
program also uses around 35 class
rooms.

The University registrar handles

classroom scheduling, and Stanford
Summer Session has first priority on
the rooms before conferences can use
them.

"Because R&DE is a self-funded
department at Stanford, R&DE must
generate its own revenues required to
provide services to Stanford stu
dents," Gin said. "Without the contri
butions of revenues from Stanford
Conferences, the cost for those ser
vices to Stanford students, primarily
housing and meals, would be signifi
cantly higher, and Stanford students
would then have to carry the burden
of those costs."

Because it is a private institution,
Stanford University is not required to
release financial figures for summer
revenue. Several University and con
ference officials declined to provide
an exact dollar amount for how much
R&DE makes during the summer
and how much this lowers the cost of
student living during the year.
The ancillary benefits of summer
conferences, while harder to measure,
are nonetheless valuable, Gin said.
According to Gin, R&DE employs
between 60 and 80 Stanford students
each summer to support the business
of Stanford Conferences.

Many of the individual confer
ences employ Stanford students as
support staff. For example, EPGY

employs close to 100 Stanford under
graduates each summer as well as
graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers. High School Summer
College hires several dozen under
graduates as residential mentors.
Additionally, summer conferences
use many campus services and facili
ties during a period when few Stan
ford students are on campus, helping
to keep various Stanford employees
from being laid off during the sum
mer.

"Although EPGY makes money
for the University, that is not its mis
sion or motivation," Rick Sommer,
managing director of EPGY, wrote in
an email to The Daily. "EPGY is a
program that provides outstanding
academic opportunities to talented
pre-college students, and it serves the
University in a variety of ways."
"Teaching and learning comprise a
large part of Stanford University's
academic mission," Gin said. "And
each summer, a great deal of teaching
and learning occurs at Stanford
through the conferences hosted on
campus. In this way, Stanford Confer
ences is not only aligned with Stan
ford's mission, I belie ve it directly con
tributes to it."

between 60 and 80 Stanford students
each summer to support the business
of Stanford Conferences.

Many of the individual confer
ences employ Stanford students as
support staff. For example, EPGY

employs close to 100 Stanford under
graduates each summer as well as
graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers. High School Summer
College hires several dozen under
graduates as residential mentors.
Additionally, summer conferences
use many campus services and facili
ties during a period when few Stan
ford students are on campus, helping
to keep various Stanford employees
from being laid off during the sum
mer.

"Although EPGY makes money
for the University, that is not its mis
sion or motivation," Rick Sommer,
managing director of EPGY, wrote in
an email to The Daily. "EPGY is a
program that provides outstanding
academic opportunities to talented
pre-college students, and it serves the
University in a variety of ways."
"Teaching and learning comprise a
large part of Stanford University's
academic mission," Gin said. "And
each summer, a great deal of teaching
and learning occurs at Stanford
through the conferences hosted on
campus. In this way, Stanford Confer
ences is not only aligned with Stan
ford's mission, I belie ve it directly con
tributes to it."

Every summer, Stanford Conferences hosts be
tween 250 and 300 conferences on campus with a total
of between 16,000 and 20,000 guests. These confer
ences cover a broad spectrum of subjects and audi
ences of nearly all ages. All Residential & Dining En
terprises (R&DE) revenue generated from summer
conferences hosted on campus is used to subsidize the
cost of room and board for students during the rest of
the year, according to University officials.
The Stanford Conference Office was opened in the
1960s and has grown significantly in the decades since
then. It is currently one of the largest collegiate confer
ence operations in the world; in fact, Stanford repre
sented the largest conference operation sample in a re
cent study by the Association of Collegiate Conference
and Event Directors, International (ACCED-I),
which represents conference professionals in institu
tions of higher education.

"Every conference... is directly aligned with and
tied in some way to teaching, learning and/or research
ing at Stanford," wrote executive director of Stanford
Conferences Philip Gin in an email to The Daily. "Typ
ically, that means that faculty and/or students are in
volved with teaching the content of the conference, or
they are attending the conference to learn more about
the content."

The largest of these conferences include the Educa
tion Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), an academic
opportunity for middle and high school students that
has run since 1991; All Sports Camp, a daytime sports
activities camp for 7- to 12-year-old boys and girls that
has existed for over 30 years; and High School Summer
College, a program that allows 16- to 20-year-olds who
have not yet attended college to take summer classes at
Stanford for college credit.

The University also allows non-Stanford under
graduates and graduate students to take Stanford
courses during the summer for transfer credit to their
university or college.

"Student Housing facilities are used by a variety of
groups and organizations each summer," wrote execu
tive director of Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an
email to The Daily. "This usage of our residences
makes it possible for students to stay on campus in the
summer for work, study or research; supports pro-
grams across the campus and helps
keep academic-year room rates down
by providing income."

Branner Hall, Crothers Hall, Mir
rielees Apartments and Manzanita
Park (Castano and Lantana), as well
as parts of Escondido Village, Rains
Apartments, Munger Graduate Resi
dence and Lyman Graduate Resi
dences are used for student housing in
the summer.

Murray, Yost and East in Gover
nor's Corner; Otero and Rinconada in
Wilbur Hall and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
are all off-line for renovation this sum
mer.
All remaining facilities are used for
summer conferences. All Sports
Camp uses a variety of the athletic fa
cilities. EPGY residents live in 16 cam
pus facilities: Enchanted Broccoli For
est, Narnia, Kappa Alpha, Jerry, Sla
vianskii Dom, Durand, Synergy, Phi
Kappa Psi, Kairos, Bob, Xanadu,
Terra, Zap, Pi Beta Phi, Delta Delta
Delta and Kappa Alpha Theta. The
program also uses around 35 class
rooms.

The University registrar handles

classroom scheduling, and Stanford
Summer Session has first priority on
the rooms before conferences can use
them.

"Because R&DE is a self-funded
department at Stanford, R&DE must
generate its own revenues required to
provide services to Stanford stu
dents," Gin said. "Without the contri
butions of revenues from Stanford
Conferences, the cost for those ser
vices to Stanford students, primarily
housing and meals, would be signifi
cantly higher, and Stanford students
would then have to carry the burden
of those costs."

Because it is a private institution,
Stanford University is not required to
release financial figures for summer
revenue. Several University and con
ference officials declined to provide
an exact dollar amount for how much
R&DE makes during the summer
and how much this lowers the cost of
student living during the year.
The ancillary benefits of summer
conferences, while harder to measure,
are nonetheless valuable, Gin said.

between 60 and 80 Stanford students
each summer to support the business
