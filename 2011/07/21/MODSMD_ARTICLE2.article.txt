## UNIVERSITY Summer income cuts student costs Officials say R&DE summer revenue subsidizes room, board 
### BILLY GALLAGHER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Every summer, Stanford Conferences hosts be
tween 250 and 300 conferences on campus with a total
of between 16,000 and 20,000 guests. These confer
ences cover a broad spectrum of subjects and audi
ences of nearly all ages. All Residential & Dining En
terprises (R&DE) revenue generated from summer
conferences hosted on campus is used to subsidize the
cost of room and board for students during the rest of
the year, according to University officials.
The Stanford Conference Office was opened in the
1960s and has grown significantly in the decades since
then. It is currently one of the largest collegiate confer

The largest of these conferences include the Educa

opportunity for middle and high school students that
has run since 1991; All Sports Camp, a daytime sports
activities camp for 7- to 12-year-old boys and girls that
has existed for over 30 years; and High School Summer
College, a program that allows 16- to 20-year-olds who
have not yet attended college to take summer classes at
Stanford for college credit.

The University also allows non-Stanford under
graduates and graduate students to take Stanford
courses during the summer for transfer credit to their
university or college.

"Student Housing facilities are used by a variety of
groups and organizations each summer," wrote execu
tive director of Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an
email to The Daily. "This usage of our residences
makes it possible for students to stay on campus in the
summer for work, study or research; supports pro-
