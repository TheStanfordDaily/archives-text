## The
						end of an enchanted era Inside a midnight premiere of the final 'Harry Potter film 
### KATY STORCH 
Somewhere between pulling open
the tinted glass door of Century
Redwood City 20 theaters and
taking my first step inside, I
crossed a powerful wormhole
reminiscent of Platform 93/4, the magical
connection between the ordinary world
and the wizarding world in J.K. Rowl
ing's internationally renowned "Harry
Potter" series. With a bewildered glance
around the room and one foot in the door
already, I took my second step into the
cinema complex to face dark wizards,
dragons, goblins and worst of all, a
farewell to a beloved fantasy world, on
the night of the "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows: Part 2" premiere.
On that night and that night only, it
seemed that being a "Harry Potter" en
thusiast almost to the point of mad
ness â€” was acceptable. More than ac
ceptable, even, it was encouraged.
A flash of electric pink caught my eye,
and I looked to my left at a friend dressed
in Hufflepuff robes, a chain-link choker
necklace and a bright pink, mohawk
style wig, playing the role of Nymphado
ra Tonks for the night. Her cedar wand,
once a chopstick, poked out of the pock
et in her robes, and she grinned just like
the imaginary, playful character she was
portraying might.
And to my right, I spotted dark, ratty
hair and hollowed-out eyes surely
anyone at this theater on the night of the
midnight premiere could tell that this is
the dark witch Bellatrix Lestrange. A
torrent of spells surged out of her
mouth: "Crucio! Imperio! Avada Ke
davra!" And I gasped along with the
others those spells are unforgivable
curses, after all.
After entering the complex, we made
our way toward our theater and waited in
line until we could enter. At 8:00 p.m., an
employee approached the momentarily
dormant line of people and undipped the
red, velvet-covered chain that held us at
bay. I waited patiently with the rest of the
people in line to move through the red
velvet gateway another wormhole
and have my ticket checked.
But upon my approach to the ticket
examiner, a rush of blood spurred my

feet to move. As I was given the "okay"
to pass, I ran through the portal and into
a throng of ravenous fans, all sprinting to
the doorway of the theater in pursuit of
one thing: the "best" seats. In the last
stretch of the race, we hurtled toward the
door, shoving and elbowing one another
aside as we fought for the perfect seats
not too far back, but not too far forward.
The heaving and gasping after the com
petition was worth it, for this was the last
time we would have the opportunity to
race for seating at a "Harry Potter"
movie premiere.

After the dash into the theater, we
saved our seats with extra blankets and
clothes and walked around the complex
to take in the sights. It seemed that every
character was cast in our premiere audi
ence the half-giant, the house-elf, the
Gryffindor Quidditch team and even the
beautiful new bride in the movie (al-

though this particular por-

trayal of a sparkly

faced, fake-

eyelashed,

leotard

wearing Fleur by a teenage girl roused
more talk of a Lady Gaga imitation than
a "Harry Potter" character).
But beyond this enthusiasm for role
playing, what was most flummoxing was
the interactions between strangers at the
theater. At around 11:00 p.m., one
woman wearing a red wig and dumpy
clothes ran up to a young girl who was ob
viously playing the character's daughter.
"Ginny!" she gasped. "I've been look
ing for you everywhere!"
Another teenage girl, wearing a white
swim cap, flaunting penciled-on slits for
nostrils, and her face encrusted with
thick, white paint threatened and chal
lenged all those playing Harry Potter
throughout the night. The "actress," ob
viously playing Harry's nemesis Lord
Voldemort, held up a sign that says
"Down with Potter!"

A sort of ethereal spirit of community
hung in the air. Every interaction be-

tween strangers was a testament to

the power of creativity

both Rowling's cre-

ativity and that of

her costumed
