# SECRET GARDEN
## Exploring history, art and legend in the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden 
### EMMA PAYNE INTERN 
To a casual passerby, the corner of Santa Teresa
and Lomita Drive may appear to be an over
grown blight amid an otherwise perfectly man
icured campus. However, a few steps down a
rocky, dirt bike path reveal what is actually a
culturally rich array of wooden and stone sculptures un
derneath a serene canopy of trees.

On the third Sunday of each month at 2 p.m., two do
cents from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visu
al Arts give a free tour of this often-overlooked street cor
ner, home of the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden. In
a recent tour, guides Marion Smith and Joan Inglis lead
students, community members and other visitors around
the various stone and wooden sculptures while simultane
ously detailing the history of the garden and telling ancient
legends that relate to each piece of art.
The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden was the
brainchild of James Mason '9l M.A. '93, an anthropology
grad student at the time of the project's conception. After
completing his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Mason
spent a significant amount of time performing research in
Papua New Guinea, a small country off the coast of Aus
tralia. He first traveled there in 1987 and returned in 1989.
