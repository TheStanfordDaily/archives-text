# SECRET GARDEN
## Exploring history, art and legend in the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden 
### EMMA PAYNE INTERN 
To a casual passerby, the corner of Santa Teresa
and Lomita Drive may appear to be an over
grown blight amid an otherwise perfectly man
icured campus. However, a few steps down a
rocky, dirt bike path reveal what is actually a
culturally rich array of wooden and stone sculptures un
derneath a serene canopy of trees.

On the third Sunday of each month at 2 p.m., two do
cents from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visu
al Arts give a free tour of this often-overlooked street cor
ner, home of the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden. In
a recent tour, guides Marion Smith and Joan Inglis lead
students, community members and other visitors around
the various stone and wooden sculptures while simultane
ously detailing the history of the garden and telling ancient
legends that relate to each piece of art.
The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden was the
brainchild of James Mason '9l M.A. '93, an anthropology
grad student at the time of the project's conception. After
completing his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Mason
spent a significant amount of time performing research in
Papua New Guinea, a small country off the coast of Aus
tralia. He first traveled there in 1987 and returned in 1989.


CHANEL ZHAN/The Stanford Daily
He formed close bonds with the
people of the Middle Sepik River
region that he studied, and at the
suggestion of two artists that he
met, Mason resolved to bring some
Papua New Guinean artists back
with him to Stanford to create a
sculpture garden.

He returned to Palo Alto and
spent five years raising funds for the
project reportedly raising in ex
cess of $1.5 million and then in
May of 1994,11 carvers came to Stan
ford from Papua New Guinea. Addi
tionally, Mason formed a joint team
of American and New Guinean land
scape architects, and together, the
group began construction of the
sculpture garden. The building mate
rials were similarly cross cultural,
with wood imported from Papua
New Guinea and lava stone shipped
from the Mono Lake region of Cali
fornia for the sculptures.

The artists came from the
Kwoma and the latmul societies,
both of which are located in the
Middle Sepik River region. As the
guides carefully pointed out, each
group has a unique artistic style with
notable characteristics visible in the
sculptures here at Stanford. For ex
ample, where latmul art tends to
feature more curves and small in
dentations called "wind waves,"

Kwoma art is rougher and utilizes a
zigzag pattern called "chevron."

Shared by both societies, howev
er, is a great emphasis on legends
that they preserve through their
sculptures. As Smith and Inglis
snaked the group through the vari
ous pieces of art, they stopped to tell
a complex tale at each one. The sto
ries ranged from how the Sepik
River was formed by crocodile tears
to the discovery of the Sago tree and
yams by the great warrior, Sussep.
The guides described how the croc
odile was responsible for creating
the world and helping to make it
round and pointed out towering
sculptures with wagging tongues
apparently used to instill fear.

"The world was flat, like a sand
wich with no filling," said Inglis to
the attentive tour group. "Then the
crocodile came, and with the help of
the wind, they separated the
Earth."

Walking through the display of
painted pillars, wooden figures and
rock sculptures, it is easy to forget
that one is in the middle of a large
and bustling university campus.
This sense of intertwined communi
ties is hardly accidental, giving the

Papua New Guineans an opportu
nity to share their culture with the
Stanford community while dis
pelling the Western stereotypes of
"primitive." While their artwork
had previously been displayed as
"artifacts," the completion of the
garden allows it to be appreciated as
what it is intended to be art.
"The things that we made here .
.. are our most sacred things
things from the souls of our ances
tors," wrote Papua New Guinean
artist Navi Saunambui for a plaque
in the garden. "We brought them
here, and now we leave them for
you."
Despite cultural differences, the
visiting Papua New Guineans began
to bond with the greater Stanford
community. During their four
month stay, the artists participated
in weekly Friday barbeques, at
which they played music and
demonstrated art techniques to
their Bay Area counterparts.
"You saw us, and you thought
we were from a wild area the jun
gle," said a translator for one of the
artists, Kwospi Marek, before re
turning home to Papua New Guinea
in 1994, his words also on a plaque.

"You didn't know us, and we didn't
know you. But now we know each
other, and we are brothers. Now we
are friends."

As the project was a blending of
two cultures, the Papua New
Guinean artists stayed true to the
basics of their native art forms, but
did not try to re-create their home
land. Instead, some of the pieces are
reinterpretations of what they
found at the Rodin sculpture gar
den, including "The Thinker" and
"The Gates of Hell" (though the
artists couldn't get over the seem
ingly "useless" nature of the Rodin
garden as their native sculpture gar
dens serve as important meeting
houses). As further proof of the cul
tural mixing, the artists used plants
native to California in the garden
and American carving tools and
acrylic paints.

In recent weeks, there has been
discussion among the Cantor staff
about ending the monthly tours due
to sparse attendance. However, of
ficial tours or not, Smith and Inglis
plan to continue sharing their
knowledge of the Papua New
Guinea legends and art and hope
that the garden can be enjoyed by
the Stanford community for years
to come.

"Yeah, wood doesn't last forev
er," Smith said in the tour's closing
moments. "But we hope it will last a
long time."

cess of $1.5 million and then in
May of 1994,11 carvers came to Stan
ford from Papua New Guinea. Addi
tionally, Mason formed a joint team
of American and New Guinean land
scape architects, and together, the
group began construction of the
sculpture garden. The building mate
rials were similarly cross cultural,
with wood imported from Papua
New Guinea and lava stone shipped
from the Mono Lake region of Cali
fornia for the sculptures.

The artists came from the
Kwoma and the latmul societies,
both of which are located in the
Middle Sepik River region. As the
guides carefully pointed out, each
group has a unique artistic style with
notable characteristics visible in the
sculptures here at Stanford. For ex
ample, where latmul art tends to
feature more curves and small in
dentations called "wind waves,"

Kwoma art is rougher and utilizes a
zigzag pattern called "chevron."

Shared by both societies, howev
er, is a great emphasis on legends
that they preserve through their
sculptures. As Smith and Inglis
snaked the group through the vari
ous pieces of art, they stopped to tell
a complex tale at each one. The sto
ries ranged from how the Sepik
River was formed by crocodile tears
to the discovery of the Sago tree and
yams by the great warrior, Sussep.
The guides described how the croc
odile was responsible for creating
the world and helping to make it
round and pointed out towering
sculptures with wagging tongues
apparently used to instill fear.

"The world was flat, like a sand
wich with no filling," said Inglis to
the attentive tour group. "Then the
crocodile came, and with the help of
the wind, they separated the
Earth."

Walking through the display of
painted pillars, wooden figures and
rock sculptures, it is easy to forget
that one is in the middle of a large
and bustling university campus.
This sense of intertwined communi
ties is hardly accidental, giving the

Papua New Guineans an opportu
nity to share their culture with the
Stanford community while dis
pelling the Western stereotypes of
"primitive." While their artwork
had previously been displayed as
"artifacts," the completion of the
garden allows it to be appreciated as
what it is intended to be art.
"The things that we made here .
.. are our most sacred things
things from the souls of our ances
tors," wrote Papua New Guinean
artist Navi Saunambui for a plaque
in the garden. "We brought them
here, and now we leave them for
you."
Despite cultural differences, the
visiting Papua New Guineans began
to bond with the greater Stanford
community. During their four
month stay, the artists participated
in weekly Friday barbeques, at
which they played music and
demonstrated art techniques to
their Bay Area counterparts.
"You saw us, and you thought
we were from a wild area the jun
gle," said a translator for one of the
artists, Kwospi Marek, before re
turning home to Papua New Guinea
in 1994, his words also on a plaque.

"You didn't know us, and we didn't
know you. But now we know each
other, and we are brothers. Now we
are friends."

As the project was a blending of
two cultures, the Papua New
Guinean artists stayed true to the
basics of their native art forms, but
did not try to re-create their home
land. Instead, some of the pieces are
reinterpretations of what they
found at the Rodin sculpture gar
den, including "The Thinker" and
"The Gates of Hell" (though the
artists couldn't get over the seem
ingly "useless" nature of the Rodin
garden as their native sculpture gar
dens serve as important meeting
houses). As further proof of the cul
tural mixing, the artists used plants
native to California in the garden
and American carving tools and
acrylic paints.

In recent weeks, there has been
discussion among the Cantor staff
about ending the monthly tours due
to sparse attendance. However, of
ficial tours or not, Smith and Inglis
plan to continue sharing their
knowledge of the Papua New
Guinea legends and art and hope
that the garden can be enjoyed by
the Stanford community for years
to come.

"Yeah, wood doesn't last forev
er," Smith said in the tour's closing
moments. "But we hope it will last a
long time."

To a casual passerby, the corner of Santa Teresa
and Lomita Drive may appear to be an over
grown blight amid an otherwise perfectly man
icured campus. However, a few steps down a
rocky, dirt bike path reveal what is actually a
culturally rich array of wooden and stone sculptures un
derneath a serene canopy of trees.

On the third Sunday of each month at 2 p.m., two do
cents from the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visu
al Arts give a free tour of this often-overlooked street cor
ner, home of the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden. In
a recent tour, guides Marion Smith and Joan Inglis lead
students, community members and other visitors around
the various stone and wooden sculptures while simultane
ously detailing the history of the garden and telling ancient
legends that relate to each piece of art.
The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden was the
brainchild of James Mason '9l M.A. '93, an anthropology
grad student at the time of the project's conception. After
completing his undergraduate degree at Stanford, Mason
spent a significant amount of time performing research in
Papua New Guinea, a small country off the coast of Aus
tralia. He first traveled there in 1987 and returned in 1989.

He formed close bonds with the
people of the Middle Sepik River
region that he studied, and at the
suggestion of two artists that he
met, Mason resolved to bring some
Papua New Guinean artists back
with him to Stanford to create a
sculpture garden.

He returned to Palo Alto and
spent five years raising funds for the
project reportedly raising in ex
cess of $1.5 million and then in
May of 1994,11 carvers came to Stan
ford from Papua New Guinea. Addi
tionally, Mason formed a joint team
