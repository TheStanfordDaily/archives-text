## MUSIC REVIEW Desplat's 'Potter' track a fitting finale 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
The soundtrack for "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows: Part 2," arguably the
most anticipated movie of our genera
tion, has been as important as the film itself.
Fans expected the best of the final movie, and
fortunately, composer Alexandre Desplat rose
valiantly to the occasion, creating a nearly per
fect soundtrack for an equally magnificent visual
extravaganza.

Joining the "Potter" crew as a successor to
the legendary John Williams who also com
posed the iconic themes for "Jaws," "Star Wars"
and "Indiana Jones" Desplat was something
of an underdog facing the scrutiny of millions of
fans. His first composition for the series, the
"Deathly Hallows: Part 1" soundtrack, was cer
tainly beautiful, but lacking.
Desplat's greatest failure is his propensity to
compose 'generic' pieces, rich in mood but lack
ing in discernible style. His inadequacies were
most evident in "Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows: Part 1," where the music was just there,
but uninspired. The pieces would have fit nicely
into even a "Twilight" soundtrack something

that, for many "Potter" fans, screams blasphe
my.
It seems for "Part 2," Desplat did his
research, understanding both what the fans
wanted and what the film begged for. Familiar
components make a reappearance; the beloved
"Hedwig's Theme," for instance, which encap
sulates the wizarding world in its innocence, can
be found in "Dragon Flight." Most notably,
Desplat nicely struck the balance between majes
tic and despondent, moods between which the
final movie quickly flickers.
One of the best pieces is the short but

majestic "Statues." It plays in the film during
one of the most moving segments the ini
tial stages of the Battle of Hogwarts, where the
dark forces seem to be overwhelmingly defeat
ing the defenders and Harry, Ron and
Hermione realize, perhaps for the first time,
the magnitude of what they are trying to
accomplish.
The surprising emotion revealed in the

travels through Snape's memories are reflected
in the compositions as well. For instance, the
first piece, "Lily's Theme," features a haunting,
deep melody that both the powerfully tragic
denouement of "Snape's Demise" and the
beautiful "Resurrection Stone" echo both
shrewd compositional moves by Desplat. The
longest, and by far the most perfect, part of
the soundtrack is "Severus and Lily," a gentle

piece evoking their beautifully innocent
friendship.
In short, Desplat took a cue from his pre
decessors, composing noticeable and memo
rable themes for "Part 2." Fans will sit up and
notice the anxious violins signaling trouble,
the triumphant blasts of victory and the quiet,
peaceful melody in the very last scene at
Hogwarts. Desplat has finally managed to

enhance the visual effects and emotional thrills
of "Harry Potter," just in time for the most
important movie of the series. Undoubtedly,
the soundtrack is a perfect fit to the grand end
of a long, satisfying era.
