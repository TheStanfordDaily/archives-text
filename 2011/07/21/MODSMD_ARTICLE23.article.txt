# TV RECAP
## Ash introduces the world to Taiwan 
### â€“ eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
After taking a week off for some reason or
another, "The Bachelorette" is back, and
by god, it only took a week for me to forget
how annoying her voice is. Honestly, 10 minutes
in and I was ready to eat a stick of lit dynamite, but
I stuck through it for you, my loyal readers.
Ash started out by informing us about the
existence of Taiwan. It's known as the hidden jewel
of Asia because, fun fact, "not a lot of people know
about it!" It also happens to be one of the best
places to fall in love, along with China, Japan,
Vietnam, Taipei, North Korea and my basement.

Cue Ashley saying that she's ready for a fresh start,
again, and off we go!
First thing I noticed is that Constantine and
Ben, the least-attractive and most-monotonous

members of the gang, are both still here. I theorize
that she's really only interested in one of them, but
she can't tell them apart so she's afraid to send one
of them home just in case she sends the wrong one
by mistake. Also remaining: Lucas, the Southern
gent; JP, the ridiculously hot New Yorker who is


COURTESY ABC
the obvious winner; upbeat Ryan

and harmless little Ames.

Her first one-on-one date is
with Constanturd, and literally

nothing interesting happens.
Honestly. I take really extensive
notes as I watch so that I can

write these articles, and my only
notes for this date were "pretty
sure this is Constantine and not
Ben, but could be mistaken."
Moving on.

The second one-on-one is
with Ben, who I still can't really
figure out. This totally goes along
with my initial theory about her
not being able to tell them apart
she's taking one and then the
other out so that she can figure
out which one she wants!

Anyway, the two of them ride a
moped around Taiwan as Ben
flirts like a pedophile ("stick with
me, kiddo"). As someone who
has both driven a moped and

ridden on the back of someone
else's (I know, my life is cooler
than yours), let me just establish
that they are seriously not
romantic. They're mostly goofy.
Fortunately, so is Ben. The two
of them have some kind of

super-long, monotonous sharing
of feelings, and Ash decided that
she's falling in love. She let him
stay the night, though they did
n't sleep together (I'm pretty
sure they're not allowed to yet).
Back at the bachelor pad, JP was
getting jealous, and it is so, so, so
sexy, mostly because everything
JP does is sexy.
The group date with Lucas,

Ames and JP is the most awk-

ward thing I've ever seen in my
life, and I watched "The Office"
for four seasons. They're taking
fake wedding photos and every
one is kissing Ashley for the
camera in front of everyone else,
and JP (gorgeous in his tux) is
losing it. You can see his Adam's
apple bobbing as he swallows his
rage, and again, he manages to
make surly and sullen sexy.
Honestly, if that man doesn't

win this thing, I'm calling dibs.
Winning moments from the
group date: Ames informs

Ashley that "I was really unpop
ular until I was 16." Really,

Ames? I am shocked. Incidentally,
he delivered that one while wear-

ing pink pants.
At the end of the day, Ash
ended up sending home Ryan,
which made me really sad but
made sense. Ryan has all the

wonder of a little kid; he finds
joy in literally everything, and
he's positive about everything,
which is charming in the short
term but wears on you, and the
two never really had good
chemistry. She also sent home
Lucas, which was a good deal

more surprising the
Southern gent had finally start-

Ed to grow on me.
The episode ended with
Ashley crying, and absolutely no
one was surprised.
