\/\/ to the world at E3 last month, the
T ▼ company tapped Nintendo of
America President Reggie Fils-Aime to make
the announcement. It was probably a wise
choice, as the imposing front man might be
the only member of Nintendo's inner circle
who could keep a straight face as he read the

2004 when it embarked on a "blue ocean"
strategy and expanded its market share to
casual gamers with the DS and Wii. That

move gave the company two of the best-sell

business model from impressive innovations
to gimmicky iterations. We haven't seen sig-
