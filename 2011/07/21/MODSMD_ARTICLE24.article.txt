# Nintendo's focus on core fans continues to fade

■w" i -»-hen Nintendo unveiled the Wii U
\/\/ to the world at E3 last month, the
T ▼ company tapped Nintendo of
America President Reggie Fils-Aime to make
the announcement. It was probably a wise
choice, as the imposing front man might be
the only member of Nintendo's inner circle
who could keep a straight face as he read the
teleprompter in that moment of truth.
"It's a system that we will all enjoy
together, but also one that's tailor made for
you," Fils-Aime said.
It's far too early to call that media
friendly quip a bold-faced lie, as the Wii U
and its unique touch-screen controller won't
be available for at least another year. But

even with the benefit of the doubt, I'm

impressed that Nintendo and Fils-Aime so
confidently touted a fan base that, frankly,
they've shunned for a good chunk of the last
decade and completely neglected in the past
year.

I understand that Nintendo isn't just a

rainbow-powered fun factory: it's a
business. Its goal is to make a profit, and fos
tering fan loyalty is a means to that end. In
that jaded, 20-something paradigm, my
problems with Nintendo's Wii U announce
ment aren't personal. It's just bad business:
Nintendo isn't in touch with its core fan

base. Fils-Aime's promise was a simple one,
but it makes a false assumption that only
increases my belief that today's Nintendo is
operating in a fantasy world where its loyal
fans will love whatever it does because, well,
it's Nintendo.

Nintendo took a significant turn in
2004 when it embarked on a "blue ocean"
strategy and expanded its market share to
casual gamers with the DS and Wii. That

move gave the company two of the best-sell
ing consoles of all time, but it also shifted its
business model from impressive innovations
to gimmicky iterations. We haven't seen sig-

nificant new intellectual properly from Nintendo since
Pikmin in 2001.
Their gimmick-driven business model continues to qui
etly strain relationships with third-party partners. The 3DS
was released earlier this year with a cool feature set and a hefty
price tag, but the once-astonishing list of development part
nerships has grown embarrassingly short with cancellations
and delays. I can't claim to know exactly why developers are
gun shy to put games on the handheld, but it's likely a combi
nation of a small install base, unusual hardware and, most

damningly, a lack of publishing zeal from Nintendo itself.
Looking to Nintendo's future, things continue to have
that "business first, fans second" kind of flavor. The Wii is all

but dead, with nothing significant coming but a new Kirby
game and the long-delayed "Zelda: Skyward Sword," which
may be ported ahead to Wii U. For the 3DS, the 2011 release
calendar looks pretty dismal, and the most interesting titles are
nothing but more remakes. There's promise in the 3DS's
future with new Mario games and inevitable Zelda or Metroid
titles, but even then we're looking at nothing but first-party
games that are coming too late.

If Nintendo wants to make good on Fils-Aime's line and
show that it still cares about gamers' biggest needs (the games,
of course), it has a lot of promises to keep. It needs to be trans
parent and responsive to its fan base, create original content
that takes advantage of its hardware, seriously overhaul of its
online presence and, most importantly, attract game makers
from around the world with good hardware, fair publishing
agreements and simple development kits. It sounds like a tall
order, but it's the honest details of what Fils-Aime mentioned.
Nintendo fans will stick around for Zelda, Mario and
Metroid until the end of time, but the downtime between
those releases could be a whole lot prettier. It'd be nice to see
Nintendo take advantage of its market penetration and actual
ly attract new intellectual properties for people to fall in love
with, and I suppose making a promise is the first step in that
direction. Nintendo has surprised me more than I can count,
but here's hoping that this time it puts its money exactly
where its mouth is.
