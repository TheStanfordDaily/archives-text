## 'Alphas' shows potential

It's almost too easy to overlook Syfy's new series "Alphas."
After all, it wasn't that long ago that NBC's "Heroes" tried the
"realistic superheroes" conceit, and despite a strong start, it
eventually was crushed by its overcomplicated designs. Last year's
"No Ordinary Family" barely made it to the end of its first, and
now final, season. But even though the concept might not be
original, last week's "Alphas" premiere delivered a show that
managed a twist and backed it up with a great group dynamic.
Though comparisons to "Heroes" are inevitable, "Alphas" is,
on the surface at least, a much less ambitious show. A typical
episode from the NBC program would generally involve at least
two different countries and half a dozen characters. "Alphas" is

much smaller in scope: rather than fighting crimes, the titular

Alphas (led by the stereotypical friendly professor character) use
their powers to solve unusual crimes, like this episode's "locked-

room" mystery.
Ostensibly, the team has been together for some time before
the show starts, and despite a bit of awkward dialogue that's clear
ly for the audience's benefit, their interactions hold up. The char
acters have a good, albeit burgeoning chemistiy, and that's in part
due to how well defined their roles are. Not only are their powers
distinct ranging from enhanced senses to what's essentially a
Jedi mind trick but they all have a more mundane use on the
team as well. Bill Harken, for example, not only has short bursts
of super-strength, but his history in the FBI gives him training
and contacts that help get the team information. The group
dynamic as it stands is probably one of the strongest features of
the show.

There is a misfit, however: the autistic Gary Bell is really only
a source of comic relief when he's not using his power to visualize
wireless signals and watch You Tube videos in thin air. While his
character was one of my favorites in the pilot, it's unlikely he'll be
able to maintain a credible and interesting role unless he gets a bit
more fleshed out in later episodes.
