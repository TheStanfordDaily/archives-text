## Moving on: how to fill the 'Harry Potter' void 
### – halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
With the release of "Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows: Part 2," the "Harry Potter" series has offi
cially come to an end (with the exception of the
upcoming release of "Pottermore," a new, interactive online
world to accompany the books). So with no more midnight pre
mieres to look forward to, what's a die-hard "Potter" fan to do
about the gaping hole the series left in his or her life? Luckily,
Intermission's here with some suggestions to fill the void.

The Hunger Games
Heir-apparent to the
"Harry Potter" craze,
"The Hunger Games"
trilogy by Suzanne
Collins has already sold
millions, and hype
continues to build for
the first movie adapta
tion, due in March of
next year. The series
stars Katniss Everdeen,
a scrappy and indepen
dent teenager who faces
off against fellow chil-

dren from across Panem (the remains of the United States after
environmental disaster ruins the nation) in a brutal event called
the Hunger Games. The books are a lightening-fast read, and the
movie, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Woody

Harrelson, looks promising. "The Hunger Games" has the same
fiery action as "Harry Potter," though it is considerably bleaker.
If you run through the books too fast, check out Suzanne
Collins' other fantastic series, "The Underland Chronicles."

A Song of Ice and Fire
With a rich fantasy world and huge cast of characters, the "Song
of Ice and Fire" series by G. R. R. Martin has many of the ele-

ments that "Potter" fans crave. The book series, with five books
out so far and two to come, has something else in common with
Harry Potter —sheer length. The first book alone is over 800
pages, so it is sure to keep fans busy for a while. Or if you don't
feel like reading, HBO is adapting the series for TV. The first sea
son aired last spring, winning accolades (including 13 Emmy
nominations) and hordes of new fans. Also with some similari
ties to "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Once and Future
King," this series has all the drama of "Harry Potter" with more
family and political drama and not to mention more brutal
death scenes ("A Golden Crown," anyone?).
Monster
And now for something completely different: "Monster" is an
18-volume manga (comic book) series by Naoki Urasawa, a
renowned Japanese author. It stars Dr. Tenma, an idealistic brain
surgeon who sacrifices his career to save the life of a young boy,
Johann, rather than an important politician. His career in ruins,


COURTESY SCHOLASTIC
he discovers that the boy he saved is a psychotic killer, and the

doctor embarks on a bizarre quest to stop the monster he cre
ated. Set in Eastern Europe, "Monster" has the suspense of
"Harry Potter," an eclectic cast of characters and a
Voldemort-like villain, though its setting is realistic and the
tone much darker. If comic books aren't your style, check out
the animated adaptation, which faithfully follows the series in
74 episodes.

The Vampire Diaries
Yes, this is a television series on the CW. And yes, it shares the
network's penchant for soapy drama, improbably beautiful
characters and self-seriousness. However, this under-appreci
ated show also features a fast-moving plot full of addicting

twists and a world of vampires, werewolves and witches that

exists right under the nose of regular people, much like in
"Harry Potter." The series stars Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev),
an ordinary high school girl who falls for vampire Stefan
Salvatore (Paul Wesley) while recovering from her parents'
untimely deaths. She soon finds herself caught between Stefan
and his mischievous brother Damon (played with panache by
lan Somerhalder of "Lost" fame) as she discovers her identity
as a kind of vampire "chosen one" a la "Harry Potter" (It's
way better than "Twilight," we promise). Two seasons have
aired so far, and the third season premieres Sept. 15.
