## Project offers free quake-tracking devices 
### ELAINA KOROS INTERN 
A local collaborative initiative to
which Stanford is a contributor is asking
residents of homes and schools along the
Hayward Fault to install earthquake
sensing devices that will create the
"Quake-Catcher Network" (QCN) to
monitor seismic activity.

Inspired by SeisMac, a program that
effectively turns Macintosh computers
into seismographs, and BOINC, open
source software that allows individuals
to remotely donate their computers' un
used processing power to researchers,
QCN attaches sensors to personal com
puters to create a low-cost yet dense seis
mic network.

"With 6,000 sensors, it's amazing what
one can do," said geophysics assistant
professor and QCN project leader Jesse

Lawrence. "People are used to talking
about tens or hundreds even, but not
thousands."

QCN has already installed 2,000 sen
sors and plans to install at least 6,000
more worldwide in the next couple of
years, with the potential to grow to 60,000
or more. Lawrence and USGS researcher
Elizabeth Cochran lead the study.

Last weekend, QCN volunteers trav
eled to areas along the Hayward fault to
install the sensors in the floors of project
participants and connect them to their
computers with USB cables. Equipped
with a micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS) chip, each sensor can measure
acceleration in three directions, making
it possible to ascertain the direction of
the earth's movement.

new motion, it uploads small bits
of data to QCN's server to report a
potential new event. If the motion
proves isolated to one computer, it
will appear as a blip and will not
disrupt QCN's system. However, if
the server receives data from many
chips, it detects a regional event,
such as an earthquake.

"It's a little bit like the nervous
system," Lawrence said. "If one
nerve were to fire on your finger
tip, you wouldn't notice, but when
a bunch of them fire all at once,
you notice that maybe there's an
event there."
"The sensor doesn't interfere
at all with your computer, so you
don't see it actually working, but
you know it's there and that it's
sending data to this big network,"
said QCN administrator Claudia
Baroni, who organizes volunteers
and finances. "It's a huge amount
of people working toward the
same goal."

The low cost of each sensor
makes building a dense seismic
network possible. Although larg
er sensors can cost anywhere from
$25,000 to $50,000 dollars and
may cost an additional $lO,OOO a

year to maintain, QCN's highest
quality smaller sensors each cost
only $l5O. An individual small
sensor cannot measure ground
motion as accurately as a larger
sensor, but the sum of the small
sensors creates a network, which
can be better for monitoring
strong motion.
"We're not going to be observ
ing earthquakes across the planet,
but we'll be able to detect them re
ally rapidly and very well up close,
and this project is really aimed at
looking at how the earthquakes
look up close," Lawrence said.
QCN experimented with a sim
ilar program in New Zealand and
plans to expand beyond the Hay
ward fault, covering the entire
Bay Area and parts of Southern
California, the Pacific Northwest,
Anchorage, Salt Lake City and
Memphis. Expanding internation
ally to Mexico, Taiwan, Peru and
Chile is also a possibility, the re
searchers said.

QCN is funded by a National
Science Foundation grant and
small sums of money from agen
cies like the Southern California
Earthquake Center, the Incorpo
rated Research Institutions for
Seismology and the United Parcel
Service (UPS). This funding al
lows QCN to provide sensors to
participants in certain regions for
free. However, all individuals can

buy sensors on QCN's website for
$49, and teachers in all regions
can request up to three sensors at
a subsidized rate of five dollars.

"I love that it gets the commu
nity involved, because I am very
passionate about helping people,
and I think this is a great way to
educate people about earth
quakes, because we're installing
seismometers in their homes and
getting people involved in aware
ness," said third-year geophysics
graduate student Angela Chung.
QCN's applied scientific objec
tive is to determine whether or not
the network can detect an earth
quake's magnitude and location
rapidly enough to alert the affect
ed community before the waves
actually reach them, creating an
earthquake early-warning system.
Additionally, QCN sensors can de
tect earthquake magnitude, so
they could help emergency ser
vices find those who were hit the
hardest by an earthquake.
"[The goal of the project] from
my perspective is to learn more
about the Earth," Lawrence said.
"From the practical side, it's to
help us better understand earth
quake hazards and how to better
prepare and better respond to
earthquake hazards."
