## Project offers free quake-tracking devices

A local collaborative initiative to
which Stanford is a contributor is asking
residents of homes and schools along the
Hayward Fault to install earthquake
sensing devices that will create the
"Quake-Catcher Network" (QCN) to
monitor seismic activity.

Inspired by SeisMac, a program that
effectively turns Macintosh computers
into seismographs, and BOINC, open
source software that allows individuals
to remotely donate their computers' un
used processing power to researchers,
QCN attaches sensors to personal com
puters to create a low-cost yet dense seis
mic network.

"With 6,000 sensors, it's amazing what
one can do," said geophysics assistant
professor and QCN project leader Jesse

Lawrence. "People are used to talking
about tens or hundreds even, but not
thousands."

QCN has already installed 2,000 sen
sors and plans to install at least 6,000
more worldwide in the next couple of
years, with the potential to grow to 60,000
or more. Lawrence and USGS researcher
Elizabeth Cochran lead the study.

Last weekend, QCN volunteers trav
eled to areas along the Hayward fault to
install the sensors in the floors of project
participants and connect them to their
computers with USB cables. Equipped
with a micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMS) chip, each sensor can measure
acceleration in three directions, making
it possible to ascertain the direction of
the earth's movement.

The Quake-Catcher Network offers small devices that connect to computers around the
Hayward fault and together measure seismic activity, including earthquakes.
