## Dept. of Education creates website publicizing college costs 
### HENRY ZHU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to the U.S. Congress's 2008
Higher Education Opportunity Act
(HEOA) mandating that the cost of college
attendance be publicly available informa
tion, the U.S. Department of Education re
cently launched a website that publishes a
"college transparency and affordability" list
for information on tuition and net prices at
postsecondary institutions.

The HEOA attempts to enforce more
transparency about tuition and net prices
the total cost of attendance minus the aver
age amount of financial aid given at uni
versities across the nation, as well as the
amount that states spend on post-secondary
education and the amount of federal aid that
institutions receive.

According to the website, Stanford is
ranked 62nd on the list of the 65 private four
year colleges or universities with the
highest tuition in the country. The

list also includes several Ivy League schools.
As for Stanford's transparency about its
tuition and financial aid information, not
much has changed since the act passed.
"Stanford has already had a longstanding
practice of being completely transparent
about costs," said assistant vice president for
University communications Lisa Lapin. "We
always have complete disclosure of all of our
fees and tuition. The act is not going to
change the way we do business."

On Stanford's financial aid web
site, one can find a financial aid cal
culator which provides an estimate
of the aid that Stanford would offer
for an individual given their finan
cial situation as well as what the net
price of Stanford would be. Stan
ford also lists its tuition and fees
publicly online.
Stanford is one of only about 40
universities in the country that are
completely need-blind in the admis
sions process.

"Stanford University seeks to be
accessible and affordable to all of the
brightest and most promising stu
dents," Lapin said. "To that end,
Stanford offers significant financial
aid to make a Stanford education
possible, regardless of a student's
economic circumstances."

"We welcome the Department of
Education's assistance in helping in
form students and their families
about the true costs of college, and in
particular the costs of college after

average financial aid is considered,"
she added. "It will be important for
families to consider the average 'net
price' of any college and to inform
themselves of financial aid options."
Stanford's total first-year tuition
as listed by the Department of Edu
cation includes some one-time ori
entation fees as well as fees for stu
dent activities and health services
that may not be required by other
institutions. For the year reported,
Stanford's tuition was $37,380, the
mandatory freshman orientation
fee $438, the health service fee $5Ol
and the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) fee
was $357.
Stanford provides financial aid
that encompasses the full cost of tu
ition for families with annual house
hold incomes under $lOO,OOO and ad
justed aid for families with incomes
between $lOO,OOO and $200,000. The
"net price" of attendance, which
considers average financial aid pack
ages, is $19,697 in the Department of
Education report.
Although these numbers are
readily available, some are still
skeptical that the numbers will
allow prospective students and
their families to reach any defini

tive conclusions.
"At private universities, you
don't know what it really costs you
unless you are extremely
wealthy or you don't apply for finan
cial aid," said professor emeritus of
education Michael Kirst, "There are
really no tell-all figures or numbers
given to the consumer public. There
is a sticker price given, but not many
people pay it, so it's not that useful."
"Nearly everyone is expecting a
discount, in the form of a scholarship
or federal/state-given aid, from the
listed price, but we don't know what
that discount is ahead of time," he
continued. "And so, everyone gets
their own bargain price; it's like a ne
gotiation with a Russian drug mer
chant."

According to Kirst, Congress has
indeed been trying to address this
"notorious business" of private col
leges or universities discounting the
large majority of students who aren't
extremely wealthy. HEOA requires
publication of calculated estimates
of how much less than the full price
one can expect to pay depending on
his or her income bracket.
