## Student initiative changes alumni email services 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
As a result of a recent student-led
campaign to extend alumni access to
Stanford email addresses, the classes
of 2009, 2010 and 2011 will have ac
cess to their @stanford.edu accounts
until May 31, 2012. After this date,
email sent to those addresses will be
forwarded to an
@alumni.stanford.edu account for an
additional year.

Under the prior system, alumni
were given email addresses at an
@stanfordalumni.org domain. Their
@stanford.edu accounts were termi
nated 120 days after graduation, with
no subsequent email forwarding. The
change in policy is the result of collab
oration between members of the
ASSU Senate and Executive, Infor
mation Technology Services, the
Stanford Alumni Association, Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman, Provost John
Etchemendy and students.
"[The new system] will give them
almost two years to let their contacts
know about their new

alumni address," Boardman wrote in
an email to The Daily.

The effort was spearheaded in late
April by students including Varun
Sivaram 'll, who said he realized he
could lose professional contacts, em
ployment opportunities and corre
spondence with former classmates
and professors. He approached
ASSU Senator and new Appropria
tions Chair Brianna Pang 'l3, Presi
dent Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice Pres
ident Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3.
Sivaram, a former member of The
Daily's Editorial Board, expressed
some initial trepidation about the
proposal.

"Last year, the Provost said no to
the proposal of forwarding email ad
dresses," he said, referring to the re
versal of a fall 2009 administrative de
cision to grant students indefinite
email forwarding. "We weren't sure
why the change would be made, but
[Boardman] brought it to the
Provost."

Etchemendy offered his rationale
in an email to The Daily.
"We considered and rejected a
proposal last year for Stanford 'email
for life,' but the proposal made this
year seemed to me much more feasi
ble and reasonable," he said. "After I
was comfortable that it would not cre
ate any serious short- or long-term
problems for the University, I ap
proved the plan."

Sivaram thinks both alumni and
the University itself will benefit from
the change.
"It gives alumni credibility be
cause it's at an @stanford.edu do
main," he said. "And Stanford has
an easy path to email you if they
want donations. They also have a
great way to email you if they want
you to participate in reunions or
alumni events or be on a board or
committee. I hope that over the next
years, student representatives are
going to continue to fight for email

forwarding."
Macgregor-Dennis said that his
ASSU Executive team has no posi
tion on lifelong forwarding. "I know
that it's technically possible," he said.
"I can see why the University can be
hesitant... when it doesn't know
what it's going into. Right now, I
think that the administration has
taken a huge step forward."
Classes that graduated prior to
2009 will have the option to change
their email address when the new do
main becomes available. The entire
alumni email service will move to
Google in September. Future classes
will have two years of email forward
ing, but direct access to
@stanford.edu email will terminate
120 days after graduation.
