## Medical School adopts Multi-Mini Interview 
### ELLORA ISRANI NEWS EDITOR 
In a departure from the tradition
al admissions process for medical
schools in the United States, the
Stanford School of Medicine has just
completed its first year using the
Multiple Mini Interview (MMI)
process a method that splits the
traditional hour-long interview into
several smaller ones to assess its
candidates.

The MMI framework, used by 13
medical schools in Canada and
championed by McMaster Universi
ty in Hamilton, Ontario, aims to in
novatively rework the interview
process.
"While our first commitment is to
educate outstanding physicians, we
have the unique mission of seeking
individuals who also will be leaders
and who will seek to transform med
icine over the years and decades of
the future," School of Medicine
Dean Dr. Philip Pizzo wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We also want
students who will combine excel
lence in science and critical thinking
with compassion, sensitivity and hu

manism."
While, traditional, hour-long
medical school interviews occur with
a faculty member or current student
and include a discussion of both the
candidate's qualifications and his or
her questions about the institution,
MMIs offer eight- to 10-minute con
versations with several different in
terviewers.

"We felt, based upon the data
from Canada and from other places,
and based upon common sense, that
if we had more individuals regarding
our students, we'd have a richer pro
file of what the students were like, at
least from a personality standpoint
and their ability to think on their feet,
show empathy, reason and so forth,"
said associate dean for medical edu
cation Charles Prober.

MMI interviewers assign each
candidate a rating on a 10-point
scale, based solely on their discus
sion. In an additional departure from
traditional methods, the interviewers
know absolutely nothing about can
didates before meeting them.

"The raters do not know the can
didates at all, they have not seen their
files, they do not know which under

graduate school they went to, they
don't know anything other than their
name, and that's because the candi
date's wearing a name tag," Prober
said. "We don't want any bias what
soever to be introduced into the
process."
He added that this practice also
eliminates dependence on the inter
personal compatibility of a single in
terviewer and interviewee, which is
critical to the success or failure of a
single, longer interview.

Associate dean of medical school
admissions Gabriel Garcia cited the
MMl's predictive validity as critical
to its relevance.
"The issue is to use a tool that has
studies behind it that say, 'if you use
this interview, you will choose folks
who later on have better clinical skill
and make better decisions as physi
cians,"' he said.

In contrast to the traditional fac
ulty or student interviewers, the
MMI recruits from a broader pool.
Raters have included former pa
tients, nursing groups, faculty from
various departments, representa
tives from Human Resources and
Communications and community

members.
"We have a wide range of differ
ent kinds of people who will be rating
the students, each of whom will have
their own perceptions on what might
make a good doctor in terms of the
personality issue," Prober said.

The content of the conversation
differs as well. The MMI formula
places a hypothetical situation on the
door of each rater's room, which the
candidate reads before entering. The
eight minutes inside are spent entire
ly playing out that situation, which,
according to Prober, can provide an
"enriched personality profiling" of
the candidate.

Hillary Lin 'll, who will be at
tending the School of Medicine in the
fall, compared the MMI to speed dat
ing.

"You're asked to discuss a given
scenario with your interviewer,
which I thought was a comparatively
objective way to evaluate appli
cants," she wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Although the combined time
is similar to that of the combined
time of interviews at other schools,
it's a bit more draining since you're
constantly being confronted with a
new scenario and new interviewer."

As Lin pointed out, there are cer
tain personality types both favored
and hindered by the MMI.
"The 'thinking-out-loud' process
during the MMI can reveal what kind
of rationale an applicant has," she
said. "On the other hand, I felt like
the MMI selected for "smooth talk
ers," people I don't necessarily think

the school is looking for but might
admit because of their success in the
MMI."
The School of Medicine receives
about 7,000 applications a year and
accepts 86 of those candidates, ac
cording to Pizzo. About five percent
of applicants, or 350 individuals, re
ceive interviews.
Although feedback regarding the
MMI has been generally positive, the
evaluative process is ongoing.
"We need to assess its impact over
time and view it as a complementary
tool to the others we use to deter
mine who can be offered a spot at
Stanford," Pizzo said.
"You can't ask the MMI to do
everything," Garcia said. "What it
will do is select students who have
better communication skills, better
critical thinking skill and better ethi
cal grounds."

cording to Pizzo. About five percent
of applicants, or 350 individuals, re
ceive interviews.

MMI has been generally positive, the
evaluative process is ongoing.

In a departure from the tradition
al admissions process for medical
schools in the United States, the
Stanford School of Medicine has just
completed its first year using the
Multiple Mini Interview (MMI)
process a method that splits the
traditional hour-long interview into
several smaller ones to assess its
candidates.

The MMI framework, used by 13
medical schools in Canada and
championed by McMaster Universi
ty in Hamilton, Ontario, aims to in
novatively rework the interview
process.
"While our first commitment is to
educate outstanding physicians, we
have the unique mission of seeking
individuals who also will be leaders
and who will seek to transform med
icine over the years and decades of
the future," School of Medicine
Dean Dr. Philip Pizzo wrote in an
email to The Daily. "We also want
students who will combine excel
lence in science and critical thinking
with compassion, sensitivity and hu

manism."
While, traditional, hour-long
medical school interviews occur with
a faculty member or current student
and include a discussion of both the
candidate's qualifications and his or
her questions about the institution,
MMIs offer eight- to 10-minute con
versations with several different in
terviewers.

"We felt, based upon the data
from Canada and from other places,
and based upon common sense, that
if we had more individuals regarding
our students, we'd have a richer pro
file of what the students were like, at
least from a personality standpoint
and their ability to think on their feet,
show empathy, reason and so forth,"
said associate dean for medical edu
cation Charles Prober.

MMI interviewers assign each
candidate a rating on a 10-point
scale, based solely on their discus
sion. In an additional departure from
traditional methods, the interviewers
know absolutely nothing about can
didates before meeting them.

"The raters do not know the can
didates at all, they have not seen their
files, they do not know which under

graduate school they went to, they
don't know anything other than their
name, and that's because the candi
date's wearing a name tag," Prober
said. "We don't want any bias what
soever to be introduced into the
process."
He added that this practice also
eliminates dependence on the inter
personal compatibility of a single in
terviewer and interviewee, which is
critical to the success or failure of a
single, longer interview.

Associate dean of medical school
admissions Gabriel Garcia cited the
MMl's predictive validity as critical
to its relevance.
"The issue is to use a tool that has
studies behind it that say, 'if you use
this interview, you will choose folks
who later on have better clinical skill
and make better decisions as physi
cians,"' he said.

In contrast to the traditional fac
ulty or student interviewers, the
MMI recruits from a broader pool.
Raters have included former pa
tients, nursing groups, faculty from
various departments, representa
tives from Human Resources and
Communications and community

members.
"We have a wide range of differ
ent kinds of people who will be rating
the students, each of whom will have
their own perceptions on what might
make a good doctor in terms of the
personality issue," Prober said.

The content of the conversation
differs as well. The MMI formula
places a hypothetical situation on the
door of each rater's room, which the
candidate reads before entering. The
eight minutes inside are spent entire
ly playing out that situation, which,
according to Prober, can provide an
"enriched personality profiling" of
the candidate.

Hillary Lin 'll, who will be at
tending the School of Medicine in the
fall, compared the MMI to speed dat
ing.

"You're asked to discuss a given
scenario with your interviewer,
which I thought was a comparatively
objective way to evaluate appli
cants," she wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Although the combined time
is similar to that of the combined
time of interviews at other schools,
it's a bit more draining since you're
constantly being confronted with a
new scenario and new interviewer."

As Lin pointed out, there are cer
tain personality types both favored
and hindered by the MMI.
"The 'thinking-out-loud' process
during the MMI can reveal what kind
of rationale an applicant has," she
said. "On the other hand, I felt like
the MMI selected for "smooth talk
ers," people I don't necessarily think

the school is looking for but might
admit because of their success in the
MMI."
The School of Medicine receives
about 7,000 applications a year and
accepts 86 of those candidates, ac
cording to Pizzo. About five percent
of applicants, or 350 individuals, re
ceive interviews.
Although feedback regarding the
MMI has been generally positive, the
evaluative process is ongoing.
"We need to assess its impact over
time and view it as a complementary
tool to the others we use to deter
mine who can be offered a spot at
Stanford," Pizzo said.
"You can't ask the MMI to do
everything," Garcia said. "What it
will do is select students who have
better communication skills, better
critical thinking skill and better ethi
cal grounds."
