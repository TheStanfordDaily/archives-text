## Palo Alto declines to mediate with firefighters 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Harini Jaganathan 
The Palo Alto City Council has declined to mediate contract nego
tiations with the Palo Alto Fire Fighters, pushing the parties into bind
ing arbitration as required by the city's charter. The firefighters have
proposed a contract that would result in $3.1 million in givebacks to
the city. This contract would theoretically have closed three-quarters
of the $4.3-million gap in the budget passed by the City Council last
month.

"The firefighters have shown good faith in this process by present
ing a proposal," said Palo Alto Fire Fighters Union president Tony
Spitaleri in a press release, "The City Council, however, doesn't seem
to be showing good faith in their end of the negotiations."
The firefighters had proposed voluntary mediation to achieve res
olution after the City Council's rejection of this contract.
