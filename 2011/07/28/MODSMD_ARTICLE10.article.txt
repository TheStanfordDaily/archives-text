## 
### â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Congressman David Wu '77 an
nounced his resignation from the
House of Representatives today
after allegations that he had an "un
wanted sexual encounter" with a
minor. Despite calls from many of
his peers to step down immediately,
the seven-term Democratic con-

gressman from Oregon said that he
will not leave office until the debt
ceiling debate is resolved.
The teenaged girl, whose family
has been described as close to Wu,

Wu maintains that the encounter was
consensual. House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi has called on the Ethics
Committee to begin an investigation.
