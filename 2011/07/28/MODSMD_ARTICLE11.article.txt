Fragmented sleep is linked to
memory impairment in mice, ac
cording to a new study by Stanford
sleep researchers. The paper, pub
lished in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, is
the first to isolate the effects of in
terrupted sleep on memory and
was inspired in part by another
study linking shorter sleep to hy
peractive children.

The researchers behind the
study stimulated "mini-awaken
ings" in mice by injecting a virus
containing a red fluorescent pro
tein, targeting brain cells in the hy
pothalamus that are involved in
waking. They then used a laser that
the proteins were responsive to in
order to stimulate that area of the
brain and briefly awaken the
mouse's brain. The procedure did
not disrupt the amount of restora
tive sleep the mice experienced.
