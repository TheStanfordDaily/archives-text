# Fragmented sleep linked to forgetful mice

Fragmented sleep is linked to
memory impairment in mice, ac
cording to a new study by Stanford
sleep researchers. The paper, pub
lished in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, is
the first to isolate the effects of in
terrupted sleep on memory and
was inspired in part by another
study linking shorter sleep to hy
peractive children.

The researchers behind the
study stimulated "mini-awaken
ings" in mice by injecting a virus
containing a red fluorescent pro
tein, targeting brain cells in the hy
pothalamus that are involved in
waking. They then used a laser that
the proteins were responsive to in
order to stimulate that area of the
brain and briefly awaken the
mouse's brain. The procedure did
not disrupt the amount of restora
tive sleep the mice experienced.
Before the mice slept, the re
searchers introduced them to two
new areas of a cage; after the night of
mini-awakenings, the mice were
reintroduced to one of those areas
and a newer area. If the mice re
membered the familiar area, they
would spend more time exploring
the new area. All the sleepy mice,
however, explored the two areas as
if both were new, suggesting that
they had forgotten the familiar
space.

While interrupted sleep has

long been linked to poor memory,
researchers were previously un
clear as to what other problems as
sociated with interrupted sleep
poor overall sleep quality, interfer
ence with some specific part of the
sleep cycle or annoyance from con
stantly being woken up might
be the actual issue.

A wide range of human disor
ders can similarly interrupt sleep,
including Alzheimer's disease, alco
holism and sleep apnea, and have
long been associated with memory
problems. That poor memory then
negatively affects learning ability,
as new skills and information are
not as strongly retained.
