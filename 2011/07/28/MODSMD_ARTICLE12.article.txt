## SEEING GREEN O-H-oh-no: Catching my breath in America's most toxic air? 
### Holly Moeller 
After a full day in and out of airplanes
and airports, there's really nothing
like stepping out of the terminal and
taking your first breath of unfiltered, uncon
ditioned, unpressurized air. Sure, the curb
side may be polluted with exhaust fumes and
filled with the noise of honking taxi drivers,
but it's still undeniably fresh.
Too bad that, last Sunday, I took that
breath in the state with the worst air pollu
tion record in the country.
In reality, my first taste of Columbus,
Ohio was probably not detectably different
from in any other state. But the back of my
mind was filled with a recently released joint
report from the Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC) and Physicians for Social
Responsibility (PSR): the Buckeye State
topped their list of toxin emitters, releasing
almost 70 million pounds in 2009 (the latest
data that the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) has released). By contrast,
runner-up Pennsylvania produced nearly 30
percent less. And so I found myself produc
ing one small, involuntary cough.
The NRDC/PSR report emphasized the
role of coal- and oil-fired electricity plants in
the release of aerial toxins. In the United
States, 49 percent of toxic air pollution in
cluding hydrochloric acid emissions, a hearty
sprinkle of heavy metals and three quarters
of mercury emissions comes from elec
tricity generation. In Ohio, that percentage is
65. Besides mercury's well-known mental
health dangers, air pollution contributes to
cancer, may produce birth defects and exac
erbates a wide array of respiratory ailments.
That's why the EPA believes that its pro
posed "Mercury and Air Toxics" limits will
save 17,000 lives within three years of imple
mentation in January 2012. In that same pe
riod, it predicts 120,000 cases of childhood
asthma will be avoided, and insurance com
panies won't have to fork out payments for
12,000 emergency room visits and 850,000
missed workdays each year.
That is, if the EPA's proposal is carried
out.

Last February, courtesy of a Republican
led House of Representatives vote, the EPA
received a blow to its regulation of cement
plant pollution. (The manufacture of cement
releases mercury, particulates and sulfur
dioxide.) More objections and stalling tactics
are sure to interfere with these new regula
tions, which have been more than 20 years in

the making.
The EPA would also like to tighten re
strictions on nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions in 28 states and the District of Co
lumbia, where power plants' emissions are
spilling across state borders into their neigh
bors' backyards. As Texas Governor Rick
Perry rails against the proposed limits (an
nounced in early July), members of Congress
are drawing up bills to delay their implemen
tation.

Now, as it attempts to establish the first
nationwide regulations for mercury, chromi
um and acid emissions from power plants,
the EPA faces additional anti-regulation,
pro-industry rhetoric and more rounds of
fear mongering about rising energy costs.
The problem is no one spares a breath for
healthcare savings (or quality of life) when
ranting about the horrors extra expenditures
will bring to American families in this time of
economic crisis.

The nice thing about air pollution,
though, is that we can cite lots of studies link
ing it to health issues. We can write out bal
ance sheets, crunch numbers and show the
savings produced. For example, the EPA ex
pects its new regulations to create 40,000 jobs
(admittedly, the majority of them will be
temporary, as plants upgrade their hard
ware) and produce $l4O billion annually in
health and economic benefits. For every dol
lar spent to keep a plant within the new lim
its, the EPA calculates a return of $l3 to the
American people.
So why haven't we jumped at the chance
to clean up our act?
Well, let's not forget that, to a large ex
tent, we already have. Things have improved
dramatically since the Clean Air Act was
passed in 1963. Initial payoffs were phenom
enal: people noticed jumps in lake pH and
fish stocks as rainwater acidity decreased;
businessmen could walk through a city with
out doubling up in a coughing fit; you could
see the sun again where there were once
clouds of smog.
Now comes the hard part: buckling down
to address the less tangible, less visible effects
by lowering emissions limits still further. Will
our belief in scientific and medical evidence
motivate us to finish the job, accepting noth
ing less than clean air for ourselves and our
children?

I should note that California, at least,
made neither the EPA's list of 29 upwind bad

guys nor the NRDC/PSR's tally of
20 top air toxifiers. Our electricity
production emits only four percent
of the 7.45 million pounds of air
pollution the state creates annually.
Even the latter number is small,

compared to the whopping 772 mil
lion pounds emitted nationally (382
million of that total comes from
electricity generation; the remain
ing 51 percent comes from chemi
cal manufacture (15 percent),
paper products (13 percent) and a
hodgepodge of other industries
compelled to report emissions to
the EPA.

Of course, that doesn't mean my
lungs will be happy to return home

in two weeks. I may not be traips
ing around in a city anymore, but
the plants around Stanford's cam
pus find new pollens to tickle my
bronchioles every month. Still, I
guess there's something refreshing
about having a "natural" asthma
attack.
