# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## Confessions of a Third-Culture Kid 
### Aysha Kureishi 
There is a remarkable phenomenon in the
new generation of children: in the past
decade, with improved technological de
velopments, greater opportunities for travel
and rapidly progressing globalization, moving
from country to country has gone from unusual
to usual. For children of parents whose job
moves the whole family, growing up in multiple
countries and being exposed to multiple cul
tures has offered them a different outlook on
life and opportunities that were considered
scarce in previous generations. These children
have now been recognized as different from
others in their generation and been given a spe
cial name "Third-Culture Kids."

The most difficult question for a TCK
(Third-Culture Kid) to answer is, "Where are
you from?" Should you dare to innocently ask
this of a TCK, be prepared for a long-winded,
complex answer involving multiple countries,
histories and then a simple conclusion: "but I ac
tually consider myself 'Earthian.'" TCKs will
often have multiple passports, be fluent in mul
tiple languages and have lived and studied on
multiple continents. TCKs can navigate airports
and train stations with their eyes closed and in
stinctively guess correctly where someone is
from based on their accent and their manner of
expression.

I am a TCK. Although a Canadian passport
permits me to travel around the globe, I cannot
with sincerity call Canada my homeland. Cana
da is my birthplace, but my homeland is across
the Pacific Ocean. You cannot change your
birthplace; it is one of the most fundamental ele
ments of your identity. It is where you were
brought into the world, where you first started to
breathe and where you made your first mark
upon the world with your first tiny laugh. But
your birthplace is not your homeland. The choic
es you make in life and the different paths you
walk lead you to form your own identity. And
part of forming that identity is determining to
which place in the world your soul is bonded and
which voice calls you home. This is one of the
many challenges that TCKs have to undertake.
As part of an ethic minority in Singapore
(Caucasian) and surrounded by a sea of jet
black hair and almond-shaped dark eyes, I can
not pass as a local. My facial features, my hair
color and my skin tone define me as an outsider.
But in my mind, my appearance has morphed to
blend in with society and make me another Sin
gaporean face in the crowd. So much so that
when I now go back to my birthplace, I turn up
my collar and shy away from passing strangers,
falsely conscious that I must stick out because I
look so foreign. When I return to Asia, I am in
stinctively relieved to be surrounded by "others
like me." In reality, this is a false notion. It's a

trick of mirrors and sunlight.
I am a stranger in my own skin. This is not an
unusual experience for TCKs. When they trav
el around the world, it is inevitable that they will
come into contact with different cultures and
ethnically different people. The physical differ
ences between a TCK and the rest of the society
can create a barrier between the two. For a child
growing up in a foreign place, the only way to
overcome that barrier and to assimilate into the
surrounding society is to believe and pretend
your appearance is not so different. And that's
what our wonderful subconscious mind does.
Humans are social creatures. We have the in
stinctive need to befriend others, form commu
nities and become a part of a society in which we
can go about our daily affairs and comfort our
selves with the notion that someone like us is
never more than a few minutes away. Studies
have shown that we are attracted to people that
look like we do and question why this is the case.
But the real question should be deeper than the
one expounded by scientists: how do I see phys
ically myself and how accurate is that picture?
Other foreigners in Singapore I have spoken
to admit that they too subconsciously believe
they have taken on an Asian appearance. A
blonde friend of mine once told me she was in a
shopping mall and walked by a mirror. She
turned, wondering who the non-local was and
was surprised to find her reflection staring in
quisitively back at her. School friends from Rus
sia and England have told me they feel self-con
scious returning to their countries, where they
are no longer the ethnic minority. On the other
hand, an Asian friend explained to me that fre
quent trips to the U.K. made him believe he had
taken on a European appearance.
The way we believe we look is definitely not
always the truth. In an amazing psychological
reversal, we subconsciously alter our self-image
to fit in with our surrounding community. Our
surroundings and our desire to fit in trick us into
believing we are something other than what we
are. We form beliefs about ourselves that have
been created on false assumptions and often act
on those beliefs. The best part? We often don't
even realize it.

This can be a very good thing for TCKs be
cause it means they have adapted so perfectly to

their new homes that their minds
believe they are locals. Adapting in
such a complete way that even your
subconscious believes you are phys
ically different from what you actu
ally are is a skill that takes time to
develop. TCKs often experience
"reverse culture shock" upon
returning to their passport country.
But at the same time, adapting
in such away means that you lose
part of your fundamental identity.
This leads you to question exactly

what your fundamental identity is
and what it means. What does it
mean to say that you are Canadian
and not American? German and
not Swiss? Argentinean and not
Chilean? How can you feel patriot
ic toward one and not another?
What do these invisible borders
between cultures and people
mean?

Exactly what you thought: noth
ing at all. You and I were both born
in the same birthplace and share the
same homeland Earth.

blend in with society and make me another Sin
gaporean face in the crowd. So much so that
when I now go back to my birthplace, I turn up
my collar and shy away from passing strangers,
falsely conscious that I must stick out because I
look so foreign. When I return to Asia, I am in
stinctively relieved to be surrounded by "others
like me." In reality, this is a false notion. It's a

trick of mirrors and sunlight.
I am a stranger in my own skin. This is not an
unusual experience for TCKs. When they trav
el around the world, it is inevitable that they will
come into contact with different cultures and
ethnically different people. The physical differ
ences between a TCK and the rest of the society
can create a barrier between the two. For a child
growing up in a foreign place, the only way to
overcome that barrier and to assimilate into the
surrounding society is to believe and pretend
your appearance is not so different. And that's
what our wonderful subconscious mind does.
Humans are social creatures. We have the in
stinctive need to befriend others, form commu
nities and become a part of a society in which we
can go about our daily affairs and comfort our
selves with the notion that someone like us is
never more than a few minutes away. Studies
have shown that we are attracted to people that
look like we do and question why this is the case.
But the real question should be deeper than the
one expounded by scientists: how do I see phys
ically myself and how accurate is that picture?
Other foreigners in Singapore I have spoken
to admit that they too subconsciously believe
they have taken on an Asian appearance. A
blonde friend of mine once told me she was in a
shopping mall and walked by a mirror. She
turned, wondering who the non-local was and
was surprised to find her reflection staring in
quisitively back at her. School friends from Rus
sia and England have told me they feel self-con
scious returning to their countries, where they
are no longer the ethnic minority. On the other
hand, an Asian friend explained to me that fre
quent trips to the U.K. made him believe he had
taken on a European appearance.
The way we believe we look is definitely not
always the truth. In an amazing psychological
reversal, we subconsciously alter our self-image
to fit in with our surrounding community. Our
surroundings and our desire to fit in trick us into
believing we are something other than what we
are. We form beliefs about ourselves that have
been created on false assumptions and often act
on those beliefs. The best part? We often don't
even realize it.

This can be a very good thing for TCKs be
cause it means they have adapted so perfectly to

their new homes that their minds
believe they are locals. Adapting in
such a complete way that even your
subconscious believes you are phys
ically different from what you actu
ally are is a skill that takes time to
develop. TCKs often experience
"reverse culture shock" upon
returning to their passport country.
But at the same time, adapting
in such away means that you lose
part of your fundamental identity.
This leads you to question exactly

what your fundamental identity is
and what it means. What does it
mean to say that you are Canadian
and not American? German and
not Swiss? Argentinean and not
Chilean? How can you feel patriot
ic toward one and not another?
What do these invisible borders
between cultures and people
mean?

Exactly what you thought: noth
ing at all. You and I were both born
in the same birthplace and share the
same homeland Earth.

There is a remarkable phenomenon in the
new generation of children: in the past
decade, with improved technological de
velopments, greater opportunities for travel
and rapidly progressing globalization, moving
from country to country has gone from unusual
to usual. For children of parents whose job
moves the whole family, growing up in multiple
countries and being exposed to multiple cul
tures has offered them a different outlook on
life and opportunities that were considered
scarce in previous generations. These children
have now been recognized as different from
others in their generation and been given a spe
cial name "Third-Culture Kids."

The most difficult question for a TCK
(Third-Culture Kid) to answer is, "Where are
you from?" Should you dare to innocently ask
this of a TCK, be prepared for a long-winded,
complex answer involving multiple countries,
histories and then a simple conclusion: "but I ac
tually consider myself 'Earthian.'" TCKs will
often have multiple passports, be fluent in mul
tiple languages and have lived and studied on
multiple continents. TCKs can navigate airports
and train stations with their eyes closed and in
stinctively guess correctly where someone is
from based on their accent and their manner of
expression.

I am a TCK. Although a Canadian passport
permits me to travel around the globe, I cannot
with sincerity call Canada my homeland. Cana
da is my birthplace, but my homeland is across
the Pacific Ocean. You cannot change your
birthplace; it is one of the most fundamental ele
ments of your identity. It is where you were
brought into the world, where you first started to
breathe and where you made your first mark
upon the world with your first tiny laugh. But
your birthplace is not your homeland. The choic
es you make in life and the different paths you
walk lead you to form your own identity. And
part of forming that identity is determining to
which place in the world your soul is bonded and
which voice calls you home. This is one of the
many challenges that TCKs have to undertake.
As part of an ethic minority in Singapore
(Caucasian) and surrounded by a sea of jet
black hair and almond-shaped dark eyes, I can
not pass as a local. My facial features, my hair
color and my skin tone define me as an outsider.
But in my mind, my appearance has morphed to
blend in with society and make me another Sin
gaporean face in the crowd. So much so that
when I now go back to my birthplace, I turn up
