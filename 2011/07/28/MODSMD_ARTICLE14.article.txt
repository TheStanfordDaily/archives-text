## CARDINAL FALL EARLY AT BOTW 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The Bank of the West (BotW) Classic,
hosted at Stanford's Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, puts some of Stanford's finest on
display against the world's top professional
female tennis players.
One of the greatest advantages of BotW is
its relaxed environment and close proximity
to the stars. The tournament frequently at
tracts some fantastic talent, this year bringing
in Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova,
Kimiko Date-Krumm and defending cham
pion Victoria Azarenka.
The tournament's presence itself signifies
the importance Stanford University places
on its women's athletics programs, particu
larly tennis. The Cardinal has the most suc
cessful women's tennis program in the
NCAA. By inviting the 32-player BotW to
campus, the University is supporting
women's initiatives in sports the world and
highlighting its success.
BotW also helps increase Stanford's ath
letic presence in the Bay Area community,
something the school struggles with occa
sionally. Many sportswriters touched on the
school's failure during the 2010 football sea
son to reach out to local residents and cater
the fan environment to them. The BotW an
nually invites the community to engage in
Stanford Athletics and see the school's top
players compete and engage with world-class
athletes in the community's backyard.
Tournament organizers do a great job of
making these players accessible while they
are playing, practicing or signing autographs.
It's easy for players to interact with their fans
and show their appreciation. As tennis be
comes more popular, the gap between player
and fan increases. At Stanford, this gap is
largely eliminated, and having a close inter
action with your favorite star is likely.

Seeing Cardinal
Five Cardinal players participated in the
tournament, including recent graduate Hi
lary Barte and incoming freshman Ellen
Tsay.

Barte recently finished up her career at
Stanford as a four-time All-American in both
singles and doubles and a two-time NCAA
doubles champion. She graduated as one of
the finest college players in the nation and a

hometown favorite at the Bank of the West
Classic. She was greeted as such in her first
round match, earning applause from those
who had watched her during her Stanford
days.

"It feels different," Barte said when asked
to describe the feeling of coming back to
Stanford as a professional. "The atmosphere
is way different. Even though it's Stanford
and I've played there for four years, it still
feels a little bit foreign."
Barte says that the transition from playing

as an amateur was surprisingly easy.
"Turning pro, it was a little anticli
mactic," she said. "I just wrote a little
'p' next to my name, and that was it. It
was more of an attitude to take tennis
very seriously and be more disci
plined with everything I did, off the
court especially."
After playing her first WTA tour
nament as a professional last week in
Lexington, Ky., losing in the first
round to Ahsha Rolle (6-4, 2-6, 6-4),
Barte earned a wild card into the
main draw, Stanford's only main
draw competitor. She faced Chang
Kai-Chen of Chinese Taipei in the
first round. Chang used her powerful
serve to full effect throughout the
night. After shaking off early nerves,
Chang came back from 2-5 down in
the first set to beat Barte 7-5,6-4.
"I was having a really tough time
reading her toss," Barte said. "She
changed it up, and I think even the
speed of the courts, she did a great job
playing that up. I physically didn't
feel that tight, but I think mentally I
started thinking about the future a bit
too much."

Many people argue about

whether it is good for a player to at
tend a college tennis program or not.
In some circles, it is an experience
that increases mental fortitude and
emotional stability once a player does
go pro. For others, it is time wasted in
class that should be spent competing
against the best. Barte is a member of
the former camp.
"I was actually deciding between
trying to play professional right out of
high school and coming here [to Stan
ford]," she said. "I think coming here
was the best decision of my life. Per
haps it wasn't the best thing for my
tennis development, but it did unbe
lievable things for my life, my mental
ity."

Tsay, in a brave display of future
performances on Stanford's center
court, fought through three tough
sets before succumbing 4-6,6-3,7-5 to
Seng-Nan Sun of China.
Rising sophomore Nicole Gibbs,
in her first qualifying match at the
BotW, earned a measure of revenge
for Barte, defeating Rolle in a domi
nating 6-3, 6-1 performance. Rolle
was unable to muster much of any
thing as Gibbs' return game put her
into the next round against qualify
ing's fifth seed Ajla Tomljanovic.
Tomljanovic came in with a powerful
groundstroke game that was over
powering for the smaller Gibbs. Ever
the fighter, Gibbs capitalized on her

opponent's mistakes to take the sec
ond set but lost 6-4,1 -6,6-1 in the end.
Rising junior Stacey Tan upset
qualifying's sixth seed Heidi El
Tabakh of Canada in her first match
back at Stanford. A close first set was
followed by a blowout final set by
Tan for a 7-5, 6-1 victory. Her great
play didn't last long before she lost 6-
0, 6-0 in the next round to another
Canadian, Marie-Eve Pelletier. With
her loss, the last of the Stanford girls
was out of the tournament.

Rising sophomore Kristie Ahn
was back for her first match since her
season-ending ankle injury in the fi
nals of the NCAA tournament. The
injury prevented her, one of Stan
ford's best players, from competing
against the Gators and may have
been a deciding factor in their narrow
victory. Her return to competition
was hopeful.
"It felt great," Ahn said about re
turning. "Not physically great, but
emotionally, just to be able to step
out on the court and be able to play a
match or as much of a match as I
could, it was great. It was a decently
close match, well at least in the first
set it was. It was my first match com
peting again, and it was at Stanford,
so obviously you can't get too much
better than that."

Ahn fought tough the entire first
set against the 30-year-old veteran

Abigail Spears of the United States.
The injury began to sting, and in the
second game of the second set, Ahn
pulled up, clearly in pain. She went to
her seat and called her coach.

"I guess you could call it a small
tweak," she explained. "At that
point, it was just bombarding my
head with worries and concerns. I
couldn't put much pressure on it, and
stepping into the ball, I kind of just
froze."

Ahn clearly was unwell but fin
ished the match, ultimately unable to
muster much in the last four games
and losing 7-5,6-0. She says her ankle
is still healing and simply needs more

time.
"For the most part it's fine and just
needs more time to recover," Ahn
said. "Most of it's in the head, just be
cause you start thinking and then you
start freaking out, essentially. Then
you can't focus on the match, then
you don't want to focus on the match
because you're so focused on your
ankle."

BotW will conclude this weekend,
with both singles and doubles semifi
nals being played on Saturday and
both finals on Sunday.

Abigail Spears of the United States.
The injury began to sting, and in the
second game of the second set, Ahn
pulled up, clearly in pain. She went to
her seat and called her coach.

"I guess you could call it a small
tweak," she explained. "At that
point, it was just bombarding my
head with worries and concerns. I
couldn't put much pressure on it, and
stepping into the ball, I kind of just
froze."

Ahn clearly was unwell but fin
ished the match, ultimately unable to
muster much in the last four games
and losing 7-5,6-0. She says her ankle
is still healing and simply needs more

time.
"For the most part it's fine and just
needs more time to recover," Ahn
said. "Most of it's in the head, just be
cause you start thinking and then you
start freaking out, essentially. Then
you can't focus on the match, then
you don't want to focus on the match
because you're so focused on your
ankle."

BotW will conclude this weekend,
with both singles and doubles semifi
nals being played on Saturday and
both finals on Sunday.

Rising sophomore Nicole Gibbs got past the first qualifying round with a 6-3,
6-1 win, but fell in three sets against fifth seed Ajla Tomljanovic in her next
match. Gibbs was one of five Stanford players eliminated at the tournament.
The Bank of the West (BotW) Classic,
hosted at Stanford's Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, puts some of Stanford's finest on
display against the world's top professional
female tennis players.
One of the greatest advantages of BotW is
its relaxed environment and close proximity
to the stars. The tournament frequently at
tracts some fantastic talent, this year bringing
in Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova,
Kimiko Date-Krumm and defending cham
pion Victoria Azarenka.
The tournament's presence itself signifies
the importance Stanford University places
on its women's athletics programs, particu
larly tennis. The Cardinal has the most suc
cessful women's tennis program in the
NCAA. By inviting the 32-player BotW to
campus, the University is supporting
women's initiatives in sports the world and
highlighting its success.
BotW also helps increase Stanford's ath
letic presence in the Bay Area community,
something the school struggles with occa
sionally. Many sportswriters touched on the
school's failure during the 2010 football sea
son to reach out to local residents and cater
the fan environment to them. The BotW an
nually invites the community to engage in
Stanford Athletics and see the school's top
players compete and engage with world-class
athletes in the community's backyard.
Tournament organizers do a great job of
making these players accessible while they
are playing, practicing or signing autographs.
It's easy for players to interact with their fans
and show their appreciation. As tennis be
comes more popular, the gap between player
and fan increases. At Stanford, this gap is
largely eliminated, and having a close inter
action with your favorite star is likely.

Seeing Cardinal
Five Cardinal players participated in the
tournament, including recent graduate Hi
lary Barte and incoming freshman Ellen
Tsay.

Barte recently finished up her career at
Stanford as a four-time All-American in both
singles and doubles and a two-time NCAA
doubles champion. She graduated as one of
the finest college players in the nation and a

hometown favorite at the Bank of the West
Classic. She was greeted as such in her first
round match, earning applause from those
who had watched her during her Stanford
days.

"It feels different," Barte said when asked
to describe the feeling of coming back to
Stanford as a professional. "The atmosphere
is way different. Even though it's Stanford
and I've played there for four years, it still
feels a little bit foreign."
Barte says that the transition from playing

Abigail Spears. Ahn is battling back from an ankle injury she sustained in the NCAA Finals.
as an amateur was surprisingly easy.
"Turning pro, it was a little anticli
mactic," she said. "I just wrote a little
'p' next to my name, and that was it. It
was more of an attitude to take tennis
very seriously and be more disci
plined with everything I did, off the
court especially."
After playing her first WTA tour
nament as a professional last week in
Lexington, Ky., losing in the first
round to Ahsha Rolle (6-4, 2-6, 6-4),
Barte earned a wild card into the
main draw, Stanford's only main
draw competitor. She faced Chang
Kai-Chen of Chinese Taipei in the
first round. Chang used her powerful
serve to full effect throughout the
night. After shaking off early nerves,
Chang came back from 2-5 down in
the first set to beat Barte 7-5,6-4.
"I was having a really tough time
reading her toss," Barte said. "She
changed it up, and I think even the
speed of the courts, she did a great job
playing that up. I physically didn't
feel that tight, but I think mentally I
started thinking about the future a bit
too much."

Many people argue about

whether it is good for a player to at
tend a college tennis program or not.
In some circles, it is an experience
that increases mental fortitude and
emotional stability once a player does
go pro. For others, it is time wasted in
class that should be spent competing
against the best. Barte is a member of
the former camp.
"I was actually deciding between
trying to play professional right out of
high school and coming here [to Stan
ford]," she said. "I think coming here
was the best decision of my life. Per
haps it wasn't the best thing for my
tennis development, but it did unbe
lievable things for my life, my mental
ity."

Tsay, in a brave display of future
performances on Stanford's center
court, fought through three tough
sets before succumbing 4-6,6-3,7-5 to
Seng-Nan Sun of China.
Rising sophomore Nicole Gibbs,
in her first qualifying match at the
BotW, earned a measure of revenge
for Barte, defeating Rolle in a domi
nating 6-3, 6-1 performance. Rolle
was unable to muster much of any
thing as Gibbs' return game put her
into the next round against qualify
ing's fifth seed Ajla Tomljanovic.
Tomljanovic came in with a powerful
groundstroke game that was over
powering for the smaller Gibbs. Ever
the fighter, Gibbs capitalized on her

opponent's mistakes to take the sec
ond set but lost 6-4,1 -6,6-1 in the end.
Rising junior Stacey Tan upset
qualifying's sixth seed Heidi El
Tabakh of Canada in her first match
back at Stanford. A close first set was
followed by a blowout final set by
Tan for a 7-5, 6-1 victory. Her great
play didn't last long before she lost 6-
0, 6-0 in the next round to another
Canadian, Marie-Eve Pelletier. With
her loss, the last of the Stanford girls
was out of the tournament.

Rising sophomore Kristie Ahn
was back for her first match since her
season-ending ankle injury in the fi
nals of the NCAA tournament. The
injury prevented her, one of Stan
ford's best players, from competing
against the Gators and may have
been a deciding factor in their narrow
victory. Her return to competition
was hopeful.
"It felt great," Ahn said about re
turning. "Not physically great, but
emotionally, just to be able to step
out on the court and be able to play a
match or as much of a match as I
could, it was great. It was a decently
close match, well at least in the first
set it was. It was my first match com
peting again, and it was at Stanford,
so obviously you can't get too much
better than that."

Ahn fought tough the entire first
set against the 30-year-old veteran

Abigail Spears of the United States.
The injury began to sting, and in the
second game of the second set, Ahn
pulled up, clearly in pain. She went to
her seat and called her coach.
