## CARDINAL FALL EARLY AT BOTW 
### WILL SEATON STAFF WRITER 
The Bank of the West (BotW) Classic,
hosted at Stanford's Taube Family Tennis
Stadium, puts some of Stanford's finest on
display against the world's top professional
female tennis players.
One of the greatest advantages of BotW is
its relaxed environment and close proximity
to the stars. The tournament frequently at
tracts some fantastic talent, this year bringing
in Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova,
Kimiko Date-Krumm and defending cham
pion Victoria Azarenka.
The tournament's presence itself signifies
the importance Stanford University places
on its women's athletics programs, particu
larly tennis. The Cardinal has the most suc
cessful women's tennis program in the
NCAA. By inviting the 32-player BotW to
campus, the University is supporting
women's initiatives in sports the world and
highlighting its success.
BotW also helps increase Stanford's ath
letic presence in the Bay Area community,
something the school struggles with occa
sionally. Many sportswriters touched on the
school's failure during the 2010 football sea
son to reach out to local residents and cater
the fan environment to them. The BotW an
nually invites the community to engage in
Stanford Athletics and see the school's top
players compete and engage with world-class
athletes in the community's backyard.
Tournament organizers do a great job of
making these players accessible while they
are playing, practicing or signing autographs.
It's easy for players to interact with their fans
and show their appreciation. As tennis be
comes more popular, the gap between player
and fan increases. At Stanford, this gap is
largely eliminated, and having a close inter
action with your favorite star is likely.

Seeing Cardinal
Five Cardinal players participated in the
tournament, including recent graduate Hi
lary Barte and incoming freshman Ellen
Tsay.

Barte recently finished up her career at
Stanford as a four-time All-American in both
singles and doubles and a two-time NCAA
doubles champion. She graduated as one of
the finest college players in the nation and a

hometown favorite at the Bank of the West
Classic. She was greeted as such in her first
round match, earning applause from those
who had watched her during her Stanford
days.

"It feels different," Barte said when asked
to describe the feeling of coming back to
Stanford as a professional. "The atmosphere
is way different. Even though it's Stanford
and I've played there for four years, it still
feels a little bit foreign."
Barte says that the transition from playing
