# STANFORD FOOTBALL
## POSITION PREVIEW 2011 FRONT SEVEN SEES NEW PERSONNEL 
### JOSEPH BEYDA ASST. SPORTS EDITOR 
Jan. 3 was a great day for Stanford Football.
It was an even better day for the Cardinal front
seven.
The ACC's highest-scoring team, Virginia
Tech, was held to a dozen points. Flashy Hokie
quarterback Tyrod Taylor was sacked eight
times. A triple-threat, top-20 rushing attack
gained just a third of its average yardage on the
ground.
But since that 40-12 Orange Bowl victory,
four members of Stanford's dominant 3-4
along with its primary architect have de
parted, leaving skeptics to wonder if one of the
nation's most improved defenses will be able
to build on the progress it made last year. And
with the Cardinal hoping to wrestle the inau
gural Pac-12 title from the grasp of defending
conference champion Oregon and the other

potent offenses it will face, the questions sur
rounding the defensive line and linebackers
are all the more pertinent.
A year ago, those questions were even
stronger. To contend for the conference title,
major improvements would be needed from a
Cardinal defense that ranked in the bottom
half of Division I in both points allowed and
sacks per game.
The story of Stanford's defensive turn
around in 2010 began in February, when 24-
year NFL coaching veteran Vic Fangio was
named the Cardinal's new defensive coordina
tor. He quickly instituted a 3-4 defense to high
light the talents of linebackers, such as then
sophomore Shayne Skov, junior Chase
Thomas and senior Owen Marecic.

"The 3-4 gave us a great opportunity to be
more creative with our pressure schemes,"
