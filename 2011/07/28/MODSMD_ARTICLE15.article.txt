## POSITION PREVIEW 2011 FRONT SEVEN SEES NEW PERSONNEL 
### JOSEPH BEYDA ASST. SPORTS EDITOR 
Jan. 3 was a great day for Stanford Football.
It was an even better day for the Cardinal front
seven.
The ACC's highest-scoring team, Virginia
Tech, was held to a dozen points. Flashy Hokie
quarterback Tyrod Taylor was sacked eight
times. A triple-threat, top-20 rushing attack
gained just a third of its average yardage on the
ground.
But since that 40-12 Orange Bowl victory,
four members of Stanford's dominant 3-4
along with its primary architect have de
parted, leaving skeptics to wonder if one of the
nation's most improved defenses will be able
to build on the progress it made last year. And
with the Cardinal hoping to wrestle the inau
gural Pac-12 title from the grasp of defending
conference champion Oregon and the other

potent offenses it will face, the questions sur
rounding the defensive line and linebackers
are all the more pertinent.
A year ago, those questions were even
stronger. To contend for the conference title,
major improvements would be needed from a
Cardinal defense that ranked in the bottom
half of Division I in both points allowed and
sacks per game.
The story of Stanford's defensive turn
around in 2010 began in February, when 24-
year NFL coaching veteran Vic Fangio was
named the Cardinal's new defensive coordina
tor. He quickly instituted a 3-4 defense to high
light the talents of linebackers, such as then
sophomore Shayne Skov, junior Chase
Thomas and senior Owen Marecic.

"The 3-4 gave us a great opportunity to be
more creative with our pressure schemes,"
Skov said. "It just allowed us to at
tack offenses and dictate the tempo
at times. It was a much more aggres
sive scheme, and we enjoyed that."
The move soon paid dividends,
converting a struggling defense into
a unit that would give up the 10th
fewest points in the nation and rank
15th in sacks. In just the second
game of the season, Stanford
pitched a shutout on the road for
the first time in 36 years, dominat
ing UCLA 35-0. The feat would be
pulled off twice more once at
home, once on the road making
for the first season since 1969 in
which Stanford held three oppo
nents scoreless. It's an accomplish
ment that the Cardinal is looking to
repeat.
"I won't give any guarantees,"
Skov said, "but hopefully we can
get a few, and if not match that
number, then get better."
This time around, though, they
won't do it under the watchful eye
of Fangio, who left with head coach
Jim Harbaugh to the San Francisco
49ers. He has since been replaced
by former 49ers outside linebackers
coach Jason Tarver, who will share
defensive coordinator duties with
Derek Mason.

"[Fangio] did a great job in
stalling the blueprints and the foun
dation of this defense that we want
to build," Thomas said. "But the
coaches weren't out there making
the plays. The players were the ones
out there making stops and coming
up with big-time plays when they
needed to. I feel like we have a great
amount of talent coming back to
build on that and even improve on
last season."

Although the defensive schemes
aren't expected to change heading
into this year, the players them
selves are another story. Holes re
main at both outside and inside
linebacker, as well as defensive end
and nose tackle. All four starting
spots are up for grabs.
Among the notable graduating
seniors was Marecic, a two-way
starter and eventual fourth-round
draft pick by the Cleveland Browns.
Despite the fatigue from the 110
snaps Marecic averaged per game,
his fellow inside linebacker Skov
doesn't recall many mistakes.
"The great thing about [Mare
cic] was that he was consistent,
play-in and play-out," Skov said.
"You never had to worry about
where he was; he was always doing
the right thing.
"Honestly, he was one of the

hardest workers on the team. It's
huge, and it's been showing for the
past four years. It's a great opportu
nity for someone to step up and
take the spot," Skov added.
Just as significant are the losses at
outside linebacker and on the de
fensive line, which returns only se
nior defensive end Matt Masifilo.

Stanford does retain its top four
tacklers among them, Skov and
Thomas, who tied for the team lead
in sacks last year with 7.5 each. But
the Cardinal loses a combined 94
career starts between Marecic, out
side linebacker Thomas Keiser, de
fensive end Brian Bulcke and nose
tackle Sione Fua. The experience
could be sorely missed.
"A lot of leadership from this
past year will have to step up, and
hopefully be better than the year
before," Skov said. "[We need to]
hold each other accountable and
come out motivated and fired up."
Both the returning starters and
the players competing for spots do
have one advantage over the gradu
ated seniors: a year of the 3-4 under
their belt.

"I think it's going to be real ben

eficial," Thomas said. "I noticed
this past spring ball, I wasn't think
ing as much, I knew all of my assign
ments, knew the playbook. That
just allowed me to play faster, react
to what I saw and attack the ball
more aggressively and with more
confidence than a year ago."
In fact, several non-starters have
already had their fair share of play
ing time under the 3-4; fifth-year se
nior Max Bergen and senior Alex
Debniak both linebackers
each played in all 13 games last sea
son, primarily as substitutes.

Once assembled, the new front
seven will work to avoid repeating
the lone defensive blemish on last
year's 12-1 season: the 52-31 loss at
Oregon. The normally dominant
Stanford run defense, which al
lowed fewer than 75 yards on the
ground on five occasions, surren
dered 388 rushing yards to the likes
of LaMichael James and Darron
Thomas in Eugene. It was also the
Cardinal's only game without a
sack.

Even before fall practice gets
into full swing, preparations have
already begun in the weight room.

"I think it started this offseason,
right now, getting into the condition
you need to play against Oregon's
no-huddle, high-tempo offense,"
Thomas said. "Our strength and
conditioning staff has really gotten
us in the right condition and state."
"I just think we need to focus on
our assignments and trust the guy
next to you to do his job," he added.
"That will allow us to play faster
and do what Auburn did [in the na
tional championship game against
Oregon] and just attack the quar
terback and running back."

Stanford won't host the Ducks
until Nov. 12 in what is sure to be
the Pac-12 North's marquee
matchup. The late-season game,
along with a schedule that many an
alysts consider backloaded, might
just give the linebackers and defen
sive line the time they need to adjust
to the new personnel.
And if that adjustment is smooth
enough, the front seven may have
another shot at big-stage heroics in
early January.

nation's most improved defenses will be able
to build on the progress it made last year. And
with the Cardinal hoping to wrestle the inau
gural Pac-12 title from the grasp of defending
conference champion Oregon and the other

potent offenses it will face, the questions sur
rounding the defensive line and linebackers
are all the more pertinent.
A year ago, those questions were even
stronger. To contend for the conference title,
major improvements would be needed from a
Cardinal defense that ranked in the bottom
half of Division I in both points allowed and
sacks per game.
The story of Stanford's defensive turn
around in 2010 began in February, when 24-
year NFL coaching veteran Vic Fangio was
named the Cardinal's new defensive coordina
tor. He quickly instituted a 3-4 defense to high
light the talents of linebackers, such as then
sophomore Shayne Skov, junior Chase
Thomas and senior Owen Marecic.

"The 3-4 gave us a great opportunity to be
more creative with our pressure schemes,"
Skov said. "It just allowed us to at
tack offenses and dictate the tempo
at times. It was a much more aggres
sive scheme, and we enjoyed that."
The move soon paid dividends,
converting a struggling defense into
a unit that would give up the 10th
fewest points in the nation and rank
15th in sacks. In just the second
game of the season, Stanford
pitched a shutout on the road for
the first time in 36 years, dominat
ing UCLA 35-0. The feat would be
pulled off twice more once at
home, once on the road making
for the first season since 1969 in
which Stanford held three oppo
nents scoreless. It's an accomplish
ment that the Cardinal is looking to
repeat.
"I won't give any guarantees,"
Skov said, "but hopefully we can
get a few, and if not match that
number, then get better."
This time around, though, they
won't do it under the watchful eye
of Fangio, who left with head coach
Jim Harbaugh to the San Francisco
49ers. He has since been replaced
by former 49ers outside linebackers
coach Jason Tarver, who will share
defensive coordinator duties with
Derek Mason.

"[Fangio] did a great job in
stalling the blueprints and the foun
dation of this defense that we want
to build," Thomas said. "But the
coaches weren't out there making
the plays. The players were the ones
out there making stops and coming
up with big-time plays when they
needed to. I feel like we have a great
amount of talent coming back to
build on that and even improve on
last season."

Although the defensive schemes
aren't expected to change heading
into this year, the players them
selves are another story. Holes re
main at both outside and inside
linebacker, as well as defensive end
and nose tackle. All four starting
spots are up for grabs.
Among the notable graduating
seniors was Marecic, a two-way
starter and eventual fourth-round
draft pick by the Cleveland Browns.
Despite the fatigue from the 110
snaps Marecic averaged per game,
his fellow inside linebacker Skov
doesn't recall many mistakes.
"The great thing about [Mare
cic] was that he was consistent,
play-in and play-out," Skov said.
"You never had to worry about
where he was; he was always doing
the right thing.
"Honestly, he was one of the

hardest workers on the team. It's
huge, and it's been showing for the
past four years. It's a great opportu
nity for someone to step up and
take the spot," Skov added.
Just as significant are the losses at
outside linebacker and on the de
fensive line, which returns only se
nior defensive end Matt Masifilo.

Stanford does retain its top four
tacklers among them, Skov and
Thomas, who tied for the team lead
in sacks last year with 7.5 each. But
the Cardinal loses a combined 94
career starts between Marecic, out
side linebacker Thomas Keiser, de
fensive end Brian Bulcke and nose
tackle Sione Fua. The experience
could be sorely missed.
"A lot of leadership from this
past year will have to step up, and
hopefully be better than the year
before," Skov said. "[We need to]
hold each other accountable and
come out motivated and fired up."
Both the returning starters and
the players competing for spots do
have one advantage over the gradu
ated seniors: a year of the 3-4 under
their belt.

"I think it's going to be real ben

eficial," Thomas said. "I noticed
this past spring ball, I wasn't think
ing as much, I knew all of my assign
ments, knew the playbook. That
just allowed me to play faster, react
to what I saw and attack the ball
more aggressively and with more
confidence than a year ago."
In fact, several non-starters have
already had their fair share of play
ing time under the 3-4; fifth-year se
nior Max Bergen and senior Alex
Debniak both linebackers
each played in all 13 games last sea
son, primarily as substitutes.

Once assembled, the new front
seven will work to avoid repeating
the lone defensive blemish on last
year's 12-1 season: the 52-31 loss at
Oregon. The normally dominant
Stanford run defense, which al
lowed fewer than 75 yards on the
ground on five occasions, surren
dered 388 rushing yards to the likes
of LaMichael James and Darron
Thomas in Eugene. It was also the
Cardinal's only game without a
sack.

Even before fall practice gets
into full swing, preparations have
already begun in the weight room.

"I think it started this offseason,
right now, getting into the condition
you need to play against Oregon's
no-huddle, high-tempo offense,"
Thomas said. "Our strength and
conditioning staff has really gotten
us in the right condition and state."
"I just think we need to focus on
our assignments and trust the guy
next to you to do his job," he added.
"That will allow us to play faster
and do what Auburn did [in the na
tional championship game against
Oregon] and just attack the quar
terback and running back."

Stanford won't host the Ducks
until Nov. 12 in what is sure to be
the Pac-12 North's marquee
matchup. The late-season game,
along with a schedule that many an
alysts consider backloaded, might
just give the linebackers and defen
sive line the time they need to adjust
to the new personnel.
And if that adjustment is smooth
enough, the front seven may have
another shot at big-stage heroics in
early January.

Linebackers Chase Thomas (left) and Shayne Skov (center) were both dominant in the Cardinal's 40-12 Orange
Bowl. They are two of the three returning members of Stanford's front seven, which loses Owen Marecic (right).
Jan. 3 was a great day for Stanford Football.
It was an even better day for the Cardinal front
seven.
The ACC's highest-scoring team, Virginia
Tech, was held to a dozen points. Flashy Hokie
quarterback Tyrod Taylor was sacked eight
times. A triple-threat, top-20 rushing attack
gained just a third of its average yardage on the
ground.
