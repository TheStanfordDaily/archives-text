# BALLGIRL WORK MAKES MEMORIES
## 
### ANGEL WANG INTERN 
It's 6:25 a.m. on Saturday, July 23.
I've never hated my alarm clock
more than I do right now. Snooze
button, you're a lifesaver.
6:30 a.m. Let's try snooze again.
6:32 a.m. I stare absentmindedly
at the ceiling, unable to fall back
asleep. Annoyed, I abandon my ef
forts and turn on the radio instead.
Bruno Mars' "Lazy Song" comes on.
How fitting.
6:36 a.m. More mindless staring
and frustrated thoughts. It's just
wrong to wake up this early on a Sat
urday morning, especially in the sum
mer. Why am I awake again?
Then I remember. I jump out of
bed, and excitement rushes through
me as I race through my morning
routine, suddenly eager to begin my
day.

It's my first day as a ballgirl in the
Bank of the West Classic.

Two hours later, I find myself in
the ballpersons' lounge in the base
ment of the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium. I pick up my credentials
and change into a rather expensive
uniform: a navy blue Essenza insert
skirt ($44), a red and blue Fila visor
($15.99), a black and white poly
ester jacket ($65) and a lime green
T-shirt marked with the BotW in
signia. Thrilled with the classy at
tire, I stroll back into the lounge in
a cheery mood. Suddenly, some
thing on the back wall catches my
eye. My stomach drops.
On the wall, our team assign
ments have been posted. All of the
ballpersons mob around the little
paper to check the team, court and
captain to which they've been as
signed for the day. In the back, I
stand on my tiptoes and strain to
see over the crowd. Am I mistaken?
I check once. Twice. Three times.
No, I'm not wrong. I have been
made captain of Team 6-B.
The rush of adrenaline, original
ly excitement, now flashes to ner
vousness. I have never worked as a
ballperson for a real match in my
life, but now I'm expected to lead
an entire team? Why me? Why was
I chosen? As if on cue, the ballper
son coordinator walks over with a
grin and tells me he wants to "try
something new." Fie proceeds to
relay the information necessary for
me as captain, but I'm feebly aware
of the directions; only with his reas
suring pat on the back do I break
out of my trance. I stand stunned.
While my incredulity builds, my
team assembles in front of me; five
young, bright-eyed faces stare ea
gerly at me, awaiting my orders.
Shakily, I put on a smiling facade
and go through the motions of my
role as a captain; I introduce myself,
assign positions, line up the ballper
sons and begin the walk up the
stairs to our assigned court. Yet
with each step, I feel the tension
growing in my gut; a parasitic ner
vousness eats away at my confi
dence. I am responsible for this
team. I am responsible for the flow
of the match. If we mess up and
break a player's concentration, we
will destroy hours of grueling train
ing and hard work. And it will all be
my fault. With these thoughts in
mind, the walk up the steps feels
like a trudge to the gallows.
At the top of the staircase, I in
stinctively close my eyes as if flinch
ing away from a fatal blow. With my
eyes still closed, I take a deep
breath and step into the sunlight.

And then something weird hap
pens. The animated tennis environ
ment envelops me, embraces me. I
hear the squeak of rubber soles on
the plexipave acrylic surface; I
smell the chemical scent of newly
opened ball cans; I feel the power
ful vibrations of tennis balls against
strings. I'm home. Tennis is my life,
and the court is my haven, a blanket
of familiarity. Slowly, the over
whelming weight on my shoulders
is lifted. I smile at my team mem

bers, and they flash their goofy
grins back at me. We have a job to
do, and we're ready to do it.
It was a fantastic experience. I
was so proud of my team: they were
alert, quick when necessary, yet
motionless when not. Sure, we all
made some mistakes, but overall,
we successfully allowed the match
to flow without interruption. We
proceeded to work three more 25-
minute shifts, and before we knew
it, 2 p.m. had arrived. With the con
clusion of my session, I reflected on
my day. In my panic, I had forgot
ten the enthusiasm I had for my job
as a ballgirl and the exhilaration of
working with the top tennis players
in the world. My geeky love for ten
nis reminded me to keep a positive
outlook on life; because of it, I en
joyed an incredible day filled with
strong teamwork, unwavering ded
ication and fantastic memories.

And I couldn't wait to wake up
at 6:30 the next morning to do it all
over again.
