# ADD REFS TO FRISBEE
## 
### Rachel Wolfard 
If you have glanced at the New
York Times, ESPN or even
The Stanford Daily, you have
most definitely seen sports
and athletes grabbing atten
tion in the headlines. Football. Basket
ball. Soccer. Andrew Luck. They have
each had their share of inspirational
stories and quotes plastered all over
the front pages.
As you skim through those papers
or begin changing the channel to catch
Sports Center, you may realize one of
your favorite childhood memories has
faded away to the periphery of the
sports spectrum. Some people may
argue that Ultimate Frisbee, an ob
scure yet physically demanding sport,
does not receive the magnitude of
recognition it deserves. I've come to
agree.

Growing up, I never put much
thought into Frisbee beyond the back
yard. I'll admit, I thought a flick of the
wrist and a buddy to pass the disk
around with was all it took. I never
thought about Frisbee as a competi
tive sport. I laughed when I heard the
team here at Stanford conditioned
more than teams back home. Little did
I know, the members of the Stanford
Ultimate team have dedicated their
lives and bodies to the rigors of Fris
bee. I had seen it as nothing more than
a cherished pastime.
Memories of tossing around a disk
as a child led me to Roble Field to im
merse myself into the true Frisbee cul
ture for the first time. As a part of Stan
ford's High School Summer College
program, I and other students fre
quently have the chance to participate
in pick-up games of ultimate.

I arrived at Roble for the first Tues
day night session in my jean shorts and
flip-flops, prepared for some old-fash
ioned, relatively stationary fun. As I
looked around, I saw nothing less than
athletic apparel and a couple pairs of
cleats. Needless to say, I felt a little un
prepared. I had officially experienced
an ultimate culture shock.

Although I was a little under
dressed for the occasion, I picked up a
Frisbee and gave it a toss. When I
turned around, the rest of the group
was already splitting up into teams and
began running up and down the length
of the grass field. As a favor to my del
egated team, I sat the first half out.
I finally had the concepts and rules
of the game explained to me as I sat
impressed on the sidelines. What I
took from the brief conversation
changed what I saw before me a
combination of three of the most
common sports: football, basketball
and soccer had been combined to
create an ultimate sport, one that re
quired the fundamental skills of each.
I gave the game a try in the second
half. I loved it. I wondered to myself
why a physically demanding and
unique sport such as ultimate doesn't
have a professional team or fans lined
up to buy tickets at games, just like
the three other sports it evolved
from.

As I learned more about the tech
nicalities, the answer became simple:
ultimate simply lacks the capacity to
gain fan support in the same ways that
the majority of other commonplace
sports do. The excitement and physi
cal action aren't lacking in ultimate,

and they aren't responsible for its low
profile fan base. It has more to do, per
haps, with human infatuation.
It's a difficult game for bystanders,
because the players have a partial role
as referees. In other words, they can
help call their own shots. The lack of
such a simple aspect of other popular
sports can cause the viewer to be dis
appointed. This unofficial side of ulti
mate may be the cause of little public
ity for the sport, but its relaxed touch
can be entrancing, too. I experienced
this exact feeling at my first and only
pro ultimate game held in San Fran
cisco a few weeks ago.
Although ultimate often struggles
for fan and media support, there is
definitely room for growth. The game
is all about having a good time and get
ting some fresh air. It certainly caught
my attention, and I know ultimate has
a bright future.

Rachel Wolfard hopes to become the
first-ever ultimate referee when the
sport gets more popular acclaim.
