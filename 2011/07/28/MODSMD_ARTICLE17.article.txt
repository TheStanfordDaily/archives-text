# ADD REFS TO FRISBEE

If you have glanced at the New
York Times, ESPN or even
The Stanford Daily, you have
most definitely seen sports
and athletes grabbing atten
tion in the headlines. Football. Basket
ball. Soccer. Andrew Luck. They have
each had their share of inspirational
stories and quotes plastered all over
the front pages.
As you skim through those papers
or begin changing the channel to catch
Sports Center, you may realize one of
your favorite childhood memories has
faded away to the periphery of the
sports spectrum. Some people may
argue that Ultimate Frisbee, an ob
scure yet physically demanding sport,
does not receive the magnitude of

agree.

Growing up, I never put much

I arrived at Roble for the first Tues

flip-flops, prepared for some old-fash
ioned, relatively stationary fun. As I
looked around, I saw nothing less than
athletic apparel and a couple pairs of
cleats. Needless to say, I felt a little un
prepared. I had officially experienced
an ultimate culture shock.

Although I was a little under
dressed for the occasion, I picked up a
Frisbee and gave it a toss. When I
turned around, the rest of the group
was already splitting up into teams and
began running up and down the length
of the grass field. As a favor to my del

I finally had the concepts and rules
of the game explained to me as I sat
