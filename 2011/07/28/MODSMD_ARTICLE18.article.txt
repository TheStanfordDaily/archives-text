# LUCK'S FAME COULD MAKE HIM DIVISIVE
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I was recently asked who was
the most polarizing athlete on
the Farm. My answer: star
quarterback Andrew Luck. I
admit that might seem a little
surprising given last year's record
breaking season, his decision to honor
us with one more year instead of im
mediately cashing in at the NFL Draft
and his numerous fans both on cam
pus and within the ranks of the media
and pros. I also should probably own
up to the fact that having been away
from Stanford for a while, my knowl
edge of current athletes is a little rusty.
But this was more than just picking
one of the few names I know: Luck
might j ust turn out to be the most divi
sive person on campus this year, not
despite the positive effect he has had

on Stanford football but because of it.
It would be wrong to attribute all of
the program's recent success to a sin
gle player, since, as the sports cliche
goes, you win or lose as a team. But it's
undeniable that he is by far the most
famous college athlete on our campus.
He caught national attention last year
with a season that would have earned
him the top pick in the NFL Draft
that is, until he brushed the chance
aside in favor of earning his degree
and when he returns for that final year
of college football, all eyes on and off
the Farm will be turned his way, scru
tinizing his every move. Opposing fans
will be looking for weaknesses; the
Red Zone will be praying for another
for weaknesses; the Red Zone will be
praying for another record-breaking
season; NFL scouts will be analyzing
his natural skills and physical condi
tion. Commentators and pundits
aside from delighting in the obvious
headline puns provided by his name
will be watching slow-motion re
peat after slow-motion repeat of his
every play.
Perhaps he will have that ultimate
season, leading the Cardinal unde
feated to the inaugural Pac-12 title,
capturing an improbable for Stan
ford— national championship, win
ning the Heisman Trophy, justifying a
No. 1 draft pick again and, of
course, graduating from the Farm in
June. But life isn't normally that per
fect. There are a million things that
could go wrong: a moment of indeci
sion, a misplaced pass, even the
threatening specter of injury. Holly
wood ending or not, though, there
will be innumerable moments to dis
cuss and argue about.
And that is exactly why he will be
so divisive. Freshmen will arrive on
campus not only already knowing his
name, but with all sorts of opinions
about his strengths and weaknesses.
Foreigners like me who may know
practically nothing about football will
at least know what a quarterback is.
And as for the rest of you, seasoned
Stanford fans or hardened enemies,
don't try to tell me you won't have an
opinion. Simply put, the more people
who watch, the more they'll disagree.
The typical idea of a polarizing
athlete is one who breaks the rules,
legal or athletic. But I disagree. Take,

for example, soccer superstar Cris
tiano Ronaldo: he clearly has phe
nomenal ability, but he infuriates fans
with his blatant cheating. He should
be polarizing, but he's not. Everyone
I've ever chatted to about him in
cluding a fair share of fans of his for
mer club, Manchester United, and
current team, Real Madrid has ba
sically had the same opinion: he'd be
great without the attitude. There isn't
a black and white difference of opin
ion; those who cheer for him only do
so only as a result of team loyalty.

Where Ronaldo becomes divisive
is in the fact that he is a player who can
win or lose games. Everyone watch
ing knows who he is, and everyone
knows who to blame when things go
wrong. For another soccer example,
just see how Argentinian fans treated
Lionel Messi, unequivocally the best
player in the world today, during their
team's less-than-stellar performance
in the Copa America. The quarter
back position in football is the same, if
not even more critical. Most soccer
players can play in different roles, but
it would be unthinkable to switch a
lineman to quarterback.
Because Luck has brought so
much attention to himself, because he
has set the bar so high and because his
position on the field is so critical, his
mistakes and he will make mis
takes— will stand out more than
those of perhaps any other college
athlete this year. And because it is al
ways easy to do so from the sidelines,
we will blame him, we will criticize
him and we will have easily enough
material to endlessly argue amongst
ourselves.

With any Luck, you find Tom Taylor
