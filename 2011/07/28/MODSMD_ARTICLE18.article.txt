# LUCK'S FAME COULD MAKE HIM DIVISIVE

### Tom Taylor 
I was recently asked who was
the most polarizing athlete on
the Farm. My answer: star
quarterback Andrew Luck. I
admit that might seem a little
surprising given last year's record
breaking season, his decision to honor
us with one more year instead of im
mediately cashing in at the NFL Draft
and his numerous fans both on cam
pus and within the ranks of the media
and pros. I also should probably own
up to the fact that having been away
from Stanford for a while, my knowl
edge of current athletes is a little rusty.
But this was more than just picking
one of the few names I know: Luck
might j ust turn out to be the most divi
sive person on campus this year, not
despite the positive effect he has had

on Stanford football but because of it.
It would be wrong to attribute all of
the program's recent success to a sin
gle player, since, as the sports cliche
goes, you win or lose as a team. But it's
undeniable that he is by far the most
famous college athlete on our campus.
He caught national attention last year
with a season that would have earned
him the top pick in the NFL Draft
that is, until he brushed the chance
aside in favor of earning his degree
and when he returns for that final year
of college football, all eyes on and off
the Farm will be turned his way, scru
tinizing his every move. Opposing fans
will be looking for weaknesses; the
Red Zone will be praying for another
