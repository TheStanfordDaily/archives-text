## EVALUATING EVIDENCE Undergraduates and the research projects that occupy their summers 
### ABHA SHARMA INTERN 
Though summer vacation
may evoke fond memories
of tanning at the beach,
playing volleyball in the
lawn or getting up at 11
a.m., others are hard at work devel
oping a thesis or a summer philan
thropy project. Every summer, many
Stanford students choose the latter
vacation plan, electing to spend their
free months working on various types
of research, with different motiva
tions.

Some students link up with profes
sors or graduate students with whom
they have had classes in the past, oth
ers are working on projects within
their departments or have been in
spired by personal experiences. Ayna
Agarwal *l4 became more interested
in philanthropy and social impact
after taking political science profes
sor Rob Reich's class, "Ethics of Phil
anthropy, Civil Society and Non-
Profits."
"I learned that approximately
$3OO billion are contributed to non
profits every year, yet too often the
measure of that impact is not quan
tifiable and remains unclear," she
wrote in an email to The Daily.
She searched different Stanford
departments for a project that
matched this curiosity and was led to
economics professor Woody Pow
ell, with whom she is currently
working on a summer project
concerning evalua
tion and metrics in
the nonprofit
sector. For 20
hours a week,
/ over 10 weeks
—oLlhc summer,
i she is document
ing different sources
and types of nonprofit
evaluation and using that informa
tion to explain its effect on the Unit
ed States and abroad.
"I am exploring over 250 websites
to collect data which will eventually
be sorted into a larger networking
scheme to understand relationships
between these different measure
ment factors," Agarwal said.
"I want to become a better re
searcher within the social sciences
and continue pursuing this project
until its completion," she added.
Other students choose pro
jects that place them in Stan
ford's innumerable labs.

Calvin Fernandez 'l3 is working on a
combined project with Billington and
Frank Labs called the Bioinsulation
Foam Project. He is working with a
foam that contains PHBV (poly-3-
hydroxy butyrate-co-valerate), which
is a type of bio-plastic that currently
isn't foaming properly.
His job is to create a process in
which silk can be turned into powder
so that this powder can be combined
with the foam the idea being that
the powder will help the PHBV foam
better by producing larger bubbles.
Devoting about 40 hours a week to
the project, Fernandez says the main
reason he chose to work on it was that
it sparked his interest.

"I might pursue something similar
later for a thesis, but this summer is
simply because I was interested in the
project," he said.

Despite his efforts, he recognizes
that the daunting task that he faces
may go unfinished.

"By the end of the summer, it
would be nice to have the answer to
the problem, but I know that's not
going to happen so I'll just settle with
some intriguing results that I can
write an interesting paper about," he
said.

Still other students use summer as
a time to work on their honors theses,
like Anna Robertson 'l2, a double
major in psychology and English.
Robertson first became interested in
psychology after taking Introduction
to Psychology her freshman year, and
she spent the summer after that doing
psychology research though a psy
chology summer internship program.
This fall, she will be working in a lab
and is spending a large chunk of her
summer planning her thesis research
project.

"I began to dedicate much more
time to planning my thesis during the
spring and, after spending a little over
a month working on my thesis on
campus this summer, I think I will be
in good standing to begin running
subjects in the fall," she explained.
"Because psychology theses typically
involve human subjects, which in turn
requires an extensive review by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB),
my time this summer has been devot
ed to preparing my thesis."
"This involves writing the com
puter program I will use, selecting
relevant measures, outlining proto
cols and doing literature searches,"

she added.
For other students like Natalie
Cox 'l2, this summer involves simul
taneously balancing theses and inde
pendent research projects. Cox is
working with Michael Klausner, a
professor of business at Stanford Law
School. She spends 20 hours a week
working with him and an additional
20 doing independent research for
her thesis. Potentially interested in
pursuing a joint degree in economics
and law, she is able to explore both
fields while furthering her capstone
project.

"I wanted to get firsthand experi
ence in research and get some work
done on my thesis," she explained. "I
do a lot of work with securities class
action data with professor Michael
Klausner at the Stanford Law
School. [My] tasks include cleaning,
sorting though it and figuring out
how to best turn raw information
from law dockets or complaints into
uniform data that is actually usable
in an empirical study. For instance, I
might go through a set of cases and
map the different stages at which
they settle."

But among those aiming for publi
cation or in pursuit of a cure for can
cer, some students doing research
over the vacation simply wanted
some work experience. Moses Gon
zales 'l3 is working 10 hours a week
as a lab assistant through the Office
of Accessible Education. Gonzales
has been researching uranium conta
mination in ground water since May
of this year and plans to continue to
do so until the end of next year.
"My ultimate goal for this position
is essentially to gain as much hands
on experience as possible," he said.
"While I definitely hope to help the
lab make some cool discoveries, my
focus is not on the research but on the
skills I am gaining."

He does, however, plan to stick
with the job for the "foreseeable fu
ture" and potentially through the re
mainder of his Stanford career.

"I plan to continue working in this
lab at least through the end of next
year," he said. "And then depending
on my plans when the year ends, I
may continue working in the lab
through next summer and my senior
year as well."

"By the end of the
summer, it would
be nice to have the
answer to the
problem, but I
know that snot
going to happen."

is essentially to gain as much hands
on experience as possible," he said.
"While I definitely hope to help the
lab make some cool discoveries, my
focus is not on the research but on the
skills I am gaining."

He does, however, plan to stick
with the job for the "foreseeable fu
ture" and potentially through the re
mainder of his Stanford career.

"I plan to continue working in this
lab at least through the end of next
year," he said. "And then depending
on my plans when the year ends, I
may continue working in the lab
through next summer and my senior
year as well."

Though summer vacation
may evoke fond memories
of tanning at the beach,
playing volleyball in the
lawn or getting up at 11
a.m., others are hard at work devel
oping a thesis or a summer philan
thropy project. Every summer, many
Stanford students choose the latter
vacation plan, electing to spend their
free months working on various types
of research, with different motiva
tions.

Some students link up with profes
sors or graduate students with whom
they have had classes in the past, oth
ers are working on projects within
their departments or have been in
spired by personal experiences. Ayna
Agarwal *l4 became more interested
in philanthropy and social impact
after taking political science profes
sor Rob Reich's class, "Ethics of Phil
anthropy, Civil Society and Non-
Profits."
"I learned that approximately
$3OO billion are contributed to non
profits every year, yet too often the
measure of that impact is not quan
tifiable and remains unclear," she
wrote in an email to The Daily.
She searched different Stanford
departments for a project that
matched this curiosity and was led to
economics professor Woody Pow
ell, with whom she is currently
working on a summer project
concerning evalua
tion and metrics in
the nonprofit
sector. For 20
hours a week,
/ over 10 weeks
—oLlhc summer,
i she is document
ing different sources
and types of nonprofit
evaluation and using that informa
tion to explain its effect on the Unit
ed States and abroad.
"I am exploring over 250 websites
to collect data which will eventually
be sorted into a larger networking
scheme to understand relationships
between these different measure
ment factors," Agarwal said.
"I want to become a better re
searcher within the social sciences
and continue pursuing this project
until its completion," she added.
Other students choose pro
jects that place them in Stan
ford's innumerable labs.

Calvin Fernandez 'l3 is working on a
combined project with Billington and
Frank Labs called the Bioinsulation
Foam Project. He is working with a
foam that contains PHBV (poly-3-
hydroxy butyrate-co-valerate), which
is a type of bio-plastic that currently
isn't foaming properly.
His job is to create a process in
which silk can be turned into powder
so that this powder can be combined
with the foam the idea being that
the powder will help the PHBV foam
better by producing larger bubbles.
Devoting about 40 hours a week to
the project, Fernandez says the main
reason he chose to work on it was that
it sparked his interest.

"I might pursue something similar
later for a thesis, but this summer is
simply because I was interested in the
project," he said.

Despite his efforts, he recognizes
that the daunting task that he faces
may go unfinished.

"By the end of the summer, it
would be nice to have the answer to
the problem, but I know that's not
going to happen so I'll just settle with
some intriguing results that I can
write an interesting paper about," he
said.

Still other students use summer as
a time to work on their honors theses,
like Anna Robertson 'l2, a double
major in psychology and English.
Robertson first became interested in
psychology after taking Introduction
to Psychology her freshman year, and
she spent the summer after that doing
psychology research though a psy
chology summer internship program.
This fall, she will be working in a lab
and is spending a large chunk of her
summer planning her thesis research
project.

"I began to dedicate much more
time to planning my thesis during the
spring and, after spending a little over
a month working on my thesis on
campus this summer, I think I will be
in good standing to begin running
subjects in the fall," she explained.
"Because psychology theses typically
involve human subjects, which in turn
requires an extensive review by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB),
my time this summer has been devot
ed to preparing my thesis."
"This involves writing the com
puter program I will use, selecting
relevant measures, outlining proto
cols and doing literature searches,"

she added.
For other students like Natalie
Cox 'l2, this summer involves simul
taneously balancing theses and inde
pendent research projects. Cox is
working with Michael Klausner, a
professor of business at Stanford Law
School. She spends 20 hours a week
working with him and an additional
20 doing independent research for
her thesis. Potentially interested in
pursuing a joint degree in economics
and law, she is able to explore both
fields while furthering her capstone
project.

"I wanted to get firsthand experi
ence in research and get some work
done on my thesis," she explained. "I
do a lot of work with securities class
action data with professor Michael
Klausner at the Stanford Law
School. [My] tasks include cleaning,
sorting though it and figuring out
how to best turn raw information
from law dockets or complaints into
uniform data that is actually usable
in an empirical study. For instance, I
might go through a set of cases and
map the different stages at which
they settle."

But among those aiming for publi
cation or in pursuit of a cure for can
cer, some students doing research
over the vacation simply wanted
some work experience. Moses Gon
zales 'l3 is working 10 hours a week
as a lab assistant through the Office
of Accessible Education. Gonzales
has been researching uranium conta
mination in ground water since May
of this year and plans to continue to
do so until the end of next year.
"My ultimate goal for this position
is essentially to gain as much hands
on experience as possible," he said.
"While I definitely hope to help the
lab make some cool discoveries, my
focus is not on the research but on the
skills I am gaining."
