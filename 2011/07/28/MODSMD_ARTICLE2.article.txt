## LOCAL Palo Alto Art Center starts $7.9M renovation project 
### HARINI JAGANATHAN INTERN 
The Palo Alto Art Center, a facility that has
provided public events, art exhibitions and art
instruction to the community since 1971, broke
ground on a $7.9 million renovation project
July 16.

The center has been closed since April, and
the renovation is scheduled to be completed
next summer.

"It was an incredible celebration of moving
forward on this project," said Karen Kienzle,
the center's director. "So many people have
worked so hard to make this possible, and it
was just a wonderful way to celebrate with the
community."

The funding for the renovation will come
from both the Palo Alto Art Center Founda
tion, a private nonprofit organization, and the
City of Palo Alto.

"It's kind of roughly a split of the costs,"
Kienzle said. "We look at this as a wonderful
example of individuals in the private sector
coming together to make a difference in the
community."

Some of the major changes include a new
children's wing, upgrades for visitors with
disabilities, new flooring, new landscaping

and transformed exhibition spaces and class
rooms.
"We're also doing mechanical, electrical
and HVAC upgrades throughout the build
ing," Kienzle said. "That will be a really won
derful benefit for community members, be
cause we did not have any air conditioning in
the facility, so on [a warm day] it would often
be really oppressive in the Art Center, and it
was really difficult. We were constantly apolo
gizing to visitors that there is nothing we can do
about the ventilation or how hot it is because
we just don't have air conditioning. Not a good
situation for visitors and not a good situation
for artwork."
The current Art Center was built in the
1950s as the Palo Alto City Hall and was later
converted into the Art Center when the City
Hall was moved downtown.
The architecture firm Mark Cavagnero and
Associates is conducting the renovation.
Architect Mark Cavagnero found that the
unique part of designing the Art Center was
transforming the interior to make it feel more
like an art gallery and less like an administrative
building while maintaining the old exterior.
