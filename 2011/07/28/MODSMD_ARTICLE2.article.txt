## LOCAL Palo Alto Art Center starts $7.9M renovation project 
### HARINI JAGANATHAN INTERN 
The Palo Alto Art Center, a facility that has
provided public events, art exhibitions and art
instruction to the community since 1971, broke
ground on a $7.9 million renovation project
July 16.

The center has been closed since April, and
the renovation is scheduled to be completed
next summer.

"It was an incredible celebration of moving
forward on this project," said Karen Kienzle,
the center's director. "So many people have
worked so hard to make this possible, and it
was just a wonderful way to celebrate with the
community."

The funding for the renovation will come
from both the Palo Alto Art Center Founda
tion, a private nonprofit organization, and the
City of Palo Alto.

"It's kind of roughly a split of the costs,"
Kienzle said. "We look at this as a wonderful
example of individuals in the private sector
coming together to make a difference in the
community."

Some of the major changes include a new
children's wing, upgrades for visitors with
disabilities, new flooring, new landscaping

and transformed exhibition spaces and class
rooms.
"We're also doing mechanical, electrical
and HVAC upgrades throughout the build
ing," Kienzle said. "That will be a really won
derful benefit for community members, be
cause we did not have any air conditioning in
the facility, so on [a warm day] it would often
be really oppressive in the Art Center, and it
was really difficult. We were constantly apolo
gizing to visitors that there is nothing we can do
about the ventilation or how hot it is because
we just don't have air conditioning. Not a good
situation for visitors and not a good situation
for artwork."
The current Art Center was built in the
1950s as the Palo Alto City Hall and was later
converted into the Art Center when the City
Hall was moved downtown.
The architecture firm Mark Cavagnero and
Associates is conducting the renovation.
Architect Mark Cavagnero found that the
unique part of designing the Art Center was
transforming the interior to make it feel more
like an art gallery and less like an administrative
building while maintaining the old exterior.
"[We had] to convert office spaces to gal-

leries, to classrooms, to workshops
and have them feel like galleries,
classrooms and workshops," Cav
agnero said. "That's what we really
wanted: the energy and the vibrancy
and the excitement that an Art Cen
ter should have, because the things
that go on in there are exciting."
Cavagnero felt that changes to
the gallery space will be significant.

"Within the confines of the exist
ing structure, we're making a great
deal more volume," he said. "They
could start to display larger scale art,
they could have better lighting an
gles because the lighting can be fur
ther removed from the art. It's just
going to change the feel of it dramat
ically."
Art professor Enrique Chagoya
has had his work exhibited at the
Palo Alto Art Center several times.

"I think outside the University,
it's probably the most visible art cen
ter in Palo Alto," Chagoya said. "It's
a very important community re
source."
Cantor Arts Center director
Thomas Seligman has also admired
the work of the Palo Alto Art Cen
ter.

"Their exhibition program has
been first rate," Seligman said.
"They focused on a number of very
interesting artists who tend to be re

gional, and often they've had very
interesting thematic exhibitions, so
I've been quite a fan of their exhibi
tion program."
Although the Art Center has
been closed since April, its staff is
still continuing to serve the com
munity with its "On the Road" pro
grams. The Art Center's Art Truck
has been traveling to various com
munity festivals, and the Art Cen
ter has offered classes at various lo
cations throughout the city and has

set up temporary art installations.
"It's our intention to really retain
our current audiences and to grow
our audiences during 'On the Road,'
because we have this wonderful abil
ity to reach more people and to
reach new people, so that when the
Art Center reopens, we'll have a
whole new audience to serve," Kien
zle said.
