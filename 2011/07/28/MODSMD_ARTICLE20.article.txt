## Highlights from football media day 
### DAILY SPORTS STAFF â€“ Joseph Beyda 
Head football coach David
Shaw and star quarterback Andrew
Luck both spoke on Tuesday in Los
Angeles as Stanford's delegation to
the Pac-12 Media Day. Each team
in the conference sent a head coach
and one player to the event.

While most teams had to ad
dress questions about roster build
ing or potential NCAA rules viola
tions, most of the Stanford discus
sion centered on the transition
from former head coach Jim Har
baugh to Shaw. Luck, who had
worked closely with Harbaugh to
develop as a quarterback, expand-

Ed on the strong relationship with
his new head coach.

"Shaw's been huge [in my ca
reer]; he recruited me here," Luck
said. "My redshirt year, when I
wasn't playing, it always seemed
like it would be coach Shaw that
would take me aside every now and
then during practice and say, 'Re
member, you're preparing yourself
to play, don't just take the scout
team reps like they're nothing.'...
He was instrumental in teaching
me the West Coast system and
everything with this offense."
Despite Shaw's experience as a
Cardinal player and coach, many
fear that he lacks the fiery person
ality that worked so well for Har
baugh. Shaw agreed with this eval

uation while stressing the similari
ties between himself and his prede
cessor.
"My job is to maintain the com
petitive spirit," he said. "That's
one of the main things that Har
baugh and I have in common.
We're going to compete; we're
going to fight. [Harbaugh and I]
have different personalities, but at
the same time and you can ask
the guys when somebody cross
es a line, I'll be nose to nose with
them. I might not be yelling at
them, but there's a standard that
we need to play up to, and it's my
job to make sure we do that."
Shaw also explained that he
planned to use that standard to de
termine personnel and schemes for
the season to come, especially
among the generally inexperi
enced wide receivers.
"The best thing we've got hang
ing over our heads is that we've got
a very talented tight-end group,"
he said. "If the receivers don't step
up, we'll throw the ball to the tight
ends. We don't care, it's all about
competition."
There's another change in the
works that Stanford fans probably
hadn't been anticipating, and it's

taking place on Luck's face, which
has sprouted a beard in recent
weeks. While the facial hair added
some humor to Media Day, it
might not be permanent.
"I honestly haven't thought
past tomorrow about what to do
with it," Luck said. "I've never had
a beard I'm hesitant to call it a

beard, I don't think it's quite there
yet but I don't know. I've never
done it before, so why not try?
We'll see if it lasts. When I get an
noyed of it, I'll shave it."
"I just hope his helmet fits,"
Shaw added.
