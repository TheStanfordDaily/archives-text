## CAPCOM'S CONFUSION DAMAGES 'MEGA MAN' FRANCHISE 
### — nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
I'm used to game cancellations.
They happen all the time, and
without them, developers would

get mired in unproductive efforts. But when
word got to me last week that Capcom had can
celled "Mega Man Legends 3," my gut reaction
was just a hint of despair and befuddlement on

top my usual, pragmatic acceptance of

"well, I suppose they'd know if their
game sucked."

With a bit of reflection, I can
see why the headline hit me that
way. The "Legends 3" cancella
tion caps off a couple years'
worth of Capcom mishandling
the "Mega Man" franchise as
whole, and I'm starting to
wonder if an awkward, transi
tional phase could stretch into
the series' long, slow death.

"Legends" and its offbeat
sequel became cult hits in the
truest sense —just take a look
at the user score on the other
wise abysmal Metacritic page for

"Megaman 64." The third game continued that
legacy with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge
announcement from creator Keiji Inafune and a
ton of ways for gamers to give input on the
direction for the game, from voting on charac
ter designs to a (never-released) "prototype"
version of the game. I've never seen fan service
quite like that. But I've also never seen such a
poorly handled cancellation.
Capcom somehow figured that the best
time to shatter fans' dreams of a 3DS threequel
was at the start of last week's Comic-Con in San
Diego, one of the planet's biggest gatherings of
geekdom and a hub for Capcom faithful. Talk
about a buzz kill. After inviting fans to take part

in the process like never before, it felt

like a stab in the back.

Then they twisted the knife.

Rumors went around that Capcom

was denying "Mega Man" cosplayers entrance

to its Comic-Con booth, and a tweet from
Capcom Europe "explained" the cancellation by
blaming fans for not participating enough in
development. An awkward and roundabout
retraction of the statement a day later did little
but suggest the company's growing misunder
standing of its fans. The explanation should
have clear and unified; it was anything but.
Capcom USA's Vice President of Strategic
Planning and Business Development Christian
Svensson essentially shrugged his shoulders at
the Capcom Europe comment, and as far as I
know, Capcom Japan has said nothing. I realize


COURTESY CAPCOM

that community managers and not developers run
Capcom's Twitter accounts, but that's not an excuse for a
botched breakup from fans' unfulfilled love affair with
"Legends 3." To be frank, it looks like the company does-

n't have it together.
That brings me back to the befuddlement I men
tioned earlier: since at least when Inafune left the company
in a huff last October, Capcom has pushed Mega Man in
all kinds of directions while ultimately going nowhere but
into a downward spiral. When I list out all the ideas
Capcom has flaunted, scrapped and missed, I can almost
distill it to a single, metaphorical board meeting that repre
sents the Inafime-less company's panic. Should they move
Mega Man further into the downloadable space and
champion user-generated content? Maybe, one bigwig
says. They seemed awfully keen on the "LitfießigPlanet"-
esque "Mega Man Universe" before sweeping it aside
under "various circumstances" last March. Then another
suit wonders: should they return to the series' roots? Nope.
After rebooting the original 8-bit games with Mega Man 9
and 10 in the last two years, the company has kept mum
about a possible 11th entry. Hmm. What about expanding
their fan-favorite side story and taking advantage of 3D
hardware? We know the answer to that already—they
delayed "Legends 3's" prototype version and, of course,
awkwardly scrapped the full game on Comic-Con eve.
If only Inafune-san were fere, I'm sure they were
thinking.

The latest head-scratcher is more subtle, but no less
concerning. Capcom left "Mega Man" fans in the cold
when it didn't include the Blue Bomber in "Marvel vs.
Capcom 3" ("McC3") last year, and most assumed the
company was priming its most beloved character for a
money-grubbing downloadable-content pack some

months later.
Irritating, but
acceptable.
Imagine the
confusion, then,

as fans pored over the recently leaked roster for an updat
ed version of "MvC3." No Mega Man to be seen. Really?
12 new fighters and no Mega Man? That's a major snub,
like Nintendo releasing a "Smash Bros." game without
Mario.

As much as I'd like to, I'll never be privy to exactly
what's happening in Capcom's boardrooms right now.
For a moment, it seemed like Mega Man's resurgence was
spearheading the company's iterative and innovative
efforts, staying true to its roots, its fans and its legacy of
excellence. But just as quickly, Capcom swept Mega Man
under the rug. The easy explanation is probably the right
one: with Inafune gone, the company doesn't have a clue
what to do with his old cash cow. The franchise is adrift in
the ocean and caught in a storm of ideas from people who
weren't around when the series started, not unlike "Leno"

or "Lost" during a writers' strike.
Inafune's departure may have left Mega Man's inheri
tors in the dark, but they're only dimming the lights by
neglecting their fans and over-regulating the blue boy's
appearances in games he belongs in. With the cancellation of
fan-centric titles like "Legends 3" and "Universe," I wonder
if Capcom has concluded that Mega Man's future should
come from the top down, even without Inafune. I'm okay
with that, but I hope they don't keep acting like the best
decision is to stop making Mega Man games altogether.

botched breakup from fans' unfulfilled love affair with
"Legends 3." To be frank, it looks like the company does-

n't have it together.
That brings me back to the befuddlement I men
tioned earlier: since at least when Inafune left the company
in a huff last October, Capcom has pushed Mega Man in
all kinds of directions while ultimately going nowhere but
into a downward spiral. When I list out all the ideas
Capcom has flaunted, scrapped and missed, I can almost
distill it to a single, metaphorical board meeting that repre
sents the Inafime-less company's panic. Should they move
Mega Man further into the downloadable space and
champion user-generated content? Maybe, one bigwig
says. They seemed awfully keen on the "LitfießigPlanet"-
esque "Mega Man Universe" before sweeping it aside
under "various circumstances" last March. Then another
suit wonders: should they return to the series' roots? Nope.
After rebooting the original 8-bit games with Mega Man 9
and 10 in the last two years, the company has kept mum
about a possible 11th entry. Hmm. What about expanding
their fan-favorite side story and taking advantage of 3D
hardware? We know the answer to that already—they
delayed "Legends 3's" prototype version and, of course,
awkwardly scrapped the full game on Comic-Con eve.
If only Inafune-san were fere, I'm sure they were
thinking.

The latest head-scratcher is more subtle, but no less
concerning. Capcom left "Mega Man" fans in the cold
when it didn't include the Blue Bomber in "Marvel vs.
Capcom 3" ("McC3") last year, and most assumed the
company was priming its most beloved character for a
money-grubbing downloadable-content pack some

months later.
Irritating, but
acceptable.
Imagine the
confusion, then,

as fans pored over the recently leaked roster for an updat
ed version of "MvC3." No Mega Man to be seen. Really?
12 new fighters and no Mega Man? That's a major snub,
like Nintendo releasing a "Smash Bros." game without
Mario.

As much as I'd like to, I'll never be privy to exactly
what's happening in Capcom's boardrooms right now.
For a moment, it seemed like Mega Man's resurgence was
spearheading the company's iterative and innovative
efforts, staying true to its roots, its fans and its legacy of
excellence. But just as quickly, Capcom swept Mega Man
under the rug. The easy explanation is probably the right
one: with Inafune gone, the company doesn't have a clue
what to do with his old cash cow. The franchise is adrift in
the ocean and caught in a storm of ideas from people who
weren't around when the series started, not unlike "Leno"

or "Lost" during a writers' strike.
Inafune's departure may have left Mega Man's inheri
tors in the dark, but they're only dimming the lights by
neglecting their fans and over-regulating the blue boy's
appearances in games he belongs in. With the cancellation of
fan-centric titles like "Legends 3" and "Universe," I wonder
if Capcom has concluded that Mega Man's future should
come from the top down, even without Inafune. I'm okay
with that, but I hope they don't keep acting like the best
decision is to stop making Mega Man games altogether.

I'm used to game cancellations.
They happen all the time, and
without them, developers would

get mired in unproductive efforts. But when
word got to me last week that Capcom had can
celled "Mega Man Legends 3," my gut reaction
was just a hint of despair and befuddlement on

top my usual, pragmatic acceptance of

"well, I suppose they'd know if their
game sucked."

With a bit of reflection, I can
see why the headline hit me that
way. The "Legends 3" cancella
tion caps off a couple years'
worth of Capcom mishandling
the "Mega Man" franchise as
whole, and I'm starting to
wonder if an awkward, transi
tional phase could stretch into
the series' long, slow death.

"Legends" and its offbeat
sequel became cult hits in the
truest sense —just take a look
at the user score on the other
wise abysmal Metacritic page for

"Megaman 64." The third game continued that
legacy with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge
announcement from creator Keiji Inafune and a
ton of ways for gamers to give input on the
direction for the game, from voting on charac
ter designs to a (never-released) "prototype"
version of the game. I've never seen fan service
quite like that. But I've also never seen such a
poorly handled cancellation.
Capcom somehow figured that the best
time to shatter fans' dreams of a 3DS threequel
was at the start of last week's Comic-Con in San
Diego, one of the planet's biggest gatherings of
geekdom and a hub for Capcom faithful. Talk
about a buzz kill. After inviting fans to take part

in the process like never before, it felt

like a stab in the back.

Then they twisted the knife.

Rumors went around that Capcom

was denying "Mega Man" cosplayers entrance

to its Comic-Con booth, and a tweet from
Capcom Europe "explained" the cancellation by
blaming fans for not participating enough in
development. An awkward and roundabout
retraction of the statement a day later did little
but suggest the company's growing misunder
standing of its fans. The explanation should
have clear and unified; it was anything but.
Capcom USA's Vice President of Strategic
Planning and Business Development Christian
Svensson essentially shrugged his shoulders at
the Capcom Europe comment, and as far as I
know, Capcom Japan has said nothing. I realize
