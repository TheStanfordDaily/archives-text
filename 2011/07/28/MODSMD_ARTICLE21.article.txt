## CAPCOM'S CONFUSION DAMAGES 'MEGA MAN' FRANCHISE 
### — nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
I'm used to game cancellations.
They happen all the time, and
without them, developers would

get mired in unproductive efforts. But when
word got to me last week that Capcom had can
celled "Mega Man Legends 3," my gut reaction
was just a hint of despair and befuddlement on

top my usual, pragmatic acceptance of

"well, I suppose they'd know if their
game sucked."

With a bit of reflection, I can
see why the headline hit me that
way. The "Legends 3" cancella
tion caps off a couple years'
worth of Capcom mishandling
the "Mega Man" franchise as
whole, and I'm starting to
wonder if an awkward, transi
tional phase could stretch into
the series' long, slow death.

"Legends" and its offbeat
sequel became cult hits in the
truest sense —just take a look
at the user score on the other
wise abysmal Metacritic page for

"Megaman 64." The third game continued that
legacy with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge
announcement from creator Keiji Inafune and a
ton of ways for gamers to give input on the
direction for the game, from voting on charac
ter designs to a (never-released) "prototype"
version of the game. I've never seen fan service
quite like that. But I've also never seen such a
poorly handled cancellation.
Capcom somehow figured that the best
time to shatter fans' dreams of a 3DS threequel
was at the start of last week's Comic-Con in San
Diego, one of the planet's biggest gatherings of
geekdom and a hub for Capcom faithful. Talk
about a buzz kill. After inviting fans to take part

in the process like never before, it felt

like a stab in the back.

Then they twisted the knife.

Rumors went around that Capcom

was denying "Mega Man" cosplayers entrance

to its Comic-Con booth, and a tweet from
Capcom Europe "explained" the cancellation by
blaming fans for not participating enough in
development. An awkward and roundabout
retraction of the statement a day later did little
but suggest the company's growing misunder
standing of its fans. The explanation should
have clear and unified; it was anything but.
Capcom USA's Vice President of Strategic
Planning and Business Development Christian
Svensson essentially shrugged his shoulders at
the Capcom Europe comment, and as far as I
know, Capcom Japan has said nothing. I realize
