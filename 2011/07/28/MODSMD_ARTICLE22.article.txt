## Ash takes the family tour

This week's episode was a big deal for two
reasons: one, because Ashley got to meet
her boyfriends' families, and two,
because it made me cry. Like, several times.
We were down to the final four Harvard
boy Ames, irresistible sexpot JP and the
Neanderthal Twins (Constantine and Ben)
and the first hometown date was with the large
and generally uninteresting Constantard.
Traditionally, Constantine has been a giant,
empty space for me, a bulky, unattractive, awk
ward space-waster, but for some reason, in the
context of his hometown he was kind of com
pelling, and he and Ash were almost sort of cute.
Sure, he's still a big, boring lump, but he's real
and kind of goofy. His family, one Big Fat Greek
Stereotype, was tremendously endearing. Oh,
and he had one of those stupid white puffball
dogs that wandered around ignored by everyone
despite its magical ability to make everyone
impossible to take seriously simply
by standing vaguely in their vicinity.
Final Score: B-, extra points for his
one-liners but points redacted for his
stupid little rat-dog.
The second date was with Ames,
who was looking uncharacteristically
attractive (though he immediately
ruined the effect by trotting over to
Ash when she showed up; as it turns
out, he runs like a girl). Ames is from
an extremely old-money New-
Englander sort of family, complete
with horses and a freaking indoor
pool, and his family wasv«y digni
fied, but in a likeable way. While
interacting with Ash, he was confi
dent, smarmy, optimistic and
adorable. I was even able to (briefly)
take him seriously when his mother
explained to Ashley that his father
died when he was 10 and that his
stepfather had been a genuine father
figure before dying only years after
stepping in (author cry count: one).
Final Score: C+, because he spent
about 10 minutes talking about
"sprezzatura" (an old Castiglione
term for feigned nonchalance) and
pretending that it meant spontaneity
and romance. Come on, Ames, you
might be able to fool your dim little
dentist, but I'm an English major.
You can do better.
Third date was with Ben, who
get ready for awesome called
her "Ash" when he saw her. That's my
thing! I've been doing that since day
one, you guys, and now it's catching
on and I was the one who started
it. High point of the date: they were

getting hot and heavy on top of a
case of wine, and Ash broke away to
say, "I wish my mother was here, she
would love this." Again, a dead rela
tive was unveiled. Ben actually

showed emotions and shed real tears
when talking to the camera about
having stepped up as head of the
family when his father passed away™,
the show is really fond of dead rela
tives (author cry count: two). Final
score: B, because Ash was clearly into
it, even though he is utterly lifeless in
my eyes.

On a side note, it was at this
point in the show that I realized
Ashley is 23 years old (that's me in
three years) and wants to get married
this desperately. My theory is that
she's tired of being so thin and hot
and wants to get fat, but needs to
lock a guy down first. Regardless of
whether or not she ends up getting
fat in the next few years, I will still
believe in this theory.

Moving on: for the last date, the
producers finally gave the audience
what they wanted, and let us gaze
upon JP. God , that man is attractive;
every time he's onscreen, every single
girl that I watch this show with
screams and squeals. We're all going

to marry him.
For his date, JP reserved a roller
rink and the two of them skated

around with a disco ball and goofy
'Bos tunes playing in the background;
it's like a middle school dance but
with a whole lot more sex appeal.
The guy knows the absolute most
romantic thing to say to everything
it's sensational. He's the perfect
man strong and sexy yet willing to
show vulnerability. The worst part is
I don't think Ashley's going to
choose him, because she seems more
excited about stupid, boring, Homo
erectus Ben. JP spent some time

telling the camera that he's afraid

she'll break his heart but that he's still
going to make himself vulnerable,
because if he didn't tiy, he'd never
forgive himself, and the potential
tragedy of the moment is more than
I can handle (author cry count:
three). I don't think I'm emotionally
mature enough to watch "The
Bachelorette." Final Score:
A++++++.
At the end of the day, she sent
home Ames, and nobody was sur
prised, but everyone was sad. The
poor guy looked like a puppy that's
been kicked: not mad, not even sad,
just... puzzled: it'll take a minute to
set in, he won't even attribute the

pain to his owner but he knows that
something just happened and that it
was terrible. When he left, he told her
that he was lucky to have met her
and smiled even as his eyes reddened.
There were tears in my eyes as I said
"Shut up, Ames" to the unresponsive
TV screen for the last time in my life
(author cry count: four). I'm going
to miss him.
