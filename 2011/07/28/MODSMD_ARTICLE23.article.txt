# BOOK REVIEW
## 'Dragons' world dazzles with realism 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
George R. R. Martin has been dubbed
the "American Tolkien." He's been on
every bestseller list out there. His first
book recently became the new HBO series
"Game of Thrones." And, of course, he's had
fans alternately salivating for and cursing every
missed deadline as they waited six long years
for "A Dance with Dragons."
He's that good.
"Dance" does not disappoint. It is the sister
book to "A Feast for Crows," featuring events
from parts of Martin's world left out of "Feast"
and some of the narrative thereafter. He seam
lessly shuttles readers between such locations as
The Wall in the north, which stands as a barrier
against Westeros's long winters and the other
worldly terrors such winters bring; the decadent

continental cities where a young queen survives
revolution by playing her suitors as deftly as did
Elizabeth I; and the Red Keep, the royal palace
where a child king's puppet masters attempt to
secure his throne against the many rival kings
that threaten to rend Westeros once more into
its ancient Seven Kingdoms. The politics are
Byzantine, the stakes enormous and the charac
ters liable to die in droves. Westeros is at war,
and Martin never lets us forget it.

Martin excels at realism; he writes the hor
rors of battle, disease and death as well as, if
not better than, he does pageantry and splen
dor. His characters are equally complex: there
are no heroes, no Dark Lords, no idealistic

teenagers who save the world. Some of his most

beloved characters include a dwarf who kills his father,
a knight who has sired children by his sister and a high
born tomboy who recites a list of the people she
intends to assassinate every night. By the same token,
he is ruthlessly true to his narrative when it comes to
killing off his characters, especially those beloved by
fans. In just about every book in the series, there is at
least one death that tears at readers' heartstrings, the
death of a character so sympathetic, so real that it kills
the reader to see him slain. (Yes, it happens in this one,
too.) And yet we can't help coming back for more.
It comes down to Martin's skill as a storyteller: like
Tolkien, he writes the history of the world he has creat
ed (one loosely analogous to Britain and the Continent
during the War of the Roses) in such away that readers
are invested in the lives of the characters they've known

for thousands of pages. Rather than naming him the
Tolkien of our country, we should perhaps call him the
Tolkien of our generation instead. Martin's "A Song of
Ice and Fire" is not a grand struggle of good and evil, of
valiant and shining knights against the massed forces of
darkness, of the English fighting the Germans in the
two World Wars that Tolkien knew. It is a murkier tale
of many sides fighting for land, for power and for their
own survival a story where little girls learn to kill,
queens sell their maidenhood to buy armies and even
the noblest and bravest of knights stain their hands and
souls with the blood of innocents.
Don't say we didn't warn you. Welcome to the
"Dance."
