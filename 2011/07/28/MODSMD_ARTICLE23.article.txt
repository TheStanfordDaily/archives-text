# BOOK REVIEW
## 'Dragons' world dazzles with realism 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
George R. R. Martin has been dubbed
the "American Tolkien." He's been on
every bestseller list out there. His first
book recently became the new HBO series
"Game of Thrones." And, of course, he's had
fans alternately salivating for and cursing every
missed deadline as they waited six long years
for "A Dance with Dragons."
He's that good.
"Dance" does not disappoint. It is the sister
book to "A Feast for Crows," featuring events
from parts of Martin's world left out of "Feast"
and some of the narrative thereafter. He seam
lessly shuttles readers between such locations as
The Wall in the north, which stands as a barrier
against Westeros's long winters and the other
worldly terrors such winters bring; the decadent

continental cities where a young queen survives
revolution by playing her suitors as deftly as did
Elizabeth I; and the Red Keep, the royal palace
where a child king's puppet masters attempt to
secure his throne against the many rival kings
that threaten to rend Westeros once more into
its ancient Seven Kingdoms. The politics are
Byzantine, the stakes enormous and the charac
ters liable to die in droves. Westeros is at war,
and Martin never lets us forget it.

Martin excels at realism; he writes the hor
rors of battle, disease and death as well as, if
not better than, he does pageantry and splen
dor. His characters are equally complex: there
are no heroes, no Dark Lords, no idealistic
