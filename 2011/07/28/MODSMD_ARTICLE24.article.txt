## 'LP1' a hit 
### â€” shawnee BAUGHMAN contact shawnee: shawneeb@stanford. edu 
Joss Stone exploded onto the
music scene in 2003, wowing
audiences with her sultry, soulful
vibrato and free-spirited melodies.

Her first album, "The Soul Sessions,"
went multi-platinum just as the

young singer neared 18. Since then,
she's lulled listeners with blues ballads
and rocked us with up-tempo tunes
harkening back to the Motown era.

In less than a decade, Stone has
released five records. It's been only
two years since the release of "Colour
Me Free!" but Stone's latest album
"LPI" 1 is not only a new chapter in
her recording career but the first on
her own record label, Stone'd
Records, in partner with Surfdog
Records.
Stone's previous albums rely on
a funkadelic baseline and soulful love
stories uninhibited by worry and
most heavily on the inspiration of
other artists. "The Soul Sessions" was
a compilation of covers of soul
singers that came before her
including Aretha Franklin ("All the
King's Horses") and the Isley
Brothers ("For the Love of You Pts. 1
& 2"). Since then, Stone has worked
hard to forge her own path in the
music industry. This new album not
only solidifies her place as a creative
and multi-talented artist but veers

away from the Motown mimicry
that some of her earlier singles relied
on.
"LPI" was recorded in six days
with the help of super-producer
Dave Stewart of Eurythmics fame in
Nashville, Tenn. The record is a
completely new sound that repre
sents a huge step on Stone's path to
establishing her own style. Rather
than use the bass-driven Motown
riffs that powered her old music, this
album is a piano-driven rock/blues
fusion that compliments Stone's
soulful voice.
Though the first single,
"Somehow," is yet another love story
from Stone, its redeeming qualities
come in the fact that it's a more per
sonal story and showcases Stone's
vocals while still retaining simplicity.
Though it was disappointing to hear
another romantic ode from her, she
makes up for it in the rest of the
album by incorporating new stories
into her work scorning love,
embracing life and declaring her own
strength. "Newborn" emphasizes the
rawness and power in Stone's voice
and is lyrically more mature than
some of her previous work. The

words are a testament to the fragility
of each day and remind us to savor
every moment while remembering
the time as it passes.

The track "Karma" is by far the "funkiest" of all the
songs on the new album, with that familiar funky bass,
but the new rock element of this song brings it to another
level. Stone is an absolute powerhouse in this song and
radiates strength in the scornful lyrics about a relation
ship's end. Similarly, in "Last One to Know" and
"Landlord," Stone declares that she is done with love,
done with taking care of someone else before herself.
The drawback of Stone's album comes in the
overuse of that free spirit she exudes so much. Some of

her lyrics try a little too hard to break away from love,
like in "Karma": "Come as your master and you're the
bitch." Some of the analogies border on tacky as well
"Don't wanna be your landlord anymore." But lyrical
nit-picking aside, "LPI" is an important step into new
territory for Stone. She lets loose vocally and shows the
world that she can thrive in a style that's all her own.
