## World Town brings party to SF

T (rough electronic dance music has
experienced a recent surge in
popularity—June's Electric Daisy
Carnival in Las Vegas reported some
85,000 attendees on one day alone, and
artists like Tiesto and David Guetta are
practically household names —this was
hardly the case just a few years back,

when local DJ Trevor Simpson was try
ing to get his foot in the door.
"About three and a half years ago, I
found myself in a place where even
though I pretty much considered myself
one of the biggest DJs in San Francisco, I
would just not have bookings," Simpson
explained. "And it was because the cli
mate of the house music scene was not
the way it is today. House music definite
ly wasn't the most popular music, and it
was kind of before there were hipsters
and before there was electro and dubstep
and all this cool stuff."
Around the same time, Simpson,
who was then the music director at the
now-defunct radio station Energy 92.7,
heard about M.I.A. from a record repre
sentative friend on the East Coast and
became "obsessed" with her "ground
breaking, different vibe." Simpson also
made multiple visits to his brother in
Brazil, opening him up to baile funk
music The genre, also popular with
Diplo, both a DJ and M.l.A.'s former
producer, quickly became incorporated
into the emerging hipster movement.
And so, from both his own career
goals and these external artistic influ
ences, World Town Inc. (or what he and
fiance Mariam Shojaee refer to as "The
Party") was bom.
"I started 'The Party' because I
wanted to have away that I could take
my brand and incorporate it with world
music and world cultures and still have it
be house music" Simpson said.
Inspired by M.I A's self-prepared
concert visuals —he still recalls the
African patterns and a hand playing
Congo drums on the beat from the first
M.IA concert that he attended—
Simpson's original concept for World

Town (incidentally, a name also drawn
from an M.I.A. song) was that the video
and VJ were just as important as the
music.
"The Party," anchored by DJ
Simpson as well as other hired talent,
would soon find a permanent home in
San Francisco venue Ruby Skye, where
initially World Town continued to incor
porate lots of visuals and live dancers
with the music. Before long, the World
Town party became Ruby Skye's largest
monthly event.
"We were really lucky to do that,"
he said of World Town's delicate rela
tionship with Ruby Skye. "And honestly,
it's because it was working and low bud
get We were local DJs, we hired some
dancers and for a couple thousand dol
lars, we were doing a Saturday night
main event party that was selling out."
Around this time, the music climate
began to change, with house music rising
in popularity. Having experienced early
success, the company was now able to
book bigger and bigger names.
Additionally, Simpson's radio relation
ships —he currently DJs a show called
"Clubbers' Commute" from 1:50 to 2:35
a.m on 99.7 and Bay Area ties helped
strengthen World Town's bookings even
more. His roommate from college grew
up in a commune-style home in Berkeley
along with Niles "Cyrano" Hollowell-
Dhar, who represents half of electro-hip
hop group The Cataracs, and was acting
as the duo's manager while living at
Simpson's home.

"We were around this energy of
amazing talent that was just growing with
The Party,'" Shojaee, who co-runs World
Town with Simpson, said. "This entire

party is part of a community that grew
together. It was this unique sound that
came out of Berkeley and San Francisco
that is influencing the world now, this
sound that nobody knew about or how
to produce. And it was very innocently
done —kids were working on it for
years, and as soon as music started
changing, everyone around us just made
it all at the same time."
"It's crazy to see, because only a
couple years ago, they were literally
crashing on couches," she added.
After moving to Los Angeles,
Simpson's former roommate called
Shojaee and him one day to discuss
the possibility of World Town book
ing a tour that The Cataracs were
doing along with Hyper Crush and
Far East Movement, a relative
unknown in March when the August
2010 show date was set at Ruby Skye.
"We thought, 'great' Hyper
Crush was really the only established
band on the bill" Simpson recalled.
"But then during that six-month peri
od, "G6" hit, and by the time we got to
the date of the tour, we were telling the
managers, Far East Movement has to
headline the show."
"After that point, it was less about

the audiovisual experience and more
about setting the trend by our book
ings," he added.
Following what he now calls the
"Far East Movement show," World
Town's success has continued to
snowball as they introduce new talent
to the Bay Area. The duo next brought
Dutch DJ Chuckie to Ruby Skye
his first show in the United States at
which Lil Jon made an unexpected
appearance followed by Afrojack in
his first San Francisco performance.
"To have the artists we've had
is craziness," Shejaee [SWljnoted.
"Because as soon as they left us, it's
impossible to get them back.
They're at the point where they're
in their own jets and they're flying
all over the world."
With electronic dance music now
infiltrating mainstream radio for
example, Afrojack produced radio
mainstay "Give Me Everything" while
Diplo produced Chris Brown's "Look
at Me Now" Simpson and Shojaee
hope to use the style's popularity to
continue educating the Bay Area pub
lic about up-and-coming artists while
fighting to maintain San Francisco's
role as a priority musical city.
"This entire [concept of] edu
cating people is so important,"
Shojaee said. "The main point of the
event is for these artists to come and
expose their music to the crowd
before they break or while they're
breaking and for San Francisco not
to lose those relationships with those
particular artists. We literally are
third when it comes to Vegas and
San Diego right now with the music

and these artists."
"At one point, Europeans espe
cially thought San Francisco was it,"
she added. "There was no other city
like it."
Of course, World Town faces
other difficulties as well the tens of
thousands of dollar fees that some DJs
demand, the criticism that they have
gotten "too big" and the somewhat
tainted rave image so often associated
with electronic music.
"After the scene of tutus and kids
overdosing on drugs, someone has to
clean up that image," Shojaee said.
"And it is this party and Ruby Skye
doing that."
"The thing is, raves or ravers,
there is a place for that, but this is not
it," Simpson added. "World Town is
also about expressing yourself,
embracing all different cultures, help
ing out charities and being a wild,
totally fun, let-your-hair-down party,
but not a rave. Never wanted to be,
never claimed to be, never will be."
But on Thursday, Aug. 4, Shojaee
and Simpson's years of toil will come
to fruition as they host one of the
artists who started it all: Diplo.
"It's so important," Shojaee said.
"One of the reasons we started 'The
Party' and work so hard to this day is
because we wanted Diplo and M.I.A.
to be part of the show."
"Diplo was part of the inspira
tion," Simpson added. "So it sort of
came completely full circle."
