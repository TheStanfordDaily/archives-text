T (rough electronic dance music has
experienced a recent surge in
popularity—June's Electric Daisy
Carnival in Las Vegas reported some
85,000 attendees on one day alone, and
artists like Tiesto and David Guetta are
practically household names —this was
hardly the case just a few years back,

when local DJ Trevor Simpson was try
ing to get his foot in the door.
"About three and a half years ago, I
found myself in a place where even
though I pretty much considered myself
one of the biggest DJs in San Francisco, I
would just not have bookings," Simpson
explained. "And it was because the cli
mate of the house music scene was not
the way it is today. House music definite
ly wasn't the most popular music, and it
was kind of before there were hipsters
and before there was electro and dubstep
and all this cool stuff."
Around the same time, Simpson,
who was then the music director at the
now-defunct radio station Energy 92.7,
heard about M.I.A. from a record repre
sentative friend on the East Coast and
became "obsessed" with her "ground
breaking, different vibe." Simpson also
made multiple visits to his brother in
Brazil, opening him up to baile funk
music The genre, also popular with
Diplo, both a DJ and M.l.A.'s former
producer, quickly became incorporated
into the emerging hipster movement.
And so, from both his own career
goals and these external artistic influ
ences, World Town Inc. (or what he and
fiance Mariam Shojaee refer to as "The
Party") was bom.
"I started 'The Party' because I
wanted to have away that I could take
my brand and incorporate it with world
music and world cultures and still have it
be house music" Simpson said.
Inspired by M.I A's self-prepared
concert visuals —he still recalls the
African patterns and a hand playing
Congo drums on the beat from the first
M.IA concert that he attended—
Simpson's original concept for World

Town (incidentally, a name also drawn
from an M.I.A. song) was that the video
and VJ were just as important as the
music.
"The Party," anchored by DJ
Simpson as well as other hired talent,
would soon find a permanent home in
San Francisco venue Ruby Skye, where
initially World Town continued to incor
porate lots of visuals and live dancers
with the music. Before long, the World
Town party became Ruby Skye's largest
monthly event.
"We were really lucky to do that,"
he said of World Town's delicate rela
tionship with Ruby Skye. "And honestly,
it's because it was working and low bud
get We were local DJs, we hired some
dancers and for a couple thousand dol
lars, we were doing a Saturday night
main event party that was selling out."
Around this time, the music climate
began to change, with house music rising
in popularity. Having experienced early
success, the company was now able to
book bigger and bigger names.
Additionally, Simpson's radio relation
ships —he currently DJs a show called
"Clubbers' Commute" from 1:50 to 2:35
a.m on 99.7 and Bay Area ties helped
strengthen World Town's bookings even
more. His roommate from college grew
up in a commune-style home in Berkeley
along with Niles "Cyrano" Hollowell-
Dhar, who represents half of electro-hip
hop group The Cataracs, and was acting
as the duo's manager while living at
Simpson's home.

"We were around this energy of
amazing talent that was just growing with
The Party,'" Shojaee, who co-runs World
Town with Simpson, said. "This entire
