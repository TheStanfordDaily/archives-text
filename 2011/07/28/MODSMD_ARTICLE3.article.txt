## Cantor receives 235-ton Serra sculpture on loan 
### ABHA SHARMA INTERN 
The Cantor Arts Center recently re
ceived on loan from the Fisher Foundation a
235-ton sheet-metal sculpture entitled "Se
quence." The piece, by American minimal
ist sculptor Richard Serra, was installed last
week.

"Sequence" is 67 feet long, 42 feet wide
and 13 feet tall. The museum had previous
ly displayed another of Serra's sculptures
entitled "Call Me Ishmael," which had also
been loaned by the Fisher Foundation.

Considered one of Serra's most distin
guished works, "Sequence" was made out of
solid steel in 2006. Before coming to Stan
ford, it had been showcased at the Los An
geles County Museum of Art and at the
New York Museum of Modern Art. How
ever, this is the first time that visitors will be
able to view the sculpture outdoors.

Cantor Arts Center director Thomas
Seligman expressed positive feelings about
Stanford's opportunity to showcase this
work.

"What Richard Serra does he creates
space that has never been created before,"
Seligman said. "He creates sculptures that
are made from very obvious material, it's
about two-inch-thick steel. So you can see
exactly what it is, but when you get into this
space, you feel strange sometimes. He cre
ates vertigo, he creates these canyon-like
spaces, and what's wonderful here
is the shadow patterns, because it's
the first time that it's been seen out
doors."

A vast majority of the costs of
installing, maintaining and dis
playing the sculpture are being
paid for by the Fisher Foundation.
Officials declined to disclose exact
financial numbers but hinted that
bringing the sculpture to the muse
um has been quite expensive. Re
gardless, Seligman cited the ancil
lary benefits of exposing an audi
ence that would have otherwise
been unable to enjoy the sculp
ture's beauty and architectural de
sign.

"You can think of the engineers
here [at Stanford] and you could
think of people who are involved
in design and architecture; it's not
just for people who are interested
in the arts," he said. "How it's
made there's apparently two
places in the world who can do this
kind of steel work."

"Sequence" will also be instru
mental in teaching art at the Uni
versity and in the community, ac
cording to Patience Young, curator
for education at the museum.

She highlighted "the beauty of
having something of this magni
tude by somebody who is well doc
umented, who has a career of ac

complishment, of controversy a
work by Richard Serra was the sub
ject of a major lawsuit concerning
art, I think in the 1980s and
somebody who has gone through
the ringer with issues of authorship
and of intention is right for studying
and discussion."

Serra cited the piece as a vessel
for instigating different emotions in
different people, as it doesn't have
one concrete meaning.

In an interview with The New
Yorker, Serra said that his sculp
ture evokes a variety of feelings.

"Whatever the work is evoking
in people, I don't dictate that, so I
don't know how to account for it,"
he said of the piece.

The museum also has one of
Serra's drawings in its collection. It
will be displaying "Sequence" until
2016, when it will then be moved to
the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, in line with that muse
um's estimated completion date for
its expansion.
