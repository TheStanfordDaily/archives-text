### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ellora Israni 
The undergraduate matriculation rate
for the class of 2015 is 70.5 percent re
flecting acceptances from 1,717 of 2,436
admitted students according to Direc
tor of Undergraduate Admission Bob Pat
terson.

The number reflects a slight decrease
from the last year's 71.5 percent matricula
tion rate but a slight jump from 2009's 69.8
percent. The University also admitted 96
more undergraduate students than it did in
2010, but only 10 more than 2009.
"We are very proud to have a strong
matriculation rate at Stanford," Patterson
wrote in an email to The Daily. "When stu
dents receive their admit letter from Dean
Shaw, they generally want to attend. It is
our responsibility to present clear, accu
rate and truthful information to admitted
students so that they can make an in
formed and thoughtful decision."
According to Patterson, the of
fice was expecting a yield of 70 per
cent.

The University placed approxi
mately 1,000 students on the wait list
this year, 800 of whom accepted
their places on the list. Of those, 13
were offered admission and 12 ac
cepted, reflecting a 92 percent ma
triculation rate for students accept-

Ed off the wait list.
Stanford employs a Restrictive
Early Action process as well as a
Regular Decision cycle. The for
mer group must apply by Nov. 1
and is notified of a decision by Dec.
15, while the latter applies by Jan. 1
and hears back by April 1; the
deadline for both groups to notify
the University of their decisions is
May 1.
Early applicants make up 40 per
cent of the class of 2015 and reflect a
yield of approximately 80 percent.
Regular decision applicants had a
yield of 63 percent.
