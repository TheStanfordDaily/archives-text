## Binge drinking hurts girls more, study says 
### HAELIN CHO INTERN 
A study on teenagers has shown that binge
drinking in this age group negatively affects
girls more than it does boys, especially in tests
on working spatial memory.
The study is a joint endeavor between UC-
San Diego and Stanford. It included 95
teenagers ranging in age from 16 to 19, 40 of
whom were binge drinkers, and defined
''binge drinking" as four or more drinks for a

girl or five or more drinks for a boy.
The adolescents were given a series of spa
tial working memory tests, which they per
formed in a functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) machine so researchers
could examine the cognitive effects of the
binge drinking on the brain. Spatial working
memory, UC-San Diego graduate student
and lead author Lindsay Squeglia explained,
is the ability to remember "where things are in
space around you."
UC-San Diego psychiatry profes
sor and co-author Susan Tapert said
that the tests the students performed
were similar to IQ tests, citing atten
tion-testing tasks like crossing out a
specified letter, a "visual construc
tional task" that involves redrawing
a given picture, a puzzle-like task
where adolescents would recreate a
design shown in a picture with blocks
and a "working memory test which
examines your ability to manipulate
information that you hold in your
mind."

Tapert added that the adolescents
were purposefully examined after

the initial effects of alcohol disap
peared, giving them around three or
more days to recuperate.
"What we found was that the kids
who were binge drinking have less
brain activation when they were
doing a spatial working memory
test," Squeglia said. The effect was
strongest for the female binge
drinkers, so female binge drinkers
did much worse than female controls
and then for male binge drinkers,
they did worse, but it wasn't as strong
of an effect for males."
Despite the gender discrepancy
found by the study, Squeglia said that
the results of the study are not unex
pected.
"It didn't [surprise me] actually,
because some of the adult literature
has shown alcohol more negatively
affects females, and so we purpose
fully were trying to look at the gen

der in this study to see if that was the
same case for adolescent females,"
she said.
Squeglia said the difference is cor
related with the difference in the
male and female brains during ado
lescence, in that different hormones
affect them.
She also mentioned that there is a
difference in the "acute effects" of
drinking, explaining that more typi
cally female characteristics like
lower body weight, slower metabo
lism and higher body fat content
make them more vulnerable to alco
hol.

Both Squeglia and Tapert noted
that the recently published study is
"cross-sectional" in that it examines
the students in just one moment of
their lives. However, both also added
that longitudinal data that followed
the studied adolescents over time

was being used to make sure that the
effects found on both the male and
female binge drinkers was a conse
quence of the alcohol itself.

"The same kids who were in this
study, we're following over time to
see if increases in drinking follows
with a greater degree of these abnor
malities, and the flip side of that is to
see if the kids who stopped drinking
show improvements in these abnor
malities," Tapert said.
Squeglia added that the study is in
its eighth year.
According to Tapert, the study
did have its challenges. She ex
plained that they had to be careful
with the selection of subjects.
"You can't put somebody who
had braces in the MRI, and a lot of
young people have braces," she said.
"There's also a lot of young people
who binge drink who also use a lot of

other drugs, and we couldn't really
include them in this study since we're
really trying to just look at the effects
of binge drinking in this particular
study."
Squeglia said that she hopes that
exposure to the results of the study
will discourage teenage binge drink
ing. She added that parents should
talk to their kids about drinking in
stead of drinking with them to "teach
them how to drink."
"The study that Lindsay
[Squeglia] did here is larger than
most published fMRI studies, so the
results are fairly robust, and I think it
gives us a reason to be concerned for
teenage girls who are drinking four
or more drinks in an occasion," Ta
pert said.
