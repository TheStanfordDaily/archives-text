## Study identifies lesion-shrinking protein in brain Substance could reduce damage after strokes 
### JENNY THAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine published a
study earlier this week in the Pro
ceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences that revealed alpha-B
crystallin, a naturally occurring
protein, significantly shrank the
size of stroke-induced lesions in
the brains of laboratory mice and
mitigated the destructiveness of
the inflammatory response that
follows the stroke.

The study, conducted by Dr.
Gary Steinberg PhD. '79 M.D. 'BO,
director of Stanford's Institute for
Neuro-Innovation and Transla
tional Neurosciences and neurolo
gy professor Dr. Lawrence Stein
man, is a follow-up on an earlier
study published in Nature in 2007
that showed how alpha-B-crys
tallin reduces brain damage
caused by multiple sclerosis, a
chronic autoimmune brain dis
ease.

Alpha-B-crystallin is an impor
tant structural protein found in the
eye's lens. It is regularly produced
in the heart. When other tissues
undergo stress for example,
when a stroke deprives the brain
of oxygen this triggers alpha-B
crystallin production, the body's
natural defense to limit the inflam
matory activity.

"The brain, when it's injured,
doesn't roll over and play dead,"
Steinman said. "It fights back by
producing protective molecules;
one of those molecules is alpha-B
crystallin. Since we've seen how
the presence of alpha-B-crystallin
plays an active role in the brain's
healing response to a stroke, we
wanted to see if administering
more of it could increase its ef
fect."
