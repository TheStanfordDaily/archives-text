## Study identifies lesion-shrinking protein in brain Substance could reduce damage after strokes 
### JENNY THAI SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine published a
study earlier this week in the Pro
ceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences that revealed alpha-B
crystallin, a naturally occurring
protein, significantly shrank the
size of stroke-induced lesions in
the brains of laboratory mice and
mitigated the destructiveness of
the inflammatory response that
follows the stroke.

The study, conducted by Dr.
Gary Steinberg PhD. '79 M.D. 'BO,
director of Stanford's Institute for
Neuro-Innovation and Transla
tional Neurosciences and neurolo
gy professor Dr. Lawrence Stein
man, is a follow-up on an earlier
study published in Nature in 2007
that showed how alpha-B-crys
tallin reduces brain damage
caused by multiple sclerosis, a
chronic autoimmune brain dis
ease.

Alpha-B-crystallin is an impor
tant structural protein found in the
eye's lens. It is regularly produced
in the heart. When other tissues
undergo stress for example,
when a stroke deprives the brain
of oxygen this triggers alpha-B
crystallin production, the body's
natural defense to limit the inflam
matory activity.

"The brain, when it's injured,
doesn't roll over and play dead,"
Steinman said. "It fights back by
producing protective molecules;
one of those molecules is alpha-B
crystallin. Since we've seen how
the presence of alpha-B-crystallin
plays an active role in the brain's
healing response to a stroke, we
wanted to see if administering
more of it could increase its ef
fect."

Senior authors Steinberg and
Steinman, along with postdoctoral
scholar Ahmet Arac and Sara
Brownwell M.A. 'll Ph.D. 'l3, em
ployed knockouts mice bioengi
neered to lack the ability to pro
duce alpha-b-crystallin to inves
tigate the level of efficacy the pro
tein has in reducing stroke lesions.
"We temporarily blocked off
one of the arteries," Steinberg said.
"We do it by opening the carotid
artery, inserting a thread that's
about the size of the artery and
temporarily block the blood flow to
induce a stroke."

There were two groups of mice:
the knockouts and the wild types,
mice that contained the gene to
produce alpha-B-crystallin.
After inducing the strokes, the
mice from both groups were moni
tored for up to a week, their recov
ery time measured with the use of a
neurologic scale, which ranges
from zero to 28. Zero is a full recov
ery and 28 is the lowest level of
neurologic functioning.
"For seven categories, we score
them from zero to four," Steinberg
said. "We test for lots of things. We
test for body symmetry —is it
asymmetric in that it's favoring one
side more than the other? We test
for its gait see if there's any
limping or staggering. We measure
their ability to climb 45 degrees and
also test circling behavior

whether or not it's swaying and
whisker response."

Twelve hours after the stroke,
the wild types scored around 12
while the knockouts were at 14.
The results, according to Steinberg,
were not statistically significant.
However, seven days later, the wild
types scored around four while the
knockouts scored around eight, a
statistically significant difference

that sheds light on the body's nat
ural recovery.

"The stroke evolves, but neuro
logic function actually improves,"
Steinberg said. "This is because
there's some natural recovery the
body performs. In this case, the
wild types recovered quicker than
the knockouts."

The study presents a promising
start to finding a drug that will
treat not only the stroke but the
post-stress inflammatory re
sponse. TPA, the current govern
ment-approved stroke drug, is lim
ited in its effectiveness in that
while it breaks up clots, it does not
treat the inflammatory aftershock
caused by dead tissue and toxins.

There is still much work to be

done including further investiga
tion into the efficacy and safety of
alpha-B-crystallin administration
before the protein can eventually
be brought into clinical trials.
"We'd like to have [the experi
ment] reproduced and verified,"
Steinberg said. "Some other ques
tions we want to look at are
whether or not there's benefit
from the protein after 24 hours as
well as figuring out the level of
dosage necessary to achieve effi
cacy. You'd be surprised how
many therapeutic treatments,
while successful in the lab, may
not be successful in clinical trials."
