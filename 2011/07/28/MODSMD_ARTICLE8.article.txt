Berkeley law professor Goodwin
Liu '9l has been nominated to the
California Supreme Court to re
place outgoing Justice Carlos
Moreno, who announced his plans
to retire earlier this year.
Several months ago, President
Barack Obama nominated him to
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals. He eventually withdrew his
candidacy after several Republicans
objected to his written positions and
called him "inexperienced."
Liu's confirmation hearing in
front of the state Commission on Ju
dicial Appointments is set for Aug.
31 in San Francisco. If his nomina
tion is approved, Liu will join Chief
Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye and As
sociate Justices Ming Chin and
Joyce Kennard to form the state's
first Asian-American majority
Supreme Court.
