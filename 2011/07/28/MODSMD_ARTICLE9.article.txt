# San Mateo County to hold hearings on trails
## 
### â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
After twice rejecting Stanford's
bid to build a path connecting Menlo
Park and Portola Valley trail sys
tems, San Mateo County will at
tempt to gauge public opinion on the
issue in the coming months. The trail
project is part of the University's ef
forts to meet the terms of its General

Use Permit agreement with Santa
Clara County, which allows Stanford
to construct five million square feet
of buildings over a 10-year period.
The proposed bicycle and pedes
trian path would replace the current
trail along Alpine Road, connecting
Menlo Park at Santa Cruz Avenue
and Junipero Serra Boulevard with
Portola Valley's own portion of the
path. Stanford also funds construc
tion on that section under this deal.

Public response at Tuesday's
meeting was mixed. While some res
idents called for the county to take
advantage of Stanford's offer to fix
what they said was an unsafe trail,
others expressed concern that the
trail would increase traffic to a dan
gerous level.
As part of the agreement, the Uni
versity is required to offer the $lO mil
lion dollar deal through the end of the
year, although it has said it would be
willing to extend the deadline to 2013.
Should San Mateo County reject the
deal, the money would go to Santa
Clara County.
