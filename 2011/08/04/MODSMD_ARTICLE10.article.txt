# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## One Dragon, Two Dragon, Red Dragon, Blue Dragon

When you think of a mythological beast,
it is almost inevitable that your mind
will wander to the serpentine form and
the chilly scales of the dragon. Dragons have
long been portrayed in the West as ruthless and
evil creatures from the Earth, often referred to
as the personification of Satan himself.
Lewis Carroll's fearsome Jabberwocky is
described as having "jaws that bite," "claws
that catch" and "eyes of flame" in his poem
"The Jabberwocky." J.R.R. Tolkein's Smaug
from "The Hobbit" is a loathsome monster,
symbolizing greed as he guards his expansive,
treasure-filled cave. Eustace Scrubb from C.S.
Lewis's "The Voyage of the Dawn Treader" is
magically turned into a dragon for his misbe
havior, and everyone trembles at the thought of
the Hungarian Horntail that Harry so bravely
defeats in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire." Throughout the tapestry of storytelling,
courageous knights have boldly turned up at
the dens of dragons, demanding the release of
fair maidens (who all seem to coincidentally be
single). Confrontations with dragons have al
ways tested the worthiness of heroes.
But in Asian folklore and mythology, the
dragon rises far above evil and malice. The
dragon is a sign from the gods, a benevolent
spirit who advises those in the darkest of times
and lost in the darkest of places. Dragons pull
the chariots of the gods, control the winds and
waters and guard treasure underneath the
Earth's surface. A volcanic eruption is an awe
some event â€”it means that an underworld
dragon (a fucanglong ) has surged forth from
the realms below to report to the gods in the
sky. Underworld dragons look wizened and
old; they are sages that rule the natural world.
They are full to bursting with magical powers,
but they have full control over how and when
these powers are used. They are truly amazing
creatures, and it is almost impossible to believe
they are the cousins of the Western malevolent
and carnivorous brutes that attack villages and
eat poor damsels.
The dragon is also one of the 12 signs of the
Chinese zodiac. If you are a dragon, you are
bold and ambitious, willing to take risks and
very passionate. To be born in the year of the
dragon is an auspicious occurrence and surely
worthy of honor, and as such, many Chinese
parents will try to have "children of the dragon."
As a symbol of ethnic identity, the Chinese con
sider themselves long de chuan ren ("descen
dents of the dragon"). To wang zi cheng long
("hope one's child turns into a dragon") actual
ly means to hope that your child grows up to

lead an auspicious and prestigious life. Chinese
parents proudly name their child xiao long ("lit
tle dragon"), whereas the nickname "dragon" is
more appropriate in the West for a mother in
law. In Germany, gifts to appease one's wife
after a late night out with the guys are known as
drachenfutter (literally "dragon-fodder").
The Chinese dragon and the Western drag
on are clearly different in their ambitions and
folkloric representation. However, they have
something striking in common they are both
symbols of the natural world. The Western
dragon, a cave-dwelling, monstrous beast, is
born from the metals and fire of the deep Earth,
whereas the Chinese dragon is the harbinger of
wind and water. Thus, the treatment of dragons
in their respective mythological stories is an in
dication of how each respective culture views
the natural world.

Compare the classic bloody tales of dragons
in the West to this well-known story from
China:

Long ago, there were four dragons that lived
in the Eastern Sea. The land was suffering from
a drought and people were starving, so the four
dragons begged the Jade Emperor (the ruler of
Heaven, Hell and the realm of man) to send
down rain to save the people. The Jade Emper
or, preoccupied with the pleasures of court life,
promised emptily to do so. After 10 days of still
no rain, the dragons decided to take matters into
their own claws. They took water from the East
ern Sea, held it in their mouths and flew over the
land, spraying everything with water and thus
saving the people from mass starvation. The
Jade Emperor, furious that the dragons had
brought rain without his permission, ordered
them to be crushed and trapped beneath four
large mountains. The dragons did not regret
their actions, so they created a kingdom out of
which flowed four rivers that would forever
bring water to the people. According to folk
lore, these are the four rivers of China the
Heilongjiang (the Amur River, directly translat
ed as "black dragon river"), the Huanghe (the
Yellow River), the Changjiang (the Yangtze
River) and the Zhujiang (the Pearl River).
In Western folklore, if a dragon flew over a
village like that, he would not be bringing water
he would be bringing death and destruction.
Dragons in Western mythology were forces

of nature that needed to be over
come for goodness and harmony to
reign. They destroyed crops, ruined
lives and obliterated villages with
one fiery roar. They needed to be
defeated for man to reign supreme.

They were foes to man, foes that
needed to be slaughtered. In many
cases, this was how natural land was
also perceived. A lush landscape
was there for man to conquer. That
which was uncultivated was a wild
and dangerous enemy capable of
killing a man with its inhabitants
and sheer forces of nature.

On the other hand, Emperors
sought advice from the all-knowing
and ever-wise Eastern dragons and

wore robes delicately yet profound
ly embroidered with dragons a
symbol of power and eminence. Ac
cording to the legend, dragons pre
vented mass starvation and saved
hundreds of people. Their self-sacri
fice was forever carved into the land
in the form of life-giving rivers so
that the myth would be passed down
generation to generation. The envi
ronmental view that arises from this
concept is not one of antagonism

but one of gratitude and recognition
of human dependence on nature.
Strands of this concept persist
today; dragons primarily controlled
the winds and water, and the con
cept of fengshui (literally "wind
water") is a central part of Chinese
life that advises how one can attain
harmony with the surrounding envi
ronment.

While the dragons of the West
breathe fire, the dragons of the East

bring wind and water. Legendary
cousins, they represent two diver
gent views of the natural world. Yet
at the same time, just like fire and
water, the two views interact in a
perfect yin-yang balance that seems
to define the very interaction of East
and West.
