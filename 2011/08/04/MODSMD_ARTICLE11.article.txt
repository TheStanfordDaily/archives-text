## University Press launches online e-book rental service Model draws on success of bookstores rentals 
### MICHAEL TUSCHMAN INTERN 
Following in the footsteps of
several successful textbook-rental
programs, Stanford University
Press is now launching a similar
rental program with its online e
book service.
While a full license to an e
book from the University Press is
the same price as the paperback
edition, students can rent e-books
for a 14-day period for a fourth of
the cost of the full license or for 60
days for 50 percent of the cost of
the original. Physical textbook
rentals have become a significant
part of sales for the Stanford
Bookstore as well as university
bookstores across the country;
however, e-book rentals have not
seen the same financial success.

Janet Gawley, director of the
Stanford Bookstore, said she does
not believe the e-book-rental ser
vice has had a significant effect on
the bookstore's physical rental
service, which has continued to
grow.

"We experienced tremendous
success with our text-rental pro
gram last year," she said. "Stu
dents rented approximately five
percent of their textbooks from
the bookstore last year. The im
pact of the Stanford University
Press e-book rental is minimal, as
not many titles from the Stanford
University Press are adopted as re
quired textbooks."
While the digital nature of e
book rentals does not lend itself to
specific data collection, Alan Har
vey, deputy director of Stanford
University Press, believes there is
a growing market for University
Press e-book rentals.

"We've got a pretty even split
between the number of books
being bought permanently, and
the number being bought for 60
days and the number being bought
for 14 days," Harvey said. "It's
fairly evenly divided between the
three. That tells me that there are
markets for each of them."

"My belief about who is buying
the rental periods is that it's some

one working on a particular pro
ject and needs a section of a
book," he said. "And that could be
a student who is doing a paper or a
professor who is doing a research
project. It could be an individual
who just wants to read a portion of
a book."
The Stanford Bookstore re
cently starting offering
Cafe Scribe, a web-based e-book
platform with prices 40 to 60 per
cent lower than physical textbook
rentals.
"The benefit of the Cafe Scribe
platform is the ability to access
your book either online or of
fline," Gawley said. "Some titles
within the Cafe Scribe database
are currently rentable."
In addition to e-book rentals,
Stanford University Press pro
vides electronic access to print
books purchased online and
shipped to the consumer.
"If you buy a book from our
website, a print book, you get 14-
day access to that print book as an
e-book for free," Harvey said.
"The incentive there being you
would buy books from our website
over somewhere like Amazon be
cause while it will take time for
both of us to ship it to you, you'll
be able to begin reading it online
from the moment you buy it."
While Harvey noted that the
University Press does not specifi
cally cater to student textbooks,
other university presses have
made strides in making e-text
books available to students.

"Our goal is to get the book
into the hands of the students in
some way that meets their needs,"
Karen Hill, associate director of
the Michigan Press, told Inside
Higher Ed.
Harvey said Stanford Universi
ty Press has taken a different ap
proach.
"For us, we're really just rent
ing books to anyone who wants to
rent them," he said. "We do it for
every book that we publish, re
gardless of whether it's a textbook
or a monograph or a reference
book."

"It's really just one of the side ben
efits that it can be used for text
books for students," he added.
