## STANFORD FOOTBALL POSITION PREVIEW 2011 SECONDARY LOOKS TO KEEP UP PROGRESS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SPORTS EDITOR 
It put an explosive finishing
touch on one of Stanford's best de
fensive performances in recent
memory. It marked the start of a
season that would nearly double
the number of turnovers that went
in Stanford's favor. It demonstrat
ed definitively that the Cardinal
secondary would be a force to be
reckoned with.

And it almost didn't happen.
After the Cardinal went up 21-
0 against UCLA in the waning mo
ments of the third quarter last Sep
tember, junior free safety Michael
Thomas wasn't ready when Bruin
quarterback Kevin Prince took
the field.

"It was the first play of the se
ries, so honestly, I wasn't even
strapped up and ready to play,"
Thomas remembered. "As soon
as the play happened, I was run
ning out and just trying to get a hit
on the quarterback even though I
wasn't strapped up ... I realized
the quarterback had the ball and
the defensive linemen were com
ing up to tackle him. He wasn't
turning his feet, and he was giving
up ground."
Thomas thought back to the
work the secondary had done with
new defensive backs coach Derek
Mason in training camp. When
Prince bobbled the snap, Thomas
already having forced a fumble
on the night didn't give him any
time to regroup.

"That was something we had
been practicing all camp long, get
ting strip attempts on offensive
players when they weren't paying
attention, and I saw an opportuni
ty right there," he said. "We had
just talked about it that week. The
first thing that was going through
my mind when I stripped the ball
was, 'Please do not get caught.'"
Twenty-one yards later he was

in the end zone, putting a dramat
ic flair on a 35-0 shutout win in
Pasadena that included two inter
ceptions and two fumble recover
ies for Stanford. The Cardinal
would go on to force 30 turnovers
last season, jumping to 12th in Di
vision I after ranking 99th in the
category with 17 in 2009. The sec
ondary alone forced seven fum
bles, up from three the year be
fore. And with three of four start
ing defensive backs returning this
season, things are looking up for a
secondary that is possibly Stan
ford's most experienced unit on
the field.

Just as with the front seven, the
Cardinal's revitalization in the sec
ondary was sparked in part by a
new member of the coaching staff.

"When Derek Mason took on
the secondary, he basically restart
ed from ground zero in terms of
the basics of defense and how to
play the position of defensive
back," Thomas said. "Instead of in
2009, when it was [cornerback
Richard] Sherman's first year
playing defense, it was [strong
safety] Delano Howell's first year
starting, and I wasn't even in a
starting role yet... the chemistry
was just there. It showed out on

the field the way we play togeth
er."

It certainly did, with Stanford's
pass defense improving by over 60
yards per game and forcing more
interceptions (18) than any Cardi
nal team in the last 15 years. Rising
seniors Thomas, Howell and cor
nerback Johnson Bademosi have
gotten used to playing together in
their combined 47 career starts.

"The great thing about our
team is that we mesh really well,"
Howell said. "We've got good re
lationships on and off the field, so
we have confidence when we get
on the field. Our leadership is

something that we have confi
dence in, and I feel like we're
going to take advantage of our sit
uation. In game situations, having
a composed and mature group is
important."
The secondary does lose its
most experienced player on paper,
Sherman, who made 37 starts over
five years. But over half of his time
on the Farm was spent on the of
fensive side of the ball, before the
flashy receiver made the transition
to cornerback leading up to his
redshirt junior season.
"Shoot, Sherman was just an
athlete," Flowell said. "When you
gave him the football, he just knew
how to play ball, whether you put
him on offense or defense. It's
kind of amazing how quickly he
was able to transition without hav
ing played the position before."
"He was phenomenal in his
confidence and his willingness to
learn. I mean, you don't really see
that too much in many athletes, es
pecially at this level, but he did
something that's really hard to
do," Howell added.

Sherman was hardly the only
Stanford player to move to sec
ondary from the offensive side of
the ball over the past few seasons.
Howell himself made the switch
after playing running back his
freshman year; Thomas, recruited
as a speedy quarterback out of
high school, became a safety dur
ing his first training camp.
And the Cardinal was at it
again this spring, converting an
other talented player out of the
backfield into a defensive back.
With all five members of Stan
ford's generally young running
back tandem returning, Usua
Amanam was switched to corner
back after playing in 11 games as a
redshirt freshman in 2010.
Thomas speaks highly of his

still sees his fair share of the ball. He forced four turnovers last year and had a touchdown on a fumble return.
teammates that have played on both
sides of the ball at the college level.
"Those guys are like animals," he
said of Howell and Amanam. "It's
kind of natural for them. It's the
same foundation you go through,
out there trying to make somebody
miss."
But while Sherman and Howell
were thrust into starting roles imme
diately due to deep holes in the sec
ondary, the coaching staff likely con
verted Amanam in anticipation of
the departure of all three senior de
fensive backs following this season.
He may see light action this year at
right cornerback behind Bademosi.
Instead, the open left cornerback
spot is expected to be filled by rising
sophomore Barry Browning, who
saw action in all 13 games last sea
son.

"He is athletically incredible, but
[we're also impressed by] his atti
tude, his confidence and his willing
ness to constantly get better," How
ell said. "He's got high expectations
for himself, and the thing about him
is that he's very good at keeping a

level head. He realizes that there's a
lot of growth that's needed in terms
of where he wants to go."
"He's faster than anyone I've
played with in a long time, other
than [senior wide receiver] Chris
Owusu," Thomas remarked.

Despite the Cardinal's experi
ence in the secondary, the defen
sive backs will have their fair share
of tough tests in the year to come.
Five Pac-12 quarterbacks were
named to the Davey O'Brien watch
list for the best passer in the country
earlier this summer, and Stanford
will face three of them: Oregon's
Darron Thomas, USC's Matt
Barkley and Arizona's Nick Foles.
All three passers threw over 230
yards against the Cardinal last year,
with Barkley going for 390 in a close
Stanford win.

Adjustments need to be made on
a week-by-week basis due to these
quarterbacks' varied styles.
"It's cliche, but we take every
thing one game at a time," Thomas
said. "Each quarterback is different.
You get Darron Thomas, he's going
to be a running quarterback ... it's a
full-team effort, everyone is putting
their all into it, just trying to make
sure we do our job to stop them."

MICHAEL THOMAS
senior free safety
It put an explosive finishing
touch on one of Stanford's best de
fensive performances in recent
memory. It marked the start of a
season that would nearly double
the number of turnovers that went
in Stanford's favor. It demonstrat
ed definitively that the Cardinal
secondary would be a force to be
reckoned with.

And it almost didn't happen.
After the Cardinal went up 21-
0 against UCLA in the waning mo
ments of the third quarter last Sep
tember, junior free safety Michael
Thomas wasn't ready when Bruin
quarterback Kevin Prince took
the field.

"It was the first play of the se
ries, so honestly, I wasn't even
strapped up and ready to play,"
Thomas remembered. "As soon
as the play happened, I was run
ning out and just trying to get a hit
on the quarterback even though I
wasn't strapped up ... I realized
the quarterback had the ball and
the defensive linemen were com
ing up to tackle him. He wasn't
turning his feet, and he was giving
up ground."
Thomas thought back to the
work the secondary had done with
new defensive backs coach Derek
Mason in training camp. When
Prince bobbled the snap, Thomas
already having forced a fumble
on the night didn't give him any
time to regroup.

"That was something we had
been practicing all camp long, get
ting strip attempts on offensive
players when they weren't paying
attention, and I saw an opportuni
ty right there," he said. "We had
just talked about it that week. The
first thing that was going through
my mind when I stripped the ball
was, 'Please do not get caught.'"
Twenty-one yards later he was

in the end zone, putting a dramat
ic flair on a 35-0 shutout win in
Pasadena that included two inter
ceptions and two fumble recover
ies for Stanford. The Cardinal
would go on to force 30 turnovers
last season, jumping to 12th in Di
vision I after ranking 99th in the
category with 17 in 2009. The sec
ondary alone forced seven fum
bles, up from three the year be
fore. And with three of four start
ing defensive backs returning this
season, things are looking up for a
secondary that is possibly Stan
ford's most experienced unit on
the field.

Just as with the front seven, the
Cardinal's revitalization in the sec
ondary was sparked in part by a
new member of the coaching staff.

"When Derek Mason took on
the secondary, he basically restart
ed from ground zero in terms of
the basics of defense and how to
play the position of defensive
back," Thomas said. "Instead of in
2009, when it was [cornerback
Richard] Sherman's first year
playing defense, it was [strong
safety] Delano Howell's first year
starting, and I wasn't even in a
starting role yet... the chemistry
was just there. It showed out on

the field the way we play togeth
er."

It certainly did, with Stanford's
pass defense improving by over 60
yards per game and forcing more
interceptions (18) than any Cardi
nal team in the last 15 years. Rising
seniors Thomas, Howell and cor
nerback Johnson Bademosi have
gotten used to playing together in
their combined 47 career starts.

"The great thing about our
team is that we mesh really well,"
Howell said. "We've got good re
lationships on and off the field, so
we have confidence when we get
on the field. Our leadership is

something that we have confi
dence in, and I feel like we're
going to take advantage of our sit
uation. In game situations, having
a composed and mature group is
important."
The secondary does lose its
most experienced player on paper,
Sherman, who made 37 starts over
five years. But over half of his time
on the Farm was spent on the of
fensive side of the ball, before the
flashy receiver made the transition
to cornerback leading up to his
redshirt junior season.
"Shoot, Sherman was just an
athlete," Flowell said. "When you
gave him the football, he just knew
how to play ball, whether you put
him on offense or defense. It's
kind of amazing how quickly he
was able to transition without hav
ing played the position before."
"He was phenomenal in his
confidence and his willingness to
learn. I mean, you don't really see
that too much in many athletes, es
pecially at this level, but he did
something that's really hard to
do," Howell added.

Sherman was hardly the only
Stanford player to move to sec
ondary from the offensive side of
the ball over the past few seasons.
Howell himself made the switch
after playing running back his
freshman year; Thomas, recruited
as a speedy quarterback out of
high school, became a safety dur
ing his first training camp.
And the Cardinal was at it
again this spring, converting an
other talented player out of the
backfield into a defensive back.
With all five members of Stan
ford's generally young running
back tandem returning, Usua
Amanam was switched to corner
back after playing in 11 games as a
redshirt freshman in 2010.
Thomas speaks highly of his

still sees his fair share of the ball. He forced four turnovers last year and had a touchdown on a fumble return.
teammates that have played on both
sides of the ball at the college level.
"Those guys are like animals," he
said of Howell and Amanam. "It's
kind of natural for them. It's the
same foundation you go through,
out there trying to make somebody
miss."
But while Sherman and Howell
were thrust into starting roles imme
diately due to deep holes in the sec
ondary, the coaching staff likely con
verted Amanam in anticipation of
the departure of all three senior de
fensive backs following this season.
He may see light action this year at
right cornerback behind Bademosi.
Instead, the open left cornerback
spot is expected to be filled by rising
sophomore Barry Browning, who
saw action in all 13 games last sea
son.

"He is athletically incredible, but
[we're also impressed by] his atti
tude, his confidence and his willing
ness to constantly get better," How
ell said. "He's got high expectations
for himself, and the thing about him
is that he's very good at keeping a

level head. He realizes that there's a
lot of growth that's needed in terms
of where he wants to go."
"He's faster than anyone I've
played with in a long time, other
than [senior wide receiver] Chris
Owusu," Thomas remarked.

Despite the Cardinal's experi
ence in the secondary, the defen
sive backs will have their fair share
of tough tests in the year to come.
