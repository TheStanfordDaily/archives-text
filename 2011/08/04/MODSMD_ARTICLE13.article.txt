# WILLIAMS WINS BOTW
## GOOD CHANCE FOR COMEBACK 
### KEVIN ZHANG INTERN 
It's often hard to tell when a
comeback trail will finish, but Serena
Williams is certainly well on her way.
Competing in only her third tour
nament since winning the 13th
Grand Slam title of her career at
Wimbledon in 2010, Williams won
the 2011 Bank of the West (BotW)
Classic, which took place at Stan
ford's Taube Family Tennis Stadium
this past week.
"I'm really excited to have won
here," Williams said. "I haven't won
a tournament in forever. I put a lot of

work into this week, and it has paid
off."

The title marks the first time
Williams has won BotW, which is the
oldest female-only professional tour
nament in the world. She did so in a
convincing fashion, beating No. 9
Marion Bartoli 7-5,6-1 in the Sunday
final. This match was nothing like the
last one between the two, when Bar
toli knocked Williams out of Wim
bledon in the fourth round 6-3, 7-6
(6).

The match only lasted an hour
and 22 minutes. Williams quickly
overpowered Bartoli, who has made
it to the final three of the last four
years and won only once, in 2009,
against Serena's sister Venus. Bar
toli did keep things close in the first
set, taking a 4-2 lead before she suf
fered a bruised bone in her hand.

The 29-year-old Williams flashed
her signature powerful serves,
recording 11 aces. At times serving
straight into the sun, she was often
forced to alter her first serve.
In a tournament that was filled
with unexpected upsets, Williams
looked strong throughout. In front
of a packed house Friday evening,
the much-anticipated quarterfinal
matchup between Williams and No.
5 Maria Sharapova only took two
sets with Serena winning 6-1,6-3.
"It was a bad day, and I didn't feel
good on many parts of the game,"
Sharapova said. "But I also need to
step up and keep on going."
The following day, Williams post
ed a 6-1, 6-2 victory against No. 26
Sabine Lisicki of Germany. The
match took less than an hour as
Williams recorded three aces and
four break points.
The tournament victory had
added emotion for Williams, espe
cially after an 11-month layoff from
tennis because of complications that
resulted from a cut on her foot last
July. The break dropped Williams'
ranking down to No. 169 in the

world, but winning the BotW
brought her back into the double
digits at No. 79.
"[These smaller tournaments]
absolutely mean a lot more than they
did," Williams said. "I am so grateful
to have an opportunity to be healthy
and be here."

Other notable tennis players on
campus were No. 18 Ana Ivanokic of
Russia, No. 14 Agnieska Radwanska
of Poland and last year's winner, Vic
toria Azarenka of Belarus.

Ivanokic was upset in the first
round by Ayumi Morita of Japan 6-
3, 7-5. Radwanska lost to Lisicki in
the quarterfinals 7-6 (4), 2-6,6-2.

Azarenka, ranked No. 4 in the
world and hoping to repeat after beat
ing Sharapova in the 2010 final, was
upset in the singles tournament 4-6,7-
5, 6-2 by New Zealander Marina Er
akovic. The victory was Erakovic's
first against a top-10 player.
Although she was unable to de
fend her singles title, Azarenka built
upon her semifinal finish in last
year's doubles tournament, winning
the title with her partner Maria Kir
ilenko.

In an exciting week of family
events and autograph sessions, the
fun was capped off with the audience
singing happy birthday to Azarenka,
whose birthday is July 31.

The Bank of the West Classic was
the first stop on the 2011 Olympus
U.S. Open Series, which will lead up
to the U.S. Open in New York from
Aug. 29 to Sept. 11.
