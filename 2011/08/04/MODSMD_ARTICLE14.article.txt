# CRICKET'S FAIR PLAY
## 
### Tom Taylor 
The idea of sportsman
ship, as opposed to
gamesmanship, often
seems like a nostalgic
dream from the early
days of amateur sports not really
relevant to today's win-at-all-costs
professional mentality. Most players
in most sports would want to win fair
ly if they could, but the winning part is
far more important to them than the
ethical bit. If you have to resort to
dirty tactics and I'm not specifical
ly talking about cheating, but about
playing tricks on the opposition and
bending the rules to secure victory,
then so be it.

But perhaps there is still hope for
fair play. Events last Sunday in the in
ternational cricket test match be
tween current world No. 1 India and
heir-ascendant England were an ideal
example of why cricket, though now
very professional and subject to the
same capitalist pressures as other
major sports, is still regarded as a gen
tleman's game. There's even a phrase
for it: "It's just not cricket" refers to an
action that, though not expressly ille
gal, is still simply wrong.
The story started with England
fighting back into contention after a
pretty abysmal start and looking in
creasingly likely to win the match.
Batsman lan Bell was leading the
charge with well over a hundred runs,
and India badly needed to get him
out. And that's when it played its
trump card, an astounding piece of
gamesmanship that saw Bell walk
from the field believing the ball had
gone dead and that it was time for tea
yes, cricket really does have tea
breaks when in fact the game was
still live. Practically off the pitch, he
was easily run out, though even the
umpires didn't realize this when India
first appealed.
After several replays, the horrible
truth dawned on the England camp
and its assembled fans: according to
the regulations. Bell was out. But it
didn't feel right. That sort of trickery
just wasn't cricket, and as the players
headed off for their break, the throng
in the stands vented its anger at both
the officials and the Indian team. And
they weren't alone in their thoughts;
even the Indian players didn't feel
comfortable with what had happened,
and during the pause, they unani
mously agreed to ask the umpires to
reinstate Bell. What looked like a
dark day in the relations between the
two countries became a shining ex
ample of sportsmanship by India.
Giving up perhaps the one chance
to turn the tables in the game it duly
lost, India won a lot of respect. The
game won't be remembered for the
result, but for this odd little episode.
The man of the match award went to
England bowler Stuart Broad for first
scoring crucial runs to keep his team in
the game and then taking vital wickets
that reversed India's fortunes, but the
honor could just as easily have gone to
Indian captain Mahendra Singh
Dhoni. Not for any on-field success
his statistics were far from impressive
but for the truly honorable decision
to hand a reprieve to Bell.

It would be a lie to claim there is no
gamesmanship in cricket; in fact, some
players are renowned for the practice
of "sledging," attempting to distract
opposing players by verbally abusing

them. But I'm not sure many athletes
in other sports would give up a legally
obtained advantage on the basis that it
just wasn't fair. I don't know if a foot
ball player would ever be able to con
vince his opposition that a ball had
gone dead when in fact play was still
alive, but if he did, would he then turn
to a referee and ask for the play to be
reset on the basis that his actions
weren't within the spirit of the game?
Maybe other teams in other sports
could learn something from all this.
Just as taking illegal substances or
cheating detracts from any success
you might achieve, the way you play
the game isn't just an afterthought. I
might be crazy, but I would rather
play honestly and lose than win un
fairly. The top athletes usually have
supreme confidence in their abilities,
in how they got where they are and
how they can beat anyone. If that's re
ally true, they shouldn't need to find
any other way to win.

It's time to read The Daily while you
sit down to your afternoon tea...
