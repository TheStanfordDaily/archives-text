# CRICKET'S FAIR PLAY

### Tom Taylor 
The idea of sportsman
ship, as opposed to
gamesmanship, often
seems like a nostalgic
dream from the early
days of amateur sports not really
relevant to today's win-at-all-costs
professional mentality. Most players
in most sports would want to win fair
ly if they could, but the winning part is
far more important to them than the
ethical bit. If you have to resort to
dirty tactics and I'm not specifical
ly talking about cheating, but about
playing tricks on the opposition and
bending the rules to secure victory,
then so be it.

But perhaps there is still hope for
fair play. Events last Sunday in the in

gone dead and that it was time for tea

breaks when in fact the game was
still live. Practically off the pitch, he
was easily run out, though even the
umpires didn't realize this when India
first appealed.
After several replays, the horrible
truth dawned on the England camp
and its assembled fans: according to
the regulations. Bell was out. But it
didn't feel right. That sort of trickery
just wasn't cricket, and as the players
headed off for their break, the throng
in the stands vented its anger at both
the officials and the Indian team. And
they weren't alone in their thoughts;
even the Indian players didn't feel
comfortable with what had happened,
and during the pause, they unani
