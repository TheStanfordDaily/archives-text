f f o ahead and take a seat,"
M said sociology professor Ce-
I cilia Ridgeway, motioning to
% V a vacant seat in her office in
McClatchy Hall. The room
was stereotypically professorial, cramped and
dimly lit, shelves filled to the brim with books.
Every available surface was stacked with papers
and files a hint at how busy Ridgeway's life
had been even before being elected president of
the American Sociological Association (ASA).
President of the ASA, "a non-profit mem
bership association dedicated to advancing soci
ology as a scientific discipline and profession
serving the public good," according to its web
site, is only the capstone of a long list of acco
lades that Ridgeway has accumulated over the
course of her career. She currently serves as the
Lucie Stern Professor of Social Sciences in the
Sociology Department at Stanford, and in 2008,
she was the winner of the Distinguished Femi
nist Lecturer Award, given to her by Sociolo
gists for Women in Society for her contributions
to feminist research.

Years ago as an undergraduate, like many
of her peers, Ridgeway's plans were not always
so directed, and she initially did not know
which subject she would like to major in. How
ever, she cites a class she took her sophomore
year as getting her into sociology.
"I just found the sociologist convincing," she
explained.

She would go on to graduate from the Uni
versity of Michigan in 1967 with a bachelors de
gree in sociology, followed by a stint at Cornell
University where she earned a masters in sociol
ogy in 1969 and Ph.D. in sociology and social psy
chology in 1972. She went on to teach at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the Univer
sity of lowa before finding a home at Stanford in
1991 where she has remained ever since.

Ridgeway is acknowledges that some of her
most recognized material has to do with gender
and its influence upon social interactions. How
ever, she is also visibly excited to discuss her
work with "interpersonal relations and the
structures of power and influence that develop
