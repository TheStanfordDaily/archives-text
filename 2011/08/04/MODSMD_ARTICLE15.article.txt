f f o ahead and take a seat,"
M said sociology professor Ce-
I cilia Ridgeway, motioning to
% V a vacant seat in her office in
McClatchy Hall. The room
was stereotypically professorial, cramped and
dimly lit, shelves filled to the brim with books.
Every available surface was stacked with papers
and files a hint at how busy Ridgeway's life
had been even before being elected president of
the American Sociological Association (ASA).
President of the ASA, "a non-profit mem
bership association dedicated to advancing soci
ology as a scientific discipline and profession
serving the public good," according to its web
site, is only the capstone of a long list of acco
lades that Ridgeway has accumulated over the
course of her career. She currently serves as the
Lucie Stern Professor of Social Sciences in the
Sociology Department at Stanford, and in 2008,
she was the winner of the Distinguished Femi
nist Lecturer Award, given to her by Sociolo
gists for Women in Society for her contributions
to feminist research.

Years ago as an undergraduate, like many
of her peers, Ridgeway's plans were not always
so directed, and she initially did not know
which subject she would like to major in. How
ever, she cites a class she took her sophomore
year as getting her into sociology.
"I just found the sociologist convincing," she
explained.

She would go on to graduate from the Uni
versity of Michigan in 1967 with a bachelors de
gree in sociology, followed by a stint at Cornell
University where she earned a masters in sociol
ogy in 1969 and Ph.D. in sociology and social psy
chology in 1972. She went on to teach at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the Univer
sity of lowa before finding a home at Stanford in
1991 where she has remained ever since.

Ridgeway is acknowledges that some of her
most recognized material has to do with gender
and its influence upon social interactions. How
ever, she is also visibly excited to discuss her
work with "interpersonal relations and the
structures of power and influence that develop

Cecilia Ridgeway, the Lucie Stern Professor of Social Sciences, was recently elected to be the president of the American Sociological Association.
in interpersonal relations."
"It's interesting because it's be
tween people in the same family,
between intimates," she said. "And
a lot of the important things that
happen with gender happen inter
personally, not just institutionally.
This is in your face in some ways."
As president of the ASA a po
sition that begins as president-elect
on Aug. 23 of this year and as presi
dent on Aug. 20, 2012 Ridgeway
will organize programs for sociolo
gists to submit papers for presenta
tion and invite panels that discuss dif
ferent themes. She will also give a
presidential address to an audience
of sociologists at each meeting. De
spite the added responsibility, she is
not worried that the position will in
terfere with her teaching or current
research pursuits.

"It's a lot of work but it isn't a
conflict with your job," she said.

The position's flexibility will
allow her academic research, which
builds upon a 30-year body of work
and innumerable publications, to
continue full steam ahead. In addi
tion to publishing a book that focus
es on the persistence of gender in
equalities in the modern world enti
tled "Framed by Gender" (2011),
Ridgeway has been busy doing "a
lot of studies on how beliefs develop
that change social differences into
status differences."

Additionally, in collaboration
with two other professors, Ridge
way is working on a paper that deals
with the "face to face aspects of so
cial class and how that can act as bar
riers for people." She excitedly talks
about the areas in society where
race, class, and gender collide.
At Stanford, Ridgeway's courses
touch squarely on those themes. For
undergraduates, she teaches two
classes, "Interpersonal Relations"
and "Sociology of Gender." At the
graduate level, she teaches a class
called "Foundations of Social Psy
chology," an advanced workshop
on the same topic.

Yet despite all of her accom
plishments in the field of gender
studies and interpersonal relations,
Ridgeway remains a down-to-earth,
and her waist-length hair and cat
eye glasses exude a kind of vintage
sixties-style cool. Students who
have worked closely with Ridgeway
share their enthusiasm about her as
an educator, mentor and leader
within the discipline.
"Working with Cecilia has been
a wonderful experience," said
Karen Powroznik Ph.D. 'l4, who
knows Ridgeway as an adviser.
"[She] is extremely insightful and
offers a nice balance of encourage
ment and constructive criticism. She
doesn't just explain complicated
ideas, she helps students work
through them."

"I am excited for her to serve as
ASA president because I believe
the qualities that make her such an
excellent mentor will benefit the
organization as a whole," she
added.
