## QUIRKS not just part of the ACT

It's not unusual for avid audience members
to have trouble separating the actor from
the character he's playing. They'll gaze at
John Krasinski and pray that he's just as witty
and charming as Jim Halpert or build elabo
rate fantasies about befriending Tina Fey with
the hope that she's half as hilarious as her
onscreen counterpart. Ultimately, these hopes
are almost always dashed. Actors get famous
because they're capable of becoming some-

thing they're not, and so the chance that their
personalities in the real world would match
their onscreen personas are fairly dismal.
Fortunately, Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari
may be the world's best exceptions to that rule:
they're every fan's fantasy they're living,
breathing manifestations of every character

they've ever played.
The two make an improbable pair: Ansari
has that same kind of cartoonish surrealism
even in person, all exaggerated expressions and
wild gesticulation. His twitchy counterpart sat
still and gnawed absentmindedly on a napkin
in the moments he wasn't speaking. They were
visibly comfortable surrounded by strangers
and assaulted by questions, happily bantering
back and forth with their assailants. At one
point, I confessed to having never seen "Point
Break," which prompted Ansari to stare me
dead in the eyes.
"You know, do me a favor: get out," he
deadpanned.
It was the first time that I have ever been
shot down by a celebrity, but it was certainly

not the last time that Ansari would playfully
mock one of his questioners.
The two were united by director Ruben
Fleischer for the movie "30 Minutes or Less,"
in which they play a couple of small-town
nobodies forced to rob a bank by a pair of
similarly pathetic villains. Jesse, who worked
with Fleischer before on "Zombieland," mar
veled at the director's ability "to make these
kinds of very funny, broad, visually arresting
movies but never compromise on the authen
ticity of the characters ... this movie is brand
ed in a bit more realistic situation [than
"Zombieland] but is still broad and extreme,
and he never once compromised the kind of
