## QUIRKS not just part of the ACT 
### â€“ eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
It's not unusual for avid audience members
to have trouble separating the actor from
the character he's playing. They'll gaze at
John Krasinski and pray that he's just as witty
and charming as Jim Halpert or build elabo
rate fantasies about befriending Tina Fey with
the hope that she's half as hilarious as her
onscreen counterpart. Ultimately, these hopes
are almost always dashed. Actors get famous
because they're capable of becoming some-

thing they're not, and so the chance that their
personalities in the real world would match
their onscreen personas are fairly dismal.
Fortunately, Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz Ansari
may be the world's best exceptions to that rule:
they're every fan's fantasy they're living,
breathing manifestations of every character

they've ever played.
The two make an improbable pair: Ansari
has that same kind of cartoonish surrealism
even in person, all exaggerated expressions and
wild gesticulation. His twitchy counterpart sat
still and gnawed absentmindedly on a napkin
in the moments he wasn't speaking. They were
visibly comfortable surrounded by strangers
and assaulted by questions, happily bantering
back and forth with their assailants. At one
point, I confessed to having never seen "Point
Break," which prompted Ansari to stare me
dead in the eyes.
"You know, do me a favor: get out," he
deadpanned.
It was the first time that I have ever been
shot down by a celebrity, but it was certainly

not the last time that Ansari would playfully
mock one of his questioners.
The two were united by director Ruben
Fleischer for the movie "30 Minutes or Less,"
in which they play a couple of small-town
nobodies forced to rob a bank by a pair of
similarly pathetic villains. Jesse, who worked
with Fleischer before on "Zombieland," mar
veled at the director's ability "to make these
kinds of very funny, broad, visually arresting
movies but never compromise on the authen
ticity of the characters ... this movie is brand
ed in a bit more realistic situation [than
"Zombieland] but is still broad and extreme,
and he never once compromised the kind of


COURTESY WILSON WEBB
reality of the characters." Oh, and for anyone wonder
ing: yes, Jesse Eisenberg really does talk that quickly in
real life.

The pacing of the movie's dialogue felt extremely
natural, so the fact that a good deal of it was invented
on the spot was not terribly surprising.
"It's hard to say a percentage or anything," Ansari
explained, "but on set there were a lot of little moments
we found and a lot of great lines we came up with that
did end up in the movies ... You know, when you're
actually there wearing the costumes, you're in the set,
you're doing the scenes, certain things come to your
head that you just can't come up with when you read it
in the room."

One of these "certain things" was the entirely of
the banter from the bank robbery scene (one of the
most hilarious scenes in the movie), which leads to the
conclusion that the entire film probably would have
gone over swimmingly if the director had just placed
Jesse and Ansari in front of a camera without a script
for an hour and sent it straight to production.

Ansari also gave a glimpse into an actor's psyche,
despite his refusal to give straight answers. Elaborating
on his funnier improvised decisions, he explained that
much of his behavior was influenced by decisions that
he'd made about his character without any direction
from the script or from his directors.
"I made a choice somewhat early on that [his
character Chet] was hungry the whole day." This was
n't particularly significant to the movie, of course, but
it did partially explain Chet's short fuse.
Jesse was asked what he would do in his charac
ter's situation if he were not "a super-rich celebrity."
But, like Ansari, he shot back a characteristically cheeky
answer.
"Wait, sorry, I'm just I'm having trouble just
figuring out what it's like to not be a super-rich celebri
ty," he said. So, what, he'd just email his assistant? Jesse
laughed: "Oh, I don't have to email her, she knows."
