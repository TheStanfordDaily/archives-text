# MUSIC REVIEW
## 'Here I Am' passable with production team's help 
### â€” andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
In the process of producing an album, it seems
that all the credit goes to the featured artist.
They do, after all, provide the main vocal per
formance, and if they can slap their names on a
couple songs as a songwriter, they are blindly
(and often, misguidedly) seen as a major threat in
the music industry. However, "Here I Am," the
latest work by R&B singer Kelly Rowland, is the
perfect example of how crucial a role the produc

ers, not the artist, play. "Here I Am" is an album
riddled with cliches and perhaps one too many
collaborations but was at least engineered careful
ly enough to slide by as a passable effort.
Rowland, best known as a founding mem
ber of Destiny s Child, successfully began her solo
career in 2002 (if anyone remembers "Dilemma"
with Nelly, that was a product of her first album),
followed by a disappointing second album, "Ms.

Kelly," in 2007. Rowland is certainly a talented
singer, but her individual work, especially "Here I
Am," is still unspectacular.
This latest album contains a couple hits,
most notably "Motivation," the second single
and the sultriest song of the album. But it's hard
to tell whether "Motivation" succeeds because of
Rowland herself, the grinding beat or
Lil Wayne's star power. The same
goes with "Commander," an exces
sively auto-tuned song that, at least, is
a club thumper (and of course it is,
because it was produced by David

Guetta).
Besides these two efforts, "Here I
Am" is marred by poorly done generic
fillers. The album opens with "I'm Dat
Chick," a flimsy attempt at a female
empowerment song ("T m not tacky/I

just love myself), especially when com
pared to the rest of the more fawning
album. "Lay It on Me" (featuring Big
Sean), for instance, is an off-putting
combination of happy pop beat with
the pleading lyrics of a slow jam, while
"Down for Whatever" (featuring The
Wavs) brings yet another meaningless
song, this time with a thick electro
rhythm entirely out of place on an
R&B album.

"Here I Am" may at least catch
up to the sales success of Beyonce's lat
est, "4," if not gamer the same critical

reception. And the comparison is
inevitable, if not regrettable, after the
two spent over a decade singing
together. Though Rowland shouldn't
have to spend her career in the shadow
of Beyonce, she will. "Here I Am" does
not help Rowland's case, lacking the
individuality and punch of an excellent
solo album.
In the end, the success stories of
"Here I Am" lie with a couple singles
and several high-flying producers.
Without this duo, the album would fall
flat; as is, Rowland might think to keep
her production team nearby for a
while.
