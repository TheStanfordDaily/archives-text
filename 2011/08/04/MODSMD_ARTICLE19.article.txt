# A 						gamer's fantasy: Developers who should be on

Game devel
opers are a
unique 4
breed. Their craft
takes an odd com-

bination of artistic, technical and managerial
chops. They might be as pretentious or entided
as some of Hollywood's biggest directors or as
impetuous and juvenile as teenage pop stars.
Or, of course, they could just be unabashedly
geeky.

It's a rare treat when we can get inside the
heads of these visionaries, taking just a few
steps down whatever rabbit hole they might
get their ideas from. Interviews are great, but
they're infrequent and overly scripted and
however cooperative a developer may be,
they're usually held in check by a PR rep lurk
ing in the shadows nearby. Developer diaries,
documentaries and "making-of' features are
typically just as stilted, interesting in their own
right but confined to a predictable, media
friendly cadence.
If actors and athletes are any indication,
Twitter can be a great way to cut out the mid
dleman and get an unfiltered window into
celebrities' lives. Some developer accounts are

totally freewheeling "Metal Gear" creator
Hideo Kojima tweeted 20 times about

"Papillon" and "Planet of the Apes" the other
day, not mentioning games even once. Other
accounts, like Epic Games' Cliff Bleszinski's,
give a healthier mix of travel updates, pictures
of pets and, of course, pimping for in-house
projects like "Gears of War 3."
Dozens of other developers, though, don't
turn up with a casual search. I admit the fol
lowing is a bit fantastical some of these guys
don't speak the best English or have PR

departments that keep them away from
Twitter with a 10-foot pole. Others may
already have blogs or journals, but those still
aren't as sporadic, unfiltered or casual as a
humble tweet. So with that in mind and
impracticalities neatly swept under the rug,
here's my list a guy can dream, right?
Shigeru Miyamoto
Famous for: "Mario," "Zelda," "Donkey
Kong"
Miyamoto's position at Nintendo goes
beyond a traditional title. The man is a gold
mine of ideas, and he's been cranking out
classics since Nintendo kick-started the
industry after the market crashed in 1983.
His games, while revered, are utterly bizarre
on the surface but incredibly, almost all
his inspirations come from his daily life.
"Mario" was his landlord, "Pikmin" came
from a day in the garden, "Zelda" is a
reimagining of his trips to rural Japan and
"Nintendogs," of course, comes from time
with his Shetland Shepard, Pikku. At age 58,
he's only getting quirkier, and I'd love to see
more of life through his eyes.
Richard Garriott
Famous for: "Ultima"... and something awe
some.
So, Richard Garriott. Never heard of
him? Then you must've been born in the
'9os or owned a crappy computer until the
last decade. Garriott made a name for him
self with the "Ultima" series of PC RPGs,
which he developed nonstop from 1980 to
2000. His games might seem dry to younger
audiences, but even at 50, his personality is
one of a kind. Exhibit A: his rat tail-esque
hair (you kind of have to see it). And B: he's
been to freaking space. Really: Garriott, the
sun of an astronaut, funded his own 12-day
journey aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket to
the International Space Station in 2008.
Keiji Inafune
Famous for: "Mega Man," "Onimusha,"
"Dead Rising"
More than anyone on this list, Inafune
has always been about the fans. He makes
video messages for them, takes their opin
ions to heart and, in his time with the com
pany, wasn't afraid to lobby Capcom for
entire projects based on fan demand. That

attitude won him plenty of admiration from
gamers, but caused enough friction with
Capcom for him to leave the company
where he had become a legend over 23 years.
There's a great personality and a bit of mys
tery to Inafune, and I'd love to see more
snippets of his personal side and his new
game, of course.

Tomonobu Itagaki
Famous for: "Dead or Alive," "Ninja
Gaiden," sketchiness

Tomonobu Itagaki is a creep. He's a
misogynistic, crude man who hides behind
sunglasses and gets in trouble for sexual
harassment. His "Dead or Alive" and "Ninja
Gaiden" games were generally well received
(including by this writer) before his dramatic
departure from Team Ninja. But they were
also crammed with enough busty women
and organ-spewing carnage to land 20-
minute specials on Fox. He's twisted and
eccentric, but he's also a visionary. In short,
he's a perfect candidate for Twitter.
Gabe Newell
Famous for: Running the house that built
"Half-Life," "Portal" and Steam
To put it one way, Gabe Newell is in
charge of what might be the most badass
game company I know of. Valve is privately
owned, operates largely in secret and some
how toes the line between rainbow-coated
dream factory and underground money
printing operation with enough grace to
command respect. It doesn't hurt to control
nearly three quarters of the downloadable
PC game market via Steam, either. It's not
going to happen anytime soon, but having
some insight into Valve's inner workings
with an active Twitter feed from Newell
would lend some personality to the secretive
company. And as a man, Newell himself
provides an intriguing object of study, he's
got a collection of 600 knives in his office
and talks smack about other companies
whenever he wants. Valve is a one-in-a-mil
lion sort of company, and no one embodies
its mystique, talent and attitude more than
Newell.

mine of ideas, and he's been cranking out
classics since Nintendo kick-started the
industry after the market crashed in 1983.
His games, while revered, are utterly bizarre
on the surface but incredibly, almost all
his inspirations come from his daily life.
"Mario" was his landlord, "Pikmin" came
from a day in the garden, "Zelda" is a
reimagining of his trips to rural Japan and
"Nintendogs," of course, comes from time
with his Shetland Shepard, Pikku. At age 58,
he's only getting quirkier, and I'd love to see
more of life through his eyes.
Richard Garriott
Famous for: "Ultima"... and something awe
some.
So, Richard Garriott. Never heard of
him? Then you must've been born in the
'9os or owned a crappy computer until the
last decade. Garriott made a name for him
self with the "Ultima" series of PC RPGs,
which he developed nonstop from 1980 to
2000. His games might seem dry to younger
audiences, but even at 50, his personality is
one of a kind. Exhibit A: his rat tail-esque
hair (you kind of have to see it). And B: he's
been to freaking space. Really: Garriott, the
sun of an astronaut, funded his own 12-day
journey aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket to
the International Space Station in 2008.
Keiji Inafune
Famous for: "Mega Man," "Onimusha,"
"Dead Rising"
More than anyone on this list, Inafune
has always been about the fans. He makes
video messages for them, takes their opin
ions to heart and, in his time with the com
pany, wasn't afraid to lobby Capcom for
entire projects based on fan demand. That

attitude won him plenty of admiration from
gamers, but caused enough friction with
Capcom for him to leave the company
where he had become a legend over 23 years.
There's a great personality and a bit of mys
tery to Inafune, and I'd love to see more
snippets of his personal side and his new
game, of course.

Tomonobu Itagaki
Famous for: "Dead or Alive," "Ninja
Gaiden," sketchiness

Tomonobu Itagaki is a creep. He's a
misogynistic, crude man who hides behind
sunglasses and gets in trouble for sexual
harassment. His "Dead or Alive" and "Ninja
Gaiden" games were generally well received
(including by this writer) before his dramatic
departure from Team Ninja. But they were
also crammed with enough busty women
and organ-spewing carnage to land 20-
minute specials on Fox. He's twisted and
eccentric, but he's also a visionary. In short,
he's a perfect candidate for Twitter.
Gabe Newell
Famous for: Running the house that built
"Half-Life," "Portal" and Steam
To put it one way, Gabe Newell is in
charge of what might be the most badass
game company I know of. Valve is privately
owned, operates largely in secret and some
how toes the line between rainbow-coated
dream factory and underground money
printing operation with enough grace to
command respect. It doesn't hurt to control
nearly three quarters of the downloadable
PC game market via Steam, either. It's not
going to happen anytime soon, but having
some insight into Valve's inner workings
with an active Twitter feed from Newell
would lend some personality to the secretive
company. And as a man, Newell himself
provides an intriguing object of study, he's
got a collection of 600 knives in his office
and talks smack about other companies
whenever he wants. Valve is a one-in-a-mil
lion sort of company, and no one embodies
its mystique, talent and attitude more than
Newell.
Game devel
opers are a
unique 4
breed. Their craft
takes an odd com-

bination of artistic, technical and managerial
chops. They might be as pretentious or entided
as some of Hollywood's biggest directors or as
impetuous and juvenile as teenage pop stars.
Or, of course, they could just be unabashedly
geeky.

It's a rare treat when we can get inside the
heads of these visionaries, taking just a few
steps down whatever rabbit hole they might
get their ideas from. Interviews are great, but
they're infrequent and overly scripted and
however cooperative a developer may be,
they're usually held in check by a PR rep lurk
ing in the shadows nearby. Developer diaries,
documentaries and "making-of' features are
typically just as stilted, interesting in their own
right but confined to a predictable, media
friendly cadence.
If actors and athletes are any indication,
Twitter can be a great way to cut out the mid
dleman and get an unfiltered window into
celebrities' lives. Some developer accounts are

totally freewheeling "Metal Gear" creator
Hideo Kojima tweeted 20 times about

"Papillon" and "Planet of the Apes" the other
day, not mentioning games even once. Other
accounts, like Epic Games' Cliff Bleszinski's,
give a healthier mix of travel updates, pictures
of pets and, of course, pimping for in-house
projects like "Gears of War 3."
Dozens of other developers, though, don't
turn up with a casual search. I admit the fol
lowing is a bit fantastical some of these guys
don't speak the best English or have PR

departments that keep them away from
Twitter with a 10-foot pole. Others may
already have blogs or journals, but those still
aren't as sporadic, unfiltered or casual as a
humble tweet. So with that in mind and
impracticalities neatly swept under the rug,
here's my list a guy can dream, right?
Shigeru Miyamoto

Kong"
