Game devel
opers are a
unique 4
breed. Their craft
takes an odd com-

bination of artistic, technical and managerial
chops. They might be as pretentious or entided
as some of Hollywood's biggest directors or as
impetuous and juvenile as teenage pop stars.
Or, of course, they could just be unabashedly
geeky.

It's a rare treat when we can get inside the
heads of these visionaries, taking just a few
steps down whatever rabbit hole they might
get their ideas from. Interviews are great, but
they're infrequent and overly scripted and
however cooperative a developer may be,
they're usually held in check by a PR rep lurk
ing in the shadows nearby. Developer diaries,
documentaries and "making-of' features are
typically just as stilted, interesting in their own
right but confined to a predictable, media
friendly cadence.
If actors and athletes are any indication,
Twitter can be a great way to cut out the mid
dleman and get an unfiltered window into
celebrities' lives. Some developer accounts are

totally freewheeling "Metal Gear" creator
Hideo Kojima tweeted 20 times about

"Papillon" and "Planet of the Apes" the other
day, not mentioning games even once. Other
accounts, like Epic Games' Cliff Bleszinski's,
give a healthier mix of travel updates, pictures
of pets and, of course, pimping for in-house
projects like "Gears of War 3."
Dozens of other developers, though, don't
turn up with a casual search. I admit the fol
lowing is a bit fantastical some of these guys
don't speak the best English or have PR
