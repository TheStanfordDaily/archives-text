## UNIVERSITY Overseas seminars to relaunch Three-week abroad programs begin after two-summer hiatus 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
Stanford Overseas Seminars are returning to
the University for the 2011-12 academic year.
The program, which is run by the Bing
Overseas Studies Program (BOSP), will ac
commodate between 60 and 75 students in five
three-week long seminars during summer
2012. The program should then expand to its
peak size of 10 seminars for 150 students in
2013. Specific details on the programs offered
have not yet been announced.
"We are spending the summer identifying
the locations for the seminars and the faculty
associated with them," said BOSP director
Bob Sinclair. "We'll be making an announce
ment about them once everything has been
finalized."

It is confirmed that some changes to trip
planning will be implemented.
"We are putting much more investment of
our funds into hiring local companies to set up
the logistical aspects of the program like the
housing and local transportation," Sinclair said.

"In the past, it was largely a burden for the fac
ulty members. We want the faculty... to focus
more on the academic aspects and the interac
tions with students."
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
Harry Elam commented on the benefits Over
seas Seminars will bring to undergraduate stu-

dents.
"The Overseas Seminars offer the potential
for students who cannot go abroad during the
regular academic year to have this important
experience," wrote Elam in an email to The
Daily. "It offers students the chance to explore
sites and learn in locations where Stanford
does not have existent overseas campuses."
Sinclair explained BOSP's emphasis on pro
gram sites.

"There's an increasing need to look at more
globalized locations," Sinclair said. "The major
ity will be outside of Europe."

Sinclair also reiterated the effect the semi
nars might have on students studying abroad.
"I particularly know the difficulties engi
neering students have in fitting study abroad
into their schedules, though many engineers
and athletes do," he said. "[Overseas Seminars]
are away to help their situation."
Overseas Seminars began after the 2002
school year and ran until a hiatus after the

2008-

09 year, when the

programs were cut due to bud
getary constraints. There were

seminars in 25 countries over that time, with
some courses repeated over the program's eight
years.
Overseas Seminars is the only program cut at
the time to be reinstated so far.
"We were very unhappy to have to cut the
overseas seminars, and so as soon as the finan
cial situation improved, they were one of the
highest priorities to reinstate," wrote Provost
Etchemendy in an email to The Daily.
"We received incremental funding to re
launch the program," explained Irene
Kennedy, Bing Overseas Studies executive di
rector. "We cover all the in-country costs, the
faculty salary, for housing and food, in-country
transportation and any entry fees."
Students will pay for their own airfare and a
$6OO fee to participate in the seminars. Finan-
