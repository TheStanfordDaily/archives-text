## Ash tries the boys on for size

This week, Ashley took her three
boyfriends out on the long-awaited
overnight dates, a.k.a. the sex dates. She
celebrated this momentous occasion by show
ing sensational amounts of skin and informing
her audience that yes, again she had been
misinformed all the previous times and that
Fiji is the "ultimate place for falling in love."
I'm really glad she cleared that up for us.

Her first date was with Ben, and the two
of them were kind of cute together: their ban
ter was endearing, if not altogether intelligent.
I don't love Ben, but it's very apparent that she
digs him, and I can respect that, though I spent
the majority of the date throwing popcorn at
the TV screen and shouting "you gonna make
out?" In my defense, they were practically hav
ing sex in front of us: Ash spent an inordinate
amount of time straddling him while slather
ing his chest with sunscreen, and then I had to
watch with increasing discomfort as Ben
rubbed sunscreen all over her barely covered
chest. At the end of it, she told him, "Thanks
for all your ... hard work" I'm 90 percent
certain that she was making a joke about him
having a boner. Ben also kept up his tradition
of using creepily outdated slang, referring to
the two of them as, and I swear I'm not mak
ing this up, "a pair of giddy little schoolchild
ren." Honestly, I don't know why I even both
er to make fun of this show; it does such a
good job parodying itself.
At their dinner together, Ben was dressed
as some kind of awkward Elizabethan man,
decked out in a weird, stupid, poofy-as-hell
pirate shirt that was tucked into khakis ( really,
Ben?). At the end of the date, she decided to let
him spend the night in her bed, which I
thought was actually pretty cool of her - I've
never watched a season of "The Bachelorette"
in which the girl slept with her suitors before
the proposal; I'd always assumed that the show
must subscribe to the outdated and misogynis
tic assumption that if a girl isn't chaste, she's
somehow less valuable, and I appreciated the
fact that apparently this was not the case. I
mean, feminism aside, I still can't stand the
girl, but I was happy for her and her ability to
get laid.
The date with Constantine was fairly bor
ing, though my respect for him really has been
growing in the past few weeks. He's become

funny and likeable, though he's still vaguely
uninteresting. I always thought he was funda
mentally a nice guy, and my respect for him
peaked today: he told her that he respected Ben
and JP, that he didn't think he was as head
over-heels for her as they were and that he was
essentially pulling out of the running to main
tain good relationships with his friends. In the
end, it turned out that big, goofy Constantard
is a pretty rad guy after all.
This episode also featured a big surprise:
goofy optimist Ryan, who'd been sent home
two episodes ago and who never had any sort
of chemistry with our dear little dentist,
returned with the hope of a second chance.
Ryan's whole tearful "I just want somebody to
love!" bit was cute the first time, and it was

even sad the second time, but honestly, guy,
it's been like four times now. Quit your crying
and move on with your life; you went on like
one date with this girl. Ash dealt with things
fairly maturely: she gave him a hug, told him
how much she respected him and then sent
him home.

As per usual, the producers ensured that
their viewers would stick around for the whole
show by saving JP for last. Honestly, that boy is
perfection; he's this exquisite combination of
