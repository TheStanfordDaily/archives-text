### ELAINA KOROS INTERN 
Social psychologist and professor emeritus of psychol
ogy Philip Zimbardo, world renowned for the Stanford
Prison Experiment, has gifted an extensive set of files,
tapes and paraphernalia to the Stanford University
Archives.
Zimbardo's gift, announced in June, will be accessible
to the public; certain materials will also be digitized and
made available in the archives' online database by the
end of 2011. The materials showcase over 40 years of re
search, with files and letters related to Zimbardo's stud
ies, including the Stanford Prison Experiment, and notes
and materials from the classes he taught at Stanford.

"It's a very wide-ranging selection," Zimbardo said.

Professor emeritus of psychology Philip Zimbardo donated his personal collection of
files, videos, audio tapes and other collected materials to the library's archives.
"I gave [the archives] access to vir
tually everything I had, and the
archivist selected a set of materials
that he thought would be of most
value to people interested in my
work, or me or the Stanford facul
ty in general."
The gift includes papers from
Zimbardo's research on shyness,
deindividualization, terrorism,
cults and obedience. Additionally,
Zimbardo included many videos
and handwritten lesson plans.
"There are all these video tapes

that he used in class or for experi
mental techniques," Daniel
Hartwig, a Stanford archivist, said.
"It's not just Zimbardo the re
searcher or the prison experi
menter, but there's also Zimbardo
the teacher."

Zimbardo chose to gift his pa
pers to benefit future scholars,
who will be able to easily access the
digitized forms of his materials.
Scholars will soon have the re
sources to do in-depth research
into Zimbardo's work.

"After many years of students
asking us for primary resources
pertaining to the Stanford Prison
Experiment, now we can provide
them the documents related to this
compelling study," said Mattie
Taormina, head of public services
and a processing manuscripts li
brarian for Stanford's Special Col
lections and University Archives.
"I'm particularly excited by the
prospect of our undergraduates
being able to consult these materi
als for their term papers."
Having never digitized much of
his work, Zimbardo appreciates
the archives' service of transform
ing the materials into a more acces
sible format.
"There are hundreds of videos
and boxes of files and letters and
manuscripts, many in my original
handwriting, so [digitizing the ma
terials] was something I couldn't
do myself," Zimbardo said. "For
me, it's a great service that the
University will be doing that hard
work in transforming, for example,
VHS or video tapes into a digital
format or transforming many,
many boxes of original materials
into a digitized form that other
people can use."

Over the course of about a
month, the team of archivists collect
ed at least 50 boxes from Zimbardo's
office, which held most of the Prison
Experiment materials, and trans
ferred them to the archives. In the
upcoming months, the archivists will

collect the remaining materials from
Zimbardo's home in San Francisco
and finish processing the audiovisual
materials.
"The University Archives
serves not only as the long-term
memory of the campus; as part of
the libraries, it has a mandate to
collect and preserve unique mate
rials that can provide the substance
of future study and research," said
Andrew Herkovic, Stanford Li-

braries director of communica
tions. "The Zimbardo papers pro
vide a fine example demonstrating
these dual roles of the archives,
and these papers will doubtless be
the subject of much investigation
in years and decades to come."
Zimbardo himself found gath
ering the materials from his files an
interesting process.

"I was simply surprised when I
went through my file cabinets, full
of material that I have long since
forgotten that I even had," he said.
Zimbardo's papers and other
materials will be fully available to

the public by the middle of 2012.
"We in the archives have a few
collections of Stanford psycholo
gists, but [Zimbardo's collection] is
clearly the most eminent of our col
lections at the moment, so it creates
the field for us in special collections
in the archives," Hartwig said.
