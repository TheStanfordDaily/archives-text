Social psychologist and professor emeritus of psychol
ogy Philip Zimbardo, world renowned for the Stanford
Prison Experiment, has gifted an extensive set of files,
tapes and paraphernalia to the Stanford University
Archives.
Zimbardo's gift, announced in June, will be accessible
to the public; certain materials will also be digitized and
made available in the archives' online database by the
end of 2011. The materials showcase over 40 years of re
search, with files and letters related to Zimbardo's stud
ies, including the Stanford Prison Experiment, and notes
and materials from the classes he taught at Stanford.

"It's a very wide-ranging selection," Zimbardo said.
