## University set to study high-speed rail proposal 
### HAELIN CHO INTERN 
Construction on the 140-mile-long,
220-mile-per-hour high-speed rail from
Sacramento to San Diego has met both
encouragement and resistance in Stan
ford and its surrounding Bay Area com
munity.

Michael Cunningham, vice president
of public policy for the Bay Area Coun
cil, said that both state and federal gov
ernment have approved the high-speed
rail project's environmental document.
"Its progress to date is it has an im
proved project-level environmental doc
ument certified by the state of California
and the federal government," he said. "It
has a partially completed design engi
neering design for the entire system,
and it has underway details, design stud
ies and environmental clearance for all of
the segments between San Francisco and
Los Angeles."

Construction will begin next year and
is projected to finish by 2020, according
to California High-Speed Rail Authority
spokesman Rachel Wall.
Stanford is planning to participate in
the study and planning of the high-speed
rail project, which so far has $6.3 billion
with which to begin construction.
"Stanford owns 36 acres of land adja
cent to the Caltrain corridor in Menlo
Park and Palo Alto and owns the Univer
sity Avenue Train Depot," wrote Stan
ford Director of Community Relations
Jean McCown in an email to The Daily.
"Like many other property owners, Stan
ford is concerned that potentially nega
tive impacts of the HSR [high-speed rail]
system on these properties be adequate
ly addressed, and when the necessary
studies begin they are apparently not
being pursued at this time expects to
be an active participant."

Although the University sees the po
tential benefits of the high-speed rail, Mc-
Cown added that Stanford has found a
few issues with the high-speed rail, includ
ing "inadequate analysis of future HSR
ridership; continued lack of full-cost infor
mation on all elements of HSR, including
land takings and impacts on businesses;
