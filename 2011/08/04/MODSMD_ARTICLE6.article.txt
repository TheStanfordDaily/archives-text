## Stanford will respond to NYC Request for Proposals 
### BILLY GALLAGHER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The quest to build a Stanford hub
on the East Coast continues as the
University announced that it will re
spond to New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg's Request for
Proposals (RFP) for a new or ex
panded graduate engineering and
applied sciences campus in the city.
"Our offer is straightforward,"
Bloomberg said in a July 19 speech.
"We will provide prime New York

City real estate â€”at virtually no
cost, plus up to $lOO million in infra
structure upgrades in exchange
for a university's commitment to
build or expand a world-class sci
ence and engineering campus here
in our city."
The initiative, called Applied
Sciences NYC, was announced in
December by Mayor Bloomberg
and the New York City Economic
Development Corp. (NYCEDC).
After discussing the idea in Faculty
Senate meetings, President John

Hennessy led Stanford in submit
ting a formal "expression of inter
est" in March. Applied Sciences
NYC was the focus of April's Acad
emic Council meeting as well.
View from the Farm
University officials are opti
mistic about the opportunities NYC
will provide and confident in Stan
ford's ability to overcome potential
challenges. William Dally, profes
sor of computer science and electri
cal engineering, is leading a faculty

advisory committee tasked with
evaluating Applied Sciences NYC
and advising the University.
"There's a number of synergies
available with various local indus
tries ranging from the financial
community to media to opportuni
ties to get involved in sustainable
urban studies that don't exist here,"
Dally said. "Everybody's really ex
cited about using this to prototype
what the university of the future is
