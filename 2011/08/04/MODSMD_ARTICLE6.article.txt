## Stanford will respond to NYC Request for Proposals 
### BILLY GALLAGHER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The quest to build a Stanford hub
on the East Coast continues as the
University announced that it will re
spond to New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg's Request for
Proposals (RFP) for a new or ex
panded graduate engineering and
applied sciences campus in the city.
"Our offer is straightforward,"
Bloomberg said in a July 19 speech.
"We will provide prime New York

City real estate —at virtually no
cost, plus up to $lOO million in infra
structure upgrades in exchange
for a university's commitment to
build or expand a world-class sci
ence and engineering campus here
in our city."
The initiative, called Applied
Sciences NYC, was announced in
December by Mayor Bloomberg
and the New York City Economic
Development Corp. (NYCEDC).
After discussing the idea in Faculty
Senate meetings, President John

Hennessy led Stanford in submit
ting a formal "expression of inter
est" in March. Applied Sciences
NYC was the focus of April's Acad
emic Council meeting as well.
View from the Farm
University officials are opti
mistic about the opportunities NYC
will provide and confident in Stan
ford's ability to overcome potential
challenges. William Dally, profes
sor of computer science and electri
cal engineering, is leading a faculty

advisory committee tasked with
evaluating Applied Sciences NYC
and advising the University.
"There's a number of synergies
available with various local indus
tries ranging from the financial
community to media to opportuni
ties to get involved in sustainable
urban studies that don't exist here,"
Dally said. "Everybody's really ex
cited about using this to prototype
what the university of the future is
really about. As the world becomes
a more global place, it's clear that
universities can't be so tied to one
physical location."
"The biggest challenge is likely
to be making the faculty, students
and staff located in NYC be fully
part of the Stanford community,"
School of Engineering Dean James
Plummer wrote in an email to The
Daily. "We do not want to create a
separate entity. We want to create a
place that is part of Stanford in
every sense of that word."
Neither Plummer nor Dally were
concerned about the quality of facul
ty or students declining. Both noted
their programs could grow in num
bers without lowering standards
though they said hiring qualified fac
ulty would take longer.
"We're limited by the number of
students we can handle, not by tal
ent," Dally said.
University spokesperson Lisa
Lapin said departments around
campus have been working on the
final proposal, which she antici
pates will be over 100 pages.
In the Big Apple
NYCEDC said it received 18
proposals from 27 institutions in
March (many proposals are from
consortia).
According to the July 19 RFP,
NYCEDC prefers that any institu
tion based outside the United
States partner with an institution
inside the U.S. Seven of the 18 pro
posals were from non-U.S. institu
tions.

Additionally, institutions do not
need to have responded in March in
order to reply to the RFP provided
that they rank highly enough in aca
demically relevant fields, have an
endowment greater than $1 billion
or comparable financial backing
from a government and spend more
than $75 million annually on re

search in the applicable fields.
Formal proposals are due Oct.
28. NYCEDC will lead a committee
to select the winner based on crite
ria outlined in the RFP.

Forty percent of the decision is
dependent on the proposal's "eco
nomic impact and feasibility," in
cluding the quality of the proposal
and the estimated economic impact
on New York City. Stanford's
March proposal, "Stanford Univer
sity and New York City: Silicon
Valley II," appears to align closely
with the city's demands.
"A key goal for the NYC campus
would be to have a program to men
tor and assist faculty and students in
forming new ventures," the Stan
ford proposal reads. "To that end,
Stanford proposes to have in resi
dence on the NYC campus at least
one faculty member who has been
intimately involved —as a
founder, early-stage advisor and
board member, or investor —in
the creation of a more than $5OO
million startup."
An additional 40 percent will be
based on "respondent's qualifica
tions and track record," including
institutional quality and track
record in fundraising and on similar
projects.

Lapin stated that no one has
raised more money than Stanford
in the past eight years.
"There's nobody in the running
that's better than us," she said. "On
every measure, we're out ahead
there."

The final 20 percent is "institu
tional connections to the city,"
based on the proposal's potential
ties to the community, sustainabili
ty and hiring/workforce develop
ment.

"We have very active communi
ty partnerships here and would ex
pect the same in New York," Lapin
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
already have numerous connec
tions in NYC. And our preliminary
designs call for an open campus and
a park-like setting that would inte
grate the university with the com
munity."

The Competition
Several of the respondents have
experience with multiple campuses.
New York City Deputy Mayor
for Economics Robert Steel has
cited Cornell University's $630 mil
lion Manhattan medical school as a
precedent for Applied Sciences
NYC. The New York school has
been one of the most aggressive re
spondents in lobbying for
Bloomberg's selection. They have
reportedly hired a lobbyist and a
public relations firm for their pitch,
and university President David
Skorton made his own sales pitch in
a July 11th You Tube video.
New York University has estab
lished a campus in Abu Dhabi that
NYU Vice President for Public Af
fairs John Beckman called "enor
mously successful." Beckman
added that "our relevant experi
ence is not limited to NYU Abu
Dhabi" and that NYU and its con
sortium partners "have experience
at how to get things done here."

NYU is also in the process of es
tablishing a new campus in Shang
hai.

However, not all multiple-cam
pus endeavors have been success
ful. Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has a Silicon Valley campus
that some at Stanford heed as a
warning.

"One real danger is that Stan
ford will do something and it will be
like the CMU effort in Silicon Val
ley, which I regard as a complete
failure," Dally said. "Maybe they
make some money off of it, but it's
not a replication of the excellent
computer science program CMU
has in Pittsburgh. It's a third-rate
educational establishment, and it
takes in people who couldn't get
into anywhere better. We don't
want that to happen."
Despite Stanford's lack of a de
gree-granting campus away from
the Farm, the University believes
its proposal does have credibility.
"What we would be doing in New

York isn't anywhere near the magni
tude of the construction we've had,"
Lapin said. "We're just about to re
place our hospital. We do big pro
jects. And we do them well, and we
can absolutely execute."

Race to October

Many insiders have pegged Cor
nell and Stanford as the leaders for
the selection.

Multiple references by
Bloomberg and the media to Sili
con Valley as the template for Ap
plied Sciences NYC bode well for
Stanford's chances.

"During the 1980s and '9os, Silicon
Valley not New York be
came the world capital of technolo
gy start-ups," Bloomberg said in his
July 19 speech. "And that is still
true today. But if I am right and
if we succeed in this mission it
won't be true forever."

The quest to build a Stanford hub
on the East Coast continues as the
University announced that it will re
spond to New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg's Request for
Proposals (RFP) for a new or ex
panded graduate engineering and
applied sciences campus in the city.
"Our offer is straightforward,"
Bloomberg said in a July 19 speech.
"We will provide prime New York

City real estate —at virtually no
cost, plus up to $lOO million in infra
structure upgrades in exchange
for a university's commitment to
build or expand a world-class sci
ence and engineering campus here
in our city."
The initiative, called Applied
Sciences NYC, was announced in
December by Mayor Bloomberg
and the New York City Economic
Development Corp. (NYCEDC).
After discussing the idea in Faculty
Senate meetings, President John

Hennessy led Stanford in submit
ting a formal "expression of inter
est" in March. Applied Sciences
NYC was the focus of April's Acad
emic Council meeting as well.
View from the Farm
University officials are opti
mistic about the opportunities NYC
will provide and confident in Stan
ford's ability to overcome potential
challenges. William Dally, profes
sor of computer science and electri
cal engineering, is leading a faculty

advisory committee tasked with
evaluating Applied Sciences NYC
and advising the University.
"There's a number of synergies
available with various local indus
tries ranging from the financial
community to media to opportuni
ties to get involved in sustainable
urban studies that don't exist here,"
Dally said. "Everybody's really ex
cited about using this to prototype
what the university of the future is
really about. As the world becomes
a more global place, it's clear that
universities can't be so tied to one
physical location."
"The biggest challenge is likely
to be making the faculty, students
and staff located in NYC be fully
part of the Stanford community,"
School of Engineering Dean James
Plummer wrote in an email to The
Daily. "We do not want to create a
separate entity. We want to create a
place that is part of Stanford in
every sense of that word."
Neither Plummer nor Dally were
concerned about the quality of facul
ty or students declining. Both noted
their programs could grow in num
bers without lowering standards
though they said hiring qualified fac
ulty would take longer.
"We're limited by the number of
students we can handle, not by tal
ent," Dally said.
University spokesperson Lisa
Lapin said departments around
campus have been working on the
final proposal, which she antici
pates will be over 100 pages.
In the Big Apple
NYCEDC said it received 18
proposals from 27 institutions in
March (many proposals are from
consortia).
According to the July 19 RFP,
NYCEDC prefers that any institu
tion based outside the United
States partner with an institution
inside the U.S. Seven of the 18 pro
posals were from non-U.S. institu
tions.

Additionally, institutions do not
need to have responded in March in
order to reply to the RFP provided
that they rank highly enough in aca
demically relevant fields, have an
endowment greater than $1 billion
or comparable financial backing
from a government and spend more
than $75 million annually on re

search in the applicable fields.
Formal proposals are due Oct.
28. NYCEDC will lead a committee
to select the winner based on crite
ria outlined in the RFP.

Forty percent of the decision is
dependent on the proposal's "eco
nomic impact and feasibility," in
cluding the quality of the proposal
and the estimated economic impact
on New York City. Stanford's
March proposal, "Stanford Univer
sity and New York City: Silicon
Valley II," appears to align closely
with the city's demands.
"A key goal for the NYC campus
would be to have a program to men
tor and assist faculty and students in
forming new ventures," the Stan
ford proposal reads. "To that end,
Stanford proposes to have in resi
dence on the NYC campus at least
one faculty member who has been
intimately involved —as a
founder, early-stage advisor and
board member, or investor —in
the creation of a more than $5OO
million startup."
An additional 40 percent will be
based on "respondent's qualifica
tions and track record," including
institutional quality and track
record in fundraising and on similar
projects.

Lapin stated that no one has
raised more money than Stanford
in the past eight years.
"There's nobody in the running
that's better than us," she said. "On
every measure, we're out ahead
there."

The final 20 percent is "institu
tional connections to the city,"
based on the proposal's potential
ties to the community, sustainabili
ty and hiring/workforce develop
ment.

"We have very active communi
ty partnerships here and would ex
pect the same in New York," Lapin
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We
already have numerous connec
tions in NYC. And our preliminary
designs call for an open campus and
a park-like setting that would inte
grate the university with the com
munity."

The Competition
Several of the respondents have
experience with multiple campuses.
New York City Deputy Mayor
for Economics Robert Steel has
cited Cornell University's $630 mil
lion Manhattan medical school as a
precedent for Applied Sciences
NYC. The New York school has
been one of the most aggressive re
spondents in lobbying for
Bloomberg's selection. They have
reportedly hired a lobbyist and a
public relations firm for their pitch,
and university President David
Skorton made his own sales pitch in
a July 11th You Tube video.
New York University has estab
lished a campus in Abu Dhabi that
NYU Vice President for Public Af
fairs John Beckman called "enor
mously successful." Beckman
added that "our relevant experi
ence is not limited to NYU Abu
Dhabi" and that NYU and its con
sortium partners "have experience
at how to get things done here."

NYU is also in the process of es
tablishing a new campus in Shang
hai.

However, not all multiple-cam
pus endeavors have been success
ful. Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has a Silicon Valley campus
that some at Stanford heed as a
warning.

"One real danger is that Stan
ford will do something and it will be
like the CMU effort in Silicon Val
ley, which I regard as a complete
failure," Dally said. "Maybe they
make some money off of it, but it's
not a replication of the excellent
computer science program CMU
has in Pittsburgh. It's a third-rate
educational establishment, and it
takes in people who couldn't get
into anywhere better. We don't
want that to happen."
Despite Stanford's lack of a de
gree-granting campus away from
the Farm, the University believes
its proposal does have credibility.
"What we would be doing in New

York isn't anywhere near the magni
tude of the construction we've had,"
Lapin said. "We're just about to re
place our hospital. We do big pro
jects. And we do them well, and we
can absolutely execute."

Race to October

Many insiders have pegged Cor
nell and Stanford as the leaders for
the selection.

Multiple references by
Bloomberg and the media to Sili
con Valley as the template for Ap
plied Sciences NYC bode well for
Stanford's chances.

"During the 1980s and '9os, Silicon
Valley not New York be
came the world capital of technolo
gy start-ups," Bloomberg said in his
July 19 speech. "And that is still
true today. But if I am right and
if we succeed in this mission it
won't be true forever."
