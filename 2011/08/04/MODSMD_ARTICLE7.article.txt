# Q&A: Incoming Cantor Arts Center Director Connie Wolf
## 
### MICHAEL TUSCHMAN INTERN 
The Iris & B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts has ap
pointed Connie Wolf 'Bl its new
director; she will replace current
director Thomas Seligman when
he retires Dec. 31 after 20 years at
the helm of the museum.
Wolf left Stanford with a bach
elor's degree in East Asian studies
with a focus in art history and has
been working in the arts ever
since. For the past 13 years, she led
the San Francisco Contemporary
Jewish Museum, which grew from
a 2,500-square-foot building to a
63,000-square-foot museum
under her leadership.
The Daily spoke with Wolf
about her new position at Cantor.

The Stanford Daily (TSD): How
has your time at the Contempo
rary Jewish Museum prepared
you for your upcoming role at the
Cantor Arts Center?

Connie Wolf (CW):: I really feel
like the past 13 years have given
me great insight into thinking
about the role that museums
play in this community. I look
forward to going to the Cantor,
where I can bring some of my
experiences working with
artists, working with the broad
er community, developing pro
jects with scholars and find new
ways of thinking about that ex
traordinary collection and the
legacy of the Cantor. I take an
interdisciplinary approach to
art, and it's something that I feel
is really exciting and dynamic
for an audience in thinking
about the way in which different
disciplines can be, can provide
new lenses into thinking about
art and ideas.

TSD: What do you see as Can
tor's greatest strengths?
CW: Well, I think some of the
greatest strengths is that it is real
ly an extraordinary museum with
a very strong reputation. It's got
great collections, and it has a very
dedicated and loyal group of
members and volunteers that I
find really impressive and exciting
to work with. You've got this in
credible facility, you've got this
amazing collection and you've got
this great group of people who are

loyal and dedicated and commit
ted to the arts through the Cantor.
That's a great combination.

TSD: Are there some weak
nesses you think need to be ad
dressed?
CW: I wouldn't call them weak
nesses. I think there are a couple
of opportunities looking forward,
because I think what's exciting to
me is the way in which there is
going to be sort of a new arts cor
ridor ... So, the way in which the
Cantor can be a centerpiece and
provide linkages to all of these
and be a real meeting point, I
think that is something that is re
ally exciting and something that
can really be a centerpiece to how
the arts are accessed and used on
campus and beyond.

TSD: Do you have any favorite
exhibits or pieces at Cantor?
CW:I 've always been so moved
by the work of Eadweard Muy
bridge, the photographer that Le
land Stanford was really a big sup
porter of, and I know that Cantor
really has a very strong collection.
Museums can never show every
thing that is in their collection. So,
what I'm excited about is learning
from the curators about what
treasures there are that we don't
often get to see, don't often get to
be seen by the public.

TSD: Are there any new artistic
directions you would hope to see
the museum take over the next
years?
CW:Well, I think that it's going
on a great path. But, for exam
ple, I want to be thinking more
innovatively about technology
and figuring out ways to connect
what's happening in the museum
to other departments around
campus and other ways of think
ing. I'm looking forward to just
learning more about what's
going differently on campus now
than when I was a student and
really just finding ways [to ex
plore] the values of Stanford
University: innovation, bold
ness, creativity, entrepreneur
ship. Those characteristics will
be embodied by the Cantor in its
next chapter.
