## Online tracking report prompts scrutiny of online advertising industry's promises 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
Two recent reports from Stanford Security Lab
(SSL) researchers have fueled an ongoing debate over
privacy issues in the largely self-regulated online adver
tising industry.

The findings, released June 12 and June 19, respec
tively stated that some online advertising companies
contradict their privacy policies after consumers choose
to "opt-out" of tracking and that Epic Marketplace, an
other online advertising firm, was "history stealing"
from users. All the agencies involved participate in the
Network Advertising Initiative, a cooperative of online
advertisers that has self-regulated the industry since
1999.

"[One] reason I think self-regulation is falling apart
is that we identified eight companies with privacy poli
cies that might be interpreted to be in conflict with their
current business practices," said Jonathan Mayer, a sec
ond-year graduate student in computer science and law,
who is on the SSL research team and authored the two
reports. "It's important to note that these are privacy

representations that the companies chose to make
themselves beyond what NAI requires."
Epic Marketplace did not respond to requests for
comment but decried the bias of the term "history steal
ing" in a blog post, writing, "this type of data collection
occurs in virtually every web transaction."
According to Mayer's report, Epic Marketplace uses
a number of quick and complex algorithms that deter
mine whether users have visited specific sites, like
Groupon and Starbucks. It even searches for specific
history, like viewing pages about pregnancy and fertili
ty at the Mayo Clinic or bad credit and debt relief at the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
NIA, which also did not respond to requests for com
ment, requires its members to stop delivering ads target
ed to the consumer based on his browsing patterns when
he opts out; it does not require them to cease "third
party tracking," which involves collecting information
like the quantitative effectiveness of the ad or whether
agencies delivered the number of ads their clients
