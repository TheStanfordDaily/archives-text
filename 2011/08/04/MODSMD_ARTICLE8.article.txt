## Online tracking report prompts scrutiny of online advertising industry's promises 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
Two recent reports from Stanford Security Lab
(SSL) researchers have fueled an ongoing debate over
privacy issues in the largely self-regulated online adver
tising industry.

The findings, released June 12 and June 19, respec
tively stated that some online advertising companies
contradict their privacy policies after consumers choose
to "opt-out" of tracking and that Epic Marketplace, an
other online advertising firm, was "history stealing"
from users. All the agencies involved participate in the
Network Advertising Initiative, a cooperative of online
advertisers that has self-regulated the industry since
1999.

"[One] reason I think self-regulation is falling apart
is that we identified eight companies with privacy poli
cies that might be interpreted to be in conflict with their
current business practices," said Jonathan Mayer, a sec
ond-year graduate student in computer science and law,
who is on the SSL research team and authored the two
reports. "It's important to note that these are privacy

representations that the companies chose to make
themselves beyond what NAI requires."
Epic Marketplace did not respond to requests for
comment but decried the bias of the term "history steal
ing" in a blog post, writing, "this type of data collection
occurs in virtually every web transaction."
According to Mayer's report, Epic Marketplace uses
a number of quick and complex algorithms that deter
mine whether users have visited specific sites, like
Groupon and Starbucks. It even searches for specific
history, like viewing pages about pregnancy and fertili
ty at the Mayo Clinic or bad credit and debt relief at the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
NIA, which also did not respond to requests for com
ment, requires its members to stop delivering ads target
ed to the consumer based on his browsing patterns when
he opts out; it does not require them to cease "third
party tracking," which involves collecting information
like the quantitative effectiveness of the ad or whether
agencies delivered the number of ads their clients

agreed upon. There is no clear con
sensus between ad agencies, privacy
watchdogs or regulators about what
tracking means or what opting out
entails.

"Tracking refers to recording in
formation so that somebody can
link together activities by the same
user over time," said Edward Fel
ten, chief technologist at the FTC.
Peter Eckersley, senior staff
technologist at the Electronic Fron
tier Foundation, a watchdog group
that campaigns for public rights in
the digital arena, explained the ad
industry's conflict about opting out.
"The industry has two radically
different notions of what 'opt out'
means," Eckersley said. "One no
tion is that it means, 'We'll stop col
lecting records about you that we
can use to track you' the other
definition is 'We'll just stop target
ing ads based on the tracking we've
done.'"

"It would be a mistake to write a
piece of legislation that defines
third-party tracking," Eckersley
added. "The better way would be to
have an ongoing process for revis
ing the definition. We know tech
nology will evolve,"
As for current legislation, "there
is no existing law at the federal level
that relates to online advertising or
third-party tracking," Felton said.
Legislation has been introduced
in California and at the federal level
that would respectively give the
state Attorney General's office and
FTC rule-making responsibilities,
but nothing has been enacted.
"If the federal government were
going to play a constructive role, [it
should] create incentives for re
specting consumer choice and for
developing and respecting privacy
enhancing technologies," Eckersley
said.

Omar Tawakol, CEO of
BlueKai, an online advertising com
pany and NAI member that took

overt steps to honor consumer opt
out requests, illustrated the dilem
ma the industry faces.
"If you asked the consumer,
'Do you want to get rid of advertis
ing in your content?' They'd say
yes. If you asked them, 'Do you
want to pay for the content?'
They'd say no. Eighty percent [of
content] is funded by some use of
third-party cookie."
Felten, Mayer, Tawakol and oth
ers representing online advertising
and privacy interests attended
WiTap, "Workshop on Internet
Tracking, Advertising and Priva
cy," hosted at Stanford by SSL on
July 22.
Both Felten and Mayer spoke at
the event, which was planned eight
months before Mayer's reports and
addressed technical challenges in
the industry and promoted research
in the field. About 150 hundred
people attended.
"The main consensus [reached
was] that privacy on the web ...

needs more research on both the
technical and policy fronts," wrote
Dan Boneh, professor of computer
science and electrical engineering
and one of the workshop's organiz
ers, in an email to The Daily.
With regard to action resulting
from the two reports, Felten said the
FTC never reveals whether it is per
forming investigations but did ad
dress the technical ambiguities sur
rounding Mayer's charge of "history
stealing" by Epic Marketplace.
"[Epic] has objected to the term
'history stealing,' but the question is
whether there's a dispute about the
technical details of what's happen
ing or not," Felten said.
Eckersley thought the issue was
clear regardless of technicalities.
"People are interested in
whether these companies they've
never heard of are sucking up all
their reading habits like a giant vac
uum cleaner or a creepy guy in the li
brary looking over your shoulder at
everything you're reading," he said.
