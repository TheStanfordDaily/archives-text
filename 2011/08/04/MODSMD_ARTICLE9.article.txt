## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN America: A Model, I diot? 
### Miles Unterreiner 
You know things are getting bad when
your country starts acting like Derek
Zoolander.

And, as demonstrated by last week's com
ical congressional break-dance fighting over
raising the debt ceiling, that's precisely what
we're doing. Like everyone's favorite direc
tionally challenged male model, our nation
just can't turn left because every time we
reach a crucial political corner, we seem to
substitute three 90-degree turns to the right in
stead.

So Earth to Matil, er, America: it might fi
nally be time to switch things up, because Con
gress barely averting fiscal Armageddon this
week was only the opening scene in what's
looking increasingly like a horrendously bad
remake of the movie we all used to love.

Take, for example, the energy sector,
where Americans continue to burn through
terrorist-funding foreign oil as enthusiastical
ly as if President Barack Obama had proposed
a national gasoline fight. Absurd government
subsidies to Big Oil, America's addiction to
colossal, definitely-compensating-for-some
thing cars and our apparent desire to prop up
repeat Worst-Country-in-the-World-Award-
Winner Saudi Arabia all add up to us going up
in spectacular flames faster than a bunch of
male models sipping orange mocha Frappuc
cinos.

Or take a quick look at education, where
our schools are rapidly degenerating into
"Centers for Kids Who Can't Read Good"
(note to Secretary of Education Arne Dun
can: our education budget should be at least.
.. three times this big). Once a world leader in
education, America is now faltering as up
and-coming Hansels all over the world happi
ly compete for the Model-Nation-of-the-Year
crown we seem to be leaving behind. Depress
ingly, for instance, American 15 year olds
scored just about average in reading and sci
ence (and below average in math) among
their OECD peers on 2009's Program for In
ternational Student Assessment (PISA).
Crushed by Shanghai (so hot right now), out
performed by Finland and soundly trounced
by South Korea, the United States did at least
outscore Kyrgyzstan and Albania not real
ly an achievement to write home about.
Meanwhile, as China feverishly extends
transcontinental high-speed rail lines from
Tibet to Beijing, our transportation infrastruc
ture is looking increasingly like something out
of a Derelicte catalogue. Discouragingly, the
American Society of Civil Engineers gave us
an abysmal overall grade of D on its most re

cent Report Card for America's Infrastruc
ture, with subscores as low as D- in drinking
water quality and wastewater disposal. (Note:
"Water is the essence of life!") The ASCE es
timates that an astonishing $2.2 trillion would
be required to bring the nation up to speed
$2.2 trillion we clearly don't have. One partic
ularly painful example: thanks to budget
shortfalls in several states, many state-main
tained roads were actually unpaved this year
to save on maintenance costs, converted from
expensive asphalt into cheaper gravel or dirt.
For perhaps the first time ever, we are actual
ly un-building America.
And as if energy, education and infrastruc
ture weren't depressing enough, the national
debt is currently really, really, ridiculously bad
looking to the tune of $14.3 trillion. At this
rate, even Speaker of the House John Boehn
er and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
miraculously managing to pull Congress' un
derwear out of its pants during this week's par
tisan walk-off may not be enough to save So
cial Security, Medicare, military salaries or the
national park system in the long run.
But instead of one simple turn to the left
raising taxes on the super-rich, along with
painful but necessary cuts in discretionary
spending to help pay for long-term investment
in education, infrastructure and energy
hard-line Republicans have been insisting on
three spins to the right: no tax increases; sharp
cuts in programs for the poor, old and sick; and
nearly risking a catastrophic default in the
name of doctrinaire ideology.
Ultimately, it's going to take decisive, com
mitted, "ambi-turning" leadership to fix our
nation's problems which is why we origi
nally elected you, Obama.
But since that glorious acceptance speech
in Grant Park, honestly, I've been a little dis
appointed with that new look you promised to
bring to America. Sure, we saw a little bit of Le
Tigre when you took out Osama Bin Laden
but where was the hardened, presidential
voice of Blue Steel during the "Ground Zero
Mosque" debacle or last week's debate on the
debt? And where was Ferrari when we need
ed to get health care fixed fast?
So when 2012 shows up, Mr. President,
we'd all love it if you'd finally break out Mag
num and freeze the insidious Republican
ninja star in midair. It would save a lot more
than the prime minister of Malaysia; it would
save our country from itself.
