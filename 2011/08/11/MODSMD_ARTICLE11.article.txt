## I Do CHOOSE TO RUN Human Rights (Double)talk 
### Miles Unterreiner 
To the four governmental bodies that
belie their names in his dystopian novel
"1984" the Ministry of Love, which
oversees torture; the Ministry of Peace, which
conducts war; the Ministry of Plenty, which ra
tions food; and the Ministry of Truth, which
disseminates lies George Orwell could
have appended a fifth: the United Nations
Human Rights Council, among whose mem
bers are several of the worst human rights vio
lators in the world. Until structural deficien
cies in the process for electing council mem
bers are addressed, the HRC will continue to
languish in a perpetual state of doublethink,
hamstrung by a voting bloc of governments
whose domestic policies consistently abrogate
the very human rights the council was intend
ed to protect.
Let's begin by taking a quick look at four of
the current members of the council: Saudi
Arabia, Cuba, China and Russia.
The Saudi Arabian state became a vigorous
human rights defender right about the time
slavery became freedom and war became
peace. One of very few governments never to
sign the U.N.'s 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights the basic charter of funda
mental freedoms on which the council itself is
based the Kingdom does not allow women
to drive; punishes homosexuality and other
nonviolent "crimes" by flogging, forced ampu
tation or death (often carried out by public be
heading and crucifixion); and forbids any kind
of religious worship other than the puritanical,
state-sponsored brand of Sunni Islam. Politi
cally, the country is an absolute monarchy
ruled jointly by royal decree and religious ju
risprudence. No political parties or elections
are allowed, prompting The Economist to
label the Saudi government the seventh most
authoritarian in the world. The harsh medieval
legal code is enforced by a secretive state secu
rity apparatus frequently accused of torture by
international human rights groups, while
breaches of "public decency" are handled by
the infamous morality police, or mutaween.
(The mutaween are perhaps most well known
for their 2002 decision to prevent a crowd of
frightened schoolgirls from fleeing a burning
building because they were not wearing head
scarves, causing 15 children to burn to death).
Meanwhile, fellow Human Rights Council
member Cuba continues to live up to its well
deserved reputation as the worst human rights
violator in the Western Hemisphere. Recently
characterized by Human Rights Watch
(HRW) as "a Latin American anomaly: an un
democratic government that represses nearly

all forms of political dissent," the Castro
regime continues to squelch all forms of politi
cal discussion with a ferocity unrivaled west of
the Atlantic. In its 2006 report, HRW noted
that "Cubans are systematically denied basic
rights to free expression, association, assem
bly, privacy, movement and due process of
law" under a repressive system perhaps most
famous for jailing journalists and free-speech
advocates. (Cuba, in fact, jails more journalists
than any other nation on earth with the ex
ception of fellow Human Rights Council
member China. But we'll get to that in a mo
ment.) While recent reforms have slightly re
laxed Cuba's decidedly Big-Brother-like polit
ical atmosphere, granting the regime a contin
ued spot on the world's highest human rights
body still looks painfully like appointing
Bernie Madoff to a financial ethics commis
sion.

But for a particularly Orwellian twist, we
need look no further than the notoriously
opaque government of the People's Republic
of China, which recently outdid itself by
retroactively censoring already-printed mater
ial about the high-speed rail wreck that killed
40 and injured 192 this month. The New York
Times reports that Party bureaucrats in Bei
jing, determined to prevent coverage of the
embarrassing incident, forced editors at major
papers to "frantically tear up pages of their Sat
urday editions, replacing investigative articles
and commentaries about the accident... with
cartoons or unrelated features." Unfortunate
ly, this particularly egregious instance of cen
sorship is perfectly in character for a one-party
regime that regularly restricts its own citizens'
Internet freedom, jailed political activists like
Nobel Prize-winner Liu Xiaobo and conducts
most government business behind a veil of se
crecy and suspicion.
Ditto for the Russian Federation, which,
while currently the least offensive of these par
ticular four horsemen, looks to complete its
slide backward into Soviet-style despotism
sometime around Vladimir Putin's next birth
day. While investigative journalists in China
get thrown in prison for reporting the news,
their equivalents in Russia simply disappear
into black vans, never to be seen again. Given
a "Not Free" rating by Freedom House the
human rights organization's worst classifica
tion Russia frequently votes against sanc
tioning violators like North Korea, Myanmar
and Sudan not to mention, of course, Cuba,
China and Saudi Arabia.
