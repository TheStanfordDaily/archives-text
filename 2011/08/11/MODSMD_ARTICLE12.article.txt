# LETTERS FROM THE DRAGONLANDS
## Five things I love about Asia 
### Aysha Kureishi 
Singlish, Peranakan and dragons are a few of
the many adventures I've encountered in
Asia. To document everything in seven
columns would be impossible. I have contem
plated Kiasu, slapped on sunscreen after losing
my face and argued in two different versions of
English. I have discovered Peranakan, reflected
on my identity as a Third-Culture Kid and tried
to fly high with dragons. But there are still so
many things that I love about this grand conti
nent that I could write for a century. So, in a teary
farewell from the Dragonlands, I present to you
(in no particular order) 5 things I love about
Asia.

1. Girl Power

Asia continues to applaud female leaders. Nobel
Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has ac
tively and loyally fought for Burmese democra
cy for over two decades, locked away in house
arrest for most of the time. Rivals Sheik Hasina
Wazed and Khaleda Zai have fought political
battles over the position of Bangladeshi prime
minister, and both are women. The first woman
to rise to power in the West was Margaret
Thatcher, when she became the prime minister
of Great Britain in 1979. In contrast, Asia put out
its first female leader a decade earlier in 1960
Sri Lankan leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The
U.S. and Canada have yet to have a female pres
ident or prime minister. And most recently, the
world extends its congratulations to Yingluck
Shinawatra, who just became Thailand's first fe
male prime minister.

2. Playing the Qin in Front of a Cow and Falling
From a Tree into a Boat with the Bark Peeling Off

Idioms exist in a language for a reason. They are
flowery metaphors sprinkled throughout our
speech that create an image to express some
thing that other words can't quite encompass.
But they do more than communicate an idea
they also communicate quite a bit of culture.
Asian idioms are so diverse and so steeped in
stories that they immediately brighten any
rhetoric. In China, to say one is playing the qin in
front of a cow is to say one is wasting one's ef
forts. When the Japanese assert that "even mon
keys fall from trees," they actually mean that
even the experts can get it wrong. An exclama
tion of "it's a carrot!" in Korean is another way

of saying "of course!" In Hindi, to say one is "ex
creting embers" means one is extremely angry.
In the Philippines, "itchy feet" can be cured with
a bus ticket, not an anti-fungal cream, because to
have "itchy feet" is to have the urge to travel.
The Western metaphor of "going to the dogs"
would be figuratively translated in Kashmiri as,
"it's a drifting boat with the bark peeling off."

3. Everything is Possible (With Terms and Con
ditions)

When I was house hunting in China, my realtor
told me if there was one thing I needed to know
before moving to Asia, it was that anything (and
literally, anything) is possible. It's just a matter of
"how much." That is, how much you're willing to
pay for it. After many years in Asia, I have come
to realize that it's not just about the money. Asia
is rising in gold and wealth, but if anything, it is
full to bursting with motivation and enthusiasm.
If someone in the West tells you a corporate
analysis can't be completed by the end of the
week, someone in the East will have it done with
a bow on top within the next hour. The kiasu
capitalist mentality of trying to get ahead has en
gulfed Asia in one large, nationalistic movement
of competing and surpassing the West. Asia's
rise is actually a large comeback a resurrec
tion spurred by Asian motivation.

4. Color, Color Everywhere

Wherever you look, a rainbow inundation will
deluge you. Walk through the streets of China
and you'll see the bright red lanterns hanging on
threads of ivory yellow. In Japan, the springtime
cherry blossoms cover the land in a soft snow of vi
brant cotton-candy pink and contrast strongly
with the black of the wood after a spring rain. All
the spices, silks, dyes and seeds in the market
places of India are an artist's dream Tyrian
purples, peacock blues, cinnamon crimsons and
bright daffodil yellows are only a few of the colors
that you not only see, but taste, feel and hear at the
same time. In the forests of Borneo and Indone
sia, foliage of the finest green jade grows from the
caramel earth, and the sudden explosion of a bird
breaking through the foliage seems like an acci
dental splash of bright color on a painter's perfect
green canvas. The colors of Asia are so easy to
brush over, but they are the introduction to a ma
jestic world of culture and vibrancy.

5. Unusual Occurrences on a Daily Basis

In Asia, be prepared for the unknown. Every
day is an adventure, and every day, something

unusual will happen to you. Be it dis
covering a shopkeeper who knew
the last emperor of China or a turtle
showing up in a backyard pool or

even a monkey creeping into your
house to steal your watermelons,
surprises abound in Asia. These sur
prises are what make Asian life col
orful and exciting. There's a whole
continent out there waiting to be ex
plored, waiting to teach you. Innu
merable cultures and innumerable
lands are waiting for you to take their
hands so that they can introduce you

to a world you had no idea existed.
Countless roads of adventures lay in
wait. Now it's up to you to decide
which road to take. Asia tells you to
choose wisely, and good luck.

pay for it. After many years in Asia, I have come
to realize that it's not just about the money. Asia
is rising in gold and wealth, but if anything, it is
full to bursting with motivation and enthusiasm.
If someone in the West tells you a corporate
analysis can't be completed by the end of the
week, someone in the East will have it done with
a bow on top within the next hour. The kiasu
capitalist mentality of trying to get ahead has en
gulfed Asia in one large, nationalistic movement
of competing and surpassing the West. Asia's
rise is actually a large comeback a resurrec
tion spurred by Asian motivation.

4. Color, Color Everywhere

Wherever you look, a rainbow inundation will
deluge you. Walk through the streets of China
and you'll see the bright red lanterns hanging on
threads of ivory yellow. In Japan, the springtime
cherry blossoms cover the land in a soft snow of vi
brant cotton-candy pink and contrast strongly
with the black of the wood after a spring rain. All
the spices, silks, dyes and seeds in the market
places of India are an artist's dream Tyrian
purples, peacock blues, cinnamon crimsons and
bright daffodil yellows are only a few of the colors
that you not only see, but taste, feel and hear at the
same time. In the forests of Borneo and Indone
sia, foliage of the finest green jade grows from the
caramel earth, and the sudden explosion of a bird
breaking through the foliage seems like an acci
dental splash of bright color on a painter's perfect
green canvas. The colors of Asia are so easy to
brush over, but they are the introduction to a ma
jestic world of culture and vibrancy.

5. Unusual Occurrences on a Daily Basis

In Asia, be prepared for the unknown. Every
day is an adventure, and every day, something

unusual will happen to you. Be it dis
covering a shopkeeper who knew
the last emperor of China or a turtle
showing up in a backyard pool or

even a monkey creeping into your
house to steal your watermelons,
surprises abound in Asia. These sur
prises are what make Asian life col
orful and exciting. There's a whole
continent out there waiting to be ex
plored, waiting to teach you. Innu
merable cultures and innumerable
lands are waiting for you to take their
hands so that they can introduce you

to a world you had no idea existed.
Countless roads of adventures lay in
wait. Now it's up to you to decide
which road to take. Asia tells you to
choose wisely, and good luck.

Singlish, Peranakan and dragons are a few of
the many adventures I've encountered in
Asia. To document everything in seven
columns would be impossible. I have contem
plated Kiasu, slapped on sunscreen after losing
my face and argued in two different versions of
English. I have discovered Peranakan, reflected
on my identity as a Third-Culture Kid and tried
to fly high with dragons. But there are still so
many things that I love about this grand conti
nent that I could write for a century. So, in a teary
farewell from the Dragonlands, I present to you
(in no particular order) 5 things I love about
Asia.

1. Girl Power

Asia continues to applaud female leaders. Nobel
Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has ac
tively and loyally fought for Burmese democra
cy for over two decades, locked away in house
arrest for most of the time. Rivals Sheik Hasina
Wazed and Khaleda Zai have fought political
battles over the position of Bangladeshi prime
minister, and both are women. The first woman
to rise to power in the West was Margaret
Thatcher, when she became the prime minister
of Great Britain in 1979. In contrast, Asia put out
its first female leader a decade earlier in 1960
Sri Lankan leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The
U.S. and Canada have yet to have a female pres
ident or prime minister. And most recently, the
world extends its congratulations to Yingluck
Shinawatra, who just became Thailand's first fe
male prime minister.

2. Playing the Qin in Front of a Cow and Falling
From a Tree into a Boat with the Bark Peeling Off

Idioms exist in a language for a reason. They are
flowery metaphors sprinkled throughout our
speech that create an image to express some
thing that other words can't quite encompass.
But they do more than communicate an idea
they also communicate quite a bit of culture.
Asian idioms are so diverse and so steeped in
stories that they immediately brighten any
rhetoric. In China, to say one is playing the qin in
front of a cow is to say one is wasting one's ef
forts. When the Japanese assert that "even mon
keys fall from trees," they actually mean that
even the experts can get it wrong. An exclama
tion of "it's a carrot!" in Korean is another way

of saying "of course!" In Hindi, to say one is "ex
creting embers" means one is extremely angry.
In the Philippines, "itchy feet" can be cured with
a bus ticket, not an anti-fungal cream, because to
have "itchy feet" is to have the urge to travel.
The Western metaphor of "going to the dogs"
would be figuratively translated in Kashmiri as,
"it's a drifting boat with the bark peeling off."

3. Everything is Possible (With Terms and Con
ditions)

When I was house hunting in China, my realtor
told me if there was one thing I needed to know
before moving to Asia, it was that anything (and
literally, anything) is possible. It's just a matter of
"how much." That is, how much you're willing to
pay for it. After many years in Asia, I have come
to realize that it's not just about the money. Asia
is rising in gold and wealth, but if anything, it is
full to bursting with motivation and enthusiasm.
If someone in the West tells you a corporate
analysis can't be completed by the end of the
week, someone in the East will have it done with
a bow on top within the next hour. The kiasu
capitalist mentality of trying to get ahead has en
gulfed Asia in one large, nationalistic movement
of competing and surpassing the West. Asia's
rise is actually a large comeback a resurrec
tion spurred by Asian motivation.
