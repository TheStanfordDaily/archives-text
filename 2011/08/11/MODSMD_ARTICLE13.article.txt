## STANFORD FOOTBALL POSITION PREVIEW 2011 BACKS INTACT, LINE REBUILDS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SPORTS EDITOR 
If you went looking for running back Antho
ny Wilkerson in the waning moments of Stan
ford's close win over Arizona State last Novem
ber, you'd find him taking a seat.
He wasn't injured or surrounded by training
staff. Nor was he in the stands to watch the action
after the Cardinal went ahead 17-13 with just
minutes to play. Instead, he was inbounds on the
Sun Devils' 4-yard line, with the ball in his hands
and not a defender in sight.

After breaking free from 23 yards out with
just over 1:30 remaining, the freshman planted
himself on the turf to ice the game, passing up
what would've surely been just the third touch
down of his collegiate career. Several offensive
linemen, quarterback Andrew Luck and then
head coach Jim Harbaugh met him with friendly
embraces on his way back to the bench, thanking
him for doing the unselfish thing.
And for Cardinal running backs, that's just
business as usual.

To account for the departure of Heisman
Trophy runner-up Toby Gerhart, Stanford
coaches instituted a running back by committee
last year, with five players splitting carries on a
consistent basis. While Gerhart took over 80 per
cent of the handoffs in 2009, the Cardinal's lead
ing rusher last year rising junior Stepfan Tay
lor only took half.

"It's not a selfish group of backs, and that's
what I love about it," Taylor said. "We all have
better talents in certain situations, and the coach
es know that we're unselfish players."
Stanford's group of backs Taylor, Wilker
son, junior Tyler Gaffney, redshirt senior Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt sophomore Usua Amanam
ended up totaling more yardage in 2010 than
Gerhart alone had the year before. And of the
five, only Amanam, who has since been convert
ed to corner, will not be in the backfield again this
year.
So as the Cardinal moves into training camp,
playing time must be earned yet again, even by
the man who led the squad on the ground last
season.
"Our system makes us all compete," Taylor
said. "You can't take a day off because we all
know everybody's gunning for the spot. But we
help each other... we're all working together to
help the team."

That ideal is epitomized perhaps best of all by
Stewart. After finishing a close second on the
team in rushing behind Anthony Kimble in 2007
when he also played a big role down the
stretch in Stanford's memorable upset over USC
he had to take a back seat to Gerhart for two
years. Ever since, he has been plagued by injury,
never coming close to making a full comeback
after the season mark of 359 rushing yards he set
his freshman year.

Stewart showed some flashes of brilliance in
last year's Orange Bowl, including a 60-yard run
that opened the scoring for the Cardinal. But
fresh in his head are the days when even making
a bowl was out of the picture, a perspective that's
unique on a squad with only two players that saw
game action in 2007.

"My first year here was just after they went 1-
11, so a lot of people took us as a game off," Stew
art said. "It's definitely a lot different now, with
us coming out ranked whatever we are in the
country, so I think a lot of teams are going to be

gunning for us."
Regardless, Stanford's multi-tooled running
game won't be easy for opponents to handle. The
speed of Taylor and Wilkerson who finished
second on the team in rushing after a surprising
first season contrasts well with the power style
of Stewart and Gaffney.

Though there are few questions at running
back, they abound elsewhere. Most notable is the
loss of fullback Owen Marecic, the lynchpin of
the Cardinal rushing attack for the last three
years.

"The day I got here, watching him and seeing
his work ethic, he was like my hero," Taylor said.
"Owen's Owen. He's just that guy."

Known for his mane of blond hair and his
hard-nosed athleticism on both sides of the ball,
Marecic paved the way for Gerhart and Taylor's
success on the ground. His blocking was so effec
tive that the Cardinal faithful had good cause for

worry about the run game coming
into this season.
Stanford fans had to do a double
take, however, when a fullback with
curly yellow hair strode out to play
for the Cardinal at this year's spring
game. As Marecic's understudy, red
shirt sophomore Ryan Hewitt flew
almost entirely under the radar de
spite playing in all 13 games last sea
son. He'll see his fair share of the
spotlight this year, though, as the
strong favorite to take over for the
Cleveland Browns' recent fourth
round pick.
"Hewitt, coming into spring, sur
prised a lot of fans," Taylor said. "In
side the team, we knew that he was
just as good as Marecic... Hewitt
came in as a tight end and is stepping
up in the fullback position, where he

has to go head to head against line
men and linebackers every time.
That shows he loves the game."
And how does the hair compare?
"I think Marecic just cut his, so I
might as well go with Hewitt," Stew
art said.

Hewitt's skillset and his curly
locks might just be a perfect fit.
Yet the supporting cast's personnel
turnover extends far beyond full
back. The offensive line, nicknamed
the "Tunnel Workers Union" by for
mer left guard Chris Marinelli in 2009
because it "opens up holes," ironical
ly sports some of the deepest ones on
the team, thanks to the departure of
three elite offensive linemen. Ail-
American center Chase Beeler, right
tackle Derek Hall and left guard An
drew Phillips combined for 81 starts
on the Farm, but now leave seniors
David DeCastro and Jonathan Mar
tin to rebuild the Cardinal's tunnel
digging mechanisms.
"I think that their leadership and
experience were huge," DeCastro

said. "They started a lot of games for
us. They knew what they were doing.
A lot of times you could depend on
them if you needed a call, maybe a
slip or something like that, and now
it's kind of turned on me and
Jonathan."

Besides its superb run blocking,
the old line allowed just six sacks, the
second lowest total in the nation. De-
Castro attributes much of that suc
cess to Luck's speed and the blocking
done by backs and receivers.
However eager the returning line
men may be to deflect the credit, they
have earned national acclaim head
ing into the season. DeCastro, con
sidered a preseason All-American
favorite by many analysts, doesn't
buy into all the hype at least not
completely.
"It's one of the things that you
have to hear and acknowledge and
that you can't just completely ig
nore," he said. "But at the same time,
once you hear it, it goes in one ear and
out the other. All I can do right now is

play to the best of my ability, and I
can't really control all that stuff. All I
can control is how I play."
Some of the open slots still have to
be filled, but leading candidates are
junior Sam Schwartzstein at center,
sophomore Kevin Danser at left
guard and fifth-year senior Tyler
Mabry at right tackle. Getting the
new starters ready will be a team
wide effort.

"We have great offensive linemen
in DeCastro and Martin, so they're
going to help bring those guys up to
speed," Stewart said. "We're going to
step in when we can to help them out,
but we're just focused on everybody
doing their job, and I think we'll be
fine if that happens."

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
As a sophomore, running back Stepfan
Taylor helped maintain the Cardinal's
production on the ground,
even without Heisman Trophy runner-up
Toby Gerhart.
If you went looking for running back Antho
ny Wilkerson in the waning moments of Stan
ford's close win over Arizona State last Novem
ber, you'd find him taking a seat.
He wasn't injured or surrounded by training
staff. Nor was he in the stands to watch the action
after the Cardinal went ahead 17-13 with just
minutes to play. Instead, he was inbounds on the
Sun Devils' 4-yard line, with the ball in his hands
and not a defender in sight.

After breaking free from 23 yards out with
just over 1:30 remaining, the freshman planted
himself on the turf to ice the game, passing up
what would've surely been just the third touch
down of his collegiate career. Several offensive
linemen, quarterback Andrew Luck and then
head coach Jim Harbaugh met him with friendly
embraces on his way back to the bench, thanking
him for doing the unselfish thing.
And for Cardinal running backs, that's just
business as usual.

To account for the departure of Heisman
Trophy runner-up Toby Gerhart, Stanford
coaches instituted a running back by committee
last year, with five players splitting carries on a
consistent basis. While Gerhart took over 80 per
cent of the handoffs in 2009, the Cardinal's lead
ing rusher last year rising junior Stepfan Tay
lor only took half.

"It's not a selfish group of backs, and that's
what I love about it," Taylor said. "We all have
better talents in certain situations, and the coach
es know that we're unselfish players."
Stanford's group of backs Taylor, Wilker
son, junior Tyler Gaffney, redshirt senior Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt sophomore Usua Amanam
ended up totaling more yardage in 2010 than
Gerhart alone had the year before. And of the
five, only Amanam, who has since been convert
ed to corner, will not be in the backfield again this
year.
So as the Cardinal moves into training camp,
playing time must be earned yet again, even by
the man who led the squad on the ground last
season.
"Our system makes us all compete," Taylor
said. "You can't take a day off because we all
know everybody's gunning for the spot. But we
help each other... we're all working together to
help the team."

That ideal is epitomized perhaps best of all by
Stewart. After finishing a close second on the
team in rushing behind Anthony Kimble in 2007
when he also played a big role down the
stretch in Stanford's memorable upset over USC
he had to take a back seat to Gerhart for two
years. Ever since, he has been plagued by injury,
never coming close to making a full comeback
after the season mark of 359 rushing yards he set
his freshman year.

Stewart showed some flashes of brilliance in
last year's Orange Bowl, including a 60-yard run
that opened the scoring for the Cardinal. But
fresh in his head are the days when even making
a bowl was out of the picture, a perspective that's
unique on a squad with only two players that saw
game action in 2007.

"My first year here was just after they went 1-
11, so a lot of people took us as a game off," Stew
art said. "It's definitely a lot different now, with
us coming out ranked whatever we are in the
country, so I think a lot of teams are going to be

gunning for us."
Regardless, Stanford's multi-tooled running
game won't be easy for opponents to handle. The
speed of Taylor and Wilkerson who finished
second on the team in rushing after a surprising
first season contrasts well with the power style
of Stewart and Gaffney.

Though there are few questions at running
back, they abound elsewhere. Most notable is the
loss of fullback Owen Marecic, the lynchpin of
the Cardinal rushing attack for the last three
years.

"The day I got here, watching him and seeing
his work ethic, he was like my hero," Taylor said.
"Owen's Owen. He's just that guy."

Known for his mane of blond hair and his
hard-nosed athleticism on both sides of the ball,
Marecic paved the way for Gerhart and Taylor's
success on the ground. His blocking was so effec
tive that the Cardinal faithful had good cause for

worry about the run game coming
into this season.
Stanford fans had to do a double
take, however, when a fullback with
curly yellow hair strode out to play
for the Cardinal at this year's spring
game. As Marecic's understudy, red
shirt sophomore Ryan Hewitt flew
almost entirely under the radar de
spite playing in all 13 games last sea
son. He'll see his fair share of the
spotlight this year, though, as the
strong favorite to take over for the
Cleveland Browns' recent fourth
round pick.
"Hewitt, coming into spring, sur
prised a lot of fans," Taylor said. "In
side the team, we knew that he was
just as good as Marecic... Hewitt
came in as a tight end and is stepping
up in the fullback position, where he

has to go head to head against line
men and linebackers every time.
That shows he loves the game."
And how does the hair compare?
"I think Marecic just cut his, so I
might as well go with Hewitt," Stew
art said.

Hewitt's skillset and his curly
locks might just be a perfect fit.
Yet the supporting cast's personnel
turnover extends far beyond full
back. The offensive line, nicknamed
the "Tunnel Workers Union" by for
mer left guard Chris Marinelli in 2009
because it "opens up holes," ironical
ly sports some of the deepest ones on
the team, thanks to the departure of
three elite offensive linemen. Ail-
American center Chase Beeler, right
tackle Derek Hall and left guard An
drew Phillips combined for 81 starts
on the Farm, but now leave seniors
David DeCastro and Jonathan Mar
tin to rebuild the Cardinal's tunnel
digging mechanisms.
"I think that their leadership and
experience were huge," DeCastro

said. "They started a lot of games for
us. They knew what they were doing.
A lot of times you could depend on
them if you needed a call, maybe a
slip or something like that, and now
it's kind of turned on me and
Jonathan."

Besides its superb run blocking,
the old line allowed just six sacks, the
second lowest total in the nation. De-
Castro attributes much of that suc
cess to Luck's speed and the blocking
done by backs and receivers.
However eager the returning line
