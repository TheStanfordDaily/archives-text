## STANFORD FOOTBALL POSITION PREVIEW 2011 BACKS INTACT, LINE REBUILDS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA SPORTS EDITOR 
If you went looking for running back Antho
ny Wilkerson in the waning moments of Stan
ford's close win over Arizona State last Novem
ber, you'd find him taking a seat.
He wasn't injured or surrounded by training
staff. Nor was he in the stands to watch the action
after the Cardinal went ahead 17-13 with just
minutes to play. Instead, he was inbounds on the
Sun Devils' 4-yard line, with the ball in his hands
and not a defender in sight.

After breaking free from 23 yards out with
just over 1:30 remaining, the freshman planted
himself on the turf to ice the game, passing up
what would've surely been just the third touch
down of his collegiate career. Several offensive
linemen, quarterback Andrew Luck and then
head coach Jim Harbaugh met him with friendly
embraces on his way back to the bench, thanking
him for doing the unselfish thing.
And for Cardinal running backs, that's just
business as usual.

To account for the departure of Heisman
Trophy runner-up Toby Gerhart, Stanford
coaches instituted a running back by committee
last year, with five players splitting carries on a
consistent basis. While Gerhart took over 80 per
cent of the handoffs in 2009, the Cardinal's lead
ing rusher last year rising junior Stepfan Tay
lor only took half.

"It's not a selfish group of backs, and that's
what I love about it," Taylor said. "We all have
better talents in certain situations, and the coach
es know that we're unselfish players."
Stanford's group of backs Taylor, Wilker
son, junior Tyler Gaffney, redshirt senior Jeremy
Stewart and redshirt sophomore Usua Amanam
ended up totaling more yardage in 2010 than
Gerhart alone had the year before. And of the
five, only Amanam, who has since been convert
ed to corner, will not be in the backfield again this
year.
So as the Cardinal moves into training camp,
playing time must be earned yet again, even by
the man who led the squad on the ground last
season.
"Our system makes us all compete," Taylor
said. "You can't take a day off because we all
know everybody's gunning for the spot. But we
help each other... we're all working together to
help the team."

That ideal is epitomized perhaps best of all by
Stewart. After finishing a close second on the
team in rushing behind Anthony Kimble in 2007
when he also played a big role down the
stretch in Stanford's memorable upset over USC
he had to take a back seat to Gerhart for two
years. Ever since, he has been plagued by injury,
never coming close to making a full comeback
after the season mark of 359 rushing yards he set
his freshman year.

Stewart showed some flashes of brilliance in
last year's Orange Bowl, including a 60-yard run
that opened the scoring for the Cardinal. But
fresh in his head are the days when even making
a bowl was out of the picture, a perspective that's
unique on a squad with only two players that saw
game action in 2007.

"My first year here was just after they went 1-
11, so a lot of people took us as a game off," Stew
art said. "It's definitely a lot different now, with
us coming out ranked whatever we are in the
country, so I think a lot of teams are going to be

gunning for us."
Regardless, Stanford's multi-tooled running
game won't be easy for opponents to handle. The
speed of Taylor and Wilkerson who finished
second on the team in rushing after a surprising
first season contrasts well with the power style
of Stewart and Gaffney.

Though there are few questions at running
back, they abound elsewhere. Most notable is the
loss of fullback Owen Marecic, the lynchpin of
the Cardinal rushing attack for the last three
years.

"The day I got here, watching him and seeing
his work ethic, he was like my hero," Taylor said.
"Owen's Owen. He's just that guy."

Known for his mane of blond hair and his
hard-nosed athleticism on both sides of the ball,
Marecic paved the way for Gerhart and Taylor's
success on the ground. His blocking was so effec
tive that the Cardinal faithful had good cause for


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Running back Stepfan Taylor, shown playing in the Orange Bowl, had a strong sophomore season,
leading the team with 1175 yards on the ground. He's one of four backs returning this year.
