# FOOTBALL MATCHUPS

We're almost halfway
through August, so
there's no denying it
any longer it's
college football sea
son. True, 23 days remain until Stan
ford football kicks off its Andrew Luck
Farewell Tour, but that just means we
all have a bit over three weeks left to
analyze the heck out of the Cardinal's
chances.

Roughly 99.999 percent of the off
season news surrounding Stanford
football has been concentrated on
Luck staying for one more season
(sorry, Class of 2013, it's just one more)
and David Shaw replacing Jim Har
baugh. Yes, coaching changes in col

and a candidate for sainthood under
center is certainly a big deal, but there
is a lot more to this team than the coach
and the quarterback.

How will the new-look O-line per
form? Can the defense match its
breakout 2010 campaign despite losing
five starters? Will anyone step up at

Owusu be the Chris Owusu of 2009
(one of the most explosive players in
the country) or the Chris Owusu of
2010 (hurt too much of the year to
make a significant impact)?
These questions will go a long way
toward determining if 2011 will look
like 2010 or 2009. One of the most im
portant factors in Stanford's success,
though, is something that cannot make
a play or run a practice. I'm talking, of
course, about the schedule. You can
talk personnel all you want, but the fact
is that you're more likely to have suc
cess against Directional State than
against a BCS contender. Just ask Ken
tucky.

So, without further ado, here's a
look at what the 2011 season has in
store for Stanford football, along with
my level of worry for each game (and
don't worry, I'm not nearly powerful
