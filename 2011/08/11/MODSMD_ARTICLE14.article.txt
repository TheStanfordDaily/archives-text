# FOOTBALL MATCHUPS
## 
### Jacob Jaffe 
We're almost halfway
through August, so
there's no denying it
any longer it's
college football sea
son. True, 23 days remain until Stan
ford football kicks off its Andrew Luck
Farewell Tour, but that just means we
all have a bit over three weeks left to
analyze the heck out of the Cardinal's
chances.

Roughly 99.999 percent of the off
season news surrounding Stanford
football has been concentrated on
Luck staying for one more season
(sorry, Class of 2013, it's just one more)
and David Shaw replacing Jim Har
baugh. Yes, coaching changes in col
lege football really do matter, and hav
ing the preseason Heisman favorite
and a candidate for sainthood under
center is certainly a big deal, but there
is a lot more to this team than the coach
and the quarterback.

How will the new-look O-line per
form? Can the defense match its
breakout 2010 campaign despite losing
five starters? Will anyone step up at
wide receiver? Can Jordan Williamson
or Eric Whitaker match Nate Whitak
er's output at kicker? Will Chris
Owusu be the Chris Owusu of 2009
(one of the most explosive players in
the country) or the Chris Owusu of
2010 (hurt too much of the year to
make a significant impact)?
These questions will go a long way
toward determining if 2011 will look
like 2010 or 2009. One of the most im
portant factors in Stanford's success,
though, is something that cannot make
a play or run a practice. I'm talking, of
course, about the schedule. You can
talk personnel all you want, but the fact
is that you're more likely to have suc
cess against Directional State than
against a BCS contender. Just ask Ken
tucky.

So, without further ado, here's a
look at what the 2011 season has in
store for Stanford football, along with
my level of worry for each game (and
don't worry, I'm not nearly powerful
enough to jinx anything):
Week 1 opponent: San Jose State
(home). 2010 record: 1-12. Outlook: If
the Cardinal can't beat the lowly Spar
tans at home, Stanford might very well
be on the other side of the new Biggest.
Upset. Ever. SJSU fans, don't hold
your breath. Worry factor: subzero.
Week 2 opponent: Duke (road). 2010
record: 3-9. Outlook: Two of the best
academic institutions in the FBS face
off on a football field. Unless the folks
at Durham find away to move the
game to Cameron Indoor or they draw
a whole lot of phantom clipping calls,
Stanford shouldn't have any problems
in this trip to ACC territory. Worry
factor: barring a Jarrett Mann vs.
Austin Rivers showdown, zero.

Week 3 opponent: Arizona (road).
2010 record: 7-6 (4-5 Pac-10). Outlook:
The Wildcats ended 2010 in the worst
possible fashion, losing five in a row
after a hot start. Tucson is not an easy
place to win, and Arizona returns the
best QB-WR combo in the conference
in Nick Foles and Juron Criner, but the
O-line is entirely new and the defense
has questions. It still should be the
toughest test of the first half of the sea
son. Worry factor: moderate.

Week 4: Bye.

Week 5 opponent: UCLA (home).
2010 record: 4-8 (2-7 Pac-10). Outlook:
Kevin Prince's health has meant every
thing to the Bruins. Even a healthy
Prince doesn't figure to stand a chance
on the Farm. Worry factor: minimal.

Week 6 opponent: Colorado (home).
2010 record: 5-7. Outlook: The Buf
faloes escape the Big 12 only to play
their first Pac-12 road game against a

team that is superior in seemingly every
aspect of the game. Worry factor: low.

Week 7 opponent: Washington State
(road). 2010 record: 2-10 (1-8 Pac-10).
Outlook: This isn't your older sister's
Washington State. Yes, they're picked
to finish last in the Pac-12 North, but
Jeff Tuel and Co. could be in bowl con
tention in 2011. Worry factor: mild.

Week 8 opponent: Washington
(home). 2010 record: 7-6 (5-4 Pac-10).
Outlook: Chris Polk is back, Jake
Locker is not. This might mean some
thing more to the Cardinal if the
Huskies had gotten within 40 points of
Stanford in Seattle last year. Worry
factor: slight.

Week 9 opponent: USC (road). 2010
record: 8-5 (54 Pac-10). Outlook: Stan
ford has had success in its past two trips
to the Coliseum (24-23 and 55-21 will
live on in Farm lore for years to come),
but that still doesn't make playing in
L.A. easy for anyone. If the Trojans

found a pass defense over the summer,
this could be the first maj or challenge to
Stanford's title hopes. Worry factor: just
less than what it was with a minute left in
last year's game (before this happened).

Week 10 opponent: Oregon State
(road). 2010 record: 5-7 (4-5 Pac-10).
Outlook: The Beavers didn't put up
much of a fight in 2010, and now they
are missing the one player Stanford
couldn't contain: Jacquizz Rodgers.
Worry factor: small.

Week 11 opponent: Oregon (home).
2010 record: 12-1 (9-0 Pac-10). Out
look: If you have to ask, you haven't
been watching college football. This is
the game of the year for Stanford, for
the Pac-12 and possibly for the nation.
Worry factor: the only reason I'm not
shaking in my boots already is that I'm
not wearing boots.

Week 12 opponent: Cal (home). 2010
record: 5-7 (3-6 Pac-10). Outlook: No
rivalry game is a guarantee, there's no

debating that. But based on pure tal
ent, Stanford should run over the
Bears once more. Worry factor: mild, if
only because of a possible letdown
after Oregon.

Week 13 opponent: Notre Dame
(home). 2010 record: 8-5. Outlook: If it
was anyone else, all the preseason
hype would mean this is a team to be
truly scared of. But it's Notre Dame,
where hype is more ingrained in the
school than NBC and Touchdown
Jesus. Still, there's definitely talent and
a winning coach visiting from South
Bend. Worry factor: decent.

Dec. 2: Pac-12 Championship (home).
Jan. 9: BCS National Championship
Game (New Orleans).

Hmm, now why did I include those last
two dates?
