# TENNIS GRUNTS HERE TO STAY

### Angel Wang 
There are certain charac
teristics that separate
tennis from any other
sport. The flashy outfits.

The intense mental re
quirements and strategic execution.
The respectful viewing etiquette.
The distinctive grunts.
Ahh yes, the grunts. Although os
tensibly a minor detail in the scope of
professional tennis, this topic has
been the cause of heated debate for a
long time. In fact, some tournaments
have prevented specific athletes from
participating due to their grunting
habits, while others are considering
an official ban for all tennis players.
Albeit extreme, these cases never
theless illustrate the legitimacy and
magnitude of the issue.
Players have long attested to the
benefits of grunting. They assert that
pushing air from their lungs allows
them to exert more power in their
shots and to focus on the timing of

their strokes. In the past, this conjec
ture was the only available form of
persuasion. Today, the debate has
changed. Science has now entered
the game. Interestingly, a recent
study of U.S. college players found
that athletes who didn't normally
grunt increased the speed of their
forehands and serves when they did
grunt.

Complaints against grunting also
have some scientific basis. In 2005,
one of Maria Sharapova's grunts reg
istered above 100 decibels, roughly
the sound of a chainsaw or jackham
mer. Some of the more radical
protests against tennis go as far as to
say that grunting has disgraced the
prestigious reputation of the sport
and has forever polluted the quality
of tennis. Yet not all protests are this
fanatical. Generally, most people
complain that grunting is annoying
