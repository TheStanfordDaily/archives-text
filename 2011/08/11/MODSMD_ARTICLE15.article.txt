# TENNIS GRUNTS HERE TO STAY
## 
### Angel Wang 
There are certain charac
teristics that separate
tennis from any other
sport. The flashy outfits.

The intense mental re
quirements and strategic execution.
The respectful viewing etiquette.
The distinctive grunts.
Ahh yes, the grunts. Although os
tensibly a minor detail in the scope of
professional tennis, this topic has
been the cause of heated debate for a
long time. In fact, some tournaments
have prevented specific athletes from
participating due to their grunting
habits, while others are considering
an official ban for all tennis players.
Albeit extreme, these cases never
theless illustrate the legitimacy and
magnitude of the issue.
Players have long attested to the
benefits of grunting. They assert that
pushing air from their lungs allows
them to exert more power in their
shots and to focus on the timing of

their strokes. In the past, this conjec
ture was the only available form of
persuasion. Today, the debate has
changed. Science has now entered
the game. Interestingly, a recent
study of U.S. college players found
that athletes who didn't normally
grunt increased the speed of their
forehands and serves when they did
grunt.

Complaints against grunting also
have some scientific basis. In 2005,
one of Maria Sharapova's grunts reg
istered above 100 decibels, roughly
the sound of a chainsaw or jackham
mer. Some of the more radical
protests against tennis go as far as to
say that grunting has disgraced the
prestigious reputation of the sport
and has forever polluted the quality
of tennis. Yet not all protests are this
fanatical. Generally, most people
complain that grunting is annoying
and distracting.
I know at one point in our lives, we
have all been in this group of com
plainers. We've all experienced that
moment. Whether it's watching the
pros on TV or the particularly intense
players in our local community,
we've all heard particularly charac
teristic grunts, and we've all in
evitably asked, "Was that really nec
essary?"

To me, the question isn't some
thing that a simple yes-or-no answer
can solve. It depends on the situation;
it depends on the grunt.
Yes, there are different types of
grunts. Although specific grunting
styles vary from athlete to athlete,
there are ultimately a few major cate
gories of tennis grunts. After years of
playing and watching tennis, I've
come to categorize and title them.
Yes, I'm a nerd. I know.
The Exclamation: As if startled,
the player releases a short yelp.
These yelps take the shapes of words
and are usually a variation of "Ooh!"
or "Oy!" The Serbian former world
number one Jelena Jankovic is the
typical example of this category.

The Seductive Moan: The name is
pretty self-explanatory.
The Stress Reliever: Like a heavy
sigh, this type of grunt is purely a re
lease of air. There are no accompa
nying musical qualities or sounds.
Usually, the grunts are relatively

short and brief.

The Charging Bull: More intense
than a grunt, this can be viewed more
as a scream or shriek. This is usually
used on an ace or winning shot, when
a player exerts a ton of force. Serena
Williams, anyone?
The Two-Parter: Prior to hitting
the ball, the player releases a low
"pre-grant" that precedes the real
thing. The ultimate result is a two
pronged monster grunt. Past players
include Monica Seles and Elena De
mentieva, while more recent exam
ples include Novak Djokovic.
After reviewing these forms of
grunting, the original question re
turns. Is grunting really necessary? I
say ... maybe. It is no doubt that
certain athletes and their certain

grunts are distracting. Victoria
Azarenka's grunt, reminiscent of a
tropical bird's mating call, would be
unbearable in an intense match. Yet
I also understand that with the over
whelming pressure that comes at the
professional level, grunting can be
the only form of relief and expres
sion. Therefore, if players must
grunt to execute their 100 mph
serve, then so be it. Quality tennis
cannot be comprised for quiet ten
nis. But for those who don't agree, I
would like to make a friendly sug
gestion: wear earplugs.
