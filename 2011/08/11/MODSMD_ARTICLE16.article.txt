# FANTASY NEEDS MORE SPORTS
## 
### Tom Taylor 
The thrill of fantasy sports
leagues has never really
captured my attention,
but this year, I grudgingly

caved in and signed my
self up first to a fantasy Formula 1
competition and now to a fantasy soc
cer league based on the English Pre
miership.
So far, the new experience hasn't
been much of a personal success. I used
to have a pretty exhaustive, perhaps
even obsessive, knowledge of F1 until
a few years ago, when I just got bored
of the whole circus. The sport was orig
inally about finding a fine balance be
tween technology and skill, but now it's
simply a case of who manages to best
interpret what the rules mean. The reg
ulations change by so much every sin
gle year that fans, teams and drivers
alike are left guessing at the beginning
of each new season about how the
sport is now supposed to work. The
football equivalent of such radical rule
changes would be discovering the NFL
had replaced the goal posts with a giant

hoop one year, then switched from
four downs to eight, then cut the field
length from 100 yards to 80, etc.
And adding to the general frustra
tion, I lie 48th out of 51st in this make
believe F1 league. Fantastic.
Only time will tell how bad I am at
predicting soccer results, but I fear for
the worst. Though I love soccer, I don't
pay that much attention to the Pre
mier League because the team I sup
port doesn't play in it. In the same way
that my fantasy F1 ambitions have
been hurt by a lack of knowledge, I
suspect my soccer experiment will suf
fer a similar fate.

But even if I did regularly pay at
tention to the top flight of English
soccer, I still suspect I wouldn't do
very well. Dry statistics don't really
excite me that much, but it's attention
to them that wins fantasy sports titles.
The raw, numerical analysis of sport
takes little notice of the human factor
and the background stories that add
emotional depth to a match. For me,
calling these statistical competitions
fantasy sports is a little misleading.
Fantasy refers to an extravagant and
unrestrained imagination. Real fan
tasy sports wouldn't be held back by
attention to real-world rules. I'm talk
ing full-contact golf, football on ice or
Usain Bolt racing a cheetah.

Ironically, while my fantasy F1
competition is restrained by the rules
of the real sport, the rulers of that sport
are actually living this dream. No regu
lation that may take their fancy, how
ever bizarre, is off limits.

Creating a fantasy sports league,
though, is not that simple. You just
can't change the rules because you're
not in the real world, and the only way
to determine whose team is better is by
turning to those cold, hard statistics.
But I don't give up that easily. Perhaps
instead of just allowing you to just as
semble a team of players from one sin
gle sport, a real fantasy league should
be blind to segregation. Why, for ex
ample, can't my team include a quar
terback, a pinch hitter, a shooting
guard, a striker and a wicketkeeper?
Why can't I have both men and
women on my team?
Ok, I can see the obvious points of
contention: what game they're sup
posed to be playing, how to rate them
against each other and the stark con
trasts in the cost of different personnel.
But if you look at most team sports,
winning obviously the most impor
tant thing â€”is achieved by having
both a good offense and defense, and
by working as a team. The most im
portant statistics are therefore those
that reward these capabilities, and re
duced to that level, it should be possi
ble to compare any player in any sport.
Even the hugely varying costs of play
ers in different sports can be leveled
out by considering their comparative
value instead of raw dollar amounts.
Teams in the NBA obviously pay
players far more than those in the
MLL (Major League Lacrosse), but
dividing by the total of all salaries paid
in each respective league would mean
players could be bought according to
their real sporting value.

By being open to any sport, fantasy
leagues would also be open to anyone
too. Lack of insight into baseball would
n't be a problem, since perhaps you'd
know more about rugby. And even
more so than normal fantasy leagues,
this system would reward a knowledge
of hidden gems, not just in smaller
teams but in smaller sports. The wider
your sporting interest, the better.
But perhaps I'm indulging in a little
too much fantasy now. Having signed
myself up to two leagues already, I
should be paying a bit more attention
to the real world.

columnists to his fantasy team when his
proposals are adopted. Explain why he
