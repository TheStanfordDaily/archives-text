From the silly to the soulful, a cappella groups are a vital
and visible part of life at Stanford from one's first days on
the Farm surely, most students can recall hiking over to
Frost Amphitheater with their new Pro Fro friends, taking
in the diverse musical talents of the various troupes at the
annual a capella show during Admit Weekend. While a cappella is
far from unique to Stanford, the array of musical styles explored by
the groups on campus is varied, including classic rock 'n' roll, Bol
lywood and jazz, to name a few.
Stanford currently boasts nine a capella groups. Founded in
1963, the Stanford Mendicants is the oldest group on campus, an
all-male crew known for its red sport coats, khakis and swoon-wor
thy hits like "Brown Eyed Girl" and "Pretty Woman." Mixed
Company and Counterpoint are the oldest coed and all-female
groups, respectively, and both sing contemporary radio tunes.
Then there are the thematic troupes: Everyday People explores
R&B and hip-hop, and Talisman sings African and African Amer
ican folk songs and spirituals. Testimony performs Christian music,
and the Flarmonics is a coed rock ensemble. Fleet Street's tunes
like "Everyone Pees in the Shower" speak for the all-male group's
goofy personality. And founded in 2002, Raagapella is the newest

member of the bunch, featuring Southeast Asian sounds.
This mixed nature of the groups appeals to the similarly diverse
Stanford community.
"I think [the a capella groups] are a great asset to our college
community, because they represent the Stanford community as a
whole," said Rebecca Amato T4. "There is such a diversity of
groups that students can relate to. The combination of groups
makes for a good concert because the different songs and styles all
mix well together."
For the singers, a capella is a serious extracurricular undertak
ing, entailing a try out in the fall followed by a year of hard work and
dedication.

Talisman, a group that has traveled across the globe to perform,
has regular practices that can add up to 10 hours per week. This
does not include the occasional gig and extra sectionals. However,
its toil does not go unnoticed Talisman receives far more stu
dents auditioning each fall than spots available, and the group en
joys great popularity among the Stanford community.
"We sing music that tells stories of people with real experiences
of struggle and oppression," said Sterling Camden 'O6, the 2010-11
manager of Talisman. "We try to portray it as accurately as we can
and to tell where it came from and show how the individuals felt."

"Many of the songs originated in South Africa, which we've vis
ited five times, and the story travels through the music," he added.
"We never want to just sing the songs we want the audience to
engage and to talk about the song."
While trying to engage the audience and reach out to them
through music is important, perhaps the most appealing aspect of a
cappella groups to their members is the sheer joy that comes as a
result of making music.
