## Beyond the barbershop Stanford's a capella scene strays from the traditional 
### ISSRA OMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From the silly to the soulful, a cappella groups are a vital
and visible part of life at Stanford from one's first days on
the Farm surely, most students can recall hiking over to
Frost Amphitheater with their new Pro Fro friends, taking
in the diverse musical talents of the various troupes at the
annual a capella show during Admit Weekend. While a cappella is
far from unique to Stanford, the array of musical styles explored by
the groups on campus is varied, including classic rock 'n' roll, Bol
lywood and jazz, to name a few.
Stanford currently boasts nine a capella groups. Founded in
1963, the Stanford Mendicants is the oldest group on campus, an
all-male crew known for its red sport coats, khakis and swoon-wor
thy hits like "Brown Eyed Girl" and "Pretty Woman." Mixed
Company and Counterpoint are the oldest coed and all-female
groups, respectively, and both sing contemporary radio tunes.
Then there are the thematic troupes: Everyday People explores
R&B and hip-hop, and Talisman sings African and African Amer
ican folk songs and spirituals. Testimony performs Christian music,
and the Flarmonics is a coed rock ensemble. Fleet Street's tunes
like "Everyone Pees in the Shower" speak for the all-male group's
goofy personality. And founded in 2002, Raagapella is the newest

member of the bunch, featuring Southeast Asian sounds.
This mixed nature of the groups appeals to the similarly diverse
Stanford community.
"I think [the a capella groups] are a great asset to our college
community, because they represent the Stanford community as a
whole," said Rebecca Amato T4. "There is such a diversity of
groups that students can relate to. The combination of groups
makes for a good concert because the different songs and styles all
mix well together."
For the singers, a capella is a serious extracurricular undertak
ing, entailing a try out in the fall followed by a year of hard work and
dedication.

Talisman, a group that has traveled across the globe to perform,
has regular practices that can add up to 10 hours per week. This
does not include the occasional gig and extra sectionals. However,
its toil does not go unnoticed Talisman receives far more stu
dents auditioning each fall than spots available, and the group en
joys great popularity among the Stanford community.
"We sing music that tells stories of people with real experiences
of struggle and oppression," said Sterling Camden 'O6, the 2010-11
manager of Talisman. "We try to portray it as accurately as we can
and to tell where it came from and show how the individuals felt."

"Many of the songs originated in South Africa, which we've vis
ited five times, and the story travels through the music," he added.
"We never want to just sing the songs we want the audience to
engage and to talk about the song."
While trying to engage the audience and reach out to them
through music is important, perhaps the most appealing aspect of a
cappella groups to their members is the sheer joy that comes as a
result of making music.

Founded in 2002, Raagapella is the newest of Stanford's nine a
capella groups. The all-male troupe performs South Asian music.
Natalie Cheng 'l4, a member of
Counterpoint, the second oldest and
only all-female a cappella group on
campus, says that the group chooses
to sing songs that they simply love to
listen to and sing along with.
Cheng knew before coming to
campus that she wanted to join an a
cappella group due to her "love for
music and singing."
"I remember seeing a visiting a
cappella group come to my high
school," she said. "It was just really
inspiring to see how much fun they
were having and how much fun it
was to watch."

"A cappella is a community
where you get to do what you love,"
Cheng added. "It is a fun activity
rather than just another commit
ment. There is such a sense of enjoy
ment from singing, which I think re
ally adds color to the University."
Though Cheng knew that she
hoped to pursue a capella in college,
this is not the case for all eventual
singers, many of whom never sang
formally before coming to Stanford.
Luke Knepper 'l4, a member of
the rock-focused Harmonics, is one
such student. With no prior experi
ence in the world of a capella, he was
inspired to join after seeing the
group's energetic performance dur

ing his Admit Weekend visit and has
not regretted the decision.
"I am so glad I joined Harmon
ics," Knepper said. "It's great to be
in a group of people and just make
music. We've also had such cool op
portunities, such as being able to
perform at four different UC cam
puses and for the mayor of San Fran
cisco."

Knepper also appreciates the op
portunity to perform for his peers,
the same types of performances that
originally attracted him to the craft.
"The performances for people
during [New Student Orientation]
or Admit Weekend are some of my
favorites," he said. "It's so fun and
exciting to welcome them to cam
pus."

But in addition to providing a
venue for fellow students to enjoy
live, raw musical performances put
on by their friends and classmates, a
cappella is quintessentially Stanford
visibly passionate students col
laborating in a creative atmosphere,
producing an original end product
that the entire community can bene
fit from.
"A lot of the ideas behind our
songs come from the interactions
between the group," said Andrew
Forsyth 'l4, a member of Fleet
Street. "It's a group of friends that
gets together to sing. We joke
around, we sing and we have fun."

Founded in 2002, Raagapella is the newest of Stanford's nine a
capella groups. The all-male troupe performs South Asian music.
Natalie Cheng 'l4, a member of
Counterpoint, the second oldest and
only all-female a cappella group on
campus, says that the group chooses
to sing songs that they simply love to
listen to and sing along with.
Cheng knew before coming to
campus that she wanted to join an a
cappella group due to her "love for
music and singing."
"I remember seeing a visiting a
cappella group come to my high
school," she said. "It was just really
inspiring to see how much fun they
were having and how much fun it
was to watch."

"A cappella is a community
where you get to do what you love,"
Cheng added. "It is a fun activity
rather than just another commit
ment. There is such a sense of enjoy
ment from singing, which I think re
ally adds color to the University."
Though Cheng knew that she
hoped to pursue a capella in college,
this is not the case for all eventual
singers, many of whom never sang
formally before coming to Stanford.
Luke Knepper 'l4, a member of
the rock-focused Harmonics, is one
such student. With no prior experi
ence in the world of a capella, he was
inspired to join after seeing the
group's energetic performance dur

ing his Admit Weekend visit and has
not regretted the decision.
"I am so glad I joined Harmon
ics," Knepper said. "It's great to be
in a group of people and just make
music. We've also had such cool op
portunities, such as being able to
perform at four different UC cam
puses and for the mayor of San Fran
cisco."

Knepper also appreciates the op
portunity to perform for his peers,
the same types of performances that
originally attracted him to the craft.
"The performances for people
during [New Student Orientation]
or Admit Weekend are some of my
favorites," he said. "It's so fun and
exciting to welcome them to cam
pus."

But in addition to providing a
venue for fellow students to enjoy
live, raw musical performances put
on by their friends and classmates, a
cappella is quintessentially Stanford
visibly passionate students col
laborating in a creative atmosphere,
producing an original end product
that the entire community can bene
fit from.
"A lot of the ideas behind our
songs come from the interactions
between the group," said Andrew
Forsyth 'l4, a member of Fleet
Street. "It's a group of friends that
gets together to sing. We joke
around, we sing and we have fun."

From the silly to the soulful, a cappella groups are a vital
and visible part of life at Stanford from one's first days on
the Farm surely, most students can recall hiking over to
Frost Amphitheater with their new Pro Fro friends, taking
in the diverse musical talents of the various troupes at the
annual a capella show during Admit Weekend. While a cappella is
far from unique to Stanford, the array of musical styles explored by
the groups on campus is varied, including classic rock 'n' roll, Bol
lywood and jazz, to name a few.
Stanford currently boasts nine a capella groups. Founded in
1963, the Stanford Mendicants is the oldest group on campus, an
all-male crew known for its red sport coats, khakis and swoon-wor
thy hits like "Brown Eyed Girl" and "Pretty Woman." Mixed
Company and Counterpoint are the oldest coed and all-female
groups, respectively, and both sing contemporary radio tunes.
Then there are the thematic troupes: Everyday People explores
R&B and hip-hop, and Talisman sings African and African Amer
ican folk songs and spirituals. Testimony performs Christian music,
and the Flarmonics is a coed rock ensemble. Fleet Street's tunes
like "Everyone Pees in the Shower" speak for the all-male group's
goofy personality. And founded in 2002, Raagapella is the newest

member of the bunch, featuring Southeast Asian sounds.
This mixed nature of the groups appeals to the similarly diverse
Stanford community.
"I think [the a capella groups] are a great asset to our college
community, because they represent the Stanford community as a
whole," said Rebecca Amato T4. "There is such a diversity of
groups that students can relate to. The combination of groups
makes for a good concert because the different songs and styles all
mix well together."
For the singers, a capella is a serious extracurricular undertak
ing, entailing a try out in the fall followed by a year of hard work and
dedication.

Talisman, a group that has traveled across the globe to perform,
has regular practices that can add up to 10 hours per week. This
does not include the occasional gig and extra sectionals. However,
its toil does not go unnoticed Talisman receives far more stu
dents auditioning each fall than spots available, and the group en
joys great popularity among the Stanford community.
"We sing music that tells stories of people with real experiences
of struggle and oppression," said Sterling Camden 'O6, the 2010-11
manager of Talisman. "We try to portray it as accurately as we can
and to tell where it came from and show how the individuals felt."

"Many of the songs originated in South Africa, which we've vis
ited five times, and the story travels through the music," he added.
"We never want to just sing the songs we want the audience to
engage and to talk about the song."
While trying to engage the audience and reach out to them
through music is important, perhaps the most appealing aspect of a
cappella groups to their members is the sheer joy that comes as a
result of making music.
