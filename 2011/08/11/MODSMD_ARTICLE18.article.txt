# School's out for summer
## Readjusting to life back at home 
### TORI LEWIS 
The green numbers of my alarm clock
read 7:00 a.m. Despite having been
home for a couple of months, I still
took several seconds to comprehend
that the clock was telling the truth.
What happened to rolling out of bed just in time
for 11:00 classes?

After spending a year within the Stanford bub
ble, I decided to come back to my hometown for
the summer. A paid internship and free housing
at my parents' house was something that a broke
college student like me couldn't exactly afford to
turn down. But as I looked out my window and
saw only the tiniest bit of sunlight, I began to re
gret the decision. At Stanford, I was only up at this
ungodly hour at the conclusion of an all-nighter.
I finally got out of bed, and after jumping in the
shower, I begrudgingly began to get dressed for
the office. I opened my closet to my "business ca
sual" pencil skirts, blouses, sweaters and slacks,
though I wondered if the corporate world has
ever looked up "casual" in the dictionary. My col
lege wardrobe, a uniform of t-shirts, sweatpants
and hoodies, still sits in my suitcases, untouched
and wrinkled.
I sat in rush hour traffic for what feels like
hours. I missed the sunny spring days, zooming
around campus on Paris what I named my lit
tle white bike with her bell that is significantly
less obnoxious than a car horn. Trying to avoid
giving in to road rage, I fiddled with the radio. I
heard a traffic report informing me of the traffic
that I was sitting in, followed by commercials for
products I have no intention of buying. This does
not help my morning mood.
When I finally got to work, I settled in at my
desk and started my computer. The ancient PC
takes several minutes to boot up, and I wonder
how I ever lived without my Macßook Pro. I
started on my list of tasks for the day, pondering
the single most important thing that I've learned
at my internship this summer: the work world has
little to do with what you learn in college. While
I'm sure that this isn't true for every career path,
it is definitely true for my developing academic in
terests in feminist studies and English. I miss my
Stanford classes where everything we learn is not
about the bottom line.

After a semi-productive morning, I headed off
to lunch. I finally felt at home again as I waited in
the ridiculously long line at Subway. If I squinted
my eyes really hard, I almost thought I was in
Tresidder, trying to grab a bite to eat
between classes. That is, until I got
to the register.
"Wait, you don't take Cardinal
Dollars?" I want to ask, as I handed
over my credit card.
My afternoon felt eerily similar
to my morning, and at 5:00 p.m., I
got on the elevator and headed
back to the car, violating at least 15
rules of corporate etiquette on the
way. Why does no one ever teach
you what you really need to know,
like how to make small talk on an
awkward elevator ride with that
guy from the cubicle next to yours,
or why revolving doors are way
harder to push than normal doors?
When I got home, I immediately
changed into workout clothes,
though I had no intention of going
running. Despite sitting at a desk all
day, all I wanted to do was curl up on
the couch and relax. Who knew that
a full-time job was so exhausting?
I spent my early evening loung
ing around the house, enjoying free
snacks from my parents' kitchen
and a real television. I had com
pletely forgotten that when you
watch shows live on TV, they have
commercials. I even missed the ob
noxious buffering of online video
streaming as a chipper McDonald's
ad tries to convince me that it is a
healthy dining establishment now. I
texted my friends from high school,

all of whom have moved, taken in
ternships in significantly cooler
cities or are on vacation. Hello,
Thursday night a far cry from
"Thirsty Thursdays" at Sigma Chi's
penthouse.

I was about to head to bed at the
embarrassingly early time of 9:00
p.m. when my dad suggested that
we go see a movie together. Won
dering whether my life had become
so pathetic that my father was my
sole social companion, I considered
telling him "no," but he suggested
"The Rise of the Planet of the
Apes," and I had never been one to
turn down James Franco. So off we
headed to the local movie theater,
and I tried not to miss the Century
Redwood City Theater too much.
There wasn't a Chipotle close
enough to sneak in a burrito, and
the stale, over-buttered movie pop
corn left something to be desired.
But then the movie started. My
dad and I sat and laughed and cried
(okay, maybe that was just me)
while Franco won our hearts for the
millionth time, on this occasion
alongside an ape named "Caesar."
As I rode home with my dad and
we discussed everything from the
ethics of animal testing to Draco
Malfoy's American accent, I real
ized that even though I desperately
miss the Farm and cannot wait for
fall quarter, I came home for a rea
son. Because as wonderful as Stan
ford is, it's missing one essential part
of my life: my family.

The green numbers of my alarm clock
read 7:00 a.m. Despite having been
home for a couple of months, I still
took several seconds to comprehend
that the clock was telling the truth.
What happened to rolling out of bed just in time
for 11:00 classes?

After spending a year within the Stanford bub
ble, I decided to come back to my hometown for
the summer. A paid internship and free housing
at my parents' house was something that a broke
college student like me couldn't exactly afford to
turn down. But as I looked out my window and
saw only the tiniest bit of sunlight, I began to re
gret the decision. At Stanford, I was only up at this
ungodly hour at the conclusion of an all-nighter.
I finally got out of bed, and after jumping in the
shower, I begrudgingly began to get dressed for
the office. I opened my closet to my "business ca
sual" pencil skirts, blouses, sweaters and slacks,
though I wondered if the corporate world has
ever looked up "casual" in the dictionary. My col
lege wardrobe, a uniform of t-shirts, sweatpants
and hoodies, still sits in my suitcases, untouched
and wrinkled.
I sat in rush hour traffic for what feels like
hours. I missed the sunny spring days, zooming
around campus on Paris what I named my lit
tle white bike with her bell that is significantly
less obnoxious than a car horn. Trying to avoid
giving in to road rage, I fiddled with the radio. I
heard a traffic report informing me of the traffic
that I was sitting in, followed by commercials for
products I have no intention of buying. This does
not help my morning mood.
When I finally got to work, I settled in at my
desk and started my computer. The ancient PC
takes several minutes to boot up, and I wonder
how I ever lived without my Macßook Pro. I
started on my list of tasks for the day, pondering
the single most important thing that I've learned
at my internship this summer: the work world has
little to do with what you learn in college. While
I'm sure that this isn't true for every career path,
it is definitely true for my developing academic in
terests in feminist studies and English. I miss my
Stanford classes where everything we learn is not
about the bottom line.

After a semi-productive morning, I headed off
to lunch. I finally felt at home again as I waited in
the ridiculously long line at Subway. If I squinted
my eyes really hard, I almost thought I was in
Tresidder, trying to grab a bite to eat
between classes. That is, until I got
to the register.
"Wait, you don't take Cardinal
Dollars?" I want to ask, as I handed
over my credit card.
My afternoon felt eerily similar
to my morning, and at 5:00 p.m., I
got on the elevator and headed
back to the car, violating at least 15
rules of corporate etiquette on the
way. Why does no one ever teach
you what you really need to know,
like how to make small talk on an
awkward elevator ride with that
guy from the cubicle next to yours,
or why revolving doors are way
harder to push than normal doors?
When I got home, I immediately
changed into workout clothes,
though I had no intention of going
running. Despite sitting at a desk all
day, all I wanted to do was curl up on
the couch and relax. Who knew that
a full-time job was so exhausting?
I spent my early evening loung
ing around the house, enjoying free
snacks from my parents' kitchen
and a real television. I had com
pletely forgotten that when you
watch shows live on TV, they have
commercials. I even missed the ob
noxious buffering of online video
streaming as a chipper McDonald's
ad tries to convince me that it is a
healthy dining establishment now. I
texted my friends from high school,

all of whom have moved, taken in
ternships in significantly cooler
cities or are on vacation. Hello,
Thursday night a far cry from
"Thirsty Thursdays" at Sigma Chi's
penthouse.

I was about to head to bed at the
embarrassingly early time of 9:00
p.m. when my dad suggested that
we go see a movie together. Won
dering whether my life had become
so pathetic that my father was my
sole social companion, I considered
telling him "no," but he suggested
"The Rise of the Planet of the
Apes," and I had never been one to
turn down James Franco. So off we
headed to the local movie theater,
and I tried not to miss the Century
Redwood City Theater too much.
There wasn't a Chipotle close
enough to sneak in a burrito, and
the stale, over-buttered movie pop
corn left something to be desired.
But then the movie started. My
dad and I sat and laughed and cried
(okay, maybe that was just me)
while Franco won our hearts for the
millionth time, on this occasion
alongside an ape named "Caesar."
As I rode home with my dad and
we discussed everything from the
