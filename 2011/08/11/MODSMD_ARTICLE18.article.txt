# School's out for summer
## Readjusting to life back at home 
### TORI LEWIS 
The green numbers of my alarm clock
read 7:00 a.m. Despite having been
home for a couple of months, I still
took several seconds to comprehend
that the clock was telling the truth.
What happened to rolling out of bed just in time
for 11:00 classes?

After spending a year within the Stanford bub
ble, I decided to come back to my hometown for
the summer. A paid internship and free housing
at my parents' house was something that a broke
college student like me couldn't exactly afford to
turn down. But as I looked out my window and
saw only the tiniest bit of sunlight, I began to re
gret the decision. At Stanford, I was only up at this
ungodly hour at the conclusion of an all-nighter.
I finally got out of bed, and after jumping in the
shower, I begrudgingly began to get dressed for
the office. I opened my closet to my "business ca

though I wondered if the corporate world has

products I have no intention of buying. This does
not help my morning mood.
When I finally got to work, I settled in at my
desk and started my computer. The ancient PC
takes several minutes to boot up, and I wonder
how I ever lived without my Mac√üook Pro. I
started on my list of tasks for the day, pondering
the single most important thing that I've learned
at my internship this summer: the work world has
little to do with what you learn in college. While
I'm sure that this isn't true for every career path,
it is definitely true for my developing academic in
terests in feminist studies and English. I miss my
Stanford classes where everything we learn is not
about the bottom line.

After a semi-productive morning, I headed off
to lunch. I finally felt at home again as I waited in
the ridiculously long line at Subway. If I squinted
my eyes really hard, I almost thought I was in
