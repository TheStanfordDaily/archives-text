## MOVIE REVIEW '3O MINUTES' FORGETTABLE 
### – eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
CC/V Minutes or Less" has a lot going for
lt has the same director as
w/ "Zombieland" and features some

truly stellar actors. The premise seems promis
ing: high-strung pizza-boy Nick ()esse Eisenberg)
is living the loser life with his best friend Chet
(Aziz Ansari) until a couple of redneck crimi
nals-in-the-making strap a bomb to his chest
and force him to rob a bank for them.
Unfortunately, the film falls slightly short of
expectations.

The movie did succeed at the casting of its
two main men, because Jesse Eisenberg and Aziz
Ansari are a couple of winners. Ansari can draw
laughs before he even opens his mouth. There's
just something about his face his goofy, phe
nomenally expressive face that is literally
never not funny. The guy's a pro. And Jesse does
neurotic and freaking-the-heck-out better than
anyone else in the business; he stammers more
charmingly than Michael Cera, and he hasn't
gotten old yet. The two had decent chemistry: I
believed their bromance, but only just.
The strongest aspect of the movie was its

willingness to mix genuinely heart-pounding
action with humor. The bank robbery scene, for
instance, had Nick and Chet (hiding under ski
masks and under the guise of a couple of
Mexican escaped convicts) bust into their small
town's bank and lay waste to the place. Of
course, the two aren't exactly Bonnie and Clyde,
so hilarity ensues, but even as the pair banters
with one another and with their victims, the
adrenaline levels continue to shoot up.
Incidentally, it turns out almost the entire scene
was improvised, which leads me to conclude that
this movie could have been a lot better if it had
more frequently stepped back and let the good
actors to do what they did best.
Despite all this, the movie had a lot of
mediocre elements. Sure, there were a few
moments of cleverness at one point, for
instance, the script alluded to fesse's role in a
"The Social Network" by having him scathingly
dismiss Facebook—but for the most part, the
movie went for the easy laughs. The pair of wit
less villains, Dwayne and Travis, demonstrates the
worst of this: all of their jokes consist of Dwayne

saying something ignorant or crude and Travis
misinterpreting naively. It's not that I felt it wasn't
high-brow enough; I love crudity, and in all hon
esty, I snickered at most of the jokes. It was just
that the film leaned on this sort of thing as the
foundation of its humor, and it got to be too
much. Additionally, in spite of all the strong act
ing talent, the characters themselves were fairly
forgettable. Nick's given a two-dimensional love
interest, but their relationship was not really

fleshed out in her five or 10 minutes of screen
time. While the situations that Nick and Chet

were placed in were humorous ones, nobody
delivered a single memorable one-liner.
At the end of the day, "30 Minutes or Less"

didn't have anything particularly memorable or
particularly quotable. It wasn't heartwarming or
humorous enough to be a "Zombieland" nor
was it funny or outrageous enough to be a
"Superbad." It just... was. Don't get me wrong,
the film was certainly entertaining; I imagine that
for those who see it, the movie will be frequently
hilarious and enjoyable but will be promptly for
gotten the next morning. "30 Minutes or Less"
was funny, but I imagine that its effect on its
viewers will probably last around 30 minutes, if
not less.
