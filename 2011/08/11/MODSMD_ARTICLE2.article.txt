## UNIVERSITY University projects $57M in undergrad fee revenue 
### ELLORA ISRANI NEWS EDITOR 
The University projects it will collect
$296.5 million in undergraduate student fees
for the 2011-12 academic year, reflecting a 3.8
percent increase over last year, and will award
$148.9 million in undergraduate financial aid,
a 1.5 percent increase over 2010-11.
The numbers project $57 million in rev
enue from undergraduate fees which in
clude tuition, room, board and miscellaneous
fees for 2011-12, as well as a 5.9 percent rev
enue increase over last year's $53.8 million.
For 2011-12, income from student tuition and
fees will represent 17.4 of the University's con
solidated budget revenue, while undergradu
ate financial aid will comprise six percent of
expenses.

Finance Cheat Sheet
According to University Vice President for
Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer
Randy Livingston, the average undergraduate
during 2010-11 received $19,000 in financial
aid, or approximately half of Stanford's tu
ition.

Financial aid draws on four primary
sources: department funds and expendable
gifts; endowment income, which provides the
bulk of support in the $70.5 million projected
for 2011-12 aid; President's Funds, including
alumni support from The Stanford Fund; and
general funds, drawn from the $1.04 billion set
aside for general University expenses.
The Provost's report to the Faculty Senate
provided a clear breakdown of where under
graduate tuition fees come from, the largest
two contributors being 58 percent from fami

lies themselves and 18 percent from endow
ments, gifts and other sources.
However, according to Livingston, these
numbers are much less clear-cut than they ap
pear. The total cost of educating a student for
2010-11 was $53,300, not including room and
board; tuition, however, was $38,688, meaning
students who paid full tuition received a
$14,600 subsidy 27 percent of the cost of
their education.

With the addition of financial aid, this
brought the average student subsidy to
$33,600 63 percent of the full cost of an un
dergraduate education.
"Figuring out exactly what we spend on ed
ucating students is challenging, as faculty
spend time teaching, advising and mentoring
students; undertaking research and serving in

leadership roles for the University," Liv
ingston wrote in an email to The Daily. "Peri
odically, we've undertaken studies to estimate
the cost of educating an undergraduate stu
dent, based on estimating the allocation of
time among faculty and other staff devoted to
this mission."

He said that the funds to make up this
$14,600 difference come "largely from Uni
versity endowments," including professor
ships for faculty and funds allotted to specific
programs such as Bing Overseas Studies.

Provost's Perspective
Provost John Etchemendy provided a sim
ilar calculation to demonstrate the Universi
ty's spending on its students.
"Several years ago, an outside group did a
study on the full cost of the undergraduate
education delivered at various colleges and
universities," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "This involved carefully figuring out
how much the university spends on under
graduate classes, programs, etc., and ex
cludes what is spent for graduate education,
research and other activities. This was then
divided by the number of enrolled under
graduates, to get a per student number, and
this was compared to the full tuition charge."
The study showed that Stanford's full tu
ition covered 58 percent of the amount spent
on the University per student per annum.
"Flipping that around, it costs us 72 per
cent more to provide the education than is
covered by tuition, before financial aid,"
Etchemendy said. "In other words, even the
full-paying student is getting a substantial


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
subsidy implicit financial aid
from the University."
He also chose to separate tu
ition from room and board, as Res
idential Housing & Dining Enter
prises are auxiliaries to the Univer
sity that "in theory ... charge ex
actly what it costs them to provide
the student housing and meals."
"I say 'in theory' because there
are explicit and implicit subsidies,"
he explained. "We have put in cen
tral University funds (gifts, re
serves) to subsidize building some
of the dorms, which is an explicit
subsidy that reduces the room and
board charges to the students, and,
of course, there is no land cost for
any of the facilities, which provides
an implicit subsidy that reduces the
cost of housing to the students. But
by and large, students pay for what
they get."

Evaluating Stanford's Value
Etchemendy was unclear on how
exactly to define the financial bene
fit that is, the amount a student
receives in financial aid as well as via
participation in campus programs
ranging from research grants to
overseas studies to on-campus Vol
unteer Student Organizations
(VSOs) derived from a Stanford
education.
"Some students take more ad
vantage of the opportunities at
Stanford than others," Etchemendy
said. "They participate in more ac
tivities, more programs and so forth.
Conversely, other students partici
pate in less. Is it possible that the lat
ter students are getting less than
they are paying for, while the for
mer are getting much more?"
Fie used the analogy of an
amusement park's entrance fee to
explain the situation.
"Some people go on more rides
than others," he said. "Does this
mean they are getting more than
they paid for, while the others are
getting less? It's hard to say. I think
a lot of the people who go on fewer
rides would disagree (think, for ex
ample, of the person who hates
roller coasters but enjoys other as
pects of the experience)."
He also compared the expense of
running different rides to the ex
pense of providing various classes at
Stanford. While Introductory Semi
nars have a small size and employ
senior faculty, increasing cost, larg
er introductory classes such as Sleep
and Dreams or Introductory Eco

nomics are "comparatively cheaper
for the University on a per-student
basis."
"But there's a reason these class
es are popular and grow large: ask
anyone who's taken Econ 1 from a
great teacher like John Taylor," he
explained. "Do these students 're
ceive less' from these highly popular
classes? I don't think so."

The Student Perspective

Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, ASSU pres
ident and vice president respective
ly, provided a similar perspective on
the value of a Stanford education
and especially the role that financial
aid plays in determining that value.
"I think the most important thing
is for students not to have to worry
about their financial situation,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "The fi
nancial aid program will be success
ful if it allows students to not think
about money and just focus on ...
participation [in Stanford's ex
tracurricular opportunities], acade
mic success and enjoying Stanford."

Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper stated that the mission of
her office is just that: to remove fi
nancial aid from a student's decision
to attend Stanford.

"One of our goals in the financial
aid program is to take the financial
aspect out of that decision-making
process," she said. "I would much
rather see students choose an insti
tution based on their overall com
fort, their academic goals, etc., than
purely on a financial basis."
Cruz, however, used himself as
an exhibit of how financial aid can
define a student's Stanford experi
ence.

"Financial aid and on-campus
participation in clubs, tutoring and
other campus activities is very posi
tively correlated," he said. "I know
that if I wasn't [on financial aid] I
would have to get jobs that don't
necessarily interest me but pay
much better than the jobs that I
have had. I wouldn't be able to be
involved in any of the VSOs on cam
pus that have really helped make
my experience at Stanford."
Cooper provided a similar senti
ment.

"A large proportion of students
on financial aid are very grateful for
the assistance they're receiving and
realize they couldn't be here with
out it," she said. "Whether or not it
makes them more anxious to take
advantage of opportunities on cam
pus, I think that has much more to
do with the individual student's per
sonality.

"I can name off dozens of stu
dents with the same situation; just

read any TSF [The Stanford Fund]
letter, and you can see the positive
correlation between those two,"
Cruz said.

He also pointed to a potential
correlation between financial aid
and academic success.

"Everyone who comes to Stan
ford has an equal chance at academ
ic success, and I think that for a lot of
students, one of the big factors that
could hinder academic success is
worrying about financial aid, partic
ularly at institutions that don't offer
strong financial aid packages like
Stanford," he said. "Those two are
positively correlated that is,
when students have better financial
security, whether it's through their
parents, through financial aid,
through scholarships that they got, I
think it definitely helps their acade
mic success."

The Student Stand

Some students suggested that fi
nancial aid, as well as the ancillary
benefits and costs derived from it,
does not have a consequential im
pact on their enjoyment of Stanford.
One rising sophomore who re
ceives a $39,000 per annum scholar
ship differentiated between a stu
dent's ability and decision to partic
ipate. She asked to remain anony
mous to protect her personal finan
cial information.

"If you're in your dorm room all
day not doing anything, then I sup
pose the school's not spending on
you because you're not going out
there to take those opportunities,"
she said. "People might have differ
ent experiences, but I don't think
that's based on how much Stan
ford's spending, it's based on how
much you personally are spending."
One former varsity athlete who
is entering her junior year estimates
that only about 10 percent of varsi
ty athletes receive a full scholarship
at Stanford.

"[Financial aid affects] sense of
worth as an athlete and making tu
ition affordable, but the Stanford
campus and atmosphere have the
ability to win people over," she
said.

She justified some of the ancil
lary benefits that Stanford funds for
athletes as instrumental to academ
ic and athletic success; for example,
most non-athletic tutoring on cam
pus takes place at the same time as
practices. She did, however, note
that athletic involvement precludes
participation in some other Univer
sity-funded experiences such as
overseas study.
Another current varsity athlete
stated that she would have come to
Stanford "no matter what," but that
the athletic experience is "give and
take."

"It's really a draw," she said.
"For example, the job I'm working
this summer, I was first ... ex
posed to it from the athlete lun
cheon, but I actually couldn't at
tend all of the company's other
events on campus because they
were during practice."

She also noted that the influence
of financial aid varies depending on
the sport, as some such as football
have many scholarships while oth
ers such as men's rowing have "vir
tually none."

Both athletes asked to remain
anonymous, as their coaches had
asked them to refrain from speak
ing with the press.

Cruz summarized the Stanford
experience as a direct function of
the individual as opposed to any
outside factors.

"Students try and find what they
really want at Stanford," he said.
"For some students, that's getting
really involved in student organiza
tions and groups and activism and
on-campus tutoring and using the
gym, and for other people that's
getting involved in social life, in
hanging out with their friends a lot
and having friends in classes."
"One thing I can note is that in
exit surveys, the number of students
who say that the Stanford experi
ence was not worth the cost is van
ishingly small (I don't have it in
front of me, but it's on the order of
1 or 2 percent.)," Etchemendy said.
"If anything, the positive feelings
get stronger among alumni looking
back on the experience and assess
ing its value. So I have to believe
that very few people give (in the
sense of pay) more than they get (in
terms of the self-assessed value of
the experience) at Stanford."

they paid for, while the others are
getting less? It's hard to say. I think
a lot of the people who go on fewer
rides would disagree (think, for ex
ample, of the person who hates
roller coasters but enjoys other as
pects of the experience)."
He also compared the expense of
running different rides to the ex
pense of providing various classes at
Stanford. While Introductory Semi
nars have a small size and employ
senior faculty, increasing cost, larg
er introductory classes such as Sleep
and Dreams or Introductory Eco

nomics are "comparatively cheaper
for the University on a per-student
basis."
"But there's a reason these class
es are popular and grow large: ask
anyone who's taken Econ 1 from a
great teacher like John Taylor," he
explained. "Do these students 're
ceive less' from these highly popular
classes? I don't think so."

The Student Perspective

Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, ASSU pres
ident and vice president respective
ly, provided a similar perspective on
the value of a Stanford education
and especially the role that financial
aid plays in determining that value.
"I think the most important thing
is for students not to have to worry
about their financial situation,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "The fi
nancial aid program will be success
ful if it allows students to not think
about money and just focus on ...
participation [in Stanford's ex
tracurricular opportunities], acade
mic success and enjoying Stanford."

Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper stated that the mission of
her office is just that: to remove fi
nancial aid from a student's decision
to attend Stanford.

"One of our goals in the financial
aid program is to take the financial
aspect out of that decision-making
process," she said. "I would much
rather see students choose an insti
tution based on their overall com
fort, their academic goals, etc., than
purely on a financial basis."
Cruz, however, used himself as
an exhibit of how financial aid can
define a student's Stanford experi
ence.

"Financial aid and on-campus
participation in clubs, tutoring and
other campus activities is very posi
tively correlated," he said. "I know
that if I wasn't [on financial aid] I
would have to get jobs that don't
necessarily interest me but pay
much better than the jobs that I
have had. I wouldn't be able to be
involved in any of the VSOs on cam
pus that have really helped make
my experience at Stanford."
Cooper provided a similar senti
ment.

"A large proportion of students
on financial aid are very grateful for
the assistance they're receiving and
realize they couldn't be here with
out it," she said. "Whether or not it
makes them more anxious to take
advantage of opportunities on cam
pus, I think that has much more to
do with the individual student's per
sonality.

"I can name off dozens of stu
dents with the same situation; just

read any TSF [The Stanford Fund]
letter, and you can see the positive
correlation between those two,"
Cruz said.

He also pointed to a potential
correlation between financial aid
and academic success.

"Everyone who comes to Stan
ford has an equal chance at academ
ic success, and I think that for a lot of
students, one of the big factors that
could hinder academic success is
worrying about financial aid, partic
ularly at institutions that don't offer
strong financial aid packages like
Stanford," he said. "Those two are
positively correlated that is,
when students have better financial
security, whether it's through their
parents, through financial aid,
through scholarships that they got, I
think it definitely helps their acade
mic success."

The Student Stand

Some students suggested that fi
nancial aid, as well as the ancillary
benefits and costs derived from it,
does not have a consequential im
pact on their enjoyment of Stanford.
One rising sophomore who re
ceives a $39,000 per annum scholar
ship differentiated between a stu
dent's ability and decision to partic
ipate. She asked to remain anony
mous to protect her personal finan
cial information.

"If you're in your dorm room all
day not doing anything, then I sup
pose the school's not spending on
you because you're not going out
there to take those opportunities,"
she said. "People might have differ
ent experiences, but I don't think
that's based on how much Stan
ford's spending, it's based on how
much you personally are spending."
One former varsity athlete who
is entering her junior year estimates
that only about 10 percent of varsi
ty athletes receive a full scholarship
at Stanford.

"[Financial aid affects] sense of
worth as an athlete and making tu
ition affordable, but the Stanford
campus and atmosphere have the
ability to win people over," she
said.

She justified some of the ancil
lary benefits that Stanford funds for
athletes as instrumental to academ
ic and athletic success; for example,
most non-athletic tutoring on cam
pus takes place at the same time as
practices. She did, however, note
that athletic involvement precludes
participation in some other Univer
sity-funded experiences such as
overseas study.
Another current varsity athlete
stated that she would have come to
Stanford "no matter what," but that
the athletic experience is "give and
take."

"It's really a draw," she said.
"For example, the job I'm working
this summer, I was first ... ex
posed to it from the athlete lun
cheon, but I actually couldn't at
tend all of the company's other
events on campus because they
were during practice."

She also noted that the influence
of financial aid varies depending on
the sport, as some such as football
have many scholarships while oth
ers such as men's rowing have "vir
tually none."

Both athletes asked to remain
anonymous, as their coaches had
asked them to refrain from speak
ing with the press.

Cruz summarized the Stanford
experience as a direct function of
the individual as opposed to any
outside factors.

"Students try and find what they
really want at Stanford," he said.
"For some students, that's getting
really involved in student organiza
tions and groups and activism and
on-campus tutoring and using the
gym, and for other people that's
getting involved in social life, in
hanging out with their friends a lot
and having friends in classes."
"One thing I can note is that in
exit surveys, the number of students
who say that the Stanford experi
ence was not worth the cost is van
ishingly small (I don't have it in
front of me, but it's on the order of
1 or 2 percent.)," Etchemendy said.
"If anything, the positive feelings
get stronger among alumni looking
back on the experience and assess
ing its value. So I have to believe
that very few people give (in the
sense of pay) more than they get (in
terms of the self-assessed value of
the experience) at Stanford."

MACGREGOR-DENNIS 'l3
The University projects it will collect
$296.5 million in undergraduate student fees
for the 2011-12 academic year, reflecting a 3.8
percent increase over last year, and will award
$148.9 million in undergraduate financial aid,
a 1.5 percent increase over 2010-11.
The numbers project $57 million in rev
enue from undergraduate fees which in
clude tuition, room, board and miscellaneous
fees for 2011-12, as well as a 5.9 percent rev
enue increase over last year's $53.8 million.
For 2011-12, income from student tuition and
fees will represent 17.4 of the University's con
solidated budget revenue, while undergradu
ate financial aid will comprise six percent of
expenses.

Finance Cheat Sheet
According to University Vice President for
Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer
Randy Livingston, the average undergraduate
during 2010-11 received $19,000 in financial
aid, or approximately half of Stanford's tu
ition.

Financial aid draws on four primary
sources: department funds and expendable
gifts; endowment income, which provides the
bulk of support in the $70.5 million projected
for 2011-12 aid; President's Funds, including
alumni support from The Stanford Fund; and
general funds, drawn from the $1.04 billion set
aside for general University expenses.
The Provost's report to the Faculty Senate
provided a clear breakdown of where under
graduate tuition fees come from, the largest
two contributors being 58 percent from fami

lies themselves and 18 percent from endow
ments, gifts and other sources.
However, according to Livingston, these
numbers are much less clear-cut than they ap
pear. The total cost of educating a student for
2010-11 was $53,300, not including room and
board; tuition, however, was $38,688, meaning
students who paid full tuition received a
$14,600 subsidy 27 percent of the cost of
their education.

With the addition of financial aid, this
brought the average student subsidy to
$33,600 63 percent of the full cost of an un
dergraduate education.
"Figuring out exactly what we spend on ed
ucating students is challenging, as faculty
spend time teaching, advising and mentoring
students; undertaking research and serving in

leadership roles for the University," Liv
ingston wrote in an email to The Daily. "Peri
odically, we've undertaken studies to estimate
the cost of educating an undergraduate stu
dent, based on estimating the allocation of
time among faculty and other staff devoted to
this mission."

He said that the funds to make up this
$14,600 difference come "largely from Uni
versity endowments," including professor
ships for faculty and funds allotted to specific
programs such as Bing Overseas Studies.

Provost's Perspective
Provost John Etchemendy provided a sim
ilar calculation to demonstrate the Universi
ty's spending on its students.
"Several years ago, an outside group did a
study on the full cost of the undergraduate
education delivered at various colleges and
universities," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "This involved carefully figuring out
how much the university spends on under
graduate classes, programs, etc., and ex
cludes what is spent for graduate education,
research and other activities. This was then
divided by the number of enrolled under
graduates, to get a per student number, and
this was compared to the full tuition charge."
The study showed that Stanford's full tu
ition covered 58 percent of the amount spent
on the University per student per annum.
"Flipping that around, it costs us 72 per
cent more to provide the education than is
covered by tuition, before financial aid,"
Etchemendy said. "In other words, even the
full-paying student is getting a substantial


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
subsidy implicit financial aid
from the University."
He also chose to separate tu
ition from room and board, as Res
idential Housing & Dining Enter
prises are auxiliaries to the Univer
sity that "in theory ... charge ex
actly what it costs them to provide
the student housing and meals."
"I say 'in theory' because there
are explicit and implicit subsidies,"
he explained. "We have put in cen
tral University funds (gifts, re
serves) to subsidize building some
of the dorms, which is an explicit
subsidy that reduces the room and
board charges to the students, and,
of course, there is no land cost for
any of the facilities, which provides
an implicit subsidy that reduces the
cost of housing to the students. But
by and large, students pay for what
they get."

Evaluating Stanford's Value
Etchemendy was unclear on how
exactly to define the financial bene
fit that is, the amount a student
receives in financial aid as well as via
participation in campus programs
ranging from research grants to
overseas studies to on-campus Vol
unteer Student Organizations
(VSOs) derived from a Stanford
education.
"Some students take more ad
vantage of the opportunities at
Stanford than others," Etchemendy
said. "They participate in more ac
tivities, more programs and so forth.
Conversely, other students partici
pate in less. Is it possible that the lat
ter students are getting less than
they are paying for, while the for
mer are getting much more?"
Fie used the analogy of an
amusement park's entrance fee to
explain the situation.
"Some people go on more rides
than others," he said. "Does this
mean they are getting more than
they paid for, while the others are
getting less? It's hard to say. I think
a lot of the people who go on fewer
rides would disagree (think, for ex
ample, of the person who hates
roller coasters but enjoys other as
pects of the experience)."
He also compared the expense of
running different rides to the ex

events on campus because they
were during practice."

She also noted that the influence
of financial aid varies depending on
the sport, as some such as football
have many scholarships while oth
ers such as men's rowing have "vir
tually none."

Both athletes asked to remain
anonymous, as their coaches had
asked them to refrain from speak
ing with the press.

Cruz summarized the Stanford
experience as a direct function of
the individual as opposed to any
outside factors.

"Students try and find what they
really want at Stanford," he said.
"For some students, that's getting
really involved in student organiza
tions and groups and activism and
on-campus tutoring and using the
gym, and for other people that's
getting involved in social life, in
hanging out with their friends a lot
and having friends in classes."
"One thing I can note is that in
exit surveys, the number of students
who say that the Stanford experi
ence was not worth the cost is van
ishingly small (I don't have it in
front of me, but it's on the order of
1 or 2 percent.)," Etchemendy said.
"If anything, the positive feelings
get stronger among alumni looking
back on the experience and assess
ing its value. So I have to believe
that very few people give (in the
sense of pay) more than they get (in
terms of the self-assessed value of
the experience) at Stanford."

MACGREGOR-DENNIS 'l3
The University projects it will collect
$296.5 million in undergraduate student fees
for the 2011-12 academic year, reflecting a 3.8
percent increase over last year, and will award
$148.9 million in undergraduate financial aid,
a 1.5 percent increase over 2010-11.
The numbers project $57 million in rev
enue from undergraduate fees which in
clude tuition, room, board and miscellaneous
fees for 2011-12, as well as a 5.9 percent rev
enue increase over last year's $53.8 million.
For 2011-12, income from student tuition and
fees will represent 17.4 of the University's con
solidated budget revenue, while undergradu
ate financial aid will comprise six percent of
expenses.

Finance Cheat Sheet
According to University Vice President for
Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer
Randy Livingston, the average undergraduate
during 2010-11 received $19,000 in financial
aid, or approximately half of Stanford's tu
ition.

Financial aid draws on four primary
sources: department funds and expendable
gifts; endowment income, which provides the
bulk of support in the $70.5 million projected
for 2011-12 aid; President's Funds, including
alumni support from The Stanford Fund; and
general funds, drawn from the $1.04 billion set
aside for general University expenses.
The Provost's report to the Faculty Senate
provided a clear breakdown of where under
graduate tuition fees come from, the largest
two contributors being 58 percent from fami

lies themselves and 18 percent from endow
ments, gifts and other sources.
However, according to Livingston, these
numbers are much less clear-cut than they ap
pear. The total cost of educating a student for
2010-11 was $53,300, not including room and
board; tuition, however, was $38,688, meaning
students who paid full tuition received a
$14,600 subsidy 27 percent of the cost of
their education.

With the addition of financial aid, this
brought the average student subsidy to
$33,600 63 percent of the full cost of an un
dergraduate education.
"Figuring out exactly what we spend on ed
ucating students is challenging, as faculty
spend time teaching, advising and mentoring
students; undertaking research and serving in

leadership roles for the University," Liv
ingston wrote in an email to The Daily. "Peri
odically, we've undertaken studies to estimate
the cost of educating an undergraduate stu
dent, based on estimating the allocation of
time among faculty and other staff devoted to
this mission."

He said that the funds to make up this
$14,600 difference come "largely from Uni
versity endowments," including professor
ships for faculty and funds allotted to specific
programs such as Bing Overseas Studies.

Provost's Perspective
Provost John Etchemendy provided a sim
ilar calculation to demonstrate the Universi
ty's spending on its students.
"Several years ago, an outside group did a
study on the full cost of the undergraduate
education delivered at various colleges and
universities," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "This involved carefully figuring out
how much the university spends on under
graduate classes, programs, etc., and ex
cludes what is spent for graduate education,
research and other activities. This was then
divided by the number of enrolled under
graduates, to get a per student number, and
this was compared to the full tuition charge."
The study showed that Stanford's full tu
ition covered 58 percent of the amount spent
on the University per student per annum.
"Flipping that around, it costs us 72 per
cent more to provide the education than is
covered by tuition, before financial aid,"
Etchemendy said. "In other words, even the
full-paying student is getting a substantial


SERENITY NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
subsidy implicit financial aid
from the University."
He also chose to separate tu
ition from room and board, as Res
idential Housing & Dining Enter
prises are auxiliaries to the Univer
sity that "in theory ... charge ex
actly what it costs them to provide
the student housing and meals."
"I say 'in theory' because there
are explicit and implicit subsidies,"
he explained. "We have put in cen
tral University funds (gifts, re
serves) to subsidize building some
of the dorms, which is an explicit
subsidy that reduces the room and
board charges to the students, and,
of course, there is no land cost for
any of the facilities, which provides
an implicit subsidy that reduces the
cost of housing to the students. But
by and large, students pay for what
they get."

Evaluating Stanford's Value
Etchemendy was unclear on how
exactly to define the financial bene
fit that is, the amount a student
receives in financial aid as well as via
participation in campus programs
ranging from research grants to
overseas studies to on-campus Vol
unteer Student Organizations
(VSOs) derived from a Stanford
education.
"Some students take more ad
vantage of the opportunities at
Stanford than others," Etchemendy
said. "They participate in more ac
tivities, more programs and so forth.
Conversely, other students partici
pate in less. Is it possible that the lat
ter students are getting less than
they are paying for, while the for
mer are getting much more?"
Fie used the analogy of an
amusement park's entrance fee to
explain the situation.
"Some people go on more rides
than others," he said. "Does this
mean they are getting more than
they paid for, while the others are
getting less? It's hard to say. I think
a lot of the people who go on fewer
rides would disagree (think, for ex
ample, of the person who hates
roller coasters but enjoys other as
pects of the experience)."
He also compared the expense of
running different rides to the ex
pense of providing various classes at
Stanford. While Introductory Semi
nars have a small size and employ
senior faculty, increasing cost, larg
er introductory classes such as Sleep
and Dreams or Introductory Eco

nomics are "comparatively cheaper
for the University on a per-student
basis."
"But there's a reason these class
es are popular and grow large: ask
anyone who's taken Econ 1 from a
great teacher like John Taylor," he
explained. "Do these students 're
ceive less' from these highly popular
classes? I don't think so."

The Student Perspective

Michael Cruz 'l2 and Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, ASSU pres
ident and vice president respective
ly, provided a similar perspective on
the value of a Stanford education
and especially the role that financial
aid plays in determining that value.
"I think the most important thing
is for students not to have to worry
about their financial situation,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "The fi
nancial aid program will be success
ful if it allows students to not think
about money and just focus on ...
participation [in Stanford's ex
tracurricular opportunities], acade
mic success and enjoying Stanford."

Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper stated that the mission of
her office is just that: to remove fi
nancial aid from a student's decision
to attend Stanford.

"One of our goals in the financial
aid program is to take the financial
aspect out of that decision-making
process," she said. "I would much
rather see students choose an insti
tution based on their overall com
fort, their academic goals, etc., than
purely on a financial basis."
Cruz, however, used himself as
an exhibit of how financial aid can
define a student's Stanford experi
ence.

"Financial aid and on-campus
participation in clubs, tutoring and
other campus activities is very posi
tively correlated," he said. "I know
that if I wasn't [on financial aid] I
would have to get jobs that don't
necessarily interest me but pay
much better than the jobs that I
have had. I wouldn't be able to be
involved in any of the VSOs on cam
pus that have really helped make
my experience at Stanford."
Cooper provided a similar senti
ment.

"A large proportion of students
on financial aid are very grateful for
the assistance they're receiving and
realize they couldn't be here with
out it," she said. "Whether or not it
makes them more anxious to take
advantage of opportunities on cam
pus, I think that has much more to
do with the individual student's per
sonality.

"I can name off dozens of stu
dents with the same situation; just

read any TSF [The Stanford Fund]
letter, and you can see the positive
correlation between those two,"
Cruz said.

He also pointed to a potential
correlation between financial aid
and academic success.

"Everyone who comes to Stan
ford has an equal chance at academ
ic success, and I think that for a lot of
students, one of the big factors that
could hinder academic success is
worrying about financial aid, partic
ularly at institutions that don't offer
strong financial aid packages like
Stanford," he said. "Those two are
positively correlated that is,
when students have better financial
security, whether it's through their
parents, through financial aid,
through scholarships that they got, I
think it definitely helps their acade
mic success."

The Student Stand

Some students suggested that fi
nancial aid, as well as the ancillary
benefits and costs derived from it,
does not have a consequential im
pact on their enjoyment of Stanford.
One rising sophomore who re
ceives a $39,000 per annum scholar
ship differentiated between a stu
dent's ability and decision to partic
ipate. She asked to remain anony
mous to protect her personal finan
cial information.

"If you're in your dorm room all
day not doing anything, then I sup
pose the school's not spending on
you because you're not going out
there to take those opportunities,"
she said. "People might have differ
ent experiences, but I don't think
that's based on how much Stan
ford's spending, it's based on how
much you personally are spending."
One former varsity athlete who
is entering her junior year estimates
that only about 10 percent of varsi
ty athletes receive a full scholarship
at Stanford.

"[Financial aid affects] sense of
worth as an athlete and making tu
ition affordable, but the Stanford
campus and atmosphere have the
ability to win people over," she
said.

She justified some of the ancil
lary benefits that Stanford funds for
athletes as instrumental to academ
ic and athletic success; for example,
most non-athletic tutoring on cam
pus takes place at the same time as
practices. She did, however, note
that athletic involvement precludes
participation in some other Univer
sity-funded experiences such as
overseas study.
Another current varsity athlete
stated that she would have come to
Stanford "no matter what," but that
the athletic experience is "give and
take."

"It's really a draw," she said.
"For example, the job I'm working
this summer, I was first ... ex
posed to it from the athlete lun
cheon, but I actually couldn't at
tend all of the company's other
events on campus because they
were during practice."

She also noted that the influence
of financial aid varies depending on
the sport, as some such as football
have many scholarships while oth
ers such as men's rowing have "vir
tually none."

Both athletes asked to remain
anonymous, as their coaches had
asked them to refrain from speak
