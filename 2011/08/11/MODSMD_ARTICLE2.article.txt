## UNIVERSITY University projects $57M in undergrad fee revenue 
### ELLORA ISRANI NEWS EDITOR 
The University projects it will collect
$296.5 million in undergraduate student fees
for the 2011-12 academic year, reflecting a 3.8
percent increase over last year, and will award
$148.9 million in undergraduate financial aid,
a 1.5 percent increase over 2010-11.
The numbers project $57 million in rev
enue from undergraduate fees which in
clude tuition, room, board and miscellaneous
fees for 2011-12, as well as a 5.9 percent rev
enue increase over last year's $53.8 million.
For 2011-12, income from student tuition and
fees will represent 17.4 of the University's con
solidated budget revenue, while undergradu
ate financial aid will comprise six percent of
expenses.

Finance Cheat Sheet
According to University Vice President for
Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer
Randy Livingston, the average undergraduate
during 2010-11 received $19,000 in financial
aid, or approximately half of Stanford's tu
ition.

Financial aid draws on four primary
sources: department funds and expendable
gifts; endowment income, which provides the
bulk of support in the $70.5 million projected
for 2011-12 aid; President's Funds, including
alumni support from The Stanford Fund; and
general funds, drawn from the $1.04 billion set
aside for general University expenses.
The Provost's report to the Faculty Senate
provided a clear breakdown of where under
graduate tuition fees come from, the largest
two contributors being 58 percent from fami

lies themselves and 18 percent from endow
ments, gifts and other sources.
However, according to Livingston, these
numbers are much less clear-cut than they ap
pear. The total cost of educating a student for
2010-11 was $53,300, not including room and
board; tuition, however, was $38,688, meaning
students who paid full tuition received a
$14,600 subsidy 27 percent of the cost of
their education.

With the addition of financial aid, this
brought the average student subsidy to
$33,600 63 percent of the full cost of an un
dergraduate education.
"Figuring out exactly what we spend on ed
ucating students is challenging, as faculty
spend time teaching, advising and mentoring
students; undertaking research and serving in

leadership roles for the University," Liv
ingston wrote in an email to The Daily. "Peri
odically, we've undertaken studies to estimate
the cost of educating an undergraduate stu
dent, based on estimating the allocation of
time among faculty and other staff devoted to
this mission."

He said that the funds to make up this
$14,600 difference come "largely from Uni
versity endowments," including professor
ships for faculty and funds allotted to specific
programs such as Bing Overseas Studies.

Provost's Perspective
Provost John Etchemendy provided a sim
ilar calculation to demonstrate the Universi
ty's spending on its students.
"Several years ago, an outside group did a
study on the full cost of the undergraduate
education delivered at various colleges and
universities," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "This involved carefully figuring out
how much the university spends on under
graduate classes, programs, etc., and ex
cludes what is spent for graduate education,
research and other activities. This was then
divided by the number of enrolled under
graduates, to get a per student number, and
this was compared to the full tuition charge."
The study showed that Stanford's full tu
ition covered 58 percent of the amount spent
on the University per student per annum.
"Flipping that around, it costs us 72 per
cent more to provide the education than is
covered by tuition, before financial aid,"
Etchemendy said. "In other words, even the
full-paying student is getting a substantial
