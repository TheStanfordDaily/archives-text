# Finding happiness with Miranda July

Miranda July is doodling. She has been
sitting in a small conference room at
the Four Seasons all day. In front of
her is a neat hotel notepad. In the comer of the
room, away from the table, is a platter of sugar
dusted brownies and oatmeal cookies, a bowl of
sliiny fruits and an iced champagne bowl filled
with Perrier and San Pellegrino. The treats appear
untouched. On the round table before her are

wine glasses and a sweating pitcher of ice water.
Miranda's glass is turned down, her side of the
table untouched by crumbs. She is as ill adapted
to this room as to a cardboard set, and the only
piece of the space she's disturbed is the first page
of the notepad before her. Even there, her mark is
minor, her scribbles small and few.

July is here to promote her second film,
"The Future," released Aug. 19. In her latest, we
meet an identically coiffed and restless couple,
Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater). The
film, wliile elevating the sense of whimsy inherent
in July's previous work, is also darker than her
first film.

"I wanted to kind of move into sadness or
find away to do that, because... well, it was sort
of a dark time, I was ending a relationship, there
was a lot of change in my life," July explained.
"The Future" is a sharp and honest look at
happiness—what it means to be happy when, at
age 30-something, you find yourself lacking those
accomplishments you'd thought would come in
time. An earlier title for the film was simply
"Satisfaction."

Happiness is something July is learning in
her own life. Recently married to "Beginners"
director Mike Mills, July seems to be in a much

better place than the "dark time" that "The
Future" was born of years ago.
"When the thing I'm writing or making is
good, there's nothing that quite beats the high of
that, for better or worse," she said. "But I think
more and more I'm figuring out how to be

happy not working."
But July is insistent that though the themes
of the film are aligned with themes she's pon
dered and learning, her work —aside from one

short story — has never been autobiographical.
This is, admittedly, hard to believe. July creates
and plays her protagonists, who are often artists
of a sort. Nevertheless, July insists, time and
again, that she is not her characters.

"I've never written autobiography, it just
doesn't seem to work" she said. Yet it's impossi
ble to argue that the themes of any artist's work
are entirely divorced from their reality.
July added, "but at the same time, issues of..
. worrying about time, getting paralyzed, thinking
about having children and fleeing your life, these
are all things in the abstract I've thought about.
There's just nothing in the movie that happened
in real life."

Despite this insistence, July's film does draw
some eerie real-life parallels. Linklater looks strik
ingly like her ex-boyffiend. There is a moment of
