# Finding happiness with Miranda July
##

Miranda July is doodling. She has been
sitting in a small conference room at
the Four Seasons all day. In front of
her is a neat hotel notepad. In the comer of the
room, away from the table, is a platter of sugar
dusted brownies and oatmeal cookies, a bowl of
sliiny fruits and an iced champagne bowl filled
with Perrier and San Pellegrino. The treats appear
untouched. On the round table before her are

wine glasses and a sweating pitcher of ice water.
Miranda's glass is turned down, her side of the
table untouched by crumbs. She is as ill adapted
to this room as to a cardboard set, and the only
piece of the space she's disturbed is the first page
of the notepad before her. Even there, her mark is
minor, her scribbles small and few.

July is here to promote her second film,
"The Future," released Aug. 19. In her latest, we
meet an identically coiffed and restless couple,
Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater). The
film, wliile elevating the sense of whimsy inherent
in July's previous work, is also darker than her
first film.

"I wanted to kind of move into sadness or
find away to do that, because... well, it was sort
of a dark time, I was ending a relationship, there
was a lot of change in my life," July explained.
"The Future" is a sharp and honest look at
happiness—what it means to be happy when, at
age 30-something, you find yourself lacking those
accomplishments you'd thought would come in
time. An earlier title for the film was simply
"Satisfaction."

Happiness is something July is learning in
her own life. Recently married to "Beginners"
director Mike Mills, July seems to be in a much

better place than the "dark time" that "The
Future" was born of years ago.
"When the thing I'm writing or making is
good, there's nothing that quite beats the high of
that, for better or worse," she said. "But I think
more and more I'm figuring out how to be

happy not working."
But July is insistent that though the themes
of the film are aligned with themes she's pon
dered and learning, her work —aside from one

short story — has never been autobiographical.
This is, admittedly, hard to believe. July creates
and plays her protagonists, who are often artists
of a sort. Nevertheless, July insists, time and
again, that she is not her characters.

"I've never written autobiography, it just
doesn't seem to work" she said. Yet it's impossi
ble to argue that the themes of any artist's work
are entirely divorced from their reality.
July added, "but at the same time, issues of..
. worrying about time, getting paralyzed, thinking
about having children and fleeing your life, these
are all things in the abstract I've thought about.
There's just nothing in the movie that happened
in real life."

Despite this insistence, July's film does draw
some eerie real-life parallels. Linklater looks strik
ingly like her ex-boyffiend. There is a moment of

magical realism in "The Future" when, as Sophie leaves her
boyfriend and apartment behind, her security blanket Shirty
moves of its own volition and follows her down the street.

"I have a yellow shirt... like [Sophie's]. Mine's called
Nighty," she said. "My thinking was, okay, that shirt... pre
dates everything. Every boyfriend, my whole career, every
thing. Like, that is so essentially me that if I were ever t0...
forsake myself and try to flee my soul, my creativity, my life,
everything that identifies me, I think my shirt might come
crawling after me?"
July looked at us, imploring.

"Or that would be a good symbol of how... how you
can't do that, you can't actually divorce from your essential
self," she continued. "I used it in that way... to sort of
externalize the way you haunt yourself."
July is a tiny woman, as small and thin as a child, with
big, ocean-blue eyes. In the past decade, she has dabbled in
every medium, from her collection of heartbreaking short
stories, "No One Belongs Here More Than You," to her art
exhibit, "The Hallway," to her Web project, "Learning to
luve You More."
But right now, she is doodling. I've just asked her what
the most critical quality for an artist working today would
be. Her eyes widen for a moment, threatening to take over
her face.

"That's going to require the paper," she said, her hand
idly reaching for the pen.

When prompted on the slightly averse take of "The
Future" on the World Wide Web (the two main characters
shut off the Internet for 30 days in order to free themselves
to their goals), July backpedals a bit.

"There will always be people changing what is valuable,
but I don't think the Web is important, I think you could
be making paintings and be a young and important artist
now, just as long as it's coming from a place of mystery."
There are a lot of messages in Miranda July's work.
Most are calls to action: to seize, to love, to do. When asked
about the "message" she'd like to write on every white
board in America, she passes through her words like a mini
flipbook.

"When I used to perform live, I would often find
myself saying, 'This is really happening,"' she said.
July's voice catches a kind of excitement here. Her eyes
dash from mine to the other reporter's and back.
"I think there's so much of a story or a movie playing
in our heads all of the time that if the sentence could snap
me and other people out of that for just a second of like
whoa, that's crazy, yeah," she added. "The present."

magical realism in "The Future" when, as Sophie leaves her
boyfriend and apartment behind, her security blanket Shirty
moves of its own volition and follows her down the street.

"I have a yellow shirt... like [Sophie's]. Mine's called
Nighty," she said. "My thinking was, okay, that shirt... pre
dates everything. Every boyfriend, my whole career, every
thing. Like, that is so essentially me that if I were ever t0...
forsake myself and try to flee my soul, my creativity, my life,
everything that identifies me, I think my shirt might come
crawling after me?"
July looked at us, imploring.

"Or that would be a good symbol of how... how you
can't do that, you can't actually divorce from your essential
self," she continued. "I used it in that way... to sort of
externalize the way you haunt yourself."
July is a tiny woman, as small and thin as a child, with
big, ocean-blue eyes. In the past decade, she has dabbled in
every medium, from her collection of heartbreaking short
stories, "No One Belongs Here More Than You," to her art
exhibit, "The Hallway," to her Web project, "Learning to
luve You More."
But right now, she is doodling. I've just asked her what
the most critical quality for an artist working today would
be. Her eyes widen for a moment, threatening to take over
her face.

"That's going to require the paper," she said, her hand
idly reaching for the pen.

When prompted on the slightly averse take of "The
Future" on the World Wide Web (the two main characters
shut off the Internet for 30 days in order to free themselves
to their goals), July backpedals a bit.

"There will always be people changing what is valuable,
but I don't think the Web is important, I think you could
be making paintings and be a young and important artist
now, just as long as it's coming from a place of mystery."
There are a lot of messages in Miranda July's work.
Most are calls to action: to seize, to love, to do. When asked
about the "message" she'd like to write on every white
board in America, she passes through her words like a mini
flipbook.

"When I used to perform live, I would often find
myself saying, 'This is really happening,"' she said.
July's voice catches a kind of excitement here. Her eyes
dash from mine to the other reporter's and back.
"I think there's so much of a story or a movie playing
in our heads all of the time that if the sentence could snap
me and other people out of that for just a second of like
whoa, that's crazy, yeah," she added. "The present."
Miranda July is doodling. She has been
sitting in a small conference room at
the Four Seasons all day. In front of
her is a neat hotel notepad. In the comer of the
room, away from the table, is a platter of sugar
dusted brownies and oatmeal cookies, a bowl of
sliiny fruits and an iced champagne bowl filled
with Perrier and San Pellegrino. The treats appear
untouched. On the round table before her are

wine glasses and a sweating pitcher of ice water.
Miranda's glass is turned down, her side of the
table untouched by crumbs. She is as ill adapted
to this room as to a cardboard set, and the only
piece of the space she's disturbed is the first page
of the notepad before her. Even there, her mark is
minor, her scribbles small and few.

July is here to promote her second film,
"The Future," released Aug. 19. In her latest, we
meet an identically coiffed and restless couple,
Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater). The
film, wliile elevating the sense of whimsy inherent
in July's previous work, is also darker than her
first film.

"I wanted to kind of move into sadness or
find away to do that, because... well, it was sort
of a dark time, I was ending a relationship, there
was a lot of change in my life," July explained.
"The Future" is a sharp and honest look at
happiness—what it means to be happy when, at
age 30-something, you find yourself lacking those
accomplishments you'd thought would come in
time. An earlier title for the film was simply
"Satisfaction."

Happiness is something July is learning in
her own life. Recently married to "Beginners"
director Mike Mills, July seems to be in a much

better place than the "dark time" that "The
Future" was born of years ago.
"When the thing I'm writing or making is
good, there's nothing that quite beats the high of
that, for better or worse," she said. "But I think
more and more I'm figuring out how to be

happy not working."
But July is insistent that though the themes
of the film are aligned with themes she's pon
dered and learning, her work —aside from one

short story — has never been autobiographical.
This is, admittedly, hard to believe. July creates
and plays her protagonists, who are often artists
of a sort. Nevertheless, July insists, time and
again, that she is not her characters.

"I've never written autobiography, it just
doesn't seem to work" she said. Yet it's impossi
ble to argue that the themes of any artist's work
are entirely divorced from their reality.
July added, "but at the same time, issues of..
. worrying about time, getting paralyzed, thinking
about having children and fleeing your life, these
are all things in the abstract I've thought about.
There's just nothing in the movie that happened
in real life."

Despite this insistence, July's film does draw
some eerie real-life parallels. Linklater looks strik
ingly like her ex-boyffiend. There is a moment of

magical realism in "The Future" when, as Sophie leaves her
boyfriend and apartment behind, her security blanket Shirty
moves of its own volition and follows her down the street.
