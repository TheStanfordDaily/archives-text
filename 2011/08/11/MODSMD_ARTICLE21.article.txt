## Ashley never learned subtlety 
### – eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
Bad news, everyone! Despite my
best efforts, I got the results of
"The Bachelorette" spoiled for
me just a day before watching the
episode. I brought it upon myself, real
ly. It only took a few shots of tequila
before my dearest bunkmate casually
name-dropped the winner of the
show. She didn't even say "spoiler
alert" —party foul, roomie.
But we digress! This episode is
the very last of the season, in which
Ben and JP (and all of us, of course)
get to meet Ashley's family. She's got a
boring, dim-witted mom and a bor
ing, overweight dad and a boring, sup
portive brother, but she's also got this
spectacularly black-sheep sister. My
first impression was actually a positive
one: Big Sis rocks the long, dark, Amy-

Winehouse hair, and her pale arms are
covered with tattoos. Looking at where
she came from and at her happy little

duckling of a sister, I want to high five
her. But this positive first impression
would very quickly be replaced by the
blackest of loathing.
When JP saunters into frame, I
swoon, as per usual (on that note, I've
decided that my next life goal is to find
myself a JP. If you go to Stanford and
look/act like JP, call me. Seriously
though. Let's make this happen). To
my consternation, though, Asliley's
sister did not swoon. She didn't even
giggle. In fact, she did a lot of scowling
and glaring, which turned my instinc
tive affection toward her into an all
consuming, audibly howled rage,

because anyone who does not love JP
deserves to be shot and then torn to
pieces by wild dogs. As time passed,
the situation only worsened: the sister

decided based on an extremely arbi
trary snap judgment within the first
five minutes of meeting the PERFECT
FREAKING MAN that "oooh, he's

not the one for you, Ash." She pro
ceeded to explain to her sister that

she's "the more rational one," and that
Ashley's only going based on "gut
instinct," even though the dumb sister
is going 100 percent based on instinct
and reflex. Christ, I hate hypocrisy,
and poor Ash is too dumb to even call
her out on it—she reacts (unsurpris
ingly) by bursting into tears, the poor
dear. I was literally shouting with rage
as I was forced to listen to stupid, fugly
Big Sis going on about how "ooh, I'm
so rational! That's why I'm making

this decision based on two minutes of
pretty much nothing, because I'm the
smart sister!"

JP, of course, took it like a man;
when Bitchface informed him that he
was a sleazy old man who was trying to
take advantage of her sister and then
suck the joy out of the whole family, he
remained calm and rational and as

sexy as always. She managed to really
rattle the guy, though. At the end of the
day, Ash called her sister a bitch and
left, and I was freaking glad.
Ben's experience with the family
was less eventful but cuter; as much as
Ben's stupidly terrible fashion sense
makes it impossible for me to be
attracted to him, he has been awfully
cute these days. I've come to the pret
ty firm conclusion that he's probably
technically better for her than JP
would have been. For their date, they
went to a waterhole full of "healing
mud" and slathered each other's bod
ies with the brown muck, which is (in
Ben's own creepily monotonous
words) "really erotic ." Ash again
astounded us with her bluntness;
while running her hands over his
body, she giggles, "I wish I could
reach lower, so I could just " and I
kid you not, she went straight for the
jewels. WHAT? WHO TAUGHT
YOU SUBTLETY? Secretly, I think it's
kind of adorable, though. And when
Ben finally told her he loved her, I
couldn't help but sigh along with her.
Ben was pretty endearing which
made me absolutely terrified that she
was going to break his heart—
though when it comes down to it,
better him than JP.
JP's one-on-one date featured
nothing to write home about other

than his extreme, ridiculous, inhu
man attractiveness. When they dis
cussed Ashley's sister's opinion of

him, he got so authoritative and
strong and forceful that I pretty much
melted onto the couch. He told her he
loved her and wrote her the sweetest
letter I've ever seen in my life.
At the end of the day, it came
down to the choice between the man
she was technically more compatible
with (Ben) or the literal perfect man.
Unfortunately for Ben, Ashley's
human: how could she choose any
thing but the perfect man? We all
knew from the start that JP was the
only real contender. I really, really felt
for Ben, though she let him get
down on his knee and just stood there
in silence as he proposed. It was vis
cerally painful to watch. She tried to
compliment him, but he told her not
to sugarcoat it (which I respect) and
left.
"You can't leave something like
this on good terms," he said, which is
completely right. What makes me
angry is that she didn't have to put
him through that. Last year, Ali (a
wonderful girl) took her second-place
guy aside ahead of time to spare him

having to propose and be humiliated;
Ash just let it happen. It's kind of dis
turbing.
Of course, I'm easily distracted,
and the moment IP appeared, all
thoughts of Ben flew from my head.
He swaggered out of the helicopter, all
James Bond in his tux, and the way he
looked at her took my breath away.
They are beautiful together.
You know, when you look
beyond the inherently creepy,
voyeuristic aspect of the premise of
"The Bachelorette," this experience
has actually been kind of beautiful. I
watched these two people meet, I saw
their first kiss, I watched their rela
tionship grow and develop and
flower, and now I get to see their wed
ding, and I always cry at weddings.
Seeing him approach her, I got chills.
God, they're getting married I knew
them when they were just a couple of
dumb kids hugging hello and flirting
poolside, and now they're getting
married. You know what? I'm not
even ashamed to say it anymore: I
love this show.

left.
"You can't leave something like
this on good terms," he said, which is
completely right. What makes me
angry is that she didn't have to put
him through that. Last year, Ali (a
wonderful girl) took her second-place
guy aside ahead of time to spare him

having to propose and be humiliated;
Ash just let it happen. It's kind of dis
turbing.
Of course, I'm easily distracted,
and the moment IP appeared, all
thoughts of Ben flew from my head.
He swaggered out of the helicopter, all
James Bond in his tux, and the way he
looked at her took my breath away.
They are beautiful together.
You know, when you look
beyond the inherently creepy,
voyeuristic aspect of the premise of
"The Bachelorette," this experience
has actually been kind of beautiful. I
watched these two people meet, I saw
their first kiss, I watched their rela
tionship grow and develop and
flower, and now I get to see their wed
ding, and I always cry at weddings.
Seeing him approach her, I got chills.
God, they're getting married I knew
them when they were just a couple of
dumb kids hugging hello and flirting
poolside, and now they're getting
married. You know what? I'm not
even ashamed to say it anymore: I
love this show.

Bad news, everyone! Despite my
best efforts, I got the results of
"The Bachelorette" spoiled for
me just a day before watching the
episode. I brought it upon myself, real
ly. It only took a few shots of tequila
before my dearest bunkmate casually
name-dropped the winner of the
show. She didn't even say "spoiler
alert" —party foul, roomie.
But we digress! This episode is
the very last of the season, in which
Ben and JP (and all of us, of course)
get to meet Ashley's family. She's got a
boring, dim-witted mom and a bor
ing, overweight dad and a boring, sup
portive brother, but she's also got this
spectacularly black-sheep sister. My
first impression was actually a positive
one: Big Sis rocks the long, dark, Amy-

Winehouse hair, and her pale arms are
covered with tattoos. Looking at where
she came from and at her happy little

duckling of a sister, I want to high five
her. But this positive first impression
would very quickly be replaced by the
blackest of loathing.
When JP saunters into frame, I
swoon, as per usual (on that note, I've
decided that my next life goal is to find
myself a JP. If you go to Stanford and
look/act like JP, call me. Seriously
though. Let's make this happen). To
my consternation, though, Asliley's
sister did not swoon. She didn't even
giggle. In fact, she did a lot of scowling
and glaring, which turned my instinc
tive affection toward her into an all
consuming, audibly howled rage,

because anyone who does not love JP
deserves to be shot and then torn to
pieces by wild dogs. As time passed,
the situation only worsened: the sister

decided based on an extremely arbi
trary snap judgment within the first
five minutes of meeting the PERFECT
FREAKING MAN that "oooh, he's

not the one for you, Ash." She pro
ceeded to explain to her sister that

she's "the more rational one," and that
Ashley's only going based on "gut
instinct," even though the dumb sister
is going 100 percent based on instinct
and reflex. Christ, I hate hypocrisy,
and poor Ash is too dumb to even call
her out on it—she reacts (unsurpris
ingly) by bursting into tears, the poor
dear. I was literally shouting with rage
as I was forced to listen to stupid, fugly
Big Sis going on about how "ooh, I'm
so rational! That's why I'm making

this decision based on two minutes of
pretty much nothing, because I'm the
smart sister!"

JP, of course, took it like a man;
when Bitchface informed him that he
was a sleazy old man who was trying to
take advantage of her sister and then
suck the joy out of the whole family, he
remained calm and rational and as

sexy as always. She managed to really
rattle the guy, though. At the end of the
day, Ash called her sister a bitch and
left, and I was freaking glad.
Ben's experience with the family
was less eventful but cuter; as much as
Ben's stupidly terrible fashion sense
makes it impossible for me to be
attracted to him, he has been awfully
cute these days. I've come to the pret
ty firm conclusion that he's probably
technically better for her than JP
would have been. For their date, they
went to a waterhole full of "healing
mud" and slathered each other's bod
ies with the brown muck, which is (in
Ben's own creepily monotonous
words) "really erotic ." Ash again
astounded us with her bluntness;
while running her hands over his
body, she giggles, "I wish I could
reach lower, so I could just " and I
kid you not, she went straight for the
jewels. WHAT? WHO TAUGHT
YOU SUBTLETY? Secretly, I think it's
kind of adorable, though. And when
Ben finally told her he loved her, I
couldn't help but sigh along with her.
Ben was pretty endearing which
made me absolutely terrified that she
was going to break his heart—
though when it comes down to it,
better him than JP.
JP's one-on-one date featured
nothing to write home about other

than his extreme, ridiculous, inhu
man attractiveness. When they dis
cussed Ashley's sister's opinion of

him, he got so authoritative and
strong and forceful that I pretty much
melted onto the couch. He told her he
loved her and wrote her the sweetest
letter I've ever seen in my life.
At the end of the day, it came
down to the choice between the man
she was technically more compatible
with (Ben) or the literal perfect man.
Unfortunately for Ben, Ashley's
human: how could she choose any
thing but the perfect man? We all
knew from the start that JP was the
only real contender. I really, really felt
for Ben, though she let him get
down on his knee and just stood there
in silence as he proposed. It was vis
cerally painful to watch. She tried to
compliment him, but he told her not
to sugarcoat it (which I respect) and
left.
"You can't leave something like
this on good terms," he said, which is
completely right. What makes me
