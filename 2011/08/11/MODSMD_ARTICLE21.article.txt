# TV RECAP
## Ashley never learned subtlety 
### – eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
Bad news, everyone! Despite my
best efforts, I got the results of
"The Bachelorette" spoiled for
me just a day before watching the
episode. I brought it upon myself, real
ly. It only took a few shots of tequila
before my dearest bunkmate casually
name-dropped the winner of the
show. She didn't even say "spoiler
alert" —party foul, roomie.
But we digress! This episode is
the very last of the season, in which
Ben and JP (and all of us, of course)
get to meet Ashley's family. She's got a
boring, dim-witted mom and a bor
ing, overweight dad and a boring, sup
portive brother, but she's also got this
spectacularly black-sheep sister. My
first impression was actually a positive
one: Big Sis rocks the long, dark, Amy-

Winehouse hair, and her pale arms are
covered with tattoos. Looking at where
she came from and at her happy little

duckling of a sister, I want to high five
her. But this positive first impression
would very quickly be replaced by the
blackest of loathing.
When JP saunters into frame, I
swoon, as per usual (on that note, I've
decided that my next life goal is to find
myself a JP. If you go to Stanford and
look/act like JP, call me. Seriously
though. Let's make this happen). To
my consternation, though, Asliley's
sister did not swoon. She didn't even
giggle. In fact, she did a lot of scowling
and glaring, which turned my instinc
tive affection toward her into an all
consuming, audibly howled rage,

because anyone who does not love JP
deserves to be shot and then torn to
pieces by wild dogs. As time passed,
the situation only worsened: the sister

decided based on an extremely arbi
trary snap judgment within the first
five minutes of meeting the PERFECT
FREAKING MAN that "oooh, he's

not the one for you, Ash." She pro
ceeded to explain to her sister that

she's "the more rational one," and that
Ashley's only going based on "gut
instinct," even though the dumb sister
is going 100 percent based on instinct
and reflex. Christ, I hate hypocrisy,
and poor Ash is too dumb to even call
her out on it—she reacts (unsurpris
ingly) by bursting into tears, the poor
dear. I was literally shouting with rage
as I was forced to listen to stupid, fugly
Big Sis going on about how "ooh, I'm
so rational! That's why I'm making

this decision based on two minutes of
pretty much nothing, because I'm the
smart sister!"

JP, of course, took it like a man;
when Bitchface informed him that he
was a sleazy old man who was trying to
take advantage of her sister and then
suck the joy out of the whole family, he
remained calm and rational and as

sexy as always. She managed to really
rattle the guy, though. At the end of the
day, Ash called her sister a bitch and
left, and I was freaking glad.
