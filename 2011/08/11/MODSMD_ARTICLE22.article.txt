# MUSIC REVIEW
## Kayne, Jay-Z's 'Throne' a powerful collaboration 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
-w-ay-Z and Kanye West need no
I introductions and have no short-
M ages of fans. So, of course, when
they announced their collaboration
on a full-length album, the duo, who
have been working together on vari
ous projects for over a decade, hardly
needed to do any further advertise
ment. They could have been writing
a series of children's fairytales, and
they might've outsold J.K. Rowling.
And with this knowledge, the pair
did little to promote their work a
move that, for anyone else, would be
ridiculously foolish. However, the
duo let their album, "Watch The
Throne," talk, and what it's saying is
that the two masterminds might just
be as good together as they are apart.

"Throne" simultaneously gives

Jay-Z's more
rugged style a
glossy finish
and roughs up
West's finesse
all, of course,
with a healthy
dose of swag.
The album is
ridiculously

strong; for these two, there are no
space fillers or last-minute thoughts.
The duo showcase their egos, of
course, most notably in the grimier
"Who Gon Stop Me," while deliver
ing moving messages to their future
children in "New Day" and throwing
in a dash of oldies with "Otis," which
features a sample from '6os soul artist
Otis Redding. The lyrics are both
clever (" Prince William...
[should've] married Kate & Ashley")
and poignant ("7 taught them how to
be kings/But all they wanted was to be
soldiers"). In short, they hit all the
major points that a good rap album
should.
But with not one but two mam
moth personalities in the studio,
there was bound to be a bit of a clash
between titans. As smoothly as the

beats of The Neptunes mediate con
flict between the two heavy hitters,
these are, after all, Jay-Z and Kanye
West. Each artist is used to stealing
the show on their own nothing
more than that needs to be said
about West and the result is a

tug-of-war that brings a prodigious
work down a couple notches.
For instance, "Niggas In Paris,"
though one of the stunners from the
album, features West as somewhat of
an afterthought to a masterpiece.
Perhaps West wants to make up for
"Lift Off," which he and Beyonce
Knowles (particularly Knowles, in

this case) take over. Whether or not
the duo meant to equally distribute
the wealth at the song level remains
unclear, but their chemistry might
have been a little smoother, especial
ly considering how long the pair has
worked in tandem.
A lack of chemistry, though,
seems forgivable in exchange for a
pair of shiny new thrones as the
undeniable current kings of hip-hop.
The duo's pairing is certainly the
most powerful full-length rap collab
oration in recent memory, if not
ever. To label "Throne," which
showcases the heights that hip-hop
can reach, as anything but a success
would be erroneous.
