## Football training camp kicks off 
### â€“ Joseph Beyda 
The Stanford football team began its final
preparations for the 2011 season on Monday,
with a no-pads practice that lasted about two
and a half hours.

All eyes were on new head coach David
Shaw and Heisman Trophy-favorite Andrew
Luck. The redshirt junior quarterback was
excited to end the summer.

"I was very excited to come out," Luck
said. "The first practice is always something. I
had a former coach describe it like Christmas.
It's fun to be out here with all the guys and
sort of put life away to just focus on football."
Having shaved his beard since Pac-12

Media Day, Luck threw well, but he still saw
room for improvement. Shaw echoed that
sentiment for the team as a whole.

"I told the guys that it was pretty good,"
Shaw said. "But that's not what our standard
is. Our standard is to be better, to be more
exact, to be faster. And we have work to do."

"We want to be as good as we can every
single time we step on the playing field," he
added.

Coaches nationwide have high expecta
tions for the Cardinal as well, ranking Stan
ford No. 6 in the USA Today/Coaches Poll,
the highest preseason ranking in program his
tory. AP rankings are released this week.
Junior tight end Levine Toilolo and senior
wide receiver Chris Owusu were both back
out on the field after sustaining injuries last
season. Toilolo missed the whole year after
tearing both his ACL and MCL on Stanford's
second play from scrimmage in the opener
against Sacramento State.
To prevent players from re-injuring any
existing conditions, practices are starting out
light.

"We just want to see how hard we can run,
how fast we can run, and in a couple days,
we'll put the pads on," Shaw said.
