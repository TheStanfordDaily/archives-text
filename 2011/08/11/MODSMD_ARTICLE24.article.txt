Stanford Swimming took second place
overall at the ConocoPhillips U.S. National
Championships held at the Avery Aquatic

lays and nine total medals propelled the Car

dinal to its strong finish.
Both Stanford gold medals came early in
the meet on the same day. Bobby Bollier won
the 200-meter fly, and the Stanford women
took the 4xloo free relay last Tuesday.
The Cardinal took over the relays late in
the week, finishing second in the men's 4x200
free relay and third in the women's 4x200 free
as well as in both 4xloo medley relays. Other

Stanford medalists included sophomore
Maya Dißado, who took second in the 400
IM and third in the 200 fly, and graduate
Elaine Breeden, who placed third in the 100
fly. Graduate Kate Dwelley also won the con
solation final in the 100 free.
Tucson Ford Dealers won the men's,
women's and overall competitions, with the
Cardinal finishing 45, 51 and 96 points out of
the lead in each, respectively.
Ongoing are the Speedo Junior National
Championships, which will end Friday and
are also being held at Stanford.
