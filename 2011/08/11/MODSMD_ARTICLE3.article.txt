## Professors respond to American economic volatility 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
Congress's Aug. 2 approval of
a last-minute debt ceiling in
crease marked the beginning of
at least a week of instability in the
U.S. economy, which included
Standard & Poor's (S&P) down
grading the country's credit rat
ing, volatility in the stock markets
and the Federal Reserve Bank's
announcement that it will main
tain low federal interest rates.

American economists, includ
ing those at Stanford, have a vari
ety of theories as to how the situ
ation came to be, as well as how it
will play out.
Economic Turmoil
The flurry of economic activi
ty began Aug. 2 when President
Barack Obama signed the Bud
get Control Act of 2011 into law,
hours before the U.S. was expect
ed to default on its debt obliga

tions. The law immediately ex
tended the $14.3 trillion debt ceil
ing by $4OO billion and gave the
President the option of future ex
tensions, subject to a vote by
Congress. The debt ceiling could
be raised by as much as $2.4 tril
lion total.

In return for the debt ceiling
increase, the law mandated $917
billion worth of reductions in
government spending in two
parts over the next 10 years. $2l

billion of these cuts will occur
during the 2012 fiscal year and
the remainder will materialize
after.

The bill also created the Joint
Select Committee on Deficit Re
duction to suggest $1.5 trillion in
spending cuts over the next 10
years. The committee of six De
mocrats and six Republicans,
equally split between the House
and the Senate, must make recom
mendations by Nov. 23.
If Congress does not approve at
least $1.2 trillion in cuts by Dec. 23,
reductions will automatically come
from mandatory and discretionary
funds in both defense and domestic
accounts. Debate over addressing
the deficit whether and by how
much to raise revenue through in
creasing taxes, and whether to re
duce spending and by how much
accounted for Congress' inability to
produce legislation until the last
moment.

Stanford Reflections

Stanford economic experts have
expressed differing views on the
Budget Control Act.
"There were differences of opin
ion about whether spending limits
should be associated with the debt
limit increase," said economics pro
fessor John Taylor Ph.D. '73. "The
deliberation was over how to add
cuts, which the Speaker said was
necessary. The debate was also
over whether taxes increased

Republicans did not want to have
that."

"The bill was definitely a com
promise," Taylor said. "It included
things that Republicans wanted
like spending reductions but not
as much as they would have liked."
Economics professor Gavin
Wright believes that the Republi
cans have gained significantly from
the act.

"The Republican party decided
to use this as a sticking point for
some of their agenda," Wright said.
"The majority of Republicans in
the House felt 'They're not going to
be able to do anything without us.'
They used the leverage they had to
push through something that would
not have had a chance of passing if
it was initiated in the normal man
ner."

"It's pretty clear this is not a
long-term solution," Wright re
sponded when asked about the
scope of the bill. "The main draw
back is that they're calling for pret
ty dramatic spending cuts in the
coming year ... This seems not to
be good public policy in light of the
current economic situation. Ulti
mately, I feel confident that the
economy will recover. It will be a
long, slow recovery and I don't
think the implications of this bud
get are going to help that."
Taylor agreed that the plan was
imperfect.

"I would have preferred that it
was laid out a little more carefully
without the two steps," he said.
"Other than that, it's really what I
hoped would happen. It's not a
complete solution it's a step to
ward a long-term solution. There's
more that needs to be done, like
taking additional actions to reduce
the deficit and growth of the debt."

Financial Aid Ramifications

Despite the cuts, the bill in
creased funding for Pell Grants by
$l7 billion and protected the schol
arships from cuts until 2013. Pell
Grants have provided need-based
grants to low-income undergradu
ates and some graduate students
since 1995.

Under the Budget Control Act,
graduate and professional school
students will no longer receive fed
erally subsidized student loans. The
potential effect these cuts might
have on the Farm remains to be
seen.

"The loss of the interest subsi
dies for graduate and professional
students will be effective for the
2012-2013 school year, so we still
have time to consider alternatives,"
wrote Director of Financial Aid
Karen Cooper in an email to The
Daily. "It's too early to say how we
might respond. Seventeen percent
of Stanford undergraduates were
Pell Grant recipients last year."

U.S. Credit Ratings
On Aug. 5, S&P downgraded
the U.S. credit rating from 'AAA'
to 'AA+.' Neither Moody's nor
Fitch, which both also offer credit
ratings, have downgraded the U.S.
from its Triple-A status. Moody's
warned it may change the rating in
the future, and Fitch is completing a
review of its U.S. credit rating this
month.

S&P explained the rationale be
hind its downgrade in a report.
"The downgrade reflects our
opinion that the fiscal consolida
tion plan that Congress ... recently
agreed to falls short of what...

would be necessary to stabilize the
government's medium-term debt
dynamics," the report said.
Chad Stone, chief economist at
the Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities in Washington, D.C. does
not believe that the Budget Control
Act influenced S&P's rating
change.
"I just don't see the S&P down
grade as being something that can
move markets," Stone said.
"Moody's made a completely dif
ferent call."

Economic Turmoil
The flurry of economic activi
ty began Aug. 2 when President
Barack Obama signed the Bud
get Control Act of 2011 into law,
hours before the U.S. was expect
ed to default on its debt obliga

tions. The law immediately ex
tended the $14.3 trillion debt ceil
ing by $4OO billion and gave the
President the option of future ex
tensions, subject to a vote by
Congress. The debt ceiling could
be raised by as much as $2.4 tril
lion total.

In return for the debt ceiling
increase, the law mandated $917
billion worth of reductions in
government spending in two
parts over the next 10 years. $2l

billion of these cuts will occur
during the 2012 fiscal year and
the remainder will materialize
after.

The bill also created the Joint
Select Committee on Deficit Re
duction to suggest $1.5 trillion in
spending cuts over the next 10
years. The committee of six De
mocrats and six Republicans,
equally split between the House
and the Senate, must make recom
mendations by Nov. 23.
If Congress does not approve at
least $1.2 trillion in cuts by Dec. 23,
reductions will automatically come
from mandatory and discretionary
funds in both defense and domestic
accounts. Debate over addressing
the deficit whether and by how
much to raise revenue through in
creasing taxes, and whether to re
duce spending and by how much
accounted for Congress' inability to
produce legislation until the last
moment.

Stanford Reflections

Stanford economic experts have
expressed differing views on the
Budget Control Act.
"There were differences of opin
ion about whether spending limits
should be associated with the debt
limit increase," said economics pro
fessor John Taylor Ph.D. '73. "The
deliberation was over how to add
cuts, which the Speaker said was
necessary. The debate was also
over whether taxes increased

Republicans did not want to have
that."

"The bill was definitely a com
promise," Taylor said. "It included
things that Republicans wanted
like spending reductions but not
as much as they would have liked."
Economics professor Gavin
Wright believes that the Republi
cans have gained significantly from
the act.

"The Republican party decided
to use this as a sticking point for
some of their agenda," Wright said.
"The majority of Republicans in
the House felt 'They're not going to
be able to do anything without us.'
They used the leverage they had to
push through something that would
not have had a chance of passing if
it was initiated in the normal man
ner."

"It's pretty clear this is not a
long-term solution," Wright re
sponded when asked about the
scope of the bill. "The main draw
back is that they're calling for pret
ty dramatic spending cuts in the
coming year ... This seems not to
be good public policy in light of the
current economic situation. Ulti
mately, I feel confident that the
economy will recover. It will be a
long, slow recovery and I don't
think the implications of this bud
get are going to help that."
Taylor agreed that the plan was
imperfect.

"I would have preferred that it
was laid out a little more carefully
without the two steps," he said.
"Other than that, it's really what I
hoped would happen. It's not a
complete solution it's a step to
ward a long-term solution. There's
more that needs to be done, like
taking additional actions to reduce
the deficit and growth of the debt."

Financial Aid Ramifications

Despite the cuts, the bill in
creased funding for Pell Grants by
$l7 billion and protected the schol
arships from cuts until 2013. Pell
Grants have provided need-based
grants to low-income undergradu
ates and some graduate students
since 1995.

Under the Budget Control Act,
graduate and professional school
students will no longer receive fed
erally subsidized student loans. The
potential effect these cuts might
have on the Farm remains to be
seen.

"The loss of the interest subsi
dies for graduate and professional
students will be effective for the
2012-2013 school year, so we still
have time to consider alternatives,"
wrote Director of Financial Aid
Karen Cooper in an email to The
Daily. "It's too early to say how we
might respond. Seventeen percent
of Stanford undergraduates were
Pell Grant recipients last year."

U.S. Credit Ratings
On Aug. 5, S&P downgraded
the U.S. credit rating from 'AAA'
to 'AA+.' Neither Moody's nor
Fitch, which both also offer credit
ratings, have downgraded the U.S.
from its Triple-A status. Moody's
warned it may change the rating in
the future, and Fitch is completing a
review of its U.S. credit rating this
month.

S&P explained the rationale be
hind its downgrade in a report.
"The downgrade reflects our
opinion that the fiscal consolida
tion plan that Congress ... recently
agreed to falls short of what...

would be necessary to stabilize the
government's medium-term debt
dynamics," the report said.
Chad Stone, chief economist at
the Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities in Washington, D.C. does
not believe that the Budget Control
Act influenced S&P's rating
change.
"I just don't see the S&P down
grade as being something that can
move markets," Stone said.
"Moody's made a completely dif
ferent call."

Congress's Aug. 2 approval of
a last-minute debt ceiling in
crease marked the beginning of
at least a week of instability in the
U.S. economy, which included
Standard & Poor's (S&P) down
grading the country's credit rat
ing, volatility in the stock markets
and the Federal Reserve Bank's
announcement that it will main
tain low federal interest rates.

American economists, includ
ing those at Stanford, have a vari
ety of theories as to how the situ
ation came to be, as well as how it
will play out.
