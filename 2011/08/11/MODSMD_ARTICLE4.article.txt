## Stanford opens 12th 'headache clinic' in U.S. 
### MICHAEL TUSCHMAN INTERN 
The Stanford Neuroscience Clinic re
cently opened a headache clinic dedicated to
researching and treating common causes of
headaches and migraines.
According to its website, the clinic ad
dresses "proper diagnosis and a comprehen
sive treatment plan" for headache sufferers.
It tackles medical issues and also approach
es headache management through treat
ments including massage, cranio-sacral
work, stress management, biofeedback,
yoga and nutritional counseling.
There are only 12 headache pro
grams in the United States, but clin
ic director and clinical professor of
neurology Robert Cowan said the
field is growing.
"We're gaining recognition," he
said. "It's really starting to get more
press, and major medical institutions
are now recognizing it, even though
there are a large population not get
ting adequate headache care."
Cowan said he is excited to be pi
oneering the program at Stanford,
having dedicated his career to the
study of headaches and migraines.
"I was running the program at
USC until 2000, and I've been work
ing for a private foundation since
then which provided headache care
regardless of the ability to pay," he
said. "I came here because I missed
being in an academic environment."

Stanford is not the first universi
ty to support a headache clinic. A
similar facility currently operates at
UC-San Francisco.

The funding for the clinic comes
from patient revenues, donors, the
University and the medical center.
Currently, the clinic is staffed by
Cowan and clinical instructor in
anesthesia Meredith Barad, though
Cowan hopes the staff will continue
to grow.

"I feel like we already have a

great system and great facilities even
though there are just two physi
cians," Barad said.
"We're in the process of devel
oping a fellowship program, so we'll
be asking a fellow to join us in the
near future," he said.

While around 20 patients have
received treatment over the past
week, Cowan said the clinic is not
yet in full operation.
"We're still getting all our sys

tems going and simultaneously see
ing patients," he said. "We have to
create a headache-friendly environ
ment. No loud sounds and things
like that."

While the clinic requires patients
to have a primary care doctor, a re
ferral is not necessary to seek con
sultation and treatment.

"We've got a fairly elaborate
pre-visit form," Cowan explained.
"We take about 15 pages to get a re

ally detailed headache history.
Soon, we'll have that as an interac
tive website to create a much more
dynamic history form."

"I would like to see the clinic
grow to be the premier headache re
source on the West Coast," Barad
said. "We could really serve as an in
ternationally renowned clinic."
