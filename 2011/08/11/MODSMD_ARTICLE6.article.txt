## Psych study finds noun use boosts voter turnout 
### JOSH HOYT 
A recent study by the Stanford Psychology
Department has shown that voter turnout can
be significantly increased in state and national
elections by using nouns instead of verbs
that is, asking people if they are "voters" in
stead of asking them "to vote."
The study was published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences in July. It
involved three experiments over two elections,
California ballots in the 2008 Presidential elec
tion and the 2009 New Jersey gubernatorial
election.

Researchers gave surveys to potential vot
ers. One group was asked, "How important is
it to you to vote in the upcoming election?";
the other asked, "How important is it to you to
be a voter?"

"When you talk about 'being a voter,' it
frames that behavior as something that is going
to ... signal the kind of person you are," said
Christopher Bryan, lead author of the study
and post-doctoral scholar in psychology. "Be
cause people think that it is generally good to
be the kind of person who votes, they were sig
nificantly more likely to show up at the polls
the next day."

The first and second experiments took
place in California and examined the ability of
a noun to improve voter registration and par
ticipation, respectively. The third, which oc
curred in New Jersey, found that 10.9 percent
more people voted in the group asked about
"being a voter."

The study concluded that "the effects in ex
periments two and three are among the largest
experimental effects ever observed on objec
tively measured voter turnout."
The study stems from previous research
done by Bryan and assistant professor of psy-
chology Greg Walton. Walton had
previously done research on the
topic of how noun and verb phras
ing impacts perception of one's
likes and dislikes.

"We asked people to write 'I am
a baseball fan' versus, 'I like base
ball a lot,"' Walton said. "People
actually inferred that they them
selves like baseball or chocolate or
Coke ... more when they had de
scribed it using these noun phras
es."

The research has sparked fur
ther experiments on the effects of
this language on children, which
are already underway.
