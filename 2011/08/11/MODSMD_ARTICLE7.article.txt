## Stanford Jazz Workshop holds 40th season 
### HAELIN CHO INTERN 
This summer marked the Stanford Jazz Work
shop's 40th season and included 36 different con
certs as well as the annual jazz educational
camps.
Current executive and artistic director Jim
Nadel '72, also a lecturer in music, founded the
Workshop after graduating from Stanford. Ac
cording to Nadel, the series of festivals and edu
cational programs started out as a "jam session"
on Mondays and an additional meeting on Tues
days for jazz musicians.
Since then, Nadel said the organization has
greatly expanded but carries on the purpose of
the jam sessions: the exchange of ideas and tech
niques in jazz.
Marketing director Ernie Rideout said that
most of the concerts this season attracted diverse
audiences.
"Many of our concerts this year have been
close to selling out," Rideout said.
Over the last 40 seasons, the workshop has ex

perienced various changes. Aside from increas
ing the number of events, Rideout said the scope
of the music at the festival has also broadened.

"We are branching into other kinds of music
that incorporate improvised music, world music,
for example, Brazilian music, Colombian music,
Cuban music," he said.

In addition to the festivals, the workshop of
fers several jazz educational programs. Accord
ing to its website, the organization puts on
evening summer classes, a jazz camp for children
as well as a jazz residency for adults.
Rideout added that while the teachers perform
in concerts, students in the programs have the op
portunity to enjoy the festivals, giving them a kind
of "jazz immersion."

"You come here [to the camps] it's all jazz,
all day, from nine in the morning until midnight
every night," he said.

Despite the changes in the Workshop, Rideout
said that the jazz camps maintain a few traditions
such as the James Brown Memorial Ice Cream So-
