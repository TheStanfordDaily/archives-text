## MSE lab develops transparent battery 
### ABHA SHARMA INTERN 
A year of work by a materials science and engi
neering team has recently culminated in the devel
opment of a transparent lithium-ion battery, ac
cording to a paper recently published in the Pro
ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The finished product is not much more expen
sive than the widely available traditional lithium
ion battery, as the materials used to manufacture it
are not expensive. The transparent battery is also
rechargeable similar to a normal lithium-ion

battery because it uses the same chemistry.
The battery is comprised of electrodes arranged
in a mesh-like grid, with each line in the grid ap
proximately 35 microns wide. This framework
seems transparent to the naked human eye, be
cause if something is smaller than 50 microns, it ap
pears transparent.

Yuan Yang, a graduate student in materials sci
ence and engineering, did most of the experimental
work involved with inventing the battery and con
tributed to the initial design of the concept.

The transparent battery developed by a
materials science and engineering lab at a
similar cost to typical batteries could potentially
be used in a transparent phone.
