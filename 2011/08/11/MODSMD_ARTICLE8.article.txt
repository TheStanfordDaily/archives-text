## MSE lab develops transparent battery 
### ABHA SHARMA INTERN 
A year of work by a materials science and engi
neering team has recently culminated in the devel
opment of a transparent lithium-ion battery, ac
cording to a paper recently published in the Pro
ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The finished product is not much more expen
sive than the widely available traditional lithium
ion battery, as the materials used to manufacture it
are not expensive. The transparent battery is also
rechargeable similar to a normal lithium-ion

battery because it uses the same chemistry.
The battery is comprised of electrodes arranged
in a mesh-like grid, with each line in the grid ap
proximately 35 microns wide. This framework
seems transparent to the naked human eye, be
cause if something is smaller than 50 microns, it ap
pears transparent.

Yuan Yang, a graduate student in materials sci
ence and engineering, did most of the experimental
work involved with inventing the battery and con
tributed to the initial design of the concept.

The transparent battery developed by a
materials science and engineering lab at a
similar cost to typical batteries could potentially
be used in a transparent phone.
"It is like a miniaturized screen
window; when the line is thin
enough, people's eyes cannot dis
tinguish it from the background, so
it is transparent," Yang said.

The electrodes themselves are
made up of metal oxides, and the
substrate is a transparent polymer
called polydimethylsiloxane, more
commonly referred to as "PDMS."
"The transparency could vary
by changing width of lines in the
grid," Yang said. "For example,
it's easy to vary the transparency

from 40 percent to 90 percent."
The amount of energy that the
battery stores can also be altered.
The transparent battery currently
holds less energy than a traditional
battery, but increasing its thick
ness changes that.
"The energy stored in a battery
with 70 percent transparency is 30
percent of a traditional battery,"
he said. "However, there are sev
eral ways to increase it first, by
increasing the thickness of the bat
tery, which will not decrease the
transparency at the same time.
Second, with the development of
new high-energy materials for bat
teries, the energy stored could be
close to state-of-the-art batteries."
Transparent batteries also

serve a practical purpose: they
allow examination of inner elec
tronic workings for further re
search.
Yi Cui, associate professor of
materials science and engineering,
is the leading scientist on the team.
Cui thinks that a transparent bat
tery is the first step toward many
other transparent objects, such as
transparent cell phones, laptops
and watches. He personally would
like to see a transparent iPhone.
"It is exciting to lead my whole
research group and come up inno
vative ideas in addressing different
needs to society," Cui said.
