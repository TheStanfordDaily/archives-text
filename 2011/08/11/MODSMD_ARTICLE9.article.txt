## Study identifies genes involved in Parkinson's 
### HARINI JAGANATHAN INTERN 
Researchers from the Stanford School
of Medicine have unraveled the mito
chondrial mechanisms involved in
Parkinson's disease as part of a study that
will be published Aug. 15 in Human Mol
ecular Genetics.
Parkinson's is a movement disorder
and a neurodegenerative disease that re
sults from the loss of structure and func
tion of the neurons. Associate professor
of pathology Bingwei Lu, a co-author of
the study, said that previous research
found a link between mitochondrial dy
namics and the disease.

He joined mammalian neurobiologist
Wendou Yu, a postdoctoral scholar in
pathology, to complete the study, which
examined two genes that are linked to
controlling mitochondrial function,
PINKI/Parkin.

"This dynamic morphology change is
important for mitochondrial function,"
Lu said. "We call morphology change fis
sion and fusion, meaning the mitochon
dria can be made to produce to smaller
units or can fuse to make longer units. We
found that PINKI/Parkin specifically af
fects this mitochondrial fission or fusion
process."
"This study showed that
PINKI/Parkin, the Parkinson's-disease
causing genes, play an evolutionarily con
served role in regulating mitochondrial
morphology through this fission/fusions
process," he added.
In previous work with fruit flies, Lu
found that PINKI/Parkin influences mi
tochondrial dynamics. He wanted to pur
sue this study in order to see if what he
found in his fruit fly research could be ap
plied to other organisms.
" [Fruit flies] are a kind of lower organ
ism, but it's a very powerful genetic sys
tem, so we obtained a lot of information
about how PINKI/Parkin worked," he
said.

Previous research with mammalian
cells gave inconclusive results, so Lu set
out to resolve some of the controversy.
"My interest is to see whether what we
found in fruit flies is relevant in mammals
and eventually relevant in human pa
tients," he said.
PINKI/Pathway and their pathways
were examined in cultures of rodent hip
pocampal and dopaminergic neurons. A
loss of dopaminergic neurons is specifically
linked to Parkinson's. Previous studies
