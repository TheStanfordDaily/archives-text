Are you an artist, writer, designer, or
an all-around team player?
We need you for the Graphic Novel course in Fall 2011 -2012!
Admission to this course is by application only. We will
collaboratively write, design, and illustrate a 200+ page graphic
novel. This will be an intense, challenging, rewarding class, but
with a heavy workload.
To apply, include on one side of a sheet of paper: your name,
email, major, minor, graduating year, any creative writing, art, or
design classes you've taken, with the instructor's name. And two
paragraphs: one that briefly describes your interest in the
course, and the second, of no more than three sentences, that is
a pitch for a possible story based in nonfiction (a sample of the
kind of ideas you'd bring to brainstorming sessions over the
first couple of weeks of class).
On the other side of the paper: Anything. Text, graphics,
illustrations, etc. Communicate your skills, experience, and
enthusiasm.
Deadline: September 22 (email applications not accepted)
