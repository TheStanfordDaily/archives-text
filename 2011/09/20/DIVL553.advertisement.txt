The study of Classics is an exciting, intensely active, interdisciplinary subject that covers more than 3,000
years of human history and touches on the ways that abiding issues (justice, death, human relations, the
divine) have been articulated in every era. Classics is relevant to virtually every other subject offered at
Stanford, from Law and Medicine to Philosophy and Comparative Literature, from the History of Science
to Linguistics. It is also, in itself, a source of intellectual challenge and joy. If you want a firm grasp of
any of these fields, or a thorough grounding in fundamental traditions, begin by exploring Classics.
