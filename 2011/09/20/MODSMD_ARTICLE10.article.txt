## Stanford partners with Nev. neurosurgery center 
### JOSHUA HOYT 
Stanford Hospital and St. Rose Domini
can Hospitals of Nevada are partnering to
expand the St. Rose Center for Neuro
surgery, the institutions recently an
nounced. This move marks the first time
Stanford Hospital & Clinics (SHC) will col
laborate with an out-of-state facility.
Rod Davis, president and CEO of St.
Rose, said he sees clear advantages for his
institution to partner with Stanford Hospi
tal, which was ranked the 17th best overall
hospital and 20th best neurosurgery center
in the nation by U.S. News & World Report
this year.
The expansion will include the construc
tion of a new building near St. Rose's Siena
campus in Henderson, Nev.
"Number one, the surgeons here will
have access to consultation with faculty at
Stanford, access to conferences, access to
educational opportunities and will work in
collaboration with them in establishing best
clinical practices," Davis said.
"The second advantage is that occasion
ally there are cases, very rare cases, that we

don't have the ability to do locally, and this
will enable people to access those services at
Stanford Hospital & Clinics."
Both Davis and Gary Steinberg, chair of
Stanford neurosurgery, emphasized that
only specialized cases beyond the resources
of St. Rose will be referred to Stanford.
"There may be very rare cases that you
don't see in a relatively small population like
southern Nevada," Davis said. "You may see
it in such few numbers that you don't devel
op a strong proficiency, or you may not have
the proper instrumentation or the appropri
ate equipment to take care of that rare case."
For most cases, however, Davis is confi
dent in the capabilities of his own neuro
surgery team.
"We have excellent neurosurgeons who
practice here at St. Rose," he said. "I think
it's a credit to them that they meet the cre
dentialing criteria that Stanford has, which
is very high."
A key to this partnership is Dr. Randal
Peoples, a neurosurgeon at St. Rose who will
be a member of the Stanford faculty in addi
tion to serving as the medical director of the
new clinic in Henderson. According to

Davis, Peoples had a strong prior profes
sional connection with the Stanford neuro
surgery department, but was ultimately cho
sen because of his professional capabilities
and credentials.
Steinberg emphasized the importance of
Peoples becoming a Stanford faculty mem
ber.
"It makes collaboration much easier,"
Steinberg said. "We pay his salary, so he is
definitely a part of the team."
The collaboration between the two hos
pitals extends beyond Peoples' dual role,
however, and could evolve in the coming
years.
"This is the beginning of what we belie ve
is going to become a much more compre
hensive relationship between SHC and St.
Rose hospital in Nevada," Steinberg said.
"We are hoping to expand our work togeth
er, for instance, next into transplantation
services."
Both Davis and Steinberg said they see
collaboration as a growing, positive trend in
health care. The outcome, they argue, is
greater efficiency and knowledge.
According to Steinberg, Stanford will get

referrals of complicated, possibly academi
cally interesting cases. The new clinic will
also permit Stanford to put academic ad
vancements into practice in communities.
"The delivery of certain kinds of care,
particularly complex kinds of specialties
like neurosurgery, has become regionalized
to academic centers in many cases," Stein
berg noted. "The community cannot always
take advantage of that knowledge, and Stan
ford feels very strongly that we have a re
sponsibility to provide the best quality
healthcare to the community."
The results of better communication be
tween the hospitals and greater access to
specialized knowledge may not show up
simply as better outcomes, but also as more
efficient outcomes.
"The purpose [of collaboration] is to in
tegrate data so you can collect data and an
alyze it, and to align incentives so you are all
working together to raise the overall quali
ty," Davis said. "If we all pull together in the
same direction we have the opportunity to re
duce costs in the health delivery system."
