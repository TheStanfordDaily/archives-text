## ASSU Execs outline 'blueprint' plans 
### HENRY ZHU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Near the end of August, ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Den
nis 'l3 sent a blueprint containing
the student government's plans for
the upcoming academic year to sev
eral campus email lists.
According to Macgregor-Dennis,
the platform is "a comprehensive
look at what we felt students wanted
and an audacious attempt to look at
students' problems."
Macgregor-Dennis said the blue
print was drafted by the entire
ASSU Executive team. They sent it
out to campus list serves in an at
tempt to get feedback and have the
whole student body contribute to
the end result.
"We have a team of incredible
leaders in the Stanford community,"
he said. "Michael and I really saw
our role as empowering the team

and community around us and actu
alizing whatever they wanted to do."
The emphasis of the administra
tion is "total transparency," Macgre
gor-Dennis said.
"We're going to tell students
here's what we're going to do, here's
how we'll do it, get feedback and up
date them periodically. At the end of
the year, we'll tell them what worked
and what didn't," he added.
Dan Thompson 'l3, ASSU Co-
Chair of Entrepreneurship, echoed
Macgregor-Dennis' statement about
Exec's goal of improving trans
parency.
According to Thompson, the Di
vision of Internal Review, directed
by Andrew Aguilar 'l4, will publish
what has and what has not been ac
complished in all the ASSU cabinets.
The ASSU plans to use PBworks, a
commercial real-time collaborative
editing (RTCE) system, to set up a
computer database, which will list
every action item it tries to achieve,

internal deadlines and the individu
als assigned to the action item.
Thompson said the student body
will be able to access the system.
"Our number one belief is metric
based or data-based governance,"
Thompson said. "When you have a
blueprint with exact action items, the
student body will know if you suc
ceed or if you fail."
The ASSU has some concern
about inundating students with data,
according Thompson; however, the
ASSU sees greater concern with
opening access to all of its internal
documents, one alternative.
Macgregor-Dennis said the ASSU
is aware of criticism from students
about the number of positions asso
ciated with its Strategic Plan.
"We're all about action, and the re
sults will speak for themselves at the
end of the year," he said. "Anyone
who has a specific thing they would
like to change about Stanford
should join us and become an active
part of the ASSU."
Thompson said that while it some
times makes sense to apply technical
solutions to non-tech areas, he con
ceded that the entrepreneurship un
derlying Stanford 2.0 might indeed
be a little too tech-focused, but
would like to hear others' thoughts
about initiatives they would suggest.
"Everyone has his or her own
opinion," Thompson said. "We're
100 percent open to anything. For
example, in response to the criticism
that the blueprint email was too
long, Stewart created the position of
Director of Internal Review. The
ASSU values criticism more than
praise and will give people the re
sources to do things themselves and

carry out their ideas."
Macgregor-Dennis said Stanford
2.0 is eager to use social media and
technology to promote student gov
ernment initiatives.
For instance, Chair of Health and
Wellness Stephanie Liou 'l3 said she
hopes to launch a health Q&A web
site as well as a sleep-improving mo
bile application.
"It's tough because there are ap
proximately 7,000 undergrads, so it
is impossible to get a personal con
nection with each one," Thompson
said. "Cruz and Macgregor-Dennis
do their best trying to respond to the
huge number of emails they receive
every day. We just want to make it as
easy as possible for people to give
feedback and feel like part of the
community."
Cruz did not respond to The
Daily's request for comment in time
for publication.
