## Suites residents retain control over dining clubs Student supervision trumps SOS possibility 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Suites residents reached an
agreement with the University that
they will be allowed to manage their
own dining areas and chefs for the
upcoming academic year, ending a
months-long conflict between
Suites Dining, formally known as
the Governor's Corner Dining Soci
eties and Residential Education
(ResEd), according to Nate
Boswell, associate dean of Residen
tial Education, in an email to The
Daily.
Suites Dining will be the only stu
dent-run dining area on campus this
year, continuing a 25-year tradition
of autonomous management.
Last spring. Suites students de
bated with ResEd, which had up
graded the bid process require
ments for dining vendors.
"During spring quarter, Residen
tial Education remained uncertain
whether the dining societies would
be able to [meet the requirements],
and thus it was necessary to explore
possible alternatives," Boswell said.
One of the alternatives that
ResEd proposed was to replace
Suites' student-run management
with the outside contractor Student
Organized Services (SOS), which
manages Row house chefs. Suites
students objected, pointing out that
Nick Peters, chief executive of SOS,
is the brother-in-law and former em
ployer of ResEd assistant director
Zac Sargeant. Although ResEd re
peatedly denied any conflict of in

terest, Suites residents continued to
contest this claim.
In addition. Suites chefs were
vocal about their concerns about
the proposed, new system.
"[Middle Earth chef] Steven
Roland was concerned," said Suites
CFO Morgan Priestly 'l2. "He just
wanted the job the way it was. If our
chefs had chosen to stay under SOS,
they'd have been paid significantly
less. We were concerned about the
quality of the whole experience."
Over the summer, however,
Suites CEO J.T. Sullivan 'll and
Priestly engaged in extensive talks
with ResEd to find ways they could
meet the University's stricter re
quirements for financial disclosure
and liability.
"For a long time, there were a
dozen students in charge of over a
million dollars," Priestly said.
"ResEd was concerned that there
was a potential for bad things to
happen."
The two parties agreed that
Suites dining could maintain its au
tonomy in hiring and managing
their chefs, while partnering more
closely with ResEd on financial as
pects.
"Once a lot of things were out
and on the table, the relationship
definitely got better," Priestly said.
ResEd also indicated satisfaction
with the talks' outcome.
"[Suites'] leadership team has
worked diligently over the course of
the summer to meet all relevant, up
graded University requirements,"
Boswell said. "Residential Educa
tion appreciates the work that has
been done to date and looks for
ward to working with the dining so
cieties to strengthen the program
and identify future opportunities."
While praising ResEd for its ne
gotiations with Suites students, Sul
livan also said that there were ways
in which ResEd could continue to
improve its relationship with stu
dent groups.
"I believe that the early tension
between ResEd and Suites mostly
came about from a series of miscom
munication and a misunderstanding
of what the other party was hoping
to achieve in the arrangement," he
said. "This cooperative atmosphere
can only be upheld by continued
open communication."
Nevertheless, Suites students are
celebrating their victory in main
taining autonomy. "It is im
portant to maintain the student-run
aspect of Suites to give present and
future students the opportunity for
real job and managerial experiences
that might not be provided to them,"
Sullivan said. "Suites is also well
known around campus as having
some of the best food around ... I
believe that it is the student manage
ment and the input that they pro
vide that has brought about this rep
utation of excellence,"
