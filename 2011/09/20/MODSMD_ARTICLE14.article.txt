## EDITORIAL Starting the Stanford year off right 
### 
Each September, the begin
ning of New Student Orien
tation (NSO) marks the
dawn of a new school year at Stan
ford, and with it a new stage in the
lives of first-year students. Though
NSO is a unique opportunity for in
coming students to explore what
Stanford has to offer and make so
cial connections without the pres
sure of coursework, the pace and
structure of the week can prove ex
hausting for some. Students must
juggle necessary tasks such as mov
ing in, taking placement tests and
purchasing bicycles with the myriad
activities that NSO has to offer.
With this in mind, we offer the Class
of 2015 some humble advice for
navigating the weeks ahead.
As a whole, NSO is a great repre
sentation of Stanford. It may seem a
bit overwhelming and sometimes
even over-the-top (much like Stan
ford), but the organizers take great
pride in listening to feedback so
each year's NSO is different and
better than those that preceded it.
Some things, of course, stay the
same each year. You are at a univer
sity that can ask renowned authors
to discuss their work for students
who have not even begun taking
classes; you are also at a university
that values more intimate in-house
discussions of those same books.
Whether you liked the three books
or not whether or not you even
read them attend the three
books event and discussion and re
alize what they represent about the
amazing education you will receive
here. Another favorite, FACES,
highlights student stories and per
formances that will broaden your

understanding of the Stanford com
munity. As you listen to them, real
ize that what you are witnessing is at
best a tiny percentage of the diver
sity that Stanford represents. This is
a place for everyone, regardless of
background.
The rest of the schedule may
seem impossibly full of activities,
but NSO is ultimately what you
make of it. Take the time to reach
out to fellow classmates. They are
all excited but nervous and proba
bly a little self-conscious, just like
you. Meet them.Talk to them. Bond
with them over NSO activities, over
getting lost, over meeting a class
mate you last saw in fourth grade,
over your eerily similar high school
backgrounds or your vastly differ
ent ones.
New Student Orientation is, of
course, only the beginning of what
will hopefully be a fruitful under
graduate experience. Throughout
the chants, speeches, trips and semi
nars, students should remember
that NSO exists for their benefit
there is no point in being stressed
before classes even begin. Similarly,
students should also be wary of
overburdening themselves with
coursework during their first quar
ter, which can make it difficult to
identify activities outside the class
room that are often as rewarding as
those within. There will be plenty of
time in the months and years ahead
for hard work and long hours. For
now, the focus is on enjoying your
self and exploring as you work to
wards becoming a happy, flourish
ing member of the Stanford com
munity. On behalf of The Stanford
Daily Editorial Board, welcome.
