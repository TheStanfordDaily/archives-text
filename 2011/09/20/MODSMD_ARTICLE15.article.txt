# SHANE'S WORLD
## This is paradise. Get lost. 
### Shane Savitsky 
So you made it to Stanford,
huh? Eighteen long years of
work have finally culminated
in your arrival at this little slice of
heaven. I was in your shoes just
three years ago, but it seems like a
lifetime since then.
I'm not going to lie I'm pretty
jealous. You're about to be intro
duced to the wonderful world of
IHUM (i.e., you can sleep in). All
campus frat parties will actually
seem like a ton of fun. You're get
ting here when our football team is
actually good. You get to have a
general lack of direction. This is
probably going to be the first time
in your life when you literally have
no idea what to do or even what
you really should be doing. Just go
with it. Embrace it. There's nothing
like it. When you're a senior like me
who needs to make sure to finish up
all of your major's requirements
while still prepping for the LSAT,
you'll long for freshman year.
The people that Stanford attracts
are obviously among the most in
telligent people in the world, but I'd
like to think that most of us know
how to have fun, too. That's why
you're here and not at Harvard,
MIT or Caltech. I'm not telling you
to turn off your intelligence but
rather to merge your intelligence
with fun. If you're anything like me,
you probably felt high school was
something like a chore —just a
stepping stone to your eventual
goal. Well, look, you've reached
that goal now. You no longer have
counselors telling you which classes
to take or the ever-present specter
of AP classes lurking around the
corner. Have fun. Explore. You did
n't come to a world-class university
to waste that opportunity. Sure,
take Math 51 because it's a neces
sary prerequisite for so many of
your classes, but take something
completely off the wall, too. Take a
film studies or music class solely be
cause it interests you. Or have you
always wanted to learn how to golf?
There are lessons available right

here. Hell, we even have a wine
tasting class. How awesome is that?
You got accepted to Stanford
solely because you're (assumedly)
a really intelligent, well-rounded
and pretty cool person. (You're
going to be hearing that a lot over
the next week, so I don't want to be
the one to boost your ego even fur
ther.) But here's my point: now that
you're here, don't lose that sense of
exploration that ostensibly got you
here in the first place. Try every
thing and regret nothing. You have
the flexibility, so take advantage of
it.

All of this talk of well-rounded
ness leads me to an important ex
ample to leave you with: in my per
sonal pantheon of excellent films,
Wes Anderson-directed movies
hold a very esteemed position
among my favorites. And in Ander
son's classic film "Rushmore," the
main character is a teenager named
Max Fischer. Max might be some
thing of a budding sociopath, but he
is also involved in countless ex
tracurricular activities at his private
high school, Rushmore. From the
"Yankee Racers" to the fencing
club to the Rushmore Beekeepers,
Max does it all. He's a little obses
sive compulsive, slightly unstable, a
bit over the top and has way too
many things on his plate to focus on
schoolwork. And that is something
all of us at Stanford can agree upon.
I'm talking to the person out there
among the new admits who has
climbed Mount Everest or whose
research might unlock the cure for
cancer someday. But mainly, I'm
talking to you the seemingly av
erage new Stanford student just

trying to find your way. Get lost in
this place. Never turn down a new
opportunity because it seems too
hard or too strange. Max Fischer

wouldn't do that, and you shouldn't
either.
Just remember: all of us here at
Stanford have just a little bit of
Max Fischer in us otherwise, we
wouldn't be here.
