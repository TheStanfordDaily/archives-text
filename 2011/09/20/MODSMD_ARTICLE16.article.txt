# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Believe, carefully 
### Miles Unterreiner 
It has become traditional, for bet
ter or worse, for Daily columnists
to offer incoming freshmen a
small piece of advice in each year's
Orientation Issue. Here's mine, for
what it's worth: the second-biggest
mistake you could make during
NSO would be to believe too much
of what they're going to tell you
about yourself. And the biggest
would be to believe too little of it.
A generally very wise former
columnist for this paper once wrote
that if NSO is about one thing, it's
about hearing speeches, most of
them self-congratulatory. He was
wrong. It is about very much more
than that. Years from now, you'll re
member your first week on the Farm
in bits and pieces, fragmented flashes
of memory that come and go in no
particular order: the hesitant look
breaking into a quick grin on your
roommate's face as she sees you for
the first time; your dorm flag flutter
ing, etched against the dark sky
above the main quad; strolling under
golden sandstone arches with soon
to-be-lifelong friends. It is about
these things, and as you'll soon find
out, a good deal more.
But NSO is also about hearing
speeches. And you will hear a lot of
them mostly from a bewildering
array of Very Important People you
may never see again, and mostly
about how special, talented and dif
ferent you all are.
The soaring oratory will be laced
with numbers, and the numbers, like
you, get better every year. You'll
hear about a new all-time-lowest ac
ceptance rate, a new all-time highest
SAT average and maybe even an all
time-most-impressive Number-of-
Orphans-Saved-Per-Incoming-
Freshman Quotient. You might hear
about this year's number of Stanford

Olympians, or research articles pub
lished in major scientific journals, or
something off-the-wall but still pret
ty intimidating, like the person who
placed in the top 10 at the Dance
Dance Revolution World Champi
onships my freshman year. And
bound up with this litany of achieve
ments and triumphs will be an over
arching message of superiority, vic
tory and success: you're the best of
the best, and this is your reward.
Imbibe this encomium of your
selves too deeply, and you begin to
become the people who are probably
part of the reason you eschewed New
Haven, Princeton and Cambridge in
favor of Palo Alto. But cease to be
lieve that Stanford was right about
you, and you run the risk of drowning
in the tremendous pool of talent this
university has drawn in from around
the globe. The former is bad, and oth
ers will dislike you; the latter is much
worse, and you'll begin to dislike
yourself.
At Stanford, arrogance flows from
constantly thinking about who we
used to be and trying not to forget it.
You're here, and that probably means
you used to be the best at something,
or many things, or even everything,
depending on where you came from.
You'll hear a lot about that this week.
Leave that achievement-defined
sense of self behind, if you can, with
out forgetting it; say goodbye but not
forever; let it go but always remember
like an old friend from home that
you still call on the phone when the
going gets tough.
Only one person can be top of the
class at Stanford, and the odds are a
thousand to one it won't be you.
Deny that reality, and you lose the
chance to learn a humility you never
used to need; fear it, and you lose the
opportunity to sharpen your mind

against some of the world's finest;
embrace it, and thrive like you can
nowhere else on Earth.
One of the brightest people at
this school once told me that some
time during his or her four years
here, every single Stanford student
will experience something they
choose to define as failure. The
columnist I quoted earlier put it
more bluntly: "Failure is not just an
option; it's inevitable." My first fail
ure of many came early, spectacular
ly and quite literally, in my first Econ
1A midterm fall quarter of freshman
year. Some people meet failure in
IHUM; for others, it pops up uninvit
ed in Chem 33; for some, the angel of
failure visits outside the classroom,
in a relationship, a sport or a hobby.
So when failure arrives and it
will use the words you'll hear this
week to ease the sting of defeat. Re
member that anywhere else, you'd
stand out; that anywhere else, you'd
have the top score or the fastest time,
the most eloquent speech or the
keenest wit. Remember how you felt
this week, with the world open be
fore your feet and words of encour
agement and praise ringing in your
ears. Remember that the speech
givers were right.
And when victory comes and
it will temper your triumph by
forgetting all of that.

Miles will be writing primarily about
ethics, politics, economics and interna
tional affairs this volume, and he'd
love to hear from you. Feel free to

them self-congratulatory. He was
wrong. It is about very much more
than that. Years from now, you'll re
member your first week on the Farm
in bits and pieces, fragmented flashes
of memory that come and go in no
particular order: the hesitant look
breaking into a quick grin on your
roommate's face as she sees you for
the first time; your dorm flag flutter
ing, etched against the dark sky
above the main quad; strolling under
golden sandstone arches with soon
to-be-lifelong friends. It is about
these things, and as you'll soon find
out, a good deal more.
But NSO is also about hearing
speeches. And you will hear a lot of
them mostly from a bewildering
array of Very Important People you
may never see again, and mostly
about how special, talented and dif
ferent you all are.
The soaring oratory will be laced
with numbers, and the numbers, like
you, get better every year. You'll
hear about a new all-time-lowest ac
ceptance rate, a new all-time highest
SAT average and maybe even an all
time-most-impressive Number-of-
Orphans-Saved-Per-Incoming-
Freshman Quotient. You might hear
about this year's number of Stanford

Olympians, or research articles pub
lished in major scientific journals, or
something off-the-wall but still pret
ty intimidating, like the person who
placed in the top 10 at the Dance
Dance Revolution World Champi
onships my freshman year. And
bound up with this litany of achieve
ments and triumphs will be an over
arching message of superiority, vic
tory and success: you're the best of
the best, and this is your reward.
Imbibe this encomium of your
selves too deeply, and you begin to
become the people who are probably
part of the reason you eschewed New
Haven, Princeton and Cambridge in
favor of Palo Alto. But cease to be
lieve that Stanford was right about
you, and you run the risk of drowning
in the tremendous pool of talent this
university has drawn in from around
the globe. The former is bad, and oth
ers will dislike you; the latter is much
worse, and you'll begin to dislike
yourself.
At Stanford, arrogance flows from
constantly thinking about who we
used to be and trying not to forget it.
You're here, and that probably means
you used to be the best at something,
or many things, or even everything,
depending on where you came from.
You'll hear a lot about that this week.
Leave that achievement-defined
sense of self behind, if you can, with
out forgetting it; say goodbye but not
forever; let it go but always remember
like an old friend from home that
you still call on the phone when the
going gets tough.
Only one person can be top of the
class at Stanford, and the odds are a
thousand to one it won't be you.
Deny that reality, and you lose the
chance to learn a humility you never
used to need; fear it, and you lose the
opportunity to sharpen your mind

against some of the world's finest;
embrace it, and thrive like you can
nowhere else on Earth.
One of the brightest people at
this school once told me that some
time during his or her four years
here, every single Stanford student
will experience something they
choose to define as failure. The
columnist I quoted earlier put it
more bluntly: "Failure is not just an
option; it's inevitable." My first fail
ure of many came early, spectacular
ly and quite literally, in my first Econ
1A midterm fall quarter of freshman
year. Some people meet failure in
IHUM; for others, it pops up uninvit
ed in Chem 33; for some, the angel of
failure visits outside the classroom,
in a relationship, a sport or a hobby.
So when failure arrives and it
will use the words you'll hear this
week to ease the sting of defeat. Re
member that anywhere else, you'd
stand out; that anywhere else, you'd
have the top score or the fastest time,
the most eloquent speech or the
keenest wit. Remember how you felt
this week, with the world open be
fore your feet and words of encour
agement and praise ringing in your
ears. Remember that the speech
givers were right.
And when victory comes and
it will temper your triumph by
forgetting all of that.

Miles will be writing primarily about
ethics, politics, economics and interna
tional affairs this volume, and he'd
love to hear from you. Feel free to
