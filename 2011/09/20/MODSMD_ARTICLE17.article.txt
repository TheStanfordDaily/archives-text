# Dos AND Doo-Doos
## Adjusting to college life 
### Chase Ishii 
This is the closest thing to an
advice column you'll see in
The Daily. Unfortunately, it
is not written by a doctor or thera
pist but by a guy who applied for a
column mainly to see the word
"Doo-Doo" put into print on a
weekly basis ... so good luck with
that.
The DOs are things you should
do, and the DOO-DOOs are
things you should not do. It's not
rocket science just poop jokes.
Joining (or avoiding) clubs, teams,
etc.
You will have tons of people
badgering you about joining their
clubs or activities every time you
bike through White Plaza. No mat
ter how nice and enthusiastic they
are, you will feel like they're just
handing you a flyer saying, "Here,
you throw this away."
DO: Keep an open mind to new
experiences. Follow up with what
interests you, even if your parents
don't understand why they're pay
ing $50,000 a year for you to dig up
rocks ... or something else that's
weird and makes for a good exam
ple. Juggling?
DOO-DOO: Sign up your
roommate's email on every
spreadsheet and clipboard in sight.
While it will be objectively hilari
ous when he gets 50 emails a week
letting him know that the Stanford
Dance: Liquid Flow Performance
has been moved to Roble Gym, he
will not think so. If he's anything
like my freshman roommate, he

will retaliate by "accidentally"
drawing phallic symbols on you
any chance he gets. "Sure Chase,
I'll help you paint your chest for
the football game. Oh whoops, my
bad, the 'S' in 'Go Stanford!' acci
dentally looks like a penis."

Finding your way around campus
Stanford is huge, there's no doubt
about it. According to (my edit yes
terday of) Wikipedia, "Stanford
University is so big that the moment
Berkeley students set foot on cam
pus, they pee their pants out of
sheer intimidation." Irregardless
(which is not a real word), it can also
be difficult for new Stanford stu
dents, even with their indisputably
larger brain capacity.
DO: Download the campus map
app. Find your way to all of your
classrooms before the quarter
starts so you won't be late for class.
Let's face it: if you're going to be
more than 10 minutes late to
IHUM lecture, you're not going to
IHUM lecture. You're going back
to sleep.
DOO-DOO: Let your room
mate draw a map of the Stanford
campus on your chest in Sharpie.
Even if he claims you'll be able to
find your way around campus eas
ier or that you'll "look awesome,
like that guy from 'Prison Break',"
it is not true. First of all, it's
Sharpie: you won't look cool lift
ing up your shirt at the bookstore
to see how to get to the new Panda
Express.
Making friends

Friends are the building blocks
of life. Without friends, we would
n't have the TV show "Friends,"
and without the TV show
"Friends," I wouldn't have my go
to question to ask girls on awk
ward first dates. ("Do you see me
as more of a Joey or a Ross?" If she
says Joey, then I'm set. If she says
Ross, then we are definitely split
ting that dinner check.) College
can be the perfect setting to make
incredible life-long friends.
DO: Try your best to love every
one, no matter how different they
are. Just because you're a dorky,
white medical student doesn't
mean you can't be best friends
with a cocky, black surgeon and go
on crazy adventures with your
stuffed dog Rowdy ("Scrubs").
Just because you're a passive, dis
content, white-collar "everyman"
doesn't mean you can't befriend
an eccentric, self-assertive soap
maker and start secret under
ground fight clubs across the coun
try until you realize you're actual
ly the same person ("Fight Club").
-Just because you're a strong, yet
slightly neurotic woman doesn't
mean you can't hate an egotistical
jerk of a guy that actually turns out
to be a kind of sensitive man when

you get to know him, and by being
forced to interact together for
some slightly comical, yet pre
dictable reason, you two work
through your relational problems

and eventually fall in love.
("Every Sandra Bullock Movie
Ever").
DOO-DOO: Confuse movies
and television shows with real life.
People will think you're a freak
and not want to be friends with you.

Chase also has some great album rec
ommendations for you, so DO email
him at ninjaish@stanford.edu.
