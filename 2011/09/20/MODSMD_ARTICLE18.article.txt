# INTERMISSION
## THE 						FIVE PEOPLE YOU WILL MEET IN YOUR FRESHMAN DORM 
### â€” Caroline CASELLI contact Caroline: carolinecaselli@stanford. edu 
Over the next several weeks, Class
of 2015, you will be bombarded
by new names, faces and Face
book friends, all spanning a wide range
of ethnic, socioeconomic, geographic
and cultural backgrounds. But despite
this rich diversity, some like-minded
types seem to pop up all over campus
every year. With that in mind, here are
five people that you are certain to come
across in your freshman dorm.
The "I Love Stanford!" Kid
Not of the Asher Roth variety,
though that frat-party-loving "I Love
College!" kid can be found in large droves
as well. You may have picked some of
them out even before stepping foot on
campus this fall: that guy who insta
friended everyone from the class of 2015
Facebook group or that girl who organ
ized a group fountain-hopping excursion
during Admit Weekend. Thrilled by the
onslaught of icebreakers and summer
camp-esque dorm cheers, these exuber
ant Stanford-loving souls will be the
same students who go on to join Axe
Committee, run for Frosh Council and
participate constantly in IHUM section.
The Student-Athlete
Though none of you will have the
good fortune of claiming shared fresh
man-dorm residency with superhuman
Andrew Luck himself (shout out to

Roble 2008-09), your halls will undoubt
edly host a handful of student-athletes.
Recognizable by a seemingly endless sup
ply of red, black and white Nike apparel,
the student-athlete will be one of the few
regular attendees at breakfast outside of
finals week because, unlike the rest of us,
they have to be up at that ungodly hour
for practice. And you may as well leave
the "dumb jock" moniker behind with
your high school girlfriend that cross
country runner in the front row will
probably set the curve on the Econ 1A
midterm.
The Brilliant Slacker
This guy (or girl) tends to choose
sleeping until noon and smoking by Lake
Lag over attending lecture, yet he still
manages to make you feel intellectually
inferior every time you interact. In addi
tion to his plans to be pre-med or go for a
physics major (what's the rush to de
clare?), he can also play a classical instru
ment, effortlessly quote Dostoevsky and
ignite intense philosophical debates all
while regularly using an abundance of
recreational drugs and talking about that
time he got arrested in high school.
The Hallmate You Never Saw After NSO
Some Stanford students are less into
the whole dorm-camaraderie thing than
others, but this hallmate takes it to the
extreme either he is never around or

he never leaves. Whether it's spending
long hours in the library, becoming fully
engrossed in a student group, hanging
out with a newly discovered romantic in
terest across campus or only emerging to
grab a to-go tray from the dining hall,
this student could care less about hall
gatherings (let alone dorm socializing),
and those beyond your floor probably
won't know much about this mysterious
stranger come June.
The Well-Rounded Types
And then there are the rest of us
you know, the kids who got four-point
somethings, played a varsity sport or two,
boasted a smattering of leadership roles
and community service projects and
maybe won some neat awards here and
there. While some administrator in
evitably gives that NSO speech rattling
off fun tidbits about your new compatri
ots the one where you learn that one
of your classmates is a New York Times
bestselling author and another is devel
oping a cure for AIDS you may be
squirming in your seat wondering which
admission officer messed up letting you
join such elite company. Fear not, young
freshman. You may be less average than
you think.
