## HOW TO GET YOUR NUT DURING NSO 
### 
Hello, freshmen. Roxy Sass
is your humble guide to
gettin' some (and makin'
puns). And she likes to be honest
here: if you're a late-blooming
nerd like much of Stanford's
Class of 2015, you probably
haven't had sex yet. (If you have,
simmer down now: it was prob
ably much sloppier and more
underwhelming than you think
it was.)
But never fear: it's time to
turn over a new leaf â€” and find
a consenting lover under it. Tips?
Oh, Roxy knows about tips.
Take advantage of your sur
roundings.
NSO is a rare and wondrous
time during which it's actually
cool to do dorm chants and wear
your dorm t-shirt. And although
dormcest is a bad idea, it's in
evitable so you might as well
capitalize.
So you have your eyes on
that hottie down the hall. Roxy's
got suggestions: bribe your RA to
put you in the same scavenger
hunt group then cozy up on
the Muni. Rub up against them
during fountain hopping
"Oh, man, I'm all wet!" Or sud
denly find yourself "lost" togeth
er when Band Run passes by
Lake Lag. That swampy smell
can really be an aphrodisiac.
Bond.
Gauge their enthusiasm
during those flag-waving chants
and romps. Are they sooo into it?
Chant louder and smile! Totally
over it? "Cmon, this is lame. Let's
get out of here." Even Roxy can't
spell bondage without a bond.
Avoid certain targets.
That girl or guy who's flirt
ing incessantly with you but is
still holding onto a long-distance
relationship from high school?
You'll either be a cock-tease vic
tim or a home-wrecker. And
RAs, TAs and clinging vines? The
trouble's not worth the nut.
Avoid.
Above all, go to town. Roxy
thinks fondly of her NSO days,
when she really learned how to
put the "o" in NSO. Soon you'll
be putting nose to the grindstone
all night; for this precious week,
put your heart (and other parts)
into grinding all night.
