# TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 2011: QUICK TAKES
## 
### 
At an event like TIFF, the overwhelm
ing amount of film showings makes it im
possible to come even close to catching
everything. We're holding some reviews
(like "50/50", "The Ides of March", "Like
Crazy", etc.) until their North American
premiere date but here are our intrepid
movie critic's quick takes on a couple
movies screened in Toronto:
Take This Waltz
"Take This Waltz," the newest feature
from Canadian wunderkind Sarah Pol
ley, follows travel writer Margot
(Michelle Williams) as she tries to keep
her marriage afloat after a chance meet
ing with Daniel (Luke Kirby) while on
assignment at a historic landmark. The
two share a brief flirtation on the plane
and cab ride home, but rather than going
their separate ways afterward, Margot is

shocked to discover that Daniel lives
right across the street from her and hus
band Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook au
thor specializing in chicken. What fol
lows is a largely drawn out but occasion
ally comical situation of will-they-or
won't-they, as what began as a strictly
emotional affair threatens to boil over
into something more. The title of the
film is thus a reference to Margot's strug
gle to maintain her relationships with
both men, whilst trying to come to terms
with her own discontent. Polley, who
also penned the script, presents us with a
delightfully eclectic mix of characters,
which also includes Lou's outspoken al
coholic sister, played by Sarah Silverman.
However as the story trudges on toward
its inevitable conclusion, they become
less compelling. Margot, with her child
like mannerisms, loses her initially en-

dearing appeal as her indecision and vic
tim complex prove tedious and frustrat
ing by the final act. The film has its mo
ments, but by and large feels too twee to
foster serious treatment of its own
themes.â€”M.S.

Take Shelter
Thoroughly suspenseful and
uniquely genre-blending, writer-director
