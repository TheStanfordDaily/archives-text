# TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 2011: QUICK TAKES
## 
### 
At an event like TIFF, the overwhelm
ing amount of film showings makes it im
possible to come even close to catching
everything. We're holding some reviews
(like "50/50", "The Ides of March", "Like
Crazy", etc.) until their North American
premiere date but here are our intrepid
movie critic's quick takes on a couple
movies screened in Toronto:
Take This Waltz
"Take This Waltz," the newest feature
from Canadian wunderkind Sarah Pol
ley, follows travel writer Margot
(Michelle Williams) as she tries to keep
her marriage afloat after a chance meet
ing with Daniel (Luke Kirby) while on
assignment at a historic landmark. The
two share a brief flirtation on the plane
and cab ride home, but rather than going
their separate ways afterward, Margot is

shocked to discover that Daniel lives
right across the street from her and hus
band Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook au
thor specializing in chicken. What fol
lows is a largely drawn out but occasion
ally comical situation of will-they-or
won't-they, as what began as a strictly
emotional affair threatens to boil over
into something more. The title of the
film is thus a reference to Margot's strug
gle to maintain her relationships with
both men, whilst trying to come to terms
with her own discontent. Polley, who
also penned the script, presents us with a
delightfully eclectic mix of characters,
which also includes Lou's outspoken al
coholic sister, played by Sarah Silverman.
However as the story trudges on toward
its inevitable conclusion, they become
less compelling. Margot, with her child
like mannerisms, loses her initially en-

dearing appeal as her indecision and vic
tim complex prove tedious and frustrat
ing by the final act. The film has its mo
ments, but by and large feels too twee to
foster serious treatment of its own
themes.—M.S.

Take Shelter
Thoroughly suspenseful and
uniquely genre-blending, writer-director


Courtesy of Michael Gibson
Jeff Nichols'"Take Shelter"is a
disaster movie crossed with psy
chological thriller. Set amid the
rural cornfields of Ohio, it fol
lows industrial worker Curtis
LaForche (Michael Shannon) as
he experiences a series of in
creasingly graphic nightmares
involving a violent storm. Shak
en by these visions, his erratic
behavior soon begins to take a
toll on his family, which in
cludes wife Samantha (Jessica
Chastain) and the couple's
young, hearing-impaired
daughter, Hannah (Tova Stew
art). As Curtis obsesses over
making preparations for the
storm, tension rises as the audi
ence can no longer be certain of
whether he is somehow glimps
ing the future or merely losing

his mind. On the one hand,
portions of the dreams seem to
carry real-life consequences. On
the other, Curtis is painfully

aware of the fact that his own
mother was diagnosed with
paranoid schizophrenia when
she was his age. Skillfully exe

cuted with a modest budget and
boasting outstanding perform
ances by Shannon and Chas
tain, "Take Shelter" is the
thought-provoking answer to
all the mediocre apocalypse and
environment-themed duds that
have plagued the box office in
recent years. Don't worry if the
premise still sounds improba
ble; just go in with an open
mind and you are sure to be en
thralled. —M.S.
Une vie meilleure (A Better
Life)
Not to be confused with Chris
Weitz's Los Angeles-set film of
the same name, this French and
Canadian co-production from
director C?dric Kahn follows
Yann (Guillaume Canet, a
French Patrick Dempsey look
alike), a cafeteria cook aspiring
to be an executive chef, whose
life takes an unexpected turn
when he becomes romantically

involved with Lebanese waitress
Nadia (Leila Bekhti). On a day
trip with Nadia's young son, the
trio chances upon an aban
doned building near a beautiful
lake the perfect site for open
ing the restaurant that Yann al
ways dreamed of. But their
meager income and savings
forces Yann to make a series of
hasty decisions, which ultimate
ly push their dreams further
away rather than bringing them
closer within reach. As the cou
ple's situation becomes increas
ingly grim, Yann refuses to let
go, even as Nadia shows signs of
moving on. A gritty and bitter
sweet story, "A Better Life" ex
plores the ripple effect that our
everyday actions have as they
reverberate across the long
term, how to adapt in an unfor
giving world that keeps turning
even when you try to stop it and
the personal sacrifices made for
loved ones. —M.S.
