## UNBROKEN DEMILOVATO 
### — andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Everyone loves a comeback kid, and as literally the only Disney
star who can carry a tune, let alone sing, Demi Lovato has
'everyone rooting for her after a long year of personal battles.
Her third album, "Unbroken," isn't quite perfect, but it's good enough
to satisfy the masses while remaining true to her original sound.
In her first two albums, Lovato tended to favor a "rock-princess"
style: the perfect marriage of genres that gave a nod to heavy metal
(Lovato is a fan of bands such as Abigail Williams and Job for a Cow
boy) while still satisfying the throngs of preteen listeners whose defi
nition of emo is a black Abercrombie and Fitch t-shirt.
"Unbroken" shows us Lovato all grown up a little less pretty
princess, a little more out on the town. Lovato makes surprising
moves, the first of which is the decision to work with artists outside
her usual realm. They jump out in the first track, "All Night Long"
featuring Missy Elliott and Timbaland who, with Lovato, make an
unexpectedly successful blend of artists. Lovato's touch remains
prominent with the use of a heavy guitar bass line, yet the quick
tempo catapults "All Night Long" to the traditional radio-friendly sta
tus that defines most of the album.
It's a curious move because Lovato, who Oneßepublic frontman
Ryan Tedder called "one of the best singers I've ever worked with," has
a serious set of pipes. With that voice, she probably should have cho
sen to feature her immense talent a little more in "Unbroken," which

largely consists of ultrapop, up
beat hits.
However, Lovato made an
undoubtedly sawy move in
constructing an album which
conforms to the mainstream
sound that has albums flying
off the shelves (see also: Perry,
Katy). Thanks to the big name
collaborations, such as "Who's
That Boy" feat. Dev, "Together"
feat. Jason Der?lo and "You're
My Only Shorty" feat. Iyaz,
"Unbroken" contains at least
five potential hit singles that
could prop up album sales for a
long, long time.
Besides, an entirely weepy
album might be expected from
a 19-year old fresh out of rehab.
Instead, Lovato shows her re-

silience by combining both
heartache and happiness in her
lyrics and her beats. For in
stance, the title track, "Unbro
ken," is unexpectedly upbeat
while touching on her tumul
tuous past {"l'm gonna love you
like I've never been broken"). On
her first single, "Skyscraper",
Lovato brings the heat, pas
sionately singing her heart out.
The Disney starlet could
have easily drowned in this
album, but the effort is largely
triumphant, even in its most
poignant moments. "Unbro
ken" is more than enough for
Lovato to regain her momen
tum and find success as an im
mensely talented and much
wiser adult artist.
