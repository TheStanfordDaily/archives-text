## PUTTING THE 'INTENSE' IN ARTS INTENSIVE and life in September Studies 
### ISSRA OMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many Stanford students, the
month of September signifies the last
few carefree weeks of summer vaca
tion to be spent without worrying
about the start of classes looming in
the not-so-distant future. However, during this
time, many other students are already on cam
pus hard at work at the Sophomore College
(SoCo) and Arts Intensive programs.
As part of the larger September Studies
program, SoCo and Arts Intensive may sound
like sacrificing summer in order to start school
early. But with trips to the White House, film
making, dancing to professionally choreo
graphed routines and more, the two programs
consist of anything but typical schoolwork.
Students who participate in SoCo, a three

week residential program, enjoy the best of
what Stanford has to offer. In a seminar set
ting, classes of 12-14 students become com
pletely immersed in the focus of the course.
Led by faculty and experts in the field, stu
dents are exposed not only to the topic of the
seminar, but also to a new perspective on
learning.
"I applied for SoCo not just out of interest
in the topic but because I wanted the chance to
learn from and work with esteemed faculty
and insightful students from different back
grounds who shared a common interest,"
Veronica Polin 'l4 wrote in an email to The
Daily.
To fully understand and explore the topic,
Polin's SoCo, "The Face of Battle," traveled to
Washington, D.C.
'"The Face of Battle' was an in-depth study
of warfare focusing on Gettysburg, the Battle

of Little Bighorn and Afghanistan," Polin said.
"We applied this knowledge to contemporary
issues of national security. By visiting the
places in which these critical decisions are
made, we got a first-hand look at decisions
that affect our entire country."
Unlike many typical classes, the September
Studies classes allow participants to learn the
material in a hands-on manner.
For Savannah Kopp 'l4, who took an Arts
Intensive course on documentary filmmaking,
the class was away to broaden her perspective
and knowledge on a subject she already stud
ies.
"I'm really interested in writing, but more
specifically, I am interested in screen-writing,"
Kopp said. "I wanted to take this course to fur
ther explore different sides of the process."
Kopp and others taking the course spent
days filming and directing their own docu

mentaries.Totally immersed in their roles, par
ticipants in the class were able to draw conclu
sions about their own interests.
"Arts Intensive is really fast paced be
fore one assignment or project is finished, you
are assigned another one," Kopp said. "It is a
crash course in filmmaking. They really put
the 'intensive' in Arts Intensive."
Makiko Fujimoto 'l4, a participant in the
ballet Arts Intensive, echoed Kopp's senti
ment. "It's intense," Fujimoto said, chuckling.
For Fujimoto, a classically trained ballet
dancer practicing since she was four years old,
Arts Intensive was something she needed to
reset her focus.
"Arts Intensive really rekindled my love of
ballet," Fujimoto said. "I learned so much
more about technique and style, which pushed

me out of my comfort zone and
made me realize there's so much I
know I want to explore in the fu
ture."

Unlike Fujimoto, Kopp's inter
ests didn't directly change as a re
sult of Arts Intensive; however, her
insight and understanding did.
"Filmmaking is a lot harder and
more technical than I thought," she
said. "I definitely earned a lot of re
spect for the process. Even though
I'm more interested in the screen
writing aspect, it's good that I had
the chance to see this side of it."
Frederik Groce 'l4 also came
out with valuable insights from
SoCo.
"We really were able to delve
deeply into the subject since it was
what we dedicated all of our time
to," Groce said of his course on
American conservatism. "The fact
that the class was in an intimate
seminar setting and that everyone
did the reading made the discus
sions so much richer."
Like others, Groce's SoCo
course inspired him to branch out
to explore other academic fields.
"It has really motivated me to
learn more about public policy, and
it also reinforced my idea of going
into the social sciences," he said.
While it is clear that SoCo and
Arts Intensive courses usually posi
tively influence their participants,
past students add that these bene
fits only increase with time.
"SoCo was such a valuable expe
rience, and it was how education
should be," said Denise Johnson
'l2, who took a course about small
pox and infectious disease. Every
day I was so happy and excited to go
to class. It made me want to take it
upon myself to ask questions and
learn the material well."
In addition to fostering self-mo
tivation and a new approach to
learning, SoCo also allowed her to
make important connections and
friendships, Johnson said.
"After SoCo, I've made so much
more of an effort to go to office
hours and to get to know the profes
sors," she said. "I still talk to my
SoCo professor, and he has helped
me with everything from courses to
major advising. The experience
made me want to take advantage of
all Stanford has to offer."
Nabila Abdallah 'l3, a past par
ticipant of the graphic design Arts
Intensive, considers her experience
to be a formative and memorable
one.
"For me, Arts Intensive was a
way for me to continue my interest
in the arts," Abdallah said. "I was
very artistic in high school, but I
didn't really get the chance to ex
plore the arts at Stanford or get cre
atively involved. Through Arts In
tensive, I was allowed to go on a trip
to New York with 15 other students
to see the art scene up close. We
went to Broadway, the MOMA and
all these other places that really al
lowed me to see what American
arts culture is all about."
The verdict from most Septem
ber Studies participants is clear.
"Think about it, you could be
doing nothing at home for three
weeks or you could be having the
most amazing experience instead,"
Johnson said. "Your choice."
