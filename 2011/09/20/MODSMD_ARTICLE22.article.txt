## PUTTING THE 'INTENSE' IN ARTS INTENSIVE and life in September Studies 
### ISSRA OMER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many Stanford students, the
month of September signifies the last
few carefree weeks of summer vaca
tion to be spent without worrying
about the start of classes looming in
the not-so-distant future. However, during this
time, many other students are already on cam
pus hard at work at the Sophomore College
(SoCo) and Arts Intensive programs.
As part of the larger September Studies
program, SoCo and Arts Intensive may sound
like sacrificing summer in order to start school
early. But with trips to the White House, film
making, dancing to professionally choreo
graphed routines and more, the two programs
consist of anything but typical schoolwork.
Students who participate in SoCo, a three

week residential program, enjoy the best of
what Stanford has to offer. In a seminar set
ting, classes of 12-14 students become com
pletely immersed in the focus of the course.
Led by faculty and experts in the field, stu
dents are exposed not only to the topic of the
seminar, but also to a new perspective on
learning.
"I applied for SoCo not just out of interest
in the topic but because I wanted the chance to
learn from and work with esteemed faculty
and insightful students from different back
grounds who shared a common interest,"
Veronica Polin 'l4 wrote in an email to The
Daily.
To fully understand and explore the topic,
Polin's SoCo, "The Face of Battle," traveled to
Washington, D.C.
'"The Face of Battle' was an in-depth study
of warfare focusing on Gettysburg, the Battle

of Little Bighorn and Afghanistan," Polin said.
"We applied this knowledge to contemporary
issues of national security. By visiting the
places in which these critical decisions are
made, we got a first-hand look at decisions
that affect our entire country."
Unlike many typical classes, the September
Studies classes allow participants to learn the
material in a hands-on manner.
For Savannah Kopp 'l4, who took an Arts
Intensive course on documentary filmmaking,
the class was away to broaden her perspective
and knowledge on a subject she already stud
ies.
"I'm really interested in writing, but more
specifically, I am interested in screen-writing,"
Kopp said. "I wanted to take this course to fur
ther explore different sides of the process."
Kopp and others taking the course spent
days filming and directing their own docu

mentaries.Totally immersed in their roles, par
ticipants in the class were able to draw conclu
sions about their own interests.
"Arts Intensive is really fast paced be
fore one assignment or project is finished, you
are assigned another one," Kopp said. "It is a
crash course in filmmaking. They really put
the 'intensive' in Arts Intensive."
Makiko Fujimoto 'l4, a participant in the
ballet Arts Intensive, echoed Kopp's senti
ment. "It's intense," Fujimoto said, chuckling.
For Fujimoto, a classically trained ballet
dancer practicing since she was four years old,
Arts Intensive was something she needed to
reset her focus.
"Arts Intensive really rekindled my love of
ballet," Fujimoto said. "I learned so much
more about technique and style, which pushed
