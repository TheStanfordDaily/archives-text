Aboukhadijeh 'l2 isn't quite there yet.
Born and raised in Sacramento by a schoolteacher mother, and
an electrical engineer, father, Aboukhadijeh credits his parents
with sparking his love of computers and electronics at an early age.
"When I was younger, my dad always had all these electronics
parts lying around the house, and so in my garage there was all this
stuff I could play around with," he said. "Half the time I didn't un
derstand what I was doing, but I would pretend that I was building
something."
The breaking point occurred years later when his dad bought
the family a computer.
"It was a really junky old machine, but he allowed me to do
whatever I wanted on it," he said. "I did a lot of things like down
load games. And I didn't know that I'd get viruses if I did that sort
of thing, so I basically ruined the computer. I was worried I would
get in trouble, so I worked really hard at getting rid of the viruses. I
couldn't tell my parents about it, so I basically did it all on my own."
While dealing with such frustrations might turn some off to pro
gramming, it only encouraged Aboukhadijeh. At age 11, he made
his first website. In high school, he created Study Notes, a program
similar to Spark Notes that provides free study materials for stu
dents taking AP classes or prepping for the SATs.
Then, one night during spring quarter of his sophomore year, he
was faced with a difficult decision: complete a dare by his friend to
put together a functioning website in an hour or watch a movie. He
chose the former, and even though he lost the dare, he succeeded
on a whole other level.
At 9:32 p.m. that night, Aboukhadijeh launched You Tube In
stant and the rest is history.
"I woke up at 8:00 a.m. the next morning to get a glass of water,
and on the way to the kitchen, I checked my phone and I had a
bunch of texts and voice messages," he said. "I saw one from The
Washington Post that Google Voice had transcribed automatically.
I thought maybe it was a typo, but when I listened to the message,
I realized it was real. I went on my laptop to see what was going on,

and I didn't leave my computer until 5:00 a.m. the next day. I never
got that glass of water."
After the site went viral, a discussion thread on Hacker News, a
popular site for programmers, made Aboukhadijeh realize just
how lucky he was that he launched the site almost instantly instead
of waiting to fine-tune it.
"Someone [on the site] wrote that he had been working on his
version of You Tube Instant for months, but he didn't release it be
cause he wanted to add all these complicated features,"
Aboukhadijeh said. "He let all those features get in the way of
launching his site, and because of that, he missed the boat."
Even though he's thankful for the attention the site has re
ceived, Aboukhadijeh is still trying to get his head around the
whole experience.
"I feel like a three-hour project that I built and the amount of
media it generated was sort of unbalanced," he said. "The reaction
to the project was really crazy, because the co-founder of You Tube
offered me a job, and it's sort of the story that everyone wants to
hear."

working for Facebook as a software engineer intern, learning the

ins and outs of programming at a
major company.
Recently profiled for New York
Magazine and nominated for a .Net
award, Aboukhadijeh is hopeful
that he will not be forever labeled as
the "You Tube Instant guy."
"It's been really life-changing for
me," he said. "This whole magazine
profile really started this wave of in
terviews, but I'm sort of ready to
move on to my next project and do
something else."
Last winter, Aboukhadijeh and
Jake Becker, the friend who dared
him to create You Tube Instant,
launched a new project, Instant.fm,
a site that specializes in creating
music playlists out of You Tube
videos. Although it was a fun proj
ect, Aboukhadijeh is looking for
ward to breaking new ground on the
Web.
Aboukhadijeh is already broad
ening his focus, having spent three
months of his summer interning at
Quora.com, a question-and-answer
site that he feels provided him with
the experience necessary to eventu
ally run his own startup someday.
Aside from programming, com
puter science section leading and

serving as president of the Stanford
Association for Computing Ma
chinery, Aboukhadijeh plays intra
mural basketball and enjoys watch
ing anime with friends.
He says that his Stanford experi
ence has nurtured his passion in
computer programming, specifical
ly citing his CSIO6L instructor, com
puter science lecturer Keith
Schwarz, as an inspiration.
"[Schwarz] was so passionate
about what he was talking about
that he would literally bounce up
and down while he was lecturing,"
Aboukhadijeh said. "I'd never been
that excited to attend class, and it
made me want to become a section
leader."
As for life after graduation?
Aboukhadijeh isn't certain. Choos
ing between pursuing a coterminal
degree in computer science and
starting his own company, he is
keeping his options open.
Nevertheless, Aboukhadijeh at
tributes the bulk of his success to a
combination of luck, diligence and
not being afraid to fail.
"The fact that I chose to actually
build You Tube Instant instead of
watching a movie was something
that was in my control and that was
my decision," he said. "I think that
you can create your own luck."
