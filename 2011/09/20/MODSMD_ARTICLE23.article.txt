Aboukhadijeh 'l2 isn't quite there yet.
Born and raised in Sacramento by a schoolteacher mother, and
an electrical engineer, father, Aboukhadijeh credits his parents
with sparking his love of computers and electronics at an early age.
"When I was younger, my dad always had all these electronics
parts lying around the house, and so in my garage there was all this
stuff I could play around with," he said. "Half the time I didn't un
derstand what I was doing, but I would pretend that I was building
something."
The breaking point occurred years later when his dad bought
the family a computer.
"It was a really junky old machine, but he allowed me to do
whatever I wanted on it," he said. "I did a lot of things like down
load games. And I didn't know that I'd get viruses if I did that sort
of thing, so I basically ruined the computer. I was worried I would
get in trouble, so I worked really hard at getting rid of the viruses. I
couldn't tell my parents about it, so I basically did it all on my own."
While dealing with such frustrations might turn some off to pro
gramming, it only encouraged Aboukhadijeh. At age 11, he made
his first website. In high school, he created Study Notes, a program
similar to Spark Notes that provides free study materials for stu
dents taking AP classes or prepping for the SATs.
Then, one night during spring quarter of his sophomore year, he
was faced with a difficult decision: complete a dare by his friend to
put together a functioning website in an hour or watch a movie. He
chose the former, and even though he lost the dare, he succeeded
on a whole other level.
At 9:32 p.m. that night, Aboukhadijeh launched You Tube In
stant and the rest is history.
"I woke up at 8:00 a.m. the next morning to get a glass of water,
and on the way to the kitchen, I checked my phone and I had a
bunch of texts and voice messages," he said. "I saw one from The
Washington Post that Google Voice had transcribed automatically.
I thought maybe it was a typo, but when I listened to the message,
I realized it was real. I went on my laptop to see what was going on,

and I didn't leave my computer until 5:00 a.m. the next day. I never
got that glass of water."
After the site went viral, a discussion thread on Hacker News, a
popular site for programmers, made Aboukhadijeh realize just
how lucky he was that he launched the site almost instantly instead
of waiting to fine-tune it.
"Someone [on the site] wrote that he had been working on his
version of You Tube Instant for months, but he didn't release it be
cause he wanted to add all these complicated features,"
Aboukhadijeh said. "He let all those features get in the way of
launching his site, and because of that, he missed the boat."
Even though he's thankful for the attention the site has re
ceived, Aboukhadijeh is still trying to get his head around the
whole experience.
"I feel like a three-hour project that I built and the amount of
media it generated was sort of unbalanced," he said. "The reaction
to the project was really crazy, because the co-founder of You Tube
offered me a job, and it's sort of the story that everyone wants to
hear."

Aboukhadijeh 'l2 developed YouTube Instant in a matter of hours
when a friend dared him to build a website. But to the prolific programmer,
success isn't simply a matter of luck.
