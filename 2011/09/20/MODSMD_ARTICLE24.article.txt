# COMPANY CULTURE SHOCK
## Internships in Asia are 'something to get used 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
The precious time when students indulge
in the stupor of warm weather and drink
the ambrosia of relaxation the lull of
summertime, for many, is a chance to
wind down, an escape from the hectic
pace of problem sets, papers and exams.
Some students, however, choose to walk the path
less traveled a summer immersed in Asia's cor
porate culture.
The Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) of
fers summer internship opportunities in Asia open
to all Stanford undergraduates. The internships
allow students a chance for a deeper immersion in
the local language and culture while working in a
corporate environment.
Since many of the internships either require par
ticipants to possess a certain level of foreign lan
guage proficiency or are located in English-speak
ing workplaces, the language barrier is minimized.
For many students, it was not so much the language
that was a challenge but adjusting to the local cul
ture and brisk professionalism of the workplace,
"The subway culture [in Beijing] was something
to get used to," said Katie Zhou 'l3, who worked as
a graphic designer at Leyou, a specialty retailer for
maternity and baby products in China. "People
aren't as friendly. You don't say hi or acknowledge
them. You had to push and shove, and be more ag
gressive to get to where you had to be."
There is no time for slacking off or procrastina
tion at work, which typically starts at 9 a.m. and ends
at 6 p.m. Student interns are assigned large and de
manding projects that not only put their skills to the
test, but often force them to learn new ones.
