# COMPANY CULTURE SHOCK
## Internships in Asia are 'something to get used 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
The precious time when students indulge
in the stupor of warm weather and drink
the ambrosia of relaxation the lull of
summertime, for many, is a chance to
wind down, an escape from the hectic
pace of problem sets, papers and exams.
Some students, however, choose to walk the path
less traveled a summer immersed in Asia's cor
porate culture.
The Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) of
fers summer internship opportunities in Asia open
to all Stanford undergraduates. The internships
allow students a chance for a deeper immersion in
the local language and culture while working in a
corporate environment.
Since many of the internships either require par
ticipants to possess a certain level of foreign lan
guage proficiency or are located in English-speak
ing workplaces, the language barrier is minimized.
For many students, it was not so much the language
that was a challenge but adjusting to the local cul
ture and brisk professionalism of the workplace,
"The subway culture [in Beijing] was something
to get used to," said Katie Zhou 'l3, who worked as
a graphic designer at Leyou, a specialty retailer for
maternity and baby products in China. "People
aren't as friendly. You don't say hi or acknowledge
them. You had to push and shove, and be more ag
gressive to get to where you had to be."
There is no time for slacking off or procrastina
tion at work, which typically starts at 9 a.m. and ends
at 6 p.m. Student interns are assigned large and de
manding projects that not only put their skills to the
test, but often force them to learn new ones.
Ethan Saeta 'l3 and Grace
Kwan 'l4, interns at True Run
Media, were given the daunting
task of creating a running Chinese
school-finder website completely
from scratch in 10 weeks.
"We were supposed to make it
so that it would have all the interna
tional schools in China, both in
English and Chinese, so you could
compare these schools in terms of
money, location, that kind of thing,"
Saeta said. "The problem was that
neither of us had ever done any
thing web development wise. So we
were trying to make and learn at
the same time."
Although the two ended up
moving on to a different project in
the second half of the internship
visiting local restaurants, clubs and
bars and writing reviews on them
Saeta emphasized the value of
the opportunity to tackle a difficult
project.
"It definitely highlighted how
much I needed to learn," Saeta said,
who anticipates taking four com
puter science classes this fall. "It
made me realize how crazy those
services like Google are. The imple
mentation of something that seems
so simple making a clickable
button, for example was as

toundingly difficult."
Adapting to a work culture that
places a strong emphasis on hierar
chy was another skill that students
had to add to their repertoire.
"One challenge I had was ad
justing to Korean work culture,
which puts much emphasis on hier
archy; whereas I am more familiar
with American work notions like
meritocracy and pragmatism,"
Haiy Le 'l2 wrote in an email to the
Daily.
Le interned at the Asia-Pacific
Center of Education for Interna
tional Understanding (UNESCO
APCEIU).
"There [were] some moments
when I had to keep my frustration
in check when dealing with the bu
reaucracy and a lot of red tape that
comes with working in an intergov
ernmental organization."
"But then again, there are some
benefits, like when my boss usually
offered to pay for my meals," Le
added.
Many felt the satisfaction of fin
ishing a project is well worth the fre
netic, headache-inducing tempo of
work.
"It was very furious," Zhou said.
"My department was under a lot of
pressure, but I will miss opportuni
ties to contribute to a company and
to see my work as something tangi
ble."
