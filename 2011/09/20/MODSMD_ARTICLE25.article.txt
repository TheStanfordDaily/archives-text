## LUCK AIRS IT OUT Cardinal offense ignites in desert rout of Wildcats 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
For the third straight week, the No. 5 Stan
ford football team appeared out of sync in the
first half. But for the third straight week, the
Cardinal responded with a dominant second
half, blanking Arizona after the break to win
37-10 in Tucson.
In a highly touted battle of quarterbacks,
Arizona's Nick Foles was far superior in the
first half, completing his first 17 passes of the
game while shredding the Stanford defense
for 183 yards. The Cardinal responded, hold
ing Foles to just 56 yards on 7-for-16 passing
the rest of the way.

Meanwhile, the Stanford offense rolled
over the overmatched Wildcat defense. Red
shirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck led the
way for the Cardinal, racking up 325 passing
yards and two touchdowns. Junior running
back Stepfan Taylor had a career day on the
ground, rushing for 153 yards on 22 carries.
Early on, though, the Stanford offense had
trouble breaking through a pumped-up Ari
zona defense. After a punt on its first series,
the Cardinal drove inside the Arizona 10-
yard line until Luck appeared to throw his
second interception of the year. However, the
play was overturned on replay, as the ball
touched the ground, giving redshirt freshman
kicker Jordan Williamson the opportunity to
kick a short field goal to put the first points on
the board.

In the remaining three offensive series of
the first half, Stanford ventured into the red
zone each time. Leading 3-0, first-year head
coach David Shaw elected to go for it on
fourth-and-one from the Arizona 24. The
move paid off, as a misdirection pitch left soph
omore running back Anthony Wilkerson open
for an untouched 24-yard touchdown run. That
would be the only Cardinal touchdown of the
first half, though, as Stanford had to settle for
short Williamson field goals on its last two
drives.

On the other side of the ball, Stanford had
no answer for Foles and the Wildcats' passing
game. Thanks to a sack and staunch run de
fense, the Cardinal forced punts on each of
the first two Arizona drives, but then Foles
started to go to work. FTis first six throws were
completed to six different receivers, and the
Wildcat wideouts found plenty of room un
derneath, consistently beating the Stanford
defensive backs.

Trailing 13-3, Arizona mounted a 79-yard
touchdown drive. Due to a poor running
game, Foles actually threw for 84 yards dur
ing the drive, capping it off with a six-yard
throw to wide receiver Juron Criner, who
played just 12 days after undergoing an ap
pendectomy Criner led the Wildcats with
six catches on the day.
At the end of the half, Arizona had a
chance to take the lead. Trailing 16-10 with
just seconds remaining, Foles had Criner
streaking open down the left side. It looked
to be an easy touchdown, but senior quarter
back Johnson Bademosi alertly grabbed
Criner's arm to prevent the score. The pass
interference penalty left Arizona with a field
goal try on the final play of the half, but Ari

zona's Jaime Salazar shanked a 45-yarder to
keep the score 16-10 at the break.
Salazar missed an even shorter field goal
on the first drive of the second half, and from
there it was all Stanford.
Luck used his stable of tight ends to good
effect, throwing second-half touchdowns to
redshirt sophomores Levine Toilolo and
Zach Ertz. Toilolo, who had no catches in the
first two games of the year, led Stanford with
102 receiving yards on just four catches.
The Stanford running game, which start
ed slowly once again, eventually wore down
the Arizona defense. The Cardinal burned
seven minutes off the clock with a 12-play,
91-yard drive in the fourth. Nine of those
plays were runs, including a two-yard touch
down scamper by redshirt senior running

back Jeremy Stewart to close the scoring at
37-10.
Despite the win, Stanford suffered some
big losses during the game. Senior wide re
ceiver Chris Owusu, redshirt junior tight end
Coby Fleener and junior linebacker Shayne
Skov all left the game due to injury, and only
Owusu returned to action. Fleener appeared
to sustain a concussion, but Skov's injury ap
peared much more serious. Skov could not
put weight on his left knee and was in a brace
on the sideline for the rest of the game.
The injured Stanford athletes will have
time to rest, as the Cardinal has a bye this
week. Stanford's next game will be at home
against UCLA on Oct. 1.

In the remaining three offensive series of
the first half, Stanford ventured into the red
zone each time. Leading 3-0, first-year head
coach David Shaw elected to go for it on
fourth-and-one from the Arizona 24. The
move paid off, as a misdirection pitch left soph
omore running back Anthony Wilkerson open
for an untouched 24-yard touchdown run. That
would be the only Cardinal touchdown of the
first half, though, as Stanford had to settle for
short Williamson field goals on its last two
drives.

On the other side of the ball, Stanford had
no answer for Foles and the Wildcats' passing
game. Thanks to a sack and staunch run de
fense, the Cardinal forced punts on each of
the first two Arizona drives, but then Foles
started to go to work. FTis first six throws were
completed to six different receivers, and the
Wildcat wideouts found plenty of room un
derneath, consistently beating the Stanford
defensive backs.

Trailing 13-3, Arizona mounted a 79-yard
touchdown drive. Due to a poor running
game, Foles actually threw for 84 yards dur
ing the drive, capping it off with a six-yard
throw to wide receiver Juron Criner, who
played just 12 days after undergoing an ap
pendectomy Criner led the Wildcats with
six catches on the day.
At the end of the half, Arizona had a
chance to take the lead. Trailing 16-10 with
just seconds remaining, Foles had Criner
streaking open down the left side. It looked
to be an easy touchdown, but senior quarter
back Johnson Bademosi alertly grabbed
Criner's arm to prevent the score. The pass
interference penalty left Arizona with a field
goal try on the final play of the half, but Ari

zona's Jaime Salazar shanked a 45-yarder to
keep the score 16-10 at the break.
Salazar missed an even shorter field goal
on the first drive of the second half, and from
there it was all Stanford.
Luck used his stable of tight ends to good
effect, throwing second-half touchdowns to
redshirt sophomores Levine Toilolo and
Zach Ertz. Toilolo, who had no catches in the
first two games of the year, led Stanford with
102 receiving yards on just four catches.
The Stanford running game, which start
ed slowly once again, eventually wore down
the Arizona defense. The Cardinal burned
seven minutes off the clock with a 12-play,
91-yard drive in the fourth. Nine of those
plays were runs, including a two-yard touch
down scamper by redshirt senior running

back Jeremy Stewart to close the scoring at
37-10.
Despite the win, Stanford suffered some
big losses during the game. Senior wide re
ceiver Chris Owusu, redshirt junior tight end
Coby Fleener and junior linebacker Shayne
Skov all left the game due to injury, and only
Owusu returned to action. Fleener appeared
to sustain a concussion, but Skov's injury ap
peared much more serious. Skov could not
put weight on his left knee and was in a brace
on the sideline for the rest of the game.
The injured Stanford athletes will have
time to rest, as the Cardinal has a bye this
week. Stanford's next game will be at home
against UCLA on Oct. 1.
