# No. 5 Stanford in the hunt for a national title
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After three games, the Stanford football
team is right where it wants to be sitting
with a perfect 3-0 record and boasting the
nation's longest active winning streak, cur
rently 11 games dating back to 2010.
After steamrolling San Jose State 57-3
on opening weekend, crushing Duke 44-14
on the road and playing a flawless second
half to roll Arizona 37-10 in the desert, No. 5
Stanford (3-0,1-0 Pac-12) gets a break from
competition this weekend with an open
date to prepare for a home matchup against
UCLA on Oct. 1.
But even though Stanford has opened up
2011 with large margins of victory and a
high national ranking, the start to the season
hasn't been all flowers and sunshine. The
Cardinal hasn't struggled to put up points or
keep opponents out of the end zone, but a
couple of speed bumps so far have been
self-induced.
After scoring 27 points in the first half in
the season opener against San Jose State,
the Cardinal struggled to separate itself
early against Duke and Arizona, leading the
perfectionist Cardinal players and coaches
to express concern as they head into the
heart of the Pac-12 season.
"We have a lot of things to improve on,
obviously," said superstar quarterback An
drew Luck after the Arizona win, echoing
the works of head coach David Shaw.
"We just need to establish a rhythm,"
Shaw said. "We had a couple of nice drives
in the first half. But in the second half we
came out in rhythm. We need to start the
first half like we start the second half."
While Stanford did find its feet in both
games to pull away for convincing wins, the
nitpicking is a sign of just how high the ex
pectations are on the Farm this season.
On offense, Heisman Trophy-candidate
Luck has been predictably excellent so far
he has racked up 786 yards and eight
touchdowns against just one interception
through the air, and added another touch
down on the ground with a scramble for a
score in the first game of the season.
Luck's quick start has also helped ink his
name into the history books beside some
elite company; he passed 1970 Heisman
Trophy-winner Jim Plunkett for the third
most passing touchdowns in Stanford histo
ry with his two touchdowns against Ari
zona.
The redshirt junior's supporting cast has
also been effective, particularly running
back Stepfan Taylor, who has already
gained 289 yards on the ground after rush
ing for a career-best 153 yards against Ari
zona.
Through the air, senior wide receiver
Chris Owusu and redshirt senior tight end
Coby Fleener have been Luck's favorite
targets, as Owusu leads the team with 227
yards receiving and Fleener has a team-best
three touchdown catches. Both pass-catch
ers sustained injuries against Arizona, but
neither appeared to be seriously hurt and
