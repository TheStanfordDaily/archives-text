# No. 5 Stanford in the hunt for a national title
## 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After three games, the Stanford football
team is right where it wants to be sitting
with a perfect 3-0 record and boasting the
nation's longest active winning streak, cur
rently 11 games dating back to 2010.
After steamrolling San Jose State 57-3
on opening weekend, crushing Duke 44-14
on the road and playing a flawless second
half to roll Arizona 37-10 in the desert, No. 5
Stanford (3-0,1-0 Pac-12) gets a break from
competition this weekend with an open
date to prepare for a home matchup against
UCLA on Oct. 1.
But even though Stanford has opened up
2011 with large margins of victory and a
high national ranking, the start to the season
hasn't been all flowers and sunshine. The
Cardinal hasn't struggled to put up points or
keep opponents out of the end zone, but a
couple of speed bumps so far have been
self-induced.
After scoring 27 points in the first half in
the season opener against San Jose State,
the Cardinal struggled to separate itself
early against Duke and Arizona, leading the
perfectionist Cardinal players and coaches
to express concern as they head into the
heart of the Pac-12 season.
"We have a lot of things to improve on,
obviously," said superstar quarterback An
drew Luck after the Arizona win, echoing
the works of head coach David Shaw.
"We just need to establish a rhythm,"
Shaw said. "We had a couple of nice drives
in the first half. But in the second half we
came out in rhythm. We need to start the
first half like we start the second half."
While Stanford did find its feet in both
games to pull away for convincing wins, the
nitpicking is a sign of just how high the ex
pectations are on the Farm this season.
On offense, Heisman Trophy-candidate
Luck has been predictably excellent so far
he has racked up 786 yards and eight
touchdowns against just one interception
through the air, and added another touch
down on the ground with a scramble for a
score in the first game of the season.
Luck's quick start has also helped ink his
name into the history books beside some
elite company; he passed 1970 Heisman
Trophy-winner Jim Plunkett for the third
most passing touchdowns in Stanford histo
ry with his two touchdowns against Ari
zona.
The redshirt junior's supporting cast has
also been effective, particularly running
back Stepfan Taylor, who has already
gained 289 yards on the ground after rush
ing for a career-best 153 yards against Ari
zona.
Through the air, senior wide receiver
Chris Owusu and redshirt senior tight end
Coby Fleener have been Luck's favorite
targets, as Owusu leads the team with 227
yards receiving and Fleener has a team-best
three touchdown catches. Both pass-catch
ers sustained injuries against Arizona, but
neither appeared to be seriously hurt and
will likely be able to return to the
lineup soon.
The rebuilt offensive line has
also done an excellent job of keep
ing Luck upright the group re
turned just two starters from last
season but has only allowed two
sacks through the first three games.
But while the highlights so far
have focused mostly on Luck and
his companions on offense, the Car
dinal defense has also been a force,
holding opponents to just an aver
age of nine points a game, ranking
as the seventh-toughest scoring de
fense in the country.
Stanford lost five starters from
the defensive side of the ball after
last season, but the newcomers
haven't missed a beat. Key veterans
have contributed to the success:
senior linebacker Chase Thomas
has 3.5 sacks to lead a defense that
has 13 already, and junior line
backer Shayne Skov has a team
high 19 tackles, although Skov suf
fered a potentially devastating
knee injury early on in the Arizona
game, which could hinder the Car
dinal's title hopes.
Additionally, the special teams
have been a bright spot for the Car
dinal, with kicker Jordan
Williamson a perfect 6-for-6 on
field goals in his first year as the full
time placekicker.
With the combination of a dead
ly, efficient offense and a relentless
defense, Stanford has already posi
tioned itself atop the Pac-12. It
stands as one of just three squads to
still be undefeated, along with rivals
USC and Cal.
The Cardinal appears to be in
prime position to continue its win
ning streak, as Stanford's next three
opponents UCLA, Colorado
and Washington State have a
combined record of 4-5 so far.
UCLA appears to be in particu
larly dire straits already, with two
losses to Houston and Texas on its
record and critics already frothing
about another poor season in the
making under head coach Rick
Neuheisel.
In his four years leading the Bru

ins,Neuheisel's squad has yet to fin
ish higher than eighth in the Pac-10
and has to go on the road to face
Oregon State in its Pac-12 opener
this weekend before rolling into
Stanford Stadium next week in
search of a signature win that could
save a reeling season.
Stanford, on the other hand, will
likely use the off week to improve on
the one area it seems to be lacking in
this season making sure it finish

es off opponents a little sooner.
"We challenged our guys at half
time to take the fight to them,"
Shaw said after the Arizona game.
"To be physical. To see if we could
wear them down. That's the philos
ophy we believe in. Our second half
has got to be better than our first,
and that's what we did tonight. But
we have to start faster."
With eight Pac-12 games left on
the schedule, it's likely that the en

tire conference will be watching to
see if the Cardinal does find that
extra spark, because finding it could
lead Stanford to something it hasn't
accomplished since 1999 a con
ference championship.
Stanford returns to action next
weekend on Saturday, Oct. 1 as it
hosts UCLA.
