# ROAD TO REDEMPTION
## NATION'S TOP-RANKED TEAM FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS 
### NATE ADAMS DEPUTY EDITOR 
After two straight seasons of car
rying a No. 1 ranking into the na
tional championship game only to
lose, it didn't take long for the Stan
ford women's soccer team to regain
its familiar position at the top of the
pack. Just seven games into the 2011
season, the Cardinal (6-0-1) is atop
the national voting with a whopping
824 points.
The ranking is no doubt encour
aging, but Stanford fans know all
too well that it's only a number.
Head coach Paul Ratcliffe is con
cerned with his team proving itself
on the pitch, something the other
wise stellar squad has failed to do
when it really counted in recent
years.
"I honestly don't really look at it
until the end," Ratcliffe said of the
ranking. "That's where it counts,
where you get seeded for the play
offs. That's the only significance for
me."
Stanford lost in the NCAA Col
lege Cup by 1-0 scores to both

North Carolina in 2009 and Notre
Dame in 2010. But the team can
take a bit of solace, perhaps, from its
come-from-behind victory over the
No. 12 Fighting Irish (3-3-1) in the
Stanford Nike Invitational over the
weekend of Sept. 9. The 2-1 thriller,
along with a 2-0 win over No. 15
UC-Irvine two days later, sealed the
tournament for the host Cardinal.
Then-No.l North Carolina (5-1) did
its part to make it Stanford's lucky
day as well, collapsing against un
ranked Texas A&M after holding a
3-1 advantage. That knocked the Tar
Heels down to No. 7 and made Stan
ford the obvious choice for the top
spot.
"It's a reward for our consisten
cy, that we're winning a high per
centage of our games," Ratcliffe
said. "Because at the end of the day,
it can change next week you lose
one and someone else wins a big
game. It just shows that we're con
sistent over a stretch of time. That's
where it's rewarding."
If the team's nonconference sea
son was any indication, Ratcliffe has
plenty to be happy about. Apart

from a scoreless draw against then-
No. 5 Maryland, Stanford won its
first seven matches by three or
more goals, outscored its opponents
23-4 and outshot them 71-33. Senior
forward Lindsay Taylor, a former
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year who
has battled various ailments for the
last two seasons, is leading the of
fense with six goals and 34 shots.
Younger, less experienced play
ers are making an impact as well.
The Cardinal's starting 11 have a
new look this year, most notably in
the form of standout freshman Chi
moa Übogagu. The rookie forward
hasn't missed a start so far, posting
four goals and as many assists in her
first seven games. Sophomore Syd
ney Payne, after just four starts last
season, has opened every game
alongside Übogagu and Taylor this
season and is fifth on the team in
points with five. On defense, junior
Madeleine Thompson has already
started six games matching her
total from 2010 and knocked in
her first collegiate goal against

Senior Camille Levin (2) has led a determined Cardinal team to an undefeated
preseason. The speedy outside back scored her third goal of the
season in Sunday's 2-0 win over No. 18 Santa Clara.
Northwestern on Sept. 4.
Rounding out the Cardinal's
fresh blood are rookie forward
Alex Doll (seven games played,
one assist), rookie midfielder
Lo'eau Laßonta (six games played,
no points) and redshirt freshman
defender Kendall Romine (six
starts, no points). In all, 15 different
players posted a goal or an assist
over the team's first seven matches.
The Cardinal might owe even
more to its young players than ex
pected this season, as junior central
defender Courtney Verloo was
sidelined after tearing a meniscus
in her left knee before the season
opener. The converted forward was
invaluable to Stanford's run at the
College Cup last season, starting 24
games and battling for important
opportunities that can't be reflect
ed on a stat sheet.
Looking ahead, Stanford turns
its attention to a newly elongated
conference season. The transition
to the Pac-12 introduces Utah and
Colorado to Stanford's run of an
nual opponents, a pair of matchups
that will begin in the Cardinal's
newly renovated stadium this Oc
tober. The team to beat in the Pac
-12 this season is perennial power
house UCLA, ranked at No. 4 after
matching Stanford with a 6-0-1
record to open the season. Rival
Cal (6-1-0) snuck into the rankings
last week as well, at No. 22.
First up, though, is the confer
ence opener against Arizona, a
team the Cardinal defeated 3-0 on
the road last season. Stanford hosts
the Wildcats in a one-game week
end this Saturday, kicking off at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium at 7 p.m.
