### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Every week this fall, I'm going
to dissect Stanford football
from a numerical perspec
tive here at Stat on the Back.
Number of the game: 11
What it means: Stanford has now
won 11 consecutive games, good for
the longest active winning streak in the
country. Perhaps more importantly,
though, 11 is the uniform number of
both LevineToilolo and Shayne Skov.
Toilolo broke out with 102 receiving
yards and a touchdown, but Skov's
game had an even bigger impact on
the Cardinal going forward. Skov left
the game with a knee injury and will
miss the rest of the season.
Why it matters: If you have to ask
why winning 11 straight games mat
ters, you don't watch sports very often.
But just for some perspective, the
longest winning streak in school histo
ry is 13 games, set in both 1904-05 and
1937-39, and the longest unbeaten
streak is 15 games, set in 1925-27. Stan
ford's next four games vs. UCLA,
vs. Colorado, at Washington State and
vs. Washington set up nicely for a
significant challenge to those records.
Skov is one of the team's most im
portant players. He was the team's top
tackier in the first two games and is a
big-play threat every down, as seen by
his three Orange Bowl sacks. But rf
you really want to see how much he
means to the team, just look at the way
the other players reacted when he
went down. Chase Thomas, the other
half of the Pac-12's best linebacking
duo, wrote Skov's "11" on his arm in
tribute to his injured teammate. His
teammates afterward emphasized
how big a loss he will be to the team,
and it's clear that the Cardinal will be
without one of its main leaders for the
duration of this injury. Many people
have said that Stanford is no longer a
national championship caliber team
without Skov, and that speaks to his
importance. With Skov out for the
year, it will be up to Jarek Lancaster,
AJ Tarpley and the highly touted
James Vaughters, who have played a
total of one year of college football, to
pick up the slack.
On the bright side, Toilolo broke
out of a mini funk with a very strong
performance. Last year, Toilolo beat
out Konrad Reuland, Coby Fleener
and Zach Ertz for the starting job, and
then promptly got hurt on the second
play of the season. This year, expecta
tions were justifiably high for the phys
ically freakish athlete. A 6-foot-8 guy
that can move is an asset on any team,
let alone one with a tight-end-loving

quarterback like Andrew Luck. How
ever, the first two games brought a
penalty, a couple drops and some mis
communication without a single catch
for Toilolo. After Flccncr went down
with an apparent concussion, Toilolo
responded. Not only did he finally
make a catch, he made impact plays.
Toilolo's four catches: 1) got Stan
ford its first first-down, 2) got Stanford
into the red zone for the first time, 3)
converted a crucial third-down in a
one-score game and was the longest
pass play all day and 4) pushed the lead
to three scores with his first career
touchdown grab and also gave him
over 100 yards receiving. It doesn't get
much better than that. Apart from the
importance in this game, Toilolo's 102-
yard day gave the Cardinal another
proven weapon on offense and showed
the team that it shouldn't miss a beat if
Flccncr needs time to get back to being
100 percent.
Other notable numbers:
7: The number of second-half
points allowed by Stanford through
three games after another post-half
time shutout. Not suiprisingly, this
mark is top in the country. What is sur
prising is that a road team missing its
best defensive player can shut out an
offense as potent as Arizona's, espe
cially on a day when Foles started so
hot.
108: The number of rushing yards
Stanford has allowed all season,
equating to 36 rushing yards allowed
per game. That's second in the country,
and the figure could be even lower. On
the first series of the second halt
Keola Antolin gashed the Stanford D
for 45 rushing yards on four carries,
but the drive ended in a missed field
goal. For the rest of the game, Arizona
managed just six yards on 19 carries. In
all, only 11 of the Wildcats' 23 carries
gained yardage.
20: Luck has thrown 20 touch
downs to tight ends since the begin-

ning of last year. That's twice as many
as anyone else in the country. In case
you haven't heard 10,000 times by
now, Stanford has really, really, ridicu
lously good tight ends.
3: After leading the nation in third
down conversion percentage last year,
Stanford was just 7-for-16 on third
downs against Arizona. That's three
straight games where Stanford failed
to convert half its third downs, drop
ping the Cardinal to 61st in the nation
with a 42.1 conversion percentage.
Last year, Stanford did not have a
game all season with a conversion rate
that low, and only twice did the Cardi
nal fail to get to 50 percent.
567: Despite having a fairly un
flashy performance, Stanford still
racked up 567 total yards. That's more
than the Cardinal had in any game last
year.
37: While Stanford had a huge day
yardage-wise, the team scored a rela
tively pedestrian 37 points. Pedestrian
for Stanford, that is. During the Cardi
nal's 11-game winning streak, the 37
points are good for the second-fewest
points Stanford has scored.
13: Jordan Williamson scored 13
points. Arizona scored 10. When your
kicker outscores the other team,
things are generally going well.
Stanford is off this week, but Stat
on the Back doesn't take a bye. I'll be
back next week to look at the season
so far and what lies ahead.
