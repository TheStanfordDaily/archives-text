### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Every week this fall, I'm going
to dissect Stanford football
from a numerical perspec
tive here at Stat on the Back.
Number of the game: 11
What it means: Stanford has now
won 11 consecutive games, good for
the longest active winning streak in the
country. Perhaps more importantly,
though, 11 is the uniform number of
both LevineToilolo and Shayne Skov.
Toilolo broke out with 102 receiving
yards and a touchdown, but Skov's
game had an even bigger impact on
the Cardinal going forward. Skov left
the game with a knee injury and will
miss the rest of the season.
Why it matters: If you have to ask
why winning 11 straight games mat
ters, you don't watch sports very often.
But just for some perspective, the
longest winning streak in school histo
ry is 13 games, set in both 1904-05 and
1937-39, and the longest unbeaten
streak is 15 games, set in 1925-27. Stan
ford's next four games vs. UCLA,
vs. Colorado, at Washington State and
vs. Washington set up nicely for a
significant challenge to those records.
Skov is one of the team's most im
portant players. He was the team's top
tackier in the first two games and is a
big-play threat every down, as seen by
his three Orange Bowl sacks. But rf
you really want to see how much he
means to the team, just look at the way
the other players reacted when he
went down. Chase Thomas, the other
half of the Pac-12's best linebacking
duo, wrote Skov's "11" on his arm in
tribute to his injured teammate. His
teammates afterward emphasized
how big a loss he will be to the team,
and it's clear that the Cardinal will be
without one of its main leaders for the
duration of this injury. Many people
have said that Stanford is no longer a
national championship caliber team
without Skov, and that speaks to his
importance. With Skov out for the
year, it will be up to Jarek Lancaster,
AJ Tarpley and the highly touted
James Vaughters, who have played a
total of one year of college football, to
pick up the slack.
On the bright side, Toilolo broke
out of a mini funk with a very strong
performance. Last year, Toilolo beat
out Konrad Reuland, Coby Fleener
and Zach Ertz for the starting job, and
then promptly got hurt on the second
play of the season. This year, expecta
tions were justifiably high for the phys
ically freakish athlete. A 6-foot-8 guy
that can move is an asset on any team,
let alone one with a tight-end-loving
