# Derrick and Co. running hungry
## 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When senior Chris Derrick
came to the Farm in the fall of
2008, he and the Stanford men's
cross country team had one goal
in mind.
Four years, four national
championships.
Unfortunately for "The Ma
chine," this goal did not come to
fruition.
The men are coming off a dis
appointing fourth-place finish at
NCAA nationals last year after
entering the final meet of the
season with a No. 1 ranking. The
performance followed an even
more shocking finish in 2009,
when the Cardinal placed tenth.
Still, Derrick is confident that
the team's chances at a title are
still among the best in the nation.
"I definitely don't think the
window has closed at all," the
two-sport All-American in cross
country and track and field said.
"There are a couple of really, re
ally good teams out there. But
what we've been lacking is per
formance at nationals. We're just
trying to focus on getting our
selves to do the best we can on
that day."
Finding its stride on the
biggest stage is one of the main
objectives for the Card, but it
may not be the biggest problem.
Stanford lost All-American El
liott Heath to graduation at the
end of last season, a loss that un
doubtedly changes the dynamics
of the squad. Derrick, Heath and
senior Jake Riley were the clear
cut top runners, sticking together
through the vast majority of
races last year while pushing the
pace for Stanford.
Even with a vital piece of the

trio missing, Derrick isn't quick
to suggest a major change in
strategy come race days.
"It's kind of unknown at this
point," Derrick said. "Jake and I
are still going to work together,
but we're going to be a bit more
aggressive at the front. We'll feel
it out and try to make the judg
ment on what seems like the best
strategy."
Luckily for the Card, what the
team loses in Heath it may make
up for in depth and incoming
firepower. Derrick pegged Joe
and Jim Rosa, freshmen from
West Windsor, N.J., as two new
runners that could come in and
contribute immediately. But
Derrick stressed that there will
be ample competition for a posi
tion as one of Stanford's scoring
members.
"There's definitely a lot of
opportunity for freshmen to
contribute this year," Derrick
said. "There are a lot of people
contending for the Top 7. That
speaks volumes to the kind of
depth we have."
Stanford will also have to stay
out of the training room as much
as possible in order to succeed in
the coming season. Although
Derrick said that the team cur
rently has a nearly clean bill of
health, the Card has struggled in
recent seasons with injuries to
key runners. But with a bit of
luck on the health front and key
contributions from new runners,
Stanford's ceiling is as high as
ever.
"It's going to be a really tough
competition for the title," Der
rick said,"but I think we're as tal
ented as any team there is."
