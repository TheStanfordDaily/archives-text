Welcome to Stanford
and the U.S.A. If you
are a new student ar
riving from abroad, I
am sure you are very
excited to be here and looking forward
to your next fewyears on the Farm. You
probably feel quite privileged and
proud that you managed to jump
through all the hoops in the application
process and earn acceptance to one of
the world's top academic institutions.
What you might not be aware of yet,
though, is that you have encountered
the good fortune to also land at an ath
letic powerhouse.
My own preconceptions of college
sports in the U.S. were founded on Hol
lywood movies and TV shows; when I
first came here, I was expecting some
thing different. But as Stanford had
never come up in those stories, I
thought it probably just had an average
athletic department. I couldn't have
been more wrong.
Don't let anyone try and convince
you otherwise, this is unquestionably
the No. 1 U.S. university for sports. It
might not have as long and storied of a
history as others in big-money disci
plines like football, baseball and bas
ketball, but its strength lies in playing at
the top of a huge range of sports. The
Cardinal is on a 17-year streak of win
ning the Director's Cup for success in
collegiate athletics, and this dominance
has been so emphatic that last year a
new award was created largely to give
other schools a chance. Against a poor
ly weighted scoring system, it still took
first and fifth place in the women's and
men's competitions, respectively.
Even in the highly competitive
realm of football, Stanford is now
claiming enviable success, finishing
fourth in the country last year.This sea
son it could perhaps have a realistic
shot at the BCS National Champi
onship, the Holy Grail of college athlet
ics.
The really good news for you is that
as a student, you get free access to pret
ty much every sporting event on cam
pus. That even includes football, as
your student ID grants you automatic
membership in the Red Zone. This
year, even men's basketball is free. The
bad news is that you may need to learn
to navigate the point-scoring system to
get a chance to go to any of the really
sought-after football or basketball
gamea But you're Stanford students
now; you should be able to do the
math.
College sports in the United States
are basically professional in all but
name, and any dedicated student
shouldn't miss the chance for both a
free t-shirt and a year of free entertain
ment. You might, though, need some
help adjusting.
The language, for a start, is unique.
Even just hearing Americans discuss
my favorite non-U.S. sport (soccer to
them, football to me) sounds a little bit
alien to me. The pitch becomes afield,
boots become cleats, a clean sheet is a
shutout and a one-nil scoreline be
comes one-and-oh. And don't get me
started on winningest; it is not a real
word.
If you can, try and find a friendly
American to tutor you and explain all
the rules. Watching any live sport is
about having fun with the rest of the
fans, so finding some of those fans to
hang around with and teach you how
to cheer shouldn't be too tough. You
will, however, need a head for num
bers, because talking about sports in
the United States is all about statistics.
Each game generates a box score that
exhaustively converts the players' suc
cesses and failures into hard numbers.
A player can't just have a good game;
they need to tick the right boxes.
The hardest part, in my experience,
will be keeping time. U.S. sports, in gen
eral, flow a lot slower than foreign ones
because of multiple stoppages and
timeouts during the games; the last few
seconds of tight basketball games can
go on forever. Even after a few years of
watching games, this is still something I
struggle with. I don't mean to drift off
during an exciting football game, but

when I'm waiting for the play to restart,
I often find myself people-watching in
the stadium, only to glance back down
in time to realize I just missed the ac
tion.
The best advice I could give you,
though, is to be humble and keen to
leam. American sports are no better
than foreign ones, but they are also no
worse, just different. Like learning a
foreign language, if you show a willing
ness to try and resist talking too much
in your own tongue, you'll have a great
experience here.
Hopefully I'll see you on the bleach
ers.

Tom Taylor's many years of vacation
ing in Stanford's engineering program
have yet to teach him the ways of U.S.
sports. If you can commiserate with
Tom or would like to give him a lesson
in all things Merica, drop him a line at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
