It has finally happened. I've gone
off the deep end. Someone
should lock me up and throw
away the key. I've been thinking
about this 2011 Stanford Cardi
nal football team, and I've realized
something terrifying: this Stanford
team reminds me of the 2001 Miami
Hurricanes. Yes, I'm well aware that
the 2001 Hurricanes are widely recog
nized as the greatest team in college
football history. Yes, I'm also aware
that "The U" was essentially an un
stoppable force in the early 2000s. But
hear me out.
In the process of sifting through a
million different Pac-12 season pre
views this summer, it appeared to me
that college football experts had de
veloped a consensus on the Cardinal.
Almost everyone thought Stanford
would be good (but not great) and
that the departure of Jim Harbaugh
would take away that extra edge that
helped push Stanford to its first BCS
bowl win last year. But that didn't
seem quite right to me. And then it

dawned on me: this Stanford squad
bears a strong resemblance to the best
team in college football history. Just
how did I come to that conclusion?
Let's list off the reasons.

First, let's start with the coaches.
After the 2000 season, Hurricanes
head coach Butch Davis left to take
over the Cleveland Browns. This
paved the way for his mild-mannered
offensive coordinator, Larry Coker, to
take the reins. When Harbaugh left to
take over the 49ers this summer, the
Cardinal thought about making a big
splash, but eventually hired David
Shaw, the cool and collected offensive
coordinator. There's an obvious paral
lel here, but it's not exactly ground
breaking stuff So why else would the
2011 Card evoke the 2001 Canes?
Next, let's look at the previous sea
son. In 2000, Miami lost to Washing
ton in Seattle in week 2, then crushed
every single opponent left on their its
schedule, with the only close game
