It has finally happened. I've gone
off the deep end. Someone
should lock me up and throw
away the key. I've been thinking
about this 2011 Stanford Cardi
nal football team, and I've realized
something terrifying: this Stanford
team reminds me of the 2001 Miami
Hurricanes. Yes, I'm well aware that
the 2001 Hurricanes are widely recog
nized as the greatest team in college
football history. Yes, I'm also aware
that "The U" was essentially an un
stoppable force in the early 2000s. But
hear me out.
In the process of sifting through a
million different Pac-12 season pre
views this summer, it appeared to me
that college football experts had de
veloped a consensus on the Cardinal.
Almost everyone thought Stanford
would be good (but not great) and
that the departure of Jim Harbaugh
would take away that extra edge that
helped push Stanford to its first BCS
bowl win last year. But that didn't
seem quite right to me. And then it

dawned on me: this Stanford squad
bears a strong resemblance to the best
team in college football history. Just
how did I come to that conclusion?
Let's list off the reasons.

First, let's start with the coaches.
After the 2000 season, Hurricanes
head coach Butch Davis left to take
over the Cleveland Browns. This
paved the way for his mild-mannered
offensive coordinator, Larry Coker, to
take the reins. When Harbaugh left to
take over the 49ers this summer, the
Cardinal thought about making a big
splash, but eventually hired David
Shaw, the cool and collected offensive
coordinator. There's an obvious paral
lel here, but it's not exactly ground
breaking stuff So why else would the
2011 Card evoke the 2001 Canes?
Next, let's look at the previous sea
son. In 2000, Miami lost to Washing
ton in Seattle in week 2, then crushed
every single opponent left on their its
schedule, with the only close game
coming in a 27-24 win over Florida
State. The Canes got an invite to the
Sugar Bowl their first BCS bowl
since 1995 and beat Florida 37-20.
In 2010, Stanford had an early loss to
Oregon in Eugene, and then domi
nated every single opponent left on
the schedule except for a last-second
win over USC and a 17-14 win over
Arizona State. Stanford was invited to
the Orange Bowl and handily defeat
ed Virginia Tech, 40-12. Okay, sure,
both teams were good, but just be
cause the 2001 Hurricanes won the
national title doesn't mean that Stan
ford will do the same. So what else?
Look at the talent both teams have
as returning starters. The Hurricanes
had the most talented team in college
football history, period. They had 10
—10! first-round picks from that
one team. But don't just look at who
was on that team look at what po
sitions they played. The Canes
brought back their quarterback, wide
receiver, top two running backs, left
tackle, tight end, top two safeties and
top two linebackers. In order, that's
Ken Dorsey, Andre Johnson, Clinton
Portis, Frank Gore, Bryant McKinnie,

Jeremy Shockey, Ed Reed, Sean Tay
lor, Jonathan Vilma and D. J. Williams.
The level of talent is mind-blowing.
But take a step back and you'll no
tice that the 2011 Cardinal returns
starters at all of the same positions. In
order, the list goes: Andrew Luck,
Chris Owusu,Stepfan Taylor, Anthony
Wilkerson, Jonathan Martin, Coby
Fleener, Delano Howell, Michael
Thomas, Chase Thomas and Shayne
Skov. I understand that it's ridiculous
to compare these guys to future NFL
Hall of Famers like Ed Reed and
Andre Johnson. But the fact that the
Cardinal has returning starters from a
12-1 team at these critical positions
must mean something particularly
if the best college football team ever re
turned players in all the same places.
So there you have it. I've laid my
sanity out on the line. If Stanford flops
and loses every single game from here
on out, I'll look like a fool for writing
this column. But it's okay I know I
can handle the criticism. Just like for
mer Hurricane Kellen Winslow, I'm a
freaking soldier.

In 2010, Stanford had an early loss to
Oregon in Eugene, and then domi
nated every single opponent left on
the schedule except for a last-second
win over USC and a 17-14 win over
Arizona State. Stanford was invited to
the Orange Bowl and handily defeat
ed Virginia Tech, 40-12. Okay, sure,
both teams were good, but just be
cause the 2001 Hurricanes won the
national title doesn't mean that Stan
ford will do the same. So what else?
Look at the talent both teams have
as returning starters. The Hurricanes
had the most talented team in college
football history, period. They had 10
—10! first-round picks from that
one team. But don't just look at who
was on that team look at what po
sitions they played. The Canes
brought back their quarterback, wide
receiver, top two running backs, left
tackle, tight end, top two safeties and
top two linebackers. In order, that's
Ken Dorsey, Andre Johnson, Clinton
Portis, Frank Gore, Bryant McKinnie,

Jeremy Shockey, Ed Reed, Sean Tay
lor, Jonathan Vilma and D. J. Williams.
The level of talent is mind-blowing.
But take a step back and you'll no
tice that the 2011 Cardinal returns
starters at all of the same positions. In
order, the list goes: Andrew Luck,
Chris Owusu,Stepfan Taylor, Anthony
Wilkerson, Jonathan Martin, Coby
Fleener, Delano Howell, Michael
Thomas, Chase Thomas and Shayne
Skov. I understand that it's ridiculous
to compare these guys to future NFL
Hall of Famers like Ed Reed and
Andre Johnson. But the fact that the
Cardinal has returning starters from a
12-1 team at these critical positions
must mean something particularly
if the best college football team ever re
turned players in all the same places.
So there you have it. I've laid my
sanity out on the line. If Stanford flops
and loses every single game from here
on out, I'll look like a fool for writing
this column. But it's okay I know I
can handle the criticism. Just like for
mer Hurricane Kellen Winslow, I'm a
freaking soldier.
