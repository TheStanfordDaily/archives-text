# MEN'S SOCCER
## Young team searches for a spark 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Two years ago, the Stanford men's soccer
team rode a wave of fresh attacking talent and
the strong presence of a defense anchored by
then-junior All-American Bobby Warshaw to a
Sweet-16 berth in the NCAA Tournament. With
an eight-game improvement over the previous
season, many hoped the season was a hallmark
of things to come and a return to prominence for
the entire program.
But last year, a preseason top-15 ranking did
not translate into regular-season success, as sev
eral critical injuries and a string of bad luck com
bined to halt the Cardinal's progress in a trying
season that saw Stanford finish 8-10 and 4-6 in
the brutal Pac-10.
With Warshaw now moving into a role with
FC Dallas in the MLS, Stanford has sought to re
define itself as a team focused on being able to
control the game and "impose its will on the
other team," according to coach Bret Simon,
now in his 11th season on the Farm.
Six games into the season, though, it's been
tough going for Stanford. A difficult early sched
ule saw the Cardinal play on the road on nation
al television against then-No. 4 Maryland on
Sept. 2. The Terrapins, who are now perched atop
the rankings at No. 1, scored just 22 seconds into
the match to take the wind out of Stanford's
sails.
A tough 1-0 loss in overtime at Georgetown
brought back memories of last season's start,
when Stanford lost four consecutive games (two
in overtime) to open the season.

But a return to the friendly confines of the
newly renovated Laird Q. Cagan Stadium on
Sept. 9 jump-started the Card's season with an
energetic 3-1 victory over then-No. 15 Kentucky.
After conceding another early goal, Stanford
fought back with a beautiful header from soph
omore midfielder JJ Koval off a well-struck cor
ner kick by junior Eric Anderson it was the
rising star Koval's first career goal. Minutes
later, it was deja vu as Anderson bent another
free kick into the box and this time, junior for
ward Adam Jahn rose up and sent it into the
back of the net for a 2-1 lead.
Junior Dersu Abolfathi capped the scoring
five minutes into the second half as he slotted
the ball past Kentucky's keeper on a wonderful
pass from freshman Zach Batteer. The rout was
complete.
But two days later against Lehigh, Stanford
couldn't capitalize on any of its scoring chances
and fell to 1-4 with a 1-0 loss to the Mountain
Hawks.
On Saturday, Stanford appeared to have
found the right recipe for success at home
against the University of San Francisco, as the
Card came out on the attack from the start with
six first-half shots. Senior Alexander Binnie
came on as a substitute and gave Stanford the
lead with his first career goal in the 35th minute
after a nifty one-on-one with the keeper.
But the lead was short-lived, as Dons fresh
man forward Miguel Aguilar equalized just over
a minute later with a brilliant goal, turning and
cracking a 30-yard rocket just over the out
stretched arms of sophomore goalie Drew
Hutchins and just under the crossbar.

But Stanford continued to press, and mid
fielder Garrett Gunther's hustle forced a
turnover in the offensive third. The redshirt sen
ior pounced on it for his first goal of the season.
San Francisco refused to quit and actually
started to turn the tide against Stanford with re
peated shots testing Hutchins. Another long
ball finally found a gap in the defense, and a
USF forward put away an easy chance right in
front of goal to level the score at two in the 66th
minute.
From there, the game turned very chippy, as
USF racked up foul after foul and an astounding
seven yellow cards in the final 60 minutes. A par
ticularly egregious tackle drew a red card in the
72nd minute on the Dons' Kevin Orozco, and
Stanford appeared to have the edge as USF had
to play down a man. Jahn almost scored on a free
kick and freshman forward Zach Batteer nar
rowly missed some chances as the game headed
to overtime.
But neither side could capitalize. That was
particularly frustrating for the Cardinal, which
was up a man for almost 50 minutes and up two
men in the final minutes after yet another red
card was issued to the Dons.
Stanford will need to find a spark as Pac-12
play approaches if it hopes to make the NCAA
Tournament. Next up for the Card is the Stan
ford Nike Classic this weekend, in which it bat
tles Flarvard on Friday night and Vermont on
Sunday afternoon. Both games will be played at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.

started to turn the tide against Stanford with re
peated shots testing Hutchins. Another long
ball finally found a gap in the defense, and a
USF forward put away an easy chance right in
front of goal to level the score at two in the 66th
minute.
From there, the game turned very chippy, as
USF racked up foul after foul and an astounding
seven yellow cards in the final 60 minutes. A par
ticularly egregious tackle drew a red card in the
72nd minute on the Dons' Kevin Orozco, and
Stanford appeared to have the edge as USF had
to play down a man. Jahn almost scored on a free
kick and freshman forward Zach Batteer nar
rowly missed some chances as the game headed
to overtime.
But neither side could capitalize. That was
particularly frustrating for the Cardinal, which
was up a man for almost 50 minutes and up two
men in the final minutes after yet another red
card was issued to the Dons.
Stanford will need to find a spark as Pac-12
play approaches if it hopes to make the NCAA
Tournament. Next up for the Card is the Stan
ford Nike Classic this weekend, in which it bat
tles Flarvard on Friday night and Vermont on
Sunday afternoon. Both games will be played at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
