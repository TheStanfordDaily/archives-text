# WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Sophomore duo has Stanford dreaming big 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
As most students enjoyed the
dwindling days of summer vaca
tion, the No. 2 Stanford women's
volleyball team spent the past
three weeks competing against
several of the nation's premier pro
grams and kicking off the inaugu
ral season of Pac-12 play in fine
form. After a perfect preseason
including marquee wins over a pair
of four-time defending national
champions, No. 5 Penn State and
No. 6 Florida the Cardinal (8-1,
2-1 Pac-12) has fallen only to top
ranked California in a tough road
matchup.
Stanford began the 2011 season
in Houston at the Rice Nike Invita
tional, winning in straight sets over
Delaware and Rice. Junior setter
Karissa Cook was named the tour
nament's MVP following her dou
ble-double (32 assists, 10 digs) in
the final, and sophomores Rachel
Williams and Carly Wopat
emerged as the team's offensive
targets, both earning all-tourna
ment honors.

Next, the Card returned to
Maples Pavilion for its first four
home matches of the season. Host
ing two tournaments, the Card
bested Notre Dame and Duke in
the Stanford Invitational and fol
lowed that up with key non-confer
ence wins over Penn State and
Florida in the Nike Volleyball Big
Four Classic. The four-set victory
over the Nittany Lions (7-3), whose
109-match winning streak the Car
dinal ended at the same tourna
ment last year, gives Stanford a 7-6
edge in the overall series between
the two perennial national-title
contenders.
The next night, after giving up a
two-set lead, Stanford fought back
and prevailed in a tight 15-13 fifth
set over the Gators (8-2) to win the
Classic Williams was named
MVP of both tournaments on the

Farm.
With just a few days to recover,
Stanford lost its first match of the
season to Bay Area rival Cal (13-0,
3-0) on Sept. 13. After narrowly
winning the first set (25-23), the
Card dropped three straight, hit
ting a season-low .103 on the night.
Stanford rebounded the next
weekend back at home, sweeping
new conference opponents Utah
(6-5, 1-1) and Colorado (5-6, 0-3)
and leaving the Card in a three
way tie for third in the conference
standings.
This weekend, Stanford will
face two familiar conference foes
in No. 7 UCLA (9-2,2-1) and No.
12 USC (7-3,2-1) in what could be
its toughest weekend of the season.
Last fall, the Bruins ended the Car
dinal's undefeated streak with a
heartbreaking five-set loss in Los
Angeles. Coming off a loss at No. 4
Washington last weekend, UCLA
— led by returning All-Pac-10
honorees, junior outside hitter
Rachael Kidder and senior libero
Lainey Gera — will be looking to
bounce back with a win against the
Card.

A unanimous preseason pick by
the Pac-12 coaches to win the con
ference and the preseason No. 2 in
the AVCA poll, USC has struggled
to live up to expectations this Sep
tember, suffering sweeps to UCF
and UCLA. However, the veteran
team features seven returners from
the 2010 squad that finished third
in the nation, including three All-
American seniors in outside hitter
Alex Jupiter, setter Kendall Bate
man and middle blocker Lauren
Williams, as well as the 2010 Pacific
Region Freshman of the Year, out
side hitter Falyn Fonoimoana.
The Cardinal and coach John
Dunning will take on UCLA in
Los Angeles at 7 p.m. on Friday,
Sept. 23.

Sophomore Mary Ellen Luck (above) had five digs as a defensive specialist
in Stanford's win over Colorado on Saturday. Led by junior setter Karissa
Cook and the sophomore pairing of Carly Wopat and Rachel Williams, the
No. 2 Card have been an offensive power en route to eight early wins.
