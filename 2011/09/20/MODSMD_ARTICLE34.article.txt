## Linebacker Skov to miss rest of season with knee injury 
### â€” Miles Bennett-Smith 
Heisman candidate Andrew
Luck had the Cardinal offense
humming in the second half of Sat
urday's 37-10 win over Arizona,
racking up 325 yards through the
air with two touchdowns as Stan
ford (3-0) turned what was a close
game into a blowout. Pollsters
took notice, bumping the Card up
to No. 5 in the national rankings.
But Stanford's title hopes
might have actually been dealt a
serious blow. Despite the win,
news came out Monday that junior
middle linebacker Shayne Skov
would miss the rest of the season
with a serious knee injury sus
tained in the second quarter of
Saturday's game. Skov went in for
a tackle and appeared to have his
leg pinned awkwardly beneath
him as he fell.
Head coach David Shaw an
nounced the loss of Stanford's
leading tackier of 2010 in a pre
pared statement, but no coaches or
players were available for com
ment.

"It's a big loss for our football
team," Shaw said. "But we have
great leadership on defense from
players such as Michael Thomas,
Delano Howell and Chase
Thomas. We've also recruited very
well recently, and now it is time for
guys to step up."
Among the likely candidates to
replace Skov are redshirt sopho
more Jarek Lancaster (who took
the bulk of the snaps after Skov
left), sophomore Blake Lueders
and highly touted freshman James
Vaughters.

Stanford's coaches will be able
to take advantage of the bye week
to evaluate the players, and the
Cardinal's depth will be put to the
test Oct. 1 when it takes on UCLA
at home.

leading tackier and has been the heart of a stout Cardinal run defense.
