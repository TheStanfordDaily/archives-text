Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
University of Chicago and University of

Beyond an increase in ties among the
top 10 universities, the list saw little
change from the previous year. This year
saw a large drop in the number of col
lege presidents participating in the peer
evaluation portion of the rankings, a
major component of the ranking's
methodology, according to an Inside
Higher Ed report. Only 43 percent of
presidents responded to the survey,
down five percent from last year.
