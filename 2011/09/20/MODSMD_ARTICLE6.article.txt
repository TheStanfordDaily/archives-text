## BOSP to explore Middle East with Turkey seminar 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's first study-abroad venture in the
Middle East will be a three-week summer 2012
seminar in Istanbul, Turkey, according to
Robert Sinclair, director of the Bing Overseas
Study Program (BOSP).
The seminar, in which BOSP will partner
with Istanbul's Koc University, will be part of
the reinstated Bing Overseas Seminar pro
gram. A group of 12 to 15 undergraduates, led
by a faculty member who is an expert on
Turkey will take part in an intensive, on-site
course, according to Sinclair.
Student interest in a Middle East study
abroad option has been strong, and about half
of the students who pursue non-BOSP study
abroad options choose to go to the Middle
East.
"I've met many students on campus who

had interest in the re
gion but couldn't go be
cause not everyone has
the ability to make
their own way . . .
whether it's because of
safety concerns, finan
cial issues or travel
arrangements," said
Khaled Alshawi 'l3, a
former ASSU senator
who advocated for a
Stanford program in
the Middle East. "It's a
big area that we're
lacking in, especially
compared to other
top-tier universities."
Yet safety con
cerns and funding issues posed obstacles to es
tablishing a Bing program in the region. A sur
vey of 500 undergraduates ranked Egypt and
Israel as the top regions of interest, but instabil
ity in Egypt and the U.S. Department Travel
Warning on Israel ruled them out as potential
sites, according to Sinclair.

"During our planning stages, about 12 or 18
months ago, Turkey was our number one
choice for stability reasons, and it's only been
confirmed as a good choice by the events of the

year 2011," Sinclair said.
Samar Alqatari 'l4, an ASSU Senator who
ran on a platform of increasing global aware
ness and forging relationships with the Middle
East and the Arab world, believes the seminar
does not meet the interests of many students
who wanted a Middle East program.
Elliot Stoller 'l3, co-founder of the Ameri
can Middle Eastern Network for Dialogue at
Stanford (AMENDS), is one such student. He
will be spending his fall quarter in Jordan
through a Middlebury College program, after
taking an official leave of absence from Stan
ford.
"Istanbul is a bridge between the Middle
East and Europe," Stoller said. "Studying there
would be a great experience, but it wouldn't
allow for true Middle Eastern immersion."
The program, however, will strengthen
Stanford's "limited" offerings with regards
to the Middle East, according to Lina Khat-

Ib, manager of the
Program on Arab
Reform and Democ
racy at the Center for
Democracy, Devel
opment and the Rule
of Law (CDDRL).
"Stanford's aca
demic engagement
with the Middle East
is growing and this
[seminar] is definitely
a step in the right di
rection to put the Mid
dle East on the map
for the Stanford aca
demic community,"
Khatib said.
"Istanbul is a vi
brant and interesting city, and with the demo
cratic transitions happening in the Arab world
right now, I anticipate that there will be oppor
tunities for students to engage in other coun
tries in the region as well," she added.
The last program BOSP introduced was in
Cape Town, South Africa. After gauging stu
dent interest and the success of introductory
programs, a permanent program was intro-

duced in winter quarter 2009-10.
Similarly, the success of the seminar
in Istanbul will determine the estab
lishment of a more long-lasting pro
gram.
"Even if the seminar is not success
ful, there should be a move deeper in

the Middle East because a program in
the Arab world would meet the inter
ests of a different segment of the stu
dent body," Alshawi said.
The Istanbul seminar, along with
the four other seminars BOSP will in
troduce for summer 2012, will be offi
cially announced and open for under
graduate applications at the start of
fall quarter.
