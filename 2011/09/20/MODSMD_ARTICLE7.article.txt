## Experts weigh in on future of new Libya 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
After months of stalemate fighting, rebel forces
overran pro-Gaddafi forces in August's Battle of
Tripoli. With the defeat of Gaddafi loyalists, the
end of the military dictator's 42-year rule of Libya
is near. Despite the Transitional National Council
(TNC)'s eagerness to establish a functional gov
ernment, Libya's road to recovery from its author
itarian regime will be a rocky one, Stanford profes
sors say.
"It's too soon to tell, but I'm cautiously opti
mistic," said Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution and the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies (FSI). "It will de
pend on what comes after, whether a more decent
form of government emerges."
Hoover fellow Kori Schake, a specialist in na
tional security strategy, is also optimistic about
Libya's future. She praised the TNC's impressive

track record in creating an effec
tive, temporary government as well
as its response to humanitarian
needs.
"The new leadership of Libya is
making smart choices," Schake
said. "They have discouraged
reprisals. They've done a good job
in taking over cities and quickly
addressing infrastructural needs .
. . they did a terrific job in getting
aid rolling for medicine and
water."
While the TNC's efficiency as a
governing body during wartime
shows promise for its capacity to
function as a stable and fair gov
ernment, several factors hinder
the TNC's projected potential.
Among the challenges facing
the TNC is the absence of a united
body representing the interests of
Libya's numerous tribal groups.
Gaddafi's rule divided Libyan
leadership along tribal and re
gional lines. Without the cama
raderie of wartime rebellion, the
chance of civil war outbreak be
tween rebel factions is high.
"The TNC is making all the
right statements about inclusive -
ness," Schake said. "But it's really
hard to do in practice. For 40 years,
Libyan rule has been divided
among different parts of the coun
try . . . Even within Tripoli, the
military has not yet been under a
unified, complete authority."
In the wake of Gaddafi's defeat,
the diversity of tribal groups may
spark a "policy of vengeance," ac
cording to Diamond.
"It's a fluid and challenging
time," Diamond said. "The leaders
of the TNC are acutely aware in
principle that they need to build a
broad base of support, to create a
new and inclusive political-social
order, but whether they can com
pletely restrain the fiery impulse
for revenge among the tribes
it's unclear."
While civil war among the rebel
groups remains a looming possi
bility, the likelihood of immediate
conflict may be less likely than
some political scientists speculate,
other scholars say.
"There will be something of a
honeymoon period where the
TNC has a chance to get things
going," wrote James Fearon, pro
fessor of political science, in an

email to The Daily. "But serious
tensions may develop the longer it
takes to get to elections, as those
people and groups who fear that
they are farthest from the center
of transitional government may
increasingly worry about getting
shut out."
There is a time crunch-induced
pressure to establish a democracy
and to hold fair elections, a
process that will take at least two
years, Diamond said. However,
the transition from dictatorship to
democracy is a slow, arduous one.
"You're not going to go from
over 40 years of extreme ideologi
cal, controlling dictatorship to
democracy overnight," Diamond
added. "There needs to be dia
logue and consultation for the
drafting of a constitution. Maybe
in a few years, you'd have the rudi
ments of a democracy."
Schake emphasized the impor
tance of not rushing election im
plementation, especially before
political and civil rights have been
established.
"Elections aren't meaningful
until there is freedom of associa
tion and of press, the freedom to
form political parties," Schake
said.
While the TNC's projected
timeline sets the first elections to
be held in 22 months, the demo
cratic legitimacy of these elections
will be difficult to assess.
"We will see a somewhat fair
first election within the next two
years, probably sooner . . . fol
lowed by a government that will
almost inevitably prove disap
pointing to most Libyans because
expectations are usually impossi
bly high," Fearon said.
In spite of the numerous chal
lenges the TNC faces in establish
ing democracy in Libya, its
adamant refusal to accept foreign
aid is viewed positively by many of
the scholars interviewed for this
article as a testament of the na
tion's resolve to take initiative.
"Avoid the mistakes of Iraq ...
the United States' imposing pres
ence in shaping the emergence of
their democracy created a huge
crutch in their political legitima
cy," Diamond said. "If [Libya] has
domestic ownership and authority
of [its] emerging democratic
order, it would appear to be a
more legitimate and stable
democracy."
