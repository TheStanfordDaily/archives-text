## Black carbon is major climate change culprit 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Black carbon is the second leading cause of
global warming after carbon dioxide, according to
research by professor of civil and environmental
engineering Mark Jacobson.
Jacobson presented his research on black car
bon's effects on global warming at the Aug. 31
meeting of the American Chemical Society
(ACS), the world's largest scientific society.
Black carbon, commonly called soot, is partic
ulate matter pollution released from combustion
reactions in diesel engines, as well as burning bio

fuels and biomass. Though it lasts in the atmos
phere for a short amount of time, approximately
a week, compared to carbon dioxide's lifespan of
30 to 40 years, it is about a million times more ef
fective at trapping heat in the atmosphere, Jacob
son said.
"I estimate that black carbon is causing 15 to
20 percent of global warming," he said, estimating
that carbon dioxide is responsible for 40 percent,
and methane for 15 percent.
The study, funded primarily by the U.S. Envi
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) and partial
ly by the National Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA), has been used to analyze ways

to reduce Arctic ice melt. Recent reports have
shown that Arctic ice is at its lowest level since lev
els were first measured in 1972.
Due to its short, weeklong lifespan, curbing
emissions of black carbon would have an imme
diate impact on the global climate and is the most
effective way of quickly reducing Arctic ice melt,
Jacobson said.
Like many attempts to slow global climate
change, however, there remain significant hurdles
in getting international cooperation on reducing
black carbon emissions. The United States has
