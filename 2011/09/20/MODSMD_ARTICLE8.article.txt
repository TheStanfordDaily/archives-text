## Black carbon is major climate change culprit 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Black carbon is the second leading cause of
global warming after carbon dioxide, according to
research by professor of civil and environmental
engineering Mark Jacobson.
Jacobson presented his research on black car
bon's effects on global warming at the Aug. 31
meeting of the American Chemical Society
(ACS), the world's largest scientific society.
Black carbon, commonly called soot, is partic
ulate matter pollution released from combustion
reactions in diesel engines, as well as burning bio

fuels and biomass. Though it lasts in the atmos
phere for a short amount of time, approximately
a week, compared to carbon dioxide's lifespan of
30 to 40 years, it is about a million times more ef
fective at trapping heat in the atmosphere, Jacob
son said.
"I estimate that black carbon is causing 15 to
20 percent of global warming," he said, estimating
that carbon dioxide is responsible for 40 percent,
and methane for 15 percent.
The study, funded primarily by the U.S. Envi
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) and partial
ly by the National Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration (NASA), has been used to analyze ways

to reduce Arctic ice melt. Recent reports have
shown that Arctic ice is at its lowest level since lev
els were first measured in 1972.
Due to its short, weeklong lifespan, curbing
emissions of black carbon would have an imme
diate impact on the global climate and is the most
effective way of quickly reducing Arctic ice melt,
Jacobson said.
Like many attempts to slow global climate
change, however, there remain significant hurdles
in getting international cooperation on reducing
black carbon emissions. The United States has
taken steps to curb these types of
emissions, such as the Diesel Emis
sion Reduction Act, signed into law
by President Obama at the beginning
of this year.
The EPA's own analysis of money
spent on the Diesel Emissions Re
duction Act concluded that for every
$1 spent on curbing diesel emissions,
$l3 were saved through averting neg
ative environmental and health ef
fects.
However, Jacobson noted that
only about six percent of black-car
bon emissions come from the U.S.
Much of the world's emissions come
from developing countries, where
wood-burning stoves and heating sys
tems emit black carbon emissions and
regulatory standards on heavy equip
ment is much less stringent.
Donald Kennedy, professor of en
vironmental science, emeritus, and a
senior member of the Academic
Council, agreed that the major hurdle

is getting the international communi
ty on board with new regulations.
"There is a clear regulatory re
sponsibility domestically for the
problem of diesel emissions,"
Kennedy said. He noted, however,
that efforts to stem the problem are
getting international support.
"I don't think there's a lot of inter
national opposition to it, but getting
everybody to take the same position
on it would require a serious, treaty
making operation," Kennedy said.
In addition to the environmental
effects of black-carbon emissions,
there are also serious negative health
consequences.
"Biofuel health effects are about
eight times higher than [the effects of]
simple fossil fuels," Jacobson said.
This is due to the fact that much bio
fuel burning occurs in heavily popu
lated cities, where people are more
concentrated and more likely to
breathe in air of poor quality.
It is estimated that 25 to 35 percent
of global black-carbon emissions
come from China and India.
