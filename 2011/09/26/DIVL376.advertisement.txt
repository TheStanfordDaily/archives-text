Women Poets of Iran, 1797—1967
COMPLIT 118 • DOMINIC BROOKSHAW
3-5 UNITS • MW 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM • GER:DB-HUM
This course traces the emergence of a female voice in Persian poetry and prose writing in the
19th and 20th centuries and, although focused on women's poetry, it will also explore the
contribution of women to the wider Iranian literary scene during this period, one of the most
turbulent of modern Iranian history. Starting at the dawn of the 19th century, this course will
first examine the existing, indigenous tradition of women's poetry in Qajar Iran, in particular
that of the Fath-~Ali Shah period (1797-1834). The focus of the course will then shift to the
emergence of liberalist, modernist, and proto-feminist poets and writers in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, moving to women poets' subsequent reconfiguration of (and ultimate
break with) classical poetic forms. The course will culminate in an in-depth discussion of
the iconoclastic and disruptive figures of Simin Behbahani (b. 1927) and Forugh Farrokhzad
(1935-1967), key figures in the development of Persian poetry in the late 20th century.
States of Nature in Literature
and Philosophy
COMPLIT 156A • KATHRYN HUME
3-5 UNITS • MW 1:15 - 2:30 PM
The state of nature, a hypothetical condition of human existence before the establishment
of societies, is a device many early modern thinkers use to address questions about ethics,
justice, and politics. Fusing biblical narrative and geometric reasoning, accounts of the
state of nature illustrate the overlap and tension between religion, science and philosophy.
Questions include whether philosophers and artists actually believe in the state of nature,
how it was imagined differently in poetry, the novel, and philosophy, whether it was used to
legitimize or undermine existing political structures, and why it is relevant in today's society.
Selected readings from Hobbes, Locke, Milton, Defoe, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Diderot.

historiography and analysis of these materials. Our questions will range from "what defined
Italian fascism?" to "how did artistic and cultural production function under Mussolini, and
what do we need to know in order to decipher it in context?", and beyond that, to "how has
fascist-era cultural production been appropriated, disavowed, and otherwise (mis)understood
in the decades since the end of fascism?" Materials will include works (in Italian) by Silone,
Gramsci, Moravia, Carlo Levi, Rosetta Loy, and Antonio Pennacchi, as well as secondary
sources (in Italian and English) by Emilio Gentile, RJ.B. Bosworth, Schnapp, Stone, Ben-Ghiat,

In this seminar we will examine several aspects of cultural life under Italian fascism, both in
terms of primary materials (literary, cinematic, and architectural), and with respect to the rich
historiography and analysis of these materials. Our questions will range from "what defined
Italian fascism?" to "how did artistic and cultural production function under Mussolini, and
what do we need to know in order to decipher it in context?", and beyond that, to "how has
fascist-era cultural production been appropriated, disavowed, and otherwise (mis)understood
in the decades since the end of fascism?" Materials will include works (in Italian) by Silone,
Gramsci, Moravia, Carlo Levi, Rosetta Loy, and Antonio Pennacchi, as well as secondary
sources (in Italian and English) by Emilio Gentile, RJ.B. Bosworth, Schnapp, Stone, Ben-Ghiat,

Women Poets of Iran, 1797—1967
COMPLIT 118 • DOMINIC BROOKSHAW
3-5 UNITS • MW 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM • GER:DB-HUM
This course traces the emergence of a female voice in Persian poetry and prose writing in the
19th and 20th centuries and, although focused on women's poetry, it will also explore the
contribution of women to the wider Iranian literary scene during this period, one of the most
turbulent of modern Iranian history. Starting at the dawn of the 19th century, this course will
first examine the existing, indigenous tradition of women's poetry in Qajar Iran, in particular
that of the Fath-~Ali Shah period (1797-1834). The focus of the course will then shift to the
emergence of liberalist, modernist, and proto-feminist poets and writers in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, moving to women poets' subsequent reconfiguration of (and ultimate
break with) classical poetic forms. The course will culminate in an in-depth discussion of
the iconoclastic and disruptive figures of Simin Behbahani (b. 1927) and Forugh Farrokhzad
(1935-1967), key figures in the development of Persian poetry in the late 20th century.
States of Nature in Literature
and Philosophy
COMPLIT 156A • KATHRYN HUME
3-5 UNITS • MW 1:15 - 2:30 PM
The state of nature, a hypothetical condition of human existence before the establishment
of societies, is a device many early modern thinkers use to address questions about ethics,
justice, and politics. Fusing biblical narrative and geometric reasoning, accounts of the
state of nature illustrate the overlap and tension between religion, science and philosophy.
Questions include whether philosophers and artists actually believe in the state of nature,
how it was imagined differently in poetry, the novel, and philosophy, whether it was used to
legitimize or undermine existing political structures, and why it is relevant in today's society.
Selected readings from Hobbes, Locke, Milton, Defoe, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Diderot.
