ENGLISH 36N: Lord Byron: Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know
We will explore the poetry, literary legacy, and significance of Lord Byron, a towering figure of European Romanticism.
Emphasis will be placed on formal, aesthetic, and stylistic elements of the poetry, with additional topics to include modern
celebrity, literary marketplace, scandal, and romantic heroism. MW 2:15-3:45pm (Rovee)
ENGLISH 150P: Going Long on the Short Poem
By investigating the smallest unit that can still be called "poem", we will test the concept of "poem" as such, asking what
only a poem can do, what the point of a poem is. Why have great artists long chosen "to go long on" " to invest in " short,
small forms, when such artists could, just as well, make something impressively big. TTh 9-10:50 am (Putnam)
ENGLISH 185F: Graphic Non-Fiction
By reading journalism, biography, history, literary essay and memoir in graphic formats, we'll examine the results when
serious artists and writers, often in collaboration, visually reinvent a genre. Sourced from the real world, the narratives we'll
examine will have a power of human experience and historical significance that no fantasy or superhero character could
ever hope to convey. MW 1:15-3:05pm (Johnson)

A close look at the current field of cognitive approaches to literary study, using both literary texts and key debates in

universal; and the symbolic unconscious; the blank slates. MW 2:15-4:ospm (Vermeule)
