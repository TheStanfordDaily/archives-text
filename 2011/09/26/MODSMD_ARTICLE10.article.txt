# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## When the terrorists win 
### Miles Unterreiner 
War, like Janus, has two
faces: the war we see and
the war within us caused
by what we see. Ten years this
month into the war on terror, we are
winning the former, but at the cost
of the latter winning, in other
words, the physical battle but losing
the fight for our hearts and minds.
The good news: it is not too late to
turn the tides of war. The bad news:
it will be soon. Let me explain.
Osama bin Laden, the grand ar
chitect of the Sept. 11 attacks, is
dead, and justly so. His henchmen
are scattered and in disarray. We
have not suffered a terrorist attack
of large scale since A1 Qaeda's
deadly strike 10 years ago. Are we
safer, stronger and more powerful
than we were on Sept. 10,2001? Per
haps. But we are also undeniably
and disturbingly a bit less Amer
ican. We have become less like our
selves — open, tolerant and fear
less and more like our enemies

— narrow-minded, parochial and
afraid. In seeking to kill us, the ter
rorists have failed. In seeking to
change us for the worse, they are
slowly succeeding.
The proof of our enemies' quiet
victory is all around us, and
nowhere is that creeping victory
more obvious than in the words of
those who most loudly proclaim

their opposition to it.
When we become who they want
us to become to use a hackneyed
phrase I hereby promise never to
use again the terrorists win. The
terrorists win when major Republi
can politicians launch a campaign
to derail the construction of a Mus
lim community center in New York,
because the terrorists have proven
that we are who they say we are: a
nation at war with Islam, not terror.
The terrorists win when state gov
ernments amend their constitutions
to explicitly ban sharia law, because
they have proven that we have no
faith in the strength of our judiciary.
The terrorists win when Terry Jones
burns a Koran, because they have
succeeded in turning people of dif
ferent faiths against one another in
anger in a country that has always
prided itself on religious freedom
and acceptance. The terrorists win
when American pundits and politi
cians call Islam a religion of hate,
because that is precisely what they
want Islam to become. The terror
ists win every time you look
askance at the guy wearing a turban
on your airplane, because they have
caused us to fear, rather than trust,
one another. And the terrorists win
every time the nation they are at-

I don't think many
ofus want to rush
through our lives
like the present
moment means
nothing.
