# Why NSO is a breeding ground for awkward turtles
## 
### FRESHMAN '15 
Allow me to introduce myself:
my name is Bianca Chavez,
and I am "That Freshman."
You know, the one that upperclass
men can see from miles away, even
before they notice my inappropriate
choice of footwear. (Tip: wearing
high heels to class is not cute, unless
your version of cute involves getting
stuck in the grass as you hobble
painfully for 25 minutes). I'm the
one who buys all of her books from
the Stanford Bookstore. I'm the one
who needs a map in order to locate
the Quad and will still probably
need to ask for directions at least
once. I'm the one who still thinks
Stern Dining is good.
Basically, I know nothing about

life in college, except for one thing: it
can be horrifically awkward. Over
the last six days, my fellow frosh and
I have been forced to endure hun
dreds of handshakes, thousands of
introductions and countless "ice
breaker" games that completely fail
at breaking the ice, (Learning some
one's favorite food, Steve Carell
centric movie and adjective that be
gins with the letter D' does not
make me feel more comfortable
around him; rather, I usually just
want to fight after hearing he didn't
like "Crazy, Stupid Love").

But a million lame introductions
pale in comparison to enduring the
awk-fest that was "The Real World:
Stanford." What's more fun than lis

tening to the horrors of sexually
transmitted infections, date rape, al
cohol poisoning and assault for two
hours? Oh that's right, being forced
to discuss the horrors of sexually
transmitted infections, date rape, al
cohol poisoning and assault with 30
bros in my hall (I see you, Twain!).
Even though watching "The Real
World" made me want to crawl

under a chair and die, it was not the
most uncomfortable part of NSO. I
believe that honor goes to Satur
day's New Student Party which
my RA Akshay appropriately
dubbed "The Awkward Freshman
Party." Where I come from (Bum-
Fuck Nowhere, California), dances
are magical events where hundreds
of students sweat, gyrate and hook
up in the school gym while listening
to the musical stylings of Wiz Khali
fa. Kids at my high school would call
you a nun if you weren't bent over on
the dance floor. So imagine my sur
prise when I walked into the Arrilla
ga Alumni Center and saw, not hun
dreds of sweaty bodies moving in
unison, but... board games. And in

stead of baby making, people were
standing around in awkward, single
sex circles. (Apparently privileged
white boys can't dance. Who knew?)
Besides the fact that I no longer had
Rachel Berry bangs, I felt like I had
returned to Thomas Jefferson Mid
dle School.

So it's safe to say that NSO may
have been more than a wee bit awk
ward, but it has also turned out to be
one of the most exciting weeks of
my life. However, the parts that ex
cited me most weren't the lectures
given by distinguished members of
the University or the performances
by talented student groups or the


Bianca
Chavez
parties. They were the nights I
stayed up 'til 4:30 a.m. talking to the
kids in my hall, the times I had con
versations deeper than "So what's
your major?" the times I formed
bonds that I knew would last. And
there is no doubt that I will need to
rely on these bonds many times
over the next four years. I mean,
what could be scarier than living in
a space the size of a matchbox with
a complete stranger? Or your first
set of midterms? Or being forced to
use communal bathrooms that
smell perpetually of mildew and
burnt hair? Or that mysterious
gray meat and vegetable stew in
Stern Dining? Join me as I find out.

Are you a privileged white boy who
can get low? Email Bianca at
blchavez@stanford.edu or she may
never believe your kind actually ex
ists.
