The best of the rest...
Your Sister's Sister
Set in the idyllic Pacific Northwest, writer-di
rector Lynn Shelton's latest feature (and one of
my personal festival favorites) "Your Sister's
Sister" is a humorous and witty take on the
nuances of friend and family relationships. At
the behest of his best friend Iris (Emily Blunt),
A1 (Mark Duplass) ventures off to her family's
cabin for some quality alone time in the
woods to try to come to terms with his broth

er's death a year earlier. But instead of peaceful
isolation, he finds Iris' sister Hannah (Rose
marie DeWitt), who has taken refuge there in
order to nurse a bad breakup with a bottle of
tequila. What begins as an innocent night of
drinking and commiserating eventually ends
with them waking up together when, lo and
behold, Iris arrives in the morning bearing
groceries. The next several days unfold in a
tangled web of emotions as both Hannah and
Al, for their own reasons, try to hide their tryst
from Iris, while Iris begins to think her feel-

ings for A1 have evolved from being just
friends. Needless to say, all relationships are
put to the test. Under Shelton's writing and di
rection, the interplay between the trio has a
raw and unscripted feel, but less in a reality
television way and more like the audience is a
ghost in the house experiencing the drama in
real time. The intimacy and verisimilitude are
all a part of the film's charm. While the scope
of the story may be slightly limited, the intri
cacies of the characters will draw you in and
leave you wanting more.

Juan of the Dead
Capitalizing upon the success of recent zom
bie comedies, Alejandro Brugues' "Juan of the
Dead" follows a group of unlikely heroes as
they cope with the destruction of their home
town, Havana, at the hands of an undead out
break. A hilariously violent action flick that
doesn't quite outdo its British predecessor
(2004's "Shaun of the Dead" from director
Edgar Wright), Brugues' Cuban-set story is
nonetheless a refreshing and thinly veiled po
litical allegory. Juan (Alexis Diaz de Villegas)
and his best friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina) are
two average slackers engaging in their favorite
pastime, drinking rum on the roof of their
tenement while spying on those below and in
adjacent buildings, when they begin to notice
people behaving a bit strangely. Cuban news-

casters calmly inform the public that it is
merely an issue of social dissidents paid off by
the American government, but after seeing
one up close, the two friends quickly realize

that the city has a much bigger problem on its
hands. Holing up on their roof, the two are
soon joined by Lazaro's brawny son and Juan's
estranged daughter, the neighborhood's
