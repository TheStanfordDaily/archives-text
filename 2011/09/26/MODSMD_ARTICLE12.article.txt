The best of the rest...
Your Sister's Sister
Set in the idyllic Pacific Northwest, writer-di
rector Lynn Shelton's latest feature (and one of
my personal festival favorites) "Your Sister's
Sister" is a humorous and witty take on the
nuances of friend and family relationships. At
the behest of his best friend Iris (Emily Blunt),
A1 (Mark Duplass) ventures off to her family's
cabin for some quality alone time in the
woods to try to come to terms with his broth

er's death a year earlier. But instead of peaceful
isolation, he finds Iris' sister Hannah (Rose
marie DeWitt), who has taken refuge there in
order to nurse a bad breakup with a bottle of
tequila. What begins as an innocent night of
drinking and commiserating eventually ends
with them waking up together when, lo and
behold, Iris arrives in the morning bearing
groceries. The next several days unfold in a
tangled web of emotions as both Hannah and
Al, for their own reasons, try to hide their tryst
from Iris, while Iris begins to think her feel-

ings for A1 have evolved from being just
friends. Needless to say, all relationships are
put to the test. Under Shelton's writing and di
rection, the interplay between the trio has a
raw and unscripted feel, but less in a reality
television way and more like the audience is a
ghost in the house experiencing the drama in
real time. The intimacy and verisimilitude are
all a part of the film's charm. While the scope
of the story may be slightly limited, the intri
cacies of the characters will draw you in and
leave you wanting more.

Juan of the Dead
Capitalizing upon the success of recent zom
bie comedies, Alejandro Brugues' "Juan of the
Dead" follows a group of unlikely heroes as
they cope with the destruction of their home
town, Havana, at the hands of an undead out
break. A hilariously violent action flick that
doesn't quite outdo its British predecessor
(2004's "Shaun of the Dead" from director
Edgar Wright), Brugues' Cuban-set story is
nonetheless a refreshing and thinly veiled po
litical allegory. Juan (Alexis Diaz de Villegas)
and his best friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina) are
two average slackers engaging in their favorite
pastime, drinking rum on the roof of their
tenement while spying on those below and in
adjacent buildings, when they begin to notice
people behaving a bit strangely. Cuban news-

casters calmly inform the public that it is
merely an issue of social dissidents paid off by
the American government, but after seeing
one up close, the two friends quickly realize

that the city has a much bigger problem on its
hands. Holing up on their roof, the two are
soon joined by Lazaro's brawny son and Juan's
estranged daughter, the neighborhood's

spunky transsexual. As the zombies
multiply, Juan, perpetually strapped
for cash, decides to milk the situation
for profit by charging civilians for
killing their undead loved ones.
Under Juan's leadership, the group
makes a decent killing; that is, until
Havana becomes completely overrun
and it seems as though his crew are
the only humans left. At this point,
Juan decides that maybe they ought
to just hightail it to Miami, but with
their city infested with zombies, it
might be too late to make a break for
it.
Intruders
Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, last
seen with 2007's "28 Weeks Later," is
back on the scene with "Intruders," a
thrilling supernatural tale that crawls
under your skin and toys with your
subconscious childhood fears. Mia
(Ella Purnell), a young English girl,
finds an unfinished short story hid
den in a tree outside her grandpar
ents' house and decides to appropri
ate it for a school assignment. Cut
ting between her experience and that
of the story's rightful author, a young
Spanish boy, the film explores the
power of the imagination. Despite
being separated by time and space, as
both children become increasingly
absorbed in the story, its protagonist
begins to haunts them in eerily simi
lar ways. At first it seems as though
the children are merely scaring them
selves by playing into their own
words, but with the more they write,
the stronger the monster becomes, to
the point that the children's parents
can see him too. "Intruders" blurs the
distinction between fantasy and reali
ty, and while certain elements may

not quite hold up after you leave the
theater, it is still thoroughly chilling.
Physical manifestations are less rele
vant, the film seems to suggest, when
the real culprits of fear and innova
tion are already present in the mind.

The Oranges
"The Oranges," fulian Farino's riotous
mix of romantic comedy and dys
functional family drama, is like the
anti-holiday movie that simultane
ously plays into and subverts the usual
conventions. In the suburbs of New
fersey (which inspired the film's title),
live-at-home college grad Vanessa

Walling (Alia Shawkat) recounts the
fateful holiday season that forever
changed her family and their best
friends and neighbors, the Ostroffs.
Vanessa and Nina Ostroff (Leighton
Meester) were once best friends, but
somewhere around adolescence, Nina
became pretty and popular while
Vanessa remained a gawky outsider.
Years later, Nina finally returns home

for Thanksgiving after a bad breakup
and instead of falling for Vanessa's
brother Toby (Adam Brody) like her
parents wish, she finds herself drawn
to David (Hugh Laurie), the Walling
patriarch. ("House" fans may or may
not be pleased to see the actors paired
up again.) When the affair goes public,
both families are thrown into an up
roar, culminating in one of the most
hilariously awkward Christmas Eves
ever recorded. The film flirts with the
age question in relationships, as Nina
and David face ceaseless judgment
from others, and despite their affec
tion for one another, the issue is ever
present like a dark cloud over their
heads. Without spoiling who ends up
with whom, the message remains that
sometimes it takes a scandal of epic
proportions to put things in perspec
tive.

The dud...

Sleeping Beauty
Emily Browning ("Sucker Punch")
takes on another misguided feminist
role in director Julia Leigh's haunting
debut "Sleeping Beauty," in which
she plays Lucy, a struggling universi
ty student who joins a sinister escort
agency in order to make ends meet.
After an initial meeting with Clara
(Rachael Blake), the manager of the
establishment, Lucy joins the lowest
ranks as a "silver-spoon waitress"
(read: serving drinks at private par
ties while wearing lingerie). Eager for
higher wages, Lucy is promoted to
sleeping with the clients; Clara puts
her in a drug-induced slumber for
the night, during which the client
can do what he pleases so long as
there is no penetration. After per
forming this duty several times,
Lucy, as any girl would, becomes cu
rious about what exactly happens
when she's asleep. Naturally, this
breaches the client's confidentiality
(Clara's only apparent moral scru
ple), so Lucy embarks on a mission
to uncover the truth. While the
premise is not so far from reality,
what with the growing trend of
young female students seeking sugar
daddies to pay off their debts, Lucy's
utter passivity does not make for a
very compelling story. No one in
"Sleeping Beauty" is particularly
sympathetic, and even the camera
seems to share in our indifference,
exploiting both the scantily clad
women and the creepy men who
hire them. If Lucy ultimately became
empowered by the experience in
some way or Clara and her clients
were punished, then perhaps the
narrative would feel less problemat
ic. But instead, the film lacks purpose
and feels more like an excuse to look
at Browning's nubile body.
