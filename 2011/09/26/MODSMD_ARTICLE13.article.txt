# Researchers develop light-responsive heart cells
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ellora Israni 
Stanford researchers announced
the development of heart cells that
can be paced with a light technology
known as "optogenics" in a study
published last week.
The researchers, including lead
author, postdoctoral scholar and
doctoral candidate in bioengineer
ing Oscar Abilez, described the ram
ifications of their invention in a press
release by the Schools of Medicine
and Engineering.
"In the near term ... the advance
will provide new insight into heart
function," the statement said. "In the
long term, however, the develop
ment could lead to an era of novel,

light-based pacemakers and geneti
cally matched tissue patches that re
place muscle damaged by a heart at
tack."

The researchers developed the
cells by inserting a light-sensitive
protein into human embryonic stem
cells. The protein controls the flow of
ions, especially sodium, in and out of
the cells and therefore manages
their pacing. When the protein is ex
posed to a special wavelength of
blue light, it opens channels in the
cell membrane to allow an influx of
sodium, creating a contraction.
Optogenics technology, which
can be used to control a variety of
mammal cells, was invented by Karl
Deisseroth, assistant professor in
bioengineering as well as psychiatry
and behavioral sciences.

The long-term goal of creating
light-based pacemakers resolves is
sues seen in today's devices.
"Pacemakers fail mechanically.
The electrodes can cause tissue dam
age," Abilez said.
"Defibrillators, on the other
hand, can produce tissue damage
due to the large electrical impulses
that are sometimes needed to re
store the heart's normal rhythm,"
said Ellen Kurl, senior author of the
study and professor of mechanical
engineering.

For example, researchers ex
plained the design behind a pace
maker that would not touch the
heart itself but instead control the
surrounding pericardium tissue.

"Instead of surgically implanting
a device that has electrodes poking
into the heart, we would inject these
engineered light-sensitive cells into
the faulty heart and pace them re
motely with light, possibly even from
outside of the heart," said Christo
pher Zarins, professor emeritus of
surgery and director of the lab
where the experiments were per
formed.
