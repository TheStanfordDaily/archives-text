# Stanford Hospital opens Brain Tumor Center

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Ellora Israni 
Last Wednesday marked the
opening of Stanford Hospital &
Clinics' Brain Tumor Center, an ini
tiative aimed at bringing specialized
and collaborative care to address
one of the hardest conditions to
treat, according to Gordon Li, one of
two specialists hired to supplement
the center's staff, and an acting pro
fessor in neurosurgery.
"The brain is a lot more mysteri
ous than the heart or lungs, and it's
who we are, what defines us," said
Lawrence Recht, professor of neu
rology and one of the center's
physicians, in a press release. "That
raises the impact of a brain-tumor

diagnosis."
"Tumors that originate in the
brain are still rare compared to
many other health conditions," he
continued. "So it makes a differ
ence if you are treated at a place
where they know what they're
doing. We have virtually every pos
sible discipline and specialty repre
sented here, with a large body of ac
cumulated experience. That can
make a big difference in results for
patients."
In accordance with these collabo
rative goals, the center will not be
housed in its own building but rather
will represent a conceptual con
glomeration of several departments,
including neuropathology, imaging,
neurosurgery, neurology and neuro
oncology. The program will also in
clude social workers and specialized
nurses.
In the press release, center direc
tor and professor of neurosurgery
Griffith Harsh said the project's goal
"is to give patients the highest quali
ty of care, delivered with a matching
level of efficiency."
Patients will also have access to
clinical trials and research at Stan
ford. This treatment-research part
nership has been instrumental in
producing the innovative care for
example, minimally invasive tumor
removal and imaging during surgery
which the press release advertises
as "cutting edge."
