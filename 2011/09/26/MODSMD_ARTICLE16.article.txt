Writer-director Dee Rees'
powerful debut "Pariah"
follows a Brooklyn teen
trying to come to terms with her sex
uality while dealing with her oppres
sive family as it teeters on the brink of
collapse. Partially inspired by Rees'
own personal experience coming out
as a young black woman, the film is a
contemporary coming-of-age story
that weaves together themes of iden
tity, love and acceptance.
Alike (Adepero Oduye), or Lee
as she prefers to be called, feels
trapped having to juggle her various
identities. A loner at school, Alike
chooses scribbling poetry in her note
book between classes over gossiping
with her peers, who openly refer to
her as an "AG" based on her baggy
jeans and hats that hide her hair. But
Alike's tomboyish demeanor (which
also includes a complete disinterest in
boys, school dances and "normal"
teenage-girl issues) greatly distresses
her mother Audrey (Kim Wayans),
who goes to great lengths to make her
elder daughter more like Candace
(Samike Cotton), Alike's girly
younger sister.
Audrey is mistrustful of Alike's
best friend Laura (Pernell Walker), an
out lesbian, and in an effort to sepa
rate the two, introduces Alike to Bina
(Aasha Davis), the daughter of a
coworker. Bina represents everything
that Audrey wants Alike to be, but lit
tle does she know that the girls' blos
soming friendship isn't strictly pla
tonic. As Audrey tries to exert more
control over her daughter, husband
Arthur (Charles Parnell) pushes back
in Alike's defense, even though his
long hours away from home mean
that he doesn't know his daughter
half as well as he thinks he does. As

Alike's double life converges and be
comes more open, it threatens to
drive a wedge through her parents' al
ready tenuous relationship.
Featuring an eclectic soundtrack
of indie, local and all-female artists,
music plays a crucial role as one of
Alike's escapes as well as something
that helps establish her relationship
with Bina. Combined with the inti
mate cinematography, "Pariah"
brings Brooklyn's Fort Greene neigh
borhood to life in a vibrant and au
thentic way.
Despite its outward appearance
as a niche story, the ability of "Pariah"
to resonate across broad audiences is
a true testament to Rees' storytelling
ability. I was fortunate enough to at
tend the gala screening (also attended
by Rees, Walker, Wayans and Oduye)
and ended up sitting next to a young,
black, lesbian couple. It's hard to say
who was more into it them or me,
the straight Asian girl from the West
Coast. But by the time the film ended
and the floor had opened up for
Q&A, the camaraderie in the audi
ence was almost tangible.
The film's biggest pleasure comes
from the setup and getting to know
its rich characters, especially the com
plex web of deceit that is Alike's day
to-day life. Moments like when Alike
changes out of her baggy jeans and
white t-shirt before going home be
come as puissant as when she reads
her poetry, the purest outlet for her
self-expression, out loud in class. The
story feels slightly rushed as it heads
toward its conclusion but nonetheless
is sure to stay with you long after the
credits roll.
