Last night, thousands of Stan
ford students enjoyed the
"Welcome Home Fest," which
drew students to many programs
across campus.
The first event was an 8 p.m.
concert in Memorial Auditorium by
The Cataracs, preceded by an open
ing set from Stanford-favorite Sex
Ray Vision (Ravi Parikh and Brian
Yoo '11). The duo took the stage for
the first hour of the show, hyping the
crowd up for the main attraction.
The Cataracs, a Bay Area DJ duo,
have produced radio hits including
"Backseat" and "Bass Down Low."
The pair took the stage in front of a
full house, performing their old work
as well as giving students previews of
their soon-to-be-released work.
The duo abruptly left the stage
after 40 minutes, only to be called
back by the chanting crowd to per
form "Like a G6" (they produced it
for Far East Movement), closing out
the night.
Arj unAggarwal'l3wasakey
event coordinator and thought the
concert was a hit with students.
"We just wanted people to show
up and have a good time ... I don't
think it could have gone any better,"
Aggarwal said. Plenty of students in
the crowd agreed.
"I thought The Cataracs were off
the hook," said Daniel Becerra 'l5. "It
was an awesome concert... I had a
great time."
Following the show, students
chose from several programs, includ
ing a comedy show featuring the
Stanford Robber Barons and Simps
as well as a FLiCKS doubleheader in
the Old Union Courtyard.
Though the events were put on
the New Student Orientation (NSO)
calendar, they were open to all Stan
ford students and many upperclass
men found something to enjoy.
Some looked for a more relaxed
atmosphere, like Lorena Rincon-Cruz
'l4, who stopped by the Ceramics
Raku Firing in White Plaza.
"I was impressed at the number

of options there were on the schedule
compared to last year," Rincon-Cruz
said. "It seemed like there was some
thing for everyone to do."
Other students, however, looked
for a party atmosphere at Tresidder
Union, where the traditional NSO
BROC Party, sponsored by the Black
Recruitment and Orientation Com
mittee, took place.
" [The party] was great," said
Community Coordinator Tayo Amos
'l4, who helped organize the party.
"We had a full house, and it was defi
nitely a good start to the year."
In all, students considered the
"Welcome Home Fest," which organ
izer Stephen Trusheim'l3 called a
"test run" of a new Stanford initiative
to bring more alcohol-free program
ming to campus, a success.
"I thought it was a great night..
. I hope we have more options like
these in the future," Rincon-Cruz
said.

"We just wanted
people to show up
and have a good
time...l don't think it
could have gone
any better."
