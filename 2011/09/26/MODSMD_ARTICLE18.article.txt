## OFF AND RUNNING Kroeger, Derrick lead sweep at Stanford Invitational 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With clear skies and temperatures
around 80 degrees, conditions were per
fect as the men's and women's cross
country teams opened their respective
seasons at home on Saturday morning
at the Stanford Invitational. With a little
help from All-Americans Chris Derrick
and Kathy Kroeger, both Cardinal
teams kicked off the year in style,
sweeping both the individual and team
titles.
It appeared as though the Cardinal
was in a bit of trouble in the men's race.
While the quartet of senior Derrick, fel
low senior Jacob Riley, sophomore Erik
Olson and redshirt junior Ben Johnson
were up front from start to finish, there
was a sizeable gap to the fifth Stanford
runner,Tyler Valdes, three miles into the
8-kilometer race.
UCLA looked to take advantage of
the schism, pushing the pace with its
own fivesome and holding a slight edge
over the Cardinal in what quickly
shaped up as a two-team race.
"Our original plan was to go out and
stay in a pretty close pack with the
whole team," Riley said. "But the race
went out pretty brisk, and it being the
first race for a lot of the freshmen and
also being at home made it a little more
difficult to do that."
Valdes, however, rose to the occasion
and moved through the field over the
final two miles, passing many runners
who couldn't keep up with the front
runners' quick pace. The redshirt soph
omore finished 17th in a personal-best
24:27, giving Stanford a 25-point victory
over the Bruins.
Riley was pleased with how the team
performed in its first race of the season,
particularly since head cross country
coach Jason Dunn held several Cardi
nal runners out in order to rest them for
next week's race at Notre Dame.
"Overall, it was a solid performance,
but by no means are we content," Riley
said after the race. "It was the first meet
of the season, and anything that hap
pens here isn't necessarily going to
make or break the year."
The highly anticipated debut of
freshmen twins Joe and Jim Rosa was a
success, with Joe finishing in 24:23 and
Jim in 24:52. And the back end of Stan
ford's lineup came on strong, with red
shirt sophomores Travis Edwards and
Kenny Krotzer crossing the line in 40th
and 51st places, respectively.
On the girls' side, junior All-Ameri
can Kroeger defended her individual
title on the relatively flat course in
20:07, one second off her winning time
from last year. She pulled away from
freshman Aisling Cuffe, who was mak
ing her collegiate debut for the Cardi
nal, in the final 800 meters. But the real
story might have been the sheer depth
on display for Stanford three fresh
men finished inside the top 16, and
coach PattiSue Plumer has six of her top
seven runners back from last year's
team.
Both squads are looking to improve
on their performances from the 2010
NCAA Championships inTerre Haute,
Ind., when the top-ranked men's team
slipped to fourth and the No. 7 women's

team fell to 13th.
This year, two-time defending
champions Oklahoma State returns
most of its top runners and will like
ly be the frontrunner throughout the
season, giving Stanford a chance to
fly a little more under the radar. But
expectations from the team are as
high as ever.
"Our goal is definitely to win a

national championship," Riley said.
"Other teams are going to be good,
and we need to focus on being as
strong as we can be as a team. But I
think we would be disappointed to
go home without a title."
The women will not travel to next
week's Notre Dame Invitational,
but both teams will be back in action
on Oct. 14 at the Wisconsin Invita
tional, which might be the country's
most competitive regular-season
meet of the year.
