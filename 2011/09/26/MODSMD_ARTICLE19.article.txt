and USC on the road. Wopat contributed 12 kills on .417 hitting
against UCA and chippped in 10 kills and 7 blocks against USC.
for a win against a veteran USC
squad (9-3, 4-1) that ended Stan
ford's season in last year's NCAA
tournament. Yet again, the bid fell
just short, as Stanford dropped
three straight sets, each by only two
points, 25-23, 26-24 and 25-23. The
loss marked the first time that the
Card had been swept since an away
loss to Washington in 2009.
Again, Williams proved to be the
Card's primary offensive threat as
well as an asset on defense, putting
down 11 kills and digging 13 balls
for her seventh double-double of
the season. Wopat had 10 kills and
seven blocks, while redshirt fresh
man outside hitter Lydia Bai added
seven kills. Cook had 37 assists in
the loss, while Gilbert, in her first
start as libero, had 18 digs.
For the Trojans, senior outside

digs. Senior setter Kendall Bate
