## Construction begins on final SEQ building 
### JOSH HOYT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Construction began this summer on the
final building in the Science and Engineer
ing Quad (SEQ), which will house the bio
engineering and chemical engineering de
partments.
This building will be the fourth in the
SEQ, joining the Jerry Yang and Akiko Ya
mazaki Environment and Energy Building
(Y2E2) and the Jen-Hsun Huang School of
Engineering Center and the Center for
Nanoscale Science and Engineering. It is ex
pected to be completed in summer 2014 and
is currently called "Building 4."
According to the Stanford Department
of Project Management, the new building
will most closely resemble Y2E2.The ener
gy efficiency for the two buildings will be al
most identical. For example both will fea
ture solar technology and natural light.
Building 4 will connect with both Y2E2 and
the Center for Nanoscale Science and Engi
neering on its basement level.
The new building will focus on providing
collaborative laboratory space for two rela
tively new disciplines while creating unpar
alleled undergraduate laboratory facilities.
"The new building will have teaching
laboratories that are so far beyond what we
have now that it will really be wonderful for
undergraduates," said chemical engineering
professor Curtis Frank, chair of the faculty
committee devoted to the building's con
struction. "This will be the best teaching lab
oratory at the University."
While Frank is a faculty member in
chemical engineering, his primary research
is in materials sciences, and many other
members of his department have interdisci
plinary research. The layout of the SEQ and
Building 4 allows for this collaborative ap
proach to engineering.
"This building is right next door to Y2E2,
and there are a number of faculty, including
myself, that have ties to civil and environ
mental engineering," he said. "At the same
time, about a third of the faculty do very
similar research to that which goes on in bio-
engineering."
Frank confirmed that a donor
gave funds toward the naming
rights for Building 4 but is current
ly remaining anonymous. The yet
unnamed Building 4 is designed to
embody the Stanford Challenge, a
five-year plan articulating Stan
ford's commitment to grappling
with global problems.
The building will be a physical
manifestation of the leap in the
recognition for these two fairly
new disciplines. Currently, the 50-
year-old chemical engineering
program is spread among three
different facilities. Having a desig
nated home is important for estab
lishing larger undergraduate pro
grams, and the administration ex
pects dramatic growth in bioengi
neering.
Frank described much of the re
search facilities for current chemi
cal engineering students as having
been "carved out of a stock room
and a loading dock." Bioengineer
ing also sees a similar need for
space.
"Bioengineering has a very
small number of undergraduates,
but the expectation is that the un
dergraduate department is going
to be very large," Frank said. "Bio
engineering is going to be a major
attractor for the University."
