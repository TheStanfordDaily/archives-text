## Construction begins on final SEQ building 
### JOSH HOYT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Construction began this summer on the
final building in the Science and Engineer
ing Quad (SEQ), which will house the bio
engineering and chemical engineering de
partments.
This building will be the fourth in the
SEQ, joining the Jerry Yang and Akiko Ya
mazaki Environment and Energy Building
(Y2E2) and the Jen-Hsun Huang School of
Engineering Center and the Center for
Nanoscale Science and Engineering. It is ex
pected to be completed in summer 2014 and
is currently called "Building 4."
According to the Stanford Department
of Project Management, the new building
will most closely resemble Y2E2.The ener
gy efficiency for the two buildings will be al
most identical. For example both will fea
ture solar technology and natural light.
Building 4 will connect with both Y2E2 and
the Center for Nanoscale Science and Engi
neering on its basement level.
The new building will focus on providing
collaborative laboratory space for two rela
tively new disciplines while creating unpar
alleled undergraduate laboratory facilities.
"The new building will have teaching
laboratories that are so far beyond what we
have now that it will really be wonderful for
undergraduates," said chemical engineering
professor Curtis Frank, chair of the faculty
committee devoted to the building's con
struction. "This will be the best teaching lab
oratory at the University."
While Frank is a faculty member in
chemical engineering, his primary research
is in materials sciences, and many other
members of his department have interdisci
plinary research. The layout of the SEQ and
Building 4 allows for this collaborative ap
proach to engineering.
"This building is right next door to Y2E2,
and there are a number of faculty, including
myself, that have ties to civil and environ
mental engineering," he said. "At the same
time, about a third of the faculty do very
similar research to that which goes on in bio-
