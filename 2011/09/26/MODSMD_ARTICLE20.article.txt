# Key to title is balance
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Stanford football had a bye
this week, so "Stat on the
Back" is going to take a look
at the season so far.
Number of the season-to-date: 27
What it means: Stanford has al
lowed 27 points this season. No, not 27
points per game 27 total.That is the
fewest points allowed by any team in
the nation. Because the Cardinal has
played only three games while most
other teams have played four, Stan
ford is tied for fourth in scoring de
fense at nine points per game. But
there isn't a team in the country that
would quibble with holding oppo
nents to single digits on average.
Why it matters: Every team wants
to have a good defense, and every
team wants to stop its opponents from
scoring. Duh. But on a team with a
quarterback like Andrew Luck and
weapons all over the place on offense,
having a solid defense almost feels
like icing on the cake.
For Stanford to achieve its goals
this year (Pac-12 and national titles),
though, the Cardinal cannot just be
one-dimensional. The difference be
tween the 2009 and 2010 seasons was
the improvement of Stanford's de
fense, and the Cardinal cannot hope
to contend for any sort of title without
a stingy defense.
Of course, it's too early to know
how good the defense really is, and ob
viously losing Shayne Skov for the
year will hurt the team. But it is worth
noting that Stanford's three oppo
nents thus far (San Jose State, Duke
and Arizona) have all tallied season
lows in points and yards against the
Stanford defense. If this is a sign of
things to come, it will make the of
fense's job a lot easier, particularly in
upcoming meetings with USC, Ore
gon and Notre Dame.
Other notable numbers:
9: Speaking of that offense, Stan
ford is ninth in the country in scoring.
That makes the Cardinal one of only
two teams, along with Wisconsin, to
rank in the top 10 in scoring offense
and scoring defense. An interesting
note: the team that scores more points
than its opponent has won every game
this season. So this bodes well for
Stanford.
28: With that great offense, you'd
probably expect Luck to be the main
reason for the Cardinal's success. But
even with the best player in the nation
taking every meaningful offensive
snap, Stanford is only 28th in the coun
try in passing offense. Among the
"better" passing teams: Troy, Middle
Tennessee State, Bowling Green and
Duke. Yep, Duke.
What's wrong with the passing
game? Apart from a couple rare mis
cues from Luck, nothing. Stanford
isn't trying to be among the country's
leaders in passing. Head coach David
Shaw wants to see balance, and it's
tough to be much more balanced than
Stanford has been. The Cardinal has
run the ball 109 times, passed 92 times
and gotten at least 140 rushing yards
and 230 passing yards in every game.
That's tough to stop.
0: As stated before, Stanford's de
fense has played well. But through
three games, the Cardinal has come
up with exactly zero interceptions.
ITiat's right, Luck has thrown more
picks than Stanford's opponents. Only
five other teams have yet to pick off an
opponent: Akron, Kansas, Oregon
State, Rice and Utah State. Combined
record of those five against FBS
teams: 2-10.
There are two ways to look at this.
On the one hand, the defense has
been unable to come up with a
turnover in the secondary despite
playing two of its weakest opponents,
and eventually this lack of big-play
ability will come back to haunt the
Cardinal against better teams. On the
other hand, Stanford has been able to
play dominant defense without need
ing a game-changing interception to
stop teams, so eventually the bounces
will go the Cardinal's way.
In general, interceptions are not
really Stanford's game. The team re
lies more on its pass rush and forcing
opponents to throw underneath to
avoid big plays. Still, the 2010 Stanford
defense picked off 18 passes, which
was tied for 19th in the country and
second in the conference. At some
point this year, the Cardinal will likely

need a momentum changer, and it
will be interesting to see if someone
will step up and get it.
1: There are 22 undefeated teams
remaining, but only one in the Pac-12.
Yep, we're still in September, but
Stanford is the only Pac-12 team that
has not lost. At first glance, this might
look promising for Stanford's future,
but keep in mind that most of these
losses have come in nonconference
games. These losses hurt Stanford's
strength of schedule, which wasn't
necessarily high anyway. Stanford's
future is in its own hands, but you just
never know when a situation like
2004, when Auburn went undefeated
but was left out of the BCS National
Championship Game, will make
strength of schedule a big deal.

24: You probably know by now
that Stanford has won 11 straight
games. But the Cardinal hasn't just
won; it has dominated. In eight of the
past nine games, Stanford has won by
at least 24 points. In all eight of those
blowout wins, Stanford beat the
Vegas spread.
This streak could continue for the
next several weeks, as three of the
Cardinal's next four opponents
(UCLA, Colorado and Washington
State) were picked to be the three
worst teams in the conference in the
preseason media poll. The fourth,
Washington, lost 41-0 to Stanford at
home last year.
In other words, don't be surprised if
a month from today, Stanford's closest
game is still the 37-10 win over Arizona.

won't be surprised if a week from
today no one has emailed him about
his observations. Surprise him at jw

For Stanford to achieve its goals
this year (Pac-12 and national titles),
though, the Cardinal cannot just be
one-dimensional. The difference be
tween the 2009 and 2010 seasons was
the improvement of Stanford's de
fense, and the Cardinal cannot hope
to contend for any sort of title without
a stingy defense.
Of course, it's too early to know
how good the defense really is, and ob
viously losing Shayne Skov for the
year will hurt the team. But it is worth
noting that Stanford's three oppo
nents thus far (San Jose State, Duke
and Arizona) have all tallied season
lows in points and yards against the
Stanford defense. If this is a sign of
things to come, it will make the of
fense's job a lot easier, particularly in
upcoming meetings with USC, Ore
gon and Notre Dame.
Other notable numbers:
9: Speaking of that offense, Stan
ford is ninth in the country in scoring.
That makes the Cardinal one of only
two teams, along with Wisconsin, to
rank in the top 10 in scoring offense
and scoring defense. An interesting
note: the team that scores more points
than its opponent has won every game
this season. So this bodes well for
Stanford.
28: With that great offense, you'd
probably expect Luck to be the main
reason for the Cardinal's success. But
even with the best player in the nation
taking every meaningful offensive
snap, Stanford is only 28th in the coun
try in passing offense. Among the
"better" passing teams: Troy, Middle
Tennessee State, Bowling Green and
Duke. Yep, Duke.
What's wrong with the passing
game? Apart from a couple rare mis
cues from Luck, nothing. Stanford
isn't trying to be among the country's
leaders in passing. Head coach David
Shaw wants to see balance, and it's
tough to be much more balanced than
Stanford has been. The Cardinal has
run the ball 109 times, passed 92 times
and gotten at least 140 rushing yards
and 230 passing yards in every game.
That's tough to stop.
0: As stated before, Stanford's de
fense has played well. But through
three games, the Cardinal has come
up with exactly zero interceptions.
ITiat's right, Luck has thrown more
picks than Stanford's opponents. Only
five other teams have yet to pick off an
opponent: Akron, Kansas, Oregon
State, Rice and Utah State. Combined
record of those five against FBS
teams: 2-10.
There are two ways to look at this.
On the one hand, the defense has
been unable to come up with a
turnover in the secondary despite
playing two of its weakest opponents,
and eventually this lack of big-play
ability will come back to haunt the
Cardinal against better teams. On the
other hand, Stanford has been able to
play dominant defense without need
ing a game-changing interception to
stop teams, so eventually the bounces
will go the Cardinal's way.
In general, interceptions are not
really Stanford's game. The team re
lies more on its pass rush and forcing
opponents to throw underneath to
avoid big plays. Still, the 2010 Stanford
defense picked off 18 passes, which
was tied for 19th in the country and
second in the conference. At some
point this year, the Cardinal will likely

need a momentum changer, and it
will be interesting to see if someone
will step up and get it.
1: There are 22 undefeated teams
remaining, but only one in the Pac-12.
Yep, we're still in September, but
Stanford is the only Pac-12 team that
has not lost. At first glance, this might
look promising for Stanford's future,
but keep in mind that most of these
losses have come in nonconference
games. These losses hurt Stanford's
strength of schedule, which wasn't
necessarily high anyway. Stanford's
future is in its own hands, but you just
never know when a situation like
2004, when Auburn went undefeated
but was left out of the BCS National
Championship Game, will make
strength of schedule a big deal.

24: You probably know by now
that Stanford has won 11 straight
games. But the Cardinal hasn't just
won; it has dominated. In eight of the
past nine games, Stanford has won by
at least 24 points. In all eight of those
blowout wins, Stanford beat the
Vegas spread.
This streak could continue for the
next several weeks, as three of the
Cardinal's next four opponents
(UCLA, Colorado and Washington
State) were picked to be the three
worst teams in the conference in the
preseason media poll. The fourth,
Washington, lost 41-0 to Stanford at
home last year.
In other words, don't be surprised if
a month from today, Stanford's closest
game is still the 37-10 win over Arizona.

Always the pessimist, Jacob Jaffe
won't be surprised if a week from
today no one has emailed him about
his observations. Surprise him at jw

Stanford football had a bye
this week, so "Stat on the
Back" is going to take a look
at the season so far.
Number of the season-to-date: 27
What it means: Stanford has al
lowed 27 points this season. No, not 27
points per game 27 total.That is the
fewest points allowed by any team in
the nation. Because the Cardinal has
played only three games while most
other teams have played four, Stan
ford is tied for fourth in scoring de
fense at nine points per game. But
there isn't a team in the country that
would quibble with holding oppo
nents to single digits on average.
Why it matters: Every team wants
to have a good defense, and every
team wants to stop its opponents from
scoring. Duh. But on a team with a
quarterback like Andrew Luck and
weapons all over the place on offense,
having a solid defense almost feels
like icing on the cake.
For Stanford to achieve its goals

though, the Cardinal cannot just be
