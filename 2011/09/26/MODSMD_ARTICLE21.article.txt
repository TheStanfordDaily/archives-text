# CARD TROUNCES WEAK WILDCATS
## 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
Halfway through its season, the
Stanford women's soccer team is
looking primed for a championship
run, as they dominated a hapless
Arizona team at home in a 7-0 vic
tory Saturday night to improve to 9-
0-1 in the Pac-12 opener for both
teams.
Six Cardinal players chipped in
for seven goals, five of which came
in the second half. Sophomore goal
keeper Emily Oliver played 57 min
utes, did not face a single shot and
recorded the win.

The Stanford women came out
of the gate strong, attacking the
Wildcats and earning quality scor
ing chances. At 10:58, freshman for
ward Chioma Übogagu hit the post
with a shot, and sophomore forward
Sydney Payne volleyed in the re
bound to put Stanford on the board.
But the Card struggled for most
of the rest of the half to capitalize on
myriad opportunities. Übogagu,
Payne and senior midfielder Teresa
Noyola all had excellent chances
after the first tally but could not
convert.

Head coach Paul Ratcliffe then
made several substitutions and
tweaked his lineup to jumpstart the
offense just before halftime. The
new substitutes sparked the Cardi
nal attack almost immediately. Ju
nior forward Marjani Hing-Glover
sent Noyola ahead with a through
pass, and Noyola passed to sopho
more midfielder Taylor McCann
who fired past the Arizona goalie
from 12 yards to put Stanford up 2-0
with under a minute left in the half.
"We were having trouble break
ing through, and we looked a little
bit flat, so I thought we needed a bit
of change, and Taylor McCann went
in and she added that change to the
game and scored a great goal," Rat
cliffe said. "With the changes, I
thought the energy level went up,
and [we had] more creativity."
Stanford came out at the start of
the second half and put the game
away, scoring three times in a span
of six minutes.
Senior midfielder Kristy Zur

muhlen scored on a header from a
Taylor corner kick. Ratcliffe said
the team had been practicing sever
al set plays for corner kicks. Stan
ford nearly scored in the first half
on a pass to the short side from a
corner kick; on Zurmuhlen's goal,
the Cardinal set up for this play
again and drew two defenders out
of the box before punching it in.
Minutes later, redshirt freshman
defenseman Kendall Romine
scored her first career goal on a left
footed rocket from 30 yards out.
"I just saw the open space, and so
I took it, and when I hit the shot, I
was a little surprised that it went in
but really excited at the same time,"
Romine said. "It was just a great
feeling."
The Cardinal displayed excel
lent ball movement on its fifth goal,
as junior defenseman Alina Garcia
mendez passed down the sideline to
fellow junior defenseman Rachel
Quon. She crossed to Taylor, who
settled the ball and scored her sev
enth goal of the season.
"One thing that we are good at
as a team is knowing that we're
going to get the goals eventually,"
Taylor said. "The way we play is
possession-oriented, and we're able
to break teams down and get more
goals in the second half."
In the ensuing minutes, Ratcliffe
made nine substitutions no Car
dinal player was in the game for its
entire length. However, any notion
that the wholesale substitutions
would stop the flood of Stanford
goals was quickly put to rest.
Hing-Glover challenged the
Wildcat goaltender on a tipped ball,
maneuvered around her and drilled
the ball into the open net.
Less than two minutes later,
sophomore forward Shelby Payne
passed to Hing-Glover, who fired a
high volley that bounced off the
post and in. Hing-Glover had sever
al chances for a hat-trick, but could
not convert.

"Players came in off the bench
and were hungry to prove them
selves, and they did," Ratcliffe said.
A crowd of 1,756 packed Laird
Q. Cagan Stadium to watch Stan
ford's 41st consecutive home win.
The Cardinal travel northwest this
weekend to play Washington State
at 3 p.m. Friday and Washington at
12 p.m. Sunday.

In the ensuing minutes, Ratcliffe
made nine substitutions no Car
dinal player was in the game for its
entire length. However, any notion
that the wholesale substitutions
would stop the flood of Stanford
goals was quickly put to rest.
Hing-Glover challenged the
Wildcat goaltender on a tipped ball,
maneuvered around her and drilled
the ball into the open net.
Less than two minutes later,
sophomore forward Shelby Payne
passed to Hing-Glover, who fired a
high volley that bounced off the
post and in. Hing-Glover had sever
al chances for a hat-trick, but could
not convert.

"Players came in off the bench
and were hungry to prove them
selves, and they did," Ratcliffe said.
A crowd of 1,756 packed Laird
Q. Cagan Stadium to watch Stan
ford's 41st consecutive home win.
The Cardinal travel northwest this
weekend to play Washington State
at 3 p.m. Friday and Washington at
12 p.m. Sunday.
