# Three Books panel ends NSO
## Scott Sagan, political science, leads ethics of war discussion with Carter, Fick, Brooks 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
After a week of orientation activities,
Stanford freshmen took on this year's topic,
"ethics of war," Sunday afternoon at the an
nual Three Books panel discussion.
This year's books focused on issues of na
tional security. Scott Sagan, political science
professor and co-director of the Center for
International Security and Cooperation
(CISAC), who also moderated the discussion
in Memorial Auditorium, made the selections.
The class of 2015 was mailed copies of the
three books over the summer. Sunday's Q&A
with the authors marked the end of New Stu

dent Orientation.
The theme of this year's talk was "war
ethics," a particularly timely topic as the Fac
ulty Senate voted last April to end the 40-year
ban of ROTC on campus.
"The Violence of Peace: America's Wars in
the Age of Obama" by Yale Law School pro
fessor Stephen L. Carter '76 examines Presi
dent Barack Obama's views on the morality
of war; "One Bullet Away: The Making of a
Marine Officer" by former United States Ma
rine Corps Captain Nathaniel Fick chronicles
Fick's officer training, as well as his service
and adjustment to civilian life; and "March"
by Geraldine Brooks, the only piece of fiction
among the three, captures the untold story

from "Little Women" by imagining the Civil-
War experience of Mr. March and his wife,
Marmee.

Sagan introduced the three authors while
noting Stanford's goal of creating "cultured
and useful graduates" and his hope that the
class of 2015 will learn that "reasonable peo
ple can disagree."
Fick reflected on why he chose to become
a marine and the moral dilemmas he faced as
a leader. He, too, discussed the need for open
dialogue.
"It's not sufficient to say 'Oh, that's for
someone else, that's not for our kind of peo-

pie," he said.
"We can't simply watch things
happen and comment in the living
room," Carter said, expressing the
importance for citizens to question
their leaders.
Carter also discussed the deep
significance that the Sept. 11 attacks
have had for current college stu
dents.
Brooks warned against placing
too much glory on war and stressed,
along with the other speakers, that
there are "multiple forms of serv
ice."

The authors "gave an honest per
spective on what the military is lack
ing a discussion that some of my
country-mates are unwilling to
have," said Jack Cook 'l5, a member
of the incoming ROTC class.
Before the talk, Stanford Says
No to War set up a table outside
Memorial Auditorium and distrib
uted free copies of other books, in
cluding several titles by Noam
Chomsky and "War Is a Lie" by
David Swanson.
Josh Schott 'l4, president of the
student group, said he felt the Three
Books discussion presented "an
overly narrow point of view," and
the group hoped to offer students a
"broader perspective."
"We feel this has to coincide with
the bringing back of ROTC," Schott

said. "[The idea of] 'bridging the
civilian-military divide' actually
means trying to militarize our cam
pus."
U.S. Marine Corps Lance Corpo
ral Sebastain Gould 'l3 attended
the talk and reflected on Fick's
book, saying he wished he could
read more about Fick's adjustment
to civilian life.
"It's not as action oriented but as
integral a part of being a Marine of
ficer," Gould said. Gould enlisted in
the Marine Corps after his freshman
year at Stanford and served in Iraq.
He described the discussion as a val
ued "supplement to the lack of
ROTC on campus."
"I feared, I must admit, that hav
ing a challenging set of books...
would cause some students to

slack," Sagan said, remarking that
he and the panel were impressed by
the "quality and depth" of the stu
dent questions and touched by the
standing ovation.
Sagan said that Stanford previ
ously held a bias toward certain
types of service, but if ROTC ac
cepts Stanford's invitation to return
to campus, "all forms of national
service would be on equal footing."
However, not all freshmen are
convinced.
"I'm conflicted about ROTC be
cause they still do not let everyone
join, and they still have discrimina
tory policies," said Adrienne von
Schulthess 'l5.
