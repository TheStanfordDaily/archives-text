# Three Books panel ends NSO
## Scott Sagan, political science, leads ethics of war discussion with Carter, Fick, Brooks 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
After a week of orientation activities,
Stanford freshmen took on this year's topic,
"ethics of war," Sunday afternoon at the an
nual Three Books panel discussion.
This year's books focused on issues of na
tional security. Scott Sagan, political science
professor and co-director of the Center for
International Security and Cooperation
(CISAC), who also moderated the discussion

of war; "One Bullet Away: The Making of a
Marine Officer" by former United States Ma

Fick's officer training, as well as his service
and adjustment to civilian life; and "March"
by Geraldine Brooks, the only piece of fiction
among the three, captures the untold story

from "Little Women" by imagining the Civil-
War experience of Mr. March and his wife,
Marmee.

Sagan introduced the three authors while
noting Stanford's goal of creating "cultured
and useful graduates" and his hope that the
class of 2015 will learn that "reasonable peo
ple can disagree."
Fick reflected on why he chose to become
a marine and the moral dilemmas he faced as
a leader. He, too, discussed the need for open
dialogue.
"It's not sufficient to say 'Oh, that's for
someone else, that's not for our kind of peo-
