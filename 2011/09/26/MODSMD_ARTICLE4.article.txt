## McFaul tapped for Russian ambassador Special Assistant to the President McFaul appointed by Obama 
### ELLORA ISRANI DESK EDITOR 
President Obama recently nominated
Michael McFaul B. A., M. A. 'B6, political science
professor and senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI)
to the United States ambassadorship to Russia.
McFaul, who has served as special assistant
to the president on national security affairs, di
rector of Stanford's Center on Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law and senior di
rector for Russia and Eurasia at the National
Security Council, is an academic expert on the
transition to democracy in developing countries
including in Russia after the collapse of the
Soviet Union and has written over 20 books
on the subject.
After completing a dual bachelor's degree in
international relations and Slavic languages as
well as a master's in Slavic and East European
studies at Stanford, McFaul received a Rhodes
Scholarship for his Oxford doctorate in interna
tional relations. He has been studying U.S. rela
tions with the Soviet Union and subsequently
Russia ever since.
"This is one of the most important ambassa

dorial appointments in the entire realm of U.S.
foreign relations," said political science profes
sor Larry Diamond 8.A., M.A. '73, Ph.D. 'BO and
a colleague of McFaul's. "I think it's a great trib
ute to him his skill, his knowledge, his per
formance at the National Security Council
and the confidence that President Obama has in
him that he has been tapped for this very impor
tant position."
McFaul declined to comment until his am
bassadorship is confirmed.
McFaul has been affiliated with the Obama
administration since the 2008 presidential cam
paign when he advised the then-candidate

through the tension surrounding Russia's inva
sion of Georgia that summer.
"He is undoubtedly one of the best prepared
individuals to be ambassador to Russia, certain
ly in the post-Cold War history of America's re
lations with Russia and probably for several
decades," Diamond said. "He has been studying
post-Communist Russia since the collapse of
the Soviet Union ... I don't think anyone
would dispute the fact that he's probably one of
the top-three or four academic specialists on
Russia in the United States."

President Barack Obama was briefed by political science professor Michael McFaul (back, right) during
a 2009 trip to Moscow. McFaul was recently tapped to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia.
McFaul is also widely seen as the
architect of the Obama administra
tion's "reset" of U.S.-Russia rela
tions after a period of strain.
"In terms of his background for
the appointment, he is extremely
well prepared," said Stephen Kras
ner, professor of international rela
tions and a senior fellow at FSI. "He
spent a lot of time in Russia in the
1990s when Russia was transition
ing to democracy, and he has now
spent more than two and a half
years in Washington with the
Obama administration working on
Russian issues. So he has both gov
ernment experience in Washington
and academic experience."
However, critics have questions
about whether McFaul's "reset"
precedent is a solid foundation for
his ambassadorial duties.
"Any solution which would end
the continuing imbalance and tug
of war within Europe and would
bring the military and political po
tential of Russia within NATO
would impact greatly on the entire

global security situation," wrote
Gilbert Doctorow, a visiting scholar
at Columbia University's Harriman
Institute for Russian, Eurasian, and
Eastern European studies, in an
email to The Daily. "And none of
this potential has been tapped
under 'reset,' for which Dr. McFaul
is generally given paternity rights."
According to Diamond, Mc-
Faul's key role will involve balanc
ing two main concerns.
"On the one hand, [there is] the
need for the United States to have
an effective, pragmatic set of rela
tions with Russia that can continue
to bring it into the international
community and have it be a respon
sible player on global security is
sues, whether those be the Middle
East or arms control or wherever,"
Diamond said. "And on the other
hand, he will be playing a role in try
ing to advance American values
and principles and in trying to give
support and encouragement to a
variety of different political and so
cial forces in Russia that are trying
to extend constitutional rights, af
firm political pluralism and create a
more open society."
