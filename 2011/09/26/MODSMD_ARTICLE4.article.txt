## McFaul tapped for Russian ambassador Special Assistant to the President McFaul appointed by Obama 
### ELLORA ISRANI DESK EDITOR 
President Obama recently nominated
Michael McFaul B. A., M. A. 'B6, political science
professor and senior fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI)
to the United States ambassadorship to Russia.
McFaul, who has served as special assistant
to the president on national security affairs, di
rector of Stanford's Center on Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law and senior di
rector for Russia and Eurasia at the National
Security Council, is an academic expert on the
transition to democracy in developing countries
including in Russia after the collapse of the
Soviet Union and has written over 20 books
on the subject.
After completing a dual bachelor's degree in
international relations and Slavic languages as
well as a master's in Slavic and East European
studies at Stanford, McFaul received a Rhodes
Scholarship for his Oxford doctorate in interna
tional relations. He has been studying U.S. rela
tions with the Soviet Union and subsequently
Russia ever since.
"This is one of the most important ambassa

dorial appointments in the entire realm of U.S.
foreign relations," said political science profes
sor Larry Diamond 8.A., M.A. '73, Ph.D. 'BO and
a colleague of McFaul's. "I think it's a great trib
ute to him his skill, his knowledge, his per
formance at the National Security Council
and the confidence that President Obama has in
him that he has been tapped for this very impor
tant position."
McFaul declined to comment until his am
bassadorship is confirmed.
McFaul has been affiliated with the Obama
administration since the 2008 presidential cam
paign when he advised the then-candidate

through the tension surrounding Russia's inva
sion of Georgia that summer.
"He is undoubtedly one of the best prepared
individuals to be ambassador to Russia, certain
ly in the post-Cold War history of America's re
lations with Russia and probably for several
decades," Diamond said. "He has been studying
post-Communist Russia since the collapse of
the Soviet Union ... I don't think anyone
would dispute the fact that he's probably one of
the top-three or four academic specialists on
Russia in the United States."
