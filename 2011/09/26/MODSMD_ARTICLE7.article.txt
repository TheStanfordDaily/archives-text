## A 						STANDARD STANFORD SUMMER 
### SUZANNE STATHATOS DESK EDITOR 
As Stanford students return
to campus this fall,
there's one question on
their minds: what did you
do last summer? It's a
way to connect with others, to learn a
little more about their peers and to ex-

plore possible opportunities. Many Stanford stu
dents do not take the summer off they do not simply return
home to lounge on the couch and watch television, despite how
relaxing that may sound. Instead, students venture into un
charted waters, exploring new ways to add to their experiences
with internships, research and volunteering.

Alyssa London
'l2 interned this summer
in Microsoft's Worldwide

Partner Group
(WWPG) in Seattle.
Microsoft had always
intrigued her.
"I grew up in Bothell, right next
to the Microsoft campus," she said.
"I'm interested in tech, and Mi
crosoft always seemed like the pow
erhouse, the model of how things
started in tech innovation."
London worked in the WWPG
with a product called Share Point.
"Microsoft and other companies
structure their partner network in a
way such that partners can distin
guish themselves," London said.
Share Point is software designed
to help companies make better de
cisions by setting up websites to
share information, manage docu
ments and publish reports.
While working there, London
felt that she was an integral part of
the team.
"They entrusted me with a real
project," London said. "I did real
work. I got to contribute."
As a part of the team, London
lived the corporate life. She flew
down to Los Angeles to participate
in the Worldwide Partner Confer
ence, an experience complete with
rooftop parties, a trip to the ESPYs
and meetings with business part
ners.
"Microsoft went all out," she
said.
While London found it to be an
engaging internship experience, she
also wants to remain open to oppor
tunities with smaller businesses as
she begins her job search after col
lege.
Other students, like Michael
Diaz 'l3, chose to conduct research
at Stanford this summer. Diaz
served as a research assistant in the
HBREX program for Dr. David
Spiegel, professor of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences. He worked day
after day, practically never leaving
his desk in order to finish compos
ing a chapter about posttraumatic
growth in cancer patients for a psy
cho-oncology textbook.
Druthi Ghanta 'l4 also stayed in
the Bay Area. She worked as a re
search analyst for California Com
mon Sense (CACS), the Stanford
initiated think tank whose mission
is to improve government fiscal
transparency. CACS is in the midst
of building an online data trans
parency portal comprised of infor
mation from California counties
and officials. Through her experi
ence, Ghanta explored her new
found passion for computer science,
economics and public policy.
"Taking well-calculated risks to
follow my passions will give me
more fulfillment than taking the
safe ... routes," Ghanta said.
Others took advantage of what
Stanford had to offer. Kevin Hurl
butt 'l4 worked as a counselor with
children ages nine to 10 at Stanford
Sierra Camp (SSC). Despite suffer
ing a broken leg and sprained ankle,
Hurlbutt embraced his camp expe
rience.

"SSC provides an environment
in which the staffers are not only en
couraged but in fact required to be
creative," he said.
While at SSC, Hurlbutt acted in
an improvisation show, performed
in a puppet show, researched con
stellations and wrote an introducto
ry skit with the other counselors.
While Hurlbutt remains a
prospective chemistry major, he
now strives to explore more outlets
for the arts at Stanford.

Sarah Weston 'l4 chose to study
copies of William Blake's "Songs of
Innocence and Experience" abroad

using a grant from Undergraduate
Advising and Research (UAR).The
University, through UAR, funds
grants designed to support inde
pendent undergraduate research.
For two weeks, she conducted re
search at the British Museum in
London, the Library at King's Col
lege and the Fitzwilliam Museum at
Cambridge University, all while
learning the ins and outs of Eng
land.
Whether through interning, re
searching, counseling at camp or
going abroad, Stanford students
never failed to stay busy.
