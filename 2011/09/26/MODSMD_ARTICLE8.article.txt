## LETTER FROM THE EDITOR Safeguarding free press 
### KATHLEEN CHAYKOWSKI Editor in chief President, Vol CCXXXX 
It is with great pleasure that I
welcome you to the start of The
Daily's 240 th volume, which
marks our 38th year of publishing
independently and our 119 th year
in print.

Every day, our mission is to pro
vide you, the Stanford community,
with fair and accurate news and
stories that matter, whether you
find them in features, sports, opin
ions, or in our weekly arts and en
tertainment insert. Intermission.
We are also here to help educate
the young journalists on campus.
Over the upcoming months,
dozens of editors, writers, photog
raphers, graphics artists and busi
ness staffers will work behind the
scenes on a daily basis to assemble
the content that appears on these
pages. Our content is also available
digitally on our website, mobile
app,Facebook and Twitter.
The Daily's independent status is
something I've come to take very
seriously. After spending this past
summer reporting in Sub-Saharan
Africa, a region where the press is
not completely free, I have come to
see a liberalized press as a truly es
sential aspect of a humanitarian,
democratic society, and something
we should never take for granted.
I was working at an investigative
newspaper in South Africa, where
the government has a history of
censoring media. The walls of the
newsroom were covered with front
pages where headlines exposed
government corruption. Within
stories, quotes and the names of
sources were blacked out with ink
before the paper went to press,
swallowing up information the
public would never read.
Just earlier this month, the South
African parliament approved a
draft of the "secrecy bill," which, if
passed, is expected to bring the
death of investigative journalism in
the country.
Amid the threat of censorship,
one thing sustains these journalists: a
fundamental belief in their country
their community and its po
tential to overcome any challenge.

It is this same belief in a commu
nity in the Stanford community
that motivates our reporters and
staffers, to offer you the best cover
age of Stanford that we can.
I encourage you to pick up The
Daily when you see it in the dining
hall, at one of our other 150 campus
locations or at one of our nearly
500 locations in Palo Alto and the
surrounding area. If you would like
to receive Daily headlines in your

incredible responsibility. I hope
