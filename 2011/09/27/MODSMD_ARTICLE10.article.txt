## THE 						BIOCHEMICAL PAC-MAN 
### PIETER ILIASSOV 
From Frogger to Fifa, video games have come a
long way. They began as a new means to sim
ple entertainment. Now, with more advanced
graphics and complex systems, video
games in Silicon Valley are educa
tional.
Assistant bioengineering professor In
gmar Riedel-Kruse, assistant biochem
istry professor Rhiju Das Ph.D. 'O5 and
education professor Daniel Schwartz
co-founded the Bio-X Game Cen
ter to further education and re
search through biotic games. Bi
otic games are games that re
quire a biological process to
run, and players interact and
play directly with microor
ganisms.
Riedel-Kruse's biotic
games are based on
biotechnological princi
ples on multiple scales.
His group came up with
eight games classified
into three broad cate
gories: interactions
with molecules, single
cells or colonies of uni
cellular organisms.
The molecular biotic
game, called "Polymer-
Race," involves a lab
technique called poly
merase chain reactions
(PCR), which generate mil
lions of copies of a particular DNA
sequence. The game mirrors a horse race: the player
bets on which reactions will finish fastest as the player
is linked to a PCR machine that runs multiple reactions
simultaneously. Like with real horse races, inside infor
mation, like bio-molecular intuition, may aid the play
er.
In the games involving paramecia, unicellular or
ganisms swim in a fluid chamber. The player controls
the polarity or chemical composition of the fluid cham

ber to manipulate where the paramecia swim. In turn,
a camera sends live images to a video screen, with a
game board interface superimposed on the image of
the paramecia. A microprocessor tracks the move
ments of the paramecia and keeps score.
These games have

been developed to give the player a fun and interactive
way to delve into the intricacies of biological processes
without committing to a formal lab experiment.
Riendel-Kruse and his team began with simple
games because they wanted to see if they could design
such biotic games in the first place.
"We tried to mimic some classic video game," he
said.
They created the game "PAC-mecium" to em
ulate PacMan. In the game, players guide para
mecia to eat dots.
Other biotic games include "Biotic
Pinball," "POND PONG" and "Cilia
ball," in which paramecia use their cilia,
or micro-hairs, to swim and play a
game similar to soccer.
"We hope that by playing games in
volving biology of a scale too small
to see with the naked eye, people
will realize how amazing these
processes are and they'll get curi
ous and want to know more," he
said. "But we are also thinking
perhaps we could have people
running real experiments as they
play these games."
Through these games,
Riendel-Kruse created an envi
ronment in which normal people
can contribute to solving research
problems.
"The idea is that while we
as humans play the game, we interact
with real biological processes or mate
rial," he said.
The games are instrumental to his
ambition to educate and motivate people to
learn more about biotechnology.
"We would argue that modern biotechnology will
influence our life at an accelerating pace, most promi
nently in the personal biomedical choices that we will
be faced with more and more often," Riedel-Kruse
said. "Everyone should have sufficient knowledge
about the basics of biomedicine and biotechnology. Bi
otic games could promote that."
