# OPINIONS
## THE
						YOUNG ADULT SECTION Typecast 
### Nina Chung 
When we were little, every
thing was up in the air. We
were taking dance, tennis,
swimming, piano, soccer and skat
ing lessons because the odds were
good that we'd excel in at least one
of them. Our potential was endless.
Our best qualities were groomed,
our worst ones subject to interven
tion, and only few taken for grant
ed. Mostly, our nebulous futures
were targets for grown-up criti
cism, even if we didn't get it, or
maybe because we didn't get it.
"Honey, don't dress like that,"
some relative might have said.

"Huh? What? What??" we
might have questioned.
"Like a hippie/bum/snob,"
would suffice; and we absorbed it.
Later, as young teens, the advice
grew more concrete: "You're defi
nitely a this kind of person, so go for
that." And whether we accepted or
rebelled, we heard it.

However casual they seemed,
comments like these were powerful
catalysts for lifelong opinions. A
simple remark could ricochet for
years before becoming an assump
tion about our world at large. We
just never knew which ones would.
Childhood was like a constant audi
tion; we were choosing the person
we wanted to be.

Now, in our late teens and early
20s, we're not the societal empty
canvases we once were. After two
decades' worth of feedback, grade
school labels and looks on other
people's faces, we can describe our
selves by ourselves, thank you very
much. Maturity, after all, is the sta
bilization of role-playing.
Or so I thought, before my
"role-playing" recently started
looking less "stable." I got to won
dering: if the tryouts have really
ended, have we learned to typecast
ourselves for life?

The question plagued me this
summer, as I found myself acting
with a very new cast of characters. I
was working with co-worker in
terns who shared my ethnic back
ground, which was a first. In fact,
sharing that much space with peo
ple whose heritage was similar to
mine was a first. Nevertheless, I en
tered the scene self-assured and
armed with the things I knew would
distinguish me. I was confident. I
was cocky. Whatever I was, I was
ready to present Nina Chung. I
knew this girl, and I knew how to
play this game.
Yet as the weeks went by, it be
came clear that my new friends per
ceived me a bit differently than I
was used to. Their picture of me fea
tured adjectives I was unaccus
tomed to, not necessarily bad or
good, but sometimes downright un
expected. Several times, I came
home thinking, "Well, they don't
actually know me." It was clear they
didn't see the Nina I was... or was
that someone I had purposefully
prepared for the situation? Sure
enough, denial eventually popped
into awareness the way it usually
does, and my thought became,
"Wow, they really know that part of
me." And I had wasted precious
time trying to convince everyone I
was another particular person I
thought was still me.

Perhaps we do this more than
we think. We promote our identi
ties like products, and post
epiphany, I became conscious of
others also blaring personal in
fomercials as well. It's not always
intentional, of course. But it's in
evitable even when we introduce
ourselves to new people. By now,
we've made some conclusion about
who and what we are that guides
our style, our "type" or what we
want to be associated with or
known for. It feels so permanent
and thus secure. But belying that is
the risk that we're wrong or that
we never let ourselves be wrong.
Back in the day, we effortlessly
doubted the roles we played in our
families, relationships, parties and
group projects. Can we still? Is it
too dangerous now? Indeed, it
might be more dangerous not to. I
know for sure that our skepticism
lives, even if we forget to apply it to
ourselves. So we should keep
checking to see if, in reality, we're
following a new script, lest we trap
ourselves in a costume that no
longer fits. A very famous man once
said, "All the world's a stage, and all
the men and women merely play
ers."

And when the time comes, we
should let ourselves play different
ly, too.

Care to critique or send a review?
Nina wants to hear it all, and all it
takes is an email to ninamc@stan
ford.edu. Good luck on your first
week of classes!

I got to
wondering:
ifthetryoutshave
really ended, have
we learned to
typecast ourselves
for life?
