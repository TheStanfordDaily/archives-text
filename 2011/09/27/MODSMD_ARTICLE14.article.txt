# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## Welcome to Stanford! 
### Camira Powell 
Whether you're a freshman
still getting lost around
campus (admit it, you
know you are) or an upperclassman
who has been around for a minute, I
know by now you're sick of hearing
it: "Welcome to Stanford!" Hope
fully I'll be the last person who'll say
that to you, but you and I both know
that's not true. But admit it, you're
as happy to be on campus as Stan
ford is to see you return. And take it
from someone who spent her entire
summer working on campus; things
just aren't the same without you
guys (insert sad face).
Anyone at Stanford between
commencement and convocation
can testify to the fact that campus
was far from deserted. No matter
where I turned, I saw people. For
months, the campus was teeming
with socially inept kids, smug teens
and over-aged adults reliving their
youth. And these intruders were

everywhere Wilbur, Stern, the
CoHo, Jamba Juice; a few of them
even found their way to Olives. Ac
tually, for most of June, July and
early August, Stanford was bom
barded with visitors. Did you know
that about 20,000 people come
through Stanford during the sum
mer? Of course that isn't all at once,
but that's still a staggering number
considering our undergraduate
population hovers around 6,000.
After finishing an academic year
that didn't want to end (thanks,
sophomore slump), I couldn't un
derstand why people were so happy
to be at Stanford. I was just here to
work, as my only alternative was
spending another summer in Indi
ana watching "The Price is Right"
with my grandma and being used
for free babysitting. Instead, I spent
hours each week passing out room
keys and fobs (don't ask). I saw par
ents who drove their children from
Florida to California for an (over
priced) week-long program about
the joys of reading. Some musicians
traveled from London to attend a
10-day jazz class. And Asian tourists
took my picture at least once per
day. Upon arriving at Stanford, peo
ple of all ages ran around like they
were at Magic Mountain wrapped
up in Disneyland. Trust me, you
don't know what excitement is until
you've watched a pack of 10-year
old boys walk into a dining hall.
I know Stanford looks great on
paper. I'm not going to bother list
ing a bunch of statistics about why
we're amazing (you know, the usual
stuff about having the No. 2 law
school in the country, a ridiculously
competitive admit rate of 7.1 per
cent and an Orange Bowl-winning
football team) it's all Google
able. That's not the point; rather, it's
the sad realization that somewhere
between chanting your little heart
out at NSO and becoming a dread
ed upperclassman, you get jaded.
Seeing all of these non-Stanford
people's enthusiasm about every
thing, I took off my cardinal-col
ored glasses and looked at the Farm
as if I had never seen it before. And
that's when it hit me: Stanford is a
great tourist destination. And I
mean that in the most sincere, best
way possible. Think about it:
tourists tend to go places that are in
teresting, fun, educational, beauti
ful, renowned, historical or unique.
That basically sums us up, aside
from a few adjectives. We live where

others want to be. And why do they
want to be here? Because of us, of
course. Okay, that does sound a lit
tle egotistical and there are a lot of
other reasons to want to come to
Stanford, but we are still a big draw.
Stanford attracts a unique blend of
individuals who are driven, but also
laid back. Talented yet unpreten
tious our uniqueness is what
gives Stanford its liveliness. That's
what makes it so special, and that's
why people are so happy to be here.
Over time, it's easy to forget all the
positives and just see the problems.
But with a little distance or over
exposure, in my case you can see
all the reasons why you fell in love
in the first place.
So for the last time (I lied, I can't
resist): Welcome to Stanford! We
missed you (insert happy face).

Want Camira to give you a tour?
Sorry, she's away, but you can still
send her your thoughts at camirap@

course. Okay, that does sound a lit
tle egotistical and there are a lot of
other reasons to want to come to
Stanford, but we are still a big draw.
Stanford attracts a unique blend of
individuals who are driven, but also
laid back. Talented yet unpreten
tious our uniqueness is what
gives Stanford its liveliness. That's
what makes it so special, and that's
why people are so happy to be here.
Over time, it's easy to forget all the
positives and just see the problems.
But with a little distance or over
exposure, in my case you can see
all the reasons why you fell in love
in the first place.
So for the last time (I lied, I can't
resist): Welcome to Stanford! We
missed you (insert happy face).

Want Camira to give you a tour?
Sorry, she's away, but you can still
send her your thoughts at camirap@
stanford.edu.

I took off my
cardinal-colored
glasses and
looked at the
Farm as I had
never seen it
before.
