## REBOUNDING Stanford bounces back from 2-4 start with a pair of wins 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After dropping four of the sea
son's first six games, the Stanford
men's soccer team had its back
against the wall this weekend at the
Stanford Nike Classic, as it tried to
avoid digging itself into a hole too
big to recover from on the road to
the NCAA tournament. Two wins
over Harvard and Vermont put the
Cardinal (3-4-1) right back in the
thick of things heading into Pac-12
play next weekend.
Sunday's 2-1 victory over Ver
mont was especially gratifying for
Stanford, which has had a difficult
time holding leads this season. The

trend continued as the Cardinal
blew an early 1-0 advantage when
Yannick Lewis found the back of
the net on a corner kick for his
fourth goal of the season midway
through the first half.

But head coach Bret Simon's
team remained composed, possess
ing the ball for long stretches of
time despite being outshot by the
Catamounts 13-6 in the half.
After the break, the Card's dom
inant play was rewarded, as redshirt

senior midfielder Garrett Gunther
wove through the defense and
threaded a beautiful through-ball
to forward Dersu Abolfathi. The
junior reached the ball just ahead of
Vermont's diving keeper and deftly
chipped it over the line before
being taken out on the play.
Stanford pressed its advantage,
earning four corner kicks in the pe
riod and several dangerous free
kicks as Vermont appeared to tire.
But the Cardinal could not capital
ize before the final whistle, settling
for a much-needed 2-1 win to cap a
five-game homestand.
Junior captain Hunter Gorskie,
a defender who scored his first col
legiate goal and gave Stanford the

early lead on Sunday, was pleased
with how the team responded after
several tough losses to begin the
season.

"Going into the weekend, we
knew that we had to come out with
a couple of good results," Gorskie
said. "We actually felt that as a team
we were playing well this season,
outpossessing teams, getting plenty
of chances. The difference was we
got a little grittier, kind of had more
of a fighting mentality."
That mentality was on display
early in Friday night's game, which
saw a collision of academic titans as
Stanford played host to Harvard.

Freshman midfielder Grant Grafentin (center) battles for the ball between two defenders in Stanford's 2-1 victory over Vermont. The Cardinal had to
battle after the Catamounts equalized in the first half. Stanford dominated the second half, though, as junior forward Dersu Abolfathi netted the winner.
Newly renovated Cagan Stadium
was rocking and over 1,750 fans
packed the stands, one of the biggest
crowds to watch the men's team in
recent years.

Simon's team responded by
pressing the issue from the start. Ju
nior Adam Jahn had a pair of early
shots, and Stanford threatened on
four corner kicks in the first half.
But it was a free kick that put the
Cardinal on the board in the 42nd
minute, with a long cross from mid
fielder Eric Anderson finding
Jahn's head in the box for the for
ward's second goal of the year.
Anderson has emerged as very

real threat on set pieces the
speedy junior has three assists, all
on dead balls, and nearly scored on
another free kick Friday.
Harvard came out fired up in
the second half, picking up its at
tack and winning the ball in dan
gerous places. But Stanford's back
four stood up to the test, shutting
down the Crimson attack and pick
ing up the first shutout of the sea
son in front of redshirt sophomore
goalie Jason Dodson.
"It was a very good defensive ef
fort," Simon said. "The back four
were fantastic — really warriors
all weekend against some great
athletes, some very tall players.
They were not easy matchups, and I
was really pleased with the de
fense, especially since [senior cen
terback] Tommy Ryan was the only
one who started last year. To see

them start to gel and work together
playing a lot of minutes, I think it's
a good omen," he said.
With the offense finally start
ing to click Stanford had as
many shots this weekend as it had
in the first four games of the sea
son and the defense settling
into a groove, the Cardinal will
have a chance to prove it belongs
in the discussion with No.lB
UCLA and defending champion
Cal for the Pac-12 title and a trip
back to the postseason after miss
ing out on the NCAA tournament
last season.

Stanford opens conference play
on the road at San Diego State on
Friday night, with a trip to face the
Bruins looming on Sunday.

of a fighting mentality."
That mentality was on display
early in Friday night's game, which
saw a collision of academic titans as
Stanford played host to Harvard.

Freshman midfielder Grant Grafentin (center) battles for the ball between two defenders in Stanford's 2-1 victory over Vermont. The Cardinal had to
battle after the Catamounts equalized in the first half. Stanford dominated the second half, though, as junior forward Dersu Abolfathi netted the winner.
Newly renovated Cagan Stadium
was rocking and over 1,750 fans
packed the stands, one of the biggest
crowds to watch the men's team in
recent years.

Simon's team responded by
pressing the issue from the start. Ju
nior Adam Jahn had a pair of early
shots, and Stanford threatened on
four corner kicks in the first half.
But it was a free kick that put the
Cardinal on the board in the 42nd
minute, with a long cross from mid
fielder Eric Anderson finding
Jahn's head in the box for the for
ward's second goal of the year.
Anderson has emerged as very

real threat on set pieces the
speedy junior has three assists, all
on dead balls, and nearly scored on
another free kick Friday.
Harvard came out fired up in
the second half, picking up its at
tack and winning the ball in dan
gerous places. But Stanford's back
four stood up to the test, shutting
down the Crimson attack and pick
ing up the first shutout of the sea
son in front of redshirt sophomore
goalie Jason Dodson.
"It was a very good defensive ef
fort," Simon said. "The back four
were fantastic — really warriors
all weekend against some great
athletes, some very tall players.
They were not easy matchups, and I
was really pleased with the de
fense, especially since [senior cen
terback] Tommy Ryan was the only
one who started last year. To see

them start to gel and work together
playing a lot of minutes, I think it's
a good omen," he said.
With the offense finally start
ing to click Stanford had as
many shots this weekend as it had
in the first four games of the sea
son and the defense settling
into a groove, the Cardinal will
have a chance to prove it belongs
in the discussion with No.lB
UCLA and defending champion
Cal for the Pac-12 title and a trip
back to the postseason after miss
ing out on the NCAA tournament
last season.

Stanford opens conference play
on the road at San Diego State on
Friday night, with a trip to face the
Bruins looming on Sunday.
