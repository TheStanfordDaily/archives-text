## REBOUNDING Stanford bounces back from 2-4 start with a pair of wins 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After dropping four of the sea
son's first six games, the Stanford
men's soccer team had its back
against the wall this weekend at the
Stanford Nike Classic, as it tried to
avoid digging itself into a hole too
big to recover from on the road to
the NCAA tournament. Two wins
over Harvard and Vermont put the
Cardinal (3-4-1) right back in the
thick of things heading into Pac-12
play next weekend.
Sunday's 2-1 victory over Ver
mont was especially gratifying for
Stanford, which has had a difficult
time holding leads this season. The

trend continued as the Cardinal
blew an early 1-0 advantage when
Yannick Lewis found the back of
the net on a corner kick for his
fourth goal of the season midway
through the first half.

But head coach Bret Simon's
team remained composed, possess
ing the ball for long stretches of
time despite being outshot by the
Catamounts 13-6 in the half.
After the break, the Card's dom
inant play was rewarded, as redshirt

senior midfielder Garrett Gunther
wove through the defense and
threaded a beautiful through-ball
to forward Dersu Abolfathi. The
junior reached the ball just ahead of
Vermont's diving keeper and deftly
chipped it over the line before
being taken out on the play.
Stanford pressed its advantage,
earning four corner kicks in the pe
riod and several dangerous free
kicks as Vermont appeared to tire.
But the Cardinal could not capital
ize before the final whistle, settling
for a much-needed 2-1 win to cap a
five-game homestand.
Junior captain Hunter Gorskie,
a defender who scored his first col
legiate goal and gave Stanford the

early lead on Sunday, was pleased
with how the team responded after
several tough losses to begin the
season.

"Going into the weekend, we
knew that we had to come out with
a couple of good results," Gorskie
said. "We actually felt that as a team
we were playing well this season,
outpossessing teams, getting plenty
of chances. The difference was we
got a little grittier, kind of had more
of a fighting mentality."
That mentality was on display
early in Friday night's game, which
saw a collision of academic titans as
Stanford played host to Harvard.
