# DRU DRIVES CARDINAL VICTORIES
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford field hockey
team climbed into the top 10 of the Kookabur
ra/NFHCA National Coaches Poll for the first
time in 24 years, occupying the No. 9 slot thanks
to home wins over Indiana and Northeastern.
Friday night, in front of what several players
said was one of the rowdiest field hockey
crowds they could remember, the now-No. 8
Cardinal (7-1, 2-0 NorPac) charged past rival
California in the second half for a thrilling 3-2
NorPac victory.

It was the first time Stanford and Cal had
played as ranked teams since November 2001,
and the 633 fans, plus perhaps a hundred more
who lined the fences at the Varsity Turf, were
treated to an exciting game with plenty of scor
ing chances.
The Card struck first, just minutes into the
game, as junior defender Kelsey Lloyd scored
her first goal of the year on a quick strike to the
top corner.
But the Golden Bears came right back, qui
eting the crowd with an equalizer from Rachelle
Comeau. From there, the game settled down a
bit, with both sides trading scoring opportuni
ties but neither team breaking through before
halftime.
After the break, however, Stanford capital
ized on two goals from junior defender Becky

Junior defender Becky Dru did it all for the No. 8 Stanford field hockey team. The reigning NorPac
Defensive Player of the Year was an offensive force, scoring three goals in wins vs. Cal and UC-Davis.
Dru, who continued her recent
scoring spree. The 2010 NorPac De
fensive Player of the Year leads the
team with 10 goals in nine games,
and found the net twice in two min
utes against Cal.
Both goals came off penalty cor
ners for the Cardinal, with junior
attacker Hope Burke feeding sen
ior attacker Stephanie Byrne, who
found Dru for the score.
The Bears put on a spirited rally,
as Comeau knocked in her second
goal of the night with less than two
minutes remaining. She took a pass
from Andrea Earle for a break
away after Stanford's goalie, red
shirt senior Ale Moss, charged out
but could not stop the play.
"The key was our ability to exe
cute," Burke said. "We spend a lot
of time practicing our corner plays
and our diligence paid off Friday
with two goals coming from cor
ners. Once we scored those goals I
feel like we were more confident in
all aspects of our game; our passing,
pressing, attack and defense all
came together and that is what
made the difference for us in the
second half."
The defense was particularly ef
ficient, and Moss finished with five
saves, three of which were huge
point-blank stops of Golden Bear
chances.
On Sunday, Moss came up even
bigger as Stanford hit the road to
take on UC-Davis (2-6,1-1). A bal
anced offensive attack led to three
goals from three different players,
including another from NorPac Of
fensive Player of the Week Dru, but
it was Moss who kept the Cardinal
undefeated in conference play with
seven saves.

Once again, it was Stanford who
broke through early, scoring two
goals in the first 10 minutes, includ

ing yet another goal off a penalty
corner. But the Aggies refused to
give in, scoring a goal with just two
seconds left before halftime.

Katie Mitchell chipped in an in
surance goal in the 60th minute off
a rebound, making the score 3-1
and giving the Card some breathing
room. The final 10 minutes were
relatively uneventful, and despite
only outshooting Davis by four,
Stanford held on to complete the
first half of the NorPac schedule
undefeated.

"I feel like we are definitely on
the right track to becoming a top
notch field hockey program,"
Burke said. "We train from August
through October to get ready for
November and our goal is to put
ourselves in the best position possi
ble to be successful in the NCAA
Tournament."

The team is relatively young
six freshmen have started most of
the team's games and freshman
attacker Alex McCawley (this
week's NorPac Rookie of the Week)
is second on the team behind Dru
with four goals. Still, the team has
played well under pressure and won
some critical road games, leading to
the team's current No. 8 ranking.

Burke attributes much of the
success to the team's emphasis on
spreading opposing teams out with
a very balanced attack and good
depth.

"Our game plan is that everyone
touches the ball, whether you're a
freshman or a senior, defender or
attack," Burke said. "Some teams
only have one or two go-to players,
but we want to be so versatile that
we can give anyone on our team the
ball and create something positive
out of it."
Stanford will take the field Fri
day night to host Robert Morris in
the first of three non-league
matchups before returning to Nor-
Pac play on Oct. 14 against Pacific.

California in the second half for a thrilling 3-2
NorPac victory.

It was the first time Stanford and Cal had
played as ranked teams since November 2001,
and the 633 fans, plus perhaps a hundred more
who lined the fences at the Varsity Turf, were
treated to an exciting game with plenty of scor
ing chances.
The Card struck first, just minutes into the
game, as junior defender Kelsey Lloyd scored
her first goal of the year on a quick strike to the
top corner.
But the Golden Bears came right back, qui
eting the crowd with an equalizer from Rachelle
Comeau. From there, the game settled down a
bit, with both sides trading scoring opportuni
ties but neither team breaking through before
halftime.
After the break, however, Stanford capital
ized on two goals from junior defender Becky

Junior defender Becky Dru did it all for the No. 8 Stanford field hockey team. The reigning NorPac
Defensive Player of the Year was an offensive force, scoring three goals in wins vs. Cal and UC-Davis.
Dru, who continued her recent
scoring spree. The 2010 NorPac De
fensive Player of the Year leads the
team with 10 goals in nine games,
and found the net twice in two min
utes against Cal.
Both goals came off penalty cor
ners for the Cardinal, with junior
attacker Hope Burke feeding sen
ior attacker Stephanie Byrne, who
found Dru for the score.
The Bears put on a spirited rally,
as Comeau knocked in her second
goal of the night with less than two
minutes remaining. She took a pass
from Andrea Earle for a break
away after Stanford's goalie, red
shirt senior Ale Moss, charged out
but could not stop the play.
"The key was our ability to exe
cute," Burke said. "We spend a lot
of time practicing our corner plays
and our diligence paid off Friday
with two goals coming from cor
ners. Once we scored those goals I
feel like we were more confident in
all aspects of our game; our passing,
pressing, attack and defense all
came together and that is what
made the difference for us in the
second half."
The defense was particularly ef
ficient, and Moss finished with five
saves, three of which were huge
point-blank stops of Golden Bear
chances.
On Sunday, Moss came up even
bigger as Stanford hit the road to
take on UC-Davis (2-6,1-1). A bal
anced offensive attack led to three
goals from three different players,
including another from NorPac Of
fensive Player of the Week Dru, but
it was Moss who kept the Cardinal
undefeated in conference play with
seven saves.

Once again, it was Stanford who
broke through early, scoring two
goals in the first 10 minutes, includ

ing yet another goal off a penalty
corner. But the Aggies refused to
give in, scoring a goal with just two
seconds left before halftime.

Katie Mitchell chipped in an in
surance goal in the 60th minute off
a rebound, making the score 3-1
and giving the Card some breathing
room. The final 10 minutes were
relatively uneventful, and despite
only outshooting Davis by four,
Stanford held on to complete the
first half of the NorPac schedule
undefeated.

"I feel like we are definitely on
the right track to becoming a top
notch field hockey program,"
Burke said. "We train from August
through October to get ready for
November and our goal is to put
ourselves in the best position possi
ble to be successful in the NCAA
Tournament."

The team is relatively young
six freshmen have started most of
the team's games and freshman
attacker Alex McCawley (this
week's NorPac Rookie of the Week)
is second on the team behind Dru
with four goals. Still, the team has
played well under pressure and won
some critical road games, leading to
the team's current No. 8 ranking.

Burke attributes much of the
success to the team's emphasis on
spreading opposing teams out with
a very balanced attack and good
depth.

"Our game plan is that everyone
touches the ball, whether you're a
freshman or a senior, defender or
attack," Burke said. "Some teams
only have one or two go-to players,
but we want to be so versatile that
we can give anyone on our team the
ball and create something positive
out of it."
Stanford will take the field Fri
day night to host Robert Morris in
the first of three non-league
matchups before returning to Nor-
Pac play on Oct. 14 against Pacific.
