# DRU DRIVES CARDINAL VICTORIES

### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford field hockey
team climbed into the top 10 of the Kookabur
ra/NFHCA National Coaches Poll for the first
time in 24 years, occupying the No. 9 slot thanks
to home wins over Indiana and Northeastern.
Friday night, in front of what several players
said was one of the rowdiest field hockey
crowds they could remember, the now-No. 8
Cardinal (7-1, 2-0 NorPac) charged past rival
California in the second half for a thrilling 3-2
NorPac victory.

It was the first time Stanford and Cal had
played as ranked teams since November 2001,
and the 633 fans, plus perhaps a hundred more
who lined the fences at the Varsity Turf, were
treated to an exciting game with plenty of scor
ing chances.
The Card struck first, just minutes into the
game, as junior defender Kelsey Lloyd scored
her first goal of the year on a quick strike to the
top corner.
But the Golden Bears came right back, qui
eting the crowd with an equalizer from Rachelle
Comeau. From there, the game settled down a
bit, with both sides trading scoring opportuni
ties but neither team breaking through before
halftime.
After the break, however, Stanford capital
ized on two goals from junior defender Becky

Junior defender Becky Dru did it all for the No. 8 Stanford field hockey team. The reigning NorPac
