# If leagues continued to grow...

Though the Pac-12 has dis
missed the possibility of
further expansion in the
wake of recent realign
ment among college foot
ball conferences the most con
fusing consequence of which must
be that the Big 12 now has just nine
members while the Big Ten has 12
even the fact that this was dis
cussed raises an interesting ques
tion: Is there a limit to conference
size?
Having just two more members
caused the Pac-12 to be divided up
into two sub-conferences, so what
would happen if a 16-team super
conference materialized? And what
would we call that conference? Four
of the current teams come from
states that don't own real estate on
the Pacific; add in a couple of teams
from Texas and Oklahoma and the
current name loses all sense of real
ity. At least the teams in the soon-to
be 14-team ACC are close to the sea.
But if a conference can have 16
schools and two or more sub-confer
ences, why can't it have 32? Or 64? If
it makes real sense to be in a larger
conference, then schools will be in
creasingly under pressure to join up,
and conference sizes will swell. There
are currently 120 NCAA Division I
Football Bowl Subdivision teams di
vided among 12 conferences. Setting
aside the four schools that are inde
pendent, that makes an average of al
most 10 teams in each. Increase the
average by just six and four whole
conferences will disappear.
The main reason given in decid
ing not to expand the Pac-12 further
was, ominously, money. If the biggest
obstacle is financial it implies that if
or when the money is right there
won't be much in the way of the con
ference expanding further. As a for
eigner I've always felt uncomfort
able with this side of American
sports that teams will quite hap
pily go where the money is, or at
least where they think it is. The for
merly Oakland, formerly LA, Oak
land Raiders saga seemed particu
larly incomprehensible to me
how could a team desert its home
and fans in the first place, and then
expect to be welcomed back? but
it is not particularly unique. There is
a fair share of U.S. professional
teams that have had a few different
makeovers.
College sports, though, seem
more grounded in the real world.
You can't just move a university
from one side of the country to an
other even if Stanford does have
designs for New York City so in
stead we are left with the lesser evil
of conference realignment. We still
seem to be losing something,
though. Although it would be un
thinkable not to play Cal each year,
Stanford's history against USC and
UCLA is surely almost as impor
tant. They have been in the same
conference for over half a century. If
the boot was on the other foot and
the Big 12 was courting us, would we
jump?
And what now happens to the
much-maligned BCS ranking sys
tem? The Pac-12 now has a title
game. But what if it (or one of the
other conferences) decides to ex
pand further? If a conference of 12
teams needs a title game, perhaps a
conference of 24 would need a play
off system.
Every year fans feel mistreated
at the end of the regular season
when their school is overlooked for
one of the BCS games, and there
have been many unbeaten teams
who never got the chance at a BCS
National Championship Game. But
the complexities of the BCS system
are really a reflection of the nature
of college football. Some teams are
in conferences, some aren't; some
play more games, some play less.
Judging who deserves a shot at the
title when the statistics aren't sam
pled evenly isn't easy.
Perhaps realignment, though, is
the answer. Should we get to eight
super-conferences with their own
title games, it would start to look
very much like the foundations for a
playoff system; just call these games
the BCS Sweet 16 and the rest
should fall into place nicely.
However, college football is not
usually a fan of such an ordered sys
tem. Tlie conferences would have to
agree to split up the schools equally
