## Postal Service may close several regional locations 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
With an expected budget deficit of $9.2 bil
lion for the fiscal year, the United States Postal
Service (USPS) is considering closing a number
of offices, including 114 in California, several of
which are close to campus.
Affected post offices near Stanford include
Colonnade near San Jose, in addition to Loma
Mar, San Gregorio, two offices near Oakland
and five offices in or near San Francisco.
A list of 3,653 offices marked for potential

closures was announced on July 26. The Postal
Service said it would save $2OO million annual
ly by closing these 3,653 offices. However, this
does not mean that all offices on the list will
close.
The Colonnade post office is still in the
study stage, so its fate has not yet been decided.
There will be a public meeting about the post
office on Tuesday, Oct. 4 from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30
p.m. at the First Immanuel Lutheran Church in
San Jose.


LUIS AGUILAR/The Stanford Daily
Students waited in line at the campus post office. While this location is safe from closure, several
local post offices are being considered for closure due to United States Postal Sen/ice budget deficits.
Proposals to close the San Gre
gorio and Loma Mar post offices
were posted in the respective lob
bies on Sept. 17, 2011, and will re
main posted for 60 days.
"These offices are being studied
for possible closure because of a
declining office workload and
steadily declining revenue over the
past several years," wrote James T.
Wigdel, U.S. Postal Service
spokesperson for the San Francisco
area, in an email to The Daily.
"After the posting period, a deci
sion will be made as to whether or
not the Post Offices will be closed.
If the decision is to close, that no
tice will be posted for 30 days and
the community will have an oppor

tunity to appeal that decision."
The Postal Service is struggling
with high labor costs and decreased
mail volume, which results in low
revenue. Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR) research scholar Greg
Rosston suggested that the Postal
Service should cut down more
drastically on its variable costs.
"This cut is trying to reduce the
fixed costs," Rosston wrote in an
email to The Daily. "However, I
suspect that a large part of the cost
of running the operation that has
not been adjusting with declining
volume is service-related costs. It
takes the carrier approximately as
much time to do a route with five
pieces of mail as it does with 10
pieces of mail."
The Postal Service has already
announced the end of Saturday de
livery, which would lower variable
costs, along with its plans to close

post offices, whose costs are fixed
costs, as well as lay off workers.
Rosston suggested that the Postal
Service should go further and cut
delivery service down to three days
a week, allowing people to pay a
small amount for five or six-day de
livery.

Many of the offices on the list
are in rural areas and have low traf
fic. The Postal Service has said it
would not leave rural areas entire
ly. The solution may be a partner
ship with local businesses, such as
grocery stores and gas stations, to
provide basic, popular services,
such as flat-rate shipping, even
after local post offices close. Sales
from stamps at grocery stores,
pharmacies and other businesses
already account for 35 percent of
the Postal Service's retail revenues.
