## Postal Service may close several regional locations 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
With an expected budget deficit of $9.2 bil
lion for the fiscal year, the United States Postal
Service (USPS) is considering closing a number
of offices, including 114 in California, several of
which are close to campus.
Affected post offices near Stanford include
Colonnade near San Jose, in addition to Loma
Mar, San Gregorio, two offices near Oakland
and five offices in or near San Francisco.
A list of 3,653 offices marked for potential

closures was announced on July 26. The Postal
Service said it would save $2OO million annual
ly by closing these 3,653 offices. However, this
does not mean that all offices on the list will
close.
The Colonnade post office is still in the
study stage, so its fate has not yet been decided.
There will be a public meeting about the post
office on Tuesday, Oct. 4 from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30
p.m. at the First Immanuel Lutheran Church in
San Jose.

Students waited in line at the campus post office. While this location is safe from closure, several
local post offices are being considered for closure due to United States Postal Sen/ice budget deficits.
