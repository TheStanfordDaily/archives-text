# Alcohol education initiative debuts
## Student Affairs opens Office of Alcohol Policy and Education 
### ELLORA ISRANI DESK EDITOR 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Greg Boardman announced in a Sept. 8
email the formation of an Office of Al
cohol Policy and Education (OAPE), to
be headed by former Vaden Health
Center Associate Director Ralph Cas
tro.

For his first year in the position, Cas
tro who is now associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs and director of OAPE

will report directly to Boardman. He is
joined by former ASSU President An
gelina Cardona 'll, who will focus on
developing alcohol-free events on cam
pus, and Jarreau Bowen 'O7, former
Peer Health Educators coordinator,
who will fill Castro's former responsi
bility of alcohol outreach education.
Castro and Bowen have one-year and
one-quarter terms, respectively.
The office's first major development
has been the establishment of a central
ized alcohol policy on its website,
"The policy was dispersed under a
number of different offices, and what
we did over the summer is we brought it
all together under one document to
make it more student-friendly and un
derstood," Boardman said. "I think it's
going to go a long way in helping clarify
confusion and such around the policy in
the past. We're going to want to improve
clarity, consistency, accountability."
"We are asking all students to be re
sponsible, both personally and collec
tively," Castro wrote in an email to The
Daily. "We introduced a model to stu
dent staff to encourage them to set con
structive norms at the outset and active
ly engage residents in ongoing conver

sations about alcohol."
The office is funded by a special
grant from the Provost. According to
Boardman, it will work with several de
partments across Student Affairs and
campus in general among them
Vaden, Student Activities and Leader
ship, the Graduate Life Office, ASSU,
campus police and Residential Educa
tion.
Given that their statistics show that a
significant amount of drinking occurs in
residence halls, both Boardman and
Castro expressed the urgency of proper
training for residence staff.
"We believe that by actively setting
positive norms and engaging with resi
dents throughout the year on the front
end, that student staff will be able to
prevent negative consequences and
limit the amount of time they spend re
sponding to dangerous behaviors on the
back end," Castro said.
Cardona will be implementing spe
cial initiatives based on a concern that,
according to Boardman, several resi
dential assistants have expressed: "a
lack of alternative kinds of programs"
to alcohol-centered events.
"[Last] weekend wasn't directly
planned by our office, but it's kind of
connected in the sense of there's no
football game on Saturday, but the array
of activities that are planned for the
weekend in lieu of a football game, so
those are the kinds of things that this of
fice will be working on," Boardman
said.

Meanwhile, Bowen will be focused
on alcohol outreach education through-
out campus.
"I will primarily oversee all out
reach and educational initiatives
for our office including, but not
limited to, dorm talks, seminars, ac
ademic courses and research proj
ects," he wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Our University and our
student body is dynamic and our
office hopes to grow and change
just as our students do. We are al
ways looking for new ideas and dif
ferent ways to work with students,
staff and faculty to continue and
enhance our efforts."
He also stressed the importance
of community engagement in the
success of alcohol education.
"We've engaged with parents
during NSO and we're working
closely with faculty and [resident
fellows]," he said. "We are also
developing research projects to
examine trends on our campus.
You will also start to see many al
cohol-free alternative events on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
nights. We've got much more to
come but love to hear from stu
dents about what they'd like to
see as well."
