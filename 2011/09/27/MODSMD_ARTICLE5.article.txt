# Yosemite deaths point to nature s risks
## Stanford community reflects on dangers and benefits of outdoor education. 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
Yosemite National Park has seen an in
crease in visitor deaths this year,
prompting rangers and park visi
tors to reconsider the risks and
safety precautions inherent
in a park visit. As of late
September, the annual
count stood at 18 deaths
inside park grounds.

Welcoming four million visitors last
year, Yosemite is a popular draw for Stan
ford students, whether on dorm camping
trips or hikes led by the Stanford Redwood
Club.
Many deaths in national parks occur
due to common causes, such as heart attack,
though several this year in Yosemite have
been accidental; two falls occurred on Half
Dome, and three people were swept over a

waterfall. Despite the increase of
deaths in Yosemite, national park
deaths have not increased overall
this year. As of Sept. 5,113 deaths
had occurred in national parks this
year, fewer than at that point last
year, according to Park Service
spokesman Jeffrey Olson in an in
terview with The New York Times.
The Stanford community knows
what it is like to experience loss due
to the dangers of Yosemite.
In July 2010, Christina "Chris"
Chan M.S. 'OB, a former doctoral
student in political science at Stan
ford, died in a climbing accident at
Yosemite at the age of 31. In March
1997, Henry Tien, a 21-year-old sen
ior majoring in biological sciences,
died from head injuries sustained
when he fell while hiking in the
park.
"It's unfortunate when acci
dents happen, but if there's one
thing we can predict, it's that they
will happen," said Andy Fields, di
rector of Stanford Outdoor Educa
tion. Fields noted that Yosemite has
high levels of usage and many
members of the public are unaware
of the risks involved in a visit to the

awe-inspiring site.
"It's almost an amusement park
kind of feel, but it's still a very dan
gerous place beautiful, too, and
that's what makes it the wilder
ness," he said.
Fields highlighted how Stanford
uses decision-making, as opposed
to a protocol-based system, to train
student outdoor leaders.
"We like to empower the stu
dents, our leaders, as much as possi
ble because conditions always
change in the backcountry," he said.
"Our main approach in outdoor
education is to give adequate train
ing, that's been our primary philos
ophy," Fields said. "The wilderness
is a place to be enjoyed and respect
ed constantly —no matter what
skill level."

Rebecca Castro 'l2, an environ
mental anthropology major who
grew up in and nearby Yosemite,
said she sees many accidents as evi
dence of a "lack of respect for the
powers of nature and the warning
signs nature provides."
Castro spent the past summer in
the park as a cultural anthropolo
gist and American Indian liaison in
tern. This fall, she led a Stanford
Pre-OrientationTrip to North Lake
Tahoe and emphasized that com
munication, respect and responsi
bility were key to the safety of the
trip.

"There are still risks you can
take and you have to know your
limits," said Jeremy Caves, a gradu
ate student in environmental earth
system science. Caves was a teach
ing assistant for the recent Sopho
more College course "Environ
mental and Geological Field Stud
ies in the Rocky Mountains," taught
by geological and environmental
sciences professor Page Chamber
lain. The course took students on a
trip to both Yellowstone and Teton
National Parks, where they saw
firsthand the "spectacular beauty"
and dangers associated with geo
logical field research.
Cave described safety steps the
students learned, such as carrying
and knowing how to use bear spray
and hiking in at least pairs, but ide
ally groups of four or more.
"That's the important part,
training people," Caves said.
"If we provide people with the
right tools they can have great ex
periences," Fields said, discussing
how calculated risks make the sub
stantial benefits of outdoor educa
tion possible.
"I want to encourage people to
go into the wilderness, but I want
them to go in adequately aware and
prepared."
