## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Margaret Rawson 
The three "Young Guns" of
Flouse Republican leadership head
ed to Facebook headquarters in Palo
Alto on Monday for a "Facebook
Live" conversation. Facebook Chief
Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg
held an online discussion with House
Majority Eric Cantor (R-Va.),
House Majority Whip Kevin Mc-
Carthy (R-Calif.) and House Budget
Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).
The panel was held in a similar
format to President Barack Obama's
Facebook visit last April. Cantor,
McCarthy and Ryan answered ques
tions from around 100 Facebook em
ployees and guests. The event was
also broadcast live.

Cantor, McCarthy and Ryan co
authored their book, "Young Guns:
A New Generation of Conservative
Leaders," in August 2010.
The Republican leaders were not
the only visitors from Washington in
Silicon Valley this weekend, nor the
only to meet with the Facebook
COO. Sandberg hosted the Presi
dent at her home in Atherton, Calif,
for a Sunday night fundraiser. Mon
day morning, the President held a
town hall in Mountain View, Calif, at
the Computer Flistory Museum. The
event was cosponsored by another
social media force, Linkedln, and
was titled "Putting America Back to
Work: Linkedln Presents a Town
Hall with President Obama." The
President continued his West Coast
trip to Los Angeles.

Facebook is also shifting its focus
to ''putting America back to work."
The company announced its new
small-business education program
Monday, which will partner with the
National Federation of Independent
Business and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce to support small business
owners through case studies and we
binars.

Cantor said from the Speaker's
Balcony of the U.S. Capitol, preview
ing the Facebook event, that he ini
tially began using Facebook to track
his daughter's use of the site, but
hopes to use it as a political tool "to
begin a process of speaking and lis
tening."
