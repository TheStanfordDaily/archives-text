COURSE TITLE:
WOMEN POETS OF IRAN: 1797-1967
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Starting at the dawn of the 19th century, this course will first
examine the existing, indigenous tradition of women's poetry
in Qajar Iran. The focus will then shift to the emergence of
liberalist, modernist and proto-feminist poets in the early 20th
century, culminating in the iconoclastic and distruptive figures
of Simin Behbahani and Forugh Farrokhzad. The course will
trace the emergence of a female voice in Persian poetry in the
19th and 20th centuries and, although focused on women, it
will discuss the place within and contribution to the wider poetic
scene in Iran by women in some of the most turbulent years in
modern Iranian history.
