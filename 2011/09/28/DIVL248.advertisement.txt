Mistaken Identities:
How to Identify a
Roman Emperor
Thursday
September 29
6:oopm
Levinthal Hall
Stanford Humanities Center
424 Santa Teresa Street
Stanford University Campus
What did the Roman emperor look like? Among the
thousands of surviving Roman imperial marble heads, how do
we put a name to a face, or a face to a name? This lecture will
take a critical look at this process: it will not only question
some of our modern certainties about who is who, but it will
ask what we can learn from our mistakes.
One of Britain's best-known Classicists, Mary Beard is a
distinguished Professor of Classics at the University of
Cambridge and recently named Fellow of the British Academy.
Mary is also Classics editor of the Times Literary Supplement
and writes an engaging, often provocative, blog, A Don's Life.
