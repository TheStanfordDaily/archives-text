# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## Abroad and confused 
### Will Seaton 
You have no idea where you
are, who is around you or
why you're there. You have
no money, you can't do anything
quickly and you don't have any
where to go. Sounds like a bad
dream, right?
That about describes the first
couple hours of being abroad in a
foreign city. But I only need two
words to describe how I felt in Flo
rence: abroad and confused.
Even if you've taken the lan
guage for a few quarters or have
visited the country before, that
first moment when your host
family is talking to you quickly
and you're grasping onto words
you recognize as if you're reach
ing for life jackets tossed from a
sinking ship is overwhelming.
For me, stepping through the
front door and into the home of
Giuliana Calamandrei-Santini, an
80-year-old widow, was exactly
like that. Here was a woman a foot
and a half shorter, four lifetimes
older and much louder than I was.
She attempted to explain to me
how to lock the triple-locked front
door with a six-inch key, how
never to use more than one light in
the house at a time and how to
never (ever) touch anything in the
kitchen (ever!).
After getting whacked with my
general incompetence, I was

forced to take a brief walk around
the neighborhood to clear my
head and keep my sanity. Howev
er, it is remarkable how quickly
the language comes to you. I write
this five full days after I arrived in
Florence, and I just finished hav
ing a full and rewarding conversa
tion about Berlusconi (a nightly
topic at the dinner table and an
impressively disliked man).
I've spent many hours on the
Farm struggling to absorb (by os
mosis) some last-minute textbook
materials for class, with my head
just resting on pages trying to soak
it all in. Only now does simply
being around the Italian language
finally allow me to learn it. Before,
it would take me a week to learn a
simple list of kitchen vocabulary,
but here it takes me one or two
repetitions and the word is seared
into my memory.
One morning during orienta
tion, the program directors ex
plained to us some cultural differ
ences about Florence that we
should understand. For instance,
strangers on the street will never
say a word to each other but will
make eye contact for an insanely
long period of time. Italians never
drink cappuccino after lunch, and
you'll most likely be refused if
you ask for it. Buses run on what
ever schedule they feel like.
One of the most famous differ
ences, as everyone knows, is that
Italy has a much slower pace of
life. This can take the form of
waiting 30 minutes in a line for a
taxi when there are clearly more
taxis than people lined up, or it
can mean family dinners that last
two hours instead of two minutes.
But my favorite example of how
slow-moving it has been here oc
curred at a TIM store (a cellular
provider).
The time from my "buon
giorno" at the beginning of my
conversation with the sales lady
to my "ciao" at the end was a re
sounding one hour and 18 min
utes. I wanted to purchase some
thing that cost less than 10 euros.
Instead, I witnessed one of the
finest masters of procrastination I
shall ever see. My sales person
managed to have a cup of coffee,
two phone calls with friends, mul
tiple text conversations and a
brief chat with her coworker. She
even helped another customer
all while holding the tiny card I

needed for my phone the entire
time. By the time I ran out of the
store, I desperately needed a gela
to pick-me-up.
Being abroad is a lot to experi
ence, especially when you lose
most of the people you know,
places you recognize and posses
sions you have.
But despite it all, there are still
those moments you hoped for
when you first picked up your
plane tickets for that nine-hour
flight across the globe in tight,
dark, back-of-the-plane-near-the
bathroom seats.
Hiking up to Piazza Michelan
gelo today, I looked over the en
tire city of Florence at sunset,
soaking in the power and history
of one of the great jewels of West
ern civilization and seeing reflect
ed back my own hopes and aspira
tions for greatness. It is one of
those moments that will remain
with me and inspire me for a life
time and more. The daily mo
ments of respite are what make
me grateful for the opportunities
I have and the things I will experi
ence while away from my beloved
Stanford.
So after a few days, I'm ready
to add another word to my de
scription: abroad, confused and
happy.
