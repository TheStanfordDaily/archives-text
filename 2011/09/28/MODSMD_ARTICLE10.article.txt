# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## Abroad and confused 
### Will Seaton 
You have no idea where you
are, who is around you or
why you're there. You have
no money, you can't do anything
quickly and you don't have any
where to go. Sounds like a bad
dream, right?
That about describes the first
couple hours of being abroad in a
foreign city. But I only need two
words to describe how I felt in Flo
rence: abroad and confused.
Even if you've taken the lan
guage for a few quarters or have
visited the country before, that
first moment when your host
family is talking to you quickly
and you're grasping onto words
you recognize as if you're reach
ing for life jackets tossed from a
sinking ship is overwhelming.
For me, stepping through the
front door and into the home of
Giuliana Calamandrei-Santini, an
80-year-old widow, was exactly
like that. Here was a woman a foot

After getting whacked with my
general incompetence, I was

forced to take a brief walk around
the neighborhood to clear my
head and keep my sanity. Howev
er, it is remarkable how quickly
the language comes to you. I write
this five full days after I arrived in
Florence, and I just finished hav
ing a full and rewarding conversa
tion about Berlusconi (a nightly
topic at the dinner table and an
impressively disliked man).
I've spent many hours on the
Farm struggling to absorb (by os
mosis) some last-minute textbook
materials for class, with my head
just resting on pages trying to soak
it all in. Only now does simply
being around the Italian language
finally allow me to learn it. Before,
it would take me a week to learn a
simple list of kitchen vocabulary,
but here it takes me one or two
repetitions and the word is seared
into my memory.
One morning during orienta
tion, the program directors ex
plained to us some cultural differ
ences about Florence that we
should understand. For instance,
strangers on the street will never
say a word to each other but will
make eye contact for an insanely
