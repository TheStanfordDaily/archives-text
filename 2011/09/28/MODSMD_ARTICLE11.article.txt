## The 						Green Auditor 
### Amanda Ach 
This summer, I had jury duty
for the first time, I spent three
days waiting in the back of a
courtroom I missed my mas
sage appointment to uphold my
civic duty, so I was not pleased
and when the judge finally called
me forward to state "the informa
tion," the first question the de
fense attorney asked me was, "So,
you're a senior? And what do you
plan to do when you graduate?"
Like so many of you, I have no
idea what I'm going to do when
June rolls around and I'm released
into the wild. I've considered
everything from graduate school
to running off with the circus, but
nothing seems quite right for me.
Growing up in a Jewish family, I
believed from a young age that my
only two options were becoming a
lawyer or a doctor, but recent
Googling has proved that this is
not the case there are in fact
other jobs out there, and some of
them are even interesting. Though
I still haven't found exactly what
I'm looking for, I plan to share my
search with you by presenting a job
each week that you might not have
thought of or known about other
wise. We have great career counsel
ing resources on campus and I
am not one of them but I'm
going to write about some slightly
less conventional career paths that
I think are worth considering.
This week: the green auditor.
If you like the environment and
telling people they're wrong while
not sacrificing your love of the finer
things in life (read: eating), this one
might be for you. A green auditor is

like a tax auditor, only with a soul.
Companies hire green auditors to
evaluate their business practices
against an environmental code, find
where they fall short and help de
sign solutions to bring them to this
standard. Green auditors will also
sometimes evaluate the energy effi
ciency of building structures, both
corporate and private. In a world
where companies are desperate to
project a "green" image, green audi
tors are increasingly in demand.
As a green auditor, you would
likely be employed by a sustain
ability consulting firm, though
self-employment is another op
tion. You will also get the opportu
nity to do some local traveling, vis
iting companies and private
homes for on-site evaluations. As
much as I love a good road trip,
there are aspects of the job that
are even better. First and fore
most, you will be cutting emissions
and helping the environment,
which is incredibly rewarding. It is
much steadier employment than,
say, protesting, and you actually
get to make a difference. Because
it is a relatively new field, salary is
highly variable, but Internet re
ports place the average annual in
come of a green auditor some
where between $60,000 and
$102,000. Side note: If you do be
come a green auditor, it might be
nice to use some of that substantial
salary to take this columnist out
for a nice thank you dinner.
Now that you are thoroughly
excited about green auditing
and the chance to have dinner with
me we'll go over exactly how

someone gets into the field of sus
tainability consulting. Though the
qualifications for becoming a
green auditor are variable de
pending on the employer, the In
ternet and I recommend having a
background in environmental sci
ence, engineering, public policy,
energy-resource management or
any similar field. In addition, green
auditors must go through a certifi
cation process before they can
start laying down the green law.
There are several different types
of certification, each of which fo
cuses on different aspects of the
field some qualify you for eval
uating building structure, some for
analyzing electrical appliances
and others for examining business
practices. Regardless of which
type of certification you intend to
pursue, the best way to break into
the business is still with an intern
ship (surprise!), which can also
help you narrow down your inter
ests within the field.
Most jokes aside, sustainability
consulting is a great place to be
right now. In this difficult economy,
jobs that are on the rise are hard to
come by, and this one pays well too.
Oh, and there's the minor detail of
helping to save planet Earth.

still want to take Amanda out to din
