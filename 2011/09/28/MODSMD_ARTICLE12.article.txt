# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## The
						Art Department hates me 
### Jamie Solomon 
There has been a conspiracy to
prevent me from ever taking
an art class at Stanford; I'm
sure of it. For the most part, it's not
that hard to get into classes you
want here, a fact I'm blessedly re
minded of every time I see friends
from home. The one exception I've
found to this is our Studio Art De
partment. This is one of my eternal
frustrations at this school: I love
art, but it seems that the Depart
ment of Art & Art History wants
nothing to do with me.
In high school, the art room was
my second home. When I got to
Stanford, I seriously considered
being a studio art major or minor. I
was forced to drop that idea be
cause I could not manage to get my
foot in the door to take even one
art class. It's actually quite impres
sive; I believe I have been turned
away from art classes for every
possible reason.
At the start of freshman year, I
signed up for Painting I and Draw
ing I. I was in on Axess, so I
shopped another class during
Drawing I, only to find out later
that you have to show up to the
first class to get in. Lesson learned.
Then I went to Painting I; it was
honestly a little frightening. Thirty
five kids were crowded into a
paint-covered studio, and when the
professor announced he could only
take 12, everyone instantly became
unspoken enemies. Sideways
glances flew around the room as
everyone tried to assess if they
were more deserving than the rest.
This teacher gave priority to sen
iors, then juniors, then sopho

mores. As a freshman, I was given
an automatic goodbye.
Sophomore year, I was pumped
that I would have a better chance.
The third time's the charm, right? I
walked into Drawing I and was met
with the most ironic of all an
nouncements: this class was taught
by a different teacher who wanted
to make sure freshmen got oppor
tunities to try out the Art Depart
ment. He gave priority to freshmen
and seniors with sophomores at
the bottom of the list. I was out. So
I picked up my backpack, left and
put aside my hopes for majoring in
art. Although disillusioned, I was
still determined to try again.
However, in my one quarter on
campus junior year, I decided not
to waste Axess space on a class I
might not get into anyway. I walked
into the classroom for Painting I.
This teacher began by reading off
the list of those signed up on Axess
and asked everyone else to leave
immediately.
I just gave up. After three years
and four attempts, I could not get
into a single class. However sad or
pitiful this story may be, I do have a
point. From my experience and
from the estimated 90 other kids
who were also turned away from
the four classes I tried to get into,

it's clear that when it comes to art
instruction at Stanford, the de
mand is far outpacing the supply.
However, there is good news on
the horizon: the Stanford Arts Ini
tiative. The Studio Art and Art De
partments are gaining a new build
ing that will include studios and
classrooms, and construction is
slated to begin next year. I hope
that in the future, there will never
be another student like me at Stan
ford that feels shut out from a de
partment that he or she desperate
ly wants to participate in.
So my message to the heads of
the Institute for Creativity in the
Arts, professors John Berger and
Bryan Wolf, is this: please for
me and for the hundreds of other
kids that have also been turned
away from art classes make sure
to allocate enough money to the
needs of the students and not just
to raise the esteem of Stanford in
the eyes of the art world. Give your
students the space and the instruc
tors they need allow us to in
dulge our creativity. Give us stu
dios, rehearsal rooms, performance
spaces for student groups; give us
places with floors that you can
dance on and mirrors on the walls;
give us theaters with wings and
lights. Because if all a student is
doing is desperately trying to take
classes, no one should feel like an
entire department hates them
again.

The Art Department might hate
Jamie, but you don't, right? Let her
