## A Sox fan is sweating
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
It seems unfair to call it a collapse,
because what the Boston Red
Sox have managed to do in the
month of September going 7-
19 and squandering a nine-game lead
over the Tampa Bay Rays in the race
for the American League Wild Card
has been an utter meltdown. A
Mona Lisa of choking, if you will.
Now, as a card-carrying member
of Red Sox Nation, I have still been
sporting my Pedroia Destroy-ah
shirt and wearing my Jacoby Ellsbury
jersey with pride (I will save Ells
bury's MVP argument for a later, less
stressful date). And for the last week
or so, I walked around campus late at
night trying to convince myself that if
the Sox could just get into the play
offs, everything would be all right and
Terry Francona's club would stop
doing its best 2007 Mets impression.
It's not too late, as the Rays and
Red Sox are now tied with identical
90-71 records with one game left to
play in the regular season. And if Jon
Lester can make mincemeat of the
Orioles tomorrow night and the New
York Yankees stop letting the Rays
win (and yes, the Bombers are indeed
trying their best to lose these last few
games and keep the Sox out of the
playoffs), I could rest easy for a few
days.
But I don't see that happening.
The 2011 Red Sox are too much ma
chine and not enough man. The
championship teams from 2004 and
2007 both had distinctive team per
sonalities Kevin Millar's 'Cowboy
Up' was the rallying cry in 2004 and
2007 featured the Bash Brothers,
David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez,
with a dash of rookies, Pedroia and
Ellsbury. But this year has been a
struggle to find a team identity, as
newcomers Adrian Gonzalez and
Carl Crawford don't appear to have
any emotion if they hit .340 or .250,
respectively.
Sure, the lineup is a threat to
score 10 runs every night, but they
don't seem to know how to win the
games that matter the most. Against
the Rays, Boston has struggled
mightily, going 6-12 on the season
and 1-6 against Tampa in the final
month. Gonzalez has hit well below
the Mendoza Line against the Rays
all season, and Ellsbury and short
stop Marco Scutaro have seemingly
been the only ones able to hit any
thing when it counts.
In a city that eats, drinks and
breathes sports, the fans have had to
swallow the kind of pain that they
haven't experienced in a decade, the
kind of pain only inflicted by the
likes of Bucky F****** Dent, Bill
p****** Buckner and Aaron
F****** Boone.
And the players aren't immune to
the pain and anger flowing from the
hallowed stands at Fenway Park.
"If I was a fan, I'd be frustrated,
too," slugger David Ortiz said fol
lowing last Wednesday's 6-4 loss to
the Orioles. "I've been here, what,
nine years? I've never seen a col
lapse this bad."
I pray that the Red Sox can find
some way to dismiss the losses as a
fluke, a combination of misfortune
and a tiny pitching slump. But there
is no manual on how to survive a
late-season collapse, and when ru
mors are flying about which starting
pitcher your club is looking to trade
for just to start the 162 nd game of the
season, it's probably not a good sign.
(For the record, I would have been
just fine if General Manager Theo
Epstein picked up Pedro Martinez
and threw him out on the mound to
face the Orioles tonight.)
Thankfully, the Stanford bubble
seems to keep most of the Red Sox
haters away, so I have not had to en
dure much more than the occasional
chuckle from a passerby in a Yan
kees hat, or some good-natured rib
bing from my roommate, a Dodgers
fan who is still counting his blessings
that this story is bumping the Frank
McCourt saga from the limelight.
But if you happen to bump into
me on the steps of Hoover Tower
and it's after 7 p.m. tomorrow, don't
hesitate to call the police because it
will mean that the Red Sox have lost,
even after having the second-best
record in baseball for three months.
I'm going to need some serious talk
ing down.

If the fate of the Red Sox is anything
like that of his fantasy baseball team,
Miles is cruisin' for a bruisin'. Send
