# LIFE AFTER SKOV
## Young linebackers crucial to defense's continued success 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After a bye week to rest up and
prepare for the heart of the Pac-12
schedule, the Stanford football
team is echoing the same mantras
that facilitated the longest winning
streak in the country, even though
the team is now missing one of its
biggest stars.
The No. 6 Cardinal (3-0,1-0 Pac
-12) suffered a major blow last week
end when junior linebacker Shayne
Skov, the team's leading tackier, was
ruled out for the rest of the season
due to a knee injury suffered in the
first half of the Arizona game. How
ever, the Cardinal players don't ex
pect to see any serious setbacks
without their starting middle line
backer.
"I know our defense has other
linebackers that are ready and will
ing to step up and step in where
they're needed on defense," said
junior tight end Levine Toilolo.
"The whole defense is ready to put

in the work to fill in any slack that
there might be, but I think we have
a good rotation and our linebackers
are well prepared to step in."
Sophomore AJ Tarpley and jun
ior Jarek Lancaster will be asked to
step in and are expected to split du
ties in order to fill Skov's spot. Both
players have yet to see the field
much in their Stanford careers, with
Lancaster contributing mostly on
special teams last year and Tarpley
not seeing the field in his freshman
season.
But even though neither player
has notched a significant amount of
playing time so far, the linebacker
corps has faith that both players can
contribute right away, mostly be
cause of the open competition for
Owen Marecic's inside linebacker
job this past spring.
"It just kept everyone competi
tive, it meant that everyone's stay
ing sharp," said redshirt senior line
backer Max Bergen. "It's better if
you don't know who's starting so
everyone's on top of their play at all

times."
That experience, coupled with a
few small changes, should keep the
Stanford defense strong, Bergen
said.
"You've got to get more vocal,
just get used to communicating with
each other, which we already were
through camp, but I think we'll be
just fine," he said."Tarpley and Lan
caster are great players, and Skov's
still around to help us out."
Skov's nose for the football
made the Stanford defense a deadly
adversary on the ground, allowing
only 36 yards per game rushing
the best in the entire country so
any replacements certainly have big
shoes to fill. They will be challenged
early and often as Stanford's sched
ule now turns to a bevy of teams
that love to keep the ball out of the
air.
This week's test will be the
UCLA Bruins (2-2, 1-2), who, de
spite their lackluster record, can still
move the football effectively on the
ground. The Bruins rush for 214

yards a game thanks to their duo of
Johnathan Franklin and Derrick
Coleman, who have combined for
602 yards rushing and six touch
downs already. Last year, Franklin
rushed for f ,127 yards the 10th
most in UCLA history and was
second team All-Pac-10.
The Bruins' strong rushing at
tack means that the new lineback
ers will have to prove right away
that they can continue the outstand
ing level of play that Skov started in
the first three games of the season.
Tarpley and Lancaster will no doubt
be critical to the Cardinal's success
for the rest of the season as well,
particularly because the toughest
test remaining on Stanford's sched
ule is No. 9 Oregon (3-1,1-0), which
rushes for 299.5 yards per game, cur
rently sixth-best in the nation.
Of course, the new defenders
will have an opportunity to mesh
with the starters before that Oregon
test on Nov. 12, and the Cardinal is

After losing standout junior linebacker Shayne Skov (above) to a season-ending knee injury, the Cardinal will look to sophomore AJ Tarpley and
junior Jarek Lancaster to fill in on defense. Stanford will face its first test this weekend, with a home matchup against UCLA on Saturday night.
determined to maintain the busi
ness-as-usual attitude that has it sit
ting as the only remaining undefeat
ed team in the Pac-12.
"Honestly, into the season we just
focused on worrying about our

selves every game, we've got to focus
on what we have to do regardless of
who we're playing," Toilolo said. "I
don't really know what [Stanford
being the only undefeated Pac-12
team] says about the rest of the con
ference; we just have to worry about
what we're doing in practice and
every Saturday."
