## Talented squad shines in team, individual wins 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
With three of its top four scor
ing leaders back from last season,
the men's golf team felt confident it
could improve on its loss in the
NCAA Central Regional last year.
Coach Conrad Ray's recruiting
class was one of the best in the
country, and the Cardinal was con
tent to fly under the radar until it
counted.

But after a huge win over 10
top-25 teams in the Olympia
Fields/Fighting Illini Invitational
two weekends ago, and the indi
vidual title won by freshman
Patrick Rodgers at the same
event, it looks like Stanford won't
be able to sneak up on anyone
anytime soon.
The Cardinal had a 54-hole
total of 849, a whopping 16 strokes
better than No. 2 Oklahoma State
and No. 9 Auburn, who tied for
second. No. 3 Alabama carded the
final day's lowest score (+4) to fin
ish fourth at the Olympia Fields
Country Club North Course, but it
was the steady play of Rodgers
that turned heads in rainy condi
tions.
Entering the final round, the
Avon, Ind. native was eight
strokes back of the leader, Stan
ford sophomore Cameron Wilson.

But with the help of a calm,
steady putter, Rodgers made two
birdies and no bogeys to storm up
the leader board and run away
with a three-stroke victory (206, -
4) over Texas' Dylan Frittelli.
The last Stanford golfer to win
his first collegiate tournament was
Tiger Woods, who accomplished
the feat 17 years ago at the William
Tucker Invitational.
"It was a good steady round,"
Rodgers said of the final round 68.
"I made a lot of pars and I missed
a few birdie opportunities early,
but I made a few coming in. Some
thing I took from that round and
the tournament was that I could
win without playing my best golf.
"Coming off the Walker Cup I
didn't have my A game, and I did
n't have much time to prepare," he
added. "I was really proud of the
way I was able to scrap it around
and score my golf ball without hit
ting it great."
The Cardinal put on quite a
show in its first team win since the
Mauna Lani Invitational in Febru
ary 2010. Junior Andrew Yun fin
ished in third place, and Wilson
posted a career-best fourth-place
finish (despite shooting a final
round 76) as Stanford occupied
three of the top four slots.
"This was one of the largest
winning margins in my career,"
Ray told GoStanford.com. "It
takes five guys to win and all the
guys played well. Steve Kearney

had a solid round, Andrew Yun hung
in there. It was a great team win."
Kearney tied for 33rd with a 12-
over-par 222 and freshman Patrick
Grimes' finish tied for 46th at 15
over par.
Next up for the Cardinal is The

Prestige at PGA West, co-hosted
by Stanford and UC-Davis in La
Quinta, Calif., which will take place
Oct. 9to 11. It will be a good test for
the Card to see if it can follow up
the victory at Olympia on the Greg
Norman course, particularly since
there are just three remaining tour
naments in the shortened fall sea
son.
