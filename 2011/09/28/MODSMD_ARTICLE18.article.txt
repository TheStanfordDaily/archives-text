# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Catching up with junior golfer Sally Watson 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Junior golfer Sally Watson kicked
off her year with a bang, scoring
birdies on four of her last 12 shots
and sinking a 40-foot putt to capture
a come-from-behind individual title
and second place team finish at the
Cougar Cup hosted by Washington
State.The Daily had a chance to chat
with Watson about her passion for
the game of golf, living so far from
home and dreams for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
made you chose Stanford among all
the different schools that were re
cruiting you?
Sally Watson (SW): I think ultimate
ly I decided to come here because it
had the best combination of aca
demics and athletics. Stanford has a

fantastic athletics program, and the
golf range here is unbelievable, I
might be biased, but I think it's the
best in the country. And then obvi
ously the academic prestige of com
ing to Stanford was definitely a
strong pull as well. I feel like not only
does Stanford give me a great oppor
tunity to be successful in golf, but if I
decide after university that I don't
want to pursue a career as a profes
sional golfer, then a lot of other
doors have been opened, and I have
a lot of other opportunities in other
areas of my life.
TSD: How have you been able to
make the transition to living on the
West Coast and adjusting to being so
far from home in Scotland?
SW: It's probably tougher on my par
ents than on me. I'm so busy that
time seems to just fly by, but I miss

home. My sister used to be on the
East Coast playing golf at the Uni
versity of Tennessee, which was nice
because it was a smaller time differ
ence, and I could call her at night
time. But now she's graduated and
back home, so it's pretty much just
me over here. But ultimately I want
ed to play anywhere in America and
with the opportunities that I get at
Stanford, I wasn't going to turn any
of that down just because it's farther
away from home. My parents have
always encouraged us to travel, and
I'm pretty comfortable living
abroad.
TSD: How did you first get into the
game of golf? What was it that
sparked your love for the sport?
SW: I was about four years old when
I first started playing golf. We have a
house in a small village in Scotland,

and there's a little nine-hole golf
course, and all the kids just kind of
hack it around there. And they did
summer lessons, and it was like a
pound for a half-hour group lesson.
You just went, had a quick lesson and
then played nine holes. They had a
competition every Friday, and you'd
win like a golf ball if you came in
first. I've always been really compet
itive, so I started playing at a young
age. When I tore my ACL in my right
knee, it stopped me playing basket
ball, and I started playing more golf
and had some success in it. Just being
a competitive person, anything
you're successful at seems to make
you want to do more of it and contin
ue playing. The more success I've
had, the harder it makes me want to
work. What's tough about golf is it
just is a really tough game, and it
pushes you mentally to be super
strong and super tough. And I think
that stanchion can stand in other
areas of your life. I enjoy the chal
lenge and trying to overcome it. It's
kind of a never-ending quest trying
to get better.
TSD: What are your goals this sea
son with the Cardinal?
SW: I would like us to win a tourna
ment in each the fall and spring sea
sons. I think we're perfectly capable
of doing that. Obviously, in golf more
than other sports, it really does have
to be your week. With so many teams
in each tournament and everyone
these days playing at such a high
level, you need a few good breaks
here and there, and everyone has to
be really solid to win. Golf is very
much a day-to-day sport. Some days
you play fantastic, the next you go
out and feel like a 20-handicapper.
You even see it in the professionals
who go out and shoot a 69 one day
and 76 the next. By the end of the
year, I want us to be ranked in the
top five in the country. We all need to
keep getting better at performing
under pressure and performing as a
team. We need everyone to be firing
on all cylinders at the same time,
which can be tough.
TSD: Speaking of pressure, you sank
a pretty clutch putt recently. What
was it like to go out and win the indi
vidual title two weeks ago at the
Cougar Cup?
SW: The last day I was really focused

on the team. But I was really im
pressed with my performance on the
back nine. I kept hanging in there,
made some good birdie putts and
made some really clutch putts for
par. I stayed patient enough and
birdied the last two holes. And the
birdie on the last, that was a little
lucky. That [putt] was like 54 feet or
something. I paced it off to try and
get a better feel. I'm not going to say
there's that much skill in something
like that. You have to read it right
and hope you put the right pace on it,
but you need things to go your way
for the ball to drop. I'm very fortu
nate, but it was kind of nice to win the
outright title.
TSD: What are your aspirations in
golf after you graduate? Do you
have a goal in mind, or a dream you
want to realize?
SW: Yes, ultimately I want to become
the best golfer in the world, get that
No. 1 ranking. Obviously that's very
high aspirations and a tough goal.
But even some of the women playing
in the Solheim Cup last year, I've
played with them before in junior
events and beat them in tourna
ments. At this point, it's not that I
don't think I have the right game, it's
just learning how to do things more
consistently especially the good
things when it counts under pres
sure. I had a solid summer, working
on a lot of things and I think I defi
nitely want to turn professional after
school, not to just be a professional
and make the cut here and there, I
really want to try and compete and
get as high up the world rankings as
possible.
TSD: What is your favorite thing to
do on campus that is not golfing?
SW: I really love hanging out with
my team. There are only seven of us,
we're a small, wee team, but I really
love the girls. Relaxing with them
outside of a serious atmosphere
when we're at practice, it's pretty se
rious. I love the team golf aspect at
Stanford, I must say. It's an individ
ual sport and you're used to doing
that. But the team dynamic offers
just a different way of playing. We've
got a great team and it's fun to be out
here.

pound for a half-hour group lesson.
You just went, had a quick lesson and
then played nine holes. They had a
competition every Friday, and you'd
win like a golf ball if you came in
first. I've always been really compet
itive, so I started playing at a young
age. When I tore my ACL in my right
knee, it stopped me playing basket
ball, and I started playing more golf
and had some success in it. Just being
a competitive person, anything
you're successful at seems to make
you want to do more of it and contin
ue playing. The more success I've
had, the harder it makes me want to
work. What's tough about golf is it
just is a really tough game, and it
pushes you mentally to be super
strong and super tough. And I think
that stanchion can stand in other
areas of your life. I enjoy the chal
lenge and trying to overcome it. It's
kind of a never-ending quest trying
to get better.
TSD: What are your goals this sea
son with the Cardinal?
SW: I would like us to win a tourna
ment in each the fall and spring sea
sons. I think we're perfectly capable
of doing that. Obviously, in golf more
than other sports, it really does have
to be your week. With so many teams
in each tournament and everyone
these days playing at such a high
level, you need a few good breaks
here and there, and everyone has to
be really solid to win. Golf is very
much a day-to-day sport. Some days
you play fantastic, the next you go
out and feel like a 20-handicapper.
You even see it in the professionals
who go out and shoot a 69 one day
and 76 the next. By the end of the
year, I want us to be ranked in the
top five in the country. We all need to
keep getting better at performing
under pressure and performing as a
team. We need everyone to be firing
on all cylinders at the same time,
which can be tough.
TSD: Speaking of pressure, you sank
a pretty clutch putt recently. What
was it like to go out and win the indi
vidual title two weeks ago at the
Cougar Cup?
SW: The last day I was really focused

on the team. But I was really im
pressed with my performance on the
back nine. I kept hanging in there,
made some good birdie putts and
made some really clutch putts for
par. I stayed patient enough and
birdied the last two holes. And the
birdie on the last, that was a little
lucky. That [putt] was like 54 feet or
something. I paced it off to try and
get a better feel. I'm not going to say
there's that much skill in something
like that. You have to read it right
and hope you put the right pace on it,
but you need things to go your way
for the ball to drop. I'm very fortu
nate, but it was kind of nice to win the
outright title.
TSD: What are your aspirations in
golf after you graduate? Do you
have a goal in mind, or a dream you
want to realize?
SW: Yes, ultimately I want to become
the best golfer in the world, get that
No. 1 ranking. Obviously that's very
high aspirations and a tough goal.
But even some of the women playing
in the Solheim Cup last year, I've
played with them before in junior
events and beat them in tourna
ments. At this point, it's not that I
don't think I have the right game, it's
just learning how to do things more
consistently especially the good
things when it counts under pres
sure. I had a solid summer, working
on a lot of things and I think I defi
nitely want to turn professional after
school, not to just be a professional
and make the cut here and there, I
really want to try and compete and
get as high up the world rankings as
possible.
TSD: What is your favorite thing to
do on campus that is not golfing?
SW: I really love hanging out with
my team. There are only seven of us,
we're a small, wee team, but I really
love the girls. Relaxing with them
outside of a serious atmosphere
when we're at practice, it's pretty se
rious. I love the team golf aspect at
Stanford, I must say. It's an individ
ual sport and you're used to doing
that. But the team dynamic offers
just a different way of playing. We've
got a great team and it's fun to be out
here.

Junior golfer Sally Watson kicked
off her year with a bang, scoring
birdies on four of her last 12 shots
and sinking a 40-foot putt to capture
a come-from-behind individual title
and second place team finish at the
Cougar Cup hosted by Washington
State.The Daily had a chance to chat
with Watson about her passion for
the game of golf, living so far from
home and dreams for the future.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What
made you chose Stanford among all
the different schools that were re
cruiting you?
Sally Watson (SW): I think ultimate
ly I decided to come here because it
had the best combination of aca
demics and athletics. Stanford has a

fantastic athletics program, and the
golf range here is unbelievable, I
might be biased, but I think it's the
best in the country. And then obvi
ously the academic prestige of com
ing to Stanford was definitely a
strong pull as well. I feel like not only
does Stanford give me a great oppor
tunity to be successful in golf, but if I
decide after university that I don't
want to pursue a career as a profes
sional golfer, then a lot of other
doors have been opened, and I have
a lot of other opportunities in other
areas of my life.
TSD: How have you been able to
make the transition to living on the
West Coast and adjusting to being so
far from home in Scotland?
SW: It's probably tougher on my par
ents than on me. I'm so busy that
time seems to just fly by, but I miss

home. My sister used to be on the
East Coast playing golf at the Uni
versity of Tennessee, which was nice
because it was a smaller time differ
ence, and I could call her at night
time. But now she's graduated and
back home, so it's pretty much just
me over here. But ultimately I want
ed to play anywhere in America and
with the opportunities that I get at
Stanford, I wasn't going to turn any
of that down just because it's farther
away from home. My parents have
always encouraged us to travel, and
I'm pretty comfortable living
abroad.
TSD: How did you first get into the
game of golf? What was it that
sparked your love for the sport?
SW: I was about four years old when
I first started playing golf. We have a
house in a small village in Scotland,

and there's a little nine-hole golf
course, and all the kids just kind of
hack it around there. And they did
summer lessons, and it was like a
pound for a half-hour group lesson.
