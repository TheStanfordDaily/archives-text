## Elec Comm nominee confirmed Senate approves Adler as new elections chair 
### IVY NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The 13th Undergraduate Senate
convened for its first meeting of the
2011-12 academic year Tuesday,
confirming Adam Adler 'l2 as its
new Elections Commissioner and
discussing several upcoming bills.
Former Elections Commissioner
Stephen Trusheim 'l3 nominated
Adler at the Senate's final meeting
of the 2010-11 school year, but the
Senate postponed taking action
amid concerns that Adler then
the ASSU solicitors general (SG)
misused his discretionary power
as SG. After filing a complaint
against former ASSU Publications
Board co-director Alice Nam 'll
and former Senate Chair Madeline
Flawes 'l3 in response to their deci
sion to nominate Zachary Warma
'll to the position of publications
board co-director, Adler offered his
services as SG to the respondents, a
move to which Nam objected at last
year's final meeting.
Prior to his confirmation, Adler
fielded questions from the Senate,
which focused on his platform and
his involvement in the Flipside's
satirical request for a Segway in its
special fees budget proposal.
In his brief outline of his plans as
commissioner, Adler spoke of
working with the Constitutional
Council to redraft the election poli
cies to make them "more tight" and
to create an elections handbook de
tailing all election policies in "one
spot." He also spoke of plans to in
crease voter turnout and reach out
to the graduate student population,
a group that traditionally sees low
participation in the elections.
"The last commissioner was by
the book, but I want to build the
elections," Adler said. "I want to
make Stanford elections something
to be proud of."
Adler is the managing editor of
the Flipside, a position that he also
held at the time of the publication's
controversial Segway request. Al
though Adlers said the stunt was
not his idea, he said he supported it
"wholeheartedly" as a criticism of
the current special fees system.
Quoting Adler's comment in a
post by the Unofficial Stanford
Blog on the debate. Senator Ben
Laufer 'l2 expressed concerns that
Adler would misuse his position.
"You think that the special fees
process was ridiculous, and the way
you went about exposing that was

kind of, in my opinion, snake-like,"
Laufer said. "You went through the
process by exploiting the system in
and of itself. If you're in the position
of Elections Commissioner, my
concern is what you're going to do
to the process to exploit the sys
tem."
Adler stressed that he would en
sure to avoid conflicts of interest
during his term and said he would
appoint a "neutral" substitute to re
view cases where his involvement
might prompt accusations of
wrongdoing.
"I'm not Robert Mugabe I
want to avoid that," he said. "I man
age the elections; I don't want to
control them."
The Senate confirmed Adler's
nomination, with Senators Dan De
long 'l3 and Laufer abstaining. As
the Elections Commission is al
ready violating bylaws by falling
short of the required four members
to serve on the commission, the
Senate urged Adler to make filling
the position of assistant commis
sioner his highest priority.
The Senate also heard from pub
lications board chair Kate Abbott
'l2, who announced that the board

will hold its first all-editorial meet
ing next Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. and a
publications open house on Oct. 6
from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., both in Old
Union.The board is currently work
ing with Student Activities and
Leadership to determine better dis
tribution strategies for the publica
tions it oversees.
Appropriations Committee
Chair Brianna Pang 'l3 then pre
sented funding bills for the evening,
noting that Barrio Assistance, a tu
toring service group, asked for $7OO
to pay for unspecified damages to a
rental car.
President Michael Cruz 'l2
joined several senators in express
ing concern over the fact that many
student groups often use similarly
vague statements when requesting
budget modifications from the Ap
propriations Committee. The Sen
ate voted to table the bill until the
financial officer of Barrio Assis
tance could meet with the commit
tee to further explain its request.
The Senate approved all other
funding bills for the evening.
