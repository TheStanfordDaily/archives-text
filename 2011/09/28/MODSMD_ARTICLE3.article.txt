# Extended lib hours?
## ASSU-led task force lobbies for extended hours in Green Library 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
ASSU Senator Daniel DeLong 'l3 has been eval
uating students' desire for extended Green library
hours since he was elected this past spring. With help
from Deputy Chair Dan Ashton 'l4 and several stat
isticians, DeLong said he hopes to accurately gauge
students' interest and lobby on their behalf.
DeLong reached out to students before and after
he was elected, seeking to evaluate their needs and
concerns. He said one of the major responses he re
ceived concerned Green Library.
"Students didn't feel there was a safe 24-hour or
safe late night study space for students outside of their
dormitories," he said.
DeLong noted that librarians will make no capital

investments in Meyer, which currently includes a 24-
hour study room, because of its planned destruction.
DeLong sent out requests for students to join a
task force to examine this topic. He received 17 re
sponses three of whom were from ASSU mem
bers. He said they resisted the initial temptation to
send out a petition, claiming that University officials
do not take them as seriously.
"The last thing they want to see is a petition," De-
Long said. "Because it's very easy to sign a petition.
And who's not going to sign a petition saying, 'I want
lower taxes' and 'I want better education for my chil
dren?' Everyone's going to sign both of those,"
They also ruled out sending a mass email, citing
participation bias and bias from those who are con-

cerned about student life and li
brary hours. After Ashton worked
with professor of statistics Susan
Holmes with the goal of making
the survey statistically valid, they
decided to poll students through
random selection.
Delong said the survey will not
only be about library hours, as that
might introduce biases. Rather, it
will ask students to prioritize needs.
"If we find out students really
don't want hours at Green Library
extended, this is not an issue we're
going to pursue," he said.
DeLong said one complication to
the issue is that it may not be afford
able to keep Green Library open
longer. Because of the way the build
ing is designed, it cannot be closed
off in sections or fire safety codes
will be broken.
Prior to 2003, Green Library
hours were 8 a.m. to midnight on
Sundays though Thursdays, 8 a.m.
to 6 p.m. on Fridays and 8 a.m. to 9
p.m. on Saturdays. The hours were
extended for the 2008-2009 school
year to keep the library open until 2
a.m. Sunday through Thursday and
until 10 p.m. on Fridays. Because of
budget cuts, the hours were reduced
for the 2009-2010 school year, caus
ing the library to close an hour ear
lier at 1 a.m. Sunday to Thursday.
"We try to use available funds to
our advantage, and reducing hours
is one among a large number of
ways to preserve our core functions,
such as building collections," An

drew Herkovic, University Librari
an's Office director of communica
tions and development, wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Back in the
grim summer of 2009, we were
forced to eliminate more than 60
jobs, across all the library units and
functions, and it should come as no
surprise that services and hours, in
cluding Green's, were pared as a re
sult. Note specifically that the last
cutback in hours was purely a budg
etary decision."
Budgetary discussions for the
next school year begin in mid-late

fall quarter. DeLong, Ashton and
others are currently working to
build-in funding for extended hours
for the 2012-2013 school year. Al
tered hours not necessarily ex
tended is also a possibility.
According to DeLong, both
Provost John Etchemendy and
University Librarian Michael
Keller have discretionary funds
that could be used for this school
year to finance extended hours.
