DeLong sent out requests for students to join a
task force to examine this topic. He received 17 re

Long said. "Because it's very easy to sign a petition.
And who's not going to sign a petition saying, 'I want
lower taxes' and 'I want better education for my chil
dren?' Everyone's going to sign both of those,"
They also ruled out sending a mass email, citing
participation bias and bias from those who are con-
