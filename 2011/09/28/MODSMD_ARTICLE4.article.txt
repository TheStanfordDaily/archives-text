## Farber talks Texas-secession plan 
### JOSH HOYT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In Tuesday's talk titled "A
Constitutional Conversation with
Dan Farber: Why Rick Perry is
Wrong About Secession and
What the Answers Imply About
Federal Power," Farber, professor
of law at the University of Cali
fornia, Berkeley, gave a definitive
answer to the question, "Does
any state have the right to se
cede?".
The lecture, sponsored by the
Stanford Constitutional Law
Center, addresses a question that
has been revisited in recent
months because of the presiden
tial campaign of Governor Perry,
who said in a 2009 speech at a Tea
Party rally, "Texas is a unique
place. When we came in the union
in 1845, one of the issues was that
we would be able to leave if we de
cided to do that."
He continued by saying,
"We've got a great union ... but if
Washington continues to thumb
their [sic] nose at the American
people, who knows what may
come out of that?"
The answer, according to Far
ber, is definitely not a legal seces
sion from the United States. Far
ber believes that the founders of
the Constitution did not intend for
the union to be so loose as to allow

for a legal right to secede, a right
the South claimed during the Civil
War, if only because they gave the
federal government too much
power to assume the states were
sovereign. In his mind, however,
the issue wasn't made completely
clear until the Fourteenth Amend
ment to the Constitution was es
tablished.
In his paper, "The 14th
Amendment and the Unconstitu
tionality of Secession," on which
his talk was based, Farber wrote
that the 14th Amendment means
"no state can deprive any Ameri
can citizen of the privileges or im
munities of citizenship which
means that a state, for example,
cannot deprive a citizen of U.S. cit
izenship by seceding."
Farber also briefly addressed
another popular claim that Texas
has the special right to break itself
into five different states. In fact,
Texas does have this right, but Far
ber doubted it would ever happen
"because they would all want to be
called Texas." He also doubted
that the Constitutional "equal
footing" doctrine, stating that the
states must have equal legal rights,
would allow for a split, but admit
ted it is possible.
Rick Perry has since backed
away from any talk of secession,
going so far as to address it specif
ically on Fox News last week.

While not an issue of national im
mediacy, the potential for seces
sion has been something of a rally
ing cry for the Tea Party in Texas.
Farber, who was introduced as
a "big-D democrat," joked that
perhaps this outcome is not so

bad.
After all "if you can secede you
can also be expelled," he conclud
ed.
