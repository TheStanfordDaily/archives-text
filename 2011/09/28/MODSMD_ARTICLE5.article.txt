## UAR seeks feedback on advising Undeclared required to meet with advisors 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) reinstated manda
tory quarterly check-ins with pre
major advisors (PMAs) beginning
with the Class of 2014. With a year
under the program's belt, UAR is fa
cilitating feedback to try to further
improve the pre-major advising ex
perience at Stanford.
While the check-in program is
not completely new, it is a revision to
a past policy. Under the revision, stu
dents who have not declared a major
are now required to meet with
PMAs before they can enroll in
courses for the following quarter.
Due to adjustments to the Universi
ty's enrollment program, UAR is
now able to ensure that undeclared
students meet with their advisors by
placing a hold on their Axess ac
counts until they attend the meet
ings.
According to the 2010-11 UAR
Annual Report, the hold on enroll
ment was originally instated "to rein
force [UAR's] commitment that
every undeclared undergraduate
should have the benefit of regular
advice and guidance from an advi
sor."
Because incoming freshmen and
sophomores are now required to
meet with advisors quarterly, UAR
has prioritized matching students to
PMAs with whom they share a com
mon interest.
"The Approaching Stanford
questionnaire translates into groups
of possible majors, and the Academ
ic Director matches these descrip
tions with a PMA," said Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, dean of freshmen and
undergraduate advising.
Kirsti Copeland, director of Resi
dentially-Based Advising, oversees
the process as Academic Directors
coordinate students with their advi
sors.
