## UAR seeks feedback on advising Undeclared required to meet with advisors 
### LAURYN WILLIAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) reinstated manda
tory quarterly check-ins with pre
major advisors (PMAs) beginning
with the Class of 2014. With a year
under the program's belt, UAR is fa
cilitating feedback to try to further
improve the pre-major advising ex
perience at Stanford.
While the check-in program is
not completely new, it is a revision to
a past policy. Under the revision, stu
dents who have not declared a major
are now required to meet with
PMAs before they can enroll in
courses for the following quarter.
Due to adjustments to the Universi
ty's enrollment program, UAR is
now able to ensure that undeclared
students meet with their advisors by
placing a hold on their Axess ac
counts until they attend the meet
ings.
According to the 2010-11 UAR
Annual Report, the hold on enroll
ment was originally instated "to rein
force [UAR's] commitment that
every undeclared undergraduate
should have the benefit of regular
advice and guidance from an advi
sor."
Because incoming freshmen and
sophomores are now required to
meet with advisors quarterly, UAR
has prioritized matching students to
PMAs with whom they share a com
mon interest.
"The Approaching Stanford
questionnaire translates into groups
of possible majors, and the Academ
ic Director matches these descrip
tions with a PMA," said Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, dean of freshmen and
undergraduate advising.
Kirsti Copeland, director of Resi
dentially-Based Advising, oversees
the process as Academic Directors
coordinate students with their advi
sors.
Unlike the all-volunteer PMA
team, Academic Directors are "full
time, Ph. D.-level staff who might
also teach on campus," Copeland
said. These staff members have resi
dential offices and oversee the aca
demic progress of nearly 450 fresh
men and sophomores who live close
by.
"Matching is a really fun, in
tractable problem," Copeland said.
"We get to know the advisors and
what types of students they like.
Then, we read the students' respons
es and try to think of which advisor
the student would have a productive
conversation with."
The advisor selection process is
meticulous, as the eight Academic
Directors look at the academic and
personal interests of the advisors
and of all freshmen and finally hand

pair the two groups.
In a change that will make the
PMA role more manageable, 80
new PMAs have joined the pro
gram for the 2011-12 school year,
bringing the total to 310 advisors
from 230 a year ago. This increase
allows for each PMA to meet ad
visee groups of only six students in
stead of eight in 2010.
One common misconception is
that PMAs should reflect the stu
dents' prospective majors. Accord
ing to Copeland, this commonality
alone does not ensure a good rela
tionship.
"In their forms, students often
mention a number of different inter
ests," she said. "Sometimes, [students
and advisors] share a language,
sometimes a home town. It could be
anything."
Copeland said UAR understands
that academic interests of freshmen
are very likely to change within the
course of a year, so matches are
sometimes made based on a side in

terest. She challenges the freshman
class to "try to get to know enough
about their PMA to figure out why
they are paired" even if the connec
tion is not readily apparent.
As for the PMAs themselves,
Lythcott-Haims said the breakdown
of advisors is roughly one-third fac
ulty, one-third academic staff whose
primary role is to research and one
third non-academic staff, including
staff in student affairs and athletics
and alumni. All advisors must have
an advanced degree.
"If you have an advanced degree,
you are able to appreciate the under
graduate experience that much
more," Lythcott-Haims said.
LIAR continues to adjust the pro
gram to fit students' needs and has
solicited the feedback of the Class of
2014 through a recent survey as
well as by listening to the advising
experiences of ASSU Undergradu
ate Senators Janani Ramachandran
'l4 and Karl Kumodzi 'l4.
Both students volunteered to

speak at a PMA training session and
expect their contributions to be con
sidered in future years. The commit
tee Ramachandran heads on the
Senate, Academic Affairs, also plans
to approach UAR about increasing
peer-to-peer mentoring within aca
demic departments.
While the program seeks contin
ued improvement, the promise of
the mandatory advising program is
evident in the fact that UAR saw an
increase in sophomores who recon
nected with their PMAs, Copeland
said. She believes this is due to the
fact that freshmen were required to
meet with their advisors.
"[Sophomores] got back in touch
and really took advantage of the re
source," Copeland said.
These PMAs are not compensat
ed any more than an occasional free

lunch at the Faculty Club. Lythcott-
Haims said they advise simply for a
reason that she labels "psychic cur
rency" or the reward of hearing a
freshman or sophomore advisee say,
"you made a difference in my life" or
"I appreciate you."
Feedback indicates that advisors
often reap as much from the pro
gram as their advisees do.
"Serving as a Pre-Major Advisor
has been extremely enjoyable and
rewarding," Jennifer Dionne, assis
tant professor of material science
and engineering, said. "I have en
joyed reconnecting with my 18-year
old self through the experiences of
my advisees. They are a joy to work
with."

from 230 a year ago. This increase
allows for each PMA to meet ad
visee groups of only six students in
stead of eight in 2010.
One common misconception is
that PMAs should reflect the stu
dents' prospective majors. Accord
ing to Copeland, this commonality
alone does not ensure a good rela
tionship.
"In their forms, students often
mention a number of different inter
ests," she said. "Sometimes, [students
and advisors] share a language,
sometimes a home town. It could be
anything."
Copeland said UAR understands
that academic interests of freshmen
are very likely to change within the
course of a year, so matches are
sometimes made based on a side in

terest. She challenges the freshman
class to "try to get to know enough
about their PMA to figure out why
they are paired" even if the connec
tion is not readily apparent.
As for the PMAs themselves,
Lythcott-Haims said the breakdown
of advisors is roughly one-third fac
ulty, one-third academic staff whose
primary role is to research and one
third non-academic staff, including
staff in student affairs and athletics
and alumni. All advisors must have
an advanced degree.
"If you have an advanced degree,
you are able to appreciate the under
graduate experience that much
more," Lythcott-Haims said.
LIAR continues to adjust the pro
gram to fit students' needs and has
solicited the feedback of the Class of
2014 through a recent survey as
well as by listening to the advising
experiences of ASSU Undergradu
ate Senators Janani Ramachandran
'l4 and Karl Kumodzi 'l4.
Both students volunteered to

speak at a PMA training session and
expect their contributions to be con
sidered in future years. The commit
tee Ramachandran heads on the
Senate, Academic Affairs, also plans
to approach UAR about increasing
peer-to-peer mentoring within aca
demic departments.
While the program seeks contin
ued improvement, the promise of
the mandatory advising program is
evident in the fact that UAR saw an
increase in sophomores who recon
nected with their PMAs, Copeland
said. She believes this is due to the
fact that freshmen were required to
meet with their advisors.
"[Sophomores] got back in touch
and really took advantage of the re
source," Copeland said.
These PMAs are not compensat
ed any more than an occasional free

lunch at the Faculty Club. Lythcott-
Haims said they advise simply for a
reason that she labels "psychic cur
rency" or the reward of hearing a
freshman or sophomore advisee say,
"you made a difference in my life" or
"I appreciate you."
Feedback indicates that advisors
often reap as much from the pro
gram as their advisees do.
"Serving as a Pre-Major Advisor
has been extremely enjoyable and
rewarding," Jennifer Dionne, assis
tant professor of material science
and engineering, said. "I have en
joyed reconnecting with my 18-year
old self through the experiences of
my advisees. They are a joy to work
with."

Undergraduate Advising and
Research (UAR) reinstated manda
tory quarterly check-ins with pre
major advisors (PMAs) beginning
with the Class of 2014. With a year
under the program's belt, UAR is fa
cilitating feedback to try to further
improve the pre-major advising ex
perience at Stanford.
While the check-in program is
not completely new, it is a revision to
a past policy. Under the revision, stu
dents who have not declared a major
are now required to meet with
PMAs before they can enroll in
courses for the following quarter.
Due to adjustments to the Universi
ty's enrollment program, UAR is
now able to ensure that undeclared
students meet with their advisors by
placing a hold on their Axess ac
counts until they attend the meet
ings.
According to the 2010-11 UAR
Annual Report, the hold on enroll
ment was originally instated "to rein
force [UAR's] commitment that
every undeclared undergraduate
should have the benefit of regular
advice and guidance from an advi
sor."
Because incoming freshmen and
sophomores are now required to
meet with advisors quarterly, UAR
has prioritized matching students to
PMAs with whom they share a com
mon interest.
"The Approaching Stanford
questionnaire translates into groups
of possible majors, and the Academ
ic Director matches these descrip
tions with a PMA," said Julie Lyth
cott-Haims, dean of freshmen and
undergraduate advising.
Kirsti Copeland, director of Resi
dentially-Based Advising, oversees
the process as Academic Directors
coordinate students with their advi
sors.
Unlike the all-volunteer PMA
team, Academic Directors are "full
time, Ph. D.-level staff who might
also teach on campus," Copeland
said. These staff members have resi
dential offices and oversee the aca
demic progress of nearly 450 fresh
men and sophomores who live close
by.
"Matching is a really fun, in
tractable problem," Copeland said.
"We get to know the advisors and
what types of students they like.
Then, we read the students' respons
es and try to think of which advisor
the student would have a productive
conversation with."
The advisor selection process is
meticulous, as the eight Academic
Directors look at the academic and
personal interests of the advisors
and of all freshmen and finally hand

pair the two groups.
In a change that will make the
PMA role more manageable, 80
new PMAs have joined the pro
gram for the 2011-12 school year,
bringing the total to 310 advisors
from 230 a year ago. This increase
allows for each PMA to meet ad
visee groups of only six students in
stead of eight in 2010.
