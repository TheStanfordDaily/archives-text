## Protesting 101 SIG Fellow experiences student protests in Chile 
### THOMAS HENDEE 
Some experiences are expected on a
Stanford in Government International
Fellowship practicing the local lan
guage, eating new kinds of food, be
friending locals and being introduced
to a new sector of work. But in Santiago, Chile,
I found myself thrown into Protesting 101: An
Introduction to Revolution.
Santiago on your average day is one of the
most orderly cities in South America. Drivers
follow the road signs, pedestrians have the right
of way and crime rates are the lowest in the re
gion. The late June day I arrived in my down
town apartment was not to be an average day.
The once orderly downtown area was chaos in
amid the ongoing student protests that had con
sumed Chile's public education system for over
a month.Tear gas, water-spraying military tanks
and thousands of military police descended on
areas with congregating groups.
A month before my arrival, high school and
university students started to take over their
schools and went on strike. The students had
last rallied together demanding comprehensive
education reform in 2006, but the scale of
protests in this "Chilean winter" had never be
fore been seen. The movement's key demands
were quality public education, profit-free pri
vate schools and a revised system for students
to receive education loans.
Walking through the streets of downtown
Santiago, 1 saw and heard the people's
thoughts. At one protest, a man on stilts
dressed as Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean general and dictator, carried puppet
strings connected to another man dressed as
the current president, Sebastian Pinera. I saw
hundreds of students fake a mass suicide, rep
resenting the nihilism they claimed to en
counter in their educational aspirations. I saw
an elderly couple holding hands and a sign that
read, "Students, know that your grandparents
support you." The songs of the protesters of
fered me a glimpse of their views:

"Educate the children and you will not need
to punish the adults."
I have two children, which one do I educate?
If you want to study in Chile, go buy yourself
a lottery ticket.
Pinera why don't you talk so we know you
exist!"
At night I participated in the cacerolazos, a
way to protest the government's policy by
banging pots and pans. I stood on my balcony
banging on a pot, hearing thousands of others
doing the same. The first week I was in Chile I
heard a similar rallying cry when the Chilean
National soccer team won a game in the Copa
America, but the cacerolazos brought the noise
to another level.
Everything around me proved that the
movement came from all parts of society, but
the media consistently focused on the vandal
ism and delinquents who took the streets along
with protesters. Watching the news at night, I
would not hear about the hundreds of thou
sands of people I saw singing and cheering for a
better future, but rather about the police con
frontations with a small group of violent citizens
who had no connection to the student leaders.
The movement hit a rough patch on Aug. 5,
when the government declined to let the stu
dents protest on Santiago's main avenue. Con
frontations between the police and the enca
puchados, groups of hooded protesters, ensued.
I witnessed park benches ripped out of their
place and moved to blockade the streets, rocks
thrown at police officers and graffiti. The police
detained 800 people, and more than 40 were in
jured. The media highlighted the destruction
and blamed the students for damaging the state
of the country.
Nevertheless, the student protesters came
together and stood up for their demands. Nego
tiations with the government on education re
forms are set to begin soon, although the at
mosphere in Chile is still tense.
