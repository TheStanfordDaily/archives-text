## EDITORIAL New York campus brings promise, risk 
### 
Amid its wide avenues and
towering skyscrapers, it's
easy to forget that New
York City began as a small collec
tion of homes outside an unimpos
ing Dutch fort nearly four cen
turies ago. Though New York's as
cension to world city status might
seem inevitable to modern ob
servers, its present success is, in
large part, the result of many con
scious historical decisions.
Whether this meant the building of
harbors, the financing of canals or
the laying of railroads, New York
took the necessary steps to remain
at the cutting edge while compara
ble cities like Baltimore, Philadel
phia and Boston fell behind. One
decade into the 21st century, how
ever, New York's preeminence is
threatened. The firms that have
dominated the digital age are over
whelmingly anchored elsewhere,
particularly in Silicon Valley. As
Stanford bids against other univer
sities for the right to operate a New
York campus, Stanford's appeal
rests largely on the idea that it can
create a hub of engineering inno
vation in the Big Apple in the mold
of the University's Silicon Valley
milieu.
Likewise, a New York campus
has a great deal of appeal for Stan
ford. Stanford's symbiotic relation
ship with Silicon Valley has worked
well for it in the past, yet future suc
cess often requires bold action in
the face of opportunity. Many peo
ple thought that Leland Stanford
was crazy when he announced his
intention to build a first-class uni
versity on the West Coast. But Mr.
Stanford knew that he had only
one chance, and today the entire
Stanford community benefits from
his decision. The chance to build a
campus in America's largest city is
another such opportunity. Stanford
has made no secret of its enthusi
asm for the expansion, but it must,
if selected, see to it that the campus
is designed with the best interests
of the University in mind.
To simply build a miniature
replica of Stanford in a new setting
would be the wrong approach and
potentially an expensive distrac
tion from the main campus. Stan
ford has succeeded largely because

of the powerful network effects
that accompany its concentration
and diversity of talent, and it would
be a shame to see this dynamism di
minished because of potential di
version of faculty and resources to
New York. These non-financial
costs of the expansion are neces
sarily speculative and nebulous,
but they should be seriously stud
ied and weighed before any final
decisions are made.
If a New York campus is to suc
ceed, it must complement Stan
ford's current offerings, not com
pete with them. Stanford's Hop
kins Marine Station, though much
smaller than the proposed New
York expansion, demonstrates the
concept quite well. Hopkins Ma
rine Station takes advantage of its
location on the Monterey Bay and
adjacent to Monterey's world fa
mous aquarium to play a leading
role in research that it would other
wise have no part in. Hopkins also
provides opportunities for gradu
ate students, recent graduates and
even undergraduates to study the
ecology of the California coast. In
New York, Stanford must take a
similar approach, identifying which
unique firms, institutions and Uni
versity constituencies stand to ben
efit most from partnerships in New
York, and building the new campus
around those prospects. Though
the focus of the campus should and
will be on graduate education, it
would be a shame to neglect under
graduates entirely. Since engineer
ing students often have trouble
studying abroad due to the heavy,
linear nature of their course work, it
would be wonderful if such stu
dents were given an opportunity to
study at the New York campus for
a quarter if they so choose.
Whatever the outcome of the
bidding process, New York will
gain a prominent center of gradu
ate engineering education, and
perhaps sow the seeds of future
economic success. By participating,
Stanford has positioned itself for a
rare opportunity to bolster its place
in the world of higher education.
Whether the opportunity will en
hance Stanford's goals to advance
learning and public service or dis
tract from them remains to be seen.
