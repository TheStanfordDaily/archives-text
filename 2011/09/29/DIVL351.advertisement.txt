Ms. magazine has brought us forty years of groundbreaking
feminist reporting. Now it's your turn to join the
conversation. Send in a 150-word essay telling us what one
of the 40 iconic Ms. covers means to you. How does this
cover reflect or shape your own life? How do you envision
the future of feminism?
About the Contest
Ten $lOO cash prizes will be awarded for the best short
essays. Winning entries will be displayed alongside the
Ms. covers on the Stanford campus in January 2012.
