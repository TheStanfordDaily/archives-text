### Tiffany Li 
Meet the Startup Kid. The
Startup Kid is the Organi
zation Kid that speed
reads "The Organization Kid"
Organization Kid 2.0, if you will.
The Startup Kid pursues his life
with a kind of intellectual, deliber
ate interest, somehow emotionally
detached even as he runs charity
5Ks and takes pottery. You get the
feeling that somewhere there's a
list where he needs to cross off:
"Enjoy various athletic and artistic
pursuits" and "Achieve minimum
viable soul."
The Startup Kid's heroes are
Steve Jobs, Gandhi and the Insta
gram guys.The Startup Kid, like the
Organization Kid, wants to be in
the top one percent, but a .01 per
cent implementer, or a .01 percent
design thinker or a .01 percent-par
adigm shifter. His brain seems to
have, by and large, become a white
board covered in graphs going up
wards, and everything and every
one has their own color-coded post
it. Startup Kids are creative and
therefore don't need the more ob
vious gold stickers of their Wall
Street or consultancy counterparts,
but don't think they're not ambi
tious. By striving for the nebulous,
the Startup Kid aims to be übiqui
tous; he doesn't want to be the Man
he wants to be the System, the
Platform, the context for every
thing his smaller-minded class
mates will do.
The Startup Kid believes in data
and metrics. Nothing is unquantifi
able, and at the very least there's
some data visualization software
for it. Self-discovery? There's an
app for that. Empathy? It can be
learned in a workshop. His view of
history is profoundly teleological,
not that he thinks much of history.
The Startup Kid doesn't have
enough time for history. The Start
up Kid feeds history, national fla
vor, cultural quirks, into the same
lean, mean winning-machine as
whimsy, romance, spontaneity, ges
ture, immaturity, joy, personal de
velopment — these are sacrificed
for ambition presented so whole
somely we often fail to appreciate
its ferocity.
This certain kind of ambition is,
I believe, currently being ex
pressed in the ASSU Executive.
This is not to say The Startup Kid is
a real person or that he is part of
the ASSU but the attitude is
real, and present.
The Project Management and
Implementation team aims to
make the ASSU "an omnipresent,
ultra-efficient powerhouse," ac
cording to its official "blueprint."
Everyone from the Health and
Wellness team to the Asian and
Pacific Islander community team
wants to use or build a new kind of
app, as stated in their blueprints.
The Food team is holding a
hackathon. The Co-Chairs of En
trepreneurship want to identify
qualifying student entrepreneurs
and treat them like athletes
giving them "excused absences
when travelling to business-relat
ed events," as quoted in the Chair

of Entrepreneurship "E 2.0" out
line.
According to the Chair of Tech
nology's outline, the team wants to
"gamify" your Stanford experi
ence, giving you, say, "turn in home
work +10."
Design thinking is given its own
chair and seems to be a slice of
everyone's plan, as does hyper-ag
gressive marketing (question: does
good government need to be mar
keted?). Several teams mention
using the ASSU's email capabilities
to send out mass event promotions.
The ASSU hopes to establish a
strategy that sends "targeted"
emails to, say, "Nebraskan ath
letes," according to the Project
Management and Implementation
blueprint.
But this is not just about the
sanctity of my inbox. This is about
the fact that in response to com
plaints about the length of his
emails, the VP created the position
of Director of Internal Review, ac
cording to Co-Chair of Entrepre
neurship Dan Thompson in a previ
ous interview with The Daily. This
sounds to me like creating a sound
pollution task force because your
neighbor asked you to use head
phones.
But what bothers me most about
the ASSU is the vagueness of
everything it wants to accomplish. I
know "vagueness" doesn't sound
very nefarious, but the more vague
the goal, the fewer limits an organi
zation has upon it. Take the war on
poverty for instance never going
to end, so can justify anything.
Might not the ASSU declare a war
on apathy? Loneliness? Non-entre
preneurialism?
Entrepreneurship is a word so

You cannot
hacklife.You
cannot conjure
community. And
you can't fake
selflessness.
vague that it alternates between
being totally meaningless and the
meaning of life. It encompasses
an activity, a methodology, a
mindset and even a lifestyle
wide-ranging in the problems it
can solve and, for many, com
pletely absorbing. But it's worth
remembering that this world of
whiteboards, sticky notes, jeans

and blazers, arrogant hashtags,

very, very specific. We need per

You can't really make mistakes
living off of a to-do list. You can't

screen. You cannot hack life. You

Meet the Startup Kid. The
Startup Kid is the Organi
zation Kid that speed
reads "The Organization Kid"
Organization Kid 2.0, if you will.
The Startup Kid pursues his life
with a kind of intellectual, deliber
ate interest, somehow emotionally
detached even as he runs charity
5Ks and takes pottery. You get the
feeling that somewhere there's a
list where he needs to cross off:
"Enjoy various athletic and artistic
pursuits" and "Achieve minimum
viable soul."
The Startup Kid's heroes are
Steve Jobs, Gandhi and the Insta
gram guys.The Startup Kid, like the
Organization Kid, wants to be in
the top one percent, but a .01 per
cent implementer, or a .01 percent
design thinker or a .01 percent-par
adigm shifter. His brain seems to
have, by and large, become a white
board covered in graphs going up
wards, and everything and every
one has their own color-coded post
it. Startup Kids are creative and
therefore don't need the more ob
vious gold stickers of their Wall
Street or consultancy counterparts,
but don't think they're not ambi
tious. By striving for the nebulous,
the Startup Kid aims to be übiqui
tous; he doesn't want to be the Man
he wants to be the System, the
Platform, the context for every
thing his smaller-minded class
mates will do.
The Startup Kid believes in data
and metrics. Nothing is unquantifi
able, and at the very least there's
some data visualization software
for it. Self-discovery? There's an
app for that. Empathy? It can be
learned in a workshop. His view of
history is profoundly teleological,
not that he thinks much of history.
The Startup Kid doesn't have
enough time for history. The Start
up Kid feeds history, national fla
vor, cultural quirks, into the same
lean, mean winning-machine as
whimsy, romance, spontaneity, ges
ture, immaturity, joy, personal de
velopment — these are sacrificed
for ambition presented so whole
somely we often fail to appreciate
its ferocity.
This certain kind of ambition is,
I believe, currently being ex
pressed in the ASSU Executive.
This is not to say The Startup Kid is
a real person or that he is part of
the ASSU but the attitude is
real, and present.
The Project Management and
Implementation team aims to
make the ASSU "an omnipresent,
ultra-efficient powerhouse," ac
cording to its official "blueprint."
Everyone from the Health and
Wellness team to the Asian and
Pacific Islander community team
wants to use or build a new kind of
app, as stated in their blueprints.
The Food team is holding a
hackathon. The Co-Chairs of En
trepreneurship want to identify
qualifying student entrepreneurs
and treat them like athletes
giving them "excused absences
when travelling to business-relat
ed events," as quoted in the Chair

of Entrepreneurship "E 2.0" out
line.
According to the Chair of Tech
nology's outline, the team wants to
"gamify" your Stanford experi
ence, giving you, say, "turn in home
work +10."
Design thinking is given its own
chair and seems to be a slice of
everyone's plan, as does hyper-ag
gressive marketing (question: does
good government need to be mar
keted?). Several teams mention
using the ASSU's email capabilities
to send out mass event promotions.
The ASSU hopes to establish a
strategy that sends "targeted"
