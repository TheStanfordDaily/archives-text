# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## A 						morning jolt 
### Leslie Brian 
For most of us, the sound of an
alarm clock is tantamount to
impending doom. Who does
n't shudder at the thought of the
synthesized marimba chime of an
iPhone? —or at the alarm clock
that grins obnoxiously and chirps
"Good morning!" when all you
want to do is beat its little electric
cogs into a pile of scrap metal? Sure,
it can smile; you 're still the one who
has to face the day.
It's a hot mess: you stumble or
trip out of bed and over your book
bag, pull on a pair of Nike running
shorts and a Stanford sweatshirt,
grab an apple if you're lucky and
bike to class, where you sit in a stu
por until you can spare a moment to
buy coffee. The mess, of course, gets
even hotter if special dinner from
the night before resulted in your
waking up and rolling into a Stats
class still wearing your Scooby Doo
costume from CarToyon Network,
but let's not go there.

That said, I'm going to make a
heretical statement.
I'm a recent morning convert.
Nothing grounds me better than
the serene sense of calm that wash
es over me in the still, crisp morn
ing air. I have come to cherish my
morning ritual. After six months
abroad, I spent the past month at
home indulging in much-needed
recuperation. Every morning, I'd
wake up early, put in my iPod ear
buds and walk over to my neigh
borhood cafe for a cup of their
vanilla nut coffee. Now, I've always
wanted to be the kind of person
who takes her coffee black. I mean,
think about it: black coffee
drinkers just radiate the kind of
super intense, no nonsense, go-get
ter energy that I thrive on. Cream
and sugar were for wusses; sur
vivors drank black coffee. It was
sort of a I'm-hardcore-therefore
my-coffee-must-also-be-a-symbol-
of-my-intensity mentality.

But after almost five years of en
during the foul bitter liquid, I want
to make something very clear: I do
not like my coffee black. In fact,
there is nothing better than a cup of
vanilla nut or hazelnut coffee with
whole milk (gasp!) or dare I say
it? half and half with Splenda
(okay, I haven't quite gotten to
using real sugar yet, but I'm taking
baby steps). I realize my coffee
doesn't scream "intense," but to me,
it is perfect. I like the blend so much
that I brought a huge bag of it with
me back to Stanford. From the feel
ing of the French press as it yields
ever so gently to the firm push of my
palm, to the aroma that accompa
nies its preparation, to the tendrils

of white that unfurl in the mug as I
pour just enough creamer to turn
the coffee that wonderful shade of
milky brown, to the rich, hint-of
sweet, nutty taste, it is perfection in
a mug. I close my eyes and exhale
deeply.That very first sip warms me
with the comfort that no matter
what has happened before it's a
new day with new opportunities
just waiting to be explored. Life
goes on, as beautiful and abundant
as ever.
Sure, I make sacrifices. For a
Stanford senior, waking up at 7:30
a.m. is not exactly the recipe for a
wild night on the town. But even
with the craziness that comes with
fall classes and activities, I'm fight
ing to keep those mornings.
So here's a challenge for the rest
of you: consecrate mornings to
yourself. Maybe you're not a coffee
person, but find your favorite blend
of tea and cherish the process of
making and enjoying it. Prepare
and savor a good breakfast, what
ever that may be for you truly,
being a breakfast person is awe
some. Take that time to set a won
derful tone for your day.
But more importantly, pause.
Look around, if only for a few

short seconds, to see how unbeliev
ably amazing this world is, and how
beauty can be found in everything
if we take the time to notice and
appreciate it. Trust me, 10 or 15
minutes in the morning can put a
smile on your face for the rest of
the day.
That's the kind of little moment
I cherish. Those small perfections of
life that remind you just how amaz
ing the world is and cause the cor
ners of your mouth to turn up ever
so slightly. The sights, smells,
sounds, tastes, noises and experi
ences that make you pause and go,
"God, life is just too good, isn't it?"
This column is dedicated to
those moments. To the little things
in life. To taking the time to recog
nize them and appreciate them
throughout the day. To that perfect
cup of coffee in the morning. Or to
how the gentle, crisp morning sun
light differs from the harsher heat
of the afternoon. To the moment
when the pace of my feet match the
rhythm of my favorite song as I
walk along the tree-lined avenue
back to my home. In that moment, I
know that everything will be okay,
that I'm okay and that the world is
okay. And that life, for all its ups
and downs, is still beautiful. Those
are the moments I live for.

I cherish. Those small perfections of
life that remind you just how amaz
ing the world is and cause the cor
ners of your mouth to turn up ever
so slightly. The sights, smells,
sounds, tastes, noises and experi
ences that make you pause and go,
"God, life is just too good, isn't it?"
This column is dedicated to
those moments. To the little things
in life. To taking the time to recog
nize them and appreciate them
throughout the day. To that perfect
cup of coffee in the morning. Or to
how the gentle, crisp morning sun
light differs from the harsher heat
of the afternoon. To the moment
when the pace of my feet match the
rhythm of my favorite song as I
walk along the tree-lined avenue
back to my home. In that moment, I
know that everything will be okay,
that I'm okay and that the world is
okay. And that life, for all its ups
and downs, is still beautiful. Those
are the moments I live for.

For most of us, the sound of an
alarm clock is tantamount to
impending doom. Who does
n't shudder at the thought of the
synthesized marimba chime of an
iPhone? —or at the alarm clock
that grins obnoxiously and chirps
"Good morning!" when all you
want to do is beat its little electric
cogs into a pile of scrap metal? Sure,
it can smile; you 're still the one who
has to face the day.
It's a hot mess: you stumble or
trip out of bed and over your book
bag, pull on a pair of Nike running
shorts and a Stanford sweatshirt,
grab an apple if you're lucky and
bike to class, where you sit in a stu
por until you can spare a moment to
buy coffee. The mess, of course, gets
even hotter if special dinner from
the night before resulted in your
waking up and rolling into a Stats
class still wearing your Scooby Doo
costume from CarToyon Network,
but let's not go there.

That said, I'm going to make a
heretical statement.
I'm a recent morning convert.
Nothing grounds me better than
the serene sense of calm that wash
es over me in the still, crisp morn
ing air. I have come to cherish my
morning ritual. After six months
abroad, I spent the past month at
home indulging in much-needed
recuperation. Every morning, I'd
wake up early, put in my iPod ear
buds and walk over to my neigh
borhood cafe for a cup of their
vanilla nut coffee. Now, I've always
wanted to be the kind of person
who takes her coffee black. I mean,
think about it: black coffee
drinkers just radiate the kind of
super intense, no nonsense, go-get
ter energy that I thrive on. Cream
and sugar were for wusses; sur
vivors drank black coffee. It was
sort of a I'm-hardcore-therefore
my-coffee-must-also-be-a-symbol-
of-my-intensity mentality.

But after almost five years of en
during the foul bitter liquid, I want
to make something very clear: I do
not like my coffee black. In fact,
there is nothing better than a cup of
vanilla nut or hazelnut coffee with
whole milk (gasp!) or dare I say
it? half and half with Splenda
(okay, I haven't quite gotten to
using real sugar yet, but I'm taking
baby steps). I realize my coffee
doesn't scream "intense," but to me,
it is perfect. I like the blend so much
that I brought a huge bag of it with
me back to Stanford. From the feel
ing of the French press as it yields
ever so gently to the firm push of my
palm, to the aroma that accompa
nies its preparation, to the tendrils

of white that unfurl in the mug as I
pour just enough creamer to turn
the coffee that wonderful shade of
milky brown, to the rich, hint-of
sweet, nutty taste, it is perfection in
a mug. I close my eyes and exhale
deeply.That very first sip warms me
with the comfort that no matter
what has happened before it's a
new day with new opportunities
just waiting to be explored. Life
goes on, as beautiful and abundant
as ever.
Sure, I make sacrifices. For a
Stanford senior, waking up at 7:30
a.m. is not exactly the recipe for a
wild night on the town. But even
with the craziness that comes with
fall classes and activities, I'm fight
ing to keep those mornings.
So here's a challenge for the rest
of you: consecrate mornings to
yourself. Maybe you're not a coffee
person, but find your favorite blend
of tea and cherish the process of
making and enjoying it. Prepare
and savor a good breakfast, what
ever that may be for you truly,
being a breakfast person is awe
some. Take that time to set a won
derful tone for your day.
But more importantly, pause.
Look around, if only for a few

short seconds, to see how unbeliev
ably amazing this world is, and how
beauty can be found in everything
if we take the time to notice and
appreciate it. Trust me, 10 or 15
minutes in the morning can put a
smile on your face for the rest of
the day.
