# DO'S AND DOO-DOO'S
## 'Hooking up' with friends 
### Chase Ishii 
Alright, friends. I wanted to
give you a little advice to
help you get through an al
ways awkward, first week of classes.
Do: Get to know your friends.
Doo-Doo: "Hook up" with your
friends.
We all know first impressions
and interactions with new house
mates can be a quick indicator of
the future type and quality of rela
tionship you will have.
So naturally I was excited when
the super attractive girl down the
hall popped into my room to ask if I
had a screwdriver. While I was
empty-handed in the tool depart
ment (I bet there's a self-deprecat
ing joke in there somewhere), I did
contribute some witty banter and
navigated the standard, "How-was
your-summer?" questions. After the
laughter and conversation sub
sided, I extended my hand and said
all smooth-like, "By the way, I don't
think we've met yet. My name's
Chase." It was soooo smooth.
She batted her eyes, blushed a bit
and with her mouth slightly ajar re

sponded, "Are you [cuss]ing seri
ous! [Cuss] you Chase!" Not so
smooth.
It turns out I had spent my entire
freshman year on Frosh Council
with this girl an entire year
and had forgotten her name. Not so
smooth at all. After the embarrass
ment withdrew from my face and
the feeling of being a complete ass
hole settled firmly into the pit of my
stomach, I apologized and prom
ised I would make it up to her.
(Phase one of making it up to her,
calling her "super attractive" in a
school-wide publication. Smooth.)
I'm learning there's a difference
between knowing people and really
knowing people. It's one thing to
ask, "What's your major?" to fill
small talk. It's another to ask, "Why
do you want to major in that?" be
cause you really want to get to know
a person. And when others ask how
you're doing, you're allowed to an
swer something other than, "Pretty
good, you?"
There's a difference between
loving people and loving yourself

through people. In my two years at
Stanford, I've primarily been guilty
of the latter. I was making efforts to
befriend people, but not to be a
good friend. It was so I could feel
comfortable. I could stop into
rooms and have surface-level con
versations. I could go to parties with
people and then recount all the
shenanigans the next morning at
brunch. I was getting to know peo
ple so that I wouldn't feel alone at
Stanford, and once they stopped
serving that purpose, they were re
placed. Gone. Forgotten.
They say there's no dating cul
ture at Stanford. They say people
don't have time to date. The under
lying statement is that people don't
have the time or energy to spare
from preparing for school and ca
reers to spend loving or caring
about another person. The result is
"harmless hook-ups," which is
rarely loving another person and
more often than not loving yourself
through another person.
But back to business; this is an
article on friendship, not dating.

(You win again, rambling, ADD
brain.) I am realizing how selfish I
have been with my friendships.
Rather than spending time and en
ergy genuinely getting to know peo
ple, I have settled for "hooking up"
with friends and by that I mean
developing and maintaining friend
ships only when it is comfortable
and convenient for me. I have
friends who I call when I want to
talk music, go to the gym, play
sports or borrow a car. But that is
often the extent of it. Our paths are
merely intersecting, rather than
running parallel to each other (for
you techies out there. I think that
makes sense).
Maybe it's because I don't want
to sacrifice the time I dedicate to
truly important things (sleeping
through class, deleting spam
emails, watching You Tube videos,
sending spam emails, etc . . . ).
Maybe I'm afraid of depending on
someone for fear they will let me
down (like the Angels this season
another lonely postseason Oc
tober ahead). Maybe I'm afraid of

those friends getting too close to
me and realizing that I'm not the
put-together Stanford student I
work so hard to display. I don't
know. Maybe I should read some
Freud. I bet he could diagnose me
and figure it out. (On second
thought, let's not go there).
So I've resolved to do my best to
truly love the people around me, for
their sake. I don't know about you.
Maybe you're getting an A+ in
Friendship and you just think I
suck. Maybe you feel betrayed be
cause you expected a crazy "Friends
With Benefits" or "No Strings At
tached" story and wound up with a
whiny, emo confessional about
friendship. But maybe it's some
thing for you to think about.

sided, I extended my hand and said
all smooth-like, "By the way, I don't
think we've met yet. My name's
Chase." It was soooo smooth.
She batted her eyes, blushed a bit
and with her mouth slightly ajar re

sponded, "Are you [cuss]ing seri
ous! [Cuss] you Chase!" Not so
smooth.
It turns out I had spent my entire
freshman year on Frosh Council
with this girl an entire year
and had forgotten her name. Not so
smooth at all. After the embarrass
ment withdrew from my face and
the feeling of being a complete ass
hole settled firmly into the pit of my
stomach, I apologized and prom
ised I would make it up to her.
(Phase one of making it up to her,
calling her "super attractive" in a
school-wide publication. Smooth.)
I'm learning there's a difference
between knowing people and really
knowing people. It's one thing to
ask, "What's your major?" to fill
small talk. It's another to ask, "Why
do you want to major in that?" be
cause you really want to get to know
a person. And when others ask how
you're doing, you're allowed to an
swer something other than, "Pretty
good, you?"
There's a difference between
loving people and loving yourself

through people. In my two years at
Stanford, I've primarily been guilty
of the latter. I was making efforts to
befriend people, but not to be a
good friend. It was so I could feel
comfortable. I could stop into
rooms and have surface-level con
versations. I could go to parties with
people and then recount all the
shenanigans the next morning at
brunch. I was getting to know peo
ple so that I wouldn't feel alone at
Stanford, and once they stopped
serving that purpose, they were re
placed. Gone. Forgotten.
They say there's no dating cul
ture at Stanford. They say people
don't have time to date. The under
lying statement is that people don't
have the time or energy to spare
from preparing for school and ca
reers to spend loving or caring
about another person. The result is
"harmless hook-ups," which is
rarely loving another person and
more often than not loving yourself
through another person.
But back to business; this is an
article on friendship, not dating.

(You win again, rambling, ADD
brain.) I am realizing how selfish I
have been with my friendships.
Rather than spending time and en
ergy genuinely getting to know peo
ple, I have settled for "hooking up"
with friends and by that I mean
developing and maintaining friend
ships only when it is comfortable
and convenient for me. I have
friends who I call when I want to
talk music, go to the gym, play
sports or borrow a car. But that is
often the extent of it. Our paths are
merely intersecting, rather than
running parallel to each other (for
you techies out there. I think that
makes sense).
Maybe it's because I don't want
to sacrifice the time I dedicate to
truly important things (sleeping
through class, deleting spam
emails, watching You Tube videos,
sending spam emails, etc . . . ).
Maybe I'm afraid of depending on
someone for fear they will let me
down (like the Angels this season
another lonely postseason Oc
tober ahead). Maybe I'm afraid of

those friends getting too close to
me and realizing that I'm not the
put-together Stanford student I
work so hard to display. I don't
know. Maybe I should read some
Freud. I bet he could diagnose me
and figure it out. (On second
thought, let's not go there).
So I've resolved to do my best to
truly love the people around me, for
their sake. I don't know about you.
Maybe you're getting an A+ in
Friendship and you just think I
suck. Maybe you feel betrayed be
cause you expected a crazy "Friends
With Benefits" or "No Strings At
tached" story and wound up with a
whiny, emo confessional about
friendship. But maybe it's some
thing for you to think about.
