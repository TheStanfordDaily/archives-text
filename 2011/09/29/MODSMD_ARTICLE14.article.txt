## ROLLING ALONG No.1 women's soccer looks to extend win streak 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
After dismantling Arizona last Saturday
in its first-ever Pac-12 showdown, the Stan
ford women's soccer team heads north this
weekend for two games against Washington
and Washington State.
The top-ranked Cardinal (9-0-1,1-0 Pac
-12), riding a 21-game conference win streak

into the trip, has a shot at eclipsing UCLA's
conference record of 22 consecutive victo
ries, a stretch ended by Stanford in 2009.
With a weekend sweep, the squad can also
continue its bid to become the first school in
Pac-10 (or 12) history to post three straight
unbeaten conference seasons.
Standing in the Cardinal's way is a Husky
squad (4-4-2,0-1) that was chosen to finish
fifth in conference by the coaches and a

Cougar team (7-3-1,1-0) that has yet to lose
at home this season.
"It's always tough on the road, and
they're both really good teams; so we have
to stay humble, go and fight on," head coach
Paul Ratcliffe said.
A year ago, Stanford swept the Washing
ton schools at home by a combined score of

Senior forward Lindsay Taylor (above) and the Stanford women's soccer team have reeled off seven wins in a row and have a shot at
eclipsing the Pac-12's longest conference-win streak this weekend on a trip to the Northwest, where they will play the Washington schools.
7-1, forfeiting the only goal to the
Huskies in the final minute of play of
the weekend one of only two
scores the Cardinal gave up in con
ference play last season.
Stanford outshot both teams by
over 20 attempts each in last sea
son's matchups, including a domi
nant 35-2 mark against the Huskies.
But while the Cardinal has allowed
just four goals through 10 games this
season, the squad's defensive efforts
have not always been consistent
through the full 90 minutes Stan
ford's opponents have fired over
twice as many shots in the second
frame as in the first.
"Obviously when we make a lot
of changes, that can disrupt the flow
a little bit, because there's a lot of
new faces that aren't used to playing
together," Ratcliffe said. "But other
than that, I think it's just part of the
game. We're still getting a lot of
chances, and I think that the group
that went in for the second half
[against Arizona] did a great job."
The Cardinal will want to pick up
just where it left off in last Satur
day's contest, a 7-0 rout of the Wild
cats that gave the coaching staff an
opportunity to insert 23 different
players none of whom played for
over 65 minutes into the match
and saw the squad explode with
four goals in a 10-minute span. Stan
ford received contributions from six
different scorers, including sopho
more forward Sydney Payne, who

got on the board for the first time
this season.
But Stanford's trip to the North
west looks to be a tougher test. Ari
zona, still looking for its first win of
the season, was picked to finish
dead last in the Pac-12 preseason
coaches' poll.
Stanford does hold a clear statis
tical advantage over both Washing
ton schools —in fact, the team is
ranked in the top-10 nationally in
goals for, goals against, save percent
age and winning percentage, leading
the conference in each category.
What's more, the Cardinal's top four
scorers senior forward Lindsay
Taylor, senior midfielder Teresa
Noyola, junior forward Marjani
Hing-Glover and freshman forward
Chioma Übogagu have com
bined for more goals than either the
Cougars or the Huskies as a team.
Regardless, each group has
enough weapons to threaten the
Cardinal if it comes out flat. Wash
ington State boasts recent Pac-12
Women's Soccer Player of the Week
Beau Bremer, as well as a host of
other talented freshmen who have
combined for five of the team's
goals in early play. The Huskies,
meanwhile, took No. 2 UCLA
surely Stanford's toughest competi
tor in the Pac-12 to the brink last
week, finally allowing the game's
only goal in the 79th minute of a 1-0
loss.
The Cardinal's weekend will kick
off in Pullman Friday at 3 p.m., then
continue against the Huskies on
Sunday at 12 p.m.
