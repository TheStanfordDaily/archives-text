# Will Boise block Card?

### Jack Blanchat 
After the first few weeks of the college foot
ball season, some of the critical questions
that experts pondered all summer seemed
to be answered.
Will LSU's tough early schedule lead to a couple of
ugly losses? Nope. Will Alabama be that good after los
ing their starting quarterback,running back and wide re
ceiver? Oh,yeah. Will Andrew Luck struggle because of
the pressure that comes with being the preseason Heis
man front-runner? Not one bit.
But now that the top-10 teams in the country appear
to have sorted themselves out (for the most part), fans
are already looking ahead to BCS bowl season and just
where their favorite teams might end up if their early
season success continues. This picture, just like anything
that involves the BCS, is not so clear.
First, let's sort out just who the national title con
tendere appear to be. In the SEC, Alabama and LSU
have set themselves atop the conference and the nation,
but they square off Nov. 5. In the Big Ten, Nebraska and
Wisconsin are both undefeated, but will play one anoth
er this weekend. In the Big 12, Oklahoma and Okla
homa State are unblemished, and they will also play
each other in the last game of their seasons.
In the Pac-12, Stanford is the only undefeated team
left after four weeks, but the Oregon Ducks loom on the
Cardinal's schedule, and then lone loss is to No. 1 LSU.
And, once again, Boise State is undefeated, and it looks
like the Broncos will remain that way, barring another
disaster loss like their loss to Nevada
last year. Once again, that means that
the Broncos are the ones complicating
everyone else's lives.
We know that half of the teams I
listed off earlier will definitely have
losses on their record because they
play one another so that will
most likely eliminate some of them
from title contention. And if a team
from the SEC goes undefeated,
they'll definitely be in the title
game (if history is any indication).
If Oklahoma goes undefeated,
they'll surely be in the title game
because they'll have a couple of
wins over top-10 teams.
But what about Stanford? If the
Cardinal goes undefeated, would it get
the call over an undefeated Boise State
team?
I've personally been asked this
question several times in the past week,
and it's a reasonable one because the
Pac-12 is not very deep this year. It

bears repeating that Stanford is the
only undefeated team left in the entire
conference, and it's only week five.
Therefore, I wanted to make this
point in print: if Stanford goes unde
feated and Boise goes undefeated, the
Cardinal would (and should) get the
call over the Broncos.
Stanford's resume would, without a
doubt, be better than Boise's, and the
addition of a Pac-12 title game this sea
son would add extra incentive for the
BCS to pick the Cardinal for New Or
leans.
Just look at the numbers: if Boise
and Stanford both win out, the Cardi
nal would have 13 wins to the Broncos'
12. Stanford would have quality wins
over Oregon and the Pac-12 South
Champion. Stanford's best win would
be over Oregon, which would be signif
icantly better than Boise's best win,
which came against a suspect Georgia
team in week one,
I'm not a Boise hater it's a
great program and absolutely de
serves to go to a BCS bowl if it goes
undefeated but it doesn't deserve
to go over any team that wins an
extra conference championship
game, be that undefeated team from

the Pac-12, Big Ten, SEC or ACC. If
it's a one-loss major conference
team, perhaps an undefeated Boise
deserves to go to the title game, but I
won't get into that now.
I know arguments about Boise
have played out now that it has been in
title contention for several years now,
and I hate relying on the Boise-plays
too-weak-a-schedule argument, but it
does apply in this case. Having Georgia
as your best win is not going to cut it this
year if it comes down to Stanford or
Boise. Sorry, Broncos. Sometimes the
truth hurts.
So take heart, Stanford fans â€”just
remember how unpredictable college
football can be especially if the
Broncos are the ones who finally end
up holding that crystal football at the
end of this season.

If you give Jack Blanchat lemons, he
will make margaritas. If you give him
onions, he will also make margaritas.
So it comes as little surprise that he has
the Cardinal playing in the BCS title
game. Weigh in on his unending opti
mism via Twitter @jmblanchat, or
drop him an email at blanchat@stan
ford. edu for that margarita recipe.
