After the first few weeks of the college foot
ball season, some of the critical questions
that experts pondered all summer seemed
to be answered.
Will LSU's tough early schedule lead to a couple of
ugly losses? Nope. Will Alabama be that good after los
ing their starting quarterback,running back and wide re
ceiver? Oh,yeah. Will Andrew Luck struggle because of
the pressure that comes with being the preseason Heis
man front-runner? Not one bit.
But now that the top-10 teams in the country appear
to have sorted themselves out (for the most part), fans
are already looking ahead to BCS bowl season and just
where their favorite teams might end up if their early
season success continues. This picture, just like anything
that involves the BCS, is not so clear.
First, let's sort out just who the national title con
tendere appear to be. In the SEC, Alabama and LSU
have set themselves atop the conference and the nation,
but they square off Nov. 5. In the Big Ten, Nebraska and
Wisconsin are both undefeated, but will play one anoth
er this weekend. In the Big 12, Oklahoma and Okla
homa State are unblemished, and they will also play
each other in the last game of their seasons.
In the Pac-12, Stanford is the only undefeated team
left after four weeks, but the Oregon Ducks loom on the
Cardinal's schedule, and then lone loss is to No. 1 LSU.
And, once again, Boise State is undefeated, and it looks
like the Broncos will remain that way, barring another
