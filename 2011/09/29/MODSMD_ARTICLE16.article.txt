# Injuries inspire

### Billy Gallagher 
Sports are wildly unpredictable. It's why we
love them. It's why we hate them. It's why
we watch them. But the hatred is always
rooted in intense competition we want to
beat the best team possible. We seek an
equal to conquer, and when things don't go our way
we curse, scream and vent. But this hatred is far better
than the empty feeling of despair and hopelessness
that comes with injuries.
The sadness and anger following a loss to a bitter
rival is tempered by its brevity the next week you
have the opportunity to beat another team, collect a W
and make it to the playoffs the Corporate Sponsorship
Bowl. An injury is wildly different, especially a season
ending one to a star player.
As I'm sure you know by now unless you're in
FroSoCo Shayne Skov is out for the season. But
out of this injury springs opportunity for several play-
ers, and this opportunity is rooted
deep in recent Cardinal history.
In 2006, the Cardinal struggled
through an injury-riddled campaign
to a 1-11 finish. During the season, a
starting wide receiver, a starting full
back and star quarterback Trent Ed
wards a future third-round pick in
the NFL Draft all went down with
season-ending injuries. A multitude
of other injuries at wide receiver got
then-freshman Richard Sherman
playing time at wide receiver. Sher
man was a veteran leader of the Car
dinal defense last year after switching
to defensive back.
After the season, head coach Walt
Harris was fired and athletic director
Bob Bowlsby said that injuries were a
big factor in the team's performance
that season. The program hadn't had
a winning season since coach Tyrone
Willingham left for Notre Dame fol
lowing the 2001 season. Harris' re
placement was Jim Harbaugh, then
the head coach of I-AA University of
San Diego.
Fast-forward a bit. Eight games
into the 2009 season, middle line
backer Clinton Snyder, the defense's
best tackier and emotional leader,
went down for the season with a knee
injury (sound familiar?). Snyder's re
placement? Stanford fullback Owen
Marecic, When Snyder went down,
true freshman Shayne Skov took ad
vantage of extra playing time to make
five tackles against then-No. 7 Ore
gon. Skov started every game for the
rest of the season and finished third
on the team in tackles.
Last year, Skov missed the first
two games of the season with an in
jury. Max Bergen filled in for him and
recorded eight tackles and a forced
fumble against Sacramento State and
three solo tackles against UCLA.
Let me be clear here the loss of
Skov is huge. But the Cardinal de
fense is more than capable of weath
ering the storm.
Redshirt junior Chase Thomas is
one of the best and most underrated
'backers in the conference and leads
the team with 3.5 sacks.Thomas, now
the de facto leader of the LBs, said he
won't alter his play since Skov's in
jury.
"Bad things start to happen when
you feel like you have to do too many
jobs or do too much," Thomas said.
"We have faith in Jarek Lancaster
stepping in. We have great depth at
linebacker, so there should be no
issue. I know [Shayne] is one of our
top leaders and best players so it's
harder to replace him, but at the same
time we have full faith in Jarek and
we've just got to trust that he's going
to do his job and we're going to do our
job and we'll be fine."
Joining Thomas at outside line
backer is Trent Murphy, who has been
very solid thus far with three tackles
for a loss and two sacks.
Bergen won the open competition

for Marecic's old starting spot in train
ing camp this year and has played
well, recording 14 tackles and a sack.
Now, the task of replacing Skov falls
to a platoon of AJ Tarpley and Jarek
Lancaster. Sophomore Joe Hem
schoot and true freshman James
Vaughters will also be in the mix.
Tarpley and Lancaster have al
ready seen a good deal of playing time
this season, as they have rotated in for
Bergen and Skov and played late in
big wins. Both Tarpley and Lancaster
said the training camp battle for
Marecic's spot helped the linebacker
corps grow closer together and push
each other every day to improve.
Molding this tight-knit group has
been the responsibility of first year
linebackers coach Jason Tarver. Tarv
er was offered a position with the San
Francisco 49ers by Harbaugh, but
turned it down to work with new
Stanford head coach David Shaw.
Tarver has experienced this same
scenario with the Niners. In 2007,
starter Manny Lawson suffered a sea
son-ending injury in the second week.
Tarver helped develop backup Parys
Haralson into a sack machine. Tarver
said the lessons he learned from the
Lawson injury have helped him guide
Skov through his injury and fill his
starting spot.
Tarver and several linebackers
spoke to Skov's intense preparation
both during the week and in games
and intensity on the field. Luckily
for the Cardinal, he has been helping
his replacements study film and
working with them at meetings. As for
his intensity, Tarver said this "Skov
ness" has rubbed off on other players.
For the Cardinal, devastating in
jury is familiar territory. Its now up to
Tarpley and Lancaster to step up and
make the most of their opportunities,
as Marecic and Skov did before them.

three solo tackles against UCLA.
Let me be clear here the loss of
Skov is huge. But the Cardinal de
fense is more than capable of weath
ering the storm.
Redshirt junior Chase Thomas is
one of the best and most underrated
'backers in the conference and leads
the team with 3.5 sacks.Thomas, now
the de facto leader of the LBs, said he
won't alter his play since Skov's in
jury.
"Bad things start to happen when
you feel like you have to do too many
jobs or do too much," Thomas said.
"We have faith in Jarek Lancaster
stepping in. We have great depth at
linebacker, so there should be no
issue. I know [Shayne] is one of our
top leaders and best players so it's
harder to replace him, but at the same
time we have full faith in Jarek and
we've just got to trust that he's going
to do his job and we're going to do our
job and we'll be fine."
Joining Thomas at outside line
backer is Trent Murphy, who has been
very solid thus far with three tackles
for a loss and two sacks.
Bergen won the open competition

for Marecic's old starting spot in train
ing camp this year and has played
well, recording 14 tackles and a sack.
Now, the task of replacing Skov falls
to a platoon of AJ Tarpley and Jarek
Lancaster. Sophomore Joe Hem
schoot and true freshman James
Vaughters will also be in the mix.
Tarpley and Lancaster have al
ready seen a good deal of playing time
this season, as they have rotated in for
Bergen and Skov and played late in
big wins. Both Tarpley and Lancaster
said the training camp battle for
Marecic's spot helped the linebacker
corps grow closer together and push
each other every day to improve.
Molding this tight-knit group has
been the responsibility of first year
linebackers coach Jason Tarver. Tarv
er was offered a position with the San
Francisco 49ers by Harbaugh, but
turned it down to work with new
Stanford head coach David Shaw.
Tarver has experienced this same
scenario with the Niners. In 2007,
starter Manny Lawson suffered a sea
son-ending injury in the second week.
Tarver helped develop backup Parys
Haralson into a sack machine. Tarver
said the lessons he learned from the
Lawson injury have helped him guide
Skov through his injury and fill his
starting spot.
Tarver and several linebackers
spoke to Skov's intense preparation
both during the week and in games
and intensity on the field. Luckily
for the Cardinal, he has been helping
his replacements study film and
working with them at meetings. As for
his intensity, Tarver said this "Skov
ness" has rubbed off on other players.
For the Cardinal, devastating in
jury is familiar territory. Its now up to
Tarpley and Lancaster to step up and
make the most of their opportunities,
as Marecic and Skov did before them.

For Billy Gallagher, the past is pro
logue. Send him more gratuitous

The loss of
Skov is huge,
but the Cardinal
defense can
weather the
storm.
Sports are wildly unpredictable. It's why we
love them. It's why we hate them. It's why
we watch them. But the hatred is always
rooted in intense competition we want to
beat the best team possible. We seek an
equal to conquer, and when things don't go our way
we curse, scream and vent. But this hatred is far better
than the empty feeling of despair and hopelessness
that comes with injuries.
The sadness and anger following a loss to a bitter
rival is tempered by its brevity the next week you
have the opportunity to beat another team, collect a W
and make it to the playoffs the Corporate Sponsorship
Bowl. An injury is wildly different, especially a season
ending one to a star player.
As I'm sure you know by now unless you're in
FroSoCo Shayne Skov is out for the season. But
out of this injury springs opportunity for several play-
ers, and this opportunity is rooted
deep in recent Cardinal history.
In 2006, the Cardinal struggled
through an injury-riddled campaign
to a 1-11 finish. During the season, a
starting wide receiver, a starting full
back and star quarterback Trent Ed
wards a future third-round pick in
the NFL Draft all went down with
season-ending injuries. A multitude
of other injuries at wide receiver got
then-freshman Richard Sherman
playing time at wide receiver. Sher
man was a veteran leader of the Car
dinal defense last year after switching
to defensive back.
After the season, head coach Walt
Harris was fired and athletic director
Bob Bowlsby said that injuries were a
big factor in the team's performance
that season. The program hadn't had
a winning season since coach Tyrone
Willingham left for Notre Dame fol
lowing the 2001 season. Harris' re
placement was Jim Harbaugh, then
the head coach of I-AA University of
San Diego.
Fast-forward a bit. Eight games
into the 2009 season, middle line
backer Clinton Snyder, the defense's
best tackier and emotional leader,
went down for the season with a knee
injury (sound familiar?). Snyder's re
placement? Stanford fullback Owen
Marecic, When Snyder went down,
true freshman Shayne Skov took ad
vantage of extra playing time to make
five tackles against then-No. 7 Ore
gon. Skov started every game for the
rest of the season and finished third
on the team in tackles.
Last year, Skov missed the first
two games of the season with an in
jury. Max Bergen filled in for him and
recorded eight tackles and a forced
fumble against Sacramento State and
three solo tackles against UCLA.
Let me be clear here the loss of
Skov is huge. But the Cardinal de
fense is more than capable of weath
