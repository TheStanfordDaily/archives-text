## Stanford trio called up to U.S. Under-23 women's national team camp 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
The women's soccer team has
been on a roll of late the Cardi
nal has won its last seven matches
and exploded for seven goals in last
weekend's rout of Arizona and
USA Soccer has taken notice.
It was announced Wednesday
that three current members of the
team have been called into the U.S.
Under-23 women's national team
camp next week, the first step to
making the roster for the 2012
Olympic team that will compete in
London next summer.
Senior defender Camille Levin,
senior forward Lindsay Taylor and
sophomore goalie Emily Oliver will
all make the trip to Carson, Calif,
and the Home Depot Center to
train under the eye of national team
coach Pia Sundhage, U.S. Soccer
Women's Development Director
Jill Ellis and U.S. Soccer Women's
Technical Director April Heinrichs
from Oct. 2-7.
While the invite from the U.S.
national team is an exciting oppor
tunity for the selected Stanford
players, the camp conflicts with the
Cardinal's schedule at a very inop
portune time. Levin, Oliver and
Taylor will all fly from Seattle to the
Home Depot Center after Stan
ford's match at Washington on Sun
day afternoon, and are expected to
return to Stanford on Thursday in
time for two critical matchups Fri
day, Oct. 7 against USC, and Sun
day, Oct. 9 against No. 3 UCLA.
"It's not a good thing because it
hurts our preparations," Stanford
coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "But, ulti
mately, it's great for those players to
get the opportunity to play with the
full national team."
Twenty-four players will attend
the camp, including 16 college play
ers, six Women's Professional Soc
cer players and two club players.
Stanford is sending the most cur
rent players, with North Carolina
and Wake Forest each contributing
two athletes to the mix.

Joining them will be former Car
dinal forward Christen Press 'll,
who holds several of Stanford's ca
reer-scoring records and was re
cently named the Women's Profes
sional Soccer Rookie of the Year
after scoring eight goals for the
Florida Magic Jack.
The Olympic qualifying tourna
ment begins in Vancouver, with
final roster cuts not expected until a
few weeks before qualifying begins.
