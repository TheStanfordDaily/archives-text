# TRYING TO BOUNCE BACK
## 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After stumbling with back
to-back losses in Southern Cali
fornia last weekend, the No. 6
Stanford women's volleyball
team returns home to Maples
Pavilion hoping for a pair of re
demption wins against the Ari
zona schools. The Cardinal (8-3,
2-3 Pac-12) looks to break .500
in league play and move up
from eighth place in the confer
ence standings.
On Friday night, Stanford
will host Arizona State, one of
only two teams Colorado
being the other that remains
winless in the Pac-12. The Sun
Devils (4-9, 0-4) are currently
riding a six-match losing streak
and were swept by visiting
Washington last Sunday after
falling in a five-game match
against Washington State two
days prior.
On paper, Stanford out
shines Arizona State all over the
court, with the Sun Devils rank
ing in the bottom half of the con
ference in every statistical cate
gory, including dead last in hit
ting percentage at .169. Its great
est strength thus far has been
blocking, ranking seventh in the
conference with an average of
2.32 blocks per set, led by junior
middle blocker Erica Wilson
and freshman outside hitter
Nora Tuioti-Mariner with 46
overall blocks apiece thus far.
Redshirt sophomore Ashley
Kastl leads the offense in kills,

with 160 this season (an average
of 3.33 per set), while sopho
more setter Sarah McGaffin
ranks seventh in the conference
with 10.31 assists per set. In
comparison, Stanford's offen
sive leader, sophomore outside
hitter Rachel Williams, ranks
second in the conference with
192 total kills, or 4.68 kills per
set, while junior setter Karissa
Cook is fourth in the Pac-12
with 11.02 assists per set.
The following night, Stan
ford will have a slightly tougher
test against the Arizona Wild
cats (10-3, 2-2), who will travel
to Maples Pavilion after facing
No. 4 Cal on Friday. Currently
standing right above Stanford at
seventh in the Pac-12 with a .500
record, the Wildcats split both of
their opening conference series,
picking up victories against
Oregon State and Washington
State and falling to Oregon and
Washington.
Arizona and Stanford's front
lines are closely matched, with
the teams ranked fifth and sixth
respectively in hitting percent
age and kills the Wildcats are
hitting .241 and 13.41 kills per
set while the Cardinal is tallying
.224 hitting and 13.29 kills per
set. The Stanford defense holds
the advantage, leading the con
ference with 17.71 digs per set,
while Arizona is sixth with
14.84.

Junior Hannah Benjamin (above) and the Stanford women's volleyboll team
dropped a pair of games last weekend down in Los Angeles, and will try to
move above .500 in the Pac-12 this weekend against the Arizona schools.
outside hitter Madi Kingdon are
the Wildcats' strongest offensive
threats, with Jackson ranking sixth
in the conference with her .363 hit
ting percentage and tenth in block
ing, while Kingdon currently ranks
eighth in kills, with 3.82 per set.

History does not bode well for
either the Sun Devils' or the Wild
cats' chances. Stanford holds a 58-4
advantage in the series with Ari
zona State, last falling to the Sun
Devils over a decade ago, and a 56-
6 overall record against Arizona.
The Card will take on Arizona
State on Sept. 30 at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
