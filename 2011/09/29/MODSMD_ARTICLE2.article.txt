A new, portable miniature mi
croscope designed by Stanford re
searchers, standing at less than
three-quarters of an inch tall, prom
ises to expand the field of neuro
science research by recording the
neural activity of mice.
Computers can then process the
neural activity data into brain imag
ing data. Details of the microscope's
development were announced in a
paper in Nature this month.
This microscope builds off previ
ous work by associate professor of
biology and co-author Mark
Schnitzer, who focuses on the devel
opment of fiber-optic microscopes.
In the fiber-optic model, the optical
head of the microscope is mounted
to the mouse, while a fiber optic
cable relays information to an ex
ternal imaging system.
Though innovative, this prede
cessor microscope was costly to
produce and imposed physical limi
tations for mice research studies, ac
cording to Abbas El Gamal, profes
sor of electrical engineering and co
author of the paper. The rigid na
ture of fiber optics restricted the
mobility of the mouse and hence
the nature of the neural data col
lected.
Weighing 1.9 grams, the new mi
croscope's main advantage is its
portability. To improve mobility,
Stanford researchers traded fiber
optics for thin wires, similar to those
commonly used for hearing aids.
The miniature microscope still at
taches to the mouse's head, but now
these flexible cables allow the
mouse to move while still collecting
a stream of neural data.
To improve the imaging technol
ogy of the microscope, researchers
"piggybacked" off cell phone imag
ing research. Gamal said this is the
same technology that allows indi
viduals to take pictures on their cell
phones.
By using existing imaging tech
nology and its mass-produced ma
terial components, the group was
able to reduce the manufacturing
price. Because of this manufactur
ing capability, Gamal is confident
that the microscopes will be "well
commercialized" and "widely used"
by labs. He stated that the miniature
microscope would be used as an
"enabler" instead of a research tool.
"This is not a prototype; it's
something that you use. That's the
