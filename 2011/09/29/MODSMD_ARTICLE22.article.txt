### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown 
Stanford's Precourt Institue for
Energy andTomKat Center for Sus
tainable Energy are awarding $2.2
million in research grants to faculty
for eight renewable energy projects.
The grants are designed as funding
for early-stage work that will be po
tentially influential and has good
prospects for future funding.
The grants are spread between
the Materials Science and Engi
neering, Civil and Environmental
Engineering, Chemical Engineer
ing and Environmental Earth Sys
tem Science Departments and the
Graduate School of Business
(GSB).
The projects that the Precourt
Institute is funding include lithium
air battery development; design of a
novel micro-combined cooling,
heating and power system, which
uses solar energy to cool, heat and
power homes and commercial de
velopments and more efficient dye
sensitized solar cells, which involve
the synthesis of dyes that act as bet
ter charge carriers.
The TomKat Center's awards
focus on research that aims to make
solar installations more efficient
and cost-effective. They include
solar cells with upconverters, which
add layers that allow the cells to ab
sorb more sunlight; a study on how
to better handle the variability of
power; a new type of alkaline fuel
cell that can be tied to solar installa
tions; a new method to calculate the

effects of solar installations on
ecosystems and a proposal that ex
amines the effects of and possible
mitigation for the construction of
solar plants on resources in the
American Southwest.
