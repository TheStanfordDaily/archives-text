# Study suggests life began in serpentine rock

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
After careful examination of the
geology and environment of Earth
in its early days, a group of Stanford
geologists theorized that life may
have originated above serpentinite
rock at the bottom of the ocean. The
theory was published in a paper co
authored by geophysics professor
Norm Sleep, geological and environ
mental sciences professor Dennis
bird and former graduate Emily
Pope in the Philosophical Transac
tions of the Royal Society B.
Deep sea, serpentinite deposits,
which form "white smoker chim
neys" or hydrothermal vents, are
sites where alkaline vent fluid inter
acts with acidic seawater.The nucle
ic acids that make up RNA could
have occurred naturally in those
vent fluids, making it more likely
that complete strands of RNA spon
taneously formed. Tiny pores in the
rock would have allowed for the
strands to survive without cell mem
branes.
The difference in pH could also
have served as an energy supply for
the organisms. Hydrogen forms
when serpentinite is oxidized by sea
water, and microbes can react hy
drogen with carbon dioxide to form
methane or acetate for chemical en
ergy.
While hydrogen can still be seen
bubbling off of serpentinite rock all
throughout the state, evidence of
membrane-less, rock-dwelling mi
crobes have yet to be found.
"It's conceivable that a biologist
might get lucky," Sleep said to the
Stanford Report. "But I'm not hold
ing my breath."
