Individuals who were better
dressed are perceived as more
"white," according to a study by
Stanford researchers in collabora
tion with scientists at Tufts Universi
ty and the University of California,
Irvine.
The researchers asked partici
pants to determine the race of indi
viduals with different skin tones. The
individuals depicted were dressed
either in business attire or janitor at
tire. Researchers found that when
race was more ambiguous, partici
pants relied on the clothing of the in
dividuals in the images. When the in
dividuals depicted were dressed in
formally, participants were more
likely to classify the individual as
"black."
"[The study shows] very simply,
that race is about more than a per
son's physical features," said Stan
ford sociologist Aliya Saperstein in
an interview with Stanford Knowl
edgebase, a sector of the Graduate
School of Business' news service. "If
you can change how people per
ceive your race by changing your
clothes, or by getting a promotion or
demotion in your job, then race is
not an 'essence' that we hold in our
bodies; it is a category we get as
signed to socially through interac
tions with other people."
