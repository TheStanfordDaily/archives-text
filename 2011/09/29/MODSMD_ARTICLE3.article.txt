# Profs brief Congress on teacher evaluations
## Darling-Hammond, Haertel discuss flaws in VAM system 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
At a Sept. 14 Capitol Hill briefing, School of Educa
tion professors Linda Darling-Hammond and Edward
H. Haertel, among other leading education re
searchers, presented their findings on a central concern
in federal and state policy how teacher perform
ance should be evaluated.
One popular type of teacher evaluation is the value
added method (VAM) system, which uses statistical
methods to measure gains in student achievement. The
VAM system measures changes in student test scores
over time, while taking into account other factors that
are found to influence achievement.
According to Haertel, who also serves as chair of

the National Research Council Board on Testing and
Assessment, one major flaw of the VAM system is that
it gives policymakers the illusion of a "quick fix" for im
proving student performance by identifying teachers'
level of competency through their VAM scores.
"There's a hope that [problems will be solved] by
funding poor teachers that need to either be given
some remedial assistance or discouraged from contin
uing to teach," Haertel said. "I've not been surprised
that these models have been caught on and have been
so popular among policymakers."
Surprisingly, the problem with the VAM system is
not with its reliance of standardized testing scores, he
continued.
