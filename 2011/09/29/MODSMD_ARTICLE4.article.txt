## Hennessy comments on NYC bid Purdue drops out of race, citing high costs 
### IVY NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
University President John Hen

bid on Monday, citing insufficient fi

In a speech at IBM's THINK
Forum on Sept. 22, Bloomberg
noted that NYC has surpassed
Boston in becoming the second
largest recipient of venture capital

lead.
