## Hennessy comments on NYC bid Purdue drops out of race, citing high costs 
### IVY NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
University President John Hen
nessy emphasized Stanford's com
mitment to its proposal for a New
York City (NYC) applied sciences
campus in a recent, joint interview
with the Stanford Report, Stanford
magazine and The Daily.
The interview came just days be
fore Purdue University dropped its
bid on Monday, citing insufficient fi
nancial backing from the city. The
Bloomberg administration has
pledged $lOO million so far to help
support infrastructure upgrades at
the site. However, the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) estimates a new
school would cost hundreds of mil
lions more.
Purdue is the first institution to
drop from the bid, according to the
WSJ.
Hennessy estimated that the bid
could cost as much as $1 million and
that he expects presidential discre
tionary funds to cover most of the
cost; should Stanford be chosen, the
University will need to raise money
in the form of endowment gifts and
capital contributions.
Acknowledging concerns that
NYC might economically retrench
in the decades during which the
campus would be built, Hennessy
said he believed that Mayor
Michael Bloomberg is set on invest
ing now to promote prosperity in
the future,
"If we decide we're going to
solve all our budget problems by
slashing discretionary spending, by
cutting our investments in research
and education, the long-term im
pact on our economic growth will
make that a penny-wise, pound
foolish decision," he said.
Hennessy and University
Spokesperson Lisa Lapin both in
dependently said the amount of
funding the University plans to allo
cate to public relations firm Edel
man and political consulting firm
Tusk, recently hired to assist with
the bid, is negligible.
In a speech at IBM's THINK
Forum on Sept. 22, Bloomberg
noted that NYC has surpassed
Boston in becoming the second
largest recipient of venture capital
funding and that NYC has ambi
tions to surpass Silicon Valley's
lead.
"The country needs another
major innovation center that would
have some of the dynamism and ca
pability and impact that Silicon Val
ley has had," Hennessy said. "That's
in the best interests of the country."
Hennessy added that being at
the right place at the right time is
key to successful innovation. Hav
ing students and faculty in NYC
could significantly shape the Uni
versity's ability to contribute to
solving urban problems.
Twenty-five other schools re
main in the running, including New
York University (NYU), Cornell
University and Columbia Universi
ty. NYU and Columbia are both
based in the city, and Cornell's med
ical school is also housed there.
Hennessy cited Stanford's 3,000-
mile distance as one of the unique
hurdles the University faces in com

parison to other runners. One po
tential way for Stanford to over
come that distance is to partner
with various universities and indus
try partners. A Sept. 20 WSJ report
stated that Stanford is in talks with
the City University of New York
(CUNY) about collaborating to
some degree in creating the center.
Hennessy confirmed the University
has engaged in preliminary talks
with CUNY.
When asked about the chal
lenges that such a distance might
present if Stanford were to win the
bid, however, Hennessy expressed
confidence in the potential for
groundbreaking collaboration be
tween the two campuses.
"A New York campus offers us
an opportunity to develop a new
model for a multi-campus universi
ty, one that allows us to maintain the
excellence of Stanford," he said.
A presence on the East Coast will
allow the University to attract facul
ty who might not otherwise join
Stanford for geographical reasons.

He also predicted that the need
for better long-distance communi
cation will give rise to the develop
ment of new conferencing tech
nologies bridging geographic barri
ers that can be used by other uni
versities, businesses and institu
tions.
"As you know, flying is no longer
a great experience," Hennessy said.
"There is too much overhead; it is
extremely inefficient, and it is bad
for the environment. So if we can
find away to work virtually, I think
you can justify very large expendi
tures in return for eliminating small
numbers of trips."
Hennessy likened the NYC bid
to several "landmark decisions" in
the University's history, from its
foundation to move the medical
school to Palo Alto and build one of
the world's leading medical re
search institutions.
"These and many other ground
breaking decisions transformed the
shape and direction of the Universi
ty over the years," Hennessy said.

"Having a presence in New York
would be comparable it would
offer Stanford new opportunities to
evolve,"
The deadline for universities' re
sponses to the Request for Propos
als (RFP) is Oct. 28. The New York
City Economic Development Cor
poration (NYCEDC) committee

assessing the responses expects to
make a decision by the end of this
year.

dependently said the amount of
funding the University plans to allo
cate to public relations firm Edel
man and political consulting firm
Tusk, recently hired to assist with
the bid, is negligible.
In a speech at IBM's THINK
Forum on Sept. 22, Bloomberg
noted that NYC has surpassed
Boston in becoming the second
largest recipient of venture capital
funding and that NYC has ambi
tions to surpass Silicon Valley's
lead.
"The country needs another
major innovation center that would
have some of the dynamism and ca
pability and impact that Silicon Val
ley has had," Hennessy said. "That's
in the best interests of the country."
Hennessy added that being at
the right place at the right time is
key to successful innovation. Hav
ing students and faculty in NYC
could significantly shape the Uni
versity's ability to contribute to
solving urban problems.
Twenty-five other schools re
main in the running, including New
York University (NYU), Cornell
University and Columbia Universi
ty. NYU and Columbia are both
based in the city, and Cornell's med
ical school is also housed there.
Hennessy cited Stanford's 3,000-
mile distance as one of the unique
hurdles the University faces in com

parison to other runners. One po
tential way for Stanford to over
come that distance is to partner
with various universities and indus
try partners. A Sept. 20 WSJ report
stated that Stanford is in talks with
the City University of New York
(CUNY) about collaborating to
some degree in creating the center.
Hennessy confirmed the University
has engaged in preliminary talks
with CUNY.
When asked about the chal
lenges that such a distance might
present if Stanford were to win the
bid, however, Hennessy expressed
confidence in the potential for
groundbreaking collaboration be
tween the two campuses.
"A New York campus offers us
an opportunity to develop a new
model for a multi-campus universi
ty, one that allows us to maintain the
excellence of Stanford," he said.
A presence on the East Coast will
allow the University to attract facul
ty who might not otherwise join
Stanford for geographical reasons.

He also predicted that the need
for better long-distance communi
cation will give rise to the develop
ment of new conferencing tech
nologies bridging geographic barri
ers that can be used by other uni
versities, businesses and institu
tions.
"As you know, flying is no longer
a great experience," Hennessy said.
"There is too much overhead; it is
extremely inefficient, and it is bad
for the environment. So if we can
find away to work virtually, I think
you can justify very large expendi
tures in return for eliminating small
numbers of trips."
Hennessy likened the NYC bid
to several "landmark decisions" in
the University's history, from its
foundation to move the medical
school to Palo Alto and build one of
the world's leading medical re
search institutions.
"These and many other ground
breaking decisions transformed the
shape and direction of the Universi
ty over the years," Hennessy said.

"Having a presence in New York
would be comparable it would
offer Stanford new opportunities to
evolve,"
The deadline for universities' re
sponses to the Request for Propos
als (RFP) is Oct. 28. The New York
City Economic Development Cor
poration (NYCEDC) committee

assessing the responses expects to
make a decision by the end of this
year.
