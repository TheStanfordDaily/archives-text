## Endowment increases by 19.5 percent 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Kurt Chirbas 
Stanford's endowment grew by
19.5 percent over the past year, an in
crease that has been attributed to re
turns on investments, endowment
gifts and other funds that have been
rolled into the endowment, accord
ing to a University statement.
On Aug. 31, the last day of Stan
ford's previous fiscal year, the Uni
versity's endowment stood at $16.5
billion. In comparison, Harvard
University's endowment, reported
a 21 percent increase for the 2011
fiscal year and currently claims the
largest endowment in the world at
$32 billion.

Stanford's investment returns
have also seen an uptick, achieving a
12-month return of 22 percent for a
period that ended on June 30.The in
vestment pool which is controlled
by the Stanford Management Com
pany (SMC), a division of the Uni
versity — includes most of the en
dowment, as well as funds from Stan
ford Hospital & Clinics and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
This is the University's second
straight year of investment gains.
Last year, Stanford posted a 14.4
percent return on its investments,
following a 25.9 investment loss in
2009, which has been credited to the
stock market crash and the bank
ruptcy of the Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc. However, even with
these gains, the endowment still
trails the $17.2 billion it was valued
at on Aug. 31.

"We are pleased with our returns
for fiscal 2011. But we remain con
cerned about the uncertain macro
economic climate and its impact on
global financial markets," John Pow
ers, CEO of SMC, said in a Universi
ty statement.
