## SPRIE moves to GSB for global focus 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Program on Re
gions of Innovation and Entrepre
neurship (SPRIE) announced its
move from the Walter H. Shoren
stein Asia-Pacific Research Cen
ter (APARC) to the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) on
Sept. 13. The privately and inde
pendently funded SPRIE, estab
lished in 1998, is an interdiscipli

nary, international research pro
gram focused on how high-tech re
gions grow and are sustained over
time.
The program has five research
focus areas: China 2.0, Japanese
Entrepreneurship, Smart Green
Cities, Telecom Regulation in
India and the Silicon Valley Pro
ject. SPRIE Directors, all of whom
have been or are affiliated with
the GSB, cited the program's global
focus as a major reason for its move.
"The immediate environment
will have an effect, and the immedi
ate environment will be global,"
said one SPRIE Faculty Director
Henry Rowen. "Asia is a pretty big
place, but the world is even bigger
and that's the big difference."
Research will be targeted to
ward academic audiences, policy
makers and business leaders, ac
cording to SPRIE Associate Direc
tor Marguerite Gong Hancock. In
the past week, SPRIE hosted a Chi
nese delegation of over two dozen
policy makers from national min
istries, provinces and major cities.
"We conduct training programs
for senior policy makers from other
regions and national-level govern
ments," Hancock said. "We either
bring our research to them in their
countries or they come and spend
time with us here at Stanford."
SPRIE researches how innova
tion and entrepreneurship help cre
ate economic value. The regional
focus is what Hancock believes dif
ferentiates the program from oth
ers.
"Some programs focus on the

national level and some on the firm
level, and we do the regional level,"
Hancock said. "It's explicitly re
gional and explicitly international
and comparative."
Interviews, drawing on expertise
from other regions, workshops and
other forms of research provide the
basic framework of operation.
"Our role is to integrate all the
forms of research to pull it all to
gether, based on our experience in
different regions, and this becomes
the basis for our findings," said a
SPRIE Faculty Director William
Miller.
SPRIE has ties in its focus re
gions, as well as on the Stanford
campus.
"We will continue to expand our
programs but our goal is to link
them with other activities at Stan
ford â€” we progress by being col
laborative with other groups,"
Miller said.
Among these groups are univer
sities, government agencies and
companies in the program's focus
regions, including Tokyo University
and the Japanese Ministry of Econ
omy, Trade and Industry. On cam
pus, SPRIE collaborates with the
Department of Management Sci
ence and Engineering and faculty
who teach entrepreneurship in the
School of Engineering. The pro
gram is also a co-sponsor of Entre
preneurship Week.

On Sept. 30, SPRIE will host the
first of four major conferences
scheduled for this academic year.
The "China 2.0" conference, the
third in a series on the rise of the In
ternet industry in China, will ad
dress media and commerce.
"We have a lineup of alums from
the venture capital world, entrepre
neurs and people who are actively
leading growth in China's Internet
industry," Hancock said.
"There's a flow of talent and
ideas between the United States
and China, and we research what is
happening there, what kind of inno
vation is coming out of China and
what the implications will be for
global players," she added.
The conference, as well as
SPRIE's seminars and events
throughout the year, are open and
free to students.
