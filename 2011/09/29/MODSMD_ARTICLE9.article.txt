## A
						STANFORD STATE OF MIND Entrepreneurial ferment a draw for Danish visitors 
### TYLER BROWN MANAGING EDITOR 
C C ~W" nnovation" is a quintessential
I Stanford buzzword after all, it's
the alma mater of countless entrepre
neurs over the years. The research
generated by its intellectual ferment
has been one of the largest driving forces for the
Bay Area's high-tech industry. Not to downplay its
significance, establishing a comparable environ
ment is no easy task, and the word serves as a bea
con for those who dream of similar academic and
economic successes.
Denmark's Science Minister, Charlotte Sahl-
Madsen, with a group of Danish university presi
dents and administrators, visited Silicon Valley this
summer. They spent their visit touring Stanford,
meeting with BASES leaders, visiting StartX, an or
ganization that helps young Stanford-affiliated en
trepreneurs get off the ground, and hearing from
management science and engineering lecturer
Steve Blank.
The Danes' goal was to learn how to sharpen the
focus on entrepreneurship and innovation at their
universities, according to a statement by the Min
istry of Science, Technology and Innovation.
In Silicon Valley, "we've been drinking the Kool-
Aid," Sahl-Madsen said, keen to bring the mindset
back to Denmark. "We all share the vision to in
spire and promote the entrepreneurial mindset."
"The young entrepreneurs, they produce growth
both personally and financially," she added a po
tential boon for the unremarkable Danish econo
my.
But how are these "young entrepreneurs" creat
ed in the first place? Blank, a serial entrepreneur,
offered his take.
"I will contest that Silicon Valley is a state of
mind," he said in remarks to the Minister and her
associates. "The real thing we make here now is in
novation."
To sustain innovation, Blank pointed to the
need for "disruptive innovations," which redefine a
market and are most often the product of start-ups.
"In a large company, they execute," he said.
"No one ever uses the word 'innovation' with
Microsoft anymore," he added.
Even Facebook or Google, which are still con
sidered by many to be on the cutting edge of soft
ware technology, aren't "disruptive" start-ups any
more both have established themselves as semi

permanent fixtures in the local
and world economies.
Blank defined a start-up as a temporary
vehicle in search of a scalable business model.
"Start-ups need a business model, not a business
plan," Blank said. "No business plan survives first
contact with customers they're just hypotheses."
"Outside Stanford," he added, "they're actually
called guesses. Most start-ups are wrong on day
one."
And "founders are not everybody," he said.
They're "artists" or "composers" who create some
thing from nothing. And the infrastructure is here
to support them. According to Blank, a 22-year-old
with the right presentation can get $4 million from
a venture capitalist a comment that seemed to
surprise the Danes.
But what about failure? In Silicon Valley, a
failed entrepreneur is experienced, Blank said.
Among circles of failed entrepreneurs, the ques
tion is always, "What company are you doing
next?"
After hearing from Blank, Sahl-Madsen and
the rest of the group moved on to AOL's headquar
ters on Page Mill Road. There, they heard from
StartX founder Cameron Teitelman TO and then
from venture capitalist Vinod Khosla.
In many ways, Khosla struck a tone similar to
Blank's.
"My willingness to fail gives me the ability to
succeed," Khosla said in prepared remarks to the
Danish group, the StartX and community mem
bers in the audience.
He added that innovation is irreverent, in away,
taking an unusual or underappreciated approach
to a problem, which was why disruptive innova
tions take markets by surprise.
"The inability to predict innovation causes
these forecasts to be wrong," Khosla said.
"I truly believe process depends on unreason
able people," he added.
A Stanford education, among other things, is
designed to equip graduates with the skills to find
the "right" way to both follow the founder's vision
and market a viable product the key is "to in
form an artist's opinion," Blank said in his remarks,
and to give Khosla's "unreasonable people" a
framework for building and pushing their ideas.
Soon, maybe Danish educations will do the
same.
