# Belief in potential for change increases likelihood of compromise, study indicates

Simply telling Palestinians and Israelis on opposite
sides of the contentious conflict that people are general
ly capable of change can dramatically increase their will
ingness to compromise, according to a paper written by
Stanford researchers and published in the journal Sci
ence.
"Most conflict resolution strategies require you to
bring the two groups together," said Stanford psycholo
gy professor Carol Dweck in an interview with the Stan
ford Report. "But just attempting this in an incendiary
conflict can cause people to react negatively."
Without mentioning specific adversaries, Stanford re
searchers found that presenting articles suggesting peo
ple could change over time actually improved the
chances that the reader would be willing to make com
promises in their own region's conflict; case studies indi
cated this in areas such as North Ireland and Yugoslavia.
Also surprising to the researchers was that even those
with no interest in the issue showed similar results.
"I think the most amazing results were from the West
Bank Palestinians," Dweck said. "These included mem
bers of Fatah and Hamas people who have no stake in
the continued existence of Israel."
