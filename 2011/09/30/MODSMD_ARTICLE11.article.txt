# New process shows role RNA plays in unlocking genes

Stanford researchers developed away to pinpoint the
exact location of DNA sequences bound by regulatory
RNAs by finding where RNA molecules were binding
on chromatin, according to dermatology professor and
lead author Howard Chang in a press release.
Regulatory RNAs are a critical part of many cell
processes, especially those related to regeneration and
development. They are also a critical part of unlocking
genes.
Messenger RNAs were first identified half a century
ago, and over the years, the information flow from DNA
to RNA to protein became a central tenet of molecular
biology. The discovery of regulatory RNAs have chal
lenged that view, since they bind to DNA and affect
which genes lead to protein synthesis.
Given the propensity of these long intergenic non
coding RNAs, or "lincßNAs," in chromatin, researchers
wondered exactly where the binding sites were that reg
ulate gene function.
"To capture this picture, you have to trap that interac
tion between lincßNAs and chromatin in living cells,"
Chang said. "It was not at all obvious how to do that."
Using their technique, the group was able to examine
the binding of three lincßNAs, two from mammals and
one from the fruit fly. Since they weren't sure which part
of the lincRNA bound to the chro
matin, they created tagged "probes"
that would bind to the lincRNA and
ensure that, even if the RNA mole
cule started to fall apart during the
test, they would still be able to iso
late what was left on the chromatin.
"Taken together, our research
shows that our technique is widely
applicable and can vastly enrich our
understanding of how regulatory
RNAs unlock the genome in many
very specific ways," Chang said.
