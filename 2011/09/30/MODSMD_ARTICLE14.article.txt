## EDITORIAL Time to hit the e-books? 
### 
Anew quarter heralds the
mad scrambling of count
less students to the Stan
ford Bookstore, where row after
row of shelves on the lower level
are stacked to capacity. The sounds
of rustling pages are invariably
punctuated by a few sharp gasps
and stifled exclamations. No, text
books aren't cheap.

Textbooks have never been
known to be trivial purchases, but
three-digit prices for single books
continue to catch students off
guard. As a result, students have
devised strategies to cut their costs
by utilizing third-party vendors, re
lying on online marketplaces and
shamelessly spamming email lists
with textbook offers and requests.
One downside of this strategic text
book buying is that students may
not have their books for the first
few days or even weeks of class, af
fecting their ability to complete
early assignments and come to
class prepared. Not only may the
students be at a disadvantage, but
the Bookstore too would rather
not lose its textbook sales to out
side suppliers.
The store responded last year
with a major initiative to provide
more affordable options for text
book purchases, participation in Fol
lett's Rent-a-Text program. Rented
textbooks are cheaper than new
books and conveniently allow stu
dents to rid themselves of unwanted
books at the end of a quarter.
Still, the prices of rented text
books are no less than half the cost
of their new counterparts. At the
same time, the rental period is only
a quarter, while a purchased book
can be kept indefinitely. This may
be a relatively advantageous sys
tem for students dabbling in fields
that they will likely not return to
again in their college career. How
ever, for those students who tend to
utilize older textbooks as reference
material for future classes, it is
preferable to own their books.
Another way to trim the cost of
textbook purchases is to opt for a
digital textbook, or e-textbook. In
an age of Kindles and iPads, e-text
books have already gained ground.
This advance in the e-textbook in
dustry seems to have eluded the
Bookstore, whose website has a
"Digital Books" category without
providing a list of products.
Just as one can obtain hardcopy
books from third party vendors, it is
already quite easy to download

electronic copies of textbooks from
other websites. The Bookstore
could retain its hardcopy textbook
commerce while simultaneously
streamlining the book-buying
process for many students by
adding an e-textbook option.

At least one viable model has al
ready been tested in a higher edu
cation setting. Last year Indiana
University began a pilot project
with several large publishers in
which the university acts as a bro
ker, requiring students to purchase
e-textbooks from publishers with a
materials fee charged by the uni
versity. As of last month, 1,700 stu
dents and professors participated
in the program, a number roughly
similar to an undergraduate class at
Stanford. As for value, students
could keep their e-textbooks
throughout their entire student ca
reer and even received an addition
al 20 percent discount from one
publisher.
Of course, the preference for
paper versus digital textbooks will
surely outweigh economic consid
erations for some students. But re
gardless of whether "most" stu
dents prefer one medium or the
other, the Bookstore certainly
should not limit students' choices.
As the situation stands now, stu
dents can go to the Bookstore in
order to buy or rent books, and
those students determined to save
space or money must then track
down their requisite textbooks on
line. The process of purchasing e
textbooks should be streamlined
and included under the auspices of
the Bookstore in coming quarters.
