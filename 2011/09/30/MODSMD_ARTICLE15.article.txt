# SEEING GREEN
## Across the fruited plain? 
### Holly Moeller 
I've made a lot of cross-country
flights in the last few weeks, the
most recent taking me home to
New Jersey and then out to my
cousin's wedding (congrats, Jason
and Olivia!) at the edge of the corn
belt. When I'm not catching up on
sleep or contemplating my
hypocrisy as my carbon footprint
balloons by the minute, it turns out
that gazing out of an airplane win
dow is one of my favorite ways to
relax.

Today, still on the tarmac, I'm
looking at gray skies and a gentle
drizzle. The landscape extends, flat
and smooth, to a gently curved hori
zon. I know that when we take to
the air, in those few moments be
tween achieving liftoff and punch
ing through the cloud cover, I will
see corn and soybean plants filling
those endless miles. Eventually,
passing west, the square-shaped,
tree-dotted fields will give way to
the brown-edged circles of modern

irrigation. Still farther, we'll pass
over vast acres of rangeland, zoom
across the deserts in the rain shad
ow of the Rocky Mountains (some
of the prettiest landscape I know
from the air), skip across the Cen
tral Valley, dip down and tilt right,
and touch down in SFO at precisely
the moment I think the plane will
find the waters of the Bay before
the end of the runway.
I think about when I first began
to find the American landscape
troubling rather than fascinating

and often beautiful. The memories
invariably lead to David Ehren
feld's conservation ecology class
and the lectures on factory farming,
cheap oil and sustainability that in
spired my first Seeing Green
columns.

Amber waves of grain became
symbols of our global dependence
on industrial agriculture. Purple
mountain majesties became the last
refuge of species squeezed by cli

mate change.
Today, we rely on our park sys
tems to remind us of a long-lost past
and take modern infrastructure for
granted. In the shifting baselines of
our perceptions, we rarely ask what
has been paved over by roads and
shopping malls. Where our uncles
once competed to catch the biggest
fish, we never think to drop a line.
Where our grandparents once came
to the stark edge of civilization, we
now zoom by arching overpasses.

But we have to call these views
into question. We have to ask our
selves what things used to be like
and how they have changed. That's
the only way that we'll be able to
keep some track of reality, the only
