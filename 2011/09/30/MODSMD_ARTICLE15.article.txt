# SEEING GREEN
## Across the fruited plain? 
### Holly Moeller 
I've made a lot of cross-country
flights in the last few weeks, the
most recent taking me home to
New Jersey and then out to my
cousin's wedding (congrats, Jason
and Olivia!) at the edge of the corn
belt. When I'm not catching up on
sleep or contemplating my
hypocrisy as my carbon footprint
balloons by the minute, it turns out
that gazing out of an airplane win
dow is one of my favorite ways to
relax.

Today, still on the tarmac, I'm
looking at gray skies and a gentle
drizzle. The landscape extends, flat
and smooth, to a gently curved hori
zon. I know that when we take to
the air, in those few moments be
tween achieving liftoff and punch
ing through the cloud cover, I will
see corn and soybean plants filling
those endless miles. Eventually,
passing west, the square-shaped,
tree-dotted fields will give way to
the brown-edged circles of modern

irrigation. Still farther, we'll pass
over vast acres of rangeland, zoom
across the deserts in the rain shad
ow of the Rocky Mountains (some
of the prettiest landscape I know
from the air), skip across the Cen
tral Valley, dip down and tilt right,
and touch down in SFO at precisely
the moment I think the plane will
find the waters of the Bay before
the end of the runway.
I think about when I first began
to find the American landscape
troubling rather than fascinating

and often beautiful. The memories
invariably lead to David Ehren
feld's conservation ecology class
and the lectures on factory farming,
cheap oil and sustainability that in
spired my first Seeing Green
columns.

Amber waves of grain became
symbols of our global dependence
on industrial agriculture. Purple
mountain majesties became the last
refuge of species squeezed by cli

mate change.
Today, we rely on our park sys
tems to remind us of a long-lost past
and take modern infrastructure for
granted. In the shifting baselines of
our perceptions, we rarely ask what
has been paved over by roads and
shopping malls. Where our uncles
once competed to catch the biggest
fish, we never think to drop a line.
Where our grandparents once came
to the stark edge of civilization, we
now zoom by arching overpasses.

But we have to call these views
into question. We have to ask our
selves what things used to be like
and how they have changed. That's
the only way that we'll be able to
keep some track of reality, the only

way we'll tether ourselves to the
ground on which we've built. That's
how we'll remember that New Or
leans will always be flood-prone,
why some crop fields lose fertility
faster than others, which plants tol
erate drought and which tolerate
cold. And so when baselines shift
and times change again, we'll be
able to use our past knowledge
not just our present to help us
adapt.

We'll also be better equipped to
decide whether the changes we're
witnessing are for the better. Most
of us respond to change with suspi
cion. We like our comfortable rou

tines. And we've grown up hearing
our relatives sigh over "the way
things used to be."
Whether things are improving or
going downhill is a matter of per
sonal opinion. But I'll leave you
with one gray story, a mixed bag of
blessing and curse, first told to me
five years ago by Ehrenfeld. It's the
story of the Green Revolution, re
sponsible for the vast crop fields
now passing 10,000 feet below me.
Once upon a time (i.e., in 1798),
a man named Malthus predicted
that the growing human population
would quickly outstrip its ability to
grow food for itself. While the
human population has doubled sev
eral times since his ominous words,
his predictions of widespread
famine have not come to pass.
That's largely because by the 19605,
through the work of Norman Bor

laug and others, we'd bred high
yielding (if rather needy) crop lines
that double or triple the output of
an acre of land.

In our rather pessimistic pres
ent, we often look at this Green
Revolution with disdain: nurturing
these crops requires a huge capital
investment, extensive irrigation,
heavy doses of fertilizer and pesti
cides and so forth. Worse, it's a fun
damentally unsustainable opera
tion that relies heavily on cheap fos
sil fuels.

But maybe we're forgetting
because few of us have seen it our
selves what it's like to be truly
hungry, what it means to be starv
ing. We're forgetting what a boon it
was to save upwards of a billion
people from that fate. And we're
forgetting that, by intensifying the
use of existing farmland, we've

spared land (some of it now tucked
away into parks and preserves) that
would otherwise be under the plow.
Ask yourself: for better or for
worse? And what happens next?
Meanwhile, I'll return to my
view, where the cloud cover below
has fallen away and a series of wind
turbines march across the land
scape. They are a new addition:
baselines have shifted and things
have changed. And depending on
how you weigh migratory birds
against alternative energy, you
might even say they've changed for
the better.

though hopefully not from the air—for
another quarter. Send comments, carbon
footprint comparisons and other in

I've made a lot of cross-country
flights in the last few weeks, the
most recent taking me home to
New Jersey and then out to my
cousin's wedding (congrats, Jason
and Olivia!) at the edge of the corn
belt. When I'm not catching up on
sleep or contemplating my
hypocrisy as my carbon footprint
balloons by the minute, it turns out
that gazing out of an airplane win
dow is one of my favorite ways to
relax.

Today, still on the tarmac, I'm
looking at gray skies and a gentle
drizzle. The landscape extends, flat
and smooth, to a gently curved hori
zon. I know that when we take to
the air, in those few moments be
tween achieving liftoff and punch
ing through the cloud cover, I will
see corn and soybean plants filling
those endless miles. Eventually,
passing west, the square-shaped,
tree-dotted fields will give way to
the brown-edged circles of modern

irrigation. Still farther, we'll pass
over vast acres of rangeland, zoom
across the deserts in the rain shad
ow of the Rocky Mountains (some
of the prettiest landscape I know
from the air), skip across the Cen
tral Valley, dip down and tilt right,
and touch down in SFO at precisely
the moment I think the plane will
find the waters of the Bay before
the end of the runway.
I think about when I first began
to find the American landscape
troubling rather than fascinating

and often beautiful. The memories
invariably lead to David Ehren
feld's conservation ecology class
and the lectures on factory farming,
cheap oil and sustainability that in
spired my first Seeing Green
columns.

Amber waves of grain became
symbols of our global dependence
on industrial agriculture. Purple
mountain majesties became the last
refuge of species squeezed by cli

mate change.
Today, we rely on our park sys
tems to remind us of a long-lost past
and take modern infrastructure for
granted. In the shifting baselines of
our perceptions, we rarely ask what
has been paved over by roads and
shopping malls. Where our uncles
once competed to catch the biggest
fish, we never think to drop a line.
Where our grandparents once came
to the stark edge of civilization, we
now zoom by arching overpasses.

But we have to call these views
into question. We have to ask our
selves what things used to be like
and how they have changed. That's
the only way that we'll be able to
keep some track of reality, the only

way we'll tether ourselves to the
ground on which we've built. That's
how we'll remember that New Or
leans will always be flood-prone,
why some crop fields lose fertility
faster than others, which plants tol
erate drought and which tolerate
cold. And so when baselines shift
and times change again, we'll be
able to use our past knowledge
not just our present to help us
adapt.

We'll also be better equipped to
decide whether the changes we're
witnessing are for the better. Most
of us respond to change with suspi
cion. We like our comfortable rou

tines. And we've grown up hearing
our relatives sigh over "the way
things used to be."
Whether things are improving or
going downhill is a matter of per
sonal opinion. But I'll leave you
with one gray story, a mixed bag of
blessing and curse, first told to me
five years ago by Ehrenfeld. It's the
story of the Green Revolution, re
sponsible for the vast crop fields
now passing 10,000 feet below me.
Once upon a time (i.e., in 1798),
a man named Malthus predicted
that the growing human population
would quickly outstrip its ability to
grow food for itself. While the
human population has doubled sev
eral times since his ominous words,
his predictions of widespread
famine have not come to pass.
That's largely because by the 19605,
through the work of Norman Bor

laug and others, we'd bred high
yielding (if rather needy) crop lines
that double or triple the output of
an acre of land.

In our rather pessimistic pres
ent, we often look at this Green
Revolution with disdain: nurturing
these crops requires a huge capital
investment, extensive irrigation,
heavy doses of fertilizer and pesti
cides and so forth. Worse, it's a fun
damentally unsustainable opera
tion that relies heavily on cheap fos
sil fuels.

selves what it's like to be truly
