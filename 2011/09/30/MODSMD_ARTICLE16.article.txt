On a course for
employment

Dear Editor:
Welcome back, seniors. Are you
already stressed about what you're
doing with that amorphous snafu
called "life" after you graduate?
Are you wondering how you're
going to avoid being a boomerang
child in the worst labor market for
your age group since the great de
pression? You're not alone.

On the whole, Stanford academ
ic departments do not do enough to
formally prepare undergraduate
students to successfully transition
into the working world, and it's time
for that to change. There are lots of
opportunities for students to be
come savvy in the employment hunt
while they are here. Being on any
major email list floods your inbox
with internship opportunities. The
Career Development Center has
people who will help you. Many
campus organizations and commu
nity centers, from the Business As

sociation of Stanford Entrepre
neurial Studies (BASES) to the
Haas Center for Public Service,
offer the opportunity to connect
with successful professionals from
around the world while you're on
the Farm.

However, students' preparation
to look for, apply to and successful
ly attain jobs is highly variable.
Some students already have a post
graduation job lined up before
starting their senior year, but some
don't even know how to start look
ing after the year has ended. Every
Stanford student should graduate
knowing what jobs are available in
their field and how they can best be
in a position to attain them. And
every student who enters a major
should have access to nationwide
and Stanford-specific information
about what people in that major do
after college. This information
should not only be stories about
graduates that got great jobs they
had never imagined; it should also
tell the stories of graduates who
didn't.

Two changes come to mind when
I think about addressing this issue.
First each undergraduate major
should organize a course maybe
optional, maybe required that
helps students in that major learn
how to market themselves and their
major-related skills when job hunt
ing. They should bring in speakers,
career counselors and previous job
hunters. There should also be an el
ement that focuses on long-term life
goals as they relate to your career.
Second, each major should be re
sponsible for a website that gives
students information about what
people in that major do after they
graduate. Students need to know
hard facts when they enter a major
about what people tend to do after
they complete that major.
For some students, these steps
would be superfluous. But, they
would go a long way toward making
sure every Stanford graduate has a
better chance of getting a job after
graduating.
