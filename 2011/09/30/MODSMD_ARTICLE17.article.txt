# THE
						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## Negotiating the bubble 
### D.S NELSON 
Think globally. Be open. Be toler
ant of other views. Don't be dis
missive; engage with the materi
al and the opinions of others. Fresh
men are fed a steady diet of happy
cliches during NSO. However, each is
as dishonest and fundamentally illib
eral as the last. What they entail is not
a sponsorship of thought and a forma
tion of substantiated opinions but a
shaming of critical judgment of sym
pathetic positions, one that reserves
real ire only for the straw men made
up of the beliefs of the ever-absent
American conservative.

It is not a bad thing that Stanford is
a very liberal place. This is true of most
colleges and often signals a healthy
amount of empathy and involvement.
Perhaps it could even be said that the
left-leaning nature of our campus
serves to show that we recognize the
troubles many face outside of our
lovely bubble. What's bad, though, is
letting the absence of another side let
introspection, reflection and refine
ment of one's own views fall by the
wayside.
Faith in liberalism's moral founda

tions is bad for the same reason any
unquestioned faith is bad, and doubly
so in a college environment. Faith
does not brook questioning and im
provement. Faith does not change
with study and does not bend to de
bate. Absolute faith is antithetical to
any serious college's mission.
But with liberalism, this faith is
more insidious, more insistent, be
cause it seems to agree with our up
bringings that praise empathy, that
value the teary moments of Christ
mas comedies where the wealthier
family gives up its extra presents to
the poor because it recognizes the
importance of altruism, of minimiz
ing class distinctions and doing what
ever possible with one's excess to
minimize the shortfalls of others. We
find all of these things to be good.
They agree with our sympathies, our
most hopeful views of people being
fundamentally good and industrious,
rarely sidetracked from realizing
these traits as anything but social
problems for which they cannot be
held in the slightest responsible. We
feel bad and inhumane for betraying

our faith in people, for not ameliorat
ing poor living conditions where they
exist. But the fact of the matter is that
politics and philosophy have necessi
ties to bend to, and the solutions (and
lingering assumptions) of MGM-pro
duced worlds don't work or hold true.
Nowhere is this more evident than
in America's entitlement spending.
Entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid,
Social Security) comprise the majori
ty of the federal government's spend
ing. Mandatory spending on entitle
ments and the servicing of our debt
are forecasted to exceed total govern
ment revenue sometime around 2024.
If the entire U.S. Military was jetti
soned, every federal employee fired
and every expenditure on roads, edu
cation and culture cut, we would still
be running a deficit. Entitlements, ar
guably the most humane and sympa
thetic part of government spending,
will quite literally cannibalize the
United States if they are not ad
dressed. If the federal government in
creases taxation in step with the nec
essary increases in entitlement spend
ing, the economy will eventually cease

to grow at an adequate pace to keep
up. Regardless of whether it feels
right, cuts in care and social aid will
happen, and our liberal sympathies
will be put through the gauntlet of re
ality. We will be forced to pick and
choose who gets what money, con
fronting fiscal realities and assigning
value in our judgments of who de
serves funds the most.

While many seek to avoid these
questions or shift responsibility for
widespread social failings onto the
shoulders of the government, I have
to ask: is there a point where people
and the culture they create are to
blame (and the only thing that can cre
ate change)? Arguments that hinge
on personal responsibility are decried
as brutal and misguided, but rarely
does any of our campus discourse
confront these serious problems with
anything more than a slogan for a re
sponse, Now it has come to a head. We
can either bankrupt ourselves by
blindly continuing on our path or try,
in some way, to fix the problems that
cause such difficult spending situa
tions. But the standard Stanford path

of calling for more funding, more at
tention and more sympathy has be
come a dead end.
There are legitimate moral ques
tions that lie at the base of these argu
ments, and they are not so simple as
their caricaturized depictions often
suggest. Rarely does the difference in
policy amount solely to succumbing to
corporate greed or stating, "I'll keep
my money, you keep yours." Stanford
happily accepts such simplistic cliches

It's time to bring
our intelligence
into play in the
home court.
