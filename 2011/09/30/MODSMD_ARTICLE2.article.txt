## UCLA TO CHALLENGE CARD UP FRONT IN SKOV'S ABSENCE 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After a week away from game ac
tion, the Stanford football team fi
nally returns to work at home this
Saturday against UCLA, hoping to
pick up right where it left off and
continue the nation's longest win
ning streak.
The Cardinal (3-0,1-0 Pac-12) au
thored three dominant performanc
es before its bye week and is a large
favorite against the Bruins (2-2,1-0);
but all eyes will be on a Stanford de
fense that is missing junior line
backer and team-leading tackier
Shayne Skov and with good rea
son.

The Bruins boast two solid run
ning backs in Johnathan Franklin
and Derrick Coleman, each of whom
have amassed nearly 300 yards rush
ing already. Chances are they will go
right after the heart of a Cardinal de
fense that is ranked number one
against the rush in the country, allow
ing only 36 yards per game, but the
defense won't tolerate any drop in
performance despite the loss of
Skov.

"We're going to play hard, make
sure we do our own jobs," said senior
safety Delano Howell. "They are re
ally good running backs and they
run hard, but we just have to make
sure and [sic] be physical, and that's
the type of defense that we think we
are."

"We've got [junior linebacker]
Jarek Lancaster stepping up and we
have a lot of confidence in him; and
we're just going to have high expec
tations for our performance," How
ell continued.

In addition to the ground tandem

of Franklin and Coleman, the Bru
ins' pistol offense also relies heavily
on wideout Nelson Rosario, who, at
6-foot-5 and 219 pounds, will be the
biggest target the Cardinal has faced
all season. Rosario leads the team
with 15 receptions for 277 yards and
made one of the most spectacular

NOTES ! No. 6 Stanford hopes to remain the
only undefeated team in the Pac-12 and
extend the nation's longest active winning
streak. Coming off a bye week, the Cardi
nal will have to adjust to life after junior
linebacker Shayne Skov, who is out for the
season with a knee injury.


plays of the young college football
season by pinning a ball on the back
of a Houston Cougar defensive back
and falling to the ground with the
ball and cornerback still safely in his
possession.

After the Cardinal secondary al
lowed Arizona quarterback Nick
Foles to complete his first 17 passes
two weeks ago, Howell said he and
the rest of the defense respect the
threat that Rosario poses.
"We understand he's big and he's
a great athlete and he's a great play
maker," Howell said. "So what we're
going to have to do is step up and un
derstand when there is an opportu
nity to go up for the ball, we're going
to go up for it."
Additionally, the defense will be
looking to force some turnovers
after failing to record a one against
Arizona last week. In last season's
game against UCLA, the Cardinal
snagged two picks and took away
two fumbles including a fumble
return for a touchdown by senior
safety Michael Thomas on its way
to a dominant 35-0 road victory,
Stanford's first win at the Rose Bowl
since 1996.
Howell allowed that the defense
was going to have to improve on last
week's performance, particularly
against quarterback Richard Bre
haut, who has yet to throw an inter
ception this season.
"[The lack of turnovers] is not be
cause of a lack of opportunities,"
Howell said. "We have opportuni
ties, we just have to make sure we
take advantage of them. It's as sim
ple as that."
On the opposite side of the ball,
though, Stanford will face a defense
that gives up 30.8 points per game
and is largely responsible for the
Bruins' two losses through four
games. In the first game of the sea
son, Houston quarterback Case
Keenum piled up 310 yards while
completing 30 of 40 passes en route
to a 38-34 upset victory, and the
Texas Longhorns lit up the score
board with 488 yards of offense in a

49-20 victory two weeks ago.
That should leave star quarterback
Andrew Luck licking his chops to get
a hold of the depleted Bruin second
ary (four players are currently nursing
injuries), particularly after he only
completed 11 of 24 passes for 151
yards in last year's Cardinal victory.
So far, Luck has been everything
he was expected to be in the presea
son, as the 2010 Heisman runner-up
has passed for 786 yards and eight
touchdowns with just one intercep
tion and is coming off an efficient 20-
for-31, 325-yard, two-touchdown
performance against the Wildcats.
That said, Stanford's offense will

hope to convert opportunities in the
red zone more effectively this week
end after being forced to kick a pair
of field goals in the first half after two
drives stalled inside the 20 against
Arizona.
Junior tight end Levine Toilolo
didn't hint that the offense was doing
anything out of the ordinary in order
to try to push the offense into the
end zone more often, though.
"We'll have periods during the
week where it'll be a third down day
or a red zone day, but we're just com
ing out and working on the basics of
our gameplan," Toilolo said.
After the past week's bye, the

Cardinal will get no more rest for the
remainder of the season, as it takes
on eight consecutive Pac-12 teams
before finishing with a nonconfer
ence matchup against Notre Dame
in the regular season finale. With
such a daunting road ahead (and the
added challenge of classes, which
began Monday), both Toilolo and
Howell anticipate that the Cardinal
will remain focused on its goals.
"[Head coach David Shaw] came
up and gave some wise words, that
once we walked in the door, it's all
football from there on out. I think
everybody has taken it to heart that
during the time that we do have to

focus on football, everybody's got to
be locked in,"Toilolo said.
"We have a very competitive con
ference ... it's very difficult to go
undefeated, even very early [in the
season]," Howell said. "We know
that our road is going to get more dif
ficult from here on ... so we're just
keeping a humble heart and making
sure we play hard."
Stanford and UCLA kick off
from Stanford Stadium at 7:30 p.m
Saturday night. The game will be tel
evised on FSN.

The physical battle between the Cardinal and Bruins will be a main storyline this Saturday. While a season-ending knee injury has sidelined Stanford's most
electrifying defensive player, junior linebacker Shayne Skov, UCLA's secondary is missing several players and could be torn apart by Cardinal tight ends.
