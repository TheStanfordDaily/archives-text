## UCLA TO CHALLENGE CARD UP FRONT IN SKOV'S ABSENCE 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After a week away from game ac
tion, the Stanford football team fi
nally returns to work at home this
Saturday against UCLA, hoping to
pick up right where it left off and
continue the nation's longest win
ning streak.
The Cardinal (3-0,1-0 Pac-12) au
thored three dominant performanc
es before its bye week and is a large
favorite against the Bruins (2-2,1-0);
but all eyes will be on a Stanford de
fense that is missing junior line
backer and team-leading tackier
Shayne Skov and with good rea
son.

The Bruins boast two solid run
ning backs in Johnathan Franklin
and Derrick Coleman, each of whom
have amassed nearly 300 yards rush
ing already. Chances are they will go
right after the heart of a Cardinal de
fense that is ranked number one
against the rush in the country, allow
ing only 36 yards per game, but the
defense won't tolerate any drop in
performance despite the loss of
Skov.

"We're going to play hard, make
sure we do our own jobs," said senior
safety Delano Howell. "They are re
ally good running backs and they
run hard, but we just have to make
sure and [sic] be physical, and that's
the type of defense that we think we
are."

"We've got [junior linebacker]
Jarek Lancaster stepping up and we
have a lot of confidence in him; and
we're just going to have high expec
tations for our performance," How
ell continued.

In addition to the ground tandem

of Franklin and Coleman, the Bru
ins' pistol offense also relies heavily
on wideout Nelson Rosario, who, at
6-foot-5 and 219 pounds, will be the
biggest target the Cardinal has faced
all season. Rosario leads the team
with 15 receptions for 277 yards and
made one of the most spectacular

NOTES ! No. 6 Stanford hopes to remain the
only undefeated team in the Pac-12 and
extend the nation's longest active winning
streak. Coming off a bye week, the Cardi
nal will have to adjust to life after junior
linebacker Shayne Skov, who is out for the
season with a knee injury.
