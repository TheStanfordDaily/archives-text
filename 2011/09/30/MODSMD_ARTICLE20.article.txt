# MIXED MESSAGES
## CARD STARTS STRONG, BUT TOP TEAMS TOO MUCH 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It wasn't always pretty, but the men's water
polo team got its act together over the final
weeks of last season, mounting a late push that
ended just short of the national championship.
The Cardinal lost first-team All-Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation selection Jeffrey Schwim
mer, who scored 33 goals for Stanford in 2010, to
graduation but returns six of its top eight scorers
from last year.

The offense looked very strong at times in the
season-opening NorCal Invitational two weeks
ago, and several freshmen had solid debuts as
Stanford knocked off host Pacific 9-8 in overtime
and St. Francis (N.Y.) 11-6 on the first day of com
petition.

2010 second-te am All-American Jacob Smith,
who led the team with 54 goals a year ago, scored
three goals in the first two games, but freshman

utility Alex Bowen was the talk of the town after
notching five goals in the two matches the San
Diego native scored a hat trick in his college
debut against St. Francis.
But on day two, the Cardinal (2-2) ran into
some stiffer competition. Coach John Vargas'
team couldn't find the net early and couldn't
catch up late in a 12-5 loss at the hands of No. 1
USC (4-0) before losing an 8-7 nail-biter against
No. 2 California (3-1).
Redshirt senior goalie Brian Pingree was test
ed all day long, making 15 saves over the two
matches, but couldn't hold off the defending na
tional champion Trojans in the end.
Smith added to his scoring haul in the third
place game against Cal, finding the net early for a
1-0 lead, but the Bears battled back and ran the
score out to 4-2 before Bowen, Smith and senior
Alex Avery combined to put the Cardinal ahead
5-4 at halftime.
After the teams traded goals in the third period,

Cal jumped back on top with two quick goals to
start the fourth period and held on for the victory.

Bowen and Smith finished the weekend with
seven goals apiece, and Stanford got some much
needed experience against two top-tier teams in
USC and Cal. But it remains to be seen whether
Stanford can finally get over the hump and win
the program's 12th national championship and
first since 2002.
Stanford returns to the pool for the SoCal
Tournament tomorrow in Long Beach, Calif.,
where it will take on Princeton at 10:40 a.m. The
two-day tournament concludes Sunday, and
MPSF play begins next weekend, when the Car
dinal hosts Pepper dine and UC-Santa Barbara
on Friday, Oct. 7 at 7 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 9 at 12
p.m. Both matches will take place at the Avery
Aquatic Center.

early losses to two of the best teams in the nation. Stanford nearly knocked off No. 2 California, but fell 8-7 in a back-and-forth match.
