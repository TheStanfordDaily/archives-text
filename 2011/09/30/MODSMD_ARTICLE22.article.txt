## SUMMER MOVIES 
### 
Sure, all the prestige films come out in the colder winter
months, but summer is when the fun ones roll out. Theres
nothing like escaping the heat in a cool, dark cinema with
the aroma of butter-drenched popcorn wafting through the
air. Now, with classes back in session and papers, p-sets
and exams on our horizon, Intermission takes a look back
at the best summer flicks of 2011.

"Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows: Part 2"
The final cinematic chapter of J.K. Rowling's boy-wizard saga
earned near-universal praise from critics and signified the end
of an era for many fans who grew up with the series.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love"
This smart, tender-hearted film brought a
much-needed boost to the ailing romcom
genre and managed to capture what love
feels like (or how we like to imagine it feels
like) from first love to true love.

"Super 8"
J .J. Abrams' sci-fi flick about a Midwestern town terrorized
by a mysterious creature combined the nostalgic charm of
past kid-ensemble films like "The Goonies" and "Stand By
Me" with summer-blockbuster thrills.
"The Help"
August's surprise heavyweight (and Emma Stone's second
entrance on this list) followed the lives of black maids and the
white women they worked for in 1960s Mississippi without
ever veering into schlocky sentimentality.
"X-Men: First Class"
The "X-Men" prequel successfully revitalized the mutant fran
chise largely thanks to fabulous chemistry between the
young Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael
Fassbender).
