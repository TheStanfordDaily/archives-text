### â€“ halle EDWARDS contact halle: halle@stanford. edu 
The Party on the Edge, SiCa's annual bash
to show off the art scene at Stanford, will
happen this year on Oct. 6 at Cantor Arts
Center. The party starts at 9 p.m. and will last until
midnight.
The arts-filled event will feature performances
from campus-favorite a capella groups like
Talisman and Everyday People, as well as appear
ances by the Cardinal Ballet Company, Kuumba
African Dance and Drum Ensemble and Alliance
Streetdance.
In addition to the live performances, student
made films will be shown, as well as artwork from
Stanford's Arts Grant program, which provides
funding to Stanford students to help them create
innovative work. In addition, The Wall exhibition
can be seen in the Cool Cafe as part of Stanford's
Your Art Here program, which shows student-run
gallery spaces around the Stanford campus.
Students can explore the inside of the muse
um and see the twenty-four art galleries Cantor
has available and also wander outside to find more
art and performances. There will be plenty of free
food.

In addition to the various performances and
exhibitions, this year's Party on the Edge marks the
kickoff of the ASSU's Art 2.0 Initiative. The initia

tive aims to bring together arts groups across cam
pus into a more cohesive art scene.
"This sort of collaboration is exactly what
Stanford needs," said Paul Ferrell, ASSU Director
of Arts. "There are so many arts groups on campus
but there isn't a cohesive arts scene. We plan to
bring these groups together for everything from
performances to social events and meetings with
arts faculty."
The initiative will kick off at 11 p.m. in the
Cafe at Cantor, bringing together presidents of
student art organizations to meet with professors,
administrations, SiCa leaders and leaders of the
Stanford Art Initiative. The kick-off is a design
thinking session to help re-imagine the arts scene
at Stanford.
Throughout the evening, post-it notes will be
available for students to sketch their ideas and post
them on the walls at Cantor. These ideas will be
incorporated into the design-thinking section.
To attend the party, students can head to
Cantor via bike or on foot or take the midnight-
Marguerite shutde, which stops at Cantor every
half-hour.
