## How to turn your blog into a book deal 
### â€“ Jennifer SCHAFFER contact jennifer: jmschaff@stanford. edu 
The Internet is weird. Blogging
is at once an act of exhibition
ism and anonymity
Blogger by Google, for example, is
equal parts personal diary and public
platform. When you write for the
Internet, you contribute to an infinite
ly expanding database of voices in
pixels. Your audience is both limitless
and unseen; blog posts often read as
either newsletters to an over-estimated
fanbase or self-conscious, schizo
phrenic indulgences. But for all this,
there is something singular and per
sonal and genuine about writing on a
blog, saving drafts onto Blogger with a
wary hope akin to a diarist that some
day the scraps will add up.
This is the feeling captured in
Megan Boyle's debut book, "selected
unpublished blogposts of a mexican
panda express employee," a collection
of blog drafts written by Boyle over
the course of two years and published
this September by Muumuu House, a
publishing house created and run by
writer Tao Lin ("Richard Yates,"
"Shoplifting from American
Apparel").
Muumuu House has published
two books of poetry; Lin also curates
writing found on the Internet and,
with permission, publishes everything
from tweets to Gmail chats. With
Boyle's first book, Muumuu House
has gone a step further: publishing a

print, perfect-bound book of the 100-
some blog posts that once sat in
Boyle's "Blogger drafts."
Skeptical? It's understandable. In
an age where everyone and their ham
ster has a blog, there is resistance to
accept Internet writing into the world
of "literature." And, to be fair, the vast
majority of writing on the Internet

probably shouldn't be considered "lit
erature." But with Boyle's poetry col
lection, Muumuu House has found
the kind of raw, honest writing that
can, perhaps, only take place within a
Blogger window.

"There was a period where any
time I wrote text in the Blogger.com
window I wouldn't feel self-conscious
about what I was writing," Boyle said.
"One time I started writing a paper in
a Blogger.com window because I was
having a hard time with it."
The syntax and formatting of
"selected..." is, fittingly, casual. The
ends of lines go unpunctuated, noth
ing is capitalized, text is sans serif. The
result is a book that feels unprece
dented in its sincerity.
Throughout "selected..." Boyle
describes her surroundings and her
emotions with plain, unadorned lan
guage, and her imagery is all the more
powerful for it. In the first entry of
her book, Boyle lists a few of her
"favorite things to feel," a series of sen

sations that are almost harder to state sim
ply, as Boyle does, than they are to drama
tize ("the way time doesn't exist when

you're waking next to someone and you
just roll around quietly in bed together
and sometimes open your eyes," "the night
before leaving for a trip on an airplane").
So many experiences have been embel
lished, over and over, in attempts at turn
ing the ordinary into poetry; Boyle tears
these moments away from the cliche and
returns them to their simplest state.

"selected..is self-conscious and
self-aware in a particularly twenty-first
century way; today, we not only cultivate
our internal thoughts and our external

world, but our online persona, our blog
ging voice, our Internet life, ever more
public yet increasingly obscure.
"i would like to matter to every per

son in the world," writes Boyle, "i would
like every person in the world to matter to
me/neither of those things will ever hap
pen.
In addition to the blog draff poems,
the collection is sprinkled with essays pre
viously published on the Internet, includ
ing "Lies I Have Told" and "Everyone I've
Had Sex With." Arguably Boyle's most
famous essay, originally published on
Thought Catalog and the Muumuu House
website, "Everyone I've Had Sex With" is
exemplary of Boyle's unassuming honesty,
the voice of a brave introvert on the

Internet ("i am an introverted person but i
like approval," she writes in "selected ..
a 20-something trying to figure things out
through writing.

You can see the wheels turning,
so to speak. And reversing. And
stalling. And drinking iced coffee. In
"selected..." she writes, "am i con
sciously trying to think interesting
thoughts because i think i'm going
to write this down later? am i actu
ally interesting or do i just want to
construct a view myself as 'interest
ing' so i can feel like i shouldn't
die?"
Boyle named a few of her
favorite books as influences: "Where

You'll Find Me" by Ann Beattie,
"Bed" by husband Tao Lin and
"Like Life" by Lorrie Moore. As for
inspiration, Boyle said, "If anything
inspired me it's the same thing that
inspires me to do anything (want
ing the world to know I was here,
wanting to connect with people
honestly, and make life more inter
esting by writing things down)."

"selected..." deals with some
heavy topics death and depres
sion and relevance and need of love

but in the most straightforward,
unassuming way. Boyle doesn't take
herself or her concerns too serious
ly. Her writing shows the internal
calm of intelligence.
The result is a reassuringly can
did look at one individual's con
sciousness, in all its quiet insecurity
and raw hopefulness; "selected..."
is a series of drafts, dispatches not
from the 'ffontlines of a generation'
but, instead, from one 20-some
thing's world and that in-tune

and individual voice, which disowns
grandiosity in favor of honesty, is
the only kind any generation has
use for.
"selected unpublished blog
posts of a mexican panda express
employee" is a remarkable debut.
Megan Boyle has given us a book
that reads as a series of finely tuned
drafts that

feel both painstaking and unpol
ished, earnest and unassuming,
plain, poetic, moving, self-conscious
and, above all, real.
