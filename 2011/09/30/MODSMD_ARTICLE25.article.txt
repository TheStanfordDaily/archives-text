## How to turn your blog into a book deal

The Internet is weird. Blogging
is at once an act of exhibition
ism and anonymity
Blogger by Google, for example, is
equal parts personal diary and public
platform. When you write for the
Internet, you contribute to an infinite
ly expanding database of voices in
pixels. Your audience is both limitless
and unseen; blog posts often read as
either newsletters to an over-estimated
fanbase or self-conscious, schizo
phrenic indulgences. But for all this,
there is something singular and per
sonal and genuine about writing on a
blog, saving drafts onto Blogger with a
wary hope akin to a diarist that some
day the scraps will add up.
This is the feeling captured in
Megan Boyle's debut book, "selected
unpublished blogposts of a mexican
panda express employee," a collection
of blog drafts written by Boyle over
the course of two years and published
this September by Muumuu House, a
publishing house created and run by
writer Tao Lin ("Richard Yates,"
"Shoplifting from American
Apparel").
Muumuu House has published
two books of poetry; Lin also curates
writing found on the Internet and,
with permission, publishes everything
from tweets to Gmail chats. With
Boyle's first book, Muumuu House
has gone a step further: publishing a

print, perfect-bound book of the 100-
some blog posts that once sat in
Boyle's "Blogger drafts."
Skeptical? It's understandable. In
an age where everyone and their ham
ster has a blog, there is resistance to
accept Internet writing into the world
of "literature." And, to be fair, the vast
majority of writing on the Internet

probably shouldn't be considered "lit
erature." But with Boyle's poetry col
lection, Muumuu House has found
the kind of raw, honest writing that
can, perhaps, only take place within a
Blogger window.

"There was a period where any
time I wrote text in the Blogger.com
window I wouldn't feel self-conscious
about what I was writing," Boyle said.
"One time I started writing a paper in
a Blogger.com window because I was
having a hard time with it."
The syntax and formatting of
"selected..." is, fittingly, casual. The
ends of lines go unpunctuated, noth
ing is capitalized, text is sans serif. The
result is a book that feels unprece
dented in its sincerity.
Throughout "selected..." Boyle
describes her surroundings and her
emotions with plain, unadorned lan
guage, and her imagery is all the more
powerful for it. In the first entry of
her book, Boyle lists a few of her
"favorite things to feel," a series of sen
