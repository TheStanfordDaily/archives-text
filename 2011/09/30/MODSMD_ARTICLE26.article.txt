# Philz Coffee: My Secret (Hipster) Boyfriend

I have a secret boyfriend, and his name is Phil. My
friends are convinced. For the past two years, I
have almost constantly been "at Phil's," "in transit
to Phil's" or (at my worst) "desperately craving Phil's."
In a philosophy class at Stanford (yup shame
less plug!), you will learn about the hallowed theoreti
cal principal "Occam's razor." It posits that this kind
of weird, obsessive behavior probably has the simplest
possible explanation: in this case, my secret affair with
a dude named Phil.

Here, Occam's razor is wrong. Phil is only my
boyfriend in the same sense that shameless self-pro
motion is Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino's
boyfriend.

In fact, my constant jabber about "Phil" is actu
ally in reference to Philz Coffee, a Bay Area coffee
chain so good that it engenders frightening addic
tions and a cultish following.
The story of Philz Coffee begins in 2003, when
San Francisco-native Phil Jaber started his first coffee
shop in a space he had previously operated as a gro
cery store in San Francisco's cooler-than-thou
Mission District. From the get-go, Philz was unique
in its insistence on brewing cups of coffee one at a
time a method that ensures freshness and higher
quality. Working with his son, Jacob, Phil developed a
distinctive brewing method and a slew of diverse
bean blends.

The shop quickly became a neighborhood coffee
hotspot, an impressive achievement among Mission
District's unwashed, coffee-obsessed hordes. Phil and
Jacob presumably solidified their hipster credentials
when they changed the name of their shop from the
bourgeois "Phil's" to the endearingly random mis
spelling, "Philz."
Since 2003, Philz has expanded across the Bay
Area into a mini-empire of really, really excellent cof
fee. Today, there are seven Philz locations includ
ing one about 10 minutes away from campus in Palo
Alto's especially suburban midtown district.
The Palo Alto Philz feels incongruously cool
compared to the surrounding pastel ranch houses.

Inside, you'll find a mix of Stanford kids, soccer
moms and techie types. But most of the Philz clien
tele are people who look like they emerged from the
womb already wearing fedoras and non-prescription
tortoise-shell glasses. It's common to hear Vampire
Weekend tracks blaring on the speakers. I try to avoid
showing up wearing pastels out of fear of judgment.
This can be off-putting at first, but you soon learn to
think of Philz's hipster-ness as an exciting anthropo
logical safari into a subculture that is pretty exotic for
a city whose downtown consists of luxury rug shops
and frozen yogurt stores. Plus, hipsters are a quiet
breed; add the free WiFi to the mix, and Philz is a
great place to study.
Ultimately though, the quality of the coffee is
what makes Philz so addictive. Fellow Philz junkie
Sekhar Paladugu 'l2 calls it "glorious, delicious,
smooth, balanced and just tasty."
In fact, it's hard to get Paladugu off the subject of
how good Philz coffee tastes.
"It makes my day every time I go. It's like dessert,
except it's coffee," he gushed before pausing. "I just
wish I could afford to drink it every day."


At an average of four dollars for
a custom-made cup from the store,
an earth-shatteringly good cup of
Philz coffee can break the bank once
you get into the habit of going as
often as I do. Fortunately, I recently
discovered that the ground beans,
averaging $l4 a pound, aren't sub
stantially more expensive than a pre
mium Starbucks blend. Keeping a
bag of Philz beans in your room
makes the whole place smell awe
some. It also gives your room instant,
underground foodie cred to impress
that skinny hipster kid from IHUM
section that you're still trying to woo.
I recently had the exciting
chance to speak with Phil Jaber of
Philz himself. He's mostly busy right
now gearing up for the opening of
the newest Philz outpost, slated to

open its doors on Oct. 3 a roomy
store off University Avenue targeted
especially at Stanford students.
During our conversation, he kept
laughing when I asked what puts his
coffee miles above most other
blends.
"I was just born to make coffee,"
Jaber explained. "Philz is special. We
do things with love and faith and
truth."
Sounds more like a cheesy love
poem than the pitch for a successful
coffee brand, doesn't it? Maybe Phil
is my secret boyfriend after all.
