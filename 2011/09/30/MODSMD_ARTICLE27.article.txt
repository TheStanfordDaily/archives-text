It's been a long time coming,
but after eight troubled years
away from the music scene,
the boys of Blink-182 are
quite literally back in town
with their new album,

"Neighborhoods." Perhaps it's
true what they say, that absence
makes the heart grow fonder, but
I've personally always loved

Blink-182.1 think I speak for my
generation when I say that
like them or not Blink served
as the soundtrack for much of
our middle- and high-school

lives. Listening to their old songs
may bring back great memories,
but you can put away those CDs
you burned because Blink-182 is
back with a vengeance, and fans
of any age won't be disappointed.

Their latest release marks a
significant departure from the
adolescent angst and deeply
meaningless sentiment that sat
urated Blink's previous albums.
In "Neighborhoods," Blink-182
waxes lyrical about the tran-

sience of life and the intricacies
of human nature, proving that
they haven't just grown older
but also wiser. Their sound has
also matured, with elements of

the band's respective side-proj
ects Angels and Airwaves,
Box Car Racer and +44 all
apparent in their new melodies.
Though Biblical and literary
allusions may abound in the
new album's lyrics, they are all
backed by that seamless melding
of drum and guitar that only
Blink can do so well.

The emotion and melodic
depth is palpable from the
opening track of
"Neighborhoods," "Ghost on the
Dancefloor." Though the song
opens with a driving drum solo
from Travis Barker reminiscent
of the intro of the band's former
smash hit, "Feeling This," the

lyrics demonstrate that Blink is

now all "grown up."
In the opening verse, Blink
frontman Tom Delonge sings,
"It's like the universe has left
me/Without a place to go/Without
a hint of light/To watch the move

ment glow/When our song is slow
ly starting/The memory felt so
real/At first against my will/But
God invented chills."

Though the lyrics may be
haunting, the song is as catchy
as any track off of Blink-182's
self-titled album of eight years
ago. It serves as an apt opening
track for their comeback album
as well as a chilling reminder of
Barker's brush with death in a
2008 plane crash.

The album maintains a

similarly momentous tone
throughout, but the tracks are
anything but somber. In fact,
"Neighborhoods" is a very fit
ting title for this release, as the
14 tracks draw on various gen
res of music and different areas
of Blink's own material for
inspiration. "Natives," which
bassist Mark Hoppus has stated
is his favorite track on the
album, is a nod to the band's

former pop-punk glory, with an
infectious drum-and-bass line
and suitably dark lyrics. The
album's first single, "Up All

Night," on the other hand,
boasts grandiose guitar chords
in the style of Delonge's band
Angels and Airwaves. Later in
the album, "Snake Charmer"
showcases the band's rock influ
ences and sounds like it could
have easily come off an album
by The Cure. Finally, "Even if
She Falls" brings the album to a
beautiful close, flawlessly tying
together Blink-182's traditional
sound (think "Always" with a
mellower melody) with their
newfound sophistication.
All in all, "Neighborhoods"
is a true case of "once more,

with feeling"; you'll still be bob
bing your head, tapping your
toes and wreaking havoc on
your air guitar to the beat of the
new tracks, but this time, you
may also find your heart melt
ing, if only a little.
