What would you do if, in your prime years of young adult
hood, you developed a rare and deadly form of cancer and
lived to tell the tale? In Will Reiser's case, write a semi-autobi
ographical screenplay and get the guys responsible for "Superbad"

behind it. Directed by Jonathan
Levine, "50/50" is a touching
dramedy starring Joseph
Gordon-Levitt as Adam, a 20-

something public radio
writer determined to
beat the odds of his dis
ease.
An avid runner, Adam
initially goes to the doc
tor for debilitating back
pain but finds his life
turned upside down
when test results reveal a
cancerous tumor grow
ing along his spine.

Referred to inexperienced psychiatrist-in-training Katie (Anna
Kendrick) to help cope with the emotional aspect of the diagnosis while
undergoing aggressive chemotherapy treatment, Adam embarks on the
uncertain road to recovery. While he first greets his predicament with a
numbness that Katie reassures him is normal, the inevitable changes in
his health and their impact on his personal life force him to examine his
choices and relationships in new ways.

The first casually is Adam's pretentious artist girlfriend Rachael
(Bryce Dallas Howard), whose wavering support leads him to rely, more
than ever, on the other influential figures in his life. This primarily
includes his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), whose questionable plans for
using Adam's disease as away to pick up girls provide some much-need
ed comic relief. But also, with Katie's encouragement, Adam finally
reconnects with his overprotective mother Diane (Anjelica Huston)
despite not wishing to tell her about his cancer in the first place.
There is no doubt that "50/50" is supremely cast with solid perform
ances, although one could argue that it is simply a function of the actors
portraying familiar roles. Rogen, for example, reprises his crass sidekick

persona, just as Kendrick's
performance echoes the well
intentioned Type A that gar
nered her Academy Award
nomination for "Up in the
Air." Huston and Howard are

strong in their supporting
roles, with the latter (who
most recently appeared in
"The Help") continuing her
streak of bringing humor
and humanity to unlikable
characters.

Gordon-Levitt gives a moving performance as a young man trying
to come to terms with the fact that, no matter what he or anyone else
does, he might not survive but at times feels overshadowed by the other
characters. This is less an issue with the acting than the writing and, in
the end, Adam's subtleties better enable the audience to identify with
him, which in turn makes the film all the more poignant.
As per the common tragedy that often befalls comedies these days,
overzealous marketing has ruined the potential hilarity of certain scenes
in the film, but luckily Reiser's witty script still has plenty of tricks up its
sleeve. "50/50" is very much the "cancer comedy" that its PR team would

have you believe but, just
a heads up: bring some
tissues, because there will
probably also be some
tears, and I don't mean
the kind that result from
laughter. Reiser and
Levine's treatment of
what is now one of the
leading causes of death
worldwide successfully
balances sincerity, humor
and deprecation, resulting
in a truly heartfelt and
inspirational story.
