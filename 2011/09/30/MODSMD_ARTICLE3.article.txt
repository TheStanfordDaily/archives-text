## Exson fights sex assaults Univ. expands anti-sexual violence campaign 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has devoted increasing at
tention to its campaign addressing sexu
al violence on campus since the forma
tion of the Office of Sexual Assault and
Relationship Abuse (SARA) Educa
tion & Response last June,
In June, the University appointed
Angela Exson as the new Assistant
Dean of SARA.

"Hiring Angela Exson institutional
izes Stanford's commitment to ending
violence against women," said Nicole
Baran 'OO, founder and director of the
Center for Relationship Abuse Aware
ness, which seeks to change campus cul
ture by addressing the underlying caus
es of sexual assault and relationship
abuse.

"SARA will coordinate the re
sponse to incidents of sexual violence
and relationship abuse while conduct
ing outreach to raise awareness about
the dynamics of the issues and the
detrimental impact that they incur,"
Exson wrote in an email to The
Daily.

"The first year is about establish
ing protocol there is policy for
dealing with sexual assault policy
but no protocol, and with relation
ship abuse, we have protocols but we
don't have policy in place," Exson
said in a follow-up interview.

"There will be an evaluation
process to see what's working and
how we engage with the campus and
the community at large" once new
protocols and policies have been re
viewed, established and publicized,
Exson added.

SARA plans to work with the
YWCA, an organization which, ac
cording to its website, is dedicated to
empowering women and eliminat
ing racism, in addition to Residential
Education (ResEd) and Cousensel
ing and Psychological Services
(CAPS) and campus police. The
group will also work collaboratively
with the Center for Relationship
Abuse Awareness.

Since 2006, the center has man
aged the Stanford University Part
nership to End Violence Against
Women.The center promotes aware
ness through training sessions for
student staff, fraternities and sorori
ties, an eight-hour education pro
gram for students and through a fem
inist studies course titled "Violence
Against Women: Theory, Issues and
Prevention," now in its fifth year.
The U.S. Department of Justice's
Office on Violence Against Women
has funded the Center through two
separate grants over the last five
years and is currently considering
Stanford's application for another
three-year grant.The Department of
Justice will announce the results in
October.
An Underreported Crime
The number of reported "forcible
sexual offenses" doubled to 21 in
2010 from 10 the previous year, ac
cording to the Department of Public
Safety's 2011 Annual Security and
Fire Safety report released to the
Stanford community Sept. 27. The
report also saw the number of re
ported forcible rapes triple to 13 in
2010, from four reports the previous
year.
"An increase in reports doesn't
necessarily indicate an increase in
incidences," Exson said when asked
to comment on the increase, adding
that the rate of reports is related to
the nature of administrative and stu
dent responses toward sexual vio
lence on campus.
Sexual assault and relationship
abuse are two of the most underre
ported violent crimes nationwide.
According to a 2008 California
Coalition Against Sexual Assault
(CALCASA) Report, one in four
college women were victims of rape
or attempted rape while in school.
Between 2000 and 2009, there were
169 reported cases of sexual vio
lence at Stanford, the report said.
"Because only 10 percent of sex
ual assault cases are reported, often
due to fear of judgment, victim
blaming or retaliation, many more
students are being assaulted without
access to support and resources,"
Baran said.

"There is an increase in reports if
people are aware of the options that
exist and feel empowered enough
to make that choice," Exson said.
"Whether people report, go to Judi
cial Affairs, or not, SARA wants to
get services and resources out so
students can feel supported emo
tionally."

"Sometimes students don't re
port for very personal reasons,"
Exson added. "Students can consult
me on the options, rights and re
sources that are available to assist
them. The goal is to respect and
honor the survivor's agenda to the
fullest extent possible, while main
taining the safety of the community
in away that upholds the standards
of the University and any applicable
legislative mandates."
Exson stated that one of the
most effective ways to reduce sexu
al violence and increase relation
ship abuse awareness is "to chal
lenge and critique the negative soci
etal messages [we] receive about re
lationships, sex and the importance
of consent."
Students have responded to the
issue of sexual violence on campus
through a number of initiatives. Sev
enty students have interned with the
Partnership to End Violence Against
Women since its founding. In addi
tion, last spring, students initiated the
first Survivors Group for victims of
sexual violence on campus.
"The group was very well-attend
ed," wrote Viviana Arcia 'l3, one of
the student initiators of the group
and president of the Women's Coali
tion, in an email to The Daily. "Be
cause of the positive response we re
ceived from students and many ad
ministrators, we were able to lobby
CAPS to officially support the group
this coming school year, particularly
in terms of providing a trained coun
selor."
Arcia said the Survivors Group
will work closely with Dean Exson
to ensure that the University pro
vides the necessary resources for vic
tims of sexual violence.
"Sexual and domestic violence
are community issues," Arcia said.
"Sexual assault would decrease if
the student community as a whole
were able to understand that no one
can avoid sexual assault, that only
the perpetrator is responsible for
sexual assault or relationship abuse
and that victim-blaming will not
deter these crimes from being com
mitted."
The Survivors Group held its first
weekly meeting Sept. 27.

Center for Relationship Abuse Aware
ness, which seeks to change campus cul
ture by addressing the underlying caus
es of sexual assault and relationship
abuse.

"SARA will coordinate the re
sponse to incidents of sexual violence
and relationship abuse while conduct
ing outreach to raise awareness about
the dynamics of the issues and the
detrimental impact that they incur,"
Exson wrote in an email to The
Daily.

"The first year is about establish
ing protocol there is policy for
dealing with sexual assault policy
but no protocol, and with relation
ship abuse, we have protocols but we
don't have policy in place," Exson
said in a follow-up interview.

"There will be an evaluation
process to see what's working and
how we engage with the campus and
the community at large" once new
protocols and policies have been re
viewed, established and publicized,
Exson added.

SARA plans to work with the
YWCA, an organization which, ac
cording to its website, is dedicated to
empowering women and eliminat
ing racism, in addition to Residential
Education (ResEd) and Cousensel
ing and Psychological Services
(CAPS) and campus police. The
group will also work collaboratively
with the Center for Relationship
Abuse Awareness.

Since 2006, the center has man
aged the Stanford University Part
nership to End Violence Against
Women.The center promotes aware
ness through training sessions for
student staff, fraternities and sorori
ties, an eight-hour education pro
gram for students and through a fem
inist studies course titled "Violence
Against Women: Theory, Issues and
Prevention," now in its fifth year.
The U.S. Department of Justice's
Office on Violence Against Women
has funded the Center through two
separate grants over the last five
years and is currently considering
Stanford's application for another
three-year grant.The Department of
Justice will announce the results in
October.
An Underreported Crime
The number of reported "forcible
sexual offenses" doubled to 21 in
2010 from 10 the previous year, ac
cording to the Department of Public
Safety's 2011 Annual Security and
Fire Safety report released to the
Stanford community Sept. 27. The
report also saw the number of re
ported forcible rapes triple to 13 in
2010, from four reports the previous
year.
"An increase in reports doesn't
necessarily indicate an increase in
incidences," Exson said when asked
to comment on the increase, adding
that the rate of reports is related to
the nature of administrative and stu
dent responses toward sexual vio
lence on campus.
Sexual assault and relationship
abuse are two of the most underre
ported violent crimes nationwide.
According to a 2008 California
Coalition Against Sexual Assault
(CALCASA) Report, one in four
college women were victims of rape
or attempted rape while in school.
Between 2000 and 2009, there were
169 reported cases of sexual vio
lence at Stanford, the report said.
"Because only 10 percent of sex
ual assault cases are reported, often
due to fear of judgment, victim
blaming or retaliation, many more
students are being assaulted without
access to support and resources,"
Baran said.

"There is an increase in reports if
people are aware of the options that
exist and feel empowered enough
to make that choice," Exson said.
"Whether people report, go to Judi
cial Affairs, or not, SARA wants to
get services and resources out so
students can feel supported emo
tionally."

"Sometimes students don't re
port for very personal reasons,"
Exson added. "Students can consult
me on the options, rights and re
sources that are available to assist
them. The goal is to respect and
honor the survivor's agenda to the
fullest extent possible, while main
taining the safety of the community
in away that upholds the standards
of the University and any applicable
legislative mandates."
Exson stated that one of the
most effective ways to reduce sexu
al violence and increase relation
ship abuse awareness is "to chal
lenge and critique the negative soci
etal messages [we] receive about re
lationships, sex and the importance
of consent."
Students have responded to the
issue of sexual violence on campus
through a number of initiatives. Sev
enty students have interned with the
Partnership to End Violence Against
Women since its founding. In addi
tion, last spring, students initiated the
first Survivors Group for victims of
sexual violence on campus.
"The group was very well-attend
ed," wrote Viviana Arcia 'l3, one of
the student initiators of the group
and president of the Women's Coali
tion, in an email to The Daily. "Be
cause of the positive response we re
ceived from students and many ad
ministrators, we were able to lobby
CAPS to officially support the group
this coming school year, particularly
in terms of providing a trained coun
selor."
Arcia said the Survivors Group
will work closely with Dean Exson
to ensure that the University pro
vides the necessary resources for vic
tims of sexual violence.
"Sexual and domestic violence
are community issues," Arcia said.
"Sexual assault would decrease if
the student community as a whole
were able to understand that no one
can avoid sexual assault, that only
the perpetrator is responsible for
sexual assault or relationship abuse
and that victim-blaming will not
deter these crimes from being com
mitted."
The Survivors Group held its first
weekly meeting Sept. 27.
