# HAPPY BIRTHDAY, N64
## AN HONEST LOOK BACK AT NINTENDO'S FIRST 3D CONSOLE NINTENDO 64

I'm not normally
the type to make
a big fuss over
anniversaries, espe- *
dally when it

comes to something so young and rapidly chang
ing as gaming. But this time, at least, memory
lane is just a little too tempting. If you're about
the right age and if the words "blue shell,"
"barrel roll" and "hookshot" send some tingles
down your spine I think you'll agree.
That's right, folks: it's the Nintendo 64's

birthday. It's all too easy for me to shower praise
on the first console I bought on launch date, but
the real story of the N64 isn't exactly a Rainbow
Road. With a bit of restraint, then, I hope I can
give you a balanced glimpse onto the lasting
legacy of Nintendo's first 3D console.

When the Nintendo 64 first came to the
North American market fifteen years ago, the
industry was on the edge of a seismic shift: with
their 32-bit systems, Sony and Sega had shown
—just barely —that home consoles could
emulate the arcade experience and bring polyg
onal graphics to our living rooms. But after
decades of D-pads and 2D sprites, early

Play Station and Saturn developers struggled to
make enjoyable 3D experiences. Nintendo, it
seemed, was primed to do it right.
By Nintendo's standards, the message was
bold: "Get N, or get out," the old commercials
went. With its name, the Nintendo 64 made a
cold and confident debut as the first 64-bit game
machine and even before that, Nintendo had
codenamed the console "Project Reality." Its
design was sleek, black and intimidating, like it
was supposed to be the bully on the block.

The Big N had reason to be confident.
With a powerful two-part processor, the
Nintendo 64 could render 3D games that
made Sony's early Play Station efforts look like
spoiled soup (something all these older 3D
games are starting to resemble nowadays). It
included four controller ports right out of the
box and could handle split-screen multiplayer
with ease. Most important of all, it offered a
controller that actually complemented the 3D
games its hardware was suited for. While a bit
more modest, the rear-facing Z button intro-

duced gamers to the now-übiquitous "trigger"
if you're playing a shooter, you may as feel
like you're shooting.

But it was also a time of great
uncertainty, and Nintendo was hedging
its bets. Add in a lack of foresight, and
you'll start to understand why the N64

barely managed to sell a

third of what
Sony did with
the Play Station.
It was still
unclear if 3D
would take over
or if 2D games

would have a sig-

nificant place on the N64 turns

out they didn't so Nintendo created an
unsightly third prong on its controller for a tra
ditional D-pad and shoulder button. It turned
out to be a fairly awkward waste of space, as
only a handful of games made meaningful use
of it. Even its impressive joystick had the wind
taken out of its sails, as Sony one-upped
Nintendo with the elegant Dual Shock con-

trailer just a year later.
The Nintendo 64 was also held back by its
hardware, which in hindsight was caught
between the worst parts of two overlapping
eras. While Sony went with Compact Discs
they developed them, after all Nintendo
stuck with bulky cartridges out of a fear of
piracy and stubbornness to change. It was nice
to not worry about scratching up a disc, but
Nintendo 64 cartridges were more expensive to
manufacture and could only hold, well, 64 MB
of data. Nintendo lost dozens of third-party

deals over the cartridge decision, most famous
ly its treasured partnership with Final Fantasy
developer Squaresoft.

In short, develop
ing on the N64 was

a headache for

anyone but
i Nintendo and

its sub-

sidiaries.

But ulti-

mately, that

I might be the system's saving grace. The
" Nintendo 64's technical shortcomings and his
torical oddities are undeniable, but so is the
enduring charm of the system's first-party
library. Even considering only Nintendo and

Rare, the system was a worthy purchase: games
like Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64,
Goldeneye, Banjo-Kazooie and Mario Kart 64
bent the arc of gaming history and will live on
in basements and dorm rooms for decades.

Maybe I was just the right age at the right time,
but it's hard not to think those games overcame
the limitations of their time and pushed their

way close to legend. The titles I just named, in
fact, are so well remembered that they've all
been remade or reimagined in recent years. No
other console's first-party library still receives so
much attention.

Fifteen years on, the Nintendo 64 stands as
a timely reminder of Nintendo's greatest
strengths and weaknesses. The Big N can be

bafflingly unresponsive to changes in techno
logical trends and consumer preferences, but it
isn't afraid to blaze new paths all on its own.

With the company struggling to sell hardware
and investors calling for Nintendo to go the

way of Sega and sell off its software to other
companies, it's hard to be certain of what lies
ahead. But as we can fittingly recall on this
anniversary, one thing is clear with rose-tinted
glasses or not: Nintendo is an immensely proud
company and will relentlessly pursue its own
vision for the future, come hell or high water.
I, for one, am glad they did so 15 years
ago. Happy birthday, Nintendo 64.

trailer just a year later.
The Nintendo 64 was also held back by its
hardware, which in hindsight was caught
between the worst parts of two overlapping
eras. While Sony went with Compact Discs
they developed them, after all Nintendo
stuck with bulky cartridges out of a fear of
piracy and stubbornness to change. It was nice
to not worry about scratching up a disc, but
Nintendo 64 cartridges were more expensive to
manufacture and could only hold, well, 64 MB
of data. Nintendo lost dozens of third-party

deals over the cartridge decision, most famous
ly its treasured partnership with Final Fantasy
developer Squaresoft.

In short, develop
ing on the N64 was

a headache for

anyone but
i Nintendo and

its sub-

sidiaries.

But ulti-

mately, that

I might be the system's saving grace. The
" Nintendo 64's technical shortcomings and his
torical oddities are undeniable, but so is the
enduring charm of the system's first-party
library. Even considering only Nintendo and

Rare, the system was a worthy purchase: games
like Mario 64, Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64,
Goldeneye, Banjo-Kazooie and Mario Kart 64
bent the arc of gaming history and will live on
in basements and dorm rooms for decades.

Maybe I was just the right age at the right time,
but it's hard not to think those games overcame
the limitations of their time and pushed their

way close to legend. The titles I just named, in
fact, are so well remembered that they've all
been remade or reimagined in recent years. No
other console's first-party library still receives so
much attention.

Fifteen years on, the Nintendo 64 stands as
a timely reminder of Nintendo's greatest
strengths and weaknesses. The Big N can be

bafflingly unresponsive to changes in techno
logical trends and consumer preferences, but it
isn't afraid to blaze new paths all on its own.

With the company struggling to sell hardware
and investors calling for Nintendo to go the

way of Sega and sell off its software to other
companies, it's hard to be certain of what lies
ahead. But as we can fittingly recall on this
anniversary, one thing is clear with rose-tinted
glasses or not: Nintendo is an immensely proud
company and will relentlessly pursue its own
vision for the future, come hell or high water.
I, for one, am glad they did so 15 years
ago. Happy birthday, Nintendo 64.

I'm not normally
the type to make
a big fuss over
anniversaries, espe- *
dally when it

comes to something so young and rapidly chang
ing as gaming. But this time, at least, memory
lane is just a little too tempting. If you're about
the right age and if the words "blue shell,"
"barrel roll" and "hookshot" send some tingles
down your spine I think you'll agree.
That's right, folks: it's the Nintendo 64's

birthday. It's all too easy for me to shower praise
on the first console I bought on launch date, but
the real story of the N64 isn't exactly a Rainbow
Road. With a bit of restraint, then, I hope I can
give you a balanced glimpse onto the lasting
legacy of Nintendo's first 3D console.

When the Nintendo 64 first came to the
North American market fifteen years ago, the
industry was on the edge of a seismic shift: with
their 32-bit systems, Sony and Sega had shown
—just barely —that home consoles could
emulate the arcade experience and bring polyg
onal graphics to our living rooms. But after
decades of D-pads and 2D sprites, early

Play Station and Saturn developers struggled to
make enjoyable 3D experiences. Nintendo, it
seemed, was primed to do it right.
By Nintendo's standards, the message was
bold: "Get N, or get out," the old commercials
went. With its name, the Nintendo 64 made a
cold and confident debut as the first 64-bit game
machine and even before that, Nintendo had
codenamed the console "Project Reality." Its
design was sleek, black and intimidating, like it
was supposed to be the bully on the block.

The Big N had reason to be confident.
With a powerful two-part processor, the
Nintendo 64 could render 3D games that
made Sony's early Play Station efforts look like
spoiled soup (something all these older 3D
games are starting to resemble nowadays). It
included four controller ports right out of the
box and could handle split-screen multiplayer
with ease. Most important of all, it offered a
controller that actually complemented the 3D
games its hardware was suited for. While a bit
more modest, the rear-facing Z button intro-

duced gamers to the now-übiquitous "trigger"
if you're playing a shooter, you may as feel
like you're shooting.

But it was also a time of great
uncertainty, and Nintendo was hedging
its bets. Add in a lack of foresight, and
you'll start to understand why the N64

barely managed to sell a

third of what
Sony did with
the Play Station.
It was still
unclear if 3D
would take over
or if 2D games

would have a sig-

nificant place on the N64 turns

out they didn't so Nintendo created an
unsightly third prong on its controller for a tra
ditional D-pad and shoulder button. It turned
out to be a fairly awkward waste of space, as
only a handful of games made meaningful use
of it. Even its impressive joystick had the wind
taken out of its sails, as Sony one-upped
Nintendo with the elegant Dual Shock con-

trailer just a year later.
The Nintendo 64 was also held back by its
hardware, which in hindsight was caught
between the worst parts of two overlapping
eras. While Sony went with Compact Discs
they developed them, after all Nintendo

piracy and stubbornness to change. It was nice
