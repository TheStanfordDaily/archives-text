# STUFF WE LOVE: 'DOCTOR WHO'

f octor Who" is a British
■ science fiction show
about a 900-year-old
alien who travels through time and
space. It's also the longest-running
(science fiction) TV show in human
history, so there's got to be a bit more
to it than that.
The show was created in 1963, ran
until 1989 and was triumphantly
rebooted in 2005. It achieved its epic
longevity because of the nature of its
protagonist, an ancient alien who goes
only by the title "The Doctor." The
Doctor's race is capable of cheating
death via a process called "regenera
tion," in which they become, essentially,
a completely new person, with all the
same memories and attachments but a
new face, new personality, new quirks.
This allows the show to refresh itself
with an entirely new leading man
whenever the main actor begins to
grow stale or predictable, giving the
show a fantastically dynamic sort of
continuity seen nowhere else on TV
Viewers are determined that they'll
never get over their first Doctor, right
up until they meet the next one; every
one has a favorite Doctor (10 is a popu
lar choice and happens to be my per-

sonal Doctor, though I hear good
things about four).
The show focuses on this entirely
unique character, who is presented as
more wonderful and terrifying than
anything we could encounter on Earth.
He is characterized by his delight in
new things, his reverential opinion of
the human race and his compassion.
He is also one of the few heroes in pop
culture who defines himself as a cow
ard; the Doctor would rather flee dan
ger than face it, is dependent on those
weaker and more flawed than him to
keep him from losing control and is so
crippled by guilt, age and fear of his
own terrible power that he very nearly
self-destructs. To provide us with a

window into his soul, the writers

ensure that the Doctor always travels
with a companion, who is generally
wildly relatable and quite overwhelm
ingly normal.

Since the beginning, "Doctor
Who" has become an entire cultural
experience, one whose fans are nothing
short of fanatical. It's become some
thing of a religion for many viewers,
who harbor a secret nugget of hope

that their favorite Doctor, as a time
traveler, could technically still turn up
for us any day now. In the current
Doctor's personal timeline, 200 years
passed between last week's episode and
this week's —and as a friend of mine
pointed out, he had to have spent that

time with someone. Why not her?

But I don't watch "Doctor Who"
because it is a cultural experience. I

watch because "Doctor Who" is (like
most good shows) at its heart not just
a science fiction joyride or a brilliant
story, it's a show about people a
more ambitious and optimistic hymn
to humanity than any I have ever

encountered. The show dwells in dark
ness with a ruthless tendency of sys
tematically creating and brutally mur
dering/abandoning/otherwise destroy
ing compelling characters, but it also
clings to the light. The Doctor is a

man unwilling to compromise his
morality in any situation he would
not sacrifice one life to save millions
because he holds the importance of
the individual above all else. But the
show is not foolish or naive in its

moralism; lives are lost, plans fail and
tragedy often strikes despite the best of
intentions.

I think much of the show's charm
comes in its very human self-centered
ness: in a universe full of wonder, the
oldest and wisest creature of them all
just happens to be absolutely head-

over-heels infatuated with the human
race. Thousands of years in our future,
the show assures us that humans are
still almost unrivaled in our potential
for both good and evil, and the Doctor
loves us and needs us despite our fre-

quent ignorance and weakness. It's a
sort of reassuring pat on the back from
the most powerful man in the universe
and one that's a pleasure to watch,
despite its admitted self-indulgence.
At the end of the day, with all phi
losophy and literary analysis put aside,
"Doctor Who" is an absolute joy to

watch. It's tremendously witty, fre
quently hilarious, proficiently tragic
and populated by the most compelling
characters I've ever encountered. New

viewers ought to start with season one
of the reboot (the Ninth Doctor), disre
gard the first seasons cringe-worthy
special effects and the less-than-impres
sive pilot episode, and sail through to
the relentlessly brilliant later episodes. If
by season two you haven't fallen head
over heels for the program and all its
associated characters, I sincerely ques
tion your character.

not sacrifice one life to save millions
because he holds the importance of
the individual above all else. But the
show is not foolish or naive in its

moralism; lives are lost, plans fail and
tragedy often strikes despite the best of
intentions.

I think much of the show's charm
comes in its very human self-centered
ness: in a universe full of wonder, the
oldest and wisest creature of them all
just happens to be absolutely head-

over-heels infatuated with the human
race. Thousands of years in our future,
the show assures us that humans are
still almost unrivaled in our potential
for both good and evil, and the Doctor
loves us and needs us despite our fre-

quent ignorance and weakness. It's a
sort of reassuring pat on the back from
the most powerful man in the universe
and one that's a pleasure to watch,
despite its admitted self-indulgence.
At the end of the day, with all phi
losophy and literary analysis put aside,
"Doctor Who" is an absolute joy to

watch. It's tremendously witty, fre
quently hilarious, proficiently tragic
and populated by the most compelling
characters I've ever encountered. New

viewers ought to start with season one
of the reboot (the Ninth Doctor), disre
gard the first seasons cringe-worthy
special effects and the less-than-impres
sive pilot episode, and sail through to
the relentlessly brilliant later episodes. If
by season two you haven't fallen head
over heels for the program and all its
associated characters, I sincerely ques
tion your character.
