## ROXY SASS Roxy's guide to total frat moves 
### 
Now that the ffosh have bro
ken their dry spells post-
NSO, Roxy is ready to play.
After vehemently denying responsi
bility for the "Thank you for your
daughters" banner posted in White
Plaza last week, the gentlemen of
SAE probably thanked many girls for
... coming to their party Monday
night. Though the start of the quar
ter can be hectic, Roxy never misses a
chance to get busy. She skipped the a
capella concert to mentally and phys
ically prepare for SAE and had her
own O-show after the party. Not one
to get tired easily, here's Roxy's guide
to enjoying this weekend's festivities.

Sigma Chi: Let's Get Physical
Though many upperclassmen
loathe the sweaty, over-packed frater
nity parties, Roxy can never pass up
an opportunity to get her grind on in
neon-colored spandex and very little
else. Plus, Roxy's inner-exhibitionist
can't wait to get up on the Sigma Chi
mantle ... especially since she knows
she won't be the only one getting up
that night. If you don't have the
stamina to work out all night in such
a tight space, Roxy recommends a
little personal-training session back
in your own room (note: Sigma Chi
only has one single).

Sigma Nu: Disorientation
Roxy's spent so many nights in
Sigma Nu that it would take more
than a few Solo cups of jungle juice
to get her disoriented there. But for
those of you with less ... experience,
here's a tip: unless you meet some
one early enough in the evening,

odds are you won't be making your
way upstairs. But Roxy doesn't think
that's a problem as long as you can
find someone to get down with. If
you're looking for ffeshmeat, ahem,
freshmen, there's sure to be plenty of
Tranc-bros and Tranc-hos in the
backyard (Roxy sees you, Wilbur!).

Sig Ep: Oktoberfest
If you're looking for something
a little more international in terms of
your beer selection (Roxy loves the
Nasty Ice, but she needs variety in
her drinks as much as in her men)
you can head to Sig Ep's Oktoberfest.
Roxy's always had a thing for
sausages. At the end of the night,
Roxy wants you to remember that
the brothers of Sig Ep don't live in
the house where the party is held...
but that just means you'll have to get
creative with your cultural explo
ration.

A few final words of wisdom from
Roxy:
Consent is sexy, harassment is
not. Stay the night, but don't overstay
your welcome.
That NSO nametag you've been
wearing all week? Roxy sees it as a
bull's eye. Ready, aim, fire.
