If you are currently an under
grad, I want you to think of the
last time during your academic
career when a coach of any
Stanford sport was fired.
You can't.
We're blessed as Stanford fans to
avoid the national trend of coaching
attrition. It's all too easy to suggest
that our coaches get a free, lifetime
pass because of the relatively small
amount of outside pressure to per
form. Is the booster presence the
same here as the SEC? No. Do stu
dents lose sleep over basketball sea
sons that end without a trip to the Big
Dance? Maybe just this one.
So why, then, are there three
coaches with at least 25 years of head
coaching experience on the Farm and
a slew of others who have called Palo
Alto home for over a decade? Be
cause Stanford is really damn good at
sports.
