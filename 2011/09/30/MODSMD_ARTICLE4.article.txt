# Dawkins' seat may be hot
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the rock 
If you are currently an under
grad, I want you to think of the
last time during your academic
career when a coach of any
Stanford sport was fired.
You can't.
We're blessed as Stanford fans to
avoid the national trend of coaching
attrition. It's all too easy to suggest
that our coaches get a free, lifetime
pass because of the relatively small
amount of outside pressure to per
form. Is the booster presence the
same here as the SEC? No. Do stu
dents lose sleep over basketball sea
sons that end without a trip to the Big
Dance? Maybe just this one.
So why, then, are there three
coaches with at least 25 years of head
coaching experience on the Farm and
a slew of others who have called Palo
Alto home for over a decade? Be
cause Stanford is really damn good at
sports.

However, this idyllic coaching
world could see its skies darken if the
Stanford mens basketball team fails
to live up to expectations.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins was
once the big name expected to bring
order to a program ravaged by an
ugly coaching breakup with Trent
Johnson and the departure of current
NBAers Brook and Robin Lopez.
He was the Mike Krzyzewski disciple
tasked with returning Cardinal ball
to the glory days under Mike Mont
gomery.

The ride since has been anything
but glorious. After an appearance in
the CBI semifinals (yikes) following
a 20-win debut season, Dawkins'
crew has failed to break .500 the last
two years. The Card hasn't won more
than seven conference games since
his arrival and finished this past sea
son winning just a third of its final 15
games.

This isn't all to say he's a bad
coach. Stanford's 2010 recruiting
class was among the best in the na
tion, and this season that group of
now-sophomores is joined by elite
freshman point guard Chasson Ran
dle. Dawkins has done his job during
the offseason, building a talented
team, on paper, from scratch. His
name alone brought a glimmer of
hope back to Maples Pavilion, and
there has been noticeable improve
ment by a formerly atrocious defen
sive unit. In fact. Athletic Director
Bob Bowlsby was impressed enough
to provide Dawkins with a two-year
extension through 2015-16, although
the school has the option to termi
nate the contract before the exten
sion kicks in.

But basketball is a moneymaker
regardless of recent success, or lack
thereof, and it's not unprecedented
for a coach's job to be at risk shortly
after signing an extension. There are
several factors potentially working
against Dawkins in what could be a
make-or-break year.

The first is the restructured Pac-12
and accompanying television deal. It
was announced earlier this month
that Stanford would be televised na
tionally nine times on FSN, a signifi
cant increase in coverage for a team
normally confined to a regional audi
ence. Additionally, the bump in Pac
-12 exposure as a whole has already
created a recruiting boost for rival
schools. Arizona and UCTA have
top 100 recruits lined up from coast to
coast, and up-and-coming programs
like Oregon have surprisingly stolen
top talent from the Bay Area and
other basketball factories. The win
dow for Stanford to capture the con

ference in the down years of late has
closed, as the Pac-12 is close to rejoin
ing the basketball elite.
Another issue Dawkins is facing
is youth, a characteristic of this past
season's team that was exposed
early and often. Randle could start
from day one, and although he has
shined in the offseason especially
on the team's trip to Spain where he
averaged 11 points per game the
freshman has yet to engineer a col
lege offense against quality oppo
nents. And with the exceptions of
senior Josh Owens and Randle, the
team's primary offensive threats,
Anthony Brown and Dwight Pow
ell, are just entering their second
seasons. Those four bring the most
offensive potential to Maples since
the Lopez twins, but the future of
their collective body of work is part
ly clouded by inexperience playing
together.
The Pac-12's resurgence and a
youthful squad could hurt the team in
the win/loss column, but the biggest
threat to Dawkins' job may come as a
surprise.

The departure of Andrew Luck.
All sports, not just men's basket
ball, have become overshadowed by
the quick ascension of the football
team, the success of which has been
undoubtedly driven by the star quar
terback. The Department of Athlet
ics has allowed Dawkins to develop
his program as the rise in football
popularity has yielded unprecedent
ed revenue. But when Luck gradu
ates, the free ride could be over, and
the other traditional "big" sports will
be counted on to fuel the gravy train.
Women's basketball has lived up to its
end, but the men have to follow suit to
help maintain the current status of the
Stanford brand.

With all that said, it must be reiter
ated that Dawkins has assembled a
very talented cast. This team was able
to hang with professionals in Europe,
and with Randle likely the only new
comer to the rotation, they already
have a year together under their col
lective belt. Dawkins has the cliched
basketball IQ and personnel to win
games, and the measureable support
of Bowlsby to provide an extra dose
of confidence. But as has been the
case across the country, AD support
can disappear as quickly as it
emerged.
With a postseason berth, Dawkins
could become known as the coach of
the future. With another losing sea
son? The coach of the past.

Zach Zimmerman is still grumpy
that coach Dawkins never recruited
him for his insane point-guarding
skills. Send him the names of some
D-111 schools that may still be inter
ested at zachz@stanford.edu, or hit
him up on Twitter @Zach_Zimmer

team, on paper, from scratch. His
name alone brought a glimmer of
hope back to Maples Pavilion, and
there has been noticeable improve
ment by a formerly atrocious defen
sive unit. In fact. Athletic Director
Bob Bowlsby was impressed enough
to provide Dawkins with a two-year
extension through 2015-16, although
the school has the option to termi
nate the contract before the exten
sion kicks in.

But basketball is a moneymaker
regardless of recent success, or lack
thereof, and it's not unprecedented
for a coach's job to be at risk shortly
after signing an extension. There are
several factors potentially working
against Dawkins in what could be a
make-or-break year.

The first is the restructured Pac-12
and accompanying television deal. It
was announced earlier this month
that Stanford would be televised na
tionally nine times on FSN, a signifi
cant increase in coverage for a team
normally confined to a regional audi
ence. Additionally, the bump in Pac
-12 exposure as a whole has already
created a recruiting boost for rival
schools. Arizona and UCTA have
top 100 recruits lined up from coast to
coast, and up-and-coming programs
like Oregon have surprisingly stolen
top talent from the Bay Area and
other basketball factories. The win
dow for Stanford to capture the con

ference in the down years of late has
closed, as the Pac-12 is close to rejoin
ing the basketball elite.
Another issue Dawkins is facing
is youth, a characteristic of this past
season's team that was exposed
early and often. Randle could start
from day one, and although he has
shined in the offseason especially
on the team's trip to Spain where he
averaged 11 points per game the
freshman has yet to engineer a col
lege offense against quality oppo
nents. And with the exceptions of
senior Josh Owens and Randle, the
team's primary offensive threats,
Anthony Brown and Dwight Pow
ell, are just entering their second
seasons. Those four bring the most
offensive potential to Maples since
the Lopez twins, but the future of
their collective body of work is part
ly clouded by inexperience playing
together.
The Pac-12's resurgence and a
youthful squad could hurt the team in
the win/loss column, but the biggest
threat to Dawkins' job may come as a
surprise.

The departure of Andrew Luck.
All sports, not just men's basket
ball, have become overshadowed by
the quick ascension of the football
team, the success of which has been
undoubtedly driven by the star quar
terback. The Department of Athlet
ics has allowed Dawkins to develop
his program as the rise in football
popularity has yielded unprecedent
ed revenue. But when Luck gradu
ates, the free ride could be over, and
the other traditional "big" sports will
be counted on to fuel the gravy train.
Women's basketball has lived up to its
end, but the men have to follow suit to
help maintain the current status of the
Stanford brand.

With all that said, it must be reiter
ated that Dawkins has assembled a
very talented cast. This team was able
to hang with professionals in Europe,
and with Randle likely the only new
comer to the rotation, they already
have a year together under their col
lective belt. Dawkins has the cliched
basketball IQ and personnel to win
games, and the measureable support
of Bowlsby to provide an extra dose
of confidence. But as has been the
case across the country, AD support
can disappear as quickly as it
emerged.
With a postseason berth, Dawkins
could become known as the coach of
the future. With another losing sea
son? The coach of the past.

Zach Zimmerman is still grumpy
that coach Dawkins never recruited
him for his insane point-guarding
skills. Send him the names of some
D-111 schools that may still be inter
ested at zachz@stanford.edu, or hit
him up on Twitter @Zach_Zimmer
man.
If you are currently an under
grad, I want you to think of the
last time during your academic
career when a coach of any
Stanford sport was fired.
You can't.
We're blessed as Stanford fans to
avoid the national trend of coaching
attrition. It's all too easy to suggest
that our coaches get a free, lifetime
pass because of the relatively small
amount of outside pressure to per
form. Is the booster presence the
same here as the SEC? No. Do stu
dents lose sleep over basketball sea
sons that end without a trip to the Big
Dance? Maybe just this one.
So why, then, are there three
coaches with at least 25 years of head
coaching experience on the Farm and
a slew of others who have called Palo
Alto home for over a decade? Be
cause Stanford is really damn good at
sports.

However, this idyllic coaching
world could see its skies darken if the
Stanford mens basketball team fails
to live up to expectations.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins was
once the big name expected to bring
order to a program ravaged by an
ugly coaching breakup with Trent
Johnson and the departure of current
NBAers Brook and Robin Lopez.
He was the Mike Krzyzewski disciple
tasked with returning Cardinal ball
to the glory days under Mike Mont
gomery.

The ride since has been anything
but glorious. After an appearance in
the CBI semifinals (yikes) following
a 20-win debut season, Dawkins'
crew has failed to break .500 the last
two years. The Card hasn't won more
than seven conference games since
his arrival and finished this past sea
son winning just a third of its final 15
games.

This isn't all to say he's a bad
coach. Stanford's 2010 recruiting
class was among the best in the na
tion, and this season that group of
now-sophomores is joined by elite
freshman point guard Chasson Ran
dle. Dawkins has done his job during
the offseason, building a talented
team, on paper, from scratch. His
name alone brought a glimmer of
hope back to Maples Pavilion, and
there has been noticeable improve
ment by a formerly atrocious defen
sive unit. In fact. Athletic Director
