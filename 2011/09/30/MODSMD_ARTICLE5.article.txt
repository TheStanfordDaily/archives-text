# HEADING SOUTH
## CARDINAL BEGINS PAC-12 PLAY WITH BRUINS, AZTECS 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman forward Zach Batteer is fourth on the team with
11 shots, but consistent with the Cardinal's scoring woes,
has not been able to find the back of the net so far. Stan
ford hopes to reverse its fortunes this weekend against two
teams which have dominated the Cardinal in the past.

Fresh off two key wins at home against
Vermont and Harvard last weekend, the
men's soccer team enters Pac-12 play with
momentum on its side for the first time all
fall. Losing four of the first five matches to
begin the season brought back memories of
last year, when the Cardinal (3-4-1) lost
four straight games and struggled to recov
er, ultimately missing out on the NCAA
Tournament for the seventh time in eight
years.

Head coach Bret Simon puts much of
the blame for the early-season hiccups on
himself.

"Sometime in the winter and spring, I
think I may have overestimated how much
ground we could cover," Simon said. "A
coach has a concept in his mind of how the
team will play the following year. It looks
good in training, but the vision I saw for the
team this fall just didn't work when we got
there-

Stanford lost five regular starters and
several key bench pieces, and a slight
change in the formation has left just three
players starting in the same position as last
season one of whom is redshirt sopho
more goalie Jason Dodson.
"To put all those pieces together, on the
road, with all the new roles and new players,
it just didn't quite happen," Simon said of
having to play the first three matches on the

road to open the year. It didn't help
that one of those games was against
then-No. 4 Maryland the Terrap
ins rode a large home crowd and
several early strikes to a 4-0 victory.
"It was a lesson to be learned,"
Simon said.

But the team has come together
over the subsequent games, and the
players seem to be adjusting to their
new roles. Junior Adam Jahn, in
particular, has taken to his new po
sition in the midfield. The former
forward from Davis, Calif., was
named to Soccer America's Nation-

al Team of the Week and given Pac
-12 Player of the Week honors after
scoring the game-winning goal
against Harvard and adding a go
ahead assist against Vermont.

Junior Eric Anderson has found
a new home himself as an outside
back. Anderson had played both up
top and as an outside midfielder be
fore transitioning to the defense
this season. His speed and danger
ous crosses have added another di
mension to the Cardinal attack
the San Francisco native leads the
team with three assists.
Stanford will need all the of
fense it can get in order to hang with
San Diego State in the Pac-12 open
er on Friday afternoon. The Aztecs
(5-1-2) and their high-octane of
fense have already scored 17 goals
through the first eight games the

Cardinal has scored just eight.
2010 All-Pac-10 selection Miles
Byass has gotten off to a blistering
start, scoring three goals for San
Diego State with four assists to
boot. Stanford will need to slow
down Byass, who keys part of the
Aztec attack from his spot up top, in
order to slow the pace of the game.
It won't get much easier for
Stanford on Sunday, when the Car
dinal takes on No. 25 UCLA (5-3-
1). The Bruins were picked to win
the Pac-12 before the season in the
coaches' poll and were runners-up

in the conference to California last
year.
UCLA started off the season
with two losses and a tie but won
five straight matches before drop
ping a 2-1 decision at home against
SMU last weekend. The Bruins are
led by sophomore midfielder Kelyn
Rowe an early candidate for
Player of the Year after a brilliant
freshman season in Westwood

but have seen an explosion of of
fense from junior Chandler Hoff
man. The Bruin forward has an as
tounding nine goals in the first nine
games, including a hat trick in
UCLA's comeback win over UC-
Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal has never won at
UCLA in the modern era (dating to
1967), but needs a good result in
order to avoid falling behind in the
brutal Pac-12. Overall, Stanford is
7-31-4 all-time against the Bruins
and just 6-11-5 against San Diego
State but split the season series with
both last year.
After the weekend road trip,
Stanford will return for a three
game homestand, but with just 10
games in the conference schedule,
points will be at a premium.
"Getting the first shutout for our
back four on Friday was huge," said
junior captain Hunter Gorskie.
"We're feeling really good, just very
excited heading into Pac-12 play."
Today's game will kick off at 1:30
p.m. in San Diego, with Sunday's
UCLA match slated for 3 p.m.

top and as an outside midfielder be
fore transitioning to the defense
this season. His speed and danger
ous crosses have added another di
mension to the Cardinal attack
the San Francisco native leads the
team with three assists.
Stanford will need all the of
fense it can get in order to hang with
San Diego State in the Pac-12 open
er on Friday afternoon. The Aztecs
(5-1-2) and their high-octane of
fense have already scored 17 goals
through the first eight games the

Cardinal has scored just eight.
2010 All-Pac-10 selection Miles
Byass has gotten off to a blistering
start, scoring three goals for San
Diego State with four assists to
boot. Stanford will need to slow
down Byass, who keys part of the
Aztec attack from his spot up top, in
order to slow the pace of the game.
It won't get much easier for
Stanford on Sunday, when the Car
dinal takes on No. 25 UCLA (5-3-
1). The Bruins were picked to win
the Pac-12 before the season in the
coaches' poll and were runners-up

in the conference to California last
year.
UCLA started off the season
with two losses and a tie but won
five straight matches before drop
ping a 2-1 decision at home against
SMU last weekend. The Bruins are
led by sophomore midfielder Kelyn
Rowe an early candidate for
Player of the Year after a brilliant
freshman season in Westwood

but have seen an explosion of of
fense from junior Chandler Hoff
man. The Bruin forward has an as
tounding nine goals in the first nine
games, including a hat trick in
UCLA's comeback win over UC-
Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal has never won at
UCLA in the modern era (dating to
1967), but needs a good result in
order to avoid falling behind in the
brutal Pac-12. Overall, Stanford is
7-31-4 all-time against the Bruins
and just 6-11-5 against San Diego
State but split the season series with
both last year.
After the weekend road trip,
Stanford will return for a three
game homestand, but with just 10
games in the conference schedule,
points will be at a premium.
"Getting the first shutout for our
back four on Friday was huge," said
junior captain Hunter Gorskie.
"We're feeling really good, just very
excited heading into Pac-12 play."
Today's game will kick off at 1:30
p.m. in San Diego, with Sunday's
UCLA match slated for 3 p.m.

9/30 San Diego
1:30 RM.

GAME NOTES: Stanford faces a stiff test this
weekend as it heads south to take on San
Diego State and UCLA to open Pac-12
play. The Cardinal has never won on the
road against the Bruins in the modern
era, going back nearly 35 years. Stan
ford split the 2010 series against both
opponents, but has not had much suc
cess against either historically. But the
squad is coming off two straight wins and
has a core group of veterans that can
shoulder the load.

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman forward Zach Batteer is fourth on the team with
11 shots, but consistent with the Cardinal's scoring woes,
has not been able to find the back of the net so far. Stan
ford hopes to reverse its fortunes this weekend against two
teams which have dominated the Cardinal in the past.

Fresh off two key wins at home against
Vermont and Harvard last weekend, the
men's soccer team enters Pac-12 play with
momentum on its side for the first time all
fall. Losing four of the first five matches to
begin the season brought back memories of
last year, when the Cardinal (3-4-1) lost
four straight games and struggled to recov
er, ultimately missing out on the NCAA
Tournament for the seventh time in eight
years.

Head coach Bret Simon puts much of
the blame for the early-season hiccups on
himself.

"Sometime in the winter and spring, I
think I may have overestimated how much
ground we could cover," Simon said. "A
coach has a concept in his mind of how the
team will play the following year. It looks
good in training, but the vision I saw for the
team this fall just didn't work when we got
there-

Stanford lost five regular starters and
several key bench pieces, and a slight
change in the formation has left just three
players starting in the same position as last
season one of whom is redshirt sopho
more goalie Jason Dodson.
"To put all those pieces together, on the
road, with all the new roles and new players,
it just didn't quite happen," Simon said of
having to play the first three matches on the

road to open the year. It didn't help
that one of those games was against
then-No. 4 Maryland the Terrap
ins rode a large home crowd and
several early strikes to a 4-0 victory.
"It was a lesson to be learned,"
Simon said.

But the team has come together
over the subsequent games, and the
players seem to be adjusting to their
new roles. Junior Adam Jahn, in
particular, has taken to his new po
sition in the midfield. The former
forward from Davis, Calif., was
named to Soccer America's Nation-

al Team of the Week and given Pac
-12 Player of the Week honors after
scoring the game-winning goal
against Harvard and adding a go
ahead assist against Vermont.
