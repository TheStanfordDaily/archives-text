Dacher Keltner Ph.D., professor
of psychology at UC-Berkeley and
the faculty director of Berkeley's
Greater Good Science Center,
spoke Thursday night on compas
sion from an evolutionary, "sur
vival-of-the-kindest" perspective.
The talk was a part of Stanford's
Center for Compassion and Altru
ism Research and Education's
(CCARE) Meng Wu Lecture Se
ries, which celebrates researchers'

thoughts on compassion and relat
ed fields.

"Evolutionary thought has had a
lot of trouble thinking about the
deep origins of compassion and al
truism," Keltner said. While knowl
edge of human morphology and so
cial behaviors has advanced, social
theorists are divided on the nature
of human goodness, opting for ei
ther a metaphysical or cultural con
struct.

Darwin first attempted to explain
survival of the kindest by positing
that those with a stronger sympathy
trait will flourish and reproduce,
thereby allowing the trait to increase
in prevalence, Keltner said.
