## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Keltner talk explores empathy, evolution Compassion a tool for survival, lecturer said 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Dacher Keltner Ph.D., professor
of psychology at UC-Berkeley and
the faculty director of Berkeley's
Greater Good Science Center,
spoke Thursday night on compas
sion from an evolutionary, "sur
vival-of-the-kindest" perspective.
The talk was a part of Stanford's
Center for Compassion and Altru
ism Research and Education's
(CCARE) Meng Wu Lecture Se
ries, which celebrates researchers'

thoughts on compassion and relat
ed fields.

"Evolutionary thought has had a
lot of trouble thinking about the
deep origins of compassion and al
truism," Keltner said. While knowl
edge of human morphology and so
cial behaviors has advanced, social
theorists are divided on the nature
of human goodness, opting for ei
ther a metaphysical or cultural con
struct.

Darwin first attempted to explain
survival of the kindest by positing
that those with a stronger sympathy
trait will flourish and reproduce,
thereby allowing the trait to increase
in prevalence, Keltner said.
Keltner argued there must be
systems driving the emergence and
spread of sympathy and compas
sion in the gene pool. He said that
four things were necessary for
compassion to possess an evolu
tionary background: a care-giving
system, a reliable indicator, a con
tagion process and an advantage.
It is evolutionarily important
that people are able to recognize
compassion so that others may de
tect the trait and form cooperative
relationships. However, unlike
many emotions such as sadness or
anger, compassion lacks a universal
facial signature. Instead, the uni
versal identification for compas
sion lies in your voice, he said.
Laugh and people will perceive
your amusement, Keltner said; this
"vocal burst" is just one such sound
that effectively communicates
emotion. The same concept is true
for compassion; say "aww" and
people will identify sympathy in
your voice.
Though compassion is commu
nicated through vocal bursts, it is
first spread through touch. Accord
ing to Keltner, tactile contact builds
trusting relationships. For example,
if you pat a student on the back, he
or she is twice as likely to speak out
in class. In basketball, the more
touch that occurs at the individual
and team level, the better the team
plays together and the more games
they win later in the season.
"It's incredible what anatomy
we've been endowed with to make
touch such an incredible medium
of emotion and compassion," Kelt
ner said.
And for good reason too, be
cause apparently it pays to be good.
Keltner cited studies showing that
more compassionate parenting
produces healthier offspring and
that compassion is the most desired
trait worldwide in sexual selection.
However, the United States and
many other countries are now fac
ing a compassion crisis according
to Keltner. A cultural shift has oc
curred in the modern generation,
as today's children are more narcis
sistic and materialistic than those
of 30 years ago.
Keltner said that inequality and
materialism constrain compassion
by forming a barrier between class
es and individuals.
However, he said, there is hope.
Compassion can be cultivated via
individual mindfulness and cultur
al memes.
"Compassion could improve
everything from interpersonal
relationships to business to sports,"
said Ellie Clougherty 'l3, who at
tended the lecture.
"It augments every part of your
life," Maia Mosse 'l3, another audi
ence member, added.
"And you don't have to compro
mise anything to be more compas
sionate," Clougherty said.
