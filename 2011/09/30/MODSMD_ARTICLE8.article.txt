## Dyslexia may just be a label, study suggests 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF Brendan O'Byrne 
The brains of children with dyslexia and those of chil
dren with low IQ have few differences, according to re
search from Stanford psychologists.
The research, carried out by psychiatric students, was
conducted by asking children with low-reading skills,
some with dyslexia and others with low IQs, a series of
rhyme-recognition questions. During this time, a func
tional MRI scanner monitored the subjects.
They found that 80 percent of the time, children diag
nosed with dyslexia and those with lower IQs had identi
cal MRI scans. In the Journal of Psychological Science
the researchers said that "the longstanding and widely
applied diagnosis of dyslexia by IQ discrepancy is not
supported."
Oxford professor John Stein, who founded the
Dyslexia Research Trust, has hotly contested the re
search. In an interview with British newspaper The Tele
graph, Stein said, "Dyslexia is real. This study ignores all
the genetic evidence, and a lot of other neurological evi
dence that dyslexia is a distinct syndrome."
