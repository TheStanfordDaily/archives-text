One of former President George W. Bush's first acts
after taking office in early 2001 was to cut funding for all
NGOs operating abroad that provided funding for abor
tions. The policy, highly touted by social conservatives,
has caused the abortion rates in countries where those
NGOs were operating to rise, according to two Stanford
researchers.

Researchers at the School of Medicine Dr. Eran Ben
david, Patrick Avila and Grant Miller Ph.D. found that
the African countries where funding was cut the most
had the highest rises in abortion rates. Between 2001 and
2008, countries most affected by the policy saw abortion
rates more than double.

The unintended consequences stem from the fact that
many organizations that provide family planning, such as
International Planned Parenthood Federation, also pro
vide contraception and information about birth control
in addition to abortion counseling.

"If women use abortion as a substitute for modern
contraceptives, then reductions in birth control supply
could lead to an increase in abortions," said Miller, assis
tant professor of medicine and Stanford Health Policy
faculty member, in an interview with the Stanford Re
port.
The policy, originally enacted by former President
Ronald Reagan, was based on the principle that taxpay
er money should not be spent on funding abortions.
"Regardless of one's view about abortion, this result
shows that the policy objectives of neither side are being
met," Miller said.
