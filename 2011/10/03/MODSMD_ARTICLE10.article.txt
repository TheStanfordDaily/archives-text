# FRESHMAN '15
## Things I wish I could somehow un-see 
### Bianca Chavez 
I suck at sharing. Even though I'm
not an only child, I've never really
gotten used to the whole "this ob
ject belongs to both of us, and we are
both allowed to use it" concept. So it
really should come as no surprise that
I am slightly (read: very) disturbed by
Stanford's communal bathroom situ
ation.
You know how on TV, college
bathrooms are these steamy places
where mostly naked students stand
around and flirt? Apparently TV
writers never actually attended col
lege, Because if they did, I guarantee
bathrooms on television would look a
helluva lot different.
First, let's get rid of this "co-ed is
sexy" idea. At least in Stern, there are
separate facilities for men and
women. And I thank dear old Leland
and Jane for that fact at least 10 times
a day. (Even if they didn't, you know,
directly have a say in the construction
of the bathrooms.) Because really, no
body looks cute at 3 a.m. Do you real
ly want the guy you've been hooking
up with for the entire quarter to see
you puking your guts up after too
many shots? Or first thing the next
morning when your smoky-eye
makeup has smeared down to your
chin and your hair would make Amy
Winehouse step back and say, "Whoa
girlfriend, that's a little too trashy"?
Didn't think so.
And I've never seen floor-mates

hold full-on conversations in the
bano, either. Sure, people say "Hey,"
but we're in there for a reason, you
know? No need for superfluous talk
ing. Also, I'm not quite sure how to
converse with someone clad only in a
too-small towel; my crappy public
high school must have skipped that
lesson. (But we totally spent three
weeks learning how to divide frac
tions. Which lesson seems like the
more important life skill?!? Clearly
some educators need to get their pri
orities ironed out.) My aversion to the
sight of ass cheeks first thing in the
morning is part of the reason why I
am such a huge proponent of
bathrobes. They're also soft and fluffy
sort of like slipping on a cuddly kit
ten after a shower. And most impor
tantly, I guarantee a trusty robe will
save you from at least one dreadfully
awkward situation per year. In my
book, that makes it a $14.99 well
spent.
I suppose I would be a lot more
comfortable with communal bath
rooms if everyone else using them had
obsessive-compulsive cleaning habits.
But somehow, I always manage to
jump in the shower just after That Girl
steps out. You know, the bitch down
the hall who wastes all the hot water
and leaves copious amounts of hair in
the drain. The Chewbacca living on
the first floor of Twain has recently
taken it one step further; she makes

lovely murals out of drain hair and
leaves them for all to see.

As much as they may scare me,
communal bathrooms have taught
me two lessons. Number one: things
are not always going to be ideal.
Wouldn't it be nice if we each got our
own marble bathroom with a built-in
Jacuzzi? And at night, maybe little
Keebler elves could come and scrub
them clean. Instead, we get mildew-y
shower stalls and abstract art made of
hair. The trick is to make the best out
of less-than-ideal situations, and
when all else fails, laugh. Laugh at
yourself, laugh at the ridiculous
predicaments you find yourself in,
laugh until your stomach hurts. When
you're done, things usually look at
least a little brighter.
The second lesson that Stanford
bathrooms have taught me? Always
and I do mean always wear
shower shoes.

Think it's too soon to be making Amy
Winehouse jokes? Tell Bianca at
