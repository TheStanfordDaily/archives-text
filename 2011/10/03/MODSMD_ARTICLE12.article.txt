## Affirmative action: yummy and delicious 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Take a few sticks of butter,
some chocolate and a can of
frosting, mix in a few hundred
angry protestors, top with a dollop
of racial tension and heat at high
temperature until combustion, and
you get the recipe for disaster that
was UC-Berkeley last week.
Seizing the opportunity to sati
rize the new pro-affirmative action
legislation that was under debate in
the California state legislature last
week, the Berkeley College Re
publicans (BCR) enthusiastically
held what they termed an "Increase
Diversity Bake Sale" last Tuesday.
The sale was intended to protest
Senate Bill 185, which has since
been passed by the state legislature
and now awaits Governor Jerry
Brown's approval. The bill would
allow the state university system to
consider race and gender when
making admissions decisions.
Using the weapon of satire, the
bake sale charged differential
prices to consumers based on eth
nicity and sex. White students seek
ing to purchase yummy cookies and

cupcakes were charged $2, while
Asians had to fork over a mere
$1.50, Hispanics $l, African Ameri
cans $0.75 and Native Americans a
quarter. Women of all races re
ceived a 25-cent discount (the
noble efforts of several Native-
American women to abscond with
truckloads of free cookies were,
alas, rebuffed).
If attention was the BCR's goal,
then it succeeded rather brilliantly.
Not surprisingly, the bake sale im
mediately aroused the hysteria of
UC-Berkeley students and admin
istrators alike, triggering instanta
neous paroxysms of outrage from
the Vice Chancellor for Equity and
Inclusion, various pro-affirmative
action student groups and a horde
of counter-protestors who all wore
black and pretended to die en
masse in front of the bake sale table
all of which was, of course, pre
cisely the kind of sensationalist re
sponse the bake sale was designed
to elicit. The mainstream media
soon swooped in to gleefully cher
ry-pick the most deliciously nasty

quotes from the ensuing shout-fest,
and voila: instant, glorious national
attention for the Berkeley College
Republicans.
If a similar event ever occurs at
Stanford, I would hope that we
could be better than that that we
would respond with reasoned argu
ment rather than substance-less
shouting to a provocation clearly
designed to spark the latter, that we
could take advantage of a rare op
portunity to have a tough, painful
but ultimately rewarding discus
sion about race and class and that
we would be confident enough in
the soundness of our arguments to
conduct them in a civil manner.
But until then, let's start by ad
dressing the BCR's main point

(and how to begin the conversation
that Cal could have had last week).
Is taking account of race and gen
der in university admissions deci
sions really analogous to, and as
manifestly unjust as, differential
cookie pricing? It depends, I think,
on what precisely affirmative ac
tion is designed to achieve.
If we take at face value Justice
Powell's calculus in Bakke , which
held that affirmative action is legal
insofar as it promotes the state's
justified interest in improving the
quality of learning within universi
ty walls, then race and gender
would seem to be reasonable fac
tors to include in a holistic admis
sions review. Students at a universi
ty composed solely of Asian fe
males or Hispanic males or whites
or whoever would surely suffer
from an impaired ability to learn
about worlds and perspectives dif
ferent from their own worlds
and perspectives invariably colored
by race, experience and culture.
