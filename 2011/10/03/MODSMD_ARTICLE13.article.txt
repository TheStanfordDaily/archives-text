The Red Zone and
student football tickets

Dear Editor:
The Red Zone serves as the heart
of Stanford Stadium's energy and pas
sion on game day, driving our football
team to greater heights in every home
game. The Department of Athletics
firmly believes students represent the
core of our fan base, both today and in
the future.
For the 2011-12 season, Stanford
Athletics has transitioned to a new
student ticketing procedure for foot
ball games in anticipation of record
setting student demand. The capacity
of the Red Zone has been increased
for this season to include an addition
al three sections and now stretches
from sectionlo2to 111.Unfortunate
ly, there are simply not enough seats
to meet the demand from a passion
ate and dedicated student body and
fan base. For example, the full alloca
tion of student tickets for the UCLA
game was claimed within five hours
of becoming available last Tuesday
evening.The strong turnout and ener
gy in the Red Zone was overwhelm
ing on game day.
Our intention has been to create a
simple and equitable system that fairly
serves all parties, but we welcome your
feedback as we continue to refine the
process. For complete information on
the student ticketing process, the Red
Zone Loyalty Point Program and
other student-related questions,
please visit www.gostanford.com/red
zone. All students are also encouraged
to sign up for the Red Alert, Stanford
Athletics' weekly e-newsletter con
taining ticketing updates, promotions,
giveaways, highlights and more, by vis
iting http://www.gostanford.com/ot
/redalert.html.
Please Note: student tickets for the
game against Colorado will be re
leased at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 4.

On the availability of
Art Department offerings

Dear Editor,
The publication last week of
Jamie Solomon's column, "On the
Margins, Between the Lines: The
Art Department hates me," shined
light on a problem that, from a cer
tain perspective, seems to be borne
of success. The picture might be de
scribed as follows: Interest in the
visual and performing arts has
been gaining momentum among
Stanford students for years. It has
been nurtured by the University's
Arts Initiative and the Stanford In
stitute for Creativity and the Arts.
Thanks to the Arts Initiative, this
interest is also taking palpable
form in a new arts district around
the Cantor Arts Center, with the
construction of the Bing Concert
Hall, the future McMurtry Build
ing for the Department of Art &
Art History and the Anderson Col
lection at Stanford University, all of
which will increase the arts oppor
tunities on campus.
Given the attention that has
been focused in recent years on how
the arts might play a more signifi
cant role in the educational experi
ence of all Stanford undergradu
ates, it is gratifying to see increasing
demand for courses in art practice.
However, at times it has been diffi
cult to adapt existing spaces and
procedures to accommodate all stu
dents who wish to take introductory
courses that involve hands-on prac
tice and individual attention.
The fact of the matter is that
small courses taught by Stanford's
outstanding arts practitioners may
always be oversubscribed I know
from colleagues that this can be a
problem with popular courses in
other fields as well. For this reason,
arts programs and departments
need to develop mechanisms to en
sure that students will not be repeat
edly turned away. Once might be
understandable, a second time
would be unfortunate, but three
times (or more!) is simply not ac
ceptable.
What are we doing today to en
sure that Jamie Solomon's experi
ence will not be repeated? In the
Art & Art History Department, we
are reviewing our waitlist proce
dures and working to develop a
computer-based system that will
track students who plan to major,
minor, or simply wish to take a
course in some aspect of Art Prac
tice. We are committed to devising
better means of advising which
courses are likely to top out and di
recting students to enroll in alterna
tives where space is available. We
are also continuing to explore how
to increase usage of our classrooms,
which in the past has sometimes al
lowed us to double or even triple of
ferings during a single quarter in the
most sought-after media photog
raphy, for example.
Space continues to be a tremen
dous challenge and, therefore, we
look forward to our move to the new
McMurtry Building where we antici
pate having better storage facilities
and greater studio classroom flexibili
ty. Efforts are also underway to in
crease the capacity for student arts
practice opportunities in the resi
dence halls and other facilities around
campus. All of these steps will help en
sure that students like Jamie Solomon
know they are not hated but instead
welcomed by all of Stanford's arts
programs, and particularly the Art &
Art History Department.

On the availability of
Art Department offerings

Dear Editor,
The publication last week of
Jamie Solomon's column, "On the
Margins, Between the Lines: The
Art Department hates me," shined
light on a problem that, from a cer
tain perspective, seems to be borne
of success. The picture might be de
scribed as follows: Interest in the
visual and performing arts has
been gaining momentum among
Stanford students for years. It has
been nurtured by the University's
Arts Initiative and the Stanford In
stitute for Creativity and the Arts.
Thanks to the Arts Initiative, this
interest is also taking palpable
form in a new arts district around
the Cantor Arts Center, with the
construction of the Bing Concert
Hall, the future McMurtry Build
ing for the Department of Art &
Art History and the Anderson Col
lection at Stanford University, all of
which will increase the arts oppor
tunities on campus.
Given the attention that has
been focused in recent years on how
the arts might play a more signifi
cant role in the educational experi
ence of all Stanford undergradu
ates, it is gratifying to see increasing
demand for courses in art practice.
However, at times it has been diffi
cult to adapt existing spaces and
procedures to accommodate all stu
dents who wish to take introductory
courses that involve hands-on prac
tice and individual attention.
The fact of the matter is that
small courses taught by Stanford's
outstanding arts practitioners may
always be oversubscribed I know
from colleagues that this can be a
problem with popular courses in
other fields as well. For this reason,
arts programs and departments
need to develop mechanisms to en
sure that students will not be repeat
edly turned away. Once might be
understandable, a second time
would be unfortunate, but three
times (or more!) is simply not ac
ceptable.
What are we doing today to en
sure that Jamie Solomon's experi
ence will not be repeated? In the
Art & Art History Department, we
are reviewing our waitlist proce
dures and working to develop a
computer-based system that will
track students who plan to major,
minor, or simply wish to take a
course in some aspect of Art Prac
tice. We are committed to devising
better means of advising which
courses are likely to top out and di
recting students to enroll in alterna
tives where space is available. We
are also continuing to explore how
to increase usage of our classrooms,
which in the past has sometimes al
lowed us to double or even triple of
ferings during a single quarter in the
most sought-after media photog
raphy, for example.
Space continues to be a tremen
dous challenge and, therefore, we
look forward to our move to the new
McMurtry Building where we antici
pate having better storage facilities
and greater studio classroom flexibili
ty. Efforts are also underway to in
crease the capacity for student arts
practice opportunities in the resi
dence halls and other facilities around
campus. All of these steps will help en
sure that students like Jamie Solomon
know they are not hated but instead
welcomed by all of Stanford's arts
programs, and particularly the Art &
Art History Department.
