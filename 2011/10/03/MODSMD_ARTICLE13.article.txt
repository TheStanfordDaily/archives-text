The Red Zone and
student football tickets

Dear Editor:
The Red Zone serves as the heart
of Stanford Stadium's energy and pas
sion on game day, driving our football
team to greater heights in every home
game. The Department of Athletics
firmly believes students represent the
core of our fan base, both today and in
the future.
For the 2011-12 season, Stanford
Athletics has transitioned to a new
student ticketing procedure for foot
ball games in anticipation of record
setting student demand. The capacity
of the Red Zone has been increased
for this season to include an addition
al three sections and now stretches
from sectionlo2to 111.Unfortunate
ly, there are simply not enough seats
to meet the demand from a passion
ate and dedicated student body and
fan base. For example, the full alloca
tion of student tickets for the UCLA
game was claimed within five hours
of becoming available last Tuesday
evening.The strong turnout and ener
gy in the Red Zone was overwhelm
ing on game day.
Our intention has been to create a
simple and equitable system that fairly
serves all parties, but we welcome your
feedback as we continue to refine the
process. For complete information on
the student ticketing process, the Red
Zone Loyalty Point Program and
other student-related questions,
please visit www.gostanford.com/red
zone. All students are also encouraged
to sign up for the Red Alert, Stanford
Athletics' weekly e-newsletter con
taining ticketing updates, promotions,
giveaways, highlights and more, by vis

Please Note: student tickets for the
game against Colorado will be re
leased at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 4.
