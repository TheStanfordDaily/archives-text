# Palo Alto, firefighters reach agreement
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
The Palo Alto Fire Fighters
Union voted Friday in approval of a
new labor contract with the city that

runs through June 30,2014. The City
Council tentatively approved the
contract and is set to vote on it offi
cially Oct. 17.
Many of the agreement's provi
sions are derived from the city's
budget woes.The contract is project
ed to save Palo Alto $l.l million this
fiscal year and $1.5 million per year
starting next July. Wages for fire
fighters will not increase for the du
ration of the agreement except for a
two percent, cost-of-living increase;
in fact, they will decrease by nine
percent to compensate for an in
crease in prior agreements.
J'he contract also eliminates the
staffing standard requiring that 29
firefighters be on duty at any given
time.
"The firefighters are pleased to
have worked with the city to come to
an agreement on a contract that will
cover our terms of employment with
the city for the next three years," said
Tony Spitaleri, president of the Palo
Alto Fire Fighters Union, in a press

release from the union.
"In these tough economic times,
it is important that we do what we
can to make sure the city can meet its
fiscal responsibilities," he continued.
"Like all negotiations, both sides
came to compromise. We look for
ward to continuing to work with the
city to provide the best services to
the residents of Palo Alto."
Compromises have also been
struck with regard to the firefighters'
pension plans. Negotiations, which
began 16 months ago, reached an im
passe last February.
"I am pleased that we have been
able to reach agreement with our
Fire Fighters Union after a long ne
gotiation period," said Palo Alto
Mayor Sid Espinosa in the city's
statement . "The city is not out of the
woods financially, but this agree
ment with the firefighters is a neces
sary step forward."
