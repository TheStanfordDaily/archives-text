# Stanford launches center to study senior fraud

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ EUora Israni 
The University's Center on
Longevity and the FINRA Investor
Education Foundation have jointly
launched the interdisciplinary Re
search Center on the Prevention of
Financial Fraud, which will supple
ment work by law enforcement, the
government and research groups in
understanding how Americans lose
money to fraud.
The center's inaugural confer
ence, "The State and Future of Fi
nancial Fraud," will be held Nov. 3
and Nov. 4 in Washington, D.C.
The Center on Longevity is in
cluded in the partnership as the eld
erly are frequent targets for fraud;
however, according to the center's
founding director Laura
Carstensen, also a professor of psy
chology, all age groups and financial
profiles are at risk.
"Even people who did every
thing right are finding themselves in
situations where those savings are
being stolen," she told the Stanford
Report.

In fact, the elderly are often
caught in financial scams not be
cause of their vulnerability, but be
cause they are sometimes wealthier
than other segments of the popula
tion. According to fraud expert
Doug Shadel, the profiles of those
who get caught in these schemes are
often counterintuitive.

"[A man] lost $40,000 [in an oil
and-gas scheme], but what was inter
esting about the guy is that he was a
stockbroker," Shadel told the Stan
ford News Service. "You wouldn't
think that of someone who day-in
and day-out gives people advice
about money."
"We assumed that the people
who were defrauded were less finan
cially literate wouldn't you think
so?" he continued. "It's not the case
at all."
He mentioned doctors, lawyers
and company presidents as common
fraud victims.
The center has so far enumerated
three purposes: consolidating infor
mation for academic use, communi
cating this research to policymakers
and funding research.
The center is also developing psy
chological portraits of those who
tend to fall for scams as those who
are "more open," according to
Shadel.
"They're more likely to read
every piece of mail they get, includ
ing junk mail," he said. "They're ex
posing themselves to the market
place."
The center said it aims to address
the concern that many individuals
do not admit they are fraud victims
because of shame, embarrassment
or denial. In a study of 723 victims,
only 40 percent said they had lost
money.
"It's unknowable what the real
statistic is," Shadel said.
