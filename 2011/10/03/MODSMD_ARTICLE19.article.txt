## STILL UNBEATABLE CARD SETS PAC-12 RECORD IN LATE WIN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
For nearly three years, conference play has
been anything but tough going for the No. 1
Stanford women's soccer team. But on a week
end where the squad had a chance to break the
record for the longest win streak in Pac-12 histo
ry, things got hairy for the Cardinal for the first

time in a long while.
It took goals in
the 86th and 94th
minutes in a pair of
1-0 wins to put
Stanford in the
record books, as
the Cardinal nar-

rowly escaped Washington and Washington
State to extend its conference win streak to 23
games.
Stanford (11-0-1, 3-0 Pac-12) remains unde
feated on the season and has not lost in Pac-10
(or -12) play since Oct. 2008. Yet as long as that
run may seem, the bulk of the streak's drama has
come over the past four days.
Before this weekend, the Cardinal had
outscored its opponents by nearly three goals
per game during the streak, notched the winning
tally by the 60th minute over 75 percent of the
time and been on the board by the 29th minute
on average. Only once did it take the team more
than 75 minutes to score its opening goal in a

2009 match against the Washington St. Cougars,
Stanford needed an 87th-minute goal by Chris
ten Press to send the game to overtime before
the Cardinal could take the game 2-1 in the extra
frame.
The team's first trip back to Pullman, Wash,
since that game was just as dangerous. Stan
ford outshot Washington State 22-6 as op
posed to the 22-7 margin in 2009 and, yet
again, nothing was finding the back of the
Cougars' net.
But in the waning moments of the second
half, senior forward Lindsay Taylor whose
cross in 2009 found the head of then-teammate
Kelley O'Hara for the overtime winner in Pull
man found herself at the center of the action
once again. This time, however, she would be
tasked with finishing off the match, diving for a
header off a pass from senior Camille Levin for
the game winner at the 85:09 mark.
The Cardinal got off to an even slower start
on Sunday at Washington, failing to get a shot off
until 10 minutes into the match and going corn

pletely dry for two other extended periods in the
first half alone. Stanford did have several quality
shots, including a 25th-minute header from sen
ior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen off the cross
bar, but the Huskies played physical defense to
keep the Cardinal from capitalizing on its
chances from within the box.
Withstanding a late-second-half push from
Stanford to send the game into overtime score
less, Washington coming off a 1-1 tie with Cal
on Friday looked poised to draw yet another
match with the tight defense that had halted the
Cardinal all afternoon. But just two minutes into
the first overtime period, Husky sophomore for
ward Hillary Zevenbergen found herself all
alone in front of sophomore goalkeeper Emily
Oliver, who came up with a game-saving stop on
Zevenbergen's low shot.
After turning away the ensuing corner kick,
Stanford pushed the ball upfield, and a cross
from junior midfielder Mariah Nogueira found
senior midfielder Teresa Noyola at the far post.
Noyola's header snuck through the defense to
extend the Cardinal's conference win streak
with the squad's first overtime victory since a 2-
1 decision over Georgia on Sept. 10,2010.
Stanford also continued its dominant defen
sive run, which includes a staggering 567 minutes
and 26 seconds of game time since giving up its
last goal over a month ago. Oliver has been key
to that success, posting a stellar .920 save per
centage on the season to lead the Pac-12 in that
category.
She'll have to be at the top of her game next
weekend, as Stanford faces its toughest two
game test of the season against USC and UCLA.

first half alone. Stanford did have several quality
shots, including a 25th-minute header from sen
ior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen off the cross
bar, but the Huskies played physical defense to
keep the Cardinal from capitalizing on its
chances from within the box.
Withstanding a late-second-half push from
Stanford to send the game into overtime score
less, Washington coming off a 1-1 tie with Cal
on Friday looked poised to draw yet another
match with the tight defense that had halted the
Cardinal all afternoon. But just two minutes into
the first overtime period, Husky sophomore for
ward Hillary Zevenbergen found herself all
alone in front of sophomore goalkeeper Emily
Oliver, who came up with a game-saving stop on
Zevenbergen's low shot.
After turning away the ensuing corner kick,
Stanford pushed the ball upfield, and a cross
from junior midfielder Mariah Nogueira found
senior midfielder Teresa Noyola at the far post.
Noyola's header snuck through the defense to
extend the Cardinal's conference win streak
with the squad's first overtime victory since a 2-
1 decision over Georgia on Sept. 10,2010.
Stanford also continued its dominant defen
sive run, which includes a staggering 567 minutes
and 26 seconds of game time since giving up its
last goal over a month ago. Oliver has been key
to that success, posting a stellar .920 save per
centage on the season to lead the Pac-12 in that
category.
She'll have to be at the top of her game next
weekend, as Stanford faces its toughest two
game test of the season against USC and UCLA.

For nearly three years, conference play has
been anything but tough going for the No. 1
Stanford women's soccer team. But on a week
end where the squad had a chance to break the
record for the longest win streak in Pac-12 histo
ry, things got hairy for the Cardinal for the first

time in a long while.
It took goals in
the 86th and 94th
minutes in a pair of
1-0 wins to put
Stanford in the
record books, as
the Cardinal nar-

rowly escaped Washington and Washington
State to extend its conference win streak to 23
games.
Stanford (11-0-1, 3-0 Pac-12) remains unde
feated on the season and has not lost in Pac-10
(or -12) play since Oct. 2008. Yet as long as that
run may seem, the bulk of the streak's drama has
come over the past four days.
Before this weekend, the Cardinal had
outscored its opponents by nearly three goals
per game during the streak, notched the winning
tally by the 60th minute over 75 percent of the
time and been on the board by the 29th minute
on average. Only once did it take the team more
than 75 minutes to score its opening goal in a

2009 match against the Washington St. Cougars,
Stanford needed an 87th-minute goal by Chris
ten Press to send the game to overtime before
the Cardinal could take the game 2-1 in the extra
frame.
The team's first trip back to Pullman, Wash,
since that game was just as dangerous. Stan
ford outshot Washington State 22-6 as op
posed to the 22-7 margin in 2009 and, yet
again, nothing was finding the back of the
Cougars' net.
But in the waning moments of the second
half, senior forward Lindsay Taylor whose
cross in 2009 found the head of then-teammate
Kelley O'Hara for the overtime winner in Pull
man found herself at the center of the action
once again. This time, however, she would be
tasked with finishing off the match, diving for a
header off a pass from senior Camille Levin for
the game winner at the 85:09 mark.
The Cardinal got off to an even slower start
on Sunday at Washington, failing to get a shot off
until 10 minutes into the match and going corn

pletely dry for two other extended periods in the
first half alone. Stanford did have several quality
shots, including a 25th-minute header from sen
ior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen off the cross
bar, but the Huskies played physical defense to
keep the Cardinal from capitalizing on its
chances from within the box.
Withstanding a late-second-half push from
Stanford to send the game into overtime score
less, Washington coming off a 1-1 tie with Cal
on Friday looked poised to draw yet another
match with the tight defense that had halted the
Cardinal all afternoon. But just two minutes into
the first overtime period, Husky sophomore for

sive run, which includes a staggering 567 minutes

centage on the season to lead the Pac-12 in that
category.
