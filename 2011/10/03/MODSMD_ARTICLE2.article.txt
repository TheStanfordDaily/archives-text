## West campus gym breaks ground 
### JOSH HOYT 
Construction on the Arrillaga
Outdoor Education and Recreation
Center is set to be completed by
winter quarter 2013, administrators
predict.
The new gym will closely resem
ble the existing Arrillaga Center for
Sports and Recreation (ACSR)
from the outside and will have the
same 75,000-square-foot size, but
will not include the same facilities
for Stanford athletic teams. Work
ers broke ground for the new gym in
August.

Instead, the new facility is aimed
at providing more comprehensive
and accessible recreation to encour
age health and wellness for all stu
dents. It serves the west side of cam
pus — which has not had its own
weight-room facilities since most of
the equipment was moved to the
ACSR in 2005 and aims to bring
together recreational opportunities
that go beyond the basics.
"It is a prime location because
we have the golf course there and
the Red Barn and other recreation
al opportunities," said Deputy Ath
letic Director Ray Purpur. "But cur

rently the pool is inadequate, [like]
the facilities in general."
The building will have two
floors, similar to the ACSR, with the
upper featuring a large space for
Stanford's strong outdoor educa
tion programs. It will be the new
home of Stanford Outdoor Gear
(SOG), which is currently based out
of shipping containers on Stock
Farm Road. There is also the possi
bility of a retail area that will sell
outdoor equipment.
The entry level will have three

basketball courts, a space for the
club cycling team, a 3,200-square
foot climbing wall and a 1,700-
square-foot dance studio. The facil
ity emphasizes flexible usage space
to accommodate the diverse and
changing recreational activities of
the students.
"Part of it is we don't yet know
what the demand is," Purpur said.
"At one time, everybody wanted
racquetball courts and now nobody
does, although there has been a
surge lately."
The basement floor has even
more flexible space, with four
smaller classrooms and two larger
spaces, one 3,500 square feet and
the other 3,300 square feet, all de
signed for general-purpose use. The
basement will also feature a large
weight room.
"It will be quite a bit bigger than
the one we have now," Purpur said.
"It will have men's locker rooms
and women's locker rooms and
showers and everything, and it will
be attached to the pool."
The pool will be 50 meters,
Olympic sized and will only be used
for recreation. One end of the pool
will have a zero-entry feature that
allows people to enter and exit
without using the standard ladders.
The pool construction will be
funded by the Avery family, the
family that funded the Avery
Aquatic Center, while the Arrillaga
family is again covering the majori
ty of the costs for the gym facilities.
The construction costs will come
from the two families, while the

"University fees," which include
costs such as permitting and archi
tects, will come from the Universi
ty's general funds. Cost estimates

range between $3O and 40 million.
Construction will mean a reduc
tion in the size of Roble Field,
which decreases the amount of
open space on west campus. How
ever, by eliminating the existing
Roble Pool and some temporary
buildings, there will be space for a
full-size soccer field between Roble
Gym and the new recreation cen
ter.
"1 know the University is very
good at making sure there is plenty
of green space," Purpur said. "That
is what 'the Farm' is."
