Center is set to be completed by
winter quarter 2013, administrators

The building will have two
floors, similar to the ACSR, with the
upper featuring a large space for
Stanford's strong outdoor educa

home of Stanford Outdoor Gear
(SOG), which is currently based out
of shipping containers on Stock
Farm Road. There is also the possi
bility of a retail area that will sell
outdoor equipment.
The entry level will have three
