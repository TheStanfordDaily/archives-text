### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
In this week's Stat on the Back,
I'll take a look at Stanford's 45-
19 win over UCLA.
Number of the game: 1
What it means: It may be the
loneliest number, but Stanford's play
ers didn't seem to need anything more
to make Catch of the Year 1A and
Catch of the Year 18.
How important was the number
one? Consider this: on the first drive
of the first quarter, the Stanford de
fense stopped UCLA on the one-yard
line. Then, on Stanford's first drive, the
Cardinal used a one-handed catch by
the No. 1 player in the country (and fu
ture No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft). An
drew Luck, and a one-handed catch
by Coby Fleener (who is No. 1 in the
nation in touchdowns by a tight end)
to get the first points of the game.
Why it matters: Stanford was going
to beat UCLA on Saturday, even if the
Cardinal came out flat from its bye
week. More importantly, though,
Stanford needed some signature plays
to get the fans in the game early and to
bolster the team's confidence.
It's hard to do much better on
those fronts than a goal-line stand on
the first series of the game followed
immediately by the aforementioned
grabs by Luck and Fleener. The de
fense looked more pumped up than it
had all year when it stuffed the Bruins
four times from inside the five-yard
line, and the crowd was louder than it
had been all year when the referees
overturned the call of incomplete on
Luck's catch.
And while no one on the team or
coaching staff will admit to caring
about it, Luck's catch definitely helps
his Heisman campaign. Don't be sur
prised if you keep seeing his catch
throughout the season, just like Cam
Newton's run through the LSU de
fense last year and Desmond
Howard's punt return and pose in
1991. Last year, it was all about Luck's
hits on Sean Cattouse and Shareece
Wright.This year, it could be all about
his one-handed catch.
Other notable numbers:
200: For the third straight week,
Stanford broke the 200-yard mark
both through the air and on the
ground, led by efficient games from
Luck (23-for-27 passing) and Stepfan
Taylor (17 carries for 112 yards and

two touchdowns). Of the 24 comple
tions, 10 different players caught a
pass. Head coach David Shaw preach
es balance at least as much as Jim
Harbaugh did, and he won't be satis
fied with a one-dimensional team, no
matter how strong that dimension is.
How's Stanford doing balance-wise?
The Cardinal ranks 31st in the nation
in rushing and 32nd in passing. That's
a balanced offense. Stanford ranks
seventh in scoring offense and sixth in
scoring defense. That's a balanced
team.
141: Stanford allowed 141 rushing
yards to UCLA. In the first three
games of the season combined, the
Cardinal gave up only 108 rushing
yards. Was the run defense that bad?

No. Was the run defense really that
good for the first three weeks? No.
Stanford held UCLA well below its
season average on the ground, but
there were still several gaping holes
for Johnathan Franklin right up the
middle. Most likely, Stanford won't
routinely give up over 140 rushing
yards per game, but it also won't hold
many teams below 40. Most teams in
the Pac-12 rely more heavily on the
passing game, so the running numbers
will probably end up halfway be
tween these two numbers.
3: A big reason why Stanford had
less success stopping the run was its
inability to tackle Bruin rushers be
hind the line. The Cardinal had only
three tackles for loss on Saturday
after leading the nation with 31 in its
first three games. Yet again, the
UCLA offensive line was better than
the other lines Stanford has faced, so
it's not surprising the numbers went
down.

Still, every team in the country av
erages more than three tackles for
loss, so the lack of big-play defense is
somewhat worrisome. The defense is
one of just three teams without an in
terception this year, so the big plays
have to come from tackles behind the
line. With the loss of Shayne Skov,
Stanford will be without its best big
play defender for the rest of the year.
The rest of the team needs to pick up
the slack.
8: What makes three tackles for a
loss not seem so bad? When your of
fense has allowed only eight tackles
for a loss all season.The offensive line
has shown some holes at times, but
when you have the fewest negative
plays of any team in the country, your
line must be doing something right.
22: Stanford has gotten to the red
zone 22 times this season. Every one
of those times, the Cardinal has come
away with points. That's the best of
any team in the country. When you
don't turn it over (one turnover all
season, best in the country) and your
kicker doesn't miss (Jordan
Williamson is 7-for-7),you become al
most impossible to stop.
12: The winning streak continues.
