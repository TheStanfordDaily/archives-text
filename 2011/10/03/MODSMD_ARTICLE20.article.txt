### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
In this week's Stat on the Back,
I'll take a look at Stanford's 45-
19 win over UCLA.
Number of the game: 1
What it means: It may be the
loneliest number, but Stanford's play
ers didn't seem to need anything more
to make Catch of the Year 1A and
Catch of the Year 18.
How important was the number
one? Consider this: on the first drive
of the first quarter, the Stanford de
fense stopped UCLA on the one-yard
line. Then, on Stanford's first drive, the
Cardinal used a one-handed catch by
the No. 1 player in the country (and fu
ture No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft). An
drew Luck, and a one-handed catch
by Coby Fleener (who is No. 1 in the
nation in touchdowns by a tight end)
to get the first points of the game.
Why it matters: Stanford was going
to beat UCLA on Saturday, even if the
Cardinal came out flat from its bye
week. More importantly, though,
Stanford needed some signature plays
to get the fans in the game early and to
bolster the team's confidence.
It's hard to do much better on
those fronts than a goal-line stand on
the first series of the game followed
immediately by the aforementioned
grabs by Luck and Fleener. The de
fense looked more pumped up than it
had all year when it stuffed the Bruins
four times from inside the five-yard
line, and the crowd was louder than it
had been all year when the referees
overturned the call of incomplete on
Luck's catch.
And while no one on the team or
coaching staff will admit to caring
about it, Luck's catch definitely helps
his Heisman campaign. Don't be sur
prised if you keep seeing his catch
throughout the season, just like Cam
Newton's run through the LSU de
fense last year and Desmond
Howard's punt return and pose in
1991. Last year, it was all about Luck's
hits on Sean Cattouse and Shareece
Wright.This year, it could be all about
his one-handed catch.
Other notable numbers:
200: For the third straight week,
Stanford broke the 200-yard mark
both through the air and on the
ground, led by efficient games from
Luck (23-for-27 passing) and Stepfan
Taylor (17 carries for 112 yards and
