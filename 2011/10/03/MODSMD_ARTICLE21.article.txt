## Cardinal couldn't find the net on SoCal roadtrip 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The men's soccer team had a dis
appointing start to the Pac-12 sea
son, dropping a tight 1-0 match in
the conference opener Friday at
San Diego State before fading
slightly in the second half of a 2-0
loss to No. 25 UCLA Sunday after
noon.
Stanford (3-6-1, 0-2 Pac-12)
started off the season in a slight
funk, struggling to find a groove on
the road against some very tough
opponents including a nationally
televised matchup at No. 1 Mary
land. But the Cardinal had won two
straight matches before hitting the
road for San Diego, and coach Bret
Simon was optimistic that the team
was beginning to hit its stride in
time for the conference season.

In the first half of Friday after
noon's game against San Diego
State (7-1-2,2-0), Stanford certainly
played well. Both teams had plenty
of scoring chances the Card took
four corners in the span of two min
utes in the first half but neither
side could break through.
It looked like Stanford might get
on the board first when junior mid
fielder Adam Jahn forced Aztec
goalie Blake Hylen to make a save
just minutes into the second half.
But instead, San Diego State found
a seam in the Cardinal defense, and
Ata Ozbay knocked a 25-yard shot
past the diving Jason Dodson for
the only goal of the game in the
52nd minute.
The Aztecs stayed on the attack
for much of the second half, control
ling the tempo and mustering up
several more scoring opportunities,
but a late surge by Stanford sent
San Diego State's defense scram
bling. Jahn hit the crossbar on a free
kick in the 85th minute, and fresh
man forward Zach Batteer had one
of his four shots on goal saved soon
after. But the equalizer never mate
rialized despite 11 second-half
shots, including six on goal.
Against UCLA (7-3-1, 2-0) on

Sunday, the Cardinal again struggled
to finish its chances, particularly early.
Stanford had the game's first four
shots senior Garrett Gunther hit
the crossbar in the 24th minute but
nothing came of it, and the teams
went to halftime scoreless.
That's when the Bruins got their
act together.
In the 53rd minute, 2010 Pac-10
Freshman of the Year Kelyn Rowe
made a nifty play to set up Ryan
Hollingshead for the go-ahead goal,
which was followed by a penalty
kick converted by UCLA's Andy
Rose after a Cardinal foul in the
box.

Dodson was forced into action
multiple times, making six saves in
the second half, and the offense
never quite got into gear before the
final whistle.
Stanford gets a bit of a reprieve
this week with just one match
they will host California on Sunday
but just eight games remain be
fore the NCAA selection commit
tee will set the NCAA Tournament
field, and the Cardinal has some
work to do in order to be one of the
32 teams selected.
