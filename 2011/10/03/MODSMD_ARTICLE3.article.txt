# CS enrollment breaks 600
## Intro computer science class 106A breaks records, dept-wide growth continues 
### KATHERINE NABEL 
Enrollment in the introductory
computer science (CS) course
CSIO6A has exceeded 660 stu
dents for autumn quarter 2011, a
record high for all courses in the
CS Department and a continua
tion of the class' enrollment
growth, which has been accelerat
ing since 2007.
Mehran Sahami B.S. '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor in
computer science and associate
chair for education in the depart
ment, is teaching CSIO6A this fall.
Sahami said the department is wel
coming this growth.
"The fall class has been grow
ing consistently, but this year it
grew more than we expected," he
said. "For us, it's pretty exciting to
have this many students going
through the program. We have
seen our introductory CSIO6 se
ries as an indicator of the number
of students who will declare a CS
major, which has also been in
creasing rapidly."
CSIO6A set a record for enroll
ment during the height of the dot
com bubble in the 1999-2000 aca
demic year, with 762 students tak
ing the class over the course of the
year. This record was nearly bro
ken in the 2009-10 school year. Sa
hami estimates that nearly 1,100
students took the class last year, in
cluding 500 during fall quarter.

This year, that fall quarter enroll
ment record has already been ex
ceeded by 30 percent and is on
track to beat the yearlong record.
Despite these growing num
bers, Sahami and other CSIO6A
professors, including Jerry Cain,
Steve Cooper and Eric Roberts,
continue to strive to accommodate
all of the students who enroll in the
course.
"It's great for more students to
actually get experience with com
puting and to get the empower
ment of working with program
ming," Sahami said. "A large num
ber of students go through the
class every year, and we want to
serve all the students who want to
take it."
This quarter, high demand for
the course may mean students
foregoing seats, even though the
class is hosted in Stanford's largest
lecture hall: Hewlett 200.
The next largest venue for the
class would be Dinkelspiel or
Memorial Auditorium.
The CS Department itself has
been expanding to accommodate
this spike in interest.
"We hired a new lecturer and
teaching faculty member last
year," Sahami said. "There is defi
nitely a need for growth within the
department. Especially for intro
ductory classes, a large undergrad
