# CS enrollment breaks 600
## Intro computer science class 106A breaks records, dept-wide growth continues 
### KATHERINE NABEL 
Enrollment in the introductory
computer science (CS) course
CSIO6A has exceeded 660 stu
dents for autumn quarter 2011, a
record high for all courses in the
CS Department and a continua
tion of the class' enrollment
growth, which has been accelerat
ing since 2007.
Mehran Sahami B.S. '92 M.S.
'93 Ph.D. '99, associate professor in
computer science and associate
chair for education in the depart
ment, is teaching CSIO6A this fall.
Sahami said the department is wel
coming this growth.
"The fall class has been grow
ing consistently, but this year it
grew more than we expected," he
said. "For us, it's pretty exciting to
have this many students going
through the program. We have
seen our introductory CSIO6 se
ries as an indicator of the number
of students who will declare a CS
major, which has also been in
creasing rapidly."
CSIO6A set a record for enroll
ment during the height of the dot
com bubble in the 1999-2000 aca
demic year, with 762 students tak
ing the class over the course of the
year. This record was nearly bro
ken in the 2009-10 school year. Sa
hami estimates that nearly 1,100
students took the class last year, in
cluding 500 during fall quarter.

This year, that fall quarter enroll
ment record has already been ex
ceeded by 30 percent and is on
track to beat the yearlong record.
Despite these growing num
bers, Sahami and other CSIO6A
professors, including Jerry Cain,
Steve Cooper and Eric Roberts,
continue to strive to accommodate
all of the students who enroll in the
course.
"It's great for more students to
actually get experience with com
puting and to get the empower
ment of working with program
ming," Sahami said. "A large num
ber of students go through the
class every year, and we want to
serve all the students who want to
take it."
This quarter, high demand for
the course may mean students
foregoing seats, even though the
class is hosted in Stanford's largest
lecture hall: Hewlett 200.
The next largest venue for the
class would be Dinkelspiel or
Memorial Auditorium.
The CS Department itself has
been expanding to accommodate
this spike in interest.
"We hired a new lecturer and
teaching faculty member last
year," Sahami said. "There is defi
nitely a need for growth within the
department. Especially for intro
ductory classes, a large undergrad
uate, section-teaching staff is key to
running the class."
Unlike most Stanford under
graduate courses, CSIO6A is taught
by professors and graduate-student
teaching assistants (TAs) as well as
undergraduate students who lead
discussion sections every week. TAs
deal mostly with logistical aspects of
the course and occasionally fill in
for lecturers when needed. Mean
while, the undergraduate section
leaders are responsible for teaching
a small section approximately 10
students and grading assign
ments and tests.
Undergraduates who are inter
ested in leading section for intro
ductory CS courses are required to
apply to the position and enroll in
CSI9B, a workshop offered by the
department intended to teach sec
tion leaders how to teach and grade.
Only students who have completed
the CSIO6 series by either taking
106 A/1068 or 106 X are eligible
to lead sections.
Section leader Tom Schmidt 'l4
says he applied to the program last
winter and has taught CSIO6A and
CSIO6B sections every quarter
since.
"I plan to stay with the CSI9B
program for as long as I'm at Stan
ford," Schmidt said. "It's a wonder
ful initiative with some very bright
people."
Schmidt also notes that the
CSI9B program is "very deeply in
tertwined with the CS Depart
ment."
"All of the 106 lecturers come to
our Monday meetings and are ex

tremely supportive and open to
feedback," he said. "We have barbe
ques from time to time, and they are
often held at professors' houses."
The CSIO6 professors seem
equally appreciative for the support
from their section leaders.
"One of the challenges is not
only recruiting students into the
teaching program, but also having
them stay in the program and teach
for multiple quarters," Sahami said.
The CSIO6A teaching staff pre
sented various theories as to why
enrollment has skyrocketed.
"The factors of economic oppor
tunity are very real," Sahami said.
"The high-tech economy is doing
very well compared to the regular
economy. There is a growing realiza
tion of the power of computing and
an element of self-empowerment.
Students can see more directly their
contribution to technology, and
they understand they have the
knowledge to use their own tools
themselves."
Schmidt said that CS is "boom
ing for a variety of reasons," includ
ing the rapid expansion of the Sili
con Valley and the flood of job op
portunities that await Bay Area
programmers.
"It seems like computer science
is sexy again," Schmidt said. "Start
up life has been glorified in the
media, and stories like Facebook's
scrappy dorm-room beginnings or
Apple's huge comeback have a cer
tain appeal for people. It has been
said before, but I would agree that
'The Social Network' and similar
pieces of media brought program
ming and 'hacking' back into the
limelight and infused them with
a bit of sex appeal."
