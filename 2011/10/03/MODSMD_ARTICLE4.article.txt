## Kirkland& Ellis donates $2.75M to law school 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
The Kirkland & Ellis Law Firm
pledged $2.75 million to the Stan
ford Law School over the next five
years through several initiatives
funded by the firm, as well as by
matching gifts from its partners.
The pledge will fund "expanded
clinical programs, new student
awards and a series of panels and
symposia on the legal profession,"
according to an article by The Na
tional Law Journal.
"This generous support from
Kirkland & Ellis will enable Stan
ford Law School to continue to
transform legal education and pre
pare the next generation of leaders
through innovative, interdisciplinary
and international programs, new and
expanded forms of clinical educa
tion and a renewed commitment to
public service," said Dean of Stan
ford Law School Larry Kramer in
the article.
The donation will establish the
Kirkland & Ellis Scholars Program,
acknowledging the six top-perform
ing first-year law students each year.
It replaces the coif designation, elim
inated in 2008 when the school
stopped awarding letter grades. The
program awards performance across
the board, unlike book awards which
reward individual course mastery.
The Law School will also estab
lish the Kirkland & Ellis Law Forum,
which will feature discussions about
issues in law affecting the business
community, with panelists coming
from academia and the firm.
"The opportunity to recognize
student excellence and to provide a
forum for sharing thought leader
ship on emerging matters that may
challenge and reshape the business
and law community fits well with
Kirkland & Ellis' culture and mis
sion," said Jeffrey Hammes, chair
man of the firm's global manage
ment executive committee, told The
National Law Journal.
