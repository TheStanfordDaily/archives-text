## STANFORD ROLLS OVER UCLA AT HOME 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In another dominant perform
ance, the Stanford football team
stayed undefeated on the season
and extended the nation's longest
winning streak to 12 games dat
ing back to last season by top
ping Pac-12 foe UCLA 45-19 on
Saturday night.

On the Cardinal's first drive of

junior halfback Tyler Gaffney, who
then flipped the ball back to junior
wide receiver Drew Terrell, who
wound up and fired a high pass to
Luck, who snagged the ball with his
right hand and tapped his left foot
inbounds in perfect succession for

a 13-yard completion.
"I just hoped I had a foot in
bounds, I'm sure it was incomplete
on the next level," Luck said after
ward, referring to the NFL's two
foot rule.
"There's about five positions
the guy could play receiver,
tight end, outside linebacker," said
head coach David Shaw. "We just
put him in position to make plays,
and he never disappoints."
Luck certainly did not disap
point on Saturday, playing his regu
lar position flawlessly as well. The
Heisman candidate completed 23
