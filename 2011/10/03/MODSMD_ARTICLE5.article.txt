# BRUINS BASHED
## STANFORD ROLLS OVER UCLA AT HOME 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In another dominant perform
ance, the Stanford football team
stayed undefeated on the season
and extended the nation's longest
winning streak to 12 games dat
ing back to last season by top
ping Pac-12 foe UCLA 45-19 on
Saturday night.
In front of just the fifth sellout
crowd since the new Stanford Sta
dium opened in 2006, the No. 7
Cardinal (4-0,2-0 Pac-12) had little
trouble pushing its way past the
struggling Bruins (2-3, 1-1), but
that isn't to say there wasn't excite

ment and intrigue like star
quarterback Andrew Luck split
ting wide out to snag a pass.

On the Cardinal's first drive of
the night. Luck tossed the ball to
junior halfback Tyler Gaffney, who
then flipped the ball back to junior
wide receiver Drew Terrell, who
wound up and fired a high pass to
Luck, who snagged the ball with his
right hand and tapped his left foot
inbounds in perfect succession for

a 13-yard completion.
"I just hoped I had a foot in
bounds, I'm sure it was incomplete
on the next level," Luck said after
ward, referring to the NFL's two
foot rule.
"There's about five positions
the guy could play receiver,
tight end, outside linebacker," said
head coach David Shaw. "We just
put him in position to make plays,
and he never disappoints."
Luck certainly did not disap
point on Saturday, playing his regu
lar position flawlessly as well. The

of 27 passes for 227 yards and three
touchdowns, mostly capitalizing on
short passes that kept the Cardinal
offense on the field for over 34 min
utes of game time.
Luck's spectacular performance
with passing and receiving overshad
owed the Cardinal defense on Satur
day night, which (for the most part)
didn't miss a beat despite the loss of
junior linebacker Shayne Skov.
The Cardinal defense did give up
season highs in rushing yards allowed,
total yards allowed and points allowed,
but that was mostly due to Stanford's
defense setting the bar very high in the
first three games of the season. After
only allowing 36 yards per game
through the first three matchups,
UCLA's Johnathan Franklin took 12
carries for 96 yards to help the Bruin
offense to 141 yards on the ground, but
that didn't mean the defense was left in
a panic after the game.
"We stood up a lot of times when
we needed to, but we definitely left a
lot of plays on the field," said senior
safety Michael Thomas. "Guys were
doing their jobs, but we just weren't
finishing plays. So that's just some
thing we have to work on."
"[UCLA] ran the ball a lot, and
with all the misdirection in the of
fense, it blurs your vision for a sec
ond," Shaw said. "I think our guys did
a decent job of containing it, but
[UCLA] still popped out a couple of
long runs."
Thomas also complemented jun
ior Jarek Lancaster and sophomore
AJ Tarpley (who combined for 10

tackles) for their efforts stepping up
to fill in for the injured Skov at inside
linebacker.
"I'm proud of those guys. They
did their job, and they played a hell of
a game," Thomas said.
Stanford's defense set up the of
fense for success right from the start
by stuffing the Bruins' first drive of
the night on the Cardinal one-yard
line, a start that Shaw said helped ig
nite the team on both sides of the
ball.
"It was huge," he said. "When it
happened, for a split second I flashed
back to my time in Baltimore, and
[Ravens linebacker] Ray Lewis used
to always say, 'Opportunity for great
ness. When the ball's on the one-yard
line, it's an opportunity for greatness.'
And the guys stepped up to the chal
lenge and did a great job."
The Cardinal then pounded out a
16-play, eight-minute, 99-yard drive
highlighted not only by Luck's but
also by tight end Coby Fleener's one
handed touchdown catch.
"I knew Andrew was trying to
make me look bad with his one
handed catch," Fleener cracked after
the game. "So I felt like I had to one
up him."
The Cardinal kept that pace up
for the rest of the game, as Luck and
junior running back Stepfan Taylor,
who rushed for 112 yards and two
touchdowns, kept the offense per
fectly in balance to combine for 442
total yards, including 202 on the
ground.
Stanford used all of its consider

able offensive firepower to score on
its first four drives of the night before
finally being forced to punt for the
first time in the third quarter. Luck
and company authored five scoring
drives of 59 yards or more when all
was said and done.
Shaw said that he was pleased
with his offense's effort and particu
larly with his quarterback, who drove
a new, speedy, no-huddle offense at
several points during the game.

"[The no-huddle offense] is really
something we worked on the entire
offseason, and this was the game that
we were going to start doing it," Shaw
said. "We just put the formation out
there and let Andrew call the play.
It's not coming from the sideline, it's
coming from him on the field. When
we're in the no-huddle, he's calling
the plays."
And despite his new receiver's
highlight-reel catch, Shaw didn't

foresee going back to Luck to catch
any more passes this season. "We
won't come back to it again this
year," he said. "We kind of like what
he does at quarterback."
The Cardinal will return home
this weekend for another Pac-12
matchup against the Colorado Buf
faloes at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 8.

to always say, 'Opportunity for great
ness. When the ball's on the one-yard
line, it's an opportunity for greatness.'
And the guys stepped up to the chal
lenge and did a great job."
The Cardinal then pounded out a
16-play, eight-minute, 99-yard drive
highlighted not only by Luck's but
also by tight end Coby Fleener's one
handed touchdown catch.
"I knew Andrew was trying to
make me look bad with his one
handed catch," Fleener cracked after
the game. "So I felt like I had to one
up him."
The Cardinal kept that pace up
for the rest of the game, as Luck and
junior running back Stepfan Taylor,
who rushed for 112 yards and two
touchdowns, kept the offense per
fectly in balance to combine for 442
total yards, including 202 on the
ground.
Stanford used all of its consider

able offensive firepower to score on
its first four drives of the night before
finally being forced to punt for the
first time in the third quarter. Luck
and company authored five scoring
drives of 59 yards or more when all
was said and done.
Shaw said that he was pleased
with his offense's effort and particu
larly with his quarterback, who drove
a new, speedy, no-huddle offense at
several points during the game.

"[The no-huddle offense] is really
something we worked on the entire
offseason, and this was the game that
we were going to start doing it," Shaw
said. "We just put the formation out
there and let Andrew call the play.
It's not coming from the sideline, it's
coming from him on the field. When
we're in the no-huddle, he's calling
the plays."
And despite his new receiver's
highlight-reel catch, Shaw didn't

foresee going back to Luck to catch
any more passes this season. "We
won't come back to it again this
year," he said. "We kind of like what
he does at quarterback."
The Cardinal will return home
this weekend for another Pac-12
matchup against the Colorado Buf
faloes at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 8.

Andrew Luck (holding ball) showed poise in the pocket against the Bruins. Luck threw for 227 yards and three touchdowns
and snagged a 13-yard pass with an acrobatic one-handed catch. The redshirt junior quarterback called
his own plays from the line for the first time this season, as the Cardinal rolled up 442 yards of total offense.
In another dominant perform

and extended the nation's longest
winning streak to 12 games dat

ping Pac-12 foe UCLA 45-19 on
Saturday night.
In front of just the fifth sellout
crowd since the new Stanford Sta
dium opened in 2006, the No. 7
Cardinal (4-0,2-0 Pac-12) had little
trouble pushing its way past the
struggling Bruins (2-3, 1-1), but
that isn't to say there wasn't excite

ment and intrigue like star
quarterback Andrew Luck split
ting wide out to snag a pass.

On the Cardinal's first drive of
the night. Luck tossed the ball to
junior halfback Tyler Gaffney, who
then flipped the ball back to junior
wide receiver Drew Terrell, who
wound up and fired a high pass to
Luck, who snagged the ball with his
right hand and tapped his left foot
inbounds in perfect succession for

a 13-yard completion.
"I just hoped I had a foot in
bounds, I'm sure it was incomplete
on the next level," Luck said after
ward, referring to the NFL's two
foot rule.
"There's about five positions
the guy could play receiver,
tight end, outside linebacker," said
head coach David Shaw. "We just
put him in position to make plays,
and he never disappoints."
Luck certainly did not disap

of 27 passes for 227 yards and three
touchdowns, mostly capitalizing on
short passes that kept the Cardinal
offense on the field for over 34 min
utes of game time.
Luck's spectacular performance
with passing and receiving overshad
owed the Cardinal defense on Satur
day night, which (for the most part)
didn't miss a beat despite the loss of
junior linebacker Shayne Skov.
The Cardinal defense did give up
season highs in rushing yards allowed,
total yards allowed and points allowed,
but that was mostly due to Stanford's
defense setting the bar very high in the
first three games of the season. After
only allowing 36 yards per game
through the first three matchups,
UCLA's Johnathan Franklin took 12
carries for 96 yards to help the Bruin
offense to 141 yards on the ground, but
that didn't mean the defense was left in
a panic after the game.
"We stood up a lot of times when
we needed to, but we definitely left a
lot of plays on the field," said senior
safety Michael Thomas. "Guys were
doing their jobs, but we just weren't
finishing plays. So that's just some
thing we have to work on."
"[UCLA] ran the ball a lot, and
with all the misdirection in the of
fense, it blurs your vision for a sec
ond," Shaw said. "I think our guys did
a decent job of containing it, but
[UCLA] still popped out a couple of
long runs."
Thomas also complemented jun
ior Jarek Lancaster and sophomore
AJ Tarpley (who combined for 10

tackles) for their efforts stepping up
to fill in for the injured Skov at inside
linebacker.
"I'm proud of those guys. They
did their job, and they played a hell of
a game," Thomas said.
Stanford's defense set up the of
fense for success right from the start
by stuffing the Bruins' first drive of
the night on the Cardinal one-yard
line, a start that Shaw said helped ig
nite the team on both sides of the
ball.
"It was huge," he said. "When it
happened, for a split second I flashed
back to my time in Baltimore, and
[Ravens linebacker] Ray Lewis used
to always say, 'Opportunity for great
ness. When the ball's on the one-yard
line, it's an opportunity for greatness.'
