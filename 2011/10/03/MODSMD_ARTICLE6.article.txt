## Living-wage line sales'as expected' Alta Gracia clothing line performs well at bookstore 
### ELLORA ISRANI DESK EDITOR 
The Alta Gracia clothing brand,
a "living-wage" line launched at the
Stanford Bookstore last Septem
ber, has performed "as expected,"
according to bookstore director
Janet Gawley.
Alta Gracia is a subdivision of
the Knights Apparel, Inc., which
sources its clothing from the "La
Altagracia" province of the Do
minican Republic. The brand pays
all of its workers a "living wage"
approximately three times the
country's minimum wage which
covers "adequate food, clean water,
clothing, shelter, health care, child
care and education for themselves
and their families," according to the
company's website.
According to Alta Gracia Com
mmunity Education Coordinator
Rachel Taber, the brand is perform
ing well this year. It launched in 250
bookstores and is already carried in
400.
"[We've had] a ton of student
support nationally, tons of local
newspapers have covered it and a
lot of students have engaged their
communities in it, teaching about it
in their classes," she said. "It's total
ly unsolicited, a lot of it. At inde
pendent bookstores alone it more
than tripled last year, which is a di
rect result of students going in and
asking their bookstores to carry it
more."
For example, Taber noted, New
York University's $200,000 order
of Alta Gracia apparel sold out
within two weeks thanks to in
store promotions.
"Wherever students have really
spoken up and vocalized that they
want Alta Gracia to come to their
campus, we've seen a lot of very
good improvements," Taber said.
Students on campus have
shown substantial support for Alta
Gracia, with student groups such
as the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) promoting the
brand on campus.
The bookstore has also done its
share of in-store and online pro
motion.
"We promote Alta Gracia
through in-store posters and our
website," Gawley wrote in an
email to The Daily. "When a cus
tomer selects the apparel section
of our website Alta Gracia is
the first option available to them
on the drop-down menu. No other
vendor is listed within the apparel
drop-down menu."
Gawley called the price of Alta
Gracia clothing "comparable" to

other brands at the bookstore. For
example, a basic short-sleeve t
shirt at the bookstore starts
around $l3. An Alta Gracia t-shirt
is $lB.
Follett Corporation, which runs
bookstores across the country, in
cluding at Stanford, doubled its
order from Alta Gracia in the last
year,Taber said.
She also highlighted support
from "progressive" and "business
oriented" groups across the coun
try, among them the microfinance
organization Campus Kiva, the
United States Student Organiza
tion, United Students Against
Sweatshops and various Domini
can student groups.
"It's really been a process
across a spectrum," she said.
Gawley said the Stanford
Bookstore will continue to carry
the brand given a positive con
sumer reception.
"Its products are of high quali
ty, and the message they convey to
the consumer is a positive one,"
Gawley said. "We have seen steady
sales of this merchandise, and I
would expect that trend to contin
ue."
"We will continue to purchase
apparel from Alta Gracia and
bring in new product as it is avail
able," she continued. "We are very
proud to be able to bring this prod
uct to the Stanford community."
