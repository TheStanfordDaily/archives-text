## Cardinal Clinics care for the community 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU 
Srcphanie Liou 'l3 began volunteering
at a Cardinal Free Clinic as away to
convince her mother that she wasn't
cut out for the medical field, but soon
realized that she was wrong. Within a
few months, Liou had found her calling.
Organized by the Stanford School of Medi
cine, the Cardinal Free Clinics provide free and
immediate health care to low-income adults
who would otherwise not be able to receive it.
The Pacific Free Clinic, founded in 2003, was
created in response to the success of the
Arbor Free Clinic, founded in 1990. Both
clinics also give aspiring health care and
public service students a chance to inter
act directly with underinsured patients
t and learn from physicians.

| sional, now volunteers at the Pacific
/. Free Clinic on a regular basis.
/ "Through volunteering at a clinic, I
realized that there is absolutely nothing
else I would rather do with my life," Liou
/ said. "We believe that everyone has the right
to quality medical care and that there is noth
ing more meaningful than learning through
hands-on experience and serving others."
Free services at the clinic range from health
screenings and medications to specialty care
and health education. Students, including un
dergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral
scholars, are largely responsible for running the
services. Through the effort and commitment
of these students, the clinics are able to reach
out to underserved adults in several locales, in
cluding San Jose and the South Bay.
"Our volunteers understand the very real
need for high-quality health care for low-income
patients," said David Purger, a second-year med
ical student and manager of the Pacific Free
Clinic. "It is wonderful to see new volunteers ma
ture in their roles at the clinic and realize that

their work, whether that means checking in pa
tients at the front desk in the morning, drawing
blood for lab tests or counseling on diet and ex
ercise, can and often does mean the difference
between sickness and health for our patients."
Due to limited funding, the clinics operate
only one day a week, but most of their success
takes place outside open hours. And in the face
of scant supplies, both clinics try to deliver
more comprehensive patient care.
"We are fortunate to have grants, but that
said, we are still a free clinic," said Amrapali
Maitra, a medical student and manager of the
Arbor Free Clinic. "We generally strive to pro
vide immediate care of acute conditions, but we
also look toward the larger goal of overall,
long-term health improvement and to ensure
access for our patients to primary-care homes
or referrals if needed."
Although the program is relatively small
Free Clinics has left an undeniable impact on
the lives of both the patients and the volun
teers, including to students like Liou.
Liou says she continues to be humbled by
the gratefulness and optimism of her patients,
including one woman who had not seen a doc
tor in more than six years before she stepped
into the Pacific Free Clinic.
"I will never forget one patient who had to
wait over half an hour for a blood test due to an
unfortunate paperwork error on our part,"
Liou said. "Instead of complaining or express
ing any impatience, she smiled. In the Stanford
bubble, it can be so easy to get caught up in the
little stressors poor performance on a
midterm, pulling an all-nighter to finish a
paper, getting rejected from an internship
but the clinic is where I go to remind myself of
the more important things in life."
