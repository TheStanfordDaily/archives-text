## EDITORIAL Eliminate need-aware admissions for internationals 
### 
Early October. For us it's a
time of sunny weather,
Stanford football and the
promise of a new year. For high
school seniors around the world,
though, it's a time to start the
stressful college application
process. In recent years, Stanford
has alleviated much of the finan
cial stress inherent in the process
by increasing the breadth of its fi
nancial aid program. But despite
these gains, international appli
cants with financial need still face
discrimination in the admissions
process. While Stanford is need
blind for domestic applicants, in
ternational admissions is need
aware, meaning an international
applicant's financial status is fac
tored into his admissions decision.
Last year, The Daily's Editorial
Board criticized this practice pri
marily on the issue of fairness; it is
not fair to deny admission to qual
ified international applicants
solely because of their financial
status. But this Board recognizes
that other concerns may trump
this ideal. In admissions, what it
often comes down to is benefits
versus costs to the University as a
whole. Accordingly, in examining
the merits of a need-blind policy
for internationals, we must ask
how said policy would benefit the
University.
In this case, the benefits are
clear. Under the current need
aware system, qualified applicants
who would otherwise be accepted
are instead denied admission. Stan
ford thus misses out on their aca
demic and extracurricular talent,
instead having to settle for less
qualified applicants who can afford
the tuition. Furthermore, the need
aware policy discourages many in
ternationals from applying to begin
with. Stanford has developed a rep
utation for not accepting interna
tionals with significant financial
needs. Whether this reputation is
deserved or not is beside the point.
The reality is that Stanford loses in
ternational applicants to its need
blind peer schools Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, MIT, Dartmouth
and Amherst. Although Stanford
does admit exceptionally qualified
international applicants in spite of
financial need, it cannot admit

those who do not apply. In short,
continuation of the need-aware
policy results in a less qualified ap
plicant pool and a less qualified stu
dent body.
The need-aware policy also de
tracts from diversity on campus.
With the current policy, students
primarily interact with wealthy in
ternationals. Often these students
have relatively Western perspec
tives; many attended international
schools, others travelled extensive
ly, some have spent considerable
time in the United States. Al
though wealthy international stu
dents do bring valuable perspec
tives to campus, there are more
voices to be heard. In an increas
ingly globalized age, it is important
for all students to encounter peers
with upbringings radically differ
ent than their own. Many students
have some conception of what it
means to be poor in America. But
how many have an idea of what it's
like to grow up in a rural Chinese
village or a lower class area of
Mumbai? This University is com
mitted to the notion of education
outside the classroom, and as such
puts great effort into creating a stu
dent body populated with mem
bers from a variety of socioeco
nomic backgrounds. This effort
should not stop at the U.S. border.
Of course, there is always the
cost of accepting more students
with financial need. A need-blind
policy for internationals would
likely require a 10-percent in
crease in the financial aid budget.
But with Stanford's multi-billion
dollar endowment, it is more a
question of willpower and priori
tizing than resources. Princeton
University, for instance, was able to
institute a need-blind policy de
spite enrolling more international
students than Stanford, even while
having only a slightly larger en
dowment.

As it stands, there are no imme
diate plans to change the current
need-aware policy for internation
als. That must change. A need
blind policy would result in a more
diverse and talented student body,
and it would confirm the Universi
ty's ideal of providing access to stu
dents who deserve admission, re
gardless of background.
