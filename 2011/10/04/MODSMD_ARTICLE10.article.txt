# Stanford researchers map pain

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
Stanford University School of Med
icine researchers used heat probes and
functional magnetic resonance imag
ing scans (fMRIs), which take a series
of pictures showing brain activity, to
map mild pain in a September study.
The researchers in the Stanford Divi
sion of Pain Management used com
puter algorithms to model pain inflict
ed by heat probes on the subjects' arms.
To the relief of the many who experi
ence chronic pain, the researchers hope
to apply the same method to map and
measure that disorder.
Chronic pain, often the result,
months or years later, of a more serious
injury, can cause extreme torment for
those who experience it.
Sean Mackey, Chief of the Stanford
Pain Management Center and co-au
thor of the study, stresses the impor
tance of validation of pain. Pain, he says,
is a neurophysiologic phenomenon.
Yet patients may still feel that physi
cians, caregivers or family members do
not believe them, adding value to
Mackey's research as validation that
chronic pain exists. The research aims
ultimately to provide a diagnostic tool
to challenge the gold standard of self
reporting pain. Advances in neu
roimaging could also address problems
faced when patients are unable to com
municate their pain.
Much remains that doctors do not
know about chronic pain, which can
often lead to difficulties in treatment,
which frequently falls short of the pa
tient's needs.
The study used a computer algo
rithm invented in 1995.The researchers
asked a computer to predict when sub
jects were feeling pain. The system was
accurate 81 percent of the time.
