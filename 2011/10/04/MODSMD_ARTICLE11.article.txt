## Bringing clarity to the budget crisis CACS seeks to explain the numbers 
### SUZANNE STATHATOS DESK EDITOR 
After a week of school, Stan
ford students are already
buzzing around campus
with problem sets in hand,
essays to write and meetings
to schedule. Within the Stanford bub
ble, all students are able to solve prob
lems— but a Stanford student group
and nonprofit organization called Cali
fornia Common Sense (CACS) has
taken that problem solving to the next
level. These students hope to tackle one
of the largest problems in California's
history: the budget crisis.
CACS is a team of Stanford students
and alumni working to identify where
California allocates its money, to in
form the public of where the money is
going and to find a policy solution to
address government inefficiencies. It
uses Stanford analytics and Silicon Val
ley technology to help people grasp the
structures of state and local budgets.
Started in 2010 by Matt Cook 'll
and Joe Lonsdale 'O3, CACS has blos
somed from just an idea into a full
fledged nonprofit organization.
Cook and Lonsdale were "con
cerned that the California government
wasn't working well," said CACS exec
utive director Dakin Sloss 'l2. "Most
people only got concerned; they don't
know where to go after that ... we
have an engagement program to help
people take action."
"Our group isn't about politics or
philosophy," Cook said. "It's about
showing people the numbers, and using
an engineering approach to reveal -
and fix inefficiencies in order to get
our state back on track."
But how do they necessarily do
that? It began as a research think tank.
A group of students wanted to know
"what was actually going wrong in the
California government, what depart
ments were doing what, if they were
doing what they were supposed to do,"
said CACS research analyst Druthi
Ghanta 'l4. "If they weren't, the ques
tion of 'do we even need them any
more' arose."
CACS dug deep to collect data on all
of California's government entities.
They read fiscal reports, contacted gov
ernment officials and checked for re
dundancies in the reports of state or
ganizations.
Ghanta said the process took
months.

Once they collected all of the data,
CACS put it into a suite of tools de
signed to sift through and clarify budg
etary information, called the "data
transparency portal."
"Realizing that the first step in solv
ing a problem is understanding it, we
created the 'California org chart' and
other 'transparency tools' to make Cal
ifornia's institutional problems obvious
to citizens and to empower people to
solve them," Cook said.
"We're trying to get people to actu
ally care about what's going on in the
government, instead of being apathet
ic," Ghanta said.
CACS has already gained the atten-

tion of elected officials at the state and
federal level. They have worked to pre
pare spending analyses for U.S. Con
gressman Eric Cantor, Atlanta Mayor
Kasim Reed and the state of Georgia.
As executive director of the organi
zation, Sloss has weekly meetings and
telephone conferences with elected of
ficials. Other U.S. congressmen have
also expressed interest in working with
CACS.
While the portal is already in place
and the website is running smoothly,
the group still has a lot of work ahead of
it. They aspire to spread across Califor
nia and eventually across the nation
primarily through other collegiate or-

ganizations.
"We want to get millions of Californi
ans online, discussing and understanding
the issues at hand," Sloss said. "What we
need to do is give everyone a voice so we
can have an effective democracy," one
without the "inherent flaw where corpo
rations, unions and special interest
groups buy off elected officials."
Whether it ultimately reaches its
goals or not, California Common Sense
seems to have the Stanford mentality
behind it it dreams big and shoots
for the moon.
