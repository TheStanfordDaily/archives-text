# NOTES FROM ABROAD
## A
						reintroduction to Oxford 
### â€” Kevin Bretthauer 
It would be far too cliche to describe
returning to Oxford as if it were like
arriving at Hogwarts, but there is
something truly magical about this
place. As I stepped off the bus on
Queen's Lane, it was impossible not to no
tice how the medieval colleges and cobble
stone streets appeared ancient and alien
when compared to Stanford's red tile and
palm trees.
Although the city of Oxford bursts
with centuries-old stone buildings, it does
not carry the stale decay or obsolete nov
elty of most museum pieces. The charm of

Oxford is the blend of ancient with mod
em. The college halls that once sheltered
politicians, scientists and thinkers still res
onate in the minds of our English peers.
Thatched-roofed and stone-floored pubs
echo with energetic laughter and the
sounds of Kesha. Underneath their exte
riors, the buildings that make up Oxford
are as excited and as alive as Stanford,
with an added hint of mystery and majesty.
Retuning to Oxford is a whole new ex
perience. I uncover and appreciate details
that were hidden in the freshness of my pre
vious experience. Being here again has

taught me that it is impossible not to find
something endearing about the "City of
Dreaming Spires." After landing, getting
setded and battling jet lag, I chose to go on
a run. My run was Oxford's best welcome
gift. As the sun rose, the ancient stone dor
mitories and Magdalen Tower were silhou
etted against the mist and rugby fields.
While I stared at that scene, the fatigue,
hunger and chill of the English morning
began to fade, and I knew that I was truly
lucky to return to the land of stone and
magic.
