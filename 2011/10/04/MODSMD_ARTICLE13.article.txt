# OPINIONS
## THE
						YOUNG ADULT SECTION The
						value of division 
### Nina Chung 
I used to assume that beliefs were
not optional. In other words, I
thought that we fell into our be
liefs the way we were born into our
families or our bodies it wasn't
up to us. I remember being asked as
a child, "If you've never been to
China, how do you know it's
there?" Obviously, the answer was,
"[Shrug] I dunno." It didn't matter,
really. Tire other, less obvious an
swer was, "Because everyone
knows China exists, it's not possible
not to." Unfortunately, China's cur
rent status makes this harmless ex
ample completely ludicrous. But
it's the best illustration I have of
how, back in the day, what we be
lieved seemed more a matter of
course than a life-altering choice.

Our beliefs aren't so innocuous
anymore. They're now bigger; they
have bigger words and they have
bigger scope. We carry them with us
but follow them to their conse
quences. They're one of the few
personal characteristics that divide
us with our consent. Even those
who don't regularly self-reflect will
face the result of conflicting ideas
a supposedly inexplicable
break-up, maybe, or the frustrating
distancing of a friend. After the
"hello" and "what's up," what we
choose to believe for ourselves is
what determines the potential of
our relationships.

1 went to lunch with an old friend
last week the terms "old" and
"friend" used uncertainly because
it's only been three years in college,
and because a past confrontation
significantly crippled our friend
ship. But it was definitely lunch, last
week. Actually, I had been thinking
about him a lot the past several
months, which was itself alarming
and exciting. I wondered incessant
ly if he was still as I remembered, or
if I would remember correctly.
More prominent, though, were the
questions 1 asked myself: after ac
cepting God as a Christian believer,
how did I consider returning to a
point in our relationship that we
had left off from, in light of his own
particular way of life?
1 got into his car and was laugh
ing hysterically almost as soon as 1
did. It was like a homecoming or
childhood scent â€”we were com
fortable immediately. In fact, we
felt exactly the way we used to.
Like with our closest friends,
"catching up," even two years'
worth, wasn't an obstacle but a nat
ural step in conversation, which
rambled on like the most natural
thing in the world. I came close to
mentally regretting that I had class
to return to later.

But along with the bill arrived

the real conclusion. We were talk
ing about major realizations, prior
ities and goals, and our stark dif
ferences came into sharp relief.
Our words became somber be
cause they were more blatantly
significant. In summary, we had
each grown a lot, but unimagin
ably differently. We had chosen al
most perfectly opposite views of
the world that were completely in
compatible with each other. It was
such a clear moment, like in the
movies. It was really difficult to
register exactly where our rela
tionship stood, why it was there
and by what it was constricted. Yet
I knew it was inevitable, because
my faith is . . . not actually com
promising in the least. I knew it
was coming even before, but de
nial is persistent.

People call it "having things in
common" or "wanting the same
things in life," easy phrases carved
from a truth: we share more of our
selves with those who share our
deepest beliefs. There's a vacuum
when we don't, and both the most
successful relationships and di
vorces around us say so equally.
Then again, this applies only for
those who choose to stand by their
values, and that's not necessarily
everyone. After all, it's easy to
avoid tension when you're flirting
over a cup of coffee. It's easy to
sleep in denial to sustain a one
night stand.

Of course, people connect in
these most casual of encounters,
and our lives are filled with ac
quaintances that teach us and laugh
with us and flit in and out of our call
logs. But past a certain point in
every relationship, our beliefs
about who we are, about what
we're here for steal the spot
light. They are the ultimate bonding
material, and thus the most divisive,
for any connection worth keeping.
And if that is the case, we should
make sure that when we hit a wall
in a relationship, we are doing so in
the name of something that we
choose, that is good, that is right.
Otherwise, the sacrifice would be
completely meaningless.

One connection that would not be
meaningless would be an email to
Nina at ninamc@stanford.edu. It
won't be a leap of faith, she promises!
