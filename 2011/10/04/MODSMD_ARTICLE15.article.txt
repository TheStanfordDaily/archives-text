# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## What I miss most... 
### Camira Powell 
In the past two months that I've
spent in the nation's capital at
tending another school (all
thanks to our little-known Diversity
Exchange program), every once in a
while I've caught myself thinking,
"Man, I miss Stanford."
It happened the first time when I
was caught in a thunderstorm wear
ing a sheer summer dress and flip
flops. It happened again when I re
alized that classes not only start in
August, but they keep going all the
way to December. But every single
time I see the door to my room, this
same thought never fails to come to
mind. It's not because my room isn't
decent (it's very Mirrielees-esque)
or because I dislike my roommate
(nope, she's as cool as I am), but be
cause there's something missing.
Something I never appreciated
since it is übiquitous at Stanford.
Honestly, what I miss most are
name tags.

I can still remember hearing the
screams of "Welcome to Stanford!"
when I arrived at Wilbur for the first
time. As I walked through the halls
looking for my room, every door
had bright yellow "Submaßinc"
name tags pasted on it, announcing
to every passerby the name and
hometown of whoever inhabited
the room. Of course, we weren't the
only ones who went all-out. Across
the entire campus, almost every
dorm room door has something on
it acknowledging the presence of
life inside based on whatever clever
theme was chosen for that year.
Back then I never cared about
those overly decorated pieces of
paper. They were convenient during
rollouts or for Facebook-stalking
purposes, but overall they seemed
kind of pointless. Who really needs
to know their neighbor's favorite
ice cream flavor or what bedtime
story they loved as a toddler?
Nevertheless, when I arrived at
Howard, I was mildly disappointed
when I found my room sans
nametag. I wasn't expecting the
same kind of fanfare surrounding
dorm decorations, but at least some
thing. On move-in day, the only
"Welcome to Howard" indication
was a couple of blue and white bal

loons tied to a kiosk outside. As
time passes, seeing the endless rows
of uniformly undecorated doors
still makes me a little sad.

Remembering all the decked out
doors at Stanford, it's amazing how
such a seemingly innocuous object
can help create a sense of communi
ty so quickly. Whether they're well
made or not, they do help bind a
dorm together. And it's weird not to
know my neighbors' names. Of
course, I could do the old-fashioned
thing of knocking on their door or
asking them during the umpteenth
time I see them in the hall, but that's
a lot of effort.

This past Sunday, I volunteered
at Stanford's District of Columbia
regional admissions info session
that featured young alumni talking
about their experience as students.
When they played a video about
"Discovering Stanford," it had me
ready to reapply just so I could live
out all the amazing moments they
recorded. The video was so persua
sive that it made the first floor of
Meyer Library look good (but when
the admissions rep mentioned the
7.1 percent admit rate, I was like,
"Thank God I already got in.") Fol
lowing the video, I listened as one
panelist described the different
characters he met in his dorm, while
another commented on the great
network of classmates and other
alumni that he has met since leaving
Stanford. After the aspiring
ProFros had disappeared at the end
of the session, I saw the instant ca
maraderie among the alumni.
Though a few of them were already
friends, most of them were meeting
for the first time and they were able
to bond over shared experiences.
("You lived in Toyon? I lived in
Toyon! You threw up behind the
dumpster on the Row? So did I!")
Stanford cultivates an atmos
phere where sharing equals caring
share your name, share your
story, share your life and I can't
help but wonder how much those
little name tags helped in that
process. It's at moments like this
when I realize that even when I am
away from the Farm, I still take it
with me wherever I go.

Don't get me wrong. I'm enjoy
ing my time at Howard, and I'm
coming back with a little Bison in
my blood. Yet this time away has
taught me a thing or two, and I feel
that it's my "Cardinal duty" to pass
the info along. So if nothing else,
don't take nametags for granted.
Learn your neighbor's name and
their favorite flavor of ice cream. I
know I will.

Even if it means making my own
name tag, and everyone else's too.

You already know Camira's name, so
why not email her at camirap@stan

hometown of whoever inhabited
the room. Of course, we weren't the
only ones who went all-out. Across
the entire campus, almost every
dorm room door has something on
it acknowledging the presence of
life inside based on whatever clever
theme was chosen for that year.
Back then I never cared about
those overly decorated pieces of
paper. They were convenient during
rollouts or for Facebook-stalking
purposes, but overall they seemed
kind of pointless. Who really needs
to know their neighbor's favorite
ice cream flavor or what bedtime
story they loved as a toddler?
Nevertheless, when I arrived at
Howard, I was mildly disappointed
when I found my room sans
nametag. I wasn't expecting the
same kind of fanfare surrounding
dorm decorations, but at least some
thing. On move-in day, the only
"Welcome to Howard" indication
was a couple of blue and white bal

loons tied to a kiosk outside. As
time passes, seeing the endless rows
of uniformly undecorated doors
still makes me a little sad.

Remembering all the decked out
doors at Stanford, it's amazing how
such a seemingly innocuous object
can help create a sense of communi
ty so quickly. Whether they're well
made or not, they do help bind a
dorm together. And it's weird not to
know my neighbors' names. Of
course, I could do the old-fashioned
thing of knocking on their door or
asking them during the umpteenth
time I see them in the hall, but that's
a lot of effort.

This past Sunday, I volunteered
at Stanford's District of Columbia
regional admissions info session
that featured young alumni talking
about their experience as students.
When they played a video about
"Discovering Stanford," it had me
ready to reapply just so I could live
out all the amazing moments they
recorded. The video was so persua
sive that it made the first floor of
Meyer Library look good (but when
the admissions rep mentioned the
7.1 percent admit rate, I was like,
"Thank God I already got in.") Fol
lowing the video, I listened as one
panelist described the different
characters he met in his dorm, while
another commented on the great
network of classmates and other
alumni that he has met since leaving
Stanford. After the aspiring
ProFros had disappeared at the end
of the session, I saw the instant ca
maraderie among the alumni.
Though a few of them were already
friends, most of them were meeting
for the first time and they were able
to bond over shared experiences.
("You lived in Toyon? I lived in
Toyon! You threw up behind the
dumpster on the Row? So did I!")
Stanford cultivates an atmos
phere where sharing equals caring
share your name, share your
story, share your life and I can't
help but wonder how much those
little name tags helped in that
process. It's at moments like this
when I realize that even when I am
away from the Farm, I still take it
with me wherever I go.

Don't get me wrong. I'm enjoy
ing my time at Howard, and I'm
coming back with a little Bison in
my blood. Yet this time away has
taught me a thing or two, and I feel
that it's my "Cardinal duty" to pass
the info along. So if nothing else,
don't take nametags for granted.
Learn your neighbor's name and
their favorite flavor of ice cream. I
know I will.

Even if it means making my own
name tag, and everyone else's too.

You already know Camira's name, so
why not email her at camirap@stan
ford.edu?
