After dropping a pair of tight
matches in Los Angeles, the No. 7
Stanford women's volleyball team
returned to the friendly confines of
Maples Pavilion this past weekend
with resounding success. Paced by
the dynamic sophomore duo of out
side hitter Rachel Williams and mid
dle blocker Carly Wopat, who was
named Pac-12 Offensive Player of
the Week, the Cardinal swept the
Arizona schools to move back above
.500 in conference play.
Stanford (10-3, 4-3 Pac-12)
began the weekend with a dominat
ing straight-sets win Friday night
against an overmatched Arizona
State squad (4-11,0-6), winning 25-
17,25-19,25-18. Particularly notable
was the play of Stanford's middle
blockers, featuring Wopat and jun
ior Jessica Walker. Wopat finished
the evening with a match-high 12
kills to go along with five blocks and
just one error. She had a stellar .524
hitting percentage for the match.
Walker was equally impressive, reg
istering nine kills on 18 error-free
attempts in addition to a career
high eight blocks, which led all play
ers. Their dominance highlighted
Stanford's advantage at the net, as

the Cardinal finished the evening
with a 13-4 advantage in blocks,
holding ASU to a paltry .097 hitting
percentage.

Wopat helped the Cardinal get off
to a quick start, registering four kills
and two blocks in the opening set.The
Cardinal also received strong contri
butions from junior outside hitter
Hayley Spelman and freshman libero
Kyle Gilbert during the opener. Spel
man tallied three kills and two blocks
while Gilbert had eight digs.
The Cardinal was paced by strong
defense in the second set, coming up
with 18 digs and five blocks as a
team. Williams and Walker each had
four kills.
Stanford finished off the sweep in
the third set with more dominating
play from Wopat, who registered five
kills in the set, and a sloppy attack
from ASU, which as a team had eight
errors in the final set.
The tougher task over the week
end would prove to be Sunday's con
test versus Arizona (10-5,2-4), which
resulted in a hard-fought, four-set
Cardinal win, 25-21,23-25,25-15,25-

18.The difference was Stanford's im
proved offensive attack, as the team
hit a season-best .392.
The prowess of the Cardinal's
sophomores was on full display, as
Williams led the team with 19 kills and
12 digs, her eighth double-double of
the season, and Wopat tied career
highs with 14 kills and nine blocks.
They highlighted an all-around terrific
effort, with important contributions
also coming from junior setter Karissa
Cook and senior middle blocker
Stephanie Browne. Cook finished
with 48 assists and 11 digs to go with
seven kills and a career-best .545 hit
ting percentage, while Browne regis
tered seven kills on eight attempts in
addition to a career-high seven blocks.
Head coach John Dunning cer
tainly appreciated the total team ef
fort.
"This was a great week for us," he
said. "Everyone knew we had to
work hard and improve after the
L.A. weekend, and we did. Great ef
fort and great focus carried over to
the matches; we took a big step for
ward offensively."
The five-time defending confer
ence champions are back in action
this Friday night at Oregon State.
