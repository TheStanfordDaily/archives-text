# SWEET REVENGE
## CARD BEATS USC, CAL 
### DAVID PEREZ 
The Stanford men's water polo
team took first place in the SoCal
Tournament this weekend, avenging
its only two losses of the season in the
process. The No. 4 Cardinal (7-2)
went 4-0 in the two-day event, win
ning two games Saturday and two on
Sunday. The final three victories
came by a combined four goals as
Stanford ended USC's nine-year title
run at the prestigious tournament
held jointly at Long Beach State and
Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training
Base.

The Cardinal easily took care of
Princeton 14-3 in Saturday's first
game before narrowly escaping a
tough 7-6 match against Pepperdine
in the nightcap. In a rematch of the
NorCal Invitational semifinal two
weeks ago, Stanford defeated previ
ously unbeaten No. IUSC by a score
of 6-4. The Cardinal finished off the
tournament with a huge 10-9 over
time win against No. 3 California in
the championship match Sunday
night.
Pepperdine, a much-improved
team from last season, gave Stanford
all it could handle in the first of three
consecutive close games. The score
was tied 3-3 at halftime and 5-5 after
three quarters, with neither team tak
ing a lead of more than one goal in
the entire game. After the teams
traded goals in the fourth, senior util
ity Peter Sefton netted what turned
out to be the game winner. Freshman
utility Alex Bowen paced the team
with three goals, senior driver Jacob
Smith had two and Sefton and soph
omore two-meter Forrest Watkins
each had one.
The win set up a semifinal game
with USC, while Cal and UCLA
matched up in the other semifinal.
This was an identical bracket to the
one that played out two weeks ago at
the NorCal Invitational, but this time
the results were very different. In
their last meeting, Stanford fell hard
to USC by a final score of 12-5. Stan

ford was never really in the game,
trailing 4-0 after the first quarter and
10-3 at halftime.
This time the Cardinal was able to
stifle USC's offense, keeping Stan
ford within reach throughout the
contest. After trailing by a goal at
halftime, the Cardinal dominated the
second half, outscoring the Trojans 4-
I to pull off the upset.
When asked about the differ
ence between the two meetings,
Sefton said, "The defense was
much, much better." Watkins was
even more blunt he responded
to the same question with just one
word, "Defense."
In a game where Stanford scored
only six goals, the fewest the team has
scored in any game of the tourna
ment, defense was indeed the key.
Stanford held USC to only one shot
on goal in the first quarter and only
II in the entire game. This was a
major improvement considering
USC scored 12 goals in their previous
meeting.
Sefton, who has stepped up as a
vocal leader in his senior year, com
mented on the team's tenacity in pre
venting goals.
"Our intensity and effort on de
fense were much higher compared to
two weeks ago," he said.
Stanford's six goals came from
five different players; Watkins was
the only Cardinal player with more
than one. Three goals came from the
usual suspects Sefton, Smith and
junior driver Paul Rudolph had a
goal apiece but the other three
goals came from some unexpected
sources.
Sefton attributed that to the USC
defense.
"Against a team like USC, you
have to take what they give you," he
said. "That's why there were goals
from people who do not usually
score."
The defensive-minded Andrew
LaForge may have been the last per
son Stanford expected to score, but
he did just that with a crucial third
quarter goal, his first of the season
and just his seventh in three years on
the Farm.
Watkins, on the other hand, has

MEN'S WATER POLO

been a pleasant surprise on the of
fensive end this year. He has already
surpassed his goal-scoring total of
seven from last year. Watkins said his
scoring output have a lot to do with
the hard work he put in this offsea
son, as well as a new mindset.
"I was a little nervous my first
year, but now I just go for it," he said.
Bowen asserted himself as a
force to be reckoned with in the
championship game against Cal.
The utility player scored six of Stan
ford's 10 goals, including the only
goal of the overtime period, earning
him MPSF Player of the Week hon
ors. He carried the offensive load
after Smith, a second-team All-

American in 2010, had to leave the
game early with a gash over his eye.
"It was really nice to see him
come in and play well after Jacob
went out," Watkins said. "He is a
huge asset. He's going to be big for
us."

Junior driver Alex Avery, Smith
and Watkins also scored in a game
that was close throughout. California
had come from behind to beat Stan
ford in the third-place game of the
NorCal Invitational, but this time
Stanford pulled through, even after
giving up its 5-3 halftime lead and
going into overtime.

Stanford will look to build on the
success from this weekend as it heads
to Avery Aquatic Center for the first
time this season to host Pepperdine
on Friday at 7 p.m.

he did just that with a crucial third
quarter goal, his first of the season
and just his seventh in three years on
the Farm.

been a pleasant surprise on the of
fensive end this year. He has already
surpassed his goal-scoring total of
seven from last year. Watkins said his
scoring output have a lot to do with
the hard work he put in this offsea
son, as well as a new mindset.
"I was a little nervous my first
year, but now I just go for it," he said.
Bowen asserted himself as a
force to be reckoned with in the
championship game against Cal.
The utility player scored six of Stan
ford's 10 goals, including the only
goal of the overtime period, earning
him MPSF Player of the Week hon
ors. He carried the offensive load
after Smith, a second-team All-

American in 2010, had to leave the
game early with a gash over his eye.
"It was really nice to see him
come in and play well after Jacob
went out," Watkins said. "He is a
huge asset. He's going to be big for
us."

Junior driver Alex Avery, Smith
and Watkins also scored in a game
that was close throughout. California
had come from behind to beat Stan
ford in the third-place game of the
NorCal Invitational, but this time
Stanford pulled through, even after
giving up its 5-3 halftime lead and
going into overtime.

Stanford will look to build on the
success from this weekend as it heads

time this season to host Pepperdine
on Friday at 7 p.m.

The Stanford men's water polo
team took first place in the SoCal
Tournament this weekend, avenging
its only two losses of the season in the
process. The No. 4 Cardinal (7-2)
went 4-0 in the two-day event, win
ning two games Saturday and two on
Sunday. The final three victories
came by a combined four goals as
Stanford ended USC's nine-year title
run at the prestigious tournament
held jointly at Long Beach State and
Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training
Base.

The Cardinal easily took care of
Princeton 14-3 in Saturday's first
game before narrowly escaping a
tough 7-6 match against Pepperdine
in the nightcap. In a rematch of the
NorCal Invitational semifinal two
weeks ago, Stanford defeated previ
ously unbeaten No. IUSC by a score
of 6-4. The Cardinal finished off the
tournament with a huge 10-9 over
time win against No. 3 California in
the championship match Sunday
night.
Pepperdine, a much-improved
team from last season, gave Stanford
all it could handle in the first of three
consecutive close games. The score
was tied 3-3 at halftime and 5-5 after
three quarters, with neither team tak
ing a lead of more than one goal in
the entire game. After the teams
traded goals in the fourth, senior util
ity Peter Sefton netted what turned
out to be the game winner. Freshman
utility Alex Bowen paced the team
with three goals, senior driver Jacob
Smith had two and Sefton and soph
omore two-meter Forrest Watkins
each had one.
The win set up a semifinal game
with USC, while Cal and UCLA
matched up in the other semifinal.
This was an identical bracket to the
one that played out two weeks ago at
the NorCal Invitational, but this time
the results were very different. In
their last meeting, Stanford fell hard
to USC by a final score of 12-5. Stan

ford was never really in the game,
trailing 4-0 after the first quarter and
10-3 at halftime.
This time the Cardinal was able to
stifle USC's offense, keeping Stan
ford within reach throughout the
contest. After trailing by a goal at
halftime, the Cardinal dominated the
second half, outscoring the Trojans 4-
I to pull off the upset.
When asked about the differ
ence between the two meetings,
Sefton said, "The defense was
much, much better." Watkins was
even more blunt he responded
to the same question with just one
word, "Defense."
In a game where Stanford scored
only six goals, the fewest the team has
scored in any game of the tourna
ment, defense was indeed the key.
Stanford held USC to only one shot
on goal in the first quarter and only
II in the entire game. This was a
major improvement considering
USC scored 12 goals in their previous
meeting.
Sefton, who has stepped up as a
vocal leader in his senior year, com
mented on the team's tenacity in pre
venting goals.
"Our intensity and effort on de
fense were much higher compared to
two weeks ago," he said.
Stanford's six goals came from
five different players; Watkins was
the only Cardinal player with more
than one. Three goals came from the
usual suspects Sefton, Smith and
junior driver Paul Rudolph had a
goal apiece but the other three
goals came from some unexpected
sources.
Sefton attributed that to the USC
defense.
"Against a team like USC, you
have to take what they give you," he
said. "That's why there were goals
from people who do not usually
score."
The defensive-minded Andrew
LaForge may have been the last per
son Stanford expected to score, but
he did just that with a crucial third
quarter goal, his first of the season
and just his seventh in three years on
the Farm.
Watkins, on the other hand, has
