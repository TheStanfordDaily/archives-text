# Is it wrong to stream sports?
## 
### Tom Taylor 
I know illegal file-sharing is a car
dinal sin pun not intended
and that it leaves a big hole in the
bank accounts of our impover
ished multimillionaire artists,
but what about the sports equivalent?
Is it okay to watch games streamed, il
legally, across the Internet?
There is of course nothing like
physically being at a game, and if you
live close enough to the action, it is
hard to argue for substituting that with
video footage, whether a jumpy Inter
net stream or high-definition TV.
However, it is not cheap being an aver
age sports fan. Even in the global eco
nomic downturn, ticket prices pre
dictably go up every year, and teams, at
least in soccer, change their jerseys on
an annual basis in the hope of prying
an extra dollar or two from our wallets.
Going to every home game is a serious
commitment of time and money that
most people simply can't afford.
And then there are the away
games. It is a virtually impossible
dream to watch every game in the
flesh, even through just one season.
Add in any postseason games, and
people will start to wonder if you actu
ally have a job, and if not, where you
got all that money from.
If you are really lucky, the games
you cannot attend will be shown on
regular TV via a standard cable
package or free (and legally) on the
Web. But you can't always count on
such fortune, leaving you relying on
the dreaded pay-per-view, or even
facing the reality that there isn't suf
ficient demand to justify retransmit
ting the action.
Pay-per-view often prices itself out
of the market, or at least out of my
market as an example, a single
game from the current Rugby World
Cup costs $25, while the whole pack

age costs $l5O and depending on
your TV package, it is not even guaran
teed to be available. Counting on
sports bars to step in and screen these
games also doesn't always solve the
problem. Using rugby again as an ex
ample, the logistics of the tournament
being played out in New Zealand
mean at least some of the games finish
after local closing hours. Though that is
no excuse, it's a struggle to find any bar
near Stanford showing even a few
minutes of the action from this major
international sports event.
For anyone who actually wants to
watch some rugby in the next few
weeks, my advice is to head down to
the Bechtel International Center.
Thanks to a few committed rugby fans
on campus, they will be showing the
upcoming games... well, all but one; a
salsa class outranks the Ireland vs.
Wales quarterfinal. No offense to
salsa, but the average worldwide TV
audience at the last Rugby World Cup
was 87.5 million per game, respectably
comparable with the U.S. audience for
the last Super Bowl of 111 million.
Would salsa come before the NFL?
So when you have exhausted all the
normal avenues, what are you left
with? Illegal downloading is, as the
name implies, not legal, but if there is
no other reasonable option, is it moral
ly okay?
I live my life somewhere between
the United States and the United
Kingdom. When living in each loca
tion I have bought genuine DVDs to
legitimately watch on my TV or com
puter, but I am cursed to own a Mac.
Apple computers or at least mine
make it incredibly frustrating to
watch these discs;l can't just switch be
tween watching my region 1 (United
States) and region 2 (Europe) DVDs.
So am I supposed to buy new copies of
everything for every country I decide
to live in? And what about the movies
or TV programs that simply aren't
available on both sides of the At
lantic?

Finding these online would be a
relatively simple exercise, and I
wouldn't feel too bad about watching
them because I'm not denying anyone
an income; they already have my
money. Finding streams of live events
is just as easy, and when I simply can't

find any other way of genuinely
watching a game here, would it really
be that bad? I have already invested
hard-earned cash in tickets to previ
ous games and branded clothing for
most of the teams that I would really
want to watch.

In fact, the closer I feel to the
teams, the more likely I am to spend
again the next time I am nearby. I
might feel scared that the FBI is track
ing my every move if I log on to one of
these sites, but should I really feel that
bad about it?

Tom Taylor needs your help with a
moral dilemma: should he put on his
own salsa moves to show up the crowd
at Bechtel? Help him control his danc
ing feet at tom.taylor@stanford.edu.

ly okay?
I live my life somewhere between
the United States and the United
Kingdom. When living in each loca
tion I have bought genuine DVDs to
legitimately watch on my TV or com
puter, but I am cursed to own a Mac.
Apple computers or at least mine
make it incredibly frustrating to
watch these discs;l can't just switch be
tween watching my region 1 (United
States) and region 2 (Europe) DVDs.
So am I supposed to buy new copies of
everything for every country I decide
to live in? And what about the movies
or TV programs that simply aren't
available on both sides of the At
lantic?

Finding these online would be a
relatively simple exercise, and I
wouldn't feel too bad about watching
them because I'm not denying anyone
an income; they already have my
money. Finding streams of live events
is just as easy, and when I simply can't

find any other way of genuinely
watching a game here, would it really
be that bad? I have already invested
hard-earned cash in tickets to previ
ous games and branded clothing for
most of the teams that I would really
want to watch.

In fact, the closer I feel to the
teams, the more likely I am to spend
again the next time I am nearby. I
might feel scared that the FBI is track
ing my every move if I log on to one of
these sites, but should I really feel that
bad about it?
