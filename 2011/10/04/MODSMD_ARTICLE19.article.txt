# Shorthanded Card runs well
## Without derrick and riley, men get fourth 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite missing several of its top runners, the No. 3
men's cross country team put on a strong showing at the
Notre Dame Invitational last Saturday, scoring 202 points
to place fourth in the competitive Blue Division. No. 14
BYU won the race, with No. 10 Florida State and No. 12
Princeton finishing second and third, respectively.
Men's coach Jason Dunn was impressed with the
team's performance in very tough conditions winds
were gusting up to 30 miles per hour during the race, and
heavy rain in the area made for a very wet and muddy
course.

Missing from the Cardinal's usual starting seven were
senior All-Americans Chris Derrick and Jacob Riley, who
finished one-two in Stanford's win at the Stanford Invita
tional last month. Both are expected to challenge for the
individual crown at the NCAA Championships in No
vember.
Redshirt senior Brendan Gregg, back at full health
after sitting out last year due to injury, picked up the slack
as the team's number one, crossing the finish line in 12th
place at 24:23. Redshirt sophomore Andrew Berberick
was hot on Gregg's heels, placing 21st at 24:38, followed
closely by redshirt senior J.T. Sullivan at 24:51.
BYU's Miles Batty won the meet's individual title in
23:59, holding off Princeton's Donn Cabral and Florida
State's Mike Fout down the final stretch, and the Cougars
placed five runners in the top 20 overall to win the team
title comfortably. But Dunn was more concerned with
staying healthy and getting the team running against solid
competition.
"[Notre Dame] was an opportunity to expose more of
our athletes to high-level competition," Dunn said."We
have a deep roster and we are limited by the Pac-12 to a
travel squad of 10 athletes, so this meet was a chance to
evaluate these particular seven athletes. I was pleased that
we were still able to finish relatively high in a large field,
even without the majority of our top seven runners such as
Chris and Jake, among others."
The internal competition to make Stanford's top seven
runners appears to be very strong. Redshirt junior Kevin
Havel and redshirt freshman Michael Atchoo rounded out
the Cardinal's top five at Notre Dame, with Havel finishing
59th and Atchoo 70th overall.
But it appears that close to six or seven runners are all
still in the running for the final spots on the "A" team. Der
rick, Riley, sophomore Erik Olson and redshirt junior
Benjamin Johnson are all but locked in, with Gregg like
ly holding an edge for a spot given his early results this
season and experience in the past. After Gregg, however,
it gets interesting freshman Joe Rosa and redshirt
sophomore Tyler Valdes looked very good at the Stanford
Invitational, as did Berberick at Notre Dame. But red
shirt junior Riley Sullivan, J.T. Sullivan and redshirt jun
ior Miles Unterreiner have all performed well in the past
at big meets, and any combination of runners could make
it to Terre Haute, Ind., for the NCAA Championships in
November.
Looking ahead to next week's Wisconsin Invitational,
Dunn noted that he hopes the team can continue improv
ing in the upcoming weeks.
"Our goals at a meet like Wisconsin are to compete as
well as possible on that given day. It will be a competitive
field, and I want us to be challenged before we enter the
championship portion of the season," he said. "Our goal
will be to win the meet, but I am mostly concerned with
how well we manage ourselves in such a competitive envi
ronment."
"We have a talented group that has put in a lot of work
up to this point, so if we can arrive at NCAAs healthy and
fit, we will have an opportunity to challenge for an NCAA
title," he continued.
In order to do that, the Cardinal will likely have to get
past top-ranked Oklahoma State, winners of the past two
NCAA team titles, but the Oct. 14 test against No. 2 Wis
consin should provide a good barometer of where the team
stands as the season gets into gear.
