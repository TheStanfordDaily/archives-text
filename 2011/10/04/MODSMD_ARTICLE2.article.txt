## Act grants young adults healthcare 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One million additional young adults
have health insurance coverage com
pared to a year ago as a result of the Af
fordable Care Act, the U.S. Depart
ment of Health & Human Services re
ported on Sept. 21.The act has had little
impact on health insurance coverage
rates and choices at Stanford so far,
though Cardinal Care may become
more expensive in future years.

The Affordable Care Act, first
signed into law in March 2010, directly
impacts young adults because of a poli
cy that allows children under 26 years of
age to stay on their parents' family pol
icy. This policy was intended to bridge a
gap in coverage for new college gradu
ates who are still searching for jobs and
previously did not qualify to stay on
their parents' family policy.
According to the Department of
Health & Human Services, this gap is
being filled. Between the first quarter of
2010 and the second quarter of 2011, a
Gallup survey showed that the rates of
insured adults aged 18 to 25 had in
creased from 71.0 percent to 75.1 per
cent.

While national insurance coverage
rates are going up, Stanford's enroll
ment figures for Cardinal Care have re
mained fairly stable, indicating that stu
dents are not opting to stay on their par
ents' plans because of the new law. In
2011, about 30 percent of undergradu
ates and 75 percent of graduate stu
dents had Cardinal Care. According to
Leigh Stacy, associate director for fi
nance and administration at Vaden
Health Center, the number of enrollees
in Cardinal Care this year is similar to
last year's, and perhaps even a little
higher.

However, changes are yet to come,
due to policies that expand access to
preventative health care. The act grants
free access to preventative services

such as blood pressure, diabetes and
cholesterol tests, cancer screening and
some vaccinations. Currently, Cardinal
Care charges a $2O co-payment fee for
preventative care. Another policy also
eliminates lifetime limits on benefit
payments, which Cardinal Care cur
rently caps at $5 million.
Unfortunately, the backlash of free
preventative health care may result in
premium costs going up.

"While expanded care is obviously
a plus, we are very concerned that it will
drive costs up," Stacy wrote in an email
to The Daily. She did not indicate how
much costs might change because the
final rules and regulations of the act are
still in the process of being released.
"Many of the pending changes, es
pecially as they pertain to student
plans, have not yet been fully defined
or made public," she said. "Vaden
works closely with peer institutions
and with industry consultants to keep
abreast of information as it is released,
but even so, it is difficult at this juncture
to determine what the impact to the
Cardinal Care plan will be."
