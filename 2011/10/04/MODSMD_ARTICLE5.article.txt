# Transports prompt policy review
## Castro to reconsider NSO Row house alcohol policy after transports 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
The Alcohol Advisory Board plans to re-examine the
Row houses' exemption to the New Student Orientation
(NSO) alcohol policy, according to Ralph Castro, director
of the newly formed Office of Alcohol Policy and Educa
tion (OAPE). This review comes after alcohol transports
occurred during this year's NSO week.
According to the Stanford University Department of
Public Safety (SUDPS) Bulletin, at least two alcohol trans
ports occurred during the NSO period.
For the past several years during NSO, typically con
sidered a "dry week," Row houses received a dispensa
tion from Residential Education's Row Office to host
parties serving alcohol, on several conditions, according
to the Alcohol@Stanford website. For example, houses'

parties must be kept in house and
quiet and each house is limited to a
maximum of two parties for each
house's respective residents only.
The policy also prohibits hard alco
hol and requires that food and
Equally Attractive Non-Alcoholic
Beverages (EANABs) be provid
ed, according to the Alcohol@Stan
ford website.

The policy also requires that all
in-house parties be registered by
Row Residence Management staff
members through myGroups@Stan
ford and approved by the Office of
Student Activities at least three days
in advance. Extra measures are
taken by Row housing staff to ensure
that the proposed parties do not vio
late University regulations.
According to Castro, the Row
houses' exemption from NSO's
strict, dry policy was introduced sev
eral years ago after a student repre
sentative from the Row petitioned to
the Alcohol Advisory Board to
change the NSO campus-wide alco
hol ban, arguing that it was "diffi
cult" and impractical for Row hous
ing staff to curtail residents of drink
ing age who want to socialize and use
alcohol during NSO.
"The Advisory Board looked at
the issue and granted the Row hous
es an exception to the NSO policy,"
Castro said.

The Alcohol Advisory Board in
formed new Row staff of the dispen
sation this September during Resi
dent Assistant (RA) training.
"We definitely try to meet the de
mands as much as we can," said Gil
Shotan, a Sigma Alpha Epsilon
(SAE) RA. "We realize it's a very
sensitive situation. The freshmen are
still new and their parents are still
around. We definitely try our best to
avoid causing any sort of problems

for the University."
While RAs are present during
party planning sessions for the NSO
in-house parties, they do not initiate
or lead these events.

"As RAs, we just go through the
session, to know about the process to
help mediate and advise the commu
nity managers," Shotan said. "We're
actually not allowed to register par
ties."

"It used to be really, really strict,"
Shotan added, referring to the years
before the NSO Row house exemp
tion. "[The Row houses] are trusted
to be responsible, to handle such
events, even during such a sensitive
period as NSO."
Castro emphasized the impor
tance that Row residents adhere to
the NSO regulations, cautioning that
Row houses that fail to comply may
lose the privilege to host in-house
parties during NSO.
"You abuse it, you lose it," Castro
said. "We did have some issues last
year that were isolated to certain
groups, and we dealt with those
groups through our existing process
es."

"The Row managers had a meet
ing with Zac Sargeant, where they
found that there was a transport,"
Shotan said. "We don't know if it was
some Stanford student, or if it even
happened at a Stanford party. I also
heard rumors that it might have been
a non-Stanford student."

Row student manager Zac
Sargeant and Castro declined to
comment on specifics.
"At this time, I can't comment on
those [incidents]," Castro said. "At
some point in the next few weeks,
members of the [Alcohol Advisory]
Board will come together to discuss
what happened during that time pe
riod, what were the circumstances
and make a determination on
whether or not that exemption to the
policy will occur next year."
