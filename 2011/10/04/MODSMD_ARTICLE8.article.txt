## ASSU, Pub Board debate student space 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The fate of the second floor of the Nitery re
mains unclear, according to ASSU leadership, de
spite the ASSU Publications Board's claims that
the space was slated to become a "Graphic Design
and Writing Center" for student publications.
In anticipation of the new use for the space, the
Board purchased more than $30,000 worth of fur
niture last spring.
According to Greg Boardman, vice provost of
student affairs (VPSA), the ASSU and the VPSA
office are currently forming a working group "to
gather broader student input as we define the fu
ture use of the Nitery space."
Last April, the Undergraduate Senate voted to
approve a $70,000 funding bill requested by then-
Publications Board co-directors Alice Nam 'll and
Zachary Warma 'll. The money was earmarked to
furnish and equip a high-tech publications space on
the second floor of the Nitery.
On May 5, the Publications Board spent more
than $30,000 of that money to purchase furniture
from Steelcase Inc. for the space.
On June 5, ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
forwarded a message co-signed by Boardman and
dean of student life Chris Griffith to the public Un
dergraduate Senate email list, in which Boardman
and Griffith stated that the newly purchased furni
ture would have to be removed from the Nitery
during the summer in order to make room for con
ferences that had rented the space out.
"The agreement between VSPA and ASSU
leadership over the last several years has also re
mained in place; namely that the Nitery would be
utilized as a conference space during summer," the
letter stated. "The removal of the current furnish
ings is in keeping with that agreement."
In the letter, Boardman and Griffith outlined
that a working group of both students and a few
staff members would be created, so that a clear
method of allocating space in the Old Union com
plex could be established moving forward.
Currently, the working group is still forming, but
will likely include Griffith, Cruz, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 and Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of operations and student
unions.
While individuals disagree about whether there
was any agreement, or implicit promise, concerning
the use of the space, Nam maintains that she and
Warma received confirmation that their proposal
could move forward, and the ASSU Senate provid
ed the necessary funds.
It remains unclear what will happen to the new
furniture, most of which is currently on the second
floor of the Nitery, according to Kate Abbott 'l2
and Sam Coggeshall 'l2, who were confirmed as
this year's Publications Board co-directors.
The Pub Board proposal
When the Board of Trustees approved a $24
million renovation of Old Union in 2005, the plan
included student publications occupying the upper
two floors of the Niteiy. However, only the Stan
ford Chaparral the campus's bi-quarterly
humor magazine was given a spot in the Nitery
when the renovated space opened in 2007.
Students involved in publications have lacked
a centralized hub on campus since the Storke Pub-
lishing Building which used to
house multiple student publications,
including The Daily was demol
ished in 2009. The Daily does not re
ceive any funding from the Pub
Board.
Nam and Alex Katz 'l2, her origi
nal co-chair before Warma replaced
him for spring quarter, drafted a plan
that would make the common area of
the second-floor Nitery a group collab
oration area; the plan also intended
two side-rooms to be computer clus
ters. The goal was to make a space
where organizations could meet and
get advice on how to improve their
publications, as well as a space where
students could pick up publications'
most recent issues.
The proposal timeline
After several months of communi
cating with various University officials,
the Publications Board received Sen
ate approval in April to purchase furni
ture, but the staying power of the pro
posal was unclear.
According to Nam, Warma re
ceived a text message from Smith-
Laws on May 12that said, "Take the
space and we'll work out the rest."
Nam said after getting verbal clari
fication from Smith-Laws as she was
entering Old Union, she and Warma
decided to interpret this as written ap
proval.

Smith-Laws directed an interview
request by The Daily to Cruz.
Cruz maintained, "No agree
ment, formal or informal, was ever
formalized."

He said he was not sure why the
Senate approved the funds if the pro
posal was not finalized. Cruz was vice
president of the ASSU at the time of
the approval, but had worked with the
Publications Board as a senator.
"We decided that because it was

May, and we had started trying to get
the approval process going back in Oc
tober that we were just going to move
stuff in since we had [Smith-Laws']
written approval," Nam said.
They had the furniture delivered
the following Friday.

It wasn't until the last week of the
spring quarter that Nam received the
email Cruz had forwarded to the Senate
list about the furniture being removed
from the Nitery over the summer.
Nam acknowledged that negotia
tions with the University were not al
ways smooth.
"They told us up front that people
complain about the Wellness Room,
people complain about the ethnic
community centers," she said. "I think
they didn't want to change anything
[in the Union] because then new peo
ple might be complaining. New peo
ple might be appealing to them asking
them why they didn't get space."
At a May 3 Undergraduate Senate
meeting, Nanci Howe, associate dean
of Student Activities and Leadership
(SAL), presented some of her con
cerns about making the space a publi
cations center.

"One challenge with the space is
that the University has made a com
mitment to having spaces as open to all
students as broadly as possible," Howe
said. "For me, I'm very supportive of
student publications, but I'm much
more interested in creating a space that
can be used by all students, rather than
one labeled for publications."
Abbott and Coggeshall at the May
31 Senate meeting, said they were sur
prised when they found out over the
summer that all of the new furnishings
had been removed from the Nitery.
Abbott is a senior staff writer at The
Daily.

Abbott said that while the space is
no longer officially slated for a publica
tions center, the Board is going
through normal student-group chan
nels to try to reserve rooms in the sec
ond-floor Nitery for publication-re
lated events. Both Abbott and
Coggeshell said they hope to be in

volved in the University's attempt to
evaluate how best to use the space in
Old Union.

"We still feel that's a publication
space," Coggeshall said.
Nam was not as hopeful about her
original vision for the space.
"They are pretty much going to ig
nore any [previous] proposals," she
said. "They are going to go back to the
drawing board and rethink about what
to do with it."

house multiple student publications,
including The Daily was demol
ished in 2009. The Daily does not re
ceive any funding from the Pub
Board.
Nam and Alex Katz 'l2, her origi
nal co-chair before Warma replaced
him for spring quarter, drafted a plan
that would make the common area of
the second-floor Nitery a group collab
oration area; the plan also intended
two side-rooms to be computer clus
ters. The goal was to make a space
where organizations could meet and
get advice on how to improve their
publications, as well as a space where
students could pick up publications'
most recent issues.
The proposal timeline
After several months of communi
cating with various University officials,
the Publications Board received Sen
ate approval in April to purchase furni
ture, but the staying power of the pro
posal was unclear.
According to Nam, Warma re
ceived a text message from Smith-
Laws on May 12that said, "Take the
space and we'll work out the rest."
Nam said after getting verbal clari
fication from Smith-Laws as she was
entering Old Union, she and Warma
decided to interpret this as written ap
proval.

Smith-Laws directed an interview
request by The Daily to Cruz.
Cruz maintained, "No agree
ment, formal or informal, was ever
formalized."

He said he was not sure why the
Senate approved the funds if the pro
posal was not finalized. Cruz was vice
president of the ASSU at the time of
the approval, but had worked with the
Publications Board as a senator.
"We decided that because it was

May, and we had started trying to get
the approval process going back in Oc
tober that we were just going to move
stuff in since we had [Smith-Laws']
written approval," Nam said.
They had the furniture delivered
the following Friday.

It wasn't until the last week of the
spring quarter that Nam received the
email Cruz had forwarded to the Senate
list about the furniture being removed
from the Nitery over the summer.
Nam acknowledged that negotia
tions with the University were not al
ways smooth.
"They told us up front that people
complain about the Wellness Room,
people complain about the ethnic
community centers," she said. "I think
they didn't want to change anything
[in the Union] because then new peo
ple might be complaining. New peo
ple might be appealing to them asking
them why they didn't get space."
At a May 3 Undergraduate Senate
meeting, Nanci Howe, associate dean
of Student Activities and Leadership
(SAL), presented some of her con
cerns about making the space a publi
cations center.

"One challenge with the space is
that the University has made a com
mitment to having spaces as open to all
students as broadly as possible," Howe
said. "For me, I'm very supportive of
student publications, but I'm much
more interested in creating a space that
can be used by all students, rather than
one labeled for publications."
Abbott and Coggeshall at the May
31 Senate meeting, said they were sur
prised when they found out over the
summer that all of the new furnishings
had been removed from the Nitery.
Abbott is a senior staff writer at The
Daily.

Abbott said that while the space is
no longer officially slated for a publica
tions center, the Board is going
through normal student-group chan
nels to try to reserve rooms in the sec
ond-floor Nitery for publication-re
lated events. Both Abbott and
Coggeshell said they hope to be in

volved in the University's attempt to
evaluate how best to use the space in
Old Union.

"We still feel that's a publication
space," Coggeshall said.
Nam was not as hopeful about her
original vision for the space.
"They are pretty much going to ig
nore any [previous] proposals," she
said. "They are going to go back to the
drawing board and rethink about what
to do with it."

The fate of the second floor of the Nitery re
mains unclear, according to ASSU leadership, de
spite the ASSU Publications Board's claims that
the space was slated to become a "Graphic Design
and Writing Center" for student publications.
In anticipation of the new use for the space, the
Board purchased more than $30,000 worth of fur
niture last spring.
According to Greg Boardman, vice provost of
student affairs (VPSA), the ASSU and the VPSA
office are currently forming a working group "to
gather broader student input as we define the fu
ture use of the Nitery space."
Last April, the Undergraduate Senate voted to
approve a $70,000 funding bill requested by then-
Publications Board co-directors Alice Nam 'll and
Zachary Warma 'll. The money was earmarked to
furnish and equip a high-tech publications space on
the second floor of the Nitery.
On May 5, the Publications Board spent more
than $30,000 of that money to purchase furniture
from Steelcase Inc. for the space.
On June 5, ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
forwarded a message co-signed by Boardman and
dean of student life Chris Griffith to the public Un
dergraduate Senate email list, in which Boardman
and Griffith stated that the newly purchased furni
ture would have to be removed from the Nitery
during the summer in order to make room for con
ferences that had rented the space out.
"The agreement between VSPA and ASSU
leadership over the last several years has also re
mained in place; namely that the Nitery would be
utilized as a conference space during summer," the
letter stated. "The removal of the current furnish
ings is in keeping with that agreement."
In the letter, Boardman and Griffith outlined
that a working group of both students and a few
staff members would be created, so that a clear
method of allocating space in the Old Union com
plex could be established moving forward.
Currently, the working group is still forming, but
will likely include Griffith, Cruz, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 and Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of operations and student
unions.
While individuals disagree about whether there
was any agreement, or implicit promise, concerning
the use of the space, Nam maintains that she and
Warma received confirmation that their proposal
could move forward, and the ASSU Senate provid
ed the necessary funds.
It remains unclear what will happen to the new
furniture, most of which is currently on the second
floor of the Nitery, according to Kate Abbott 'l2
and Sam Coggeshall 'l2, who were confirmed as
this year's Publications Board co-directors.
The Pub Board proposal
When the Board of Trustees approved a $24
million renovation of Old Union in 2005, the plan
included student publications occupying the upper
two floors of the Niteiy. However, only the Stan
ford Chaparral the campus's bi-quarterly
humor magazine was given a spot in the Nitery
when the renovated space opened in 2007.
Students involved in publications have lacked
a centralized hub on campus since the Storke Pub-
lishing Building which used to
house multiple student publications,
including The Daily was demol
ished in 2009. The Daily does not re
ceive any funding from the Pub
Board.
