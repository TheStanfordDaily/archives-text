## ASSU, Pub Board debate student space 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
The fate of the second floor of the Nitery re
mains unclear, according to ASSU leadership, de
spite the ASSU Publications Board's claims that
the space was slated to become a "Graphic Design
and Writing Center" for student publications.
In anticipation of the new use for the space, the
Board purchased more than $30,000 worth of fur
niture last spring.
According to Greg Boardman, vice provost of
student affairs (VPSA), the ASSU and the VPSA
office are currently forming a working group "to
gather broader student input as we define the fu
ture use of the Nitery space."
Last April, the Undergraduate Senate voted to
approve a $70,000 funding bill requested by then-
Publications Board co-directors Alice Nam 'll and
Zachary Warma 'll. The money was earmarked to
furnish and equip a high-tech publications space on
the second floor of the Nitery.
On May 5, the Publications Board spent more
than $30,000 of that money to purchase furniture
from Steelcase Inc. for the space.
On June 5, ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
forwarded a message co-signed by Boardman and
dean of student life Chris Griffith to the public Un
dergraduate Senate email list, in which Boardman
and Griffith stated that the newly purchased furni
ture would have to be removed from the Nitery
during the summer in order to make room for con
ferences that had rented the space out.
"The agreement between VSPA and ASSU
leadership over the last several years has also re
mained in place; namely that the Nitery would be
utilized as a conference space during summer," the
letter stated. "The removal of the current furnish
ings is in keeping with that agreement."
In the letter, Boardman and Griffith outlined
that a working group of both students and a few
staff members would be created, so that a clear
method of allocating space in the Old Union com
plex could be established moving forward.
Currently, the working group is still forming, but
will likely include Griffith, Cruz, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 and Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of operations and student
unions.
While individuals disagree about whether there
was any agreement, or implicit promise, concerning
the use of the space, Nam maintains that she and
Warma received confirmation that their proposal
could move forward, and the ASSU Senate provid
ed the necessary funds.
It remains unclear what will happen to the new
furniture, most of which is currently on the second
floor of the Nitery, according to Kate Abbott 'l2
and Sam Coggeshall 'l2, who were confirmed as
this year's Publications Board co-directors.
The Pub Board proposal
When the Board of Trustees approved a $24
million renovation of Old Union in 2005, the plan
included student publications occupying the upper
two floors of the Niteiy. However, only the Stan
ford Chaparral the campus's bi-quarterly
humor magazine was given a spot in the Nitery
when the renovated space opened in 2007.
Students involved in publications have lacked
a centralized hub on campus since the Storke Pub-
