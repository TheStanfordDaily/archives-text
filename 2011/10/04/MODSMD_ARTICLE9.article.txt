## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€” Margaret Rawson 
Emeritus professor of philosophy
John Perry was awarded an Ig Nobel
prize in the literature categoiy last
Thursday for his theory of "structured
procrastination." Perry, who was in
Germany, was unable to attend the
award ceremony at Harvard Universi
ty, and instead sent in his stead his edi
tor Deborah Wilkes.
Perry first published his theory in a
Feb. 1996 Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion essay titled "How to Procrastinate
and Still Get Things Done." The piece
has since been republished under the
title "Structured Procrastination."
In the essay, Perry outlines his
method for a procrastinator to become
a "useful citizen."
"The procrastinator can be motivat
ed to do difficult, timely and important
tasks," he wrote, "as long as these tasks
are away of not doing something more
important."
Rather than minimizing one's com
mitments, a method many procrastina
tors try, Perry suggests strategically fill
ing one's list of commitments to use
procrastination as a tool to achieve
more.
Perry writes, "Structured procrasti
nation requires a certain amount of
self-deception, since one is, in effect,
constantly perpetrating a pyramid
scheme on oneself ... And virtually all
procrastinators also have excellent
skills at self-deception so what could
be more noble than using one character
flaw to offset the effects of another?"
Perry co-hosts the radio program
"Philosophy Talk" with fellow philoso
phy professor Kenneth Taylor and is
known for his work on situation seman
tics.
Improbable Research, the organi
zation administering the awards, de
scribes its criteria on its website:"The Ig
Nobel Prizes honor achievements that

first make people laugh and then make
them think. The prizes are intended to
celebrate the unusual, honor the imagi
native and spur people's interest in
science, medicine and technology."

Other 2011 winners included re
searchers from several countries who
examined why people sigh, analyzed
decision-making when subjects needed
to urinate and documented that there is
"No Evidence of Contagious Yawning
in the Red-Footed Tortoise."
