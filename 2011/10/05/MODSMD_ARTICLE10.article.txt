# County staff report advises San Mateo to accept $10m trail offer
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
San Mateo County should ac
cept the University's $10.2 million
offer to upgrade the trail along
Alpine Road, according to Assis
tant County Manager David Hol
land in Tuesday's staff report.
This is based on community
comments voiced at two previous
community meetings and through
mail and email sent to the office of
the County Manager, according to
Holland.
The plans to build the trail net
work stems from agreements in
Stanford's 2000 General Use Per
mit with Santa Clara County. As
part of the deal, the University
agreed to build a pair of recre
ational trails worth $l9 million
from the campus to the surround
ing foothills in return for permis
sion to add 5 million square feet of
new buildings on campus. The trail
through San Mateo County prop
erty runs along Alpine Road from
Ladera to Stanford Weekend
Acres.
Public opinion on the trail issue
split. Residents of Stanford Week
end Acres were concerned that im
provements would attract more cy
clists, walkers and runners along
the trail, increasing the potential
for accidents along the busy road.
Other respondents supported the
efforts to promote walking and cy
cling in the community.
The report recommends that
the county ask Stanford for an ex
tension on the offer, which is set to
expire Dec. 31 this year. During
this time, the county should come
up with a trail design and engi
neering and environmental re
ports regarding the project, all at
Stanford's expense.
Larry Horton, senior associate
vice president for government and
community relations, indicated in
an Aug. 31 interview with the Stan
ford Report that the University
might consider a two-year exten
sion.
If the city rejects the offer or the
University decides to not offer the
exception, however, the funds will
be paid to Santa Clara County for
purposes specified under the terms
of the GUP agreement.
