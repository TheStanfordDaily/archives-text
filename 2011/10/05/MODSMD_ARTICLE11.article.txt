In "Senate confirms Election
Commissioner" (Sept. 28), The
Daily incorrectly reported that
Election Commissioner Adam
Adler 'l2 offered his services as so
licitors general (SG) to the respon
dents, former ASSU Publications
Board co-director Alice Nam 'll
and former Senate Chair Madeline
Hawes 'l3. In fact, Adler was only
accused of offering his services to
the respondents and the Constitu
tional Council openly rejected the
claim that Adler misused his discre
tionary powers.
In addition, The Daily reported
that Senators Ben Laufer 'l2 and
Dan Delong 'l3 were the only two
senators to abstain from confirming
Adler's nomination. Senator Brian-

na Pang 'l3 also abstained.
The Daily reported that the
Elections Commission is currently
violating bylaws by falling short of
the required four members to serve
on the commission. In fact, the
Elections Officer Selection Com
mittee and the Senate are the par
ties violating this bylaw, not the
Elections Commission itself.

In "ASSU, Pub Board debate
student space" (Oct. 4), The Daily
incorrectly reported that Jeanette
Smith-Laws sent a text message to
former Publications Board co-di
rector Zachary Warma 'll giving
him permission to use the second
floor space of the Nitery for Publi
cations Board operations. Smith-
Laws sent an email to Warma on
her iPhone.
