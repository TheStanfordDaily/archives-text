## NARRATIVE Artistic attention to Afghanistan 
### MARWAFARAG DESK EDITOR 
It's noon at White Plaza, and students
pass through on bikes, on foot or on
the occasional more creative mode of
transport, intensely focused on get
ting to their destination. Some are
headed to class, some to lunch, some just
lost in their own thoughts, but almost none
stop to take notice of the impromptu exhi
bition on the lawn.
On a flimsy-looking stand hang six can
vas posters and a sign proclaiming the title of
the exhibition, "Windows and Mirrors."
One poster features an Albert Camus
quote, "We used to wonder where war lived,
what it was that made it so vile. And now we
realize that we know where it lives, that it is in
side ourselves." Another is a statistic printed
against a background painting of Afghan par
ents and children, "At least three children
were killed in war-related incidents every day
in Afghanistan in 2009. When does it stop?"
The remaining four works depict Afghan
women, children and elements of warfare.
The exhibit, part of a traveling mural
project organized by Quaker organization
American Friends Service Committee, was
brought to campus by student organization
Stanford Says No to War, in time for this
week's 10th anniversary of the war in
Afghanistan. The original exhibit consists of
45 murals, uniquely designed by artists, and
drawings by Afghan students. The replica
version, made to travel around smaller ven
ues, consists of reproductions of some of the
murals six of them are on display at Stan
ford this week.
"We are trying to get people to pause and
think about the fact that the Afghanistan
war has been going on for 10 years and it
doesn't make headlines everyday; but
there's still a lot of suffering going on and

this reminds us of that," Stanford Says No to
War faculty advisor Todd Davies 'B4 M.S.,
'B5 Ph.D.'9s told The Daily.
Not many students pause, though. Some
stand at a distance, but curiosity is immedi
ately replaced with reluctance when the stu
dent organizers make overtures.
"We do live in a bubble," said Joshua
Schott 'l4, president of Stanford Says No to
War. "Stanford students like to keep their
heads in the sand on these issues anything
that is challenging the institutional frame
work. The number one obstacle we face is ap
athy; students just tune controversy out."
The organizers believe that the format of
the exhibition, displaying art in a public
space, will help get students to pay attention.
"There are too many inputs for students
to pay attention to anything, and a moving
piece of art is a different way of explaining
things," said Eric Sabelman '6B, Ph.D '76,
former Stanford Quaker liaison.
"In away it's a forgotten war; there's very
little personal attachment... people tend to
think that whatever is happening there is
okay and we say, 'No, it's not; war is just as
terrible for an Afghan child or mother as it is
for anyone else,"' he added.
The emotions the paintings are meant to
invoke are clear one striking piece de
picts an Afghan woman as a phoenix be
tween guns emerging from behind an
Afghan and an American flag. Another enti
tled "Mother and Son" shows a mother em
bracing her child.
Yet to most students who pass by, it is
simply another day, another class and anoth
er paper to get through. Sabelman, however,
defines the success of the exhibition simply.
"If the one rare student comes in and
take on this cause, then that's a vast success,"
he said.

"Phoenix/Dove" was one of the six pieces on display in White Plaza. The artist was inspired by
the story of Meena, the founder of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.
