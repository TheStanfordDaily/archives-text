# OPINIONS
## JOBBERISH I'm a Barbie girl 
### Amanda Ach 
Before I delve into this week's
exciting topic, I want to give
credit where credit is due and
explain where I got the idea for this
column. Originally, I had planned to
make this a funny column (obvious
ly I decided against that) and talk
about the most ridiculous jobs I
could find on the Internet. And I
found some pretty weird (but com
pletely legitimate) ones: chicken
sexer, boner, cowpuncher and so
many more. (For the record, a boner
is someone who inserts boning into
women's garments to make them
more supportive, but I think it's fun
nier just to let the imagination wan
der on that one.) Anyway, that was
my original idea: inundate The
Daily's readership with bizarre jobs
that have unnecessarily sexual titles.
Then, one night a few weeks ago, I
was out at a bar with my friend when
this creepy guy started talking to us.

Long story short, we got onto the
topic of my column, and he suggest
ed that instead of telling Stanford
students to bone, I should give them
real job options that they might actu
ally consider. So thanks, creepy guy.
It's a pretty good idea. I'm still not
giving you my number though.
Now, onto this week's topic: The
Barbie Doll dress designer.
Before you stop reading, hear
me out. Granted, it's no boner. But
a Barbie dress designer is actually a
pretty great job. I'm not going to pa
tronize you by detailing the long
history of the Barbie doll and its im
portance in American culture and
society; instead, I'm going to level
with you completely you will
make six figures. I hate to be crass
(says the girl who has made three
boner references so far in this col
umn), but let's be honest: money re
ally does matter. But that's not the
only reason why it's not such a
ridiculous suggestion after all. The
best part of the job, in my opinion, is
that it's a great way for people inter
ested in fashion or product design
to gain experience in their respec
tive fields without subjecting them
selves to the miserable life of an un
paid intern/slave. Especially for
those hoping to pursue a career in
fashion, working as a Barbie Doll
dress designer can be a great start
ing point. In researching this topic, I
found that many people do the job
for a few years, make some money
and go on to work for big-name de
signers, although you should expect
a decrease in pay with that transi
tion.
Another reason life in plastic is so
fantastic (thanks, Aqua) is the rela
tive ease of the client-designer rela
tionship. Anyone who hopes to go
into fashion in some capacity, or
even anyone who has seen the
episodes of Project Runway where
they design outfits for "real women,"
knows that one of the most difficult
aspects of fashion design is executing
your vision while pleasing the client.
In this regard, Barbie is the perfect
client she has no strong personal
preferences and she can never feel
fat in anything. Who wouldn't love
designing for a client like that? Addi
tionally, as a doll dress designer, you
will get to attend various fashion
weeks, scout new looks for Barbie
and help set national trends by
telling the nine-year-olds of America
what they should wear.
But while Barbie dolls are great,
they aren't for everyone. Personally,
I never loved my Barbies, which I
made pretty obvious when I tore
them apart limb from limb and
buried them all around my back
yard. Sorry, Ken. Luckily, Barbies
aren't the only dolls who need a new
fall wardrobe, so if they aren't really
your thing, there are plenty of other
companies hiring doll fashion de
signers. There are also ways to get in
volved in the industry in other capac

ities, such as marketing and product
design. After all, someone has to
build that ridiculously proportioned
body before anyone can make an
adorable pink miniskirt for it to
wear.
The point is, doll fashion design
isn't just about Barbie it's a re
spected field that can lead to even
bigger and better things. You will
gain experience in fashion, product
design and marketing, and you get to
play with dolls, which is fun. Or you
could murder them, which is also
fun. Totally your call.

If you could care less about dolls but
think the idea of boning is fan, let
Amanda know ataach@stanford.edu.

Doll fashion design
isn't just about
Barbie its a
respected field.
