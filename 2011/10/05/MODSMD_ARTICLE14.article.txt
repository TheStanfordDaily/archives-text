# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Where are Stanford's lesbians? 
### Jamie Solomon 
Every Saturday, when I am home
in Oakland for the summer, my
parents and I go to our local
farmers' market. In addition to the
fresh local food, one of my favorite
things about it is the fact that I can see
the diversity of people who live in the
neighborhoods around me, I get to see
the little kids that squirm with impa
tience as their parents look at vegeta
bles, the most useless of all foods when
you're six, the adorable older couples
shopping together, the young guys on
the side peddling their music and the
families whose children's faces reflect
but do not always reveal the heritage
of their interracial parents.
The people that I love most of all,
though, are the lesbian couples. They
often stroll through the market, hand
in hand, buying food together and
making sure their kids don't get
stepped on by the other busy shop
pers. Oakland is to lesbians what San
Francisco is to gays. It's not as nation
ally renowned, but it's been a hotbed
of lesbian community and activism for
decades. It's a place that I'm proud to
come from and I love living in a com
munity where people don't have to

hide who they are or whom they love.
I think of Stanford as also having
that quality, but last fall when I got to
campus I began to realize that I don't
know very many women here who are
very open about being lesbians. At
best, I've only been aware of three or
four female undergrads in my time
here that identify as something other
than straight, but I know many gay
men. So I started to wonder why that
is.
Are there really no lesbians at this
school? Does the Office of Under
graduate Admissions have an uncon
scious bias against them? Stanford is
well known for being an accepting
place; it was ranked second on the
Princeton Review's list of the nation's
most LGBT-friendly colleges in 2011.
It just seems to me that the number of
gay men and women should be about
equal here, and the fact that this does
n't appear to be true worries me. That
might be a faulty assumption, but I
can't help but wonder: where are all of
Stanford's lesbians (and bisexual and
questioning women)? I have some
theories, but I have no way to tell if any
of these are actually true. It's hard to

track down a hidden or missing popu
lation.
Maybe the lesbians who go to pri
vate universities for college mostly
end up at women's colleges. Women's
colleges are widely joked about as
being bastions of lesbianism. Gay men
don't really have an equivalent op
tion; maybe Stanford only gets the
male half of the high-achieving LGBT
students.
It could be that I'm just better at
spotting gay men. If a guy acts flam
boyant here or flirts with everyone re
gardless of gender, I'm likely to ask
about his sexuality. If a girl does this, I
think nothing of it. I know who's gay
because I ask; I don't know who's a
lesbian because I much more rarely
make assumptions about women's
sexuality.
Are lesbians actually just as preva
lent as gay men, but just not as loud
about it? Do I have lots of lesbian
friends I just don't know are lesbians?
If this is the case, then I feel like Stan
ford students are missing a chance to
hear the stories and experiences of
lesbians. The diversity at Stanford is
wonderful, but it is only really valu
able if people share their opinions and
backgrounds with one another.
On the other hand, maybe this

whole column is silly and the reason
that I don't know any lesbians is be
cause I don't hang out with lesbians.
They could be in places I don't fre
quent. I just happen to know all the
gay performers because I do theater
and love a cappella.
The worst option is that maybe,
even though this is a great place to be
gay, Stanford's not a safe space for a
lesbian to be out and loud and proud.
I have no idea if this is true, but if it is,
this is an important thing for us to
work on as a school and figure out
how to fix.
So what's the reason? If this was an
academic paper, I would suggest we
launch a survey or do more research
to find the answer. But this is just a
lowly opinions article, so the most I
can really say is: think about it. Talk
about it. And don't just let me know
what you find; let our whole school
know.

able if people share their opinions and
backgrounds with one another.
On the other hand, maybe this

whole column is silly and the reason
that I don't know any lesbians is be
cause I don't hang out with lesbians.
They could be in places I don't fre
quent. I just happen to know all the
gay performers because I do theater
and love a cappella.
The worst option is that maybe,
even though this is a great place to be
gay, Stanford's not a safe space for a
lesbian to be out and loud and proud.
I have no idea if this is true, but if it is,
this is an important thing for us to
work on as a school and figure out
how to fix.
So what's the reason? If this was an
academic paper, I would suggest we
launch a survey or do more research
to find the answer. But this is just a
lowly opinions article, so the most I
can really say is: think about it. Talk
about it. And don't just let me know
what you find; let our whole school
know.
