## NO-HUDDLE UPS TEMPO LUCK CALLS PLAYS IN CARD VICTORY "We put the formation out there and let Andrew call the play. It's 100-percent up to him to put us in the right play." DAVID SHAW 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After dismantling UCLA 45-19 on Sat
urday night, Stanford football head coach
David Shaw commented that the offense
sped up its tempo by using a no-huddle sev
eral times during the game a new look
for the Cardinal offense that was spear
headed by a brand-new "offensive coordi
nator."
"[The no-huddle offense] is really
something we worked on the entire offsea
son, and this was the game that we were
going to start doing it," Shaw said in his
postgame press conference. "We put the
formation out there and let Andrew call
the play. It's 100-percent up to him to put us
in the right play... It's not coming from
the sideline, it's coming from him on the
field."
Shaw's comments were certainly in
triguing because Stanford running the no
huddle in the first place is distinctly differ
ent from the 2010 Cardinal team, which
held the football for an average of 34 min
utes and 34 seconds per game the high
est time of possession of any team in the
country last season.
But Shaw's comments were especially
interesting because of his deference to the
Heisman candidate quarterback to run the
offense.
"When we're in the no-huddle, [Luck]'s
calling the plays," he said. "If he wants to
get to anything, he can get to anything in
the offense."
After a season in which Stanford went
12-1 mostly due an offense that held on to
the football the entire game, why would the
Cardinal suddenly want to test out a new
style?
"It's something we're trying to incorpo
rate in our offense just to give us another
dimension," said redshirt junior offensive
tackle Jonathan Martin. "It's just some
thing we can spring on an opponent like we
did against UCLA."
Martin also mentioned that the team
spent a lot of time during the offseason get
ting adjusted to the new velocity after
wearing teams down in a much slower style
last season.
"We worked on it a lot in the offseason,
during spring ball, during camp," he said.
"So we kind of got used to the leg burn you
get from it, and we even did some drills in
the weight room to get used to it."
The no-huddle offense is not a new in
vention by any means the Cincinnati
Bengals first brought it to life in the 1980s
but the speedy, relentless style of of
fense has found new life in the college
game lately, most notably with the Oregon
Ducks, the only team to beat the Cardinal
last season.
Oregon's "blur" offense was the subject
of much debate and research last year, as
the Ducks played their way to the BCS Na
tional Championship Game, but Martin
said that the Cardinal is not trying to mimic
its rivals to the north.
"Oregon does a great job with [its of
fense], and it's all based off the option,"
Martin said. "Ours is our entire playbook,
which I think, I'm not really sure, is a lot
larger than Oregon's. Andrew can call any
play he wants when he's up there."
That ability to call his own plays sepa
rates Luck from pretty much any college
quarterback in the nation, Shaw said.
"I don't know if there's too many col
lege quarterbacks that can truly call the
game," he said. "I go back to the [former In
dianapolis Colts offensive coordinator]
Tom Moore quote of 'When you've got a
great player, don't hold him back.'"
Those who follow pro football closely
know that Moore's star pupil former
No. 1 overall pick and Super Bowl champi
on Peyton Manning calls his own plays
with wild gesticulations and loud audibles
at the line of scrimmage and is widely re
garded as one of the most difficult quarter
backs to play against in NFL history.
Luck, by virtue of being the projected
No. 1 pick in next year's NFL Draft, is fa
miliar with this type of praise, but he men

Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck threw for three touchdowns in Saturday night's game against UCLA, while junior running back Stepfan

tion of playing in Shaw's offense.
"It challenges us intellectually, all the
guys will attest that we want to make it
challenging on ourselves because we
know that's going to play to our advan
tage," Luck said. "I think it's why a lot of
guys come to Stanford, to challenge
yourself academically and athletically,
and it's fun to be in that offense."

In addition to the competitive ad
vantage, Martin said that the team
doesn't mind having a second offen
sive coordinator, either.
"By this point Andrew knows the
offense as well as any of the coaches,
we all trust that he'll make the right
decision. He has yet to make a mis
take in [the no-huddle offense]," he
said. "Andrew has a set number of
rules on what plays he's going to run
into [defensive] looks, so it's the
same as what coach Shaw sees ... he
just does what the defense is telling
him is the right play."

For defenses facing an offense that
has averaged 40.3 points per game
during its current 12-game win streak,
the idea of facing off against Shaw is
already scary enough but Shaw
himself says that facing coach Luck
might be even scarier.
"Fhs [play calls] were a little bit
better than mine."
Luck will get an opportunity to call
more plays on Saturday when Stan
ford takes on Colorado at 4:30 p.m.

the weight room to get used to it."
The no-huddle offense is not a new in

but the speedy, relentless style of of

last season.
Oregon's "blur" offense was the subject
of much debate and research last year, as
the Ducks played their way to the BCS Na

said that the Cardinal is not trying to mimic

"Oregon does a great job with [its of

Martin said. "Ours is our entire playbook,
which I think, I'm not really sure, is a lot
larger than Oregon's. Andrew can call any
play he wants when he's up there."
That ability to call his own plays sepa
rates Luck from pretty much any college
quarterback in the nation, Shaw said.
"I don't know if there's too many col

game," he said. "I go back to the [former In

tion of playing in Shaw's offense.
"It challenges us intellectually, all the
guys will attest that we want to make it
challenging on ourselves because we
know that's going to play to our advan
tage," Luck said. "I think it's why a lot of
guys come to Stanford, to challenge
yourself academically and athletically,
and it's fun to be in that offense."

In addition to the competitive ad
vantage, Martin said that the team
doesn't mind having a second offen
sive coordinator, either.
"By this point Andrew knows the
offense as well as any of the coaches,
we all trust that he'll make the right
decision. He has yet to make a mis
take in [the no-huddle offense]," he
said. "Andrew has a set number of
rules on what plays he's going to run
into [defensive] looks, so it's the
same as what coach Shaw sees ... he
just does what the defense is telling
him is the right play."

For defenses facing an offense that
has averaged 40.3 points per game
during its current 12-game win streak,
the idea of facing off against Shaw is
already scary enough but Shaw
himself says that facing coach Luck
might be even scarier.
"Fhs [play calls] were a little bit
better than mine."
Luck will get an opportunity to call
more plays on Saturday when Stan

After dismantling UCLA 45-19 on Sat
urday night, Stanford football head coach
David Shaw commented that the offense
sped up its tempo by using a no-huddle sev
eral times during the game a new look
for the Cardinal offense that was spear
headed by a brand-new "offensive coordi
nator."
"[The no-huddle offense] is really
something we worked on the entire offsea
son, and this was the game that we were
going to start doing it," Shaw said in his
postgame press conference. "We put the
formation out there and let Andrew call
the play. It's 100-percent up to him to put us
in the right play... It's not coming from
the sideline, it's coming from him on the
field."
Shaw's comments were certainly in
triguing because Stanford running the no
huddle in the first place is distinctly differ
ent from the 2010 Cardinal team, which
held the football for an average of 34 min
utes and 34 seconds per game the high
est time of possession of any team in the
country last season.
But Shaw's comments were especially
interesting because of his deference to the
Heisman candidate quarterback to run the
offense.
"When we're in the no-huddle, [Luck]'s
calling the plays," he said. "If he wants to
get to anything, he can get to anything in
the offense."
After a season in which Stanford went
12-1 mostly due an offense that held on to
the football the entire game, why would the
Cardinal suddenly want to test out a new
style?
"It's something we're trying to incorpo
rate in our offense just to give us another
dimension," said redshirt junior offensive
tackle Jonathan Martin. "It's just some
thing we can spring on an opponent like we
did against UCLA."
Martin also mentioned that the team
spent a lot of time during the offseason get
ting adjusted to the new velocity after
wearing teams down in a much slower style
last season.
"We worked on it a lot in the offseason,
during spring ball, during camp," he said.
"So we kind of got used to the leg burn you
get from it, and we even did some drills in
the weight room to get used to it."
