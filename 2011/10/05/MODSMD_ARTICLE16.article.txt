# Theo Epstein: no movies, two rings
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
Yesterday, I read a report
that said the Chicago Cubs
have asked the Boston
Red Sox for permission to
talk to Red Sox general
manager Theo Epstein. It has been ru
mored that the Cubs and chairman
Tom Ricketts have wanted the 37-
year-old Epstein to make baseball rel
evant again on the North Side, but the
report on Tuesday was a little bit of a
jolt to many of us in Red Sox Nation.
After winning two World Series titles

in nine seasons in Beantown, not only
should Red Sox fans be reluctant to let
the youngest GM in Major League
history leave; they should worship the
ground he walks on in gratitude for
what he has done.
While I do believe Epstein will stay
on for one more year and honor the
contract extension he signed four
years ago he is known to have a
particular loyalty to the Red Sox or
ganization after it put its trust in him as
a 28-year-old a move to the Windy

City could pay dividends for the Yale
grad.
Consider the possibilities: Epstein
could go down as the man who ended
an 86-year title drought for the Red
Sox which he did by assembling a
"bunch of idiots" who finally beat the
Yankees and broke the curse of the
Bambino in 2004 and be the one to
stop a more-than-100-year slide for
the Cubbies.
In Chicago, he'd have almost as
much money as he had with the Red
Sox, though it appears that Ricketts
actually does have an interest in win
ning as opposed to merely making
money, and he could maybe avoid
some of the constant second-guessing
and extreme pressure in sports-mad
Boston.
The Red Sox's utter collapse last
month will make plenty of residents
forget all about the playoff runs and
World Series titles and once again
begin calling for new blood at the top.
But while this season didn't turn out
as most of us fans had hoped it's
tough to swallow the rollercoaster of
emotions that accompany starting 0-
6, being the second-best team in base
ball for three months and then chok
ing like we had the Green Monster lit
erally down our throats for the final
month I'd like to point out just
three reasons why Theo Epstein is ex
actly the kind of general manager that
Billy Beane wishes he was.
Reason number one: Epstein is
not afraid to use the money at his dis
posal. This may sound really obvious
or stupid, because most general man
agers would kill to have a payroll of
$161.8 million. But when you have
that much money, the temptation is to
go out and spend it on anything in
sight, no matter the ramifications. Es
ptein has made several high-priced
moves that have backfired big-time
Mike Cameron anyone? but
for those who criticize the signing of
Daisuke Matsuzaka, remember that
in 2007 and 2008 he went 33-15 with
three postseason victories as the Red
Sox won a World Series.
And as Carl Crawford's batting
average failed to climb and while his
strikeout total made like Sylvester
Stallone in Cliffhanger, fans clamored
that Epstein had again missed the
boat by paying way too much for a
ground-ball machine that can only
play on turf. But if Crawford plays this
poorly next year, I will hang a Derek
Jeter jersey above my desk for the
playoffs, because the 30-year-old
Texas native has too much speed in
his legs and too good of a track record
not to hit within 40 points of his career
average again.
This brings us to reason number
two: Epstein uses detailed statistical
and sabermetric analysis, but not at a
Moneyball level. Beane and his assis
tants prided themselves on finding

players that can produce on paper,
racking up a high OBP and OPS even
if they look like they just took part in
a Morgan Spurlock all-McDonalds
diet. But it has been almost a decade
since the 2002 MLB Draft that was
supposed to be the bumper crop of
prospects that would carry the small
market Oakland Athletics to star
dom. The 2010 A's finished with a
record of 74-88 and haven't really
sniffed the playoffs since they were
swept in the 2006 ALCS by the De
troit Tigers.
Epstein has built up the current
version of the Red Sox with some
very nice moves in the draft Jaco
by Ellsbury, Dustin Pedroia, Kevin
Youkilis, Jon Lester, Jonathan Papel
bon, Jed Lowrie, Daniel Bard and
Clay Buccholz are all homegrown
but he also looks to make moves via
free agency or trade, even when they
are not the high-profile type. He
signed Mike Timlin in 2003 for cheap
and turned him into a premier set-up
man for the 2004 champs. He traded
Henri Stanley to the Los Angeles
Dodgers to pick up ... Dave Roberts.
As any self-respecting Sox fan knows,
Roberts is the hero of the 2004 Sox for
one play, and one play only: The Steal.
Add in a very nice pickup of David
Ortiz from the Twins' scrap heap, a
steal of a trade for Curt Schilling and
getting rid of Manny Ramirez before
any of the failed drug tests and bad ex
cuses, and that's not too shabby.
And last but not least, we arrive at
reason number three: Theo Epstein
graduated from Yale, and Billy Beane
turned down Stanford to go have a
mediocre minor league career. While I
would never say that going to Yale is
the right choice, if I had no college de
gree like Beane and was ever in Ep
stein's office staring at that diploma on
the wall, I'd probably be jealous too.
If Epstein leaves, I won't cry or
throw things or even lose sleep. It
would be a shame to let one of the top
five baseball minds walk away before
he can bring another title to Boston.
But if he wants to make his mark else
where (specifically the National
League), I can live with that. After
signing Adrian Gonzalez, Crawford,
Pedroia, Beckett and Lester, and
drafting Ellsbury and the rest of the
young guns, Epstein's fingerprints will
be all over the Red Sox for at least the
next seven seasons.

Miles Bennett-Smith will soon have
one more Stanford degree than Billy
Beane does, but he'll never be played
by Brad Pitt in a feature film. Reassure
him that he has a great personality at

turned down Stanford to go have a
mediocre minor league career. While I
would never say that going to Yale is
the right choice, if I had no college de
gree like Beane and was ever in Ep
stein's office staring at that diploma on
the wall, I'd probably be jealous too.
If Epstein leaves, I won't cry or
throw things or even lose sleep. It
would be a shame to let one of the top
five baseball minds walk away before
he can bring another title to Boston.
But if he wants to make his mark else
where (specifically the National
League), I can live with that. After
signing Adrian Gonzalez, Crawford,
Pedroia, Beckett and Lester, and
drafting Ellsbury and the rest of the
young guns, Epstein's fingerprints will
be all over the Red Sox for at least the
next seven seasons.

Miles Bennett-Smith will soon have
one more Stanford degree than Billy
Beane does, but he'll never be played
by Brad Pitt in a feature film. Reassure
him that he has a great personality at

Yesterday, I read a report
that said the Chicago Cubs
have asked the Boston
Red Sox for permission to
talk to Red Sox general
manager Theo Epstein. It has been ru
mored that the Cubs and chairman
Tom Ricketts have wanted the 37-
year-old Epstein to make baseball rel
evant again on the North Side, but the
report on Tuesday was a little bit of a
jolt to many of us in Red Sox Nation.
After winning two World Series titles

in nine seasons in Beantown, not only
should Red Sox fans be reluctant to let
the youngest GM in Major League
history leave; they should worship the
ground he walks on in gratitude for
what he has done.
While I do believe Epstein will stay
on for one more year and honor the
contract extension he signed four
years ago he is known to have a
particular loyalty to the Red Sox or
ganization after it put its trust in him as
a 28-year-old a move to the Windy

City could pay dividends for the Yale
grad.
Consider the possibilities: Epstein
could go down as the man who ended
an 86-year title drought for the Red
Sox which he did by assembling a
"bunch of idiots" who finally beat the
Yankees and broke the curse of the
Bambino in 2004 and be the one to
stop a more-than-100-year slide for
the Cubbies.
In Chicago, he'd have almost as
much money as he had with the Red
Sox, though it appears that Ricketts
actually does have an interest in win
ning as opposed to merely making
money, and he could maybe avoid
some of the constant second-guessing
and extreme pressure in sports-mad
Boston.
The Red Sox's utter collapse last
month will make plenty of residents
forget all about the playoff runs and
World Series titles and once again
begin calling for new blood at the top.
But while this season didn't turn out
as most of us fans had hoped it's
tough to swallow the rollercoaster of
emotions that accompany starting 0-
6, being the second-best team in base
ball for three months and then chok
ing like we had the Green Monster lit
erally down our throats for the final
month I'd like to point out just
three reasons why Theo Epstein is ex
actly the kind of general manager that
Billy Beane wishes he was.
Reason number one: Epstein is
not afraid to use the money at his dis
posal. This may sound really obvious
or stupid, because most general man
agers would kill to have a payroll of
$161.8 million. But when you have
that much money, the temptation is to
go out and spend it on anything in
sight, no matter the ramifications. Es
ptein has made several high-priced
moves that have backfired big-time
Mike Cameron anyone? but
for those who criticize the signing of
Daisuke Matsuzaka, remember that
in 2007 and 2008 he went 33-15 with
three postseason victories as the Red
Sox won a World Series.
And as Carl Crawford's batting
average failed to climb and while his
strikeout total made like Sylvester
Stallone in Cliffhanger, fans clamored
that Epstein had again missed the
boat by paying way too much for a
ground-ball machine that can only
play on turf. But if Crawford plays this
poorly next year, I will hang a Derek
Jeter jersey above my desk for the
playoffs, because the 30-year-old
Texas native has too much speed in
his legs and too good of a track record
not to hit within 40 points of his career
average again.
This brings us to reason number
two: Epstein uses detailed statistical
and sabermetric analysis, but not at a
Moneyball level. Beane and his assis
tants prided themselves on finding

players that can produce on paper,
racking up a high OBP and OPS even
if they look like they just took part in
a Morgan Spurlock all-McDonalds
diet. But it has been almost a decade
since the 2002 MLB Draft that was
supposed to be the bumper crop of
prospects that would carry the small
market Oakland Athletics to star
dom. The 2010 A's finished with a
record of 74-88 and haven't really
sniffed the playoffs since they were
swept in the 2006 ALCS by the De
troit Tigers.
Epstein has built up the current
version of the Red Sox with some
very nice moves in the draft Jaco
by Ellsbury, Dustin Pedroia, Kevin
Youkilis, Jon Lester, Jonathan Papel
bon, Jed Lowrie, Daniel Bard and
Clay Buccholz are all homegrown
but he also looks to make moves via
free agency or trade, even when they
are not the high-profile type. He
signed Mike Timlin in 2003 for cheap
and turned him into a premier set-up
man for the 2004 champs. He traded
Henri Stanley to the Los Angeles
Dodgers to pick up ... Dave Roberts.
As any self-respecting Sox fan knows,
Roberts is the hero of the 2004 Sox for
one play, and one play only: The Steal.
Add in a very nice pickup of David
Ortiz from the Twins' scrap heap, a
steal of a trade for Curt Schilling and
getting rid of Manny Ramirez before
any of the failed drug tests and bad ex
cuses, and that's not too shabby.
And last but not least, we arrive at
reason number three: Theo Epstein
graduated from Yale, and Billy Beane
turned down Stanford to go have a
mediocre minor league career. While I
would never say that going to Yale is
the right choice, if I had no college de
gree like Beane and was ever in Ep
