# Theo Epstein: no movies, two rings
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
Yesterday, I read a report
that said the Chicago Cubs
have asked the Boston
Red Sox for permission to
talk to Red Sox general
manager Theo Epstein. It has been ru
mored that the Cubs and chairman
Tom Ricketts have wanted the 37-
year-old Epstein to make baseball rel
evant again on the North Side, but the
report on Tuesday was a little bit of a
jolt to many of us in Red Sox Nation.
After winning two World Series titles

in nine seasons in Beantown, not only
should Red Sox fans be reluctant to let
the youngest GM in Major League
history leave; they should worship the
ground he walks on in gratitude for
what he has done.
While I do believe Epstein will stay
on for one more year and honor the
contract extension he signed four
years ago he is known to have a
particular loyalty to the Red Sox or
ganization after it put its trust in him as
a 28-year-old a move to the Windy

City could pay dividends for the Yale
grad.
Consider the possibilities: Epstein
could go down as the man who ended
an 86-year title drought for the Red
Sox which he did by assembling a
"bunch of idiots" who finally beat the
Yankees and broke the curse of the
Bambino in 2004 and be the one to
stop a more-than-100-year slide for
the Cubbies.
