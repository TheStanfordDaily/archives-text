## CARDINAL WINS SEASON OPENER VARSITY EIGHT, FOUR TAKE FIRST 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The women's rowing team kicked
off the fall season in style this week
end at the Head of the Oklahoma
Regatta, as the varsity eight boat
won the Collegiate Eight competi
tion with the fastest time of the day
before watching the varsity four earn
a Night Sprint win by two-hun
dredths of a second.
Stanford won the Collegiate Eight
last year at the same event, held annu
ally in Oklahoma City, and was anx
ious to defend the title despite not
having as much time to prepare as the
team is accustomed to, according to
head coach Yasmin Farooq.
"This race hit earlier in the season
than usual," Farooq told GoStan
ford.com, "and school started later,
so we had to put lineups together
quickly and get the boats up to
speed. We took a 'NASCAR pit
crew' approach to the weekend and
really embraced each practice lead
ing up to it with that kind of ur
gency," she said.
The Cardinal led from the begin
ning, getting off to a clean start in
calm conditions on the Oklahoma
River. But Texas put up a fight,
matching Stanford's stroke rate for

much of the 4,000-meter race. In the
end, however, the Longhorns could
not quite close the gap, and the Cardi
nal crossed the finish line a full 10 sec
onds clear of the second boat.
As the light faded, the Night
Sprint portion of the racing began,
with plenty of fan support lining the
banks.
"The overall atmosphere is really
a celebration of the athletes' efforts
and the Oklahoma fans made all of us
feel special," Farooq said.
The Cardinal four, who lost a close
race to Texas in the Head of the Okla
homa race earlier in the day, came out
strong and were quickly in a tight bat
tle with the Oklahoma team. The
Sooners held a slim lead for much of
the 500-meter course, but a late surge
pushed Stanford over the top in a
photo finish.
It was the reverse of the varsity
eight 500-meter event in which Okla
homa nipped Stanford at the line. But
overall, Stanford left with a lot to
build on.
"Both boats raced aggressively,
and made the most of the day," Fa
rooq said. "There certainly is work to
do in the weeks ahead, but a race like
this one is a great reminder that we ul
timately train to race. We'll be back."
The Cardinal returns to action in
three weeks for the prestigious Head
of the Charles competition, held an
nually in Boston.
