## Phys.dept debuts placement test Growth in class enrollment prompts department to create advisory exam 
### BRAD HUANG 
In response to a growing number of students taking
courses in the field, Stanford's physics department of
fered a placement test to incoming students for the first
time during this year's New Student Orientation
(NSO) week a change from previous years when
only chemistry and foreign languages required such
tests.
According to Hari Manoharan, physics professor
and the department's director of undergraduate stud
ies, the test comes at a time in which enrollment in in
troductory physics courses has reached record highs.
For instance, enrollment in Physics 41, one of the de
partment's introductory classes, has doubled over the
past five years to include more than 500 students per
class. These students had a wide range of experience in
the subject before coming to Stanford, Manoharan
said.
"We are aware of the situation, and several willing
professors gathered together and established this test,"
he said.
This year, 250 students took the physics placement
test, compared to 116 students who took the chemistry
placement test. The number of students who took the
chemistry placement test, which helps advise students
whether they should enroll in Chemistry 31A or 31X,
was almost the same as it was last year.
"Note that the chemistry test and the physics place
ment tests have different goals," Manoharan said. "The
physics test is trying to properly place students within
an array of many introductory-level courses, plus pro
vide advice on appropriate mathematics to take. The
chemistry placement test is designed for placement
into one of two chemistry courses. Thus, the number of
students taking the physics placement exam is expect
ed to be larger due to the difference in scope."
According to Manoharan, a team of four professors
and one faculty member has been working on develop
ing the placement test for the past year, making sure
that it would accurately reflect a student's ability in the
subject.
"We used the statistics in similar placement tests' re
sults from other universities in the public database of
the National Science Academy," he said. "We exam
ined the relation between questions and student abili-

ties. In addition, we held experimen
tal tests in the Physics 40s and 60s
courses to find out whether these
questions can differentiate students
of various understanding in physics
and math."
The test contains a substantial
amount of mathematics questions,
including vectors and calculus.
Physics professor Patricia Burchat,
who teaches Physics 41, said the
team had approached the math de
partment for assistance in designing
these questions but eventually de
signed the problems themselves in
order to cover the tools needed to
learn in the Physics 40s and 60s se
ries rather than test pure math skills.
The physics department uses stu
dents' test results to objectively
match them with course options
most appropriate to their skill sets.
Sometimes several advising options

are offered for students to choose
from, according to their course
loads and academic interests.
Student opinions on the test var
ied.
"This is just like high school
physics in Taiwan, but it is even eas
ier that they only test the conceptu
al part," said Franklin Liou 'l5 after
taking the test.
However, several other students
noted that there were some mathe
matical and physical operations that
had not been covered in AP Calcu
lus AB and AP Physics B courses.
Manoharan said that regardless
of a student's placement test result,
the physics department hopes the
exam will help students enjoy
physics at Stanford.
"We hope that the placement
test will help students from all
preparation backgrounds enter,
enjoy and complete physics at Stan
ford with maximum educational
benefit," he said.
