# East Asia Library seeks move
## Etchemendy to present a proposal to Trustees for relocation later this month 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Provost John Etchemendy will seek ap
proval for a proposal to transfer the con
tents of Meyer Library to the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) South Building
at this month's Board of Trustees meeting,
according to library communications direc
tor Andrew Herkovic.
Etchemendy's decision came after the
University carried out a cost-benefit analy
sis, which was completed during the begin
ning of the summer. The analysis showed
that the space was a suitable replacement
for Meyer considering technical factors
such as the building's energy costs, seismic
issues and suitability to house the library's
various components, Herkovic said.

"[GSB South] was deemed both feasible
and within the economic limits that the
Provost had in mind," Herkovic said. He
added that while the decision awaits ap
proval from the Board of Trustees, he "imag
ine [s] that it will happen."
Under the proposal, all of Meyer's con
tents — with the exception of a general
books collection in the basement, which is
more closely associated with Green Library
will be moved into the new space. This in
cludes the library's technical staff, academic
computing services, classroom space that is
used by the registrar and the East Asia Li
brary, which currently has offices on the
fourth floor of Meyer and a small portion of
its collection in the basement.
Herkovic said that because the GSB
South space allows for more shelving

room, the move would allow the Universi
ty to reunite the East Asia Library with
some of its works that are currently being
held in auxiliary libraries. However, given
that the collection is the fastest-growing on
campus, he said the new building would
only be able to accommodate a certain
amount of this projected growth.
The need for a new space arose back in
2007 when Meyer Library was deemed "seis
mically unsafe" and scheduled for demoli
tion. The Academic Council Committee on
Libraries (C-LIB) convened two subsequent
subcommittees one spearheaded by art
history professor Michael Marrinan and the
other headed by history professor Matthew
Sommer —to look into the issue of lost

shelving space following Meyer's de
mise, as well as the future of printed
materials in general at Stanford.
After studying the questions
raised by its subcommittees' reports,
C-LIB was on the verge of filing a re
port, which would have recommend
ed that the University construct a
new, freestanding building east of
Green Library East. The GSB's move
to Knight Management Center, how
ever, left the old Jackson Business Li
brary, as well as the rest of the South
building, vacant. Herkovic said the
space became "a solution very late in
the game."
According to Herkovic, the Stan
ford libraries had "little assurance"
that the University would ever au
thorize the construction of a new
building for the East Asia Library be

cause of limitations on growth im
posed by Santa Clara County. The li
braries had started looking into the
possibility of moving the collection
into existing spaces within Green Li
brary, but found that this would have
been "very disruptive to all the hu
manistic and social science scholars
on campus."
"[GSB South] feels like a last
minute rescue to me," Herkovic said.
C-LIB chair John Bender said
that while GSB South is a "satisfacto
ry alternative," the faculty commit
tee still recommends that a new
building be constructed east of
Green East.
"A new building would be de
signed specifically for the needs of
the faculty and students and the staff
who would support them," Bender
said. "It would be a fundraising op
portunity with regard to the East
Asia Library, and it would open the
potential for new kinds of spaces that
we don't now have."
In particular, Bender said that
past reports have recommended the
creation of "research modules,"
where faculty could work for three to
four years at a time and keep all of
their research materials assembled in
one place.
Despite these concerns, he said,
"the library committee is prepared to
accept this move to GSB South as a
satisfactory solution while hoping that
we will eventually see a new building."
When that new building will be a
reality remains unclear. At last Febru
ary's Faculty Senate meeting,
Etchemendy said GSB South had "20
and maybe even 30 years of life
left in it."
One benefit of the relocation to
GSB South is the potential to turn a
space that was originally a business

school cafe into a combination of a
food-services operation and a 24-hour
study space, according to Bender.
Herkovic, however said that the plan
the Provost forwarded to the Board of
Trustees excluded this food-service
area.
"It is out of the scope of the
scheme, which leaves the question of
whether there will be food service
there or not," Herkovic said. "The plan
is silent on that."
The University estimates the relo
cation would cost more than $5O mil
lion and hopes to gain the backing of a
donor to support the project.
"We are hopeful that for the East
Asia Library in particular that there
will be some very attractive naming
opportunities," Herkovic said. "We
have been talking for years with some
very distinguished people within the
East Asian community about naming
spaces within the East Asia Library,
which wasn't going to happen if we
were going to tear it down. So this cre
ates some opportunities for us."
If the Board of Trustees approves
the plan, the University will commis
sion final drawings and start the
process of selecting contractors and
bidding. Construction would begin in
early 2013, and the space would be
ready for occupancy in the summer of
2014. At that point, Meyer would be
scheduled for demolition.
"I'm just very delighted that this
has come this far," Herkovic said. "It's
sort of a new chapter for the library,
which has been losing spaces. We lost
the physics library last year, and this is
the first real sense of renewal and
growth that we've had for some years
now."

Provost John Etchemendy will seek ap
proval for a proposal to transfer the con
tents of Meyer Library to the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) South Building
at this month's Board of Trustees meeting,
according to library communications direc
tor Andrew Herkovic.
Etchemendy's decision came after the
University carried out a cost-benefit analy
sis, which was completed during the begin
ning of the summer. The analysis showed
that the space was a suitable replacement
for Meyer considering technical factors
such as the building's energy costs, seismic
issues and suitability to house the library's
various components, Herkovic said.

"[GSB South] was deemed both feasible
and within the economic limits that the
Provost had in mind," Herkovic said. He
added that while the decision awaits ap
proval from the Board of Trustees, he "imag
ine [s] that it will happen."
Under the proposal, all of Meyer's con
tents — with the exception of a general
books collection in the basement, which is
more closely associated with Green Library
will be moved into the new space. This in
cludes the library's technical staff, academic
computing services, classroom space that is
used by the registrar and the East Asia Li
brary, which currently has offices on the
fourth floor of Meyer and a small portion of
its collection in the basement.
Herkovic said that because the GSB
South space allows for more shelving

room, the move would allow the Universi
ty to reunite the East Asia Library with
some of its works that are currently being
held in auxiliary libraries. However, given
that the collection is the fastest-growing on
campus, he said the new building would
only be able to accommodate a certain
amount of this projected growth.
The need for a new space arose back in
2007 when Meyer Library was deemed "seis
mically unsafe" and scheduled for demoli
tion. The Academic Council Committee on
Libraries (C-LIB) convened two subsequent
subcommittees one spearheaded by art
history professor Michael Marrinan and the
other headed by history professor Matthew
Sommer —to look into the issue of lost

shelving space following Meyer's de
mise, as well as the future of printed
materials in general at Stanford.
After studying the questions
raised by its subcommittees' reports,
C-LIB was on the verge of filing a re
port, which would have recommend
ed that the University construct a
new, freestanding building east of
Green Library East. The GSB's move
to Knight Management Center, how
ever, left the old Jackson Business Li
brary, as well as the rest of the South
building, vacant. Herkovic said the
space became "a solution very late in
the game."
According to Herkovic, the Stan
ford libraries had "little assurance"
that the University would ever au
thorize the construction of a new
building for the East Asia Library be

cause of limitations on growth im
posed by Santa Clara County. The li
braries had started looking into the
possibility of moving the collection
into existing spaces within Green Li
brary, but found that this would have
been "very disruptive to all the hu
manistic and social science scholars
on campus."
"[GSB South] feels like a last
minute rescue to me," Herkovic said.
C-LIB chair John Bender said
that while GSB South is a "satisfacto
ry alternative," the faculty commit
tee still recommends that a new
building be constructed east of
Green East.
"A new building would be de
signed specifically for the needs of
the faculty and students and the staff
who would support them," Bender
said. "It would be a fundraising op
portunity with regard to the East
Asia Library, and it would open the
potential for new kinds of spaces that
we don't now have."
In particular, Bender said that
past reports have recommended the
creation of "research modules,"
where faculty could work for three to
four years at a time and keep all of
their research materials assembled in
one place.
Despite these concerns, he said,
"the library committee is prepared to
accept this move to GSB South as a
satisfactory solution while hoping that
we will eventually see a new building."
When that new building will be a
reality remains unclear. At last Febru
ary's Faculty Senate meeting,
Etchemendy said GSB South had "20
and maybe even 30 years of life
left in it."
One benefit of the relocation to
GSB South is the potential to turn a
space that was originally a business

school cafe into a combination of a
food-services operation and a 24-hour
study space, according to Bender.
Herkovic, however said that the plan
the Provost forwarded to the Board of
Trustees excluded this food-service
area.
"It is out of the scope of the
scheme, which leaves the question of
whether there will be food service
there or not," Herkovic said. "The plan
is silent on that."
The University estimates the relo
cation would cost more than $5O mil
lion and hopes to gain the backing of a
donor to support the project.
"We are hopeful that for the East
Asia Library in particular that there
will be some very attractive naming
opportunities," Herkovic said. "We
have been talking for years with some
very distinguished people within the
East Asian community about naming
spaces within the East Asia Library,
which wasn't going to happen if we
were going to tear it down. So this cre
ates some opportunities for us."
If the Board of Trustees approves
the plan, the University will commis
sion final drawings and start the
process of selecting contractors and
bidding. Construction would begin in
early 2013, and the space would be
ready for occupancy in the summer of
2014. At that point, Meyer would be
scheduled for demolition.
"I'm just very delighted that this
has come this far," Herkovic said. "It's
sort of a new chapter for the library,
which has been losing spaces. We lost
the physics library last year, and this is
the first real sense of renewal and
growth that we've had for some years
now."
