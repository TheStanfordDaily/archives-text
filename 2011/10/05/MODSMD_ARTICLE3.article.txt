# East Asia Library seeks move
## Etchemendy to present a proposal to Trustees for relocation later this month 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Provost John Etchemendy will seek ap
proval for a proposal to transfer the con
tents of Meyer Library to the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) South Building
at this month's Board of Trustees meeting,
according to library communications direc
tor Andrew Herkovic.
Etchemendy's decision came after the
University carried out a cost-benefit analy
sis, which was completed during the begin
ning of the summer. The analysis showed
that the space was a suitable replacement
for Meyer considering technical factors
such as the building's energy costs, seismic
issues and suitability to house the library's
various components, Herkovic said.

"[GSB South] was deemed both feasible
and within the economic limits that the
Provost had in mind," Herkovic said. He
added that while the decision awaits ap
proval from the Board of Trustees, he "imag
ine [s] that it will happen."
Under the proposal, all of Meyer's con
tents — with the exception of a general
books collection in the basement, which is
more closely associated with Green Library
will be moved into the new space. This in
cludes the library's technical staff, academic
computing services, classroom space that is
used by the registrar and the East Asia Li
brary, which currently has offices on the
fourth floor of Meyer and a small portion of
its collection in the basement.
Herkovic said that because the GSB
South space allows for more shelving

room, the move would allow the Universi
ty to reunite the East Asia Library with
some of its works that are currently being
held in auxiliary libraries. However, given
that the collection is the fastest-growing on
campus, he said the new building would
only be able to accommodate a certain
amount of this projected growth.
The need for a new space arose back in
2007 when Meyer Library was deemed "seis
mically unsafe" and scheduled for demoli
tion. The Academic Council Committee on
Libraries (C-LIB) convened two subsequent
subcommittees one spearheaded by art
history professor Michael Marrinan and the
other headed by history professor Matthew
Sommer —to look into the issue of lost

Meyer Library was deemed seismically unsafe in 2007 during a campus retrofit study, and was later scheduled for demolition. Provost
John Etchemendy plans to seek approval from the Board of Trustees this month to relocate Meyer's contents to Jackson Library.
