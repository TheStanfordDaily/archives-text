## Senate debates ASSU budget bill 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The 13th Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed at length the particulars of the
ASSU budget, especially issues regarding
executive cabinet compensation, at the
Senate's marathon, three-hour meeting
Tuesday night.
Much of the meeting was spent dis
cussing the five-page budget, which in
cludes several significant increases from

last year in certain areas of spending, as
well as cuts to others.
Several senators questioned a 31-per
cent increase in the ASSU presidential
discretionary spending, which ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 defended.
Cruz noted that the $4,000 increase to
an approximate $17,000 for general presi
dential discretionary funds included
$1,500 that had been folded in from a line
item called "campus traditions," which
was completely cut from this year's presi

dential discretionary spending.
Senators also raised questions about
executive compensation, especially for
cabinet members. Though Cruz and Mac
gregor-Dennis' salaries which are
$8,750 and $8,500 respectively, in addition
to the $2,750 total summer stipend for
both of them weren't questioned, Sen
ator Janani Ramachandran 'l4 seriously
questioned the $16,000 dollars specified
for cabinet members' salaries.
Cruz noted that cabinet mem
bers were hired with the under
standing that they would be paid.
"It's understood to be a rule, and
these stipends are smaller than
those paid to senate leadership po
sitions," Cruz said.
The Senate Chair is currently
paid $3,000, the Deputy Chair is
paid $l,OOO and the Senate Secre
tary is paid $BOO.
Ramachandran, who is not cur
rently paid a stipend as a senator,
argued that while she wasn't com
plaining about not getting paid, it
bothered her that the amount of
money set aside for personal com
pensation stipends for the ASSU
Executive $36,000 is more
than half of the total ASSU Execu
tive budget $64,532 which is
more than all other spending pro
grams combined.
While discussing the new execu
tive cabinet, which has 42 members,
Senator Nate Garcia 'l3 also ex
pressed frustration with the size of
the new executive cabinet, saying
he felt like senators were getting
caught in a "big web."
When it came down to the vote
however, only Ramachandran ab
stained. After the meeting Ra
machandran declined to comment
on her abstention.
In addition to the budget discus
sions, much of the discussion fo
cused on the newly established De
partment of Internal Review
(DIR), which was created this year
as away to evaluate the processes
and committees of the ASSU. A bill
concerning DIR parameters was

eventually tabled for further dis
cussion at a later date, failing to
pass a vote after Senators Ben
Laufer and Alon Elhanan raised
concerns over DlR's organization
and reporting procedures.
Further discussion will focus on
maintaining the department's inde
pendence from ASSU pressure
while also making sure the DIR has
enough access to internal records
and procedures.
One bill, which occupied an
hour of discussion, was whether or
not the Senate should authorize
Cruz to write a letter on behalf of
the ASSU to support holistic ad
mission processes in the state of
California. This letter would be in
response to SB 185, a bill passed by
the California legislature which
would allow California schools to
make admission decisions based
on, among other criteria, race, eth
nicity, gender and national origin.
The bill is currently awaiting a deci
sion from Brown.
The Senate decided to change
the language of the bill to not di
rectly support SB 185 since student
opinion on the bill is varied. In
stead, the Senate authorized Cruz
to write a letter to Governor Jerry
Brown supporting Stanford's own
holistic admissions processes and
encouraging admissions offices to
use them in California public
schools.
At the conclusion of the meet
ing, the Senate passed a solution
supporting the California DREAM
Act, which seeks to provide in-state
tuition and access to financial aid at
public universities for students, re
gardless of the status of their docu
mentation. The measure passed
unanimously.
