### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The 13th Undergraduate Senate dis
cussed at length the particulars of the
ASSU budget, especially issues regarding
executive cabinet compensation, at the
Senate's marathon, three-hour meeting
Tuesday night.
Much of the meeting was spent dis
cussing the five-page budget, which in
cludes several significant increases from

last year in certain areas of spending, as
well as cuts to others.
Several senators questioned a 31-per
cent increase in the ASSU presidential
discretionary spending, which ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2 defended.
Cruz noted that the $4,000 increase to
an approximate $17,000 for general presi
dential discretionary funds included
$1,500 that had been folded in from a line
item called "campus traditions," which
was completely cut from this year's presi

dential discretionary spending.
Senators also raised questions about
executive compensation, especially for
cabinet members. Though Cruz and Mac
gregor-Dennis' salaries which are
$8,750 and $8,500 respectively, in addition
to the $2,750 total summer stipend for
both of them weren't questioned, Sen
ator Janani Ramachandran 'l4 seriously
questioned the $16,000 dollars specified
