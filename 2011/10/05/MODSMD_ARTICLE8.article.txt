# Mother's diet could reduce chance of birth defects, study finds
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Women have a lower risk of hav
ing children with birth defects if they
eat healthier in the year before be
coming pregnant, according to a
study published on Monday by re
searchers at the School of Medicine
in the Archives of Pediatrics & Ado
lescent Medicine.
The researchers used data from
10,000 women with due dates from
October 1997 through 2005 and
looked at the overall quality of their
diets in the year leading up to their
pregnancy. They compared the
women's food intakes to either a
Mediterranean-style diet or a diet
that closely adhered to U.S. Dietary
Guidelines. Both of these diets are
high in fruits, vegetables, grain, calci
um, iron and folate and low in
sugars and fats.
The women who ranked highest
in following these dietary patterns
were less likely to give birth to chil
dren with neural tube defects or oro
facial clefts. These findings persisted
even when the researchers adjusted
for potential confounding effects,
such as the mother taking additional
vitamin or mineral supplements.
This study differs from previous
research in pre-natal health because
"previous nutrition research on
birth defects has tended to focus on
one nutrient at a time," the authors
wrote in the paper. The reality, how
ever, is that nutrition is much more
complex, they said.
