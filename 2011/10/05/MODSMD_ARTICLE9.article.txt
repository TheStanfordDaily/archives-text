# Study eyes EP4 receptors for stroke treatment
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
A School of Medicine study, led
by neurology professor Katrin An
dreasson, suggests that a new treat
ment for strokes could be realized
by focusing on a receptor in nerve
and endothelial cells which, when
simulated, releases a chemical that
helps to dilate blood vessels and im
prove blood flow. The study, per
formed on mice, was published last
Monday in the online Journal of
Clinical Investigation.
The study started by investigat
ing a class of drugs called COX-2-se
lective inhibitors. Once a spark of
promise within the medical commu
nity, COX-2 selective inhibitors
were believed to have the effects of
aspirin without the stomach pain.
However, the inhibitors ended up
contributing to what it was supposed
to prevent: in clinical trials, those
taking the drug actually experienced
an increased risk of heart attacks
and strokes.
The drug functions as a pain re
liever by helping to hinder the pro
duction of a type of messenger mol
ecule called prostaglandin.
Prostaglandins travel from cell to
cell, triggering different activities
within the cells they land on and
bind to. One specific type of
prostaglandin, called PGE2, is
linked to causing pain and inflam
mation. In a School of Medicine
press release, Andreasson said that
her team wanted to see why COX-2-
selective inhibitors caused strokes
instead of curbing them.
They discovered that PGE2 has
four different receptors, and one of
these, EP4, causes an increase of ni
tric oxide, a chemical that helps to
relax blood muscles and enhance
blood flow, when activated. Mice
which were injected with EP4 three
hours after a stroke experienced less
brain damage.
"We showed that activating this
single receptor, EP4, three hours
after a stroke not only diminishes
the volume of a mouse's affected
brain tissue but also enhances the
mouse's functional recovery," An
dreasson said in the statement. "And
we've taken this a step further by
diligently unraveling the mecha
nisms by which that happens."
