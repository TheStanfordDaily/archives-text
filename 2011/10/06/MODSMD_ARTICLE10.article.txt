# New Stanford math formula predicts success of cancer therapy
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine recently found that com
putational biology can be used to
determine the rate of how human
lung tumors respond to initial treat
ment. Scientists discovered that the
success of therapies targeting can
cer-causing genes is due to their
ability to slow the speed of tumor
cell division. By targeting particular
cancer genes, researchers are now
able to respond with appropriate

therapy. Oncogene addiction occurs
when the presence of cancer is de
pendent on a single cancer-causing
gene. Cancer tumors of this nature
regress with oncogene-targeted
treatment. Stanford researchers
have shown that oncogene-targeted
therapies eradicate the addicted tu
mors by reducing survival signals. A
cell's life is dependent on the bal
ance of life or death signals. The sur
vival signals allow the death signals
to continue.

The equation developed corre
lates changes in death signals with
tumor regression rates. Based on
the newly developed formula, a pa
tient with an oncogene-addicted
tumor will have a different rate of
regression than a patient with a non
addicted tumor. TTie formula helped
predict which patients had onco
gene-addicted tumors based on the
rate of tumor regression from thera
py. This new formula can help deter
mine what treatment will work best
for particular cancer patients. While
the focus of the research was on lung
cancer, Stanford researchers hope to
extend the formula's predictive suc
cess to other forms of cancer.
