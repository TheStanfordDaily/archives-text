## PROFILE SAHAMI'S QUIRKY TEACHING A DRAW FOR STUDENTS 
### KYLE GSCHWEND 
It's 3:10 p.m., Monday afternoon. Over 600 stu
dents are crammed into Hewlett 200 like canned
sardines. The students who arrived 20 minutes
earlier are fortunate enough to find seats. Other
students must seat themselves in the aisles. The
rumble of animated chatter dies down when they are
all greeted by an energetic, bespectacled man asso
ciate professor of computer science Mehran Sahami
'92, M.S. '93, Ph.D. '99.
Sahami has attained mythical status on campus for
his teaching ability, but few students are aware of the
origins of his passion for computing and teaching.
It all started in fifth grade.
"My class got a Commodore PET," Sahami said, re
ferring to a personal computer produced in the late
1970s and early 80s. Interestingly enough, the PET
failed to kindle Sahami's interest in computing. Saha
mi's fascination with computing remained latent until
his matriculation to Stanford in 1987, where he en
rolled in CSIO6A.
He took CSIO6A with former computer science lec
turer Stuart Reges M.S. 'B2, "and [that] was the mo
ment I rediscovered my passion for computing," Saha
mi said.
Sahami's own experience with CSIO6A also
sparked his interest in teaching.
"Stuart Reges made me realize that teaching could
be a career, and that really excited me," Sahami said.
He credited associate professor of computer sci
ence Daphne Roller Ph.D. '94, who served as his doc
toral advisor, and computer science professor Eric
Roberts, for providing direction in his studies and
teaching philosophy.
After earning his bachelor's, master's and doctorate
degrees in computer science from Stanford, Sahami

took a break from academia to enter the software in
dustry, where he first worked as a senior engineering
manager at Epiphany and then as a senior research sci
entist at Google.
But industry wasn't his calling.
"I decided that if the opportunity to come back and
teach at Stanford was given, I would take it," Sahami
said.
In 2001, Sahami joined the Stanford computer sci
ence department as a lecturer. He held the position

until 2006, when he was subsequently made an associ
ate professor as well as the department's associate
chair for teaching.
In 2008, Sahami chaired the committee tasked with
revising the curriculum for the computer science major
to reflect the evolution of the field, increasing the flex
ibility and options for students to take as part of the
major and promoting more multi-disciplinary work to
highlight the connections of computer science to other
fields.
Sahami is famed for not only his ebullient style of lec
turing, but also for rewarding students who participate
in lecture with candy. To say that professor Sahami em
ploys an unorthodox teaching style is an understate
ment; but there seems to be a clear method behind it.
"What I try to do with the candy and other tech
niques are to get and keep the students engaged in
what I'm teaching," Sahami said. "Research shows that
when students are actively participating in class they
are more likely to retain information that is present
ed."
Sahami's teaching approach is also his method of
addressing a common teaching problem present in
large lecture classes.
"I am trying to break the invisible wall between my
self and the students," Sahami said. "Unfortunately,
[the wall] is what happens in many lecture classes
where the professor drones on and the students just re
ceive the information instead of actively processing
and thinking."
Based on student reaction to his teaching, his meth
ods appear to achieve their goals.
"How many professors bring a lightsaber to class?"
said David Arnold 'l3. "He makes the class very laid
back, but we're still learning."
"He's amazing," added Phil Opamuratawongse 'l3.
"I've never had any teacher as cool as him."
