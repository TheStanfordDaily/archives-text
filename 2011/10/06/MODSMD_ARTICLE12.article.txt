## EDITORIAL What the CS Department can teach us 
### 
Of the many trends presently
manifested among Stan
ford students, few are more
readily apparent than the increas
ing popularity of computer science.
With a record-high of over 660 stu
dents enrolled in CSIO6A for fall
quarter, the surfeit of new comput
er science students has begun to
test the limits of Stanford's physical
infrastructure. Explanations for the
growing popularity of computer
science at Stanford typically focus
on the strong performance of tech
nology companies, often local ones,
and the jobs they create, along with
what many characterize as the al
most addictive nature of program
ming itself. Such explanations are
important, but a good deal of cred
it should go to the particular pro
grams and teaching styles em
ployed by Stanford's computer sci
ence department and the atmos
phere that it creates. By borrowing
some of these methods, other de
partments and universities can bet
ter serve students in the future.
In many university courses, inter
action between students and in
structors is confined to one 50-
minute section per week, which can
easily grow too large to allow most
attendees to participate. By employ
ing a large number of undergradu
ate section leaders, the computer
science department is able to pro
vide students with small sections as
well as weekly one-on-one sessions
where homework is discussed. Sec
tion leaders also take turns staffing
the Tresidder Lair computing clus
ter, which offers students help on
homework assignments late into the
night. The system serves a dual ben

efit, giving students lots of personal
attention and section leaders an op
portunity to refine their skills and
progress in the field.
Students at Stanford who de
cide to pursue computer science
find many opportunities for work
open to them right in the depart
ment, often before their second
year of study. Whether through sec
tion leading or summer research,
early work experience lures
prospective students and keeps
current ones focused on their pro
gramming work. Though virtually
all of Stanford's academic depart
ments offer opportunities for work,
the computer science department
generally seems to accommodate
more of its students and does so
earlier in their careers.
Earlier this year, Stanford's
computer science department
began offering three courses to the
public for free on the Internet with
full interactive grading and confer
ral of a "statement of accomplish
ment" upon completion. The most
popular of the courses, dealing with
artificial intelligence, saw over
58,000 people enroll. By offering a
verifiable achievement less than a
degree but still bearing the credibil
ity of a major university name, this
formula offers a promising avenue
towards the democratization of ed
ucation. It also helps to foster the at
mosphere of openness and cooper
ation that helps make Stanford
computer science successful. When
a class receives national news cov
erage and 58,000 enrollees, who
wouldn't at least be interested?

As the cost of a college educa
tion rises ever higher and pundits
debate the existence and size of the
"higher education bubble," univer
sities and academic departments
across the country would do well to
consider what they can do to remain

a good investment of time and
money for their students. In its will
ingness to adopt new methods of
class organization, help students
find interesting work on campus
and advance open education for the
general public, Stanford's computer
science department has set a strong
example. In academia there is an
unfortunate tendency towards com
placency and ossification, but as the
Stanford computer science depart
ment shows, it can be resisted.
