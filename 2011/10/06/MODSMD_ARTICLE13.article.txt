# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## I just came to say "Hello" 
### Leslie Brian 
I've never been more ecstatic to
set foot on campus than this fall:
my last "first day of school" as a
Stanford undergrad. Summers spent
working long and lonely hours at a
cubicle or living abroad without In
ternet access would make anyone
other than a hermit lust for friend
ship; for me, seven months away
from the place that I love sent me
over the edge. I spent the last month
of summer counting down the days
until the start of the quarter, fanta
sizing about all the old friends I
could catch up with and all the new
people I could meet. Life was burst
ing with opportunity.
That first week of school sped by
in a haze of supercharged social en
ergy; we were screaming at each
other from across White Plaza, giv
ing each other giant bear hugs and
booking ourselves solid with catch
up dates. By the end of the week, I
was hoarse from hours of talking,
strung out on caffeine and broke
from Fraiche.
But with week two at a close, the
energy has shifted. That bubbly,
over-the-top enthusiasm goes flat as
we resign ourselves to the daily
grind. Between classes, advisor
meetings, three clubs, tutoring, prob
lem sets, papers and at least a mod
icum of hygiene and sleep, where
does spontaneous social interaction
fit in? When our schedules solidify,
the first thing to go is that same
human connection I, for one, so
craved upon starting school.
My first-day-of-school excite
ment is melting into a sad little pud
dle of insecurity and complacency.
Either I'm just too lazy to walk
across the street to Xanadu, too pre-

occupied with writing this column to
interact with anyone around me
(hmmm, something's wrong with
that picture) or so insecure that
whomever I text either doesn't want
to get together or that once we start
talking there will be nothing to say.
So, I find myself sending phantom
texts to no one while crossing White
Plaza to avoid awkward encounters
with people I know well enough to
say "Hi" to, but not well enough to
engage in full-on conversation.

College is the only
time in our lives
when friends act as
a surrogate family

Suddenly I'm afraid to recon
nect. It's almost as though the
words "Let's grab coffee!" or, "We
really should catch up!" have be
come synonymous with "See you
later!" another sign-off whose
meaning carries no real weight.
Upon parting ways, who knows
whether the other person actually
meant he wanted to connect, or
whether it was just a routine gesture
of politesse?
Aside from insecurities, there
are a whole slew of things that get in
the way of making and keeping
plans. When deadlines loom, can
cellation becomes the default. We
tell ourselves that there will be an
other time later for that coffee, but
let's be real: for the average Stan
ford student, there's never an op
portune moment to spend an hour
or two just catching up.
We're all so damn busy schedul
ing every moment of our lives that

there's no space to breathe in be
tween blocks of time allotted for
this or that. For that matter, after
expending so much energy playing
mental Tetris with our schedules,
who in their right mind would want
to deviate from the plan? If you
haven't been booked into some
one's iCal, good luck catching him
or her at a spare moment! But it is
this very preoccupation with our
schedule that disconnects us from
the present and inhibits us from en
gaging with the here and now.
I'm not saying to avoid your
homework, skip showers or not
apply to grad school. We do go to
Stanford, we are busy and there are
important things that need to get
done. But don't we all need an hour
of wiggle room every day to get dis
tracted by people you haven't "pen
ciled in" or to let yourself stop for
those five-minute impromptu con
versations in the hallways?
Make time for human connec
tion. Make time for the people you
know well, as well as those you
don't. Because at the end of the day,
people are what matter most. That
person you keep meaning to reach

out to? You should. No matter how
much time may have passed, it's
never too late or too awkward. Even
a five-minute conversation goes a
long way, provided you're truly sin
cere and engaged the whole time.
When you ask someone how they
are, mean it! Look them in the eye,
touch them on the shoulder, con
nect with them, if only for a few mo
ments. Those little gestures of empa
thy can change both your day and
theirs more than you know.
College is the only time in our
lives when friends act as a surrogate
family. We are literally surrounded
on a daily basis by 6,800 of the most
amazing people on the face of the
planet. These are the people that
will be changing the world in five or
ten years, and here we are, all living
together. Take advantage of your
four years here to connect with as
many of them as possible. Not doing
so? Now that would be the real
waste of the moment!

Think Leslie is one of those pretty amaz
ing people you'd like to connect with?

I've never been more ecstatic to
set foot on campus than this fall:
my last "first day of school" as a
Stanford undergrad. Summers spent
working long and lonely hours at a
cubicle or living abroad without In
ternet access would make anyone
other than a hermit lust for friend
ship; for me, seven months away
from the place that I love sent me
over the edge. I spent the last month
of summer counting down the days
until the start of the quarter, fanta
sizing about all the old friends I
could catch up with and all the new
people I could meet. Life was burst
ing with opportunity.
That first week of school sped by
in a haze of supercharged social en
ergy; we were screaming at each
other from across White Plaza, giv
ing each other giant bear hugs and
booking ourselves solid with catch
up dates. By the end of the week, I
was hoarse from hours of talking,
strung out on caffeine and broke
from Fraiche.
But with week two at a close, the
energy has shifted. That bubbly,
over-the-top enthusiasm goes flat as
we resign ourselves to the daily
grind. Between classes, advisor
meetings, three clubs, tutoring, prob
lem sets, papers and at least a mod
icum of hygiene and sleep, where
does spontaneous social interaction
fit in? When our schedules solidify,
the first thing to go is that same
human connection I, for one, so
craved upon starting school.
My first-day-of-school excite
ment is melting into a sad little pud
dle of insecurity and complacency.
Either I'm just too lazy to walk
across the street to Xanadu, too pre-

occupied with writing this column to
interact with anyone around me
(hmmm, something's wrong with
that picture) or so insecure that
whomever I text either doesn't want
to get together or that once we start
talking there will be nothing to say.
So, I find myself sending phantom
texts to no one while crossing White
Plaza to avoid awkward encounters
with people I know well enough to
say "Hi" to, but not well enough to
engage in full-on conversation.

Suddenly I'm afraid to recon
nect. It's almost as though the
words "Let's grab coffee!" or, "We
really should catch up!" have be
come synonymous with "See you
later!" another sign-off whose
meaning carries no real weight.
Upon parting ways, who knows
whether the other person actually
meant he wanted to connect, or
whether it was just a routine gesture
of politesse?
Aside from insecurities, there
are a whole slew of things that get in
the way of making and keeping
plans. When deadlines loom, can
cellation becomes the default. We
tell ourselves that there will be an
other time later for that coffee, but
let's be real: for the average Stan
ford student, there's never an op
portune moment to spend an hour
or two just catching up.
We're all so damn busy schedul
ing every moment of our lives that

there's no space to breathe in be
tween blocks of time allotted for
this or that. For that matter, after
expending so much energy playing
mental Tetris with our schedules,
who in their right mind would want
to deviate from the plan? If you
haven't been booked into some
one's iCal, good luck catching him
or her at a spare moment! But it is
this very preoccupation with our
schedule that disconnects us from
the present and inhibits us from en
gaging with the here and now.
I'm not saying to avoid your
homework, skip showers or not
apply to grad school. We do go to
Stanford, we are busy and there are
important things that need to get
done. But don't we all need an hour
of wiggle room every day to get dis
tracted by people you haven't "pen
ciled in" or to let yourself stop for
those five-minute impromptu con
versations in the hallways?
Make time for human connec
tion. Make time for the people you
know well, as well as those you
don't. Because at the end of the day,
people are what matter most. That
person you keep meaning to reach

out to? You should. No matter how
much time may have passed, it's
never too late or too awkward. Even
a five-minute conversation goes a
long way, provided you're truly sin
cere and engaged the whole time.
