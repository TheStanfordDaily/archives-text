# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## I just came to say "Hello" 
### Leslie Brian 
I've never been more ecstatic to
set foot on campus than this fall:
my last "first day of school" as a
Stanford undergrad. Summers spent
working long and lonely hours at a
cubicle or living abroad without In
ternet access would make anyone
other than a hermit lust for friend
ship; for me, seven months away
from the place that I love sent me
over the edge. I spent the last month
of summer counting down the days
until the start of the quarter, fanta
sizing about all the old friends I
could catch up with and all the new
people I could meet. Life was burst
ing with opportunity.
That first week of school sped by
in a haze of supercharged social en
ergy; we were screaming at each
other from across White Plaza, giv
ing each other giant bear hugs and
booking ourselves solid with catch
up dates. By the end of the week, I
was hoarse from hours of talking,
strung out on caffeine and broke
from Fraiche.
But with week two at a close, the
energy has shifted. That bubbly,
over-the-top enthusiasm goes flat as
we resign ourselves to the daily
grind. Between classes, advisor
meetings, three clubs, tutoring, prob
lem sets, papers and at least a mod
icum of hygiene and sleep, where
does spontaneous social interaction
fit in? When our schedules solidify,
the first thing to go is that same
human connection I, for one, so
craved upon starting school.
My first-day-of-school excite
ment is melting into a sad little pud
dle of insecurity and complacency.
Either I'm just too lazy to walk
across the street to Xanadu, too pre-

occupied with writing this column to
interact with anyone around me
(hmmm, something's wrong with
that picture) or so insecure that
whomever I text either doesn't want
to get together or that once we start
talking there will be nothing to say.
So, I find myself sending phantom
texts to no one while crossing White
Plaza to avoid awkward encounters
with people I know well enough to
say "Hi" to, but not well enough to
engage in full-on conversation.

College is the only
time in our lives
when friends act as
a surrogate family
