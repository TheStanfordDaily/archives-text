# Do's AND Doo-Doo's
## Discovering what is enough 
### Chase Ishii 
Hey Stanford! Here's some
more pseudo-advice to help
you get through your Thurs
day!
DO: Be satisfied and happy.
DOO-DOO: Climb the "ladder
of success" to be satisfied and
happy.
I love telling people I was a pole
vaulter in high school. There is
something about watching the im
mediate "I call bullshit" laugh slow
ly fade into a hesitant, skeptical
"Oh,-I-think-he-might-be-serious"
look and eventually settle in a social
squirm of the body and tongue.
"That's surprising wait, not sur
prising. Well it's not surprising that
you were a pole-vaulter, just that
pole vaulting, huh? That's c 001...
I'm going to leave now."
What I don't tell them is that I
wasn't a very good pole-vaulter at
all. The only reason I was on the
team was because it was a "no-cuts"
team. Apparently there's no track
event where even a 5-foot, 100-
pound noodle of a person has a dis
advantage.
It wasn't just physical stature
that kept me from being a star ath
lete, I lacked the attitude as well
(along with everything else that

makes someone a star athlete). All
the best athletes have this no-non
sense, never-satisfied mentality that
drives them to the highest level of
success. I don't know what you
would classify my specific mentality
as, but I got disqualified from com
petition for wearing a cape. (Twice).
I had friends on the team who
were real track stars. They were the
athletes that got to stand on the
podium in the middle of the field at
the end of the track meet. They
were the athletes that got their pic
tures in the paper. They were the
athletes that every parent was se
cretly watching when they were
supposed to be videotaping their
own kid.
But more often than not, they
were the athletes that left every
meet disappointed and discontent.
No matter how fast they ran, they
could always go faster. No matter
how high they jumped, the bar
would always be set higher. Win
ning the race, clearing the bar or
wearing the gold was no longer
enough.
I think there is a similar mindset
at Stanford, a campus full of over
achievers so competent at over
achieving that we make it look like

regular achieving. We wrap our
identity and our worth in our ac
complishments.
"It's not enough to just be a doc
tor; I need to be going to the num
ber one medical school." "It's not
enough to just be a student; I need
to be starting dozens of clubs while
juggling 20 units and a dance team."
Nobody is saying this out loud, but
everyone is saying this in one way or
another.
This raises the most important
question anyone will ever ask you.
(Bold. Arrogant. Probably incor
rect, but now you're paying atten
tion.) What is enough? What ac
complishment or status, once
yours, will leave you completely
satisfied? If you don't know what
is enough, you'll never know when
you reach it.

I'm learning that it is a danger
ous myth to believe ultimate satis
faction exists at the top of the lad
der of success. It's a dangerous
myth to believe there is a top to
reach.
I spent my first week this quarter
planning out my classes so I could
graduate two quarters early. I
thought that the sooner I got out of
Stanford, the sooner I could get to
LA and start working in the film in
dustry. Once I had a job or sold a
script, I would be happy; that would
be enough. And in that first week, I
was completely miserable, I can't
see the future, but I can only imag
ine that even if everything went as
planned and I reached that level of
"enough," it would not be enough.

The more I focused on every
thing I hadn't accomplished, the
smaller and more worthless I felt.
The more I viewed contentment
and satisfaction as something to be
attained in the future, the less I was
able to see it around me in the pres
ent. From personal experience, I've
learned that the quickest way to
curb the unquenchable thirst for
success is with gratitude and humil
ity. Recently, I've been trying to
focus and be thankful for the things
I have and the opportunities I've
been given. When I lose sight of
what I have, I get bogged down by
everything I don't have. But when I
focus on what I already have, I find
it tends to be enough.
I never really cared how well I
did in track, and I loved every sec
ond of it.
