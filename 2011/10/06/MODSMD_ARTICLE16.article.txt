## Person 2.0: Wild self-actualization at Stanford 
### STEWART MACGREGOR-DENNIS '13 ASSU Vice President 
A key difference between
Stanford and the "Stan
fords" of the East Coast is
that a much larger proportion of
our students go into unconvention
al career paths straight after gradu
ation. I think this is awesome. At
Stanford, we're encouraged to pur
sue wild self-actualization in a
plethora of forms. In the spirit of
this tradition, I'd like to explore
one of the archetypes embracing
this wild self-actualization.
I'd like to explore the life
hacker.
I woke up at 9:45 a.m. to my
alarm after eight hours and 15 min
utes of sleep, turned off the sleep
enhancing rain music emanating
from my laptop, ate one and a half
bowls of high-fiber, low-carb cere
al with once-a-day multivitamin
and Omega-3 capsules from 9:46

a.m. to 9:53 a.m., speed-read arti
cles on Google Reader for seven
minutes, then showered for nine
minutes. I logged in my iPhone
leaving Synergy at 10:13 a.m. I
made a note in my journal to park
my bike on the other side of the
bike rack in the future for more
efficient access. I biked down the
Row listening to a TED Talks pod
cast. I sat down when I got to class,
checked analytics on my computer
usage from the day before on Res
cue Time, which automatically logs
any activity and opened Evernote
to review recent goals and lessons
in the computer science section of
my "academics" notebook. I then
set my iPhone to airplane mode to
allow myself to be totally present
and launched Concentrate, which
I'd set up to open required applica
tions, block off distractions and

send me regular supportive mes
sages throughout the lecture say
ing, "This class is valuable for your
personal growth!" After an hour
and 15 minutes of class, I opened
my Omnifocus and reviewed my
to-dos. I was with my computer, so
I decided to execute action steps
for the day filtered by the "Email"
context, which included checking
up on tasks I'd recently outsourced
through oDesk. It was a good day; I
had two hours and 45 minutes of
recreational time!
Just another day in the life of a
lifehacker. Throw away what you
previously thought was possible.
Re-envision what you can accom
plish. Turn over the page in your
journal and write a new heading:
Part 2.0.
A decade ago, I was the skinny,
socially awkward kid with reading
disabilities who didn't stand a
chance. While I may still be the
quirky kid, the tough path to Stan
ford is why I get so pumped about
people realizing their potential.
This is the call to action: be bold in
the pursuit of your ideal self.
A small contingent of friends
and I have recently been looking to
push the boundaries of lifehacker
style self-actualization. We're shar
ing lessons and aiming to create a
totally immersive environment that
will take us towards actualization.
With the knowledge that you
are what you measure, we're trying
out quantified-self, where you
measure so much more than just

grades think: time, food, weight,
exercise, learning, productivity,
communication, computer activity.
We're open-sourcing our lives to
create instant feedback loops.
Knowing that you can only truly
know 150 people, we're listing the
people who we really want to forge
relationships with. We're making
introspection a continual process,
taking journal notes after each in
teraction. We're developing our
unconscious intuition through pat
tern recognizing looking
through everything from different
types of art, facial expression, to
worldly success. We're brainstorm
ing, using design thinking, Six Hats
and lateral thinking to take our
thought processes to the next level.
We're aiming for polymathic
knowledge by speed-reading
Wikipedia, online resources and
classic works. We're embracing
Renaissance-style learning of the
humanities, a social science in

formed view of people and an en
gineering underpinned world
view. We're embracing social
media platforms as away to iterate
on personal brand, develop a dis
tinctive voice and crowdsource
feedback. We're using Strength
s Quest and Myers-Briggs to opti
mize around our current strengths.
Above all else, we're embracing
the attitude of relentless self-im
provement. This is just the begin
ning.
You have incredible potential,
yet it's up to you to realize it. Be
coming a lifehacker is just one of
myriad ways to self-actualize. Find
the one that resonates with you
and embrace it. I care about your
self-actualization because others
cared about mine. You have your
ideal self to lose and the world to
change.

A decade ago, I was the skinny,
socially awkward kid with reading
disabilities who didn't stand a
chance. While I may still be the
quirky kid, the tough path to Stan
ford is why I get so pumped about
people realizing their potential.
This is the call to action: be bold in
the pursuit of your ideal self.
A small contingent of friends
and I have recently been looking to
push the boundaries of lifehacker
style self-actualization. We're shar
ing lessons and aiming to create a
totally immersive environment that
will take us towards actualization.
With the knowledge that you
are what you measure, we're trying
out quantified-self, where you
measure so much more than just

grades think: time, food, weight,
exercise, learning, productivity,
communication, computer activity.
We're open-sourcing our lives to
create instant feedback loops.
Knowing that you can only truly
know 150 people, we're listing the
people who we really want to forge
relationships with. We're making
introspection a continual process,
taking journal notes after each in
teraction. We're developing our
unconscious intuition through pat
tern recognizing looking
through everything from different
types of art, facial expression, to
worldly success. We're brainstorm
ing, using design thinking, Six Hats
and lateral thinking to take our
thought processes to the next level.
We're aiming for polymathic
knowledge by speed-reading
Wikipedia, online resources and
classic works. We're embracing
Renaissance-style learning of the
humanities, a social science in

formed view of people and an en
gineering underpinned world
view. We're embracing social
media platforms as away to iterate
on personal brand, develop a dis
tinctive voice and crowdsource
feedback. We're using Strength
s Quest and Myers-Briggs to opti
mize around our current strengths.
Above all else, we're embracing
the attitude of relentless self-im
provement. This is just the begin
ning.
You have incredible potential,
yet it's up to you to realize it. Be
coming a lifehacker is just one of
myriad ways to self-actualize. Find
the one that resonates with you
and embrace it. I care about your
self-actualization because others
cared about mine. You have your
ideal self to lose and the world to
change.
