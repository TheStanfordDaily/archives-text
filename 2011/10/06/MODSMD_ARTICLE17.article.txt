## A
						GOLDEN CHANCE Cold Card offense tries to wake up against Cal 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
A sellout crowd is already expected to fill the
stands at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium on Sunday when
the men's soccer team takes on California, but much
more than mere bragging rights will be on the line in
this year's annual clash.
Both teams had nearly identical, and somewhat
disappointing, starts to the conference season the
Cardinal (3-6-1, 0-2 Pac-12) and Bears (3-4-2, 0-2)
both dropped two games on the road at San Diego
State and UCLA last weekend and the loser of
this weekend's matchup faces an uphill climb to the
postseason with just seven games to play.
Stanford lost three straight games to open the
season, but swept Harvard and Vermont in the Stan
ford Nike Classic to move just a game under .500 at
the start of conference play. But since junior Dersu
Abolfathi knocked in the game winner early in the
second half against the Catamounts, the Cardinal has
failed to score a single goal a drought of over 222
minutes.
Freshman forward Zach Batteer said that a com
bination of factors has slowed the offense, which has
already been shut out six times and has scored just
eight goals through the first 10 games of the season.
"The biggest challenge in road games is always
the travel and how hard it is to win away from home,"
Batteer said. "But specifically against San Diego
State, I missed a few chances that could've put us
ahead, and we weren't able to put together all the
pieces that are necessary to win a tough conference
match."
Cal's offense hasn't struggled quite as much, as
the Golden Bears have 12 goals in nine games, but
their defense has been very porous, conceding four
goals in a game twice already and 14 goals overall.
That could mean plenty of opportunities for jun
iors Adam Jahn, Eric Anderson and Abolfathi to
continue their success on the attacking end. Jahn and
Abolfathi are tied for the team lead with two goals
apiece, and Anderson has a team-high three assists
from his new position on the Cardinal's left flank.
Coach Bret Simon says the team isn't having trou
ble creating chances, but rather hasn't been able to
capitalize in the clutch.
"We've been creating a fair number of goal-scor
ing chances, so we're spending time in training repli
cating situations we've been seeing in games," he

Senior midfielder Clayton Holz (above) and the Cardinal have been struggling offensively for
the past few games, but have a good chance to break the slump against Cal this Sunday.
