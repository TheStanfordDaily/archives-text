# A 						few simple rules before you black out
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
After this weekend's football game
against UCLA, it became apparent to
me that Stanford needs a lesson in how
to black out correctly.
No, overeager freshmen, this isn't another part
of AlcoholEDU. I mean that Stanford football
needs to make better use of those fantastic black
jerseys. Everyone knows that black jerseys are

popular nowadays even teams without black
in their color scheme are adopting dark uniforms
but even though the Cardinal has now worn
black uniforms two years in a row, it hasn't been
using them correctly. Therefore, we need to estab
lish some important rules for blacking out.
The first rule of wearing alternate jerseys is
this: the team that 's dressing up needs to use them
for an important game. The entire idea of wearing

cool alternate uniforms is to get the team pumped
for a big game that's why Nike makes pro com
bat uniforms for rivalry games like Pitt-West Vir
ginia last season and Adidas made brand-new
uniforms for Michigan-Notre Dame this season.
Take the Georgia Bulldogs for example. Back
in 2007, No. 10 Georgia played host to No. 17
Auburn at home in a rivalry game so
big that it's called "The Deep South's
Oldest Rivalry." The Dawgs came
out wearing black uniforms for the
first time in school history and rolled
to a 45-20 win on their way to a 10-2
season. The players were so pumped
up about wearing new uniforms that
they took their excitement out in a
big game, not a game they were
going to win anyway.
The two times Stanford has worn
black jerseys, it has been against
Wake Forest and UCLA. The com
bined scores of those games were
113-43 in Stanford's favor. Couldn't
that enthusiasm have been better
used against USC, Oregon or Cal?
The second rule is that the team
needs to make sure the fans actually
know about the blackout and partic
ipate in it. Again, this is something
that the 2007 Georgia Bulldogs did
correctly when they did the black
out. Every single fan was wearing
black and going crazy some fans
even painted themselves black from
head to toe. Do yourself a favor and
go watch a few old videos of the
game, and you'll see just how amped
everyone in the stadium is was.
Tlie best example of how to get
your fans involved comes from Penn
State, which stages a "white-out"
game every season. All 106,572 fans
are decked out in white, and I can
only imagine how the opposing team
must feel when they run out into a
blizzard of howling fans.
Stanford has yet to do this cor
rectly both last season and this sea
son. The entire Red Zone and
everybody else shows up wearing
red and white, and is left looking
around quizzically when the speak
ers blast "Back in Black." The team
just looks dumb when they're the

only ones in the stadium wearing
black. It's like showing up to a pool
party wearing a coat and tie. It's not
that it doesn't look good, it just
makes everybody else feel awkward.
The third and most important
rule of coming out decked in
black is that you better back it up.
Remember how great that 2007
Georgia game was and how pumped
up the fans were? Well, the No. 3
Bulldogs tried it again in 2008
against No. 8 Alabama and got
thumped 41-30 in their own house.
The Crimson Tide had talked trash
all week about how Georgia was
wearing black because it was going
to be their funeral, and then the
'Bama fans got to revel gleefully in
bursting the Bulldogs' bubble, leav
ing Georgia not only beaten but also
embarrassed.
So while those fans and play
ers â€” who showed up wearing all
black felt like James Bond when they
walked into the stadium, they un
doubtedly felt like the cover of a Twi
light novel walking out.
So there you have it three very
simple rules that will enhance your
blackout experience. Thankfully, Stan
ford has followed the most important
rule so far and will be wearing cool new
uniforms for a big game against Notre
Dame later this season (because
everyone hates Notre Dame), but
there's still room for improvement.
Perhaps next year, and many years
into the future, the sold-out Stanford
Stadium will be rocking when the Car
dinal puts a bow on another blackout
win, but this time, it'll be over USC.
How sweet would that be?
