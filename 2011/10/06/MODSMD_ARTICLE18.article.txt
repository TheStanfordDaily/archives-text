						few simple rules before you black out

After this weekend's football game
against UCLA, it became apparent to
me that Stanford needs a lesson in how
to black out correctly.
No, overeager freshmen, this isn't another part
of AlcoholEDU. I mean that Stanford football
needs to make better use of those fantastic black
jerseys. Everyone knows that black jerseys are

popular nowadays even teams without black
in their color scheme are adopting dark uniforms
but even though the Cardinal has now worn
black uniforms two years in a row, it hasn't been
using them correctly. Therefore, we need to estab
lish some important rules for blacking out.
The first rule of wearing alternate jerseys is
this: the team that 's dressing up needs to use them
for an important game. The entire idea of wearing

cool alternate uniforms is to get the team pumped
for a big game that's why Nike makes pro com
bat uniforms for rivalry games like Pitt-West Vir
ginia last season and Adidas made brand-new
uniforms for Michigan-Notre Dame this season.
Take the Georgia Bulldogs for example. Back
in 2007, No. 10 Georgia played host to No. 17
