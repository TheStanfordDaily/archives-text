# TRYING TO STAY ON TRACK

### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After a rocky start, the No. 7
Stanford women's volleyball
team is looking to solidify its
spot in the top half of the Pac
-12 this weekend, searching for
its first conference victory out
side of Maples Pavilion and
aiming to extend its win streak
to four matches.
The Cardinal (10-3,4-3 Pac
-12) will hit the road for the first
time since a disastrous two-loss
trip to Southern California,
hoping for better luck up north
against Oregon State on Friday
and No. 15 Oregon on Saturday.
In the series' 52-match histo
ry, the Card has never lost to the
Beavers, a winning tradition it
looks to keep alive at least one
match longer. A young team
with just one senior on its ros
ter, Oregon State (11-5, 3-3)
stands only one spot below
Stanford in the conference
thanks in large part to the play
of junior Camille Saxton and
freshman outside hitter/middle
blocker Arica Nassar.
Saxton, an outside hitter,
ranks tenth in the Pac-12 with
an average of 3.58 kills per set
and fifth with .34 aces or an
ace for every three sets played.
Nassar has been a force at the
net, ninth in the conference
with 1.15 blocks per set, making
her the only freshman to ap
pear in the conference's top ten

blockers. Sophomore libero
Becky Defoe has been equally
solid for the Beavers' back line,
ranking fifth in the conference
with 4.39 digs per set and com
ing close to setting her own
school record with 28 digs in
last weekend's three-set loss at
No. 3 Washington.
Oregon (12-2,5-1), currently
half a game out of first place in
the conference, is one of six
Pac-12 squads ranked in the
top-15 nationally. The Ducks,
who shocked then-No. 1 squad
Penn State with a 3-1 victory in
State College, Penn. earlier this
season, will be looking to re
bound this weekend after suf
fering their first conference loss
to Washington on Sep. 30.
Oregon's impressive offense
fifth in the nation in both as
sists and kills per set will be a
tough match for Stanford's
equally acclaimed defense. As a
team, the Card leads the nation
in blocks per set and leads the
conference in digs, while junior
middle blocker Carly Wopat is
the country's individual block
ing leader with 1.71 per set,
something she attributes to a
renewed mental focus on the
court.
"The key to my early season
success has really been learning
how to outsmart my opponents,
rather than just relying on my
athletic abilities," she said.

Sophomore outside hitter Rachel Williams (above) and the Cardinal need
another good weekend against the Oregon schools to keep advancing up the
standings in the strong Pac-12. The Cardinal is currently in sixth place.
Sophomore setter Lauren Plum
engineers the Ducks' offense, lead
ing the Pac-12 with 11.89 assists per
set, sixth best in the country. Two
junior outside hitters, Alaina
Bergsma and Katherine Fischer,
provide the firepower, with Bergs

ma beating out Stanford outside
hitter Rachel Williams for the con
ference's second-most kills (Bergs
ma averages 4.72 per set, Williams
has 4.54) while Fischer contributes
another 3.09 kills per set.
The Cardinal will kick off the
trip against Oregon State on Fri
day, Oct. 7 at Gill Coliseum in Cor
vallis, Ore.
