## Marques to lead Program on Human Rights 
### CAITY MONROE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Program on Human Rights (PHR) hired
Nadejda Marques as its new program manager, according
to a press release from the Freeman Spogli Institute.
Marques, who previously worked as the research coor
dinator for the Cost of Inaction Project at the Harvard
School of Public Health, has 15 years of experience in
human rights activism.
Marques said that PHR has several planned activities
for the year aimed at responding to and capitalizing on
student interest in human rights. The main focus of the
year will be around issues addressing human trafficking.
This topic will be explored in depth during a workshop
with Madeleine Rees and Stanford faculty and graduate
students in December, as well as in the Sanela Diana
Jenkins Speakers Series in the winter and a conference in
the spring designed to further de velop an ongoing human
trafficking research agenda.
"The problem with trafficking is that criminal and im
migration law haven't worked so far to cure the prob
lem," said Helen Stacy, director of the PHR and senior fel
low at the Center for Democracy Development and Rule
of Law (CDDRL). "Numbers are going up, trafficking is
more and more being run by underground rings that run
drugs, run arms and now people. So the problem is grow
ing and because it's now part of this large, illegal black
market; the violence and the brutality is also getting
worse."
Marques emphasized both the se verity of the problem
as well as its potential for richness in academic study, mak
ing it an ideal focus for Stanford's human rights initiative,
"It's a pressing issue, of course, but also the way that
human trafficking correlates with urban violence ... the
way it correlates with exploitation and labor rights ...
the way it correlates with immigration ... All those
things come together, and it's a very, very rich topic aca
demically as well as serving something for activists,"
Marques said.
"There are so many ways [to teach human rights]," she
continued. "There are ways to use art, to use drama, to use
music ... and that's really empowering."
Another initiative, the Human Rights Collaboratory,
will hold workshops that focus on issues of human well

being and the environment. PHR will also focus on devel
oping human rights curricula to help high school and col
lege teachers incorporate the study of human rights into
their classroom whether they teach math, science or
humanities.
Finally, PHR will also hold a regional human rights se
ries, which will focus on Latin America this year, and will
continue to sponsor the Undergraduate Human Rights
Fellowship.
"We want to grow the undergraduate student commu
nity that works on human rights," Stacy said.
Marques, a native of Brazil, was born during the coun
try's authoritarian period, making human rights a press
ing issue for her on a personal level, she said.
"I experienced abuse of civil rights from an early age,"

Nadejda Marques, formerly a Harvard researcher, is the
new program manager of Stanford's Program on
Human Rights. With 15 years of work in human rights
activism under her belt, she plans to draw on both her
personal and professional experience to encourage students
to pursue their academic interests in the subject.
she said. "I always wanted to be in
volved with human rights."
Marques lost her father to the
dictatorship he was tortured and
killed when she was nine months
old. Her mother then fled Brazil and
lived as a refugee until she and Mar
ques were reunited with the help of
Amnesty International a year later.
Stacy said that Marques' experi
ence greatly colors her work in
human rights.
"[Marques] has her own personal
perspective from her own life and her
family's life... that means she is in
tensively empathetic, has a deep de
sire to see changes in the world and
the humor and persistence to persist
at difficult problems," Stacy said.

While Marques was forced to
confront human rights issues early
on in her personal life, she soon
started tackling them professionally
as well. She has worked as a foreign
correspondent for the Washington
Post, has a long history of working
with Human Rights Watch in Brazil
and Angola and, prior to coming to
Stanford, worked at the Harvard
School of Public Health as a re
search coordinator for the Cost of
Inaction Project at the
Bagnoud Xavier Center for Health
and Human Rights.
"I think Stanford [along with]
many schools around the state and
the world is moving forward with
this human rights education and try
ing to develop human rights within
[its] curriculum and to get students
interested," she said.
