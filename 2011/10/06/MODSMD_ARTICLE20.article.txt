# Stay a bit longer, Red Zone
## 
### Billy Gallagher 
When are you going to
leave? The question
posed by many in the
Red Zone Saturday
night perplexed me.
They began at the half â€”with Stanford
only up 17-7 and continued
throughout the game. By the fourth
quarter, the Red Zone had thinned
considerably, and the upper levels
looked like a Marlins-Reds game.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised...
why would you want to stay and watch
a top-five team with the best quarter
back in the country calling his own
plays in the no-huddle offense in the
first home game since classes started?
I realize that this is Stanford and
everyone is incredibly busy. But the
game was on a Saturday night. I serious
ly doubt many of the early-leavers hit
the books hard afterwards.
I would almost understand people
leaving early if the game was in the bag
but the score was 17-7 at the half!
Maybe the third quarter Red Zone ex
odus can become our new Stanford
football tradition, like the Ohio State
band's script, the Penn State white-out
or Notre Dame's Touchdown Jesus.
Now, I know we're not a "football
school." I'm glad we aren't. I'm glad our
quarterback values his education more
than tattoos. I'm glad his father sup
ports him getting a diploma, not a pay
check that he might not but probably
does know about. I'm glad our coach
isn't Pete Carroll (no veil there). But for
God's sake, can we please watch the
team?
And it's not just the students who
suck as fans. It appears as though the
good people of Palo Alto and the sur
rounding Valley were very recently in
formed of the existence of Stanford
football. No word yet on whether they
know it will exist beyond this season
when [insert your own Luck-runs-out
pun here].
So the question becomes, who
should have the privilege of watching
the Cardinal? My economics profes
sor would probably urge me that who
ever is willing to pay the most would
receive the most enjoyment. My
brother would argue that it should be
whoever cares the most (by which we
Philadelphians of course mean who
ever is willing to wait in the snow for
days for tickets to a game that our
team will inevitably lose). My friends
would all say to let the students in. But
the Red Zone was already expanded
this offseason.
Additionally, revenue from a prof
itable football team can help offset
costs of other varsity teams, so we need
as many ticket sales as possible.
If I were Director of Athletics Bob
Bowlsby, I'd have great seats to every
game. And I'd also charge non-student
"fans" much higher prices for this sea
son. Or make them lock into a multi
year commitment for tickets. Or I'd pull
what Kansas' athletic department did
and require a "gift pledge" for the priv
ilege of buying tickets.
Personally, I would favor a Card lit
eracy test for entrance to games. It
would be very short:
1. Which one is not like the others?
A. Plunkett B. Elway C. Rodgers D.
Luck
2. What is a Toilolo and how do you
use it?
3. Name one player not named
Luck on the Cardinal who will (most
likely) be drafted in the first round this
year? (Hint: he guards Luck)
4. What's your deal?
But I dream.
By now, you've probably either
stopped reading this or you're wonder
ing what the point is.
It's simple: Once you get through
the incredibly convenient, never-fail
ing, quick-loading Red Zone ticket
process and get to the stadium on game
day, please stay. I don't particularly care
whether the game is all you have to live
for, you don't know what a first down is
or you fall somewhere in between. Just
stay and watch. Because not that many
people in the country have the opportu
nity to watch a team this good. Because
I want to stop hearing ESPN talk about
how bad Cardinal fans are. But most of
all, because these players deserve to
play to a packed house every single
week.

Not a half empty stadium in the
fourth quarter.

Billy Gallagher is somewhat of a hyp
ocrite, because he did in fact leave the
stadium at halftime of the Eagles-Nin
ers game on Sunday. Laugh at him for
not thinking Alex Smith could make
Philly fans wish it was 1980 again at
