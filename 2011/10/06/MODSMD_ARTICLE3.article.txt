## Board on Judicial Affairs analyzes pilot run of Alternative Review Process 
### MARIANNE LeVINE DESK EDITOR 
The Sexual Violence Advisory
Board (SVAB) and the Board on
Judicial Affairs (B JA) aim to com
plete an evaluation of the way
University officials have respond
ed to sexual assault cases on cam
pus since the pilot launch of the
Alternative Review Process
(ARP) in 2010, according to Assis
tant Dean of Student Life Jamie
Pontius-Hogan.
The ARP is a pilot program in
tended to more thoroughly review
accusations of sexual assault while
maintaining greater confidentiali
ty for all parties involved.
The SVAB, established in 2005,
comprises of students, staff and
faculty who offer advice related to
campus sexual violence, relation
ship abuse and stalking.
The University recently low
ered its standard of proof and
granted sexual assault victims the
right to appeal final decisions dur

issued by the Obama Administra
tion in early April 2011 through
the Department of Education's
Office of Civil Rights. The new
federal guidelines served to speci
fy interpretation of the Title IX
law that forbids sex discrimination
in schools receiving federal funds.
"This has been a major policy
issue for student leaders across the

nation, especially at Stanford. This
was a big issue for [myself and for

of that, after the [new national
guidelines were] received in win

other ways to aid the [ARP re

While the University's decision
to lower the standard of proof and
its establishment of an appeals
process for sexual assault victims
was in response to the new nation
al guidelines, Stanford's review of
its sexual assault policy has been
an ongoing process.

"A few years ago, the SVAB
collaborated with the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs (OJA) to identify
areas of concern in how issues of
sexual assault were being adjudi
cated," Pontius-Hogan wrote in an
email to The Daily.
According to Pontius-Hogan,
Vice Provost Chris Griffith assem
bled a working group in the sum
mer of 2009 to draft a proposal of
a new process for sexual assault
cases, titled the Alternate Review
Process. The working group con

OJA staff. Pontius-Hogan said
that the Board on Judicial Affairs
is not involved in individual sexu
