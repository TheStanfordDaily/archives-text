# Assault policy under review
## Board on Judicial Affairs analyzes pilot run of Alternative Review Process 
### MARIANNE LeVINE DESK EDITOR 
The Sexual Violence Advisory
Board (SVAB) and the Board on
Judicial Affairs (B JA) aim to com
plete an evaluation of the way
University officials have respond
ed to sexual assault cases on cam
pus since the pilot launch of the
Alternative Review Process
(ARP) in 2010, according to Assis
tant Dean of Student Life Jamie
Pontius-Hogan.
The ARP is a pilot program in
tended to more thoroughly review
accusations of sexual assault while
maintaining greater confidentiali
ty for all parties involved.
The SVAB, established in 2005,
comprises of students, staff and
faculty who offer advice related to
campus sexual violence, relation
ship abuse and stalking.
The University recently low
ered its standard of proof and
granted sexual assault victims the
right to appeal final decisions dur
ing University judicial proceed
ings. These changes are in re
sponse to a new set of guidelines
issued by the Obama Administra
tion in early April 2011 through
the Department of Education's
Office of Civil Rights. The new
federal guidelines served to speci
fy interpretation of the Title IX
law that forbids sex discrimination
in schools receiving federal funds.
"This has been a major policy
issue for student leaders across the

nation, especially at Stanford. This
was a big issue for [myself and for
mer ASSU President Angelina
Cardona 'll] to advocate for with
the administration," said ASSU
President Michael Cruz 'l2. "Out
of that, after the [new national
guidelines were] received in win
ter 2011, we have been working on
other ways to aid the [ARP re
view] process in any way we can."
While the University's decision
to lower the standard of proof and
its establishment of an appeals
process for sexual assault victims
was in response to the new nation
al guidelines, Stanford's review of
its sexual assault policy has been
an ongoing process.

"A few years ago, the SVAB
collaborated with the Office of Ju
dicial Affairs (OJA) to identify
areas of concern in how issues of
sexual assault were being adjudi
cated," Pontius-Hogan wrote in an
email to The Daily.
According to Pontius-Hogan,
Vice Provost Chris Griffith assem
bled a working group in the sum
mer of 2009 to draft a proposal of
a new process for sexual assault
cases, titled the Alternate Review
Process. The working group con
sisted of BJA members. Judicial
Hearing Panelists, students and
OJA staff. Pontius-Hogan said
that the Board on Judicial Affairs
is not involved in individual sexu
al assault cases, but instead "pro
vides community voice to overar
ching policy."
The working group said it exam
ined other University policies re
garding on-campus sexual assault
and consulted with experts in the
field of campus sexual assault poli
cy before developing the ARP,
which was implemented in April
2010. While the Office of Judicial
Affairs typically manages the adju
dication process for cases involving
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard violations, sexual assault
cases go through the ARP.
There are several differences
between the ARP and OJA adjudi
cation processes for non-sexual as
sault cases. The ARP process con
sists of four reviewers, instead of
the standard six. The four review
ers comprise three students and
one faculty staff. Instead of the case
being heard in one session, those
involved meet separately multiple
times to allow for greater confiden
tiality.
Pontius-Hogan added that de
spite the changes made to the Uni
versity sexual assault policy, the
ARP already met the majority of
the national guidelines released in
April 2011.
"The ARP was put in place to
address concerns of timeliness, pri
vacy and fairness," Pontius-Hogan
said. "As we are still in the pilot
stage, we are working to make im
provements as we progress."
Since the ARP's creation, there
has been a significant increase in
the number of sexual assault cases
reported on campus to the police.
According to the 2011 Annual Se
curity and Fire Report released by
the Stanford University Depart
ment of Public Safety (SUDPS),
the number of reported on-campus
forcible sexual assaults doubled,
increasing from 10 cases each in
2008 and 2009 to 21 cases in 2010.
Despite the increase in reporting to
campus police, the University's ju
dicial process remains separate
from that of the criminal justice
system.

"The change to the judicial af
fairs process for handling reports
of sexual assault/sexual miscon
duct does not alter the way in
which police conduct criminal in
vestigations or the criminal justice
process," wrote Chief of Police
Laura Wilson in an email to The
Daily. "Reports of sexual assault
may be investigated through both
the criminal justice system and the
judicial affairs system at the same
time, but they are separate and dis
tinct processes."
According to the report, the
ARP will govern disciplinary cases
involving sexual harassment, sexu
al misconduct and dating violence.
Both the victim and the perpetra
tor have the right to due process
under the ARP.
The Office of Judicial Affairs
website elaborates further on the
policies listed in the report. The
website states that all reports of
sexual assault must be filed with
the Office of Judicial Affairs. The
website also outlines the rights of
the accused student. In addition,
the Office of Judicial Affairs web
site also describes the rights of the
impacted party, or the victim, as
well as the rights of the witnesses,
the selection process for investiga
tors and reviewers, the investiga
tors' process and obligations, the
reviewers' process and obligations
and the appeals process to the Vice
Provost, to which both the impact
ed party and the responding stu
dent are entitled.
The Board on Judicial Affairs is
scheduled to publish its review of
the ARP by winter 2012. The re
view process seeks to update Stan
ford's sexual assault policy by
aligning the ARP with the most ef
fective practices nationwide. De
spite the University's efforts to re
form sexual assault policy on cam
pus, Pontius-Hogan described some
of the challenges remaining.
"The greatest challenges that re
main are the need to have a perma
nent process like the ARP to adju
dicate these types of cases and find
ing hearing panelists willing to
serve on these difficult cases," Pon
tius-Hogan said.
