## Apple founder Steve Jobs dies at 56 By THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
### â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Steve Jobs, founder of Apple
Inc., died Wednesday at the age of
56 after a long battle with pancreat
ic cancer, according to an an
nouncement on the company web
site. As the former CEO of Apple,
he became the force behind and
the face of its transformation
into a trend-setting, pop-culture
phenomenon.
News of his death was greeted
with an immediate outpouring of
grief and tribute from countless
world and industry leaders as well as
fans on the Internet. Several tech-re
lated sites paid tribute to his memo
ry through comments and images
featured on their front page.
Jobs, a Bay Area native and Palo
Alto resident, was long a familiar
presence within the Stanford com
munity. His and Apple's close ties
with the University have been
forged through millions of dollars in
donations and several collabora
tions, including the popular iTunes
U site, where Stanford content re
cently hit 40 million downloads. Jobs
was a patient at the Stanford Cancer
Center.
His commencement address to
the Class of 2005, which he gave just
over a year after he was first diag
nosed with cancer, has frequently
been revisited by the media since he
stepped down from the company in
August. In it, he explored the topic of
death, encouraging students to re
member their mortality in order to
inspire them to focus on what they
found most important. The prescient
remarks, which Jobs himself seemed
to follow in the ensuing years, have
been quoted extensively.
"Remembering that I'll be dead
soon is the most important tool I've
ever encountered to help me make
the big choices in life," Jobs said.
"Because almost everything all
external expectations, all pride, all
fear of embarrassment or failure
these things just fall away in the face
of death, leaving only what is truly
important."
