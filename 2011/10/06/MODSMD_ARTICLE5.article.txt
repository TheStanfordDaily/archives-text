## Hospital expands brain tumor center 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
The Stanford Cancer Institute
recently designated its long-stand
ing program on brain tumor re
search to be the new Brain Tumor
Center in response to the contin
ued expansion of brain tumor re
search.
According to Griffith Harsh,
professor of neurology and direc
tor of the Stanford Brain Tumor
Center, this change in name will
increase a "sense of group identi
ty" among the doctors involved
and allows the group to better
present itself to the Stanford com
munity and the general public as a
"multidisciplinary group offering

innovative therapy." Harsh be
lieves the new name implies "fo
cused expertise," state-of-the-art
medical techniques and "patient
focused, patient-friendly coordi
nated care."
"In the community, [the
change in name] lets people know
that we are dedicating resources
and research time to brain tu
mors," clinical assistant professor
of neurology Seema Nagpal said.
"I think for us it's a nice big step
into showing that Stanford is com
mitted to brain cancers and brain
tumor sciences."
The center, which focuses on
treating tumors of the brain, the
brain lining and skull base, pitu

itary glands and the spine and
spinal cord, is made up of a multi
disciplinary group of physicians
and nursing and rehabilitation
personnel. Since its inception, the
program has treated thousands of
patients, some of whom have trav
eled from Asia and South Africa
for treatment. Members of the
program meet regularly as a board
to discuss individual cases, and pa
tients have access to joint clinics,
where they can meet with multiple
physicians and have imaging stud
ies performed all in one day.
Nagpal emphasized the cen
ter's focus on patient care.
