## Hospital expands brain tumor center 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
The Stanford Cancer Institute
recently designated its long-stand
ing program on brain tumor re
search to be the new Brain Tumor
Center in response to the contin
ued expansion of brain tumor re
search.
According to Griffith Harsh,
professor of neurology and direc
tor of the Stanford Brain Tumor
Center, this change in name will
increase a "sense of group identi
ty" among the doctors involved
and allows the group to better
present itself to the Stanford com
munity and the general public as a
"multidisciplinary group offering

innovative therapy." Harsh be
lieves the new name implies "fo
cused expertise," state-of-the-art
medical techniques and "patient
focused, patient-friendly coordi
nated care."
"In the community, [the
change in name] lets people know
that we are dedicating resources
and research time to brain tu
mors," clinical assistant professor
of neurology Seema Nagpal said.
"I think for us it's a nice big step
into showing that Stanford is com
mitted to brain cancers and brain
tumor sciences."
The center, which focuses on
treating tumors of the brain, the
brain lining and skull base, pitu

itary glands and the spine and
spinal cord, is made up of a multi
disciplinary group of physicians
and nursing and rehabilitation
personnel. Since its inception, the
program has treated thousands of
patients, some of whom have trav
eled from Asia and South Africa
for treatment. Members of the
program meet regularly as a board
to discuss individual cases, and pa
tients have access to joint clinics,
where they can meet with multiple
physicians and have imaging stud
ies performed all in one day.
Nagpal emphasized the cen
ter's focus on patient care.

The Stanford Cancer Institute recently decided to form a Brain Tumor Center from its longstanding program
on brain tumor research and treatment in order to accomodate increasing growth in the research program.
"We really focus on quality of life
and we take care of the family, not
just the patient," she said. "We rec
ognize that a brain tumor is a pretty
devastating disease to be diagnosed
with.There's a lot more than just the
medicine and the chemotherapy
happening; there's huge life-adjust
ments, huge financial adjustments,
huge planning for everything."
In addition to expanding its per
sonnel, the center has also achieved
three research breakthroughs in the
past year. The first was the discovery
of a new genetic deletion in glioblas
tomas, which Harsh called the most
malignant type of brain tumor.

Harsh's paper on the discovery was
published in February in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
The second breakthrough in
volved identifying important contri
butions to tumor growth from meta
bolic pathways and the tumor's
unique blood vessel supply. Finally,
Nagpal said that she and Lawrence
Recht, the center's senior neuro-on
cologist, have identified a drug that
increases quality of life for patients
diagnosed with a glioblastoma after
studying data from Stanford
glioblastoma patients since 2003.
To treat brain tumors, the center
uses new techniques such as entrop
ic mapping of speech and motor
function, which allows the doctors to
remove a tumor while a patient is
awake and speaking. The center also
removes tumors through endoscopy,
a surgery through the nose, eliminat

ing riskier surgeries that involve
opening the skull. Additionally, the
physicians use a Cyberknife ma
chine to focus radiation on specific
areas of the brain and reduce the du
ration of radiation treatments.
Once the tumor tissue is re
moved, the center's doctors test the
tissue for the most up to date genet
ic markers. By analyzing these
markers, they hope to develop per
sonalized medicine regimens that
target each patient's specific tumor.
While the technology for distin
guishing between the genetic make
ups of different tumors exists, Nag
pal said the medical community has
not yet developed the medicine to
effectively target tumors based on
that knowledge.
