## Study links infertility, heart ills Childless men more likely to have head disease 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine found in a recent study
that childless men suffer a higher
mortality rate due to greater risk of
cardiovascular disease. Childless
men in the study were at a 17 per
cent greater risk of developing car
diovascular disease than men who
had fathered children.
"Here we are seeing a real health
impact from childlessness," said
Michael Eisenberg, assistant profes
sor of urology and lead author of the
study. "The reason is unclear, but if it
is biologic ... we may have a chance
to save lives."
Eisenberg, a male infertility spe
cialist, initiated the study in 2009
during his urology residency at the
University of California, San Fran
cisco. He designed the study in re
sponse to growing data indicating
infertility as a warning sign of other
long-term health issues. Eisenberg
added that, based on the study's
findings, recommended medical
treatment for achieving a good
sperm count such as maintaining
a healthy diet and exercising may
also help in maintaining cardiovas
cular health.
"Cardiovascular disease is one of
the largest [healthcare expendi
tures]," he said. "Last year almost
half a trillion dollars was spent on it.
If we can somehow cut down on
risk factors earlier, we can cut down
morbidity and mortality."
The study, which was published
Sept. 26 online in the journal
Human Reproduction, tracked
137,903 male American Associa
tion of Retired Persons (AARP)
members from the ages of 50 to 71
for a 10-year period. The study was
part of a larger National Institutes
of Health (NIH)/AARP diet and
health study that has collected
health data from more than 550,000
subjects since the mid-19905. Partic
ipants in the study respond to de
tailed questionnaires distributed by
the AARP.
The larger NIH/AARP diet and

health study has contributed to ap
proximately 250 scientific papers.
"It's the largest epidemiological
study of its type ever done," AARP
Senior Research Advisor Albert R.
Hollenbeck said.
In order to ensure that the men
in the study intended to reproduce,
researchers only included subjects
who were married or had been for
merly married. Researchers also fo
cused solely on men who were over
the age of 50 at the start of the study.
Due to the long-term nature of the
study, researchers excluded men
with serious pre-existing health con
ditions that had already affected
their long-term health outlook.
"Obviously there are lots of rea
sons to be childless," Eisenberg
said. "Certainly some men don't
want to have children, but in the
general population as a whole that's
a minority."
Another recent study found that
men with high levels of testos
terone were more likely to find

mates and father children that
those with lower levels of testos
terone. Eisenberg drew a connec
tion to his study on fatherhood, say
ing that men with low sperm counts
also tend to have lower levels of
testosterone, which could poten
tially indicate broader underlying
health issues.
Eisenberg stressed that external
factors must be considered when
evaluating the study, including the
role of socioeconomic status in de
termining family size and the
change in lifestyle associated with
having a child.
"The other important thing to
think about is that fathers do have
their children and their children
take care of them," Eisenberg said.
"Having a child that is involved cer
tainly can help. We do know that
being married, living with a spouse
and happiness all lead to longevity."
