# New Stanford regimen eliminates kidney-transplant patients' dependency on drugs
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine recently developed a new
procedure designed to remove kid
ney-transplant patients' dependen-

cy on immune-suppressing drugs.
Transplant recipients must typically
continue to take two to three im
mune system suppressing drugs for
the remainder of their lives, follow
ing the transplant procedure. While
the drugs prevent transplant recipi
ents' bodies from rejecting the kid
ney, these drugs include numerous
side effects and do not always pre
vent kidney failure. The new tech
nique differs from standard kidney
transplant procedures by implanti
ng stem cells from the kidney
donor's blood into the transplant
recipient's lymph nodes, spleen and
thymus.
By adding the donor's stems
cells to the transplant recipient's
blood, the transplant recipient's im
mune system is better able to accept
the new organ. The kidney recipient
will receive radiation treatment im
mediately following surgery. Ten
days later, the transplant recipient
will receive an injection of the
organ donor's stem cells. While the
patient is initially put on two of the
same immune-suppressing drugs,
one of the drugs is withdrawn, al
lowing the patient's body to natu
rally adjust to the new organ. Re
searchers believe this new method

will be more cost-effective by pre
venting the failure of a transplanted
kidney. Whereas the failure of a
transplanted kidney costs $BO,OOO
during the year, this new process is
expected to cost between $20,000 to
$40,000 a year.
