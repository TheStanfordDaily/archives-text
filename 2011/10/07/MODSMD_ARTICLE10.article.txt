## Marijuana Initiative secures spot on ballot 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
After successfully garnering
enough signatures on a petition in
September, medical marijuana pro
ponents in Palo Alto succeeded in
securing a spot on the November
2012 ballot to determine voter sup
port for medical marijuana dispen
saries in the city.
The Palo Alto city council decid
ed on Tuesday to send the issue to
voters during the 2012 elections,
rather than to approve the measure
outright. The council could have immediately enacted
the measure, similarly to how it outright banned the dis
pensaries in 1997, but instead chose to leave the decision
to voters in a unanimous 7-0 decision.
The decision means that voters will decide whether to
approve the establishment of up to three marijuana-dis
pensary locations in the city. Palo Alto voters have voted
favorably on similar measures; over half of Palo Alto
voters approved of Proposition 19, which sought to le
galize marijuana in the state of California.
Restrictions would apply to dispensaries if they were
set up; some requirement include that the dispensaries
to be located far away from parks, schools and daycare
centers, as well as to only be open from 9 a.m. and 10 p.m.
They would also be subject to a four-percent tax on all
sales, as well as a $lO,OOO permit fee to establish business.
If passed, the measure would make Palo Alto the 49th
city in California to allow and regulate medical marijua
na dispensaries within city limits.
