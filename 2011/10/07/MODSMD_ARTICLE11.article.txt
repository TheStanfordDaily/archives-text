## EDITORIAL Time for a concerted effort 
### 
As most students would like
ly agree, life at Stanford is
generally a satisfying expe
rience. One common complaint,
however, is the lack of "big-name"
concerts. Students with friends at
our peer institutions hear about
Penn's annual Spring Fling festivi
ties or Princeton's Lawn Parties.
Cornell manages to attract big
names such as Lupe Fiasco, Kid
Cudi and The Decemberists, while
Northwestern's Mayfest roars with
success each year.

The Stanford Concert Network
(SCN) does an admirable job of
bringing artists to campus, but the
fact remains that none of the artists
in the past few years have had any
thing close to the universal name
recognition of a Top-40 artist. Nev
ertheless, events with popular
artists like Third Eye Blind last
year or this year's NSO Cataracs
performance boasted high atten
dance, suggesting that Stanford stu
dents are eager to come out to sup
port artists and enjoy their music.
While an entire music event, like
Spring Fling or Mayfest, may be
impractical, even a single big-name
artist's performance would have
benefits for Stanford. For one, it
would allow for the showcasing of
student groups and artists. This al
ready happens with the artists who
do come to campus, but the impact
of opening for someone more fa
mous would have an even larger
'halo' effect. A performance would
also build school spirit and pride
and cement Stanford's fun-loving
reputation.

The main problem with hosting
such an event is cost, as artists are
generally expensive. Although
SCN receives a considerable
amount in special fees ($8 per stu
dent per quarter this year), its at
tempts to bring a variety of smaller
groups to campus in order to ap
peal to a multitude of students has
value. Instead, perhaps SCN could
look to slightly trim the existing
schedule and pay for a bigger event
through other methods. North
western, for example, seeks corpo
rate sponsors for its Mayfest, while
at Penn, students help foot the bill
for the concert. Stanford students
already spend time and money at
tending performances across the
Bay Area. The convenience and
value of having a big name on cam
pus would be something that many
students would pay for. Along
these lines, it is doubtful that atten
dance would be a problem. Atten

dance at well-publicized events for
reasonably well-known artists like
Third Eye Blind last year or The
Cataracs last month is generally
high and the novelty and cama
raderie of attending a big-name
concert on campus would likely
draw even some people who would
not otherwise go out of their way to
attend the same artist's concert
elsewhere. Working with other
schools on the West Coast to land
the same artist or working Stanford
into an artist's pre-existing West
Coast tour might also reduce costs.
Another big concern is the lack
of a suitable venue. Frost Am
phitheater is an undervalued loca
tion, but its lack of facilities, includ
ing bathrooms and practical power
access, makes it an expensive
proposition. Charging or seeking
co-sponsors might go some way to
defraying these costs, but again,
more creative solutions might
work. Penn hosts the Spring Fling
headliner in its 50,000-seat football
stadium and opens the event to
community members, whose tick
ets are not subsidized. Flosting the
event in a less conventional area,
like Stanford Stadium or Sandhill
Fields or even across some of the
larger parking lots, might be an un
usual but workable solution.

SCN and Stanford are likely
quite aware of the issues raised
here. There are indeed other prob
lems, like Santa Clara County's
noise ordinance. Nevertheless,
making a concerted effort to attract
a big-name artist to campus would
be well worth the expense and or
ganizational challenge.
