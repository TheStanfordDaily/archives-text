### RICKY YEAN '09 Co-Founder of the Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES 
What Steve Jobs meant to me
Having just learned about his
death, I'm mustering some
thing together to try to articu
late Steve Jobs' impact on my life.
Unlike many people here in the Val
ley, I wasn't much of a geek, let alone
an Apple fanboy. I came to Stanford
because it offered me a great finan
cial aid package and because it was
an elite institution close enough to
home in Los Angeles in case I ever
needed to go back.That was '06.1 had
no idea Steve Jobs just made a Com
mencement speech one year before
that I'd discover later and would
change my life.
Going to school at Stanford was a
huge culture shock. I couldn't fit in. In
dorm activities, I learned about my
peers' amazing backgrounds and felt
sorry for myself for not having any of
their experiences in life. I walked
around the dorm asking every person
if he/she played an instrument, and I
couldn't find anyone who didn't. I did
not have the study skills necessary to
succeed, and got a C during my first
quarter while others marched on to
great academic performance. On

campus, iPods and other Apple prod
ucts were pervasive, and that only
added to the perception this was a
school for privileged kids, not me.
I felt that way until my first spring
break. I didn't want to go home since
there wasn't much to return to. I de
cided to stay and went on a trip led by
some upperclassmen called "Social
Entrepreneurship in the Bay Area." A
little context, I hated "business." That
was a dirty word. My father was in the
stock market and he was pretty much
bankrupt by the time I turned four.

Growing up, he tried to give me what
he knew while trying to turn himself
around with no capital, to no avail. I al
ways rejected him. My mother left
around then, and I struggled to grow
up like a normal kid when nothing
was normal about my environment.
At 14,1 started working so I could help
pay for things around the household.
It wasn't much, but it helped. Business,
more precisely, buying and selling
stocks, was the reason why all this had
to happen.
On this trip, we visited companies
like Kiva, World of Good, Papilia and
Benetech. I realized where I was. I am
not just at Stanford, but at Silicon Val
ley, where there are "businesses" that
actually did good things and made the
world a better place. That was ex
tremely eye-opening. By the time
spring quarter rolled around, I knew
what I needed to do. My perspective
was completely transformed.
By bringing me here, Stanford was
lifting me up and putting me on equal
footing as everyone else because for
once in my life, I did not have to worry
about money, at least not here. The


Steve Jobs (2005)/Stanford Daily File Photo
school also gave me everything I
needed to succeed, with resources
like the alternative spring break
trip, and incredible peers I can team
up with to achieve dreams. I wanted
to change the world the way that
people in the Silicon Valley were
doing it, with massive impact. As I
learned more about startups and
entrepreneurship, I found myself in
creasingly drawn to it. In school, I
made it a point to utilize the re
sources available to me and, more
importantly, I tried to learn as much
as I could from my peers.
Over time, I found out what I was
good at. I'm good with people. My
upbringing had ingrained in me spe
cial sensitivities that helped me nav
igate teams to work better together
and eventually achieve success. I
was never the smartest in the room,
but I didn't need to be. I found a
niche in school as someone who
championed the cause of entrepre
neurship, bringing the startup spirit
and the message of empowerment
to every part of campus. I also start
ed dabbling in startups by first
working for them, and later, with the
right teammates, built products that
would eventually become Crowd
booster.
So what did all this have to do
with Steve Jobs? Well, in college, I
discovered his Commencement
speech. I found myself watching it
over and over again. Even though I
am a fanboy now, it wasn't about his
products. It was his story. Like me,
he came from a low-income, immi
grant family. He had to do things
like pick up cans so he could sell
them to buy a meal. When he found
out what he needed to do, he went
after it, without fear. He took the
leap, and he assured me in his
speech that you can't connect the
dots going forward, so you just have
to have faith. That encouraged me
to go from a kid who didn't fit in to
one who dared to pursue his
dreams, despite economic circum
stances and allures of elite jobs that
pay. I knew what I needed to do. He
told me to jump, and I did. I jumped.
Crowdbooster is the first of many
businesses I will build to maximize
the impact I have in this world.Thank
you, Steve.

change my life.
Going to school at Stanford was a
huge culture shock. I couldn't fit in. In
dorm activities, I learned about my
peers' amazing backgrounds and felt
sorry for myself for not having any of
their experiences in life. I walked
around the dorm asking every person
if he/she played an instrument, and I
couldn't find anyone who didn't. I did
not have the study skills necessary to
succeed, and got a C during my first
quarter while others marched on to
great academic performance. On

campus, iPods and other Apple prod
ucts were pervasive, and that only
added to the perception this was a
school for privileged kids, not me.
I felt that way until my first spring
break. I didn't want to go home since
there wasn't much to return to. I de
cided to stay and went on a trip led by
some upperclassmen called "Social
Entrepreneurship in the Bay Area." A
little context, I hated "business." That
was a dirty word. My father was in the
stock market and he was pretty much
bankrupt by the time I turned four.

Growing up, he tried to give me what
he knew while trying to turn himself
around with no capital, to no avail. I al
ways rejected him. My mother left
around then, and I struggled to grow
up like a normal kid when nothing
was normal about my environment.
At 14,1 started working so I could help
pay for things around the household.
It wasn't much, but it helped. Business,
more precisely, buying and selling
stocks, was the reason why all this had
to happen.
On this trip, we visited companies
like Kiva, World of Good, Papilia and
Benetech. I realized where I was. I am
not just at Stanford, but at Silicon Val
ley, where there are "businesses" that
actually did good things and made the
world a better place. That was ex
tremely eye-opening. By the time
spring quarter rolled around, I knew
what I needed to do. My perspective
was completely transformed.
By bringing me here, Stanford was
lifting me up and putting me on equal
footing as everyone else because for
once in my life, I did not have to worry
about money, at least not here. The

school also gave me everything I
needed to succeed, with resources
like the alternative spring break
trip, and incredible peers I can team
up with to achieve dreams. I wanted
to change the world the way that
people in the Silicon Valley were
doing it, with massive impact. As I
learned more about startups and
entrepreneurship, I found myself in
creasingly drawn to it. In school, I
made it a point to utilize the re
sources available to me and, more
importantly, I tried to learn as much
as I could from my peers.
Over time, I found out what I was
good at. I'm good with people. My
upbringing had ingrained in me spe
cial sensitivities that helped me nav
igate teams to work better together
and eventually achieve success. I
was never the smartest in the room,
but I didn't need to be. I found a
niche in school as someone who
championed the cause of entrepre
neurship, bringing the startup spirit
and the message of empowerment
to every part of campus. I also start
ed dabbling in startups by first
working for them, and later, with the
right teammates, built products that
would eventually become Crowd
booster.
So what did all this have to do
with Steve Jobs? Well, in college, I
discovered his Commencement
speech. I found myself watching it
over and over again. Even though I
am a fanboy now, it wasn't about his
products. It was his story. Like me,
he came from a low-income, immi
grant family. He had to do things
like pick up cans so he could sell
them to buy a meal. When he found
out what he needed to do, he went
after it, without fear. He took the
leap, and he assured me in his
speech that you can't connect the
dots going forward, so you just have
to have faith. That encouraged me
to go from a kid who didn't fit in to
one who dared to pursue his
dreams, despite economic circum
stances and allures of elite jobs that
pay. I knew what I needed to do. He
told me to jump, and I did. I jumped.
Crowdbooster is the first of many
businesses I will build to maximize
the impact I have in this world.Thank
you, Steve.
