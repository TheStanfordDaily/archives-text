What Steve Jobs meant to me
Having just learned about his
death, I'm mustering some
thing together to try to articu
late Steve Jobs' impact on my life.
Unlike many people here in the Val
ley, I wasn't much of a geek, let alone
an Apple fanboy. I came to Stanford
because it offered me a great finan
cial aid package and because it was
an elite institution close enough to
home in Los Angeles in case I ever
needed to go back.That was '06.1 had
no idea Steve Jobs just made a Com
mencement speech one year before
that I'd discover later and would
change my life.
Going to school at Stanford was a
huge culture shock. I couldn't fit in. In
dorm activities, I learned about my
peers' amazing backgrounds and felt
sorry for myself for not having any of
their experiences in life. I walked
around the dorm asking every person
if he/she played an instrument, and I
couldn't find anyone who didn't. I did
not have the study skills necessary to
succeed, and got a C during my first
quarter while others marched on to
great academic performance. On

campus, iPods and other Apple prod
ucts were pervasive, and that only
added to the perception this was a
school for privileged kids, not me.
I felt that way until my first spring
break. I didn't want to go home since
there wasn't much to return to. I de
cided to stay and went on a trip led by
some upperclassmen called "Social
Entrepreneurship in the Bay Area." A
little context, I hated "business." That
was a dirty word. My father was in the
stock market and he was pretty much
bankrupt by the time I turned four.

Growing up, he tried to give me what
he knew while trying to turn himself
around with no capital, to no avail. I al
ways rejected him. My mother left
around then, and I struggled to grow
up like a normal kid when nothing
was normal about my environment.
At 14,1 started working so I could help
pay for things around the household.
It wasn't much, but it helped. Business,
more precisely, buying and selling
stocks, was the reason why all this had
to happen.
On this trip, we visited companies
like Kiva, World of Good, Papilia and
Benetech. I realized where I was. I am
not just at Stanford, but at Silicon Val
ley, where there are "businesses" that
actually did good things and made the
world a better place. That was ex
tremely eye-opening. By the time
spring quarter rolled around, I knew
what I needed to do. My perspective
was completely transformed.
By bringing me here, Stanford was
lifting me up and putting me on equal
footing as everyone else because for
once in my life, I did not have to worry
about money, at least not here. The
