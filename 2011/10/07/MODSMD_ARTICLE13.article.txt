## XL-size me: pipelines, pinholes and ethical spillover 
### Holly Moeller 
When I was little, I really
wanted to go to Prudhoe
Bay, on Alaska's northern
shoreline. Not because I wanted to
see pristine coastline or frolicking
wildlife, but because I wanted to see
the place that could destroy all of it.
In 1989, a tanker accident in
Prince William Sound spilled 11 mil
lion gallons of oil into Alaska's
coastal waters, creating a slick the
size of Massachusetts and a toxic
legacy still felt today, more than two
decades later. The oil originated in
Prudhoe Bay, where it began an 800-
mile journey through the Trans Alas
ka Pipeline to the hold of the Exxon
Valdez, the vessel that would go on
to create the largest spill in Ameri
can history. (Of course, the record
was bested last year by BP's Deep
water Horizon escapade.)
The 1989 spill was the result of a
shipping error, but not all oil trans

port mishaps happen afloat. Five
years ago, in Prudhoe Bay itself, a
dime-sized hole in one of BP's
pipelines spilled 269,000 gallons of
oil before it could be controlled.That
2006 spill became infamous not just
for its damage to a pristine land
scape, but also because it highlighted
glaring shortfalls in equipment
maintenance and preparedness on
the part of BP and other companies
operating on Alaska's slopes.
This year, there have been dozens
of spills from pipelines criss-crossing
American soil. Among the more
noteworthy: a 42,000 gallon release
into Montana's Yellowstone River in
July (courtesy, once again, of Exxon
Mobil), and a May spill of 21,000 gal
lons in southeast North Dakota.
While smaller in volume, the lat
ter might be more troubling. It's one
of 14 spills from TransCanada's
brand-new Keystone I line, all within

the first year of operations.
Keystone carries highly viscous
bitumen, forced from Alberta's infa
mous tar sands and diluted with
kerosene to pump-able consistency,
to U.S. refineries. And despite heated
debate over Alberta's extraction
methods (mowing down boreal for
est and pumping steaming water
deep underground, all to the tune of
massive carbon emissions), Tran
sCanada has spent the last two years
aggressively lobbying to expand.
The proposed Keystone XL ex
