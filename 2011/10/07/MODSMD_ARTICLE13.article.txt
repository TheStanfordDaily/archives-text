# SEEING GREEN
## XL-size me: pipelines, pinholes and ethical spillover 
### Holly Moeller 
When I was little, I really
wanted to go to Prudhoe
Bay, on Alaska's northern
shoreline. Not because I wanted to
see pristine coastline or frolicking
wildlife, but because I wanted to see
the place that could destroy all of it.
In 1989, a tanker accident in
Prince William Sound spilled 11 mil
lion gallons of oil into Alaska's
coastal waters, creating a slick the
size of Massachusetts and a toxic
legacy still felt today, more than two
decades later. The oil originated in
Prudhoe Bay, where it began an 800-
mile journey through the Trans Alas
ka Pipeline to the hold of the Exxon
Valdez, the vessel that would go on
to create the largest spill in Ameri
can history. (Of course, the record
was bested last year by BP's Deep
water Horizon escapade.)
The 1989 spill was the result of a
shipping error, but not all oil trans

port mishaps happen afloat. Five
years ago, in Prudhoe Bay itself, a
dime-sized hole in one of BP's
pipelines spilled 269,000 gallons of
oil before it could be controlled.That
2006 spill became infamous not just
for its damage to a pristine land
scape, but also because it highlighted
glaring shortfalls in equipment
maintenance and preparedness on
the part of BP and other companies
operating on Alaska's slopes.
This year, there have been dozens
of spills from pipelines criss-crossing
American soil. Among the more
noteworthy: a 42,000 gallon release
into Montana's Yellowstone River in
July (courtesy, once again, of Exxon
Mobil), and a May spill of 21,000 gal
lons in southeast North Dakota.
While smaller in volume, the lat
ter might be more troubling. It's one
of 14 spills from TransCanada's
brand-new Keystone I line, all within

the first year of operations.
Keystone carries highly viscous
bitumen, forced from Alberta's infa
mous tar sands and diluted with
kerosene to pump-able consistency,
to U.S. refineries. And despite heated
debate over Alberta's extraction
methods (mowing down boreal for
est and pumping steaming water
deep underground, all to the tune of
massive carbon emissions), Tran
sCanada has spent the last two years
aggressively lobbying to expand.
The proposed Keystone XL ex
pansion would double existing ca
pacity (adding another 510,000

barrels of flowthrough per day),
and extend it to Gulf Coast refiner
ies hungry for crude after recent
shutdowns of offshore drilling. It
would, according to TransCanada,
add 120,000 American jobs, and
stimulate $2O billion in economic
growth. And (although the refined
oil is already earmarked to fill for
eign contracts), processing fossil
fuels from our friendly Northern
neighbor would, according to some
politicians, increase national secu
rity and relieve dependence on
OPEC.

The economic argument is usu
ally a good one to hang your politi
cal hat on these days, so I was sur
prised at how few people were buy
ing it. The Sierra Club and Natural
Resources Defense Council, of

course, objected to further devel
opment of fossil fuels. The New
York Times ran a scathing editorial.
But this time, environmental
groups and the so-called "Liberal
media" have been joined by the
conservative heart of the Midwest.
One by one, local news agencies,
community leaders and politicians
are voicing their objections.
You see, the Keystone XL
would traverse Nebraska's pre
cious Sandhill region (20,000
square miles of utterly unique wet
lands) and sprawl above the Ogal
lala Aquifer (drinking water for
two million residents; irrigation for
$2O billion-worth of crops). And
with TransCanada's leaky track
record, the locals aren't too sure
they want to take a chance with the
high levels of carcinogens and
other toxins flowing alongside Al
berta's bitumen.

It's amazing what close-to
home dangers will do. No one
breathes a word about Nigeria,

which has experienced the equiva
lent of an Exxon Valdez spill every
year for the last 50 years, all in the
course of supplying oil to first
world nations. And a year after
Deepwater Horizon, those of us
who don't own Gulf shrimp boats
are filling our gas tanks as fre
quently as ever. Today, the State
Department predicts "no signifi
cant impact" from the Keystone
XL project, and our national gov
ernment is likely to approve con
struction by the end of the year.

It seems we'll have to wait for
economics to force us to have an
environmental conscience. Fears of
climate change, images of disaster

all of these have had no effect.
But the recent global recession
produced the steepest drop in
greenhouse gas emissions in 40
years.

On Monday night, as my room
mate accelerated down Palm
Drive, we felt the car slip briefly
into a skid. The roads were slick
with oil residues brought to the sur
face by the first good rain we've
seen in months. I'd been telling my
friend Luke about the Keystone
XL pipeline, venting my frustration
with the political system and the
short memories of our social con
sciousness. As we regained traction
I remembered that every eight

months we create another Valdez
spill on our own streets little
dribs and drabs that, across Ameri
ca, add up to 260,000 barrels of oil.
I could suggest that you call
your politicians and demand they
oppose Keystone XL. I could rec
ommend that you join a protest or
donate to cleanup efforts. Instead, I
think I'll just ask you not to spill gas
at the pump and to dispose of your
oil changes properly.

Waste not, want not.

the first year of operations.
Keystone carries highly viscous
bitumen, forced from Alberta's infa
mous tar sands and diluted with
kerosene to pump-able consistency,
to U.S. refineries. And despite heated
debate over Alberta's extraction
methods (mowing down boreal for
est and pumping steaming water
deep underground, all to the tune of
massive carbon emissions), Tran
sCanada has spent the last two years
aggressively lobbying to expand.
The proposed Keystone XL ex
pansion would double existing ca
pacity (adding another 510,000

barrels of flowthrough per day),
and extend it to Gulf Coast refiner
ies hungry for crude after recent
shutdowns of offshore drilling. It
would, according to TransCanada,
add 120,000 American jobs, and
stimulate $2O billion in economic
growth. And (although the refined
oil is already earmarked to fill for
eign contracts), processing fossil
fuels from our friendly Northern
neighbor would, according to some
politicians, increase national secu
rity and relieve dependence on
OPEC.

The economic argument is usu
ally a good one to hang your politi
cal hat on these days, so I was sur
prised at how few people were buy
ing it. The Sierra Club and Natural
Resources Defense Council, of

course, objected to further devel
opment of fossil fuels. The New
York Times ran a scathing editorial.
But this time, environmental
groups and the so-called "Liberal
media" have been joined by the
conservative heart of the Midwest.
One by one, local news agencies,
community leaders and politicians
are voicing their objections.
You see, the Keystone XL
would traverse Nebraska's pre
cious Sandhill region (20,000
square miles of utterly unique wet
lands) and sprawl above the Ogal
lala Aquifer (drinking water for
two million residents; irrigation for
$2O billion-worth of crops). And
with TransCanada's leaky track
record, the locals aren't too sure
they want to take a chance with the
high levels of carcinogens and
other toxins flowing alongside Al
berta's bitumen.

It's amazing what close-to
home dangers will do. No one
breathes a word about Nigeria,

which has experienced the equiva
lent of an Exxon Valdez spill every
year for the last 50 years, all in the
course of supplying oil to first
world nations. And a year after
Deepwater Horizon, those of us
who don't own Gulf shrimp boats
are filling our gas tanks as fre
quently as ever. Today, the State
Department predicts "no signifi
cant impact" from the Keystone
XL project, and our national gov
ernment is likely to approve con
struction by the end of the year.

It seems we'll have to wait for
economics to force us to have an
environmental conscience. Fears of
climate change, images of disaster

all of these have had no effect.
But the recent global recession
produced the steepest drop in
greenhouse gas emissions in 40
years.

On Monday night, as my room
mate accelerated down Palm
Drive, we felt the car slip briefly
into a skid. The roads were slick
with oil residues brought to the sur
face by the first good rain we've
seen in months. I'd been telling my
friend Luke about the Keystone
XL pipeline, venting my frustration
with the political system and the
short memories of our social con
sciousness. As we regained traction
I remembered that every eight

months we create another Valdez
spill on our own streets little
dribs and drabs that, across Ameri
ca, add up to 260,000 barrels of oil.
I could suggest that you call
your politicians and demand they
oppose Keystone XL. I could rec
ommend that you join a protest or
donate to cleanup efforts. Instead, I
think I'll just ask you not to spill gas
at the pump and to dispose of your
oil changes properly.

Waste not, want not.

When I was little, I really
wanted to go to Prudhoe
Bay, on Alaska's northern
shoreline. Not because I wanted to
see pristine coastline or frolicking
wildlife, but because I wanted to see
the place that could destroy all of it.
In 1989, a tanker accident in
Prince William Sound spilled 11 mil
lion gallons of oil into Alaska's
coastal waters, creating a slick the
size of Massachusetts and a toxic
legacy still felt today, more than two
decades later. The oil originated in
Prudhoe Bay, where it began an 800-
mile journey through the Trans Alas
ka Pipeline to the hold of the Exxon
Valdez, the vessel that would go on
to create the largest spill in Ameri
can history. (Of course, the record
was bested last year by BP's Deep
water Horizon escapade.)
The 1989 spill was the result of a
shipping error, but not all oil trans

port mishaps happen afloat. Five
years ago, in Prudhoe Bay itself, a
dime-sized hole in one of BP's
pipelines spilled 269,000 gallons of
oil before it could be controlled.That
2006 spill became infamous not just
for its damage to a pristine land
scape, but also because it highlighted
glaring shortfalls in equipment
maintenance and preparedness on
the part of BP and other companies
operating on Alaska's slopes.
This year, there have been dozens
of spills from pipelines criss-crossing
American soil. Among the more
noteworthy: a 42,000 gallon release
into Montana's Yellowstone River in
July (courtesy, once again, of Exxon
Mobil), and a May spill of 21,000 gal
lons in southeast North Dakota.
While smaller in volume, the lat
ter might be more troubling. It's one
of 14 spills from TransCanada's
brand-new Keystone I line, all within

the first year of operations.
