# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## ASSU â€“ you're doing it wrong 
### D.S. Nelson 
The ASSU has never seemed to
be a very serious organization; a
close look at this year's version
(2.0? really?) reveals an inauspicious
picture. Unless you feel that an ASSU
Twitter feed and Facebook account
amount to much, the new team seems
to have little in store for us other than
a stock of cliches about entrepreneur
ship. I assume this is par for the
course. Most student governments
have few duties outside of party plan
ning, and the depth of their rhetoric
often matches the depth of their re
sponsibility. Anytime someone prom
ises to use "entrepreneurial culture,
your academic expertise, Silicon Val
ley's technology and the grassroots
leadership style" to improve my qual
ity of life, I am naturally skeptical of
their ability to do so and, very honest
ly, I would not care.
It would not bother me in the
slightest that their platform uses the
word entrepreneurship five times in
as many paragraphs, and references
both Silicon Valley and innovation
twice. It would not bother me that the
student government an enormously

silly and undefined chair of entrepre
neurship. It would not bother me that
90 percent of the things discussed on
Stanford 2.o's website are outside of
the power of the ASSU and extreme
ly unlikely to be affected at all. None
of this would even cross my mind as an
issue of substance were it not for the
fact the Executive and its cabinet are
going to cost the student body a com
bined $36,000 in stipends. Considering
the wealth of other and better things
that funds could be spent on and the
apparent wrongheadedness of the
current Executive, I am seriously dis
inclined to give my support or even
my silence. Also, keep in mind that
Senators are entirely unpaid. While
the compensation budget for cabinet
consultants' balloons (why?), they are
left behind.

The TUSB article was right to call
out the current Executive on its
hubris, but after a certain point hubris
goes beyond arrogance into the realm
of the entirely stupid. Its blueprints for
improving campus are little more
than startup jargon and unsubstanti
ated word vomit. Precious little of it is

actionable, most of it is way beyond
the scope of the ASSU and all of it is
worded in such a manner as to mis
represent distant possibilities as
probable outcomes. Entrepreneur
ship and innovation are both catch
phrases for the creation and imple
mentation of new ideas. This, howev
er, is not a plan or a strategy, but a
broad philosophy that speaks of
openness. We can have openness to
ideas, but as yet we have no ideas. Pre
cious little real planning has been
done, but innovation has been
trumped to ridiculous heights. Per
haps you could say it is too early to
judge. When I saw this morning that
the ASSU Executives received a
combined summer stipend of nearly
$2,700, and then looked at their blue
prints (presumably the product of a
summer of hard work), I was legiti
mately appalled. Add this to the fact
that the Executive has the largest
amount of discretionary funding
ever, and there is much reason to
worry.
It further shocked me when I
opened The Daily on Wednesday

morning to see that what the ASSU
had accomplished last night was to
pass resolutions regarding the Cali
fornia DREAM Act and a letter to
Jerry Brown about SBIBS. It seems to
me that this is indicative of an execu
tive with endless ambition and no
sense of what it can or should do. No
one is deluded enough to believe that
the ASSU has political clout, but
there is extreme hubris in claiming to
represent the political views of a cam
pus that has elected you to improve
their quality of life not pursue
your own crusades against leader X,
for cause Y or demanding measure Z.
Who would've thought that we were
electing a representative to the state
and federal government when we
ticked a ballot box? I say this as not as
someone who is angered by the views
taken, but only by the taking of views.

The ASSU has real issues to ad
dress and important goals to strive for.
We are one of few undergraduate stu
dent bodies without any substantive
power in the Faculty Senate. With
campaigning and effort, the ASSU
could actually become a significant

force on campus. There have been no
ticeable declines in the quality of din
ing halls since the introduction of Ar
rillaga Dining Commons. There is a
sexual assault judicial system on cam
pus that, in its jury advice, says that
"acting persuasive and logical" is a
sign of guilt. But 10, its concentration
lies in designing apps, improving the
sleekness of its website banners and
making sure we have an ample num
ber of Twitter updates to keep our
feeds flowing. Senators and students
alike should demand more of the Ex
ecutive, because we currently have a
shambolic array of cliches arranged
on a sleek Apple-esque background
to guide us.
Many thanks to the surname-less
Kristi of The Unofficial Stanford Blog
for bringing these issues to the fore.

twice. It would not bother me that the
student government an enormously

silly and undefined chair of entrepre
neurship. It would not bother me that
90 percent of the things discussed on
Stanford 2.o's website are outside of
the power of the ASSU and extreme
ly unlikely to be affected at all. None
of this would even cross my mind as an
issue of substance were it not for the
fact the Executive and its cabinet are
going to cost the student body a com
bined $36,000 in stipends. Considering
the wealth of other and better things
that funds could be spent on and the
apparent wrongheadedness of the
current Executive, I am seriously dis
inclined to give my support or even
my silence. Also, keep in mind that
Senators are entirely unpaid. While
the compensation budget for cabinet
consultants' balloons (why?), they are
left behind.

The TUSB article was right to call
out the current Executive on its
hubris, but after a certain point hubris
goes beyond arrogance into the realm
of the entirely stupid. Its blueprints for
improving campus are little more
than startup jargon and unsubstanti
ated word vomit. Precious little of it is

actionable, most of it is way beyond
the scope of the ASSU and all of it is
worded in such a manner as to mis
represent distant possibilities as
probable outcomes. Entrepreneur
ship and innovation are both catch
phrases for the creation and imple
mentation of new ideas. This, howev
er, is not a plan or a strategy, but a
broad philosophy that speaks of
openness. We can have openness to
ideas, but as yet we have no ideas. Pre
cious little real planning has been
done, but innovation has been
trumped to ridiculous heights. Per
haps you could say it is too early to
judge. When I saw this morning that
the ASSU Executives received a
combined summer stipend of nearly
$2,700, and then looked at their blue
prints (presumably the product of a
summer of hard work), I was legiti
mately appalled. Add this to the fact
that the Executive has the largest
amount of discretionary funding
ever, and there is much reason to
worry.
It further shocked me when I
opened The Daily on Wednesday

morning to see that what the ASSU
had accomplished last night was to
pass resolutions regarding the Cali
fornia DREAM Act and a letter to
Jerry Brown about SBIBS. It seems to
me that this is indicative of an execu
tive with endless ambition and no
sense of what it can or should do. No
one is deluded enough to believe that
the ASSU has political clout, but
there is extreme hubris in claiming to
represent the political views of a cam
pus that has elected you to improve
their quality of life not pursue
your own crusades against leader X,
for cause Y or demanding measure Z.
Who would've thought that we were
electing a representative to the state
and federal government when we
ticked a ballot box? I say this as not as
someone who is angered by the views
taken, but only by the taking of views.

The ASSU has real issues to ad
dress and important goals to strive for.
We are one of few undergraduate stu
dent bodies without any substantive
power in the Faculty Senate. With
campaigning and effort, the ASSU
could actually become a significant

force on campus. There have been no
ticeable declines in the quality of din
ing halls since the introduction of Ar
rillaga Dining Commons. There is a
sexual assault judicial system on cam
pus that, in its jury advice, says that
"acting persuasive and logical" is a
sign of guilt. But 10, its concentration
lies in designing apps, improving the
sleekness of its website banners and
making sure we have an ample num
ber of Twitter updates to keep our
feeds flowing. Senators and students
alike should demand more of the Ex
ecutive, because we currently have a
shambolic array of cliches arranged
on a sleek Apple-esque background
to guide us.
Many thanks to the surname-less
Kristi of The Unofficial Stanford Blog
for bringing these issues to the fore.
