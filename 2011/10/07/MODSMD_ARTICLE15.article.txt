Researchers equipped Stanford football players with
hi-tech mouthpieces capable of registering the force of im
pact as part of a study conducted by the School of Medi
cine.The research hopes to provide more data on concus
sions, including what type of plays or hits are more likely
to cause concussions in athletes who play contact sports.
Dr. Daniel Garza, assistant professor of orthopedic
surgery and the head researcher, hopes that the data will
help diagnose concussions in the future.
"We need to get a better understanding of the epi
demiology of these injuries," Garza said in a School of
Medicine statement. "That will involve correlating the
magnitude of impacts with associated morbidities, like
the number of days lost to injury, as well as looking at
players' head trauma histories to determine possible cu
mulative effects."

In the same statement Earl Koberlein, senior associ
ate athletic director, said, "It's a great opportunity for our
student athletes, many of whom conduct scientific re
search in their academic studies, to contribute to the lead
ing-edge research being done in sports medicine here."
Concerns over concussions have grown in recent
years for both professional and collegiate athletes. Stud
ies have shown that players who suffer concussions re
port more problems later in life, including symptoms
such as slurred speech and nausea.
Researchers plan to expand the test group to include
women's lacrosse and field hockey teams soon.
