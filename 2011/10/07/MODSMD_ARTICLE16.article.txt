# Study finds U.S. toxoplasmosis screening lacking

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
A new study by Stanford researchers found that there is
a serious lack of testing for toxoplasmosis infections in the
United States, which causes more infections and complica
tions to occur than in other parts of the world, such as Eu
rope, where screening is more prevalent.
Toxoplasmosis infections occur when a pregnant
mother gets the parasite Toxoplasma gondii and passes
it on to her unborn child. Though the mother may not
even feel symptoms, severe complications can arise in
the baby including calcium deposits in the brain and per
manent visual impairment.
The study found that 84 percent of infants in the Unit
ed States who have the infection develop serious symp
toms; however, the rate is drastically lower in parts of
Europe. In France, for example, only 17 percent of affect
ed children have serious symptoms.
The study claims this is partially due to routine
screening that occurs in many parts of Europe but not in
the United States. Awareness campaigns that teach
mothers to stay away from risky activities, as well as
drugs that hinder transmissions between the mother and
the fetus, could also be effective ways to lower the sever
ity of the infection.
"There is a tragedy out there that can be prevented
through thoughtful, low-cost
serological screening of one of our most vulnerable pop
ulations the mother-baby pair," said the author of the
study, Dr. Jose Montoya, in a press release.
