## Ticket shortage no surprise 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
If Andrew Luck makes a one
handed catch in 2008 and only
34,258 fans witness it, does his
miraculous toe tap make a
sound?

Probably not.
But this ain't 2008, baby. I can no
longer walk through the parking lots
outside of Stanford Stadium and find
people begging fans to buy their tickets
for five dollars. In fact, scalpers are ac
tually scalping. It's like I went to sleep
after the mysterious clipping call at
Wake Forest and woke up, two years
later, in some sort of twisted football di
mension where a Stanford sellout
wouldn't necessarily stem from a char
itable donation of 10,000 tickets.

I guess that's just a logical conse
quence of the nation's longest winning
streak.

This past week, the Cardinal pre
pared to take on the UCLA Bruins in
the first home game since students re
turned to the Farm. Despite earning
the label of an expected blowout (Stan
ford was favored by three touch
downs), the game drew the fourth
largest crowd in the history of the new
stadium, attracting 50,360 fans to one
of the more underappreciated venues
in the country.
As a football school still desperate
to shed its pretender image, this is ex
actly what we need. The Department
of Athletics has been tasked with draw
ing a professional-sports-oriented
crowd to what used to be considered
the fourth-best football option in the
Bay Area. Fourth best. Behind the
Raiders. It was that bad.

Think times aren't changing? In
2008, average attendance at Stanford
home games came in at a crisp 34,258,
well below Stanford Stadium's capaci
ty of 50,000. That number climbed to
41,436 in 2009, and then, for reasons
unknown, dipped to 40,042 in 2010.1
will repeat that: attendance numbers
declined during the best season in
school history. Still, nearly 6,000 more
people came to each game in 2010 than
in 2008.

What's more incredible is that near
ly 48,000 people were on hand to see
the Card demolish San Jose State in the
2011 home opener. This was before stu
dents had even sniffed the end of sum
mer vacation. That's what happens
when you win demand for tickets
rises. Crazy!
Do you know what else happens?
Demand for student tickets increases.

Hence the new online ticket claiming
system for which Stanford Athletics
has absorbed a bevy of complaints.
I've had several classmates approach
me, swearing at the school for selling
out. Change is hard, and not being
able to just casually decide midway
through a homework assignment on
a Saturday afternoon that you want
to check out the second quarter of a
nationally televised game may really
throw a few wrenches into your
weekend plans.
A week ago, the school was abuzz
with news that student tickets lasted
only five hours. The first rule of being
a football fan and turning this institu
tion into a football school: don't wait
five hours to claim your free tickets
and then gripe about having to wait in
a standby line.
At the University of Florida, stu
dent tickets are decided by lottery. If
you aren't selected, tough. Kids go
four years without receiving dis

counted tickets, instead settling for
entry to the game at an insanely
marked-up price. At Oregon, a school
that also uses an online method for
student-ticket release, reaction time
is of the utmost importance. If you
don't click at the exact moment of
distribution, it's over for you. The
things those kids would do for five
hours of leniency.
Instead of knocking the Athletics
Department for slightly inconve
niencing your lives, take a moment to
realize just how unbelievable this
transformation has been.This season,
there are legitimate national-cham
pionship aspirations. By taking two
minutes to claim a ticket near the time
of release, you get to see one of the best
teams in the nation, led by one of the
best players in the history of college
football play in one of the most mod
ern collegiate stadiums in one of the
best football climates in the world.Typ
ing that sentence made me giddy. It
should have the same effect on you.

I grew up surrounded by SEC foot
ball, so this backlash against athletics
probably offends me more than most.
But unless you've experienced or at
least heard stories of true college-foot
ball culture, you can't possibly under
stand how fortunate you are to be in
this situation as a fan. There's no need
to sleep on concrete for three nights
before a game. And although half of
you probably could, there's no reason
to create a bot that perfectly times the
online ticket release.

Just don't wait five hours, you
filthy procrastinators. See you on Sat
urday.

Zach Zimmerman didn't get the
memo about the new ticketing sys
tem, so he camped out in front of
Stanford Stadium for three days at
Camp Luck before the UCLA game.

If Andrew Luck makes a one
handed catch in 2008 and only
34,258 fans witness it, does his
miraculous toe tap make a
sound?

Probably not.
But this ain't 2008, baby. I can no
longer walk through the parking lots
outside of Stanford Stadium and find
people begging fans to buy their tickets
for five dollars. In fact, scalpers are ac
tually scalping. It's like I went to sleep
after the mysterious clipping call at
Wake Forest and woke up, two years
later, in some sort of twisted football di
mension where a Stanford sellout
wouldn't necessarily stem from a char
itable donation of 10,000 tickets.

I guess that's just a logical conse
quence of the nation's longest winning
streak.

This past week, the Cardinal pre
pared to take on the UCLA Bruins in
the first home game since students re
turned to the Farm. Despite earning
the label of an expected blowout (Stan
ford was favored by three touch
downs), the game drew the fourth
largest crowd in the history of the new
stadium, attracting 50,360 fans to one
of the more underappreciated venues
in the country.
As a football school still desperate
to shed its pretender image, this is ex
actly what we need. The Department
of Athletics has been tasked with draw
ing a professional-sports-oriented
crowd to what used to be considered
the fourth-best football option in the
Bay Area. Fourth best. Behind the
Raiders. It was that bad.

Think times aren't changing? In
2008, average attendance at Stanford
home games came in at a crisp 34,258,
well below Stanford Stadium's capaci
ty of 50,000. That number climbed to
41,436 in 2009, and then, for reasons
unknown, dipped to 40,042 in 2010.1
will repeat that: attendance numbers
declined during the best season in
school history. Still, nearly 6,000 more
people came to each game in 2010 than
in 2008.

What's more incredible is that near
ly 48,000 people were on hand to see
the Card demolish San Jose State in the
2011 home opener. This was before stu
dents had even sniffed the end of sum
mer vacation. That's what happens
when you win demand for tickets
rises. Crazy!
Do you know what else happens?
Demand for student tickets increases.

Hence the new online ticket claiming
system for which Stanford Athletics
has absorbed a bevy of complaints.
I've had several classmates approach
me, swearing at the school for selling
out. Change is hard, and not being
able to just casually decide midway
through a homework assignment on
a Saturday afternoon that you want
to check out the second quarter of a
nationally televised game may really
throw a few wrenches into your
weekend plans.
A week ago, the school was abuzz
with news that student tickets lasted
only five hours. The first rule of being
a football fan and turning this institu
tion into a football school: don't wait
five hours to claim your free tickets
and then gripe about having to wait in
a standby line.
At the University of Florida, stu
dent tickets are decided by lottery. If
you aren't selected, tough. Kids go
four years without receiving dis

counted tickets, instead settling for
entry to the game at an insanely
marked-up price. At Oregon, a school
that also uses an online method for
student-ticket release, reaction time
is of the utmost importance. If you
don't click at the exact moment of
distribution, it's over for you. The
things those kids would do for five
hours of leniency.
Instead of knocking the Athletics
Department for slightly inconve
niencing your lives, take a moment to
realize just how unbelievable this
transformation has been.This season,
there are legitimate national-cham
pionship aspirations. By taking two
minutes to claim a ticket near the time
of release, you get to see one of the best
teams in the nation, led by one of the
best players in the history of college
football play in one of the most mod
ern collegiate stadiums in one of the
best football climates in the world.Typ
ing that sentence made me giddy. It
should have the same effect on you.

I grew up surrounded by SEC foot
ball, so this backlash against athletics
probably offends me more than most.
But unless you've experienced or at
least heard stories of true college-foot
ball culture, you can't possibly under
stand how fortunate you are to be in
this situation as a fan. There's no need
to sleep on concrete for three nights
before a game. And although half of
you probably could, there's no reason
to create a bot that perfectly times the
online ticket release.

Just don't wait five hours, you
filthy procrastinators. See you on Sat
urday.
