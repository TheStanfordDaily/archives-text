## Ticket shortage no surprise 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
If Andrew Luck makes a one
handed catch in 2008 and only
34,258 fans witness it, does his
miraculous toe tap make a
sound?

Probably not.
But this ain't 2008, baby. I can no
longer walk through the parking lots
outside of Stanford Stadium and find
people begging fans to buy their tickets
for five dollars. In fact, scalpers are ac
tually scalping. It's like I went to sleep
after the mysterious clipping call at
Wake Forest and woke up, two years
later, in some sort of twisted football di
mension where a Stanford sellout
wouldn't necessarily stem from a char
itable donation of 10,000 tickets.

I guess that's just a logical conse
quence of the nation's longest winning
streak.

This past week, the Cardinal pre
pared to take on the UCLA Bruins in
the first home game since students re
turned to the Farm. Despite earning
the label of an expected blowout (Stan
ford was favored by three touch
downs), the game drew the fourth
largest crowd in the history of the new
stadium, attracting 50,360 fans to one
of the more underappreciated venues
in the country.
As a football school still desperate
to shed its pretender image, this is ex
actly what we need. The Department
of Athletics has been tasked with draw
ing a professional-sports-oriented
crowd to what used to be considered
the fourth-best football option in the
Bay Area. Fourth best. Behind the
Raiders. It was that bad.

Think times aren't changing? In
2008, average attendance at Stanford
home games came in at a crisp 34,258,
well below Stanford Stadium's capaci
ty of 50,000. That number climbed to
41,436 in 2009, and then, for reasons
unknown, dipped to 40,042 in 2010.1
will repeat that: attendance numbers
declined during the best season in
school history. Still, nearly 6,000 more
people came to each game in 2010 than
in 2008.

What's more incredible is that near
ly 48,000 people were on hand to see
the Card demolish San Jose State in the
2011 home opener. This was before stu
dents had even sniffed the end of sum
mer vacation. That's what happens
when you win demand for tickets
rises. Crazy!
Do you know what else happens?
Demand for student tickets increases.
