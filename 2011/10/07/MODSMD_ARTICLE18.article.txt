# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Squad enters Pac-12 play; title in mind 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's water polo, fresh off of its first
place finish at the SoCal Tournament last week,
hopes to carry that momentum into conference
play this weekend in an MPSF conference that in
cludes the eight of the top-ranked teams in the
country.

For the No. 1 Cardinal (7-2), just about every
season without a national championship will be
framed as a disappointment, and this year is no ex
ception. To get to the four-team postseason, Stan
ford will need to clinch either the conference or
at-large bid which is all but assured to come
out of the dominant MPSF.

"Our goal is to win MPSF or get an at-large
bid," said head coach John Vargas. "Those are al
ways our expectations."
In the context of these standards, Stanford had
a down year in 2010. The team lost a heartbreak
ing overtime game against USC in the MPSF final
and finished the season with a 15-9 record not
enough for the Cardinal to receive the at-large
bid, which went to Cal.
"The disappointing thing was that we were so
close. We were only a goal or two away," Vargas
said.
Coming into this season, most critics did not
expect a lot from a Stanford team that lost Second
Team All-Americans Sage Wright and Jeffrey
Schwimer to graduation. Wright and Schwimer,
along with classmate Alex Pulido, had been cen-
tral pieces of the Cardinal attack for
the last few years.
But freshman utility Alex Bowen
has been huge so far this season in
filling the scoring void left by the
strong graduating class. While Var
gas acknowledges that he "knew
[Bowen] was good," few could have
expected just how good Bowen
would turn out, a sentiment echoed
by his teammates.

"For a true freshman to have
something like 22 goals in eight
games, that's impressive, almost un
heard of," said junior driver Paul
Rudolph, who is no stranger to scor
ing goals early in his career
Rudolph's 33 goals were tied for sec
ond on the team last season.

Stanford made huge strides at
this past weekend's SoCal Tourna
ment, going 4-0 and earning a spot of
revenge by upsetting rival Cal and
then-No. 1 USC. Two weeks earlier,
Stanford had lost to both of those
teams at the NorCal Invitational.

Vargas attributes the two early
losses to the fact that four key play
ers Bowen, Rudolph, senior utili
ty Peter Sefton and redshirt fresh
man utility Nick Hoversten

joined the team late into the presea
son due to various national team
commitments.

"We weren't quite organized
yet," Vargas said, "and I knew going
forward we could improve a lot."
Although Stanford has already
played against several MPSF oppo
nents (including Cal and USC), this
weekend's games against Pepper
dine and UC-Santa Barbara mark
the start of official conference play.
Neither of these teams are tradition

al powerhouses, but Stanford has
stressed the importance that comes
with every conference game.
"Obviously our goal is to win the
NCAA championship," Rudolph
said. "But to do that we have to also
take care of the smaller steps on the
way, and that means taking every
MPSF game very seriously."
Pepperdine, which the Cardinal
will host in its home opener at 7 p.m.
this Friday, is a perfect example of a
conference team that Stanford can
not take for granted. Losing any
games can severely hurt the team's
chances of getting the at-large bid to
the NCAA Tournament, but losing
to a team outside of the top four can
be devastating. And the Waves are
no pushover, as Stanford discovered
firsthand this past weekend in a nar
row 7-6 victory in the quarterfinals
of the SoCal Tournament.

Pepperdine has a balanced offen
sive attack with a lot of good shoot

ers. Its two left-handed players give
the squad the diversity to shoot and
score from just about every position.
Fans who go to the game should ex
pect a tough, intense match that
could include a lot of goals.
With the No. 1 ranking already in
hand, Stanford has a chance for a
breakout season in 2011. The biggest
thing to look out for will be how the
team performs defensively "It's
all about the defense," Rudolf put it
bluntly. The Cardinal is relying on
fifth-year senior goalie Brian Pin
gree to anchor a team that has had its
fair share of inconsistent play on the
offensive end.

"We have great team chemistry
and a lot of depth," Rudolph said. "If
we can stay focused and not get com
placent ... we have the necessary
tools to do something great."

would turn out, a sentiment echoed
by his teammates.

"For a true freshman to have
something like 22 goals in eight
games, that's impressive, almost un
heard of," said junior driver Paul
Rudolph, who is no stranger to scor
ing goals early in his career
Rudolph's 33 goals were tied for sec
ond on the team last season.

Stanford made huge strides at
this past weekend's SoCal Tourna
ment, going 4-0 and earning a spot of
revenge by upsetting rival Cal and
then-No. 1 USC. Two weeks earlier,
Stanford had lost to both of those
teams at the NorCal Invitational.

Vargas attributes the two early
losses to the fact that four key play
ers Bowen, Rudolph, senior utili
ty Peter Sefton and redshirt fresh
man utility Nick Hoversten

joined the team late into the presea
son due to various national team
commitments.

"We weren't quite organized
yet," Vargas said, "and I knew going
forward we could improve a lot."
Although Stanford has already
played against several MPSF oppo
nents (including Cal and USC), this
weekend's games against Pepper
dine and UC-Santa Barbara mark
the start of official conference play.
Neither of these teams are tradition

al powerhouses, but Stanford has
stressed the importance that comes
with every conference game.
"Obviously our goal is to win the
NCAA championship," Rudolph
said. "But to do that we have to also
take care of the smaller steps on the
way, and that means taking every
MPSF game very seriously."
Pepperdine, which the Cardinal
will host in its home opener at 7 p.m.
this Friday, is a perfect example of a
conference team that Stanford can
not take for granted. Losing any
games can severely hurt the team's
chances of getting the at-large bid to
the NCAA Tournament, but losing
to a team outside of the top four can
be devastating. And the Waves are
no pushover, as Stanford discovered
firsthand this past weekend in a nar
row 7-6 victory in the quarterfinals
of the SoCal Tournament.

Pepperdine has a balanced offen
sive attack with a lot of good shoot

ers. Its two left-handed players give
the squad the diversity to shoot and
score from just about every position.
Fans who go to the game should ex
pect a tough, intense match that
could include a lot of goals.
With the No. 1 ranking already in
hand, Stanford has a chance for a
breakout season in 2011. The biggest
thing to look out for will be how the
team performs defensively "It's
all about the defense," Rudolf put it
bluntly. The Cardinal is relying on
fifth-year senior goalie Brian Pin
gree to anchor a team that has had its
fair share of inconsistent play on the
offensive end.

"We have great team chemistry
and a lot of depth," Rudolph said. "If
we can stay focused and not get com
placent ... we have the necessary
tools to do something great."

Junior driver Paul Rudolph looks to be one of the Cardinal's top scorers this year on a team that lost two Second Team All-Americans to graduation. The
squad enters conference play in the ever-challenging MPSF with hopes to earn one of two postseason bids for which it is eligible at the season's end.
