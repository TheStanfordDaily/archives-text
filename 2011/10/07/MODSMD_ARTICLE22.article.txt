# TOP 5
## BRUNO MARS AVERAGE DAY 
### 
Bruno Mars isn't shy. If the man has something to say, he'll
tell you, your sister and anyone else who cares to listen to
him sing over the same three chords. There are some days
when he doesn't feel like doing anything, but more often
than not he lives a life full of romantic promises and end
less excitement. In a life so complex, Intermission attempts
to condense an average day for Bruno into five activities.
"Do P90X"
In order to have some really nice sex and make the ladies
scream out "this is great," Bruno has to get his swell on.
What better way than turning his living room into a
body-sculpting wonderland?
"Throw his hand on a blade"
Although graphic (and probably intended as a hyperbolic
statement meant to seduce women), we assume that Bruno,
like the rest of us, has his fair share of shaving accidents.
"Chill in his Snuggie"
Bruno was raised in Honolulu and now resides in LA, so we're
not exactly sure why he would need to stay warm. But who
are we to judge? Snuggies are the clothes of the angels.
"Catch a grenade"
No, not a real grenade. That would hurt like a bitch. Bruno is
just an avid paintballer who uses state-of-the-art tools for
wiping out multiple enemies at once.
"Strut in his birthday suit"
Normally Intermission advises against nudity (not really). But
as tomorrow is his 26th birthday, we'll give him a free pass.
Happy Birthday, Bruno!
