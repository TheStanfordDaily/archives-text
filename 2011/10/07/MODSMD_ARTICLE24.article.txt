# APPLE'S ACCIDENTAL
## EMPIRE: THE RISE OF iOS GAMES 
### – nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
In 2008, Steve Jobs wasn't a
very popular man among
gamers. Faulting him for
what they considered a colos
sal waste of opportunity, a
vocal horde of developers,
pundits and gamers alike lam
basted the former Apple CEO
for keeping games out of the
spotlight on the wildly popular
iPhone and iPod Touch. When
the turtlenecked executive held

TIME
Magazine's
Invention of

the Year aloft, they saw an ele
gant interface, an accelerome
ter and a gorgeous screen.
With the debut of the App
Store, developers salivated at
the idea of distributing unique,
budget-priced games to an
exploding install base.
Jobs, though, saw a pro
ductivity booster. A Web
browser, pocketbook and
phone all rolled into one. In
his iOS Utopia of mobile
business and chic leisure,
gaming was a second-class

citizen, an image-sullying
embarrassment.
As far as game-makers
were concerned, Jobs' hyper
regulated App Store was a hos
tile place for business. At the
time, Apple controlled a non
negotiable portion of sales rev
enue over the service, didn't
support patching or updates
and failed to give developers a
proper avenue for distributing
pre-release games to critics.
As one of those iPhone
wielding skeptics back in 'OB,l
cracked a smile on Tuesday
reading through coverage of
Apple's first Jobs-less keynote.
Fresh off Jobs' departure from
the role, Apple boss Tim Cook
was widely expected to open
his reign with a showstopper;
namely, the iPhone 5. He did
n't. The only ace or maybe
jack or queen, depending on
who you ask up Cook's
sleeve was the somewhat
underwhelming iPhone 4S.


What piqued my interest,
though, was a less explicit trend
behind the headlines. Without the
nuclear mojo of a truly new iPhone to
usher in his term atop the Mac
maker, Cook leaned on another of

Apple's pillars to show that he meant
business. You guessed it: Cook was

hardly shy Tuesday about champi
oning the success and advancement of
games on iOS.

That's not to say that Cook's
ascent signals a new age of pro-game
policy from Apple at least, not on

its own. Rather, it's a subtle sign of an
extensive, quiet transformation. I give

some credit to Jobs for slowly chang
ing his tune toward gaming over the
years, but Cook is well aware that
even without Apple's encouragement,
the iPhone has become an absolute
monster of modern video games. In
that sense, he's inherited an accidental
empire.
Cook started off the keynote, of
course, with some chest-pumping
over Macs, iTunes and the upcoming
iOS 5. But games were right there in
the mix.
Cook made it clear that "one area
you really see [the iPhone 4S] scream
is in games" and took time to boast
about cloud saves and persistent pro

file support with the upcoming iOS 5,
launching this Wednesday. He even
welcomed developer Chair
Entertainment, a subsidiary of Epic
Games, to show off an Infinity Blade
II trailer that looked excellent by any
standard.

It was no E3 presentation to be

sure, but Apple gave games more time
and attention in yesterday's keynote
than most of those 'OB skeptics would
ever have guessed. Jobs would likely
have done so in his own time anyway
it's hard not to with games bring-

ing in so much cash but Cook
seems to have made a small but

important paradigm shift in the com
pany's outlook. Apple isn't just stand
ing by as small developers flourish
despite roadblocks in the iOS infra-

structure; it's actively promoting
games, pouring money into advertise
ments and new features and gasp
catering to the same core gamers
that it so rapidly distanced itself from
several years ago.
Apple's little turnaround is more
cold capitalism than a warm and

fuzzy embrace of gamers, but it's
remarkable nonetheless. Three years
ago, few would have predicted the

place of games in Tuesday's address,
much less their overall place on the

iOS platform. Entire companies are
built around iOS development, from
colossi like Gameloft to one-man
heartwarmers like Andreas Illiger
(Tiny Wings). Franchises like Angry
Birds have already outsold Mario,

innovation thrives with simple devel
opment tools and traditional third -

party devs like Epic and id
Carmack's id, let's remember flex
their graphical muscles on iOS in
ways normally reserved for EID con
soles. It's also the first successful
game-player with an exclusively digi-

tal distribution infrastructure, and
perhaps most impressively—has

Nintendo and Sony's portable divi
sions spending a bit more time at the
drawing board.
UPDATE: As you are no doubt
aware, Steve Jobs passed away earlier
this week. I want to extend my sincerest
condolences to his friends and family
and make it clear to readers that this

article was written in its entirety, as you
see it above, before I learned of Jobs'

passing. It is in no way an obituary or
retrospective on his life.
