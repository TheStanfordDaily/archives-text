# APPLE'S ACCIDENTAL
## EMPIRE: THE RISE OF iOS GAMES 
### â€“ nate ADAMS contact nate: nbadams@stanford. edu 
In 2008, Steve Jobs wasn't a
very popular man among
gamers. Faulting him for
what they considered a colos
sal waste of opportunity, a
vocal horde of developers,
pundits and gamers alike lam
basted the former Apple CEO
for keeping games out of the
spotlight on the wildly popular
iPhone and iPod Touch. When
the turtlenecked executive held

TIME
Magazine's
Invention of

the Year aloft, they saw an ele
gant interface, an accelerome
ter and a gorgeous screen.
With the debut of the App
Store, developers salivated at
the idea of distributing unique,
budget-priced games to an
exploding install base.
Jobs, though, saw a pro
ductivity booster. A Web
browser, pocketbook and
phone all rolled into one. In
his iOS Utopia of mobile
business and chic leisure,
gaming was a second-class

citizen, an image-sullying
embarrassment.
As far as game-makers
were concerned, Jobs' hyper
regulated App Store was a hos
tile place for business. At the
time, Apple controlled a non
negotiable portion of sales rev
enue over the service, didn't
support patching or updates
and failed to give developers a
proper avenue for distributing
pre-release games to critics.
As one of those iPhone
wielding skeptics back in 'OB,l
cracked a smile on Tuesday
reading through coverage of
Apple's first Jobs-less keynote.
Fresh off Jobs' departure from
the role, Apple boss Tim Cook
was widely expected to open
his reign with a showstopper;
namely, the iPhone 5. He did
n't. The only ace or maybe
jack or queen, depending on
who you ask up Cook's
sleeve was the somewhat
underwhelming iPhone 4S.
