As the Halloween season begins, the time has come to cozy
up in the movie theater with a big box of popcorn and a
hand to hold during the scary parts of the thrillers that
have become a seasonal treat. Fortunately, there is a new horror
movie each weekend to frighten and delight. Sadly, "Dream

House" is not one of those delightful flicks.
Advertised as a psychological horror thriller in the paranor
mal identity footsteps of "Shutter Island," "Dream House" inves
tigates the story of Will Atenton (played by the ever-shirtless
Daniel Craig) and his family. Will decides to quit his unimpor
tant, cosmopolitan job to spend more time in the suburbs with
his family. After moving into his new dream home, which looks
like every other home in the world because Will apparendy
dreams of mediocrity, he begins to notice strange things: his
neighbors won't speak to his family, his daughter sees a man out
side and a cliched group of misguided punk teenagers clandes
tinely hold a seance in his base-

ment. When Will and his
wife Libby (Rachel
Weisz) learn that the
previous father of the
house gruesomely mur
dered his entire family,
they finally decide that

maybe Will should ask around.
Throughout the first half of the movie, paranoia lingers over
the house with just a wisp of mysticism. Will's detective work
takes him from a neighboring house all the way to the insane
asylum. There, he learns the shocking twist (one that was given
away in the trailer, but mind the spoiler alert, just in case): Will is
not really Will he is the murdering father and has just been
paroled from the asylum. His family exists only as his hallucina
tions, and he has been imagining the house in its former state of
glory. The "dream" house is now revealed to be a decrepit shell,
and Will has either suddenly aged five years or instantaneously
developed a receding hairline, whichever seems more plausible.
The latter half devolves from a sub-standard hallucinatory
horror film to a Lifetime criminal investigation movie. The
melodrama is both overbearing and unexciting; a lecherous hus
band is brought into the fray, and the character of Libby just
hangs around in the background (because even though Will has
n't admitted she's fictitious, the movie certainly has accepted her


ghostly state) while Will talks with the mostly
unnecessary neighbor Ann (Naomi Watts).
The lazy candor of the film is finally
relinquished in the last 15 minutes. This is
not for the better. Director Jim Sheridan,

famous for helming ambitious Daniel Day-
Lewis projects circa 1993, abandons his typi
cal style of restrained melodrama for a fren
zied melange of nonsense that results in the
most perplexing and unemotional climax
seen in theaters this year.

While the film is by no means a success,
it isn't a total failure. There are brief

moments of legitimate albeit completely
cliche tension in the first half: small chil-

dren singing normal songs meant to seem
scary, shots of people at the top of basement
stairs, car attacks from an unseen driver, etc.
Unfortunately, Daniel Craig's hulky and
capable presence, Rachel Weisz's constantly
watery eyes and the ephemeral moments of
horror are nowhere near enough to save this

misguided movie from its uneven tone and
all-around lack of thrills, chills and blood
spills.
Here's looking forward to this coming
weekend's selection of horror: "The Human
Centipede 2."
