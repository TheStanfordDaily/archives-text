Based on Beau Wilßmon's play"Farragut North", George
Clooney's latest directorial effort "The Ides of March" is a
sharp and timely drama, whose allusions to the ruthless
ambition and corruption that run rampant in the game of
American politics hit all too close to home.
Campaigning on behalf of Governor Mike Morris
(Clooney), a blatantly Obama-inspired Democratic candidate
and presidential hopeful, political genius Stephen Meyers (Ryan
Gosling) finds his meteoric rise through the governor's camp on
the verge of collapse in a mere matter of days leading up to the
Ohio primary. Idealistic yet ambitious, Stephen starts out firmly
believing that Mike is the one who can make a difference in peo
ple's lives, even as others, including the team's campaign manager
Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman), remain cynical.
Unsettled when the opposing candidate's seedy campaign

manager Tom Duffy (Paul

Giamatti) suddenly tries
to get him to switch
sides, Stephen remains
convinced that he has
everything under con

moment that he loses it. In the

meantime, he must process a surprising secret that forces him to
look at his idol and mentor, Mike, in an entirely new light. As the
crucial primary election approaches, Stephen and Mike's political
fates become ever more intertwined.
Gosling is vibrant as always, capturing Stephen s gradual tran

work ethic to the formidable coldness that later becomes his
defense mechanism. Hoffman, Giamatti and Clooney, despite hav

resonates with authority. The heavyweight cast is rounded out by
solid performances from Marisa Tomei as a manipulative New
York Times reporter and Evan Rachel Wood as a seductive intern.
The smart script, co-written by Clooney, Willimon and
Grant Heslov, fits contemporary culture and politics like a glove.
While this is due, in part, to the fact that the original play was
inspired by events surrounding Howard Dean in 2004, there is no
denying that the visuals bear uncanny resemblance to Obama's
presidential campaign, and that the story takes bits and pieces
from the current national dialogue. The sex scandal that erupts
