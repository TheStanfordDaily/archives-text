Do boyfriends improve with age? Is it possible to have too
many sexual partners? What exacdy does it mean to go
"full Boraf'? Such insightful questions are explored in
Hollywood's latest entry in a string of uninspiring romantic
comedies, "What's Your Number?"
The film stars Anna Faris as Ally Darling, a scatterbrained
and quirky 20-something who, despite her best efforts, cannot
keep a boyfriend. In the midst of her messy love life, she has to
deal with soon-to-be-married sister Daisy (Ari Graynor), her
nosy mother (Blythe Danner) and her ladies' man of a neighbor,
Colin (Chris Evans).

Her life gets more complicated when she's fired from her job
and reads an article in Marie Claire that claims women with over

20 sexual partners are much

less likely to get married.
Horrified, she realizes
she has had 19 partners ,
and decides to track
down all her past lovers

about the same time, immediately sets to work on finding love
and getting married rather than, say, fixing her sudden unem
ployment problem. In addition, everyone around Ally—her sis
ter, her mother and her friends support her in this quest rather
than urging her to find a new job. In fact, her mother seems less
offended by the fact that Ally has gotten fired than by the fact that
her boyfriend of two months dumps her. Even though it's 2011,
the film's values seem to come straight from the 19505.
However, Anna Faris' presence makes "What's Your
Number?" bearable. With her signature raspy voice and impecca-
