## BRAINY BEAUTIES & CUTESY KLUTZES: What fall TV says about the state of feminism 
### — mayukh SEN contact mayukh: mayukh@stanford. edu 
The lipstick feminism that
characterized empowerment
narratives of 70s-era

American television, from "Wonder
Woman" to "Police Woman," had
obvious shortcomings. The catch

about these faux-feminist tales was
that the women were powerful only
when they were sexual. They were
operating within typical female sexu
al codes assigned to them by patriar
chal power structures before really
transcending them.
Looking at this fall's television
schedule, it seems we've reverted to
this retrograde sensibility. Female
characters dominate primetime nar
ratives, yet they exist only in the

world of Jiggle TV. Charlie is still
instructing his Angels, rescuing them
from the drear of their dead-end
lives so we can see them running
around in spandex. Hugh Hefner's
puppy-eyed playmates strut around
bars in their twee bunny suits in
"The Playboy Club." The stewardess
es of "Pan Am" fulfill every vintage
mile-high club fantasy.
It's easy to contextualize this
trend in recent television. In an age

when we're more obsessed with
"Mad Men" than ever, we can excuse
television as the opiate of the masses.
It satisfies our thirst for an escapist
fix. Providing eye candy byway of
scantily-clad femmes makes the pre-
Nixon era look benign and romantic.
Perhaps this is what we need in a
time like ours with Occupy Wall
Street, when we're forced to treat
optimism with caution.
To oversimplify this fall's rea
sonably intelligent new shows to a
simple case of misogyny is, however,
to do a great disservice to their sub
tleties. I'd like to suggest that these
shows when pulled off with
aplomb, at least offer a more

poignant feminist message than we'd

initially be willing to give them credit
for.

While it's true that the risible
new "Charlie's Angels," for example,
is deserving of this kind of distinc
tion, that's mainly because it fails to
create female characters of any con
sequence or depth. Whereas the orig
inal angels had a modicum of per
sonality most of all Kate Jackson's
refreshing, intelligent presence
these angels come across as soulless
automatons.

Contrast this with NBC's "The
Playboy Club", unfortunately nipped
in the bud too early, and ABC's "Pan
Am." Both shows take a retrograde
archetype that of the hyper-sexu
alized naif — and, placing her in a
pre-feminist era, turn the stereotype
on its head. These heroines aren't
centerfolds immune to the exploita
tive venom with which they're treat
ed. They are sharp. These women
understand that the men around
them reduce them to bodies and,
accordingly, they navigate their
worlds with an acute sense of self-

awareness.
This kind of tongue
in-cheek rendering of the
pre-feminist era is exactly
what television needs. Both
shows project a subtle fem
inistic subtext without
seeming anachronistic. It's
an especially far cry from
the contrived hipster drivel
of "New Girl," for example,
where kewpie doll Zooey
Deschanel immediately
enlists the help of three
male roommates after she
finds her boyfriend in bed
with another woman.
Something like Deschanel's
"gee golly" persona, or, say,

the self-effacing abrasiveness of
"Whitney's" Whitney Cummings, is
an archetype that forgoes presenting
women who are intellectually stimu
lating or capable of taking care of
themselves.

Television doesn't seem to be
well-adjusted to the idea of a woman
feeling in control of heroine identity
as a sexual being. That "The Playboy
Club" met its premature demise

speaks volumes about our collective
inability, as a television-watching

nation, to digest more nuanced por
traits of sexually independent women.
The most intriguing heroines of this
season, no matter what the most loyal
She & Him fans tell you, aren't the
dorky klutzes who don't know what
to do after their boyfriends leave.
Rather, they're the ones who radiate
quiet, unassuming intelligence and
resolve in the face of exploitation.
