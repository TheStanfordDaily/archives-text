Fans of "Fringe" know that
its days are numbered.
Despite the fervent fandom
that seems to gather around this
kind of show, the Fox series
never managed to pull in serious
numbers, and its move to the
Friday night death-slot only con
firms what people have suspect
ed. The writing's on the wall:
unless something spectacular
happens, this year is the last we'll
see the Fringe Division of either
parallel Earth.
It's interesting, then, that
with a finite number of episodes
left, the writers are spending time
reinventing the show. Peter
Bishop, one of the main charac

and Earth-2, was erased from
time in the Season 3 finale and
the first two episodes of the new
season spend considerable time
(including an exposition-heavy
rant from Walter Bishop)
explaining the historical differ
ences now that he's no longer
around. Olivia Dunham is as
cold as she was in season one,
and Walter Bishop is even less
stable. But these changes feel like
wasted space; the writers have
already sown the seeds of Peter's
return (as if there was any other
doubt), and it's somewhat diffi

timeline when it could snap back
at any moment.
