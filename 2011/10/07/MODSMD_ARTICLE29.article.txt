# LIFE ON THE 'FRINGE'

Fans of "Fringe" know that
its days are numbered.
Despite the fervent fandom
that seems to gather around this
kind of show, the Fox series
never managed to pull in serious
numbers, and its move to the
Friday night death-slot only con
firms what people have suspect
ed. The writing's on the wall:
unless something spectacular
happens, this year is the last we'll
see the Fringe Division of either
parallel Earth.
It's interesting, then, that
with a finite number of episodes
left, the writers are spending time
reinventing the show. Peter
Bishop, one of the main charac
ters and the unintentional cata
lyst for the war between Earth-1
and Earth-2, was erased from
time in the Season 3 finale and
the first two episodes of the new
season spend considerable time
(including an exposition-heavy
rant from Walter Bishop)
explaining the historical differ
ences now that he's no longer
around. Olivia Dunham is as
cold as she was in season one,
and Walter Bishop is even less
stable. But these changes feel like
wasted space; the writers have
already sown the seeds of Peter's
return (as if there was any other
doubt), and it's somewhat diffi
cult to care about the altered
timeline when it could snap back
at any moment.
However, this part of the
mythology has mostly been dealt
with on the fringes (no pun
intended) of the episodes so far.
The premiere was a formulaic

and unmemorable "freak of the

week" episode to showcase the new
dynamic of the team, but it ignored
what's most exciting about this new
season: the joining of Earths-1 and 2.
This was something the second
episode, "One Night in October"

handled with aplomb. Acting as both
Olivia and Fauxlivia (the Olivia of
Earth-2), Anna Torv managed to
show off some mean acting chops.
Since we first met Fauxlivia, Torv has
impressed me with her ability to pull
off two variations of the same char
acter, but until I saw them acting
alongside each other for an entire

episode I didn't appreciate the subtle
nuance used to distinguish them.
The differences extend beyond their
hair color and personality quirks to
the way they style and carry them
selves. Several actors on the show

play alternate versions of themselves,
of course, but none are as nuanced as

Torv's performances.
This was echoed by the primary
mystery of "October," when John

McClennan, a criminal profiler from
Earth-1, was brought in to investi
gate himself, a serial killer on Earth
2. Bringing an outsider in on the
madness that is Fringe Division was
a fantastic and much needed refrain
ing of the situation. The best stories
about the parallel worlds have always
involved how slight changes in our
history can radically change who we

are; while I felt that McClennan's
serendipitous encounter with the

woman who changed his life wasn't
particularly subtle, the episode is still
one of my favorite stories the show
has told using the two worlds.
There's no question that

"Fringe" is on its way out. But for the
first time, it's not too upsetting that a
show I enjoy is getting canceled. It's
not that it's a worse show I mean,
even "Dollhouse" upset me more

than this. But "Fringe" didn't live past
its prime, nor did it never reach its
full potential. It's a show with three
years of solid storytelling that's
reaching a natural conclusion. It's

true; I'm not sold on this season of
"Fringe" yet. The writers are playing
their long game a bit too close to the
chest for me to be invested in the arc

just yet. But when you look back at
older "Fringe" stories, it's fascinating
to see how the show has evolved.

Unlike certain other J.J. Abrams
shows, mysteries aren't used to lead
the audience on, but to push the
story forward. Solving one, like "the
Pattern," motivates another, like the
parallel worlds. Olivia put it best in
the premiere: "Sometimes answers

lead to more questions." It's practi
cally the show's mission statement.
"Fringe" may not be long for this (or
any) world, but it's clear that in the
meantime it has plenty of tricks up
its sleeve.
