# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Win 200 likely for Ratcliffe Mark could be reached tonight; UCLA to follow 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It has been less than a week
since the Stanford women's soccer
team set a record for the longest
conference win streak in Pac-12
history, but the milestones keep on
coming.
The No. 1 Cardinal (11-0-1, 3-0
Pac-12) can earn head coach Paul
Ratcliffe his 200th career win
tonight against USC before Stan
ford faces No. 2 UCLA in its tough
est test of the season, where a win
would make Stanford the only
team to beat the Bruins three years
in a row in the program's 18-year
history. To top it all off, the Cardinal
looks to extend its 52-game regular
season unbeaten streak and its per
fect stretch of 41 consecutive home
victories, not to mention the 23
straight conference wins it has com
piled over the last two and a half
seasons.
"You know, honestly, I don't
even think about the streaks," Rat
cliffe said. "I'm thinking game-to
game and how I can make the team
play to the best of its abilities and
try to win each game. That's how far
ahead I think."
In a tightly matched Pac-12,
Stanford simply can't afford to get
ahead of itself, as the squad nearly
learned the hard way last weekend.
After destroying Arizona 7-0 to
start conference play, the Pac-12 fa
vorite Cardinal was almost upend
ed not once but twice against
a pair of middle-of-the-pack Wash
ington schools. In each case, Stan
ford failed to score before the 85th
