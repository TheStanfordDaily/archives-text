# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Win 200 likely for Ratcliffe Mark could be reached tonight; UCLA to follow 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It has been less than a week
since the Stanford women's soccer
team set a record for the longest
conference win streak in Pac-12
history, but the milestones keep on
coming.
The No. 1 Cardinal (11-0-1, 3-0
Pac-12) can earn head coach Paul
Ratcliffe his 200th career win
tonight against USC before Stan
ford faces No. 2 UCLA in its tough
est test of the season, where a win
would make Stanford the only
team to beat the Bruins three years
in a row in the program's 18-year
history. To top it all off, the Cardinal
looks to extend its 52-game regular
season unbeaten streak and its per
fect stretch of 41 consecutive home
victories, not to mention the 23
straight conference wins it has com
piled over the last two and a half
seasons.
"You know, honestly, I don't
even think about the streaks," Rat
cliffe said. "I'm thinking game-to
game and how I can make the team
play to the best of its abilities and
try to win each game. That's how far
ahead I think."
In a tightly matched Pac-12,
Stanford simply can't afford to get
ahead of itself, as the squad nearly
learned the hard way last weekend.
After destroying Arizona 7-0 to
start conference play, the Pac-12 fa
vorite Cardinal was almost upend
ed not once but twice against
a pair of middle-of-the-pack Wash
ington schools. In each case, Stan
ford failed to score before the 85th
minute and needed a late tally to
come away with a win.
Midfielder Teresa Noyola, a re
cent nominee for the Lowe's Senior
CLASS Award who got the Cardi
nal its win over Washington with
her header goal in sudden-death
overtime, believes that the team
needs to improve its execution
after last weekend's close calls.

"We definitely had chances in
those games," she said. "I think it's
just a matter of getting the timing
right with our runs, penetrating
more into dangerous areas and
being even more efficient with our
attack."
Stanford will need all the of
fense it can get against a UCLA
team that ranks second in the con

ference (behind only the Cardinal)
in every major defensive statistical
category. The squads have nearly
identical goals-against averages,
.326 for the Cardinal and .356 for
the Bruins; both teams rank in the
top 20 nationally in that regard, as
well as for shutout and save per
centages.
Behind it all are two young goal-

tenders sophomore Emily Oliv
er for Stanford and freshman Kate
lyn Rowland for UCLA who
have each allowed three or fewer
goals in over 750 minutes of playing
time, Oliver does have a year as a
starter under her belt, though much
like her Stanford counterpart,
Rowland racked up extensive ex
perience as a member of U.S. Na
tional Teams as a teenager.
The Cardinal has scored nearly
twice as many goals as the Bruins
have, but for a Stanford group
which apart from the blowout
against Arizona hasn't won by
more than two tallies in over a
month, facing a dominant goal
tender will be all the more diffi
cult. Those challenges are only ex
acerbated by the continued ab
sence of junior forward Courtney
Verloo, who is still out with a left
meniscus tear suffered before the
season. While Ratcliffe admitted
that Verloo's recovery got off to a
slow start, he is still hoping that
she can return to game action this
season.

Given these obstacles, the Car
dinal can't afford to overlook its
opponent tonight. USC may not
sport Stanford's elite record, but
the Trojans have been competitive
in six straight games many
times, against tough opponents
only to lose each by a single goal. If
the offensive struggles continue,
the storylines could look much the
same tonight as they did last week
end.

"It's tough; we're playing hard
opponents, and the hardest part of
the game is scoring goals," Ratcliffe
said. "So we're going to have to be a
little bit sharper ... hopefully we'll
get some early goals against both
USC and UCLA, and that will real
ly help our confidence."
Stanford hopes to get Ratcliffe
to 200 wins tonight at 7 p.m.
against USC before the power
house Bruins roll into town for a 1
p.m. Sunday matchup that could
be a significant challenge to the
Cardinal's impressive home, con
ference and regular-season win
streaks.

GAME NOTES: Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe has the chance to earn his 200th
career win tonight, while the Cardinal
hopes to extend its conference-record 23
straight wins in Pac-12 play. USC, mean
while, is reeling after six one-goal losses in
a row. The Cardinal wants to avoid getting
off to a slow start, as was the case in both
close victories last weekend.

Stanford unbeaten. Tonight, she and the Cardinal will try to get head coach Paul Ratcliffe his 200th career win.
