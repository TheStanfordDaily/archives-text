## A 						LOOK AT THE FEMALE-CENTRIC SHOWS THIS FALL 
### 
Charlie's Angels

Frustratingly self-important, this reboot of the 1970s camp
classic is relentlessly dreary it's like "Charlie's Angels" in need
of Prozac. Where the original teemed with cheery, gleeful self
awareness, this new one is dull, dark and serious. The actresses,
ranging from the nondescript to downright unappealing, lack
the charisma needed to sustain this morose storyline they're
no Farrah Fawcett.

The Playboy Club

Though NBC cancelled the show this week after three episodes,
the style, something of a hybrid between Scorsese and soft
porn, could've potentially given way to a fascinating weekly for
mat. Amber Heard is one of Hollywood's more interesting
young actresses, and her intelligent, mature presence here was
exciting. Though the script's sensibilities were a bit too contem
porary to fall in line with the exquisite period settings, it's filled
with visual opulence that is, at times, arresting.

New Girl

The cutesy Zooey Deschanel showcase maintains the same level
of good-but-not-greatness it debuted at three weeks ago. It's
definitely still smarting from the loss of Damon Wayans Jr.'s
Coach though Lamorne Morris's Winston isn't entirely unlike
able. Now that the show is officially not going anywhere (at
least for this season), the bare minimum it can do is tone down
that awful Schmidt character.

Whitney

"Whitney" is a halfhearted NBC series about an annoying bois
terous painter (Whitney Cummings) and her attempts to bring
her life with boyfriend Alex (Chris D'Elia) out of a rut after
three years together. The show includes a cliched supporting
cast of the thrice-divorced mother, alcoholic best friend (also
divorced) and hopelessly romantic and clingy best friend
(whipped boyfriend included!). Though "Whitney" has its
moments, you may be left wondering if the show wouldn't ben
efit from stronger actors and a more inspired plot.

Prime Suspect

Visibly world-weary,
wrinkled and hard
ened, Maria Bello is
astonishingly unin
hibited in this
remake of the origi
nal British smash hit
starring Helen
Mirren. Though the
show seems to take
an overly doctrinaire
approach to femi
nism, each episode
seems incredibly fas
cinated with Bello's

character. This sensitivity is incredibly affecting, and Bello, a
gifted performer, delivers in spades.

Pan Am

Glossy and nostalgic, the show doesn't apologize for taking a
contrarian, overly soigne view of the past. Though the script
itself is often overly simplistic in its rendering of female charac
ters, the actresses particularly Christina Ricci communi
cate an intelligence beyond these cardboard caricatures. An
enjoyable trifle.

2 Broke Girls

Kat Dennings' deliv
ery can wring laughs
out of the lamest
jokes, and Beth
Behrs manages to
find the likable side
of what could be
another ditzy blonde
cliche, so why can't
"2 Broke Girls" get
its act together? The
other Whitney
Cummings sitcom of
the fall started off
funny, nosedived its
second week then
floated back up to
mediocre. Good thing

CBS just gave the show a full-season order to figure it all out.
