For a band that began as a mere side
project of the wildly successful
Something Corporate, Jack's
Mannequin composed of singer/song
writer Andrew McMahon, guitarist Bobby
Anderson, bassist Mikey "The Kid" Wagner
and drummer Jay McMillan has proven
to have remarkable staying power, accruing
an impressive following over the years.
Their newest release, "People and Things,"
may seem like a fairly innocuously titled
album, but for Jack's Mannequin's Andrew
McMahon, it is loaded with meaning.

While fans of Something Corporate or
Jack's Mannequin will be well-versed in
McMahon's biographical details, particular
ly his victorious battle against leukemia, the
untrained ear will detect no evidence on
this album of any setbacks or struggles that
may have marred the singer's recent life. In
fact, McMahon's illness and subsequent
recovery seem to have only made him
stronger, both as a person and as a musi
cian. As the third Jack's Mannequin studio
album, "People and Things" speaks vol
umes about McMahon's musical depth and
versatility.

While he was fighting to stay alive and
combat his disease, McMahon allegedly let
many people fall by the wayside. This album
seems to be his way of making up for lost
time and proving to the world that he is more
than just okay. The musician has remained
humble about his great accomplishments and
does not want his hard-earned recovery to be
the focus of this release.

In the innovative "trailer" the band cre
ated for "People and Things," Andrew
McMahon gives insight into his thoughts on
the album.

"I love this album," he said. "For what it

says, and for
what it took
to get there.
And it may not
be life-or-death,

but it's life." McMahon is not just being poet
ic here, as "People and Things" really is a
compilation of songs about life and the peo
ple and things that make it beautiful.
In recent interviews, McMahon stated
that he never intended to do more than one
album with jack's Mannequin, and that this
latest release may be his last with the band.
The album would certainly serve as a fitting
finale, as it combines elements of its preced-

ing albums ("Everything in Transit" and
"The Glass Passenger") with McMahon's
new outlook on life to create a finished prod
uct that is both aesthetically appealing and
emotionally compelling. The rich, almost lilt
ing piano melodies that typified the music of
Something Corporate are still here in force,
as are the uplifting drum beats. But "People
and Things" boasts a new sense of maturity
that separates it from the band's previous
works. McMahon still croons about love and

relationships in his crystalline voice, but this
is love of a different sort not a teenage
dream but an adult actuality.
The sophisticated subject matter is
accompanied by a clear musical progression.
The album opens with the sunny-sounding
"My Racing Thoughts," which sees
McMahon singing about his marital life
against a backdrop of intertwining piano and
drums. A couple tracks later, "Amy, I" is the
most stereotypically "pop" song on the
album, and its catchy chorus is sure to make
the track a radio favorite. Next, "Hey Hey
Hey (We're All Gonna Die)" is lyrically the
darkest track on the album, blatantly
acknowledging McMahon's close call with
death while managing to sound melodically
moving. Other tracks reveal the band's musi
cal influences, such as "Amelia lean," which
channels Billy Joel's piano-driven melodies
and syncopated drums. The album's penulti
mate song, "Resdess Dream," sports Bob
Dylan-esque guitar chords and is full of raw
emotion, marking a brief foray into folk-rock
sound. Finally, "Casting Lines" brings the
album full-circle as McMahon sings about
going home in what could easily be a track
off of Something Corporate's "Ready...
Break." Though there will always be some
thing of Something Corporate in the music
of Jack's Mannequin, "People and Things" is
a completely original work that highlights the
talents of the band and will have you hanging
on to every note from start to finish.
