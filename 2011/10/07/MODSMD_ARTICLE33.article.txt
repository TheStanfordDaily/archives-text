## ROXY SASS Roxy's favorite pastime 
### 
oxy is always looking to score,
and there's no better time to
-A- Xget LUCK-y than during
football season. This year, Roxy has
never been more excited to watch
guys running around in tight pants.
While she usually eschews full-con
tact sports outside the bedroom,
she's willing to make an exception
for everyone's favorite fall pastime.
And what better reason to get out of
bed on a Saturday morning than to
make some big plays on (and off)
the field?
Pre-game
Want to get close to that cutie
you've been eyeing? The best way to
get physical is with some group
body-painting. When spelling out
"GO STANFORD," Roxy always gets
the O; follow her lead and lift up
your shirt for the same effect.
Because the University moved
all of the student tailgates to outside
of Arrillaga this year, Roxy has start
ed "networking" with young alumni
by checking out the parties in the
Eucalyptus grove before a game.
Although some people complain
about how early in the day the tail
gates start, Roxy always appreciates
that they last for hours.
Showdown
Roxy likes the game itself more
than you might expect, and she's
always happy to chat up the ho the
standing nearby about 10ng... pass
es and the importance of going deep.
Though she hates unsportsman-like
conduct on the field, in the stands,
Roxy plays by her own rules. But

Roxy tends to play rough, so it might
be best to wear a little padding.
Another strategy: always avoid
incompletions.
When the game starts to wear
thin, Roxy starts planning ways to
wear nothing. Ultimately, she's all
about stamina, and will prolong her
screaming until the home team fin
ishes.
Post-game celebrations
Once all the touchdowns are
completed, Roxy is ready to get
sacked. Now that Stanford is a foot
ball school, it seems like nothing gets
people going more than the adrena
line rush of a game. Excited after a
big win? Roxy knows just where to
channel that energy. Dejected after a
tough loss? Roxy's here to console
you (just kidding. Roxy knows the
only things that will be lost at the
end of a football game are her
clothes).
Roxy hates a delay of game.
Make sure you come ready to play.

pro with her hands. Request a one-on
one training session at
