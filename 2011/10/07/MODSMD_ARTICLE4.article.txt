# BUFF STUFF
## COLORADO D-LINE WILL CHALLENGE CARD 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After extending its win streak
to 12 games last week, the Stanford
football team hosts Colorado this
Saturday with a chance to stretch
the streak to lucky number 13.

With a win, the No. 7 Cardinal
(4-0, 2-0 Pac-12) would tie the
school record for consecutive wins
and redshirt junior quarterback
Andrew Luck would become the
school's all-time leader in career
wins as a starter, as he and Steve
Stenstrom are currently tied for
first with 24 career victories.

The Buffaloes (1-4, 0-1) don't
appear to pose much of a threat to
the Cardinal's win streak after
struggling through the first five

games of the season, with their
only win coming against rival Col
orado State. Additionally, head
coach Jon Embree suspended five
defensive players earlier this week
for an unspecified violation of
team rules more unfortunate
trouble for a team that already al
lows 30.4 points per game.
But the Buffaloes do present a
distinct challenge that the Cardi
nal has yet to tangle with so far this
season: a devastating pass rush.
Colorado averages more than 3.5
sacks per game, registering 18 total
sacks already, a stat that puts the
Buffaloes at sixth overall in the na
tion.

Linebackers Josh Hartigan
(four sacks), Douglas Rippy
(three) and Jon Major (two) have

the bulk of the tackles for loss in
the Buffs' 3-4 defensive scheme,
and defensive end Chidera Uzo-
Diribe has also contributed 3.5
sacks, presenting a new challenge
for the Cardinal offensive line,
which has only allowed two sacks
so far this season.

Of course, one of the best ways
to prevent your superstar quarter
back from being hit is not to pass at
all something the Cardinal has
done very well lately, and will most
likely lean on heavily against Col
orado, which gives up the second
fewest yards through the air in the
Pac-12.

For the past two games, the Car
dinal has leaned on a quartet of
runners to pile up 444 yards on the
ground, mostly behind junior Step
fan Taylor, who head coach David
Shaw called "one of the most un
derrated backs in the nation" after
he ran for 112 yards against
UCLA.

For a team that scores 45.3
points per game and boasts Luck's
superstar passing ability, Shaw
gave credit to the offensive line,
saying that "90 percent" of the run
ning backs' success was due to the
outstanding play of the guys up
front.

"Running backs are good if
they can get to the line. If they get
hit behind the line, outside of
Barry Sanders, every back is going
to struggle," Shaw said. "So when
our line can block the line and get
our guys to the line of scrimmage,
[the running backs] get a chance to
do what they do best."
Junior running back Tyler
Gaffney also pointed out how the
offensive line which was forced
to replace three starters from last
season has been instrumental
to the dominant running game.

"It's a great morale booster be
cause when each back comes in,
the line can feel the tendencies of
each back," Gaffney said. "It's just
an awesome competition to bring
out everybody's best."

Shaw says that the various tal
ents of his backfield foursome also
give him options as a play caller

NOTES ! The No. 7 Cardinal faces a beat-up
secondary for the second week in a row,
with several Colorado players either

quarterback Andrew Luck will try to repeat
his stellar performance last Saturday.

is paving the way for the Cardinal's deadly play-action pass. Taylor went for 112 yards last week against UCLA.
