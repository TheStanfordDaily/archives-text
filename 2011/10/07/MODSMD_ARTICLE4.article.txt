# BUFF STUFF
## COLORADO D-LINE WILL CHALLENGE CARD 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After extending its win streak
to 12 games last week, the Stanford
football team hosts Colorado this
Saturday with a chance to stretch
the streak to lucky number 13.

With a win, the No. 7 Cardinal
(4-0, 2-0 Pac-12) would tie the
school record for consecutive wins
and redshirt junior quarterback
Andrew Luck would become the
school's all-time leader in career
wins as a starter, as he and Steve
Stenstrom are currently tied for
first with 24 career victories.

The Buffaloes (1-4, 0-1) don't
appear to pose much of a threat to
the Cardinal's win streak after
struggling through the first five

games of the season, with their
only win coming against rival Col
orado State. Additionally, head
coach Jon Embree suspended five
defensive players earlier this week
for an unspecified violation of
team rules more unfortunate
trouble for a team that already al
lows 30.4 points per game.
But the Buffaloes do present a
distinct challenge that the Cardi
nal has yet to tangle with so far this
season: a devastating pass rush.
Colorado averages more than 3.5
sacks per game, registering 18 total
sacks already, a stat that puts the
Buffaloes at sixth overall in the na
tion.

Linebackers Josh Hartigan
(four sacks), Douglas Rippy
(three) and Jon Major (two) have

the bulk of the tackles for loss in
the Buffs' 3-4 defensive scheme,
and defensive end Chidera Uzo-
Diribe has also contributed 3.5
sacks, presenting a new challenge
for the Cardinal offensive line,
which has only allowed two sacks
so far this season.

Of course, one of the best ways
to prevent your superstar quarter
back from being hit is not to pass at
all something the Cardinal has
done very well lately, and will most
likely lean on heavily against Col
orado, which gives up the second
fewest yards through the air in the
Pac-12.

For the past two games, the Car
dinal has leaned on a quartet of
runners to pile up 444 yards on the
ground, mostly behind junior Step
fan Taylor, who head coach David
Shaw called "one of the most un
derrated backs in the nation" after
he ran for 112 yards against
UCLA.

For a team that scores 45.3
points per game and boasts Luck's
superstar passing ability, Shaw
gave credit to the offensive line,
saying that "90 percent" of the run
ning backs' success was due to the
outstanding play of the guys up
front.

"Running backs are good if
they can get to the line. If they get
hit behind the line, outside of
Barry Sanders, every back is going
to struggle," Shaw said. "So when
our line can block the line and get
our guys to the line of scrimmage,
[the running backs] get a chance to
do what they do best."
Junior running back Tyler
Gaffney also pointed out how the
offensive line which was forced
to replace three starters from last
season has been instrumental
to the dominant running game.

"It's a great morale booster be
cause when each back comes in,
the line can feel the tendencies of
each back," Gaffney said. "It's just
an awesome competition to bring
out everybody's best."

Shaw says that the various tal
ents of his backfield foursome also
give him options as a play caller

NOTES ! The No. 7 Cardinal faces a beat-up
secondary for the second week in a row,
with several Colorado players either
injured or suspended. Redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck will try to repeat
his stellar performance last Saturday.

Junior running back Stepfan Taylor (center) has headlined an increasingly dominant Stanford rushing attack, which
is paving the way for the Cardinal's deadly play-action pass. Taylor went for 112 yards last week against UCLA.
that many teams would be envious of.
"[Taylor] is a 'Steady Eddie.' He just
does everything right, he has uncanny bal
ance and quickness and vision, and he's a
guy that's our leader," Shaw said. "Gaffney
can be a bit more physical because he's a
bigger guy, but he's got speed in space also,
he runs through arm tackles and has great
hands to catch the ball out of the backfield.
[Sophomore Anthony Wilkerson] is the
fastest of the group ... and then [senior] Je
remy Stewart is probably our most physical
back between the tackles."

However, Shaw did mention that there
are some challenges that come with having
four backs as solid as Mount Rushmore.

"I tell these guys all the time, every week
somebody's going to get slighted and it's not
intentional, it's just kind of happens with the
flow of the game," Shaw said.
"Like against Arizona, Wilkerson didn't
get any touches at all, and this past week he
had seven. It's something that we battle
through and we try to keep those guys into
the game, not because we just like them, but
because they've earned it and they're good
players," he added.
Conversely, Colorado cannot brag much
about its offense, as the team's first cam
paign in the Pac-12 has been a tough one so
far. The Buffs rank second-to-last in both
scoring offense and total offense in the con
ference, and their task does not get much
easier this week against a Stanford defense
that is first in both scoring defense and total
defense.

The Buffaloes' lone bright spot on of
fense is wide receiver Paul Richardson, who
has 474 yards receiving and five touch
downs, and absolutely torched the Cal de
fense for 284 yards and two touchdowns

four weeks ago in a 36-33 overtime loss to
the Bears.
Richardson poses a challenge mostly be
cause the Cardinal defensive backs were in
a shuffle last weekend against UCLA after
starting sophomore cornerback Barry
Browning was held out with back spasms.
Junior corner Terrence Brown filled in ad

mirably in Browning's absence, but all indi
cations are that Browning will play this Sat
urday.
The Cardinal and Buffaloes will kick off
at 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 8.

Senior left tackle Jonathan Martin (No. 55) will have his hands full on Saturday protecting
quarterback Andrew Luck's blindside. Colorado's pass rush is one of the best in the nation
and will present the toughest challenge yet for an O-line that has allowed just two sacks so far.
