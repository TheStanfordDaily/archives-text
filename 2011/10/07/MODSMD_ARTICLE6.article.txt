## STUDENT GOV'T ASSU initiates Gov Doc reform process Bylaws, constitution may change over course of school year 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The first meeting of the newly
created ASSU Governing Docu
ments committee met Thursday
night in Old Union. The initiative,
spearheaded by ASSU Executive
President Michael Cruz 'l2 and
Vice President Stewart Macgre
gor-Dennis 'l3, aims to examine
the basic structure of the ASSU
and improve the organization by
potentially changing the ASSU by
laws and constitution.

"The thrust of it [the committee]
should be the re-examination of the
structure of the ASSU compared to
its effectiveness of serving stu
dents," Macgregor-Dennis said.
The meeting lasted 50 minutes
and covered what role the ASSU
should play in serving the Univer
sity, as well how it should be struc
tured as an organization.
Only four of the 10 voting mem
bers on the committee were at the
meeting, though by acting as prox
ies, the group was able to reach
quorum and continue the meeting.
The constitutionality of that
move was the subject of several
jokes from former Elections Com
missioner and non-voting member
of the Governing Documents
committee, Stephen Trusheim 'l3,
who suggested that the sub-com
mittee that examines rules and
best practices should consider
making rules that can be followed
practically.
Cruz decided to begin by dis
cussing the structure of the ASSU
because it would be easier to ar
rive at a consensus. However this
proved difficult, as even the basic
assumption that the ASSU should
be a tri-cameral government with
executive, legislative and judicial
branches, was met with questions.

Trusheim pointed out that some
aspects of the ASSU, such as the
Nominations Commission (Nom-
Com) and Executive committee,
are independent and do not truly
report to any other group. For ex
ample, the students appointed to
various University boards by the
NomCom do not report back to
any department of the ASSU, a
problem that Trusheim noted and
Cruz agreed with.
An example of one of these
groups is the newly-created De
partment of Internal Review
(DIR), which is intended to be in
dependent of any branch of the
ASSU. However members of the
committee expressed that they did
not clearly understand its purpose.
Cruz described it as a hybrid of
what the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) and Government
Accountability Office (GAO) do
for the U.S. government, prompt
ing Constitutional Chair Samir
Siddhanti 'l2 to ask, "What does
that mean?"

Another issue was whether or
not the ASSU should be responsi
ble for putting on student events
or initiating events students enjoy.
Cruz decided on the phrasing, "im
plement and support events,"
which led current Elections Com
missioner and non-voting member
Adam Adler 'l2 to quip, "That's
vague enough."
Even meeting attendees ques
tioned the structure of the Gov
erning Documents committee dur
ing the meeting. Voting member
and Senate Parliamentarian Alex
Kindel 'l4 said, "I'm worried about
having 10 members and 11 sub
committees," expressing concern
over the large number of subcom
mittees that Cruz set up within the
committee.

The committee plans to contin
ue to meet and discuss ideas on
how to reform the ASSU and have
a clearer mission, with the ultimate
goal of improving efficacy.
