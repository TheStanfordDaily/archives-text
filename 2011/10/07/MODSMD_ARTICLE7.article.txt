## Physics prof. Lev wins national career award Presidential Early Career Award to go to Stanford researcher 
### JOHN BURKE 
Assistant professor of applied
physics Benjamin Lev, who moved
to Stanford last month from the
physics department at the Universi
ty of Illinois, has been named by
President Barack Obama to receive
the Presidential Early Career
Award for Scientists and Engineers.
He will be honored at the White
House Oct. 14, along with 94 other
recipients of the award.
Lev was nominated in recogni
tion of breakthroughs he and his re
search group made in laser-cooling
techniques and cold-temperature
quantum physics. His research fo
cused on the study of strongly cor
related quantum systems, a class of
matter that exhibits very strange
and interesting properties but is
often very hard to study in detail.
Specifically his team managed to
cool dysprosium, the most magnetic
element on the periodic table, to the
necessary level in order to study it, a
breakthrough that successfully
earned him the award.
Lev said that while he did not
know about the award before any
one else did, he did see a warning
sign.

"I heard about it pretty much
when everyone else did, but I had an
inkling when the FBI contacted me
about a background check a week
or so earlier," Lev said.
According to the U.S. Depart
ment of Health and Human Ser
vice's website, the Presidential
Award is the "highest honor be
stowed by the U.S. government on
outstanding scientists and engi
neers beginning their independent
careers."

Since this breakthrough, Lev
and his research group have been
using their novel laser-cooling tech
niques to create new, exotic states of
matter from ultra-cold dysprosium
gases. This past summer, they creat
ed the first dysprosium Bose-Ein
stein condensate, a state of matter
in which the matter waves of all of
the atoms in the system synchro
nize, creating strange quantum ef
fects.

They have also used dysprosium
to create quantum liquid crystals, a
state of matter sharing many of the
properties of the liquid crystals
used in LCD screens, but with addi
tional quantum effects arising from
the tiny scale and temperature of
the system.
Lev said the goal of his research
was to "understand underlying or
ganizing principles of complex
quantum matter to use them to de
sign useful materials or make useful
devices for quantum computing

memory."
"I think the most important ben
efit [of the award] will be garnering
recognition for the work done by
my grad students, and helping me
recruit bright young students in the
future."

In addition to his study of strong
ly correlated systems and exotic
quantum matter, Lev has been
working recently on two other re
lated projects. The first involves
using dysprosium, and his research
team's innovative techniques for
cooling and controlling it, to create
the world's most precise magnetic
microscope.

The other ongoing project con
sists of attempts to create true crys
tals out of atoms and light, using
complex patterns of laser interfer
ence to create three-dimensional
lattices out of light and hold the
atoms into a crystalline structure.
