## Internet unregulated, vulnerable to attack, McLaughlin says in lecture

It can be hard to know what to believe on the Internet.

Andrew McLaughlin, former Deputy Chief Technolo
gy Officer for the Obama Administration, gave the first
lecture in a series hosted by the Center on Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law (CDDRL).

In the talk, he outlined several vulnerabilities of the in
frastructure of the Internet and the difficulties in over
coming them.

"There are three particular global infrastructure secu
rity issues," McLaughlin said. "What they all have in com
mon is that they present a model of diffuse, decentralized
responsibility and broad coordination and implementa
tion where essentially nobody is in charge."
The first problem he outlined is the issue of the "name
server," part of the system that tells your browser where to
go when you type in an Internet address.
"If someone can get between you and one of the name
servers and act like one of the name servers, they can send
back responses that your computer will trust but that are
false," McLaughlin said. "So they can send you to some
thing that they've set up that looks like Gmail, and when
you type your password into [it], they have your pass
word."

Surprisingly, acting as a name server is remarkably easy

to accomplish. The conversation between you and the
"name server" is often "in plain text out over the Internet."
"This protocol was built for the Internet when security
was just not a big consideration," McLaughlin continued.
"The Internet was just a network of universities linked to
gether, trusting each other, basically."
The trust inherent in the Internet architecture is appar
ent in the "trust -based" communications between ISPs as
well. Different ISPs are responsible for different IP ad
dresses. To locate specific sites, ISPs around the world an
nounce which IP addresses they have using "route an
nouncements."

The problem is that these announcements are not ver
ified by anyone. It is up to the ISPs to do it correctly, which
can lead to problems. In 2006 a small Pakistani ISP "an
nounced" You Tube, accidentally shutting down both
You Tube and the Internet in Pakistan.

In more sinister hands, this weakness can be exploited
to selectively turn websites off.

"There was an incident in 2009 where China Telecom
munications Corporation (China Telecom) suddenly start
ed announcing about 15 percent of the world's routes which
they were not, in fact, responsible for," McLaughlin said.
"China Telecom has now been sort of caught red-handed
both hijacking routes on a temporary basis and also occa-
