The $4 million National Poverty
Research Center grant has been
awarded to Stanford's Center for the
Study of Poverty and Inequality by
the Office of the Assistant Secretary
for Planning and Evaluation in the
Department of Health and Human
Services.

The grant, to which the Universi
ty has pledged an additional $2 mil
lion contribution, will be used in a
national center which monitors,
elucidates and originates science
based policies on trends in policy
and inequality. Its major develop
ment will be a web portal that
makes hundreds of statistics on the
issue as well as related scientific
research readily available to the
general public.

"This is a critical moment in U.S.
history in which poverty is growing,
long-term unemployment is increas
ing and income inequality is reach
ing an all-time high," said Center Di

rector and professor of sociology
David Grusky in a statement to the
Stanford Report. "The new center
will be dedicated not just to monitor
ing these trends, not just to uncover
ing what drives them, but also to un
derstanding how national economic
policies affect them."
The center will focus on regional
issues as well as national ones. For
example, the new California Welfare
Laboratory (C-WELL) will high
light poverty and inequality issues in
California specifically.
Stanford representatives will
work closely with two other Nation
al Poverty Centers at UC-Davis and
the University of Wisconsin, Madi
son, as well as Assistant Secretary for
Planning and Evaluation in the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services Sherry Glied.
President Hennessy related the
grant to the Stanford Challenge.
"The Stanford Challenge, which
we set forth five years ago, commit
ted the University to seeking solu
tions to society's most formidable
problems," he said in a statement to
the Report. "This new national cen
ter allows us, in a very real way, to ex
pand on that commitment."
