## NARRATIVE WALK ON THE EDGE 
### TORI LEWIS 
I walked out the door, hopped
on my bike and braced myself
for the long ride to Stanford's
edge Cantor Arts Center.
Peddling closer and closer, I
heard music radiating from Party
On the Edge. Once I reached a fair
distance, I parked my bike a block
away and passed by the Rodin
sculptures that lurked in their
dimly lit, shadow-covered garden.
Once past the garden, I traipsed
through the metal graveyard made
up of carelessly strewn bikes. Stu
dents came from far and wide to ex
perience a different type of party
on Thursday night.
As I reached the entrance, shim
mering steel pan drums greeted me
with the melodies of Cardinal Ca
lypso. Next, a wave of heat over
across my face and fingers, defrost
ing them from the brisk, biking air.
Students all over shed their jackets
as they absorbed the myriad events
around them. They had arrived to
Party On the Edge.
After taking it all in, I began
walking across the venue. After just
a few steps, a student stopped me
and thrust a pencil and
post-it notes into my s
hands. He pointed
toward the
"Idea Wall"
and encour
aged me to
share my "

Stanford arts experiences. I pon
dered what to write while looking
at the wall's progress. Initially, the
wall was bare, but as more students
arrived, writing crept across the
wall like ivy. Comments included
philosophical thoughts and re
quests for more arts on the Farm.
"More opera!" one student
wrote.
While I stood at the "Idea Wall,"
I heard the whispers of one fresh
man. He mumbled possible ideas,
but couldn't decide what to write.
He pondered for several minutes.
Then, stumped, he stormed back to
the table with the post-its and
slammed his idea pad down.
"I don't know anything about
arts at Stanford," he said.
After also being lost for words, I
stood back, observed others' ideas

and smiled. I placed the pencil and
post-its back on the table and con
tinued browsing. Friends jumped in
front of me to greet me. Some were
enthusiastic about their imminent
performance. Others were nervous
and discouraged me from watching
their show. Either way, I was excit
ed about the night that awaited me.
As I reached the student art gal
leries, I made my way through a
dense pack of students. Some guests
nudged each other as they snapped
pictures of the artwork. Others chat
ted about summer vacations, dorms
and classes.
Somehow, I felt the other stu
dents and I were out of place. I felt
as though our jeans and sweatshirts
clashed with the elegance of the
event. We weren't dressed up like
the typical museum-going, art-col
lecting crowd. We were Stanford
students, simply searching

for a study break and a relaxing
time. Yet it wasn't fake or inappro
priate.
Suddenly, a project created by
Santhi Elayaperumal M.S. 'O9,
Ph.D. 'l4 and Greg Kress M.S. 'O9,
Ph.D. 'l4 began to move. Gasps
filled the crowd.
"Oh snap," a woman yelled.
This project combined technol
ogy and art, as it used energy from
plants to power a robotic pen.
After this show, I stepped back and
absorbed the atmosphere once again.
The many displays overwhelmed me.
There was no way to see and truly ap
preciate all the pieces. Artwork
blurred with guests, one body that
danced as the night continued.
The week's rain stopped for this
party. The clouds parted and the sky
cleared. The moon glis
tened white. It was truly a
beautiful evening.
I biked home feeling re
juvenated. It wasn't just
because of the break from
studying, the cool night air
or the spiced tea I drank. It
was the joy that came over
me after seeing the beauty
and talent of my peers. Stan
ford is, in more than one as
pect, a work of art.
