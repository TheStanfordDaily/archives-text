## FRESHMAN '15 The 						roommate 
### Bianco Chavez 
I had a jam-packed summer. While
many of my classmates were trav
eling the world and interning at
Fortune 500 companies, I spent the
break doing two things: watching
every trashy MTV reality show ever
filmed (I now feel so emotionally in
vested in the lives of the Teen Moms
that I'm probably going to send
them all Christmas cards) and think
ing about my future roommate.
I wondered about her nonstop.
Where would she be from? What
would she look like? Would she be a
party-goer or one of those kids who
likes to be in bed by 10 p.m. every
night? Most importantly, would her
room decor coordinate with mine?
(Two months ago I had a dream that
my roommate brought red skull
print bedding, voodoo dolls and a
black light for our room. I woke up in
a cold sweat with an intense desire to
visit Anthropologie.)
Then in August, my friends head
ed off to various University of Cali
fornia campuses (not Cal, I promise)
and began getting the names of their
roommates. I lived vicariously
through them as we spent hours
Facebook-stalking the strangers
with whom they would soon be shar
ing rooms approximately the size of

a tissue box. Out of my 10 closest
friends, nine were lucky enough to
get fairly normal-looking room
mates (and by fairly normal-look
ing, I mean they didn't have Face
book pictures of weird shit.)
And then there was Mayra's
roommate. Within hours of finding
out Mayra's contact information, this
girl emailed a long list of "Roomie
Rules." (Rule Number One: No mi
crowaves in the room because they
emit radiation.) Even though this
chick's antics made for some pretty
amusing stories, they also worried me
like, a lot. I wondered if my own
roomie would have a bizarre list of
rules or some other freaky habit. It
also didn't help that my older friends
(who knew of my worries) loved to
tell me roommate horror stories.
(One knew a girl whose roommate
would cut her hair and leave it in the
refrigerator.) By the time I left for
Stanford, I was torn between desper
ately wanting to find out who my
roommate was and never wanting to
meet her in case she was scary.
When the moment of truth final
ly arrived, I was stunned to find out
that my roommate is ... just like me.
From our taste in clothes, to music, to
our mutual love of high heels (to-

gether we brought close to 20 pairs),
Emily and I are pretty much the per
fect pair. Our similarities are almost
creepy we're within an inch of
each other's height, wear the same
size in both clothes and shoes and
have the same type of relationship
with our parents. Besides the fact
that she's blonde and I'm brunette,
we could be twinsies. Oh and her
dorm decor? Perfectly coordinates
with mine.
While other pairs start butting
heads, Em and I cruise happily along.
Our secret? We're nice to each other
even when we're cranky/tired/
hungover as hell. We also don't spend
every second of every day together,
which makes the time we do spend to
gether so much more fun. Oh, and we
share food. That last part is super es
sential.
