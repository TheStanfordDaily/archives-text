# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## War in pieces 
### Miles Unterreiner 
T(iis fall, I enrolled in Religious
Studies 103: Psychospiritual Di
mensions of Violence. It's a won
derful course, though the material is
dark and its implications are some
times tough to grapple with. The class
meets once a week, on Mondays at 7
p.m., to watch and discuss award-win
ning films about the traumatic effects
of war and violence on individuals, so
cieties and nations.
At the end of each film, there is al
ways an empty, aching silence. We
leave quietly, not sure what, if any
thing, to say. There is no post-class
chatter here. We then take two days to
reflect before writing a brief response
to each week's film.
It was during this period of reflec
tion that I thought about why we felt
the way we did so horrified and
shocked. I thought that shock general
ly flows from inexperience, and I
thought about what our inexperience
meant. Here assembled was a class of
exceptionally bright young minds, and
we did not know what war was. We
were shocked by the face of war be
cause we had never looked it in the
eyes.
That was a bit odd, I reflected. After
all, our nation has been at war for a
decade now. Should we not know by
now what war is?
But we don't, and it troubles me. It
signifies, I think, the emergence of a
new and disturbing paradigm in our
nation's conduct of war.
It is an escapist paradigm that al
lows us to cheer for more war without
bearing any of the cost, to call for more
killing without doing any of it, to cava
lierly send troops abroad without fear

ing that we will be some of those sent.
It is a new paradigm, very unlike the
one that animated my grandfather's
generation during the Second World
War. It allows us to watch our wars on
our TV screens from the comfort of
our easy chairs, in a twisted sort of vir
tual First Manassas. Where everyone
once chipped in a little, a few now give
their all. There is no gas tax, no fuel ra
tioning, no calls for spare scrap metal
or food for the war effort, no draft, no
GI Bill.
Most of us bear none of the costs of
war, and consequently we do not have
much reason either to end the war or
to support it. Most of us do not send
care packages to our soldiers or de
mand a cessation to war by protesting
its injustice. We do not write letters to
our representatives in Congress ask
ing them to devote money to psycho
logical counseling and body armor for
the troops or asking that they vote to
withdraw those troops now. We can af
ford to have other concerns, and hence
we do.
For the people who fight our wars,
war is everything. For the rest of us, war
is nothing. Our society once experi
enced war as a totality, each and every
individual involved somehow and in
some capacity. Today, we glimpse war
in pieces and fragments men
tioned, seen, soon forgotten. We have
outsourced our wars as effectively as
we have outsourced our jobs.
That is a shame, because only those
who have fought can truly know how
much we stand to gain by not fighting.
Last spring, I took an incredible
Ethics in Society course called Global
Justice, In one class session I remern-

ber particularly well, we were dis
cussing the ethics of armed humanitar
ian intervention in Rwanda. The con
versation was intelligent and well-rea
soned standard Stanford fare if,
also in quintessential Stanford style,
rather abstract and divorced from re
ality. Then a student in the front row
raised his hand.
He had once been en route to
Rwanda as a Marine, he said, charged
by President Clinton with stopping the
genocide there. He talked about how
the thought of having to shoot a child
soldier a very real possibility at that
time troubled him deeply, and how
that possibility eventually forced the
president to recall American troops
from the war zone before he fired a
shot. He then followed up his story
with a nuanced analysis of war crimes
law, drawn from his own experience.
It was real, direct, qualitatively dif
ferent and somehow more vivid than
what we had heard from everyone
else. His story reminded me powerful
ly just how valuable the experiences of
the soldiers among us at Stanford are.
And it reminded me that we cannot let
the deepening rift between soldier and
society grow too wide, because each
would lose an understanding of the
other vital to citizenship, to democracy
and to peace.
It's easy to let slip the dogs of war
when you're holding the leash. It's a bit
harder when you're on it.

Miles wishes we cared a little more some
times. Let him know you care at mile
