## Sobering up at the OAPE 
### 
The new Stanford University
Office of Alcohol Policy and
Education (OAPE) kicked
off the 2011-2012 academic year
with "T.G.1.F." on Friday, Sept. 30.
This event, an alcohol-free party,
was the "place to be," as it featured
a popular student DJ, free refresh
ments and distribution of Red
Zone t-shirts. It was, to quote its
Facebook page, a "damn good
time."

one of the innumerable events
that take place on campus one
glance at the Stanford Events web
page will confirm this.
But what any freshman strug
gles with most initially is finding a
sense of community, of finding
like-minded students and estab
lishing a group of friends. And so,
it is not so much the events across
campus as the social environment

The few dozen students who at
tended hopefully had a good time.
But overall, the event was not
much of a success, as other venues
like Sigma Nu and its "Disorienta
tion" extravaganza attracted
hordes of freshmen, many of
whom were unfortunately not
sober.

The office's intentions are un
doubtedly good Stanford has a
policy that does not crack down on
underage students consuming al
cohol in their rooms, and a large
number of students take advan
tage of this, sometimes irresponsi
bly. With this in mind, the OAPE
seeks to create alternative events
where students can go that do not
encourage the consumption of al
cohol beforehand.
It is true that one need not
drink before attending a frat party.
It is also true that, given their vol
ume, size and inherent character,
frat parties might not be very en
joyable to the average sober stu
dent. Contrary to the assumption
implicit in T.G.I.F, these students
are not necessarily looking for an
alcohol-free version of a frat party.
Furthermore, they may naturally
shy away from a party of any sort
that is put on by the "Office of Al
cohol Policy and Education," no
matter how much free pizza or
Jamba Juice is supplied.
Again, the efforts of the office
are certainly well intentioned. But
they lack a certain understanding
of what, say, a freshman new to the
University might gravitate toward
in the face of social pressure. Con
sider the freshman who is faced
with this conundrum: most of his
or her hallway is in the room next
door, slamming down shots to the
latest hit by LMFAO as they
pregame for a frat party. This stu
dent would rather not participate,
and as a result is faced with a limit
ed set of options. Sure he or she
could head out alone, to get some
food at The Axe and Palm, to grab
a cup of coffee at the CoHo, to any

in the dorm that can veer a student
who is on the fence away from al
cohol consumption.
These efforts are best spear
headed by dormitory staff who un
dergo extensive training in many
kinds of University policy. Howev
er, in this scenario, it is not about
learning the rules â€”it is about
finding the freshmen who choose
not to drink, and thereby perhaps
find themselves isolated, and pro
viding other things to do. We rec
ommend that the Office of Alco
hol Policy and Education down
play its role in putting on these
events and instead, creatively pur
sue more organic, dorm-centric
methods of deterring student alco
hol consumption.
