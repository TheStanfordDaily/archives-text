## SOCAL TEAMS NO MATCH CARD SMASHES USC AND UCLA 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
It's still early, but after upending
both USC and No. 3 UCLA in a
pair of dominant three-goal wins
this weekend, the No. 1 Cardinal
women's soccer team seems to be
well on its way to its third consecu
tive conference title.

Stanford (13-0-1, 5-0 Pac-12)
beat the previously undefeated
Bruins (10-1-2,3-1-1) 4-1 in surpris
ingly easy fashion, and in doing so,
put a serious damper on the title
chances of a team widely consid
ered the Cardinal's biggest Pac-12
competition in 2011. The win came
less than 48 hours after the squad
earned head coach Paul Ratcliffe
his 200th career win on Friday, rely
ing on sustained pressure to down
the Trojans 3-0.
"Paul's an awesome coach," said
junior defender Rachel Quon
when asked what Ratcliffe meant
to the team. "He knows his stuff,
and he lets us play soccer he
doesn't make us do robotic things."
Stanford needed all the strong
coaching it could get last week in a
pair of tight 1-0 wins over the Wash
ington schools. And early on
against the Trojans, it looked like
the Cardinal's scoring woes would
be sticking around, on what was
likely to be the most challenging
weekend series for the team this
season.
Controlling play from the start
of the match as it has all year, Stan
ford didn't allow a single shot from
USC until the 32nd minute while
racking up 16 first-half shots and
five corners against the Trojans.
However, the Cardinal was slowed
down by a physical USC squad and
was unable to convert early, being
stifled on all seven of its shots in the
opening 25 minutes.
With halftime approaching,
however, Stanford began to find
openings in the Trojans' aggressive
defense with the help of some sharp
crosses. Sophomore forward Syd
ney Payne finally broke through
with a header goal in the 33rd
minute off a corner kick, which had

been deflected by senior midfielder
Kristy Zurmuhlen.
"Our team really wanted to
come out early and get one early,"
Quon said. "So we thought that the
next couple [of goals] would come
soon after that."
As Stanford continued to gain
momentum, Quon proved herself
right less than nine minutes later,
ripping a long strike off the cross
bar and into the back of the net for
her first goal of the season.
The Cardinal never looked
back. Matching the Trojans' physi
cality, Stanford allowed only long
looks to USC and nearly connected
on several crosses of its own. A
breakaway tally by sophomore for
ward Natalie Griffen with 30 sec
onds remaining in the match added
an exclamation point to the Rat
cliffe's 200th win as a head coach.
But the team's work on the
weekend wasn't over yet. Ahead
was a UCLA squad that represent
ed the Cardinal's last loss in confer
ence play three years ago.
Things seemed to get off to a
nightmarish start for Stanford
when sophomore goalkeeper
Emily Oliver had to fend off a
close-range shot just 30 seconds
into the match. Yet despite her
heroic save, the Cardinal struggled
early to maintain possession, mak
ing several poor decisions and fail
ing to put any pressure on freshman
goalie Katelyn Rowland.
"It was a shock to our system,
because USC dropped off and we
had all day with the ball," Ratcliffe
said. "Today, [the Bruins] were
high-pressuring, and it took us 15
minutes to figure it out, to get the
speed of play right."
Even when Stanford did get
things right, it wasn't expected to
score often against a UCLA squad
that, despite having a dozen true
freshmen, had played stifling de
fense and allowed just four goals on
the year.
Yet in a shocking rout of one of
the nation's best teams, the Cardi
nal would double that total in the
first half alone.
Collecting a loose ball in the box
off a corner kick, freshman forward
Chioma Übogagu put one home to
get Stanford on the board after
only seven minutes of play. Ten
minutes later, senior midfielder
Teresa Noyola got control of the
ball near the top of the penalty area
with some nifty moves and fed
Übogagu, who dribbled in between
two Bruin defenders for another
close-range goal, her sixth of the

season.
But of all the streaks the Cardi
nal was able to extend on Sunday
25 straight conference wins, 43
consecutive home victories and 57
regular-season matches in a row
without a loss one did come to
an end at the hands of the Bruins.
Just 28 seconds after Übogagu's
second tally, junior midfielder Za
kiya Bywaters found herself alone
in the Stanford box and drilled one
low past the outstretched arms of
Oliver to get UCLA on the board.
It was the first goal that Stanford
had allowed in 685 minutes and 25
seconds, just 90 minutes away from
the school record set in 2002-03
and it wouldn't be the last chance
that the Bruins would have to
score. Taking risks on a consistent
basis throughout the game, the
UCLA forwards would have sever
al dynamite opportunities.
What the Bruins had in firepow
er, however, they lacked on their
back end, a fact that the Cardinal
would quickly take advantage of. In
the 28th minute, senior midfielder
Lindsay Taylor took a Noyola pass
and showed the sellout crowd why
she leads Stanford in scoring, net
ting her ninth goal of the year with
a perfect, off-foot lob that found
the net at the far post. And just 12
minutes later, senior midfielder
Kristy Zurmuhlen added her third
tally of the year on a wide-open
shot near the goalmouth, thanks to
a perfect feed from junior forward
Marjani Hing-Glover.
Though the Cardinal wouldn't
get on the board again, it held the
Bruins scoreless in the second half,
content with a weekend sweep and
one of the squad's most impressive
offensive explosions of the season.
To Noyola, the win showed that
Stanford has learned how to deci

sively beat a strong opponent; the
squad has fallen just short in two
straight NCAA Finals matches.
"They came out strong, and I
think we were a little shaky," she
said. "I don't think our back line
had been tested like that yet, and I
think it's good for us in the long
run. I think it shows that we can
withstand the pressure, and it
shows us also that we need to come
out a little bit more alert in the be
ginning."
Regardless of the big win, things
weren't all positive for the Stanford
coach.
"I think we've got to continue to
be composed on the ball and be
careful that we don't turn games
into track meets," Ratcliffe said
after the UCLA game. "I think
today, it got into a back-and-forth
game, and that's when we get
stretched a little bit. I want us to
keep possession and play smart."
Stanford will take on Arizona
State on the road next weekend,
before it plays new conference ad
ditions Utah and Colorado in late
October.

tallies of the season. Stanford cruised to a 4-1 victory two days after
defeating USC 3-0 for head coach Paul Ratcliffe's 200th career victory.
It's still early, but after upending
both USC and No. 3 UCLA in a
pair of dominant three-goal wins
this weekend, the No. 1 Cardinal
women's soccer team seems to be
well on its way to its third consecu
tive conference title.

Stanford (13-0-1, 5-0 Pac-12)
beat the previously undefeated
Bruins (10-1-2,3-1-1) 4-1 in surpris
ingly easy fashion, and in doing so,
put a serious damper on the title
chances of a team widely consid
ered the Cardinal's biggest Pac-12
competition in 2011. The win came
less than 48 hours after the squad
earned head coach Paul Ratcliffe
his 200th career win on Friday, rely
ing on sustained pressure to down
the Trojans 3-0.
"Paul's an awesome coach," said
junior defender Rachel Quon
when asked what Ratcliffe meant
to the team. "He knows his stuff,
and he lets us play soccer he
doesn't make us do robotic things."
Stanford needed all the strong
coaching it could get last week in a
pair of tight 1-0 wins over the Wash
ington schools. And early on
against the Trojans, it looked like
the Cardinal's scoring woes would
be sticking around, on what was
likely to be the most challenging
weekend series for the team this
season.
Controlling play from the start
of the match as it has all year, Stan
ford didn't allow a single shot from
USC until the 32nd minute while
racking up 16 first-half shots and
five corners against the Trojans.
However, the Cardinal was slowed
down by a physical USC squad and
was unable to convert early, being
stifled on all seven of its shots in the
opening 25 minutes.
With halftime approaching,
however, Stanford began to find
openings in the Trojans' aggressive
defense with the help of some sharp
crosses. Sophomore forward Syd
ney Payne finally broke through
with a header goal in the 33rd
minute off a corner kick, which had

been deflected by senior midfielder
Kristy Zurmuhlen.
"Our team really wanted to
come out early and get one early,"
Quon said. "So we thought that the
next couple [of goals] would come
soon after that."
As Stanford continued to gain
momentum, Quon proved herself
right less than nine minutes later,
ripping a long strike off the cross
bar and into the back of the net for
her first goal of the season.
The Cardinal never looked
back. Matching the Trojans' physi
cality, Stanford allowed only long
looks to USC and nearly connected
on several crosses of its own. A
breakaway tally by sophomore for
ward Natalie Griffen with 30 sec
onds remaining in the match added
an exclamation point to the Rat
cliffe's 200th win as a head coach.
But the team's work on the
weekend wasn't over yet. Ahead
was a UCLA squad that represent
ed the Cardinal's last loss in confer
ence play three years ago.
Things seemed to get off to a
nightmarish start for Stanford
when sophomore goalkeeper
Emily Oliver had to fend off a
close-range shot just 30 seconds
into the match. Yet despite her
heroic save, the Cardinal struggled
early to maintain possession, mak
ing several poor decisions and fail
ing to put any pressure on freshman
goalie Katelyn Rowland.
"It was a shock to our system,
because USC dropped off and we
had all day with the ball," Ratcliffe
said. "Today, [the Bruins] were
high-pressuring, and it took us 15
minutes to figure it out, to get the
speed of play right."
Even when Stanford did get
things right, it wasn't expected to
score often against a UCLA squad
that, despite having a dozen true
freshmen, had played stifling de
fense and allowed just four goals on
the year.
Yet in a shocking rout of one of
the nation's best teams, the Cardi
nal would double that total in the
first half alone.
Collecting a loose ball in the box
off a corner kick, freshman forward
Chioma Übogagu put one home to
get Stanford on the board after
only seven minutes of play. Ten
minutes later, senior midfielder
Teresa Noyola got control of the
ball near the top of the penalty area
with some nifty moves and fed
Übogagu, who dribbled in between
two Bruin defenders for another
close-range goal, her sixth of the

season.
But of all the streaks the Cardi
nal was able to extend on Sunday
25 straight conference wins, 43
consecutive home victories and 57
regular-season matches in a row
without a loss one did come to
an end at the hands of the Bruins.
Just 28 seconds after Übogagu's
second tally, junior midfielder Za
kiya Bywaters found herself alone
in the Stanford box and drilled one
low past the outstretched arms of
Oliver to get UCLA on the board.
It was the first goal that Stanford
had allowed in 685 minutes and 25
seconds, just 90 minutes away from
the school record set in 2002-03
and it wouldn't be the last chance
that the Bruins would have to
score. Taking risks on a consistent
basis throughout the game, the
UCLA forwards would have sever
al dynamite opportunities.
What the Bruins had in firepow
er, however, they lacked on their
back end, a fact that the Cardinal
would quickly take advantage of. In
the 28th minute, senior midfielder
Lindsay Taylor took a Noyola pass
and showed the sellout crowd why
she leads Stanford in scoring, net
ting her ninth goal of the year with
a perfect, off-foot lob that found
the net at the far post. And just 12
minutes later, senior midfielder
Kristy Zurmuhlen added her third
tally of the year on a wide-open
shot near the goalmouth, thanks to
a perfect feed from junior forward
Marjani Hing-Glover.
Though the Cardinal wouldn't
get on the board again, it held the
Bruins scoreless in the second half,
content with a weekend sweep and
one of the squad's most impressive
offensive explosions of the season.
To Noyola, the win showed that
Stanford has learned how to deci

sively beat a strong opponent; the
squad has fallen just short in two
straight NCAA Finals matches.
"They came out strong, and I
think we were a little shaky," she
said. "I don't think our back line
had been tested like that yet, and I
think it's good for us in the long
run. I think it shows that we can
withstand the pressure, and it
shows us also that we need to come
out a little bit more alert in the be
ginning."
Regardless of the big win, things
weren't all positive for the Stanford
coach.
"I think we've got to continue to
be composed on the ball and be
careful that we don't turn games
into track meets," Ratcliffe said
after the UCLA game. "I think
today, it got into a back-and-forth
game, and that's when we get
stretched a little bit. I want us to
keep possession and play smart."
Stanford will take on Arizona
State on the road next weekend,
before it plays new conference ad
ditions Utah and Colorado in late
October.
