# CARD WINS NAIL-BITERS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ 
The top-ranked Stanford men's
water polo team won its first two
games of the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) regular
season this weekend, the second in
a battle that went down to the final
seconds. Both games featured
strong defensive efforts, and the
Cardinal showed why it is going to
be a factor at the top of the league
this year, beating No. 8 Pepperdine
9-5 and No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara 6-
5 Sunday afternoon.
Up until the final two minutes
of Sunday's matinee game, it
looked like UCSB was going to
pull off an upset in these two
teams' first meeting of the season.
The Gouchos came out confidently
and took an early 2-1 lead, while
Stanford had trouble putting shots
on goal all day long.

A big steal in the first quarter by
senior utility Peter Sefton set up a
breakaway goal by junior driver
Alex Avery, but that was just about
all of the offense Stanford could
muster in the first half. A UCSB
goal in the final seconds of the first
quarter and then another in the
second quarter gave them a 4-2
halftime lead.
In the second half Stanford
locked down on defense, but still
struggled to get anything going at
the offensive end. This is nothing
new for the team, though. Head
coach John Vargas has preached all
year that "we cannot always count
on our offense, but defense can al

ways be consistent." That consis
tent defense kept Stanford in the
game long enough to tie it at four
goals a piece in the third quarter
after goals by senior driver Jacob
Smith and junior two-meter For
rest Watkins.
A power-play goal by the Gau
chos gave them another lead with
2:03 remaining, but that would be
their only goal of the half.
TTie Cardinal drew two ejec
tions of its own in the final 1:35
minutes of the game, which set up
both fourth quarter goals. Fresh
man utility Alex Bowen added to
his growing resume with a pair of
clutch goals, including a mid-range
strike with 1:28 left in the game, his
second of the day. After a timeout
with 19 seconds on the clock, Stan
ford set up its power play offense
and Smith netted the winner with
four seconds left on the clock.

Going forward in the MPSF
season, the Cardinal men know
that even though they are No. 1 in
the polls, there is a lot of work to be
done.
"We can't get complacent be
cause all of our wins have been
very close," said junior driver Paul
Rudolph. Four of the team's past
five wins have come by either one
or two goals.
Stanford had a much more com
fortable win against Pepperdine
earlier in the weekend. The Cardi
nal came out strong against Pep
perdine in its home opener, taking
a 3-f advantage after the first quar
ter and a 6-1 lead into the half. Red
shirt senior goalie Brian Pingree
led a stifling defense with some big
saves in the first half, and driver
Ryan Kent, another fifth-year sen
