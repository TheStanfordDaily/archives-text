# Luck outplays stats

### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Another game, another
rout for Stanford foot
ball. Here's Stat on the
Back's take on this
week's numbers.

Number of the game: 12
What it means: If you're going to
learn the uniform number of one Stan
ford athlete, make it Stanford football's
No. 12. A guy you might have heard of
named Andrew Luck tends to sport
that number, and he tends to do so

Colorado was just the latest example of
what No. 12 can do.

very well as a team on Saturday. The
defense was as good as it's been all

best games of his exceptional Stanford
career. He completed 79 percent of his
passes for 370 yards and three touch
downs with just one interception.
However, contrary to most of this
column, numbers can't completely

the year, both on passes off the hands of
Owusu), this play also took a comple
