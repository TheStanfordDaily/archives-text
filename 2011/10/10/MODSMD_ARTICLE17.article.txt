# Luck outplays stats
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Another game, another
rout for Stanford foot
ball. Here's Stat on the
Back's take on this
week's numbers.

Number of the game: 12
What it means: If you're going to
learn the uniform number of one Stan
ford athlete, make it Stanford football's
No. 12. A guy you might have heard of
named Andrew Luck tends to sport
that number, and he tends to do so
pretty well. Saturday's 48-7 win against
Colorado was just the latest example of
what No. 12 can do.

Why it matters: Stanford played
very well as a team on Saturday. The
defense was as good as it's been all
year, the running game was strong late
and the Cardinal had a big score on
special teams early. But this game was
all about No. 12. Luck had one of the
best games of his exceptional Stanford
career. He completed 79 percent of his
passes for 370 yards and three touch
downs with just one interception.
However, contrary to most of this
column, numbers can't completely
capture how good Luck was. The fact
that he gets credit for an interception is
a perfect example of how statistics can
be misleading. That pass was as perfect
as his touchdown throws, but Chris
Owusu momentarily forgot how to
catch the ball, popping it up in the air di
rectly to Colorado defensive back Ter
rel Smith. Besides giving Luck an un
deserved interception (his second of
the year, both on passes off the hands of
Owusu), this play also took a comple
tion and yards away from Luck and

erased a good scoring opportunity for
the Cardinal.

But enough of the bad. There was
so much more that went well for Stan
ford's all-time winningest quarterback.
Yep, the win was Luck's 25th as a start
ing quarterback, passing Steve Sten
strom for the most in Stanford history.
If you want a sense of how good
Luck was, just take a look at whom he
threw the ball to. Once again the tight
ends made an impact, as the three fu
ture NFL stars were among the top
four receivers on the day, totaling eight

catches for 156 yards. However, they
were only three of the 11 players who
caught a pass. Possession receiver Griff
Whalen came into the game with 101
receiving yards and no touchdowns on
the season, and he promptly caught
four balls for 92 yards and his second
career touchdown. Fullback Ryan He
witt had two touchdown catches, more
than Owen Marecic had in his entire
Stanford career. Little-used Corey
Gatewood caught his first pass since
2007. Luck even completed passes to
three different running backs.
It wasn't just about the breadth of
Stanford's weapons. Luck made all the
throws: standing in the pocket, on the
run, across his body, deep, short, over the
middle and to the sidelines. He can real
ly do it all. Oh, and by the way, he called

his own plays, bludgeoning an out
matched Colorado defense into sub
mission. The Buffaloes had no answer
for him, and I don't think there is one.
Other notable numbers:

3-for-9,18: These are the passing
numbers for Colorado in the second
half Though Stanford's pass defense
looked vulnerable in the first half the
Cardinal clamped down after the
break. Colorado quarterback Tyler
Hansen went 13-for-21 for 186 yards
and a touchdown in the first half but he
had no answer to the Stanford defense
after that. The Buffaloes could only
manage 18 passing yards in the second
half and Hansen ended the Cardinal
interception drought by lofting a ball
directly into the hands of Stanford
safety Michael Thomas. That gift
helped the Cardinal pitch another sec
ond-half shutout.

2.2: Colorado's poor rushing of
fense and Stanford's stout rushing de
fense converged to perfection as the
Buffaloes managed a measly 2.2 yards
per carry on their way to just 60 rushing
yards. And that's including a 25-yard
scramble by Hansen and several
garbage-time runs by backups in the
fourth quarter. After a subpar week,
the Stanford run defense was back to
its old self) moving back up to second in
the country.

5,65: One negative from the game
(and there weren't many in a 41-point
win) was penalties. The Cardinal came
in among the top third in the country in
fewest penalties and penalty yards, but
a few silly late hits put Stanford in
tough situations. Five penalties for 65
yards were not costly in an easy victory
like this, but in a close game they could
become the difference.

50,360: For the second consecu
tive week, the listed attendance was
50,360. In other words, a sellout. Al
though there were definitely fewer
people in the stands for the Colorado
game than last week's against
UCLA, the fact that these games are
even close to sellouts is a sign of
maj or progress. One of the big knocks
on Stanford last year was that even
with such a successful team, fan sup
port was shockingly low. Well, it ap
pears fans have finally realized what
an exciting and potentially great team
Stanford is trotting out on a weekly
basis. Student tickets are running out
within hours, and you can't spot too
many empty seats (at least until Stan
ford is up by 41 in the fourth quarter).
Oh, and Tiger Woods and John El way
stopped by as well. With the best
games of the year (Oregon, Cal and
Notre Dame) still upcoming, the best
could be yet to come from the Stan

ford faithful.
13: Stanford has extended its win
streak to 13 games, the longest active
streak in the country. It also ties the
school record, set from 1939-41.
With all these wins, many people
are starting to think about national title
chances. However, this year features a
large number of teams with chances to
go undefeated. LSU, Alabama, Okla
homa and Wisconsin are all ranked
above Stanford in both major polls,
and their strengths of schedule figure
to be better than the Cardinal's as well.
So is Stanford sure to be left out of the
national title race?

Consider this: after seven weeks,
there are currently 13 undefeated
teams in college football, and all are
ranked in the top 25. Last year, after
seven weeks there were 13 undefeated
teams in college football, and all were
ranked in the top 25. By the end of the
year, the title game of Auburn vs. Ore
gon was obvious, and TCU was the
only other unbeaten team.
Needless to say, there 's a lot of col
lege football left to be played.
