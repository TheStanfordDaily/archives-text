## Study identifies impact of diet on birth defects 
### ERIN INMAN 
A recent study out of the School of Medicine
found that the overall quality of diet during pregnan
cy is associated with the risk of two birth defects: neu
ral tube defects (NTDs) and orofacial clefts.
This study, published online last week in the jour
nal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine,
marks a shift in the focus of research on birth defects
from single nutrients such as folic acid to over
all quality of diet during pregnancy.
