## Study identifies impact of diet on birth defects 
### ERIN INMAN 
A recent study out of the School of Medicine
found that the overall quality of diet during pregnan
cy is associated with the risk of two birth defects: neu
ral tube defects (NTDs) and orofacial clefts.
This study, published online last week in the jour
nal Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine,
marks a shift in the focus of research on birth defects
from single nutrients such as folic acid to over
all quality of diet during pregnancy.

"We know that folic acid can
prevent neural tube defects, and
that has been a huge public health
story," said primary author and as
sociate professor of pediatrics
Suzan Carmichael. "But there are
still babies born with neural tube
defects. Folic acid is not the com
plete answer."

Taking a more holistic approach,
the group turned its attention to
diet.
"We eat foods, not single nutri
ents," Carmichael said. "Knowing
that complexity, we took an ap
proach to incorporate that."
The researchers used the Na
tional Birth Defect Prevention
Study database collected by the
U.S. Center for Disease Control and
Prevention to find its sample popu
lation. The database collects infor
mation on children born with over
30 different birth defects.

Mothers were then surveyed ret
rospectively on their eating habits
both preceding and during preg
nancy. Diet quality was assessed by
two standards: the Diet Quality
Index (DQI) adjusted for pregnan
cy and a Mediterranean Diet Score.
Both favor high intake of fruits and
vegetables and low intake of satu
rated fats.
According to the study, in
creased diet quality by either meas
ure was correlated with reduced
risk for either type of defect. The
strongest association was between

DQI scores and anencephaly, a neu
ral tube defect that results in chil
dren born without a forebrain. As
sociations were also found for spina
bifida a condition in which the
embryonic neural tube is exposed
cleft lips and cleft palates.
Though the study promotes ex
panding beyond a single nutrient
approach, Carmichael was quick to
say that this is not an either-or mat
ter.
"It's still important to take a folic
acid supplement," she said. "But
this helps us remember that quality

of diet also matters; it's important
regardless of the supplement."
Funding came from the Center
for Disease Control and National
Institutes of Health. Professor of
pediatrics Gary Shaw was the
paper's senior author and postdoc
toral scholar Wei Yang analyzed the
data.
The group now hopes to analyze
the data for correlations with other
birth defects.
