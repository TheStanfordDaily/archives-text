# Endowment grows
## University reports 22.4-percent growth, improvement over 2009-10 
### JOSH HOYT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Management Company
(SMC) reported a 22.4-percent return on
the Stanford endowment for the fiscal
year that ended Jun. 30,2011, up from the
14.4-percent return recorded for the pre
vious fiscal year.

SMC is a division of the University re
sponsible for investing the Merged Pool
(MP), a pool of money including the en
dowment as well as other monies suitable
for long-term investment for example,
the savings of the Stanford Hospital &
Clinics and Lucille Packard Children's
Hospital.

"The merged pool includes endow
ment assets and then some additional as
sets that the various schools and endow
ments have chosen to treat like endow
ment assets, but are not, legally speaking,
endowment," SMC CEO John Powers
wrote in an email to The Daily. "That's
why this merged pool number is $19.5 bil
lion, and the endowment is about $16.5."

This return comes after Stanford's
record losses in fiscal year 2008-09, when
the investments lost 25.9 percent of its
value in that year's economic downturn.
After two years of growth, the perform
ance over the past three years shows
growth of only 1.3 percent; the $19.5 bil
lion total of the MP today remains less
than the $20.6 billion value reported Jun.
30,2008.

Expanding over 10 years, Stanford has
achieved 9.3 percent MP growth, starting

from $7.9 billion in 1999.This growth is in
line with what Stanford expects in the
long-term, Powers said.

"Our long-term goal is to allow for
about a 5.5 percent yearly payout, and
then there is inflation above 5.5 percent;
and then we want to grow the endowment
some," he continued. "So, a minimum
threshold to allow us to make payout and
meet inflation and grow the endowment
is at eight percent or so."

Other universities have shown compa
rable endowment volatility. This year's in
vestment return of 22.4 percent is more
than the any of the schools with larger en
dowments, including Harvard's 21.4 per
cent, Princeton's 21.9 percent and Yale's
21.9 percent. Stanford's 2008-09 loss was
shared by all of these institutions as well,
with Stanford losing less than Harvard's
27.3 percent but more than Yale's 24.6
and Princeton's 23.7.

Overall, Stanford's 10-year gains are
the lowest of the group, with Harvard at
9.4 percent, Yale at 9.8 and Princeton at 10.
"It's like a poker game with friends,"
Powers said of the investing relationship
between the universities. "You want to
win the hand, but you enjoy the company
as well."

Education professor David Plank,
who researches education policy, es
chewed the idea of endowments as a
competition to see "who has the biggest
pile."

"The broader context is that these are
great problems to have," Plank said. "Most
students are going to universities and col

leges without any endowment at all."
Powers, who took over the CEO posi
tion at SMC in 2006, cited SMC's ability
to grow the endowment, even in a
decade with several years of losses. In
the fiscal year 2000-01 Stanford reported
a 2.1-percent loss and in 2001-02, a 2.6-
percent loss.
One way SMC said it is planning for
the future is by focusing on the liquidity
of its assets. Hundreds of staff lost their
jobs during the 2008-09 crisis, and funding
was pulled back in departments across

Stanford. This was necessary be
cause, while the endowment can be
invested as a large pool of money, it
cannot be spent as such, Powers
said.

"One of the things that worried
us the most at the bottom was just
having enough liquid assets to
meet our various liabilities," Pow
ers said. "Our liabilities are our
payment obligations that we have
to the operating University, as well
as a commitment that we have to a
variety of investment funds to pro

vide them capital for investment
activities on our behalf over time."
Looking forward, Powers is
cautious.
"I'd like to think that the huge
volatility of the early part of the
decade and the latter part of the
decade was abnormal," Powers
wrote in a follow-up email to The
Daily. "But given how much we see
the market moving around these
days and how interconnected and
dynamic the global economy is ...
it is better to plan for volatility and
be surprised by the lack thereof
than plan for smooth sailing and be
surprised by storms."
