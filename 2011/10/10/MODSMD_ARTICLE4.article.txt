## Brown signs second part of DREAM Act

signed on Saturday the second half of
a bill dubbed the DREAM Act,

"Citizens are having a hard

need now," wrote California Assem
blyman Tim Donnelly, a Hesperia
Republican, in a Sept. 9 letter to
Brown. "[California already offers]
students in the country illegally in
