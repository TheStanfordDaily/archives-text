## Brown signs second part of DREAM Act 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
California Governor Jerry Brown
signed on Saturday the second half of
a bill dubbed the DREAM Act,
which will allow illegal immigrant col
lege students to receive state-funded
scholarships.
The bill, written by Los Angeles
Democrat and State Senator Gil
Cedillo, completes the California
DREAM Act and follows one signed
by Brown in July to fulfill a campaign
promise to give illegal immigrants ac
cess to privately-funded college
scholarships. A similar bill for federal
aid was voted down in the U.S. Senate
last year.
"Going to college is a dream that
promises intellectual excitement and
creative thinking," Brown said in a
statement issued by his office."The
DREAM Act benefits us all by giving
top students a chance to improve
their lives and the lives of all of us."
California joins Texas and New
Mexico as one of three states to qual
ify illegal immigrants for college fi
nancial aid.The DREAM Act passed
a Democratic legislature along party
lines in September.
The state is also one of about a
dozen to allow illegal immigrants to
pay in-state tuition at public schools,
given the students' attendance and
graduation from a California public
high school. The new law makes these
students eligible for aid at the Univer
sity of California schools, California
State Universities and 112 communi
ty colleges.
Opponents of the bill have stated
that California's funds should be re
served for those who are legally in the
state.
"Citizens are having a hard
enough time getting the classes they
need now," wrote California Assem
blyman Tim Donnelly, a Hesperia
Republican, in a Sept. 9 letter to
Brown. "[California already offers]
students in the country illegally in
state tuition; legally documented stu-
dents from the next state over can
only dream of such a benefit."
For the University of California's
2007-08 academic year, it reported
less than 0.3 percent of students as
immigrants, and more than 68 per
cent of these 1,941 students as citizens
or documented immigrants.
The new law will affect less than
one percent of students at state uni
versities about 3,633 and
34,057 of 2.9 million students en
rolled at community colleges.
