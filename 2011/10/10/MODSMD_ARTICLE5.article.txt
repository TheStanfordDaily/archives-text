# BUFF HUNTIN'
## DEFENSE CLAMPS DOWN IN SECOND HALF 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
"I think we need to improve.
We left some plays out there.
Some turnovers, some three-and
outs; it's just not good enough," he
said, wiping his left hand down
across his face.
Judging by his reactions, you
would have expected him to need
some consoling. After all, Luck
had just accumulated 370 yards
through the air, the second-most
in a single game in his career,

picked up his 25th career victory
to pass Steve Stenstrom for the
most all-time wins by a quarter
back in Stanford history and
steered the Cardinal football
team to a 48-7 victory over Col
orado.

Just another masterpiece,
right?

"Am I ever surprised by what

Andrew Luck looked weary,
red-faced, beard unkempt and

MICHAEL LIU/The Stanford Daily
Andrew Luck (No. 12) fires off a pass during the Cardinal's 48-7 victory over Colorado. Luck threw for 370
yards with three touchdowns and one interception as he picked up his school-record 25th career victory.
he does? I mean ... sometimes,"
wide receiver Griff Whalen said
after the game. "He makes some
pretty unbelievable plays, but at this
point we kind of know he can do
that."
Their coach was a little bit more
effusive, though.
"I thought he was outstanding. He
was phenomenal. There were two
catchable balls that were incomple
tions one was an interception
but besides that, he was pretty close
to flawless," head coach David Shaw
said. "Every game he does something
that not many human beings can do."
Luck's 26-of-33, 370-yard, three
touchdown, one-interception per
formance was the highlight of a game
that saw the No. 7 Cardinal (5-0,3-0
Pac-12) breeze past the Buffaloes (1-
5,0-2) to extend the nation's longest
winning streak to 13 games and give
Stanford its first 5-0 start since 1951
but the redshirt junior quarter
back didn't do it all by himself, of
course.
Luck ran onto the field with 9:22
remaining in the first quarter with a
7-0 lead thanks to the first special
teams touchdown of the year a
blocked field goal returned for a
touchdown.
After senior running back Jeremy
Stewart fumbled the opening kickoff
of the game, Colorado took the ball
all the way down to the Cardinal's 12-
yard line before stalling out and
being forced to kick a field goal.
But when the ball was snapped,
the center and guard split, leaving
redshirt senior linebacker Max
Bergen unimpeded to the backfield,
where he blocked the kick, picked up
the ball and dashed 75 yards for a
touchdown.
"The defense saved our cans
early on, thanks to a great play by
Max Bergen and a great call by [spe
cial teams coordinator] Brian Po
lian," Shaw said. "Max did a great
job getting all three: the block, the
recovery and the touchdown."
From there on out, it was the An
drew Luck show once again, apart
from one tight moment in the sec
ond quarter.
After Colorado capitalized on a
76-yard screen pass to running back
Rodney Stewart that led to a touch
down, Luck threw just his second in
terception of the year on the ensu
ing drive, a pass that bounced off the
hands of wide receiver Chris Owusu

and into the hands of Terrel Smith,
leaving the Buffaloes down just 13-7
and in possession of the football.
"It hit Chris' hands, and Chris will
tell you he's disappointed by it,"
Luck said. "[The] ball bounced up in
the air, and [the defensive back]
made a nice catch."
The Cardinal defense stiffened
and forced a punt, though, sacking
quarterback Tyler Hansen, one of
three Stanford sacks on the day, to

give the ball back to Luck, who more
than made up for the blemish.
After the interception, Luck led
the offense to touchdowns on its
next five possessions, engineering
three drives of more than 70 yards
that included a 14-play, 84-yard
drive that made the score 41-7 with
8:44 seconds left in the third quarter.
Despite the large margin of vic
tory and good defensive perform
ance (the Cardinal only allowed 60

yards rushing), Shaw was still tough
on his team's overall performance.

"It was a tale of two halves. I
thought we played okay in the first
half... and offensively we found
our rhythm eventually, but we
talked about starting fast, and we
did not," he said. "We can't let the
scoreboard dictate our feeling about
how we played. If we can play better,
then we should know it, and we
should play better."
Luck, despite his outstanding sta
tistical performance, was also unsat
isfied, particularly with several
penalties that hampered the Cardi
nal offense for the second week in a
row.
"It's all our fault; there's
nowhere else to point the finger ex
cept at ourselves," he said. "It's
boneheaded by our team; luckily we
were able to bounce out of that hole
today. You can't win consistently
playing like that."
Shaw also said he specifically
tried to keep his team in a competi
tive frame of mind by converting on
two fourth downs when the score
was well out of hand, as he boiled
the Cardinal's present and future
success down to just one word.
"Attitude. If it's close, with the
line that we have, with the fullbacks
that we have, with the tight ends we
have, with the backs that we have,
we should pick up anything that's
less than 4th and three. We should
pick it up," he said. "We don't bat an
eyelash, we don't think about it, we
don't even talk about it on the head

set. We just get the next call ready.
That's the kind of mentality we need
to have up front in order for us to
play the games the way we want to
play them."
The Cardinal will put its win
streak on the line once again this
weekend when it travels away from
the Farm to take on Washington
State in Pullman, Wash, on Saturday.
