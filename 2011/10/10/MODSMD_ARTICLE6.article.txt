## ACM hosts Hulu talk on "big data" 
### ELLORA ISRANI DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) host
ed its weekly Tech Talk last Friday
night in the Gates Computer Science
Building, featuring Shane Moriah
'O9, a Flulu software developer who
gave a talk titled, "I Know What You
Watched Last Summer: An
Overview of Hadoop, Big Data and
Metrics at Hulu."
ACM's weekly Tech Talks feature
two students, faculty or community
members giving talks about various
computer science-related topics. The
group's website deems the idea "sim
ple smart people sharing their
cool CS hacks, research and tech
demos with the Stanford CS commu
nity." This week's second speaker
was Sam King 'l2 on "Computers,
Exploitation and Empowerment."
Moriah spoke on the relevance to
data in almost every industry.
"Metrics are the core of data
driven business," he said. "Pretty
much every business now every
tech business, every non-tech busi
ness is interested in metrics."
"You can understand your users
and usage, develop and track new ex
isting products and, of course,
there's money," he continued. "We
make most of our money off of ad
vertisements, so being able to track
what advertisements are shown and
when that's how we make our
money."

According to Moriah, data is used
to track a variety of factors across the
Hulu site: views per video, number of
advertisements shown, quality of
service, as well as "individual viewer
data," or how people behave across
the lifetime of their visit to the site.
He also described how the com
pany collects data through "bea
cons" on web pages designed to
track usage.
"What you do [when you watch a
video] is send this URL off," he said.
"This is basically what happens when
you load an advertisement... it gets
sent back to us and processed."
The company records the time, IP
address, advertisement info, user lo
cation and user ID for registered
viewers using a URL-parsing key; it
processes about one billion of these
"beacons" per day, which Moriah
called an "issue of scale."
Data is also used to balance con
tent and user interface, as well as to
drive some larger company deci
sions such as "negative results" com
municating unsuccessful initiatives.
"When we launch things, there is a
tendency to do product design by
gut, Steve Jobs' philosophy," he said.
"That sometimes works ... Some
times you see that your big dream
projects should actually get axed."

He also revealed that Hulu is "in
the slow process of a site-redesign,
which is perhaps a secret."
The Stanford ACM, which
Hackathon coordinator Alex Atal
lah 'l4 calls a "computer enthusi
ast" group, is a chapter of the na
tionwide scientific and educational
computing society. The Stanford
chapter was founded in 2007 and
has approximately 400 members;
nationwide, membership was about

83,000 as of 2007.
The group reaches out to compa
nies and students, inviting them to
speak about whatever CS-related
subject interests them. According to
Atallah, the talks' audiences are fair
ly consistent.
"The vast majority are Stanford
people, Stanford undergrads," he
said. "It's maybe five percent from
outside of Stanford and 90 percent
undergrads. The people who come

from outside of Stanford, some of
them are entrepreneurs ... Others
are just tech enthusiasts. They're re
ally excited about it."
He also said that attendees tend to
be CS majors, although some are
symbolic systems majors or those in
terested in "general entrepreneur
ship."
As for ACM, Atallah described
the group's mission as built around a
triad.

"ACM is the biggest computing
enthusiast group on Stanford cam
pus, and we try to get people togeth
er, some of whom are not sure how
to start an idea that they have, and
some of them have the technical
background, but want inspiration,"
he said. "We try to get these people
to create at hackathons, to listen at
Tech Talks and to learn at work
shops."

ACM's next Tech Talk is Friday,
Oct. 21 at 6 p.m. and will feature Ali
Yahya 'lO on "Software Defined Net
working."
