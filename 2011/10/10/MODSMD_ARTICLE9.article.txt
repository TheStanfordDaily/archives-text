# Researchers achieve cell transformation

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
Scientists in the School of Medi
cine transformed mature liver cells
from mice into functional neurons
with the introduction of three new
genes, marking the first time re

searchers anywhere have been able
to "leapfrog from one fundamentally
different tissue type to another ," ac
cording to a School of Medicine state
ment.

This same group of researchers,
led by assistant professor of patholo
gy and senior author Marius Wernig,
showed in 2009 that it was possible to
transform mice skin cells into neu
rons. The difference is that this new
transformation occurs without first
having to make the cells "pluripo
tent" that is, without first inducing
the potential to differentiate via the
forced expression of certain genes.
Previously, this was thought to be a
necessary step.

"These liver cells unambiguously
cross tissue-type boundaries to be
come fully functional neural cells,"
Wernig said in a statment. "Even
more surprising, these cells also si
multaneously silence their liver-gene
expression profile. They are not hy
brids; they are completely switching
their identities."
Researchers transformed the
liver cells, known as hepatocytes, by
inserting via a virus three genes:
Brn2, Ascll and Mytll. Within two
weeks, cells began to take on neural
identities and suppress previous
characteristics.

Wernig, along with postdoctoral
scholar and first author Samuele
Marro, built on a technique devel
oped by professor of applied physics
Stephen Quake. They analyzed the
original and transformed liver cells
to show that their product behaves
like a true neuron and shuts down all
gene expression associated with its
previous function.
There is future potential for re
search on the application of these
cells for example, in whether they
can be used to learn more about dis
ease or in treatment. According to
the press release, these cells could
also help illuminate the process of
cell differentiation.

"This is fascinating," Wernig said.
"We can imagine ways that the three
introduced factors could stimulate
neural gene expression, but how do
they also down-regulate two com
pletely unrelated donor networks
those of skin and liver cells?"

The research was funded jointly
by the New York Stern Cell Founda
tion, the Stinehart/Reed Foundation,
the Ellison Medical Foundation, the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute
and the National Institutes of
Health.
