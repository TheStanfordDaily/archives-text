# New technique explores role of RNA
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF — Ivy Nguyen Margaret Rawson 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine made a new technique to
precisely identify DNA sequences
and locations bound by regulatory

ribonucleic acids (RNAs), according
to a School of Medicine statement.
With this new information, re
searchers in these fields will now be
able to understand how RNA regu
lates the expression of genes.
Earlier techniques only allowed
researchers to guess the activity of
the RNA based on clues from the
surrounding biological system, ac
cording to dermatology professor
and researcher Howard Chang. This
new technique, however, allows sci
entists to identify exactly where on
the chromatin the RNAs are bind
ing. The results, Chang said in the
study, indicate that the regulatory
RNA is "focal, numerous and site
specific."

Messenger RNA, which tran
scribes genetic instructions encoded
in DNA and facilitates protein
building using that information, was
identified 50 years ago. In the years
since, the one-directional flow of in
formation from DNA to RNA to
protein became central to biology
curricula. Regulatory RNA, howev
er, contradicts that simplified picture
because it binds to DNA and affects
which genes are selected to become

proteins.
Studying the role of regulatory
RNA may lead to a better under
standing of several cellular func
tions, influencing our understanding
of cell development and regenera
tion and cancer.
Chang and his lab identified
some of the first known regulatory
RNAs, also referred to as long inter
genic non-coding RNAs, or lincß-
NAs.
Chang was senior author of the
work published in September, while
graduate student Ci Chu was first
author.

Chu and Chang innovated a
"tiling" approach using dozens of in
dividually labeled nucleotide se
quences to isolate the small portion
of regulatory RNAs, or lincßNAs,
that remains bound to chromatin.

The research was funded by the
California Institute for Regenera
tive Medicine, the National Insti
tutes of Health, the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute and the Agency for
Science, Technology and Research
of Singapore.
