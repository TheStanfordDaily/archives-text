## NARRATIVE New food for thought

"W

"Oh my God! Look at that!"
"Dude. This dining hall is legit."
One after the other, students
climbed hurriedly up the stairs.
Looking all around, with eyes wide
open, the hungry hordes made their
way to the second floor of the Arril
laga Family Dining Commons.
The entire floor was buzzing with
excitement, as people eagerly took
their plates to the different food sta
tions. As sunshine permeated
through the large glass windows, stu
dents took their seats and chatted
with friends inside or ventured to the
outdoor seating on the terrace over
looking palm trees and the setting
sun.
One thing is clear: Arrillaga Fam
ily Dining Commons is anything but
the average college dining hall.

A collaborative effort between
Stanford Dining, Stanford Athletics,

the School of Medicine and the Culi
nary Institute of America, Arrillaga
Dining Commons seeks to meet the
various needs of students and change
the way people view their meals.
"It's truly a multi-purpose envi
ronment, with a place for cooking,
exercising and learning," said Shirley
Everett, senior associate vice
provost of residential and dining en
terprises. "We really listened to the
students, and we want this to be a
place that students are proud of."
Rebecca Amato 'l4 and a group
of her friends were among the first to
enter the Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons.
"We had been anticipating the
grand opening, so we waited outside
beforehand because we wanted to
beat the crowd," Amato said.
"It was really cool walking into
the first level," she added. "There
were welcoming couches and pillows,
which you don't normally see in a
dining hall. It felt more like a resort."
This enthusiasm is exactly what
Everett had hoped for.
"It's great to see the looks of stu
dents who are in awe of the dining
hall," she said. "All they can say is,
'Wow,' and when Stanford students
are happy, I'm happy."
The dining commons incorpo
rates the educational aspect of food
and health with its Performance Din
ing Initiative, part of Stanford Din
ing's Eat Well program, and joins to
gether technology, sustainability and
nutritional themes. Unlike most
other dining halls, Arrillaga Dining
Commons seeks to educate students
about the nutritional value of the
food they eat.
The dining hall focuses on six dif
ferent health and nutritional cate
gories, each of which students will
have the opportunity to learn about
through different wellness apps on
the iPads scattered across the din
ing hall.
"It has been calculated that the
average person consumes about 200
million meals in their lifespan," said
Stanford Dining Executive Director
Eric Monte 11. "Our goal is to get stu
dents learning about how the
healthy choices they make can influ
ence their lifestyles."
Anna Nti Asare 'l4 said she be
lieves healthier options are a defi
nite advantage of the new dining
commons.
"The pre-made salads are really
good," Nti Asare said, who is a vege
tarian.
She also appreciates how the din
ing commons accommodates the
needs of students.
"Class schedules don't really fit
nicely with the dining hall hours, so
you end up having to buy food," Nti
Asare said. "But with Arrillaga, you
can still eat in the dining hall."
And that's how it was planned.
"This is a result of a great partner
ship with students," Montell said.
"The extended hours make it so that
students don't have to compromise
skipping meals because of their
classes or other commitments."
Daniel Bui 'l2 said that the Arril
laga Dining Commons is unlike any
dining hall he has been to before.
"I regret that the Arrillaga dining
hall wasn't an option when I was a
sophomore," Bui said.
Other nontraditional features
can be found in the kitchen and the
basement.
"We have a kitchen that is sepa
rated with a wall of glass so students
can see the preparation of their
food," Montell said. "If you go down
stairs, there is a multipurpose room,
and there will be cooking and exer
cise classes held there."
In addition, the dining commons
will be the new host of The Dish, the
late-night dining option that used to be
at Stern. It is expected to open Oct. 13.
With all of its new features and
educational initiatives as food for
thought, the Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons has the potential to
change the way people view dining
at Stanford.
