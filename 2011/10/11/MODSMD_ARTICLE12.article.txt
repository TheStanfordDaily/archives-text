## OP-ED Stop the Wall Street recruitment 
### TERYN NORRIS '12 Truman Scholar ELI POLLAK '12 May field Fellow 
The growing Occupy Wall
Street (OWS) movement has
focused national attention on
the financial industry's power over
American politics and policy. But it
doesn't end there Wall Street also
has extensive influence over the U.S.
higher education system, especially
at universities like Stanford.

Three years after the financial in
dustry nearly caused a second Great
Depression, our nation's top univer
sities remain the primary training
and recruiting grounds for these
same reckless institutions. This is an
tithetical to the civic mission and re
sponsibility of higher education, and
it is time for the academic communi
ty to seriously address this problem.
The financial industry's influence
over higher education is deep and
multifaceted, including student
choice over majors and career
tracks, career development re
sources, faculty and course offerings,
and student culture and political ac
tivism. In 2010, even after the eco
nomic crisis, the financial services in
dustry drew a full 20 percent of Har
vard graduates and over 15 percent
of Stanford and MIT graduates. This
represented the highest portion of
any industry except consulting, and
about three times more than previ
ous generations.
As the financial industry's profits
have increasingly come from com
plex financial products, like the col
lateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
that ignited the 2008 financial melt
down, its demand has steadily grown
for graduates with technical degrees.
In 2006, the securities and commodi
ty exchange sector employed a larg
er portion of scientists and engineers
than semiconductor manufacturing,
pharmaceuticals and telecommuni
cations.

The result has been a major real
location of top talent into financial
sector jobs, many of which are "so
cially useless," as the chairman of the
United Kingdom's Financial Ser
vices Authority put it. This over-allo
cation reduces the supply of produc
tive entrepreneurs and researchers
and damages entrepreneurial capi
talism, according to a recent Kauff
man Foundation report. Many of
these finance jobs contribute to
volatile and counter-productive fi
nancial speculation. Indeed, Wall
Street's activities are largely domi
nated by speculative security trading
and arbitrage instead of investment
in new businesses. In 2010, 63 per
cent of Goldman Sachs' revenue
came from trading, compared to
only 13 percent from corporate fi
nance.

Why are graduates flocking to
Wall Street? Beyond the simple al
lure of high salaries, investment
banks and hedge funds have de
signed an aggressive, sophisticated
and well-funded recruitment system,
which often takes advantage of stu
dent's job insecurity. Moreover, elite
university culture somehow still up
holds finance as a "prestigious" and
"savvy" career track.
But university administrations
are also responsible. At best, they
have passively allowed the largest
banks to dominate student recruit
ment; at worst, they have enthusiasti
cally promoted these companies and
encouraged students to enter fi
nance. To this day, career develop
ment offices accept donations from

the wealthiest banks in exchange for
special recruitment access. For ex
ample, until recently, Stanford's Ca
reer Development Center featured
Goldman Sachs as a "Gold Partner,"
despite the company being under
federal investigation for criminal
trading practices.

The higher education community
needs to begin a serious discussion
about how to ensure checks and bal
ances against finance, and prepare
more students for socially produc
tive careers in public service, entre
preneurship and scientific research.
Some recent trends have been posi
tive, like loan forgiveness for law
school graduates entering public
service. Universities should consider
similar incentives for undergradu
ates, designing proactive, long-term
strategies to encourage alternative
career tracks.

Let us be clear: pursuing a job on
Wall Street isn't evil, and it goes
without saying that we need a strong
and efficient financial sector. But our
generation cannot afford to contin
ue shipping our best and brightest
off to Wall Street. The United States
and the world face enormous chal
lenges in our lifetimes from cli
mate change to global poverty
and we need our top talent focused
on solving these problems. Ameri
ca's university system is one of our
most prized national assets, benefit
ing from taxpayer support and pro
viding invaluable public goods in the
way of knowledge and human capi
tal. It should stop serving as the voca
tional training center for reckless
banks and hedge funds.
This process will be difficult for
many of us with friends and col
leagues in finance. But those of us
privileged enough to attend top uni
versities should have the courage
and responsibility to recognize the
hard truth; an academic community
that actively supports the same fi
nancial institutions whose rampant
greed caused untold national hard
ship is a community on the brink of
moral bankruptcy.

Our nations top
universities remain
the primary training
and recruiting
grounds for these
same reckless
institutions.
