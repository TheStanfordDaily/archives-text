To the Editor:
It is extremely annoying to be as
sociated with a world-renowned
center of learning and to be regular
ly bombarded with University bul
letins that reveal extreme igno
rance, The latest example is an Oct.
1 email from the Stanford Police
concerning a robbery on Palm
Drive near El Camino Real in
which the suspect is described "as a
Hispanic male ..."
It is only correct to use the term
Hispanic to describe people who
share a linguistic and cultural her
itage, It is not a term of race or eth
nicity. Hence using the term His
panic to describe someone's ap
pearance is meaningless since it can
include anyone along the entire
color spectrum of the human race.
It appears that many people in

the United States, including the
Stanford Police, still have a hang up
recognizing that people can be of
mixed ethnicities. The perfect ex
ample of this is the current inhabi
tant of the White House who is
often described by the U.S. media
as "African American" when he is
as much Caucasian as anything
else. Accordingly, the term Hispan
ic or Latino has crept into the pop
ular lexicon as a descriptive term to
describe someone of mixed Euro
pean and indigenous American an
cestry, an individual who in Latin
America would be described as
mestizo or in Canada as metis. This
does not make the use of the term
Hispanic for that purpose proper.
More importantly, an educational
institution such as Stanford Uni
versity should not tolerate its in
correct usage.
