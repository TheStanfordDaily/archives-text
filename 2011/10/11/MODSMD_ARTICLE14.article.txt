# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## How do you make a friend? 
### Camira Powell 
I've never been the "new kid." I
never moved to a different city
or even changed school dis
tricts. Yet whenever new people
would pop up in class, I always
wondered what it was like to have
to start all over again and make
friends. I generally tried to be nice
to them for good karma just in case
I was ever in their position, but I
couldn't fathom what it felt like
knowing everyone knows every
one but you. Or at least, that
was true until I got to Howard Uni
versity.

Before coming to Howard, one
of my biggest concerns was how I
was going to get to know anyone. I
was petrified, thinking I was going
to become a loner who spent 20 out
of 24 hours in my room and sat
alone every day in the dining hall,
not by choice, but because no one
wanted to sit next to me. Luckily,
most of my fears were unfounded.
I've been fortunate enough to find
cool kids to run around and get lost
in DC with, yet I still wonder how
we got to that point.
But this past weekend, I made a
friend.

It was Saturday morning and I
had an hour to get to the Mega√üus
parking lot to meet my friends so
we could head out for a fun week
end in Philly. Sadly, the Metro stops
by campus were closed for mainte
nance during the holiday weekend.
They promised free shuttles to
compensate for the atrocity, but I
arrived at the nearest stop with my
bags in hand only to see the shuttle
pull away. A little disheartened, I

didn't have time to wait for the
next one, so I decided to walk to
the next stop a few blocks down.
My dorm is not located in the
nicest part of DC. It's historical and
has some places worth visiting, but
it's still a bit sketchy (though it's
nothing to fear with an angry face
and quick pace). About halfway be
tween the Shaw-Howard and Mt.
Vernon stops, I saw these dudes on
the corner. Dudes on the corner are
nothing new, but these ones looked
extra grimy. At that same moment,
I saw this taxi pull up behind me
and the cab driver, who was more
than old enough to be my grandfa
ther, asked me if I needed a ride.
So I looked at my options: walk
past these crusty men who will hit
on anything that looks female or
pay the price of the taxi. Taxi won.
At first, I was a little surprised
when he encouraged me to sit in
the front seat. My mind instantly
jumped to the worst-case scenario,
and I kept thinking this is how all
those overly dramatic Lifetime
movies start. But when I saw the
state of the backseat, my hesitation
ebbed. Once inside, he immediate
ly told me that I looked like one of
his people. I didn't know how to re
spond, so he clarified by having me
guess what East African country
we were from (I wrongly guessed
Ethiopia). I never knew I was So
mali, but you learn something new
about yourself every day. As he
continued driving, he asked me all
the basic get-to-know-you ques
tions, and I kept one eye on the
meter that he never turned on. He

proceeded to tell me about his
hope to do some business program
run by Georgetown for older re
turning students and how happy he
was to make a new friend. He even
went as far as to make a deal with
me; he would teach me Arabic if I
helped improve his writing skills
for the program (he taught me two
whole words I can't pronounce to
seal the deal).
By the time I had arrived at the
parking lot early I actually
felt like I had made a friend,
whether I had wanted to or not. In
retrospect, it may not have been
the brightest idea, but deep down
inside, I genuinely believe in the
kindness of strangers (you can
judge me on my naivete later).
Nonetheless, I left the taxi happy
about the decision I made. It's
probably not one I'll make again,
but that little encounter taught me
something valuable. Everyone is a
stranger until you make them a
friend. Even your best buddy since
the fourth grade was just some shy
kid in the corner until your teacher
made you sit next to her in class
and you realized you both love
"Sailor Moon."
So if I can make a friend with
Mohammed the taxi driver, just
think of who you could meet.
