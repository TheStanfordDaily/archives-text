# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Inaccurate readings 
### Nina Chung 
Once upon a time in high
school, I dreamt about a boy.
Don't let your imagination
run wild yet it was a dream about
a conversation. After waking up,
though, I felt differently toward him.
I can't remember if it was anger or
awkwardness, but I avoided him that
day at school. Whether or not he no
ticed my weird spell was pointless to
discuss because, in reality.it had noth
ing to do with him and everything to
do with my head. And beyond that,
he was still one of my closest friends.
Unfortunately, the sudden and
unilateral way that relationships shift
gears is generally a more pessimistic
story. Sometimes we're the culprits:
qualities we once found attractive
can turn repulsive, and first-date high
notes can be hijacked by hokiness. So
we attempt to slyly exit scene. It's like
the book that loses its magic: the
words never changed, but you find
yourself wondering what you found
so interesting in the first place. Other
times we're the victims: all texts, calls
and communications have stopped,
and we wonder how we missed the
vote that kicked us off the island. Yet
these lightning-speed reversals don't
come with a warning, just frustration
and lingering questions: how much of
our relationships are in our heads?
How often do we project our own
false ideas onto others, and how often
do we unknowingly receive them?
I was chatting recently with a
friend about this. He's one of the
most self-admittedly "nice" guys I
know and truly embraces that. He
tries to meet everyone halfway, on
good terms, convinced that it's possi
ble to be friends with everyone. (In
deed, our semi-opposite philoso
phies about people lead to very long
and colorful discussions.) He sus
pects that his pro-amiableness is why
new relationships tend to form spon

taneously before him like fire and
why, at least in his head, they end just
as quickly. Essentially, his commit
ment to see good in the other person
doesn't always outshine the truth of
personality differences and long
term issues. It's the classic case of
how we tend to see what we want to
see for as long as we possibly can.
In relationships, it's mostly a problem
of timing: a promise has usually al
ready been made before we realize it
was with someone we partially con
jured up for ourselves. That notori
ous line, "It's not you; it's me," might
have some real bearing here ...
If only that were more comfort
ing, though. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I
have many more friends on the other
side, suffering from their crushes'
seemingly inexplicable changes of
heart. One of my best girlfriends, who
is smart and isn't wasting time on the
subject, is simply annoyed by her
slight curiosity. After all, with any
new encounter, there is the chance
that we inadvertently hit their rela
tionship deal-breaker and unwitting
ly call the whole thing off; then comes
the inevitable quest to deduce what
horrific thing it was that we said or
did. But the end of a thing, fling or
promise ring can also come from ar
bitrary personal realizations in the
other person's mind. Ironically, this
could be the most comforting thing in
the world: we can't take credit for
everything that happens to us
(though we try very hard to, often
subconsciously).

The de facto definition of "rela
tionship" is everything that exists and
occurs between two people. In this
complicated world, though, everyone
brings his or her baggage on board.
It's never solely about how two peo
ple behave or feel when they're with
each other. It's also about everything
those two people are, respectively,

when they are alone. Dynamics
change and patterns seem inconsis
tent because, ultimately, we don't all
know each other enough to know
what their "consistent" really is. And
assuming so can lead to too many
hurt feelings down the road.
But this story doesn't end like
that. Despite the infuriating nature of
ambiguity, we must admit it makes
the good relationship that much
greater. Despite the black holes of
our highly unknowable heads, we do
meet people who see something true
in us and what's more still want
to be with us. Two independent peo
ple, with their mysteries in tow, can
collide at the right place at the right
time .. . and voila! Friends,
boyfriends, girlfriends this is how
it happens. And it feels like magic
when it does.

This column is like a hello from Nina
to you. Won't you respond? All you
have to do is email ninamc@stanford.
edu to tell her what you think. Happy
Tuesday!

We don't all know each
other enough to know
what their "consistent"
really is.
