## Red Zone needs aid in cheers 
### Tom Taylor 
It might be the American vs.
English cultural barrier, but I
can't help feeling the Red
Zone crowd is lacking some
thing. I can't claim that my
home soccer team has the most vocal
and passionate fans,but I'm used to an
edgier and more involved atmos
phere in stadiums. Thankfully, vio
lence at soccer grounds in the U.K. is
mostly a thing of the past, but the fans
can still be pretty intimidating and
emotions run high.
To me, the standard cheer on the
Farm of "Go, Stanford" just doesn't
sound right. Go where? The British
equivalent would be "Come on, Stan
ford." But while on first inspection
that seems almost the same, it really
isn't. It usually comes with a heavy
dose of pain and even anger, and is
never chanted en masse. It is a person
al cry of frustration in a desperate at
tempt to inject some kind of stimula
tion into your team. "Beat Cal" is just
as bad; what else would the team be
trying to do against Berkeley? Fans
back home would instead direct their
energy at insulting the opposition.
Really good insults are definitely
something I miss. There is nothing like
a few tens of thousands of fans simul
taneously letting an opposing player
know that they think he is, in fact, shit.
It's even funnier when that swear
word is so loud and so clear that TV
crews can do nothing about broad
casting it live across the airwaves.
But this is not about simply being
offensive; opposing teams should feel
intimidated just by walking into the
stadium and hearing the crowd noise,
and I just don't think that happens
here. Maybe it's just a Stanford thing;
friends who did their undergraduate
degrees elsewhere seem to have a
much more colorful cheering vocabu
lary. The Cardinal fans, in comparison,
seem pretty tame, and I have to criti
cize myself for this too. Our array of
chants seems pretty limited and very
bland, and there is a lot of silence com
ing from The Red Zone, Perhaps this
is because, even though we might have
the longest winning streak in the na
tion, we have not been at the top long
enough to really be considered a foot
ball school I doubt many of you
came here because of the football pro
gram â€” and developing a suitably
passionate following is not an
overnight thing.
It might seem like the least of our
athletic worries USC, Oregon and
Andrew Luck's eventual departure
will probably be bigger stories but
college football is a game where you
need every edge you can get. A single
loss can wreck a season, and with
teams only playing each other once a
year, home-field advantage has the
potential to make a big impact. Partly
this is the simple logistics of a team
being able to walk to the game rather
than travel hundreds of miles, but the
mental aspect shouldn't be underesti
mated. Fans of Turkish soccer team
Galatasaray greet their opposition
with the banner "Welcome to Hell." I
couldn't put it any better.
I suspect this is why the Depart
ment of Athletics has opened up all
home games to the student body for
free, and why there are football incen
