## Red Zone needs aid in cheers 
### Tom Taylor 
It might be the American vs.
English cultural barrier, but I
can't help feeling the Red
Zone crowd is lacking some
thing. I can't claim that my
home soccer team has the most vocal
and passionate fans,but I'm used to an
edgier and more involved atmos
phere in stadiums. Thankfully, vio
lence at soccer grounds in the U.K. is
mostly a thing of the past, but the fans
can still be pretty intimidating and
emotions run high.
To me, the standard cheer on the
Farm of "Go, Stanford" just doesn't
sound right. Go where? The British
equivalent would be "Come on, Stan
ford." But while on first inspection
that seems almost the same, it really
isn't. It usually comes with a heavy
dose of pain and even anger, and is
never chanted en masse. It is a person
al cry of frustration in a desperate at
tempt to inject some kind of stimula
tion into your team. "Beat Cal" is just
as bad; what else would the team be
trying to do against Berkeley? Fans
back home would instead direct their
energy at insulting the opposition.
Really good insults are definitely
something I miss. There is nothing like
a few tens of thousands of fans simul
taneously letting an opposing player
know that they think he is, in fact, shit.
It's even funnier when that swear
word is so loud and so clear that TV
crews can do nothing about broad
casting it live across the airwaves.
But this is not about simply being
offensive; opposing teams should feel
intimidated just by walking into the
stadium and hearing the crowd noise,
and I just don't think that happens
here. Maybe it's just a Stanford thing;
friends who did their undergraduate
degrees elsewhere seem to have a
much more colorful cheering vocabu
lary. The Cardinal fans, in comparison,
seem pretty tame, and I have to criti
cize myself for this too. Our array of
chants seems pretty limited and very
bland, and there is a lot of silence com
ing from The Red Zone, Perhaps this
is because, even though we might have
the longest winning streak in the na
tion, we have not been at the top long
enough to really be considered a foot
ball school I doubt many of you
came here because of the football pro
gram â€” and developing a suitably
passionate following is not an
overnight thing.
It might seem like the least of our
athletic worries USC, Oregon and
Andrew Luck's eventual departure
will probably be bigger stories but
college football is a game where you
need every edge you can get. A single
loss can wreck a season, and with
teams only playing each other once a
year, home-field advantage has the
potential to make a big impact. Partly
this is the simple logistics of a team
being able to walk to the game rather
than travel hundreds of miles, but the
mental aspect shouldn't be underesti
mated. Fans of Turkish soccer team
Galatasaray greet their opposition
with the banner "Welcome to Hell." I
couldn't put it any better.
I suspect this is why the Depart
ment of Athletics has opened up all
home games to the student body for
free, and why there are football incen
tives to show up for some other
sports. But creating a better atmos
phere is more than just a numbers
game. Red Zone points were offered
at Cagan Stadium on Sunday for stu
dents coming to watch the Stanford
vs. Cal men's soccer game; the result
was a pretty big turnout, and the
stands started off packed. However,
filling the seats with the uninitiated
didn't seem to work very well. Few
people seemed really caught up in the
game, and a recording of the Band
playing "All Right Now" and a brief
appearance from the Axe Commit
tee failed to light the fires. When Cal
scored in the first halfj quite a few
people seemed to head for the exits,
and by extra time the game was
tied 1-1 at the end of regulation and
so 20 extra minutes were played in
the hope of a result there were a
lot of empty seats. I don't wish to cast
doubt on my fellow students' mo
tives, but it also looked suspiciously
like quite a few were simply scanning
their ID cards before heading home.
At the end of the day, any amount
of incentives or pushing from above
won't work. We need to do this our
selves. Looking at all the various
groups that work to get us pumped
up at games, I think our best bet lies
with the Axe Committee. This is no
criticism of the Band, the Tree or the
Dollies, because they do a great job
and are idiosyncratically Stanford,
but they already do about as much as
they can.The Axe Committee instead
confuses me. Sure, they give out free
t-shirts and honk the big train whistle,
but it seems to me more an excuse
just to get on the field.
So I want to offer a challenge to
the Axe Committee. Come sit among
us, spread yourselves out across The
Red Zone and lead not from the
front but by example. Invent some
new, more intimidating cheers and
teach them to everyone around you
so the whole crowd can sing and
chant as one. And most of all.be loud.

Tom Taylor has been away from
England for a few months and he's
already insulting Stanford fandom.
