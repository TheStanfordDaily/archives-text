# ON TOP IN OREGON
## Cardinal comes back to top Beavers, Ducks on road 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After losing three in a row away from
Maples Pavilion, the No. 7 Stanford
women's volleyball team picked up its
first two road conference wins of the sea
son against Oregon State (11-7,3-5 Pac
-12) and No. 16 Oregon (12-4, 5-3) this
past weekend. The Cardinal (12-3, 6-3)
improved to fifth in a Pac-12 race that
boasts five top-10 teams nationally and
no undefeated squads.
The road trip opened shakily, with
Stanford dropping its first set of the
weekend to a young and unranked Ore
gon State team. Up 22-18, the Cardinal
failed to close out the game, with errors
from sophomore outside hitter Rachel
Williams and redshirt junior middle
blocker Jessica Walker allowing the
Beavers to make a seven-point run for
the 25-22 set victory.

With momentum on the home team's
side, Oregon State stayed close with the
Card throughout the second game.
Leading 22-20, Stanford again let the
Beavers back into the game, with a kill
from freshman outside hitter/middle
blocker Arica Nassar fueling Oregon
State to a 23-23 tie. The Cardinal called a
timeout and came back on the floor to
win back-to-back points a kill by red
shirt freshman outside hitter Lydia Bai
followed by a block by Walker and jun
ior setter Karissa Cook and the set,
25-23.

The next two games proved less dra
matic, with Stanford winning sets three
and four, 25-17 and 25-16, respectively.
After a Cook-kill tied the third set 10-10,
a string of six consecutive plays from
Williams four kills, a shared block
with Walker and a solo block helped
the Card pull away from the Beavers.
Stanford never trailed in the fourth set.

Williams tallied 22 kills and 18 digs,
while Cook put up 47 assists and 14 digs.
This was the ninth double-double of the
season for each, the most in the Pac-12.
It was a big night for Stanford's defen
sive specialists, with sophomore Mary
Ellen Luck registering a career-high
four aces and matching her previous
best 11 digs, while junior DS Hannah
