# ON TOP IN OREGON
## Cardinal comes back to top Beavers, Ducks on road 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
After losing three in a row away from
Maples Pavilion, the No. 7 Stanford
women's volleyball team picked up its
first two road conference wins of the sea
son against Oregon State (11-7,3-5 Pac
-12) and No. 16 Oregon (12-4, 5-3) this
past weekend. The Cardinal (12-3, 6-3)
improved to fifth in a Pac-12 race that
boasts five top-10 teams nationally and
no undefeated squads.
The road trip opened shakily, with
Stanford dropping its first set of the
weekend to a young and unranked Ore
gon State team. Up 22-18, the Cardinal
failed to close out the game, with errors
from sophomore outside hitter Rachel
Williams and redshirt junior middle
blocker Jessica Walker allowing the
Beavers to make a seven-point run for
the 25-22 set victory.

With momentum on the home team's
side, Oregon State stayed close with the
Card throughout the second game.
Leading 22-20, Stanford again let the
Beavers back into the game, with a kill
from freshman outside hitter/middle
blocker Arica Nassar fueling Oregon
State to a 23-23 tie. The Cardinal called a
timeout and came back on the floor to
win back-to-back points a kill by red
shirt freshman outside hitter Lydia Bai
followed by a block by Walker and jun
ior setter Karissa Cook and the set,
25-23.

The next two games proved less dra
matic, with Stanford winning sets three
and four, 25-17 and 25-16, respectively.
After a Cook-kill tied the third set 10-10,
a string of six consecutive plays from
Williams four kills, a shared block
with Walker and a solo block helped
the Card pull away from the Beavers.
Stanford never trailed in the fourth set.

Williams tallied 22 kills and 18 digs,
while Cook put up 47 assists and 14 digs.
This was the ninth double-double of the
season for each, the most in the Pac-12.
It was a big night for Stanford's defen
sive specialists, with sophomore Mary
Ellen Luck registering a career-high
four aces and matching her previous
best 11 digs, while junior DS Hannah

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt freshman outside hitter Lydia Bai (1, above) got crucial kills for the No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball
team against the Oregon schools, including the final two points of the match against the Ducks.
Benjamin tied her career best with
19 digs.
For Oregon State, junior outside
hitter Camille Saxton tied her ca
reer best with 22 kills in addition to
12 digs, five blocks and two aces.
Sophomore libero Becky Defoe
led the match with 27 digs, and jun
ior setter Megan Mcßride notched
42 assists and 11 digs.
The following evening, Stanford
traveled to Eugene to take on then-
No. 15 Oregon. Like the night be
fore, the Cardinal dropped a 25-22
first set decision before rallying to
overtake the Ducks on their home
court in three consecutive sets.
The Cardinal trailed for the
bulk of the first set, retying the
score at 16-16 for the last time in
the game. Oregon would answer
with a four-point run three of
which came off Stanford hitting er

rors before junior outside hitter
Alaina Bergsma closed out the vic
tory with two final kills for the
Ducks.

The second set remained even
through its halfway mark until a
kill by Wopat and an Oregon hit
ting error gave the Card a two
point cushion at 15-13, which soon
became a five-point cushion at 21-
16. Back-to-back Bergsma kills
kept the Ducks' hopes alive, but an
other Wopat kill, an ace and a kill
from freshman outside hitter Mor
gan Boukather sealed the victory
at 25-20.

Set three would mirror set two,
with the Card pulling away from
the Ducks several points at a time
after being tied at 14-14. Though
two Bergsma kills and another
from sophomore middle blocker
Ariana Williams kept Oregon in
the game at match point, a Stanford
timeout followed by a missed serve
from the Ducks gave the Card a 25-
20 set three win.
The fourth set was the closest of
the evening, with seven lead

changes and 14 tied scores. Stan
ford would fight to win the set and
match 25-23 with Bai killing the
final two balls for the Card.

Three Stanford players had kill
totals in the double digits, with
Wopat and Williams putting down
15 apiece Wopat with a phe
nomenal .520 hitting percentage
and Bai contributing another 10.
Cook tallied yet another double
double with 45 assists and 15 digs,
while freshman libero Kyle Gilbert
led the team with 17 digs.
Bergsma shined for the Ducks
with a match-high 26 kills, while
junior outside hitter Katherine Fis
cher added 10. Sophomore setter
Lauren Plum registered 47 assists
and 17 digs, and junior libero Flaley
Jacob picked up 20 digs.
This weekend, Stanford returns
home to take on Washington State
and No. 3 Washington. The Cardi
nal will face the Cougars on Friday
at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

first set decision before rallying to
overtake the Ducks on their home
court in three consecutive sets.
The Cardinal trailed for the
bulk of the first set, retying the
score at 16-16 for the last time in
the game. Oregon would answer
with a four-point run three of
which came off Stanford hitting er

rors before junior outside hitter
Alaina Bergsma closed out the vic
tory with two final kills for the
Ducks.

The second set remained even
through its halfway mark until a
kill by Wopat and an Oregon hit
ting error gave the Card a two
point cushion at 15-13, which soon
became a five-point cushion at 21-
16. Back-to-back Bergsma kills
kept the Ducks' hopes alive, but an
other Wopat kill, an ace and a kill
from freshman outside hitter Mor
gan Boukather sealed the victory
at 25-20.

Set three would mirror set two,
with the Card pulling away from
the Ducks several points at a time
after being tied at 14-14. Though
two Bergsma kills and another
from sophomore middle blocker
Ariana Williams kept Oregon in
the game at match point, a Stanford
timeout followed by a missed serve
from the Ducks gave the Card a 25-
20 set three win.
The fourth set was the closest of
the evening, with seven lead

changes and 14 tied scores. Stan
ford would fight to win the set and
match 25-23 with Bai killing the
final two balls for the Card.

Three Stanford players had kill
totals in the double digits, with
Wopat and Williams putting down
15 apiece Wopat with a phe
nomenal .520 hitting percentage
and Bai contributing another 10.
Cook tallied yet another double
double with 45 assists and 15 digs,
while freshman libero Kyle Gilbert
led the team with 17 digs.
Bergsma shined for the Ducks
with a match-high 26 kills, while
junior outside hitter Katherine Fis
cher added 10. Sophomore setter
Lauren Plum registered 47 assists
and 17 digs, and junior libero Flaley
Jacob picked up 20 digs.
This weekend, Stanford returns
home to take on Washington State
and No. 3 Washington. The Cardi
nal will face the Cougars on Friday
at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.

After losing three in a row away from
Maples Pavilion, the No. 7 Stanford
women's volleyball team picked up its
first two road conference wins of the sea
son against Oregon State (11-7,3-5 Pac
-12) and No. 16 Oregon (12-4, 5-3) this
past weekend. The Cardinal (12-3, 6-3)
improved to fifth in a Pac-12 race that
boasts five top-10 teams nationally and
no undefeated squads.
The road trip opened shakily, with
Stanford dropping its first set of the
weekend to a young and unranked Ore
gon State team. Up 22-18, the Cardinal
failed to close out the game, with errors
from sophomore outside hitter Rachel
Williams and redshirt junior middle
blocker Jessica Walker allowing the
Beavers to make a seven-point run for
the 25-22 set victory.

With momentum on the home team's
side, Oregon State stayed close with the
Card throughout the second game.
Leading 22-20, Stanford again let the
Beavers back into the game, with a kill
from freshman outside hitter/middle
blocker Arica Nassar fueling Oregon
State to a 23-23 tie. The Cardinal called a
timeout and came back on the floor to
win back-to-back points a kill by red
shirt freshman outside hitter Lydia Bai
followed by a block by Walker and jun
ior setter Karissa Cook and the set,
25-23.

The next two games proved less dra
matic, with Stanford winning sets three
and four, 25-17 and 25-16, respectively.
After a Cook-kill tied the third set 10-10,
a string of six consecutive plays from
Williams four kills, a shared block
with Walker and a solo block helped
the Card pull away from the Beavers.
Stanford never trailed in the fourth set.

Williams tallied 22 kills and 18 digs,
while Cook put up 47 assists and 14 digs.
This was the ninth double-double of the
season for each, the most in the Pac-12.
It was a big night for Stanford's defen
sive specialists, with sophomore Mary
Ellen Luck registering a career-high
four aces and matching her previous
best 11 digs, while junior DS Hannah
