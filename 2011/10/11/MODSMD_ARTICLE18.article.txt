# MEN'S SOCCER
## Card breaks goalless drought 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Seventy-seven minutes and 45
seconds into Sunday night's match, it
looked like the men's soccer team
might be doomed to yet another
frustrating 1-0 defeat at the hands of
archrival California. The Cardinal
struggled to capitalize on several
solid scoring chances, as has been the
story for much of a thus-far trying
season. Stanford seemed to be on its
way to a third straight defeat to open
Pac-12play.
But in just two seconds, the time
it took junior Adam Jahn to slam a
25-yard free kick off the underside of

the crossbar and into the back of the
net, that all changed. The Cardinal's
defense held firm, and while the of
fense was shut out the rest of the way,
head coach Bret Simon's team man
aged to halt its losing streak and stay
alive in the brutal Pac-12 Confer
ence.

Stanford (3-6-2, 0-2-1 Pac-12)
had lost six straight matches against
the Golden Bears dating back to
2007, and John Fitzpatrick's header
past redshirt sophomore goalie
Jason Dodson quieted a large crowd
of 2,919 at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Sophomore midfielder J.J. Koval
said that conceding yet another early
goal made things very difficult but

did not stop the players from feeling
that they were in control.
"We came out hard and really
rode the energy of crowd," Koval
said. "They scored the first goal, and
it is really tough to go down early.
But we kept working hard and push
ing, and in the second half I really
thought we had the better chances."
Stanford did not, however, have
the most chances in the half as Cal
outshot the Card 10-5 after the
break. Dodson was kept busy, mak
ing three second-half saves to keep
the game close.
But the Stanford offense started
to zero in, particularly after Simon
pushed an extra attacker forward
in the formation to pressure Cal's
back line. After not putting a single
shot on frame in the first half, the
Cardinal got its best scoring oppor
tunity of the game when Jahn
broke free and finally forced Cal
goalie Bobby Gogatz into a save.
And then, finally, came the
breakthrough.

Junior Dersu Abolfathi earned
a free kick in a very dangerous
area, 25 yards away from goal, just
on the edge of the penalty circle
and straight in front of the net. Jahn
stood over the kick, paused, and
then unleashed a perfectly driven
ball to the top-right corner. It bare
ly nicked off the crossbar, leaving
Gogatz diving helplessly in its
wake.

"The goal was a great relief'.''
Jahn said. "I had gotten really close
to scoring on a free kick a few times
in previous games. Funnily
enough, each set piece was more or
less from the same place on the
field, so to sort of progress and get
closer and closer to finally scoring
was awesome."

It was Jahn's team-leading third

goal of the season and also
snapped the team's 300-minute
scoreless streak. The crowd roared
back to life, and Stanford pressed
forward with a renewed energy.
Redshirt senior Garrett Gunther
had two good chances in the final
minutes two of his five shots for
the game but the game went to
overtime tied at one.

"You know, obviously we've
been struggling to put the ball in
the back of the net," Koval said.
"Which sounds discouraging, but
at the same time we're creating a
lot of chances. Adam's goal was
beautiful, and the whole game
showed a lot about our team's
character; fight hard and stick by
each other's side."
Cal went back on the offensive
in the first extra period, but the
Cardinal's defense was up to the
challenge, snuffing out any real
scoring chances with relative ease.
And in the second extra period,
Gunther led a late charge that saw
a flurry of Stanford shots test the
Bears' defense.

Although none found the back
of the net, it was a positive sign for
the team as it gets close to the

halfway point of conference play.
"I think it was a big goal for the
team because we all felt we de
served a result last night," Jahn said
Monday. "We haven't gotten a re
sult against Cal since I've been
here, so this is a good step in that di
rection and getting that first win
against them."
Seven games remain in the reg
ular season, including a two-game
homestand against Washington
and Oregon State on the schedule
this weekend. Koval was optimistic
that the team can use the 1-1 draw
against last year's Pac-12 champi
ons Cal to gather momentum for a
stretch run.

"The good thing about our Pac
-12 Conference is that you get to
play everyone twice," he said.
"Even though we didn't get the re
sults we wanted against San Diego
State and UCLA, we get a second
chance coming up. And who
knows what can happen. We still
have a good amount of games in
the season anything is possible
in the Pac-12."

the team as it gets close to the

halfway point of conference play.
"I think it was a big goal for the
team because we all felt we de
served a result last night," Jahn said
Monday. "We haven't gotten a re
sult against Cal since I've been
here, so this is a good step in that di
rection and getting that first win
against them."
Seven games remain in the reg
ular season, including a two-game
homestand against Washington
and Oregon State on the schedule
this weekend. Koval was optimistic
that the team can use the 1-1 draw
against last year's Pac-12 champi
ons Cal to gather momentum for a
stretch run.

"The good thing about our Pac
-12 Conference is that you get to
play everyone twice," he said.
"Even though we didn't get the re

State and UCLA, we get a second

knows what can happen. We still
have a good amount of games in
the season anything is possible
in the Pac-12."

Freshman Zach Batteer and the Stanford
men's soccer team had trouble scoring until
junior Adam Jahn found the net against Cal
for the team's first goal in 300 game-minutes.
Seventy-seven minutes and 45
seconds into Sunday night's match, it
looked like the men's soccer team
might be doomed to yet another
frustrating 1-0 defeat at the hands of
archrival California. The Cardinal
struggled to capitalize on several
solid scoring chances, as has been the
story for much of a thus-far trying
season. Stanford seemed to be on its
way to a third straight defeat to open
Pac-12play.
But in just two seconds, the time
it took junior Adam Jahn to slam a
25-yard free kick off the underside of

the crossbar and into the back of the
net, that all changed. The Cardinal's
defense held firm, and while the of
fense was shut out the rest of the way,
head coach Bret Simon's team man
aged to halt its losing streak and stay
alive in the brutal Pac-12 Confer
ence.

Stanford (3-6-2, 0-2-1 Pac-12)
had lost six straight matches against
the Golden Bears dating back to
2007, and John Fitzpatrick's header
past redshirt sophomore goalie
Jason Dodson quieted a large crowd
of 2,919 at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Sophomore midfielder J.J. Koval
said that conceding yet another early
goal made things very difficult but

did not stop the players from feeling
that they were in control.
"We came out hard and really
rode the energy of crowd," Koval
said. "They scored the first goal, and
it is really tough to go down early.
But we kept working hard and push
ing, and in the second half I really
thought we had the better chances."
Stanford did not, however, have
the most chances in the half as Cal
outshot the Card 10-5 after the
break. Dodson was kept busy, mak
ing three second-half saves to keep
the game close.
But the Stanford offense started
to zero in, particularly after Simon
pushed an extra attacker forward
in the formation to pressure Cal's
back line. After not putting a single
shot on frame in the first half, the
Cardinal got its best scoring oppor
tunity of the game when Jahn
broke free and finally forced Cal
goalie Bobby Gogatz into a save.
And then, finally, came the
breakthrough.

Junior Dersu Abolfathi earned
a free kick in a very dangerous
area, 25 yards away from goal, just
on the edge of the penalty circle
and straight in front of the net. Jahn
stood over the kick, paused, and
then unleashed a perfectly driven
ball to the top-right corner. It bare
ly nicked off the crossbar, leaving
Gogatz diving helplessly in its
wake.

"The goal was a great relief'.''
Jahn said. "I had gotten really close
to scoring on a free kick a few times
in previous games. Funnily
enough, each set piece was more or
less from the same place on the
field, so to sort of progress and get
closer and closer to finally scoring
was awesome."

It was Jahn's team-leading third

goal of the season and also
snapped the team's 300-minute
scoreless streak. The crowd roared
back to life, and Stanford pressed
forward with a renewed energy.
Redshirt senior Garrett Gunther
had two good chances in the final
minutes two of his five shots for
the game but the game went to
overtime tied at one.

"You know, obviously we've
been struggling to put the ball in
the back of the net," Koval said.
"Which sounds discouraging, but
at the same time we're creating a
lot of chances. Adam's goal was
beautiful, and the whole game
showed a lot about our team's
character; fight hard and stick by
each other's side."
Cal went back on the offensive
in the first extra period, but the
Cardinal's defense was up to the
challenge, snuffing out any real
scoring chances with relative ease.
And in the second extra period,
Gunther led a late charge that saw
a flurry of Stanford shots test the
Bears' defense.

Although none found the back
of the net, it was a positive sign for
the team as it gets close to the

halfway point of conference play.
"I think it was a big goal for the
team because we all felt we de
served a result last night," Jahn said
Monday. "We haven't gotten a re
sult against Cal since I've been
here, so this is a good step in that di
rection and getting that first win
