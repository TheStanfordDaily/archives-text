# STANFORD SPLITS EAST COAST TRIP
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford field hockey team had won eight consec
utive matches, one short of the school record, before head
ing out last weekend on a two-game East Coast road trip.
With the spotlight on, the Cardinal lived up to its No. 7
national ranking with an easy 4-1 victory over previously

red-hot Harvard. But on
Sunday, Stanford (10-2,
3-0 NorPac) saw its win
streak snapped in a 6-3
showdown with No. 12
New Hampshire.

The loss in the Granite State was just the Card's second
all season, and its first since losing a tough match at No. 4
Connecticut in the second match of the year.
The Wildcats jumped on the board first, as All-Ameri
can Whitney Frates scored two of her game-high three
goals in the first 20 minutes. Both were unassisted, but New
Hampshire was also pressing as a team, earning four
penalty corners and outshooting Stanford in the first half.
But the Cardinal responded, fighting back with a goal
in the 29th minute from sophomore attacker Courtney
Haldeman off a nice centering pass from senior attacker
Stephanie Byrne. At that point, it appeared as though

After cruising to a 4-1 victory at Harvard, the Stanford field hockey team fell against No. 12
New Hampshire, 6-3. The loss was just the Card's second all season and its first since August.
Stanford might have found its
rhythm, but New Hampshire at
tacker Emma Erler broke free in
front of the cage and put away the
Wildcats' third goal for a 3-1 lead
just before halftime.
After the break, New Hamp
shire poured it on, as Hayley
Rausch knocked in a pair of goals

the second off her own rebound

to push the lead to four. Frates
found a little space and put the
game all but out of reach 10 minutes
before time.

Yet Stanford refused to quit, and
redshirt sophomore attacker Emily
Henriksson cut into the lead with a
goal two minutes before Byrne con
verted a redirect to give the Cardi
nal a glimmer of hope with just a
few minutes remaining. But New
Hampshire's defense held firm,
putting a slight damper on the
weekend.

Friday's match was a much dif
ferent story, however, as Harvard's
defense struggled to contain the
Cardinal's attack. Stanford outshot
the Crimson 23-5 for the match and
scored three unanswered goals
Harvard had allowed three goals in
its previous four matches to salt
the game away early on.
Junior defender Becky Dru
added to her recent string of suc
cess, as last year's NorPac Defen
sive Player of the Year continued an
offensive surge this season with her
10th and 11th goals, both off penal
ty corners.

Harvard didn't really threaten
until late in the second half, when it
scored a nice goal past redshirt sen
ior goalie Ale Moss to trim Stan
ford's lead to two. But Dru's second
goal of the match three minutes be
fore the end of the match put an ex
clamation point on the victory.
Stanford is now 6-2 away from
home after splitting the weekend
matches, and the Cardinal will have
to travel for three of its five remain
ing regular season games, including
a road trip to Michigan and Michi
gan State in two weeks.
Stanford will have the advan
tage of playing at home, though, for
the NorPac Championship in the
first week of November. The Cardi
nal has won all five of its matches at
the Varsity Turf. With only 16 spots
up for grabs, all of the remaining
matches will be critical to securing a
berth in the NCAA Tournament,
slated to begin Saturday, Nov. 12,
when the top eight teams will also
have home-turf advantage.
Next up for the Card is a three
game stretch to complete NorPac
play, beginning Friday when Stan
ford hosts Pacific at 7 p.m.
