Junior Mallory Burdette beat
Florida tennis players in two finals
on Sunday at the ITA All-American
Championships in Pacific Palisades,
Calif.
After being ousted in straight
sets in the first round of the main
singles draw, Burdette rebounded
to dominate the consolation brack
et. In four consolation matches,
Burdette lost a total of 27 games
and only one set. She capped her
performance with her most impres
sive win in the final, a 6-1, 6-2
stomping of Florida's Joanna
Mather.

Just hours after her singles final,

Burdette played another final, this
time in the main draw. Sophomore
Nicole Gibbs paired with Burdette
to win the doubles title, sweeping
two more Gators. Allie Will and
Sofie Oyen proved little match for
the Cardinal duo, as Burdette and
Gibbs rolled to a 6-2,7-6 (2) victory
in the final. The win capped a string
of five straight victories for the new
Stanford doubles team.
The Stanford women's tennis
team's next action will be this
weekend at the Saint Mary's Invita
tional in Moraga, Calif.
