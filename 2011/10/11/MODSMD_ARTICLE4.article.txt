## Pulitzer Prize-winning poet captivates audience Mary Oliver unites range of community members 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There was little applause at the end of
each poem Mary Oliver read Monday
night. Instead, the last line of each poem
was met with a collective murmur of ap
proval from the captivated audience. De
spite the rain, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
poet, invited by the Creative Writing de
partment through the Jean and Bill Lane
Lecture Series, drew an audience larger
than Cemex Auditorium's capacity of 600.
Oliver was introduced as a "Virgilian
guide to the natural world" by Eavan
Boland, head of the Creative Writing De
partment. "Because of her poems," Boland
said, "the world continues to offer itself to
our imagination."
Jean Lane, sponsor of the lecture series,

was present at the reading. She discussed
her decision to invite Oliver and said, "She
sees nature so much like I do, in the same
spirit. I love her words."

Oliver, 76, has published close to 30 vol
umes of poetry. Last night, she read a
range of poems that spanned across vari
ous volumes, as well as some new, unpub
lished poetry. Threaded through the read
ing were three poems dedicated to her
dog, Percy, named after the Romantic poet
Percy Shelley.

"The Percy poems were really sweet,"
said David Jia, 'l3, after the reading. "I real
ly liked that she named her dog after Percy
Shelley it made him seem so much more
like a human."

Throughout the reading, Oliver joked
with her rapt audience, "You're so quiet,
you people!" she exclaimed after a poem
ended to another quiet wave of satisfied
sighs and appreciative murmurs. "I should
have some fighting poems! I don't have any.
