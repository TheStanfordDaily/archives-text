## Pulitzer Prize-winning poet captivates audience Mary Oliver unites range of community members 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There was little applause at the end of
each poem Mary Oliver read Monday
night. Instead, the last line of each poem
was met with a collective murmur of ap
proval from the captivated audience. De
spite the rain, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
poet, invited by the Creative Writing de
partment through the Jean and Bill Lane
Lecture Series, drew an audience larger
than Cemex Auditorium's capacity of 600.
Oliver was introduced as a "Virgilian
guide to the natural world" by Eavan
Boland, head of the Creative Writing De
partment. "Because of her poems," Boland
said, "the world continues to offer itself to
our imagination."
Jean Lane, sponsor of the lecture series,

was present at the reading. She discussed
her decision to invite Oliver and said, "She
sees nature so much like I do, in the same
spirit. I love her words."

Oliver, 76, has published close to 30 vol
umes of poetry. Last night, she read a
range of poems that spanned across vari
ous volumes, as well as some new, unpub
lished poetry. Threaded through the read
ing were three poems dedicated to her
dog, Percy, named after the Romantic poet
Percy Shelley.

"The Percy poems were really sweet,"
said David Jia, 'l3, after the reading. "I real
ly liked that she named her dog after Percy
Shelley it made him seem so much more
like a human."

Throughout the reading, Oliver joked
with her rapt audience, "You're so quiet,
you people!" she exclaimed after a poem
ended to another quiet wave of satisfied
sighs and appreciative murmurs. "I should
have some fighting poems! I don't have any.
What can you do?" However, she
elicited enthusiastic applause when
she read her iconic poems Wild
Geese and The Summer Day, both
which have been widely published.
Oliver also kept up a steady
stream of self-conscious banter be
tween poems. Riffling through her
own book to find the next poem, she
said, to a wave of laughter, "I'm very
organized, except that my organiza
tion isn't very good. That's why
there 's a table of contents." She also
drew chuckles when she comment
ed, "I'm old and I'm supposed to be
laboring. Sometimes I want to sit
down and have an ice-cream sundae
and forget it."
On a more serious note, she high
lighted her concern about the environ
ment, a theme evident in her poetry.
"I do worry a great, great, great
deal about the environmental dev
astation of the world," she said. "We
are many, probably more than we
should be as a species and we have
to be careful about our usage of
things. I worry about the little kids
that I know now will they even
know what the world was like?"
At the end of the reading, stu
dents and community members
milled around in the rain, hoping to
catch Oliver for a signing.
"You can just see she speaks to
the heart of the whole community,"

Boland said, pointing to the mixed
crowd of students and white-haired
locals. "The community is united by
this event."

"She was wonderful," said Lucas
Loredo 'l2. "I don't really read poet
ry, but I found her poems really ac
cessible. They were profound in a
way that wasn't highfalutin they
were not claiming to be anything
grand, but they were."
