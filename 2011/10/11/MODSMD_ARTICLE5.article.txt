# Fed aid sets new rules
## Students must meet five standards for aid 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
New federal regulations require that students re
ceiving federal aid funds meet five standards of Satis
factory Academic Progress (SAP), according to the
University Financial Aid Office website.
The new Program Integrity Regulations, which
took effect July 1, require that students maintain a 2.0
minimum cumulative GPA, earn at least nine units per
quarter and 36 units over three quarters, are enrolled
for no longer than 18 undergraduate quarters and
meet a minimum cumulative pace of progression that
is set by each undergraduate institution.
Stanford's Financial Aid Office has set the required
pace of progression how many units a student com
pletes divided by how many units a student attempts
at 60 percent.

"The federal government doesn't want to pay for
you to keep trying to take classes and dropping out at
the last minute," said Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper.

Although the Department of Education has always
maintained SAP requirements for students on federal
or state financial aid, this set of regulations is the first
to set a higher standard for academic progress than the
University's own enrollment requirements, due to the
new pace of progression regulation.
"I think it's another prompt for students to be
aware of the body of coursework they are signing up
for and to think thoughtfully and deliberately in con
sultation with one or more advisers to ensure that the
body of coursework that they're planning for them
selves is attainable," said Randy Williams, associate
dean of Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR).

Due to differing standards between the Universi
ty's enrollment requirements and the federal aid aca
demic progress requirements, both UAR and the Fi
nancial Aid Office will be communicating with stu
dents on federal or state aid about their academic
progress.

"I'm a little concerned about how students will feel
about the Financial Aid Office approaching them to
talk about their academic situation," Cooper said.
If a student fails to meet the SAP requirements, a
student will enter "Financial Aid Warning" status for
the following academic quarter but will remain eligi
ble for federal student aid funds.

Flowever, these students must earn at least 12 units
of credit while in "Financial Aid Warning" status. This
status is only available once to students. A student will
enter "Financial Aid Ineligible" status if they fail to the
meet the SAP requirements for any subsequent aca-
