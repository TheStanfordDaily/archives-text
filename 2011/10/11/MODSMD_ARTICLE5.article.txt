# Fed aid sets new rules
## Students must meet five standards for aid 
### ALICE PHILLIPS DESK EDITOR 
New federal regulations require that students re
ceiving federal aid funds meet five standards of Satis
factory Academic Progress (SAP), according to the
University Financial Aid Office website.
The new Program Integrity Regulations, which
took effect July 1, require that students maintain a 2.0
minimum cumulative GPA, earn at least nine units per
quarter and 36 units over three quarters, are enrolled
for no longer than 18 undergraduate quarters and
meet a minimum cumulative pace of progression that
is set by each undergraduate institution.
Stanford's Financial Aid Office has set the required
pace of progression how many units a student com
pletes divided by how many units a student attempts
at 60 percent.

"The federal government doesn't want to pay for
you to keep trying to take classes and dropping out at
the last minute," said Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper.

Although the Department of Education has always
maintained SAP requirements for students on federal
or state financial aid, this set of regulations is the first
to set a higher standard for academic progress than the
University's own enrollment requirements, due to the
new pace of progression regulation.
"I think it's another prompt for students to be
aware of the body of coursework they are signing up
for and to think thoughtfully and deliberately in con
sultation with one or more advisers to ensure that the
body of coursework that they're planning for them
selves is attainable," said Randy Williams, associate
dean of Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR).

Due to differing standards between the Universi
ty's enrollment requirements and the federal aid aca
demic progress requirements, both UAR and the Fi
nancial Aid Office will be communicating with stu
dents on federal or state aid about their academic
progress.

"I'm a little concerned about how students will feel
about the Financial Aid Office approaching them to
talk about their academic situation," Cooper said.
If a student fails to meet the SAP requirements, a
student will enter "Financial Aid Warning" status for
the following academic quarter but will remain eligi
ble for federal student aid funds.

Flowever, these students must earn at least 12 units
of credit while in "Financial Aid Warning" status. This
status is only available once to students. A student will
enter "Financial Aid Ineligible" status if they fail to the
meet the SAP requirements for any subsequent aca-
demic quarter.
If a student enters "Financial
Aid Ineligible" status, all federal
aid is rescinded for that quarter un
less the student appeals the deci
sion to Stanford. Williams said that
if a student creates a plan with his
or her academic adviser for contin
ued academic improvement, the
student could once again qualify for
financial aid for that quarter until
improvement is established.
"I'm guessing that we're talking
about less that one percent of the
student population," Williams said,
regarding the number of under
graduates this policy could affect.
"We're talking low double-digit
numbers, 10 to 15. Extremely low
numbers."

The July 1 Program Integrity
Regulations include other provi
sions that do not apply to Stanford
because the University's students
are either degree-seeking or ineligi
ble for federal aid. For example, one
provision states that programs that

award certificates rather than de
grees must track how many of their
students go on to careers in the per
tinent field and if they are successful.
"The concern is that the motor
cycle mechanic programs out there
that are for-profit are allowing stu
dents to continue to enroll even
though they're not being successful
over and over again just so [the pro
grams] can get their money," Coop
er said.
The new regulations also re
quire that schools have a net-price
calculator on their financial aid web
page by Oct. 29. Stanford's Finan
cial Aid Office already maintains
such a calculator to estimate what a
Stanford education might cost once
grants and scholarships are award
ed, but the office has to rename the
calculator as a net price calculator.
"A lot of what's going on these
days at the federal level has to do
with the nonprofit versus the pri
vate, for-profit sector," Cooper
said. "There's a feeling of wanting
to regulate that for-profit sector
and unfortunately, when they do
that, we all get swept up."
