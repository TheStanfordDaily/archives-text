## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
Enrollment for employee health
care plans are scheduled to be open
from Oct. 24 to Nov. 10, following a
series of town hall meetings con
cerning the University's decision to
replace Health Net and PacifiCare
with the new Blue Shield Exclusive
Provider Organization (EPO).
Employee plans with Health
Net and PacifiCare will be replaced
by the Blue Shield EPO on Jan. 1,
according to the Stanford Benefits
Office.
The Benefits Office held town
hall meetings throughout Septem
ber to discuss the upcoming changes.
The meetings were held at the Clark
Center, Tresidder Memorial Union,
Hopkins Marine Station and SLAC
National Accelerator Laboratory,
among other locations.
Employees with Health Net and
PacifiCare were encouraged to
check that their doctors and pre
scriptions fall under the Blue Shield
Preferred Provider Organization

for obtaining preauthorization for
non-elective and non-emergency
procedures.
