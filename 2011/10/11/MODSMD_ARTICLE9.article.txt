# SLAC study sheds light on black holes

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Tyler Brown Margaret Rawson 
Most of the gamma rays pro
duced by black holes are created
much farther from the bodies than
expected, according to a study by
Stanford and SLAC National Accel
erator Laboratory scientists. Data
from more than 20 telescopes
showed that the jets of particles that
stream out of bright galaxies func
tion differently than researchers
previously thought.
The recent work by scientists at
the Kavli Institute for Particle As
trophysics and Cosmology, jointly
located at SLAC and Stanford Uni
versity, may help theorists better ex
plain some of the keys to the uni
verse, such as how its biggest acceler
ators operate.

Above the Milky Way, galaxies
called blazars prevail in the gamma
ray filled sky. At the center of a blaz
er is a black hole. When matter falls
into such a black hole, some energy
is spit back out into the universe in
the form of jets of particles.
Earlier theories have suggested
that tendrils of magnetic field hold
these jets together, while the light is
produced when the particles revolve
around these tendrils. However, the
details of that process have been
poorly understood.
During more than a year of ob
servation, researchers witnessed a
20-day-long flare in gamma rays

from a blazar jet located in the con
stellation Virgo, in concurrence with
a change in the directionality of the
jet's optical light.
Previous theories suggested that
gamma rays are created where the
matter entering the black hole loses
its energy, near the point of entry.
This new data suggests that both
types of light are created in the same
geographical region of the jet. If
gamma rays are created farther from
the black hole than previously
thought, magnetic field lines must
help energy travel outward from the
black hole.
