# Stanford takes part in energy-efficiency challenge
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Stanford committed to help raise
$65 million along with 31 other high
er-education institutions as part of
the Billion Dollar Green Challenge,
which was launched publicly on Tues
day at the Association for the Ad
vancement of Sustainability in High
er Education (AASHE) Conference
in Pittsburgh. This pot of money will
be invested in energy-efficient proj
ects, called "green revolving funds."
According to a statement on the
organization's website, the challenge
was inspired by a report published
last February by the Sustainable En
dowments Institute, which showed
that existing green revolving funds
have had a 32-percent median annu
al return of investment.
"The Billion Dollar Green Chal
lenge asks our higher education sys
tems to invest in green revolving
funds to support the campus sustain
ability movement," AASHE execu
tive director Paul Rowland said in a
statement. "AASHE supports The
Challenge in that these funds will
help institutions become more sus
tainable and will help the higher edu
cation community understand the
commitment they are making to a
just and sustainable future."
Stanford will join other institu
tions such as Harvard University,
Dartmouth College and Arizona
State University. Harvard is rolling
over a $l2 million Green Loan Fund,
which was established in 1992 and
had an average annual return on in
vestment of 29.9 percent.
The goal of the Challenge, as its
name implies, is for a cumulative
amount of $1 billion to be eventually in
vested into these green revolving funds.
Fahmida Ahmed, associate direc
tor at Stanford's Office of Sustain
ability, said in the statement that the
University's "fund has already fi
nanced over 200 small and large effi
ciency projects on campus, with an
average, simple payback period of
just four years."
