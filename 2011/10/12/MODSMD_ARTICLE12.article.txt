## NARRATIVE Santigo, que lindo! 
### ERIKA ALVERO KOSKI DESK EDITOR 
Boarding the flight to Lima, Peru that would ul
timately connect to Santiago, I realized I was
in a much different part of San Francisco In
ternational Airport than the little Southwest
cranny I usually passed through after my va
cations. I was unsure which language to speak, but as I
passed through the gate, I felt as though I were crossing
a border. And by the time I reached my seat, I knew that
Spanish was the optimal choice for blending in.
I told myself that I chose the "Espanol" option when
watching "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Yes! Man" on
my flight to practice my Spanish, but secretly the reason
was that I didn't want to be labeled as a gringa by my
Latino seatmate or the stewardess when the subtitles
appeared. I don't think either of them was fooled.
After a seven-hour nighttime sojourn in Lima and a
second flight, I finally landed in Santiago, where I was
greeted with extensive paperwork and confusion at the
customs gate.
The customs officer spoke impeccable English, but
my ineptitude at international travel and tendency to get
flustered at all the wrong times threw me off anyway.
Outside taxi drivers clamped onto new arrivals and
hawked their services with impressive determination.
Fellow Stanford student Susha Roy 'l3 and I found our
way to the recommended shuttle service and departed

for the hotel where orientation would take place.
Walking the streets of Santiago for the first few days
was an experiment in self-consciousness. Chileans ap
peared to be quite a heterogeneous mixture of people,
and so why shouldn't a group of Americans easily blend
in? But that wasn't to be, as the cultural nuances of pos
ture, dress code and most importantly, language, are im
possible to disguise.
Marching by in our 28-person contingent, chatting
and laughing loudly in English, we may as well as have
had the word "extranjeros" (foreigners) stamped across
our foreheads. The more fashionably dressed and Span
ish-speaking Chileans hurrying along the sidewalks
gave us knowing looks as we passed, sometimes even
grinning and chuckling to their companions as they no
ticed our conspicuous group.
Ringing the doorbell of my soon-to-be apartment
home, the door was flung open by a small, merry-look
ing woman with huge brown eyes, setting off the tinkle
of the wind chimes attached to the handle. Exclaiming in
delight, my new host mother showered me with wel
come besitos (kisses) and led me to my room, laughing
all the way.
My room was small and bright, and best of all, led
outside to a balcony overlooking an energetic alley and
facing another apartment building. The walls of the ad
jacent apartment were white, just like those of mine,

with curtains of flowers draping off parallel balconies and
colorful pinwheels spinning in the light breeze. Already I
was excited to sit and read outside on my own balcony ...
or throw water balloons at the people three floors down, as
my 11-year-old host brother Julio suggested.
"Aqulla gente le gusta vivir mucho," said Mane, my host
mother. "Here the people like to live,"
I think Mane's favorite word is Undo , or beautiful. The
days are Undo, Chile is Undo, the people are Undo, life is
Undo. It's an infectious exuberance - and I find it not only in
Mane but outside in the streets, at the parks dotted with
couples and spurting fountains, at the Brazilian dance class
es on the way up the winding Cerro San Cristobal road.
The university sector is vibrant, students lounge about in
restaurants or bars, dressed in neon colors and floral pat
terns as summer approaches. In testimony to the recent
protests, passionate quotes against the privatization of edu
cation span a nearby wall. Swirls of graffiti on the same wall
depict skulls eating pencils and books alongside a man
walking backwards the students argue that the current
education systems are steps backwards for the government.
From my humble perspective as a foreign observer,
Santiago is not a city that encourages passivity, but one
that embraces passion and amor (love) of the vida linda
(beautiful life).
