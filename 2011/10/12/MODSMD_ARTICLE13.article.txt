Students who choose to explore
campus will notice many
changes to the built environ
ment around them. From the state
of-the-art Knight Management Cen
ter, to the award-winning Arrillaga
Family Dining Commons, to the
long-awaited Bing Concert Hall, am
bitious new construction has re
shaped the University. Living as we
do in an area prone to major earth
quakes, it should please all members
of the Stanford community to know
that these new buildings are planned
to withstand the worst shaking that
the San Andreas Fault has to offer.
However, it is somewhat less com
forting to know that older structures
known to be seismically unsound
have been allowed to stand. Before
the next time Stanford decides to re
place the palm trees in front of the
Arrillaga Alumni Center as it did last
summer, the University should make
certain that all of its structures are
prepared for the inevitable quake
that will one day rock the campus.
The most conspicuous building
known to be unsafe in the event of an
Earthquake is Meyer Library. Dat
ing from 1966, the library continues
to serve as a focal point of academic
life at the University despite being
declared seismically unsound in
2007. Demolition of the library was
scheduled for 2012, but in the inter
vening years, the University failed to
make a decision regarding the future
location of the material currently re
siding in Meyer's East Asia Library.
Though nothing has been set in
stone, the University has achieved
something of a consensus that the
East Asia Library will move to a new
home in the Graduate School of
Business South building. Unfortu
nately, assuming that the Board of
Trustees approves the move, the new
space will not be ready until at least
2014. Demolition of Meyer library
cannot even be scheduled before
that date. Even if demolition pro
ceeds quickly after Meyer's contents
are relocated, nearly a decade will
have passed between the study that
affirmed Meyer's seismic vulnerabil

ity and the time when the building no
longer endangers its patrons.
Another notable structure that
could present danger in the event of
an earthquake is Searsville Dam, lo
cated far to the Southwest of the
main campus in Stanford's Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve. Con
structed over a century ago, the dam
withstood the major earthquakes in
1906 and 1989 with only a few finger
sized cracks appearing in the more
severe 1906 quake that proved
harmless and easily repaired. Judg
ing from its past success and a recent
seismological study touting its struc
tural integrity, the risk from the dam
does not stem from complete col
lapse, but from something rather
more mundane.
Searsville Lake, the reservoir cre
ated by Searsville Dam, has been fill
ing with silt since its construction.
The reservoir is now between 90 and
95 percent silt, with the majority of
that accumulating during earth
quakes and extremely heavy rains. A
large earthquake could completely
fill the reservoir with silt within a
year, with unpredictable conse
quences for communities down
stream. Proposals have been floated
for removing the dam and for dredg
ing the silt, but thus far debate over
those options has been inconclusive.
Whichever solution to the silting
question is decided on, it will be far
easier and likely cheaper as well
to implement it over a longer time
frame than would be available if an
earthquake were to force decision
makers' hands.

Decisions to demolish, retrofit or
construct buildings should never be
made lightly. Nevertheless, the long
delays that have accompanied debate
over the futures of Meyer Library
and Searsville Dam have put safety
and property in jeopardy. Though less
glamorous than a new concert hall,
eliminating the aforementioned
threats must be done in a timely fash
ion. Stanford has been on the cutting
edge of both earthquake science and
earthquake preparedness for
decades. Let's keep it that way.
