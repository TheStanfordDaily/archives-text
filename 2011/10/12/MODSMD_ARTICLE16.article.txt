# JOBBERISH
## This Bud's for you 
### Amanda Ach 
One of the most difficult parts of
job searching as a Stanford
student is finding something
that makes you feel like your time at
Stanford was worth it. Because we all
work so hard, there's this immense
pressure to do something amazing
and academic with your education,
and then win a Nobel Prize for it
and then win a Pulitzer Prize for the
book you write about winning the
Nobel Prize. Don't get me wrong a
life in academia is meaningful and ful
filling. It's just not for everyone. What
ultimately makes people happy is
doing what they love, and that might
not be anything academic. So this
week, I'm going to suggest a career
outside of the proverbial academic
box that is rewarding, completely le
gitimate and more than anything, a lot
of fun.

This week's topic: the beer ci
cerone.

I fully believe that a hobby can be
come a career, and one of the most
popular hobbies on campus is drink
ing beer. So for those of you who enjoy
your occasional (or not so occasional)
brewski, listen up: you could spend
your life getting paid to drink beer and
tell people if it's good or not. Now this

might come as quite a shock to the frat
boys on campus, but beer can actually
taste good. And when paired with the
right food, it can taste really good. As a
beer cicerone essentially a wine
sommelier, but for beer it will be
your job to identify these good beers
(hint: Natty Light is not one of them)
and share these opinions with the rest
of the beer-loving world.
The life of a beer cicerone is not just
one of drinking tons and tons of beer,
although you will get to do that as well.
Cicerones get to travel around the
world, tasting different local beers and
attending various culinary festivals.
Because part of a cicerone's job de
scription involves pairing beer with
food, you also get to enjoy the world of
fine dining. Most cicerones, like their
sommelier counterparts, choose to
work in the restaurant industry, where
their knowledge is increasingly in de
mand as beer becomes an ever-more
important aspect of the culinary
world.

The Cicerone Certification Pro
gram was started in 2008 in response
to this growing interest in finer beers
and the art of brewing. Beer is now
appreciated as a complicated bever
age with many varieties and taste lev-

els and is most often not served out of
a keg. Some even say beer is the new
wine the food pairings are just as
exact, the flavor descriptions just as
elaborate and the snobs just as snob
by. And unlike wine, beer is the alco
hol least affected by the current eco
nomic downturn, making it the best
place to be if you're going into the al
cohol industry (or should I say, re
maining in the industry) post-gradua
tion. In fact, this is such a new field
that there are only 210 certified ci
cerones and three master cicerones in
the world. Three. Just for compari
son's sake, there are 180 master som
meliers worldwide. This should give
you some indication of just how many
job opportunities there will be for the
fourth master cicerone.

But you can't just go to a bar, order
a beer and call yourself a cicerone.
The certification process is exhaus
tive and involves three levels of certi
fication. The first is a certified beer
server, of which there are over 5,000
worldwide; this also requires the least

training. If you have completed a
prep course or have a sufficiently
large ego, you are essentially ready to
take the brief, online examination.
The next level, a certified cicerone, is
more demanding, requiring at least
one year of work in the brewing or
beer-serving industry in addition to
being an already certified beer serv
er. Lastly, becoming a master ci
cerone requires several years of ex
perience in the beer industry and
completion of an arduous two-day,
12-hour long test. Sounds rough, but

at the end you get a little metal pin to
put on your lapel, which is really the
important part.
Think this sounds great but is
maybe not the best use of your Stan
ford education? Think again. Ray
Daniels, the man who founded the
certification program, graduated from
Harvard Business School, and many
brewers are well-educated chemists
with degrees from top universities. It's
not a fluff job being a cicerone is se
rious work. It also just so happens to
involve copious amounts of free alco
hol.

Do you know of a good beer? Amanda
would love to have you take her out and
buy her one, so email her at aach@stan
ford.edu.

meliers worldwide. This should give
you some indication of just how many
job opportunities there will be for the
fourth master cicerone.

But you can't just go to a bar, order
a beer and call yourself a cicerone.
The certification process is exhaus
tive and involves three levels of certi
fication. The first is a certified beer
server, of which there are over 5,000
worldwide; this also requires the least

training. If you have completed a
prep course or have a sufficiently
large ego, you are essentially ready to
take the brief, online examination.
The next level, a certified cicerone, is
more demanding, requiring at least
one year of work in the brewing or
beer-serving industry in addition to
being an already certified beer serv
er. Lastly, becoming a master ci
cerone requires several years of ex
perience in the beer industry and
completion of an arduous two-day,
12-hour long test. Sounds rough, but

at the end you get a little metal pin to
put on your lapel, which is really the
important part.
Think this sounds great but is
maybe not the best use of your Stan
ford education? Think again. Ray
Daniels, the man who founded the
certification program, graduated from
Harvard Business School, and many
brewers are well-educated chemists
with degrees from top universities. It's
not a fluff job being a cicerone is se
rious work. It also just so happens to
involve copious amounts of free alco
hol.
