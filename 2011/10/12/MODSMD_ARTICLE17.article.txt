# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## The 						silent voices of Stanford 
### Jamie Solomon 
One of the reasons I chose to
write a column for The Stan
ford Daily is that too often I
feel that my voice has been silenced
at Stanford; so, the idea of having a
platform where I can openly say
what I think without being inter
rupted or overpowered by dissent
ing opinions is appealing (albeit
scary). This may seem like a bold
statement to make, especially if you
know me, because I am someone
who freely shares my opinions with
others. However, I do not always act
this way; I'm often quiet in new sit
uations until I've gained a feel for
the space and people and have an
idea of the ways in which I'm al
lowed to behave. In spaces like the
classroom or with people that I'm
not that close to, I'm frequently
pretty quiet even if there's a lot run
ning through my mind. In those sit
uations it's not that I don't have a
lot to say, it's just that my opinions
are not as welcome and are less like
ly to be listened to.
I'm sure a lot of you can relate to
the feeling of staying quiet even
when you have things to say. I want

to use this column to explore this
not as an artifact of my individual
personality (which in many cases it
is), but as part of a larger process
that happens on this campus. The
process of silencing others is subtle
and often not apparent to those
who do not experience it or who are
perpetrating it. I want to talk about
how this has happened to me to try
to raise awareness of how it hap
pens and to encourage students to
think about how they may be mini
mizing the voices of others.
My experience is mostly related
to my gender, and although peo
ple's voices are silenced on campus
for a variety of reasons, I can only
share my personal experiences. It
doesn't happen through people
telling me that I'm a stupid girl with
nothing useful to say; instead, I've
been told that my opinions are not
as welcome with subtle messages
sent through social pressures, com
pounded experiences and societal
expectations.

I've been in numerous classes in
which, during group presentations,
the men overrun the presentations

and, when taking questions after
wards, the guys in the group always
seem to have something to say in re
sponse. I become drowned out in
their rush to answer and can't get a
word in.

When people raise their hand
and talk in lecture, they are judged.
Because of this, I don't often speak
up in class (nobody likes being
judged, but women are taught to
place a higher premium on likabili
ty). So unless I'm aware that lots of
other people also share my ques
tion, I'm not that likely to raise my
hand and ask it. Instead, I go talk to
the teacher after class.
At lunchtime conversations with
members of my dorm, I've often
had the ideas that I bring up vehe
mently argued down. I don't like ar
guing (and women are censured
when they are aggressive), so I
would much rather give up to avoid
an argument than stick it out to con
vince everyone that I am right.
I've been in groups where I
make a suggestion for how to pro
ceed and it flies by under the radar.
A few minutes later a guy will make

the same suggestion and the group
will take it up and begin discussing
it. This is not an experience that is
unique to me; sociology papers
have been written on this phenome
non.

So yes, in a very literal sense, no
one is silencing me because I am the
one choosing to keep quiet: I am
being passive when I could be as
sertive, I am deferring to others and
I am neglecting to speak up. How
ever, I am not making this choice in
a vacuum. I am penalized

judged, looked down upon, talked
about and ignored when I speak
too loudly or monopolize conversa
tions, fight for my place and my
voice to be heard.
So what do we do about this?

I've been following much of the
news about the Occupy Wall Street
movement. One of the things that
I've found most intriguing is the
participants' use of an idea called
the "progressive stack." When peo
ple have opinions to voice, they get
in line (the "stack") and wait to talk.
However, in a progressive stack,
people do not speak in a first-come,

first-served basis; people get to
speak in an order that amplifies the
voices of traditionally marginalized
populations. Women and minorities
are moved to the front and men, es
pecially white men, are asked to
wait before they can speak.

This is an idea that Stanford
could use a little more of. There are
lots of events and organizations in
which encouraging members of
marginalized populations to speak
up more would add to the ability of
the organization to serve all of its
members. In terms of our daily in
teractions and lives, this cannot be
literally implemented, but it is still a
valuable concept to keep in mind.
By trying to "progressively stack"
our daily interactions and directing
our attention to members of mar
ginalized populations more often,
maybe we can find ways to listen
better to those being ignored.
