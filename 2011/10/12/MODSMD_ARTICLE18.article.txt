## No. 1 CARD TAKES THIRD AT THE PRESTIGE 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
La Quinta, Calif, was buzzing Tuesday as The
Prestige at PGA West went down to the wire,
and the anticipated showdown between No. 1
Stanford and No. 2 Oregon heated up in the
final round. After trailing by ten strokes going
into the final round, the men's golf team
found itself just three strokes back of the Ducks for the
team title on the back nine. The Cardinal couldn't quite
complete the comeback, but still managed to gain some
ground and finish in third place behind Washington in a
solid field at just the second event of the season.
Freshman Patrick Rodgers built on his first-place fin
ish at the Illini Invitational with a three-round total 209,
a good enough score to place him in a tie for 10th. De
fending champion Andrew Yun slipped a little in the
final round but still finished in a tie for 14th, partially
thanks to a first round 66 that had him thinking about re
peating on the Greg Norman course.
But the second round saw several of the Cardinal fall

off the pace a bit. Rodgers couldn't match his first-round
69, shooting an even-par 72, and Yun matched him with
a 72. Senior David Chung had six bogeys on his way to a
76, and only a spectacular round from sophomore
Cameron Wilson who shot a 67 with six birdies and
no bogeys during an 11-hole stretch kept the Cardi
nal from dropping beyond fourth place.
All that was forgotten on the final day, however, as
Stanford made a serious charge up the leaderboard.
Chung was firing on all cylinders, playing the first 16
holes in five-under par, while Rodgers, Wilson and jun
ior Steven Kearney were all in red figures at the turn.
With its lead all but evaporated, however, Oregon
showed why it will likely be the team to pose the biggest
challenge to Stanford in the Pac-12. Under pressure, the
Ducks responded, playing the back nine in six under par
as a team to salt away a two-shot victory over the
Huskies, eight shots clear of the Cardinal.
"I thought we played pretty well," coach Conrad
Ray told GoStanford.com. "Oregon has a really good
team this year as does Washington and it just wasn't

our week this week. We had some
bright spots it was nice to see
David Chung put up a good round
today, and Patrick Rodgers had an
other top-10."
That left out Yun, who had eight
birdies in the first round, as well as
freshman Marcel Puyat, who com
peted as an individual and finished
in a tie for 17th after shooting a five
under 211. Puyat struggled to avoid
big mistakes all tournament, mak
ing three double bogeys, but was a
birdie machine making fourteen
over the three rounds.

It was tough to top Washington's
Cheng-Tsung Pan, who pretty much
single-handedly led the Huskies'
final-day charge, particularly on the
back nine, when he made three
birdies and an eagle on the way to a
65 and the individual title at 15-

under par.
But it's hard to be truly disap
pointed with a top-three finish, and
Stanford will be able to fall back on
great depth when Pac-12 play ar
rives in the spring. The Cardinal
continues the fall schedule when it
takes to the course in two weeks at
The Isleworth Collegiate Invita
tional, played in Windermere, Fla.
