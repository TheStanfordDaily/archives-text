## No. 1 CARD TAKES THIRD AT THE PRESTIGE 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
La Quinta, Calif, was buzzing Tuesday as The
Prestige at PGA West went down to the wire,
and the anticipated showdown between No. 1
Stanford and No. 2 Oregon heated up in the
final round. After trailing by ten strokes going
into the final round, the men's golf team
found itself just three strokes back of the Ducks for the
team title on the back nine. The Cardinal couldn't quite
complete the comeback, but still managed to gain some
ground and finish in third place behind Washington in a
solid field at just the second event of the season.
Freshman Patrick Rodgers built on his first-place fin
ish at the Illini Invitational with a three-round total 209,
a good enough score to place him in a tie for 10th. De

final round but still finished in a tie for 14th, partially
thanks to a first round 66 that had him thinking about re

But the second round saw several of the Cardinal fall

off the pace a bit. Rodgers couldn't match his first-round
69, shooting an even-par 72, and Yun matched him with
a 72. Senior David Chung had six bogeys on his way to a
76, and only a spectacular round from sophomore
Cameron Wilson who shot a 67 with six birdies and
no bogeys during an 11-hole stretch kept the Cardi
nal from dropping beyond fourth place.
All that was forgotten on the final day, however, as
Stanford made a serious charge up the leaderboard.
Chung was firing on all cylinders, playing the first 16
holes in five-under par, while Rodgers, Wilson and jun
ior Steven Kearney were all in red figures at the turn.
With its lead all but evaporated, however, Oregon
showed why it will likely be the team to pose the biggest
challenge to Stanford in the Pac-12. Under pressure, the
Ducks responded, playing the back nine in six under par
as a team to salt away a two-shot victory over the
Huskies, eight shots clear of the Cardinal.
"I thought we played pretty well," coach Conrad
Ray told GoStanford.com. "Oregon has a really good
team this year as does Washington and it just wasn't
