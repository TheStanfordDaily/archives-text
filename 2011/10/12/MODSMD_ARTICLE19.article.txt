# GRIT ON THE GRIDIRON
## New coach, same hard-nosed approach 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Late in last Saturday's game against Colorado, the
Stanford football team led 27-7 and faced a fourth down
on the Buffaloes' 13-yard line.
Instead of kicking a field goal to extend the already
comfortable lead, head coach David Shaw called for the
offense to stay on the field. After junior running back
Stepfan Taylor rushed over the left guard for three yards
to extend the drive, quarterback Andrew Luck tossed an
easy touchdown pass to junior fullback Ryan Hewitt to
make the lead 34-7.
The very next Cardinal drive, Stanford faced a fourth
and goal at the one-yard line. Again, instead of taking
the points, Shaw called for his running back to go over
the left guard, and again, the Cardinal scored a touch
down.
After the game, Shaw insisted that the fourth down
calls weren't piling on the opponent, but they were in
deed trying to send a message to his own team.
"Attitude. That's our attitude. If it's close, with the
line that we have, with the fullbacks that we have, with
the tight ends we have, with the backs that we have, we
should pick up anything that's less than fourth and
three," Shaw said. "That's the kind of mentality we need
to have up front in order for us to play the games the way
we want to play them."
With those two calls, the first-year head coach ap
peared to answer one of the biggest questions that Stan
ford faced coming into the 2011 season: would the
team's tough attitude stay the same as it had been under
former coach Jim Harbaugh? The answer is yes.
"[Coming into the season] this team, we were defi
nitely trying to reinvent ourselves. Obviously coach
Harbaugh's gone, we're under coach Shaw, everybody's
trying to see what type of team it's going to be. And we

still have that competitive edge, we still have that com
petitive attitude," senior safety Michael Thomas said.
"We wanted to reinvent ourselves like this is our brand
of football, this isn't just Jim Harbaugh's brand of foot
ball, this is Stanford football."
In other words, Harbaugh himself might be gone, but
his favorite catchphrase "We're going to win with

Redshirt senior tight end Coby Fleener, who finished with
41 receiving yards in Stanford's 48-7 rout of Colorado last
Saturday, is just one of the Card's relentless weapons.
