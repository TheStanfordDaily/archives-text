# GRIT ON THE GRIDIRON
## New coach, same hard-nosed approach 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Late in last Saturday's game against Colorado, the
Stanford football team led 27-7 and faced a fourth down
on the Buffaloes' 13-yard line.
Instead of kicking a field goal to extend the already
comfortable lead, head coach David Shaw called for the
offense to stay on the field. After junior running back
Stepfan Taylor rushed over the left guard for three yards
to extend the drive, quarterback Andrew Luck tossed an
easy touchdown pass to junior fullback Ryan Hewitt to
make the lead 34-7.
The very next Cardinal drive, Stanford faced a fourth
and goal at the one-yard line. Again, instead of taking
the points, Shaw called for his running back to go over
the left guard, and again, the Cardinal scored a touch
down.
After the game, Shaw insisted that the fourth down
calls weren't piling on the opponent, but they were in
deed trying to send a message to his own team.
"Attitude. That's our attitude. If it's close, with the
line that we have, with the fullbacks that we have, with
the tight ends we have, with the backs that we have, we
should pick up anything that's less than fourth and
three," Shaw said. "That's the kind of mentality we need
to have up front in order for us to play the games the way
we want to play them."
With those two calls, the first-year head coach ap
peared to answer one of the biggest questions that Stan
ford faced coming into the 2011 season: would the
team's tough attitude stay the same as it had been under
former coach Jim Harbaugh? The answer is yes.
"[Coming into the season] this team, we were defi
nitely trying to reinvent ourselves. Obviously coach
Harbaugh's gone, we're under coach Shaw, everybody's
trying to see what type of team it's going to be. And we

still have that competitive edge, we still have that com
petitive attitude," senior safety Michael Thomas said.
"We wanted to reinvent ourselves like this is our brand
of football, this isn't just Jim Harbaugh's brand of foot
ball, this is Stanford football."
In other words, Harbaugh himself might be gone, but
his favorite catchphrase "We're going to win with

Redshirt senior tight end Coby Fleener, who finished with
41 receiving yards in Stanford's 48-7 rout of Colorado last
Saturday, is just one of the Card's relentless weapons.
character but we're also going to
win with cruelty" still resonates.
Shaw, whose coaching career in
cludes stops with the Oakland
Raiders and Baltimore Ravens
two teams known for their distinc
tive, tough attitudes said that it
was much more than just the coach
ing staff manufacturing an image.
"The two most important things
to have are the expectations for how
tough and physical you're going to
be coach Harbaugh did that
and then you recruit guys that exem
plify it," Shaw said. "You can't
preach it as a coach if you don't have
guys that have it. You can't just make
it happen, you have to have guys on
the team that make it happen."
"Guys that are tough-minded
like Andrew Luck, David DeCas
tro, Michael Thomas, Chase
Thomas, Delano Howell, those
guys exemplify that every day, so
now when you bring a young guy in,
you hear it from the coaches but
you also hear it from the older play
ers, and that's what the culture is,"
he added.

Of course, that brash attitude
can bring some backlash, like Har
baugh's famous (or infamous) deci
sion to go for two when leading by
27 points against USC back in 2009,
or the pregame tension that flared
into fisticuffs during last year's
game against Cal.
Despite the occasional distrac
tion or penalty (the Cardinal was

flagged for personal fouls three
times last week), Thomas says the
team is constantly emphasizing not
to let its emotions get out of con
trol.

"We say all the time, 'Don't get
emotionally hijacked.' We play off
each others' high energy but at the
same time, we don't want to put our
teammates in a bad situation," he
said. "What happened at the Cal
game last year was unfortunate, it's
a rivalry, it's a big game, and it real
ly did get the blood pumping, but
we don't want to do anything to
jeopardize our teammates."

Thomas also said that he and the
defense had adopted a catchphrase
of their own this season "oppor
tunity for greatness."
"That is something that started
last year with [former defensive co
ordinator Vic] Fangio and [defen
sive coordinator] Derek Mason,
whenever we get a sudden change,
it's saying opportunity is knocking
instead of 'oh shoot, a momentum
change,"' he said.
Despite one of his stars adopting
the phrase, Shaw insists that it's just
unofficial, unlike the "cruelty with
character" slogan.
"No, no, I loved that one, but we
haven't come up with any other
mantras," he said. "We've just been
concentrating on the process on
what it takes for us to be a good
team."

The Cardinal will get a chance to
put its toughness on the line once
again this weekend against Wash
ington State in Pullman, Wash.
