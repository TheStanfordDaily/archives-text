## DIR fails in Senate vote Tues. night 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The Division of Internal Review
(DIR) faced a major setback at the
Undergraduate Senate meeting
Tuesday night; a bill to establish the
group also failed after more than an
hour of debate.

The DIR, a brainchild of ASSU
Executive Michael Cruz 'l2, is in
tended to evaluate ASSU Execu
tive and Senate initiatives, as well as
monitor how the groups which re
ceive ASSU spending use that
money. The bill failed to pass the
Senate due to a controversial confi
dentiality clause, as well as dis
agreements over the scope and lan
guage of the bill.

Major problems within the bill
were that it contained vague lan
guage about the scope of the
DIR, as well as a clause that al
lowed it to keep certain informa
tion confidential, which is prohib
ited by the ASSU constitution
and bylaws.

Senator Alon Elhanan 'l4 ar
gued this point and questioned why
the bill had such a clause at all.
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 also ar
gued that the scope of the DIR was
poorly defined. In a tense exchange,
Laufer and bill author Appropria
tions Chair Brianna Pang 'l3 en
gaged in a back-and-forth over
whether Laufer agreed with the in
tention of the DIR, and then over
what specific issues he took with the
bill.

Acting Senate Chair Dan Ash
ton 'l4 sought to curb discussion
after an hour; however, arguments
persisted for another 30 minutes as
the Senate was unable to agree on
DlR's role and the specific lan
guage of the bill.

After the Senate took a 10-
minute recess to make adjustments,
a modified bill was then discussed.
The new wording of the bill
changed the DIR from a one-year
program to a one-quarter pilot pro
gram. However, this final bill failed
a vote, nine for and five against.

The bill was then tabled for fur
ther discussion and voting next
week.

Bill author Pang 'l3 said in an in
terview after the meeting that the
confidentiality clause was included
to prevent disclosure of financial in
formation that would be sensitive,
such as credit card information or
account numbers.

However as the bill is currently
written, the DIR has access to all
documents that any student would
have, which is all ASSU documents
that don't contain sensitive finan
cial information. The bill doesn't
allow the DIR to view documents
that any other student would not
have the ability to view.
