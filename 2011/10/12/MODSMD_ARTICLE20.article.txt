# NBA lockout: #thissucks
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith 
Steph Curry successfully
summed up Monday's
news that the first two
weeks of the 2011-12 NBA
regular season had been
canceled in one simple tweet
"#thissucks."

While many of my friends here on
campus saw commissioner David
Stern's statement scrawl across the
bottom of ESPN's news feed and
shrugged their shoulders indifferent
ly, I don't think that they realize the
implications this has for the NBA's im
mediate future.

For starters, don't think for a sec
ond that only two weeks' worth of
games will be canceled. The owners
and players clearly are not on the
same page, despite llth-hour meet
ings attempting to come to a consen
sus over a new collective bargaining
agreement and end the current lock
out.

"We gave it a real good run and it
didn't work," Stern said of the negoti
ations on Monday.
Derek Fisher, Los Angeles Lakers
point guard and president of the Na
tional Basketball Players Association
(NBPA), added to the conversation.
"Today was not the day to get this
done," he said.
Those two statements alone ought
to be enough to scare all you profes
sional basketball fans out there
straight, because when two of the
most important players at the bar
gaining table are giving excuses for
not coming to an agreement without
mentioning specifics and involving
certain days being worse than others,
the sides are likely very far apart.
NBPA executive director Billy
Hunter was likely playing some
strategic tactic, as any of those in
volved in the nitty-gritty details al
ways are, but his statement that there
has not been a discussion about the
next time the two sides will meet was
rather ominous.

"There has been no discussion
about next meetings. Maybe a month.
Two months," he said. "Your guess is
as good as mine."
But it might not matter what date
anyone has in mind to resume negoti
ations. As the lockout drags on and on,
I don't see how the owners will be mo
tivated to try and salvage the season if
they aren't coming out on top.
According to NBA Deputy Com
missioner Adam Silver, 22 of 30 NBA
teams lost money last year.That came
out to $3OO million total some $4O
million less than the previous year,but
still a staggering amount. And while
some creative number-crunching is
definitely going on in the owners'
camp (most experts agree that it's
more likely that closer to half the
teams actually failed to turn a profit
last season), there is no getting around
the fact that the old bargaining agree
ment gave 57 percent of all Basketball
Related Income to the players. That is
the sticking point, before you even get
into hard caps, soft caps, rookie scales,
guaranteed deals or anything else
if the owners don't end up with a
much bigger slice of the pie, they won't
hesitate to let the season go up in
flames.

And why shouldn't they? The
players have truly been getting away
with murder by current professional
league standards.
Look around; baseball and foot
ball are cash cows the NFL
brought in more than a billion in prof
its (before taxes) in 2009, and the
MLB about $5OO million in 2010. The

players, though, are receiving less
than 50 percent of the income. In
order for the NBA to catch up to ei
ther of those leagues would require
the players to take a step back and re
alize that they can make more overall
money in the future. If they agree to a
slightly smaller share of the profits,
the owners can reinvest, and the
league can try and get back to the
days when MJ, the Mailman, Larry
Bird and Magic had fans tuning out
football to watch basketball.
But most importantly, remember
that professional basketball is not the
most popular sport today. The public
already thinks the regular season
drags on way too long, and many
weighed in saying that they were glad
to do away with some of the early
games. And while people were suffer
ing from football withdrawal in July
and August, the same can't be said for
basketball. So it will take a lot longer
for the league to return to the same
energy and buzz that an epic NBA Fi
nals showdown generated, when Dirk
single-handedly slayed the Big Three.
I'm not sure what the public can
really do to rally the troops and save
the season, but as a fan of the game,
I'm really hoping that both sides get
their acts together so that we aren't

talking about how much we miss the
NBA in January, when it's too late to
see any of the stars take the court,
ttthissucks.

After the Red Sox's epic collapse,
Miles really needs this NBA season.

Don't think for
a second that
only two
weeks' worth
of games
will be
canceled.
