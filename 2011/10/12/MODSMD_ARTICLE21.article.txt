# RATCLIFFE REFLECTS
## COACH REACHES 200 CAREER WINS 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
When a soccer coach wins three
straight NSCAA Pacific Region
Coach of the Year awards, grooms
two Hermann Trophy winners in as
many years, leads his team to consec
utive College Cup Finals and fails to
record a regular-season loss in 57
games well, you know there's
something seriously fishy going on.
Seriously.
"Two weeks ago, we were doing
headers," said senior midfielder
Kristy Zurmuhlen, "and [head
coach Paul Ratcliffe] told us that
the proper way to head the ball is
that you have to look like a salmon
in midair, and leave your feet. So it's
kind of a running joke with us now,
that every time someone goes up
for a header, we say, 'salmon.'"
Ratcliffe may not seem like the
vocal type; compared with visiting
coaches who, like him, are amplified
by cavernous echoes off the ex
panded Cagan Stadium bleachers,
he's rarely audible. But when the
coach and the comic in him come
together for his players to hear, it
truly sticks.
"He's quiet, but he definitely has
a sense of humor, and we all get
along really well, so it's been great,"
Zurmuhlen said. "Over the years,
I've learned a lot from him in terms
of the type of soccer that he wants
us to play, keeping the ball and
working hard. I feel like I've gained
a lot of knowledge in terms of the
right way to play the game."
Teaching the "right way" to play
soccer has earned Ratcliffe a 201-
69-26 record as a head coach, with
146 of those wins coming on the
Farm. His teams have not had a los
ing season in conference play or
otherwise since his first year in
charge of the St. Mary's program.
How fitting for wins 200 and 201
to come against perhaps the biggest
rivals of two different eras for Rat
cliffe: USC, his archrival as a stu
dent-athlete, and UCLA, consis
tently Stanford's toughest Pac-12
competitor. Last Friday's dominant
3-0 performance by the Cardinal
against the Trojans got Ratcliffe to
the 200-win plateau, and with a
shocking rout of the Bruins two
days later, the team moved into ex
cellent position to capture its third

conference title in a row. But its
head coach is quick to deflect the
credit.
"If I get to that 200th win, I owe
them to all the players," Ratcliffe
said leading up to the USC game.
"They're the ones that make things
happen.
"I think I'm very fortunate to be
here and get the opportunity to
coach such fantastic players, and the
thing I'm most proud of is that we're
attracting the best players in the
country right now," he added. "And
not only soccer players, but great
students as well."
Ratcliffe first made his mark on
the soccer world as a student himself,
playing for the 1990 NCAA champi
on men's soccer team at UCLA. He
continued as a graduate assistant
with the men's team there, and after
a brief stint playing professional in

door soccer, Ratcliffe returned to
Westwood as an assistant coach for
the fledgling women's squad.
When then-head-coach Joy Faw
cett retired, Ratcliffe took over the
program, but was offered the St.
Mary's job that same offseason. He
never had the chance to coach a
game for his alma mater, instead
turning the struggling Gaels into a
squad that would average 11 wins a
season over his five years at St.
Mary's.

Stanford hired Ratcliffe in 2003,
and eight years later, he has not yet
failed to take a Cardinal team to the
postseason. That's where, according
to Ratcliffe, the biggest memories
have been born.

"The first game where we won in
the quarterfinal to go to the 2008
Final Four our first Final Four

was always a memorable game," he
said. "Ultimately there are so many
great memories: so many great
games and goals, the kids that have
come through here and the person
alities that we've had."

The only thing missing from Rat
cliffe's head coaching repertoire
and, for that matter, the Stanford
program's is clear: an NCAA
title. Yet that's not the only thing
Ratcliffe is working for on a day-to
day basis.
"I just want [the players] to play
to the best of their ability, enjoy the
games, enjoy the practices and work
very hard," he said. "But there's got
to be a huge enjoyment factor there,
and we've got to compete. We've
got to compete and represent Stan
ford. It's an amazing university, and
I feel like Stanford deserves the
best, and we're trying to produce
the best results for them possible."
