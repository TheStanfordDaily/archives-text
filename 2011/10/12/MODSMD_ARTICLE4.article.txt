### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Union Underground a combination of a free
used-clothing store and a student art gallery, located
in the basement of Old Union reopened last Fri
day after a three-and-a-half-week trial period at the
end of last spring quarter.
The project is the result of collaboration between
multiple sustainability-focused groups on campus,
including Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS)
and the Green Living Council (GLC). The project

recently formed a partnership with the ASSU under
neath the Chair of Sustainability, Sarthak Misra 'l3.
Co-founders Nicole Gaejtens 'l2 and Nicole
Greenspan 'l2, members of SSS and GLC respec
tively, first developed the idea for the space when
they took an Alternative Spring Break class togeth
er about social entrepreneurship.
"We had to develop a plan for a social enterprise,
and we were thinking about a thrift store,"
Greenspan said.
