# STUDENT LIFE
## Union Underground reopens after last spring's trial run 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Union Underground a combination of a free
used-clothing store and a student art gallery, located
in the basement of Old Union reopened last Fri
day after a three-and-a-half-week trial period at the
end of last spring quarter.
The project is the result of collaboration between
multiple sustainability-focused groups on campus,
including Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS)
and the Green Living Council (GLC). The project

recently formed a partnership with the ASSU under
neath the Chair of Sustainability, Sarthak Misra 'l3.
Co-founders Nicole Gaejtens 'l2 and Nicole
Greenspan 'l2, members of SSS and GLC respec
tively, first developed the idea for the space when
they took an Alternative Spring Break class togeth
er about social entrepreneurship.
"We had to develop a plan for a social enterprise,
and we were thinking about a thrift store,"
Greenspan said.

Arun Kulshreshtha '15 browsed the student art gallery section of Union Underground, which reopened
last Friday in the basement of Old Union. It was previously opened last spring quarter for a trial period.
After the class ended, they started
talking to ASSU officials about their
idea, and discovered several other
Stanford students had expressed sim
ilar interests in establishing a thrift
store on-campus, including Shaan
Chugh 'l4. According to Chugh, for
mer ASSU President Angelina Car
dona 'll informed him about the
project.

"We [Chugh, Greenspan and
Gaejtens] randomly had this one
meeting in Old Union and were kind
of shocked that we had the same
idea," Chugh said.
According to Gaetjens, the
biggest hurdle the group faced was
finding space on campus that would
accommodate the thrift store a
search that began back in February.
They considered placing the store in
Tresidder Memorial Union, but dis
covered they would have to pay rent
for the space.
After talking to the managers of
comparable on-campus thrift stores
at colleges like UC-Berkeley and
Clark University, they realized it
would probably take a year before
the project broke even, Greenspan
said.

Cardona then suggested the base
ment of Old Union as a possible
space and put Gaetjens and
Greenspan in touch with Jeanette
Smith-Laws, director of operations
and student unions. But Gaetjens
said that instead of requesting a per
manent space, they asked for a trial

period.
"The trial period was basically,
'Give us a chance to prove that we
deserve a space,"' Gaetjens said. "The
idea was ... that [University offi
cials] would have the right to take the
space away from us if we didn't do a
good job."
Gaetjens and Greenspan said
they emailed several campus email
ing lists to ask for student artists to
donate or lend their works for the
gallery. They obtained items for the
thrift store primarily through the stu
dent organization Stanford Nourish
and from students who were going
abroad for the quarter.
They said they received approval
from Smith-Laws to use the space a
week before their planned opening
date last spring.
"We were like, 'We are going to
take this opportunity and do it,"'
Greenspan said.
Chugh said they made a large
marketing push for the opening last
spring in hopes of gaining traction
among students for the project. Ac
cording to Gaetjens, more than 300
students came to the store on open
ing day, and 233 individuals checked
out at least one item from the store
during its trial period. Both of the co
founders said the feedback was
strong enough that they were able to
keep the space.
The plan, however, departed
slightly from the organizers' original
intention. They said they had initially
planned to monetize the store by sell
ing the used items. Customers are
now able to take items from the store
for free and are allowed a maximum
of three items per visit.
According to Greenspan, the
change came because of zoning laws

that prohibit financial transactions
from taking place in all areas of Old
Union except The Axe and Palm.
"Honestly, the way that it has
evolved, the free-store model has
been working really well, which we
are glad about," Gaetjens said. "We
had been really afraid of [not charg
ing for items] in terms of basically
creating chaos. But with the item
limit and people being really respon
sive and donating, it has actually been
working out really well."
Over the summer, a $3,000 grant
coming from the Green Fund a

pool of $30,000 that is divided out
among student-driven sustainability
projects on campus by the Depart
ment of Sustainability and Energy
Management (SEM) was used to
purchase an iPad and a scale. The
iPad is now used as a store inventory
and as a tool for checking out items.
The scale weighs donations.
According to Gaetjens, they plan
to use these measurements to create
a visual "thermometer" of how much
waste the store is diverting from land
fills.

The project recently formed a
team of 10 volunteers who will be
come part owners of the space, and
graduating seniors made donations
last spring. Greenspan said that
Smith-Laws painted the walls of the
art gallery over the summer to make
it more inviting.

Attendance at the reopening on
Friday trailed that of the opening last
spring. Gaetjens estimates approxi
mately 100 individuals attended the
reopening, and 80 took items. Chugh
said this was probably because the
group chose not to market the event
as strongly as they did in the spring.
"This time, we knew it was going
to be a store, and it's going to be here
for weeks to come," Chugh said. "It
didn't make sense [to strongly publi
cize the reopening] because then
people get the wrong impression that
it's an event."

Both of the co-founders said they
hope to expand the store, so they can
accept larger donations like couches,
mini-fridges and televisions, which
they are currently not able to keep in
the room because of space limita
tions. They also said they hope to be
come a permanent fixture on the
campus.

"We have no guarantee that we
won't get kicked out of the space,"
Gaetjens said. "We also have no indi
cation ... that we are getting thrown
out."

"The more student support that is
voiced to the administration, the bet
ter," she added.
Union Underground is open 12
p.m. through 2 a.m., every week from
Friday to Sunday.
