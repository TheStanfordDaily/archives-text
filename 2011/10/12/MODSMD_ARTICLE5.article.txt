## PG&E begins testing pipelines on Stanford property 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF – Kurt Chirbas 
PG&E began testing line 132 one
of two mile-long gas pipelines running
underneath Stanford property —on
Tuesday, according to a University state
ment. During the test, PG&E will vent
all gas from the pipeline segment and fill
it up with water at a specified pressure
higher than what the pipe normally ac
commodates. Any sections of the
pipe that do not meet acceptable
safety standards during these test
conditions will be replaced with new
pipe that has already passed a pres
sure test, according to the PG&E
website.

Line 132 runs from Milpitas to San
Francisco and crosses Stanford prop
erty when it follows Page Mill Road,
Junipero Serra Boulevard, a corner
of the golf course and Sand Hill Road
to reach F2BO. Stanford PG&E cus
tomers who might be affected by the
test were sent a letter by the utilities
company.

"You may smell gas during this
process and at other points during
testing work," the letter stated. "This
is safe and expected."
"In addition to the natural gas

odor, you may hear noise associated
with testing activities and see PG&E
field teams in your neighborhood,"
the letter said. "Our crew may use
traffic safety cones and/or detour
signs, testing equipment such as
above-ground pipes and valves or
machinery such as excavators or
water tanks."
California state regulators re
quired PG&E to perform this pres
sure testing on all sections of pipeline
that have no documented test results
following the 2010 San Bruno gas
pipeline explosion that resulted in 38
destroyed homes and eight deaths.
According to investigators, the inci
dent resulted from an electrical glitch
in a Milpitas gas-line terminal that
raised the line's gas pressure.
PG&E is also working on rebuild
ing a pipeline crossing at San Francis
quito Creek. Recent rains have de
layed the scheduled completion date
by two weeks.
