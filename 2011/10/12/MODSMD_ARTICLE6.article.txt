# CCNY venture starts
## Stanford plans a joint program RESEARCH 
### IVY NGUYEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford University, the City Uni
versity of New York (CUNY) and City
College of New York (CCNY) an
nounced Tuesday morning the creation
of "Stanford@CCNY," a joint venture
serving as an East Coast test site for
Stanford's undergraduate program in
entrepreneurship, technology and re
lated areas.

More commonly known as City Col
lege, a senior college within the CUNY
school system, CCNY's partnership with
Stanford is part of the University's re
sponse to city Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's call for a top-quality engi
neering and applied sciences campus in
New York City.

The conversation exploring the possi
bility of collaboration with CCNY began
in July when New York City issued its re
quest for proposal (RFP) for an applied
sciences campus, according to University
spokeswoman Lisa Lapin in an email to
The Daily. School of Engineering Dean
Jim Plummer and University President
John Hennessy visited CCNY last
month to further explore the possibility
of a partnership, Lapin said.
Lapin added that CCNY will not be
partnering with the University in its pro
posal to build a campus on Roosevelt Is
land.

While this collaboration with
CCNY is the first NYC-based partner
ship that the University has announced
since it declared an interest in submit
ting a proposal to build the applied sci
ences campus, Lapin said that the pos
sibility of partnering with other institu
tions remains open.

"We have had many conversations
with potential partners, and those
conversations continue; so we do
not rule out that we might have ad
ditional collaborations with other
institutions," Lapin said.
The CUNY partnership is sepa
rate from the University's propos
al to build a graduate applied sci
ence campus on Roosevelt Island
of New York City. The University,
which proposes to expand the
campus to eventually accommo
date 100 faculty and 2,000 stu
dents, will submit an official pro
posal to the New York City Eco
nomic Development Corporation
by Oct. 28. The city will make a de
cision by the end of the calendar
year.

Though the collaboration began
in response to the applied sciences
campus RFP, Lapin said that the fu
ture of the Stanford@CCNY part
nership remains independent of
Stanford's bid.

"The undergraduate curriculum
will start right away, and we antici
pate it will be a longstanding collab
oration, regardless of the success of
our applied sciences bid," Lapin
said. "We would look forward to a
long and fruitful association with
CCNY and CUNY."

Should Stanford's proposal for a
New York campus be accepted,
Stanford@CCNY will offer joint
BA/MA and BS/MS programs cre
ated by faculty from both schools.
Some CCNY students will be able
to pursue a co-terminal MS degree
from Stanford along with their BS
degree from CCNY.

Stanford would offer its academ
ic program at CCNY until late 2016,
when the proposed New York cam
pus would be completed. Stanford
would renovate and temporarily
use up to 20,000 square feet of class
room space at CCNY and space for

up to 20 Stanford faculty.
After this point, CUNY and
CCNY would retain permanent
use of the renovated facilities. Pres
ident Hennessy has not yet com
mented on what would happen
should another school be awarded
the right to build the applied sci
ences campus.
The total cost this venture would
incur to Stanford has yet to be de
termined, but Lapin said that work
ing in CCNY space is "ideal" for the
two schools.
"There are costs and also sav
ings, and additional non-monetary
benefits to both Stanford and
CCNY," she said. "If we were to rent
and configure temporary space any
where in the vicinity of Manhattan,
there would be a cost."

Under this collaboration, the
University will also host CCNY stu
dents each summer in its Research
Experience for Undergraduates
Program. Another project, Stan
ford@CCNY's innovation pro
gram, is being funded by a five-year,
$lO million grant from the National
Science Program to Stanford's Tech
nology Venture Program, Lapin
said.

"We believe there is tremen
dous potential through our part
nership with CUNY to bring Stan
ford's curriculum to some of the
best and brightest students in New
York and to help them go on to
make significant economic contri
butions to New York City and New
York State," Hennessy told the
Stanford Report.
City College is located in
Harlem on the island of Manhattan
and has a 35-acre campus spanning
11 blocks from 130 th Street to 141 st
Street on Convent Avenue. It is the
oldest of CUNY's 23 colleges and
universities.
