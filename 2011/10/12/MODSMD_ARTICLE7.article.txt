# Report finds 'due process' violation
## 
### ILEANA NAJARRO 
The Stanford Law School Immigrants' Rights Clin
ic, the National Immigration Law Center and other im
migration rights advocacy groups collaborated on a re
port titled "Deportation without Due Process,"
which was published last September.
Jayashri Srikantiah, law professor and
director of the Stanford Immigrants'
Rights Clinic, said the report hoped to
draw attention to the federal
process of stipulated removal.
Through the stipulated re
moval program, which was initi
ated in the early 2000s, immi
grants held in detention
could sign off an order for
their own deportation
without a hearing with
an immigration judge
beforehand. According
to the report, these im
migrants are often either
unaware of what other
legal options they may have
or are not informed of the
order's true implications.
Srikantiah said the pro
gram was first revealed at a li
aison meeting three years ago.
"We had heard at one of the
informal meetings between ad
vocates and the immigration au
thorities that there would be a new
program that was being rolled out,"
Srikantiah said. "That's all we heard
that there would be a new pro
gram and it would be called 'stipu
lated removal.'"

According to Jennifer Koh, lead
author of the report and former
teaching fellow at the Law School,
the Immigrants' Rights Clinic then
decided to file a Freedom of Infor
mation Act request to obtain infor
mation about the program. Their
request was denied, prompting liti
gation drafted and run by members
of the Stanford clinic, including
Srikantiah.
"It's because of our work under
the Freedom of Information Act and
our litigation that we finally have a
lot of information about the pro
gram, and what we've learned is
very, very troubling," Srikantiah
said.

The Law School handled the liti
gation on behalf of the National Im
migration Law Center, the National
Lawyers Guild San Francisco Bay
Area Chapter and the ACLU of
Southern California. Eventually, the
suit resulted in more than 20,000
pages of records elaborating on the
program's implementation and re
vealed that over 100,000 immigrants
had already been subjected to it.The

report, available online on the Stan
ford Law School website, serves as a
synthesis of the acquired records.
"Now you have on the website
what is really the country's first
fully comprehensive examination
of the stipulated removal pro
gram," Koh said.
Koh said the report sheds light
on the constitutional issues that
arise from the stipulated removal
program, including how immi
grants' due process rights were
short-circuited because of how the
program was implemented.
According to the report, exam
ples of such short-circuiting include
poor quality of paperwork transla
tion, no proper explanation of what
rights immigrants forfeit by signing
the order and, most importantly, no
access to lawyers or legal support.
"The vast majority of immi
grants who are signing these orders
don't have lawyers, so they have no
idea that they might actually be
able to be released from detention
on bail," Koh said. "They may not
know that they're actually eligible
to fight their deportation and have
a chance to remain in the U.S. They
don't know this because they don't
have lawyers."
She said the stipulation removal
program adds another obstacle for

immigrants in detention.
"Under stipulated removal, a
person never has a chance to see the
immigration judge at all because
the idea is that you agree to your
own removal without having a
chance to go to court," Koh said.
Along with revealing the details
of the program, the reports also
provides recommendations on how
the federal government could
change the program's implementa
tion with no cost and under legal
terms. One such recommendation
includes having an immigration
judge hold a brief hearing in order
to determine if an immigrant fully
understands the legal conse
quences of the order before anyone
signs off on it.
According to Koh, the report
serves as a spotlight on a program
that been hidden from public
knowledge for over a decade,
"For all of us who are working in
the immigration advocacy field, our
work is motivated by a desire to see
greater overall fairness in the
process and to be able to see the
laws implemented in the way they
are supposed to be constitutionally
fulfilled," Koh said.
