### ILEANA NAJARRO 
The Stanford Law School Immigrants' Rights Clin
ic, the National Immigration Law Center and other im
migration rights advocacy groups collaborated on a re
port titled "Deportation without Due Process,"
which was published last September.
Jayashri Srikantiah, law professor and
director of the Stanford Immigrants'
Rights Clinic, said the report hoped to
draw attention to the federal
process of stipulated removal.
Through the stipulated re
moval program, which was initi
ated in the early 2000s, immi
grants held in detention
could sign off an order for
their own deportation
without a hearing with
an immigration judge
beforehand. According
to the report, these im
migrants are often either
unaware of what other
legal options they may have
or are not informed of the
order's true implications.
Srikantiah said the pro
gram was first revealed at a li
aison meeting three years ago.
"We had heard at one of the
informal meetings between ad
vocates and the immigration au
thorities that there would be a new
program that was being rolled out,"
Srikantiah said. "That's all we heard
that there would be a new pro
gram and it would be called 'stipu
lated removal.'"
