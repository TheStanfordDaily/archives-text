## PROFILE 'The things I will remember most' 
### OLIVIA SIMONE JEW 
Tucked away in a corner of Stan
ford's School of Medicine, Dr.
Abraham Verghese works most
days of the week. His office con
sists of the conventional staples: a
computer, stacks of papers and files, framed
certificates of academic degrees and a coat
stand in the corner where multiple white
coats - all with his name and title embroi
dered across the chest hang. His bookcas
es are filled not only with classic medical ref
erences, but also his own works, a testament
to his tremendous success as a physician
writer.
Verghese has written pieces for a wide va
riety of publications, including The New
Yorker, the New York Times and the Wall
Street Journal. He is a professor for the theo
ry and practice of medicine, internal medi
cine residency program director and senior
associate chair for the Department of Inter
nal Medicine. But two days of the week,
Verghese retreats to a separate office a se
cret location with someone else's name on
the door and without a landline to write.
But even with the appearance that he
leads two distinct professional lives, Vergh
ese identifies himself completely as a pri
mary care doctor.
"I don't really see [writing and medicine]
as two different professions," Verghese said.
"You listen to the patient's story or history
and what is a history but a story? and you
learn to match stories with your repertoire of
stories. When you do the physical, you're
looking at the body as though it's a text, and
you're trying to read the words of the text."
Verghese's work as a writer certainly sets
him apart from many other physicians. With a
master of fine arts degree in fiction from the
lowa Writers Workshop, Verghese's writing
spans from memoirs to editorials to novels.
His most recent published work, "Cutting for
Stone," has been on the New York Times
bestsellers list for 88 weeks in a row.
"It's like a dream sometimes when I think
about that," he said.
With Verghese's interests in the ritual of
the physical exam and establishing a trusting
relationship between patients and their
physicians, the School of Medicine recruited
him as a tenured professor in 2007. Accord
ing to Verghese, despite Stanford's patient

centered curriculum, many medical students
become disillusioned when they get to the
hospital ward.
"Typically, they have a great ability to
imagine the suffering of patients, a wonderful
humanity," he said. "The period of training
can greatly endanger that humanity ... un
less you're careful, the patient becomes al
most lost sight of in the hurry to learn about
the disease."
Verghese noted a shift in medical care
away from the patient toward a priority of ef
ficiency and greater dependency on technol
ogy, and he argued that a dysfunctional
healthcare system was the culprit.
"If you put in a needle or do something to
a person, you get reimbursed," Verghese said.
"If you spend 45 minutes with a geriatric pa
tient, which is how much time they need, you
will lose money and you'll go out of practice
because you can't pay the overhead."
According to Verghese, in the current
health-care system, physicians order many
often-unnecessary tests in the emergency
room for billing purposes rather than seeing
patients first and then ordering relevant tests.
He envisions a future process that is less ex
pensive and technology-dependent and
more individually based.
It's easy to see why patients immediately
feel at ease when talking to Verghese, who is
warm, serene and personable.
"Incredibly, they tell you things they'd
never tell their rabbi, or preacher, or temple
priest," Verghese said. "They disrobe and
allow touch, which in any other context
would be assault. Then they listen to your
suggestions and advice. In being able to influ
ence them in a positive direction, you really
need to understand who you are and how you
appear to other people."
Verghese became a physician by uncon
ventional means. Born in Ethiopia to Indian
parents, he grew up in a well-educated house
hold, with both parents as teachers. He was in
the middle of his medical training when civil
war broke out, leading him to leave Ethiopia
for the United States.
Verghese worked as a nighttime orderly in
a New Jersey hospital until he decided to re
turn to medical school and finish his training
in India. He completed his residency in John
son City, Tenn., right at the time when the
