# TREND MAJESTIC CATS OF JASPER RIDGE
## 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
Until late 2009, it had
never been seen. The
only clues of its exis
tence were fecal mat
ter, slain deer and
some paw prints discovered in
2005. Motion-activated cameras
set up in 2006 never snapped a
photograph of it. But in late 2008,
Trevor Hebert, Jasper Ridge geo
graphic information systems and
data manager, began an experi
ment, installing a new motion-acti
vated camera. Almost a year later,
a photograph finally surfaced. The
clues were confirmed. There was at
least one mountain lion roaming
Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve.
"It was amazing," Hebert said.
"I don't think anyone believed
that we would ever see one for
some reason, and we're still not
sure why we didn't see any moun
tain lions for those several years.

Everyone was quite amazed when
we saw that first picture."
The photos started to, in
Hebert's words, "trickle" in.
Through the winter and following
spring, occasional pictures of the
lion appeared on the cameras.
Then, at the end of May 2010, the
trickle intensified. Pictures flowed
into the Jasper Ridge database for
the rest of the summer. The stream
finally slowed at the end of the sea
son, although it never stopped.
In Sept. 2010, members of the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment's Rising Environmental
Leaders Network (RELN) took
on the project. Inspiration for the
network came from two sources.
First, the team was modeled on the
Leopold Leadership Program
(LLP), which brings together mid
career faculty from across North
America to put environmental re
search to public use.
The second inspiration for the
team came from a general recom

mendation made by the 2005 Stan
ford Commission on Graduate
Education, said LLP program
manager Margaret Krebs.
Jasper Ridge offered the inter
disciplinary team of five graduate
students and postdoctoral re
searchers three projects to pick
from, and the team picked the
mountain lion project. Team
member and mechanical engi
neering graduate student Lena
Perkins said an earlier encounter
with a mountain lion sparked her
interest.
"I saw a mountain lion 10 years
ago up in Desolation Wilderness,
and once you see them, I think
everybody's bitten by a little bit of
fascination," Perkins said.
According to the Jasper Ridge
website, the team was assigned to
answer how the risks from a moun
tain lion presence should be evalu
ated, managed and conveyed to

Woods Institute for the Environment is studying the presence of mountain lions and their impact on the local
ecosystem.
Jasper Ridge users; how the cam
era trap data on mountain lions
should be used and shared and
on what timeframe for scientif
ic, educational or management
purposes; and if there were unique
opportunities for Jasper Ridge to
contribute to research and com
munication on mountain lion ecol
ogy in ways that are consistent
with Stanford's research policies.
The team gathered information
by interviewing 15 experts in
"mountain lion ecology, risk as
sessment, graphic communication,
institutional liability, University
policy on research on wild animals
and regional conservation and co
ordination."

Perkins said the team synthe
sized this information, along with
additional material gathered from
study of United States Fish and
Wildlife policy and from corre
spondence with California Fish
and Game, UC-Santa Cruz re
searchers, Audubon California
Starr Ranch Sanctuary and Or
ange County Parks and Recre
ation, into a comprehensive re
port. They turned the report in for
revision in July 2011, and it was re
cently published online on the
Jasper Ridge website. A Stanford
news article quoted the report's
conclusion that "there are likely at
most only one male, one female
and possibly several cubs whose
territory includes the preserve."
Perkins said two important op
portunities that Jasper Ridge

could pursue involve lion scat ge
netic analysis, which could help re
searchers find out the exact num
ber of mountain lions in the area,
and radio collaring. Both UC-
Santa Cruz and a Bay Area non
profit organization are interested
in helping Stanford start a radio
collaring project.
Perkins added that the pres
ence of even a single mountain
lion has major consequences for
the Jasper Ridge ecosystem. By
limiting the size of the deer popu
lation, mountain lions prevent
deer from overgrazing, and the re
sulting increased number of plants
in the area curbs erosion, improv
ing the area's water quality.
"The impact of a single moun
tain lion as a keystone species re
ally shapes a lot of the topography
essentially, and therefore the high
er water quality and clarity means
generally healthier fish popula
tions," she said. "It has really far
reaching implications, and certain
ly Jasper Ridge is uniquely poised
to ... do something there."
Jasper Ridge Administrative
Director Philippe Cohen said the
preserve has already implemented
a few of the team's suggestions
and said the preserve will "likely
implement others" at some point.
In response to the report, a pre
serve protocol was created that re
stricts activities to daytime hours
"unless staff is informed and ap
proves of the activity."
"This also includes our requir
ing that nobody goes out alone at
night," Cohen said. "There must
always be at least two people pres
ent unless there are extenuating
circumstances and require my ex
plicit approval."

Jasper Ridge Research Coordi
nator Nona Chiariello added that
during the daytime, Jasper Ridge
has "implemented strong, routine
recommendations that users fol
low a buddy system, especially re
searchers who might be working
crouched down for extended peri
ods or might be in the field near
dawn and dusk."

In addition to this change, a
wildlife photo gallery was created
for the Jasper Ridge website, and
the preserve also changed the
wording of its waiver form.
"[The team] brought a fresh
perspective based on expertise in
other areas ranging from engi
neering to economics to marine
biology to soil science; they
thought hard, with open minds,
and researched the subject care
fully," Chiariello said.
While the investigation has
concluded, Hebert's cameras con
tinue to take pictures of the pre
serve's wildlife. Since receiving a
grant from the National Science
Foundation, Hebert has installed
more cameras there are now 16
still cameras and two video cam
eras.

While the lion has been discov
ered, another question remains:
how many lions are there? Hebert
believes all the pictures are of the
same lion, but he said it is difficult
to know for sure. The lion pho
tographed last year was smaller
and less muscular than the lion
that was photographed this year.
Has the same lion grown? Proba
bly. Could it be a different lion en
tirely? Possibly.

spondence with California Fish
and Game, UC-Santa Cruz re
searchers, Audubon California
Starr Ranch Sanctuary and Or
ange County Parks and Recre
ation, into a comprehensive re
port. They turned the report in for
revision in July 2011, and it was re
cently published online on the
Jasper Ridge website. A Stanford
news article quoted the report's
conclusion that "there are likely at
most only one male, one female
and possibly several cubs whose
territory includes the preserve."
Perkins said two important op
portunities that Jasper Ridge

could pursue involve lion scat ge
netic analysis, which could help re
searchers find out the exact num
ber of mountain lions in the area,
and radio collaring. Both UC-
Santa Cruz and a Bay Area non
profit organization are interested
in helping Stanford start a radio
collaring project.
Perkins added that the pres
ence of even a single mountain
lion has major consequences for
the Jasper Ridge ecosystem. By
limiting the size of the deer popu
lation, mountain lions prevent
deer from overgrazing, and the re
sulting increased number of plants
in the area curbs erosion, improv
ing the area's water quality.
"The impact of a single moun
tain lion as a keystone species re
ally shapes a lot of the topography
essentially, and therefore the high
er water quality and clarity means
generally healthier fish popula
tions," she said. "It has really far
reaching implications, and certain
ly Jasper Ridge is uniquely poised
to ... do something there."
Jasper Ridge Administrative
Director Philippe Cohen said the
preserve has already implemented
a few of the team's suggestions
and said the preserve will "likely
implement others" at some point.
In response to the report, a pre
serve protocol was created that re
stricts activities to daytime hours
"unless staff is informed and ap
proves of the activity."
"This also includes our requir
ing that nobody goes out alone at
night," Cohen said. "There must
always be at least two people pres
ent unless there are extenuating
circumstances and require my ex
plicit approval."

Jasper Ridge Research Coordi
nator Nona Chiariello added that
during the daytime, Jasper Ridge
has "implemented strong, routine
recommendations that users fol
low a buddy system, especially re
searchers who might be working
crouched down for extended peri
ods or might be in the field near
dawn and dusk."

In addition to this change, a
wildlife photo gallery was created
for the Jasper Ridge website, and
the preserve also changed the
wording of its waiver form.
"[The team] brought a fresh
perspective based on expertise in
other areas ranging from engi
neering to economics to marine
biology to soil science; they
thought hard, with open minds,
and researched the subject care
fully," Chiariello said.
While the investigation has
concluded, Hebert's cameras con
tinue to take pictures of the pre
serve's wildlife. Since receiving a
grant from the National Science
Foundation, Hebert has installed
more cameras there are now 16
still cameras and two video cam
eras.

While the lion has been discov
ered, another question remains:
how many lions are there? Hebert
believes all the pictures are of the
same lion, but he said it is difficult
to know for sure. The lion pho
tographed last year was smaller
and less muscular than the lion
that was photographed this year.
Has the same lion grown? Proba
bly. Could it be a different lion en
tirely? Possibly.

Until late 2009, it had
never been seen. The
only clues of its exis
tence were fecal mat
ter, slain deer and
some paw prints discovered in
2005. Motion-activated cameras
set up in 2006 never snapped a
photograph of it. But in late 2008,
Trevor Hebert, Jasper Ridge geo
graphic information systems and
data manager, began an experi
ment, installing a new motion-acti
vated camera. Almost a year later,
a photograph finally surfaced. The
clues were confirmed. There was at
least one mountain lion roaming
Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve.
"It was amazing," Hebert said.
"I don't think anyone believed
that we would ever see one for
some reason, and we're still not
sure why we didn't see any moun
tain lions for those several years.

Everyone was quite amazed when
we saw that first picture."
The photos started to, in
Hebert's words, "trickle" in.
Through the winter and following
spring, occasional pictures of the
lion appeared on the cameras.
Then, at the end of May 2010, the
trickle intensified. Pictures flowed
into the Jasper Ridge database for
the rest of the summer. The stream
finally slowed at the end of the sea
son, although it never stopped.
In Sept. 2010, members of the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment's Rising Environmental
Leaders Network (RELN) took
on the project. Inspiration for the
network came from two sources.
First, the team was modeled on the
Leopold Leadership Program
(LLP), which brings together mid
career faculty from across North
America to put environmental re
search to public use.
The second inspiration for the
team came from a general recom

mendation made by the 2005 Stan
ford Commission on Graduate
Education, said LLP program
manager Margaret Krebs.
Jasper Ridge offered the inter
disciplinary team of five graduate
students and postdoctoral re
searchers three projects to pick
from, and the team picked the
mountain lion project. Team
member and mechanical engi
neering graduate student Lena
Perkins said an earlier encounter
with a mountain lion sparked her
interest.
"I saw a mountain lion 10 years
ago up in Desolation Wilderness,
and once you see them, I think
everybody's bitten by a little bit of
fascination," Perkins said.
According to the Jasper Ridge
website, the team was assigned to
answer how the risks from a moun
tain lion presence should be evalu
ated, managed and conveyed to

Jasper Ridge users; how the cam

should be used and shared and
on what timeframe for scientif
ic, educational or management
purposes; and if there were unique
opportunities for Jasper Ridge to
contribute to research and com
munication on mountain lion ecol
ogy in ways that are consistent
with Stanford's research policies.
The team gathered information
by interviewing 15 experts in
"mountain lion ecology, risk as
sessment, graphic communication,
institutional liability, University
policy on research on wild animals
and regional conservation and co
ordination."

Perkins said the team synthe
sized this information, along with
additional material gathered from

Wildlife policy and from corre
