# TREND MAJESTIC CATS OF JASPER RIDGE

Until late 2009, it had
never been seen. The
only clues of its exis
tence were fecal mat
ter, slain deer and
some paw prints discovered in
2005. Motion-activated cameras
set up in 2006 never snapped a
photograph of it. But in late 2008,
Trevor Hebert, Jasper Ridge geo
graphic information systems and
data manager, began an experi
ment, installing a new motion-acti
vated camera. Almost a year later,
a photograph finally surfaced. The
clues were confirmed. There was at
least one mountain lion roaming
Stanford's Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve.
"It was amazing," Hebert said.
"I don't think anyone believed
that we would ever see one for
some reason, and we're still not
sure why we didn't see any moun
tain lions for those several years.

Everyone was quite amazed when
we saw that first picture."
The photos started to, in
Hebert's words, "trickle" in.
Through the winter and following
spring, occasional pictures of the
lion appeared on the cameras.
Then, at the end of May 2010, the
trickle intensified. Pictures flowed
into the Jasper Ridge database for
the rest of the summer. The stream
finally slowed at the end of the sea
son, although it never stopped.
In Sept. 2010, members of the
Woods Institute for the Environ
ment's Rising Environmental
Leaders Network (RELN) took
on the project. Inspiration for the
network came from two sources.
First, the team was modeled on the
Leopold Leadership Program
(LLP), which brings together mid
career faculty from across North
America to put environmental re
search to public use.
The second inspiration for the
team came from a general recom

mendation made by the 2005 Stan
ford Commission on Graduate
Education, said LLP program
manager Margaret Krebs.
Jasper Ridge offered the inter
disciplinary team of five graduate
students and postdoctoral re
searchers three projects to pick
from, and the team picked the
mountain lion project. Team
member and mechanical engi
neering graduate student Lena
Perkins said an earlier encounter
with a mountain lion sparked her
interest.
"I saw a mountain lion 10 years
ago up in Desolation Wilderness,
and once you see them, I think
everybody's bitten by a little bit of
fascination," Perkins said.
According to the Jasper Ridge
website, the team was assigned to
answer how the risks from a moun
tain lion presence should be evalu
ated, managed and conveyed to
