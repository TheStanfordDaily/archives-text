## OP-ED The
						Pinochet Standard? 
### STEPHAN SONNENBERG Clinical Lecturer, International Human Rights Conflict Resolution Clinic, Stanford Law School 
Over the weekend, I listened to
a radio retrospective mark
ing the 35th anniversary of
Orlando Letelier's assassination in
Washington, D.C. Letelier had been
a minister of the government of
elected socialist Salvador Allende
who later fled to the United States to
become a leader of the international
opposition movement to Pinochet.
Letelier and his American assistant,
Ronnie Moffitt, were killed by a car
bomb planted under their car on
Sept. 21,1976, allegedly by assassins
acting on the direct orders of former
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
How despicable so the commen
tary went that an abusive foreign
government would be so bold as to
track down one of its own nationals
to a foreign state and then collude
with paid killers to eliminate him.
How terribly ironic, then, to listen
to our own president barely a week
later praise the operation in which
U.S. authorities did exactly that:
track down U.S. national Anwar al-
Awlaki and collude with Yemeni se
curity forces to eliminate him in
Yemen. Ironic indeed, because Pres
ident Obama's praise was directed
not only at the American covert op
eratives involved in the attack but
also at the Yemeni government and
its security forces who had been
working closely with the United
States to carry out the mission.
Yes, those Yemeni security forces:
the same ones who also stand ac
cused of gross human rights viola
tions in their desperate efforts to
snuff out their own edition of the
"Arab Spring" protests working
their way across the region.
Just like Pinochet, Obama appar
ently believes it is permissible to
mark his own citizens for death once
he defines them as a threat to the na
tion. And just like Pinochet, he ap
parently has no trouble allying him
self with actors who openly flaunt

human rights in their quest for
power. Breaking with the analogy,
however, not even Pinochet had the
audacity to proudly claim credit for
his decision to order an assassina
tion. Not so with Obama, who seems
to take great pride in his use of
drones to kill al-Qaeda operatives
regardless of their citizenship.
Of course, historically, the U.S.
government saw things very differ
ently. In the case of Letelier and
Moffitt's assassination, the United
States insisted that amnesty not be
granted to those involved in the
killing, resulting in a 17-year process
to bring those responsible for the
crime to justice in a Chilean court
room.
For someone who started his
tenure as president of the United
States by accepting the Nobel Peace
Prize in Oslo, Obama has a surpris
ing comfort level with the tools of
tyrants: praising Yemen's security
forces while overlooking their mass
killing, using the law of war to justify
the killing of a U.S. citizen even
though we are not at war with
Yemen and denying American citi
zens their basic right to a fair trial
when accused of terrorism.
Of course, Obama and other gov
ernment officials routinely justify the
killing of Al-Awlaki and other al
Qaeda operatives by highlighting the
despicable and illegal acts that Al-
Awlaki and his followers allegedly
have committed. Pinochet, of course,
also justified the attack on Orlando
Letelier because of the former minis
ter's supposed ties to international
communism. Whatever the merits of
these claims, we must demand more of
democratic states and democratic
leaders than "The Pinochet Standard."
