# DO's AND DOO-DOO's
## How to be an amazing quitter 
### Chase Ishii 
Here it comes: that blast of ad
vice that's surely guaranteed
to brighten your Thursday.
DO: Be a quitter.
DOO-DOO:Try to do everything.
I've been working at a clothing
store at the Stanford Shopping Mall
for the last three weeks. (I won't say
which one, because that would start
us down a path that inevitably leads
to "Sorry, I can't get you a discount.")
I've loved working with the staff and
managers there, but the job definitely
has its difficulties. I've had to learn
colors. While I've mastered the stan
dard Crayola eight pack, most of the
female customers are operating with
the deluxe 256 pack. (Them: "Excuse
me, this dress is violet, and we were
looking for it in periwinkle." Me: "Uh
... it looks purple. But I'll go look for
... a different purple.")

Women's clothing in general is
confusing. A tunic is a girl dress-shirt
combo-thingy, but, despite the name,
it looks nothing like what Link wears
in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of
Time. (Confusing, I know.) And I still
don't know what a "camisole" is, but I
do know that I don't know how to
fold them correctly.
The hours are difficult. If you
asked me to make a list of my ideal
ways to spend a Tuesday morning, it
would be multiple sentences with the
words "bed" and "sleep" rearranged.
What would not make the cut is "bik
ing in the rain at 6:05 in the morning
to the Stanford Shopping Mall to fold
and re-fold shirts in a back room for
eight dollars an hour and ultimately
getting in trouble for being late," (I
showed up to work at 6:15 in the
morning, and I was late. I didn't even
know that was possible.)
But the hardest thing about work
ing in retail so far has been quitting.
And I don't say this in the endear
ing, "I can't quit; I just love it so
much!" way, but more in the "quitting
cigarettes" sort of way. Like, I can't.
The job was clearly eating away at me.
I had eight hours between my Mon
day night and Tuesday morning shift
to do all of my homework and try to
fit in a (Stanford) night's sleep. I spent
most of my Saturday "looking busy"
on the sales floor rather than catching
up on school or being a regular col
lege kid. But something in me would
not let me quit the job.
Every time I thought about quit
ting (which is a gazillion times while
folding shirts for eight hours), all of
these voices appeared in my head to
talk me out of it. "You're just being

weak. Plenty of other college kids are
working while going to school."
"Tough it out. You just need to prior
itize your time better." "You need to
make money. Don't be a quitter." I
kept buying into these voices.
The majority of students on cam
pus are overcommitted, and we come
to view it as a good thing. "Over
whelmed" is synonymous with "am
bitious" or "hard working," and tak
ing time to rest is treated as barely a
step up from failure and defeat. Due
to technological advances and an in
creasingly competitive job market,
our generation is working longer
hours than most others in history; and
we at Stanford are right smack in the
middle of it. We work as if we have no
human limitations, pushing through
the exhaustion and anxiety with sheer
willpower. And rather than telling
each other to slow down and take
care of ourselves, we praise each
other with awe-filled "how-do-you
do-it" faces.

I am horrible about this, and con
sequently, I burn out or spread myself
too thin far too often. Sometimes I try
to do everything to ensure I don't
miss out on anything: the Fear Of
Missing Out (someone somewhere
called it "FOMO," which makes it
sound legit.) Sometimes it is out of
pride. I see others doing everything,
and I need to prove to myself that I
am just as capable (or more). Some
times it is just a simple case of over
achieving and people-pleasing. No
matter the reason, I burn myself out
and end up too exhausted or too anx
ious about the future to live in and
enjoy the present.
It's impossible for me to do and be
everything to everyone all the time, so
I need to stop pretending like I can.
We are all people with physical, men
tal and emotional limitations. We need
to stop telling ourselves that this is a
bad thing. Say no every once in a while
(break the golden rule of improv).
Take some time to restore your body
and soul. Sometimes, it's okay to be a
quitter.

morning, and I was late. I didn't even
know that was possible.)
But the hardest thing about work
ing in retail so far has been quitting.
And I don't say this in the endear
ing, "I can't quit; I just love it so
much!" way, but more in the "quitting
cigarettes" sort of way. Like, I can't.
The job was clearly eating away at me.
I had eight hours between my Mon
day night and Tuesday morning shift
to do all of my homework and try to
fit in a (Stanford) night's sleep. I spent
most of my Saturday "looking busy"
on the sales floor rather than catching
up on school or being a regular col
lege kid. But something in me would
not let me quit the job.
Every time I thought about quit
ting (which is a gazillion times while
folding shirts for eight hours), all of
these voices appeared in my head to
talk me out of it. "You're just being

weak. Plenty of other college kids are
working while going to school."
"Tough it out. You just need to prior
itize your time better." "You need to
make money. Don't be a quitter." I
kept buying into these voices.
The majority of students on cam
pus are overcommitted, and we come
to view it as a good thing. "Over
whelmed" is synonymous with "am
bitious" or "hard working," and tak
ing time to rest is treated as barely a
step up from failure and defeat. Due
to technological advances and an in
creasingly competitive job market,
our generation is working longer
hours than most others in history; and
we at Stanford are right smack in the
middle of it. We work as if we have no
human limitations, pushing through
the exhaustion and anxiety with sheer
willpower. And rather than telling
each other to slow down and take
care of ourselves, we praise each
other with awe-filled "how-do-you
do-it" faces.

I am horrible about this, and con
sequently, I burn out or spread myself
too thin far too often. Sometimes I try
to do everything to ensure I don't
miss out on anything: the Fear Of
Missing Out (someone somewhere
called it "FOMO," which makes it
sound legit.) Sometimes it is out of
pride. I see others doing everything,
and I need to prove to myself that I
am just as capable (or more). Some
times it is just a simple case of over
achieving and people-pleasing. No
matter the reason, I burn myself out
and end up too exhausted or too anx
ious about the future to live in and
enjoy the present.
It's impossible for me to do and be
everything to everyone all the time, so
I need to stop pretending like I can.
We are all people with physical, men
tal and emotional limitations. We need
to stop telling ourselves that this is a
bad thing. Say no every once in a while
(break the golden rule of improv).
Take some time to restore your body
and soul. Sometimes, it's okay to be a
quitter.
