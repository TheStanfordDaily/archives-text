# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## Now accepting applications: Class of 2012 
### Leslie Brian 
During the past two weeks,
I've been trying to take time
to smell the roses. After all,
it's the little things in life that matter,
right? That fresh, crisp bite to the
morning air just after last week's
thunderstorm, the sizzle of onions
and garlic as it hits a hot cast-iron
pan (gotta love Columbae), watch
ing a string of You Tube videos and
laughing until you cry (if you take
anything away from this column,
search "Ducks blown by wind" ...
you'll thank me later). Ahhh, life
was good.
Then, wham! Caught up in all
these little moments, I was blind
sided by a certain "big" thing. A re
ally big one. A giant dose of reality
that came stomping through my
rose garden and squashing all the
flowers.

Exactly one week ago, the class
of 2012 traded jeans for pencil skirts
or slacks and flip-flops for high heels
or loafers in preparation for the first
milestone of the Cardinal Recruit
ing Calendar: the Fall Career Fair.
Hundreds of potential employers
swarmed White Plaza, each booth
carefully packaged in plastic wrap to
ward off unexpected showers. It's a
cruel twist of fate, really: one minute,
you're a happy-go-lucky undergrad
uate who's guaranteed an outlet for
anything you want to do on campus
(Stanford clubs plead with you to
join at the Activities Fair). The next
thing, the tables have turned: sud
denly, all the people behind the
booths hold your future in their
hands. Tell us why we need you , they
ask.

I somehow missed the career fair
memo. Getting a job was something
seniors did much later in the year,
not during week two, right?! I didn't
pay much attention to the CDC
emails. I put the career fair in my
iCal, but then promptly forgot in the
face of more short-term deadlines.

So, when my friends asked me
whether I was going, I responded
with "What career fair?"

I guess I figured it was optional?
Or maybe the reality didn't hit me
until I saw everybody looking like
they had raided their parents' clos
ets and emerged outfitted in shoes
two sizes too big with lipstick
smeared across their teeth. This was
n't me! These weren't my peers.The
fact that we are poised to launch into
the real world was too surreal to
process.

When I realized I had fallen be
hind, I immediately slipped into
panic mode. True to Stanford form,
when confronted with a problem, I
wanted an immediate solution. In a
desperate attempt to play catch-up
on everything I had missed, I
booked myself solid with career ad
vising appointments, meetings with
professors and company informa
tion sessions.

A mere three days into my job
search binge, I found myself strung
out, dazed and exhausted. But if I
couldn't handle more than 72 hours
of this, how would I end up doing
anything other than flipping burgers
post-graduation?
I had to take a step back and
breathe. And when I looked at the
whole picture again, I had a new per
spective.

So many of us are people of ex
tremes. And it applies to everything
in our lives, not just job searches.
Sometimes, I feel that if I don't do
something 150 percent, it's not
worth doing at all. Why apply for
jobs unless you can devote 12
straight hours to research, emails,
applications and resume-building?
Work is only "work" if you're stay
ing up all night, jacked on coffee,
with a minimum of four different
papers or assignments due the next
day. At the same time, relaxation
only comes packed in super-sized

doses: sleeping in past 2 p.m., watch
ing full seasons of TV for hours on
end or taking an entire day to pro
crastinate.
Whatever happened to balance?
True, it's easier to stick your head in
the sand or attack in full battle array,
but neither of these will ultimately
lead to a real solution in the long
run. In fact, they're both two sides of
the same coin: fight or flight. Either
way, we don't take time to tune into
ourselves and really engage with the
issues and what they mean for us.
While it's easier to see things in
black and white, isn't there room for
gray? But what would that even
look like? Could I work steadily on
an application for a few days while
still taking a break for lunch or going
for a walk with a friend?
Yes, it's possible. It's just much
harder to engage with the process
and actually digest all the emotions
it brings up than to launch into a "get
it done" mentality that lets me
power through 16 applications with
out thinking about what I'm writing
in the first place.
So yes, the next time there's a ca
reer fair, I'll be there. My future is
one of those big things in life I need
to face. But I can face it one little
step at a time. When we break it
down into little pieces, it's a more
manageable and enjoyable process.
And trust me, no one is going to
wind up flipping burgers.
