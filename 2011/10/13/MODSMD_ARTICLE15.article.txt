## Never tell me the odds 
### Jack Blanchat 
After six weeks of the
college football season,
we have 13 teams that
are still undefeated,
and the speculation of
who will still be unblemished come
BCS bowl time is already starting to
run rampant.
I know I've spent a lot of time al
ready writing about undefeated
teams, but whatever. I'm a one-trick
pony. So this week, I've decided to
play a version of "Pardon the Inter
ruption's" oddsmakers with the
teams left standing. I've listed off the
13 teams and placed their chance of
going undefeated next to them. I've
applied my super-secret formula to
determine these statistics, so feel
free to nitpick my predictions. And
here we go.
LSU and Alabama —5O per
cent. Based on what I've seen, the
wacky Leslie Miles has the Fighting
Tigers at a near-unbeatable level.
But little Nicky Saban also has the
Crimson Tide playing scary-good
football. I think one of these teams
will go undefeated, but it's a toss-up
which one wins when they play each
other on Nov. 5. Therefore, I'll just
say both of these teams have an
equal chance of running the table.

Oklahoma 80 percent. The
Sooners are stacked (and they have
to be riding high after making Texas
look like a JV team), but they still
play four ranked teams in five
weeks to end their season, includ
ing an away game against rival Ok
lahoma State. And we all know how
"Big Game" Bob Stoops fares
against good teams (3-5 in BCS
bowl games). They're legitimately
better than every team left on their
schedule, though.
Wisconsin 90 percent. The
Badgers may have the best chance of
any major conference team to go un
defeated. The Big Ten is full of good
but-not-great teams, and the Badgers
have one of the most dominant of
fenses in the country. They only play
two ranked teams for the rest of the
season (Michigan State and Illinois),
so I'll be surprised if they lose along
the way.
Boise State 100 percent.
Boise's schedule is not just awful, it's
offensively awful. It's as bad as the
smell of Sex Panther from "Anchor
man." They'll win every game and go
to a BCS bowl because they are sig
nificantly better than every team on
their schedule.
Oklahoma State —35 percent.
The Cowboys scream "overrated" to
me. Sure, they have the "best offense"
in the countiy, but their stats are
wacky thanks to a 61-point outburst
against Louisiana-Lafayette and a 70-
point game against Kansas, which has
the worst defense in college football.
They might run through the rest of
their schedule, but I don't think they
can beat Oklahoma this year.
Stanford 65 percent. It's hard
to tell right now if LaMichael James
will miss significant time for the Ore
gon Ducks, who are the biggest test
remaining on Stanford's schedule. If
James isn't there on Nov. 12 to drive
the Ducks' potent run game, this per
centage will go up considerably.
Clemson 0 percent. Because
they're Clemson. Seriously. Clemson
will somehow find away to go 8-4 or
9-3. It doesn't matter who they play,
the "They're Clemson" factor is too
great to overcome. It's as undeniable
as the force of gravity. Also, did you
see Dabo Swinney after Clemson
upset Auburn? He was way too excit
ed to beat a mediocre SEC team. It
was like the 2011 equivalent of
Howard Dean's "BYAAAHHHH!"
Michigan —1.3 percent. Watch
ing Michigan is like watching a pee
wee football team with one kid who is
way faster than everybody else on the

Speculation of who
will still be
unblemished come

already running
rampant.
field. Their defense is terrible (no,
don't cite stats to me, I watched the
Notre Dame game), and Denard
Robinson is an appallingly bad pass
er. I don't believe they'll win out, but
they have the luxury of not playing
Wisconsin in the regular season.
Georgia Tech —45 percent. I
love the triple option. Their schedule
is significantly harder in the second
half of the year, though.
Illinois 10 percent. I don't
think there's any way they beat Wis
consin on Nov. 19, but I'll give them
a chance. The Illini are a nicely bal
anced team, but Wisconsin looks too
strong.
Kansas State 0 percent. The
Wildcats have played a pretty easy
schedule up to this point, and
they've been a nice surprise so far
this season. BUT they have a four
week stretch where they play Okla
homa, Oklahoma State, Texas A&M
and Texas. If Kansas State beats all
four of those teams, I'll probably be
so shocked I'll bite the tip of my
tongue off (or something awesome
like that).
Houston 65 percent. Case
Keenum and the Cougars are ab
solutely on fire once again. They're
first in the nation in passing yards
and fifth in the nation in points, and
they play an absolutely atrocious
schedule. However, they have had
close games against UCLA,
Louisiana Tech and UTEP, so that
does give me reason to downgrade
them a bit. The best test left on their
schedule is probably SMU, which
means they have a darn good
chance of running the table. GMAC
bowl, here come the Cougs! (Or
maybe the Liberty Bowl. But don't
worry, Houston, you'll be in the Big
12 soon enough.)
