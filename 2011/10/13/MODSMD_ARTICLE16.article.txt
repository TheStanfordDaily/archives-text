# TOP-TIER WEEKEND
## Pac-12 tests ahead for Card 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ 
With four straight victories, the
women's volleyball team has
quelled any fears that arose after
an early slip-up in conference
play. The Cardinal is looking to
carry its momentum into this
weekend's matches against Wash
ington and Washington State, two
potential roadblocks in its quest
for a sixth straight Pac-12 champi
onship.
After two disappointing losses
to UCLA and USC three week
ends ago, No. 7 Stanford (12-3,6-3
Pac-12) has roared back, beating
Arizona and Arizona State at
home and Oregon and Oregon
State on the road. The team is back
home at Maples Pavilion this
weekend for a matchup with Wash
ington State on Friday before a
showdown with No. 3 Washington
on Saturday night.
The Cougars (11-7, 3-5) come
into town with a sub-.500 confer
ence record that has them sitting in
ninth place in the Pac-12, four
spots below the Cardinal. But it
will be important for Stanford not
to overlook the matchup, as Wash
ington State swept Colorado in
their last game and played well in
the preseason.
Leading the charge for the
Cougars is their lone senior, 6-foot
-3 outside hitter Meagan Ganzer.
The Cardinal will have a lot to han
dle with Ganzer, who has already
piled up 343 kills. This total, paired
with her 4.97 kill-per-set mark, has
her sitting atop the Pac-12 in this
statistic. Ganzer is also seventh in
the conference in aces per set
(0.29), and she is coming off a very
solid performance against Col
orado in which she had a game
high 19 kills and three aces.
The daunting task of slowing
Ganzer down will be mostly up to

sophomore Carly Wopat, who
leads both Stanford and the Pac-12
in blocks with 1.62 per set. Wopat is
quickly emerging as one of the
Cardinal's best players and is mak
ing a name for herself in the con
ference with multiple Player of the
Week awards.
Provided that Wopat and com
pany can neutralize Ganzer and
the rest of the Cougar offense, the
bigger test this weekend will likely
come on Sunday against No. 3
Washington, which boasts a 15-1
record (7-1 conference).
The Huskies are currently sit
ting three spots above Stanford at
second in the Pac-12, trailing only

USC for the league lead. Their im
pressive resume includes straight
set victories against UCLA, Ore
gon and Arizona. With the Cardi
nal looking up at them in the stand
ings, this game is as close to a must
win as it gets this early in the sea
son.

Senior middle blockers Bianca
Rowland and Lauren Barfield an
chor the Huskies up front. The duo
has combined for 96 blocks this
season Rowland is averaging
1.52 per set and Barfield 1.44.
But the Huskies' most impres
sive player may be freshman stand
out Kristen Vansant. She leads all
freshmen in points per set, with

4.18, and is 10th in the conference
with 3.57 kills pet set. Vansant has
played a major role in Washing
ton's success this season and will
look to continue her stellar play
this weekend against Stanford.
With the halfway point of the
conference schedule coming up,
this weekend should prove a good
measuring stick for the Cardinal.
The weekend kicks off Friday night
against Washington State, with a
Saturday night matchup against
Washington to follow both
games tip at 7 p.m.
