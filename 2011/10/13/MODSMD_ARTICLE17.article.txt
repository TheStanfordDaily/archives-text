# FORREST AT HOME IN THE WATER
## 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Long nights working on
problem sets. Early
morning practices. The
class load of a Stanford
engineer. The athletic
demands of a Stanford
varsity water polo player. These
may seem like incompatible de
mands on one person's time, but
for junior two-meter Forrest
Watkins, it's a daily schedule.
Watkins is the men's water polo
team's second-leading scorer this
season with 16 points in 11 games
even so, he believes his game is
strongest on defense. Watkins
scored the tying goal this past Sun
day before No. 1 Stanford pulled
ahead 6-5 to defeat No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara. Watkins also tallied a goal
in Stanford's 9-5 victory over No. 8
Pepperdine last Friday night.
But Watkins wouldn't be at
Stanford if water polo were his
only talent. Last season, he was
named to the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) All-
Academic List and said he
would like to raise his grades even
higher. After slugging through the
requirements earlier in his aca
demic career, Watkins now loves
his Management Science & Engi
neering major. He is currently
working on a group MS&E project
to develop a social "bucket list"
network in which people can cross
items like skydiving off their
bucket list together, meet people
with similar interests and get dis
counts for these activities.
The rigorous combination of ac
ademics and athletics has Watkins
out of bed every morning by 7 a.m.
Between practice, class and meals,
he is busy for the first 12 hours of
his day.
The secret to his success?
"Figure out solid blocks of time
to get work done," Watkins said.
Watkins and his friends manage
to stray from that simple advice
often, but it comes as no surprise
that Watkins enjoys working hard
in the classroom after all, that's
why he came to the Farm.
"When I think of Stanford, I
think of coming here as a student
first," Watkins said. "It's balanced. I

feel like [at] other schools they
have athlete dining halls, athlete
dorms, athlete everything so you
only hang out with athletes and
you're just an athlete and whatever

you can fit in for a major is second
ary. I like being able to do an engi
neering degree, do whatever I want
and still balance a sport."
Growing up, Watkins said he

was "terrible" at land sports but al
ways a strong swimmer. His father
suggested he try water polo when
he was six years old. In middle
school, he became teammates with
current Stanford driver Austin
Trinkle; the duo co-captained their
high school team for two years and
are now in their eighth year as
teammates. Watkins says the two
have great chemistry in the pool to
gether, especially when Watkins
can tell Trinkle is ready for the ball
and ready to shoot.
Watkins scored seven goals last
season as a redshirt freshman, in
cluding two multi-goal games. He
tallied scores in the Cardinal's
MPSF semifinal upset over No. 1
California and in a title-game loss
to USC.
Watkins said that the team
began building around the defense
at the end of last season and has
carried that through into this sea
son, especially in the preseason,
when some players were away with
the U.S. National Team.
"All of preseason it was 'work
on defense, work on defense,'"
Watkins said. "When guys come
back, we'll figure out the offense,"
The Cardinal is still figuring out
the offense it has three one-goal
wins in 11 games this season but
the defense has led the team all the
way to No. 1. Stanford beat USC 5-
4 on Oct. 2 by holding the Trojans
to four goals on 11 shots after USC
scored 12 times in the two teams'
last meeting. In its most recent vic
tory, the defense kept Stanford in
the game until the struggling of
fense scored two goals late to beat
UC-Santa Barbara 6-5.
If the defense keeps working
away and the offense finds some
rhythm, Watkins could see one of
his major Stanford goals come to
fruition a championship. But
win or lose, he will keep working at
his other goals: graduating with a
degree in MS&E and creating his
own start-up with friends and
teammates.
"I want to build something from
the ground up," Watkins said.
No need to know whether he's
talking about the No. 1 water polo
team or a start-up.

Trinkle; the duo co-captained their
high school team for two years and
are now in their eighth year as
teammates. Watkins says the two
have great chemistry in the pool to
gether, especially when Watkins
can tell Trinkle is ready for the ball
and ready to shoot.
Watkins scored seven goals last
season as a redshirt freshman, in
cluding two multi-goal games. He
tallied scores in the Cardinal's
MPSF semifinal upset over No. 1
California and in a title-game loss
to USC.
Watkins said that the team
began building around the defense
at the end of last season and has
carried that through into this sea
son, especially in the preseason,
when some players were away with
the U.S. National Team.
"All of preseason it was 'work
on defense, work on defense,'"
Watkins said. "When guys come
back, we'll figure out the offense,"
The Cardinal is still figuring out
the offense it has three one-goal
wins in 11 games this season but
the defense has led the team all the
way to No. 1. Stanford beat USC 5-
4 on Oct. 2 by holding the Trojans
to four goals on 11 shots after USC
scored 12 times in the two teams'
last meeting. In its most recent vic
tory, the defense kept Stanford in
the game until the struggling of
fense scored two goals late to beat
UC-Santa Barbara 6-5.
If the defense keeps working
away and the offense finds some
rhythm, Watkins could see one of
his major Stanford goals come to
fruition a championship. But
win or lose, he will keep working at
his other goals: graduating with a
degree in MS&E and creating his
own start-up with friends and
teammates.
"I want to build something from
the ground up," Watkins said.
No need to know whether he's
talking about the No. 1 water polo
team or a start-up.

I like being able to do an
engineering degree, do whatever I
want and still balance a sport.
