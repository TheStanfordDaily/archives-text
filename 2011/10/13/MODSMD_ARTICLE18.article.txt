## Women's soccer's Chioma Ubogagu named Pac-12 Player of the Week after scoring spree 
### – Miles Bennett-Smith 
Chioma Übogagu has been a
major factor in the top-ranked
women's soccer team's early-sea
son success the freshman for
ward has six goals and six assists in
her first 14 games on the Farm.
On Wednesday, Übogagu was
named Pac-12 Player of the Week
for her efforts in two big conference
wins over the weekend. The Cop
pell, Texas, native intercepted a de
flected pass and scored from close
range just nine minutes into Sun
day's clash with No. 3 UCLA, then
added a second goal just 10 minutes

later, after a nifty move inside the
box freed her in front of goal to slot
the ball inside the left post.
The Cardinal finished off the Bru
ins 4-1, but it was Übogagu's early
spark that had UCLA on its heels
throughout much of the match.
This is the second Pac-12 honor
of the season for Stanford, as senior
Lindsay Taylor was Player of the
Week in September, but just the
first such award for Übogagu, who
has thus far lived up to the hype as
topdrawersoccer.com's No. 3 re
cruit in the class of 2015.
The Cardinal will be back in ac
tion this weekend, looking to com
plete a third consecutive undefeat
ed conference season as it takes on
Arizona State this Friday at 7 p.m.
