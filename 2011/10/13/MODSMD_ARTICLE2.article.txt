# Disney probes women and war
## 
### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Abigail Disney, an award-winning docu
mentarian and Stanford alumna, spoke on
Wednesday evening in the Cemex Auditorium
on her documentary work illuminating the
role of women in conflict and peace.
Her mini-series titled "Women, War and
Peace," which premiered on PBS this week,
explores women's roles in conflict situations,
specifically in Cambodia, Afghanistan, Bosnia
and Liberia.
When making her previous documentary
on women's work to end civil war in Liberia,

Pray the Devil Back to Hell, Disney soon real
ized the lack of footage on women's roles in
conflict.
"We had hours and hours of people shoot
ing at each other... yet no footage of the
women fighting for peace," Disney said. "The
disparity struck us."
Disney attributed this void to society's
eradication of women from the landscape of
war.
"Women are wives, women are prostitutes
and women are victims," she said. "However,
there is a mental roadblock in acknowledging
women's active role in war and resolution of
war."

Disney argued that this barrier arises from
the media, which shapes our values of what
matters and who matters in war. She said that
Hollywood uses enormous amounts of inge
nuity and money to create vivid, lifelike im
ages of what combat looks like, with one ex
ception: "It's scripted," she said. "It's fiction."
The propagation of Hollywood's narrative
on war is evident in the amount of Rambo
paraphernalia Disney witnesses across the
world.

"Rambo is the Mickey Mouse of war
you see him everywhere across the world,"
Disney said. "But if the glow of Rambo and all
his sweaty muscularity fell away, what would

we be left with?"
Disney commented on the capability of a
gun to attract or captivate society to the extent
that war correspondents today seldom have
women in their footage. Indeed, in her work,
the majority of women's protests footage
came from private, individual sources.
Thus, her mini-series seeks to make women
more visible. Disney said she works toward
this goal by putting the camera in the hands of
a woman. By showing a women's perspective,
the framework, assumptions and visibility of
combat changed, she said.
Though the series features strong, peace
making women, it was not an attempt to ele
vate women as the sole discretionary power of
making peace. Instead, it was a look on the
gender difference in living and telling war, ac
cording to Disney.
This focus on exploring gender why the
Clayman Institute for Gender Research sup
ported the talk, according to Lori Mackenzie,
associate director of the institute. This talk was
intended to build awareness of the second
front of war: the women's story.
"We want to move beyond the stall where
nothing moves beyond where it is for women,"
Mackenzi said. "We want to gain some mo
mentum for women."
When women themselves recognize their
visibility, they behave differently, Disney said.
They become engaged, she added.
Disney concluded her talk with some
thoughts for society as a whole.
"We need to understand that peace is a
verb something you do, something you
make," she said. "I will declare victory when
the word 'peacebuilding' won't be underlined
in red on Microsoft Word; it is a real word and
a real thing."
The talk was part of Stanford's Ethics and
War Series and was also sponsored by the
McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society,
the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and
Civil Society and the Social Entrepreneurship
Program.
