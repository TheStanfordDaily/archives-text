## Stanford Hospital faces $20 million lawsuit 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Stanford Flospital & Clinics (SHC) an
nounced that it is making identity protection
resources available to the 20,000 patients
whose personal files were posted online for
nearly one year on a student tutorial forum.
The information was first posted last August.
The Hospital officially recognized the priva
cy breach in September and now faces a $2O
million lawsuit as of last week.
SHC notified patients last month that a
spreadsheet handled by Multi-Specialty Col

lection Services (MSCS), a third party billing
contractor, was posted on Student of Fortune, a
free homework help website. SHC made a pro
fessional call center and identity protection
company called Debix available to patients for
assistance.

Patient Shana Springer filed a class-action
suit against SHC and the outside vendor,
MSCS, a company providing business and fi
nancial support to the Hospital when she
learned about this breach of patient privacy.
This class-action suit is seeking $2O million in
damages, or $l,OOO for each of the 20,000 pa

tients affected.
According to SHC director of communica
tions Gary Migdol, SHC "immediately sus
pended all work with the vendor [MSCS] upon
discovery of the breach and demanded that
MSCS lock down all patient information." The
relationship between SHC and MSCS has since
been terminated, Migdol said.
Though SHC has pointed any direct in
quiries about the breach to MSCS, the compa
ny recently disabled its website and could not
be reached for comment.
Investigators hired by SHC de
termined in their inquiry that Frank
Corcino, executive vice president of
MSCS and SHC's primary contact
with the contractor, originally re
quested the patient files containing
names, diagnosis codes, account
numbers and admission and dis
charge dates of approximately
20,000 patients who visited the
Hospital's emergency room in
2009. The Hospital complied and
sent Corcino the encrypted data in
2010.
SHC said in its Oct. 7 and 9 state
ments that "[the Hospital] sent en
crypted patient information to
MSCS for permissible business
purposes ... [and] MSCS was re
sponsible by law and contract for
protecting all patient information
provided to it for its services."
The Hospital added that sending
these encrypted files followed the
regulations from the 1996 Health
Insurance Portability and Account
ability Act (HIPPA). In both the
Oct. 7 and 9 statements, SHC said
the "regrettable incident" was the
result of MSCS' breach of contract.
Corcino said in a statement to
the New York Times that he de
crypted the data after receiving it
from Stanford. He then created a
spreadsheet out of the patient files
gave the information to an uniden
tified job applicant to MSCS as part
of a skills test. The applicant, who
allegedly was unaware that the

spreadsheet data was private, post
ed the files to Student of Fortune.
SHC later discovered these files on
Aug. 22, 2011, and requested their
removal. Student of Fortune re
sponded promptly to this request.
"We take violations of our terms
of use very seriously, including
posting confidential materials,"
wrote Gita Chandra, account direc
tor of Student of Fortune in an
email to The Daily. "With respect to
Stanford Hospital, we removed the
file and deleted it from our records
immediately after being notified of
a violation."
Although SOF removed these
files by the next day, some patients
expressed concern about whether
this incident made them vulnerable
to future identity theft.
SHC maintains that the leaked
information has not been used to
harm the patients.
"To date there is no evidence that
anyone saw this information on the
website and improperly used it for
fraudulent or any other improper
purpose," SHC said last week in its
Oct. 7 and 9 press releases.
In an interview with The Daily,
Bradley I. Kramer, one of the
lawyers representing the class-ac
tion suit, stated that he was not
aware of any identity theft inci
dents resulting from the posted in
formation. As the SHC investiga
tion continues, Kramer states that
his firm plans on conducting its own
investigation if the suit goes to trial.
