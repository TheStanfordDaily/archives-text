# Researchers find new pathway for diabetes treatment
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
Stanford researchers recently dis
covered a molecular pathway that
naturally decreases the number of
insulin-producing cells. By activating
this pathway through drug injection,
the researchers believe that this new
discovery may provide a new strate
gy for fighting diabetes.
The molecular pathway is con
trolled through a platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) receptor.
The PDGF receptor is found to de
crease over time in both humans
and mice. This decrease is in con
junction with a decline in pancreat
ic beta cells.
Pancreatic beta cells are respon
sible for producing insulin, a hor
mone responsible for controlling
blood sugar levels by signaling
when to remove the sugar and store
it in other cells. Both Type-1 and
Type-2 diabetes are linked to lower
numbers of beta cells.
Researchers found that when
PDGF receptors were blocked, the
number of beta cells significantly
decreased, and blood sugar levels
increased. However, when PDGF
receptors were added, the beta cells
in the mice increased.
The researchers found a similar
pattern in human beta cells, sug
gesting the possibility of regulating
insulin through the expression of
PDGF receptors. By artificially
stimulating the receptor pathway,
the researchers were able to in
crease the number of beta cells in
mice without affecting the mice's
ability to control its blood sugar lev
els. This simultaneous ability to in
crease beta cells without affecting
blood sugar levels is a new achieve
ment in research on diabetes treat
ment.
