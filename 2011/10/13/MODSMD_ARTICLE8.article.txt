## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Marianne LeVine 
Stanford launched the Welch
Road Utility Improvement Project
on Wednesday, a component of the
Medical Center's Renewal Project.
The project is designed to both re
place and construct utility services
for the new hospital facilities. The
construction will take place along
Welch and Quarry Roads.
Among the goals of the con
struction project are widening
Welch road, improving sidewalks,
planting trees and increasing the
number of streetlights. These meas

ures are in preparation for the Lu
cille Packard Children's Hospital
expansion to Welch Road. In an in
terview with Market Watch, a finan
cial information website part of the
Dow Jones' Consumer Media
Group, Mark Tortorich, the vice
president of design and construc
tion of the new hospital, stated that
he believed the renewal project will
help to "deliver rapidly advancing
medical science in flexible facilities
... [and] can serve the next genera
tion of medicine."
The changes to Welch Road will
affect traffic flow on campus. As a
result of the construction, Welch
Road will become a one-way road
until the project is completed. North
Pasteur Road, located between
Blake Wilbur Drive and Sand Hill
Road, will be closed as a result of
the construction. South Pasteur will
become a two-way road to ease the
flow of traffic entering and leaving
Stanford Hospital. Signs indicating
the recent changes will be posted in
the affected areas.
All hospital facilities will remain
open during the construction peri
od. Construction for Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital is expected to
be completed in 2012.
