# Palo Alto teachers' union protests increasing class sizes

### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Palo Alto Unified School District
teachers called for the Board of Ed
ucation to halt a four-year trend of
growing class sizes at Tuesday's
board meeting.
Recent budget cuts caused the
average class size in Palo Alto ele
mentary schools to rise from 19.9 in
the 2007-08 school year to 22.2 this
fall. Financial incentives to reduce
class sizes have also been cut in light
of the state of California's ongoing
budget crisis. Recent enrollment in
creases has also reduced revenue to
$919 per student in the past three
years, according to Superintendent
Kevin Skelly.
Though the teachers suggested
that elementary class sizes could rise
to as much as 30 students each, Skel
ly said that those rumors are "not ac
curate."
Nonetheless, Skelly said that cur
rent class sizes "are at the edge of
board and staff comfort levels." The
issue remains unresolved in the dis
trict's negotiations with the Palo
Alto Educators Association.
