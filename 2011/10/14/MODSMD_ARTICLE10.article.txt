## EDITORIAL Wall Street protesters higlight key issues 
### 
As the protests which began
on Wall Street spread
around the country in
cluding Stanford's own White
Plaza many have sought to de
fine the protests' ever-elusive un
derlying message. Among the pro
testers it is likely that there are
reasonable views with which we
agree, reasonable views with
which we disagree and views that
are not so reasonable at all. Nev
ertheless, the topics the protests
have highlighted, chief among
them economic inequality and the
failure to rein in unbridled finan
cial sector risk-taking, provide an
occasion to look at some of the
crucial questions facing American
society.

U.S. policy, including changes in
taxes, executive compensation
and financial deregulation, has
played a central role in facilitating
this shift.

As the Wall Street protesters
have suggested, the share of the
economic pie accruing to the fi
nancial sector has increased in re
cent years. In 2004, the top 25
hedge fund managers earned
more than all of the CEOs from
the S&P 500. Financial sector
profits rose to 41 percent of all
profits in the 2000s, gradually ris
ing up from less than 16 percent
before 1985. Financial sector pay
has reached 181 percent of the av
erage for all domestic private in
dustries after never exceeding 108
percent before 1982. Some of
these gains are clearly attributa
ble to the new demands of a glob
alized, technologically advanced
world, but risky behavior has also
played a role. Several economists
have explained, for example, how
traders can take advantage of
negatively skewed probability
distributions to earn good returns
for awhile and collect hefty short
run bonuses, while leaving their
firm, the government and the na
tion to clean up when things go
catastrophically wrong.
Worse, efforts to reform the fi
nancial sector have been
stonewalled by Republicans in
Washington. Congress passed the
Dodd-Frank financial regulation
bill last summer, but less than a
tenth of its rules have been imple
mented a year later. Republicans
have vowed to repeal the law,
worked to defund the Securities
and Exchange Commission and
other agencies tasked with imple
menting it and refused to confirm
nominees to key positions. While
some provisions of the law
such as higher capital require
ments for systemically important
financial institutions are clear
ly indispensable, we do not pre
tend to know whether it would be
enough to protect against future
crashes or to argue that it is per
fect. But the Republican position
is not to replace Dodd-Frank with
some other well-reasoned re
forms; it is to bring back the bro
ken system that brought us this
mess to begin with. Arguing that
everything was fine just the way it
was seems like quite a stretch.

The unequal distribution of
American incomes has reached
staggering proportions. Out of 136
countries with data in the CIA
World Factbook, 96 have more
equal income distributions than
the United States does, which
comes in just after Iran, Nigeria
and Uganda with a top-heaviness
unrivaled by any other advanced
nation. The top 1 percent of
Americans now earns 24 percent
of all income and hold 40 percent
of the national wealth, up from 9
percent and 20 percent in 1976.
Since the late 19705, the average
income of the top 1 percent has
roughly tripled, while the middle
quintile has seen only a 21-per
cent increase and the bottom fifth,
only a 6-percent increase. Essen
tially, the rich have gotten much
richer while everyone else has
seen their incomes stagnate.
While the exploding wealth of
the wealthy might not be a prob
lem in and of itself, the evidence
indicates that high levels of in
equality come with significant
problems. New York Times colum
nist Nicholas Kristof has pointed
out that among rich countries and
the 50 American states, inequality
controlling for overall income
levels is associated with more
mental illness, infant mortality,
drug use, obesity, high school
dropouts, teenage births and
homicides. Inequality might also
stifle wealth creation. A recent In
ternational Monetary Fund
(IMF) study found that long-run
economic growth has a greater
correlation with egalitarian in
come distributions than with
other traditionally important
growth factors such as trade open
ness, political institutions, or for
eign direct investment. Earlier
IMF research suggests that in
equality might also contribute to
sparking financial crises. Interest
ingly, the only time in American
history income was as unequal as
it is in the present was 1929, right
before the onset of the Great De
pression.

Observers smarter than us
have sounded this alarm before.
Tyler Cowen, a George Mason
economics professor, wrote that
the status quo in the financial sec
tor is "distorting resource distri
bution and productivity" and
could "again bring our economy
to its knees." Simon Johnson, for
mer IMF chief economist, has
warned about "the prospect of a
national and global collapse ...
worse than the Great Depres
sion." We understand that reform
ing Wall Street to maintain a
strong financial sector while re
ducing catastrophic risk will be
complicated. The important,
thing, however, is to understand
the debate and refrain from cast
ing our voices recklessly. Whether
students support the Occupy Wall
Street protests and their national
counterparts or not is less rele
vant. The protests are valuable for
drawing attention to an important
issue, but it is only by understand
ing the underlying issues and why
they cause so much contention
that we can have a healthy debate
about the nature of the economy
and how it impacts society.

Some suggest that rising in
equality primarily reflects market
forces. With the integration of
global markets and technological
change, the argument goes, the re
turns to education have increased
dramatically and left a gulf be
tween the rich and poor. But as
political scientists Jacob Hacker
and Paul Pierson point out in their
book, Winner-Take-All Politics,
roughly a quarter of Americans
graduate from college, but only
the top few percent have seen ex
plosive income gains. Further
more, other industrialized nations
have experienced the same eco
nomic changes without anything
approaching similar increases in
inequality. The authors argue that

only a 6-percent increase. Essen
tially, the rich have gotten much
richer while everyone else has
seen their incomes stagnate.
While the exploding wealth of
the wealthy might not be a prob
lem in and of itself, the evidence
indicates that high levels of in
equality come with significant
problems. New York Times colum
nist Nicholas Kristof has pointed
out that among rich countries and
the 50 American states, inequality
controlling for overall income
levels is associated with more
mental illness, infant mortality,
drug use, obesity, high school
dropouts, teenage births and
homicides. Inequality might also
stifle wealth creation. A recent In
ternational Monetary Fund
(IMF) study found that long-run
economic growth has a greater
correlation with egalitarian in
come distributions than with
other traditionally important
growth factors such as trade open
ness, political institutions, or for
eign direct investment. Earlier
IMF research suggests that in
equality might also contribute to
sparking financial crises. Interest
ingly, the only time in American
history income was as unequal as
it is in the present was 1929, right
before the onset of the Great De
pression.

Observers smarter than us
have sounded this alarm before.
Tyler Cowen, a George Mason
economics professor, wrote that
the status quo in the financial sec
tor is "distorting resource distri
bution and productivity" and
could "again bring our economy
to its knees." Simon Johnson, for
mer IMF chief economist, has
warned about "the prospect of a
national and global collapse ...
worse than the Great Depres
sion." We understand that reform
ing Wall Street to maintain a
strong financial sector while re
ducing catastrophic risk will be
complicated. The important,
thing, however, is to understand
the debate and refrain from cast
ing our voices recklessly. Whether
students support the Occupy Wall
Street protests and their national
counterparts or not is less rele
vant. The protests are valuable for
drawing attention to an important
issue, but it is only by understand
ing the underlying issues and why
they cause so much contention
that we can have a healthy debate
about the nature of the economy
and how it impacts society.

Some suggest that rising in
equality primarily reflects market
forces. With the integration of
global markets and technological
change, the argument goes, the re
turns to education have increased
dramatically and left a gulf be
tween the rich and poor. But as
political scientists Jacob Hacker
and Paul Pierson point out in their
book, Winner-Take-All Politics,
roughly a quarter of Americans
graduate from college, but only
the top few percent have seen ex
plosive income gains. Further
more, other industrialized nations
have experienced the same eco
nomic changes without anything
approaching similar increases in
inequality. The authors argue that

As the protests which began
on Wall Street spread
around the country in
cluding Stanford's own White
Plaza many have sought to de
fine the protests' ever-elusive un
derlying message. Among the pro
testers it is likely that there are
reasonable views with which we
agree, reasonable views with
which we disagree and views that
are not so reasonable at all. Nev
ertheless, the topics the protests
have highlighted, chief among
them economic inequality and the
failure to rein in unbridled finan
cial sector risk-taking, provide an
occasion to look at some of the
crucial questions facing American
society.

U.S. policy, including changes in
taxes, executive compensation
and financial deregulation, has
played a central role in facilitating
this shift.

As the Wall Street protesters
have suggested, the share of the
economic pie accruing to the fi
nancial sector has increased in re
cent years. In 2004, the top 25
hedge fund managers earned
more than all of the CEOs from
the S&P 500. Financial sector
profits rose to 41 percent of all
profits in the 2000s, gradually ris
ing up from less than 16 percent
before 1985. Financial sector pay
has reached 181 percent of the av
erage for all domestic private in
dustries after never exceeding 108
percent before 1982. Some of
these gains are clearly attributa
ble to the new demands of a glob
alized, technologically advanced
world, but risky behavior has also
played a role. Several economists
have explained, for example, how
traders can take advantage of
negatively skewed probability
distributions to earn good returns
for awhile and collect hefty short
run bonuses, while leaving their
firm, the government and the na
tion to clean up when things go
catastrophically wrong.
Worse, efforts to reform the fi
nancial sector have been
stonewalled by Republicans in
Washington. Congress passed the
Dodd-Frank financial regulation
bill last summer, but less than a
tenth of its rules have been imple
mented a year later. Republicans
have vowed to repeal the law,
worked to defund the Securities
and Exchange Commission and
other agencies tasked with imple
menting it and refused to confirm
nominees to key positions. While
some provisions of the law
such as higher capital require
ments for systemically important
financial institutions are clear
ly indispensable, we do not pre
tend to know whether it would be
enough to protect against future
crashes or to argue that it is per
fect. But the Republican position
is not to replace Dodd-Frank with
some other well-reasoned re
forms; it is to bring back the bro
ken system that brought us this
mess to begin with. Arguing that
everything was fine just the way it
was seems like quite a stretch.

The unequal distribution of
American incomes has reached
staggering proportions. Out of 136
countries with data in the CIA
World Factbook, 96 have more
equal income distributions than
the United States does, which
comes in just after Iran, Nigeria
and Uganda with a top-heaviness
unrivaled by any other advanced
nation. The top 1 percent of
Americans now earns 24 percent
of all income and hold 40 percent
of the national wealth, up from 9
percent and 20 percent in 1976.
Since the late 19705, the average
income of the top 1 percent has
roughly tripled, while the middle
quintile has seen only a 21-per
cent increase and the bottom fifth,
only a 6-percent increase. Essen
tially, the rich have gotten much
richer while everyone else has
seen their incomes stagnate.
