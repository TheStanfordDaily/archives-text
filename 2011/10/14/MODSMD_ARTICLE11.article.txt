T V Pet sharks all day?"

I'll always remember the
haughty tone of those words, deliv
ered in my first week of graduate
school at MIT, by one of my class
mates in the biology Ph.D. program.
Alone, they might be funny, or at
least ironic: My best friend actually
does pet sharks, if by "pet" you
mean "harpoon with high-tech tags
to track the world's biggest fish as
they cruise through the world's
oceans." But after more comments
about how I wasn't a "real biolo
gist" and that ecology wasn't a valid
science, I quickly realized I was
fighting an uphill battle for respect.
It's not that my classmates were
particularly unintelligent though
a few were, in this case, particularly
rude. Nor did most of them truly be
lieve I wasn't a scientist, pursuing
my work in a genuinely scientific
manner. Instead, I'd simply found
myself the lone tree-hugger (or, you
know, phytoplankton-hugger) in a
room full of the next great molecu
lar biologists. And in a department
focused on molecular biology, it was
understandable that some students
could be rather myopic.
In away, graduate school selects
for such laser-focus. You have to
latch onto something with enough
passion to pursue it for years
years when you'll watch your peers

take finance and tech j obs, rent one
bedroom walkups in Manhattan, or
start families without worrying
about long work hours. And once
you've picked that something, you
have to stick with it: getting a Ph.D.
is as much a lesson in saying "no" to
side-tracks, as it is gritting your
teeth through your own thesis proj
ect.

So of course, many of us wind up
thinking that what we do might just
be the only thing that matters in the
whole world. And then a few of us
wind up saying that someone else
"just" tags sharks, or "just" breeds
mice and we're only halfway jok
ing.

This isn't just an ivory tower
problem.
An old adage holds that "famil
iarity breeds contempt," but of
course ignorance breeds contempt
just as effectively. When we don't
understand something, we risk ei
ther under- or over-valuing it.
Whether we err in a positive or neg
ative direction depends on a com
plex set of social interactions that
shape our perceptions and value
systems. Because a cardiothoracic
surgeon saves lives in a very tangi
ble, direct manner, we admire his
deft sutures. Yet we look down on
the expert flick with which a
garbage collector loads trash bags,
though society's health depends
more heavily on his work.

Overall, though, it comes down
to knowledge or rather, the lack
of it.

Today's society is riddled with
"information silos" discrete pil
lars of specialized knowledge, local
ized and limited. In a complex and
high-tech world, we cannot know
everything, so we settle for a couple
areas of expertise, and view the rest
through a veil of mystery. Who
knows how to grow food? (Only
about 1 percent of Americans.)
Who manufactures complex com
puter chips? (Some factory in
China.) And if something breaks
down, well, there's a silo for that.

Information silos have allowed
us to advance further technological
ly than ever. We can stand on the
shoulders of giants without the
weight of extraneous details. But
silos are both a blessing and a curse.
As any biologist will tell you, life
doesn't exist inside a vacuum. Ig
nore the outside world at your peril.

Silos concentrate information in
the hands of a few. Advancement
relies on the single-minded intensi
ty of these experts, but the smaller
their number, the more likely the in
formation is to be lost altogether.
