Imagine that a man drinks a few
too many at a friend's place, then
goes to a bar around the corner.
When he passes by the door, he's fine
so far as anyone who hasn't been
with him can tell. The alcohol has yet
to make its mark. His BAC would
probably be nothing too alarming.
Imagine further that a bartender
gives him a drink while he seems rel
atively sober. Then he returns a little
later, still seeming within his bounds,
and the bartender, who obviously
has difficulty perceiving a total
stranger's mental state, a difficulty
compounded by the blaring music,
darkness of the room and sheer mass
of people who need to be tended to,
gives him another drink.Then, imag
ine that this man needs to go to the
hospital for alcohol poisoning is
this the fault of the bartender, or of
the bouncer? Could they really do
more than they did?
Imagine someone comes to your
house after "pre-gaming," helps
themselves to a drink from your re
frigerator, and then after some time

the alcohol catches up with her and
she is sick. Are you responsible for
having failed to monitor her intake,
even though there is no way you
could have known how much she
had drank before she arrived? Imag
ine someone doesn't pregame at all,
but has her friends go and get drinks
for him from the bar all night. A bar
tender only directly serves him one
drink. If he were hospitalized, would
we say the blame rests on the shoul
ders of the server, or of the guest who
did not know her limits and the
friends who did not care to impose
them?

In every case it seems unfair to
hold the hosts of parties culpable for
the mistakes of their guests when it
comes to alcohol. It is after all, a drug
that takes time to have an effect, af
fects people in different and non-ob
vious ways, and often is consumed in
a setting that makes it difficult to
keep track of any given person's in
take. It seems harsh indeed, in light
of these realities, that fraternities are
generally held responsible for peo

pie who act irresponsibly with alco
hol. Everyone knows that at an all
campus party, the sheer weight of the
crowd makes alcohol a difficult com
modity to come by. It is very hard to
reach anything close to dangerous
level of drunkenness by what is pro
vided there alone. It is generally be
cause of pre-gaming, something
which hosts are hard-pressed to esti
mate, that unfortunate events occur.
Pre-gaming is something fraternities
can do little about and can know lit
tle about, yet it makes all the differ
ence.

It is important to keep in mind
that this is not written in an excusato
ry spirit. It is important for fraterni
ties to make sure that alcohol, when
consumed at their events, is con
sumed responsibly and safely. How
