# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## A 						problem in policy 
### D.S. Nelson 
Imagine that a man drinks a few
too many at a friend's place, then
goes to a bar around the corner.
When he passes by the door, he's fine
so far as anyone who hasn't been
with him can tell. The alcohol has yet
to make its mark. His BAC would
probably be nothing too alarming.
Imagine further that a bartender
gives him a drink while he seems rel
atively sober. Then he returns a little
later, still seeming within his bounds,
and the bartender, who obviously
has difficulty perceiving a total
stranger's mental state, a difficulty
compounded by the blaring music,
darkness of the room and sheer mass
of people who need to be tended to,
gives him another drink.Then, imag
ine that this man needs to go to the
hospital for alcohol poisoning is
this the fault of the bartender, or of
the bouncer? Could they really do
more than they did?
Imagine someone comes to your
house after "pre-gaming," helps
themselves to a drink from your re
frigerator, and then after some time

the alcohol catches up with her and
she is sick. Are you responsible for
having failed to monitor her intake,
even though there is no way you
could have known how much she
had drank before she arrived? Imag
ine someone doesn't pregame at all,
but has her friends go and get drinks
for him from the bar all night. A bar
tender only directly serves him one
drink. If he were hospitalized, would
we say the blame rests on the shoul
ders of the server, or of the guest who
did not know her limits and the
friends who did not care to impose
them?

In every case it seems unfair to
hold the hosts of parties culpable for
the mistakes of their guests when it
comes to alcohol. It is after all, a drug
that takes time to have an effect, af
fects people in different and non-ob
vious ways, and often is consumed in
a setting that makes it difficult to
keep track of any given person's in
take. It seems harsh indeed, in light
of these realities, that fraternities are
generally held responsible for peo

pie who act irresponsibly with alco
hol. Everyone knows that at an all
campus party, the sheer weight of the
crowd makes alcohol a difficult com
modity to come by. It is very hard to
reach anything close to dangerous
level of drunkenness by what is pro
vided there alone. It is generally be
cause of pre-gaming, something
which hosts are hard-pressed to esti
mate, that unfortunate events occur.
Pre-gaming is something fraternities
can do little about and can know lit
tle about, yet it makes all the differ
ence.

It is important to keep in mind
that this is not written in an excusato
ry spirit. It is important for fraterni
ties to make sure that alcohol, when
consumed at their events, is con
sumed responsibly and safely. How

ever, when we remember the above
and add to that the difficulty of hav
ing nearly 2,000 new students who
have had varying levels of exposure
to alcohol, we must recognize the
difficulty of doing so. Fraternities
who take pride in themselves take
great care to prevent accidents, pro
tect their guests and foster a positive
environment for everyone to enjoy
themselves in. Confusion, chance
and complex situations for laxness
are unfortunately common.
The policies of the University dis
courage fraternities from providing
a resource of broad and widely ac
knowledgeable value: they offer an
open place for everyone to come
and relax. While this may be lost on
freshmen, surely sophomores and
upperclassmen recognize that after
freshman year, campus life be
comes much more fractious. People
socialize with the same groups and
the mixing of circles, an integral
part of what makes freshman year
so exciting, slows to a grind. Dorm
parties must control their atten
dance and are spread primarily
through the same channels to the
same people. As we move forward,
we limit our social circles. We go
deeper into our major, taking class
es with smaller range of appeal. We
spend less time with new dorm
mates and more time with old

friends. We have fraternities to
thank for providing what counter
balance they can to that circum
scribing trend. Fraternity parties
offer students the opportunity to
gather en masse. They are the social
equivalent of a football game all
are brought together in a loose en
vironment and are given the free
dom to make friends, explore and
engage with others who they would
otherwise not meet.

Fraternities are punished very
harshly for mistakes, but the fact re
mains that punishing someone for
something that is out of their con
trol and that they are direly try
ing to assess and correct does
not address, much less ameliorate,
the problem at hand. Punishing fra
ternities like this only dissuades
them from opening their doors to
our campus. It sponsors an exclu
sion based not in a desire to be ex
clusive, but a desire to be safe and
maintain their good standing. Stan
ford's fraternities make a larger ef
fort than any I know of to keep their
parties open to the public, to provide
as much as they can to the student
body and to sponsor an environ
ment that is both enjoyable and
healthful. It sometimes remains,
however, that our fraternities are
held accountable for matters out of
their hands with very high conse
quences.

not address, much less ameliorate,
the problem at hand. Punishing fra

parties open to the public, to provide
as much as they can to the student

however, that our fraternities are
held accountable for matters out of
their hands with very high conse
quences.

Imagine that a man drinks a few
too many at a friend's place, then
goes to a bar around the corner.
When he passes by the door, he's fine
so far as anyone who hasn't been
with him can tell. The alcohol has yet
to make its mark. His BAC would
probably be nothing too alarming.
Imagine further that a bartender
gives him a drink while he seems rel
atively sober. Then he returns a little
later, still seeming within his bounds,
and the bartender, who obviously
has difficulty perceiving a total
stranger's mental state, a difficulty
compounded by the blaring music,
darkness of the room and sheer mass
of people who need to be tended to,
gives him another drink.Then, imag
ine that this man needs to go to the
hospital for alcohol poisoning is
this the fault of the bartender, or of
the bouncer? Could they really do
more than they did?
Imagine someone comes to your
house after "pre-gaming," helps
themselves to a drink from your re
frigerator, and then after some time

the alcohol catches up with her and
she is sick. Are you responsible for
having failed to monitor her intake,
even though there is no way you
could have known how much she
had drank before she arrived? Imag
ine someone doesn't pregame at all,
but has her friends go and get drinks
for him from the bar all night. A bar
tender only directly serves him one
drink. If he were hospitalized, would
we say the blame rests on the shoul
ders of the server, or of the guest who
did not know her limits and the
friends who did not care to impose
them?

In every case it seems unfair to
hold the hosts of parties culpable for
the mistakes of their guests when it
comes to alcohol. It is after all, a drug
that takes time to have an effect, af
fects people in different and non-ob
vious ways, and often is consumed in
a setting that makes it difficult to
keep track of any given person's in
take. It seems harsh indeed, in light
of these realities, that fraternities are
generally held responsible for peo

pie who act irresponsibly with alco
hol. Everyone knows that at an all
campus party, the sheer weight of the
crowd makes alcohol a difficult com
modity to come by. It is very hard to
reach anything close to dangerous
level of drunkenness by what is pro
vided there alone. It is generally be
cause of pre-gaming, something
which hosts are hard-pressed to esti
mate, that unfortunate events occur.
Pre-gaming is something fraternities
can do little about and can know lit
tle about, yet it makes all the differ
ence.

It is important to keep in mind
that this is not written in an excusato
ry spirit. It is important for fraterni
ties to make sure that alcohol, when
consumed at their events, is con
sumed responsibly and safely. How

ever, when we remember the above
and add to that the difficulty of hav
ing nearly 2,000 new students who
have had varying levels of exposure
to alcohol, we must recognize the
difficulty of doing so. Fraternities
who take pride in themselves take
great care to prevent accidents, pro
tect their guests and foster a positive
environment for everyone to enjoy
themselves in. Confusion, chance
and complex situations for laxness
are unfortunately common.
The policies of the University dis
courage fraternities from providing
a resource of broad and widely ac
knowledgeable value: they offer an
open place for everyone to come
and relax. While this may be lost on
freshmen, surely sophomores and
upperclassmen recognize that after
freshman year, campus life be
comes much more fractious. People
socialize with the same groups and
the mixing of circles, an integral
part of what makes freshman year
so exciting, slows to a grind. Dorm
parties must control their atten
dance and are spread primarily
through the same channels to the
same people. As we move forward,
we limit our social circles. We go
deeper into our major, taking class
es with smaller range of appeal. We
spend less time with new dorm
mates and more time with old

friends. We have fraternities to
thank for providing what counter
balance they can to that circum
scribing trend. Fraternity parties
offer students the opportunity to
gather en masse. They are the social
equivalent of a football game all
are brought together in a loose en
