### STEPHEN TRUSHEIM '13 Student worker at the Office of Alcohol Policy Education 
OAPE and sober campus
culture

Dear Editor:
As a current Stanford junior who
has helped plan some of Stanford's
largest student events, from class
formals to Full Moon 2010 and the
recent Cataracs concert, I couldn't
be more excited thinking about the
potential that exists with the newly
created Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE). I think
that Monday's Editorial Board
piece ("Sobering up at the OAPE,"
Oct. 10) unfortunately missed the
mark.
There were around 300 students

(not a "few dozen") at the T.G.I.F.
event, the first of the Cardinal
Nights series. It was not designed to
be an "alcohol-free frat party," but
rather an enticing, low-stress night
for freshmen to hang out, play casi
no games outside Wilbur and con
nect with new friends. Last Friday,
OAPE put on another event: a com
edy and bingo night; over one hun
dred students attended, watched
the SIMPs, and enjoyed themselves.
But, looking to the future,
OAPE doesn't exist to plan fun for
students; it wants to plan fun with
students. Cardinal Nights from
OAPE is one of a whole series of
new initiatives focused on alcohol
abuse education and prevention,

and it is designed to empower stu
dents, student groups and people
with great ideas (like your class
presidents and Frosh Council) to re
alize their non-alcoholic events for
the whole campus on Friday and
Saturday nights. By next quarter, we
hope to have a Cardinal Night every
"party" night, initiated by students
and planned in collaboration with
the experience and resources of
University staff.
A great example of this kind of
thinking was the Cataracs concert
that kicked-off the year with about
1,800 attendees. The University
worked with a group of students, in
