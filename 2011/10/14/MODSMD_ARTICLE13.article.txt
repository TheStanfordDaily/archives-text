# LETTER TO THE EDITOR

### STEPHEN TRUSHEIM '13 Student worker at the Office of Alcohol Policy Education 
OAPE and sober campus
culture

Dear Editor:
As a current Stanford junior who
has helped plan some of Stanford's
largest student events, from class
formals to Full Moon 2010 and the
recent Cataracs concert, I couldn't
be more excited thinking about the
potential that exists with the newly
created Office of Alcohol Policy
and Education (OAPE). I think
that Monday's Editorial Board
piece ("Sobering up at the OAPE,"
Oct. 10) unfortunately missed the
mark.
There were around 300 students

(not a "few dozen") at the T.G.I.F.
event, the first of the Cardinal
Nights series. It was not designed to
be an "alcohol-free frat party," but
rather an enticing, low-stress night
for freshmen to hang out, play casi
no games outside Wilbur and con
nect with new friends. Last Friday,
OAPE put on another event: a com
edy and bingo night; over one hun
dred students attended, watched
the SIMPs, and enjoyed themselves.
But, looking to the future,
OAPE doesn't exist to plan fun for
students; it wants to plan fun with
students. Cardinal Nights from
OAPE is one of a whole series of
new initiatives focused on alcohol
abuse education and prevention,

and it is designed to empower stu
dents, student groups and people
with great ideas (like your class
presidents and Frosh Council) to re
alize their non-alcoholic events for
the whole campus on Friday and
Saturday nights. By next quarter, we
hope to have a Cardinal Night every
"party" night, initiated by students
and planned in collaboration with
the experience and resources of
University staff.
A great example of this kind of
thinking was the Cataracs concert
that kicked-off the year with about
1,800 attendees. The University
worked with a group of students, in
eluding myself, to create a frame
work and a budget for a totally un
precedented beginning to the year.
We took the reins to make the
event popular, fun and memorable,
and were supported every step of
the way by professional staff. If I
have a vision for how we could
make a "concerted effort" for fun
on this campus, it looks a lot like
this.

We won't get every event right,
but I hope we let ourselves experi
ment occasionally as we create
events for every weekend night. We
don't want events that just appeal
to non-drinkers, either. We hope to
create a campus atmosphere where
even the hardest-core rager will be
enticed to take a break once in a
while. Most exciting, we want to
create that atmosphere by having

more large campus traditions of all
kinds from alcohol-free parties
(think Maus and Full Moon), to
comedy nights, viewing parties and
everything in between.
If you're interested in joining
this effort, get some friends, or
maybe your student group, togeth
er to plan a Cardinal Night and
apply (oape.stanford.edu/nights). If
you've got ideas for big moves
(anything that could become the
Full Moon of winter or spring quar
ter), send me an email; a student
programming board is convening
with representatives from the
ASSU and major student groups to
develop and implement new cam
pus traditions. We need your input.
Please note: I am employed by
OAPE as of Monday, and I look
forward to planning and supporting
more campus-wide fun. My opin
ions are, however, my own.
