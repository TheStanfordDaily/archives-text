## GUTCHECK TIME Field hockey hopeful with title in reach 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite suffering a tough loss at the hands of
then-No. 12 New Hampshire last weekend, the
No. 9 Stanford field hockey team is in good posi
tion to lock up the NorPac West Division regular
season title if it can get past Pacific and Califor
nia in its two conference clashes this weekend.
The Cardinal (10-2, 3-0 NorPac) is the lone
undefeated team through the first half of confer
ence action and tied the school record with nine
consecutive victories after knocking off Harvard
last Friday in Boston. But in its quest for a 10th
win, Stanford's offense couldn't quite keep up
with a high-powered New Hampshire squad on
the road, dropping its first match since late Au
gust.

"Our game against New Hampshire came at a
good point in our season," said sophomore at
tacker Hope Burke, "because 1 think we were
riding high on the national attention we were get
ting. Losing a game against a top-10 opponent
was humbling and showed us that there are areas
of our game that we still need to work on. Ulti
mately, we lost because we weren't connecting as
a team, and we just chose a bad day to have a bad
game."

The team's first chance for redemption will be
at home against Pacific (2-9,0-4), which has been
struggling all season long. Stanford has won the
last 10 matches in the all-time series, with the last
game going the Cardinal's way by a wide margin,
4-0 on the road on Sept. 17.
But on Sunday, Stanford will need to be firing
on all cylinders for the annual trip to face off
against No. 12 Cal (11-2, 2-1) in Berkeley. The
Golden Bears must win in order to stay alive in
the conference race, but have the offensive fire
power to do so, having scored 10 goals twice this
season and averaging four goals per game.
Once again, however, Stanford has owned the
most recent meetings between the two rivals
winning eight of the last 11 matches but
Burke cautioned against looking past either
team.

"This weekend is extremely important in set
ting our team up for postseason success," she
said. "Pacific and Cal always bring their best

games when we play each other and this week
end will be a good test for us, especially coming
off of a loss last weekend."

Sunday is also Senior Day in Berkeley, which
should make for a very hostile environment. The
Cardinal will likely turn to junior defender
Becky Dru, who, despite the position she plays,
has been the team's most reliable weapon on of
fense. Dru last season's NorPac Defensive
Player of the Year has a team-high 11 goals,
and has been particularly successful on penalty
corners.

But equally important will be slowing down
Cal's sophomore sensation, forward Andrea
Earle, After seeing a very solid debut as a fresh
man last season, Earle has burst onto the scene
with 12 goals this year.
Burke said that the team has really been fo
cusing on getting off to a good start, something
Stanford couldn't do in the loss to New Hamp
shire.

"It's always tough playing a team at their own
turf, and of course it's going to be even harder on
Sunday since it's against Cal; but I think that the
key to our success will be to establish confidence
early on," Burke said. "I think it would be bene
ficial for us to move the ball around early on to
get into the rhythm of the game and hopefully
capitalize on our opportunities. If we can come
out strong and stay solid throughout the game, I
have no doubt that we will be successful."

After this weekend, the Cardinal will have
just three games remaining the final confer
ence match against UC-Davis during Homecom
ing Weekend, and two crucial road tests at Michi
gan and Michigan State to close out the regular
season schedule.

Friday's match against Pacific is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m. at the Artificial Turf Field.

Stanford sophomore Hope Burke has been a key contributor during the field hockey team's run
through NorPac play. Last weekend's loss at New Hampshire halted the Card's nine-game winning
streak, but No. 9 Stanford will close in on a postseason berth with a strong showing this weekend.
