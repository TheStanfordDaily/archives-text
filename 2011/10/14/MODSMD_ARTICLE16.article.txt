# SINGLE-GAME STOP AT ASU
## NO. 1 CARD TAKES AIM AT SUN DEVILS 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal enjoyed a week of impressive
wins, streaks and milestones, all of which the
squad will look to extend as it travels to Arizona
State tonight.

Head coach Paul Ratcliffe won his 200th
game last weekend as No. 1 Stanford (13-0-1,5-0
Pac-12) won in impressive fashion over USC and
No. 3 UCLA. The Card currently enjoys a 57-
game regular-season unbeaten streak, a perfect
stretch of 43 consecutive home victories and 25
straight conference wins.
The Sun Devils (6-7-0, 2-3-0) are currently
eighth in the Pac-12 and split their most recent
series, falling to No. 18 Oregon State 2-1 before
defeating Oregon 4-0.
Stanford opened its conference play by de
stroying Arizona 7-0. However, the Cardinal
nearly fell on its ensuing road trip to the average
Washington and Washington State, escaping with
a pair of 1-0 wins on late goals.

Ratcliffe doesn't believe the team will over
look the under-matched Sun Devils.

"Every game is a hard game, you can't take any
one lightly, and if we play our best and keep
everyone healthy, we'll see what happens in the
rest of the Pac-12," he said.
Last weekend's offensive explosion should be
an encouragement for a team that, besides the

rout of the Wildcats, had rarely won by wide mar
gins this year. Interestingly enough, though Stan
ford was outshot by the Bruins last Sunday,
marking the first time this season the Cardinal
did not end a match leading in that category. The
tally may not be indicative of the team's perform

ance, however.

"I didn't notice that," said junior defender Alina
Garciamendez. "But UCLA is a very good team,
you have to give them credit for that they did
well."

After Arizona State, the Cardinal only has
five games remaining before the postseason; all
five are against lower-ranked Pac-12 opponents,
culminating in a matchup with Cal on Nov. 5.
Stanford will try to wrap up its third consecutive
conference title before turning its attention to
the NCAA Tournament.

Ratcliffe, the team's coach for the past eight
years, has now won 201 games and has taken the
team to the postseason every year as head
coach; however, he has yet to bring a champi
onship to the Farm. The team has lost in the na
tional championship game for the past two
years in a row.

The Cardinal cannot afford to look ahead yet,
though. Ratcliffe hopes to keep the squad in tune
this week.

"I think we need to learn from [the UCLA]
game a little bit," Ratcliffe said. "I think I want to
see the speed of play increase a little bit, just from
the first 15 to 20 minutes, but we'll keep doing
things like business as usual, keeping everyone
sharp, and we're excited to play Friday at Ari
zona State."
The game will be televised nationally on Fox Soc
cer at 7 p.m. Friday.
