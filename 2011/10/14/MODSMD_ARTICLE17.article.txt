It's hard out here for a writer ma
joring in psychology. I'm what
the good folks in touch with the
job market refer to as "unem
ployable." Thanks, guys!

I went to the career fair last week
in White Plaza. It was a mistake.
Thrusting myself, a guy with no coding
skills, into a pool of Silicon Valley re
cruiters reminded me of the time my
friends and I tried to get from the air
port in Managua, Nicaragua, to a
coastal surf spot where we would
spend the next two weeks. Our driver
didn't show up at the airport. We did
n't speak Spanish. We didn't get to the
beach. Instead, we were stopped in
our unmarked taxi by a police officer
armed with an AK-47 and looked to
be heading for a world of hurt until
our English-speaking driver, who had
slept through his alarm, miraculously
intercepted us. It was horrifying.

At the career fair, I had a similar
experience. The fuzzy employers did
n't show up. I didn't get a job. I don't
speak computer languages. I didn't get
rescued. And although there were no
guns, it was equally horrifying.
So this past weekend, I found my
self in a quarter-life crisis. Doing as I
normally do in times of duress, I wast
ed time by checking out the lines of
this weekend's games, because what is
a better picker-upper than a "STAN
FORD - 20-something" flashing
across your screen? The Cardinal was
1-11 in 2007. For passionate fans, a -20-
something line is like kissing Brook
lyn Decker under a double-rainbow.
(Hi, Andy.)
As it currently stands, Stanford is
favored by 20.5 points on the road
against Washington State. If you ask
this guy, that spread is a bit insulting.
The Card tops the conference in every
major defensive statistic and boasts
one of the nation's top scoring offens
es. Is Wazzu better than it was in recent
seasons? Absolutely. Is Stanford
fewer than three touchdowns better
than Wazzu? Child, please.

That's when I remembered that
this is America, and in America we
gamble! Why not exploit the disre
spect for this fine institution and turn
it into some cash that will eventually
be funneled toward my inevitable trip
to law school. At this point you're ask
ing, "But Zach, you know that sports
betting requires an advanced knowl
edge of numbers and probability,
right?"

Relax, I took Stats 60. How are
these for some numbers?

Stanford is one of only two teams
with a perfect record (5-0) against the
spread (ATS) this season. The other,
Rutgers, is in uncharted territory, hav
ing finished last season with a 2-9
record ATS. Meanwhile, Stanford's
success continues to be regarded as a
fluke in the betting world, its current
ly undefeated season following a 7-4-
1 mark ATS in 2010.

How many teams have a better
record ATS than Stanford since the
start of the 2010 season? That would
be a whopping total of two: Okla
homa State and Hawaii. I can't finish
this column without first giving credit
to those two teams for being impossi
ble to read. Both possess dynamic of
fenses that have been nearly impossi
ble to stop for the majority of my life
time. Yeah, the defenses will occasion
ally give up 30- and 40-point perform
ances to opposing squads. But who
cares when you can routinely light up
the scoreboard with half-century
marks?

That said, this is my future I'm wa
gering. I can't afford to see my chil
dren's college funds go up in flames
because Hawaii let Fresno State score
60 points on a Thursday night game.
Oklahoma State could have easily put
up 100 points at some point this sea
son, but the Cowboys pulled starting
quarterback Brandon Weeden in the
second quarter of last week's game
against Kansas. After the first quarter,
Oklahoma State was on pace to score
140 points. If I'm gambling my rent,
the starters have to play into the sec
ond half.
A team has to be more reliable on
both sides of the ball if not only for the
sake of predictability. With that guide
line, find me a better team to bet on
than one that is top 10 in total offense
and total defense, has arguably
