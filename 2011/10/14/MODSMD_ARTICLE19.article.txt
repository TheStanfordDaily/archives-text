CELEBRITY TWITTERS
With every celebrity and their mom on Twitter these days,
Intermission picked out several diamonds in the 140-char
acter rough that you should follow.
@BarackObama
With updates on current legislation and White House event
updates, at the least, keeping up with Obama's tweets will
make you feel a little less guilty for the hours spent procrasti
nating on social networking sites. Maybe.

@ladygaga
The most followed account on Twitter with some 14,469,740
followers (as of publication time), Lady Gaga shows all of the
passion and social awareness evident in her art, minus the
freaky costumes. From her outrage over teen bullying, to her
appreciation for the "little monsters," to her career philoso
phy, Gaga is as expressive as the music that she produces.

@SHAQ
With an about me line that reads, "VERY QUOTATIOUS, I
PERFORM RANDOM ACTS OF SHAQNESS," how could
you not follow this 300-plus-pound hunk of man? O'Neal has
plenty to say about college football ("watch da tigers eat
duck sooflay"), career aspirations ("I wanna b a chris brown
back up dancer") and appreciation for the chance to speak
his clever mind ("u complete me twitter, lol").

@KimKardashian
With Kim, everything deserves exclamation, from her modest
travel plans ("Wow I'm in such awe over Dubai! My hotel is so
insane, can't wait to do some blogs & show u guys! Too much
to tweet! I'm obsessed with Dubai!"), to her humble personal
life ("Finally my fairytale wedding airs tonight at 9pm on E!!!!
Please tune in tonight and experience the magic!").

@ochocinco
The New England Patriots wide receiver and self-made reality
television star is no Twitter noob his 30,000+ tweets outdo
both Time and CNN's accounts. With personal musings like ("If
I'm on ur fantasy team don't trade me, I always start slow, I did
n't lose my virginity until my sr yr. I kept trying so stick with
me," there's never a dull moment with Number 85.
