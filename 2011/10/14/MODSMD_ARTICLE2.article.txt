## ANDREW LUCK AIMS TO WIN AIR BATTLE AT WASHINGTON STATE 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford football team travels
away from the Farm for the first time in two
weeks on Saturday, heading north to Pull
man, Wash, to tangle with a resurgent
Washington State team in another Pac-12
showdown.
The No. 7 Cardinal (5-0,3-0 Pac-12) has
rolled over conference opponents two
weeks in a row, but the Cougars (3-2,1-1)
present a powerful aerial challenge which
will test the Cardinal's sixth-ranked de
fense in away that it hasn't been tested be
fore.
The Cougars boast the country's sev
enth-best passing attack, throwing for over
350 yards and scoring more than 40 points
per game. Those eye-popping stats haven't
necessarily translated into wins, though, as
the Cougars lost 42-24 to San Diego State
in week three, then blew an eight-point
lead last week to fall to UCLA, 28-25.
For many casual Pac-12 observers, those
passing numbers will be particularly shock
ing because the Cougars were the longtime
laughing stock of the Pac-10, winning only
five games over the past three years. The
Cardinal has also won its last three
matchups against Wazzu, including an em
barrassing 58-0 blowout win at home in
2008. But these certainly aren't your
(slightly) older brother's Cougars, and the
Stanford defense understands the task at
hand.
"Their record doesn't show it, but the
two games they've lost I believe have been
close games," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "They're definitely playing hard

er, they're playing more physical, their tal
ent is just as much as any other team in the
Pac-12."
Head coach David Shaw attributed the
Cougars' new bite to head coach Paul
