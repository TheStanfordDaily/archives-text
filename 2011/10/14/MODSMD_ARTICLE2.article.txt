## ANDREW LUCK AIMS TO WIN AIR BATTLE AT WASHINGTON STATE 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford football team travels
away from the Farm for the first time in two
weeks on Saturday, heading north to Pull
man, Wash, to tangle with a resurgent
Washington State team in another Pac-12
showdown.
The No. 7 Cardinal (5-0,3-0 Pac-12) has
rolled over conference opponents two
weeks in a row, but the Cougars (3-2,1-1)
present a powerful aerial challenge which
will test the Cardinal's sixth-ranked de
fense in away that it hasn't been tested be
fore.
The Cougars boast the country's sev
enth-best passing attack, throwing for over
350 yards and scoring more than 40 points
per game. Those eye-popping stats haven't
necessarily translated into wins, though, as
the Cougars lost 42-24 to San Diego State
in week three, then blew an eight-point
lead last week to fall to UCLA, 28-25.
For many casual Pac-12 observers, those
passing numbers will be particularly shock
ing because the Cougars were the longtime
laughing stock of the Pac-10, winning only
five games over the past three years. The
Cardinal has also won its last three
matchups against Wazzu, including an em
barrassing 58-0 blowout win at home in
2008. But these certainly aren't your
(slightly) older brother's Cougars, and the
Stanford defense understands the task at
hand.
"Their record doesn't show it, but the
two games they've lost I believe have been
close games," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "They're definitely playing hard

er, they're playing more physical, their tal
ent is just as much as any other team in the
Pac-12."
Head coach David Shaw attributed the
Cougars' new bite to head coach Paul

NOTES ! Stanford's secondary will face its toughest
test yet against a potent Washington State offense,
which has thrown for over 300 yards per game
despite the early-season loss of junior starting
quarterback Jeff Tuel to injury.


Wulff, who took over the Washington
State job in 2008 after leading an FCS
program, Eastern Washington, to
seven winning season in eight years.
"He's a heck of a coach;he's a good
recruiter, spending time with him at
our Pac-12 media days you can kind of
see how he gets the guys to play,"
Shaw said. "He's a tough guy, a tough
minded guy, and you've seen the last
two years the progression of disci
pline. They're a more disciplined team
than they've ever been. You've got to
give him all the credit in the world,
he's done a great job."
But perhaps the most impressive
part of the Cougars' offensive stats is
the fact that the offense has been
working at all this season. Junior quar
terback Jeff Tuel, the returning starter
from 2010, fractured his left clavicle in
the season's first game, forcing senior
backup Marshall Lobbestael into the
starter's role. Since then, Lobbestael
has looked like anything but the un
derstudy, though, throwing for 1,544
yards and 15 touchdowns while com
pleting 65.4 percent of his passes.
Tuel has been cleared to play this
weekend against the Cardinal, throw
ing an extra wrinkle into the game
plan for the Cougars' spread offense.
Although Lobbestael has been as
sured the starting spot, Shaw said he
had spent some time preparing for
both passers.

"You mainly prepare for the of
fense, but both guys have things that
they do well, so we've got to be ready
for both of them," Shaw said.

He also mentioned that the air
based attack would be a good measur
ing stick for a Stanford defense that
has yet to face a team with a powerful
wide-open offense.
"I think we've been tested pretty
well; after the game you don't say so
because you look at the stats," Shaw
said. "But this is going to be a true test
for us. Can we get to the quarterback;
can we play well in pass coverage; can
we mix it up between coverage and
pressure? It's going to be a good test
for our defense."
The Stanford defensive backs have
lived up to all comers so far, playing a
critical role in a defense that allows
just 10.6 points per game, and the cor
ners and safeties had their best half of
football so far last week against Col
orado, only allowing three comple
tions for 18 yards and also snagging
the first interception of the season.
But despite last week's good per
formance, Thomas mentioned that

the defense had a little extra motiva
tion to play well after being roughed
up in last year's contest at home
against the Cougars, where Tuel threw
for four touchdowns including two
in the last four minutes of the game
against the Stanford secondary.
"Just speaking for the secondary,
we definitely see this as a challenge for
us, and it's probably going to be the
best receiving corps we see all sea
son," Thomas said. "We're not over
looking them; we don't have to get a
pep talk to get up for this team, espe
cially after the type of fourth quarter
we had against them last year where
they just exploded on us, so we feel
like we have something to prove
against them."
Thomas also pointed out Washing
ton State sophomore wide receiver
Marquess Wilson as a particular target
of interest for the defense, as Wilson
has 31 catches for 638 yards and five
touchdowns this year, just a step
ahead of Isiah Barton (four touch
downs) and Jared Karsetter (three).
"They look explosive; [Wilson]
looks explosive as ever,"Thomas said.
"He definitely had a great game
against us last year and we remember
that... and the rest of their receivers
are just as good."
Stanford will try to contain Wash
ington State on Saturday at 4:30 p.m.
in Pullman, Wash. Television coverage
will be on the Versus network.

they do well, so we've got to be ready
for both of them," Shaw said.

He also mentioned that the air
based attack would be a good measur
ing stick for a Stanford defense that
has yet to face a team with a powerful
wide-open offense.
"I think we've been tested pretty
well; after the game you don't say so
because you look at the stats," Shaw
said. "But this is going to be a true test
for us. Can we get to the quarterback;
can we play well in pass coverage; can
we mix it up between coverage and
pressure? It's going to be a good test
for our defense."
The Stanford defensive backs have
lived up to all comers so far, playing a
critical role in a defense that allows
just 10.6 points per game, and the cor
ners and safeties had their best half of
football so far last week against Col
orado, only allowing three comple
tions for 18 yards and also snagging
the first interception of the season.
But despite last week's good per
formance, Thomas mentioned that

the defense had a little extra motiva
tion to play well after being roughed
up in last year's contest at home
against the Cougars, where Tuel threw
for four touchdowns including two
in the last four minutes of the game
against the Stanford secondary.
"Just speaking for the secondary,
we definitely see this as a challenge for
us, and it's probably going to be the
best receiving corps we see all sea
son," Thomas said. "We're not over
looking them; we don't have to get a
pep talk to get up for this team, espe
cially after the type of fourth quarter
we had against them last year where
they just exploded on us, so we feel
like we have something to prove
against them."
Thomas also pointed out Washing
ton State sophomore wide receiver
Marquess Wilson as a particular target
of interest for the defense, as Wilson
has 31 catches for 638 yards and five
touchdowns this year, just a step
ahead of Isiah Barton (four touch
downs) and Jared Karsetter (three).
"They look explosive; [Wilson]
looks explosive as ever,"Thomas said.
"He definitely had a great game
against us last year and we remember
that... and the rest of their receivers
are just as good."
Stanford will try to contain Wash
ington State on Saturday at 4:30 p.m.
in Pullman, Wash. Television coverage
will be on the Versus network.

Redshirt junior Andrew Luck has done nothing but produce in his third year as Stanford's starting quarterback.The
preseason Heisman candidate has thrown for over 1,350 yards with 14 touchdowns, and he could get even more
against the Cougars.

The Stanford football team travels
away from the Farm for the first time in two
weeks on Saturday, heading north to Pull
man, Wash, to tangle with a resurgent
Washington State team in another Pac-12
showdown.
The No. 7 Cardinal (5-0,3-0 Pac-12) has
rolled over conference opponents two
weeks in a row, but the Cougars (3-2,1-1)
present a powerful aerial challenge which
will test the Cardinal's sixth-ranked de
fense in away that it hasn't been tested be
fore.
The Cougars boast the country's sev
enth-best passing attack, throwing for over
350 yards and scoring more than 40 points
per game. Those eye-popping stats haven't
necessarily translated into wins, though, as
the Cougars lost 42-24 to San Diego State
in week three, then blew an eight-point
lead last week to fall to UCLA, 28-25.
For many casual Pac-12 observers, those
passing numbers will be particularly shock
ing because the Cougars were the longtime
laughing stock of the Pac-10, winning only
five games over the past three years. The
Cardinal has also won its last three
matchups against Wazzu, including an em
barrassing 58-0 blowout win at home in
2008. But these certainly aren't your
(slightly) older brother's Cougars, and the
Stanford defense understands the task at
hand.
"Their record doesn't show it, but the
two games they've lost I believe have been
close games," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "They're definitely playing hard

er, they're playing more physical, their tal
ent is just as much as any other team in the
Pac-12."

Cougars' new bite to head coach Paul

NOTES ! Stanford's secondary will face its toughest
test yet against a potent Washington State offense,
which has thrown for over 300 yards per game
despite the early-season loss of junior starting
quarterback Jeff Tuel to injury.


Wulff, who took over the Washington
State job in 2008 after leading an FCS
program, Eastern Washington, to
seven winning season in eight years.
"He's a heck of a coach;he's a good
recruiter, spending time with him at
our Pac-12 media days you can kind of
see how he gets the guys to play,"
Shaw said. "He's a tough guy, a tough
minded guy, and you've seen the last
two years the progression of disci
pline. They're a more disciplined team
than they've ever been. You've got to
give him all the credit in the world,
he's done a great job."
But perhaps the most impressive
part of the Cougars' offensive stats is
the fact that the offense has been
working at all this season. Junior quar
terback Jeff Tuel, the returning starter
from 2010, fractured his left clavicle in
the season's first game, forcing senior
backup Marshall Lobbestael into the
starter's role. Since then, Lobbestael
has looked like anything but the un
derstudy, though, throwing for 1,544
yards and 15 touchdowns while com
pleting 65.4 percent of his passes.
Tuel has been cleared to play this
weekend against the Cardinal, throw
ing an extra wrinkle into the game
plan for the Cougars' spread offense.
Although Lobbestael has been as
sured the starting spot, Shaw said he
had spent some time preparing for
both passers.

"You mainly prepare for the of
fense, but both guys have things that
they do well, so we've got to be ready
