The Stanford Theatre's fall program of classic American films
kicked off with a bang on Wednesday, first featuring the fantastic
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers 1930s musical, "Top Hat" (Oct.
12-14). Like most musicals, the plot is just an excuse for phenomenal
song-and-dance numbers set to many wonderful and famous Irving
Berlin tunes (like "Cheek to Cheek" and "Top Hat"), but this one does
have the best plot of the Astaire and Rogers films. As these films go, Astaire
and Rogers meet; he falls in love yet she hates him; he sings and dances his

way into her heart. Although the film was shot over 70
years ago, the dance numbers are still some of the best to
ever be captured on film. There's also the added pleasure
of hilariously terrible Venetian sets and the ever-helpful
butler Bates, who refers to himself in the plural as "we."
"The Gay Divorcee," another Astaire and Rogers picture, is
equally well packed with fabulous dance numbers, but its
lackluster plot makes it a close second to "Top Hat."
Robert Mulligans "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962, Oct
15-16) is another must-see. This reasonably faithful adapta
tion of Harper Lee's novel stars Gregory Peck in an Academy
Award-winning performance as Atticus Finch, upstanding
lawyer and loving father. Though the film leaves out some of
the best bits of the novel, Peck's strong performance more
than makes up for the exclusions.

December features two must-see Katharine
Hepburn films that remain inspirational to feminists
even today. John Huston's 1951 film, "African Queen"
(Dec. 3-4), pairs Hepburn with Humphrey Bogart, the
captain of a boat, to deliver mail during World War I.
When an enemy sets the local village on fire, Hepburn
escapes on Bogart's boat and decides they ought to attack
the enemy while they're at it. Her performance is more
mature than her earlier work, and the romance with
Bogart is surprisingly modem for the time.
The second Hepburn screening is the wonderful but
under-appreciated 1937 film, "Stage Door" (Dec. 14-16),
about aspiring Broadway actresses in a boardinghouse in
New York City. Ginger Rogers co-stars in a role that proves
she is, in fact, a serious actress. "Stage Door" is a wonderful
comedy with hilarious dialogue spoken by strong, gutsy
women that could equally well belong in contemporary
society.

Fans of Orson Welles can catch "The Third Man"
(1949) and "Citizen Kane" (1941) on Oct. 15 and 16. The

first is a classic of film noir and offers
a tour of 1940s Vienna, while
"Citizen Kane" is Orson Welles's
technical masterpiece in every way.
The Stanford Theatre will also
feature more cinematic classics
such as Frank Capra's "It
Happened One Night" (1934, Nov.
16-18) which features a naive
heiress (Claudette Colbert) and a
reporter (Clark Gable) who meet
on the road and eventually fall in
love. It's an outdated story but has
influenced films from "Roman
Holiday" with Gregory Peck and

Audrey Hepburn where it's a day in Rome and she's
a princess, not just an heiress to Rob Reiner's "The
Sure Thing" with John Cusack, also featuring a couple
who falls in love on the road.

And now the ones to avoid: "The Shop Around the
Corner" (1940, Dec. 21-23), on which Nora Ephron's
"You've Got Mail" is loosely based, is about a pair of lovers
(including James Stewart) who fall in love while writing
love letters to one another, unaware that they've already
met. It's too old-fashioned and corny to be bearable for a
modern audience, as is the 1934 film "Litde Women"
(Dec. 14-16) with Katharine Hepburn as Jo March. The
film is a melodramatic interpretation that takes all kinds
of liberties with the story and manages to completely

pluck out the revolutionary gutsiness
of Jo March, in which the heart of the

story lies.
Yes, you can rent most of these
from Green Fibrary, but seeing classic
films on the big screen is a completely
different experience: you won't be
interrupted by laundry or emails and
can get lost in the film instead. And if
you have to watch it for a class, seeing
it in the theater means you can't turn
it off halfway through, which for the
aspiring cinematic scholar can be rea
son enough to drag yourself out to
downtown Palo Alto to see it
