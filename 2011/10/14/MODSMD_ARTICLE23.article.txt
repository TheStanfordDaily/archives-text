## NOISE POP & ANOTHER PLANET ENTERTAINMENT PRESENT CREASURE ISLAND MUSIC FESTIVAL THE FESTIVAL IN THE BAY 
### â€“ marisa LANDICHO contact marisa: landicho@stanford. edu 
With the lights of its iconic Ferris
wheel splashing across the Bay,
Treasure Island will reclaim the

entertainment spotlight this weekend. For two
days, the artificial isle off San Francisco proper
will again play host to Treasure Island Music
Festival (TIMF), a small-scale bonanza of just
left-of-mainstream rock and dance. Most of all,
the local fest will give music-lovers a chance to
close the festival season with a fitting and inti
mate send-off.

Expect no surprises for the fifth take of
TIMF. Organizers Noise Pop and Another
Planet Entertainment have isolated their selling
points and marketed them efficiently. Day One
remains vaguely electronic, while Day Two tilts
toward indie rock with the headliners,

Empire of the Sun and Explosions in the Sky,
straddling both camps to tempt more two-day
ticket sales.

TIMF's smaller capacity makes it more of
a 26-course meal rather than the free-for-all

buffet of big-budget festival giants like
Coachella and Sasquatch. The musical offerings
are still diverse, but the manageable crowd size
gives the fog-wrapped island an idyllic, rather
than an imprisoning, air.
Through the weekend, 26 music acts will
ping-pong between two stages, allowing atten
dees to see each show without worrying about
the dreaded schedule conflict. TIMF remains
one of the only music festivals where it is actu
ally possible to see every act on the bill. And

the predictably fickle weather will make
embracing the group hustle to and from the
Bridge and Tunnel stages that much more wel
come.

Anchoring the festival are Australian duo
Empire of the Sun on Saturday night and high

school throwbacks Death Cab for Cutie on
Sunday. The former will rally with electro-pop
chords and the costume department of an 'Bos
science fiction movie; the latter will draw sing
alongs from the most reticent of onlookers,

though the Seattle band lacks some of the nos
talgic oomph of last year's festival closer, Belle
& Sebastian.
Their lead-in acts are equally as strong.
Dance-punk duo Death from Above 1979 is

finishing their reunion tour, obliterating the
memory of their five-year split with a reani
mated "You're a Woman, I'm a Machine." DFA
1979 will benefit from the funkadelic endor
phins of synthesizer-friendly Chromeo and

Australian group Cut Copy, who lead the post
sundown charge on Day One. But, hands
down, the most apropos act for the venue will
be the atmospheric and extended jamming of
Explosions in the Sky on Sunday night.
Females anchor Sunday afternoon, from
the art rock of all-girl troupe Warpaint to

vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Annie Clark,
promoting the recent release of her third

album under the moniker St. Vincent.

Rounding out the trifecta is Victoria Legrand,
the ethereal voice behind dream-pop duo
Beach House's 2010 release, "Teen Dream."

Looking for something outside the alt
milieu? Head to the tribal rave set by Portugal's
Buraka Som Sistema on Saturday late after-

noon or chill out with the soul of Saturday
early-bird crooner Aloe Blacc.

In the event that the music fails to enter
tain, the views of the Golden Gate Bridge and
San Francisco skyline can fill the void that
or the Silent Disco, where attendees can satisfy
the need to be antisocial and dance ironically at
the same time.

Tickets are still available for both
Saturday and Sunday: $7O for a single-day

ticket and $125 for both days. With the late
start of Stanford's quarter, even midterms

won't be standing in the way of a weekend of
musical bliss.
