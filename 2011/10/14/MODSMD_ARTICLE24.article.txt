# WHOA THERE, SPACE COWBOY: LET'S WAIT AND SEE WITH

When I woke up last
Monday and saw news,
however vague, that
Mass Effect 3 would introduce an
online multiplayer component to
the series, I rolled my eyes a bit and
let out a gruff sigh. Not because I'm
sure it's a bad idea I'm most cer
tainly not but because from now
until the game's March release date,
a stubborn contingent of fans will
inevitably turn the Internet into its
Hall of Sorrows, moaning and
groaning about how developer
Bio Ware is losing its way, screwing
its customers, caving to publisher
pressure or ruining its own game.
Just head to Google News, pick any
site that's running the story and
you're bound to see a snowballing
mass of pretentious comments pro
claiming the downfall of one of this
generation's greatest franchises. To
quote a Game Informer user by the
name of, ahem, Spiro Conspiracy
Theorist:
"Oh God, no. Just because it's
mandatory for every shooter to
have doesn't mean you do, Mass
Effect! I see no way whatsoever that
this could BENEFIT the game, it's
clearly just a'hurr, 2011, gotsta have
mp' thing."
Hurr, indeed.
That comment is a pretty typ
ical one, and it's a damn shame.
Bio Ware has one of the most loyal
and supportive fan communities
in the world, but like any group
behind the great Web-veil of
anonymity, some of them might
overreact to change and uncer
tainty.
I can't pretend to know all the
details behind Mass Effect's foray
into multiplayer, the reasoning

behind it or how it will tie into the
final product. I can, though, take a
more levelheaded approach to this
week's news.
One of the chief complaints
about the announcement, as per
usual with this kind of thing, is that
Bio Ware is "diverting resources"
away from Mass Effect 3's cam
paign mode. If that were true, it
would be a larger transgression
than it might seem. Many gamers,
myself included, are so invested in
the still-unfolding sci-fi saga that
even the slightest lack of polish or
cohesion in the single-player story
could put them into a small exis
tential crisis. We're talking about

the sequel to the best
reviewed role-playing game
in most of these fans' life
times. It would be as if J.K.
Rowling "diverted resources"
from the main thrust of
"Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows" to ensure
that Harry & co. mentioned
Coke and Nike shoes at least
twice per chapter.
But while high expecta
tions are justified, concern is
not at least, not because
of today's announcement.
Bio Ware is an enormous
company and its parent,

Electronic Arts (EA), is even bigger.
They aren't going to take time-test
ed employees the guys and gals
that have cut their teeth on this

franchise for six years and tell
them to design online matchmak
ing algorithms. They don't need to.
Bio Ware and EA have enough coin
in the coffer to hire new employees
for just that purpose, and those job
listings are exactly the reason we've
heard rumors of Mass Effect multi
player floating around for months.
If anything, that's a sign of a
resource surplus, not a shortage.
Bio Ware knows how to make a
high-quality Mass Effect game, and
now it's spreading its time and

money into new areas.
Of course, the heavy financial
backing of EA will elicit its own
share of skeptical, anti-establish
ment reactions to Monday's news
specifically that Bio Ware is sell
ing out to mainstream, corporate
pressure. In some ways, the fear is
natural: EA is a giant, capable of
swallowing up developers like
Pop Cap for over a billon dollars
and firing dollar-stuffed missiles at
its biggest competition. But there is
another, more endearing side to EA
that I often feel gets lost behind
acquisitions, inflammatory state
ments and irritating online passes.
In the last five years, EA has spon

sored far more than its share of

quirky, original and financially
questionable titles: Brutal Legend,
Spore, Mirror's Edge, Dead Space,
Bulletstorm and even Shadows of
the Damned would all be stillborn
pipedreams if not for the
Behemoth of Redwood City. For all
its might, I posit that EA can still
recognize, respect and keep its

hands off a healthy intellectual
property especially when it sells
over two million copies in a week.
If EA did encourage Bio Ware to
include multiplayer, the safe bet is
that it was an addition, not an alter
ation, to the developer's plans. Hell,
on Xbox 360, the multiplayer will
probably be on its own separate

disc. Talk about non-intrusive.
Mass Effect is far from the first

series to incorporate multiplayer
after making a name for itself with
an engrossing story, and it's reason
able to assume that it will follow in
the footsteps of its predecessors.
Here's some familiar names:

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood,

Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow,
Uncharted 2, Bioshock 2, Metal

Gear Solid 3: Subsistence and Dead
Space 2 the list goes on. Critical
reception varied wildly for the mul
tiplayer component of these other
wise stellar titles, but one thing was
constant: it didn't interfere with the
single-player core of the game. If
you didn't like it, you didn't play it.
In some cases, the parallel
development of multiplayer may
actually improve a traditionally sin
gle-player game. Mass Effect could
reap the same benefits. A com
pelling co-op or competitive expe
rience requires higher fidelity and
variety in player-character anima
tions, level design and combat sce
narios than the series is generally
known for. Needless to say, some of
that work could bleed over to the

campaign, tightening it up under
the hood without overtly changing



the experience.
With something so cherished as Mass Effect, it's reasonable
to be apprehensive of change. But it's downright brash to so
quickly vilify a developer for trying something new, especially
when the ramifications are unclear. Yes, our connotation of
"online multiplayer" is quite different than what Mass Effect fans
are accustomed to. But concerned gamers need to take a step back
and remember that Bio Ware and EA are not faceless corporations
driven entirely by a bottom line; they might see money in multi
player, but we shouldn't expect them to get lazy with the cam
paign we know and love.
At the very least, I'd hope that Bio Ware fans could live up to
their classy reputation and reserve judgment until they play the
game in March. Until then, keep an open mind.
