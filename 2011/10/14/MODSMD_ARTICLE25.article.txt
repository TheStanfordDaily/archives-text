# STUFF WE LOVE: A SNEAK PEEK OF 'POTTERMORE'
## 
### â€“ andrea HINTON contact andrea: anhinton@stanford. edu 
Here in Intermission, we like to geek
out on "Harry Potter." Fortunately,
this has become more than socially
acceptable, judging from the millions of people
waiting in lines at midnight to snag seats to
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"
shrines of Rupert Grint that surely exist in
some 15 year-old's closet, etc.
When the book and film series finally
ended (a moment of silence, please, for all we
lost on July 15,2011), the sun seemed to be set
ting on the "Harry Potter" franchise. However,

we all know that J.K. Rowling wouldn't be where
she is without having a team of incredibly savvy
PR people. This, combined with her four-year
hiatus, probably should have alerted fans to the
fact that something was in the works.
This summer, Rowling announced her
newest project to the public, simply called
"Pottermore." With only a vague, paragraph
long description to work with, the most anyone
could deduce was that it was an interactive
website, which in itself sounds pretty boring.

But the real masterstroke was the decision
to make a beta website. Rowling announced that
one million people worldwide would have the
opportunity to explore Pottermore before the
site opens to the public at the end of October.
We all know "Harry Potter" fans are willing to
wait in a line from Buenos Aires to Beijing if it
means that they get a new "Harry Potter" item
first. All of a sudden, Pottermore became the
new "It" thing.

Fast forward sev
eral weeks, and I found
myself sitting in front
of a computer screen
on the final day of beta
week, trying to decide
if trying to get into
Pottermore would be
worth it. I figured I

might as well, went to
the website and hap
pened to find the
"magical quill," which
gave the clue to get
into the website, out of
its inkpot. A few min-

utes later, I was a member, and three weeks
later I was finally allowed into Pottermore.

Pottermore is best described as an interac
tive supplement to the Harry Potter series.
When users enter the website, they are present
ed with the "gateway," a winding trail that leads
through the every chapter of the seven books.
The first novel, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone," is available to beta users, and a click
leads to a crimson red plaque entitled,
"Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived."
Rowling picked several moments from

every chapter of the book to explore interac
tively. The first moment of the series, for

instant, is called "Number Four, Privet Drive"
a tabby cat perches next to a street sign in
the foreground, while zooming in shows a
cloudy November sky, a slowly revolving

weathervane and a homogenous row of hous
es. On the left hand side, clicking "Read About
Number Four, Privet Drive" reveals all you ever
wanted to know about where it all began:
Privet Drive as defined by the novels, as well a
short essay of Rowling's thoughts on why she
picked the name and number of the street.
This is Pottermore: the entirety of the series
as imagined by Rowling, uninfluenced by the
limits of technology. Though the eight Potter
films gave us a glimpse into Rowling's psyche,
Pottermore is perfect for fans who always won
dered how exactly the author envisioned the

Potions classroom or the Ravenclaw common

room. As a bonus, the illustrations are incredible;
they're highlight of the website by far.
There are also the dozens of pages that
Rowling wrote for the website, for readers
looking for even more backstory about their
favorite characters. "Sorcerer's Stone," for
instance, reveals the life of shady character
Quirinus Quirrell, as well as the surprisingly
romantic and painstakingly detailed story of
Minerva McGonagall.
If you care less for trivia, Pottermore is
also somewhat of a Facebook for Potter fans.
Users can like particular pages, comment on
supplementary information and add others as
friends; there's even a little owl in the top right
hand corner that shows notifications and a
newsfeed at the bottom of several pages.
The best part about Pottermore, though, is
the ability to follow Harry through his defining
moments. Users can go to Diagon Alley and
purchase a pet from Eeylops Owl Emporium &
Magical Menagerie (although Harry already
took their snowy owl), store money in
Gringotts Bank, or find wolfsbane at the
Apothecary. Ollivander's is down the street,
and after answering a few questions, Garrick
Ollivander himself will present you with a
wand. You can learn more about his back
ground or sort through the pages upon pages
of additional information from Rowling about
what your wand's core (unicorn hair, dragon
heartstring or phoenix feather), wood and flex
ibility say about you.
And finally, "Chapter 7: The

Sorting Hat" makes you a true Hogwarts stu
dent as you officially get sorted after some
ridiculously cryptic personality probes (but

hasn't every Potter fan wondered what house
they would be in?). After a video from Rowling
and an introduction from your house prefects,
users can earn points for their house and unite
with their fellow first-years.
Pottermore is nowhere near perfect to
be honest, there's not much to do once you've
sucked up an afternoon or two going through
"Sorcerer's Stone." You may have been satisfied
by the movies or are simply ready to move on
from a series of children's books. But for the lit
tle kids reading through the Potter novels for
the first time, Pottermore lets them finally be
just like Harry right down to the Hogwarts
letter in the mail.

Users can like particular pages, comment on
supplementary information and add others as
friends; there's even a little owl in the top right
hand corner that shows notifications and a
newsfeed at the bottom of several pages.
The best part about Pottermore, though, is
the ability to follow Harry through his defining
moments. Users can go to Diagon Alley and
purchase a pet from Eeylops Owl Emporium &
Magical Menagerie (although Harry already
took their snowy owl), store money in
Gringotts Bank, or find wolfsbane at the
Apothecary. Ollivander's is down the street,
and after answering a few questions, Garrick
Ollivander himself will present you with a
wand. You can learn more about his back
ground or sort through the pages upon pages
of additional information from Rowling about
what your wand's core (unicorn hair, dragon
heartstring or phoenix feather), wood and flex
ibility say about you.
And finally, "Chapter 7: The

Sorting Hat" makes you a true Hogwarts stu
dent as you officially get sorted after some
ridiculously cryptic personality probes (but

hasn't every Potter fan wondered what house
they would be in?). After a video from Rowling
and an introduction from your house prefects,
users can earn points for their house and unite
with their fellow first-years.
Pottermore is nowhere near perfect to
be honest, there's not much to do once you've
sucked up an afternoon or two going through
"Sorcerer's Stone." You may have been satisfied
by the movies or are simply ready to move on
from a series of children's books. But for the lit
tle kids reading through the Potter novels for
the first time, Pottermore lets them finally be
just like Harry right down to the Hogwarts
letter in the mail.



Here in Intermission, we like to geek
out on "Harry Potter." Fortunately,
this has become more than socially
acceptable, judging from the millions of people
waiting in lines at midnight to snag seats to
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"
shrines of Rupert Grint that surely exist in
some 15 year-old's closet, etc.
When the book and film series finally
ended (a moment of silence, please, for all we
lost on July 15,2011), the sun seemed to be set
ting on the "Harry Potter" franchise. However,

we all know that J.K. Rowling wouldn't be where
she is without having a team of incredibly savvy
PR people. This, combined with her four-year
hiatus, probably should have alerted fans to the
fact that something was in the works.
This summer, Rowling announced her
newest project to the public, simply called
"Pottermore." With only a vague, paragraph
long description to work with, the most anyone
could deduce was that it was an interactive
website, which in itself sounds pretty boring.

But the real masterstroke was the decision
to make a beta website. Rowling announced that
one million people worldwide would have the
opportunity to explore Pottermore before the
site opens to the public at the end of October.
We all know "Harry Potter" fans are willing to
wait in a line from Buenos Aires to Beijing if it
means that they get a new "Harry Potter" item
first. All of a sudden, Pottermore became the
new "It" thing.

Fast forward sev
eral weeks, and I found
myself sitting in front
of a computer screen
on the final day of beta
week, trying to decide
if trying to get into
Pottermore would be
worth it. I figured I

might as well, went to
the website and hap
pened to find the
"magical quill," which
gave the clue to get
into the website, out of
its inkpot. A few min-

utes later, I was a member, and three weeks
later I was finally allowed into Pottermore.

Pottermore is best described as an interac
tive supplement to the Harry Potter series.
When users enter the website, they are present
ed with the "gateway," a winding trail that leads
through the every chapter of the seven books.
The first novel, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone," is available to beta users, and a click
leads to a crimson red plaque entitled,
"Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived."
Rowling picked several moments from

every chapter of the book to explore interac
tively. The first moment of the series, for

instant, is called "Number Four, Privet Drive"
a tabby cat perches next to a street sign in
the foreground, while zooming in shows a
cloudy November sky, a slowly revolving

weathervane and a homogenous row of hous
es. On the left hand side, clicking "Read About
Number Four, Privet Drive" reveals all you ever
wanted to know about where it all began:
Privet Drive as defined by the novels, as well a
short essay of Rowling's thoughts on why she
picked the name and number of the street.
This is Pottermore: the entirety of the series
as imagined by Rowling, uninfluenced by the
limits of technology. Though the eight Potter
films gave us a glimpse into Rowling's psyche,
Pottermore is perfect for fans who always won
dered how exactly the author envisioned the

Potions classroom or the Ravenclaw common

room. As a bonus, the illustrations are incredible;
they're highlight of the website by far.
There are also the dozens of pages that
Rowling wrote for the website, for readers
looking for even more backstory about their
favorite characters. "Sorcerer's Stone," for
instance, reveals the life of shady character
Quirinus Quirrell, as well as the surprisingly
romantic and painstakingly detailed story of
Minerva McGonagall.
