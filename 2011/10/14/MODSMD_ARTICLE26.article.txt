## Author finds humanity in his sci-fi thriller 
### â€” sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
The turnout on Friday night
was phenomenal not
unexpected when the guest of
honor was Neal Stephenson, one of
the foremost science fiction writers of
our day. The staff at Kepler's had

pushed aside displays of books to
make room for rows upon rows of
folding chairs, but there was still a
crush of people sitting in the
makeshift aisles and standing in the
back. Stephenson, in formal, nonde
script black, took the podium amidst
vigorous applause and opened with a
succinct plot summary of "Reamde,"
his latest novel: "It's a lot of people
running around shooting each other."
It's that, and so much more.

"Reamde" is a techno-thriller

about a hostage crisis and an

MMORPG, about terrorism and

social networking. Stephenson read
an excerpt from the beginning of the
book, showcasing his characteristic
crackling prose and attention to
detail. The passage, which takes place
at a large family gathering, was filled
with wry observations on human
interaction, matter-of-fact violence,
exquisitely awkward encounters with
distant relatives and of course
shotguns. His delivery only added to
the effect; his deadpan sardonicism
was spot-on. He elicited much laugh
ter from the audience including
the sort of nervous chuckling that
betrayed how accurately his descrip
tion captures human foibles. He may
write speculative fiction, but his real
ism is spot-on.

The floor then opened for ques
tions, and nearly half the hands in the

audience went up. Stephenson dis
cussed the process of writing, his
impressive backlist and his views on
the genre of science fiction as a
whole. Likely due to the gradual
increase in his sales figures and
renown over the course of his long
career, he seems fairly untouched by

his celebrity. He maintains that he is
still honing his craft and has not yet
achieved the elusive goal of the per
fect first draff (like many writers, he
admits to finding revision vexing.)
He lingered on the effects of sci
ence fiction on our society. The genre
is uniquely useful, he argued, because
it presents a coherent vision of the
future where a tangible technology
brings about a slew of societal
changes necessary to accommodate it.
