"Hysteria," a romantic comedy centered on
the unlikely origins of the world's most
übiquitous sex toy the vibrator. Starring
Hugh Dancy as Dr. Mortimer Granville, the
forward-thinking Victorian-era physician
who came up with the idea, this is a far cry
from your average period piece.
In 1880s London, Mortimer, due to
his subscription to progressive scientific
ideas like germ theory, finds himself unem
ployable by the traditionalist physicians
who dominate the health field. After many
failed interviews, he finally finds a position
as the assistant to Dr. Robert Dalrymple
(Jonathan Pryce), whose private practice
specializes in treating "hysteria," a catch-all
diagnosis for women suffering anything
from nymphomania to melancholia. While
providing upper-middle-class women with
manual massage treatments (read: hand
jobs) is not quite the career that Mortimer
imagined for himself, the pay is consider
able, not to mention that he and Dr.
Dalrymple's youngest daughter Emily
(Felicity Jones) seem to share a mutual
attraction. But as the pair's client list
grows, Mortimer begins to suffer chronic
hand cramps that threaten to derail his
newfound success.
Meanwhile, he finds himself caught in

the crossfire between Dr. Dalrymple and his
feisty elder daughter Charlotte (Maggie
Gyllenhaal), who believes that they ought
to be helping the poor rather than widows
and housewives whose husbands can't per
form in bed. When Mortimer pays a visit to
his friend and electricity enthusiast
Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett),
he is struck by sudden inspiration when
playing with Edmund's new toy, an electric
feather duster, which vibrates in his hand
and relieves the cramps. But whether the
revolutionary device will be enough to
redeem Mortimer in the eyes of the

Dalrymple family remains to be seen.
While the acting is indicative of a
film that doesn't take itself too seriously,
beneath the playful exterior lies a gen
uine and sometimes-earnest sincerity.
Darcy, playing Mortimer as a book-smart
but socially awkward young doctor, ere-

ates an entertaining contrast with
Gyllenhaal's Charlotte, who is outspoken,
opinionated and confident. The alternat

ing chemistry and friction between the
two drives the latent romantic plot while
also providing a comical-yet-pointed
commentary on woman's expected place

in Victorian society.
But perhaps one of the more com
pelling aspects of the setting is the para
dox between the causes and symptoms of
"hysteria" and the restrained nature of the
time period. For an era notorious for its
buttoned-up demeanor, the so-called

medical condition demonstrated a sur
prisingly strong sense of sexuality, as

women then (or at least Dalrymple's
patients in the film) knew what they were
missing, even if they didn't quite have the
words that we do now to describe it. In
addition to touching on the small victo
ries of female empowerment in late-19th
century England, the film also pokes fun
at attitudes toward technological advance
ment, making a nice parallel to the mod
ern world.

Overall, "Hysteria" is a fun ride that
may get a little silly at times, but then again,
one would be hard-pressed to present the
invention of the vibrator in a serious tone.
