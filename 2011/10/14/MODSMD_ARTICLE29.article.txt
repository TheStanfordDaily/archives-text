# ROXY SASS
## advice Walk the walk 
### 
Roxy remembers her first Full
M00n... sort of. Ever the
overachiever, Roxy completed
her bingo board in record time, but
decided to step her game up.
Twenty-two tick-marks and several
hours later, she found herself in a
two-room double in some faraway
fraternity, confronted with her first
morning walk home.
It's a problem Roxy's faced
many a time before: how to walk
or stumble back to her dorm
without too much hassle. After years
of experience, Roxy now knows all
about turning that walk of shame
into one of pride. Though she's lost a
few socks along the way, Roxy's man
aged to escape with some dignity
after getting into tight situations.
Surviving the worst routes home
Stanford's a big campus, and
Roxy has never been one to discrimi
nate based on geography... or any
thing else for that matter. Ever the
scientist, Roxy has experimented
with all kinds of routes home and
has found some tried and true paths
as well as some that should be avoid
ed more than a gropey freshman at
the end of the night.
Lake Lag: Though Roxy loathes
any exercise other than working her
abs and glutes, those gym shorts she
stole from her latest conquest can
prove pretty useful. After working up
a sweat in the bedroom, just throw
your hair into a ponytail and jog
back home. No early-morning run
ner will be the wiser... until they
notice you're carrying a pair of heels.
White Plaza: Like emotional
attachment, White Plaza is some-

thing Roxy steers clear of the day
after a hookup. It's always uncom
fortable when a group of tourists
tries to take your picture (though
Roxy never says no to attention), but
trust Roxy when she tells you that it's
even worse when they want a snap
shot with last night's makeup and
some inexplicable glitter smeared
across your face.
No matter the path you take,
Roxy has found that her own varia
tion of Murphy's law will always
hold: anyone you don't want to run
into, you will. Just embrace it and
hope they think your choice of hot
pink spandex is part of your new 'Bos
aesthetic and not the remnants of
last night's rally.
Strutting your stuff
Roxy's never understood why
anyone would feel ashamed after get
ting some, and she considers her
treks home more "victory laps" than
"walks of shame." That being said,
she understands modesty, and Roxy
knows that these tips never fail: if
you've found yourself with an upper
classman, then get a ride home. Still
in rally gear? Then walk backwards
across campus and start spewing
Stanford facts. And finally, if you're
still drunk, then why go home at all?
