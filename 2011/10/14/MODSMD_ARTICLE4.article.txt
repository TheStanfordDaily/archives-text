# TIME TO SHINE
## Card hoping to prove it belongs in Pac-12 race 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Hie men's soccer team is in dire need of a win, and
time is not on the Cardinal's side as it looks to get back to
the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in the
last nine seasons. This weekend the squad plays host to
Washington and Oregon State in a pair of critical Pac-12
clashes halfway through the conference season.
Stanford (3-6-2,0-2-1 Pac-12) has a little bit of mo
mentum after a brilliant Adam Jahn free kick gave the
Cardinal its first points against rival California in three
years, earning a 1-1 tie at home against the Golden
Bears last Sunday.
But the team still has a lot of work to do in order to
build up its resume and qualify for the postseason.
After dropping the first three matches of the season,
Stanford went 3-1-1 in its next five games, including a
weekend sweep of Harvard and Vermont, and was fi
nally starting to gel entering conference play.
Two tight road losses against San Diego State and
UCLA later, some of that optimism was gone, and the
offense's failure to put the ball in the net has mostly

stumped coaches
and players alike.
Sophomore J.J.
Koval noted that the
team has actually
been creating many
scoring opportuni
ties, but has only
nine goals to show
for it in the first 11
games of the season.
"But [not scoring
a lot] means we just
need to be playing
even better de
fense," Koval said.
"If we can hold the
other team 0-0, we
really need to make
our goals count. And
in order to score
more goals, we need
to get the ball and

counter, add in that little extra effort, just make sure
we're focused and trust our technique.
"The goals will come, it's the game of soccer, and [if
we win] it just means we're keeping the ball out of our
net," he said.
Washington (6-3-2, 1-2) has had its fair share of
struggles offensively, particularly early in the season,
but the Huskies will be playing with some confidence
after coming back to upset No. 22 San Diego State last
weekend at home, 3-2.

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to earn

with Cal to open the Pac-12 season.

the Cardinal from 1996-99. Clark is
the program's first First Team
NCAA All-American, earning the
honor after a standout senior sea
son in which he led Stanford to a
spot in the NCAA Championship
match, winning the program's first
NCAA Tournament game along
the way.

Stanford cannot show Clark's
squad any mercy on Friday, howev

of the Cardinal in the standings.

Washington swept both meetings
between the teams last year and
holds a 24-16-1 edge all-time.
Two days later Oregon State (3-
7-1, 1-2) will be in town, and the
Beavers are a tricky side to gauge.
On the one hand, they have not
been able to string wins together
with any regularity at all, and are
four games under .500 coming off
two home losses to open confer
ence play last weekend. But they
have also scored in seven straight

games, and five of their seven losses
came by just one goal.
If the Cardinal can manage to
neutralize Oregon State's balanced
attack eight different players
have found the net for the Beavers
it will be in a very good position
to gain some ground in a crowded
Pac-12 field.

No. 15 UCLA leads the pack
with a perfect conference record
thus far, but after them it's any
body's guess as to who is the sec

ond-best team. And with seven
matches remaining, one good week
end could shift the entire season
outlook for the Cardinal.

Washington kicks things off Fri
day night at 7 p.m. with a Sunday
matinee against Oregon State
scheduled for 1 p.m. Both matches
will be played at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.

net," he said.
Washington (6-3-2, 1-2) has had its fair share of
struggles offensively, particularly early in the season,
but the Huskies will be playing with some confidence
after coming back to upset No. 22 San Diego State last
weekend at home, 3-2.
First-year Washington coach Jaime Clark knows a

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to earn
its first win of conference play after a
pair of tight road losses and a tie
with Cal to open the Pac-12 season.
With only nine goals in its first 11
games, the Cardinal hopes to capi

Freshman Felipe Noguerol and the rest of the men's
soccer team face a stiff test tonight against Washington.
After some mixed results early in the season, Stanford
needs to find a spark forthe upcoming stretch run.
the Cardinal from 1996-99. Clark is
the program's first First Team
NCAA All-American, earning the
honor after a standout senior sea
son in which he led Stanford to a
spot in the NCAA Championship
match, winning the program's first
NCAA Tournament game along
the way.

Stanford cannot show Clark's
squad any mercy on Friday, howev
er, as the Huskies sit a game ahead
of the Cardinal in the standings.

Washington swept both meetings
between the teams last year and
holds a 24-16-1 edge all-time.
Two days later Oregon State (3-
7-1, 1-2) will be in town, and the
Beavers are a tricky side to gauge.
On the one hand, they have not
been able to string wins together
with any regularity at all, and are
four games under .500 coming off
two home losses to open confer
ence play last weekend. But they
have also scored in seven straight

games, and five of their seven losses
came by just one goal.
If the Cardinal can manage to
neutralize Oregon State's balanced
attack eight different players
have found the net for the Beavers
it will be in a very good position
to gain some ground in a crowded
Pac-12 field.

No. 15 UCLA leads the pack
with a perfect conference record
thus far, but after them it's any
body's guess as to who is the sec

ond-best team. And with seven
matches remaining, one good week
end could shift the entire season
outlook for the Cardinal.

Washington kicks things off Fri
day night at 7 p.m. with a Sunday
matinee against Oregon State
scheduled for 1 p.m. Both matches
will be played at Laird Q. Cagan
Stadium.
