# TIME TO SHINE
## Card hoping to prove it belongs in Pac-12 race 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Hie men's soccer team is in dire need of a win, and
time is not on the Cardinal's side as it looks to get back to
the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in the
last nine seasons. This weekend the squad plays host to
Washington and Oregon State in a pair of critical Pac-12
clashes halfway through the conference season.
Stanford (3-6-2,0-2-1 Pac-12) has a little bit of mo
mentum after a brilliant Adam Jahn free kick gave the
Cardinal its first points against rival California in three
years, earning a 1-1 tie at home against the Golden
Bears last Sunday.
But the team still has a lot of work to do in order to
build up its resume and qualify for the postseason.
After dropping the first three matches of the season,
Stanford went 3-1-1 in its next five games, including a
weekend sweep of Harvard and Vermont, and was fi
nally starting to gel entering conference play.
Two tight road losses against San Diego State and
UCLA later, some of that optimism was gone, and the
offense's failure to put the ball in the net has mostly

stumped coaches
and players alike.
Sophomore J.J.
Koval noted that the
team has actually
been creating many
scoring opportuni
ties, but has only
nine goals to show
for it in the first 11
games of the season.
"But [not scoring
a lot] means we just
need to be playing
even better de
fense," Koval said.
"If we can hold the
other team 0-0, we
really need to make
our goals count. And
in order to score
more goals, we need
to get the ball and

counter, add in that little extra effort, just make sure
we're focused and trust our technique.
"The goals will come, it's the game of soccer, and [if
we win] it just means we're keeping the ball out of our
net," he said.
Washington (6-3-2, 1-2) has had its fair share of
struggles offensively, particularly early in the season,
but the Huskies will be playing with some confidence
after coming back to upset No. 22 San Diego State last
weekend at home, 3-2.
First-year Washington coach Jaime Clark knows a
little bit about Stanford's program, having played for

GAME NOTES: Stanford looks to earn
its first win of conference play after a
pair of tight road losses and a tie
with Cal to open the Pac-12 season.
With only nine goals in its first 11
games, the Cardinal hopes to capi
talize on its chances more frequently
against a strong Husky squad.

soccer team face a stiff test tonight against Washington.
After some mixed results early in the season, Stanford
needs to find a spark forthe upcoming stretch run.
