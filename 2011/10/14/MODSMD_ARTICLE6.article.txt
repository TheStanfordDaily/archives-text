## Occupy Wall Street comes to White Plaza today 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
While the recent Occupy Wall Street movement has
been spreading to major cities across the nation over the
past month, the campaign has now recently appeared on
campus.

Earlier this week,fliers advertising a "general assembly"
to be held today at noon in White Plaza began to appear
across campus.

This will be the first event for a group called "Occupy
Stanford." While there has not been a specific organization,
students have been participating in local protests, including
those in San Francisco and Oakland. Only a handful of stu

dents participated in the Occupy Palo Alto event held
Wednesday at the Bank of America branch on El Camino.

The protest was organized by the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center (PPJC), an organization that dates back to
Vietnam War protests in the 60s, and took place less than
two miles from Stanford Campus. This protest did see the
members of a newly formed Occupy Stanford group meet
ing with the more seasoned protesters of the PPJC.
"This is a class issue and Stanford is a private university,"
said Aurora David 'l2, a Stanford student who attended the
Occupy Palo Alto protest. "Our students may not be the
people worst affected but this is starting the discussion."

Demonstrators at Occupy Wall Street began with a march through the streets of Lower Manhattan at around the
time the bell rang on Wall Street on Sept. 29, 2011. Stanford students plan to assemble in White Plaza on Friday,
Oct. 14 at noon to show solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York City.
