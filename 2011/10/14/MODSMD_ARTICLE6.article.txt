## Occupy Wall Street comes to White Plaza today 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
While the recent Occupy Wall Street movement has
been spreading to major cities across the nation over the
past month, the campaign has now recently appeared on
campus.

Earlier this week,fliers advertising a "general assembly"
to be held today at noon in White Plaza began to appear
across campus.

This will be the first event for a group called "Occupy
Stanford." While there has not been a specific organization,
students have been participating in local protests, including
those in San Francisco and Oakland. Only a handful of stu

dents participated in the Occupy Palo Alto event held
Wednesday at the Bank of America branch on El Camino.

The protest was organized by the Peninsula Peace and
Justice Center (PPJC), an organization that dates back to
Vietnam War protests in the 60s, and took place less than
two miles from Stanford Campus. This protest did see the
members of a newly formed Occupy Stanford group meet
ing with the more seasoned protesters of the PPJC.
"This is a class issue and Stanford is a private university,"
said Aurora David 'l2, a Stanford student who attended the
Occupy Palo Alto protest. "Our students may not be the
people worst affected but this is starting the discussion."

Demonstrators at Occupy Wall Street began with a march through the streets of Lower Manhattan at around the
time the bell rang on Wall Street on Sept. 29, 2011. Stanford students plan to assemble in White Plaza on Friday,
Oct. 14 at noon to show solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York City.
First year Ph.D student in statistics
Joshua Loftus, another Stanford pro
tester at the Occupy Palo Alto
protest, said he was motivated to at
tend because he was concerned over
what he saw as an eroding opportuni
ty in education.
"I am a first generation college
graduate and went to school with a
Pell Grant," Loftus said. "I have eight
nieces and nephews and I don't know
that they will even have that opportu
nity because they are cutting Pell
grants instead of raising taxes."
While Loftus was passionately
supportive of the movement, he also
gave voice to two other issues that
could hinder its popularity on cam
pus uncertainty of the value of the
protests and students' lack of time.

"When I heard about the 'Occu
py' protests I was glad that somebody
was going to do it, but I was pes
simistic and I am still pretty pes
simistic," Loftus said. "It was a split
second decision whether or not to
participate honestly, I should prob
ably be studying."

What Loftus was not concerned
with, however, was the charge that the
movement lacks tangible goals.
"The lack of focus allows it to grow
more," Loftus said. "If it was based
around one specific policy that might
turn off all those who don't know
about that policy, but this is based
around anger that many people are
feeling."
Stanford professor of sociology
Sarah Soule, who specializes in social
movements, agreed that it is too early
to fault Occupy Wall Street for not
having clearer goals.

"I think that we must remember
that this movement is relatively
young," Soule wrote in an email to
The Daily. "It would be hard to argue,
I think, that most historic movements
arrived on a coherent set of goals in a
few short weeks."
