## Dish reopening delayed, now closed Fri. and Sat. 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
Stanford Dining postponed the
opening of The Dish, one of its late
night dining options, to Sunday, Oct.
16, after having previously post
poned it several times since the Ar
rillaga Family Dining Commons
opened.

The Dish's schedule has also
changed shortened to being
open Sunday through Thursday
each week, down from seven nights
per week when it was previously lo
cated in Stern Dining.

The Dish will be closed on Fri
day and Saturday nights, which
have traditionally been The Dish's
busiest nights in past years.
Originally scheduled to open
Oct. 6, the Dining Commons' sign
displaying the date just inside the
facility was changed to Oct. 13, and
then again to Oct. 16. Signs also in
dicated The Dish's reduction in
days of operation.

Food Services Manager Eric
Montell said that the hours of oper
ation for The Dish had to be re
viewed by the directors of Stanford
Dining in order to "balance" late

night dining with other late-night
events that happen on campus.

Montell said that he and other
dining directors have been holding
meetings with ASSU this week in
order to discuss the new features of
The Dish. The administrators are
seeking to ensure that the new
hours of The Dish coordinate with
the other late night events that hap
pen around campus, which Montell
said would maintain a balance in
Stanford nightlife.
This concept of "balance" has
been a concern to Dining, because
of the large volume of people that
have shown up at the new dining
commons since its opening two
weeks ago, according to Montell.
Focus has been placed on oper
ating the Arrillaga Family Dining
Commons' continuous dining serv
ices between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.
Montell estimated that, since its
opening, the dining commons feeds
between 30 and 40 percent of Stan
ford students in a single day.
The high volume of students has
"overloaded" the dining commons
