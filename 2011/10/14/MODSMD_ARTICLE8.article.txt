## FacSen discusses NYC campus, renovations 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
University President John Hen
nessy and electrical engineering
professor Bernd Girod updated the
Faculty Senate on the proposal for
a New York City campus at Thurs
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"I never thought the city of New
York would move faster than an ac
ademic institution," Hennessy said
as he began his talk, commenting
on the fast pace of the proposal
process, which he said may be in
part due to Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's limited term.
The Bloomberg administration
requested proposals in July to cre
ate an applied-sciences center for

teaching and research and pledged
$lOO million to support infrastruc
ture upgrades at the site. The Uni
versity plans to submit its formal
proposal by the Oct. 28 deadline.
Hennessy said the NYC campus
itself is a long-term project and
would occur in phases, with the first
students arriving in 2013.
"This is something that will play
out over many years," he said. The
current proposal includes several
phases of building, with campus
completion estimated to occur be
tween 2038 and 2045.
The project would have a 10-
year horizon for fundraising, Hen
nessy said.
"Quite frankly, this is a project
that will need a significant amount
of fundraising," Hennessy said. He
later added, "This project is highly
dependent on philanthropy."
Girod described the project as a
"high-risk, high-reward type of en
deavor."

The University is currently fo
cusing on a 10-acre site on Roo
sevelt Island, between Manhattan
and Queens in the East River.

"It has a small village feel be
cause of the layout of the island and
what's there," Hennessy said. He
described it as "urban, but not over
whelming."
On Tuesday the University an
nounced the creation of a test site
called "Stanford@CCNY" in part
nership with the City University of
New York (CUNY) and the City
College of New York (CCNY).
Hennessy said this venture
would serve as a stepping-stone to
the creation of the Roosevelt Island
campus, housing a growing Stan
ford program in an academic set
ting for its first three years, from
2013 to 2016.

"We hope to have a longer-term
relationship with CCNY," he said at
the meeting.
The Roosevelt Island campus
would ultimately boast a variety of
programs, including several engi
neering departments and potential
ly a new program on sustainable
urban systems.
All of these developments are
contingent upon the acceptance of
Stanford's bid for the NYC campus.
"Cornell is probably the most
active competitor with a strong en
gineering school," Hennessy said.
The Bloomberg administration
is likely to make a final announce
ment before the end of the year.
Earlier in his presentation, Hen
nessy joked about Stanford's ad

vantage due to the University's
close connection with Silicon Val
ley. He noted that the bidding uni
versities were asked to answer the
questions, "How many companies
have been founded within 25 miles
of your campus?" and "How many
graduates choose to settle within 25
miles of your campus?"
A few faculty members had
questions after Hennessy's presen
tation, raising concerns about the
proposal.
History professor Carolyn
Lougee Chappell asked if the new
graduate campus might limit inter
action between undergraduate and
graduate students. She also noted
that the applied sciences focus
should not cause the humanities to
be overlooked.

Hennessy said the new location
could increase the University's
East Coast presence by casting
Stanford not just as an elite engi
neering university, but also as an
elite center for the study of human
ities. He suggested the possibility
of five or six rotating humanities
professors on the New York cam
pus, as well as an "overseas" pro
gram in New York for undergradu
ates.

"Risk assessment should be a
very important part of this," said
economics professor Caroline
Hoxby. She also expressed concern
over the "political risk" the Univer
sity might face in New York City
and the uncertain economic future.

Other members of the Faculty
Senate focused on the opportunity
cost and internal governance con
cerns associated with the proposal.

"This will take an enormous
amount of management attention,"
Hennessy said. "I think the oppor
tunity cost is real in respect to man
agement attention."

He added that it is "harder to di
agnose philanthropic costs," as a
New York campus might inspire a
new set of donors.

programs, including several engi
neering departments and potential
ly a new program on sustainable
urban systems.
All of these developments are
contingent upon the acceptance of
Stanford's bid for the NYC campus.
"Cornell is probably the most
active competitor with a strong en
gineering school," Hennessy said.
The Bloomberg administration
is likely to make a final announce
ment before the end of the year.
Earlier in his presentation, Hen
nessy joked about Stanford's ad

vantage due to the University's
close connection with Silicon Val
ley. He noted that the bidding uni
versities were asked to answer the
questions, "How many companies
have been founded within 25 miles
of your campus?" and "How many
graduates choose to settle within 25
miles of your campus?"
A few faculty members had
questions after Hennessy's presen
tation, raising concerns about the
proposal.
History professor Carolyn
Lougee Chappell asked if the new
graduate campus might limit inter
action between undergraduate and
graduate students. She also noted
that the applied sciences focus
should not cause the humanities to
be overlooked.

Hennessy said the new location
could increase the University's
East Coast presence by casting
Stanford not just as an elite engi
neering university, but also as an
elite center for the study of human
ities. He suggested the possibility
of five or six rotating humanities
professors on the New York cam
pus, as well as an "overseas" pro
gram in New York for undergradu
ates.

"Risk assessment should be a
very important part of this," said
economics professor Caroline
Hoxby. She also expressed concern
over the "political risk" the Univer
sity might face in New York City
and the uncertain economic future.

Other members of the Faculty
Senate focused on the opportunity
cost and internal governance con
cerns associated with the proposal.

"This will take an enormous
amount of management attention,"
Hennessy said. "I think the oppor
tunity cost is real in respect to man
agement attention."

He added that it is "harder to di
agnose philanthropic costs," as a
New York campus might inspire a
new set of donors.
