## FacSen discusses NYC campus, renovations 
### MARGARET RAWSON DESK EDITOR 
University President John Hen
nessy and electrical engineering
professor Bernd Girod updated the
Faculty Senate on the proposal for
a New York City campus at Thurs
day's Faculty Senate meeting.
"I never thought the city of New
York would move faster than an ac
ademic institution," Hennessy said
as he began his talk, commenting
on the fast pace of the proposal
process, which he said may be in
part due to Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's limited term.
The Bloomberg administration
requested proposals in July to cre
ate an applied-sciences center for

teaching and research and pledged
$lOO million to support infrastruc
ture upgrades at the site. The Uni
versity plans to submit its formal
proposal by the Oct. 28 deadline.
Hennessy said the NYC campus
itself is a long-term project and
would occur in phases, with the first
students arriving in 2013.
"This is something that will play
out over many years," he said. The
current proposal includes several
phases of building, with campus
completion estimated to occur be
tween 2038 and 2045.
The project would have a 10-
year horizon for fundraising, Hen
nessy said.
