## Moroccan monarchy may fall, Benchemsi says 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Ahmed Benchemsi, visiting
scholar at the Program on Arab Re
form and Democracy at the Free
man Spogli Institute for Internation
al Studies' Center on Democracy,
Development and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL), delivered a talk on
Thursday titled, "The Illusion of
Democracy: How Morocco's Ab
solute Monarchy Managed the Arab
Spring."
Benchemsi, who joined CDDRL
earlier this year, is a Moroccan jour
nalist who has written extensively on
King Mohammed VI and the Mo
roccan monarchy. He served as pub
lisher and editor of Morocco's two
best-selling weeklies, French-lan
guage TelQuel and Arabic-language
Nishan.

"Ahmed has set precedents for
dealing with issues that aren't nor
mally dealt with, and it won't sur
prise you to know that this was not
greeted by unmitigated enthusiasm
by the Moroccan authorities," said
CDDRL Senior Fellow Larry Dia
mond in his introduction to the talk.

The talk addressed King Mo
hammed VTs reforms in light of the
protests that have spread across the
Middle East and North Africa since
the start of the year. In a response
markedly different than what hap
pened in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain,
Yemen, Libya and Syria, Morocco's
monarch proposed a new constitu
tion in late June. The reformist con
stitution passed in July, garnering
98.5 percent support.
Benchemsi presented articles
from the new constitution, as well as
the largely positive response of
Western diplomats and the media.
"It looks like major concessions!
Even if it's not democracy, we can
call it at least fair power-sharing; so

yes, in this light, Morocco may well
be this exception that [Secretary of
State] Clinton so highly commends
or not," Benchemsi said.
He went on to detail the discrep
ancies between appearances and re
ality in Moroccan politics, starting
with a video showing corruption in
the referendum votes. He also rein
troduced some of the new constitu
tion's articles, drawing attention to
what he called "tricks in the text."
One of these "tricks" was a differ
ence in the French and Arabic ver
sions of the article declaring the
King's status.

"The article sends a double mes
sage to Francophone cosmopolitan
opinion-makers and Arabophone
average Moroccan citizens,"
Benchemsi said. The difference was
an additional word in the Arabic ver
sion implying the sanctity of the
King.

"The constitution has a great
facade, but is misleading," Benchem
si said, pointing out other issues with
the constitution, including an article
protecting the economy from mo
nopolies, trading of privileges and
abuse of dominant positions.

"King Mohammed is the number
one banker, grocer, landowner and
farmer in Morocco," he said, citing
that the royal holdings include the
largest private conglomerate in Mo
rocco, a company with total revenue
reaching 8 percent of the nation's
GDP.

The division of power in the new
constitution, guaranteeing the inde
pendence of the judicial branch from
the legislative and the executive was
also deemed a trick.

"The king is the legislative
branch," Benchemsi said. "He is the
executive branch and he is the judi
cial branch. This is the definition of
absolute power and this is what we
still have in Morocco."

Benchemsi outlined reasons why
the "illusion" of the democratic
monarchy works, both international
ly and domestically.
"Since the Arab Spring erupted,
what we've been hearing is about vi
olent crackdowns and bloody on
slaught," he said. "In comparison
with all that, mild management of the
Arab Spring from the Moroccan

palace looks reasonable."
He also mentioned the stability
and reliability of the Moroccan
regime as a U.S. ally as a considera
tion for the United States and West
ern countries.

Looking forward into the coun
try's future, Benchemsi character
ized the upcoming elections as "busi
ness as usual," mentioning the de
grading economy, declining govern
ment resources and unemployment
rates as potential factors for the
regime's destabilization.
"The Moroccan monarchy some
how outfoxed its opponents ... but
by nature smokescreens disperse
when the winds start to blow again,"

he said.
These winds, which include the
possibility of revolution in neighbor
ing Algeria, economic factors and the
situation in Syria, led Benchemsi to
conclude that the Moroccan monar
chy may not last.
"I think it's a fair assumption to
make that the clock is ticking against
Arab autocracies and Morocco is no
exception," he said.
Approximately 60 scholars at
tended the talk, which was part of a
weekly seminar series held by
CDDRL.

Ahmed Benchemsi (standing) spoke to around 60 people yesterday about the recent constitutional reforms of the
Moroccan monarchy and the effects of the Arab Spring on the country. He said the clock was ticking for all Arab
autocracies and predicted that the Moroccan monarchy would not last in its current state.
