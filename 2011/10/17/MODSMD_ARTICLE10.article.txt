# NARRATIVE
## A 						freshman's first Full Moon 
### ETHAN KESSINGER 
Rally gear: encouraged. Pre-gaming: necessary.
Underwear: optional. No, this is not an erotic
rave but instead an annual campus tradition.
Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ) began as a
quaint tradition in the early 1900s when senior
boys would present freshman girls with a flower before
giving them a kiss on the cheek as a chivalrous way to wel
come them to the Farm. Over the years, FMOTQ has
evolved, but still helps welcome freshmen to the commu
nity.
FMOTQ took place last Thursday and officially began
with a concert at Old Union featuring DJ A-Trak. Even
with the music's draw, it appeared to me that the event was
mostly attended by freshmen and a clan of naked upper
classmen that I'm sure was not there to watch the band.
Entering the Quad was more like going to the airport
than to a make-out fest; barricades corralled us to ID
checkpoints, and there was security everywhere. Nobody
wanted to have random Palo Alto residents joining in, so
these extra precautions were met without protest.
On one side of the Quad, Memorial Church was fullv
lit, and on the other, a giant screen count
ed down to midnight when the kissing
would begin. Tables covered in
condoms, mouthwash and signs
about the importance of con
sent lined the entrance to the
event. Many of the attendees .
were sporting FMOTQ bro
tanks featuring a bingo board
displaying the names of different \
cohorts within the student body one
might kiss, for instance, a freshman,
the Tree or a Dollie. Others made
their own bingo boards to wear around their
necks.
The crowd began filing in soon after 11:00 p.m., but the
scene was pretty subdued until the Band rolled in around
11:30 p.m.. They kept the crowd dancing and sweating
until 11:55 p.m., when students were treated to a movie
reel of famous kisses. A couple of students glanced up for
pointers, but everyone else just waited for the countdown
to conclude.
At the stroke of midnight, people sprung together.
Kissing commenced between seniors and freshmen, soph
omores and juniors, boyfriends and girlfriends, best
friends, boys and girls, boys and boys, band geeks and
cheerleaders.
It seemed very awkward at first, and there were big
groups of students afraid to leave their friends, but after
the first few minutes, it was clear that there was nothing to
lose. Eye contact was enough in most situations, but peo
ple still made valiant efforts to use their best pick-up lines.
For reasons still unclear to me, a significant number of
people did not want to make out with hoards of drunken

strangers. However, the observers gave foolproof rejec
tions perfect for any time you don't want to pucker up.
After a while, vodka-flavored saliva loses its appeal, so
most people headed toward the exit by the 12:45 a.m. con
clusion.
The next morning, the talk around the breakfast table
revolved around everyone's magic numbers. The general
consensus was that three kisses was respectable, five to
nine was impressive and double-digits were just gross.
There were a lot of awkward hellos in the dining hall
and a lot more faces around campus that seemed vaguely
familiar. Otherwise, it was just another beautiful day at
Stanford.
