## EDITORIAL Intersections and the Stanford vision 
### 
Everyone who lives or works
at the Stanford campus, be
they freshmen, professors,
grounds workers or President Hen
nessy himself, depends both directly
and indirectly on the local street net
work to carry out their business and
enjoy recreational activities. The
many malls and arcades that make
Stanford's main campus so post
card-worthy and accessible general
ly fulfill the demands of the commu
nity quite well. Unfortunately, poor
ly designed intersections on the out
skirts of campus contribute to stu
dents' isolation from surrounding
cities and also endanger those who
travel to and from campus each day.
Palo Alto, taking advantage of
outside funding from numerous
sources, recently completed renova
tion of one such intersection be
tween Stanford Avenue and El
Camino Real and in doing so has
provided a model for future im
provements elsewhere. The new in
tersection adds numerous pedestri
an amenities designed to narrow the
crossing, such as bulb-outs on the
corners and a wider median. Col
ored crosswalks help to increase the
visibility and presence of crossings,
improving pedestrian safety. New
trees, benches and other landscape
enhancements aim to provide out
door gathering places to comple
ment the natural hub generated by a
nearby Starbucks. Lines of sight
have also been widened to make
turns safer for everyone. The city re
alized the goal of transforming a rel
atively ugly intersection into one
that is not only safer but also feels
more inviting.
The improvements to the Stan
ford Avenue and El Camino Real
intersection make several of the

less-welcoming entrances to Stan
ford all the more conspicuous. The
intersection of El Camino Real and
Galvez Street/Embarcadero Road
is one of the most heavily trafficked
intersections near campus for
pedestrians, cyclists and motorists
alike. In its current state, cyclists
must choose between sharing nar
row traffic lanes with vehicles that
rarely adhere to the 25 mph posted
speed limit and illegally riding
through narrow crosswalks that are
inadequate for pedestrians besides.
Proposals to redesign the intersec
tion have been floated in Palo Alto,
but have so far been neglected in
favor of other projects. Considering
the large number of students and
employees who use the intersection
and the amenity value of a more vi
sually appealing approach to the
University, Stanford could offer
Palo Alto a financial incentive to
take action on the intersection.

One could go on to list many
more areas in need of improvement,
and indeed, such issues are usually
well known to local transportation
departments. Nevertheless, im
provements to local intersections
have come quite slowly. The condi
tions of local travel improved dra
matically in the first half-century of
Stanford's existence, seeing Palm
Drive transformed from a muddy
dirt path to a famous landmark. By
comparison, the last several decades
have seen only marginal improve
ments. It's time to realize that part of
what makes Stanford such a vibrant
community is the ease and pleasure
with which it can be traversed. The
exceptions, where they exist, need
not be grudgingly tolerated and
should be dealt with sooner rather
than later.
