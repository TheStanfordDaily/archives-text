# FRESHMAN '15
## The 						List 
### Bianca Chavez 
You know that video every
student watches in eighth
grade health class? The one
with the scary old lady who smokes
through a hole in her throat? I cur
rently sound just like her. And it's
all because Full Moon got the best
of me.
I went to the Quad with one mis
sion: kiss the Tree. And, like, a lot of
guys. I had to. According to a straw
poll conducted by my friend Jere
my, Twain had voted me most likely
to kiss the most people. (And isn't
that a lovely accomplishment to list
on a resume?) Once the challenge
was issued, I knew I had to win. The
Stanford student inside of me hates
losing more than anything, and plus,
a couple people in my hallway had
money riding on the bet. I couldn't
let them lose, now could I? Kissing
the Tree was important to me for a
different reason. Unlike a lot of
people, I don't believe it's good luck
because a) there is no such thing as
good luck or bad luck, only people
with good attitudes and people with
bad attitudes, and b) I'm pretty sure
even if luck were real, kissing some
one who had previously kissed sev
eral hundred other people would
not be lucky it would be away to
contract mono and quite possibly
oral herpes. No, I wanted to kiss the
Tree because it was on the List.

What is this List, you might ask?
(And more importantly, why does it

need to be capitalized?) The List is
something my fellow Tser Kale and
I worked on this summer in be
tween taking four-hour naps and
eating Cocoa Puffs on my couch.
Basically, it encompasses every
thing we hope this year will be
about. Silliness. Forming new rela
tionships. Adventure. Learning
things both inside and outside of
the classroom. Whichever one of
our friends can check the most
items off the List by June gets a
prize and bragging rights for pretty
much the rest of eternity. Now, with
out further ado, I present the List:

Oh and by the way, I totally
failed both of my Full-Moon mis
sions. I only kissed one guy, and it
wasn't on the Quad or even under
the full moon. I guess there's always
next year, right?

Know an easy way to get into the
steam tunnels? Tell Bianca at
blchavez@stanford.edu, so she can
be one step closer to finishing the List.
