# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Consequentialism and freedom 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Reunion Homecoming, in all
its cardinal-and-white glory,
arrives on the Farm next
weekend. But in the annual mish
mash of good food, old friends and
red Lamborghinis that signals the
return of thousands of Stanford
alumni to the one place they all have
in common, I see a disturbing ques
tion: what will you remember when
you come back?
Stanford students are superb
consequentialists that is, we tend
to measure the goodness of actions
by their eventual results. Bentham
and Mill would be proud. We excel
at making rational calculations of
expected returns to labor and in
vestment, which is probably why so
many of us will take the exhortation
to occupy Wall Street quite literally

after graduation. So before making
any decision, we ask one very simple
question: what will I get out of it?
Should I join Club X or Society
Y? Well, it depends on which one
will look better on my resume, itself
a means to getting me into law
school, itself a means to a stable,
well-paying job and the approbation
of society. Should I take class A or
class B? Depends on which one will
likely get me a better grade. Should
I go to office hours today? Depends
will the TA give me the answers
on the problem set?
Should I go to the football game?
Probably not the momentary
happiness I'd gain would probably
be outweighed by the returns of
studying for those four hours.
Should I watch that movie with my

friends? I guess not I could be
writing that paper instead. Should I
ask out that girl down the hall? Well,
let's think: how much time and ener
gy will a relationship cost?
Sometimes, the more altruistic
among us fall into the same trap, de
luding ourselves into believing that
if our actions are intended to benefit
others rather than ourselves, we can
not possibly be doing anything
wrong. Why should I work at the
Haas Center? Well, it'll probably
land me a great job at a human
rights agency down the road, and
then I can do what I really want and
help people who need me. Why
should I study my brains out, skip
two nights of sleep a week and go
through the nine circles of organic
chem? Well, I'll eventually get into

med school, and then I can go help
cure preventable disease in sub-Sa
haran Africa.

But what inevitably gets lost in
this generally admirable decision
making heuristic is the sheer joy of
doing something for no reason at all.
Kant tells us that rational agents
should be treated as ends in them
selves, never as means. The problem
with Stanford students' line of
thinking is that we tend to reduce
everything to means to a larger end,
and in doing so, we suck the joy out
of the means.

Things (and people) generally
cease to have intrinsic value when
they are subsumed into part of a
strategy. Think about it: we all know
people who always have the end
game in mind, and we tend not to
like them very much. We've all met,
for instance, the guy who looks right
through you during a conversation.
He's not really thinking about you
or the conversation: he's thinking
about your networking value or the
letter of recommendation you might
be able to write for him later. We've
all met the girl who flakes out on
dinner because an unexpected this
or-that came up; she calculated
which would benefit her more, and
the this-or-that beat out her friends.
The end-game, kept always in view,
is the bane of the here and now.

Philosopher Bernard Williams
once famously observed that the
committed utilitarian tends to have
"one thought too many." I agree. We
think too much and act sponta
neously too little, and in doing so we
lose our essential freedom. We be
come slaves to the dictates of a
hoped-for future.
So what will you remember when
you come back for your 25th class re
union? Will you drive up in a Ferrari
looking for your friends only to real
ize that you never really made any
because you were too busy dreaming
about the Ferrari? Will you remem
ber your Stanford experience as one

blurry, four-year-long means to the
life you now have?
Or will you remember things that
had value in and of themselves: the
movie you saw because it looked
good, the discussions you had just
because you could or the class you
took because it looked fascinating?
(And hey, you've only got four
years.) Will you remember that
night you played tag in the Green
Library stacks, the evening you blew
off a paper and went to the haunted
house instead and the time you went
steam-tunneling and narrowly es
caped the Stanford police in a high
octane bicycle chase?
It's up to you. Think about it
or, even better, don't.

Miles is already missing his four years,
even though they're not quite over yet.

The committed
utilitarian tends
tohave'one
thought too
many!' I agree.
