## WAZZU IS NO MATCH CARD RALLIES FROM POOR FIRST HALF 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
There are a lot of trite sayings
associated with the game of foot
ball. Keep your feet moving. Stay
low. Football is a game of inches.
But for the Stanford football
team, only one saying can de
scribe its 44-14 win over Wash
ington State on Saturday: it's not
how you start, it's how you finish.

The No. 7 Cardinal (6-0, 4-0
Pac-12) only managed 10 points
against the "Cougars (3-3,1-2) in
the first half on Saturday, the
worst scoring output in a single
half from the Stanford offense
all season. But quarterback An
drew Luck and the offense final
ly found a groove after halftime,
piling on 310 yards of total of
fense and 34 points to keep the
Cardinal's 14-game win streak
alive and well.

Stanford's early offensive
troubles started right away with
a 2-yard loss on the Cardinal's
first play of the day. Then, Luck
wound up and fired deep down
the field and into the hands of
defender Damante Horton, just
the third interception of the sea
son for Luck and the first that
did not come as a result of a
tipped pass.
"It was my fault for not put
ting the ball where it was sup
posed to be," Luck told reporters
after the game.
The Cardinal spent the rest of
the half avoiding deep shots and
focusing on short pass patterns,

but Luck and his receiving corps
couldn't find much breathing
room against a stubborn Cougar
defense that only allowed 165
total yards in the first half.
But in a display that showed
the impressive balance of the
Cardinal, the Stanford defense
stepped up in a big way to help
out the offense, sacking Cougar
quarterback Jeff Tuel three
times in the first half and six
times throughout the course of
the game.
After a first-quarter field goal
made the score 3-0 in Stanford's
favor, the defense responded
again, forcing a second-quarter
fumble that senior safety
Michael Thomas took all the way
down to the Washington State
20-yard line after dashing 33
yards with the football.
With the short field, Stanford
jammed the football all the way
down to the one-yard line before
senior running back Jeremy
Stewart smacked his way into
the end zone on fourth-and-goal
to make the score 10-0 and keep
Stanford a perfect nine-for-nine
on fourth-down conversions this
season.
After the Cardinal defense
forced another Wazzu punt on
the ensuing series, junior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor fum
bled the ball for the first time all
season and for the first time
since his fumble against USC
last year that led to Luck's now
famous hit on USC cornerback
Shareece Wright.

The fumble marked the first
time all season that Stanford has
turned the ball over more than
once in a game, and the Cougars
pounced on the rare opportunity
by driving 40 yards for a score to

make the score 10-7 at halftime.

But despite the sour first half.
Luck and the Cardinal stormed
out of the locker room after the
break looking more like the
team that captured last year's
Orange Bowl, particularly by fo
cusing the offense on tight ends
Coby Fleener, Levine Toilolo
and Zach Ertz.
On the Cardinal's first drive
of the second half, Luck found
Fleener with back-to-back pass
es for 71 yards then flipped an
other pass to Toilolo in the end
zone to make it 17-7.

After a trio of punts, Luck
once again found Toilolo for a
touchdown, this time on a beau
tiful leaping catch from the 6-
foot-8 junior, who spun around
and dove 5 full yards into the end
zone with a defender hanging
from his back to extend the lead
to 24-7.

Taylor redeemed his earlier
mistake by taking a Luck shovel
pass in from 8 yards for a touch
down early in the fourth quarter,
and Fleener found the end zone
for the sixth time this season
later in the quarter to make the
score 38-7 and put the Cougars'
comeback hopes to bed.
But the scoring wasn't over
just yet after the Cougars
scored a late touchdown to make
the score 38-14, freshman Ty
Montgomery took the kickoff at
the 4-yard line, spun off a tackier
and zipped the final 75 yards all
the way to the end zone, putting
a final exclamation point on the
30-point win with Stanford's first
kick return for a touchdown of
the season.

Luck finished the day with a

Running back Tyler Gaffney (above) was part of an explosive Cardinal offense on
Saturday. Washington State battled to a 10-7 deficit at halftime before Andrew Luck
threw for four touchdowns to lead the team to a 44-14 victory, the team's 14th straight.
23-for-36 passing game, throwing

Taylor added 100 yards on the

With the victory, the 2010-11
Cardinal set the school record for
the longest winning streak at 14.
Stanford has now beaten its last

But for the Stanford football
team, only one saying can de
scribe its 44-14 win over Wash
ington State on Saturday: it's not
how you start, it's how you finish.

The No. 7 Cardinal (6-0, 4-0
Pac-12) only managed 10 points
against the "Cougars (3-3,1-2) in
the first half on Saturday, the
worst scoring output in a single
half from the Stanford offense
all season. But quarterback An
drew Luck and the offense final
ly found a groove after halftime,
piling on 310 yards of total of
fense and 34 points to keep the
Cardinal's 14-game win streak
alive and well.

Stanford's early offensive
troubles started right away with
a 2-yard loss on the Cardinal's
first play of the day. Then, Luck
wound up and fired deep down
the field and into the hands of
defender Damante Horton, just
the third interception of the sea
son for Luck and the first that
did not come as a result of a
tipped pass.
"It was my fault for not put
ting the ball where it was sup
posed to be," Luck told reporters
after the game.
The Cardinal spent the rest of
the half avoiding deep shots and
focusing on short pass patterns,

but Luck and his receiving corps
couldn't find much breathing
room against a stubborn Cougar
defense that only allowed 165
total yards in the first half.
But in a display that showed
the impressive balance of the
Cardinal, the Stanford defense
stepped up in a big way to help
out the offense, sacking Cougar
quarterback Jeff Tuel three
times in the first half and six
times throughout the course of
the game.
After a first-quarter field goal
made the score 3-0 in Stanford's
favor, the defense responded
again, forcing a second-quarter
fumble that senior safety
Michael Thomas took all the way
down to the Washington State
20-yard line after dashing 33
yards with the football.
With the short field, Stanford
jammed the football all the way
down to the one-yard line before
senior running back Jeremy
Stewart smacked his way into
the end zone on fourth-and-goal
to make the score 10-0 and keep
Stanford a perfect nine-for-nine
on fourth-down conversions this
season.
After the Cardinal defense
forced another Wazzu punt on
the ensuing series, junior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor fum
bled the ball for the first time all
season and for the first time
since his fumble against USC
last year that led to Luck's now
famous hit on USC cornerback
Shareece Wright.

The fumble marked the first
time all season that Stanford has
turned the ball over more than
once in a game, and the Cougars
pounced on the rare opportunity
by driving 40 yards for a score to

make the score 10-7 at halftime.

But despite the sour first half.
Luck and the Cardinal stormed
out of the locker room after the
break looking more like the
team that captured last year's
Orange Bowl, particularly by fo
cusing the offense on tight ends
Coby Fleener, Levine Toilolo
and Zach Ertz.
On the Cardinal's first drive
of the second half, Luck found
Fleener with back-to-back pass
es for 71 yards then flipped an
other pass to Toilolo in the end
zone to make it 17-7.

After a trio of punts, Luck
once again found Toilolo for a
touchdown, this time on a beau
tiful leaping catch from the 6-
foot-8 junior, who spun around
and dove 5 full yards into the end
zone with a defender hanging
from his back to extend the lead
to 24-7.

Taylor redeemed his earlier
mistake by taking a Luck shovel
pass in from 8 yards for a touch
down early in the fourth quarter,
and Fleener found the end zone
for the sixth time this season
later in the quarter to make the
score 38-7 and put the Cougars'
comeback hopes to bed.
But the scoring wasn't over
just yet after the Cougars
scored a late touchdown to make
the score 38-14, freshman Ty
Montgomery took the kickoff at
the 4-yard line, spun off a tackier
and zipped the final 75 yards all
the way to the end zone, putting
a final exclamation point on the
30-point win with Stanford's first
kick return for a touchdown of
the season.

Luck finished the day with a

WASHINGTON STATE 14

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Running back Tyler Gaffney (above) was part of an explosive Cardinal offense on
Saturday. Washington State battled to a 10-7 deficit at halftime before Andrew Luck
threw for four touchdowns to lead the team to a 44-14 victory, the team's 14th straight.
23-for-36 passing game, throwing
for 336 yards with four touchdowns
and an interception. It was the sixth
time in his college career that he
has thrown four touchdowns in a
game. Fleener notched the highest
single-game receiving total for a
Cardinal player this season with
128 yards and a touchdown, and
Taylor added 100 yards on the
ground in addition to his touch
down catch.

With the victory, the 2010-11
Cardinal set the school record for
the longest winning streak at 14.
Stanford has now beaten its last
nine opponents by more than 25
points and held its last 12 oppo
nents to less than 20 points.
And on a day that started with an
interception and ended with a kick
off return, it wasn't how the Cardi
nal started, it was how it finished.
Stanford will get a chance to see
if it can start a little faster this Sat
urday back on the Farm against the
No. 22 Washington Huskies.
