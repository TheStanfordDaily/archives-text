# CARD COMES UP BIG
## 
### MICHAEL SCHWARTZ 
A straight-set Cardinal victory
over the No. 2 Washington Huskies
in a clash of volleyball titans Satur
day night at Maples Pavilion sent
Shockwaves through the Pac-12 and
the entire country, but no one
learned more than No. 7 Stanford
coach John Dunning and his players.

"The message we send is really
to ourselves: we have a good team
this year. The possibilities are limit
less," Dunning said.
Stanford (14-3, 8-3 Pac-12) took
a four-game winning streak into the
weekend matches against Washing
ton and Washington State and did
not disappoint. The Cardinal dis
mantled the Washington State
Cougars (11-8,3-6) on Friday night
thanks to a quick start that saw it
take the first set 25-13 in dominat
ing fashion. The Card went on to
win the second set 25-21 and the
third 25-6 for a straight-set victory.
Leading the charge once again
was sophomore outside hitter
Rachel Williams, who torched the
Cougars offensively with a match
high 13 kills. Freshman Lydia Bai
pitched in with 12 kills, as the pair
smothered the Cougar defense all
night long. Stanford was able to

hold outside hitter Megan Ganzer
in check, limiting her to 10 kills for
the match. Much of the credit goes
to middle blocker Carly Wopat, who
led the way at the heart of Stan
ford's defense with three blocks.
But the true test came on Satur
day night when the Washington
Huskies (15-3,7-3) rolled into town.
Coming off of a loss to California,
the Huskies were hungry for a win
to keep them above Stanford in the
Pac-12 standings. However, in front
of over 4,000 screaming fans, the
Cardinal could not be stopped.
Stanford started off strong, tak
ing a 22-14 lead in the first set. But
four straight errors by Bai, Williams
and Wopat allowed the Huskies to
climb back, forcing the Card to take
a timeout. Regaining its composure,
Stanford closed out the set for a 25-
19 victory.
Wopat got things going for Stan
ford in the second set, opening with
three straight kills. The sophomore
came up big when she was needed
most, recording 10 kills and three
blocks on a match-high .500 hit per
centage. Just when the Huskies
began to make a run, junior setter
Karissa Cook shifted the momen
tum back Stanford's way with a
phenomenal behind-the-back kill
followed by an ace. Cook played ex
tremely well, recording 30 assists
and 13 digs to lead all players in
both categories.

Then it was time for the Rachel
Williams show, as she stifled the

Washington defense with back-to
back kills. Williams put on an exhi
bition on the attack for the fans,
leading all players with 15 kills.
"We wanted to keep the momen
tum going [and] put pressure on
them," she said.
They did just that, winning the
second set 25-16, giving Stanford a
commanding two-set lead heading
into the locker room.

However, the Huskies were not
going to lie down and hand Stan
ford the game. They came out for
the third set with a fire that had
been missing earlier in the match.
Washington battled back from an
early deficit to tie the set at 22. The
Cardinal continued to fight, taking a
24-23 lead and then ending the
match in dramatic fashion with an
ace from Wopat.
"It wasn't pretty in the third set,
but we just fought," Dunning said.
Saturday night's win against
Washington highlights the best
stretch of the season thus far for the
Cardinal, during which it has won
six straight. With the win, Stanford
managed to leapfrog Washington in
the Pac-12 standings, moving up to
fourth place with plenty of games
remaining.
The Cardinal will look to contin
ue climbing on the road as it travels
to Arizona next weekend to take on
Arizona and Arizona State.

Cardinal continued to fight, taking a
24-23 lead and then ending the
match in dramatic fashion with an
ace from Wopat.
"It wasn't pretty in the third set,
but we just fought," Dunning said.
Saturday night's win against
Washington highlights the best
stretch of the season thus far for the
Cardinal, during which it has won
six straight. With the win, Stanford
managed to leapfrog Washington in
the Pac-12 standings, moving up to
fourth place with plenty of games
remaining.
The Cardinal will look to contin
ue climbing on the road as it travels
to Arizona next weekend to take on
Arizona and Arizona State.
