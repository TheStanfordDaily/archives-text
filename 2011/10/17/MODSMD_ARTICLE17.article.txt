## Devils downed, Card still top of Pac-12 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Continuing its dominance with
another strong road performance,
the No. 1 Stanford women's soccer
team moved one step closer to a
Pac-12 title this weekend, beating
Arizona State 3-1 on Friday and ex
tending its conference win streak to
26 games.

The road trip, however brief, was
encouraging for a Cardinal team
(14-0-1,6-0 Pac-12) that could have
had a letdown after a 4-1 win over
perennial contender UCLA last
Sunday. Instead, Stanford's top con
tributors did their jobs against the
struggling Sun Devils (6-8,2-4 Pac

12), with the seniors combining for
10 of the squad's 15 shots and the
Cardinal's top-four scorers posting
one point each.
Stanford now only needs to go 3-
1-1 down the stretch to clinch a
share of the Pac-12 title. With five
games remaining in conference
play, the Cardinal's remaining op
ponents have, on average, won just a
third of their Pac-12 matches this
season.

Those teams will have to deal
with the increasingly impressive
scoring duo of seniors Teresa Noy
ola and Lindsay Taylor, who have
found the net a combined 16 times
this season and connected against
Arizona State for the second time in
as many games. Each forcing tough
saves early on for junior Sun Devil
goalkeeper Alyssa Gilmore, the
pair opened the scoring in the 25th
minute when a Noyola free kick re
sulted in a header goal by Taylor.

The tally gave Noyola her 34th ca
reer assist and put her within seven
helpers of Christen Press's school
record, set a year ago.
Nine minutes after Taylor's
opening goal, freshman forward
Chioma Ãœbogagu got hold of a de
flected clearing attempt and made
the score 2-0 with a quick left-foot
er.
In the second half, the task fell to
junior forward Marjani Hing-
Glover, making her first start of the
season and the fifth of her career
just a few miles from her home
town, Scottsdale, Ariz. A cross from
sophomore forward Natalie Griffen
in the 78th minute set up a one
timer by Hing-Glover, who found
the far post for her fifth goal of the
year.

substituted liberally throughout: a
total of 21 Cardinal players saw ac
tion, with none of them playing
fewer than 10 minutes.

Resting sophomore starting
goalkeeper Emily Oliver who

only had to make one save on the
night Ratcliffe turned to red
shirt sophomore goalie Aly Glea
son for her sixth appearance of the
season. Gleason was unable to stop
an 88th-minute penalty kick, the
Sun Devils' only goal, by redshirt
sophomore Nicki Stone. The penal
ty came off a hand-ball call in the
box just after an Arizona State cor
ner kick.
Stanford returns home next

weekend to face new Pac-12 addi
tions Utah and Colorado at Cagan
Stadium. The Utes, who face the
Cardinal on Friday at 7 p.m., are
currently tied for third place in the
conference, while the Buffaloes
may still be hoping to notch their
first-ever Pac-12 win in the Sunday
matinee.
