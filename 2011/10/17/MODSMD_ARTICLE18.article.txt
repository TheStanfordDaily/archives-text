# Win in Wazzu a tale of two halves
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
In this week's edition of Stat on
the Back, I'll take a look at
Stanford's 44-14 win over
Washington State.
Number of the game: 2
What it means: There are two
halves in a football game, and Stanford
only looked like itself for one of them.
Why it matters: The Cardinal has
been a second-half team all season.
Stanford has been good in the first half,
but after halftime, the Cardinal takes
things to another level. In six games,
Stanford has outscored its opponents
30-0, 27-7, 21-0, 28-12, 21-0 and 34-7
after the break. That's 161-26 in total.
And that's absurd. Stanford's sec
ond-half points alone would rank the
team 72nd in the country in scoring,
ahead of four Pac-12 teams. Mean
while, the defense has given up just
four scores in the second half all sea
son, and only one of these was against
the first-string defense. In general, the
Cardinal has looked virtually unstop
pable in second halves all season.
No game was a better example of
the proverbial "tale of two halves" than
Saturday's matchup with Washington
State. Stanford came out flat with an
Andrew Luck interception on the sec
ond play of the game, and things did
not get a whole lot better as the half
wore on. The defense responded well,
setting the offense up for an easy
touchdown to go up by 10, but another

turnover was too much for the defense
to handle, and the Cougars got on the
board to cut the lead to just three be
fore halftime.
While a 10-7 score at the break
might not seem like the end of the
world (it wasn't, as it turned out), the
bigger issue was the look of the team.
Stanford looked like it was uncomfort
able and frustrated, and the homecom
ing crowd at Martin Stadium felt like it
was spurring its Cougars on to a big
upset. This was the worst half Stanford
has played this year, and possibly the
worst first half in the past two years.
But, again, there are two halves in a
football game. After the break, Stan
ford went right back to being its domi
nant self, looking every bit like a na
tional-title contender in all three phas
es of the game.
Other notable numbers:
10-for-16, 89, 0,1: Luck's first-half
stat line says it all in terms of Stanford's
performance: 10-for-16 passing for just
89 yards, no touchdowns and an inter
ception. His first pass was severely un
derthrown, leading to his third inter
ception of the season and the first that
did not come on a tipped ball. Al
though he completed 10 of his remain
ing 15 passes, he still appeared out of
sync throughout the half, and his low
yardage total speaks to his struggles.
However, after the break...
13-for-20,247,4,0: Now there's the
Luck we've come to know and wor
ship. Completing 65 percent of his
passes isn't necessarily indicative of a
great half (he's completed over 73 per
cent for the season), but 247 yards and
four touchdowns speak for them
selves. Luck looked like the best player
in the country, throwing darts all over
the field. Why was he so successful?
Well, he remembered who his best
weapons are...
11,216,3: Stanford has great players
at every position, and the running
backs and receivers have performed
admirably. But the Cardinal's biggest
advantage over every team on its
schedule and probably over almost
any NFL team is its trio of unguard
able tight ends. You may have heard of
them.
However, you didn't hear much

about them in the first half Luck only
threw to the tight ends a few times in
the first 30 minutes, as the trio com
bined for just two catches (both by
Zach Ertz), 12 yards and no touch
downs. But after the break, Luck went
back to his bread and butter. His first
three passes of the second half were a
9-yard completion to Coby Fleener, a
62-yard completion to Fleener and a
10-yard touchdown to Levine Toilolo.
Another touchdown throw to Toilolo
and a fourth-quarter score for Fleener
gave Stanford's tight ends three touch
downs to bring their season tally to 12.
In all, nine of Luck's 13 second-half
completions went to tight ends, and the
trio combined for 216 yards, more than
the entire Washington State team.
10: Wide receiver Griff Whalen
primarily a third-down outlet in the
past was targeted on 10 of Luck's 36
passes. Whalen broke out with a ca
reer-high 92 yards last week against
Colorado, and he set another career
high with seven catches against Wash
ington State. Whalen has shown the
ability to go downfield and make
moves in space, as he has assumed the
No. 1 receiver role after a couple of in
consistent showings from, and injuries
to, senior Chris Owusu.
188, 7: The Cougars entered the
game ranked 13th in the country in
both yards and points. Stanford's first
string defense held Wazzu to just 188
total yards and seven points before
the Cougars' late touchdown drive in
garbage time. That's over 300 yards
and 30 points below Washington
State's season average, showing that
the Stanford defense didn't rack up
such great stats simply by playing bad
teams. Oh yeah, and the six sacks cer
tainly didn't hurt.
96: What's better than a 38-14 win
on the road? How about a 44-14 win on
the road? On the final play of the
game, true freshman Ty Montgomery
spun through a hole and took a kickoff
return 96 yards for a touchdown. It was
the first big sign of explosiveness from
the Stanford return game, and that sin
gle return bumped the Cardinal from
85th to ninth in the country in kickoff
returns.
Even more important to stat nerds

like me is that it kept a stunning streak
alive, Stanford came into the game
with eight consecutive wins by at least
25 points, dating back to last year. That
streak is the longest in conference his
tory, going all the way back to the Pacif
ic Coast Conference almost 100 years
ago.The streak looked to be over when
Cougar backup quarterback Marshall
Lobbestael ran for a touchdown to cut
the lead to 24 with just 13 seconds left.
But Montgomery had other ideas, and
just like that, the streak is up to nine. Of
course, the most important streak is
even longer...
14: It's been over a year since Stan
ford lost a football game, and the 14-
game streak is a new school record.
Next up to challenge the streak is

Washington, a team that lost 41-0 at
home the last time it squared off with
the Cardinal.
8: In the first BCS standings of the
season, Stanford came in at No. 8.
Among undefeated teams, only
Kansas State and Houston were
ranked lower. The Cardinal is fifth in
the Harris Poll, seventh in the coaches'
poll and eighth in the computers but
could get a boost if it beats the Huskies,
who snuck into the BCS standings at
No. 25.

the Back, I'll take a look at
Stanford's 44-14 win over
Washington State.
Number of the game: 2
What it means: There are two
halves in a football game, and Stanford
only looked like itself for one of them.
Why it matters: The Cardinal has
been a second-half team all season.
Stanford has been good in the first half,
but after halftime, the Cardinal takes
things to another level. In six games,
Stanford has outscored its opponents
30-0, 27-7, 21-0, 28-12, 21-0 and 34-7
after the break. That's 161-26 in total.
And that's absurd. Stanford's sec
ond-half points alone would rank the
team 72nd in the country in scoring,
ahead of four Pac-12 teams. Mean
while, the defense has given up just
four scores in the second half all sea
son, and only one of these was against
the first-string defense. In general, the
Cardinal has looked virtually unstop
pable in second halves all season.
No game was a better example of
the proverbial "tale of two halves" than
Saturday's matchup with Washington
State. Stanford came out flat with an
Andrew Luck interception on the sec
ond play of the game, and things did
not get a whole lot better as the half
wore on. The defense responded well,
setting the offense up for an easy
touchdown to go up by 10, but another

turnover was too much for the defense
to handle, and the Cougars got on the
board to cut the lead to just three be
fore halftime.
While a 10-7 score at the break
might not seem like the end of the
world (it wasn't, as it turned out), the
bigger issue was the look of the team.
Stanford looked like it was uncomfort
able and frustrated, and the homecom
ing crowd at Martin Stadium felt like it
was spurring its Cougars on to a big
upset. This was the worst half Stanford
has played this year, and possibly the
worst first half in the past two years.
But, again, there are two halves in a
football game. After the break, Stan
ford went right back to being its domi
nant self, looking every bit like a na
tional-title contender in all three phas
es of the game.
Other notable numbers:
10-for-16, 89, 0,1: Luck's first-half
stat line says it all in terms of Stanford's
performance: 10-for-16 passing for just
89 yards, no touchdowns and an inter
ception. His first pass was severely un
derthrown, leading to his third inter
ception of the season and the first that
did not come on a tipped ball. Al
though he completed 10 of his remain
ing 15 passes, he still appeared out of
sync throughout the half, and his low
yardage total speaks to his struggles.
However, after the break...
13-for-20,247,4,0: Now there's the
Luck we've come to know and wor
ship. Completing 65 percent of his
passes isn't necessarily indicative of a
great half (he's completed over 73 per
cent for the season), but 247 yards and
four touchdowns speak for them
selves. Luck looked like the best player
in the country, throwing darts all over
the field. Why was he so successful?
Well, he remembered who his best
weapons are...
11,216,3: Stanford has great players
at every position, and the running
backs and receivers have performed
admirably. But the Cardinal's biggest
advantage over every team on its
schedule and probably over almost
any NFL team is its trio of unguard
able tight ends. You may have heard of
them.
However, you didn't hear much

about them in the first half Luck only
threw to the tight ends a few times in
the first 30 minutes, as the trio com
bined for just two catches (both by
Zach Ertz), 12 yards and no touch
downs. But after the break, Luck went
back to his bread and butter. His first
three passes of the second half were a
9-yard completion to Coby Fleener, a
62-yard completion to Fleener and a
10-yard touchdown to Levine Toilolo.
Another touchdown throw to Toilolo
and a fourth-quarter score for Fleener
gave Stanford's tight ends three touch
downs to bring their season tally to 12.
In all, nine of Luck's 13 second-half
completions went to tight ends, and the
trio combined for 216 yards, more than
the entire Washington State team.
10: Wide receiver Griff Whalen
primarily a third-down outlet in the
past was targeted on 10 of Luck's 36
passes. Whalen broke out with a ca
reer-high 92 yards last week against
Colorado, and he set another career
high with seven catches against Wash
ington State. Whalen has shown the
ability to go downfield and make
moves in space, as he has assumed the
No. 1 receiver role after a couple of in
consistent showings from, and injuries
to, senior Chris Owusu.
188, 7: The Cougars entered the
game ranked 13th in the country in
both yards and points. Stanford's first
string defense held Wazzu to just 188
total yards and seven points before
the Cougars' late touchdown drive in
garbage time. That's over 300 yards
and 30 points below Washington
State's season average, showing that
the Stanford defense didn't rack up
such great stats simply by playing bad
teams. Oh yeah, and the six sacks cer
tainly didn't hurt.
96: What's better than a 38-14 win
on the road? How about a 44-14 win on
the road? On the final play of the
game, true freshman Ty Montgomery
spun through a hole and took a kickoff
return 96 yards for a touchdown. It was
the first big sign of explosiveness from
the Stanford return game, and that sin
gle return bumped the Cardinal from
85th to ninth in the country in kickoff
returns.
Even more important to stat nerds

like me is that it kept a stunning streak
alive, Stanford came into the game
with eight consecutive wins by at least
25 points, dating back to last year. That
streak is the longest in conference his
tory, going all the way back to the Pacif
ic Coast Conference almost 100 years
ago.The streak looked to be over when
Cougar backup quarterback Marshall
Lobbestael ran for a touchdown to cut
the lead to 24 with just 13 seconds left.
But Montgomery had other ideas, and
just like that, the streak is up to nine. Of
course, the most important streak is
even longer...
14: It's been over a year since Stan
ford lost a football game, and the 14-
game streak is a new school record.
Next up to challenge the streak is

Washington, a team that lost 41-0 at
home the last time it squared off with
the Cardinal.
8: In the first BCS standings of the
season, Stanford came in at No. 8.
Among undefeated teams, only
Kansas State and Houston were
ranked lower. The Cardinal is fifth in
the Harris Poll, seventh in the coaches'
poll and eighth in the computers but
could get a boost if it beats the Huskies,
who snuck into the BCS standings at
No. 25.
