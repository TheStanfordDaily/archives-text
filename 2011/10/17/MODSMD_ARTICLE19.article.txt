## Stanford alumni star on Day One of Pan American Games 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
A pair of Stanford swimmers
made a big splash at the Pan Ameri
can Games in Guadalajara, Mexico
Julia Smit 'lO won gold in the 400-
meter individual medley and Elaine
Breeden 'lO won a bronze medal in
the 100-meter butterfly on the first
official day of competition Saturday.
Additionally, the U.S. women's
volleyball team rolled to a straight
set victory in the opening match of
group play against Puerto Rico
with key contributions from recent
Cardinal graduates Cynthia Bar
boza 'O9, Alix Klineman 'll and
Cassidy Lichtman 'll.
Barboza, a three-time AVCA
First Team All-American on the
Farm, had nine kills and three
blocks in the win. Lichtman, herself
a two-time First Team All-Ameri-

can, chipped in with five kills and a
service ace as the Americans rolled
in the first of three pool-play match
es.
But it was Smit who seized the
spotlight with her performance in
the pool to win her first gold medal
at a major international competi
tion. The 26-time All-American,
who won three of her six NCAA ti
tles in the 400 IM, outpaced team
mate Allysa Vavra down the stretch.
Breeden came up a little bit short
in her bid to join Smit atop the podi
um but settled for bronze in a tight
race with Brazil's Daynara De Paula.
Both Breeden and Smit will have
more chances to add to their haul, as
the Pan Am Games continue
through Oct. 30. All in all, 26 current,
former or incoming Stanford ath
letes are participating in 13 different
sports at the Games.
