# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Farmer delivers keynote address to FACE AIDS Stanford-founded, group organizes national conference over weekend 
### MARY HARRISON 
Paul Farmer delivered the keynote address for the na
tional FACE AIDS conference Saturday evening in
Memorial Auditorium.

In his speech, Farmer addressed how youth can effect
positive changes to combat the AIDS epidemic.
Farmer is a professor at Harvard Medical School and
a founder of Partners in Health (PIH), a nonprofit organ
ization that is dedicated to providing quality health care
to villagers suffering in remote areas of Haiti, Rwanda,
Peru and about 10 other countries.

Stanford students founded FACE AIDS, a youth
movement to fight HIV and AIDS, in 2005. They have
since expanded to include over 210 chapters at colleges
and high schools across the country. FACE AIDS also
partners with students in Rwanda who work to address
community-based health issues.
Farmer said he has "reverence for the things that can
happen at age 22 or 23," because he began his work in the
Haitian village of Cange at that age. It was this work that
led him to found PIH.

"It is important to have imagination to see that things
that can be different, and I think generally youth have
that kind of imagination," he said.

Farmer also stated that the current establishment is
often closed-minded toward new ideas and possibilities
concerning AIDS prevention and treatment.
"Too often, they see it as an either-or situation," he
said. "We can either do prevention or provide care."
PIH, he stated, strives to provide both prevention and
treatment to patients suffering from AIDS.
"It is not rocket science to build and rebuild hospi-

tals," he said.
However, he said PIH has discovered that there is a
definite link between curing the sick and developing in
frastructure and the training of hospital employees.
Throughout his speech, Farmer praised the work of
student groups like FACE AIDS. Not only do they raise
valuable funds for AIDS research and patient care
FACE AIDS has raised a total of $2.3 million so far
but they raise awareness for the disease and its effects, he
said.

Oct. 13 to Oct. 16 marked FACE AIDS' national con
ference. Students from around the country came to Stan
ford's campus for ideas on how to improve their chapters'
effects in their community.
Farmer had many positive things to say about the state
of the AIDS epidemic worldwide. The cost of one year of
treatment used to be about $10,000; today, it is available
for between $6O and $BO. Additionally, both mother-to
child transmissions and new infection rates are falling
across Africa.

Rwanda especially has made what Farmer calls "as
tounding achievements" in addressing AIDS treatment.
The proportion of AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral
therapy (ART) has increased from virtually nothing to
one of the highest levels in Africa.

To FACE AIDS leaders, this news was very exciting.
"I came out of the conference energized and excited to
hear that what we do has had a
marked effect," said conference at
tendee and University of Texas sen
ior Kundan Verma.
Verma said that Farmer also in

spired him to lobby his members of
Congress on both sides of the aisle.
"This isn't a political issue; this
is a global issue," he said.
Stanford students had similar
positive reactions. Stephanie Navar
ro 'l5 said that she loved Farmer's
speaking style and that she didn't ex
pect him to be so funny. It also in
spired her to look into joining FACE
AIDS or another AIDS awareness
group on campus.
"Student groups like FACE
AIDS are particularly inspiring,"
Farmer said. "You don't share the

risks, you're not going to die of
cholera, but you still help ... the
jump from empathy and sympathy
to solidarity is most moving when
you have nothing in common."
