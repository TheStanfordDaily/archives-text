# E2.0 parts ways with ASSU
## Former co-chairs apologize for email 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
ASSU Co-Chairs of Entrepreneurship Dan
Thompson 'l3 and Jon Manzi 'l3 announced
their resignation last Friday in a letter sent out
to student email lists. In the letter, Thompson
and Manzi stated that E2.0 a branch of the
ASSU formed this year that advocates on be
half of student entrepreneurs on campus
would be separated from the rest of the student
government.
E2.0 will now function as an independent
student group and raise all funds from outside
sources, Thompson said.
The announcement came as part of a letter
in which E2.0 responded to criticisms regard
ing a mass email the organization sent out to
the student body Thursday morning, which ref
erenced Oprah Winfrey as a sexual-assault sur
vivor and an entrepreneur.
According to Thompson, the intention of
the initial email was to show that entrepre
neurship "was not just for the white, wealthy
computer scientists of the world" one of the
criticisms he said E2.0 had been receiving
but rather a force for social change. He said
that Winfrey's story was particularly empower
ing to him because he was a victim of violence
as a result of his sexual orientation.
Viviana Arcia 'l3, president of the
Women's Coalition, said in an email to The
Daily that the letter "made it seem as if all
survivors of sexual violence and abuse can
and should move beyond the assault and
should do so in an entrepreneurial, self-re
liant manner."
She said that this ignores the fact that
many survivors of sexual violence cannot
cope with the trauma without help from ex
ternal sources like counselors, family, friends
and advocates.
In their letter of resignation, Thompson
and Manzi stated that they "deeply regret that
this email may have hurt and offended nu
merous survivors and other concerned stu-
dents."
Thompson said he and Manzi in
dividually responded to all of the
negative feedback that they received
and communicated with the leaders
of women's organizations on cam
pus. He said E2.0 plans on forming a
board of students that would be re
sponsible for reaching out to differ
ent communities on campus, so they
could learn more about their individ
ual stories and determine how entre
preneurship could best benefit those
groups moving forward.
ASSU Vice President Stewart
Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 said that the
ASSU also apologizes for the letter
E2.0 sent out on Thursday and is in
the process of reaching out to the
communities and individuals who
have been affected.
Thompson said that E2.0 had
planned on separating from the
ASSU before this incident.
"[The email incident] didn't af
fect the decision,"Thompson said. "It
affected the timing."
According to Thompson, the
ASSU and E2.0 had been consider
ing the best way to separate from
each other since the beginning of the
school year in response to opinions
pieces criticizing the ASSU for be
coming too tech-oriented and entre
preneurial, which were published in
campus publications such as The Un
official Stanford Blog and The Daily
Thompson said, however, that
they were nervous that an an
nouncement of separation could
create "volatile press for the ASSU
and E2.0."
"We really wanted to frame [the
decision to separate E2.0 from the
ASSU] correctly," Thompson said.
"So we needed to respond to this
email, and we thought... we just
needed to do both at once or else we
are going to have two really dramat
ic emails in a row."
Thompson said that the mission
of E2.0 was to advocate on behalf of
student entrepreneurs on campus
a goal that didn't mesh well with
that of the ASSU, which is aimed at
serving all students. He said the deci
sion for E2.0 and the ASSU to part
ways was mutual.
"It seemed logical to separate the
two to allow E2.0 to fully embrace
entrepreneurship and the ASSU to
take a full-balance approach," Mac
gregor-Dennis said.
The ASSU Executive hired
Thompson and Manzi at the end of
last spring quarter to be Co-Chairs of
Entrepreneurship. Together with
Macgregor-Dennis, they decided to
form E2.0 within the framework of
the ASSU. According to Magregor-
Dennis, the goal of E2.0 was to "cre
ate a body that would realize the en
trepreneurship part of the platform
that we [ASSU President Michael

Cruz 'l2 and Macgregor-Dennis] ran
on."

Macgregor-Dennis said, howev
er, that the presence of E2.0 within
the ASSU made it look as if the
ASSU had a disproportionate focus
on entrepreneurship instead of on
the entire student body. He added
that those involved with E2.0, in
cluding himself, tended to be "loud"
about their initiatives, using social
media to talk about their projects in
ways that other parts of the ASSU
did not, which resulted in more press
attention.

"I have particular passions in en
trepreneurship and technology and
social entrepreneurship, but I think
the feedback has pushed me
rightly so to take a more balanced
approach," Macgregor-Dennis said.
"What I'm hoping moving forward is
that this will be a win-win for the
ASSU and E2.0, and I can still have
some my entrepreneurship passions
within the ASSU, but some more of
them can be realized outside of it."
It remains undecided in what ca
pacity, if any, Macgregor-Dennis will
continue to participate in E2.0. Mac
gregor-Dennis said the ASSU Exec
has also not determined yet whether
they will replace the Chairs of En
trepreneurship or leave the posi
tions vacant.

E2.0 will continue moving for
ward with its initiatives independ
ently, according to Thompson. He
said the organization's main projects
include creating an entrepreneur
ship-themed dorm on campus, de
veloping an entrepreneurship-men
torship program and interfacing
with the Graduate School of Busi
ness to establish a forum where busi
ness students could provide feed
back on undergraduate enterprises.
Thompson said they have already
started discussions with University
officials including President John
Hennessey and Dean of Residential
Education Deborah Golder
about creating the entrepreneurship
dorm, which is currently E2.o's main
objective.
"I honestly believe everything
that we're doing will be for the best
for Stanford, but I really appreciated
the feedback and didn't take it per
sonally," Thompson said. "A lot of
people felt this was not the role of the
ASSU, especially given the scope of
our initiatives. We were really taking
up a lot of press, so I understood
where people were coming from."
Macgregor-Dennis said he also
believes E2.0 will go on to create
positive change for entrepreneurs on
campus even though the organi
zation will now act separately from
the ASSU. He said that E2.0 has
served as a learning experience for
the ASSU Exec.

"I think we [the Exec] learned
that we need to make a conscious,
deliberate effort to serve all students
at all times," Macgregor-Dennis said.
