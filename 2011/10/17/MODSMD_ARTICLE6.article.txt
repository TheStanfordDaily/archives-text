## Transports 'on par' with 2010-11 University continues campaign against 'high-risk' drinking 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This year's number of alcohol-related transports, thir
teen as of Friday, Oct. 14, is on par so far with the number
that occurred last year, according to Ralph Castro, direc
tor of the new Office of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE).
This year, all of the cases were caused by excess con
sumption of hard alcohol and resulted in emergency
room entrance at the Stanford Hospital & Clinics. This
year's cases help demonstrate the increasing prevalence
of "pre-gaming" with hard alcohol, or consuming hard al
cohol before going out to parties, Castro said.
The most recent transport incidents occurred dur
ing Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ), Castro said,
adding five cases to the year's total count. During the
2010-11 academic year, 16 transports occurred by the
end of the third week; last year, FMOTQ took place

during week six.
"The number of transports is on
par with where we've been over the
last three years," Castro said. "The
number of alcohol-related trans
ports has been climbing up over the
past three years."

Transports Rising
Alcohol transports declined from
119 cases in 2004-05 to 37 cases dur
ing the 2007-08 school year, Castro
said. The numbers have risen since
then, with 52 transports in 2008-09,61
between 2009 and 2010 and 64 trans
ports last year.

Castro mentioned almost five
years' worth of data showing the in
crease of hard liquor in the form of
shots by Stanford students.
"One hundred percent of stu
dents that have gone to the ER have
misused or abused hard liquor," Cas
tro said. "About 85 percent of stu
dents who have gone to the ER have
engaged in pre-gaming behaviors be
fore they go out, and with hard
liquor."

Students who pre-game with hard
liquor place themselves at much
greater risk of alcohol poisoning and
ER transport than students who do
not, Castro said.
"That's what we're focusing on
when we talk about 'high-risk drink
ing,"' Castro said. "We're trying to
develop a culture that deempha
sizes hard-liquor consumption
among students that gets them
to understand the risks associated
with it."

The freshman class tends to repre
sent a large proportion of the alcohol
transports, but not the majority when
compared to the rest of the under
graduate and graduate communities,
Castro said. The junior class is least
represented.
Of the 13 transports this year,
eight were male and five were fe
male. All were undergraduates
five each in the classes of 2014 and
2015, one junior and two seniors.
Citations at Stanford
The number of alcohol transports
is independent of the number of alco
hol citations which the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety (SDPS)
grants, according to Castro.
"Last year, we had some of the
lowest liquor-law citations on cam
pus yet one of the highest transport
numbers that we've had over the past
five years," Castro said.
From Sept. 20 to Oct. 12 of this
year, the SDPS issued two Minor in
Possession of Alcohol (MIP) cita
tions, four Drunk in Public (DIP) ci
tations and one Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) ticket, according to
SDPS Public Information Officer
Bill Larson.
Larson also said that SDPS issued
15 DIPs, 20 MIPs and two DUIs dur
ing the 2010-11 academic year to
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents.

"We partner with the police and
see them as an integral part of what
we do," Castro said. "Being cited by
the police for an MIP or DIP is part of
the educational milieu students
learn a lot when they have to go to
court."

Nationwide Trends
Castro said other universities are
also witnessing trends in excess con
sumption of hard liquor.
Though citations at Stanford were
low last year, alcohol citations and
transports have been increasing
across colleges nationwide.
A Yale Daily News report found
that alcohol-related incidents in
creased by 27 percent at Yale Univer
sity between 2008 and 2009, and Yale
officials suggested a five-year escalat
ing trend in alcohol abuse.

Alcohol violations increased 13
percent at the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles last year, according
to the Daily Bruin, UCLA's student
newspaper, and rose from 29 cases to
137 to 238 at the University of South
ern California (USC) between 2008
and 2010, according to the Daily Tro
jan, USC's student paper.

Harvard, which saw a similar de
crease in transports from 2005-2008,
has experienced an increase in trans
ports over the last three years, accord
ing to The Crimson. UC-Berkeley re
ported twice as many transports dur
ing the first few weeks of the semester
this year as compared to last year, ac
cording to a Daily Californian article.

New Stanford Initiatives

Back on the Farm, Castro said
that the OAPE is working to offer al
cohol-free alternatives to "target pre
gaming behavior."
"Students might feel more in
clined to go to social events that
deemphasize alcohol beforehand,"
Castro said.

Cardinal Nights is one such alter
native that OAPE sponsors, Castro
wrote in a separate email to The
Daily.

"Cardinal Nights is the new initia
tive to provide more alcohol-free op
tions for socializing on weekends,"
wrote Angelina Cardona 'll in an
email to The Daily.
Cardona, who served as ASSU
president during the 2010-11 school
year, is now an assistant director and
community engagement coordinator
for OAPE. Over 250 and 100 stu
dents respectively attended TGIF
and Bingo Night Cardinal Nights'
first two events according to Car
dona.

For the remaining weekends of
October, Cardinal Nights will spon
sor six alcohol-free social events, as
well as one on Halloween. Events in
clude a partnership with FLiCKS, a
comedy show next Saturday, a semi
formal homecoming party the fol
lowing weekend and a Stanford-
USC game-viewing party the week
end after that, Cardona said.

Cardinal Nights also offers grants
to dormitories, students groups and
individuals to fund their own alcohol
free events, Cardona added.
"Our goal is to provide a more vi
brant social scene on campus that
gives students options for how they
spend their weekend nights," Car
dona said.

OAPE is also working with resi
dential staff to discourage students
from high-risk drinking.
"We're working with staff to ask
students really pointed questions
about what their plans are for the
night so that they can start to inter
vene early and prevent problems be
fore they begin," Castro said.

tions, four Drunk in Public (DIP) ci
tations and one Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) ticket, according to
SDPS Public Information Officer
Bill Larson.
Larson also said that SDPS issued
15 DIPs, 20 MIPs and two DUIs dur
ing the 2010-11 academic year to
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents.

"We partner with the police and
see them as an integral part of what
we do," Castro said. "Being cited by
the police for an MIP or DIP is part of
the educational milieu students
learn a lot when they have to go to
court."

Nationwide Trends
Castro said other universities are
also witnessing trends in excess con
sumption of hard liquor.
Though citations at Stanford were
low last year, alcohol citations and
transports have been increasing
across colleges nationwide.
A Yale Daily News report found
that alcohol-related incidents in
creased by 27 percent at Yale Univer
sity between 2008 and 2009, and Yale
officials suggested a five-year escalat
ing trend in alcohol abuse.

Alcohol violations increased 13
percent at the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles last year, according
to the Daily Bruin, UCLA's student
newspaper, and rose from 29 cases to
137 to 238 at the University of South
ern California (USC) between 2008
and 2010, according to the Daily Tro
jan, USC's student paper.

Harvard, which saw a similar de
crease in transports from 2005-2008,
has experienced an increase in trans
ports over the last three years, accord
ing to The Crimson. UC-Berkeley re
ported twice as many transports dur
ing the first few weeks of the semester
this year as compared to last year, ac
cording to a Daily Californian article.

New Stanford Initiatives

Back on the Farm, Castro said
that the OAPE is working to offer al
cohol-free alternatives to "target pre
gaming behavior."
"Students might feel more in
clined to go to social events that
deemphasize alcohol beforehand,"
Castro said.

Cardinal Nights is one such alter
native that OAPE sponsors, Castro
wrote in a separate email to The
Daily.

"Cardinal Nights is the new initia
tive to provide more alcohol-free op
tions for socializing on weekends,"
wrote Angelina Cardona 'll in an
email to The Daily.
Cardona, who served as ASSU
president during the 2010-11 school
year, is now an assistant director and
community engagement coordinator
for OAPE. Over 250 and 100 stu
dents respectively attended TGIF
and Bingo Night Cardinal Nights'
first two events according to Car
dona.

For the remaining weekends of
October, Cardinal Nights will spon
sor six alcohol-free social events, as
well as one on Halloween. Events in
clude a partnership with FLiCKS, a
comedy show next Saturday, a semi
formal homecoming party the fol
lowing weekend and a Stanford-
USC game-viewing party the week
end after that, Cardona said.

Cardinal Nights also offers grants
to dormitories, students groups and
individuals to fund their own alcohol
free events, Cardona added.
"Our goal is to provide a more vi
brant social scene on campus that
gives students options for how they
spend their weekend nights," Car
dona said.

OAPE is also working with resi
dential staff to discourage students
from high-risk drinking.
"We're working with staff to ask
students really pointed questions
about what their plans are for the
night so that they can start to inter
vene early and prevent problems be
fore they begin," Castro said.

This year's number of alcohol-related transports, thir
teen as of Friday, Oct. 14, is on par so far with the number
that occurred last year, according to Ralph Castro, direc
tor of the new Office of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE).
This year, all of the cases were caused by excess con
sumption of hard alcohol and resulted in emergency
room entrance at the Stanford Hospital & Clinics. This
year's cases help demonstrate the increasing prevalence
of "pre-gaming" with hard alcohol, or consuming hard al
cohol before going out to parties, Castro said.
The most recent transport incidents occurred dur
ing Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ), Castro said,
adding five cases to the year's total count. During the
2010-11 academic year, 16 transports occurred by the
end of the third week; last year, FMOTQ took place


OLLIE KHAKWANI/The Stanford Daily
during week six.
"The number of transports is on
par with where we've been over the
last three years," Castro said. "The
number of alcohol-related trans
ports has been climbing up over the
past three years."

Transports Rising
Alcohol transports declined from
119 cases in 2004-05 to 37 cases dur
ing the 2007-08 school year, Castro
said. The numbers have risen since
then, with 52 transports in 2008-09,61
between 2009 and 2010 and 64 trans
ports last year.

Castro mentioned almost five
years' worth of data showing the in
crease of hard liquor in the form of
shots by Stanford students.
"One hundred percent of stu
dents that have gone to the ER have
misused or abused hard liquor," Cas
tro said. "About 85 percent of stu
dents who have gone to the ER have
engaged in pre-gaming behaviors be
fore they go out, and with hard
liquor."

Students who pre-game with hard
liquor place themselves at much
greater risk of alcohol poisoning and
ER transport than students who do
not, Castro said.
"That's what we're focusing on
when we talk about 'high-risk drink
ing,"' Castro said. "We're trying to
develop a culture that deempha
sizes hard-liquor consumption
among students that gets them
to understand the risks associated
with it."

The freshman class tends to repre
sent a large proportion of the alcohol
transports, but not the majority when
compared to the rest of the under
graduate and graduate communities,
Castro said. The junior class is least
represented.
Of the 13 transports this year,
eight were male and five were fe
male. All were undergraduates
five each in the classes of 2014 and
2015, one junior and two seniors.
Citations at Stanford
The number of alcohol transports
is independent of the number of alco
hol citations which the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety (SDPS)
grants, according to Castro.
"Last year, we had some of the
lowest liquor-law citations on cam
pus yet one of the highest transport
numbers that we've had over the past
five years," Castro said.
From Sept. 20 to Oct. 12 of this
year, the SDPS issued two Minor in
Possession of Alcohol (MIP) cita
tions, four Drunk in Public (DIP) ci
tations and one Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) ticket, according to
