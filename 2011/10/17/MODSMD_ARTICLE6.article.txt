## Transports 'on par' with 2010-11 University continues campaign against 'high-risk' drinking 
### KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This year's number of alcohol-related transports, thir
teen as of Friday, Oct. 14, is on par so far with the number
that occurred last year, according to Ralph Castro, direc
tor of the new Office of Alcohol Policy and Education
(OAPE).
This year, all of the cases were caused by excess con
sumption of hard alcohol and resulted in emergency
room entrance at the Stanford Hospital & Clinics. This
year's cases help demonstrate the increasing prevalence
of "pre-gaming" with hard alcohol, or consuming hard al
cohol before going out to parties, Castro said.
The most recent transport incidents occurred dur
ing Full Moon on the Quad (FMOTQ), Castro said,
adding five cases to the year's total count. During the
2010-11 academic year, 16 transports occurred by the
end of the third week; last year, FMOTQ took place
