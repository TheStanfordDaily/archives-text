## TREND Prereqs manage increasing numbers 
### CAROLINE CHEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A number of first-year or introducto
ry-level classes, including Math 51,
Chem 31A, Econ 1A and CS 106A,
with 600 students enrolled this quar
ter, have seen increased enrollment
over the past few years, while various depart
ments have employed a variety of tactics to
keep students engaged.
Math 51 is one of the most commonly taken
introductory courses, with 300 students en
rolled this fall. Besides being a prerequisite for
many classes, mathematics professor Rafe
Mazzeo believes that the class is popular be
cause it is crafted specifically for students who
have completed the AP test in calculus.
"Unlike [students at] a lot of other colleges,
people at Stanford come in with AP credit in
calculus," Mazzeo said. "However, few people
have taken linear algebra. So it's a class that
puts everyone on the same playing field and
evens out the disparities."
However, instead of teaching one big lec
ture, the department decided to split Math 51
into seven different lectures taught by four
professors. Each professor has two teaching
assistants assigned to teach sections.
"We decided to keep lectures to 50 students
and sections to 25," Mazzeo said. "Students
have responded really well, and speaking as a
teacher, it's more fun and more engaging to
teach a class of that size,"
Mazzeo and his colleagues also meet regu
larly to make sure that they are on the same
page in terms of teaching pace and homework.
"We coordinate because students shop
around at the start of the year," he said. "We try
to have things as uniform as possible so stu
dents can switch [between lecture classes] if
they need to."
Kenji Kozai, a Math 51TA and fourth-year
graduate student in mathematics, believes that
having multiple sections with different TAs is
better for the students.
"Different students learn better from dif
ferent teaching styles," he said. "Having a vari
ety of TAs to choose from makes it more like
ly they can find something suitable to their
own learning style."
In the Chemistry Department, enrollment
in the introductory-level Chem 31A has also
increased over the years, rising sharply from
192 students in 2004 to 462 this year. The class
is split into two groups: morning and afternoon
lectures.
"Besides lectures, we have weekly lab and
discussion sections with small groups of stu
dents, outreach sections twice a week, nearly
daily office hours by instructors or teaching as
sistants and an online question-and-answer
system," said chemistry professor Hongjie Dai.
"Students are taught in these different settings
to make sure that they grasp the important
chemistry concepts and have mechanisms in
place to give students personal attention and
help when needed."
While Math 51 and Chem 31A have chosen
to subdivide the class into lecture sections,
other introductory courses have chosen to
teach all students together. Some of these class
es, like Econ 1A and CS 106A, are popular in
part because of their lecturers both eco
nomics professor John Taylor Ph.D. '73 (Econ
1A) and computer science professor Mehran
Sahami '92 M.S. '93 Ph.D. '99 (CS 106A) have
achieved "celebrity" status on campus.
Both Taylor and Sahami aim to keep class
entertaining so that they can engage with all
the students.
"In the lecture, we encourage questions and
comments from students, now providing mi
crophones so everyone can participate," Tay
lor said. "To liven things up, we do various
other things. I invite my family to join me on
the stage to illustrate economic concepts and
use You Tube videos to give examples of cur
rent events."
Sahami is known for pelting his class with
candy in return for questions and for using a
light saber as a pointer. He draws on anecdotes
and funny analogies most recently, an ex
tended analogy involving the Mona Lisa and a
chainsaw to demonstrate concepts in pro
gramming.
Students seem satisfied with the various ac
commodations the departments have chosen
to take.
"I think Stanford does a pretty good job
with large classes," said Kuno Choi 'l4, who is
taking Math 51 and Econ IA. "The lecture-sec
tion-homework triangle covers the material
well enough."
Ultimately, the success of these large-sized
introductory classes is not so much in what tac
tic the professors choose to employ so much as
their commitment to meeting their students'
needs. Mazzeo summed up these professors'
attitudes toward finding the best way to teach.
"You have to be continually vigilant," he
said.
