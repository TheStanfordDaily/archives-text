## A 						musical marvel Restaging the performing arts 
### STEPHANIE WANG 
Seemingly moments after
unveiling the new Stan
ford Stadium, Stanford
announced in the fall of
2006 that it would build a
home for the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra and Wind Ensemble.
Peter Bing '55 and his wife Helen
made a $5O million donation for
its construction, which was sup
plemented by supporters of the
arts and Stanford Symphony Or
chestra fans. With a budget of
$llO million, the Bing Concert

Hall is expected to combine
acoustical excellence and intima
cy with the adaptability necessary
for the performing arts groups on
campus.
Although the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra and Wind En
semble will rehearse in the con
cert hall, the venue will be shared
among all music groups on cam
pus, including Stanford Taiko, a
student group of taiko drummers,
and Stanford Lively Arts, an or
ganization that brings visiting
performers and artists to the
Stanford community.

"The concert hall is truly a
shared space," said Stephen Sano
'9l D.M.A. '94, chair of the music
department and conductor of the
Stanford Chamber Chorale.

He emphasized that while the
concert hall has been on the De
partment of Music's wish list for a
long time, Stanford Lively Arts
and the Drama Department will
have equal access to the concert
hall. Also, student-run ensembles
like the a cappella groups on cam
pus will have the opportunity to

perform in the venue.
In addition to hosting traditional
forms of music, the Bing Concert
Hall is designed to accommodate
many unconventional forms of
music that are unique to Stanford,
including the laptop and mobile
phone orchestras.
"The faculty, staff and students
from the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics were
critical in helping specify what the
needs would be for reproduction of
computer music," said Sano.

The new concert hall is a part of
Stanford's effort to increase stu
dents' appreciation for the arts and
is meant to foster creativity and
perspective in its students.
"The concert hall is a very big
part of the Stanford Arts Initiative,"
said Matthew Tiews '99 Ph.D. 'O4,
the executive director of arts pro
grams for the School of Humanities
and Sciences. "The Stanford Arts
Initiative has been this University
wide effort to do more in the arts ..
. and to integrate the arts more into
student life and [into] the research
and teaching initiative in the Uni
versity."
In an effort to promote appreci
ation of the arts in the Stanford
community, the Bing Concert Hall

brought together a team of world
class architects and acousticians to
create intimacy between the audi
ence and the performers.
"I think it's an interesting chal
lenge for an architect," said Jenny
Bilfield, the artistic and executive
director of Stanford Lively Arts.
According to Bilfield, the plan
ners are trying to build a concert
hall that harmonizes with the rest of
the campus, while also retaining its
own distinct architecture.
The Bing Concert Hall is expect
ed to finish construction in the sum
mer of 2012 and to open in January
2013.
