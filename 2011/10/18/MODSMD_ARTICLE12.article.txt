# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## Social geography 
### Nina Chung 
People are social chameleons.
We respond to people and fol
low suit; we tone down this and
crank up that , depending. And this
social camouflage is a specialty of
Stanford students in particular. Most
of us step through numerous worlds
of responsibility discussion sec
tion, community service, political
campaign, startup entrepreneurship,
sib stuff, club sports, roommate, best
friend, party girl and our present
ed identities flow between them like
water. We can handle the pre-profes
sional mixer after discussion section
and the frat party after that. We can
lead hours-long sections on sustain
ability and walk out of class whisper
ing gossip to our girlfriends. We don't
simply wear multiple hats, oh no
we have wardrobes to match. Natu
rally, after years of role-playing, we
know who to be, and when.
But it's not always intentional.
There are times when our social
adaptation skills kick in without our
full consent. You must have noticed
how effortlessly "I hate" fosters "me
TOO" or how complaints are like
quick-bread for bonding here
among us confident, privileged
young university people. We hear di
alogue cues and instinctively match
them, even if we don't always agree.
It's essentially the very useful skill of
social accommodation. The only
problem is that I hate always saying
what I hate, and I'm bothered by
constant complaints. I refuse to be
lieve that's my natural state of con
versation. Yet I've recently found
myself falling into these exact traps
with certain repeat offenders I know,
people who seem to somehow oper
ate on toxic thinking. As I found my
self cooperating with my peers' con
stant negativity (then trying desper
ately to counter it), I started asking
myself: how much does social geog
raphy dictate our personality?
The situation we're all familiar
with is the roommate one. With room
mates, we're not just living with a dif

ferent neatness type or sleeping
schedule, we're living with an entirely
new set of assumptions about life and
everyday living. It's like going into
someone else's kitchen and trying to
cook with them: they could be using
utensils you never knew existed and
cutting their onions in a revolutionary
way, and it's basically like dancing
with a new partner. In the intimate
setting of a single room, even the least
bit of adjustment is necessary. With all
of our individual quirks, some have to
give way to others or find a new
groove to fit into. In other words, we
adopt the other's quirks out of fond
ness, meet them halfway, or react with
confrontation (or, most unfortunate
ly, passive aggressiveness). In the
space of two people, there's actually
not that much space. Influence hap
pens. We've all heard the horror sto
ries. (Which means some of us have
been the horror stories.)
Obviously, it's not all horror.
When we spend a lot of time with
someone we admire, we also absorb
their habits, attitudes and catch
phrases, but unhesitatingly. We natu
rally emulate those we are attracted
to, and it's okay because we like
them. I remember noticing this for
the first time in fifth grade: I discov
ered that my math teacher had a
wife, who looked so similar to him!
And most accustomed couples do
the same they begin recreating
each other's facial expressions, the
way best friends start talking like
each other. (I wish I could connect
this to how dog owners almost al
ways look like their canines, right?!
But maybe I'm stretching it.)
As a result, people are sometimes
walking scrapbooks of people
they've met a collection of sou
venirs taken from admired personal
ities. I can source many of my own
quotidian characteristics to people
I've gravitated to over the past 21
years. Random ones include making
friendship bracelets (I know,
quaint), little hellos on Post-it notes,

wearing socks or slippers at home,
urges to drink espresso at breakfast
(life in Florence)... People who
were and are closest to me have
highlighted colors in my character
and maybe dulled others.
Remember Darwin's finches?
(It's okay I just Wiki-ed them,
too.) They diverged into different
species after centuries of settling on
distinct islands. We're the finches, so
ciety-style. The world says, "Pick
your friends wisely," but it's easy to
tut-tut; it's easy to imagine that we
have full control over how we act
and react to people. But I believe
that we enter the world with genes,
which give us oodles of unique possi
bilities, and then we enter various so
cieties, which exaggerate and value
parts of us differently. And, general
ly, I believe we're completely un
aware while it's happening. Where
does our decision-making lie, then?
It lies in who we decide to surround
ourselves with, maintain relation
ships with, choose to withdraw from,
cut off. Other people may not dictate
our personality that's all on us
but if they can spike it, why not
choose sweet over sour?
