## Iranian political prisoner sheds light on sin, innocence 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Shahla Talebi, assistant professor
of religious studies at Arizona State
University, spoke Monday evening
about her time as a political prison
er in Iran and read from her book
detailing her prison ordeal.
The talk, entitled "Revisiting
Ghosts of Revolution: A Reading
and a Reflection on Rekindled
Memories of Imprisonment in
Iran," was part of the Iranian Stud
ies Lecture Series.
Talebi read excerpts from her
book, "Ghosts of Revolution:
Rekindled Memories of Imprison
ment in Iran," and elaborated on
what she has gained from her years
in prison.
Talebi, who was born and raised
in Iran, stressed the importance of
having empathy for others and ex
plained that once people lose the
ability to empathize, they are living
in a state of imprisonment, regard
less of whether or not they are phys
ically behind bars.
"The moment that today in our
society we see our neighbors, we see
people that go through life with ex
cruciating humiliation every day,
and we are okay with that, the doors
are open for any other prison," she
said. "The prison is not just the walls
that are created."
Talebi's pro-women's rights and
pro-labor activism landed her in
prison, first for two years from 1977
to 1979 and then for nearly nine
years from 1983 to 1992. She arrived
in the United States in 1994 and
earned an undergraduate degree in
social-cultural anthropology from
UC-Berkeley. In 2007 Talebi gradu
ated from Columbia University
with a doctorate in social-cultural
anthropology.
Talebi's readings from her tale
of survival took the audience to
scenes of torture and psychologi
cal despair. In one situation,
guards beat her in front of her par
ents inside a visiting room. She was
forced to witness the torture of her
husband, also a political prisoner.
In another excerpt, she spoke
about her childhood and explained
how a group of boys tortured a dog
through merciless beating.
Talebi also described prison
guards forcing inmates to play the
role of dogs and donkeys, with

guards then riding the inmates.
"What I was trying to do is to say
that these torturers had not fallen
from any other planet, and neither
were we these angelic human be
ings," she said.
Talebi gave much attention to
the power of the imagination and its
role in allowing one to endure strug
gle.
"In prison you have your imagi
nation," she said. "So despite the
walls, despite everything that you
are dealing with, the torture, there
are sometimes moments when you
have your imagination that allows
you to fly out of those narrow bars
of the cell and allows you to go and
hear the laughter and see people
loving each other."
Talebi touched on the "luxury"
that women in prison in Iran had
over men: having the company of
children. She said that having the
children of inmates nearby provid
ed prisoners the opportunity to
teach them about the outside world,
to explain to them how plants grow,
what a river is and the many differ
ent kinds of animals that live be
yond the prison walls. She conclud
ed her talk by emphasizing that
every moment should be one of re
flection, response and constant in
quiry.
Several audience members said
they felt it was enlightening to learn
about Talebi's story.
"It saddened me to hear her
story," said Farshid Boroumand, a
member of the community who left
Iran in 1979 after Ayatollah
Khomeini's Islamic Revolution. "It
opens your eyes to the dark world of
prison in third-world countries like
Iran."
For Hooshyar Naraghi, also a
local resident, attending the talk
gave him a new perspective on the
complex relationships that develop
in prison.
"For me, I always looked at tor
ture in prison in a very academic
way, especially with the situation in
Guantanamo and all the things we
have heard in the last 10 years," he
said. "But this was a different thing
because now, to me, it's a relation
ship between the torturer and the
tortured."
