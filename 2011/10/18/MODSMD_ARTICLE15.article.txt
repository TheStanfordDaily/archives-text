## LATE WINNER Tie-breaking goal helps Card beat Cal 
### SARAH MAISEL 
In a thrilling and emotional 3-2
victory Sunday afternoon in
Berkeley, No. 9 Stanford (12-2,5-0
NorPac) overcame No. 12 Califor
nia (12-3, 3-2) to secure the Nor-
Pac West Division regular season
title, the No. 1 seed in the NorPac
Tournament and the continued
dominance over its rival across the
Bay. Stanford, which has not lost to
Cal this season, has won nine of 12
matchups in the overall series.

The Cardinal started strong with
a goal from junior defender Becky
Dru off a penalty stroke in the sev
enth minute. But Cal's Andrea
Earle answered with a hard goal of
her own late in the first period to tie
the game 1-1 at the break.
In a testament to the Cardinal
defense, Cal failed to score on eight
penalty corners in the first 11 min
utes of the second half. And it was

redshirt sophomore defender
Colleen Ryan who regained the lead
for the Cardinal in the 17th minute
with an assist from sophomore at
tacker Courtney Haldeman.
Although Cal answered just
four minutes later with a goal from
Rachelle Comeau to tie the score at
2-2, Stanford pushed through for
the win. In the final four minutes,
redshirt sophomore attacker Emily
Henriksson sealed the game, tap
ping in the ball off a deflection from
Cal goalkeeper Maddie Hand. The
Cardinal held on for the 3-2 win,
just as it did in the last matchup be
tween the teams on Sept. 23.
The offensive battle between
the teams was fairly even; Stanford
just barely outshot Cal 12-11, and
both teams attempted 10 penalty
corners.
The Cardinal defense, never wa
vering against a California team
hungry to send its seniors out with a
win in its final home game of the
season, came up big for the team.
"We wanted to focus on matching
[Cal's] energy and sticking with
them defensively," said sophomore
attacker Hope Burke. "I think our
defensive play against Cal today
was what made the difference."
Given both teams' solid
records in conference play, it is
likely they will meet again in the
NorPac Tournament.

"Every time we play each other
it's always an intense, exciting
game. You wouldn't want anything
else," Burke said. "For now, we'll
just keep focusing on executing
the game plan and making the
most of our opportunities."
Sunday's intense matchup
proved to be an exciting change
of pace from the Cardinal's 7-0
rout of Pacific (2-10,0-5 NorPac)
this past Friday. There, it was the
Cardinal's dynamic offense on
display with season highs of
seven goals and 30 shots. It was a
welcome confidence booster for
the Card after a tough 6-3 loss at
the hands of New Hampshire last
weekend.
Stanford's Ryan and Halde
man scored in the first half to lead
2-0 at halftime, but the offense
truly exploded after the break.
Burke, scoring twice, was aided by
goals from Henriksson, freshman
defender Kelsey Harbin and red
shirt junior attacker Devon Hol
man to send the Tigers packing.
Dru, who attempted a game-high
five shots, also tallied an assist.
The Cardinal will finish confer
ence play with a home matchup
against UC-Davis this Friday at 7
p.m.
