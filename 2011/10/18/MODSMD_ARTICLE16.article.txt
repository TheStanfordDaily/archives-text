# Red Zone point system is flawed
## 
### Tom Taylor 
Last week I took aim at the lack
of raucous support at Stan
ford Stadium and particularly
at the Axe Committee, but
I'm starting to wonder if my
accusations were a bit misplaced. So now
it's time to fry bigger fish —the Depart
ment of Athletics.
The main concern I have is over the
Red Zone point system.This year, extra
points can be earned by attending some
of the non-football events on campus,
and at first glance this seems like a great
idea. Cardinal fans are rewarded for
showing their support at something
other than football games, and the
smaller sports should benefit from big
ger crowds and perhaps even get the
chance to convince a few more students
to start following them more regularly.
But the system is flawed. Not only is
there no guarantee that students won't
just scan their IDs and leave and
don't be fooled, I know at least some of
you do but the Athletics Depart
ment has also chosen to pick games that
clash with the football schedule. Satur
day was a case in point; the Red Zone
point-earning women's volleyball
game against Washington started at 7
p.m., just two and a half hours after the
football team kicked off against Wash
ington State in Pullman. Anyone with a
passing knowledge of college football
should realize games run more than
two and a half hours.
I left the TV with 14 seconds re
maining because I wanted to do more
than just rack up Red Zone points; I ac
tually thought it would be an interesting
excuse to watch some volleyball. I
caught the last set but missed a 96-yard
kickoff return for a Stanford touch
down.

Committed Cardinal football fans
are given a tough choice.To guarantee a
seat at the big home football games,
they may have to skip watching part of
some of the away games on TV. And
women's volleyball is not the only po
tential schedule clash this season. The
women's soccer game against Cal
might suffer the same fate, depending
on what time the Oregon State game
gets scheduled.
I don't want to criticize the Athletics
Department too much because it is
hard to complain when you get the
chance to go to every home game of
every sport for free, but I do have to
wonder how it made a decision that
technically may reward fans for not
watching away games. Was this simply a
scheduling error or a consequence of
outside forces dictating kickoff times, or
could it be that the department funda
mentally doesn't understand what it
should mean to be a dedicated fan, that
people want to watch both the home
and away games?
At the end of the day, gaining points
does not make you a good fan —it
means you're smart and know how to
work the system. Many of those with the
most points will have spent less time
watching Stanford sports in the flesh
than those below them. If the Athletics
Department really wants to assign
points like this, perhaps it should try
scanning students both in and out and
giving out points according to total time
in the stadium.
The other justification for turning
my attention on the Athletics Depart
ment is the protestations I got from a
few member's of the Axe Committee
last week. I can't excuse them of every
thing I still feel they could do more
from within the Red Zone rather than
on the field but it does seem that
their hands are tied in terms of what
they are allowed to get away with.They
can't, for example, swear or demean the
other team.
I'm sure that rule is not an exclusive
ly Cardinal one, but it does seem quite
strange if you think about it. The foot
ball field is a realm of intense violence
where players can do things that would
get them in serious trouble elsewhere
shoulder barging a fellow citizen to
the ground is not usually acceptable.
Families with young children sit in the

bleachers and happily watch and en
courage what goes on without worry
ing about the lesson this might be
teaching their offspring. Would the odd
curse word yelled out in this controlled

environment really be that shocking
and damaging?
I guess this might just be me railing
against authority maybe I should be

occupying Wall Street instead of writ
ing this column but I simply don't
get the rules that the powers that be de
cide for us.
