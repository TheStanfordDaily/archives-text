# OFFENSIVE OUTBURST
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Most of the men's soccer team's early strug
gles this season came from a frustrating difficul
ty with finishing scoring opportunities. But for
20 minutes against Oregon State on Sunday, all
those troubles were forgotten as Stanford
seemingly couldn't miss the Cardinal scored
three goals early and held on late for a 3-2 win
as it salvaged a weekend split in conference play
after losing 2-0 to Washington on Friday.

The win over the Beavers (3-8-2,1-3-1 Pac
-12) was Stanford's first in Pac-12 play and
couldn't have come at a better time for the Car
dinal (4-7-2,1-3-1), which must find its top gear
in a hurry if it hopes to sneak into the NCAA
Tournament in November. It certainly will have
the opportunity to play its way in, with home
games against the top two teams in the confer
ence, No. 9 UCLA and No. 24 San Diego State,
looming in two weeks.
But the story Sunday was redshirt senior
midfielder Garrett Gunther, who broke
through with the first multi-goal game of his ca
reer. The Long Beach native opened the scoring
in the 10th minute when sophomore midfielder
J.J. Koval played a deep ball into a very danger
ous area at the top of the goal box. Oregon State
goalie Steve Spangler charged off his line and
attempted to clear the ball away, but Gunther
got to it first and flicked the ball over Spangler
into the empty net.
After going four games with just one goal, it
was a welcome sight for the Cardinal to be cele
brating on the field. Just a minute later, Stanford
struck again. Senior defender Adoni Levine
threw the ball in to Gunther, who immediately
played the ball across the field towards goal,
where senior Alexander Binnie was ready and
waiting to head the ball into the back of the net
for his second goal of the season and his career.
A few minutes later, Gunther got on the
board again with a one-touch finish past Span
gler, sending the crowd of 719 to its feet in ap
preciation. Head coach Bret Simon lauded

Gunther's effort not just this weekend, but as
part of a season-long surge from the fifth-year
midfielder.

"Garrett's growing to have a bigger and big
ger impact on the game as the season has pro
gressed," Simon said. "The last three weeks he's
been excellent exactly what you want from a
senior player, taking all the bits and pieces that
you've seen over the years and putting them to
gether. With two goals and an assist [Sunday],
he has certainly been a very good player and
we're excited to have him going full speed."
Things got hairy soon after Gunther's sec
ond tally, however, as Oregon State responded
with two goals of its own in a half-minute span,

the second after Beaver forward Colin Mitchell
took on redshirt sophomore goalie Jason Dod
son for a ball in the air and won the battle, flick
ing it past him into the goal.
The Cardinal locked things down for the rest
of the half, keeping Oregon State's offense at
bay despite not getting too much going in the at
tacking half Stanford was once again out
shot, 13-11. This is the sixth straight game Stan
ford has had fewer shots than its opponent.
Simon swapped out Dodson for sophomore
Drew Hutchins at halftime, and while Hutchins
was forced to make just one save, he was very
active in taking several crosses out of the air in
front of goal.
"We have a lot of confidence in all of our
goalkeepers," Simon said, "but the game was a
grind-it-out type of affair. It was a warm Sunday
afternoon and both teams were really tired, so
we fought to get through it. The game in the sec
ond half wasn't as pretty as we might have liked
it, but it was a good way to get a win."
The defensive intensity was also present dur
ing Friday's loss to Washington (8-3-2,3-2), but
a barrage of shots early on and a nice combina
tion play led to an early 1-0 deficit for the Car
dinal.
While Stanford's offense finally got things
going in the second half the team couldn't cap
italize on several crucial chances and was
caught sending too many men forward when
the Huskies counterattacked in the 71st minute
and Jacob Hustedt made two very nice cuts to
shake defenders before firing past Dodson for
the final 2-0 margin.
After the weekend split, Stanford remains
.500 at home with a 4-4-1 record. But something
about playing on the Farm seems to really get
the Cardinal's blood flowing on offense the
three goals Sunday upped Stanford's home
total to 12 in eight games, while the Cardinal has
yet to score on the road, being outscored 9-0
away from home.
That bodes well for the rematches against
UCLA and SDSU, but the Card will need to
find some way to scratch out a goal or two when
it visits Washington and Oregon State next
weekend, needing two positive results to keep
its postseason aspirations alive.

going in the second half the team couldn't cap

about playing on the Farm seems to really get

find some way to scratch out a goal or two when

Redshirt senior midfielder Garrett Gunther had a
career game against Oregon State. In a 20 minutespan against the Beavers, Gunthertallied
two goals and an assist. Gunther's spree was just
enough for Stanford to notch the 3-2 home win.
Most of the men's soccer team's early strug
gles this season came from a frustrating difficul
ty with finishing scoring opportunities. But for
20 minutes against Oregon State on Sunday, all
those troubles were forgotten as Stanford
seemingly couldn't miss the Cardinal scored
three goals early and held on late for a 3-2 win
as it salvaged a weekend split in conference play
after losing 2-0 to Washington on Friday.

The win over the Beavers (3-8-2,1-3-1 Pac
-12) was Stanford's first in Pac-12 play and
couldn't have come at a better time for the Car
dinal (4-7-2,1-3-1), which must find its top gear
in a hurry if it hopes to sneak into the NCAA
Tournament in November. It certainly will have
the opportunity to play its way in, with home
games against the top two teams in the confer
ence, No. 9 UCLA and No. 24 San Diego State,
looming in two weeks.
But the story Sunday was redshirt senior
midfielder Garrett Gunther, who broke
through with the first multi-goal game of his ca
reer. The Long Beach native opened the scoring
in the 10th minute when sophomore midfielder
J.J. Koval played a deep ball into a very danger
ous area at the top of the goal box. Oregon State
goalie Steve Spangler charged off his line and
attempted to clear the ball away, but Gunther
got to it first and flicked the ball over Spangler
into the empty net.
After going four games with just one goal, it
was a welcome sight for the Cardinal to be cele
brating on the field. Just a minute later, Stanford
struck again. Senior defender Adoni Levine
threw the ball in to Gunther, who immediately
played the ball across the field towards goal,
where senior Alexander Binnie was ready and
waiting to head the ball into the back of the net
for his second goal of the season and his career.
A few minutes later, Gunther got on the
board again with a one-touch finish past Span
gler, sending the crowd of 719 to its feet in ap
preciation. Head coach Bret Simon lauded

Gunther's effort not just this weekend, but as
part of a season-long surge from the fifth-year
midfielder.

"Garrett's growing to have a bigger and big
ger impact on the game as the season has pro
gressed," Simon said. "The last three weeks he's
been excellent exactly what you want from a
senior player, taking all the bits and pieces that
you've seen over the years and putting them to
gether. With two goals and an assist [Sunday],
he has certainly been a very good player and
we're excited to have him going full speed."
Things got hairy soon after Gunther's sec
ond tally, however, as Oregon State responded
with two goals of its own in a half-minute span,

the second after Beaver forward Colin Mitchell
took on redshirt sophomore goalie Jason Dod
son for a ball in the air and won the battle, flick
ing it past him into the goal.
The Cardinal locked things down for the rest
of the half, keeping Oregon State's offense at
bay despite not getting too much going in the at
tacking half Stanford was once again out
shot, 13-11. This is the sixth straight game Stan
ford has had fewer shots than its opponent.
Simon swapped out Dodson for sophomore
Drew Hutchins at halftime, and while Hutchins
was forced to make just one save, he was very
active in taking several crosses out of the air in
front of goal.
"We have a lot of confidence in all of our
goalkeepers," Simon said, "but the game was a
grind-it-out type of affair. It was a warm Sunday
afternoon and both teams were really tired, so
we fought to get through it. The game in the sec
ond half wasn't as pretty as we might have liked
it, but it was a good way to get a win."
The defensive intensity was also present dur
ing Friday's loss to Washington (8-3-2,3-2), but
a barrage of shots early on and a nice combina
tion play led to an early 1-0 deficit for the Car
dinal.
While Stanford's offense finally got things
going in the second half the team couldn't cap
italize on several crucial chances and was
caught sending too many men forward when
the Huskies counterattacked in the 71st minute
and Jacob Hustedt made two very nice cuts to
shake defenders before firing past Dodson for
the final 2-0 margin.
