# TOP-RANKED CARD FALLS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ 
The Stanford men's water polo
team recently ascended to No. 1 in
the Collegiate Water Polo Associa
tion rankings thanks to two wins
over top-five teams at the SoCal
Tournament. But that ranking will
likely take a hit, as the Cardinal
dropped a tight 7-6 decision to No.
3 UCLA on Saturday.

The flow of the game was very
similar to the Cardinal's last game
on Oct. 9, when it beat UC-Santa
Barbara 6-5. In both meetings
Stanford trailed 4-2 at the half and
continually found itself conceding

goals immediately after equalizing
the score.
But in that thriller, senior driver
Jacob Smith came up with a huge
goal to win the game in the final
seconds. Last weekend's game had
no such heroics. Instead, Stanford
(9-3, 2-1 MPSF) turned the ball
over with less than 30 seconds re
maining in the contest, giving up a
chance to equalize and possibly
force overtime.
The loss ended Stanford's six
game winning streak and was also
the team's first loss in conference
play, dropping the Cardinal into a
three-way tie for second place at 2-
1.
All of Stanford's goals came
from the top three scorers on the
team freshman utility Alex

Junior Andrew LaForge and the No. 1 Stanford water polo team were riding
high after winning the SoCal Tournament. This was short-lived, though, as the
Cardinal fell to No. 3 UCLA in a 7-6 squeaker at Avery Aquatic Center.
Bowen had three, Smith had two and
redshirt sophomore two-meter For
rest Watkins had one.
The inability to get a balanced of
fensive attack and get goals from
other players was one reason the
Cardinal couldn't come up with an
other close win, something Stanford
needs to do as it matches up with
such tough competition in confer
ence play four of Stanford's past
six games have been decided by one
goal, and all six were against teams
ranked No. 8 or higher.
"We expect [close games] be
cause the top eight teams are all so

good and so close," said redshirt jun
ior driver Alex Avery.
Nine of the Cardinal's 12 games
have been against teams currently
ranked in the top eight nationally.
The remainder of the season will
only get tougher, though, as all eight
of those teams play in the MPSF.
Although Bowen, Smith and
Watkins have clearly been the
bedrocks of the attack all season,
having other players get on the board
helps open up opportunities for
Stanford's big outside shooters. And
the Card has seen several young
players step up in key spots already
this season.
"Everyone has a role on the
team," Avery said. "It would be nice
if other players could get some in, but
[Bowen, Smith and Watkins] are out
there to score goals."

Smith tallied the opening goal of
the day, but it went downhill from
there as UCLA scored four of the
next five to pull ahead. Some excep
tional team defense from the Bruins
kept Stanford's offense at bay for
most of the first half.
Two lob shot goals that floated
over senior goalie Brian Pingree,
who finished with seven saves, were
the difference going into the half. His
counterpart, Matt Rapacz, ended the
day with only five saves, but most of
that was due to UCLA's outside de
fenders blocking shots before they
could reach the cage.
Stanford mounted a comeback
behind a strong third quarter in
which the Cardinal outscored the
Bruins 3-I.The Cardinal could never
get a lead, though, and continued to
trade goals throughout the half.

A UCLA ejection with under a
minute to play gave Stanford a
chance, but unlike last weekend, the
Cardinal was unable to take advan
tage of a late power play.
Avery acknowledged that this
may not have been the team's best
showing, but he welcomes an oppor
tunity to play the Bruins again.
"We will definitely be ready when
it comes to the playoffs," he said.
Following the loss, Stanford now
goes into one of its more grueling
weekends of the season. The Cardi
nal travels to Stockton to face No. 6
Pacific on Friday night before taking
on four East Coast schools over two
days at the Rodeo Tournament in
Santa Clara, Calif.
