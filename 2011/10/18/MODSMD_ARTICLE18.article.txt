# TOP-RANKED CARD FALLS
## 
### DAVID PEREZ 
The Stanford men's water polo
team recently ascended to No. 1 in
the Collegiate Water Polo Associa
tion rankings thanks to two wins
over top-five teams at the SoCal
Tournament. But that ranking will
likely take a hit, as the Cardinal
dropped a tight 7-6 decision to No.
3 UCLA on Saturday.

The flow of the game was very
similar to the Cardinal's last game
on Oct. 9, when it beat UC-Santa
Barbara 6-5. In both meetings
Stanford trailed 4-2 at the half and
continually found itself conceding

goals immediately after equalizing
the score.
But in that thriller, senior driver
Jacob Smith came up with a huge
goal to win the game in the final
seconds. Last weekend's game had
no such heroics. Instead, Stanford
(9-3, 2-1 MPSF) turned the ball
over with less than 30 seconds re
maining in the contest, giving up a
chance to equalize and possibly
force overtime.
The loss ended Stanford's six
game winning streak and was also
the team's first loss in conference
play, dropping the Cardinal into a
three-way tie for second place at 2-
1.
All of Stanford's goals came
from the top three scorers on the
team freshman utility Alex

high after winning the SoCal Tournament. This was short-lived, though, as the
Cardinal fell to No. 3 UCLA in a 7-6 squeaker at Avery Aquatic Center.
