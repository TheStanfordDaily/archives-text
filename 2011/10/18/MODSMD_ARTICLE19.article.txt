# SPORT BRIEFS
## Card nets Player of the Week honors in football, volleyball, field hockey 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
No Stanford sport had a game on
Monday, but that didn't stop the
Cardinal from having a busy day.
Andrew Luck, Karissa Cook, Ale
Moss and Alex McCawley all
earned recognition from their con
ferences for their work this past
week.
Luck, the star redshirt junior
quarterback for the No. 7 Stanford
football team, was named the Pac
-12 Offensive Player of the Week for
his performance against Washing
ton State on Saturday, despite get
ting off to a rough start. His first
throw was intercepted, and he had
just 89 yards and no touchdowns in
the first half. However, Luck turned
things around in a big way, throwing
four touchdowns in the second half
and finishing with 336 yards to lead
the Cardinal to a 44-14 win. Even
though Stanford is the only unde
feated team remaining in the Pac
-12, this is the first Player of the
Week honor for the Cardinal this
year.

Cook, the setter for the No. 5

Stanford women's volleyball team,
was named the Pac-12 Offensive
Player of the Week as well after
leading the Cardinal to a pair of
sweeps. The junior racked up 36 as-

sists, six digs and a kill against Wash
ington State on Friday, but her most
important work took place on Sat
urday. Facing then-No. 2 Washing
ton in Maples Pavilion, Cook set a
career best with a .556 hitting per
centage to go with 30 assists, 13 digs
and four blocks. Her 11th double
double of the season, tied for the
most in the Pac-12, helped the Car
dinal to a surprisingly dominant
sweep of the Huskies.
Moss and McCawley were both
instrumental in the No. 9 Stanford
field hockey team's rout of Pacific
and nail-biting road win over No. 12
California. Moss, a redshirt senior,
was a force in goal for the Cardinal,
allowing just two goals in two games
to earn NorPac Defensive Player of
the Week honors. McCawley, a
freshman attacker, earned her third
NorPac Rookie of the Week honor
in the past four weeks thanks to a
pair of assists over the weekend, in
cluding the game-winner against
Cal. Moss and McCawley helped
Stanford clinch the NorPac West
Division title with the team's victo
ry over the Golden Bears.
