## ASSU Exec announces 25 percent "Checklist 2.0" claims 25 percent of platform completed 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
The ASSU Executive recently announced
it has completed over 25 percent of its plat
form. The announcement came in a campus
wide email ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
sent on behalf of the Executive on Monday,
Oct. 10.
"We are being accountable to the promises
we made," Cruz said about the email, referenc
ing the Executive's goal to "engage the com
munity and measure results," as described on
the Stanford 2.0 website.
The percentage was calculated using the
platform points upon which Cruz and ASSU
Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
based their campaign last spring. "Checklist
2.0," a public Google Doc used by the Execu
tive Team, outlines the Executive's platform
and action steps in promoting overarching
themes such as diversity and sexual health.
Thirty-five of the 113 platform points were
listed as completed on the spreadsheet.
Completed changes counting toward the
25-percent mark, and directly mentioned in
the campus-wide email, included continued
access to Â©Stanford.edu email addresses for
recent alumni, the promotion of non-fried op
tions at Late Nite and the creation of an arts
presence online.
Cruz said the arts-dedicated website is still
under construction.
