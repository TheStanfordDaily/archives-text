## ASSU Exec announces 25 percent "Checklist 2.0" claims 25 percent of platform completed 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
The ASSU Executive recently announced
it has completed over 25 percent of its plat
form. The announcement came in a campus
wide email ASSU President Michael Cruz 'l2
sent on behalf of the Executive on Monday,
Oct. 10.
"We are being accountable to the promises
we made," Cruz said about the email, referenc
ing the Executive's goal to "engage the com
munity and measure results," as described on
the Stanford 2.0 website.
The percentage was calculated using the
platform points upon which Cruz and ASSU
Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
based their campaign last spring. "Checklist
2.0," a public Google Doc used by the Execu
tive Team, outlines the Executive's platform
and action steps in promoting overarching
themes such as diversity and sexual health.
Thirty-five of the 113 platform points were
listed as completed on the spreadsheet.
Completed changes counting toward the
25-percent mark, and directly mentioned in
the campus-wide email, included continued
access to ©Stanford.edu email addresses for
recent alumni, the promotion of non-fried op
tions at Late Nite and the creation of an arts
presence online.
Cruz said the arts-dedicated website is still
under construction.
Holly Harrison Cohen 'B6 of the Interac
tive Services Department of the Alumni Asso-
ciation spoke positively of the Ex
ecutive.
"There has been general stu
dent interest in maintaining the
@stanford.edu email address for
some period of time and this
change allows for a longer transi
tion," she wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Our customer support
team has received positive feed
back."
As for non-fried options at Late
Nite, the Executive listed meeting
with the campus nutritionist and
dining hall chefs as completed ac
tion steps.
Of the 113 items on the plat
form, one, a plan to create a "Di
versity Peer Educator" position,
was listed as "discontinued."
The Executive had hoped to
create the dorm position of a di
versity peer educator, but discon
tinued the effort after noting on its
spreadsheet, that Residential Edu
cation was "not keen on the idea of
a diversity peer educator."
"I would consider us making
good progress," Cruz said. "A lot of
our projects are now in the imple
mentation stages. We're working
on outreach. We're working on a
variety of initiatives, ones that
were on our platform in addition
to new ones that we've worked
with our team and with the com
munity to really form."
Some students expressed con
cern that the completed platform
points represent the completion of
exploratory meetings and re
search, with no guarantee of tangi
ble changes.
"Makfing] the meal plan op
tional for all students" was listed as
"completed" despite the Execu
tive reporting in its notes, "After
exploring possibilities, optional
meal plans are not financially vi
able."

The Executive platform is sepa
rated into different categories of
campus life, such as "Arts," "Ca
reer," "Dining," "Green" and
"Queer."

Of the "Serve Stanford 2.0"
plans aimed at promoting commu
nity service on campus, none have
been marked as "completed" or
"in progress," while every action
plan for "Dining Stanford 2.0" has
seen progress, according to the
spreadsheet.
According to Cruz, this appar

ent imbalance does not necessarily
indicate where the Executive's
focus lies.
"Our Chair of Public Service . .
. has been hard at work," Cruz
said, adding that some tasks might
take more time to complete.
One change, initiating first-gen
eration, low-income events at New
Student Orientation, resonated
well with students.
"I think that the discussions
during the program were pretty
meaningful," said Chi Ling Chan
'l5. "It prompted me to think
about first-generation students
from a new perspective, in a new
light... It never occurred to me
that first-gen can also be an identi
ty that you carry along with you."
"As the year goes on, there are
new initiatives that will be brought
up," Cruz said. "There are projects,
initiatives, issues that are brought
to our attention. We want to try to
integrate that into our goals."
"I was surprised because it has
only been a couple of weeks," Ta
tiana Kuzovleva 'l5 said of the Ex
ecutive's progress. "I thought it
was just a nice way to keep on
track of what they were doing, that
they weren't just sitting there, eat
ing up money, but that they were
actually doing something."
Other "in progress" initiatives,
according to the Checklist 2.0, in
clude creating an online menu
where students can "like" meals,
subsidizing Caltrain tickets for stu
dents and encouraging large stu
dent groups to train 'sexual vio
lence monitors' to make campus
parties more safe.

tions at Late Nite and the creation of an arts
presence online.
Cruz said the arts-dedicated website is still
under construction.
Holly Harrison Cohen 'B6 of the Interac
tive Services Department of the Alumni Asso-
ciation spoke positively of the Ex
ecutive.
"There has been general stu
dent interest in maintaining the
@stanford.edu email address for
some period of time and this
change allows for a longer transi
tion," she wrote in an email to The
Daily. "Our customer support
team has received positive feed
back."
As for non-fried options at Late
Nite, the Executive listed meeting
with the campus nutritionist and
dining hall chefs as completed ac
tion steps.
Of the 113 items on the plat
form, one, a plan to create a "Di
versity Peer Educator" position,
was listed as "discontinued."
The Executive had hoped to
create the dorm position of a di
versity peer educator, but discon
tinued the effort after noting on its
spreadsheet, that Residential Edu
cation was "not keen on the idea of
a diversity peer educator."
"I would consider us making
good progress," Cruz said. "A lot of
our projects are now in the imple
mentation stages. We're working
on outreach. We're working on a
variety of initiatives, ones that
were on our platform in addition
to new ones that we've worked
with our team and with the com
munity to really form."
Some students expressed con
cern that the completed platform
points represent the completion of
exploratory meetings and re
search, with no guarantee of tangi
ble changes.
"Makfing] the meal plan op
tional for all students" was listed as
"completed" despite the Execu
tive reporting in its notes, "After
exploring possibilities, optional
meal plans are not financially vi
able."

The Executive platform is sepa
rated into different categories of
campus life, such as "Arts," "Ca
reer," "Dining," "Green" and
"Queer."

Of the "Serve Stanford 2.0"
plans aimed at promoting commu
nity service on campus, none have
been marked as "completed" or
"in progress," while every action
plan for "Dining Stanford 2.0" has
seen progress, according to the
spreadsheet.
According to Cruz, this appar

ent imbalance does not necessarily
indicate where the Executive's
focus lies.
"Our Chair of Public Service . .
. has been hard at work," Cruz
said, adding that some tasks might
take more time to complete.
One change, initiating first-gen
eration, low-income events at New
Student Orientation, resonated
well with students.
"I think that the discussions
during the program were pretty
meaningful," said Chi Ling Chan
'l5. "It prompted me to think
about first-generation students
from a new perspective, in a new
light... It never occurred to me
that first-gen can also be an identi
ty that you carry along with you."
"As the year goes on, there are
new initiatives that will be brought
up," Cruz said. "There are projects,
initiatives, issues that are brought
to our attention. We want to try to
integrate that into our goals."
"I was surprised because it has
only been a couple of weeks," Ta
tiana Kuzovleva 'l5 said of the Ex
ecutive's progress. "I thought it
was just a nice way to keep on
track of what they were doing, that
they weren't just sitting there, eat
ing up money, but that they were
actually doing something."
Other "in progress" initiatives,
according to the Checklist 2.0, in
clude creating an online menu
where students can "like" meals,
subsidizing Caltrain tickets for stu
dents and encouraging large stu
dent groups to train 'sexual vio
lence monitors' to make campus
parties more safe.
