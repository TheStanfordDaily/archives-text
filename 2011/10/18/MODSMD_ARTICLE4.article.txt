## Panda Express meets mixed response to Tresidder location 
### SHELLEY XU 
Panda Express joined Tresidder Union's
cast of lunch and dinner venues this past
summer, replacing Chopstix, another Amer
ican Chinese eatery.
Almost halfway into fall quarter, commu
nity response to the new dining option is
mixed, in contrast to the negative response
the chain received when it proposed to open
a location on the UC- Berkeley campus in
2009.
When Panda Express announced that it
would be opening a Berkeley campus loca
tion two years ago, a group of Berkeley stu
dents protested.
So far, the Stanford response to the new
dining option in Tresidder has been fairly
positive, including long lines during the first
weeks of the quarter.
Some said they appreciated the change.

Mark Sherwood 'l4 said, "I think it is better
American Chinese food than the old Amer
ican Chinese food that was here."

Other students remarked on what they
felt were the restaurant's unsustainable
practices, though none mentioned any meas
ures similar to those in Berkeley.
Yonatan Landau, one of the leaders of
the protest, said that when students investi
gated Panda Express, they "found that en
trees were 60 percent fat calories."
Landau, who donned a rented panda suit
as part of the protests, also cited other prob
lems he saw with the restaurant, such as a
lack of vegetarian options and "no mention
of any sustainability practices or labor prac
tices."
The group collected more than 1,300 sig
natures on their petition to prevent the
