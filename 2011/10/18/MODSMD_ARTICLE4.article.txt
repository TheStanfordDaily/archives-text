## Panda Express meets mixed response to Tresidder location 
### SHELLEY XU 
Panda Express joined Tresidder Union's
cast of lunch and dinner venues this past
summer, replacing Chopstix, another Amer
ican Chinese eatery.
Almost halfway into fall quarter, commu
nity response to the new dining option is
mixed, in contrast to the negative response
the chain received when it proposed to open
a location on the UC- Berkeley campus in
2009.
When Panda Express announced that it
would be opening a Berkeley campus loca
tion two years ago, a group of Berkeley stu
dents protested.
So far, the Stanford response to the new
dining option in Tresidder has been fairly
positive, including long lines during the first
weeks of the quarter.
Some said they appreciated the change.

Mark Sherwood 'l4 said, "I think it is better
American Chinese food than the old Amer
ican Chinese food that was here."

Other students remarked on what they
felt were the restaurant's unsustainable
practices, though none mentioned any meas
ures similar to those in Berkeley.
Yonatan Landau, one of the leaders of
the protest, said that when students investi
gated Panda Express, they "found that en
trees were 60 percent fat calories."
Landau, who donned a rented panda suit
as part of the protests, also cited other prob
lems he saw with the restaurant, such as a
lack of vegetarian options and "no mention
of any sustainability practices or labor prac
tices."
The group collected more than 1,300 sig
natures on their petition to prevent the

restaurant from opening a campus
location.
Christina Oatfield, another stu
dent who led protests in Berkeley,
said, "If you look at USDA recom
mended daily food guidelines,
Panda Express doesn't follow any."
In response to the protest,
Panda Express offered to begin
composting in their kitchens and
use vegetable oil instead of frying
their vegetables in oil from meat.
However, the chain ultimately did
not open a location on the UC-
Berkeley campus.
Students for a Sustainable Stan
ford (SSS) Co-President Anna
Doty 'l2 said there are several
problems with Panda Express,
which she said she believes does not
compost and uses single-use plastic
utensils and containers.
"I think our position about
Panda Express can extend to a lot
of food distributors on campus,"
she said.
"I think it's pushing us back in
stead of pushing us forward," Doty
added. She said that she feels the
restaurant's presence highlights the
lack of a comprehensive campus
wide policy on waste.
"We had zero-waste lunch dur
ing [New Student Orientation], We
know it can be done," said Alex
Luisi 'l2, fellow co-president of
SSS. "There's a whole slew of pack
aging you can use that's sturdy
enough."
Panda Express training leader
Avel Fore said that students are
happy with Panda Express thus far.
"Our secret is fantastic food,
fantastic service, fantastic ambi
ence," Fore said.
At Berkeley, students opted to

create a student-run co-op as an al
ternative to the chain.The Berkeley
Student Food Cooperative
(BSFC), which received over
$lOO,OOO in start-up grants, is now
breaking even in sales, according to
Landau.
The Berkeley students who
protested Panda Express hoped to
address what they saw as health
concerns with the restaurant's of
ferings, Oatfield said.
For now, some Stanford students
agree.
"When given the option, stu
dents tend to make the healthier
choice. With Panda Express, that's
not an option," Doty said.
"I think that the culture ... is
different," Doty added, referring to
the relative lack of controversy
among students over the chain's
presence at Stanford.
