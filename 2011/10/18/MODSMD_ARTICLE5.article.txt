## EE prof, laser scientist Siegman dies 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
Professor emeritus of electrical
engineering and author of the classic
reference text on laser science An
thony Siegman died Oct. 7 at his Stan
ford home. He was 79.
Siegman is the inventor of the un
stable resistor a device that makes
high-power lasers and beam quality
possible and is widely-recognized
for contributions to "laser mode
locking," a laser technique for meas
urement. His 1986 book "Lasers" is
considered a definitive work on laser
science.
Professor emeritus of electrical
engineering Stephen Harris, who was
one of Siegman's first students, called
his death "heartbreaking."
"Tony Siegman is so well liked
so universally liked and respected,"
he told the Stanford Report.
"He is a model scientist," Harris
continued. "You would look far and
wide to find a laser engineer or scien
tist who doesn't have Tony's book
'Lasers' on his desk. He had a unique
ability to blend mathematics and
physical insight."
Born Sept. 23,1931 and raised in
rural Michigan, Siegman earned his
undergraduate degree summa cum
laude from Harvard in 1952. He then
pursued a master's degree in applied
physics from UCLA in 1954 before
following his supervisor from Hughes
Research Labs in Culver City to Stan
ford. He received his faculty appoint
ment in 1956 and his doctorate in elec
trical engineering from Stanford in
1957.
He began researching microwave
electronics and eventually lasers and
optics.
"At that time, microwave electron
ics was one of Stanford's particular
strengths and an intellectually excit
ing field," Siegman once said. "For me,
it soon led to a natural evolution into
the emerging areas of lasers and opti
cal electronics."
Following his appointment to full
professorship in 1964, Siegman re
ceived several awards throughout his
career. He spent time as a visiting pro
fessor at Harvard and was a Guggen
heim Fellow at the IBM Research
Labs. He retired officially in 1998 but
continued to lecture and publish.
"He was remarkable in his teach
ing, in his work with students and the
research that he did," said Robert
Byer, professor of applied physics, in
a statement to the Report. "He was
the cardinal of the laser community
at Stanford."
