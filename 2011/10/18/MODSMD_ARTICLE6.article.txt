# Talks with Blue Cross continue
## Hospital faces expired healthcare contract 
### ROBIN CHIN 
Patients and healthcare providers are lingering in a
state of uncertainty as negotiations between Stanford
Hospital & Clinics and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue
Shield continue.
The contract between Stanford and Anthem Blue
Cross expired Aug. 31, which leaves Stanford Hospital,
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) and Stan
ford Medical Group no longer authorized for coverage in
the Anthem Blue Cross network. The contract between
LPCH and Blue Shield also expired last August.
Stanford officially became what is known as a "non
contract" provider with Anthem Blue Cross, according to
a statement made by Stanford Hospital & Clinics on the
front page of its website, meaning that Anthem Blue
Cross will no longer cover medical expenses for patients
receiving services at Stanford Hospitals.
As negotiations continue, patients have been left
wondering how their services will be covered.
Gary Migdol, director of communications for Stan
ford Hospital & Clinics said, "We recognize that there is
confusion surrounding this issue and are taking steps nec
essary to ensure that our patients understand their finan
cial responsibility."
Ordinarily, if a patient visits a non-contract healthcare
provider, he or she might have to foot the entirety of the
medical bill. However, Stanford has promised to cover
the costs normally paid by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue
Shield for at least part of the negotiation process.
This leaves patients responsible only for the fees and
co-payments they would normally pay if Stanford were
still covered by Anthem Blue Cross or Blue Shield.
"Our message to our patients is this: the Hospitals will
honor your in-network rates so that your out-of-pocket
costs are no higher than they normally would be," Migdol
said.
Migdol emphasized that all patients, regardless of
plan type, can still be seen at Stanford or LPCH. This ex
tends to both health maintenance organization (HMO)
and preferred provider organization (PPO) plans.
This policy may have significant financial ramifica
tions for Stanford Hospital & Clinics as it pays mounting
bills.
However, Migdol said, "Our primary concern is with
our patients and providing them with the care and access
they expect."
Stanford has taken these extra steps to ensure that pa-

tient care has not been compromised
by the contract expiration, according
to Migdol. But uncertainty still sur
rounds the state of negotiations.
Migdol states that contract negoti
ations between Stanford Hospital &
Clinics and Anthem Blue Cross are
ongoing, while LPCH continues to
negotiate with both Anthem Blue
Cross and Blue Shield.
"The main negotiating point is re
imbursement rates," he said.

Anthem Blue Cross Public Rela
tions Director Darrel Ng said, "Med
ical costs are our main priority. Our
goal is to minimize those increases."
Ng said his company avoids rais

ing rates for customers by negotiating
contracts with healthcare providers
such as Stanford.

"Stanford had been asking for a
double-digit increase when it's al
ready far above the average cost for
Santa Clara County," Ng said.Though
he could not predict when a settle
ment might occur, he is "hopeful that
there will be an agreement soon."
Meanwhile LPCH and Blue
Shield are struggling to find consen
sus over reimbursement rates.
Angenette Lau, communications
specialist for Blue Shield, states that
LPCH requested coverage for a new,
undefined entity, the specifics of
which were not disclosed to The
Daily. Blue Shield has not agreed to
cover any undefined services by un
determined providers.
Lau compared this to signing a
blank check.

"Lucile Packard's last-minute de
mands would have limited our ability
to control quality and costs for our
members," she said.
In the meantime. Blue Shield tun
neled some clients to alternative
health providers in Santa Clara and
San Mateo counties. Despite Stan
ford and LPCH's commitment to
honor in-network rates, Lau warned
that patients at LPCH "may have
personal liability for out-of-network
services."
Neither Stanford nor the insur
ance providers could predict how
long it will take to reach agreement.
While negotiations continue, patients
will work with their insurance
providers and Stanford to make sure
they receive coverage, Migdol said.
