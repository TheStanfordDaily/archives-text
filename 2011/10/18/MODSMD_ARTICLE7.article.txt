## FSE becomes full-scale research center Center on Food Security and the Environment expands 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
The Freeman Spogli Institute for Interna
tional Studies (FSI) announced that it plans
to celebrate the launch of the Center on Food
Security and the Environment (FSE) at its
fall conference on Nov. 10.
FSI expanded this fall from a program to a
full-scale research center. FSE was estab
lished in 2006 and was previously a joint pro
gram of the FSI and the Woods Institute for
the Environment.

FSE Director Rosamond Naylor Ph.D.
'B9, professor in environmental earth system
science, will continue in her post.
The Center for Food Security and the En
vironment works to bring issues of hunger,
poverty and the environment into a global
setting. The University selected FSE, which
conducts research on aquaculture, biofuels
and the evolving U.S. energy policies, among
other topics, to expand its impact on and off
campus.
"It's this set of efforts in terms of publica
tions, policy advice [and] outreach that catch
es people's attention," said Walter "Wally"
Falcon, deputy director of FSE. "We think it's
the main reason why we are able to
go from one level in the hierarchy
to one higher level."
Falcon was the former director
of FSI and is an emeritus professor
in international agricultural policy.
The Center on Food Security
and the Environment offers classes
on world food economy, China's
economic development and society,
sustainable agriculture and global
change. With the transition from a
program to a research center this
year, both academic offerings and
the research opportunities will in

crease, Falcon said.
"We're going to be a larger,
more self-sustaining operation that
has a longer outlook on life," he
added. "We will have some more
faculty involved with us."
FSE recently evaluated its fund
ing, personnel and scholarly growth
and determined that the transition
to a full-fledged research hub
would allow the center to be en
dowed and recruit new faculty. The
center hopes to increase its core
team of affiliated researchers at
Stanford and collaborators outside
of the University in the near future.
The Center on Food Security
and the Environment is linked to
both FSI and the Woods Institute.
By spanning multiple departments,
the program has been able to apply

for and receive grants from each in
stitute.
"Funding comes from Stanford,
from endowments that underwrite
some of our faculty, from gifts and
from competitive grants," Falcon
said.
Government grants from organ
izations such as the National Sci
ence Foundation and the Depart
ment of Energy also subsidize
FSE's activities.
In 2007, the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation donated $3.8
million to the program.
Food research has long been a

major interest at the University.The
now-defunct Food Research Insti
tute (FRI) was first established in
1921 by an agreement between the
Carnegie Corporation of New York
and Stanford University, with
strong support from then-Secretary
of Commerce and alumnus Herbert
Hoover '95. Though FRI closed its
doors in 1996 including Naylor,
who received her Ph.D. there in
1989, and Falcon, who served as its
director from 1972 until 1991

several alumni of the program went
on to serve at FSI.
Researchers are also conscious

of the successful work they have
completed since the program's in
ception and use these trends to in
form their current developments.
"One can hardly pick up the
paper and not be concerned about a
whole series of issues on food," Fal
con said. "I think over the past
decade we've done some really cre
ative work in this field. The Univer
sity recognized that food as an ap
plied topic is very visible and, I
think, very huge at the time."
