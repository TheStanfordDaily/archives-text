# Med school identifies formula for success of cancer treatment
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
Researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine developed a
mathematical formula for correlat
ing the response rate of human lung
tumors to certain treatments during
the sustained regression of certain
cancers.
The development builds on the
scientific insight that successful
treatments do not necessarily imme
diately kill cancer-causing genes but
rather slow rampant cell growth to
shrink tumors.
Associate professor of oncology
and senior author Dean Felsher led
the team.
"It's really just advanced high
school-level math," Felsher said in
the Medical School press release.
"With some simple measurements,
we found we can determine when a
cancer is addicted to a particular
cancer gene and will respond to
therapy targeting that gene. I was as
tounded that it works."
Felsher's co-senior author was
assistant professor of radiology
David Paik.
The study applied a computation
biology approach to a phenomenon
known as "oncogene addiction," de
fined as a cancer dependent on one
cancer-causing gene. While most tu
mors build on the interaction of
many cell mutations, some are re
liant on a single mutated protein
known as oncogene, and therefore
regress quickly when that protein's
activity is manipulated.
Felsher and Paik induced tumors
in animals and then blocked onco
gene activity and monitored tumor
regression. By precisely measuring

death and survival signals, as well as
activity levels of certain genes, they
were able to mathematically map
the effects of the treatment.
"Lots of people will respond to
therapy at first, but many times they
don't get better," Felsher said. "With
anew therapy, would you rather wait
four months and say, 'Well, it's kind
of working,' or is it better to know
after a couple of weeks? We've
found that the kinetics of regression
can quickly predict whether the
tumor is oncogene-addicted and
likely to be treated successfully by
targeted therapies."
Researchers developed a differen
tial equation relating the treatment's
progress and cell death. Their model
successfully predicted which of 43 pa
tients enrolled in a clinical trial had
oncogene-addicted tumors. Though
the predictions were retrospective
and therefore did not influence actual
treatment, the research has potential
to identify the success of certain ther
apies and make recommendations for
future patients as to whether their
treatment is working.
"Our results may have provoca
tive implications," Felsher said.
"We've learned that a key point that
many people don't realize is that it
matters a lot how quickly the tumor is
getting smaller. There's a certain rate
of regression where you're never
going to get rid of your cancer com
pletely, but at another rate, you will.
For oncogene-addicted tumors, it's a
very predictable kinetic response."
