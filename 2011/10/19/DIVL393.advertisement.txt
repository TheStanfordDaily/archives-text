An Interdisciplinary Tour of the Human Condition
in Three Stages: Time, Life, and Mind
â™¦
Over the years, artists, scientists, engineers, and humanities
scholars have explored the grand themes that define the
human condition from radically different perspectives. Too
infrequently, they are given the opportunity to listen to each
other and engage in conversations that cross boundaries and
mix up categories.
In each of the three quarters of this academic year, we will
host an evening program featuring some of the most exciting
thinkers in the Bay Area, inviting them to talk together about
one or another modest slice of the human experience. We will
start in the Fall with "Time," with panel speakers Leonard
Susskind, Gail Wight, Pamela Z, Jan English-Lueck, and Piero
Scaruffi (moderator).
Thursday, October 20
7:00 pm
Cubberley Auditorium, School of Education
FREE, open to public
Please plan to come early and enjoy the art exhibits.
