### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Gary Glazer, professor of diag
nostic radiology, died on Oct. 16
after a long battle with prostate can
cer, according to a statement on the
School of Medicine's website. He
was 61.
Glazer had been the chair of the
School of Medicine 's Department of
Radiology for more than 20 years
before stepping down last August.
He joined Stanford's faculty in 1989
to head up the newly formed depart
ment, which had been separated
from the Department of Radiology
Oncology three years earlier.
His leadership resulted in the de
partment becoming "one of the
most innovative and influential sci

entific-imaging centers in the Unit
ed States and in the world," accord
ing to Hedvig Hricak, former presi
dent of the Radiological Society of
North America (RSNA), in a 2009
University statement when Glazer
was a recipient of the organization's
Gold Medal. RSNA gives the award
annually to no more than three indi
viduals who have strongly con
tributed to the field of radiology.

Glazer also won the Gold Medal
from the Association of University
Radiologists in 2011, making him
one of only 21 radiologists ever to
achieve both distinctions.

During his term as chair, Glazer
oversaw many of the Department of
Radiology's expansions, such as the
completion of the Richard M. Lucas
Center for Magnetic Resonance
Spectroscopy and Imaging in 1992
and the expansion of the Lucas Cen
ter in 2005. He also saw the depart
ment's faculty grow from 20 mem
bers when he arrived in 1989 to more
than 400 in 2009.

He pushed the department to
take a more patient-centered ap
proach to radiology, according to the
University statement. This goal
manifested itself physically when he
helped to supervise the design of the
Stanford Medicine Imaging Center,
which opened in Palo Alto in 2008
and was designed to help facilitate
radiologist-patient interactions.

Glazer was born in 1950 in Cleve
land, where his father was also a ra
diologist and his mother was a nurse.
He attributed his parents' professors
to part of the reason why he decided
to pursue a career in health care in
the 2009 statement.

He earned his bachelor's degree
at the University of Michigan and
medical degree at Case Western Re
serve University. He was a faculty
member at University of California-
San Francisco and the University of
Michigan before coming to Stan
ford.
"Gary worked relentlessly to
build a great department by lobby
ing for significant resources from the
hospitals, the medical school and
from industry," said Sanjiv Gambhir,
the current chair of Department of
Radiology, in the University state
ment. "He was known for his great
passion for the field, extremely
strong negotiation skills and for
rarely giving up on any issue he
championed. He would never take
no for an answer."
A funeral service was held in
honor of Glazer on Tuesday.
