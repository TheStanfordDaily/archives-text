## PROFILE It Gets Better Stanford faculty and staff contribute their stories to LGBT support project 
### LESLIENGUYEN-OKWU 
mid Stanford's sunny
and scenic campus,
Arnold Zwicky, a
consulting professor
of linguistics, poured
his heart into a camera.
"One of my youngest childhood friends was a
wonderful, sweet kid," Zwicky said in a segment that
is featured in Stanford's contribution to the It Gets

Better project. "A classic, sissy boy... was rejected
by his father in the worst possible way. His life went
downhill and he killed himself in high school."
After seven youth who had been bullied for iden
tifying as LGBT committed suicide last October,
Dan Savage and his partner, founders of the It Gets
Better project, spurred worldwide attention by post
ing a video on You Tube. Speaking candidly into a
camera, they encouraged young adults to "stick out
the bullying, the pain and the despair of high school"
because "living life was the best revenge."
With You Tube as its medium, the It Gets Better
project aims to reach suffering LGBT youth and re
mind them that they are not alone in their struggles.
With more than 40 million views from around the
world, the project has worked to drive home its

message with entries from the likes
of President Barack Obama, a Ma
rine sergeant, an openly gay Unitari
an minister and even Jersey Shore's
Vinny Guadagnino.
Last year, LGBT staff and faculty
at Stanford were inspired by the
25,000 user-created videos and soon
decided to contribute their own per
sonal struggles and triumphs to the It
Gets Better project. After receiving
support from the University and the
Queer University Employees at
Stanford (QUEST) organization,
Noah Abrahamson, a system admin
istrator in information technology
services, quickly became the vision
behind the videos.

"After watching Google's It Gets
Better video, I identified with these
LGBT technology workers and
wanted to put something together
from Stanford," Abrahamson said. "I
wanted to make the point that being
LBGT isn't an impediment to reach
ing great heights in your career on
campus and in academia."
In a seven-minute video, five staff
and faculty members reflect on past
heartaches and pain from their child
hood including the suicide of a high
school friend, harassment by class
mates and rejection by loved ones. A
10-minute video featuring students
from the Graduate School of Busi
ness was also filmed. Together they

garnered more than 3,000 views on
You Tube.

"I had my own experiences as a
child of being despised and bullied as
a sissy," said Zwicky. "Later, having
gotten through this, I determined to
be very open about my experiences,
to identify myself publicly as gay, to
work for gay causes and to make my
self available for young people."
Production started when Hugo
Soskin, a former Knight Fellow at the
Stanford Graduate School of Jour
nalism and a QUEST member, of
fered to donate his video expertise.
Prior to the project, Soskin, a docu
mentary producer, had only pro
duced history films for television, but
he was more than willing to play a
vital role in a grassroots cause he had
long admired.
"Anything we can do to help di
minish bullying, and hate is good,"
Soskin said. "I think positive images
in video can really help, and make a
small contribution to creating a bet
ter atmosphere. There's still a lot of
hate out there, and clearly it's driving
some people to want to end their
lives. We have to change that."

Reaction from the LGBT student
community was overwhelmingly
positive. After the videos rapidly
spread through Facebook and email
in September, many students felt
their prospects rise for both their

years at Stanford and their futures
after graduation.
"One of the best things about it
was seeing faculty who were willing
to be out," said Leanna Keyes 'l4, Co-
President of the Stanford Students
For Queer Liberation (SSQL).
"There is kind of a perception in a lot
of fields that if you're out, it's going to
hinder your chances at being success
ful. And yet we have very successful
and notable world-class professors
who are willing to be out and make a

video that's for anyone in the world to
see."

Buoyed by his own stressful en
counters with bullying and prejudice,
Ben Barres, professor of neurobiolo
gy, also participated in the It Gets
Better project. He now serves a men
tor to his LGBT students and hopes
that the video will not only benefit
LGBT students, but also the larger
community.

"People ... are not always aware
of the stress that LGBT people face,"
Barres said. "I hope it helps them to
grow as human beings, to be able to
think about â€” maybe for the first
time how difficult and stressful it
is for LGBT people, and to teach
them to be more supportive, rather
than bullies."
The It Gets Better videos extend
in reach beyond Stanford's bound
aries, sending a message of tolerance
to potential students as well as the
greater public.
"It's really important to me that
this video reaches an audience
broader than the Stanford communi
ty, because it's reaching out to
prospective students still in high
school who are looking for a safe and
accepting university," said Elizabeth
Matus 'l4, a member of the Stanford
LGBT community. "It allows the
community here not only to exist in a
safe space, but also to thrive and

flourish."
Throughout the videos' creation,
Abrahamson envisioned a "young,
new Stanford student struggling with
identity." He believes the videos
added to the dialogue of creating
safer and more inclusive spaces in
education for LGBT community
members.
Keyes believes Stanford is one
such inclusive space.
"Students may be coming from a
home background that's not as ac
cepting or isn't safe. But at least at
Stanford, they're doing what they
can to make sure that you can live
your life authentically," she said.
Abrahamson said he sees the
videos as a means to relay a message
of solidarity with LGBT youth, espe
cially those entering their transition
to college, at Stanford and beyond.
"We need not wait, but some
times we have to," Abrahamson said.
"If you're a young person driven to
succeed by attending a top-notch
university, you may have put off deal
ing with life's issues while focusing
on academics. And once you get
here, it can get all jumbled up and un
manageable. It's in that dark mo
ment that we need to be reminded
that it does get better."

time how difficult and stressful it
is for LGBT people, and to teach
them to be more supportive, rather
than bullies."
The It Gets Better videos extend
in reach beyond Stanford's bound
aries, sending a message of tolerance
to potential students as well as the
greater public.
"It's really important to me that
this video reaches an audience
broader than the Stanford communi
ty, because it's reaching out to
prospective students still in high
school who are looking for a safe and
accepting university," said Elizabeth
Matus 'l4, a member of the Stanford
LGBT community. "It allows the
community here not only to exist in a
safe space, but also to thrive and

flourish."
Throughout the videos' creation,
Abrahamson envisioned a "young,
new Stanford student struggling with
identity." He believes the videos
added to the dialogue of creating
safer and more inclusive spaces in
education for LGBT community
members.
Keyes believes Stanford is one
such inclusive space.
"Students may be coming from a
home background that's not as ac
cepting or isn't safe. But at least at
Stanford, they're doing what they
can to make sure that you can live
your life authentically," she said.
Abrahamson said he sees the
videos as a means to relay a message
of solidarity with LGBT youth, espe
cially those entering their transition
to college, at Stanford and beyond.
"We need not wait, but some
times we have to," Abrahamson said.
"If you're a young person driven to
succeed by attending a top-notch
university, you may have put off deal
ing with life's issues while focusing
on academics. And once you get
here, it can get all jumbled up and un
manageable. It's in that dark mo
ment that we need to be reminded
that it does get better."

Anything we can

diminish bullying

HUGO SOSKIN
Knight Fellow '1 1
mid Stanford's sunny
and scenic campus,
Arnold Zwicky, a
consulting professor
of linguistics, poured
his heart into a camera.
"One of my youngest childhood friends was a
wonderful, sweet kid," Zwicky said in a segment that
is featured in Stanford's contribution to the It Gets

Better project. "A classic, sissy boy... was rejected
by his father in the worst possible way. His life went
downhill and he killed himself in high school."
After seven youth who had been bullied for iden
tifying as LGBT committed suicide last October,
Dan Savage and his partner, founders of the It Gets
Better project, spurred worldwide attention by post
ing a video on You Tube. Speaking candidly into a
camera, they encouraged young adults to "stick out
the bullying, the pain and the despair of high school"
because "living life was the best revenge."
With You Tube as its medium, the It Gets Better
project aims to reach suffering LGBT youth and re
mind them that they are not alone in their struggles.
With more than 40 million views from around the
world, the project has worked to drive home its

message with entries from the likes
of President Barack Obama, a Ma
rine sergeant, an openly gay Unitari
an minister and even Jersey Shore's
Vinny Guadagnino.
Last year, LGBT staff and faculty
at Stanford were inspired by the
25,000 user-created videos and soon
decided to contribute their own per
sonal struggles and triumphs to the It
Gets Better project. After receiving
support from the University and the
Queer University Employees at
Stanford (QUEST) organization,
Noah Abrahamson, a system admin
istrator in information technology
services, quickly became the vision
behind the videos.

"After watching Google's It Gets
Better video, I identified with these
LGBT technology workers and
wanted to put something together
from Stanford," Abrahamson said. "I
wanted to make the point that being
LBGT isn't an impediment to reach
ing great heights in your career on
campus and in academia."
In a seven-minute video, five staff
and faculty members reflect on past
heartaches and pain from their child
hood including the suicide of a high
school friend, harassment by class
mates and rejection by loved ones. A
10-minute video featuring students
from the Graduate School of Busi
ness was also filmed. Together they

garnered more than 3,000 views on
You Tube.

"I had my own experiences as a
child of being despised and bullied as
a sissy," said Zwicky. "Later, having
gotten through this, I determined to
be very open about my experiences,
to identify myself publicly as gay, to
work for gay causes and to make my
self available for young people."
Production started when Hugo
Soskin, a former Knight Fellow at the
Stanford Graduate School of Jour
nalism and a QUEST member, of
fered to donate his video expertise.
Prior to the project, Soskin, a docu
mentary producer, had only pro
duced history films for television, but
he was more than willing to play a
vital role in a grassroots cause he had
long admired.
"Anything we can do to help di
minish bullying, and hate is good,"
Soskin said. "I think positive images
in video can really help, and make a
small contribution to creating a bet
ter atmosphere. There's still a lot of
hate out there, and clearly it's driving
some people to want to end their
lives. We have to change that."

Reaction from the LGBT student
community was overwhelmingly
positive. After the videos rapidly
spread through Facebook and email
in September, many students felt
their prospects rise for both their

years at Stanford and their futures
after graduation.
"One of the best things about it
was seeing faculty who were willing
to be out," said Leanna Keyes 'l4, Co-
President of the Stanford Students
For Queer Liberation (SSQL).
"There is kind of a perception in a lot
of fields that if you're out, it's going to
hinder your chances at being success
ful. And yet we have very successful
and notable world-class professors
who are willing to be out and make a

video that's for anyone in the world to
see."

Buoyed by his own stressful en
counters with bullying and prejudice,
Ben Barres, professor of neurobiolo
gy, also participated in the It Gets
Better project. He now serves a men
tor to his LGBT students and hopes
that the video will not only benefit
LGBT students, but also the larger
community.

"People ... are not always aware
of the stress that LGBT people face,"
Barres said. "I hope it helps them to
grow as human beings, to be able to
think about â€” maybe for the first
time how difficult and stressful it
is for LGBT people, and to teach
them to be more supportive, rather
than bullies."
