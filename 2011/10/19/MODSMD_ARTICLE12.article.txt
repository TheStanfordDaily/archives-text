## OP-ED Sensitivities in survivor discourse 
### VIVIANA ARCIA '13 President of the Women's Coalition 
"... At nine years old, Oprah Win
frey was sexually assaulted.

When she was 13, she ran
away from home. A year
later, she gave birth to a
child that died in infancy. Living in
poverty, Winfrey wore clothes made
of potato sacks. She was made fun of
relentlessly at school. Her childhood
was replete with tragedy. Despite
this, Oprah advanced from crisis to
crisis with unfettered resolve. She
never stopped dancing. She never
lost her 50u1..."

It is messages like these, sent by
E2.0, the former entrepreneurship
arm of the ASSU, which has now
separated from the student govern
ment, to students affiliated with
business/entrepreneurship on cam
pus, that reiterate the fact that Stan
ford can still be plagued by insensi
tivity concerning sexual violence
against both men and women.
For starters, the message
fetishizes a deeply traumatic and vi
olent event as nothing more than a
stepping-stone for career and life
success, as the E2.0 message indi
cates was the case for Oprah Win
frey. Secondly, it names the violence
without analyzing its roots or its
after-effects. In fact, the message as
sumes that survivors, like Oprah
Winfrey, should shrug off the as
sault, pull themselves up from the
bootstraps and aspire to entrepre
neurial greatness.

However, those sensitized to sex
ual violence know that survivors of
sexual assault and relationship
abuse are likely to experience se
vere feelings of anxiety and fear,
known as Post Traumatic Stress Dis
order (PTSD), withdrawal, guilt,
nervousness and distrust of others.
And while this says nothing of the
fact that most survivors show an ex
traordinary degree of resiliency
after their assault or abuse, it does
indicate that the effects of sexual vi
olence are pronounced, can last a
considerable amount of time and
catalyze a variety of emotional, psy
chological and physical effects.
Moreover, because the message was
written in the spirit of self-reliance
and autonomy, it obscures the fact
that many survivors do not ade
quately heal without wide commu
nity support from organizations, ad
vocates and counseling services. As
such, the message would suggest
that survivors not exhibiting entre
preneurial self-sufficiency are unde
serving of career and personal ful
fillment or seen as lazy and some

how deficient.
Instead, Oprah Winfrey's sexual
abuse is normalized in the message,
which one can posit as being an ex
tension of the wider societal nor
malization of patriarchal norms.
And while I don't negate the fact
that we are all subjects within a pa
triarchal and sexist society, and are
thereby affected by ideals and poli
cies that contribute to its continued
existence, I am also deeply disap
pointed that the ASSU Executive
team, led by Michael Cruz 'l2 and
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3, did
not critically interrogate both the
messaging of the email that was sent
out on their administration's behalf
as well as the societal conceptions of

victimhood, victim-blaming and the
effects of sexual and intimate part
ner violence, on both men and
women. And considering it is esti
mated that one in three women will
be sexually assaulted in her lifetime
and one in four will experience do
mestic abuse, it is vital that all in the
Stanford community take sexual
and domestic violence seriously.
Lastly, the messaging of the E2.0
email reveals one of the follies of
American entrepreneurship and the
trailblazing spirit we at Stanford
pride ourselves on. Rather than
questioning the systemic and struc
tural inequalities and barriers that
had caused Winfrey's poverty-strick
en roots, the messaging instead cele
brates that most capitalistic of no
tions: that we are all the masters of
our destiny and any failure to achieve
monetary success or significant social

It is vital that all in
the Stanford
community take
sexual and
domestic
violence seriously
