## Win-Win-Win 
### Amanda Ach 
Everyone reading this column
has had a dispute with anoth
er person. Some of them are
serious maybe your ex won't pay
child support while some are
slightly less so, such as a confronta
tion with a roommate who whistles
constantly or a housemate who
hoards the Doritos (you know who
you are). Unfortunately for us, con
flicts are everywhere. Although
some people myself excluded
can apparently resolve these con
flicts in mature, calm ways, even the
most level-headed people some
times need outside intervention to
deal with the big stuff. In this law
suit-happy culture, our first instinct
when things don't go our way is
often to take legal action. But law
suits are expensive and require the
kind of time and money most Amer
icans simply don't have in this econ
omy.

And that is where this week's
topic, the professional mediator,
steps in.

With the legal system as over
loaded and inefficient as it is, more

people, companies, organizations
and even countries are seeking out
mediation as away to resolve prob
lems without going bankrupt in the
process. As a professional mediator,
you would provide a less expensive
and arguably more effective method
of conflict resolution than the
American legal system allows. A
mediator also offers a different type
of resolution than a judge where
as a judge will hear lawyers present
the two sides of a conflict and deliv
er a verdict, a mediator works in a
more hands-on style, interacting
with the parties directly to help
them reach a conclusion that will
make everyone happy. And as an
added bonus, you can mediate in
your regular clothes, instead of hav
ing to wear one of those shapeless
black robes that do nothing for your
figure.

Becoming a mediator isn't as dif
ficult as you might think the only
real requirement is the completion
of a training program in mediation,
as well as the ability to listen, prob
lem-solve creatively and remain un-

biased through the course of a nego
tiation. A successful mediator also
tends to come from an educational
background in public policy, law or
another related field. A legal degree
is not necessary, but depending on
the type of mediation work you will
be doing, it might be useful. Basical
ly, this means you could have a job
right after graduation, no graduate
school necessary. You're welcome.
One of the best aspects of Alter
native Dispute Resolution a
fancy umbrella term for mediation
â€”is that as a mediator, you can
choose what type of conflicts you
want to mediate. Some mediators
focus on international relations is
sues, working closely with politicians
and diplomats to help effect change
on an international scale. Not sur
prisingly, studies show this is the least
effective form of mediation (hello,
Israeli-Palestinian conflict). Other

mediators choose to work on envi
ronmental issues or business dis
putes, but the most common form of
mediation is in interpersonal con
flicts, such as custody battles and di
vorce cases. Lastly, celebrities are
turning to professional mediators
more and more as away of avoiding
negative publicity, so if you don't re
ally care about helping people but
you do want to meet Charlie Sheen,
you could always focus your career
on this subset.
Excluding those mediators who
are just in it for the famous people, it
takes a very specific kind of person
to want to spend their life making
stubborn people agree, but in the
end it can be incredibly rewarding.
You will get to meet people from all
walks of life and, especially if you
work in international mediation,
you will get to travel a lot most
often on someone else's dime.

In addition to being a lifelong,

fulfilling career, professional media
tion can also function as a stepping
stone to other fields. Some people
choose to work in mediation for a
year or two before going to law
school, while others use it as away

to get into a career as a diplomat or
politician. Regardless of what ca
reer path you take, the ability to suc
cessfully mediate a conflict is an im

portant skill to have and will serve
anyone well throughout life. And
who knows? You just might be the
person to solve all of the world's
problems.

Amanda really hates it when people
hoard the Doritos. If you want to
