# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Learning to fail through improv 
### Jamie Solomon 
This weekend was the Stan
ford Improvisors' (Simps)
20th reunion. I spent the
whole weekend doing improv with
alumni, getting to know them and
hearing them reflect on the role that
improv and the ideas behind it have
had on their lives. As one alumnus
said, "Improv is so much more than
improv," and it has truly affected
many of the alumni's lives in more
profound ways than simply being
the focus of a group they were part
of in college. In many ways, improv
is a philosophy for life, and the
tenets behind it can be paradigm
shifting for students in an environ
ment like Stanford's.

Living at Stanford can be taxing
at times because everyone is always
running around, there's so much to
do and everyone you know is amaz
ing at everything. Because of this,
joining our improv group has been

one of the best things that has hap
pened to me at Stanford. It has
given me an all-too-brief respite
from the Stanford grind a few
days each week in which anything
and everything I do is wonderful,
there are no standards to measure
up to and I get to both fail and em
brace my failure. The lessons I've
learned in Drama 103 and with the
Simps can't help but seep into the
rest of my life.
Improv teachers from Stanford
deliberately set up environments
with as little pressure as possible,
which is such a gift to students. You
don't have to do anything you don't
want to and you can do no wrong. In
practice and class, everyone will sit
on one side of the room and a few
kids will stand up at a time in front
of the group and improvise scenes
or play games. If I'm having a bad
day and don't feel like doing any

thing, I have the ability just to sit on
the floor and watch everyone for
two hours and laugh.
However, I also know that if I de
cide to get up and be in a scene, I
have full permission to be terrible.
Without this understanding, im
provisation doesn't work. When
doing improv, you can't try to be
funny and you can't try to be good.
Often, the harder you try to be
funny, the less interesting the audi
ence finds your performance. The
comedy comes much more fre
quently from the surprising or
bizarre moments, or when there's a
strong grain of truth. Lines deliv
ered to make the audience laugh
will often fall flat. Pressuring your
self to try to make a good scene is
also almost guaranteed to backfire
doing so inflicts a form of paraly
sis. If you can only do things that
you know ahead of time will be

good, then you cease to do any
thing, and a scene immediately dies.
The only thing to do is embrace
the fact that you will fail. Every time
you stand up to perform, you accept
the possibility that you may be
awful, and that it is perfectly okay.
You don't try to be the best impro
viser; you just try to be average
(which, for a Stanford student, is a
mind-boggling point of view to
take). All you have to do is just show
up and do something. Just be pres
ent in the scene, listen to others and
react. There are no lines to forget.
There are no critics in the audience.
You can't do anything wrong be
cause to do good improv, you have
to do bad improv.
And at Stanford, this is the most
refreshing mindset. It's one of the
things that has kept me sane in the
past year. It's a space where I don't
have to do anything well. I just have

to do it, and that alone is enough to
bring me joy. So much of the rest of
my time is spent stressing out about
trying to write a great paper, im
pressing my professor (especially
salient because I'm at the point
where letters of recommendation
become important) or keeping my
grades at the high standard I've set
for myself. I want to excel in every
thing else at Stanford. In fact, there
have been numerous times where
I've looked around at all my friends
and acquaintances and thought
about how much of an underachiev
er I seem to be considering that
everyone here seemingly spends all
their time making the impossible
happen. But then I go to Simps
practice and am reminded that it's
