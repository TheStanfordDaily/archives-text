## TWICE AS NICE Wopat twins balance each other on and off the volleyball court 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
For years, the wide world of
sports' sibling rivalries has
filled our television screens
and newspaper pages. Peyton
and Eli. Venus and Serena.
Ronde and Tiki.
But for two Stanford volleyball stars,
bloodlines disappear once they hit the
court.
"To be honest, when I'm on the court
I don't even think of her as my sister,"
sophomore outside hitter Sam Wopat
said. "When we're in the volleyball zone,
everybody around us is just another play
er. We're competing and trying to win."
"It is kind of fun when we get a block
right next to each other," sophomore
middle blocker Carly Wopat chips in.
"It's like a twin block."

force this season in helping the No. 5
Cardinal reach 14-3 (8-3 Pac-12).
Carly was named the Pac-12 Offen
sive Player of the Week for Sep. 26-
Oct. 2 as well as the Pac-12 Defen
sive Player of the Week on Sep. 12
making her the only player ever
to win Offensive and Defensive
Player of the Week awards in Pac-12
volleyball.
Not too shabby for sisters who
began playing volleyball in middle
school because a PE teacher started
an after-school program.
"We would just pick up the ball
and throw it over the net," Carly said.
Soon after, they started club vol
leyball, and the twins have been play
ing ever since.

As seniors, they won myriad hon
ors and were ranked No. 4 (Carly)
and No. 40 (Sam) in Prep Volleyball's
Senior Aces national rankings. They
also led their team to the CIF Divi
sion 1A Southern California title, an
experience the duo said has helped
them here on the Farm.

"Our team had a lot of energy and
we would get after it, so I think we
brought that energy and effort with
us to Stanford," Carly said. "We also
learned some leadership skills."
"I also learned how important
team chemistry is because our high
school team was great," Sam said. "I
loved everyone on that team. It's sort

of the same thing here, our team gets
along so well, and that actually really
helps on the court when you can turn
to someone and completely trust
them."
But it's not all volleyball, all the
time for the Wopats. With the little
free time that they do have, the twins

can be found painting, hiking the
Dish, shopping and visiting family
friends in the area.

Carly, a prospective human biolo
gy major, is working her way through
the subject's core classes, a difficult
task that she loves. Sam recently de
cided to major in English with a cre
ative writing focus, and is dabbling in
a variety of courses from Hawaiian
language to poetry.
Sam enjoys the team's road trips,
where she can focus on schoolwork
without distractions, while Carly
spoke half-fondly of reading and
studying in airports and hotel rooms.
With their academics under con
trol, the duo must turn their atten
tion back to the court. In a week and
a halÂ£ they will face USC and UCLA
at home in Maples Pavilion on Oct.
28 and 29. The Cardinal lost to both
squads 3-2 to UCLA and 3-0 to
USC in Los Angeles earlier this
season.
Both Wopats said the revenge
factor is "giant" for the two games.
"We're going to crush them,"
Carly said.
"We feel more prepared this
time," Sam added. "We hope we can
get lots of students and supporters
out here to see the slaughterhouse
on the court."

Both will get their shot in a little
over a week. But before then, they
must handle a weekend road trip to
the desert to face Arizona and Ari
zona State.
