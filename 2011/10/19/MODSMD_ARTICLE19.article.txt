# RED ZONE PERFECTION
## Offense clicking inside opponents' 20-yard line 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After six weeks of games, the
Stanford football team has a lot of
impressive statistics that would
make other teams envious. The Car
dinal has the nation's longest win
ning streak and a perfect record to
start the season, and has beaten nine
straight opponents by more than 25
points. And perhaps one of the
biggest reasons for Stanford's spot
less record is a simple fact the
Cardinal is perfect inside the red
zone so far this season.
The No. 7 Cardinal (6-0,4-0 Pac
-12) has yet to make a mistake offen
sively in the red zone, scoring on all
31 of its drives inside the oppo
nent's 20-yard line. Stanford's 100-
percent conversion rate makes it
just one of three teams in the nation
that has yet to be stopped inside the
20-yard line on offense this season,
along with Mid-American Confer
ence rivals Western Michigan and
Ball State.

The Cardinal offense attributes
its success deep in opponents' terri
tory to three things: frame of mind,
creativity and conditioning.
"I think it's the mentality. We
want to finish the drives," junior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor said. "It
shows greatness if you can drive the
ball 99 yards, and that's what a
team's all about, but once you're
down there, you're just like 'l've got
to get it in.'"

"I think the coaches do a great
job of putting us in position to be
successful [in the red zone]," junior
tight end Zach Ertz said. "[Offensive
coordinator] Pep Hamilton's in
charge of that and he comes up with
some pretty unique plays.
"After those long drives, the de
fense is usually pretty tired, we do a
lot of conditioning over the summer
to keep us in shape, and we know the
defense is tired so that gives us an ad
vantage," Ertz continued.
Inside the red zone this season,
the Cardinal has scored 13 rushing
touchdowns, 12 passing touchdowns
and six field goals, a stat that nicely
shows off the Cardinal's offensive
versatility, Taylor said.

"I think it goes both ways, we run
the ball so it opens up the pass and
we have the wide receivers and tight

ends down there making big plays,"
he said. "So that's helping us out be
cause all the running backs are get
ting big holes. Once we're in the goal
line, we have big receivers and big
tight ends, so it's hard for the defense
to guard the run and the pass."
Both Taylor and Ertz did mention
that those six field goals were nag
ging on the offense's record, al
though Taylor did allow that scoring
touchdowns 80 percent of the time
was a "more realistic goal" for the of
fense.

"We never want to settle for a
field goal," Ertz said. "The goal is al
ways touchdowns every time we're
down there."

With all that success down near
the end zone, there are plenty of
touchdowns to be had and plenty of
players who are capable of scoring,
as 12 Cardinal players have already
found the paint this season. Ertz says
that having so much talent on the
field means there's a little extra mo
tivation to cross the goal line when
the ball is in your hands.
"I would say it's more of a friend
ly competition, you know? None of
us really talk about [scoring touch
downs], we're always happy for an

[junior tight end LevineToilolo] scor
ing two last week and [redshirt senior
tight end Coby Fleener], that kind of
set the ante for this week. Hopefully
we'll have some more."

In addition to being flawless in
the red zone on offense, Stanford
isn't too shabby on defense inside
the 20 either. The Cardinal has al
lowed only 59 percent of opponents'
drives inside the red zone to end with
points so far, a stat that makes them
the best in the Pac-12 at preventing

opponents from scoring. Stanford is
one of just three teams to allow
points on fewer than 60 percent of
opponents' drives inside the 20, with
the other two being No. 3 Oklahoma
and Rutgers.
But maybe it shouldn't be such a
surprise that Stanford succeeds
where it matters most on both sides
of the ball after all, red is its most
flattering color.
Stanford will put its perfect red
zone record and 14-game win streak
on the line this Saturday against No.
22 Washington, the first time the Car
dinal will be tested against a ranked
opponent so far this season.

want to finish the drives," junior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor said. "It
shows greatness if you can drive the
ball 99 yards, and that's what a
team's all about, but once you're
down there, you're just like 'l've got
to get it in.'"

"I think the coaches do a great
job of putting us in position to be
successful [in the red zone]," junior
tight end Zach Ertz said. "[Offensive
coordinator] Pep Hamilton's in
charge of that and he comes up with
some pretty unique plays.
"After those long drives, the de
fense is usually pretty tired, we do a
lot of conditioning over the summer
to keep us in shape, and we know the
defense is tired so that gives us an ad
vantage," Ertz continued.
Inside the red zone this season,
the Cardinal has scored 13 rushing
touchdowns, 12 passing touchdowns
and six field goals, a stat that nicely
shows off the Cardinal's offensive
versatility, Taylor said.

"I think it goes both ways, we run
the ball so it opens up the pass and
we have the wide receivers and tight

ends down there making big plays,"
he said. "So that's helping us out be
cause all the running backs are get
ting big holes. Once we're in the goal
line, we have big receivers and big
tight ends, so it's hard for the defense
to guard the run and the pass."
Both Taylor and Ertz did mention
that those six field goals were nag
ging on the offense's record, al
though Taylor did allow that scoring
touchdowns 80 percent of the time
was a "more realistic goal" for the of
fense.

"We never want to settle for a
field goal," Ertz said. "The goal is al
ways touchdowns every time we're
down there."

With all that success down near
the end zone, there are plenty of
touchdowns to be had and plenty of
players who are capable of scoring,
as 12 Cardinal players have already
found the paint this season. Ertz says
that having so much talent on the
field means there's a little extra mo
tivation to cross the goal line when
the ball is in your hands.
"I would say it's more of a friend
ly competition, you know? None of
us really talk about [scoring touch
downs], we're always happy for an

[junior tight end LevineToilolo] scor

tight end Coby Fleener], that kind of
set the ante for this week. Hopefully
we'll have some more."

In addition to being flawless in
the red zone on offense, Stanford
isn't too shabby on defense inside
the 20 either. The Cardinal has al
lowed only 59 percent of opponents'
drives inside the red zone to end with
points so far, a stat that makes them
the best in the Pac-12 at preventing

opponents from scoring. Stanford is
one of just three teams to allow
points on fewer than 60 percent of
opponents' drives inside the 20, with
the other two being No. 3 Oklahoma
and Rutgers.
But maybe it shouldn't be such a
surprise that Stanford succeeds
where it matters most on both sides
of the ball after all, red is its most
flattering color.
Stanford will put its perfect red
zone record and 14-game win streak
on the line this Saturday against No.
22 Washington, the first time the Car
dinal will be tested against a ranked
opponent so far this season.
