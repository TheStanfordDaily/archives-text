## ASSU passes DIR, talks USC travel Senate unanimously approves Division of Internal Review 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting
on Tuesday night started off with unanimous
passage of the bill establishing the Division of
Internal Review (DIR), a bill that failed at last
week's Senate meeting.
The remainder of the meeting focused on
different aspects of facilitating student travel to
the Oct. 29 Stanford-USC football game, as well
as addressing the resignation of the two co
chairs of entrepreneurship.
The modified bill establishes the DIR as an
oversight committee within the ASSU, intended
to issue unbiased qualitative and quantitative
analyses of financial data for Voluntary Student
Organizations (VSOs) and ASSU spending.
Controversial language, which was discussed
at last week's meeting and stated that DIR
members had to sign "confidentially agree
ments" even though all the information they
will access comes from publicly available infor
mation, was included in the final bill.
The bill clarified that the DIR will keep the
names of officers and members of VSOs confi
dential, but does not specify if this is the only
item being kept confidential.

Earlier language in the bill said that the DIR
issues "unbiased, non-judgmental" reports
about the spending of student groups who re
ceive money from the ASSU by the fifth week of
winter quarter. These reports will
be available to the public upon re
quest. The DIR is also mandated to
provide at least three reports to the
ASSU legislative bodies and to the
Executive each quarter.

The ASSU Executive will also
conduct weekly "reviews" of the
DlR's work.

The senate unanimously con
firmed Andrew Aguilar 'l4 as the
DlR's executive director.

In addition to passing the bills
establishing the DIR, the Under
graduate Senate also unanimously
approved a renewal of the Vaden
Advisory Committee, which was
enacted two years ago in a bill au
thored by current ASSU president
and then-senator Michael Cruz 'l2.

Cruz briefly addressed the re
cent resignation of Dan Thompson
'l3 and Jonathan Manzi 'l3. After
stating that E2.0 would be separat
ed from the ASSU, Cruz fielded
questions from Senator Alon El
hanan 'l4, who wanted to know
how Thompson and Manzi got ac
cess to the campus-wide email list.
"For those particular emails, I
have no knowledge of how they
were able to get those emails or
those names," Cruz said.

He also said that at the ASSU
Executive retreat last weekend,
they discussed updated measures
to ensure that similar incidents
would be prevented in the future.

Discussion then turned to the
USC-Stanford football game,

which Senators Ben Laufer 'l2 and
Nate Garcia 'l4 have been working
to organize. Under the advisement
of Nanci Howe, director of Student
Activities and Leadership (SAL),
the ASSU will no longer be spon
soring the event.

Laufer and Garcia informed the
Senate of Howe's advice. The com
pany organizing the event did sign a
document indemnifying the Uni
versity and the ASSU from all lia
bility stemming from the trip. How
ever, Howe still advised members
of the ASSU to avoid direct en
dorsement.

Though they will not officially
sponsor the trip, the Senate decided
to spend a large amount of their re
maining funding to subsidize stu
dent tickets. Of their remaining
$2,400 in their traditions fund, the
Senate approved $1,400, as well as
$6OO from their general discre
tionary fund, which is left with
$1,400 dollars.
The Senate is hoping that this
$2,000 will be matched by the
ASSU Executive discretionary
fund as well as the Axe Commit
tee's budget. Laufer estimated 400
students would be interested in
tickets and set a goal of raising
$B,OOO to subsidize tickets by $2O.

Election Commissioner Adam
Adler 'l2 also gave an update near
the end of the meeting. Besides set
ting the date for the election for the
Thursday and Friday during the
second week of Spring Quarter,
Adler also said he is still having
trouble filling the position of Assis
tant Elections Commissioner.
