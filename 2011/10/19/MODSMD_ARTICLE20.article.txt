# The 						effects of Harbaugh live on
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Jim Harbaugh might be a
brash, abrasive and fiery son of
a bitch, but don't say that he
doesn't give a damn good
handshake. Jim Schwartz
found that out the hard way on Sunday,
right after Harbaugh's 49ers turned
Schwartz's Detroit Lions into house
cats.

But while Harbaugh's untucked
shirt from that very same fracas may
now rival Jet's coach Rex Ryan's long
standing foot fetish as the best body
part-related controversy to discuss
around the office, don't let that stop us
from realizing just what James Joseph
Harbaugh has meant to the Stanford
football program.
There are many who doubted that
Harbaugh would be the one to resur
rect a team that went 1-11 in 2006, the
year before the then-42-year old took
over for Walt Harris.

Harbaugh had previously been the
head coach at the University of San
Diego, a I-AA school that doesn't offer
scholarships. He had never coached in
I-A, had no experience recruiting I-A
players and was turned down from the
coaching gig at Tulane a program
that has averaged three wins over the
past four seasons.
But those who doubted Harbaugh
then (and yes I'm talking to you, Jon
Wilner) overlooked how big of an ass
hole Harbaugh can be, particularly
when it comes to the gridiron. As the
son of a college football coach, Har
baugh has been immersed in the game
since birth, and according to those who
know him best, is totally consumed and
driven by it.
He was a hell of a quarterback him
self he led the Wolverines to a No. 2
finish in 1985-86 and led the nation in
efficiency in the same season mak
ing it to the NFL and coming inches
away from playing in Super Bowl
XXX.

More importantly, over the course
of his career, Harbaugh suited up for
coaches like Bo "To hell with Notre
Dame" Schembechler and Mike "Get
your mouth shut" Ditka. A1 "Just win,
baby" Davis gave him his first shot at
coaching in the NFL, and Harbaugh
freely admits that his only true passions
in life are football and his family no
body else matters.
At last year's Orange Bowl, he told
the New York Times that for all the
complexities in his offensive schemes
on the field, he is a pretty simple guy.
"I just concentrate on doing a good
job at what I'm doing,"he said.'Tmjust
very superficial in that way. I'm as

transparent as a baggie. There's noth
ing deep. You can't peel back the
onion."

Which is why he didn't really apolo
gize after giving Schwartz a tight
squeeze and back-slap in the tradition
al postgame exchange on Sunday, in
stead bordering on the sarcastic in the
press conference and making fun of
Schwartz by saying that he just gave
him a little too hard of a handshake.

But that is what Harbaugh brought
to the Farm, and although he has
moved on without looking back, the at
titude remains. Look at the defense: led
by senior linebacker Chase Thomas, a
Harbaugh recruit, it's among the best
in the country and plays with a ferocity
that Harbaugh would love.
And most of all, look to the future,
because while Harbaugh gave Stan
ford fans a couple of excellent years
and an amazing Orange Bowl victory
last season, his legacy will continue.
Stanford football is back, and while
LAL (Life after Luck) might seem
like the apocalypse, the world will not
end in 2012 (unless 2012 is correct).
I imagine the Harbaugh effect will
last for at least five years, during
which fans will continue to come to
Stanford Stadium because the prod
uct on the field is worth it, and David
Shaw incidentally a hell of a coach
in his own right, and definitely one of
the quickest wits in all of college foot
ball will continue to reap the ben
efits in the recruiting wars waged all
year long.
By then we might not have found
another Toby or another Luck, be
cause those are once-in-a-blue-moon
kind of players. But we could easily
have gotten our hands on two or
three Skovs, a Fleener or two and
maybe a David DeCastro if we're
lucky.

That is something to be hopeful
about, and Jim Harbaugh succeeded
where plenty of others failed on the
Farm he brought in a culture of win
ning and an attitude that had lasting
roots. The man can coach how else
do you explain the Alex Smith-led Nin
ers sitting at 5-1 and it's hard not to
miss his fiery exploits and skirmishes
with Pete Carroll.

What's his deal? It's hard to say, but
I'm glad to see Harbaugh trucking
right along because what he has plant
ed at Stanford will continue to keep
Cardinal fans happy for years to come.

Miles can respect a good handshake,
and he can definitely sympathize with
Harbaugh's uncontrollable desire to
de-shirt himself in moments of joy. If
