## Cardinal stumbles at Stanford Intercollegiate 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Riding high after a second place
finish at the Cougar Invitational last
month, the women's golf team got
off to a solid start as host of the Stan
ford Intercollegiate this past week
end, shooting a combined two-under
to sit in fourth place after the first
round of play. But trouble struck on
the second day of competition, and
the Card couldn't make up much of
the large gap in the third round ei
ther, finishing the 16-team event in a
tie for 10th place.

Junior Kristina Wong and fresh
man Mariko Tumangan were the
low scoring individuals for Stanford
after shooting identical 218s to tie
for 39th place overall Washing
ton's Soo√üin Kim took the tourna
ment title with a three-round total
of 200,13-under par.
On Friday, it appeared as though
the Cardinal would again threaten
for a team title, despite being just
No. 42 in Golfweek's national rank
ings and not having an individual
golfer inside the top-100.
Junior Sally Watson, who won
the individual title at the Cougar In
vitational, put together a very solid
round of 70, tying classmate Maris
sa Mar for 13th place overall at one
under. And with Tumangan and
Wong coming in just a stroke back
after even par 71s, the Cardinal had

four players inside the top 25.
(Sophomore Danielle Frasier shot
an 84, but only the top-four scorers
per team count in collegiate golf.)
But the team's play took a turn
for the worse on Day 2. All four of
Stanford's top scorers from the pre
vious day finished at least three
strokes worse than they did on Day
1 Watson shot a 77, Wong shot a
74 and Mar and Tumangan shot 755,
while senior Lila Barton competed
as an individual and was the lone
bright spot with a one-under 70.
Weather conditions never really
came into play, and Watson said it
wasn't easy to pinpoint any one
problem that the team struggled
with. "I think our varied perform
ance had many reasons," she said,
"but that's just golf. Some days it's
easy and other days you have to
fight for everything."
It might not have mattered all
that much, as No. 1 UCLA ran away
from the field despite finishing the
final round at +2. The Bruins fin
ished with a 54-hole total of 842 (-
10), and placed six golfers in the top
25 overall. And if Stephanie Kono
had not been playing as an individ
ual and had counted for the
UCLA's team score, the Bruins
would actually have finished 23-
under par and won by 16 strokes.
However, Stanford did manage
to battle back in Round 3 and, al
though not playing as well as it had
in the first round, the Card moved
up three places in the standings.
Wong and Tumangan shot rounds of
73 and 72, respectively, to slide into
the top 50 overall, and Watson and
Mar finished just behind in ties for
62nd and 53rd, respectively.
Watson was encouraged by the
way the team responded competi
tively. "Individually, everyone is
looking good," she said. "I feel like
all of the returners have done a

good job of improving their games
over the summer and our freshman
is also doing a great job contribut
ing towards the team."
And Wong pointed out that
struggling in Round 2 actually pro
vided the team with an opportunity
to work on some aspects of the
game that it wouldn't have been
able to otherwise. "We had a rough
second day so we really didn't have
anything to lose," she said. "Our
main goal for the final round of the
tournament was to play fearless
golf. I think from now on we have to
take that mentality to every tourna
ment. We need to stop playing de
fensive golf and start playing more
aggressive."
In addition, Tumangan proved
that she will be a very valuable con
tributor throughout the upcoming
season, and there will likely be a
very healthy competition for the
team's final few spots.
And if the tournament was any
indication, the Pac-12 will be a very
difficult conference to navigate
when the season begins in February
three schools finished at even
par or better, and there are eight
Pac-12 teams in the top 21 of
Golfweek's rankings.

None of that is in the forefront of
the team's mind, however, accord
ing to Watson. "I think right now it is
so early in the season that it is just
important that as a team and as in
dividuals we learn from every tour
nament and every experience so
that come springtime we are pre
pared to compete with the best
teams in the country," Watson said
after the tournament. "We have a
lot of potential. We just need to
learn how to perform more consis
tently under pressure."
