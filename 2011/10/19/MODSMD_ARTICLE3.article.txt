# Guns cost county $50M
## Violence has economic impact on San Mateo County 
### MARY HARRISON 
A recent study published by
San Mateo County officials
found that gun violence costs
county taxpayers $5O million per
year.

The study was conducted by
the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) and pre
sented by supervisor Rose Ja
cobs-Gibson at a public forum
held on Sept. 29. Charisse Le
bron-Cannon, who staffed the
project from beginning to end,
said Jacobs-Gibson hopes to
"create a continuing dialogue"
with community leaders to find
solutions to alleviate the gun vi
olence.

Between 2004 and 2009, the
county experienced 133 non
fatal gun violence injuries and 36
fatal injuries. According to the
report, each non-fatal injury cost
taxpayers $46,000 and each fatal
injury cost $6.4 million.

The costs included crimi
nal proceedings, lost wages,
medical care and long-term neg
ative effects on the victims' qual
ity of life, the report said. The re
port also accounted for busi
nesses located in dangerous
neighborhoods that suffer eco
nomic costs due to the violence.
According to the study, almost
40 percent of adults surveyed
avoid shopping in areas they
consider to be "risky."
Over the past 20 years, the
pattern of gun violence in the re
gion has changed noticeably, the
report said. Supervisor Jacobs-
Gibson's office reported a peak
in youth gun violence in the
19905. Rebecca Irwin, an aide for
Jacobs-Gibson, said this was fol
lowed by a surge of community
action, including the formation
of a Crime Reduction Taskforce
in East Palo Alto, that curbed
the rise of gang violence.
However, Irwin added that

I V these numbers have
been "slowly creeping
up for the past six or
seven years," prompting
the ABAG to commission
the survey on youth gun vi
olence in San Mateo Coun
ty.
The report gave county

officers points of comparison
between the rates of gun vio
lence in San Mateo County and
other areas. For example, while
the county's number of gun
deaths per capita is approximate
ly 40 percent lower than the na
tional average, this statistic is also
55 percent higher than the rate in
San Jose, a much larger urban
area.

According to the report, gun
violence in San Mateo County is
not evenly spread. Four cities
East Palo Alto, Redwood City,
Daly City and South San Fran
cisco which account for only
37 percent of the county's total
population, account for 57 per
cent of the instances of non-fatal
gun violence and 74 percent of
gun violence fatalities.
"The particularly pro
nounced levels of gang violence
[in these areas] can be attributed
to a myriad of factors like high
unemployment as high as 18

percent in East Palo Alto and
multigenerational incarcera
tion," Lebron-Cannon said.
In addition to showing that
gun violence is not distributed
evenly geographically, the study
reported that different races are
more likely to be involved in gun
violence to different degrees.
According to the county's gun
violence data from 2004 to 2009,
young black men are more than
three and a half times more like
ly to be shot and killed than
other youths, and Latinos are 14
percent more likely to be killed
than youths of other races in San
Mateo County.

Jacobs-Gibson said the sur
vey also revealed how easy it
was for youth to access firearms.
A majority of those surveyed, all
under the age of 18, reported
that they thought they could get
a gun "with one phone call."
According to Lebron-Can
non, the supervisor has a "wish
list" of programs that she would
like to enact to help curb gun vi
olence in the county if she had
unlimited funds, but for now, the
emphasis will be placed on
grassroots community solutions.
