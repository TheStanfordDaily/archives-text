## Cornell, Technion join forces in NYC applied-sciences bid 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Cornell University announced
Tuesday morning that it is partner
ing withTechnion-Israel Institute of
Technology to submit a proposal to
build an applied sciences graduate
campus in New York City.

The announcement of this part
nership comes one week after Stan
ford unveiled Stanford@CCNY, a
collaboration with City College of
New York (CCNY) which would
serve as a launching pad for the
University to build the potential
campus if it wins the bid.
A New York Times article pub
lished Oct. 16 named Cornell as
Stanford's top rival in the bid to
build the new science campus.
While Stanford will submit its pro
posal independently of CCNY, Cor
nell andTechnion will submit a joint
bid for the Technion-Cornell Inno

vation Institute.
Technion, located in Haifa, is
heavily focused on computer sci
ences and electrical engineering.
The university, home to the 2011
Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate
Daniel Shechtman. is considered an
incubator for Israel's recent high
tech boom and was one of the 18 in
ternational universities that ex
pressed interest in the competition
when it submitted an outline of its
plans for the campus in March.
With over 4,000 tech startups in
Israel, the nation ranks only behind
Silicon Valley in tech innovation, ac

cording to Technion President
Peretz Lavie in the announcement.
The Institute's success has led big
name companies such as Google,
Microsoft and Qualcomm to build
outposts near its Haifa campus in
order to lure new graduates, Lavie
added.
Despite its strong tech back
ground, Technion's status as a pub
lic university makes it unable to
meet the capital demands of build
ing a campus from scratch, Lavie
said in the announcement.
"We had to find an American
partner," Lavie said to the New York
Times. "We didn't believe that we
can do it alone,"

According to a joint Cornell-
Technion announcement, if its joint
bid for a campus is accepted, a full
scale institute would open in 2012 in
either leased space or existing Cor
nell facilities in New York. Though
its main campus is located in upstate
New York, the university operates
its medical school campus in NYC.
Eventually, the so-called NYC Tech
campus would grow to over 2 million
square feet on Roosevelt Island
also the site of Stanford's proposed
campus serving nearly 2,000
graduate students and 250 faculty.
The project has been estimated
to cost $1 billion, rivaling Stanford's
projected $1 to $2 billion plans.
The new campus, which the an
nouncement noted would be a full
fledged campus and not a satellite of
either school, would initially offer
Cornell degrees. The new institute
would offer duel degrees fromTech
nion and Cornell after New York
State grants its approval of the de
gree programs.
Bids are due Oct. 28, and a deci
sion from the New York City Eco
nomic Development Corporation
(NYCEDC) is expected by the end
of the calendar year.
