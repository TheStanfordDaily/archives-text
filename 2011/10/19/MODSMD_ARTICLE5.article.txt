## Cornell, Technion join forces in NYC applied-sciences bid 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Cornell University announced
Tuesday morning that it is partner
ing withTechnion-Israel Institute of
Technology to submit a proposal to
build an applied sciences graduate
campus in New York City.

The announcement of this part
nership comes one week after Stan
ford unveiled Stanford@CCNY, a
collaboration with City College of
New York (CCNY) which would
serve as a launching pad for the
University to build the potential
campus if it wins the bid.
A New York Times article pub
lished Oct. 16 named Cornell as
Stanford's top rival in the bid to
build the new science campus.
While Stanford will submit its pro
posal independently of CCNY, Cor
nell andTechnion will submit a joint
bid for the Technion-Cornell Inno

vation Institute.
Technion, located in Haifa, is
heavily focused on computer sci
ences and electrical engineering.
The university, home to the 2011
Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate
Daniel Shechtman. is considered an
incubator for Israel's recent high
tech boom and was one of the 18 in
ternational universities that ex
pressed interest in the competition
when it submitted an outline of its
plans for the campus in March.
With over 4,000 tech startups in
Israel, the nation ranks only behind
Silicon Valley in tech innovation, ac

cording to Technion President
Peretz Lavie in the announcement.
The Institute's success has led big
name companies such as Google,
Microsoft and Qualcomm to build
outposts near its Haifa campus in
order to lure new graduates, Lavie
added.
Despite its strong tech back
ground, Technion's status as a pub
lic university makes it unable to
meet the capital demands of build
ing a campus from scratch, Lavie
said in the announcement.
