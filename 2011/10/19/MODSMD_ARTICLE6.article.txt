## Study finds sites leak user information Report attracts media attention nationally 
### SANDY HUANG 
Privacy leaks occur on 185 of the
Internet's top visited websites, ac
cording to a recent study by Stan
ford Law School's Center for Inter
net and Society (CIS). The report
was authored by Jonathan Mayer, a
graduate student in computer sci
ence and at the School of Law. The
report was released last Tuesday at
a conference in Washington, D.C.
hosted by the National Press Club.
Since its release, the report has
attracted the attention of national
media. Mayer wrote in an email to
The Daily that he was not expecting
the amount of press coverage the
study has received.

"We announced our results at
the National Press Club, so we cer
tainly expected some coverage,"
Mayer said. "But what we were pre
senting was already conventional
wisdom among computer security
researchers."

"If anything, I find the coverage
greatly concerning," he continued.
"It reaffirms that there is a sizable
disconnect between business prac
tices and consumer understanding."
In the study, Mayer used a
methodology that was similar to
one developed in a recent paper co
authored by professors at the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
which also showed that online in
formation leakage was a common
occurrence. According to Mayer,
the new study decided to focus on
the identification of the informa
tion leakage and included a greater
number of websites.
