# Study shows gastric bypass surgery may have spillover effects
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
The health benefits to gastric by
pass surgery may extend beyond
those who undergo the procedure,
according to a recent School of Med
icine study. A report published on
Monday in the Archives of Surgery
showed that family members of gas
tric bypass surgery patients were
more likely to lose weight, eat
healthier and exercise more.

The study followed 35 patients
who were about to have the most
common form of gastric bypass sur
gery, called Roux-en-Y, and their
families for a year after the opera
tion. These family members who
included everyone from spouses to
children to extended relatives ac
companied the patient to all clinical
visits, three before the surgery and
five after. During these visits, profes
sionals talked to the entire family
about healthy lifestyle and dietary
habits and helped them set daily
goals.

According the study, obese adult
family members weighed on aver
age eight pounds less than at the be
ginning of the study, dropping from
234 to 226 pounds and losing almost
three percent of their starting body
weight. The effect was less notice
able among non-obese family mem
bers, who dropped on average from
180 to 176 pounds.
The report compared these num
bers to obese women on medically
supervised diets, such as Atkins or
Ornish, whose participants demon
strate an average loss of 2 to 5 per
cent of their body weight over a year
period.
Authors of study included associ
ate professor of surgery John Mor
ton, assistant professor of surgery
Tina Hernandez-Boussard and for
mer Stanford medical students
Gavitt Woodard, Tina Hernandez-
Boussard and Joe Peraza.
Morton said in a Medical School
statement that the study emphasizes
that social forces can be responsible
for changes in lifestyle behavior.
"Can you imagine if every one of
these bariatric [or weight-loss] pa
tients were an ambassador for good
health?" Morton said. "You would
have a huge, grassroots movement
with bariatric surgery providing a
vehicle for healthy change for pa
tient and family alike."
