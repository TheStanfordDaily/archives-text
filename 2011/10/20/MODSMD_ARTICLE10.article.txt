## TREND SAVING THE 'FUZZY' Pushing a new image for humanities in an engineer s world 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
Techie or fuzzy? It's a de
ceptively innocent ques
tion, but on a campus in
the heart of Silicon Valley,
the voices of the humani
ties can easily be lost in the technical

buzz and clamor of industry.
According to Debra Satz, senior
associate dean for the humanities and
the arts, the decline in humanities en
rollment has been a long and endur
ing trend, and Stanford programs are
determined to reverse it.

The steady decline in the human
ities can be traced back to as far as
the 1960s and 70s. For Stanford, the

60s were the golden age for humani
ties more than a third of the stu
dents majored in the area. Fifty years
later, while enrollment for science
and engineering classes have grown
tremendously, humanities enroll
ment continues to slip.
"About 17 percent of students at
Stanford major in the humanities,"
Satz wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We have a declining number of stu
dents taking classes in the humani
ties beyond the mandated require
ments like IHUM."

Stanford's flagging numbers in
the humanities are an anomaly in the
United States. According to a survey
conducted by the American Acade
my of Arts & Sciences, the number of
humanities bachelor's degrees has
actually experienced healthy growth
over the last decade after experienc
ing a slight depression.
Some argue that the strength of
the humanities at least in the eyes
of the public is simply dwarfed in
comparison to the gargantuan sci

ence and engineering departments.
"Stanford has an image prob
lem," said professor of classics
Richard Martin. "People think of it
as MIT West, so those who are inter
ested in medieval history or Islamic
studies don't apply here."
One factor contributing to the
perception of Stanford as "the holy
land of technology" so dubbed by
medieval history professor Philippe
Buc may come from the relative
ly small percentage of admits inter
ested in the humanities.
The cultivation of a "techie"-driv
en reputation, in theory, results in a
self-selecting applicant pool that
leans heavily toward science and en
gineering.
"About the same number of our
incoming admits say that they are in
terested in the humanities," Satz
said. "Our applicant pool looks
roughly like our admit pool in terms
of humanities interest."
On top of having only a modest
number of humanities-inclined in

coming students, humanities depart
ments are also faced with the all-fa
miliar force of parental pressure to
pick the "right" major.

"I've seen firsthand the kind of
culture that quickly develops ... the
peer and parental pressure that
pushes students into supposedly 'vo
cational' majors," wrote English De
partment Chair Gavin Jones in an
email to The Daily.
Given that the lifetime earnings
of science and engineering majors
are significantly higher than those of
humanities majors, the desire for fi
nancial stability is not completely
unfounded. But Martin warns stu
dents against drawing the conclusion
that a humanities degree is equitable
to financial self-destruction.

"We need to wean people from
the idea that humanities are not use
ful," Martin said. "You can do a liber
al arts degree and still get a job. And
I don't mean like working in a library

or going to grad school and wasting
five years of your life."
With declining student interest,
humanities departments have been
forced to adopt a number of strate
gies to defend the value of their re
spective fields and market them to
students.
"Professors don't like to deal
with the idea of having to market
their field," Martin said. "But hu
manities are pushed into that posi
tion. We're fighting an anti-intellec
tual and vocational mentality."

Classics has been one of the few
humanities departments that have
experienced a slow but steady
growth, at least partially thanks to
aggressive advertising and a strong
presence in IHUM and freshman
Introductory Seminars. Classics also
invested a significant amount of
time developing an appealing cur
riculum. It includes a series of entry
level classes such as classical
mythology, which are designed to
attract a broad range of students,
and brings in senior faculty mem
bers to teach classes with low enroll
ment.

"The hardest sell is Intro to
Greek, which usually attracts 15 to
20 students," Martin said. "We sup
port their interest they're getting
our most seasoned professors."
Other departments, such as
Comparative Literature, have
adopted similar tactics in an effort
to make their respective fields more
salient to an increasingly technolo
gy-oriented society.
For instance. Amir Eshel, chair of
undergraduate studies, comparative
literature will be teaching a seminar
titled "Narrative and Ethics," which
will look at not only traditional
forms of literature but also films, tel

evision shows and video games as
mediums for exploring storytelling.
"The insight we gained in hu
manities over millennia ... we can
apply those skills to look at shows
like 'BaUlestar Galactica,' or 'Dex
ter' or 'The Wire,"' Eshel said.
"These shows touch upon issues like
drug addiction, role of the media,
corruption issues that are very
relevant to this world."

Other departments are also
working to throw off the assump
tion that humanities are entrenched
in the past.
For instance, the Department of
History developed a series of inter
disciplinary tracks specially de
signed to guide students' academic
interests towards a specific career
path. Their newest track, "Global
Affairs and World History," is
geared toward students who seek to
apply their history studies towards a
career in government, business and
non-governmental organizations.
"Acquiring deep knowledge
about multiple parts of the globe,
learning to ask probing questions
and construct arguments, evaluating
evidence and writing and speaking
effectively are all timeless skills in a
globalizing world," wrote History
Department Chair Karen Wigen in
an email to The Daily.

With the advancements in tech
nology leading to globalization, hu
manities departments also see an
opportunity to take the skillsets
their students develop and apply
them in a more pragmatic setting.
"[Societies] change and develop,
but we're constantly going back to
the languages," said Gabriella Safran,
chair of the Division of Literatures,
Cultures and Languages (DLCL).
"Students need real literacy and real

fluency. Students need to understand
just how important it is to become
multilingual and global citizens."
Confronted with declining en
rollment in foreign language classes
beyond the second year, the DLCL
launched a new program that will
provide funding to any students
majoring or minoring in any de
partment under the DLCL to go
abroad and conduct research, a
move that Safran hopes will en
courage students to take more ad
vanced language classes.
"Our mission is to get half of
Stanford students to minor in a
modern language," she said.
Other departments such as Eng
lish are optimistic that restructuring
and developing new curriculum will
bolster student enthusiasm while
showcasing its versatility in other
disciplines.
"We can't wave a magic wand,"
Jones said. "But we can think about
offering a course on Harry Potter,
or on new media, or on environ
mental writing, or in the medical
humanities."

The concerted efforts of the hu
manities departments to add a fresh
and interdisciplinary focus to their
curriculums will hopefully dispel
the pervasive conception that the
Stanford students' academic inter
ests are bifurcated into either the
humanities or engineering.
The fuzzy-techie divide is "a
myth that's been made real," Mar
tin said. "Not only is it really de
meaning to 'the fuzzy side,' but it's
just an excuse for one side not to
[have anything to] do with the
other."

associate dean for the humanities and
the arts, the decline in humanities en
rollment has been a long and endur
ing trend, and Stanford programs are
determined to reverse it.

The steady decline in the human
ities can be traced back to as far as
the 1960s and 70s. For Stanford, the

60s were the golden age for humani
ties more than a third of the stu
dents majored in the area. Fifty years
later, while enrollment for science
and engineering classes have grown
tremendously, humanities enroll
ment continues to slip.
"About 17 percent of students at
Stanford major in the humanities,"
Satz wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We have a declining number of stu
dents taking classes in the humani
ties beyond the mandated require
ments like IHUM."

Stanford's flagging numbers in
the humanities are an anomaly in the
United States. According to a survey
conducted by the American Acade
my of Arts & Sciences, the number of
humanities bachelor's degrees has
actually experienced healthy growth
over the last decade after experienc
ing a slight depression.
Some argue that the strength of
the humanities at least in the eyes
of the public is simply dwarfed in
comparison to the gargantuan sci

ence and engineering departments.
"Stanford has an image prob
lem," said professor of classics
Richard Martin. "People think of it
as MIT West, so those who are inter
ested in medieval history or Islamic
studies don't apply here."
One factor contributing to the
perception of Stanford as "the holy
land of technology" so dubbed by
medieval history professor Philippe
Buc may come from the relative
ly small percentage of admits inter
ested in the humanities.
The cultivation of a "techie"-driv
en reputation, in theory, results in a
self-selecting applicant pool that
leans heavily toward science and en
gineering.
"About the same number of our
incoming admits say that they are in
terested in the humanities," Satz
said. "Our applicant pool looks
roughly like our admit pool in terms
of humanities interest."
On top of having only a modest
number of humanities-inclined in

coming students, humanities depart
ments are also faced with the all-fa
miliar force of parental pressure to
pick the "right" major.

"I've seen firsthand the kind of
culture that quickly develops ... the
peer and parental pressure that
pushes students into supposedly 'vo
cational' majors," wrote English De
partment Chair Gavin Jones in an
email to The Daily.
Given that the lifetime earnings
of science and engineering majors
are significantly higher than those of
humanities majors, the desire for fi
nancial stability is not completely
unfounded. But Martin warns stu
dents against drawing the conclusion
that a humanities degree is equitable
to financial self-destruction.

"We need to wean people from
the idea that humanities are not use
ful," Martin said. "You can do a liber
al arts degree and still get a job. And
I don't mean like working in a library


AUBRIE LEE/The Stanford Daily
or going to grad school and wasting
five years of your life."
With declining student interest,
humanities departments have been
forced to adopt a number of strate
gies to defend the value of their re
spective fields and market them to
students.
"Professors don't like to deal
with the idea of having to market
their field," Martin said. "But hu
manities are pushed into that posi
tion. We're fighting an anti-intellec
tual and vocational mentality."

Classics has been one of the few
humanities departments that have
experienced a slow but steady
growth, at least partially thanks to
aggressive advertising and a strong
presence in IHUM and freshman
Introductory Seminars. Classics also
invested a significant amount of
time developing an appealing cur
riculum. It includes a series of entry
level classes such as classical
mythology, which are designed to
attract a broad range of students,
and brings in senior faculty mem
bers to teach classes with low enroll
ment.

"The hardest sell is Intro to
Greek, which usually attracts 15 to
20 students," Martin said. "We sup
port their interest they're getting
our most seasoned professors."
Other departments, such as
Comparative Literature, have
adopted similar tactics in an effort
to make their respective fields more
salient to an increasingly technolo
gy-oriented society.
For instance. Amir Eshel, chair of
undergraduate studies, comparative
literature will be teaching a seminar
titled "Narrative and Ethics," which
will look at not only traditional
forms of literature but also films, tel

evision shows and video games as
mediums for exploring storytelling.
"The insight we gained in hu
manities over millennia ... we can
apply those skills to look at shows
like 'BaUlestar Galactica,' or 'Dex
ter' or 'The Wire,"' Eshel said.
"These shows touch upon issues like
drug addiction, role of the media,
corruption issues that are very
relevant to this world."

Other departments are also
working to throw off the assump
tion that humanities are entrenched
in the past.
For instance, the Department of
History developed a series of inter
disciplinary tracks specially de
signed to guide students' academic
interests towards a specific career
path. Their newest track, "Global
Affairs and World History," is
geared toward students who seek to
apply their history studies towards a
career in government, business and
non-governmental organizations.
"Acquiring deep knowledge
about multiple parts of the globe,
learning to ask probing questions
and construct arguments, evaluating
evidence and writing and speaking
effectively are all timeless skills in a
globalizing world," wrote History
Department Chair Karen Wigen in
an email to The Daily.

With the advancements in tech
nology leading to globalization, hu
manities departments also see an
opportunity to take the skillsets
their students develop and apply
them in a more pragmatic setting.
"[Societies] change and develop,
but we're constantly going back to
the languages," said Gabriella Safran,
chair of the Division of Literatures,
Cultures and Languages (DLCL).
"Students need real literacy and real

fluency. Students need to understand
just how important it is to become
multilingual and global citizens."
Confronted with declining en
rollment in foreign language classes
beyond the second year, the DLCL
launched a new program that will
provide funding to any students
majoring or minoring in any de
partment under the DLCL to go
abroad and conduct research, a
move that Safran hopes will en
courage students to take more ad
vanced language classes.
"Our mission is to get half of
Stanford students to minor in a
modern language," she said.
Other departments such as Eng
lish are optimistic that restructuring
and developing new curriculum will
bolster student enthusiasm while
showcasing its versatility in other
disciplines.
"We can't wave a magic wand,"
Jones said. "But we can think about
offering a course on Harry Potter,
or on new media, or on environ
mental writing, or in the medical
humanities."

The concerted efforts of the hu
manities departments to add a fresh
and interdisciplinary focus to their
curriculums will hopefully dispel
the pervasive conception that the
Stanford students' academic inter
ests are bifurcated into either the
humanities or engineering.
The fuzzy-techie divide is "a
myth that's been made real," Mar
tin said. "Not only is it really de
meaning to 'the fuzzy side,' but it's
just an excuse for one side not to
[have anything to] do with the
other."
