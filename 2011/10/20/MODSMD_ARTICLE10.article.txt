## TREND SAVING THE 'FUZZY' Pushing a new image for humanities in an engineer s world 
### JENNY THAI DESK EDITOR 
Techie or fuzzy? It's a de
ceptively innocent ques
tion, but on a campus in
the heart of Silicon Valley,
the voices of the humani
ties can easily be lost in the technical

buzz and clamor of industry.
According to Debra Satz, senior
associate dean for the humanities and
the arts, the decline in humanities en
rollment has been a long and endur
ing trend, and Stanford programs are
determined to reverse it.

The steady decline in the human
ities can be traced back to as far as
the 1960s and 70s. For Stanford, the

60s were the golden age for humani
ties more than a third of the stu
dents majored in the area. Fifty years
later, while enrollment for science
and engineering classes have grown
tremendously, humanities enroll
ment continues to slip.
"About 17 percent of students at
Stanford major in the humanities,"
Satz wrote in an email to The Daily.
"We have a declining number of stu
dents taking classes in the humani
ties beyond the mandated require
ments like IHUM."

Stanford's flagging numbers in
the humanities are an anomaly in the
United States. According to a survey
conducted by the American Acade
my of Arts & Sciences, the number of
humanities bachelor's degrees has
actually experienced healthy growth
over the last decade after experienc
ing a slight depression.
Some argue that the strength of
the humanities at least in the eyes
of the public is simply dwarfed in
comparison to the gargantuan sci

ence and engineering departments.
"Stanford has an image prob
lem," said professor of classics
Richard Martin. "People think of it
as MIT West, so those who are inter
ested in medieval history or Islamic
studies don't apply here."
One factor contributing to the
perception of Stanford as "the holy
land of technology" so dubbed by
medieval history professor Philippe
Buc may come from the relative
ly small percentage of admits inter
ested in the humanities.
The cultivation of a "techie"-driv
en reputation, in theory, results in a
self-selecting applicant pool that
leans heavily toward science and en
gineering.
"About the same number of our
incoming admits say that they are in
terested in the humanities," Satz
said. "Our applicant pool looks
roughly like our admit pool in terms
of humanities interest."
On top of having only a modest
number of humanities-inclined in

coming students, humanities depart
ments are also faced with the all-fa
miliar force of parental pressure to
pick the "right" major.

"I've seen firsthand the kind of
culture that quickly develops ... the
peer and parental pressure that
pushes students into supposedly 'vo
cational' majors," wrote English De
partment Chair Gavin Jones in an
email to The Daily.
Given that the lifetime earnings
of science and engineering majors
are significantly higher than those of
humanities majors, the desire for fi
nancial stability is not completely
unfounded. But Martin warns stu
dents against drawing the conclusion
that a humanities degree is equitable
to financial self-destruction.

"We need to wean people from
the idea that humanities are not use
ful," Martin said. "You can do a liber
al arts degree and still get a job. And
I don't mean like working in a library
