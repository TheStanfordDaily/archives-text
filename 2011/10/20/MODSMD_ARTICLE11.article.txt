## Hum Bio hits 40 
### ANDREW DUONG 
When Stanford's Program in Human
Biology (Humßio) was first intro
duced a little over 40 years ago, it
was praised for its uniquely interdis
ciplinary nature one that com
bined the two seemingly disparate areas of social sci
ence and hard science. It was in away revolutionary,
for at the time interdisciplinary programs were few
and far between. Forty years after the first graduat
ing class in the program, the human biology major

has grown to be the largest undergraduate major at
Stanford.
"We try to integrate across multiple disciplines,"
said Carol Boggs, director of the Humßio program.
"Students really understand that this is necessary if
we're going to solve the world's problems."
The Humßio major is rooted in the core, a set of
six classes three science and three social science
that every student in the major must take, usually
in his or her sophomore year.
