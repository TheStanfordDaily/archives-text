## Hum Bio hits 40 
### ANDREW DUONG 
When Stanford's Program in Human
Biology (Humßio) was first intro
duced a little over 40 years ago, it
was praised for its uniquely interdis
ciplinary nature one that com
bined the two seemingly disparate areas of social sci
ence and hard science. It was in away revolutionary,
for at the time interdisciplinary programs were few
and far between. Forty years after the first graduat
ing class in the program, the human biology major

has grown to be the largest undergraduate major at
Stanford.
"We try to integrate across multiple disciplines,"
said Carol Boggs, director of the Humßio program.
"Students really understand that this is necessary if
we're going to solve the world's problems."
The Humßio major is rooted in the core, a set of
six classes three science and three social science
that every student in the major must take, usually
in his or her sophomore year.

"The core is a really big time
commitment," said Jenna Wixon-
Genack 'l2, a student advisor for
the Humßio department.
Boggs described the core more
humorously.
"It's a serious bonding experi
ence," she said with a smile.
Despite the time commitment,
many students find the core a
worthwhile and rewarding experi
ence.

"The core is a very wonderful
learning experience, one that I real
ly enjoyed and one that is somewhat
unique in that it is a very well-con
structed learning experience," said
Wixon-Genack. "It can be a much
more significant experience than
taking just one class."
The major grants students a
great deal of freedom. Students can
choose their own area of concentra
tion, which can cover many topics
including the environment and en
vironmental policy, biomedical sci
ence and brain and behavior.

"It is so flexible by design," said
Cristina Leos 'l3, who worked at the
Stanford Prevention Research Cen
ter last summer. "You could have a
focus on psychology or evolution or
anthropology if you wanted to. It's a
broad scope. It allows people from
different backgrounds to find an
area that they're interested in."
The final component of the
Humßio major is perhaps the most
intriguing one: students are re
quired to participate in an intern
ship that relates to their area of con
centration. These internships com
bine classroom experience with
practical situations, a combination
that can produce incredible experi
ences.

"A couple of years ago I had an

advisee who was one of the three ac
credited members of the delegation
to the UN from Tuvalu he was
able to watch UN security discus
sions in Iraq," Boggs said. "Another
student worked for a Colorado pro
fessional soccer team in the training
room."

Of course many students can
also choose to fulfill the internship
requirement through more tradi
tional means, such as shadowing a
physician or working in a Stanford
laboratory. Nevertheless, each stu
dent gains a unique experience
from his or her work.

Year after year, students contin
ue to declare Humßio as their major
despite the apparent rigor. Perhaps
the most compelling reason for their
decisions is the sense of community
among Humßio students.
"People would much rather
work together to achieve something
rather than work against each other
separately," Wixon-Genack said.
"My [study] group would spend
hours and hours and hours togeth
er," Leos added. "Obviously it was
re ally a tiring experience, but I had a
lot of fun doing it."
As the Humßio program wel
comes the 40th reunion of its first
graduating class, current students,
alumni and faculty gather to cele
brate. Of course, none of it would
have been possible without the ded
icated faculty, according to Wixon-
Genack.

"The professors and the people
who are involved in Humßio and
have made it what it is today have
done a great service to Stanford,"
she said.
