# OPINIONS
## DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF Perfectly imperfect 
### Leslie Brian 
Let me just begin by saying that
this column has been a strug
gle. I literally agonized for
days over the subject matter. Sure, I
had a few ideas, but none of them
seemed good enough or appropri
ately timed for the circumstances of
this particular week. Body paint
ing? Too trite. Reunion Homecom
ing? Way too obvious. Lemon zest?
(Yes, that was an option for this
week's column.) Too obscure. I sat
and waited for inspiration to de
scend upon me in a golden haze. I
took long walks, hoping my "Eure
ka!" moment would come some
where between Alvarado and
Gerona. Not one bit.

The column you're reading now
is not the original version. My previ
ous draft was demolished when Mi
crosoft Word shut down unexpect
edly just as I was hitting the save
button which, as a side note,
wouldn't have happened if I had
been working on my laptop, but
that's been in the shop for a week
after I splashed water all over its
logic board. Could I do nothing
right this week? Could nothing hap
pen in my favor? I felt like throwing
my hands up and screaming, "I give
up, okay!" Obviously, it's just not
meant to happen.
So, sighing, I picked up the
phone, cancelled the hair appoint
ment I've been meaning to have for
the past seven months (by God, this
will happen at some point!), paid
the cancellation fee and started to
write. Originally, I was going to try
and redo the column from memory,
but something made me stop.
I was trying too hard to make
this the "perfect" column. All those
times I had dismissed my ideas be
cause they weren't exactly the right
fit for this week had no bearing on
the merit of the ideas themselves,
but more about my insecurity over
how people might perceive them.
Deep down, I think I was scared
that people would judge me for
what I considered important
enough to write about. In trying to
write a column for someone else, I
had second-guessed myself and lost
my own voice.

We all want to control what peo
ple think of us and whether they
like us. And when things don't work
out whether that's in a relation
ship, an assignment, a project or just
life in general I, at least, blame it
on my own actions or lack thereof.
"If only I had tried that much hard
er, said something else or acted dif
ferently . . . "Things could have
been different. More aptly, I could
have made things different.
But that's all a fallacy. There is
only so much we can do in order to
change or control the situation. I'm
definitely not advocating a passive
approach to life, but sometimes, life
throws you a curveball that you
couldn't have predicted. Nothing

you could have done would have
changed the situation, so why sec
ond-guess yourself to begin with?
Over-thinking is just your inse
curity talking. Acting is your confi
dence talking. Do what feels right in
the moment. Nothing is wrong with
believing in your own voice and fol
lowing your own ideas. Trying to
craft something in the hopes that
another person will like it ultimate
ly leaves you feeling empty and un
satisfied. There is no such thing as
the "perfect" column. There's no
such thing as the "perfect" schedule
or the "perfect" day or the "perfect"
routine. As much as we all want a
semblance of control over our lives,
there's a certain amount of uncer
tainty that we all need to accept in
life.

This whole week has been an ex
ercise in (im)perfection for me.
Nothing seemed to go right. But
that doesn't mean it was all a waste.
How you react to a situation mat
ters so much more than how you try
to preempt it. Because more often
than not, things don't go as planned,
no matter how much you may have
tried to manipulate the outcome.
And sometimes, what we see as im
perfect may just end up being the
best thing that happens to us.

Leslie seriously wants to talk to
someone about lemon zest. If that's
your thing, then you should email her
at labrian@stanford.edu.

Howyoureacttoa
situation matters so
much more than how
you try to preempt it.
Because more often
than not, things dorit
go as planned.
