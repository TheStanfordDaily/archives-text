# Do's AND Doo-Doo's
## Breaking the Stanford Bubble! 
### Chase Ishii 
Here's this week's hot advice!

DO: Break the Stanford Bubble,
DOO-DOO: Poop in someone
else's toilet...

I trekked across the Bay to
spend a night in the fascinating
world of Berkeley last weekend.
Now before you sharpie "traitor"
over my face, burn the newspaper
and piss on the ashes. (I'm not sure
what the equivalent of disrespectful
vandalism would be for Internet
readers. Maybe turn me into a
"WTF?!?!" gif?),please allow me to
make my view of Berkeley perfect
ly clear. I hate the school of Berke
ley, but I rather enjoy the city of
Berkeley. (To be honest, I don't re
ally hate Berkeley minus the un
speakable 2009 Big Game, But I am
trying to encourage a healthy rival
ry. So ... suck it, Cal.)
Some of my high school friends
from the L.A. area had traveled up
for USC's Weekender game against
Cal, so I hopped on CalTrain to
BART for a mini reunion. (You may
be wondering where my reluctant
cheering landed for such a game,
considering I have an honest dislike
for all things USC. I was cheering
for some anomaly in our logical uni
verse to emerge, allowing both
teams to lose. The same thing I
cheer for whenever the Yankees
play the Red Sox.)
We had a party at my friend's
house off campus, and it was ex
tremely enjoyable. I got to catch up
with old friends. I got to meet boat
people from all over California who
were there for some giant sailing
race called a "regatta." I mistook re
gatta for ricotta, so when they kept
saying, "I drove here from San
Diego for the regatta," I kept look
ing around the house for some

amazing Italian cheese that was ap
parently worth a seven-hour drive.
But the highlight of my night was
hands-down getting to crack the
case of The Poop Intruders (aka the
Dookie Duo)! (Those of you that
have emailed me complaining
about the lack of poop jokes in a
column titled "Doo-Doo's," well,
this dump's for you.) Apparently
two girls had drunkenly broken into
the Cal women's soccer team's
house next door (while they were
inside), locked the soccer team out
of their own bathroom and then es
caped out the window to find the
refuge of anonymity in our party
filled with random boat people.
The soccer girls were furious and
threatened to call the cops on the
party if the situation wasn't rectified
(more like rectum-fied ... lolz!). A
few of us went back to their house
with the intent of climbing back
through the window and unlocking
the door, hoping that would be the
end of things. But once in the bath
room, shit hit the fan. Literally. (Just
kidding, not literally. But that
would've been awesome.) The two
intruders had left a message ... in
the form of a rather large dookie
floating in the middle of the bowl. A
senseless crime? Perhaps. A scent
less crime? By no means.
The party became a witch-hunt.
My friends and I had some fun pop
ping up in various areas around the
room and proudly proclaiming in
our best Spartacus voice, "I am the
pooper!" The whole ordeal turned
into a bizarre and unforgettable
night, and it only could have hap
pened because of my journey to
Berkeley.
One of the best ways to get the
most out of your Stanford experi
ence is to get away from Stanford.
(It's paradoxical, so it must be true!)

Get off campus, if possible, on a reg
ular basis.

"But, Chase, there's always
something going on here. I love it
here. Why would I want to leave?"
Because Stanford is not the real
world. Part of the college experi
ence is preparing for the real world,
and this is not the real world. Mini
mum wage isn't eleven dollars an
hour. There isn't as much apprecia
tion or tolerance for diversity. There
are people that may have never
heard of your major (I'm looking at
you, Symbolic Systems). The real
world isn't seen through cardinal
colored glasses.

But the real world is a lot more
interesting. There's a Stanford bub
ble that we are well aware of. When
I go to shows in San Francisco once
a month, there's an emo/hardcore
music bubble to explore.There's an
other at my church in Menlo Park
every Sunday. And another down
south at UC-Santa Cruz. There's an
entire exciting world to explore and
interesting people to meet, but it re
quires getting away from Stanford.

Most of us are here at Stanford
because we intend to change the
world in some way or another, but
that requires being part of that
world. That requires breaking the
Stanford Bubble.

If you need a reason or excuse to get
off campus (especially if you're a cute
girl and want to get dinner), email

teams to lose. The same thing I
cheer for whenever the Yankees
play the Red Sox.)
We had a party at my friend's
house off campus, and it was ex
tremely enjoyable. I got to catch up
with old friends. I got to meet boat
people from all over California who
were there for some giant sailing
race called a "regatta." I mistook re
gatta for ricotta, so when they kept
saying, "I drove here from San
Diego for the regatta," I kept look
ing around the house for some

amazing Italian cheese that was ap
parently worth a seven-hour drive.
But the highlight of my night was
hands-down getting to crack the
case of The Poop Intruders (aka the
Dookie Duo)! (Those of you that
have emailed me complaining
about the lack of poop jokes in a
column titled "Doo-Doo's," well,
this dump's for you.) Apparently
two girls had drunkenly broken into
the Cal women's soccer team's
house next door (while they were
inside), locked the soccer team out
of their own bathroom and then es
caped out the window to find the
refuge of anonymity in our party
filled with random boat people.
The soccer girls were furious and
threatened to call the cops on the
party if the situation wasn't rectified
(more like rectum-fied ... lolz!). A
few of us went back to their house
with the intent of climbing back
through the window and unlocking
the door, hoping that would be the
end of things. But once in the bath
room, shit hit the fan. Literally. (Just
kidding, not literally. But that
would've been awesome.) The two
intruders had left a message ... in
the form of a rather large dookie
floating in the middle of the bowl. A
senseless crime? Perhaps. A scent
less crime? By no means.
The party became a witch-hunt.
My friends and I had some fun pop
ping up in various areas around the
room and proudly proclaiming in
our best Spartacus voice, "I am the
pooper!" The whole ordeal turned
into a bizarre and unforgettable
night, and it only could have hap
pened because of my journey to
Berkeley.
One of the best ways to get the
most out of your Stanford experi
ence is to get away from Stanford.
(It's paradoxical, so it must be true!)

Get off campus, if possible, on a reg
ular basis.

"But, Chase, there's always
something going on here. I love it
here. Why would I want to leave?"
Because Stanford is not the real
world. Part of the college experi
ence is preparing for the real world,
and this is not the real world. Mini
mum wage isn't eleven dollars an
hour. There isn't as much apprecia
tion or tolerance for diversity. There
are people that may have never
heard of your major (I'm looking at
you, Symbolic Systems). The real
world isn't seen through cardinal
colored glasses.

But the real world is a lot more
interesting. There's a Stanford bub
ble that we are well aware of. When
I go to shows in San Francisco once
a month, there's an emo/hardcore
music bubble to explore.There's an
other at my church in Menlo Park
every Sunday. And another down
south at UC-Santa Cruz. There's an
entire exciting world to explore and
interesting people to meet, but it re
quires getting away from Stanford.

Most of us are here at Stanford
because we intend to change the
world in some way or another, but
that requires being part of that
world. That requires breaking the
Stanford Bubble.

If you need a reason or excuse to get
off campus (especially if you're a cute
girl and want to get dinner), email
