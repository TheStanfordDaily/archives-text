# STUDENT LIFE
## Stanford combats SOPHOMORE SLUMP 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
While the Sophomore Celebration has
been a tradition at Stanford for the past 12
years, an increasing number of universi
ties across the nation are beginning to
hold similar ceremonies for their sec
ond-year students in an effort to
combat the "sophomore slump."
Sophomore slump is a phe
nomenon in which students in
their second year of college
struggle academically com
pared to their freshman year.
Nearly one quarter of all
sophomore college students
are affected by the slump, ac
cording to a study by higher
education professor Laurie
Schreiner at Azusa Pacific
University.
While opinion remains divid
ed on the extent to which the
slump phenomenon prevails at
Stanford, most sophomores
noted a significant transition
between campus life in their
freshman and sophomore
years.
"Sophomore slump is an
actual thing because people go
from their excited freshman
dorms with open doors ... to
sophomore dorms or upper
class dorms," said Eric Yurko
'l3. "You're with your friends,
but so is everyone else.They're
not really super interested in
making friends."
Sophomore Celebra
tion was the first event in
a planned series of
sophomore-oriented oc
casions and was attended
by approximately half of
the Class of 2014. Co-Presi
dent Dhruv Amin 'l4 noted
that this year's sophomore class gov
ernment sought to expand the pro
gramming available to the Class of
2014 in order to combat the slump.
According to Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS) director Dr. Ron Albuch
er, sophomore usage of university counseling services
does increase compared to freshman year. However, Dr.
Albucher indicated that this increase is not related to the
sophomore slump, nor the transition between freshman
and sophomore year.
Academically too, the change can be abrupt. In partic

ular, sophomores who may have pursued a
preconceived career trajectory throughout
their time at university may begin to ques
tion their commitment to their chosen
Ã¼bject as the time to decide their major
.pproaches, according to several academ
ic directors interviewed for this article.
Kristin Black, Academic Director for
foyon, Crothers and Branner, also noted
chat since "all parts of life [at Stanford] are
connected," academic and social problems alike
can spread to other parts of students' lives.
"One possibility as to why [sophomore slump]
is occurring is that a large number of Stanford stu
dents do an assortment of activities in high school that
have nothing to do with what they are actually interest
ed in, so when they arrive, they may fall into a similar pat
tern until they realize Stanford is no longer high
school," said Michael Silverman 'l3.
The student government has sought to
maintain and expand the academic sup
port system available to sophomores, of
fering an Academic Advising Initiative to
promote advisor interaction with seniors
as well as alumni mentoring pro
grams through the Career Devel
opment Center. iDeclare week,
scheduled for winter quarter, of
fers extensive advice for sopho
mores on distinguishing between
majors, exploring their academic
preferences and then choosing
and declaring a major.
Students also noted the positive
aspects of sophomore year. Koren
Bakkegard, associate dean of un
dergraduate advising and re
search, linked the increased
emphasis on class unity
through the 2002 creation
of the Freshman Dean's
Office and the intro
duction of the Sopho
more Celebration
to a stronger class
spirit that is increas
ingly evident in
alumni activity.
"In my opinion, I
feel like the sopho
more slump is something
that affects people who don't make the effort to
meet other people," said Tyler Woods 'l4. "Yes, work
may be harder and you're stressed with finding a major
and getting better grades, but I don't think people
should lose sight of the fact that other things matter in
