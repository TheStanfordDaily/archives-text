## START ME UP AGAIN WOMEN'S TENNIS KICKS OFF NEW SEASON 
### CHRISSY JONES STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team is al
ready back at work, kicking off its 2011-12
campaign this month and rebounding from
a heartbreaking loss to Florida in last year's
NCAA Championship match to start the
year on a good note.

This past weekend, sophomores Eliza
beth Ecker and Amelia Herring, freshman
Ellen Tsay and senior Veronica Li repre
sented the Cardinal in the St. Mary's Invita
tional. The headline of the weekend was
Tsay, the sole freshman on the squad, who
made it all the way to the semifinal round of
the tournament.

"I had a great time because I'm not used
to having teammates pump me up during
and in between my points," Tsay said of her
first college tennis match. "Just hearing
'Hear we go, Card' really boosted my
morale, especially in a tight match."
Tsay cruised through her first round
match, defeating Megan Heneghan of UC-
Davis with ease, 6-1,6-0. Her second match
was closer, as she beat Saint Mary's Jade
Frampton 7-5, 6-2. Tsay won by default in
the quarterfinals, then dropped the first set
against Saint Mary's Jenny Julien 6-4 in the
semifinals, but came back ready to play in
the second set.

"The entire match was up and down,"
Tsay said. "I lost the first set, but in the sec
ond set, I felt I stepped up my game and con
trolled the court."

Tsay rallied from a 4-1 deficit to come
back and take the set 6-4.

"[Julien] became more and more frus
trated in the second set, which allowed me to
get back in it," she said.

It all reversed in the third set, though, as

Tsay fell 7-5 after leading 4-1.
"She regained her confidence and came
back to win," Tsay admitted. "It was a great
experience and could have gone either way.
The main thing is, I'll learn from what I
failed to do, namely closing out the match,
and continue working on my game."
Ecker described the team atmosphere
that Tsay highlighted as a big reason for her
good play this past weekend.
"[Ellen] definitely adds a lot of character
and spunk to the team," Ecker said. "She's
adjusting to college life and the independ
ence that comes with it, as each of us did, so
the team's a great source of support and mo
tivation for her."

Ecker and Herring were both defeated in
the first round of the tournament, and Li
made the round of sixteen. The doubles duo
of Herring and Tsay made the quarterfinals
before defaulting due to Herring suffering
an injury. Regardless of their own results,
Tsay's teammates were all impressed by
how their new freshman played.
"She did such a great job staying calm
and keeping her composure under pressure
in the first match of her college career,"
Ecker said, "and we are all so proud of her."
The weekend prior to St. Mary's Invita
tional, the Cardinal sent junior Mallory Bur
dette, sophomore Nicole Gibbs and junior
Stacey Tan to Pacific Palisades, Calif, to rep
resent the Cardinal in the ITA All-Ameri
can Championships. After losing her first
round singles match to Alabama's Mary
Anne Macfarlane, Burdette flew through
four consolation rounds to capture the con
solation title over Florida's Joanna Mather,
6-1,6-2.
