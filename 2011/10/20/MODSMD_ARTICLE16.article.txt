## Cardinal welcomes new Pac-12 foe 
### GEORGE CHEN 
Both the men and women's
swimming and diving teams are
coming off impressive perform
ances this past weekend as they
prepare to swim against Utah at
the Avery Aquatic Center on
Thursday. The men's team won the
two-day Pacific Invitational de
spite only attending the Saturday
session.

Lots of credit goes to the fresh
man class freshman Jonathan
Edwards won three individual

events and classmates David
Nolan and Eric Peske were among
others who displayed auspicious

men and women's Mountain West

Conference Championship last

about Utah because they just
joined the Pac-12," said freshman
Ethan Hallowell, a specialist in
sprint and mid-distance freestyle
events. "But it's good that we're
competing against them because

we'll see them down the road at the
Pac-12 Championships."
Given that the Pac-12 Champi
onships aren't until February and
the NCAA Championship doesn't
take place until March, early sea
son dual meets may not be the
teams' main concern.

"Right now, we're not too wor
ried about our racing times be
cause it's still early in the season,"
Hallowell added. "We're mainly
focusing on practices, and in that
