# SWIMMING AND DIVING
## Cardinal welcomes new Pac-12 foe 
### GEORGE CHEN 
Both the men and women's
swimming and diving teams are
coming off impressive perform
ances this past weekend as they
prepare to swim against Utah at
the Avery Aquatic Center on
Thursday. The men's team won the
two-day Pacific Invitational de
spite only attending the Saturday
session.

Lots of credit goes to the fresh
man class freshman Jonathan
Edwards won three individual

events and classmates David
Nolan and Eric Peske were among
others who displayed auspicious
early-season speed.
The women's team dominated
their own two-day George Haines
Invitational at home, winning 17
out of the total 21 events. Sopho
more Andie Taylor led the way,
picking up victories in both the
200-meter free and 200-meter fly
by considerable margins.

Utah, the newest member of the
Pac-12, finished fifth at both the
men and women's Mountain West

Conference Championship last
season. In comparison, the Cardi
nal men's and women's teams won
conference titles by sweeping the
tougher 2011 Pac-10 Champi
onships. Utah will be the first Pac
-12 team that the Cardinal swim
mers face.
"We don't know too much
about Utah because they just
joined the Pac-12," said freshman
Ethan Hallowell, a specialist in
sprint and mid-distance freestyle
events. "But it's good that we're
competing against them because

we'll see them down the road at the
Pac-12 Championships."
Given that the Pac-12 Champi
onships aren't until February and
the NCAA Championship doesn't
take place until March, early sea
son dual meets may not be the
teams' main concern.

"Right now, we're not too wor
ried about our racing times be
cause it's still early in the season,"
Hallowell added. "We're mainly
focusing on practices, and in that
respect, we've started out the sea
son really well."
Even with the emphasis on prac
tices, both the men's and women's
teams are undefeated in dual meets
and invites so far this season. The
men's team has dominated Cente
nary College, UC-Santa Cruz and
Hawaii in dual meet situations,
while the women's team downed
San Jose State in a similar fashion.

As for diving, the men's team is
loaded with freshmen talent and

upperclassmen experience. The
Cardinal may have the top two na
tional recruits from last year in
freshmen Kristian Ipsen and Con
nor Kuremsky, who look to be
strong additions to the other five
veteran divers.
The six women divers show
equal promise with one freshman
and four upperclassmen. Sopho
more Stephanie Phipps, who quali
fied for last year's NCAA Champi
onships in the 3-meter, has already
won three straight diving events
this season. The Utes are coming in
with only five divers total, so the
numbers are clearly in the Cardi
nal's favor.

Like their swimming counter

parts, the Cardinal divers are em
phasizing practice, particularly ac
curacy and consistency in routines.
"Right now, we're focusing on
training muscle memory during
practice, which involves repetitions
of simple activities done on land,"
Kuremsky said." [Head coach Rick]
Schavone wants us to be able to
'dive stupid' by the end of season,
meaning that we won't even have to
think about the dives as we're exe
cuting them."

The Cardinal swimmers and
divers host Utah this Thursday at 1
p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
