This weekend will be a change of pace for the
Stanford men's water polo team, which is coming
off its first loss of the conference season last week
end to UCLA and dropped out of the top spot in
the national rankings to number three. The Cardi
nal (9-3, 2-1 MPSF) opens up a long weekend on
Friday night with a visit to Stockton Calif., where it
will face No. 6 Pacific.

It won't end there, however, as Stanford then
has four more games over the weekend, all at Santa
Clara against teams from the East Coast on Sat
urday the Card faces Bucknell and Harvard, fol
lowed by Brown and Air Force on Sunday.
Stanford previously faced Pacific at the NorCal
Invitational in the team's first weekend of the sea
son, knocking off the Tigers 9-8 in overtime. The
Cardinal's overtime win against Pacific was fol
lowed by losses to USC and California in the semi
finals and the third-place game, respectively
since then, Stanford has beaten both USC and Cal.
Still, Pacific boasts a very formidable offense,
and Stanford should expect a tough game.
"They have one of the best 2-meters in the
country and some very good outside shooters,"
said redshirt junior driver Travis Noll in reference
to Balazs Erdelyi, who leads the team with 35
goals and was last year's MPSF Newcomer of the
