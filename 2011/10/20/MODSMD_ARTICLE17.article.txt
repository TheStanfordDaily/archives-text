# NO EASY REBOUND AHEAD

### DAVID PEREZ 
This weekend will be a change of pace for the
Stanford men's water polo team, which is coming
off its first loss of the conference season last week
end to UCLA and dropped out of the top spot in
the national rankings to number three. The Cardi
nal (9-3, 2-1 MPSF) opens up a long weekend on
Friday night with a visit to Stockton Calif., where it
will face No. 6 Pacific.

It won't end there, however, as Stanford then
has four more games over the weekend, all at Santa
Clara against teams from the East Coast on Sat
urday the Card faces Bucknell and Harvard, fol
lowed by Brown and Air Force on Sunday.
Stanford previously faced Pacific at the NorCal
Invitational in the team's first weekend of the sea
son, knocking off the Tigers 9-8 in overtime. The
Cardinal's overtime win against Pacific was fol
lowed by losses to USC and California in the semi
finals and the third-place game, respectively
since then, Stanford has beaten both USC and Cal.
Still, Pacific boasts a very formidable offense,
and Stanford should expect a tough game.
"They have one of the best 2-meters in the
country and some very good outside shooters,"
said redshirt junior driver Travis Noll in reference
to Balazs Erdelyi, who leads the team with 35
goals and was last year's MPSF Newcomer of the

The rest of the weekend will
provide a different kind of test for
the Cardinal. Games against teams
from the other side of the country
are generally rare for Stanford
since the top collegiate water polo
teams are concentrated on the
West Coast.

In fact, no team from the East
Coast has ever made it to the cham
pionship game of the NCAA Tour
nament, and in its only other game
against an East Coast team this
year, Stanford knocked off No. 16
Princeton in a 14-3 landslide.

With that said, playing five
games in a weekend is sure to be
grueling. The players seem up to the
task, though.
"We have been grinding in prac
tice the last couple of weeks, and I
think everyone is in peak condition
to play optimally this weekend,"
Noll said.

Bucknell is the highest ranked
among the four eastern teams at No.
15, but each team would love to
spring a big upset to define their
season.

One factor that will be an advan
tage for Stanford is the tremendous
depth of this year's squad. The Car
dinal has routinely used a rotation
of 12 or 13 players this year, and this
weekend might be a chance to ex
pand that even more.
"Assuming we take care of busi
ness early on in the game, it might be
a good chance for other players to
get some good playing time," Noll
said.

But Stanford is not letting itself
look too far ahead into the week
end.

"We are concentrating on the
first game in practice all week," Noll
said. "Because that is a conference
game, but we don't want to get
ahead of ourselves."

The two key Stanford players to
look at in that game will be fresh
man utility Alex Bowen and junior
two-meter Forrest Watkins.

Bowen is the Cardinal's leading
scorer this season, and as if that was
not enough for him to draw a lot of
attention from the Tigers, he also

scored five goals against them in
their previous meeting.
Still, if you ask any of the players
on this team, it is not their offense
they have to worry about.

"The reason for our losses have
been defensive breakdowns, not be
cause of our offense," said Noll.
Because of this, Watkins' contri
butions may be even more impor
tant to the outcome of the game. He
is Stanford's top 2-meter defender,
which means he will be pitted
against Pacific's All-American jun
ior center Goran Tomasevic for
most of the contest.
The Cardinal starts its weekend
at Pacific on Friday at 3 p.m., then
returns to the Bay Area to take on
Bucknell and Harvard on Saturday.
The weekend concludes with
matches against Brown and Air
Force on Sunday.
