# Who should you root for now?
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
By the time you read this
column, game one of the
World Series will already
be in the books, but
chances are you didn't
watch it anyway.
In this non-coastal Fall Classic, plen
ty of fans are going to tune out due to
the fact that the Yankees, Phillies and
Red Sox are sitting at home drinking
beer and eating fried chicken right now.
And while those teams carry some of
the biggest fan bases with them, they
also inspire a lot of people to watch
games strictly to root against them.
Neither the Rangers nor the Cardi
nals inspire the same kind of hate re
served for those big-money teams, so
who should you, the fan with no root
ing interest, cheer for in this World Se
ries reserved for teams from states that
border my home state of Arkansas?
I've provided a few reasons for each
team just ahead.
Reasons to root for the Cardinals:
1. Albert Pujols: He is the best play
er in baseball, and he puts on a prom
for kids with Down Syndrome every
year. There's no reason not to like this
future first-ballot Hall of Famer unless
you're one of the teams that he's dom
inated over the years.
2. America: The Cardinals' center
fielder is named Jon Jay, and if you
know your American history, you'll re
call that John Jay was a signer of the
Declaration of Independence and the
first Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States. Is this a ten
uous reason to root for a team? Yes.
But I'm willing to bet that it's the rea
son why history professor Jack
Rakove, a Cubs fan, will be rooting for
the Cardinals.
3. Jonah Keri:This writer for ESPN
spinoff website Grantland has a little
crush on the Rangers; as in, he will not
stop writing about the Rangers. Why is
this a reason not to root for Texas? Be
cause if Texas wins, Keri will probably
want to write another book like his
sloppy, boring tome on the rise of the
Tampa Bay Rays, "The Extra Two Per
cent: How Wall Street Strategies Took
a Major League Baseball Team from
Worst to First." If you're a fan of well
written books, you should probably
root for the Cards.

4. Cardinal: Because if you have to
pick a reason, "OMG we are the same
color almost" is probably as good as

any other.
Reasons to root for the Rangers:
1. Partying: Ron Washington and
Josh Hamilton have both dabbled with
some special substances in the past,
and anyone who likes to throw down a
little bit should definitely feel a connec
tion to the kindred spirits wearing red,
white and blue.

2. Diversity: The Rangers have
players from Japan, Cuba, the Domini
can Republic, Venezuela and Missis

sippi. Hooray for tolerance!
3. Tony La Russa: Don't like
PETA? La Russa was nominated for
PETA's "Sexiest Vegetarian" in 2007.
Don't like drunk driving? La Russa
was arrested for DUI back in 2007
(apparently that was a bad year for
him). Against Arizona's SB 1070 bill?
Tony expressed support for the bill
back in 2010. Don't like communica
ble disease? La Russa contracted shin
gles in 2011. Do yourself a favor and
do not Google image search "Tony La
Russa shingles."He's also a whiner.All
compelling reasons to root for the
Rangers, right?
4. The Underdog factor: The Car
dinals have won 10 World Series al
ready. That's the second-most in base
ball history behind the Yankees.
They're an established franchise.
They have real, time-honored rival
ries. So far, the Rangers are mostly fa
mous for dumping tons of money into
'raided out dudes like Alex Ro
driguez, Jose Canseco, Rafael

Palmiero and Sammy Sosa. They've
come from being one of the bottom
dweller of the American League to a
back-to-back AL champ. Don't jump
on the Cardinals' bandwagon. The
Rangers deserve your love.
So there you have it, four reasons to
consider supporting each of these
teams, with some being helpful and
some being not so helpful. If I've failed
to sway you towards either side, I en
courage you to tune in anyhow
baseball is the best way to pass the
week between football games. And all
you Yankees, Sox, Giants and Phils
fans, just remember: only 116 days until
Spring Training!

Jack Blanchat hopes you 're impressed
with his efforts at fairness and political
correctness. As a big-time Rangers
fan, it took every ounce of his inner
southern gentleman. Get ready for
