# Who should you root for now?

### Jack Blanchat 
By the time you read this
column, game one of the
World Series will already
be in the books, but
chances are you didn't
watch it anyway.
In this non-coastal Fall Classic, plen
ty of fans are going to tune out due to
the fact that the Yankees, Phillies and
Red Sox are sitting at home drinking
beer and eating fried chicken right now.
And while those teams carry some of
the biggest fan bases with them, they
also inspire a lot of people to watch
games strictly to root against them.

Declaration of Independence and the
first Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States. Is this a ten
uous reason to root for a team? Yes.
But I'm willing to bet that it's the rea

Rakove, a Cubs fan, will be rooting for
the Cardinals.
3. Jonah Keri:This writer for ESPN
spinoff website Grantland has a little
crush on the Rangers; as in, he will not
stop writing about the Rangers. Why is
this a reason not to root for Texas? Be
cause if Texas wins, Keri will probably
want to write another book like his
sloppy, boring tome on the rise of the
Tampa Bay Rays, "The Extra Two Per
