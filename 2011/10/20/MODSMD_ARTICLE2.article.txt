# Alpine Trail debate mounts
## San Mateo County to vote on Stanford offer for trail 
### ILEAN A NAJARRO 
San Mateo County supervisors vote Nov. 1 on whether
to accept Stanford's $10.2 million offer to repair the 1.8-
mile stretch of the Lower Alpine Road Trail and complete
a decade-long project detained by conflicting residential
opinions.

Officials have until Dec. 31 of this year to accept the
fund. If they refuse the offer, the funds will go to Santa
Clara County for recreational activities for Stanford resi
dents.

The full Alpine Road trail extends from the corner of El
Camino Real and Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto to a mile
into Portola Valley and includes a portion of the Stanford
Loop trail. The plans to build the trail network stem from
agreements in Stanford's 2000 General Use Permit with

San Mateo County is debating whether to accept Stanford's $10.2 million offer to repair the Lower Alpine Road Trail, which extends
from the corner of El Camino Real and Sand Hill Road to a mile into Portola Valley and includes a portion of Stanford Loop trail.
Santa Clara County. As part of the
deal, the University agreed to build
a pair of recreational trails worth
$l9 million from the campus to the
surrounding foothills in return for
permission to add five million
square feet of new buildings on
campus. The trail through San
Mateo County property runs along
Alpine Road from Ladera to Stan
ford Weekend Acres.

As of now, associate professor of
immunology PJ Utz a resident
of Ladera, one of the San Mateo
communities along the trail de
scribed the condition of the trail as
unsafe for bikers.

Utz said the portions of the trail
that are only two or three feet wide
are at risk of eroding into the creek
separating San Mateo County from
Santa Clara County. Those sections
are also dangerously close to major
freeway ramps.

"The trail as it exists in its cur
rent condition is much too danger
ous to be used by typical commut
ing bikers or certainly my kids and
family," Utz said. "As a taxpayer, as
a parent, as a resident and as a biker
I think that it would be fiscally irre
sponsible for the supervisors to not
take the money and fix the trail."
In addition to voting on Stan
ford's offer to repair the trail, San
Mateo County officials will also
vote on granting the county respon
sibility to design the revamped
trail, conducting an environmental
review and requesting an extension
to complete the remodeling by
Dec. 31.

"For Stanford's part, if Stanford
has to comply with this agreement,
which we said we would in our 2000
agreement, we would like to see the
money go for this purpose because
we do have many people in Ladera
and Weekend Acres that work at
Stanford and [are] alumni... that
it would be worth the restoration,"
said Larry Florton, director of gov
ernment and community relations.
Any improvement to the trail after
ward would be funded by taxes.
From 2000 to 2005, residents of
Ladera, Weekend Acres and other
communities debated the trail's lo
cation, ultimately settling on its
present site. In 2006, Stanford of
fered $8.4 million to San Mateo
County and $2.8 million to Portola
Valley to repair the conditions of
the connector trail. Only Portola
Valley accepted the offer.

Horton attributed San Mateo

County's refusal to internal politi
cal disputes. Utz, who formerly op
posed Stanford's offer, also attrib
uted the hesitation to miscommuni
cation on behalf of residents, who
informed others of false facts relat
ing to the trail's remodeling. The
county refused Stanford's second
offer in 2009 for similar reasons.
However, Stanford's General Use
Permit prevents the county from
fully rejecting the offer that stands
now until Dec. 31.

Horton said that current opposi
tion to the offer also stems from
residents in Weekend Acres who
express legitimate safety concerns
they think will come from the re
modeling, which should not be ig
nored.

"Every safety and traffic issue
asked by Weekend Acres must be
studied in the Environmental Im
pact report according to a particu
lar design and then evaluated,"
Horton said. "I can assure you that
San Mateo County should not ap
prove it if they do not have a design
that is safe and accommodates
those matters."

Utz, who will be a key speaker at
the vote in November, said he is
hopeful for the outcome.
"I think the likely scenario here
is that the supervisors will vote to
agree to have Stanford pay for de
signing the trail and then get public
feedback for what that trail would
look like," Utz said.
