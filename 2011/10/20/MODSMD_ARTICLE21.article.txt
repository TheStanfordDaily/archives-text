## Cardinal baseball releases 2012 schedule 
### â€“ Jack Blanchat 
The Stanford baseball team released its 2012
schedule on Wednesday, posting a slate that features
series against nine teams that played in the College
World Series last season.
After a travel-intensive year in 2011 that included
three straight road trips to start the season, the Cardi
nal has home series against Vanderbilt, Texas, Rice,
Arizona State and California, and doesn't have a sin
gle weekend series away from the West Coast.
Expectations will be high for Stanford this season
after an appearance in the Super Regionals last year,
the Cardinal's first since 2008. After defeating Cal
State Fullerton, Illinois and Kansas State to advance
to the Supers, North Carolina swept the Cardinal in a
best-of-three series to end the season.

Stanford returns its top nine hitters from last sea
son and boasts three potential first-round draft picks
in juniors Mark Appel, Stephen Piscotty and Kenny
Diekroeger.

The Cardinal also returns junior Tyler Gaffney,
who is carrying a 22-game hit streak into 2012, the
longest for a Stanford player since 1988, and sopho
more Brian Ragira, who was last year's Pac-10 Fresh
man of the Year.

On the mound, Stanford will have to answer for
the loss of closer Chris Reed, who was a first-round
pick of the Los Angeles Dodgers in June, as well as the
departures of starters Jordan Pries and Danny Sand
brink and bullpen mainstay Scott Snodgress. Senior
lefthander Brett Mooneyham will return to the line
up after missing all of the 2011 season with a hand in
jury.

Stanford baseball will embark on the 2012 season
starting Friday, Feb. 17 with a three-game series
against Vanderbilt.
