## Palo Alto approves new firefighter contract 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ivy Nguyen 
Sixteen months of negotiations
between the city of Palo Alto and its
firefighters came to a conclusion
Monday night when the Palo Alto
City Council voted unanimously to
ratify a new three-year deal with the
union.

The new contract imposes a sec
ond pension tier for new workers
and requires employees to con
tribute to their pension and medical
costs. The new contract also no
longer includes the minimum
staffing provision, which requires 29
firefighters to be on duty at all
times. Other city labor groups such
as the Service Employees Interna
tional Union, Local 521 and the
non-unionized group of profession
als and managers have also recently
accepted second pension tiers and
requirements to contribute toward
their medical premiums.

The contract's ratification ends
the binding-arbitration process
that began after the city declared
an impasse in negotiations in Feb
ruary. The new concessions will
save the city of Palo Alto approxi
mately $l.l million in the current
fiscal year and $1.4 million annual
ly in future years.
Combined with rising revenues
and savings, the $l.l million in sav
ings negotiated in new contracts
will likely stave off projected per
sonnel cuts for the current fiscal
year, according to the City Council
Finance Committee at its Tuesday
meeting. Revenue from documen
tary-transfer tax and from sales tax
are both up $1.2 million above pro
jections, and hotel taxes have ex
ceeded projections by $600,000.

The removal of the minimum
staffing provision will also allow the
city to save money by reducing Fire
Department staffing. The city's Pol
icy & Services Committee will re
view a more detailed report on ways
to reduce Fire Department staffing
levels in November.
