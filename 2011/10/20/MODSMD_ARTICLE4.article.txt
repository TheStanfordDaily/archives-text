# School of Ed joins STEM initiative
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Josee Smith 
Stanford Teacher Education Pro
gram (STEP) joined a nation-wide
initiative called IOOKinIO, which is
designed to improve the perform
ances of American K-12 students in
science, technology, engineering and
mathematics STEM departments,
according to an announcement from
the School of Education.

The IOOKinIO program hopes to
train 100,000 teachers throughout
the next decade in STEM subjects.

STEP and the School of Educa
tion plan to educate a minimum of
230 STEM teachers to work in ele
mentary schools, middle schools
and high schools throughout the
country. STEP also retains doctor
ate and Ph.D. students in the math
and sciences who will travel to
these schools to act as regulators
and co-teachers in the classrooms.

"Stanford [University] is known
for educating outstanding math
and science teachers," said educa
tion professor Rachel Lotan, direc
tor of STEP. "We are among the
very few university-based pro
grams involved in [the initiative]."

Lotan added that the teachers
involved in this program will be
able to apply their experience to
other nation-wide programs to im
prove the performance of Ameri
can students. In order to achieve
this goal, STEP has developed cri

teria to measure the STEM teach
ers' effectiveness.

Over 80 organizations, in busi
ness and in education, have made
commitments to help recruit and
foster teachers for this initiative.
Nearly $2O million was initially
pledged to IOOKinIO by founda
tions and corporations supporting
the recruitment of STEM teachers.
IOOKinIO was first announced at
the Clinton Global Initiative
America Meeting in Chicago in
2011. There, former President Bill
Clinton urged corporations and
foundations to support the initia
tive. President Barack Obama and
Secretary of Education Arne Dun
can have also praised the program,
encouraging the program's inte
grated strategy.
Currently, the United States is
lagging behind other countries in
the math and sciences, including
China and Finland. IOOKinIO will
prepare, recruit and support
100,000 teachers over the next 10
years to prepare all American stu
dents with the skills needed to excel
in both the sciences and mathemat
ics. By improving education in the
math and sciences, IOOKinIO hopes
to provide students with the tools
needed to solve the nation's current
and predicted problems.
