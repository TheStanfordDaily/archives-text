## Students remain unaware of CAB initiatives 
### MARIANNE LEVINE DESK EDITOR 
Four weeks into autumn quarter, the ASSU's
Community Action Board (CAB) remains in its
"quiet change" stage, according to ASSU Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3.

The ASSU announced the creation of the
CAB spring quarter last year. According to its
blueprint posted on the ASSU website, the
CAB held its first meeting the second week of
school and is currently planning its first campus

wide event to be held during mid November.
The CAB, chaired by Aracely Mondragon
'l3, represents 23 on-campus communities. Ac
cording to the CAB website, the represented
communities for the 2011-12 academic year in
clude the African American Fraternal and
Sororal Association, the API community, the
African American community, the
Chicano/Latino community, the Christian com
munity, the Corporate Diversity Leadership
Coalition, the First Generation and Low-In
come community, the Interfraternal Greek

community, the Interfaith/Religious communi
ty, the Jewish community, the LGBTQ commu
nity, the Multicultural Greek community, the
Muslim community, the Native community, the
Polynesian community, the Power to ACT: Abil
ities Coming Together community, the Student-
Athletes community, the Women's community
and the Undefined/Undetermined community.
Though the CAB does not represent every
community on campus, board representatives
believe the Board's creation is a
step in the right direction.
"There are many communities
on campus and we recognize that
not everyone is represented on the
board," the CAB said in a joint
statement to The Daily. "Thus we
strive to work with existing re
sources that are already aimed at
the entire student body in hopes of
engaging as many students as possi
ble."

The Community Board said that
its primary goals are to align and
work with existing resources on
campus, to streamline communica
tion between communities and
their CAB representatives, to en
courage dialogue within the board
and across campus about the defini
tion of "community," and to in
crease awareness about the differ
ent communities on campus.

According to Michael Cruz 'l2,
ASSU President, the CAB has been
working on "cross-community ini
tiatives and projects within their
community." Cruz cited last week's
Disability Resource Fair as an ex
ample of one of the CAB's initia

tives, describing the event as a
"great success." The CAB hopes
that through its projects and in
creased communication, the Board
will foster greater understanding
and tolerance within the larger
Stanford community.
Many members of the communi
ties represented on the board, when
interviewed by The Daily, knew lit
tle of the board's purpose. Some
were unaware of the board's exis
tence.

"I actually don't know anything
about the ASSU Community Board
besides the fact that it exists, since I
know the representative for the
Christian community personally,"
said Josh Wong 'l4, a member of In
ter Varsity Christian Fellowship. "I
am not aware of any communica
tion yet between the board and
Christian community members. I
doubt most community members
even know about the board at all."

Macgregor-Dennis attributed
this apparent general lack of knowl
edge among students about the
CAB to the fact that the board is
currently working behind the
scenes. He said he expects the board
to launch an outreach initiative
sometime during winter quarter.
