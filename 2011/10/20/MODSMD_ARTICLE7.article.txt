## Achcar discusses MENA revolutions 'Process' critical to reflecting on Middle East revolutions 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Gilbert Achcar, professor of development stud
ies and international relations at the School of Ori
ental and African Studies of the University of Lon
don, delivered a lecture Wednesday evening on the
roots and dynamics of the 2011 revolutionary up
heavals in the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA).

Achcar started the lecture with a presentation
of development data, comparing the MENA re
gion to other developing regions, drawing particu
lar attention to figures on average annual growth
rate, population growth and unemployment rates.
"There is a lack of development even in relative
terms in the region ... the problem translates
above all in the region in record unemployment
rates," he said. "Here the difference is striking. It is
by far the region of the world with highest rates of
unemployment, and this has been confirmed over
decades."
He highlighted youth unemployment, where
the figures are even larger, yet
showed evidence against the per
ception that the proportion of
youth in the total population is
higher than in other regions around
the world.

Achcar moved from his exposi
tion on general conditions in the
MENA region to identify "crony
capitalism" and "despotism" as
roots of the 2011 movements.
"The reason for all this ... is the
kind of capitalism that we find in
the region, which is crony capital
ism at its worst," he said. "There is
little incentive for private capital to
get into big or long-term invest
ment. Most of the kind of capital
ism you have is hit-and-run kind of
capitalism."

Achcar indicated that countries
that combine corruption and des
potism tend to have the strongest
protest movements. According to
Achcar, the question to be asked,
however, is not how the revolutions
occurred but why they took so long,
given the region's conditions.
"This was no lightning in the
blue sky or anything of the kind
this was expected," he said. "Of
course no one could have predicted
the form of it."

This form was largely shaped by
satellite television, namely A1
Jazeera, as well as social media.

"Revolution in communication
technology is very much at the cen
ter of the way it spread ... not the
cause, but the way it spread," he
said, describing the moniker "Face
book revolution" as "caricatural."
Achcar also favored the term
"revolutionary processes" over
"revolutions."

"I would call what is happening
a revolutionary process, emphasiz
ing process," he said. "It really indi
cates that we are going through a

process and it is far from finished."
Achcar described the process as
"uneven." He stated that Tunisia
and Egypt completed stage one,
which consisted of toppling its for
mer rulers Ben Ali and Hosni
Mubarak. The remnants of their
regimes however, remain.

"The mass movement was able
to overthrow, topple the tip of the
iceberg," he said. "This is the cor
rect characterization, because it's
only the top of the iceberg the
person most closely representing
the despotic character. This has
been done while the regime in both
countries is still there."

Achcer emphasized that al
though the protests across the
MENA region share common roots
and features, differences between
states and societies have led and
will continue to lead to differences
in how the revolutionary processes
unfold.

"Certainly what started in De
cember 2010 in the Middle East
and North Africa won't be stop
ping anytime soon ... it's a pro
tracted process ... the outcome of
what we are seeing will be deter
mined by whoever comes to pre
vail," he said.
Professor of history Joel Beinin
moderated the question and an
swer session following the lecture.
Attendees posed questions
about geopolitical factors, implica
tions for Lebanon in wake of the
Arab Spring, the different ap
proach to reform in Morocco and
Jordan, the nature of democratic
transformations, U.S. regional poli
cy, local workers' movements, the
relationship between capitalism
and sovereignty and future scenar
ios for Syria.
The lecture was co-sponsored by
the Abbasi Program in Islamic
Studies, CDDRL Program on Arab
Reform and Democracy and Stan
ford Humanities Center.
