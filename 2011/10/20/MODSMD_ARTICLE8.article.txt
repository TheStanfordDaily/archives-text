## Study finds selfishness can yield respect 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Individuals who act in their own self
interest are more likely to gain prestige
and leadership recognition than those
who exhibit altruistic characteristics, ac
cording to a recent study.

Stanford's Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB) collaborated with North
western University's Kellogg School of
Management and Carnegie Mellon
University's Tepper School of Business
on the report, which was published in
the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology.

Robert Livingston, co-author of the
study and an assistant professor at Kel
logg, wrote in an email to The Daily that
the collaboration between these three
business schools sprung out of personal
friendships and similar academic inter
ests. He said the researchers conducted
all of their three experiments at the be
havioral lab at Stanford's GSB.

"One might think that generosity
would be a virtue (and selfishness a
bane) for people who are aspiring to be
elevated to high positions of authority
and power by others," Livingston wrote.
Instead, the study found the opposite
was true.

According to Livingstone, their re
search sought to explore how an indi
vidual's contribution to a group would
affect teammates' perceptions of him or
her. He said that individuals who more
frequently acted in their self-interest
achieved a greater sense of prestige
within the group even over those
who contributed often to the team.

The study also asked participants
called intergroup members to
choose a leader whom they felt would
be best in one of two different situa
tions. According to the report, the situa
tions were designed to be either more
"cooperative" or "competitive" in
nature.

The "cooperative" test asked in
tergroup members to choose a
leader who would allocate re
sources while the "competitive"
test asked the members to choose a
leader who would help them in
competition against a rival out
group.

"These experiments demon
strate that the leaders that people
want vary as a function of the inter
group situation," wrote Nir Halevy,
co-author of the study and GSB as
sistant professor, in an email to The
Daily. He said that the qualities
teammates seek in a leader change
depending on the circumstance.
Halevy also said that these find
ings are universally applicable and
could shine more light on how a sys
tem of leadership develops,
whether in offices or on the reality
show "Survivor."

He said the study also explored

the relationship between those
who are in an in-group and those
who are in an out-group within a
society.

"One interesting finding was
that generosity toward out-group
members does not lead to respect
and admiration in the eyes of oth
ers," Halevy said. "In fact, it led to
lower levels of prestige compared
to showing generosity toward in
group members only."
Halevy added that these find
ings should by no means discourage
people in the process of climbing
the ladder to show generosity
they simply explain the behavioral
tendencies of individuals operating
in a competitive atmosphere.
According to Halevy, the study's
co-authors have many ideas about
where to take their research next.
For instance, he said the study
leaves areas open for examination,
such as the extent to which "aspir
ing leaders strategically display be
haviors that can boost their prestige
or dominance, depending on the
group context."
