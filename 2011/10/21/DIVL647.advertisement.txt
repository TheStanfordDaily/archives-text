America's schools are in trouble. Twenty five percent of
American kids drop out of high school. And those that do
graduate often are ill prepared for either college or a 21st
Century job. But potential solutions are polarizing.
Join master interviewer Charlie Rose and a distinguished panel of
luminaries to tackle the question of how to improve our troubled
school system and provide a better future for our nation's
greatest resource, our kids.
