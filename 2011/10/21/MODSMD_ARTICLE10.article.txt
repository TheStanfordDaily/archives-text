# SEEING GREEN
## Lumps and fragments: humanity and the wildlife relocation problem 
### Holly Moeller 
Dumpster diving has never
been my cup of tea.
But when it comes to science, it
turns out that you can convince me to
tackle all sorts of less-than-glam
orous tasks, including creeping
around the back alleys of elegant
small towns with a net and some plas
tic tubing.
Luke a roommate and hero of
past, current and future adventures
and I were hunting Drosophilia,
tiny flies that love humans and rot
ting compost so much that you can
usually find them hovering around
every rubbish pile in California.
Which is why our friend Heather
a researcher of genetic differences
in Drosophilia populations up and
down the Pacific Coast equipped
Luke and me with nets when we told
her we'd be in Humboldt County last
weekend. (Heather samples the
Hawaiian flies herself.)

Of those us who've met
Drosophilia in a scientific context,
most probably remember it from
general biology class, where it's used
as a simple genetic model to demon
strate dominant and recessive traits.
Researchers still use flies to untangle
tricky genetic pathways and unlock
the mysteries of development.

But Heather's questions are both
more basic and more complex. She
wants to know how evolution works.
And Drosophilia, with their large,
widespread populations and fast
generation times, are the ideal study
subject.

In theory, flies the world over are
responding to a world of different se
lection pressures things like pesti
cides, or harsh winters, or tough com
petition for fruit that drive adap
tation to fit local conditions and, writ
large, evolutionary diversification of
populations.

Take pesticide resistance, for ex
ample. Because fly populations are
big, when you start spraying a new
chemical, at least one fly probably
has a mutation that allows it to sur
vive. Since fly generations are so
short (a couple weeks from egg to
egg), we can witness evolution in ac
tion, as pesticide-resistant genotypes
climb to dominance within a few
years. Today, we find flies all over the
world carrying the same pesticide-re
sistance mutations on different ge
netic backgrounds (that is, on differ
ent sets of ancestral genes), indicat
ing that resistance evolved multiple
times in different locations. Eventu
ally, the accumulation of new muta
tions both at random, and under

selection may lead to speciation,
in which populations become so dif
ferent that they either can't or won't
interbreed, and scientists identify
them as different species.
Of course, not all signals are as
strong as the pesticide resistance one.
And even in Drosophilia, they can
get quite complicated, in part be
cause we humans interfere every
time we ship a truckload of fruit
(with, doubtless, a few hundred
winged stowaways) hundreds of
miles down the road.

In this case, humans are eroding
the Drosophilia population structure
and connecting subpopulations with
bursts of new immigrants. This mixes
up mutations and adaptations that
otherwise would have arisen and
evolved in isolation for hundreds of
fly generations.

Flies aren't the only creatures we
ship around the planet. Our global
crop monocultures have replaced
local, diverse crop varieties, leaving
us with little genetic insurance for

changing environmental conditions
ahead. Salmon hatcheries in the Pa
cific Northwest have inadvertently
mixed up a coastline of diverse sub
populations, introducing maladap
tive traits to locally adapted popula
tions.
We're not just in the business of
genetic reshuffling. Often our activ
ities â€” the construction of roads
and cities, the replacement of forests

with farms fragment once-con
tinuous plant and animal popula
tions. Newly minted subpopulations
may be too small to stand alone and
dwindle into local extinction. If they
do survive, they may be forced
through genetic bottlenecks, in
which traits present in the few
founding individuals are locked into
the future population, for better or
for worse. And small population
fragments may adapt and evolve to
microscale environmental differ
ences in ways that the original, larg
er population could not.

That's more in the vein of Luke's
work. He studies populations of
frogs and salamanders broken up by
agricultural fields and cities. Some
species thrive in their human-modi
fied environments: anyone who's lis
tened to a midsummer frog chorus in
Manhattan's Central Park can attest
to that. Others aren't so lucky
there's a reason we use amphibians
(and their loss) as indicators of
ecosystem health.
What will these new population
structures mean for evolution and
the rate at which organisms evolve
into new species? In the case of
Drosophilia, salmon and corn, will

one dominant genotype rule the
world? Will its suite of human-loved
traits spell lasting success or ecologi
cal doom? And when we splinter
populations, will we increase genetic
diversity or facilitate its loss? Will we
drive creation of new species or
erode away resilience from existing
ones?
The answers will differ for every
organism. In part, they'll depend on
how rapidly evolution can happen.
One day, we may wonder if we can
adapt fast enough to keep up with
our own modifications of the world.
For now, we're left to ponder what
right we have to change the course of
billions of years of evolution or
whether, as products of evolution
ourselves, we ought to ponder such
ethical conundrums at all.
Luke and I return from our
dumpster dive with a grand total of
two flies. The weather's misty, and
there's a chill in the air. I can tell
Luke thinks we'd have more luck
finding salamanders in these condi
tions, but only outside city limits.
