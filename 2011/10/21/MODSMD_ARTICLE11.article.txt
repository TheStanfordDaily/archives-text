# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## Occupational hazards 
### D.S. Nelson 
Occupy Wall Street (OWS)
has built its ideology on a
historical fallacy. If we be
lieve its folksy altruism, that small
businesses that limited their ambi
tion to small markets and derided
the desire to move forward gave
America its wealth, we deceive
ourselves. Occupy Wall Street has
to come to terms with the fact that
the Utopia that they believe predat
ed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall
Act, and whose weakening re
quired that act initially was not re
sponsible for creating the middle
class it so dearly wants. America, in
large part, owes its success to its
biggest businesses.

Corporate greed, fat cats and
other caricatures of cigar-smoking,
tuxedo-clad bankers are hardly the
root cause of the financial crisis.
They have always been paid hand
somely, and the fact that most of
our financial institutions remained
solvent and have paid back the
loans they received further speaks
to the high ability that merits their
pay. They work 80-plus-hour
weeks. They give themselves over
to their work. It is sensible that
their commitment and competen
cy, especially considering the risks
involved, be reflected in their pay
We can say they are greedy, but we
need people with this kind of dedi
cation to do high-level work. If
they weren't paid so highly, fewer
and less-qualified people would
consent to the sacrifice of their 20s,
their weekends and their sleep for
finance.

The financial institutions that
OWS hates made the highest level
of home ownership ever in the
United States possible. But if we
are going to go about assigning
blame, we have to understand that
at the most basic level irre
sponsible individuals are the prob
lem. People took mortgages they
could not afford on the chance that
their circumstances would improve
or their houses would increase in
value. They made ambitious gam
bles that failed, and that's why fore
closures are at record rates. Homes
are not being foreclosed so fat cats
have a place to store their Faberge
egg collections. Even banks do not
want homes in this depressed hous
ing market. Homes are being fore
closed because people took out
loans that they could not pay back.
You can blame financial institu
tions for providing them, but for
the last 10 years the federal govern
ment has done whatever it can to
try to get banks to lend to less ap
pealing borrowers. The intent was
good. The effect was catastrophic,
and the banks have not been better
off for it.

If we want to look for institu
tional problems that allowed un
derqualified borrowers into the
system, we can easily see that the
government, not private institu
tions, spurred such behavior. Look
ing into research by Edward Pinto,
the former chief credit officer of
Fannie Mae, we gain some perspec
tive. As cited in a recent Wall Street
Journal column by Peter Wallison,
Pinto concludes that of the nearly
50 percent of mortgages that were
deemed "subprime" (the borrower
had poor or no credit history), Fan
nie, Freddie and other government
agencies held 70 percent. The fact
that the federal government man
dated 55 percent (in 2007) of the
mortgages they issued by these
agencies be given to people with
less than ideal credit, a gradual 25
percent increase over the 30 per
cent required in 1992, explains the
huge numbers of loans to under
qualified borrowers. The govern
ment even extended this mandate
to private industry, when the Com
munity Reinvestment Act of 1995
required banks and savings and
loan associations to make a certain
proportion of their loans to bor
rowers of lesser income. The fact
remains that, though derivatives
allowed aggressive speculation on
these loans, the sheer amount of
bad debt alone was enough to
bring the system down. Derivatives
and speculation on them merely
spread the hurt.
As for the consistent complaint
that the government bailed out the
corporations but left the little guy
in the lurch, I suggest a quick re
consideration. Who would have
lost their deposits, their savings
and their access to credit for recov
ery if the big banks had failed? The
little guy. "Main Street." Saving the

big banks is fundamentally helpful
for small business and normal peo
ple. Had they toppled, America
would be in straits direr than we
can imagine. The idea that the fed
eral government has shirked its
moral obligation to its people by
saving the banks instead is ludi
crous.

What is most troubling to me
about OWS is that it reflects
Americans' tendency to accept
theories with little evidence but
great import without scrutiny. It
seems altogether paranoid to me
to think that 1 percent of Ameri
cans have, through lobbyists and
other outrageously immoral
means, commandeered our coun
try. We have an independent
media, with only one of the major
television news outlets at risk of
being called biased towards that 1

percent. We have extremely pow
erful and wealthy unions to count
er the influence of lobbyists and
there are dairy lobbyists, farming
lobbyists and lobbyists from indus
tries other than the "evil" oil in
dustry. They all have a right to be
heard, just as we citizens have a
right to counteract their influence
with our vote and our power to as
semble en masse. Instead of doing
what amounts to little more than a
public demonstration of frustra
tion, we could campaign for and
donate to congressmen and con
gresswomen who pledge not to
deal with lobbyists. It is not ration
al to find an unmistakably bad sit
uation, chafe at the circumstances
it leaves you in and throw a stone
at the nearest possible blamewor
thy object. It is not productive and
it does not, fundamentally, address
the problems that caused the bad
situation in the first place.
