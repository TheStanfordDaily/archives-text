## Longevity also inherited nongenetically, study finds 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O 'Byrne 
In addition to their genes, your
parent's eating habits and lifestyle
choices may also have a non-genetic
effect on your lifespan, according to
new research from the School of
Medicine.

By blocking or modifying any of
three proteins in the roundworm C.
elegans, researchers were able to in
crease the lifespan of the round
worm and its descendants, even
though its descendants did not carry
the genetic modification. According
to the press release, this is the first
time longevity has been shown to be
transferred non-genetically.
Organisms modify the way their
genes are expressed without actual
ly changing their underlying DNA
sequences in a process called epige
netics.This study, however, is the first
to show that these changes are not
always reset between generations.
Associate professor of genetics
Anne Brunet and graduate student
Eric Greer conducted the study.
Greer mutated the genes responsi
ble for encoding three proteins
(ASH-2, WDR-5 and SET-2), then
bred the worms to ensure their off
spring would not carry the same mu
tation.

Greer found that the descen
dants of these modified worms had
longer lifespans than descendants
from un-modified worms, indicating
the mutation affected the offspring
even though it was not genetically
inherited. The increased lifespan
lasted for up to three generations,
but eventually reverted back to the
normal amount of time.
"We still don't know the exact
mechanism of this epigenetic mem
ory of longevity between genera
tions," said Brunet in a statement on
the School of Medicine website.

"We hypothesize that when the
parental generation is missing key
components that normally regulate
chromatin, epigenetic marks are not
completely reset from one genera
tion to the next in the germ line,
thereby inducing heritable changes
in gene expression. It will be very in
teresting to understand how this
happens," she added.
The research was funded by the
National Institutes of Health, the
Glenn Foundation for Medical Re
search and a Helen Hay Whitney
Postdoctoral Fellowship.
