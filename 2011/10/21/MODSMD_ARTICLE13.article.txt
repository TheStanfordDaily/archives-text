# Urban heat islands not major contributor to warming, study shows
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
Cities acting as "urban heat is
lands" do not significantly affect the
overall warming of the planet, ac
cording to a study completed by en
vironmental engineering professor
Mark Z. Jacobson and graduate stu
dent John Ten Hoe ve, who studies in
the same department.
Cities do produce more heat than
surrounding areas, however, accord
ing to the study, this only contributes
two to four percent of the total
warming since the Industrial Revo
lution, compared to 18 percent from
black carbon and 79 percent from
greenhouse gases.
This study directly contradicts
some climate skeptics, who have ar
gued that this urban heating effect
contributes more than greenhouse
gases.
"This study shows that the urban
heat island effect is a relatively
minor contributor to warming, con
trary to what climate skeptics have
claimed," Jacobson said in an inter
view with the Stanford Report.
"Greenhouse gases and particu
late black carbon cause far more
warming," he added.
The study was the first that di
rectly addressed urban heat islands
on a global scale, evaluating their ef
fect on sea-surface temperatures,
sea ice, atmospheric stability,
aerosol concentrations and other
factors.
Another interesting result the
study found was the ineffectiveness
of white-roofs. Though painting
roofs white has been touted as away
to reduce global warming, Jacobson
found that it in fact contributed to
global warming by reflecting sun
light back into the atmosphere, re
ducing cloudiness and increasing
the absorption of pollutants.
"There does not seem to be a
benefit from investing in white
roofs," said Jacobson. "The most im
portant thing is to reduce emissions
of the pollutants that contribute to
global warming."
"Cooling your house with white
roofs at the expense of warming the
planet is not a very desirable trade
off," Jacobson said. "A warmer plan
et will melt the sea ice and glaciers
faster, triggering feedbacks that will
lead to even greater overall warm
ing. There are more effective meth
ods of reducing global warming."
One such method is installing
photovoltaic panels on roofs, which
absorb sunlight and convert it to en
ergy rather than reflecting it.
The study was funded by NASA
and the U.S. Environmental Protec
tion Agency.
