## KEEP THE BALL ROLLING PAC-12 PERFECTION TO BE TESTED BY UTES, BUFFS 
### BILLY GALLAGHER DESK EDITOR 
The top-ranked women's soccer team will welcome the
Pac-12's newest members, Utah and Colorado, to the Farm
this weekend in games tonight and Sunday afternoon.
For the Utes (8-6-1,4-2-0) and Buffs (3-9-2,0-4-1), it like
ly won't be a warm welcome from the Cardinal Stanford
has won its last 26 conference games and has been blowing
by its outmatched Pac-12 competition in recent weeks.
Stanford kicked off conference play by routing Arizona
7-0 at home before heading north to eke out a pair of 1-0
wins over Washington and No. 23 Washington State, which
is currently second in the Pac-12 standings.
The Cardinal then returned to the friendly confines of
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium where they have won 43
straight games to demolish USC 3-0 and beat then-No. 3
UCLA 4-1. And last week, Stanford traveled to Arizona
State and took down the Sun Devils, 3-1.

Now, the team will try to keep chugging along towards a
Pac-12 title, with five games remaining. Utah could be the
Cardinal's most significant roadblock to the conference
championship the Utes, in fourth place, are two games be
hind Stanford in Pac-12 standings. Utah is coming off a big 1-
0 overtime win over No. 18 Oregon State and will be travel
ing to Palo Alto looking for an upset.The Utes are led by sen
ior forward Erin Dalley, who has won two Pac-12 Player of
the Week awards and leads the team in points (12), goals (5),
game winners (3), shots (30) and shots-on-goal (15).
However, Stanford will counter with its own superstar
seniors, most notably forward Lindsay Taylor (24 points)
and midfielder Teresa Noyola (21 points). That duo, com
bined with excellent play in the net by sophomore Emily
Oliver and a strong push by freshman forward Chioma
Übogagu to break the freshman points record she is al
ready at 20 bode well for a Cardinal victory.
Colorado, on the other hand, sits at the bottom of the
Pac-12 standings and is winless in conference play thus far.
As long as Stanford does not overlook the Buffs a prob
lem which should not arise for this veteran-laden, well
coached squad it should cruise to an easy victory.
The Cardinal starts at 7 p.m. Friday against Utah and 1
p.m. Sunday against Colorado. Both games are at Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium.

Freshman forward Chioma Übogagu (above) is third on the team in points with 20. She has emerged this season as one of the
Pac-12's most impressive rookies and looks to have another strong weekend against new Pac-12 additions Utah and Colorado.
