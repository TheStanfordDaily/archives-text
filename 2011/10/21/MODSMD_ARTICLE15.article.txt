# FIELD HOCKEY
## Seniors say their farewells tonight 
### SARAH MAISEL 
After spoiling California's sen
ior day last Sunday, the Stanford
field hockey team looks to send its
own seniors, Ale Moss and
Stephanie Byrne, out with a perfect
NorPac record this Friday against
UC-Davis.

The No. 9 Cardinal (12-2, 5-0
NorPac) last met the Aggies (3-9,1-
2) on Sept. 25 and easily earned the
3-1 win.

The team plans to honor Moss,
Byrne and redshirt juniors Devon
Holman and Katie Mitchell in a
pregame ceremony. In the group's
time on the Farm, Stanford played
in three NCAA Tournament games
and won the last four NorPac

Championships. The squad has
helped bring recognition to West
Coast field hockey, which has been
the proverbial younger sibling to
East Coast powerhouses like Syra
cuse, Connecticut and Maryland.
The class was part of the record
breaking 2009 team, whose 17 victo
ries are the most in school history.
This year the seniors have seen the
Cardinal climb as high as No. 6 in
the national rankings and win nine
consecutive games, both matching
school records.
The formidable play of Moss and
Byrne on both sides of the field has
made the Cardinal a strong force to
be reckoned with.

Senior goalkeeper Ale Moss will be playing her 76th game in Cardinal
today in her final home appearance. The three-time AII-NorPac honoree
and her teammates hope to extend Stanford's perfect conference season.
