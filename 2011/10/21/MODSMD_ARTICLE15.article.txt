# FIELD HOCKEY
## Seniors say their farewells tonight 
### SARAH MAISEL 
After spoiling California's sen
ior day last Sunday, the Stanford
field hockey team looks to send its
own seniors, Ale Moss and
Stephanie Byrne, out with a perfect
NorPac record this Friday against
UC-Davis.

The No. 9 Cardinal (12-2, 5-0
NorPac) last met the Aggies (3-9,1-
2) on Sept. 25 and easily earned the
3-1 win.

The team plans to honor Moss,
Byrne and redshirt juniors Devon
Holman and Katie Mitchell in a
pregame ceremony. In the group's
time on the Farm, Stanford played
in three NCAA Tournament games
and won the last four NorPac

Championships. The squad has
helped bring recognition to West
Coast field hockey, which has been
the proverbial younger sibling to
East Coast powerhouses like Syra
cuse, Connecticut and Maryland.
The class was part of the record
breaking 2009 team, whose 17 victo
ries are the most in school history.
This year the seniors have seen the
Cardinal climb as high as No. 6 in
the national rankings and win nine
consecutive games, both matching
school records.
The formidable play of Moss and
Byrne on both sides of the field has
made the Cardinal a strong force to
be reckoned with.

Senior goalkeeper Ale Moss will be playing her 76th game in Cardinal
today in her final home appearance. The three-time AII-NorPac honoree
and her teammates hope to extend Stanford's perfect conference season.
"They're both really strong per
sonalities and that has had a huge
positive effect on the atmosphere
of the team," said assistant student
coach Xanthe Travlos, who played
for the Cardinal from 2007-10.
Moss, a fifth-year senior, estab
lished herself as a dependably
clutch force in goal and earned All-
NorPac honors three times. Last
season she had career bests of 24
goals allowed and a goals-against
average of 1.31. This year her defen
sive dominance has not stopped, as
the Cardinal has dropped only two
games both of which were on
the road.
"We like to think of [Ale] as the
hippie of our team," Travlos said.
"She's pretty eccentric. As a goal
keeper you have to be a little bit
crazy when balls are getting hit at
you at 100 miles an hour."
Byrne, a starting attacker for the
Cardinal, complements Moss's
fierce style of play on the other side
of the field. A consistent player,
Byrne has started all but four
games of her career. In fact, eight of
her 23 career goals have been
game-winners; she secured Stan
ford's 2009 appearance in the
NCAA Tournament with an over
time goal against Boston Universi
ty in a play-in game. This year she
leads the team with 11 assists and is
third in overall points with 18.
"I've never met someone who
smiles as much as Steph," Travlos

said. "Her bubbly, happy and
charming personality keeps the
team going."
"Steph is such a leader, but real
ly leads by example. As a center for
ward, it's one of the most tiring po
sitions to play...on attack you have
to make sure you get to each ball,
and she never gives up," Travlos
added.
Friday night's contest should be
an exciting cap to the Cardinal's
successful home and conference
campaigns. UC-Davis has gained
valuable experience since its previ
ous meeting with Stanford; last
week, the Aggies came within one
goal of California late in the game
before falling 3-1. In only the fourth
year of its field hockey program,
UC-Davis has proved it can com
pete with the best, taking the Cardi
nal to overtime last season before
Stanford prevailed 2-1.
"The biggest thing we're think
ing of is that we give them a lot of
respect and look for whatever they
throw at us," Travlos said, adding
that the squad needs "to be flexible
to execute our game plan and be
ready for anything that might hap
pen. I think that's a really important
part to be a successful team. It takes
a truly great team to play when the
situation isn't always predictable."
This matchup is a chance to con
tinue the team's momentum as it
goes on the road next week to face
No. 7 Michigan and Michigan State,
The Cardinal takes on the Ag
gies at 7 p.m. tonight at the Varsity
Turf.
