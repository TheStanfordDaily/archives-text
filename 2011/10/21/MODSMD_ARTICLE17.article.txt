## WAYS TO KILL A ZOMBIE 
### 
To commemorate the season two premiere of "The Walking
Dead" on AMC last Sunday, the cast selected its choice of
zombie-slaying tools at New York Comic-Con. We here at
Intermission aren't sure if we're ready to live a life of secluded
Twinkie-eating and cockroach-befriending quite yet, but just
in case that darned zombie apocalypse pops up anytime
soon, here's how we'd deal with those undead suckers.
Eternal flamethrower
We're fairly certain we've never seen a George A. Romero
flick with fire-retardant zombies, so this is a pretty safe bet.
Throw in some sort of technological innovation to keep the
flame going, and it's the gift that keeps on giving.
Elven sword
Yes, Intermission's a little bit of a "Lord of the Rings" fan (ok,
make that an über dork), but if we somehow got hold of an
Elven sword like Sting the immediate choice might be
Anduril, but let's remember that the reforged sword was
Dwarven-made, which means no glow (ok, ok, we'll stop now)
programmed to glow blue in the presence of zombies
instead of Ores, we'd have a deadly weapon plus a built-in
alarm system. (Take that, Sword of Gryffindor!)
Bulldozer
You can effortlessly crush those nasty undead folk while
remaining out of their grasp from your high perch. This is
what we call a win-win.
Indestructible bubble suit
Think apocalyptic "Bubble Boy." Similar to the bulldozer, you
could roll over any zombies in your way while remaining safe
and sanitary inside of your hyperbaric chamber. Just make
sure you include an escape sleeve somewhere so you can
reach out and grab another Twinkie or can of Spam when you
get hungry after all that zombie-squashing.
Shotgun
Sturdy and traditional, it worked for a vigilante hobo as well
as the cast of "Zombieland." Simple, classy and effective.
