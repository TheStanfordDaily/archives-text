Today marks day one of the 14th United
Nations Association Film Festival, originally
founded by Stanford educator Jasmina Bojic to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Every year
UNAFF showcases the most powerful and timely
documentaries from all over the globe, with this year's
theme being "Education Is A Human Right."
Screenings, panel discussions and receptions with
filmmakers will take place in Palo Alto, East Palo Alto,
San Francisco and Stanford campus through Sunday,
Oct. 30. Not sure what to check out? Here we've high
lighted several projects with strong ties to the
Stanford community.
Inspired by their 2007 memoir of the same
name, "The Power of Two," directed by Marc
Smolowitz, explores the uphill battle of half-Japanese
twin sisters Anabel Stenzel '94 and Isabel Stenzel
Byrnes '94 against the fatal genetic disease cystic fibro
sis. Since undergoing double lung transplants, the
twins have gone on to become authors, athletes and
global advocates for organ donation. The film incor
porates archival footage, including that of their tour
of Japan, a nation where transplantation is stigma
tized, as well as expert interviews from the likes of Dr.
Bruce Reitz, professor emeritus at the Stanford School
of Medicine and the surgeon who performed the
twins' transplants.
Independent filmmaker and writer Carol Liu 'O5
presents "Restoring the Light," an inspirational study
of several families coping with debilitating health
problems in rural China. These vignettes include a

young woman
who dreams of
attending univer
sity despite a
severe bone infec
tion, her grand
mother who toils
away in the fields
despite eyesight
diminished by
cataracts and a
dedicated doctor
who sacrifices his
home in order to
establish an inde-

pendent practice
to support the community.
And finally, "There's No Sound in My Head"
examines the boundaries between music and visual
art using Stanford faculty Mark Applebaum's picto
graphic score "The Metaphysics of Notation," which
for one year was on display at the Cantor Arts Center
Museum along with two hanging mobiles and no
form of instructions. Over the course of the installa
tion, it received over 45 weekly performances from
interpreters the world over. The film, directed by
Robert Arnold and produced by Applebaum, includes
interviews with musicologists, performance footage
and conversations with the composer himself.
