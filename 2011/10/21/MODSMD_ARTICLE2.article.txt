## CARDINAL FACES OFF AGAINST PRICE, HUSKIES 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After rolling through its first six
games of 2011, Stanford football returns
to the Farm this weekend for its biggest
test so far. The Cardinal will face Wash
ington, the first top-25 opponent on the
squad's backloaded schedule.
The No. 7 Cardinal (6-0,3-0 Pac-12)
hasn't been challenged on the score
board much this season it has blown
out every opponent by more than 25
points but the No. 22 Huskies (5-1,3-
0) present a balanced offensive attack
that has them tied for the lead atop the
Pac-12 North. Most of Washington's sur
prising success can be attributed the
quick maturation of quarterback Keith
Price, who has already tossed 21 touch
downs to just four interceptions this sea
son.

Price's scorching start has him being
consistently touted as one of the nation's
most underrated or overlooked talents,
and Stanford head coach David Shaw
said he was impressed by the redshirt
sophomore.
"[Price is] good, he's athletic, he's ac
curate, he's not just an athlete playing
quarterback — he's a good quarter
back," Shaw said. "He doesn't always
just run and take off and flee the pocket,
he'll buy some time with his eyes down
the field just like you teach it."

NOTES: In a battle of two of the Pac-12's
most impressive quarterbacks, redshirt jun
ior Andrew Luck will try to top sophomore
Husky play-caller Keith Price, the only man
in the conference who has thrown more
touchdowns than the Stanford star. The
Cardinal needs to be sharp in its first game
against a top-25 opponent this season.


Pac-12 with more touchdown passes
than Stanford signal-caller Andrew
Luck, and Shaw mentioned that he
was a bit surprised with how fast the
Huskies' quarterback had become a
force.

"We saw him last year and we
knew that they were going to have
something special," Shaw said. "The
question is always how long does
that progression take for a young
quarterback, and [Washington head
coach] Steve Sarkisian has been able
to speed that process up."
Price's ascent has led to compar
isons to Jake Locker, his predecessor
at quarterback, who was the eighth
overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft by
the Tennessee Titans, but the Cardi
nal defenders insist that the task of
stopping the Huskies' quarterback
will be different this year.
"[Price] is a different type of
threat," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "He's definitely more con
sistent when he's trying to keep plays
alive and throw it down the field.
[With] Locker, you knew he was try
ing to run."

Price isn't the only weapon on an
offense that scores 37 points per
game, though, as he's got a talented
running back just behind him in jun
ior Chris Polk.
Polk was touted as a dark-horse
Heisman contender before the sea
son, and is widely considered to be
the second-best running back in the
Pac-12 after Oregon's LaMichael
James. Polk has amassed 728 yards
and three touchdowns on the ground
this season, but also has two touch
down catches, highlighting his multi
tude of talents.

"[Polk] is an every-down, every
situation running back," Shaw said.
"He's physical between the tackles,
he's got speed to beat you to the out
side. I've seen them flex him out and
motion him out to catch passes ...
over the years he's progressively got
ten better. You can't put him in a box
and say, 'He just does this.'"

To defuse the Huskies' offensive
attack, both Shaw and the Cardinal
defenders agree that the best way to
stop Price is to cause sacks both with
pressure up front and coverage
downfield.

"I think it's going to be very im
portant because he's an athletic kid
with an accurate arm, and we can't let
him sit back there because he'll pick
you apart," Shaw said. "Hopefully
our coverage is tight enough to make

him hold the ball a split second
longer than he wants to so that a guy
like [senior linebacker] Chase
Thomas can get in there and get him
on the ground. For these guys it's
going to take a mix of coverage and
pressure. You don't want [Price] to
know what's always going on."
With the Huskies' speed, Stan
ford will have to clean up some of the
defensive mistakes that it got away
with against a less-dominant Cougar
squad.

"Unlike last week when we
missed a couple sacks and guys prob
ably got away from their coverage,
we're going to have to do a better job
of staying with their receivers after
they run their initial route because
they're definitely doing a scramble
drill," Thomas said.
For the Stanford offense, the
challenge will be to get started fast
after a lackluster first half against

Washington State last weekend, es
pecially against a Husky defense that
allows the most passing yards in the
Pac-12.

Luck said that the team expects a
higher standard of play, particularly
as the schedule ramps up with three
games against one-loss teams in the
next four weeks.

"The deeper you go into the sea
son, you know you're going to have
to play better week to week," he said.

Luck also mentioned that last
week's poor first-half performance
left a bad taste for the Cardinal.

"I wouldn't say people were upset
and throwing tantrums, but there was
a little sense of unfinished business
and edginess to everyone," he added.
After throwing for 338 yards last
week, with 216 of them coming from
the Cardinal's triumvirate of talented
tight ends. Luck will most likely once
again rely heavily on passing to red

shirt senior Coby Fleener and juniors
Levine Toilolo and Zach Ertz.

The trio, dubbed "Trees' Compa
ny" by Fleener, credited the Cardi
nal's persistence in the running game
in their success last week, which will
be challenged by a Husky defense
that only allows 97 yards a game on
the ground.
"I think it starts with the running
game, in the first half we didn't really
get that going," Ertz said. "But in the
second half, we completed some long
passes and got the safeties to move
back, and I think that set up the run
game which kind of got the whole of
fense going."
Overall, the Cardinal said its
biggest goal will be to finally play that
"complete game" that has eluded it
so far to this point.
"As far as style of play, I would say
that we are close," Shaw said. "We've
played our best football in spurts

a quarter here, a half here. The coach
es have been saying, 'We've got it in
you, now we've got to get it out of
you.'"

Achieving that goal will be even
more important, Thomas said, be
cause with the first ranked opponent
coming to town, there's a feeling that
the Cardinal's season starts in
earnest this Saturday.
"I can say that [our season starts
now]," he said. "We took care of the
things we needed to take care of to be
where we wanted to be and we're in a
position we wanted to be, where we
kind of control our own destiny with
in the Pac-12."

Redshirt junior quarterback Andrew Luck (No. 12) will be involved in a passing duel with sophomore Husky play-caller Keith Price, whose 21 touchdowns
lead the conference. Luck will need to repeat last year's strong performance in Seattle, where he threw for one score and ran for another.
After rolling through its first six
games of 2011, Stanford football returns
to the Farm this weekend for its biggest
test so far. The Cardinal will face Wash
ington, the first top-25 opponent on the
squad's backloaded schedule.
The No. 7 Cardinal (6-0,3-0 Pac-12)
hasn't been challenged on the score
board much this season it has blown
out every opponent by more than 25
points but the No. 22 Huskies (5-1,3-
0) present a balanced offensive attack
that has them tied for the lead atop the
Pac-12 North. Most of Washington's sur
prising success can be attributed the
quick maturation of quarterback Keith
Price, who has already tossed 21 touch
downs to just four interceptions this sea
son.

Price's scorching start has him being
consistently touted as one of the nation's
most underrated or overlooked talents,
and Stanford head coach David Shaw
said he was impressed by the redshirt
sophomore.
"[Price is] good, he's athletic, he's ac
curate, he's not just an athlete playing
quarterback — he's a good quarter
back," Shaw said. "He doesn't always
just run and take off and flee the pocket,
he'll buy some time with his eyes down
the field just like you teach it."

NOTES: In a battle of two of the Pac-12's
most impressive quarterbacks, redshirt jun
ior Andrew Luck will try to top sophomore
Husky play-caller Keith Price, the only man
in the conference who has thrown more
touchdowns than the Stanford star. The
Cardinal needs to be sharp in its first game
against a top-25 opponent this season.


Pac-12 with more touchdown passes
than Stanford signal-caller Andrew
Luck, and Shaw mentioned that he
was a bit surprised with how fast the
Huskies' quarterback had become a
force.

"We saw him last year and we
knew that they were going to have
something special," Shaw said. "The
question is always how long does
that progression take for a young
quarterback, and [Washington head
coach] Steve Sarkisian has been able
to speed that process up."
Price's ascent has led to compar
isons to Jake Locker, his predecessor
at quarterback, who was the eighth
overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft by
the Tennessee Titans, but the Cardi
nal defenders insist that the task of
stopping the Huskies' quarterback
will be different this year.
"[Price] is a different type of
threat," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "He's definitely more con
sistent when he's trying to keep plays
alive and throw it down the field.
[With] Locker, you knew he was try
ing to run."

Price isn't the only weapon on an
offense that scores 37 points per
game, though, as he's got a talented
running back just behind him in jun
ior Chris Polk.
Polk was touted as a dark-horse
Heisman contender before the sea
son, and is widely considered to be
the second-best running back in the
Pac-12 after Oregon's LaMichael
James. Polk has amassed 728 yards
and three touchdowns on the ground
this season, but also has two touch
down catches, highlighting his multi
tude of talents.

"[Polk] is an every-down, every
situation running back," Shaw said.
"He's physical between the tackles,
he's got speed to beat you to the out
side. I've seen them flex him out and
motion him out to catch passes ...
over the years he's progressively got
ten better. You can't put him in a box
and say, 'He just does this.'"

To defuse the Huskies' offensive
attack, both Shaw and the Cardinal
defenders agree that the best way to
stop Price is to cause sacks both with
pressure up front and coverage
downfield.

"I think it's going to be very im
portant because he's an athletic kid
with an accurate arm, and we can't let
him sit back there because he'll pick
you apart," Shaw said. "Hopefully
our coverage is tight enough to make

him hold the ball a split second
longer than he wants to so that a guy
like [senior linebacker] Chase
Thomas can get in there and get him
on the ground. For these guys it's
going to take a mix of coverage and
pressure. You don't want [Price] to
know what's always going on."
With the Huskies' speed, Stan
ford will have to clean up some of the
defensive mistakes that it got away
with against a less-dominant Cougar
squad.

"Unlike last week when we
missed a couple sacks and guys prob
ably got away from their coverage,
we're going to have to do a better job
of staying with their receivers after
they run their initial route because
they're definitely doing a scramble
drill," Thomas said.
For the Stanford offense, the
challenge will be to get started fast
after a lackluster first half against

Washington State last weekend, es
pecially against a Husky defense that
allows the most passing yards in the
Pac-12.

Luck said that the team expects a
higher standard of play, particularly
as the schedule ramps up with three
games against one-loss teams in the
next four weeks.

"The deeper you go into the sea
son, you know you're going to have
to play better week to week," he said.

Luck also mentioned that last
week's poor first-half performance
left a bad taste for the Cardinal.

"I wouldn't say people were upset
and throwing tantrums, but there was
a little sense of unfinished business
and edginess to everyone," he added.
After throwing for 338 yards last
week, with 216 of them coming from
the Cardinal's triumvirate of talented
tight ends. Luck will most likely once
again rely heavily on passing to red

shirt senior Coby Fleener and juniors
Levine Toilolo and Zach Ertz.
