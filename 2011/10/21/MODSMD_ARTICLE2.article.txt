## CARDINAL FACES OFF AGAINST PRICE, HUSKIES 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
After rolling through its first six
games of 2011, Stanford football returns
to the Farm this weekend for its biggest
test so far. The Cardinal will face Wash
ington, the first top-25 opponent on the
squad's backloaded schedule.
The No. 7 Cardinal (6-0,3-0 Pac-12)
hasn't been challenged on the score
board much this season it has blown
out every opponent by more than 25
points but the No. 22 Huskies (5-1,3-
0) present a balanced offensive attack
that has them tied for the lead atop the
Pac-12 North. Most of Washington's sur
prising success can be attributed the
quick maturation of quarterback Keith
Price, who has already tossed 21 touch
downs to just four interceptions this sea
son.

Price's scorching start has him being
consistently touted as one of the nation's

NOTES: In a battle of two of the Pac-12's
most impressive quarterbacks, redshirt jun
ior Andrew Luck will try to top sophomore
Husky play-caller Keith Price, the only man
in the conference who has thrown more
touchdowns than the Stanford star. The
Cardinal needs to be sharp in its first game
against a top-25 opponent this season.
