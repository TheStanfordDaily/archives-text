Prized Spanish director Pedro
Almodovar returns to the screen with
"The Skin I Live In", a psychological
drama infused with equal parts mystery and
body horror. Inspired by Thierry Jonquet's
novel "Tarantula", what the narrative lacks in
structure it makes up for with the director's
signature aesthetic and mesmerizing perform
ance by leading man Antonio Banderas.

In a secluded Toledo estate, renowned
plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard (Banderas)
runs a private practice out of his personal
operating room by day while secretly experi
menting on his captive human subject Vera
(Elena Anaya) by night. As Robert's longtime
housekeeper Marilia (Marisa Paredes) later
explains to Vera, the doctor's obsession with
crafting the perfect synthetic skin is a direct
result of his wife's death 12 years ago. In the
aftermath of a near-fatal car accident, Robert
saved his wife's severely burned body from the
wreckage, only for her to later throw herself
from the bedroom balcony upon seeing her
disfigured reflection. Unfortunately the cou
ple's young daughter Norma (Blanca Suarez)
witnessed the suicide, leading to immense
emotional instability.
As the Ledgard family's tragedy unfolds
we are introduced to Vicente (Jan Cornet), a
young man whose fate becomes intertwined
with theirs when, six years prior to the present,
he attends the same wedding as Robert and
Norma, who has temporarily been released
from psychiatric care. Vicente persuades

Norma to take a walk, but once they reach the
garden his advances abruptly transition from
flirtatious to carnal. He flees when Norma
screams, and in his hasty exit he accidentally
knocks her out. Robert soon comes looking
for his daughter, but when she awakens she
imagines that he is the rapist. Feeling helpless
now that Norma is institutionalized once
again, Robert decides to unleash his vengeance
upon Vicente.
Past and present continually converge and

diverge, weaving a tangled web of relationships
that makes each revelation more disturbing
than the last. Even for Almodovar, a man
notorious for his unrestrained treatments of
desire, passion and identity, "The Skin I Live
In" is considerably dark and chilling. And per
haps this is where the story begins to come
apart. The crucial plot twist comes relatively
late in the film, making everything prior feel
aimless and everything after feel like a race to
the story's inevitable conclusion.
"The Skin I Live In" boasts stunning cine
matography from frequent collaborator Jose
Luis Alcaine, creating a stark contrast between
the picturesque Spanish countryside and the
vividly visceral surgical interior of Robert's
home. The other fruitful reunion is, of course,
that between the director and Banderas, who
featured prominently in a number of
Almodovar's films before transitioning to
Hollywood in the late 1980s. Like Jimmy
Stewart or Cary Grant in a Hitchcock film,
Banderas brings a nuanced performance so
engrossing that one cannot frilly dislike his
character despite his flaws.
Those less familiar with Almodovar's
work are more likely to be impressed by his
newest film. In adapting Jonquet's story,
Almodovar is adept at creating suspense but
ultimately holds on to the story too long
before letting the audience in. While "The
Skin I Live In" marks a decent foray into the
realm of horror for the director, it pales in
comparison to his other films, suggesting that
perhaps he ought to stick with his own origi
nal material.
