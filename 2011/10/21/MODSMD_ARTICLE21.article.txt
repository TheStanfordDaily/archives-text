## 'TERRA' NO-GO

Science fiction lovers, including yours
truly, had high hopes when word got
out of a "Lost"-meets-"Avatar"-meets
"Jurassic-Park" lovechild. Time-traveling por
tals! Dinosaurs! Did I say dinosaurs? And
who's that producing? Could it be is that
Steven Spielberg? These science fiction
lovers simply asked: "Where do we sign up?"
And so it was that three weeks ago they
sat with bated breath as a camera panned over
the surface of a moon and the following
words appeared: "At the dawn of the 22nd
century... the world is on the verge of col
lapse ... mankind's only hope for survival...
lies 85 million years in the past." Sigh. If only
the rest could live up.

The issue with "Terra Nova" is not its
concept, which reads as follows: 138 years
from now, mankind has poisoned its atmos
phere and small groups of colonists are being
sent 85 million years back in time to a settle
ment of humans trying to rebuild civilization.

The Shannon family
is one such lucky
group. Sure, they
immigrated illegally,
but no one has the
heart to turn away
three kids and it's
probably too much
trouble anyway (time
traveling is a compli
cated business).
It's not the con
cept that's the prob
lem, but its lack of

depth. Everything is too safe, too ordinary and
too predictable. Like any ABC Family show (it's
a low blow, I know), "Terra Nova" is white
washed with serenely good-looking characters
whose best attempts at sounding troubled just
make them look unnaturally angst-y. You
know the rest: the parents look 10 years older
than their kids; there's a messy father-son rela
tionship; there's the brainy sister who can't talk
to boys. There's no true dysfunction; every
domestic issue here has been dialed in from a
formula. When they try to be humorous, I can
only cringe.

Sadly, there's a pervasive sense of bland
ness that cheapens the entire series. The
refugee compound looks like a spread from
some eco-garden magazine; their refugee
home looks like a catalogue for Restoration
Hardware; their refugee (did I mention they're
refugees?!) clothes are immaculately clean.
To make up for its lack of emotional tru
ism, the producers score the entire series with
music I can only assume they've borrowed
from CSI and tracks that never made the
Avatar soundtrack. In light of how manufac
tured the characters and drama seem, the
music reads as ridiculously overdramatic. The
visuals, especially the panoramic shots of
Terra Nova (of which there are many), are
colorful and impressively realistic, but even
they possess that unshakably fake veneer.
Three episodes in, the writers are begin-

ning to tease out specif
ic storylines, and surely
they have more revela
tions up their sleeves.
But they just don't seem
up to the task of craft
ing compelling charac
ters. You'd have to over
haul the entire show to
imbue it with the edge
and depth of "Lost." Its
absence of multi
dimensional charac-

ters and even worse, its
holistic blandness, are fatal flaws. If we don't
care about the people who inhabit this world,
why should we care about that world itself? In
the end "Terra Nova" is a series that tries to
emulate better examples of science fiction.
But even its title card, which looks like the
logo of a start-up company, cannot stack up.
