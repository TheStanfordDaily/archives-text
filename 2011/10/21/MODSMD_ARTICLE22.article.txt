Treasure Island Music Festival came to
an iPhone-friendly close last weekend
with a jaw-dropping sunset on Sunday
evening. A testament to the young festival's

flexibility, San Francisco's satellite island sup
ported both an Explosions in the Sky rock con
flagration as well as a nostalgia-inducing tour
with Death Cab for Cutie on its closing night.
Over two days, 26 acts across the musical
slate attracted 25,000 attendees a number
sizable enough to produce a lively atmosphere
and small enough to make the Korean BBQ

line doable. From the primal aggression of
Saturday's sweat-provoking sets to the pure
rock of Sunday, Intermission was on hand to
capture the moments for yearbook posterity.
Treasure Island, you're great; don't ever change.
SATURDAY
To anyone who thought The Naked And
Famous was going to give a shiny pop set:
should have brought earplugs. The band of
Kiwis switched between Passion-Pit-esque

melodies and shredding guitars and touched
on tracks from their only album "Punching
in a Dream" and "The Sun."

The island wasn't prepared to receive the
Portuguese electro-dance crew Buraka Som
Sistema. Repping the progressive kuduro style
(think tribal house), the group whiplashed

curious onlookers into a disjointed, pulsating
frenzy. The lyrics may not have been as aggres
sively lewd as last year's Die Antwoord, but the
ass-shaking definitely was. The four dudes
ripped through their BPM-raising "Hangover
(BaBaBa)," but they alone couldn't lead the

dancing tide. It was their booty-clapping
dancer-MC, Blaya, who skyrocketed the tempo
from club to breakneck and put all the waifish
indie girls to shame.

Dizzee Rascal, the self-proclaimed Best
MC in England, only needed a bare stage and

one supporting MC to draw the Treasure
Island population to the Bridge Stage. The
crowd readily responded to the rapper's
instructions to jump and bounce from the get
go, but the show hit perfection after the high
energy, hilariously anti-drug song "Bassline

Junkie." No one could resist the call of the "Big,
dirty, stinkin' bass" a feeling that was sustained
through "Dance Wiv Me" (sadly lacking Calvin
Harris, though the guest singer did nicely) and
the seductive "Holiday."
As a creator, Flying Lotus is a genre-dis
solving mastermind. With the onset of night
over the island, FlyLo shook the island to its
core, sending Shockwaves as far as the Silent
Disco, which was supposed to be, well, silent.
The most electronic of acts, the L.A. producer
alternated between experimental beats and
crowd-pleasers, squinting at his laptop as his
mouth remained locked in a permanent grin.
After spewing out "Robo Tussin," a remix of Lil
Wayne's "A Milli" and mouthing the words to
Tyler The Creator's "Yonkers," Flying Lotus
closed his set with a promise. Find me a house
party tonight in San Francisco, and I'll come
and play free of charge, he said. We're guessing
someone had a good post-TIMF night.
Cut Copy, slotted before fellow
Australians Empire Of The Sun, put on a
show to make the land down under quake.
Fittingly, a school of iridescent jellyfish surged
through the crowd for the nighttime set,

wafting through the exuberant dancers looking
like the poltergeists from the band's second
album, "In Ghost Colours." In his band's
decade of performing, singer Dan Whitford
has transformed from a laptop junkie into a
festival maestro, seen Saturday night in his
double fist pumping and dandy foot stomping
to the "Zonoscope"-dominated set. The ani
mated frontman still looked like a robot in
comparison to Empire of the Sun's diva, Luke
Steele, but the Melbourne electronic quartet
proved that their years of touring have cultured
a tight, synth-pulsing, dance-demanding live
show.

SUNDAY
Annie Clark wasted no time getting into
the meat of St. Vincent's set and jumped
straight into "Surgeon" before the crowd fin
ished cheering her arrival.

"I spent the summer on my back,"

she moaned, then laced her breezy

voice with sharp growls from
her guitar. Fresh off the crit-

ical acclaim for her

Annie Clark of St.
Vincent's:

newest album, "Strange Mercy," Clark packed

more on-stage charisma into her

tiny self than most groups do

into a five-piece band. Her

voice traveled between

breathy and
burly, pulling
the audience in

with the "ah-ah
ah-ah" of
"Cheerleader" and

the lyric simplicity
of "Your Lips Are

Red." Even the

Bros in the audience

and there were
many raised
their arms in

excitement for
"Cruel." Most of
the set sounded
harsher, louder

and a bit crazier than the haze on her album,
and it only made us respect Clark more for

being unafraid to let loose.
Attention, "Stuff White People Like." If you
only get to pick one band, make it The Head
And The Heart. The Seattle-based group's
somewhat-Mumford-somewhat-folksy music
fell at the perfect time of the day: the band, fac
ing east, was framed in the dusty backlighting
of the sun setting over the Bay. You really could
n't have gotten more picturesque if you had
tried.

Dream-pop duo Beach House played in
front of a weird audience, but according to
Victoria Legrand, "Weird isn't a bad thing. It's
a compliment. And y'all are weird." Legrand
spent much of the set enjoying the characters
from the audience who got their 15 seconds of
fame with a cameo on the big screen.
Distracted as she was between sets, Legrand
and guitarist Alex Scally put on a beautiful
show, hitting most of their still-fresh"Teen
Dream." The intense bass drum hits of "10
Mile Stereo" were the perfect transition from
daylight to moonlight on the island.
On the walk toward the Bridge Stage for
Friendly Fires, something didn't seem right. It
was way too quiet on the approach, even with
Ed Macfarlane screaming his larynx out into
the mic. After a song and a half spent in audio
purgatory, the festival's "side" stage received a
quick fix, as the stage-right sound system burst
into life to provide the cure. Warmed up and
backed by the shining San Francisco skyline,
Macfarlane boogied into "Skeleton Boy,"
unafraid of whiplash and apparently fashion

critique (his Hawaiian shirt was terrible).
Popping with energy from Edd Gibson, who
brandished his guitar like a Kalashnikov, to the
funky backing horn players, the trio from St.
Albans, England seemed a Sunday scheduling
mishap, especially with the synth-heavy
"Paris," which would have been right at home
a day before.

There was only one band on everyone's
mind after Sunday at Treasure Island.
Explosions In the Sky are not just superior
songwriters, they are masters of their instru
ments and clearly enjoy nothing more than
sharing their passion with an audience. All three
guitarists had very distinct playing styles and
roles within the songs. Despite having no
singers, Michael James was clearly the front
man, taking the smooth guitar solos and going
all out with his strumming. Munaf Rayani had
the privilege of making the loudest noise of the
entire weekend by simply slapping all the strings
of his guitar to create a sonic boom 10 times

louder than any bass drum. The wall of sound,
though most pronounced during Rayani's

strikes, never ceased for the Austin band. Their
five-member set had every aural and emotional
range covered. Never before were there such
enthusiastic chants for one more song at a festi
val. The only disappointment of their show was
their inability to comply.
Brooklyn rockers The Hold Steady didn't
quite fit in with Sunday's lineup mostly
because they'd have fit in better in 1975.
Unabashedly classic in style and brash in exe
cution, the band spent Sunday evening crash
ing through their hits and pulling out clean
as-a-whistle guitar solos that made the audi
ence feel like they lived in a pre-computer
world.

his significant other a year later, Ben Gibbard
and Death Cab For Cutie marked their return
to the Bay Area with the closing set of this

year's festival. But for a band that put out a
new record, "Codes And Keys," there seemed
to be a certain boredom to it all. Yes, there was
new material to be had and even older materi
al to be dusted off, but the band continued to
play the expected for a particularly unadven
turous set list. Seven full albums into their

careers, DCFC have settled into a comfort

zone that spans "Transatlanticism" and what
ever their newest release is, leaving little room
for experimentation or divergence.
An average Death Cab show, however, is
nothing to be scoffed at. Gibbard still com
manded the stage, whipping his hair back and
forth as he jumped from guitar to piano for "I
Will Possess Your Heart" and "We Looked Like
Giants." Nick Harmer jammed away at his

bass, while Jason McGerr received shout-outs
from his own little fan entourage at the front.
It was enjoyable, but with Monday looming,
some of the crowd had already made its way
toward the shuttles, leaving an Explosions In
the Sky-sized hole at the Main Stage. Stopping
to dance with the jellies on their way ahome,
the early departures made one last salute to
TIMF 2011 before heading off into the night.

alternated between experimental beats and
crowd-pleasers, squinting at his laptop as his
mouth remained locked in a permanent grin.
After spewing out "Robo Tussin," a remix of Lil
Wayne's "A Milli" and mouthing the words to
Tyler The Creator's "Yonkers," Flying Lotus
closed his set with a promise. Find me a house
party tonight in San Francisco, and I'll come
and play free of charge, he said. We're guessing
someone had a good post-TIMF night.
Cut Copy, slotted before fellow
Australians Empire Of The Sun, put on a
show to make the land down under quake.
Fittingly, a school of iridescent jellyfish surged
through the crowd for the nighttime set,

wafting through the exuberant dancers looking
like the poltergeists from the band's second
album, "In Ghost Colours." In his band's
decade of performing, singer Dan Whitford
has transformed from a laptop junkie into a
festival maestro, seen Saturday night in his
double fist pumping and dandy foot stomping
to the "Zonoscope"-dominated set. The ani
mated frontman still looked like a robot in
comparison to Empire of the Sun's diva, Luke
Steele, but the Melbourne electronic quartet
proved that their years of touring have cultured
a tight, synth-pulsing, dance-demanding live
show.

SUNDAY
Annie Clark wasted no time getting into
the meat of St. Vincent's set and jumped
straight into "Surgeon" before the crowd fin
ished cheering her arrival.

"I spent the summer on my back,"

she moaned, then laced her breezy

voice with sharp growls from
her guitar. Fresh off the crit-

ical acclaim for her

Annie Clark of St.
Vincent's:

newest album, "Strange Mercy," Clark packed

more on-stage charisma into her

tiny self than most groups do

into a five-piece band. Her

voice traveled between

breathy and
burly, pulling
the audience in

with the "ah-ah
ah-ah" of
"Cheerleader" and

the lyric simplicity
of "Your Lips Are

Red." Even the

Bros in the audience

and there were
many raised
their arms in

excitement for
"Cruel." Most of
the set sounded
harsher, louder

and a bit crazier than the haze on her album,
and it only made us respect Clark more for

being unafraid to let loose.
Attention, "Stuff White People Like." If you
only get to pick one band, make it The Head
And The Heart. The Seattle-based group's
somewhat-Mumford-somewhat-folksy music
fell at the perfect time of the day: the band, fac
ing east, was framed in the dusty backlighting
of the sun setting over the Bay. You really could
n't have gotten more picturesque if you had
tried.

Dream-pop duo Beach House played in
front of a weird audience, but according to
Victoria Legrand, "Weird isn't a bad thing. It's
a compliment. And y'all are weird." Legrand
spent much of the set enjoying the characters
from the audience who got their 15 seconds of
fame with a cameo on the big screen.
Distracted as she was between sets, Legrand
and guitarist Alex Scally put on a beautiful
show, hitting most of their still-fresh"Teen
Dream." The intense bass drum hits of "10
Mile Stereo" were the perfect transition from
daylight to moonlight on the island.
On the walk toward the Bridge Stage for
Friendly Fires, something didn't seem right. It
was way too quiet on the approach, even with
Ed Macfarlane screaming his larynx out into
the mic. After a song and a half spent in audio
purgatory, the festival's "side" stage received a
quick fix, as the stage-right sound system burst
into life to provide the cure. Warmed up and
backed by the shining San Francisco skyline,
Macfarlane boogied into "Skeleton Boy,"
unafraid of whiplash and apparently fashion

critique (his Hawaiian shirt was terrible).
Popping with energy from Edd Gibson, who
brandished his guitar like a Kalashnikov, to the
funky backing horn players, the trio from St.
Albans, England seemed a Sunday scheduling
mishap, especially with the synth-heavy
"Paris," which would have been right at home
a day before.

There was only one band on everyone's
mind after Sunday at Treasure Island.
Explosions In the Sky are not just superior
songwriters, they are masters of their instru
ments and clearly enjoy nothing more than
sharing their passion with an audience. All three
guitarists had very distinct playing styles and
roles within the songs. Despite having no
singers, Michael James was clearly the front
man, taking the smooth guitar solos and going
all out with his strumming. Munaf Rayani had
the privilege of making the loudest noise of the
entire weekend by simply slapping all the strings
of his guitar to create a sonic boom 10 times

louder than any bass drum. The wall of sound,
though most pronounced during Rayani's

strikes, never ceased for the Austin band. Their
five-member set had every aural and emotional
range covered. Never before were there such
enthusiastic chants for one more song at a festi
val. The only disappointment of their show was
their inability to comply.
Brooklyn rockers The Hold Steady didn't
quite fit in with Sunday's lineup mostly
because they'd have fit in better in 1975.
Unabashedly classic in style and brash in exe
cution, the band spent Sunday evening crash
ing through their hits and pulling out clean
as-a-whistle guitar solos that made the audi
ence feel like they lived in a pre-computer
world.

his significant other a year later, Ben Gibbard
and Death Cab For Cutie marked their return
to the Bay Area with the closing set of this

year's festival. But for a band that put out a
new record, "Codes And Keys," there seemed
to be a certain boredom to it all. Yes, there was
new material to be had and even older materi
al to be dusted off, but the band continued to
play the expected for a particularly unadven
turous set list. Seven full albums into their

careers, DCFC have settled into a comfort

zone that spans "Transatlanticism" and what
ever their newest release is, leaving little room
for experimentation or divergence.
An average Death Cab show, however, is
nothing to be scoffed at. Gibbard still com
manded the stage, whipping his hair back and
forth as he jumped from guitar to piano for "I
Will Possess Your Heart" and "We Looked Like
Giants." Nick Harmer jammed away at his

bass, while Jason McGerr received shout-outs
from his own little fan entourage at the front.
It was enjoyable, but with Monday looming,
some of the crowd had already made its way
toward the shuttles, leaving an Explosions In
the Sky-sized hole at the Main Stage. Stopping
to dance with the jellies on their way ahome,
the early departures made one last salute to
TIMF 2011 before heading off into the night.

Treasure Island Music Festival came to
an iPhone-friendly close last weekend
with a jaw-dropping sunset on Sunday
evening. A testament to the young festival's

flexibility, San Francisco's satellite island sup
ported both an Explosions in the Sky rock con
flagration as well as a nostalgia-inducing tour
with Death Cab for Cutie on its closing night.
Over two days, 26 acts across the musical
slate attracted 25,000 attendees a number
sizable enough to produce a lively atmosphere
and small enough to make the Korean BBQ

line doable. From the primal aggression of
Saturday's sweat-provoking sets to the pure
rock of Sunday, Intermission was on hand to
capture the moments for yearbook posterity.
Treasure Island, you're great; don't ever change.
SATURDAY
To anyone who thought The Naked And
Famous was going to give a shiny pop set:
should have brought earplugs. The band of
Kiwis switched between Passion-Pit-esque

melodies and shredding guitars and touched
on tracks from their only album "Punching
in a Dream" and "The Sun."

The island wasn't prepared to receive the
Portuguese electro-dance crew Buraka Som
Sistema. Repping the progressive kuduro style
(think tribal house), the group whiplashed

curious onlookers into a disjointed, pulsating
frenzy. The lyrics may not have been as aggres
sively lewd as last year's Die Antwoord, but the
ass-shaking definitely was. The four dudes
ripped through their BPM-raising "Hangover
(BaBaBa)," but they alone couldn't lead the

dancing tide. It was their booty-clapping
dancer-MC, Blaya, who skyrocketed the tempo
from club to breakneck and put all the waifish
indie girls to shame.

Dizzee Rascal, the self-proclaimed Best
MC in England, only needed a bare stage and

one supporting MC to draw the Treasure
Island population to the Bridge Stage. The
crowd readily responded to the rapper's
instructions to jump and bounce from the get
go, but the show hit perfection after the high
energy, hilariously anti-drug song "Bassline

Junkie." No one could resist the call of the "Big,
dirty, stinkin' bass" a feeling that was sustained
through "Dance Wiv Me" (sadly lacking Calvin
Harris, though the guest singer did nicely) and
the seductive "Holiday."
As a creator, Flying Lotus is a genre-dis
solving mastermind. With the onset of night
over the island, FlyLo shook the island to its
core, sending Shockwaves as far as the Silent
Disco, which was supposed to be, well, silent.

of the sun setting over the Bay. You really could
n't have gotten more picturesque if you had
tried.

Dream-pop duo Beach House played in
front of a weird audience, but according to
Victoria Legrand, "Weird isn't a bad thing. It's
a compliment. And y'all are weird." Legrand
spent much of the set enjoying the characters
from the audience who got their 15 seconds of
fame with a cameo on the big screen.
Distracted as she was between sets, Legrand
and guitarist Alex Scally put on a beautiful
show, hitting most of their still-fresh"Teen
Dream." The intense bass drum hits of "10
Mile Stereo" were the perfect transition from
daylight to moonlight on the island.
On the walk toward the Bridge Stage for
Friendly Fires, something didn't seem right. It
was way too quiet on the approach, even with
Ed Macfarlane screaming his larynx out into
the mic. After a song and a half spent in audio
purgatory, the festival's "side" stage received a
quick fix, as the stage-right sound system burst
into life to provide the cure. Warmed up and
backed by the shining San Francisco skyline,
Macfarlane boogied into "Skeleton Boy,"
unafraid of whiplash and apparently fashion

critique (his Hawaiian shirt was terrible).
Popping with energy from Edd Gibson, who
brandished his guitar like a Kalashnikov, to the
funky backing horn players, the trio from St.
Albans, England seemed a Sunday scheduling
mishap, especially with the synth-heavy
"Paris," which would have been right at home
a day before.

There was only one band on everyone's
mind after Sunday at Treasure Island.
Explosions In the Sky are not just superior
songwriters, they are masters of their instru
ments and clearly enjoy nothing more than
sharing their passion with an audience. All three
guitarists had very distinct playing styles and
roles within the songs. Despite having no
singers, Michael James was clearly the front
man, taking the smooth guitar solos and going
all out with his strumming. Munaf Rayani had
the privilege of making the loudest noise of the
entire weekend by simply slapping all the strings
of his guitar to create a sonic boom 10 times

louder than any bass drum. The wall of sound,
though most pronounced during Rayani's

strikes, never ceased for the Austin band. Their
five-member set had every aural and emotional
range covered. Never before were there such
enthusiastic chants for one more song at a festi
val. The only disappointment of their show was
their inability to comply.
Brooklyn rockers The Hold Steady didn't
quite fit in with Sunday's lineup mostly
because they'd have fit in better in 1975.
Unabashedly classic in style and brash in exe
cution, the band spent Sunday evening crash
ing through their hits and pulling out clean
as-a-whistle guitar solos that made the audi
ence feel like they lived in a pre-computer
world.

his significant other a year later, Ben Gibbard
and Death Cab For Cutie marked their return
to the Bay Area with the closing set of this

year's festival. But for a band that put out a
new record, "Codes And Keys," there seemed
to be a certain boredom to it all. Yes, there was
new material to be had and even older materi
al to be dusted off, but the band continued to
play the expected for a particularly unadven
turous set list. Seven full albums into their

careers, DCFC have settled into a comfort

zone that spans "Transatlanticism" and what
ever their newest release is, leaving little room
for experimentation or divergence.
An average Death Cab show, however, is
nothing to be scoffed at. Gibbard still com
manded the stage, whipping his hair back and
forth as he jumped from guitar to piano for "I
Will Possess Your Heart" and "We Looked Like
Giants." Nick Harmer jammed away at his

bass, while Jason McGerr received shout-outs
from his own little fan entourage at the front.
It was enjoyable, but with Monday looming,
some of the crowd had already made its way
toward the shuttles, leaving an Explosions In
the Sky-sized hole at the Main Stage. Stopping
to dance with the jellies on their way ahome,
the early departures made one last salute to
TIMF 2011 before heading off into the night.
