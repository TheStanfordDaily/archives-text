As a die-hard Fall Out Boy fan, I was
thrilled that Patrick Stump was coming
out with a solo album. But his new
release, "Soul Punk," sadly falls a little flat. The
problem is inherent in the album's title
Stump attempts to mesh together two very dif
ferent musical styles, soul and punk, but fails to
do so coherently, resulting instead in sheer

cacophony.
To his credit, Stump orchestrated nearly
everything for "Soul Punk" he wrote, played
and produced pretty much every track on the
album but his great talent is obscured by
garish musical clutter at every turn. The album

opens with the high
energy, aptly named
track "Explode," whose
radically different style
serves as a clear indica
tion that this album is
decidedly Stump's, and
not a showcase for Fall
Out Boy 2.0. From this
very first track, howev-

er, it is clear that something is off. The song is
overproduced, with Stump's attempts at creat
ing a groovy vibe turning the song into an
overwhelmingly synth-driven, exceedingly
syncopated burst of noise. It is indeed an
explosion, but not in a good way.
"This City" comes much closer to hitting
the mark, chock full of catchy beats and sport
ing a sing-a-long chorus, though the Lupe
Fiasco remix that closes the album seems
unnecessary. The "punk" is barely evident in
this feel-good piece and in the album as a

whole, mostly surfacing in the sharp irony of
the some of the lyrics.

The next track, "Dance Miserable," is
another example of the album's incoherence;
the jarring percussion clashing horribly with
Stump's soulful wailing. "Spotlight" is a shim
mery tune with an infectious beat that could
have been Stump's redeeming song, had it not
all come crashing down again with the next
song, "The T in Lie."

"Whatever this is, it doesn't feel right','
Stump sings in this Fall Out Boy-esque titled
track," lt might have felt good for a minute, hut
admit it to yourself it ain't right" Though he
was singing about the immorality of an illicit
affair, these lyrics may well have been about
the album itself. This "soul punk" genre
Stump is trying to champion has so much

potential, but isn't executed well here at all.
The heavy synth-beats and dance rhythms
crowd out Stump's soulful runs and forays

into falsetto in nearly every track. The best
part of the entire album is Stump's utterly
unique voice, but it is drowned out by busy
backdrops and distracting disco effects.
This trend continues throughout the rest

of the album, with the songs getting progres
sively more filled with junk. For instance, "Run
Dry (X Heart X Fingers)" starts off promising
ly with an a cappella, echoey intro in the style
of Fall Out Boy. Eight long minutes later,

though, the song itself seems to have "run dry,"
breaking down into little more than white
noise for the last painful minute of the piece.
"Allie" may be the album's best song, with a

much more subdued backing track that allows
Stump's vocals to shine through, if only for a
brief moment of respite.

We can only hope that Stump meant what
he said in the title of the album's penultimate
track, "Coast (It's Gonna Get Better)." There is
no disputing Stump's immense musical talent
he just needs to refine his sound and let his
voice do the talking rather than trying to jazz
his songs up with unnecessary clutter.
