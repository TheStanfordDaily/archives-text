# Spoil me, baby

For better or for worse, my gener
ation is afflicted with extreme
spoiler-phobia. You know the

feeling: one moment, you're having an
innocent chat with a friend or catch
ing up with Twitter. Then suddenly
our spoiler-sense tingles, sending us
cringing into an eyes-shut, ears-cov
ered fetal position. For some, it's a

pretty powerful force. I have friends
who regularly go into a total media
blackout every holiday season just to
avoid catching a glimpse they'd rather
forget.

Spoilers are hardly a vice, but
they have the same tantalizing appeal.
As someone who peruses the Web for
game info on an almost hourly basis, I
often find myself just one click away
from getting that little endorphin hit
with a leaked cutscene or an interview
that went too far. After years of wait
ing for even a morsel of info on
games like Skyward Sword or Skyrim,

it's an internal battle that I struggle to
win.
But what if I told you that spoil
ing a game could actually make it
better*.
As a psych major, I was both
skeptical and intrigued when I read a
Science Daily article suggesting exact
ly that. To be fair, the study in ques
tion wasn't exclusively about games.
But even so, its implications seem
neatly extendable to the Uncharteds
and Mass Effects of the world.
This is probably the boring part
for most of you, so I'll make the
explanation brief. The study was con
ducted at UC-San Diego by Nicholas
Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt,
who presented one of 12 short stories
to two separate groups. The stories,
mostly classics from the likes of John
Updike and Agatha Christie, were cat
egorized as either "ironic-twist," "mys
tery" or "literary." One set of subjects
saw an introductory para
graph that essentially
spoiled the plot, while the

other group read the same story with
the plot-spoiling paragraph inserted
at some point later on.
Incredibly, a majority of test sub
jects preferred the spoiled versions of
the stories.
Looking at the results,
Christenfeld extrapolates that "plots
are just excuses for great writing.
What the plot is is (almost) irrelevant.
The pleasure is in the writing."
Bringing that a little closer to
gamer lingo, you might say that it
doesn't particularly matter where a
story is taking a player, but rather how
we get there.
Leavitt's explanation sings the
same tune, as the doctoral student
says it's "cognitively easier" to focus on
a deeper understanding of the story
once you how it turns out.
For some games and indeed,
for some gamers — I think I can
agree. In their most pure, traditional
form, video games don't so much
present a player with a story or even
allow them to influence it with fully

realized feedback, a la Dragon Age:
Origins. The stark presentation of
games like the original Zelda, Metroid
or even the very modern Limbo give
players only the most basic rudiments
of context and purpose. By necessity,
the storytelling becomes an active and
internal process unique to each play
er; in some ways, it's the opposite of
how each reader's personal version of
Middle Earth looks a little different.
With each action, the player con
structs an evolving framework of how
the game world operates and what
motivates its characters.
But if you spoil a game like that,

through the game with their mind at ease,
passively sorting everything they see into the
"correct" mental bucket. It's not for everyone,
but I can see the appeal of that.
Looking back a couple years, I think
Bio Ware's marketing department was well
aware of that concept when it was ramping up
excitement for Mass Effect 2. (Pardon the ironic
spoiler warning here.) Casey Hudson & Co.

made it plenty clear that Commander Shepard
would embark on a "suicide mission" by game's
end, a proclamation that angered many gamers.
But regardless, Bio Ware's marketing strategy
may have actually heightened the tension

players felt in the already dramatic and non
linear space opera.
Not all games are so open-ended,
though. When a rollercoaster thrill-ride like
Modern Warfare 3 has its plot leaked moths
ahead of release, it can legitimately ruin some
of the one-off surprises that make the game
so entertaining.
Ultimately, gamers need to manage their
own exposure to spoilers. But we should
remember that games
today allow for an incredi-

ble diaspora of experiences,
and not all of them are

necessarily enhanced by going in blind. This
study might say a "spoiler warning" is noth
ing to worry about, but as for me, I think I'll
still find myself fighting the urge to scroll
down next time I come across those terrify
ing, seductive words.

form, video games don't so much
present a player with a story or even
allow them to influence it with fully

realized feedback, a la Dragon Age:
Origins. The stark presentation of
games like the original Zelda, Metroid
or even the very modern Limbo give
players only the most basic rudiments
of context and purpose. By necessity,
the storytelling becomes an active and
internal process unique to each play
er; in some ways, it's the opposite of
how each reader's personal version of
Middle Earth looks a little different.
With each action, the player con
structs an evolving framework of how
the game world operates and what
motivates its characters.
But if you spoil a game like that,

through the game with their mind at ease,
passively sorting everything they see into the
"correct" mental bucket. It's not for everyone,
but I can see the appeal of that.
Looking back a couple years, I think
Bio Ware's marketing department was well
aware of that concept when it was ramping up
excitement for Mass Effect 2. (Pardon the ironic
spoiler warning here.) Casey Hudson & Co.

made it plenty clear that Commander Shepard
would embark on a "suicide mission" by game's
end, a proclamation that angered many gamers.
But regardless, Bio Ware's marketing strategy
may have actually heightened the tension

players felt in the already dramatic and non
linear space opera.
Not all games are so open-ended,
though. When a rollercoaster thrill-ride like
Modern Warfare 3 has its plot leaked moths
ahead of release, it can legitimately ruin some
of the one-off surprises that make the game
so entertaining.
Ultimately, gamers need to manage their
own exposure to spoilers. But we should
remember that games
today allow for an incredi-

ble diaspora of experiences,
and not all of them are

necessarily enhanced by going in blind. This
study might say a "spoiler warning" is noth
ing to worry about, but as for me, I think I'll
still find myself fighting the urge to scroll
down next time I come across those terrify
ing, seductive words.
