## THE 						'COMMUNITY' CONTINUUM 
### – aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. ed 
People tend to group all
"Community" episodes into
one of two categories: high
energy genre parodies, like the

paintball episodes or the stop
motion Christmas episode, and the
regular old sitcom episodes. And
while it doesn't hurt to group the
episodes this way, I think it's a gross
oversimplification. What makes
"Community" one of my favorite
shows on television is the way it
manages to cover such a broad
spectrum of stories. While last

year's critically-acclaimed bottle
episode "Cooperative Calligraphy"
was high-concept, is it really the
same kind of episode as the paint
ball episodes? Even "Advanced
Dungeons and Dragons" is a fairly
straight genre parody, but it uses

the genre in a much more ground
ed, emotional way than, say, the
"Apollo 11" parody in "Basic
Rocket Science."
In my opinion, the best
episodes of the series are the ones
that find a comfortable place in the
middle of that continuum; they're
guided by some high concept, but
motivated by the characters them
selves. It's not that the genre paro
dies aren't fun, but it's easy for the
sound of paintballs firing to drown
out the characters themselves.
That's why when I talk about my
favorite episodes, season one's
paintball episode "Modern

Warfare" doesn't make it onto the
list as it does for many other
"Community" fans. I'll take
episodes like "Paradigms of
Human Memory" which parodied
sitcom clip episodes, and last
week's "Remedial Chaos Theory"
any day.
Now, "Remedial Chaos
Theory" is the type of episode that
falls squarely in the middle of the
"Community" continuum. It's
high-concept —a single dice roll at
Troy and Abed's housewarming
party causes the timeline to frag
ment into seven different stories
but it's more about how the differ
ent combinations of characters

interact in each of the split time
lines than the split itself. In fact, it
blends the elements together so

well that many people consider it
the best episode of "Community"
While I don't necessarily agree, I'm
not sure I could point to an
episode that's done a better job of
showing the group's dynamic.
It was also exciting to see the
beginning of the power struggle
show runner Dan Harmon has

been promising between Troy and
Jeff. People have been making a lot
of the fact that the "darkest, most
terrible" timeline (the one where
Pierce died, Jeff lost an arm and
Britta got a wash-away blue streak
in her hair) happened when Troy
wasn't with the study group; only a

few have been pointing out that it
was his over-eagerness that kicked
off the traumatic chain reaction.
It's easy to criticize Jeff for being
too aloof, but everyone just sees
Troy's childish traits as adorable.
Troy's birthday episode last year
was a big step for him, but even if
he insists he's a man, is he really
ready to be a leader?
The real leader that emerged
was Abed. After all, he's the one

who gave the Jeff-style speech at
the end of the episode. And when
he was gone, the entire group
devolved in to squabbling. I'm not
sure if it's a misdirection, or maybe
I'm reading too much into it, but it
seems like there's something there.
Of course, on top of all of this
analysis of story and characteriza
tion, the episode is just a lot of fun.
The recurring jokes that character
ize a lot of "Community's" humor
play out perfectly across multiple
timelines, and the ridiculous

depths to which the dark timeline
sink are probably the funniest esca
lation since the conspiracy theories
episode last year.
While I didn't have as many
problems with the first few
episodes of the season as most
people did, I'll admit that it stuck a
bit too close to the sitcom end of
the spectrum (Chang's noir story
being the exception). If they can
continue to write episodes that bal
ance the two sides of the show this
well, then there's no telling where
the study group will go this year.
