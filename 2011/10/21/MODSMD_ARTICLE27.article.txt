## ROXY SASS eyes on ALUMNI 
### 
Homecoming. This weekend's
big event has one of Roxy's
favorite words packaged
right in, so it's already doing some
thing right for her. And while some
of you might like 69 as a position,
Roxy prefers '69 as a vintage. Like the
classy pornography of yesteryear or
an old bottle of Merlot, lovers get

better with age. So as our predeces
sors enjoy hors d'oeuvre under those
white tents, Roxy suggests you bring
some of that sausage (or sushi) back
under the sheets. But Roxy knows
that it takes a little work to turn
innuendo into in-yo-end-o, so she
thought all you cubs and kittens
might want a little help landing a
cougar or sugar daddy.
Before you blow your target,
you need to know your target. When
dealing with an older generation,
being "cocky" won't get you as far as
you'd hope. For all the boots Roxy's
knocked in her time on the Farm,
she knows that lower class years
mean higher experience. You might
be riding the momentum of your
frat-fueled descent from high school
innocence, but for that studly gentle
man with the silver streaks or the
scorched-blond MILF passing you
winks, carnal is banal. It might
sound intimidating, especially since
Roxy wears her horny little heart on
her sleeve (even if she isn't wearing
much else).
Another word of warning: You'll
likely be going for sober prey in
broad daylight, two factors that Roxy
isn't used to from her dark, sweaty
nights on Sigma Nu's beer-coated
dance floor. Roxy knows it takes
some work to make that scene sexy,
but don't fall back on your tried-

and-true pickup line of "nice shoes,
wanna fuck?" You'll need something
classier for the class of 'B6, especially
sans-drank. (But Roxy still likes to

pregame her homecoming tent-raid
ing, just to take the edge off.)
But fear not, young hunters. You
may be a fish out of water this week
end, but these alluring alumni will
never feel more in their element.
They were Stanford students once,
after all and nothing gets those
hormones flowing like a trip back to
the old stomping grounds (if
"stomping" is what you want to call
it). Roxy is usually the one making
the moves, but sometimes it's best to
just let someone else take over. So
turn on your cougar-radar or sugar
daddy-sonar, practice your innocent
smile and let those home-comers go
to work. And who knows? When
Roxy's back in bed, those aged-to
perfection lovers might even show
her a few new tricks.
Come on home, baby.

If you're a jobless alumni still looking
for something to do, drop Roxy a line
