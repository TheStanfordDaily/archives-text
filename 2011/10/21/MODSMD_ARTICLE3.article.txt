# Shaw a better coach
## 
### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
One year ago today,
gun to your head,
you're forced to
make a decision:
Andrew Luck or
Jim Harbaugh? The one you pick
stays, while the other ventures into
the depths of the NFL, destined to
appear only on Sundays and in
Ugg commercials.
I would have chosen Jim. You
would have, too.
I'm smart enough to know that
you don't go to the Vatican and
criticize the pope, nor do you
admit to the Stanford community
that you would choose any tangi
ble thing in the universe over An
drew Luck. So let me explain.
One year ago, I was drunk off
the Harbaugh Kool-Aid. I was
fully on board with the hard-nosed
approach, the yelling, the rescuing
the team from a 1-11 season, the
domination of USC, the sweater,
etc. So were you. Keeping Jim
away from the NFL was (at the
time) undoubtedly the only way to
sustain Stanford's success. You
could hear a pin drop in Stanford
Stadium during 2009, the Cardi
nal's first winning season in years.
If Harbaugh left and the team sub
sequently imploded, pins would be
able to hear pins drop.

Luck was, to me, more of a
short-term luxury because he had
to leave. There was no option, no
contract negotiation, no $50,000
bathrooms. With Luck, there was
the potential for a national cham
pionship the following season. I
wanted the potential for multiple
national championships. Har
baugh could provide that. Luck
could not.

One year later, it took the lift
ing of a shirt and an aggressive
handshake to remember that
Stanford had actually lost what
was once called the best thing to
have ever happened to the foot
ball program. And as much as that
has to do with the magical work of
Luck, it has even more to do with
new head coach David Shaw.
Have you heard of him?
Maybe not, but he's answered
every lingering question and then
some with very few words.
The offense? It lost three line
men, its two best receivers and the
best fullback in the nation. This
season, it's averaging nearly 46
points per game, good enough for
fifth in the country. But Shaw was
the offensive coordinator and in
herited the best player in the na
tion, so it's not that impressive.
The defense? It just ranks fifth
in the nation, second behind only
Alabama against the run. Remem
ber when Harbaugh brought Vic
Fangio, Stanford's defensive archi
tect, with him to San Francisco?
Remember when Shayne Skov,

the team's star middle linebacker
and arguably second best player
next to Luck, went down with a
knee injury less than three games
into this season? Remember how
this was the ultimate derailment to
the Card's championship aspira
tions? How quickly we forget.
Shaw, in what he calls his dream
job, says all the right things and
makes all the right adjustments. At
halftime against Washington State
this past week, after 30 minutes of
the worst football that Stanford
has played in well over a season, a
vicious hit that sidelined Chris
Owusu and a slew of questionable
calls, Shaw collected his team and
redesigned the offensive game
plan. Stanford won by 30.
Harbaugh did great things for
this school, don't get me wrong,

but there were always whispers of
discontent among his players that
his intentions weren't always the
best. I'm not sure I disagree. He
has always been an NFL coach
from an NFL family, and I'm
thrilled he used Stanford as the
platform from which to launch his
career.
But witnessing a new style of
coaching, one that prefers to be
seen rather than heard, has
brought with it the realization that
Harbaugh's methods aren't suit
able for the college ranks. Shaw's
are, and it's why Stanford is poised
for sustained success. Recruiting
hasn't taken a hit, another BCS
run is in order and concern is back
where it belongs: life after Luck.
The clincher for me happened
after the game against Wazzu.
Shaw was asked about the hit on
Owusu, a play he intensely con
tested on the sidelines. His re
sponse?
"A couple of years ago, he prob
ably would have been listed as a
mild concussion because he wasn't
unconscious. Back in the old days,
he would have gone back in the sec
ond half. We're not in that era any
more."
Such simple, overlooked re
sponses like this provide such
great insight into his coaching pri
orities. Players first, winning sec
ond, career a very distant third.
Today, no gun in sight, I'm
choosing David Shaw, and it's not
even close.

Zach Zimmerman will never forget
the day he was thrown out of Har
baugh's $50,000 bathroom. Send
him the location of an equally luxu
rious toilet at zachz@stanford.edu.

"Shaw...
says all the
right things
and makes all
the right
adjustments."

that you would choose any tangi
ble thing in the universe over An
drew Luck. So let me explain.
One year ago, I was drunk off
the Harbaugh Kool-Aid. I was
fully on board with the hard-nosed
approach, the yelling, the rescuing
the team from a 1-11 season, the
domination of USC, the sweater,
etc. So were you. Keeping Jim
away from the NFL was (at the
time) undoubtedly the only way to
sustain Stanford's success. You
could hear a pin drop in Stanford
Stadium during 2009, the Cardi
nal's first winning season in years.
If Harbaugh left and the team sub
sequently imploded, pins would be
able to hear pins drop.

Luck was, to me, more of a
short-term luxury because he had
to leave. There was no option, no
contract negotiation, no $50,000
bathrooms. With Luck, there was
the potential for a national cham
pionship the following season. I
wanted the potential for multiple
national championships. Har
baugh could provide that. Luck
could not.

One year later, it took the lift
ing of a shirt and an aggressive
handshake to remember that
Stanford had actually lost what
was once called the best thing to
have ever happened to the foot
ball program. And as much as that
has to do with the magical work of
Luck, it has even more to do with
new head coach David Shaw.
Have you heard of him?
Maybe not, but he's answered
every lingering question and then
some with very few words.
The offense? It lost three line
men, its two best receivers and the
best fullback in the nation. This
season, it's averaging nearly 46
points per game, good enough for
fifth in the country. But Shaw was
the offensive coordinator and in
herited the best player in the na
tion, so it's not that impressive.
The defense? It just ranks fifth
in the nation, second behind only
Alabama against the run. Remem
ber when Harbaugh brought Vic
Fangio, Stanford's defensive archi
tect, with him to San Francisco?
Remember when Shayne Skov,

the team's star middle linebacker
and arguably second best player
next to Luck, went down with a
knee injury less than three games
into this season? Remember how
this was the ultimate derailment to
the Card's championship aspira
tions? How quickly we forget.
Shaw, in what he calls his dream
job, says all the right things and
makes all the right adjustments. At
halftime against Washington State
this past week, after 30 minutes of
the worst football that Stanford
has played in well over a season, a
vicious hit that sidelined Chris
Owusu and a slew of questionable
calls, Shaw collected his team and
redesigned the offensive game
plan. Stanford won by 30.
Harbaugh did great things for
this school, don't get me wrong,

but there were always whispers of
discontent among his players that
his intentions weren't always the
best. I'm not sure I disagree. He
has always been an NFL coach
from an NFL family, and I'm
thrilled he used Stanford as the
platform from which to launch his
career.
But witnessing a new style of
coaching, one that prefers to be
seen rather than heard, has
brought with it the realization that
Harbaugh's methods aren't suit
able for the college ranks. Shaw's
are, and it's why Stanford is poised
for sustained success. Recruiting
hasn't taken a hit, another BCS
run is in order and concern is back
where it belongs: life after Luck.
The clincher for me happened
after the game against Wazzu.
Shaw was asked about the hit on
Owusu, a play he intensely con
tested on the sidelines. His re
sponse?
"A couple of years ago, he prob
ably would have been listed as a
mild concussion because he wasn't
unconscious. Back in the old days,
he would have gone back in the sec
ond half. We're not in that era any
more."
Such simple, overlooked re
sponses like this provide such
great insight into his coaching pri
orities. Players first, winning sec
ond, career a very distant third.
Today, no gun in sight, I'm
choosing David Shaw, and it's not
even close.

Zach Zimmerman will never forget
the day he was thrown out of Har
baugh's $50,000 bathroom. Send
him the location of an equally luxu
rious toilet at zachz@stanford.edu.

"Shaw...
says all the
right things
and makes all
the right
adjustments."
