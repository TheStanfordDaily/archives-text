# Shaw a better coach

### Zach Zimmerman Dishing the Rock 
One year ago today,
gun to your head,
you're forced to
make a decision:
Andrew Luck or
Jim Harbaugh? The one you pick
stays, while the other ventures into
the depths of the NFL, destined to
appear only on Sundays and in
Ugg commercials.
I would have chosen Jim. You
would have, too.
I'm smart enough to know that
you don't go to the Vatican and
criticize the pope, nor do you
admit to the Stanford community
that you would choose any tangi
ble thing in the universe over An
drew Luck. So let me explain.
One year ago, I was drunk off
the Harbaugh Kool-Aid. I was
fully on board with the hard-nosed
approach, the yelling, the rescuing
the team from a 1-11 season, the
domination of USC, the sweater,
etc. So were you. Keeping Jim
away from the NFL was (at the
time) undoubtedly the only way to
sustain Stanford's success. You
could hear a pin drop in Stanford
Stadium during 2009, the Cardi
nal's first winning season in years.
If Harbaugh left and the team sub
sequently imploded, pins would be
able to hear pins drop.
