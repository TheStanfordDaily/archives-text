# ROAD TESTS AHEAD
## 
### ISABEL SOSA 
After Stanford's close win over Oregon State at Cagan Sta
dium last Sunday, the men's soccer team is riding on a precari
ous, but nonetheless important wave of momentum up north
for tonight's match against Washington. In an interesting turn
of Pac-12 scheduling, Stanford (4-7-2,1-3-1 Pac-12) will take on
the Huskies and Beavers for the second time in two weeks, this
time on rival turf.

The Cardinal's performance on the road hasn't been very
promising so far this season Stanford is 0-5 in road matches
and has yet to score a goal. However, if the team can capitalize
on its offensive opportunities against Washington (8-3-2,3-2-0
Pac-12), it may be able to secure at least one of the two positive
results it needs to qualify for the postseason.

In its last encounter with the Huskies, the Cardinal conced
ed two goals, one of them to Washington midfielder Jacob
Hustedt. Coach Bret Simon noted that the transfer from Cal
Poly was a tough matchup for Stanford.
"Washington has some exceptional players," Simon said.
"We just have to do a little better job of finding their No. 8
(Hustedt) and defending him."

Several months into the season, the physical demands of
the season have also started to become a key factor, with sev
eral players noting that everyone is feeling the effects of a
long season.

"Wear and tear on the body has had a price to pay for the
players on the team," Simon said.

And redshirt senior Garrett
Gunther, who authored two
goals including the game
winner on Sunday and
added an assist in the Cardi
nal's 3-2 victory, agrees that it
can be "taxing on the body to
play so many minutes and take
so many hits." But he acknowl
edged that bumps and bruises
are par for the course in the
brutal Pac-12, and no team
comes out unscathed.
At the very least, Stanford
comes to the table with a slight
ly more promising past against
Oregon State (3-8-2,1-3-1). On
Sunday, the Cardinal proved
that if it can exploit its offen
sive chances, it can hold a lead.

consecutive goals in a matter of

GAME NOTES: After a slow start, this
game is all the more important for a
Cardinal squad that still has hopes of
an NCAA Tournament bid. Last
week, Stanford fell short to the
Huskies 2-0 at home, so the
Cardinal may struggle tonight to get
its first road win of the season.

extra games down the stretch if they want to keep their NCAA Tournament hopes alive.
Stanford has yet to win a road game and faces two challenging ones this weekend.

seconds, shortening what started as a three-goal lead
into a tight 3-2 match by the 25th minute on Sunday,
the team buckled down and had few difficulties as the
game wore on.
Furthermore, the Beavers have lost five out of the
six conference games they've hosted this season, point
ing to a potential reversion of the typical home-team
advantage that has thus far confounded the Cardinal
away from the Farm. And both goals came off of very
nice individual plays by Oregon State junior Colin
Mitchell, whom Simon said the team just needs to slow
down more effectively.
"[Mitchell] is a very dynamic player," Simon said.
"Fle's someone we have to pay tighter attention to."
On the whole, however, Simon suggested that fa
miliarity with both teams will play a decisive hand in
this weekend's matches.
"We know the teams very well, and they know us, so
we just have to make some adjustments," he said.
Gunther figures to play heavily into those adjust
ments, as he has been a critical figure in the offensive line

up. Simon praised his considerable growth over the
course of the season, and noted that his two-footed dis
tress gives him flexibility to play on both sides of the field.

Senior Alexander Binnie, who headed home a Gun
ther cross for the second goal of the match against the
Beavers, is also very effective playing with either foot.
"It's really nice when both wingers work together,"
Binnie said.

Despite its most recent victory, the men's team still
has to overcome a notable challenge this weekend. But
the Cardinal can't afford to lose any more points in
order to play its way into the NCAA Tournament in
November. Garrett believes the team is primed for the
rematches.

"We just have to take what we learned from Ore
gon State and use it against Washington," he said.
Friday's match is scheduled for 7 p.m. in Seattle,
with the team moving on to face Oregon State on Sun
day afternoon in Corvallis, Ore, at 2:30 p.m.
