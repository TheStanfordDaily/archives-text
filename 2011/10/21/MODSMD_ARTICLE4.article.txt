# ROAD TESTS AHEAD
## 
### ISABEL SOSA 
After Stanford's close win over Oregon State at Cagan Sta
dium last Sunday, the men's soccer team is riding on a precari
ous, but nonetheless important wave of momentum up north
for tonight's match against Washington. In an interesting turn
of Pac-12 scheduling, Stanford (4-7-2,1-3-1 Pac-12) will take on
the Huskies and Beavers for the second time in two weeks, this
time on rival turf.

The Cardinal's performance on the road hasn't been very
promising so far this season Stanford is 0-5 in road matches
and has yet to score a goal. However, if the team can capitalize
on its offensive opportunities against Washington (8-3-2,3-2-0
Pac-12), it may be able to secure at least one of the two positive
results it needs to qualify for the postseason.

In its last encounter with the Huskies, the Cardinal conced
ed two goals, one of them to Washington midfielder Jacob
Hustedt. Coach Bret Simon noted that the transfer from Cal
Poly was a tough matchup for Stanford.
"Washington has some exceptional players," Simon said.
"We just have to do a little better job of finding their No. 8
(Hustedt) and defending him."

Several months into the season, the physical demands of
the season have also started to become a key factor, with sev
eral players noting that everyone is feeling the effects of a
long season.

"Wear and tear on the body has had a price to pay for the
players on the team," Simon said.

And redshirt senior Garrett
Gunther, who authored two
goals including the game
winner on Sunday and
added an assist in the Cardi
nal's 3-2 victory, agrees that it
can be "taxing on the body to
play so many minutes and take
so many hits." But he acknowl
edged that bumps and bruises
are par for the course in the
brutal Pac-12, and no team
comes out unscathed.
At the very least, Stanford
comes to the table with a slight
ly more promising past against
Oregon State (3-8-2,1-3-1). On
Sunday, the Cardinal proved
that if it can exploit its offen
sive chances, it can hold a lead.

GAME NOTES: After a slow start, this
game is all the more important for a
Cardinal squad that still has hopes of
an NCAA Tournament bid. Last
week, Stanford fell short to the
Huskies 2-0 at home, so the
Cardinal may struggle tonight to get
its first road win of the season.
