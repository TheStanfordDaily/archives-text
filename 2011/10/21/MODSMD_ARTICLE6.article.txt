## Full Red Zone causes headaches Record attendance at games means long lines 
### DANIELLE LUSSIER KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
The new online football ticket
reservation system has resulted in
rushes to secure tickets and long
standby lines at the stadium come
game day, according to Athletics
Marketing Associate Kevin Aha.
This change came as a result of
increasing interest in Stanford foot
ball, as student attendance is esti
mated to be at the highest it has
reached in recent history, Aha said.
The high attendance is due, in
part, to the new Red Zone ticket
system in which students must re
serve tickets prior to game day, ac
cording to Aha, who managed most
of the new program.
"Average attendance will be
higher than any year in recent histo
ry," Aha said. "The demand is a
function of campus recognition of
how special this team is, and the
ticketing system is more a function
of that demand."

Aha reported that for the Oct. 1
UCLA game, 47 percent of under
graduate students and 17 percent of
graduate students scanned into the
stadium. For the Oct. 8 Colorado
game, 50.1 percent of undergradu
ate students and 12.84 percent of
graduate students scanned in.
At the beginning of the school
year, the Red Zone sent out an
email with an instructional video
announcing the new procedure,
showing step by step how to claim a
ticket. The video and Red Zone
website instructed students to log in
to their Red Zone accounts on
GoStanford.com and reserve a tick
et, which would be loaded onto
their student ID cards. Students re

ceive a predetermined number of
Red Zone Loyalty Points for scan
ning into each home game and se
lect other sporting events.

However, the Red Zone website
has crashed several times when
tickets have been released, frustrat
ing students trying to use the serv
ice. Tyler White 'l3 attended both
games so far, but only had a re
served ticket for the Colorado
game.

"If you look at the people having
to stake out at 9 p.m. or 5 p.m. and sit
by their computers and refresh in
cessantly, just hoping to get their
hands on one ticket, then every sin
gle time there always ends up being
people who want to go who can't
go," White said.
According to the site, tickets to
the games against Oregon and
Berkeley will be released based on
the number of Red Zone Loyalty
Points students have.

"The more points you have, the
earlier in the week you can get the
tickets," Aha said. "We're not sure
where that [number] will fall yet."
The ticket claiming process orig
inally began on the Tuesday prior to
a Saturday home game at 5 p.m.
In the first implementation for
the Oct. 1 game against UCLA,
tickets for the event sold out within
five hours after they were released,
Aha said.
Aha received feedback from stu
dents that the 5 p.m. ticket release
conflicted with athletics and aca
demics, effectively "freezing them
out" from claiming tickets later in
the evening. He changed the release
time to 9 p.m. for all subsequent
games.

Tickets for the Oct. 8 Colorado
game "lasted until about noon the
next day," Aha said. And Red Zone
