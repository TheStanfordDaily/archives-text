## Full Red Zone causes headaches Record attendance at games means long lines 
### DANIELLE LUSSIER KRISTIAN DAVIS BAILEY 
The new online football ticket
reservation system has resulted in
rushes to secure tickets and long
standby lines at the stadium come
game day, according to Athletics
Marketing Associate Kevin Aha.
This change came as a result of
increasing interest in Stanford foot
ball, as student attendance is esti
mated to be at the highest it has
reached in recent history, Aha said.
The high attendance is due, in
part, to the new Red Zone ticket
system in which students must re
serve tickets prior to game day, ac
cording to Aha, who managed most
of the new program.
"Average attendance will be
higher than any year in recent histo
ry," Aha said. "The demand is a
function of campus recognition of
how special this team is, and the
ticketing system is more a function
of that demand."

Aha reported that for the Oct. 1
UCLA game, 47 percent of under
graduate students and 17 percent of
graduate students scanned into the
stadium. For the Oct. 8 Colorado
game, 50.1 percent of undergradu
ate students and 12.84 percent of
graduate students scanned in.
At the beginning of the school
year, the Red Zone sent out an
email with an instructional video
announcing the new procedure,
showing step by step how to claim a
ticket. The video and Red Zone
website instructed students to log in
to their Red Zone accounts on
GoStanford.com and reserve a tick
et, which would be loaded onto
their student ID cards. Students re

ceive a predetermined number of
Red Zone Loyalty Points for scan
ning into each home game and se
lect other sporting events.

However, the Red Zone website
has crashed several times when
tickets have been released, frustrat
ing students trying to use the serv
ice. Tyler White 'l3 attended both
games so far, but only had a re
served ticket for the Colorado
game.

"If you look at the people having
to stake out at 9 p.m. or 5 p.m. and sit
by their computers and refresh in
cessantly, just hoping to get their
hands on one ticket, then every sin
gle time there always ends up being
people who want to go who can't
go," White said.
According to the site, tickets to
the games against Oregon and
Berkeley will be released based on
the number of Red Zone Loyalty
Points students have.

"The more points you have, the
earlier in the week you can get the
tickets," Aha said. "We're not sure
where that [number] will fall yet."
The ticket claiming process orig
inally began on the Tuesday prior to
a Saturday home game at 5 p.m.
In the first implementation for
the Oct. 1 game against UCLA,
tickets for the event sold out within
five hours after they were released,
Aha said.
Aha received feedback from stu
dents that the 5 p.m. ticket release
conflicted with athletics and aca
demics, effectively "freezing them
out" from claiming tickets later in
the evening. He changed the release
time to 9 p.m. for all subsequent
games.

Tickets for the Oct. 8 Colorado
game "lasted until about noon the
next day," Aha said. And Red Zone

Students celebrate victory at USC game last year in Stanford Stadium. The University has altered its ticket system to
accomodate increased interest in Cardinal football. All student tickets have been claimed every game this season.
Washington sold out by 10 a.m.
Wednesday morning, after being
available for 13 hours, Aha wrote in
an email to The Daily.
Annika Grangaard 'l2 currently
participates in Gaieties, a group for
which rehearsals run from 8 p.m. to
11 p.m. on Tuesdays.
"At 9 p.m., rehearsal literally
stops so people can get their tick
ets," she said.
Students who do not claim a
ticket beforehand have the option
to wait in a standby line at Gate 3 of
Stanford Stadium prior to kickoff.
After kickoff, students are let in de
pending on the number of un
claimed reserved student seats.
For the UCLA game, Aha said,
"everyone who came to the game,
regardless of whether or not you
got a ticket in advance or you were
in the standby line, everyone got in
[sic]." This was true for the Col
orado game as well. Aha said.
White said his opinion of the
new policy changed with knowl
edge of this information, but said he
"[thinks] that there should be a bet
ter way for a Stanford student to be
able to go to a Stanford football
game."
"The fact of the matter is that if
you go and wait in the standby line,
you don't get admitted until 10,15
minutes in and you end up automat
ically getting the worst seats in the
stadium," he said. "I don't think I
would ever desire to plan my day

around standing in standby line
when all my friends are able to get
in with tickets."

The size of Stanford Stadium is
the main limitation for letting in
students, Aha said.

"Capacity and safety issues are
limiting factors in terms of the sec
tions we make available," Aha said.
"We want to get as many students
as we can in the game while also pri

oritizing safety and our capacity re
strictions."
To accommodate the increased
interest and attendance among stu
dents, the Red Zone sections in
Stanford Stadium have been ex
panded, Aha said. The Red Zone
now stretches from section 111
through 102.
Grangaard "has noticed that the
Red Zone is a lot fuller," and has a

lot more spirit. "More people stay
for the whole game instead of leav
ing after a little while," she said.
"Student attendance has gotten
a lot better since when I got here,"
said defensive tackle Terence
Stephens 'l3. "It's good to see
it's kind of a culture change to see
people wanting to attend football
games and wanting to support their
team."

Stephens commented that the
team does notice student fans from
the sidelines and from the field.
"It's definitely inspirational to
see support from the student body,"
Stephens said.
