## Study says new doctors not taught LGBT issues 
### ROBIN CHIN 
American medical schools are
lacking LGBT-related health cur
riculum, according to a new study
published by the Stanford School of
Medicine, A survey of 132 schools
discovered that medical students
spend a median total of five hours
studying LGBT-related issues.
The study was published in early
September by members of the Les
bian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgen
der Medical Education Research
Group (LGBT MERG). Deans
from medical schools in the United
States and Canada were surveyed
on topics such as length of class
room time devoted to LGBT-relat
ed issues and adequacy of material.
Dr. Juno Obedin-Maliver, an
08-GYN resident at UCSF and
the primary author of the study,
said that most of the five hours
were taught during the preclinical
or classroom years. One-third of
the schools surveyed had zero ex
posure to LGBT issues in the clini
cal years.

"These issues are primarily
about patient-relation skills," Obe
din-Maliver said. "Taking care of
patients is not just about knowl
edge it's also about learning
how to interact with patients from
many different backgrounds, in
cluding sexual orientation."
Obedin-Maliver helped found
MERG in 2007 while completing
her medical degree at Stanford.
The group aims to improve LGBT
health using a threefold approach
of conducting research, influencing
health policy and advocating for
LGBT patients and providers. This
includes conducting research, influ
encing health policy and advocat
ing for LGBT patients and
providers.
"MERG initially came from
questions of how can we better
take care of ourselves and our
loved ones and [sic] our communi
ty," Obedin-Maliver said. The re
searchers soon discovered that
very little data had been published
on how LGBT-sensitive material
was being taught in medical
schools.
The survey that MERG con
ducted asked deans to grade their
school's performances on coverage
of LGBT-related healthcare issues.
Seventy percent of those who re
sponded reported a fair, poor or
very poor curriculum.
The study also identified 16 key
topics related to LGBT health, such
as transitioning and intimate part
ner violence. When the deans were
asked to assess the broadness of
their coverage of these topics, only
11 of the 132 schools claimed to
cover all 16 issues.
"LGBT health has expanded
way beyond sexually transmitted
disease and HIV," Obedin-Maliver
said. She cited many areas in which
LGBT individuals differ from their
peers, including substance use, body
image and medical care for LGBT
adolescents.

Gastroenterology and hepatol
ogy professor Gabriel Garcia, who
also serves as dean of admission at
the School of Medicine, cited sever
al reasons for the inadequate atten
tion given to this subgroup of pa
tients, including lack of material, ex
pertise and requirements related to
LGBT health concerns.
"The most likely reason is the
lack of educators who have specific
expertise in this area. It's easier to
find teachers in organic chemistry,"
he said.
Obedin-Maliver had another
reason why she believed these top
ics lacked coverage.
"Research and awareness isn't
there," she said. "We don't have
providers who can do research that
can really help us understand to
what extent the disparities are there
and how to address them."
Garcia says Stanford medical
students take a class during their
preclinical years that specifically
addresses many of the 16 key topics
identified by MERG.
What they miss is a required ro
tation through an LGBT-specific
provider or clinic, an experience
that Obedin-Maliver said she be
lieved is key to learning provider
sensitivity.
Steps are being taken to fill in
the gaps in education, both Garcia
and Obedin-Maliver said. Garcia is
a member of a task force within the
Association of American Medical
Colleges (AAMC), an organization
charged with making concrete rec
ommendations to improve educa
tion on LGBT healthcare. The
group hopes to provide new cur
riculum material and policy frame
work for institutions seeking
change.

Garcia says the increasing atten
tion on such LGBT-related issues,
such as gay marriage and Don't Ask
Don't Tell, will encourage advocacy
in the medical field.

"As we have this nationwide dis
cussion, we will also have a medical
school education discussion," Gar
cia added.

Obedin-Maliver said she hopes
the study will provide necessary
data to prompt change among insti
tutions in the United States. She
added that perhaps in the future,
educators may be held to national
standards of LGBT-related curricu
lum coverage.

find teachers in organic chemistry,"
he said.
Obedin-Maliver had another
reason why she believed these top
ics lacked coverage.
"Research and awareness isn't
there," she said. "We don't have
providers who can do research that
can really help us understand to
what extent the disparities are there
and how to address them."
Garcia says Stanford medical
students take a class during their
preclinical years that specifically
addresses many of the 16 key topics
identified by MERG.
What they miss is a required ro
tation through an LGBT-specific
provider or clinic, an experience
that Obedin-Maliver said she be
lieved is key to learning provider
sensitivity.
Steps are being taken to fill in
the gaps in education, both Garcia
and Obedin-Maliver said. Garcia is
a member of a task force within the
Association of American Medical
Colleges (AAMC), an organization
charged with making concrete rec
ommendations to improve educa
tion on LGBT healthcare. The
group hopes to provide new cur
riculum material and policy frame
work for institutions seeking
change.

Garcia says the increasing atten
tion on such LGBT-related issues,
such as gay marriage and Don't Ask
Don't Tell, will encourage advocacy
in the medical field.

"As we have this nationwide dis
cussion, we will also have a medical
school education discussion," Gar
cia added.

Obedin-Maliver said she hopes
the study will provide necessary
data to prompt change among insti
tutions in the United States. She
added that perhaps in the future,
educators may be held to national
standards of LGBT-related curricu
lum coverage.
