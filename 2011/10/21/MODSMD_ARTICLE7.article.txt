## Study says new doctors not taught LGBT issues 
### ROBIN CHIN 
American medical schools are
lacking LGBT-related health cur
riculum, according to a new study
published by the Stanford School of
Medicine, A survey of 132 schools
discovered that medical students
spend a median total of five hours
studying LGBT-related issues.
The study was published in early
September by members of the Les
bian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgen
der Medical Education Research
Group (LGBT MERG). Deans
from medical schools in the United
States and Canada were surveyed
on topics such as length of class
room time devoted to LGBT-relat
ed issues and adequacy of material.
Dr. Juno Obedin-Maliver, an
08-GYN resident at UCSF and
the primary author of the study,
said that most of the five hours
were taught during the preclinical
or classroom years. One-third of
the schools surveyed had zero ex
posure to LGBT issues in the clini
cal years.

"These issues are primarily
about patient-relation skills," Obe
din-Maliver said. "Taking care of
patients is not just about knowl
edge it's also about learning
how to interact with patients from
many different backgrounds, in
cluding sexual orientation."
Obedin-Maliver helped found
MERG in 2007 while completing
her medical degree at Stanford.
The group aims to improve LGBT
health using a threefold approach
of conducting research, influencing
health policy and advocating for
LGBT patients and providers. This
includes conducting research, influ
encing health policy and advocat
ing for LGBT patients and
providers.
"MERG initially came from
questions of how can we better
take care of ourselves and our
loved ones and [sic] our communi
ty," Obedin-Maliver said. The re
searchers soon discovered that
very little data had been published
