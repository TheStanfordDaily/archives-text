## Universities allowed to defund exclusive groups 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN 
Universities' retention of the
right to deny funding to groups that
discriminate based on religious
freedom, according to a federal ap
peals court ruling made in August,
will have a positive impact on Stan
ford, according to Reverend Scotty
McLennan, dean of religious life.

The case centered on whether
San Diego State was able to deny
funding for two religious groups on
campus that sought to bar non-reli
gious members from their ranks.
The federal appeals court up
held the university's decision,
agreeing that the practice of ban
ning membership based on race, re
ligion, sex or sexual orientation con
stituted an act of discrimination and
that San Diego State could deny

funding to such groups.
The case involved a Christian
fraternity and sorority that sought
to limit membership based on reli
gious beliefs. Lawyers defending
the two campus organizations
claimed that such religious groups
should be regarded as the same as
secular organizations that rally
around a common belief, such as a
pro-choice advocacy organization,
which would presumably not allow
members who held the opposite
opinion to join.
Stanford University has a similar
policy as San Diego State, refusing
to fund student groups that have
discriminatory admission policies.
"Stanford does not fund groups
that deny membership based on re
ligion, race or sexual orientation,
nor would the University in the fu
ture," said McLennan.

McLennan added that Stanford
has a very explicit "all-comers pol
icy." This policy stipulates un
equivocally that all student organ
izations must welcome and en
courage participation from every
one in the Stanford student com
munity.

"We think the opportunity to
participate in the planning and
leadership of activities is an impor
tant part of many students' Stan
ford education," McLennan said.
"We expect groups actively to
recruit and accept all students in
terested in a group's activities."
McLennan did acknowledge
that groups often require certain
skills or ability levels of their mem
bers. However, he said this does not
violate Stanford's policy.
"A cappella groups can audition
to ensure that students can sing,"
McLennan said. "But we do not
consider adherence to a stated be
lief, race or sexual orientation to be
an objective criterion."
"Adherence to the University's
Nondiscrimination Policy is an im
portant expectation for all groups
and is something that we strongly
support," McLennan said.
Mahta Baghoolizadeh 'l3, presi
dent of the Muslim Students
Awareness Network (MSAN),
echoed McLennan's opinion of the
importance of Stanford's open
community.
"Anyone who wants to be a di
rector or on the board can apply,"
said Baghoolizadeh, referring to
the MSAN board of directors.
"The year before I came we ac
tually had a non-Muslim on the
board because they [sic] were real
ly interested in the Muslim world."
Baghoolizadeh explained that
the Islamic Society of Stanford
University, which maintains the
more religious aspects of Muslim
campus life, also adheres to the
non-discrimination policy and re
ceives funding from the University.
While an unofficial University
group is unable to schedule use of
facilities on campus or communi
cate through official University

channels, it can still participate ac
tively in Stanford life, according to
McLennan.
"[These groups] could still ad
vertise on bulletin boards open to
the general public," McLennan
said, "ft could utilize our free
speech area on campus, White
Plaza and hold gatherings outside
in areas that didn't impinge on
other activities ... it could fund
raise for itself from non-Stanford
sources."
"In all those senses, it could
maintain a presence at Stanford
without official University affilia
tion," McLennan added.
This policy is not unique to Stan
ford. After Hastings School of Law
decided in 2010 to withhold funding
from the Christian Legal Society,
one of the actions that brought
about the ruling of the court of ap
peals this summer, the organization
still maintained a strong presence
on campus.
"The CLS continued to host a
variety of activities along the lines
described above and even doubled
the number of students attending
its meetings after losing its official
university recognition," McLennan
said.
