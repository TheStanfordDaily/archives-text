## EDITORIAL Overseeing the Overseas Seminars 
### 
After a two-year hiatus, the
Stanford Bing Overseas
Studies Program (BOSP)
will resume Stanford Overseas Sem
inars, beginning this coming sum
mer. The two-week seminars, which
take place either at the very begin
ning or end of the summer, offer
their participants a chance to travel
the world as part of academically ori
ented, faculty-led trips. And while
students are truly privileged to have
this opportunity, we hope the loca
tions chosen will exemplify the Uni
versity's passion for diversity by of
fering students a wide array of desti
nations varied in geographic loca
tion and socioeconomic condition.

The quarter-length study abroad
programs are a much more promi
nent aspect of Stanford life, and the
University has successfully
arranged many such programs in
the past, in some cases even planting
its own campuses in foreign cities.
Under the auspices of BOSP, stu
dents may spend a quarter, or even
longer, in such locations as Santiago,
Chile; Beijing, China; Cape Town,
South Africa; as well as the usual
European suspects Paris, Flo
rence, Berlin and Oxford.

Overseas Seminar. The ideal selec
tion of Overseas Seminar destina
tions should be characterized above
all by heterogeneity, a mix of di
verse possibilities, and most ideally
not overlap significantly with the
quarter-length abroad options.
An examination of past destina
tions reveals a dazzling array of
cities, in six of seven continents (un
fortunately, no faculty member has
yet donned the mantle of leading
the first Antarctica seminar). There
are certainly areas of the world
more underrepresented than oth
ers: China has been a reliable desti
nation each and every year, while
sub-Saharan Africa, with the excep
tion of Cape Town, has only twice
been a destination. Aside from one
trip to Brazil in 2005-06, South
America is noticeably absent. The
countries of Central and Eastern
Europe also do not feature in the
lists of destinations, although four
trips have visited Russia. Given that
Stanford already hosts quarter
length study abroad programs in
Moscow, Beijing and Cape Town, it
is certainly unsurprising and mildly
disappointing to see that these loca
tions continually attracted Over
seas Seminars for eight years.
ft is clearly true that destinations
can be selected for a number of
strategic reasons, the most obvious
being the relative safety and political
stability of the country in question.
At the same time, faculty will likely
select cities whose opportunities co
incide with his or her field of study as
well as locations whose institutions
can prove hospitable to a traveling
group of American college students.
While it is impossible to gauge pop
ular student opinion on possible des
tinations, a diverse swathe of desti
nations will prove all the more en
riching to those students interested
in an Overseas Seminar. The selec
tion for the summer of 2012 will
hopefully expand upon the diverse
destinations of the past.

The Overseas Seminars debuted
in 2002 and lasted eight years until
their recent suspension, offering a
total of 65 trips in that time. Of
course, the principal advantage of
an Overseas Seminar is that it does
not consume a full quarter of stu
dents' academic schedules. Athletes,
for example, who are kept occupied
with practice during the academic
year, will more likely be available
during the summer to participate in
an Overseas Seminar. Or engineers,
who would find it difficult to accom
modate the course options available
in Florence, Italy, for example,
would find Overseas Seminars
ideal. Similarly, students who
choose to be on staff in a dormitory
a full year commitment
would likely be drawn to Overseas
Seminars as well.

One might think that there need
not be any specific guideline for the
locations of these Overseas Semi
nars. Those students who cannot
spend a quarter in Oxford during
the year might benefit enormously
from an Overseas Seminar to Ox
ford, and so on for the long list of
other Stanford study abroad loca
tions.

But the fact remains that there
are innumerable destinations over
seas to which one might voyage, and
no clear way to rank them. It is also
quite likely that students with the
opportunity to study abroad for a
quarter will also be interested in an
