# Art as an American wonder
## PROFILE: CLAIRE PERRY 
### AMRTIARAO 
It's easy to dismiss museum exhibits as
dry, academic montages to traverse on
a rainy day, or during a class field trip.
But in reality, countless hours are de
voted to selecting exactly which arti
facts come together to display the exhibi
tion's cohesive narrative.

At Stanford, the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts owes the selection and
organization of its artwork to the knowl
edgeable and diligent group of professionals
who plan these exhibits the curators.
Claire Perry M.A. 'BB Ph.D. '93, the for
mer coordinator of American art at Cantor
for nearly a decade, is one such individual.
This past year, Perry had the opportunity
to organize an exhibit at the Smithsonian
American Art Museum and is now co-teach
ing an undergraduate class with art history
professor Bryan Wolf that provides students
with an in-depth analysis of her exhibition.
The exhibit, titled "The Great American Hall
of Wonders," debuted this past summer and
examines 19th-century America through the
lens of technological innovations that took
place during that time of rapid change.
Perry never expected to become a curator
when she dropped out of college to travel
around Europe during her early twenties, but
perhaps this career move was not so surpris
ing when one considers the artistic master
pieces that span the continent. After her ex
tensive traveling, she returned to school and
earned her bachelor's degree in internation
al economics at Georgetown University's
School of Foreign Service and later attended
Stanford where she received her doctorate in
art history.
Perry considers curating to be her true
calling, a career that is much more than sim
ply throwing an amalgam of art together in a
room.

"It's a really thoughtful process about
considering what audiences might want to
look at, what might inspire but also challenge
them," Perry said.
Her inspiration for the "Wonders" exhib
it rose out of the Stanford Arts Initiative, a
program started in 2006 to increase the pres
ence of the arts on a campus that is now also
well known for its programs in science and
technology. Perry appealed to Cantor to plan
a show that intertwined the two fields but did
not receive a slot on the exhibition schedule.
Instead, Perry's proposal was accepted at the
Smithsonian, where she became a guest cura
tor at the American Art Museum.

"Props to her," said Greg Gorraiz 'l2, a

student in her "American Wonders" class.
"She met the institutional roadblocks [at
Stanford], took it across the country and
probably reached a wider audience."
Relocating to Washington, D.C., she took
the concept for her exhibit and the means
with which to fund it to a whole new level.
With the powerful Smithsonian name behind
her, Perry was able to procure objects she
had only dreamed of using works by
Audubon, Thomas Moran, Winslow Homer
and other eminent artists.To complement the
exhibit, she compiled a companion book in
the form of a series of essays linking techno
logical advances of the time to themes visited
in contemporary artistic renderings.

The book is also the cornerstone of Wolf
and Perry's "American Wonders" class, cross
listed in the American Studies and Art Histo
ry Departments.
"The exhibition is a unifying force be
tween all the things we read," said Sophi
Newman 'l3, a class member and American
studies major with a focus on American art.
But the class itself is interdisciplinary, fo
cused on the art of presentation viewed
through different approaches in art and his
tory. By co-teaching the small, seminar-style
class, Perry receives immediate feedback
from her students about the exhibit rather
than waiting for newspaper reviews or visitor
comments. The intimate size of the class also
allows Perry's students to more closely inter
pret these works of art for themselves.
Gorraiz, for instance, already feels its in
fluence after a few weeks.

"[The class] gives me an appreciation of
another world, one where people spend so
much time and energy trying to portray so
many complexities as a singular thing," he
said.

Both Gorraiz and Newman stressed the
importance of not taking a painting, or an ex
hibit for that matter, merely at surface value.
And this December, when the class travels to
D.C. to visit "The Great American Hall of
Wonders," they can view it from an informed
perspective after having learned all about the
subtleties of the objects in class.
Perry hopes for the opportunity to work
with the Smithsonian again in the future, per
haps after her next burst of inspiration
strikes. In the meantime, she's excited to
show the fruits of her labor to her class this
winter, at which point they can further ex
plore the exhibit's cohesive American narra
tive firsthand as curators of especially in
formed opinions.

Perry never expected to become a curator
when she dropped out of college to travel
around Europe during her early twenties, but
perhaps this career move was not so surpris
ing when one considers the artistic master
pieces that span the continent. After her ex
tensive traveling, she returned to school and
earned her bachelor's degree in internation
al economics at Georgetown University's
School of Foreign Service and later attended
Stanford where she received her doctorate in
art history.
Perry considers curating to be her true
calling, a career that is much more than sim
ply throwing an amalgam of art together in a
room.

"It's a really thoughtful process about
considering what audiences might want to
look at, what might inspire but also challenge
them," Perry said.
Her inspiration for the "Wonders" exhib
it rose out of the Stanford Arts Initiative, a
program started in 2006 to increase the pres
ence of the arts on a campus that is now also
well known for its programs in science and
technology. Perry appealed to Cantor to plan
a show that intertwined the two fields but did
not receive a slot on the exhibition schedule.
Instead, Perry's proposal was accepted at the
Smithsonian, where she became a guest cura
tor at the American Art Museum.

"Props to her," said Greg Gorraiz 'l2, a

student in her "American Wonders" class.
"She met the institutional roadblocks [at
Stanford], took it across the country and
probably reached a wider audience."
Relocating to Washington, D.C., she took
the concept for her exhibit and the means
with which to fund it to a whole new level.
With the powerful Smithsonian name behind
her, Perry was able to procure objects she
had only dreamed of using works by
Audubon, Thomas Moran, Winslow Homer
and other eminent artists.To complement the
exhibit, she compiled a companion book in
the form of a series of essays linking techno
logical advances of the time to themes visited
in contemporary artistic renderings.

The book is also the cornerstone of Wolf
and Perry's "American Wonders" class, cross
listed in the American Studies and Art Histo
ry Departments.
"The exhibition is a unifying force be
tween all the things we read," said Sophi
Newman 'l3, a class member and American
studies major with a focus on American art.
But the class itself is interdisciplinary, fo
cused on the art of presentation viewed
through different approaches in art and his
tory. By co-teaching the small, seminar-style
class, Perry receives immediate feedback
from her students about the exhibit rather
than waiting for newspaper reviews or visitor
comments. The intimate size of the class also
allows Perry's students to more closely inter
pret these works of art for themselves.
Gorraiz, for instance, already feels its in
fluence after a few weeks.

"[The class] gives me an appreciation of
another world, one where people spend so
much time and energy trying to portray so
many complexities as a singular thing," he
said.

Both Gorraiz and Newman stressed the
importance of not taking a painting, or an ex
hibit for that matter, merely at surface value.
And this December, when the class travels to
D.C. to visit "The Great American Hall of
Wonders," they can view it from an informed
perspective after having learned all about the
subtleties of the objects in class.
Perry hopes for the opportunity to work
with the Smithsonian again in the future, per
haps after her next burst of inspiration
strikes. In the meantime, she's excited to
show the fruits of her labor to her class this
winter, at which point they can further ex
plore the exhibit's cohesive American narra
tive firsthand as curators of especially in
formed opinions.
