## EDITORIAL A 						free solution to Stanford's waste problem 
### 
Although relatively few stu
dents have ventured into
the basement of Old
Union, those that do encounter an
innovative example of social entre
preneurship applied to our very
own Stanford campus. Union Un
derground, a free store and student
art gallery, offers a creative stab at
a partial solution to the problem of
waste at Stanford.

The free store is also a great ex
ample of making change happen.
The founders had an idea for a stu
dent thrift store and in consultation
with other interested students, the
administration and similar initia
tives elsewhere, they worked to
quickly make their vision a reality,
including the choice to switch to a
free store model due to zoning re
strictions. Furthermore, the store's
founding as a collaborative effort
between the Green Living Council
and Students for a Sustainable
Stanford, along with recent part
nership with the ASSU, is encour
aging. Although partnership is not
easy, there are real benefits to
working together to tackle what
are ultimately common problems
including greater visibility and po
tentially higher effectiveness.
Union Underground cannot by
itself solve the problem of waste at
Stanford. The store has its own set
of concerns to deal with, some of
which are self-reinforcing.The lack
of space for larger donations
means that the store cannot offer
some items that Stanford students
would avail of and would like to
donate, such as couches, and there
is a certain stigma against used
items. This, and the store's location
and newness, feed into the lack of
awareness and publicity of the
store among the student body. The
store must avoid becoming a
"dumping ground" for anything
and everything students should
maybe otherwise (legitimately)
throw away. Lastly, although the
Spring Quarter trial was a success,
it remains to be seen whether Stan
ford students can indeed be trusted
to maintain the balance of giving
and taking that is necessary to
make a free store work.

The store is open Friday
through Sunday from 12 p.m. to 2
p.m. and is staffed by volunteers.
The store operates on a donations
model whereby students and
groups donate used clothing or
other items, and visitors to the store
can take up to three items per day.
Thus far, because of space con
straints, the store is unable to ac
cept larger donations like couches
or TVs, but it hopes to be able to ex
pand.

Union Underground is impres
sive for a number of reasons. First
ly, the free store is an excellent ex
ample of innovation applied to our
very own campus. Numerous stu
dents, groups and classes at Stan
ford are involved in addressing
some of the biggest challenges fac
ing society today in new ways. Ef
forts like Union Underground re
mind us that these projects can

and should start "closer to
home," addressing real issues on
Stanford's campus.
For that reason, another major
reason to applaud Union Under
ground is for taking a small step
against the very real problem of
waste.The transient nature of life at
Stanford means students regularly
dispose of items like clothing or
room furnishings, many of which
are perfectly serviceable. For some
things, resale is an option, and stu
dents can always take items for do
nation to centers that are a little
farther away. Many items, however,
are simply just thrown away. Union
Underground offers a convenient
alternative to contributing to land
fills and one that more directly en
gages the Stanford community.

On the whole, however, the
store and the idea behind it are
promising. The collaborative effort
to provide a useful service to stu
dents and, at the same time, engage
them with the issue of sustainabili
ty is laudable and sets a great
example for others on this campus.
