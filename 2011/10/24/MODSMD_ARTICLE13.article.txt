# FRESHMAN '15
## The
						Amazing Race: Twain Edition 
### Bianca Chavez 
I've been a Stanford student for
well over a month now. And yet, I
still wake up every morning not
quite believing that I actually go to
school here. It feels like the token
"happy" scene in every teen movie
the one where the sun is shining
and the breeze is blowing while the
upbeat pop song plays in the back
ground. It's during these happy mo
ments when I remember how lucky
we all are to be attending college, let
alone one of the top universities in
the world. I know that's easy to forget
when you have midterms, five differ
ent club meetings to attend and like,
three essays due on Tuesday, but it's
so true. I mean, did you see all the old

folks that came to Homecoming?
They're from the class of '6l, and
they still love this place enough to
come back. That's how awesome
Stanford is; people keep returning
five decades after they graduate.
Actually, last weekend was a per
fect example of Stanford's awesome
ness. All of Twain took a free!

trip to San Francisco for our frosh
scavenger hunt.
Naturally, my team was the best.
But I'll admit that I wasn't super ex
cited when I first heard who my
group mates were. Our RAs had
used a "random algorithm" to form
our groups (read: purposely put to
gether teams that they thought

would be the most awkward and
thus, the most hilarious) so that we
would be forced to "branch out."
May I just take a moment to say that
I absolutely hate being the first to
branch out? I know it builds charac
ter and all, but it's just plain uncom
fortable sometimes. And the begin
ning of our scavenger hunt certainly
was. None of us really knew what to
say to each other, and it really didn't
help that the tasks on the scavenger
hunt list required us to be very phys
ically close. (Task #7: form a human
pyramid on a street corner.)
But as the day continued and
the tasks on the list got progressively
more ridiculous I began to discov
er that I had more in common with
my teammates than I had anticipat
ed. One girl who I had initially
pegged as quiet and shy turned out to
share my same obsession with wed
dings! We had a great time trying to
accomplish #24 on our list: try on a
bridal gown at Neiman Marcus. (In
case, you were wondering, we totally
failed this mission. Apparently you
need to make an appointment about
six weeks in advance to try on gowns
at a luxury bridal salon. Who knew?)
Even though our attempt to play
"Say Yes to the Dress" was loads of
fun, it was not one of the trip's high
lights. The craziest moment was when
my next-door neighbor, Garseng, de
cided to accomplish #8 on the list: get
a tattoo. He gave it absolutely no
thought either, just waltzed into a tat
too parlor in Haight-Ashbury,
plopped down in a chair and decided
what to get in a period of about three
minutes. (He settled on getting Lady
Gaga's phrase "Born This Way"
scrawled on his foot. It only came out
slightly crooked.)
And the trip's best moment?
When four of my dormmates jumped
off a pier into San Francisco Bay.
Sure, it was illegal and moderately
terrifying to watch. But as I watched
them frolic in the visibly dirty water,
I could not help but think, this is what
college is supposed to be about: tak
ing leaps of faith.

Why not take a leap of faith and email
