# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## What's in a name? Not much. 
### Miles Unterreiner 
Names, like the people who
give them, can be terrific
liars.

Take, for example, the Democrat
ic People's Republic of North Korea,
which is not remotely democratic,
run by the people or anything like a
republic. (One almost longs for the
days of the Austro-Hungarians and
the Ottomans, when big, mean em
pires, while admittedly big and mean,
were at least honest about being em
pires). Or consider the PATRIOT
Act, whose provisions for spying on
American citizens and trampling all
over our basic civil liberties were
anything but patriotic.

Ditto for Alabama's recent "Tax
payer and Citizen Protection Act," a
far-reaching bill recently passed by
the state legislature and intended to
clamp down on illegal immigration.
A more appropriate title, it seems,
might be, "An Act to Raise Prices on
Consumer Goods by Increasing the
Cost of Labor," or perhaps, "A Bill
to Terrorize Anyone Who Looks
Hispanic, Especially Kids" or even
"The Alabama Racial Profiling and
Mass Exclusion Act."

In the time since the act's pas
sage, thousands of undocumented
children have ceased showing up for
school, workers have fled menial
jobs in droves and valuable infra
structure construction has slowed
for lack of willing labor. The ACLU
and the Department of Justice have
both filed suit against a law with per

nicious effects that, according to the
Southern Poverty Law Center,
amount to a "humanitarian crisis."

Perhaps we shouldn't be too sur
prised, given the current tenor of the
national debate on immigration. Al
abama's bill looks positively friend
ly, for example, when compared with
the rhetoric of Republican presi
dential candidate Herman Cain,
who suggested at a campaign stop in
Tennessee on Oct. 15 that he
planned on building a 20-foot-high
electrified fence along the Mexico
border designed to kill would-be il
legal immigrants.
"It's going to be 20 feet high. It's
going to have barbed wire on the
top. It's going to be electrified. And
there's going to be a sign on the
other side saying, 'lt will kill you

Warning,"' explained Mr. Cain, ap
parently still upset about the failure
of his previous attempts to kill peo
ple by serving them millions of terri
ble pizzas. (It's not as bad as it
sounds, insisted the former Godfa
ther's CEO; the welcoming ail-
American sign advertising your im
pending death by electric shock will
be helpfully translated into Span
ish.)

But it gets better. Cain joked that
his wall would feature a medieval
style moat complete with hungry al
ligators, though it's not clear where
precisely they would come from. (I'd
start by looking in the same circus
they must have found the Republi

can elephant this year, and then
checking to see if they can be im
ported from Uz-beki-beki-beki
beki-stan-stan). Taking a cue from
Antoine Dodson, Cain has pro
claimed that just in case those darn
illegals got past the moat, the alliga
tors and the 20-foot-high electrocu
tion zone, he would secure the bor
der "for real" by sending in brigades
of soldiers "with real guns and real
bullets."

According to the New York
Times, Cain's remarks were deliv
ered at a pair of campaign rallies in
Tennessee and drew thunderous ap
plause from crowds of several hun
dred. This is not at all surprising,
given the fact that attendees at pre
vious Republican events have
booed a gay soldier serving in Iraq
and cheered enthusiastically at the
thought of an uninsured man dying
without medical care.
Cain's words are also near-stan
dard fare for a Republican field
whose crazed enthusiasm for com
petition apparently extends to the
tightly fought contest for Most Big
oted Candidate. Currently in the
lead, though not by much, is former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt
Romney, whose rousing anti-immi
grant campaign ad recently vaulted
him into first place over former yel
low-jersey-holder Rick Santorum.
The ad opens with a clip of an
unusually empathetic Governor
Rick Perry defending his decision

to provide in-state tuition to the
children of illegal immigrants. "If
you say that we should not educate
children who come into our state ..

. by no fault of their own, I don't
think you have a heart," said Perry,
which momentarily raised the like
lihood of me voting for him from
zero to one in a million.
"MITT ROMNEY HAS A DIF
FERENT VIEW," blares the ad in
all caps, just in case we were wonder
ing, before closing with a slide ex
horting us to "BELIEVE IN
AMERICA" by voting for Mitt this
November.

Well, I believe in America, Mr.
Romney. But it's not an America
that prides itself on the body count it
can rack up by electrocuting its
neighbors. My America is better
than that.

It is possible, of course, that in the
words of people like Mr. Cain and
Mr. Romney we are seeing little
more than overblown primary-sea
son rhetoric, calculated to appeal to
party extremes and soon to disap
pear under the glare of the national
spotlight. We can only hope.

Miles knows we need comprehensive
immigration reform; he just thinks an
electric fence isn't the way to do it.
