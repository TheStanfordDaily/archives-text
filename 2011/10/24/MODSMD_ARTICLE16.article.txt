## RUNNING RAMPANT Card sets school rushing record in rout of Huskies 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In a game featuring two of the
nation's top passers, the anticipat
ed air war instead turned into the
Stanford Cardinal doing its best
Forrest Gump impersonation.
After passing for 702 yards in its
last two games, the Stanford foot
ball team ran, ran and ran some
more in Saturday's 65-21 blowout
of the Washington Huskies.

The No. 6 Cardinal rushed for a
school-record 446 yards on 44 car
ries, riding a strong offensive line
to shred the then-No. 25 Huskies'
run defense, which had only al
lowed an average of 97 yards per
game rushing coming into Satur
day's contest, a fact that made the
Cardinal players beam at their
own efforts.
"We were very aware of it when
we broke [the school rushing
record]. What a testament to the
O-line, to the coach, the tight ends,
to the fullbacks and wide re
ceivers," said redshirt junior quar
terback Andrew Luck. "It was a
total team effort on the ground
today, but first of all, to the backs
making it happen with unbeliev
able plays. They're special athletes,
and it's fun to have four of them,
four really good ones."
The running back foursome of
juniors Stepfan Taylor and Tyler
Gaffney, redshirt senior Jeremy
Stewart and sophomore Anthony
Wilkerson contributed 368 yards
and five touchdowns to the Cardi

nal attack, with Taylor tallying 138
yards and Gaffney running for 117
of his own.

Altogether, it was an effort that
was good enough to continue two
impressive streaks for Stanford
the Cardinal has now won 15
straight games and has defeated its
last 10 opponents by more than 25
points. Both stats were in doubt
early on, though, as the Huskies
were the ones showing off their
speed on the ground.

After Stanford took its first two
drives in for a touchdown and a
field goal to jump out to a 10-0
lead, Washington responded to
early defensive pressure from
Stanford by feeding running back
Chris Polk, who dashed 46 yards
for a touchdown to make the score
10-7 with 3:46 left in the first quar
ter.

After Luck led the offense to
another score with a one-yard
touchdown toss to redshirt senior
tight end Coby Fleener, Polk again
ripped off another touchdown run,
shucking missed tackles en route
to a 61-yard score that made it 17-
14 early in the second quarter.
Stanford's run game responded
right away, though, as Taylor went
untouched on a 70-yard touch
down run on the first play of the
next drive to make it 24-14.
After the Huskies missed a
field goal, Luck tossed another
touchdown pass, this time to junior
wide receiver Drew Terrell. The
first touchdown catch of Terrell's
career extended the Cardinal lead
to 31-14.
Stanford then struck its knock
out blow moments later when sen

Junior running back Tyler Gaffney ran for a career-high 117 yards in No. 6 Stanford's 65-21 thrashing of Washington.
Gaffney did not even lead the team in rushing, though, as fellow junior running back Stepfan Taylor racked up 138 yards
on the ground. Sophomore running back Anthony Wilkerson added 93 to fuel the 446-yard Cardinal rushing attack.
