## RUNNING RAMPANT Card sets school rushing record in rout of Huskies 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
In a game featuring two of the
nation's top passers, the anticipat
ed air war instead turned into the
Stanford Cardinal doing its best
Forrest Gump impersonation.
After passing for 702 yards in its
last two games, the Stanford foot
ball team ran, ran and ran some
more in Saturday's 65-21 blowout
of the Washington Huskies.

The No. 6 Cardinal rushed for a
school-record 446 yards on 44 car
ries, riding a strong offensive line
to shred the then-No. 25 Huskies'
run defense, which had only al
lowed an average of 97 yards per
game rushing coming into Satur
day's contest, a fact that made the
Cardinal players beam at their
own efforts.
"We were very aware of it when
we broke [the school rushing
record]. What a testament to the
O-line, to the coach, the tight ends,
to the fullbacks and wide re
ceivers," said redshirt junior quar
terback Andrew Luck. "It was a
total team effort on the ground
today, but first of all, to the backs
making it happen with unbeliev
able plays. They're special athletes,
and it's fun to have four of them,
four really good ones."
The running back foursome of
juniors Stepfan Taylor and Tyler
Gaffney, redshirt senior Jeremy
Stewart and sophomore Anthony
Wilkerson contributed 368 yards
and five touchdowns to the Cardi

nal attack, with Taylor tallying 138
yards and Gaffney running for 117
of his own.

Altogether, it was an effort that
was good enough to continue two
impressive streaks for Stanford
the Cardinal has now won 15
straight games and has defeated its
last 10 opponents by more than 25
points. Both stats were in doubt
early on, though, as the Huskies
were the ones showing off their
speed on the ground.

After Stanford took its first two
drives in for a touchdown and a
field goal to jump out to a 10-0
lead, Washington responded to
early defensive pressure from
Stanford by feeding running back
Chris Polk, who dashed 46 yards
for a touchdown to make the score
10-7 with 3:46 left in the first quar
ter.

After Luck led the offense to
another score with a one-yard
touchdown toss to redshirt senior
tight end Coby Fleener, Polk again
ripped off another touchdown run,
shucking missed tackles en route
to a 61-yard score that made it 17-
14 early in the second quarter.
Stanford's run game responded
right away, though, as Taylor went
untouched on a 70-yard touch
down run on the first play of the
next drive to make it 24-14.
After the Huskies missed a
field goal, Luck tossed another
touchdown pass, this time to junior
wide receiver Drew Terrell. The
first touchdown catch of Terrell's
career extended the Cardinal lead
to 31-14.

Junior running back Tyler Gaffney ran for a career-high 117 yards in No. 6 Stanford's 65-21 thrashing of Washington.
Gaffney did not even lead the team in rushing, though, as fellow junior running back Stepfan Taylor racked up 138 yards
on the ground. Sophomore running back Anthony Wilkerson added 93 to fuel the 446-yard Cardinal rushing attack.
cepted a Keith Price pass and re
turned it 61 yards for a touchdown
ahead of a trailing Price to make the
score 38-14 and put the Huskies a lit
tle too far behind.
"That was a play we'd been work
ing on for about three weeks, so I
knew it was coming, and the quarter
back finally threw it," Thomas said.
"When I caught it, that was the first
thing going through my mind, you
know, I see the angle, and if this guy
catches me, everybody in my locker
room is going to mess with me and all
my boys from back home are going
to mess with me. So I had to kick it
into second gear."
The Cardinal took the 38-14 mar
gin into the half and dedicated the
second half to grinding the clock
with the run game along with
extra effort to stop Polk from ripping
off any more long runs of his own.
"Basically, we got a second half
'not-pep talk' from [defensive coor
dinator Derek] Mason, he let us
know real quick that we can't play
like that," Thomas said. "And every
body just did their job, we didn't real
ly make adjustments, he just told us
that if we continue to play like this,
the offense is going to have to win
this game for us."
The "not-pep talk" led the de
fense to a dominant second half
After Polk tallied 143 yards rushing
in the first half, the Cardinal defense
clamped down and held the junior
runner to one yard in the second half.
Polk's poor second half came in es
pecially stark contrast to the Stan
ford offense, which added 199 yards
rushing after eating up 247 yards on
the ground in the first half.
As the clock wound closer to the
end of the game, the Cardinal run
ners could feel the pressure to break
another school record.
"It was exciting to see everybody
go out there and have fun," Taylor
said. "When we came back in at half
time, I told Gaffney, 'Let's try to get
500 (yards) out here.'"
While Stanford didn't quite
eclipse that high mark, the record fi
nally fell with 1:25 left in the game, as
Wilkerson took a draw play up the
left side and broke free for a 38-yard
touchdown, his second of the day.
While the new record left head

coach David Shaw all smiles, he in
sisted that he wasn't trying to pile on
the points in order to rewrite history
or impress BCS voters.
"I had no idea [about the record]
until right at the end, and to be per
fectly honest, I was not trying to get
it," Shaw said. "That last run for a
touchdown by Wilkerson, I was hop
ing he'd get the first down and then
we'd kill the clock. We were not try
ing to set records; we were not trying
to score more points. I wanted to end
the game.
"The biggest pitfall in this profes
sion and I've lived in this profes
sion my entire life the biggest pit
fall in this profession is to a) worry
about things that you shouldn't
worry about or b) worry about things
you can't control anyway," Shaw
continued when pressed about wow
ing BCS voters. "The only thing we
control is how we work during the
week and how we play on Satur
days."
Shaw of course credited the of
fensive line and running backs for
the dominant ground performance,
but he also made sure to give his
quarterback a little recognition after
an efficient but not eye-popping
passing performance, completing 16
of 21 passes for 169 yards and two
touchdowns.
"I give Andrew and [offensive
line coach Mike] Bloomgren a lot of
credit as far as making sure we got to
the right play every single time,"
Shaw said. "On every single play,
[Luck] can audible to a fourth or fifth
play, he has it all at his fingertips, and
every single play tonight he got us to
the right play."
And even though his star quarter
back didn't amass gaudy stats, Shaw
said that those tuning into the prime
time game most likely learned a little
something about a team that's more
than just one Heisman-caliber play
er.
"We're more than just Andrew
Luck," Shaw said. "We've got a good
team. We've got a physical team...
We can play both styles of football.
Andrew's thrown for over 300
[yards] a couple times this year, now
we rushed for a bunch tonight. The
fact that we can be a complete of
fense is what we strive for."

In a game featuring two of the
nation's top passers, the anticipat
ed air war instead turned into the
Stanford Cardinal doing its best
Forrest Gump impersonation.
After passing for 702 yards in its
last two games, the Stanford foot
ball team ran, ran and ran some
more in Saturday's 65-21 blowout
of the Washington Huskies.

The No. 6 Cardinal rushed for a
school-record 446 yards on 44 car
ries, riding a strong offensive line
to shred the then-No. 25 Huskies'
run defense, which had only al
lowed an average of 97 yards per
game rushing coming into Satur
day's contest, a fact that made the
Cardinal players beam at their
own efforts.
"We were very aware of it when
we broke [the school rushing
record]. What a testament to the
O-line, to the coach, the tight ends,
to the fullbacks and wide re
ceivers," said redshirt junior quar
terback Andrew Luck. "It was a
total team effort on the ground
today, but first of all, to the backs
making it happen with unbeliev
able plays. They're special athletes,
and it's fun to have four of them,
four really good ones."
The running back foursome of
juniors Stepfan Taylor and Tyler
Gaffney, redshirt senior Jeremy
Stewart and sophomore Anthony
Wilkerson contributed 368 yards
and five touchdowns to the Cardi

nal attack, with Taylor tallying 138
yards and Gaffney running for 117
of his own.

Altogether, it was an effort that
was good enough to continue two
impressive streaks for Stanford
the Cardinal has now won 15
straight games and has defeated its
last 10 opponents by more than 25
points. Both stats were in doubt
early on, though, as the Huskies
were the ones showing off their
speed on the ground.

After Stanford took its first two
drives in for a touchdown and a
field goal to jump out to a 10-0
lead, Washington responded to
early defensive pressure from
Stanford by feeding running back
Chris Polk, who dashed 46 yards
for a touchdown to make the score
10-7 with 3:46 left in the first quar
ter.

After Luck led the offense to
another score with a one-yard
touchdown toss to redshirt senior
tight end Coby Fleener, Polk again
ripped off another touchdown run,
shucking missed tackles en route
to a 61-yard score that made it 17-
14 early in the second quarter.
Stanford's run game responded
right away, though, as Taylor went
untouched on a 70-yard touch
down run on the first play of the
next drive to make it 24-14.
After the Huskies missed a
field goal, Luck tossed another
touchdown pass, this time to junior
wide receiver Drew Terrell. The
first touchdown catch of Terrell's
career extended the Cardinal lead
to 31-14.

Junior running back Tyler Gaffney ran for a career-high 117 yards in No. 6 Stanford's 65-21 thrashing of Washington.

cepted a Keith Price pass and re
turned it 61 yards for a touchdown
ahead of a trailing Price to make the
score 38-14 and put the Huskies a lit
tle too far behind.
"That was a play we'd been work
ing on for about three weeks, so I
knew it was coming, and the quarter
back finally threw it," Thomas said.
"When I caught it, that was the first
thing going through my mind, you
know, I see the angle, and if this guy
catches me, everybody in my locker
room is going to mess with me and all
my boys from back home are going
to mess with me. So I had to kick it
into second gear."
The Cardinal took the 38-14 mar
gin into the half and dedicated the
second half to grinding the clock
with the run game along with
extra effort to stop Polk from ripping
off any more long runs of his own.
"Basically, we got a second half
'not-pep talk' from [defensive coor
dinator Derek] Mason, he let us
know real quick that we can't play
like that," Thomas said. "And every
body just did their job, we didn't real
ly make adjustments, he just told us
that if we continue to play like this,
the offense is going to have to win
this game for us."
The "not-pep talk" led the de
fense to a dominant second half
After Polk tallied 143 yards rushing
in the first half, the Cardinal defense
clamped down and held the junior
runner to one yard in the second half.
Polk's poor second half came in es
pecially stark contrast to the Stan
ford offense, which added 199 yards
rushing after eating up 247 yards on
the ground in the first half.
As the clock wound closer to the
end of the game, the Cardinal run
ners could feel the pressure to break
another school record.
"It was exciting to see everybody
go out there and have fun," Taylor
said. "When we came back in at half
time, I told Gaffney, 'Let's try to get
500 (yards) out here.'"
While Stanford didn't quite
eclipse that high mark, the record fi
nally fell with 1:25 left in the game, as
Wilkerson took a draw play up the
left side and broke free for a 38-yard
touchdown, his second of the day.
While the new record left head
