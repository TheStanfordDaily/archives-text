## Stanford wins ugly in Arizona 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ 
Of the many adjectives that can be used to de
scribe the Stanford women's volleyball team's
play this weekend, pretty is not one of them.
However, sometimes it is just about getting the
victories, and that is exactly what the No. 5 Cardi
nal did.

Stanford (16-3, 9-3 Pac-12) went into its
matches against Arizona (13-7,5-6) and Arizona
State (5-16,1-11) as hot as any team in the Pac-12
and maybe even the country. The Card was look
ing to build on its six-game winning streak and
continue climbing up the conference standings.

ARIZONA STATE 1
10/22, Tempe, Ariz.

Starting the weekend off in Arizona on Friday
night, it looked as if the team's momentum from
the previous weekend was carrying over, and
Stanford jumped out to a quick 5-0 lead. But
things got ugly fast for the Cardinal, as the Wild
cats came back to take a 23-19 lead. On the verge
of dropping the first set, Stanford turned it
around quickly, closing out the game with six
straight points to take the set, 25-23.
The Cardinal kept Arizona on its heels, taking
the second set as well, 25-22. However, Stanford
would be denied another sweep, as Arizona came
roaring back to win the third set, 25-22. The Card
began to show flashes of its former self in game
four, burying the Wildcats offensively Stan
ford closed out the match in style, taking the
fourth set, 25-17.
Leading the way for the Cardinal was sopho
more outside hitter Rachel Williams, who led all
players with 18 kills. Junior setter Karissa Cook
showed everyone why she had just been named
Pac-12 and National Player of the Week, posting
yet another double-double with 39 assists and 17
digs.The dynamic duo has been a major factor for
Stanford this year.
Saturday's game against the second-to-last
place Sun Devils could not have started off any
worse. Stanford dropped the first set in miserable
fashion, losing 25-22. But the Card charged back
in the second set, stifling the Arizona State attack
to even the match at one set apiece.
That was when Stanford got its groove back.
Despite a subpar effort against Arizona and an
early slip-up against Arizona State, the momen
tum shifted back to the Cardinal. Stanford pro
ceeded to bury the Sun Devils, taking game three
25-20. The Card ended the weekend well, playing
its best volleyball in the fourth set to win 25-18,
capped by junior outside hitter Hayley Spelman's
kill.

Sophomore middle blocker Carly Wopat had a
huge night, posting a career-best 18 kills and lead
ing all players with 22 points. The young guns were
certainly carrying Stanford, as redshirt freshman
outside hitter Lydia Bai chipped in
with 16 kills of her own.The pair an
chored the Stanford offense on a
night when the Card desperately
needed someone to step up.
The Cardinal did not look like
the team that had dismantled
Washington in straight sets the
week before, but it is tough to be
disappointed with eight straight
wins. Stanford is now sitting only a
game out of second place in the
Pac-12 and has a very real possibili
ty of moving into first place by the
end of next week. First-place USC
and third-place UCLA, the last two
teams to beat the Cardinal, are
coming to town in what looks to be
a pair of critical weekend matches
on Friday and Saturday.
First serve for both matches will
be at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
