## Cardinal beats White in men's basketball scrimmage 
### â€“ Caroline Caselli 
Following the Cardinal's first Midday Madness an af
ternoon that featured meet-and-greets with players and
coaches, skills contests, player-led karaoke and a dunk com
petition the Stanford men's basketball team made its sea
son debut in the annual intrasquad Cardinal-White Scrim
mage.
Playing two 12-minute halves, the Cardinal squad bested
the White squad, 35-25. Sophomore forward Dwight Powell
registered the first points of the game on a dunk while fellow
sophomore forward Stefan Nastic sank two free throws on
the other end of the floor. The Cardinal squad controlled the
remainder of the scrimmage, going into the half with a 17-10
advantage and leading by as much as 33-16 following a three
pointer from sophomore guard Robbie Lemons with just
over four minutes remaining.
Nastic and sophomore forward Josh Fluestis, the winner
of the afternoon's dunk competition, led the Cardinal team
with six points apiece, while Nastic went 4-for-4 from the line
and Huestis grabbed five rebounds. True freshman point
guard Chasson Randle also picked up six points for the Car-
dinal in his Maples Pavilion debut,
and junior guard Gabriel Harris
dished three assists.

For the White squad, Powell and
sophomore forward John Gage led
with six points, and classmate An
thony Brown had three points and
eight rebounds.
"It was a good chance for the
players to play in a real game with
refs and for the crowd to be able to
watch us," said redshirt freshman
Andy Brown, who did not play in
the scrimmage but suited up and is
expected to return from multiple
ACL injuries this season.
Stanford will play its first exhibi

tion game on Nov. 5 against Ryer
son at Maples Pavilion.
