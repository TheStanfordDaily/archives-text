## Research makes new diamond Team creates similar carbon-based material 
### ALLY ARRIETA 
A team of Stanford earth science
researchers has pioneered the "amor
phous diamond," a new carbon mate
rial that is as hard as diamond but
lacks its crystalline structure.
The group, led by assistant pro
fessor of geological and environ
mental sciences Wendy Mao, is part
of the Stanford Extreme Environ
ments Laboratory and collaborat
ed with the Carnegie Institution of
Washington to discover this new
material.
The team began by investigating
how increased pressure on materi
als changes their structure, bonding
and, ultimately, their properties.
After testing other crystalline
structures, such as graphite and dia
mandoids, they decided to examine
glassy carbon, an amorphous car
bon material.
In order to put the glassy carbon
under high pressure, it was placed
in a device called a diamond-anvil
cell.
"We compressed a sample be
tween the tips of two diamonds, and
since pressure is force times unit
area, we could apply a pretty mod
est force between the tips of these
small diamonds and get really high
pressures," Mao said. "At really
high pressures, you can then change
from one phase to another."
Using techniques called X-ray
