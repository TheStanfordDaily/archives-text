## Research makes new diamond Team creates similar carbon-based material 
### ALLY ARRIETA 
A team of Stanford earth science
researchers has pioneered the "amor
phous diamond," a new carbon mate
rial that is as hard as diamond but
lacks its crystalline structure.
The group, led by assistant pro
fessor of geological and environ
mental sciences Wendy Mao, is part
of the Stanford Extreme Environ
ments Laboratory and collaborat
ed with the Carnegie Institution of
Washington to discover this new
material.
The team began by investigating
how increased pressure on materi
als changes their structure, bonding
and, ultimately, their properties.
After testing other crystalline
structures, such as graphite and dia
mandoids, they decided to examine
glassy carbon, an amorphous car
bon material.
In order to put the glassy carbon
under high pressure, it was placed
in a device called a diamond-anvil
cell.
"We compressed a sample be
tween the tips of two diamonds, and
since pressure is force times unit
area, we could apply a pretty mod
est force between the tips of these
small diamonds and get really high
pressures," Mao said. "At really
high pressures, you can then change
from one phase to another."
Using techniques called X-ray


CAROLINE SHEN/The Stanford Daily
diffraction and X-ray raman mi
croscopy, the team was able to
probe what was going on within
the sample at high pressure and
confirmed that it had not become
crystalline. Instead of taking on
the diamond's long-range struc
ture as expected, the material
transformed from an amorphous,
sheet-like substance to a super
hard, amorphous, diamond-like
material.

The next step was to test the
hardness of the material by detect
ing the stress it could withstand
and comparing it to the level the
diamond could handle.
"The diamond can withstand
stress of 100 gigapascals or over,"
said Yu Lin, a graduate student in
geological and environmental sci
ences who contributed to the re
search. "Here, with our final prod
uct, it can withstand a stress differ
ence of 70 gigapascals. No other
material except diamond can reach
this kind of stress difference."

Because the diamond is only
hard in certain directions and has
planes of weakness inherent in its
structure, it is easily cleavable. Ac
cording to Mao and Lin, the amor
phous diamond may not have the
same limitations.

"If something is amorphous,
you can imagine that in all direc
tions the hardness might be very
similar, so it could have more uni
form hardness," Mao said. "The

amorphous diamond has that very
attractive potential property."
Currently, amorphous diamond
only maintains its form at high
pressure and regresses to glassy
carbon when pressure is released.
However, the knowledge that the
material's hardness is tuned by
pressure change can be incorpo
rated into creating a stronger anvil
cell.

With further research to discov
er methods that preserve the
amorphous diamond in ambient
conditions or create it at lower
pressures, the uniformly hard ma
terial could have important appli
cations. Because of the material's
hardness and light weight, for ex
ample, it could potentially be used
for coding and cutting tools.

"Most of what we do is funda
mental research for the Depart
ment of Energy which funds our
research," Mao said. "Thinking 20
years down the road, we do 'dis
covery science' to find these inter
esting properties that people can
eventually use."
According to Mao, the material
may eventually generate a multi
billion-dollar industry similar to
that of the synthetic diamond,
which is valued for its use in jewel
ry and for cutting tools.
"Its a matter of how much peo
ple will want to make it," she said.
"We are many steps behind the di
amond, but the idea is that once
you find a material with a special
property, the industry may develop
around it."
