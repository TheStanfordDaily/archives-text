# Cardinal's huge win is a statistical field day
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Saturday's 65-21 win over
Washington was a dream
game for Stat on the Back.
Here's a look at how Stan
ford got it done.
Number of the game: 446
What it means: Stanford had 446
rushing yards against Washington.
Yep, that's really a four in the hun
dreds place.
Why it matters: Finishing with
146 rushing yards is a decent game
(about the average output in a col
lege football game), 246 is a great
game (better than any of Stanford's
first six games this year) and 346 is
an incredible game.
But 446? That's historically good.
In the 1,176 games Stanford played
before Saturday, the Cardinal had
never run for that many yards. The
previous best was 439, a record that
had stood for 30 years. Stanford had
only reached the 400-yard mark
twice in its history.
Putting up enormous totals is
great, and treating the alumni to a
spectacle at the Homecoming game
helps to energize the fan base. More
importantly, though, Stanford
proved to the entire country that it
can dominate any team it faces in
any way it wants.
Pundits across the country have
acted like Stanford football is An
drew Luck, and some have gone so
far as to say that without Luck, Stan
ford wouldn't even be a .500 team.
Those "experts" can eat Stepfan Tay
lor's dust. And Tyler Gaffney's. And
Anthony Wilkerson's. And the whole
offensive line's. Let's just say that
there's a lot of dust to go around.
Luck is great, and there have
been countless articles deservedly
ogling his saintliness on and off the
football field. He had an efficient
game through the air and his best
game of the season on the ground,
and his play-calling was perfectly ex
ecuted. But for once, this wasn't
about Luck. This wasn't even a "see,
other people can do things too"
game.
This was a statement. Stanford is
a great team with a great coach,
great defense, great offense, great
running backs, great quarterback,
great receivers, great fullbacks, great
tight ends and great lineman. Luck is
just one of the many pieces to the
Stanford puzzle.

Other notable numbers:
17: While looking at all these
stats, don't forget that Stanford was
n't playing Directional State. This
was supposed to be the toughest test
of the season for the Cardinal, and
Washington came in with a BCS
ranking. Further, the Huskies came
in ranked 17th in the country in run
defense. Washington had allowed 62
yards or fewer on the ground in four
of its six games this season. For the
year, the Huskies had only given up
582 yards on the season before giv
ing up 446 to Stanford. This one per
formance dropped Washington 40
spots from 17th in the country to
57th.
348: The trio of Taylor, Gaffney
and Wilkerson combined for 348
rushing yards and four touchdowns
on just 33 carries. Each had his own
highlights, including a run of at least
34 yards for each. Wilkerson was
just seven yards from being Stan
ford's third 100-yard rusher of the
game, which has never happened in
Cardinal history. Washington had
allowed just one 100-yard rusher in
its first six games.
65: Stanford didn't waste its
yards, racking up 65 points on Wash
ington. That is the second-most
points the Cardinal has ever scored
in conference play, trailing only the
82 scored by Pop Warner's 1925
Stanford team against UCLA.
Overall, the 65 points are the sev
enth most in Stanford history and
second most in the past 35 years.
21: Even while scoring all these
points, Luck threw the ball just 21
times. He was efficient with his pass
es, completing 16 for 169 yards and
two touchdowns, but he did not have
to do much. In the post-Toby Ger
hart era, the 21 attempts were the
second fewest by Luck, trailing only
the 20 from last year's Big Game.
Combined score of those two
games: 113-35 Stanford.
107: After allowing just 59.5 rush
ing yards per game, Stanford gave
up 107 yards on two long runs by
Chris Polk in the first half. The ab
sence of injured safety Delano
Howell was all too evident in the
tackling problems faced by Stan
ford's secondary.
1: Polk's 143 first-half rushing
yards were followed by just a single
rushing yard in the second half. As it

has all season, Stanford's defense
buckled down in the second half,
helping the Cardinal to outscore the
Huskies 48-7 after Polk's second
touchdown.

20: Once the ball gets to the 20-
yard line, Stanford goes from being
one of the nation's best teams to the
undisputed best in the country. The
Cardinal scored on all seven of its red
zone possessions on Saturday, keep
ing Stanford perfect on the season at
38-for-38. No other team has scored
on every trip to the red zone. On the
other side of the ball, the Cardinal is
second in the nation at keeping op
ponents off the scoreboard inside the
20. One of the biggest reasons is ...

2-for-ll: One of the silliest stats
you'll ever see is opponent field-goal
percentage. But in the case of Stan
ford, it has gotten absurd. For the
season, the Cardinal's opponents
have made just two of their 11 at
tempts, good for an 18-percent suc
cess rate. This is especially surprising
considering those same kickers have
combined to make 26 of their 32 at
tempts against everyone else, good
for an 81-percent success rate.
0: In what might be Stanford's
most impressive stat, the Cardinal
has trailed a grand total of zero times
this season. Zero is also the number
of other FBS teams that can say that.
10: Okay, maybe this is Stanford's
most impressive stat. The Cardinal
has now won 10 straight games by 25
points or more. No team has ever
done that in the 75-year history of
college football's poll system.
6: More important than any of
these stats is Stanford's standing in
the BCS. The Cardinal currently
ranks sixth, and with the upsets of
Oklahoma and Wisconsin, Stan
ford's path to the BCS National
Championship Game is getting in
creasingly simple. At this point, if the
Cardinal wins its next six games (a
tall order to be sure), Stanford
would likely need just one upset of
Oklahoma State to earn a spot in the
title game, because the Cardinal's
computer ranking should improve
enough in the coming weeks to pass
Boise State and Clemson.
2005: Stanford will travel to the
L.A. Coliseum to take on USC this
Saturday. The last time the Trojans
beat the Cardinal in Los Angeles
was 2005, marking the longest home
drought USC has against any of the
former Pac-10 teams. With ESPN's
College Game Day on campus, Sat
urday will prove if the Coliseum re
ally has become a second home for
the Cardinal.

Jacob Jaffe will be heading down to
the friendly confines of the Coliseum
on Saturday when Stanford takes on
USC. He firmly believes that ESPN
Game Day's Lee Corso will be suiting
up in Trojan armor, but wants to
know what other foolish things Corso
will do on set. Let him know at jw
