# Softball starts season off with 6-1 win over St. Mary's
## 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
The Stanford softball team kicked
off its fall schedule in style, riding
plenty of bench support to a 6-1 victo
ry over visiting St. Mary's on Friday
night.

Although last season ended with a
tough defeat one win away from the
Women's College World Series
Stanford lost on the road at Alabama
in the NCAA Super Regional the
Cardinal returns 17 players from a
team that went 42-17, finished the
season with a No. 10 national ranking
and made its 14th consecutive trip to
the NCAA Tournament.

Among the returners is three
time All-American Ashley Hansen.
The senior shortstop was the first
Stanford player named USA Softball
National Player of the Year after set
ting school records for batting aver
age (.495), hits (95) and slugging per
centage (.797) last year.
She didn't show any rust on Fri
day, smoking a double in her first at
bat to score senior center fielder
Sarah Hassman for the team's first
run of the year. Junior pitcher Teagan
Gerhart also looked good, not allow
ing a run in the circle during her first
action of the season. After her fresh
man campaign was cut short by an
arm injury, the Norco, Calif, native
went 26-13 with a 1.74 ERA and a
whopping 250 strikeouts last year in
her first full season on the Farm.

Although the team will likely suit
up veterans at most positions, the
game against the Gaels was a chance
to see some of the Card's young play
ers in their college debuts.The class of
2015 has eight new players Leah
White, Cassandra Roulund, Hanna
Winter, Lauren Donovan, Alyssa
Lombardo, Erin Ashby, Tylyn Wells
and Nyree White, who made her first
trip to the circle at Smith Family Sta
dium on Friday, giving up just one
run.

White, Gerhart and junior Jenna
Rich are currently the only pitchers
on the squad, and with Rich likely
locked into her spot at second base,
White will likely see the bulk of the
action behind Gerhart as she picks up
much of the slack left by the gradua
tion of pitcher Ashley Chinn.

The Cardinal has five more exhi
bition games before a 2012 season
that will provide a grueling gauntlet
of 20 teams that finished last year in
the top 25. Stanford will play host to
San Jose State on Friday at 6 p.m. be
fore playing a pair of doubleheaders
against San Francisco State and
Santa Clara in early November.
