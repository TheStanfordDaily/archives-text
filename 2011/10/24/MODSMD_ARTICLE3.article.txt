# Bike thefts remain top campus crime
## Reported numbers comparable to UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Davis 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Bike theft was the number-one reported
crime on campus last year, with a total of 329
bikes reported stolen, according to the Stanford
Department of Public Safety's (SDPS) annual
Stanford safety report released last month.
The number represents a modest decrease
from the 375 reported bike thefts in 2009 and the
353 in 2008. The decline in reported bike thefts is

SDPS believes an undetermined number of bi
cycle thefts go unreported by students each year,
which could make this number even higher.
Scott said the number represents around one
bike theft per day at a time when there are
approximately 13,000 bikes on campus daily, be
longing to both students and staff members.
The number of reported bike thefts at Stan
ford is comparable to the figure reported at
other California universities with large bike-rid
ing populations. Around 300 bike thefts are re

ported stolen each year at UC-Santa Barbara,
according to the university's bicycle program of
ficer Matt Stern. And 500 to 600 are reported
stolen annually at UC-Davis, according its bicy
cle coordinator David Takemoto-Weerts.
There are 14,000 bicycles on UC-Santa Bar
bara's campus each day, according to Stern, and
15,000 to 20,000 at UC-Davis, according to Take
moto-Weerts.
"In the case of Davis, and I think in other big
cycling campuses like Stanford and Santa Bar
bara, you have a high concentration of bikes in a
