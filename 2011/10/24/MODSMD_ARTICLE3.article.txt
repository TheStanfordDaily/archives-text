# Bike thefts remain top campus crime
## Reported numbers comparable to UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Davis 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
Bike theft was the number-one reported
crime on campus last year, with a total of 329
bikes reported stolen, according to the Stanford
Department of Public Safety's (SDPS) annual
Stanford safety report released last month.
The number represents a modest decrease
from the 375 reported bike thefts in 2009 and the
353 in 2008. The decline in reported bike thefts is
a "good sign," according to Stanford bicycle pro
gram coordinator Ariadne Scott.
However, the frequency of bike thefts has not

changed "too much" since past years, according
to SDPS public information officer Bill Larson
in an email to The Daily. Larson noted that
SDPS believes an undetermined number of bi
cycle thefts go unreported by students each year,
which could make this number even higher.
Scott said the number represents around one
bike theft per day at a time when there are
approximately 13,000 bikes on campus daily, be
longing to both students and staff members.
The number of reported bike thefts at Stan
ford is comparable to the figure reported at
other California universities with large bike-rid
ing populations. Around 300 bike thefts are re

ported stolen each year at UC-Santa Barbara,
according to the university's bicycle program of
ficer Matt Stern. And 500 to 600 are reported
stolen annually at UC-Davis, according its bicy
cle coordinator David Takemoto-Weerts.
There are 14,000 bicycles on UC-Santa Bar
bara's campus each day, according to Stern, and
15,000 to 20,000 at UC-Davis, according to Take
moto-Weerts.
"In the case of Davis, and I think in other big
cycling campuses like Stanford and Santa Bar
bara, you have a high concentration of bikes in a
really small area," Takemoto-
Weerts said. "You can practically, as
a bike thief, take orders of certain
makes and colors and frame sizes ..

. and find that bike just looking
around for 10 to 15 minutes."

The League of American Bicy
clists recognized all three of these
universities last year for their com
mitment to bike friendliness. Stan
ford received the organization's top
"platinum" award, while both UC-
Davis and UC-Santa Barbara won
the "gold" award.

Focusing on prevention
Last spring quarter, Stanford
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (PT&S) conducted a study of
the 18,000 bike rack spaces on cam
pus, Scott said.
According to Scott, the purpose
of the study was to find out where
the highest density of parked bikes
was and where on campus there
weren't enough racks to meet the
needs of students. She said PT&S
discovered that there was a demand
for parking spaces at areas such as
Tresidder Memorial Union, the En
gineering Quad and the new Arrilla
ga Family Dining Commons.
"There's a demand for parking,
but all of these will be addressed,"
she said.

Scott said that PT&S is currently
working with Stanford's planning
office to put new racks in these spots
and that this may help to curb the
number of bike thefts in the future.
According to Larson, most of the
bikes that are reported stolen on
campus were either not locked or
not properly secured to a bike rack.
According to Scott, one of the
biggest ways the University at
tempts to fight bike theft is by edu
cating students on how to best pro
tect their bikes, especially during
New Student Orientation (NSO)
week at the beginning of each year.
"During the new school year, we
obviously do focus on new students
coming, because a lot of them
haven't been on a bike in awhile,"
Scott said. "I hear comments, 'The
last time I rode a bike, I was in grade
school.' So it's an easy target to
focus on those new students coming
in, because we want to change their
behavior while they're here,"
At NSO, PT&S emphasizes the
importance of registering one's

bike, according to Scott. She said 85
to 90 percent of this year's incoming
freshman class registered their
bikes during NSO week, which she
said is representative of the percent
age of bikes registered in other
classes. Bike registration costs $3.50
and is valid for three years.
"The key thing when you register
your bike is that you have legal
proof that the bike belongs to you,"
Scott said. "Say if the bike is lost or
stolen, and the bike is returned to
Public Safety, then there's away to
reunite you with the bike, and they
can prove that the bike belongs to
you."

Both Larson and Scott said they
also recommend students lock their
bikes to a bike rack with a U-lock as
opposed to a cable lock.
However, a plurality of bikes that
were reported stolen between June
1 and Oct. 9 were also reported to be
U-locked at the time the crime oc
curred. Of the 136 bikes reported
stolen during this time frame, 48
were reported to be U-locked, 43
were cable-locked, 23 were un
locked, seven were chain-locked
and 15 were categorized as locked in
a miscellaneous manner.
Stern said a similar trend has
been seen at UC-Santa Barbara.

"I think that makes sense, be
cause a U-lock is probably the most
widely used lock," Stern said. "It's
probably the best way to secure
your bike provided that you se
cure it properly."

Reporting bike thefts
UC-Davis conducts a campus
wide survey every year to collect
data about the travel habits of those
affiliated with the university. Last
year,Takemoto-Weerts said the sur
vey included two new questions:
have you ever had your bike stolen,
and did you report the theft?
"The results of those two ques
tions indicated that if 500-600 bike
thefts were reported annually on
campus, then in reality, there might
be as many as 2000-3000 bike thefts
taking place, because most people
do not report bike thefts," he said.
Larson said that bike thefts do go
unreported at Stanford as well, but
that the department is "unable to
determine or estimate these per
centages. "
According to Larson, students
who do not report a bike theft most
likely do so either because they
don't feel they have the time or be
cause they feel the "chances of re
covery are slim to none." At Stan
ford, "very few" stolen bikes are

ever reclaimed, Larson said. He did
not give numerical data.
He said that the department still
encourages the reporting of a theft
because it may result in the recovery
of the bike, as well as serving statis
tical purposes that could lead to tar
geted surveillance of certain areas.
One third of stolen bicycles are
recovered at UC-Santa Barbara, ac
cording to Stern. Stern said that this
number was six times the national
average. He attributed the high re
covery rate to the fact that the
school's police department heavily
enforces bike violations, and be
cause it has 90 employees who are
dedicated to bike enforcement.

"Because we have so many bicy
cles, we have a lot of bicycle enforce
ment issues, as you'd expect in a city
with cars," Stern said. "So we do a lot
of traffic enforcement, and we do a
lot of parking enforcement... and
every time an officer stops and en
forces a bicycle violation, the bikes
are checked [to see if they are
stolen]."

Bikes are recovered in a similar
way at Stanford, Larson said. He
said the main ways bicycles are re
covered is during a violation stop,
during the investigation of a similar
or unrelated crime or if the bicycle
has been abandoned.
The serial numbers of these
bikes are checked against a
statewide database of stolen prop
erty, called the Automated Property
System (APS).
"Even without a bicycle license,
we can still enter the serial or frame
number and bicycle description into
the shared stolen-property data
base," Larson said. "However, a bi
cycle license is much preferred since
it would allow us to search the li
cense number for owner informa
tion."
Analysis of thefts
175 bike thefts occurred at stu
dent residences last year, according

to the Stanford safety report. This
accounts for more than 50 percent
of the total number of bike thefts
that occurred on campus.

"We believe the main reason is
because there is usually a higher
concentration of bicycles parked at
residences rather than at other
buildings on campus, especially at
night," Larson said.
According to Larson, Student
Housing has hired a private security
contractor to patrol student resi
dences at night, and this group re
ports any suspicious activity in
cluding any possible bike theft to
the SDPS.

He said, however, that a majority
of bikes are stolen during the day.
"More bikes are stolen during
the day than at night, since there are
more bicyclists from on and off cam
pus who attend class, work [and]
special events," Larson said.

Larson said the SDPS believes
that individuals from outside of the
community, working in pairs or
groups, commit the majority of bike
thefts, but students have also been
occasionally arrested for bike theft.

Takemoto-Weerts said that
those outside of the community

commit a majority of the bike thefts
at UC-Davis as well.
"In the occasional instances
where somebody's arrested, it's
often somebody from out of town.
And they catch them in the middle
of night driving through campus
with a couple of old bikes," Take
moto-Weerts said. "In those cases,
[the suspects] often have a prior
record for drug violations. And we
think a lot of people are stealing
bikes with the idea of stealing a
$3OO bike, and then you can turn
around and sell it for $5O on
Craigslist to get your next hit."
However, Stern said that he be
lieves students commit a majority of
the bike thefts at UC-Santa Bar
bara. He said students steal bikes ei
ther to get extra income, because
they are frustrated that their own
bike got stolen or because they are
intoxicated.
"There's no free ride when it
comes to bicycle safety," Scott said.
"We want people to ride. Safety is our
number-one priority, and deterring
bike theft is a part of bike safety."

There's no free ride
when it comes to
bicycle safety.
ARIADNE SCOTT,
bicycle program
coordinator
Bike theft was the number-one reported
crime on campus last year, with a total of 329
bikes reported stolen, according to the Stanford
Department of Public Safety's (SDPS) annual
Stanford safety report released last month.
The number represents a modest decrease
from the 375 reported bike thefts in 2009 and the
353 in 2008. The decline in reported bike thefts is
a "good sign," according to Stanford bicycle pro
gram coordinator Ariadne Scott.
However, the frequency of bike thefts has not

changed "too much" since past years, according
to SDPS public information officer Bill Larson
in an email to The Daily. Larson noted that
SDPS believes an undetermined number of bi
cycle thefts go unreported by students each year,
which could make this number even higher.
Scott said the number represents around one
bike theft per day at a time when there are
approximately 13,000 bikes on campus daily, be
longing to both students and staff members.
The number of reported bike thefts at Stan
ford is comparable to the figure reported at
other California universities with large bike-rid
ing populations. Around 300 bike thefts are re

ported stolen each year at UC-Santa Barbara,
according to the university's bicycle program of
ficer Matt Stern. And 500 to 600 are reported
stolen annually at UC-Davis, according its bicy
cle coordinator David Takemoto-Weerts.
There are 14,000 bicycles on UC-Santa Bar
bara's campus each day, according to Stern, and
15,000 to 20,000 at UC-Davis, according to Take
moto-Weerts.
"In the case of Davis, and I think in other big
cycling campuses like Stanford and Santa Bar
bara, you have a high concentration of bikes in a
really small area," Takemoto-
Weerts said. "You can practically, as
a bike thief, take orders of certain
makes and colors and frame sizes ..

. and find that bike just looking
around for 10 to 15 minutes."

The League of American Bicy
clists recognized all three of these
universities last year for their com
mitment to bike friendliness. Stan
ford received the organization's top
"platinum" award, while both UC-
Davis and UC-Santa Barbara won
the "gold" award.

Focusing on prevention
Last spring quarter, Stanford
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (PT&S) conducted a study of
the 18,000 bike rack spaces on cam
pus, Scott said.
According to Scott, the purpose
of the study was to find out where
the highest density of parked bikes
was and where on campus there
weren't enough racks to meet the
needs of students. She said PT&S
discovered that there was a demand
for parking spaces at areas such as
Tresidder Memorial Union, the En
gineering Quad and the new Arrilla
ga Family Dining Commons.
"There's a demand for parking,
but all of these will be addressed,"
she said.

Scott said that PT&S is currently
working with Stanford's planning
office to put new racks in these spots
and that this may help to curb the
number of bike thefts in the future.
According to Larson, most of the
bikes that are reported stolen on
campus were either not locked or
not properly secured to a bike rack.
According to Scott, one of the
biggest ways the University at
tempts to fight bike theft is by edu
cating students on how to best pro
tect their bikes, especially during
New Student Orientation (NSO)
week at the beginning of each year.
"During the new school year, we
obviously do focus on new students
coming, because a lot of them
haven't been on a bike in awhile,"
Scott said. "I hear comments, 'The
last time I rode a bike, I was in grade
school.' So it's an easy target to
focus on those new students coming
in, because we want to change their
behavior while they're here,"
At NSO, PT&S emphasizes the
importance of registering one's

bike, according to Scott. She said 85
to 90 percent of this year's incoming
freshman class registered their
bikes during NSO week, which she
said is representative of the percent
age of bikes registered in other
classes. Bike registration costs $3.50
and is valid for three years.
"The key thing when you register
your bike is that you have legal
proof that the bike belongs to you,"
Scott said. "Say if the bike is lost or
stolen, and the bike is returned to
Public Safety, then there's away to
reunite you with the bike, and they
can prove that the bike belongs to
you."

Both Larson and Scott said they
also recommend students lock their
bikes to a bike rack with a U-lock as
opposed to a cable lock.
However, a plurality of bikes that
were reported stolen between June
1 and Oct. 9 were also reported to be
U-locked at the time the crime oc
curred. Of the 136 bikes reported
stolen during this time frame, 48
were reported to be U-locked, 43
were cable-locked, 23 were un
locked, seven were chain-locked
and 15 were categorized as locked in
a miscellaneous manner.
Stern said a similar trend has
been seen at UC-Santa Barbara.

"I think that makes sense, be
cause a U-lock is probably the most
widely used lock," Stern said. "It's
probably the best way to secure
your bike provided that you se
cure it properly."

Reporting bike thefts
UC-Davis conducts a campus
wide survey every year to collect
data about the travel habits of those
affiliated with the university. Last
year,Takemoto-Weerts said the sur
vey included two new questions:
have you ever had your bike stolen,
and did you report the theft?
"The results of those two ques
tions indicated that if 500-600 bike
thefts were reported annually on
campus, then in reality, there might
be as many as 2000-3000 bike thefts
taking place, because most people
do not report bike thefts," he said.
Larson said that bike thefts do go
unreported at Stanford as well, but
that the department is "unable to
determine or estimate these per
centages. "
According to Larson, students
who do not report a bike theft most
likely do so either because they
don't feel they have the time or be
cause they feel the "chances of re
covery are slim to none." At Stan
ford, "very few" stolen bikes are

ever reclaimed, Larson said. He did
not give numerical data.
He said that the department still
encourages the reporting of a theft
because it may result in the recovery
of the bike, as well as serving statis
tical purposes that could lead to tar
geted surveillance of certain areas.
One third of stolen bicycles are
recovered at UC-Santa Barbara, ac
cording to Stern. Stern said that this
number was six times the national
average. He attributed the high re
covery rate to the fact that the
school's police department heavily
enforces bike violations, and be
cause it has 90 employees who are
dedicated to bike enforcement.

"Because we have so many bicy
cles, we have a lot of bicycle enforce
ment issues, as you'd expect in a city
with cars," Stern said. "So we do a lot
of traffic enforcement, and we do a
lot of parking enforcement... and
every time an officer stops and en
forces a bicycle violation, the bikes
are checked [to see if they are
stolen]."

Bikes are recovered in a similar
way at Stanford, Larson said. He
said the main ways bicycles are re
covered is during a violation stop,
during the investigation of a similar
or unrelated crime or if the bicycle
has been abandoned.
The serial numbers of these
bikes are checked against a
statewide database of stolen prop
erty, called the Automated Property
System (APS).
"Even without a bicycle license,
we can still enter the serial or frame
number and bicycle description into
the shared stolen-property data
base," Larson said. "However, a bi
cycle license is much preferred since
it would allow us to search the li
cense number for owner informa
tion."
Analysis of thefts
175 bike thefts occurred at stu
dent residences last year, according

to the Stanford safety report. This
accounts for more than 50 percent
of the total number of bike thefts
that occurred on campus.

"We believe the main reason is
because there is usually a higher
concentration of bicycles parked at
residences rather than at other
buildings on campus, especially at
night," Larson said.
According to Larson, Student
Housing has hired a private security
contractor to patrol student resi
dences at night, and this group re
ports any suspicious activity in
cluding any possible bike theft to
the SDPS.

He said, however, that a majority
of bikes are stolen during the day.
"More bikes are stolen during
the day than at night, since there are
more bicyclists from on and off cam
pus who attend class, work [and]
special events," Larson said.

Larson said the SDPS believes
that individuals from outside of the
community, working in pairs or
groups, commit the majority of bike
thefts, but students have also been
occasionally arrested for bike theft.

Takemoto-Weerts said that
those outside of the community

commit a majority of the bike thefts
at UC-Davis as well.
"In the occasional instances
where somebody's arrested, it's
often somebody from out of town.
And they catch them in the middle
of night driving through campus
with a couple of old bikes," Take
moto-Weerts said. "In those cases,
[the suspects] often have a prior
record for drug violations. And we
think a lot of people are stealing
bikes with the idea of stealing a
$3OO bike, and then you can turn
around and sell it for $5O on
Craigslist to get your next hit."
However, Stern said that he be
lieves students commit a majority of
the bike thefts at UC-Santa Bar
bara. He said students steal bikes ei
ther to get extra income, because
they are frustrated that their own
bike got stolen or because they are
intoxicated.
"There's no free ride when it
comes to bicycle safety," Scott said.
"We want people to ride. Safety is our
number-one priority, and deterring
bike theft is a part of bike safety."

There's no free ride
when it comes to
bicycle safety.
ARIADNE SCOTT,
bicycle program
coordinator
Bike theft was the number-one reported
crime on campus last year, with a total of 329
bikes reported stolen, according to the Stanford
Department of Public Safety's (SDPS) annual
Stanford safety report released last month.
The number represents a modest decrease
from the 375 reported bike thefts in 2009 and the
353 in 2008. The decline in reported bike thefts is
a "good sign," according to Stanford bicycle pro
gram coordinator Ariadne Scott.
However, the frequency of bike thefts has not

changed "too much" since past years, according
to SDPS public information officer Bill Larson
in an email to The Daily. Larson noted that
SDPS believes an undetermined number of bi
cycle thefts go unreported by students each year,
which could make this number even higher.
Scott said the number represents around one
bike theft per day at a time when there are
approximately 13,000 bikes on campus daily, be
longing to both students and staff members.
The number of reported bike thefts at Stan
ford is comparable to the figure reported at
other California universities with large bike-rid
ing populations. Around 300 bike thefts are re

ported stolen each year at UC-Santa Barbara,
according to the university's bicycle program of
ficer Matt Stern. And 500 to 600 are reported
stolen annually at UC-Davis, according its bicy
cle coordinator David Takemoto-Weerts.
There are 14,000 bicycles on UC-Santa Bar
bara's campus each day, according to Stern, and
15,000 to 20,000 at UC-Davis, according to Take
moto-Weerts.
"In the case of Davis, and I think in other big
cycling campuses like Stanford and Santa Bar
bara, you have a high concentration of bikes in a
really small area," Takemoto-
Weerts said. "You can practically, as
a bike thief, take orders of certain
makes and colors and frame sizes ..

. and find that bike just looking
around for 10 to 15 minutes."

The League of American Bicy
clists recognized all three of these
universities last year for their com
mitment to bike friendliness. Stan
ford received the organization's top
"platinum" award, while both UC-
Davis and UC-Santa Barbara won
the "gold" award.

Focusing on prevention
Last spring quarter, Stanford
Parking and Transportation Ser
vices (PT&S) conducted a study of
the 18,000 bike rack spaces on cam
pus, Scott said.
According to Scott, the purpose
of the study was to find out where
the highest density of parked bikes
was and where on campus there
weren't enough racks to meet the
needs of students. She said PT&S
discovered that there was a demand
for parking spaces at areas such as
Tresidder Memorial Union, the En
gineering Quad and the new Arrilla
ga Family Dining Commons.
"There's a demand for parking,
but all of these will be addressed,"
she said.

Scott said that PT&S is currently
working with Stanford's planning
office to put new racks in these spots
and that this may help to curb the
number of bike thefts in the future.
According to Larson, most of the
bikes that are reported stolen on
campus were either not locked or
not properly secured to a bike rack.
According to Scott, one of the
biggest ways the University at
tempts to fight bike theft is by edu
cating students on how to best pro
tect their bikes, especially during
New Student Orientation (NSO)
week at the beginning of each year.
"During the new school year, we
obviously do focus on new students
coming, because a lot of them
haven't been on a bike in awhile,"
Scott said. "I hear comments, 'The
last time I rode a bike, I was in grade
school.' So it's an easy target to
focus on those new students coming
in, because we want to change their
behavior while they're here,"
At NSO, PT&S emphasizes the
importance of registering one's

bike, according to Scott. She said 85
to 90 percent of this year's incoming
freshman class registered their
bikes during NSO week, which she
said is representative of the percent
age of bikes registered in other
classes. Bike registration costs $3.50
and is valid for three years.
"The key thing when you register
your bike is that you have legal
proof that the bike belongs to you,"
Scott said. "Say if the bike is lost or
stolen, and the bike is returned to
Public Safety, then there's away to
reunite you with the bike, and they
can prove that the bike belongs to
you."

Both Larson and Scott said they
also recommend students lock their
bikes to a bike rack with a U-lock as
opposed to a cable lock.
However, a plurality of bikes that
were reported stolen between June
1 and Oct. 9 were also reported to be
U-locked at the time the crime oc
curred. Of the 136 bikes reported
stolen during this time frame, 48
were reported to be U-locked, 43
were cable-locked, 23 were un
locked, seven were chain-locked
and 15 were categorized as locked in
a miscellaneous manner.
Stern said a similar trend has
been seen at UC-Santa Barbara.

"I think that makes sense, be
cause a U-lock is probably the most
widely used lock," Stern said. "It's
probably the best way to secure
your bike provided that you se
cure it properly."

Reporting bike thefts
UC-Davis conducts a campus
wide survey every year to collect
data about the travel habits of those
affiliated with the university. Last
year,Takemoto-Weerts said the sur
vey included two new questions:
have you ever had your bike stolen,
and did you report the theft?
"The results of those two ques
tions indicated that if 500-600 bike
thefts were reported annually on
campus, then in reality, there might
be as many as 2000-3000 bike thefts
taking place, because most people
do not report bike thefts," he said.
Larson said that bike thefts do go
unreported at Stanford as well, but
that the department is "unable to
determine or estimate these per
centages. "
According to Larson, students
who do not report a bike theft most
likely do so either because they
don't feel they have the time or be
cause they feel the "chances of re
covery are slim to none." At Stan
ford, "very few" stolen bikes are

ever reclaimed, Larson said. He did
not give numerical data.
He said that the department still
encourages the reporting of a theft
because it may result in the recovery
of the bike, as well as serving statis
tical purposes that could lead to tar
geted surveillance of certain areas.
One third of stolen bicycles are
recovered at UC-Santa Barbara, ac
cording to Stern. Stern said that this
number was six times the national
average. He attributed the high re
covery rate to the fact that the
school's police department heavily
enforces bike violations, and be
cause it has 90 employees who are
dedicated to bike enforcement.

"Because we have so many bicy
cles, we have a lot of bicycle enforce
ment issues, as you'd expect in a city
with cars," Stern said. "So we do a lot
of traffic enforcement, and we do a
lot of parking enforcement... and
every time an officer stops and en
forces a bicycle violation, the bikes
are checked [to see if they are
stolen]."

Bikes are recovered in a similar
way at Stanford, Larson said. He
said the main ways bicycles are re
covered is during a violation stop,
during the investigation of a similar
or unrelated crime or if the bicycle
has been abandoned.
The serial numbers of these
bikes are checked against a
statewide database of stolen prop
erty, called the Automated Property
System (APS).
"Even without a bicycle license,
we can still enter the serial or frame
number and bicycle description into
the shared stolen-property data
base," Larson said. "However, a bi
cycle license is much preferred since
it would allow us to search the li
cense number for owner informa
tion."
Analysis of thefts
175 bike thefts occurred at stu
dent residences last year, according

to the Stanford safety report. This
accounts for more than 50 percent
of the total number of bike thefts
that occurred on campus.

"We believe the main reason is
because there is usually a higher
concentration of bicycles parked at
residences rather than at other
buildings on campus, especially at
night," Larson said.
According to Larson, Student
Housing has hired a private security
contractor to patrol student resi
dences at night, and this group re
ports any suspicious activity in
cluding any possible bike theft to
the SDPS.

He said, however, that a majority
of bikes are stolen during the day.
"More bikes are stolen during
the day than at night, since there are
more bicyclists from on and off cam
pus who attend class, work [and]
special events," Larson said.

Larson said the SDPS believes
that individuals from outside of the
community, working in pairs or
groups, commit the majority of bike
thefts, but students have also been
occasionally arrested for bike theft.

Takemoto-Weerts said that
those outside of the community

commit a majority of the bike thefts
at UC-Davis as well.
"In the occasional instances
where somebody's arrested, it's
often somebody from out of town.
And they catch them in the middle
of night driving through campus
with a couple of old bikes," Take
moto-Weerts said. "In those cases,
[the suspects] often have a prior
record for drug violations. And we
think a lot of people are stealing
bikes with the idea of stealing a
$3OO bike, and then you can turn
around and sell it for $5O on
Craigslist to get your next hit."
However, Stern said that he be
lieves students commit a majority of
the bike thefts at UC-Santa Bar
bara. He said students steal bikes ei
ther to get extra income, because
they are frustrated that their own
bike got stolen or because they are
intoxicated.

number-one priority, and deterring
