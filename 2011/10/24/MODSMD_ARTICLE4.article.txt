## Reunion Homecoming attracts 6,000 alumni 
### EDWARD NGAI 
Over 6,000 Stanford alumni re
turned to campus this past week
end to celebrate their fifth through
70th class reunions.
Nearly 10,000 individuals, in

eluding alumni and their guests,
gathered Thursday to reacquaint
themselves with former classmates
and developments on campus.
After commencing with a formal
dinner on the Quad Thursday
evening, this year's Homecoming

featured alumni traditions such as
class panels and the sixth annual
Roundtable discussion, themed
this year on education.
The weekend also incorporated
new events such as a singles' mixer
and an "Amazing Race" scavenger

hunt for alums with kids. Special
guests and honorees included
Susan Rice 'B6, U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, and Cory
Booker B.A. '9l M.S. '92, mayor of
Newark, N.J.

"The mission of the Alumni As
sociation is to serve and engage all
the alumni in an attempt to create
lifelong intellectual and emotional
connections between the Universi
ty and its graduates," said Howard
Wolf 'BO, president of the Stanford
Alumni Association. "Nothing
comes close to doing that better
than Reunion Homecoming. It
nourishes them both intellectually
and emotionally. It's just a wonder
ful way to reconnect with each
other and the institution."
Reunion Homecoming attract
ed a range of guests, from months
old babies traveling with their par
ents to alums celebrating their 77th
reunions, such as Marcus Krupp
'34. Returnees came from 37 states
and countries such as Australia,
Singapore and Peru.
"I just look forward to recon
necting with old friends, reac
quainting myself and just enjoying
Stanford as a significant part of my
life once again," said Ben Stolpa
'66.
Alumni found a vareity of the
400 events to be worthwhile.
"I'll never miss the Saturday
morning Roundtable ... whatever
the topic, I [am] just flabbergasted

Alumni attending this year's Reunion Homecoming enjoyed several traditional events such as class panels and
the sixth annual roundtable discussion, as well as a football game against the University of Washington.
by some of the issues I hadn't even
thought about," Stolpa said.
Valerie Seymour B.A. 'Ol M.S. 'O3
cited "the class parties, for sure, and
some of the classes without quizzes,
maybe,"

Meanwhile, Hilary Link '9l high
lighted Saturday's football game
against the University of Washington.
Saturday night's game against
Washington drew over 4,500 alum
ni, seated together by class.

"The classes of '66 to 'B6 are in the
northwest corner, and the classes of
'9l to 'O6 are in the southeast cor
ner," said Richard Muschell, assis
tant director of athletics and director
of ticket sales. "It carves out about a
quarter of the [general] seating, the
older classes."

An estimated 9,000 people at
tended the tailgates on Saturday, ac
cording to Leslie Winick, director of
alumni class outreach and one of
the architects of Homecoming Re
union. "And you will see two people
who haven't seen each other in five
or 15 or 40 years, and they'll go run
ning towards each other screaming.

'I know you; you know me!' even
though they haven't seen each other
in 20 years. It's my favorite thing."
Each Homecoming Reunion op
eration takes a full year to plan and
relies upon hundreds of people.
"We have a team of 30 people
who work on this all year long, an
extended team of 400 staff across
campus who volunteer: faculty, staff,
athletics, ethnic community centers
there are so many partnerships,"
Winick said. "The secret is that we
all move in the same direction. It's
about connecting [the alumni] back
to each other. I see people who are
celebrating their 70th reunion, and
they're still talking about when they
were freshmen. It's amazing."
"I'm most proud that there is
momentum," she said. "The fifth,
10th, 15th and 20th reunions [are]
growing every year. Even with Face
book, people are coming across the
country, leaving early from their
jobs and coming to Stanford."

Wolf commented on what con
tinues to draw years "of Stanford
history" back to the Farm.
"We all have something in com
mon," he said. "We're all a part of
Stanford, and we always will be."
