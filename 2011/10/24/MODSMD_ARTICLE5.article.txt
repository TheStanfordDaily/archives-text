## Palo Alto to vote on binding arbitration Nov. 8 
### SARAH MOORE 
Palo Alto citizens are set to
vote Nov. 8 on Measure D, which
proposes ending the mandatory
binding arbitration for debates
between public safety workers
and management, which has been
in place for 33 years.

This bargaining tool, in which a
neutral third party settles dis
agreements with management,
binds both parties to the decisions
of the arbitrator. In more than
three decades, binding arbitration
has only been used in Palo Alto six
times.
Advocates of Measure D argue

that the city, not a third party,
should have control of matters
such as pensions and long-term
benefits for city workers, while
dissenters state that the measure
will take away the collective bar
gaining rights of public safety
workers.

Tues., Oct. 11, council members

and the public assembled for a
forum about the measure at City
Hall. The city council voted 5-4 to
put the issue on the ballot.
"[Binding arbitration] has
been harmful in the past," said
councilman Greg Scharff."The ar-
bitrators are pretty pro-union, and
it's very difficult to make needed
structural change."
Scharff is joined by four other
council members in supporting
Measure D, while two oppose it and
two more remain neutral on the
subject.
Those individuals opposed to
the measure believe that the main
concern is not the ease with which
the city makes structural change
but the protection of the rights of
public safety workers.
"Without this special form of
binding arbitration, they end up
having no bargaining power," said
Palo Alto community member and
attorney Richard Alexander. "So
without Measure D on the books,
they can be forced to work under
the terms and conditions dictated
by the city. That includes not only
hours and pay but working condi
tions, grievances and a whole range
of labor issues."

The Palo Alto Fire Fighters and
groups such as the Dean Democra

tic Club of Silicon Valley and the
Santa Clara Democratic Party join
Scharff in opposition to the meas
ure.

"We don't like it because it takes
away the collective bargaining
rights of the fire fighters and the po
lice officers," said Palo Alto Fire
Fighters Union President Tony Spi
taleri. "We're working with the city
council members and community
resources to get the message out."
Nonetheless, proponents of the
measure argue that the removal of
binding arbitration will not leave
public safety workers without rep
resentation.

"The public safety workers will
have all of their collective bargain
ing rights," Scharff said. "There's a
new bill that the governor just
signed, that when you have a dis
agreement with ... unionized em
ployees in the public sector, you
have to go through basically a non
binding arbitration process."
Scharff also noted that 95 per
cent of cities in California do not
have binding arbitration.
As for other Palo Alto city
unions, binding arbitration is not
used because workers are allowed
to strike in order to negotiate with
management. Public safety workers

are not permitted to use this type of
protest.

One main divide between pro
ponents and opponents of Measure
D is a disagreement on what the
fundamental issue of the measure
itself is. Those on one side of the ar
gument believe the main concern
that voters should consider is the
ability of the city to make key
changes in the public safety system.
Groups on the other side consider
the issue at stake to be the entitle
ment of fire fighters and police to
hold collective negotiations.
Furthermore, as Stanford pays
for a third of the Palo Alto fire
fighters' payroll and a quarter of
their costs for fire engines and other
capital equipment, the decision that
Palo Alto voters make on Measure
D will dictate the process that de
cides how University money is
spent.

Voters will see Measure D on
their special election ballots Nov. 8,
accompanied by the more highly
publicized Measure E, which would
allow 10 acres of Byxbee Park to be
designated for the establishment of
a waste-to-energy facility.
