The sixth annual roundtable at Stanford featured panelists John Hennessy, Claude Steele, Kim Smith, Salman
Khan, Cory Booker and Reed Hastings and moderator Charlie Rose discussing education in America.
CEO of Netflix and former president
of the California State Board of Edu
cation. PBS talk show host Charlie
Rose moderated the discussion.
When asked about the current
state of K-12 education in the United
States, panelists agreed that it is out of
date and that the system needs to
change. However, they all also ex
pressed optimism about increased at
tention to the plights of the educa
tional system.
"We have been doing things the
same way for 100 years," Smith said.
"This is a real inflection point for
American education."

"All our assumptions [about edu
cation] will be rethought in a positive
way," Khan said.
Several models for rethinking the
education system were brought up
during the discussion. Hastings sug
gested that the biggest problem in
American schools is the system of
elected school boards and predicted
that, one day, all schools will be run by
nonprofit charter organizations.
Booker also praised charter
schools.

"Charter schools have challenged
the pernicious bigotry that says that
not all kids are capable of learning,"
he stated.
Steele added that he sees the fact
that charter schools are open to inno
vation and willing to explore new
teaching and learning styles as their
primary significance. President Hen
nessy, meanwhile, expressed that be
cause charter schools compete with
public schools, they push public
schools to be better.

Panelists also expressed technolo
gy as another solution to the educa
tion crisis. All the speakers stressed
that introducing technology into the
classroom does not make teachers
obsolete; in fact, it can make teachers
more effective by allowing them to
personalize lessons for each individ
ual student.

Hastings cited the example of
Rocketship Education, a charter
school system founded by John Dan
ner 'BB that is strongly rooted in tech
nology-based education.
"Right now, Rocketship [schools]
have test scores that are even slightly

higher than Palo Alto and they are
doing it at lower costs," he said.

The conversation also focused on
how to support and foster good
teachers.

Hennessy stated that in order to
attract more college graduates to the
teaching profession, "we need to pay
[teachers] and treat them as profes
sionals."

He cited the fact that currently the
majority of teachers come from the
bottom quartile of college graduates.
"Great teachers have something
amazing called 'learned optimism,'
and they pass that on to their stu
dents," Smith said.

She also said that through her
work with Teach for America, she has
seen that great teachers share a few
traits: knowledge of the subject area,
passion for teaching and energy to
share that passion with others.
Nonetheless, panelists expressed
that there is no singular solution that
will solve all of America's education
woes.

"Lots of people have this mistak
en belief that everyone should want
the same thing or that the same thing
works for everyone," Smith said.

Dennis Arch '66, who came "for
exposure to the panelists and to the
problem of education reform," said
he found the discussion very inform
ative.

Furthermore, Annie Davids 'B7, a
middle school math teacher at a char
ter school, reviewed the event posi
tively.
"All the panelists were fantastic,"
she said. "Cory Booker was amazing.
He is really in the trenches, so it was
interesting to hear his take on every
thing."
