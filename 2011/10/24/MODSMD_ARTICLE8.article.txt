## LGBT Community Resources Center celebrates 40th anniversary 
### KATIE MURPHY 
The LGBT alumni network
Stanford pride hosted a "40 and Fab
ulous" anniversary celebration for
the LGBT Community Resources
Center on Saturday as part of Re
union Homecoming weekend, hon
oring U.S. ambassador to the United
States Susan Rice 'B6 as well as key
members of the organization.
The event had over 150 people in
attendance. In addition to Rice,
Stanford Pride honored some of its
pioneer members including Maud
Nerman '7l, founder of Stanford's
Gay People's Union, who spoke on
the accomplishments of the past 40
years.

"I never in my wildest dreams
thought if I lived another 30 years
that there would be the changes we
have seen in America," Nerman
said. "Now we have to fight for
changes in the rest of the world."

Founder of Stanford Pride Jim
Haas '63 and founder of the Les
bian Equality Foundation Kathy

Levinson '77, among others, were
also honored for their contributions
to Stanford Pride and the LGBT
community. Levinson, founder of
the annual event, said she started it
to allow Stanford alumni who
weren't necessarily public with their
sexual identities while at the Farm
to return and connect.
Stanford Pride is an alumni
group with 2,000 members. It con
nects Stanford students, faculty and
alumni through newsletters and
events, such as panel discussions on
LGBT issues.

"The vast majority of our alums
connect through common life expe
riences," said Alumni Association
President Howard Wolf 'BO, who
added that the Alumni Association
firmly supports the group.
The group itself has three mis
sions: engage the community, be a
model club and help Stanford be a
model institution for other univer
sities. To accomplish these, Stanford
Pride is starting a mentoring pro
gram to connect graduate and un-

dergraduate students to alumni.
The organization also provides the
opportunity for students to intern
with an LGBT-related organiza
tion through their Huffington Pride
Fellowship.

Stanford Pride is also undertak
ing a proposition for a Center for
the Study of Sexual Orientation
and Gender Identity. The center
would cross disciplines to provide a
unified approach to LGBT re
search.

"Stanford is unique and excep
tional when it comes to interdiscipli
nary research, teaching and learn
ing. It is the Stanford culture," said
Stanford Pride board president Jim
Farah 'B6. "It's our feeling that there
is an opportunity for Stanford to
bring its unique approach to inter
disciplinary work to our community
and our lives and our issues."

Although the center is still early
in the planning stages, the hope is
that it would cross over all seven of
Stanford's schools and work to re
duce the risk of teen suicide. Ac

cording to Farah, the idea itself is
unusual in that alumni associations
don't typically propose academic
programs. Faculty would have to
decide ultimately whether to make
the program a reality.
"When you define part of your
mission to change the world, which
is Stanford's mission, and then you
take an alumni club like Stanford
Pride that defines its mission as
helping Stanford be a model insti
tution, this [the Center] makes per
fect sense," Farah said.
At the event itself, Rice spoke
about the U.N.'s work to promote
LGBT rights.
Under Rice's leadership, the
United States is now a member of
the U.N. LGBT core group. On Jun.
17, the U.N. Human Rights Council,
with the United States in the lead,
adopted a resolution advancing the
fundamental human rights of
LGBT persons. A U.N. report has
been commissioned to investigate
the challenges that LGBT people
face, she said.

"At the U.N., countries are final
ly beginning to codify and enshrine
the promise of equality for LGBT
persons, and as they do so the world
will become a safer, more respect
ful and a more humane place for
everybody," Rice said.
She spoke of the many steps to
ward LGBT rights by the United
Nations and President Barack
Obama, including the repeal of
Don't Ask Don't Tell and the rever
sal of the Bush administration's de
cision not to sign the U.N. General
Assembly statement on sexual ori
entation and gender identity.
"Quite frankly we couldn't fig
ure out why it was that the United
States had not been an original sig
natory," Rice said.
"She is our representative to the
world," said Gautam Raghavan 'O4,
current White House liaison to the
LGBT community and organizer
of the event.

face, she said.

"At the U.N., countries are final
ly beginning to codify and enshrine
the promise of equality for LGBT
persons, and as they do so the world
will become a safer, more respect
ful and a more humane place for
everybody," Rice said.
She spoke of the many steps to
ward LGBT rights by the United
Nations and President Barack
Obama, including the repeal of
Don't Ask Don't Tell and the rever
sal of the Bush administration's de
cision not to sign the U.N. General
Assembly statement on sexual ori
entation and gender identity.
"Quite frankly we couldn't fig
ure out why it was that the United
States had not been an original sig
natory," Rice said.
"She is our representative to the
world," said Gautam Raghavan 'O4,
current White House liaison to the
LGBT community and organizer
of the event.
