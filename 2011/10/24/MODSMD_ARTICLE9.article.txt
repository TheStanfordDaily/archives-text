## NOTES FROM ABROAD Language lessons in Madrid 
### â€” Sonya Chaudhry 
When in Madrid, do
as the madrilehos
do. After about a
month in Spain, I'm
starting to see why so
many Stanford students are in love with
this program.

One of the reasons is that we are re
ally lucky to be able to live with host
families and get three home-cooked
meals a day. So far, studying abroad in
Madrid has been a very hands-on way
to learn about Spanish culture.
My roommate and I live with a very
loving single mom who spoils us in
every way imaginable. She offers loads
of advice on where to party, how to
dress, what to eat you name it. My
favorite advice so far: eating lettuce
and salad can make us gain weight, but
a little bit of chocolate everyday is to
tally acceptable. After all, it has kept
her figure slim and her friends jealous
over the years.
As informative as her witticisms
are, it's also been exciting to share our
own cultures with our host mom. My
roommate is part Mexican and I'm
a native Californian, have a Mexican

boyfriend
and, consequently,
have lots of happy memo
ries associated with Mexican culture.

However, the Spanish spoken in
Spain is very different from the Span
ish spoken in Mexico. Thus, we are
constantly being introduced to new
slang or are reminded to pronounce
the Spanish lisp and say opthion in
stead of option.
Our greatest surprise thus far has
been the word coger. Everyone in
Spain, including our host mom, has
been telling us to coger un taxi, el
libro, etc. We were a little bewildered
and uncomfortable. For the non-
Spanish speakers out there, to Castel
lano speakers, the word coger is short
for recoger , which means to pick up or
get. In Mexican slang, however, coger
essentially means to have sex with,
but in cruder terms. Needless to say,
we got a good laugh out of explaining
our confusion to our host mother and
learning a little bit more about Span
ish culture.
