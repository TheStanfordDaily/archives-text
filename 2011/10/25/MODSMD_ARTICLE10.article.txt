## ROLLOUT! 
### CARL ROMANOS 
A crash, a bang and a giggle
woke Lauren Miller 'l5 at 6:15
a.m. The dawn light seeped
into the dorm room through
the blinds as the cacophony in
the hallway grew. She heard a flurry of
hushed chatter before all went silent. Sud
denly, the door roared with pounds and
cheers of Stanford students.

"Sweatshirt, shoes, keys!" voices out
side thundered.

Dazed and confused, Miller creaked
the door open. A troop of neon- and span
dex-adorned people crowded her door
way.

"It was so early that I couldn't even
comprehend what they could possibly be
there for," Miller said. They introduced
themselves as the Frosh Council. Miller
was its newest addition.

Before she could comprehend what
had happened, the troop grabbed her and
darted to the next dorm. Soon enough,
Miller was standing at the door of the next
victim, banging and clamoring just as oth
ers had at her door.

After the Frosh Council completed
their dorm-to-dorm frolic, its final task
was a sprint to the Quad.
There's something about bonding in
the middle of that grand courtyard that
you can't get from inside a classroom,
Miller said. "It means so much more than
a congratulatory email."
After getting to know her new friends
in some icebreaker games. Miller ate
breakfast with the rest of the Frosh Coun
cil. She appreciated the setting, the people
and the early morning bonding. After fin
ishing her breakfast at 8 a.m.. Miller made
her trip back to her dorm to get ready for
an early-morning exam. The communal
craziness came to an end.

Although every group does it a little
differently, the basic concept of rollout is
the same: an initiation in which someone
is involuntarily taken from his room and
compelled to hang out with a new group.
Through this initiation process, these roll

outs help build a strong extracurricular
foundation.

As Miller conducted her own rollouts,
she came to appreciate this early-morning
awakening.
She was now part of a community of
people, a group committed enough to plan
and perpetrate this early-morning adven
ture, As she became familiar with her fel
low council members, she said she could
n't help but feel a strong sense of cama
raderie.

"Last year's Frosh Council did the roll
outs and they got me excited to be a part
of such a committed and enthusiastic
group of people," Miller said. The upper
classmen raved about their experience in
the group, recounting the friends and
memories they made, all while climb
ing up lounge windows and crawling
through laundry rooms.

Rollouts also serve to secure alle
giances. Competing groups that at
tract the same talented candidates try
to roll out individuals before other, sim
ilar groups.
"Gaieties rollouts happened on a Fri
day while a cappella groups did rollouts
the day after, on Saturday," said Annika
Grangaard 'l2, vocal director at Gai
eties. "This definitely has some impact
on where people end up."

This tradition has ensued for decades.
While back for alumni weekend, Bran
ner alumni from the late 'Bo's discussed
how rollouts have changed.
In their time, rollouts were rare and re
served for special inaugurations, the alum
ni agreed.They were conducted, for exam
ple, when new members pledged to frater
nities and sororities, or when new RAs
found out about their positions. On Valen
tine's Day, suited males in the dorm would
roll out pajama-clad females. They walked
them to a dining hall, which they had dec
orated beforehand, and enjoyed a roman
tic breakfast.

Apart from the excitement of it all, the
origin of rollout remains a mystery. Ask
ing various longstanding campus figures
will lead to speculation, sympathy and,

sometimes, outright evasion. Maybe their
origin is a confidential secret known only
to the founders of each group. Maybe no
one truly knows how or why rollouts
began. In any case, the rollout is a Stanford
tradition, a cultural oddity and an expedi
ent bonding opportunity that keeps the
Cardinal spirit alive.
