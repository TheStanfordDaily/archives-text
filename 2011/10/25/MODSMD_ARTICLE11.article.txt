## Marauder's Map? There's an app for that 
### LANAHO 
All that could be seen was a sea of red at the
Orange Bowl last winter.The cheers of at
tendees drowned out individual voices,
and the roar of crowd was all that could be
heard. Geoff Woo 'll lost his friend
Jonathan Zhang 'll in the mass of people, and it was
there that they wished for a device that would let
them easily find each other essentially, a virtual
Marauder's Map. Inspired, Woo, Zhang and their
friend Jonathan Chang 'll created Glassmap, a loca-

tion-tracking iPhone ap
plication.

The trio had never
done any iPhone coding
before but were deter
mined to produce a work
ing product. The first
week of spring quarter
last year, they blocked out
time for coding and spent
nights at La Maison Fran
caise to work on what
would become Glassmap.
In three weeks, they
created a very rough, bat
tery-exhausting version
of the application. Track
ing applications require
real-time updates, which
drain the cell phone's bat
tery, they said. This turned
out to be their greatest
hurdle in developing the
application.
Their original app
could "only do something
naive like [send out a sig
nal] once every few min
utes, once every five min
utes or once every two
minutes," Woo said.
So they dove back into
their work. They wanted

to create a novel relay framework that surpassed the
efficiency of their competitors. To do that, they pro
grammed the application to intelligently query the lo
cation of the user so that the time between signals was
based on contextual clues. The modification, which
they finished by June, allowed the application to run
for hours without wasting power.
But they weren't done yet. The founders wanted to
perfect their application before launching it, so they
rented a house in Palo Alto this past summer off of
University Avenue. The three co-founders adhered to

a self-imposed schedule, working up to 16 hours a day
and often eating meals at their desks.
"It was pretty much eat, sleep, gym, code," said
Chang.
"I don't want to make it sound too much like 'The
Social Network,' but it was kind of like that," Woo
said.
Though their summer living arrangement begs a
"Social Network" comparison, their partnership does
not. They describe their relationship as without hier
archy or titles. For example, summer intern Xavier
Falco 'l2 was allowed the same amount of input as
everyone else. There were arguments, but in the end,

they defaulted back to
their philosophy that "the
best idea wins," all three
co-founders said.
Glassmap launched in
early October to Stanford
students only. Ryan Brown
'l2 was brought on board
to head campus outreach
efforts and publicity, like
the Glassmap Dorm
Storm, which attracted al
most 1,000 Glassmap
users.
Though the co-founders
have settled into niches,
they have retained their
original business model:
the best idea wins. The
three remain close friends
and live in the same apart
ment complex off campus.
They continue to spend
upwards of 70 hours per
week working on
Glassmap, Woo said.

Now, Chang mainly han
dles servers, Zhang works
on the iPhone application
and Woo focuses on the in
tegration with Facebook
and the Android applica
tion.

With a simple idea, intense dedication and a lot of
coding, the co-founders created an application that
they believe has the potential to change communica
tion.
When asked how they keep motivated to work on
their application, Zhang invoked the philosophy of
the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, as articulated in
his 2005 commencement speech: "Stay hungry. Stay
foolish."
