## THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION The 						measure of time 
### Nina Chung 
Whether or not we like the
numbers, time is exact. It
coordinates global mar
kets, unravels histories and guides
social schedules. It predicts what
people halfway around the globe
are doing at any given moment and
might be one of the smallest binders
of the most people at once. Time
keeps us on track with the world, so
most of us get on track early on.
There is, however, yet another
way we read time that is somehow
both bigger and entirely personal.
This kind of time is less quantifi
able, more fleeting and highly sub
jective. We can feel it before we ever
hear an audible alarm or chime. Ac
tually, it has nothing to do with
hours or minutes, but we feel it mov
ing inexorably between us and the
people around us. Like a form of
physical distance, it can tell us pre
cisely where we are. Perhaps more
than change, the most powerful
thing time can do is provide at least
a moment of complete clarification.

A friend of mine emailed me in
response to one of my columns last
week, emergency-style: we had to
talk now! (If you know me, you
know that I love when this hap
pens.) He was recovering from a
bad breakup, which had unexpect
edly re-launched his religious faith
and led to major re-acquainting
with previously abandoned rela
tions. To his own surprise, over the
span of the week after my column,
he found himself tying up numerous
loose ends that for years had been
drifting about via bad memories
and awkward encounters. Yet just
recently he had spent hours chat
ting with long-past friends and even
an ex-girlfriend with whom he had
once shared a very rocky record.
What was happening? Was it simply
that time heals? Was it that he and
the other parties had changed and
could now get along? No it was
that, after years of distance from
past events, he saw himself with bet
ter eyes. He could return to people
he had hurt and been hurt by be
cause, suddenly, time was letting
him see his past self with better per
spective.

Our relationships with others
depend first on how we relate with
ourselves, but over time that latter
part changes. Usually, it's only ex
post facto that we get the privilege
of revisiting our past selves and all
associated behavior. In the heat of
the moment, we're locked inside a
melange of bias and furiously
buzzing emotions. If we're lucky,
though, internal chatter subsides,
and then we get the opportunity
though we don't always take it to
see ourselves from the outside.

With our company, too, time's
penchant for clarity comes in ex
tremely handy. It spotlights how we
feel about someone in the context
of how little or how much time has
passed. Recall how ecstatic you felt
when he/she finally called you (and
you hadn't realized how long you'd
been waiting), how the hours you
spent with someone seemed to fly
by, how a short time away from
someone seemed like forever.
Emotions like these only make
sense in the context of time.

When you've known someone
for fewer than two years but it feels
timeless, what does that say? When
two people can reunite after
months of separation and take it ef
fortlessly in stride, what does that
say? Our reactions to the passing of
time could fill pages on how deeply
and/or genuinely we regard some
one. Maybe it's more automatic for
self-reflective people to register
those mental notes, and maybe
that's why I'm putting it out here for
the masses. After 21 years of meet
ing, greeting, mingling with and
leaving people, it feels unimagin
ably wonderful to consciously rec
ognize which relationships I can't
imagine ever fading; for now, at
least, I can thank them for being so
wonderful, too. (And I totally do,
even though I guess that's kind of
weird or something.)
Sometimes only time can tell
what things tarnish and what stays
real. I believe that truth like that is
immeasurably valuable.

Have an epiphany, or completely dis
agree? Either way, Nina would love
to hear it. Take a moment to tell her, at
