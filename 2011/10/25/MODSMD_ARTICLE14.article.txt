# I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE
## Make your own fun 
### Camira Powell 
What happens when every
thing you do doesn't
work?

At school we're taught all those
cliches that tell us to keep trying,
never give up and hop back on the
horse even if we fall off every time
we get on. However, what they
don't prepare us for is when all the
above doesn't hold true.

In moments like these, I think
about way, way, way back in the day,
when my Play Station wasn't work
ing, the daily "Arthur" episode was
just a rerun and I couldn't find my
Game Boy. I thought my world was
ending. Nothing I did was working,
so I would go to my mom whining
about being bored and wanting
something to do. In response, she
would go on a rant about how back
when she was young, her parents
would just send her and her siblings
outside to play, and then lock the
door so they couldn't get back in. Of
course, I knew my mom would
never do that to me (she barely let
me cross the street on my own until
I was at double digits, petrified that
I would end up getting kidnapped in
the middle of the crosswalk.) How
ever, that wouldn't stop her from
waxing nostalgic about a time be
fore play dates, before activities had
to be educational and before par
ents had to be more creative than
their kids to keep them entertained.
Nonetheless, once I looked be
yond the parental craziness, I could
see that there was actually sane ad
vice in there. In life, you have to
learn how to make your own fun.
And life has reminded me time and
time again that it is often very nee

essary to do so.
Work, work, work, work, yeah
you know I got that work.
Wale's "Bait" became my unin
tentional anthem this past weekend
as I attempted to live up to my own
and other people's expectations of
what a good time really is. Never in
my life have I spent so much time
trying to find something to do on a
Saturday night, especially not when
I'm attending the supposed capital
of school social life. But I sucked it
up, and to avoid all that ridiculous
ness, my party-pal and I spent copi
ous amounts of time doing research
and pre-party planning to ensure
that we found the function. And we
did.
We found the magic words "free
before 11," and we were on it. This
time we got ready early, checking
"yes" to everything on our going
out list. Even though we had done
everything right and had backup
contingency plans, things still went
wrong. Our ride never came no mat
ter how many times we called, nei
ther of us could afford to drop $3O
just to enter a sweaty, overpriced
club and we had no desire to walk
past the locals who really liked our
outfits (I never thought being called
Tina Turner could make me cringe).
So we were left with the decision to
wallow in our disappointment or to
keep it moving.
And this is when I had a mini
epiphany as my mother's words
came back to me about making my
own fun making my own way.
Everyone knows that sometimes
things just don't go as planned
that's stating the obvious but

that doesn't keep you from asking
yourself, why? No, not why, but
when? When do I stop trying to go
down this path that (maybe) I'm not
meant to go down?
So when you're done lamenting
your life, it's a good time to see that
the same route that's killing you
might be better left for someone
else. This doesn't mean you're tak
ing the easy way out, it just means
that you're smart enough to see that
the road marked "dead end" got
that sign for a reason.
As a kid, I didn't completely un
derstand the beauty of what my
mom was trying to tell me because I
thought it applied only to my ability
to find something to do during play
time. But it goes further than that
what she was really telling me was
that I'm the only person stopping
myself from having a good time. I'm
the only person who keeps looking
in the couch cushions for the Game
Boy that definitely got broken at
school the week before. I'm the only
one capable of making whatever ex
perience I'm having a good one.
That Saturday night, I made the
decision to actually listen to my
mom's advice. We shook off the let
down and moved on to our Plan F,
which meant being open to the pos
sibilities of finding fun in the most
unexpected places.

keep it moving.
And this is when I had a mini
epiphany as my mother's words
came back to me about making my
own fun making my own way.
Everyone knows that sometimes
things just don't go as planned
that's stating the obvious but

that doesn't keep you from asking
yourself, why? No, not why, but
when? When do I stop trying to go
down this path that (maybe) I'm not
meant to go down?
So when you're done lamenting
your life, it's a good time to see that
the same route that's killing you
might be better left for someone
else. This doesn't mean you're tak
ing the easy way out, it just means
that you're smart enough to see that
the road marked "dead end" got
that sign for a reason.
As a kid, I didn't completely un
derstand the beauty of what my
mom was trying to tell me because I
thought it applied only to my ability
to find something to do during play
time. But it goes further than that
what she was really telling me was
that I'm the only person stopping
myself from having a good time. I'm
the only person who keeps looking
in the couch cushions for the Game
Boy that definitely got broken at
school the week before. I'm the only
one capable of making whatever ex
perience I'm having a good one.
That Saturday night, I made the
decision to actually listen to my
mom's advice. We shook off the let
down and moved on to our Plan F,
which meant being open to the pos
sibilities of finding fun in the most
unexpected places.
