## FIELD HOCKEY Success on Senior Night Card honors four, wins by five 
### JORDAN GUNNING 
The Stanford field hockey team's sen
iors goalkeeper Ale Moss and attackers
Stephanie Byrne, Katie Mitchell and
Devon Holman completed a perfect
NorPac season after Friday night's 5-0 vic
tory against UC-Davis. The Senior Night
shutout against the Aggies (3-10,1-3 Nor-
Pac) helped advance the No. 4 Cardinal's
record to 6-0 in NorPac conference play
and 13-2 overall.

The Cardinal came out swinging with
the first shot on goal in the fifth minute
made by junior defender Kelsey Lloyd.
The Aggies responded with two shots on
goal by Casey Wollbrinck and Cloey
LemMon in the ninth minute following a
penalty corner. Stanford stopped both
shots, the first by Moss and the second on
a defensive save by Lloyd. These would
be the Aggies' only shots on goal all
game.

In the 11th minute, junior defender
Becky Dru came up with the first goal of
the game and her 13th of the season off a
rather powerful shot following a penalty
corner.

The next 22 minutes of play were char
acterized by excellent handling by the
Cardinal, as the team drew seven fouls
and attempted three shots on goal. In the
same time period the Aggies only man
aged to draw three fouls, leading to one
penalty corner and no shots on goal. This
would set the tone for the rest of the

In the 34th minute a Cardinal
penalty corner led to another
goal, this time by sophomore at
tacker Courtney Haldeman, as
sisted by fellow sophomore at
tacker Hope Burke.

The first half, which was a true
show of the Cardinal's dominance
both offensively and defensively,
ended with just a 2-0 Stanford
lead.

Following the solid rhythm es
tablished in the first half, Stanford
took less than seven minutes to
notch another tally, as freshman
attacker Alex McCawley came up
with the third goal of the night
from a shot that surprised Aggies'
keeper Conley Craven.
In the 57th minute McCawley
was able to assist fellow freshman
midfielder Kasey Quon with her
first goal of the season and the
fourth Cardinal goal of the night
on a nice low-post shot that snuck
past Craven.
Shortly after, an interesting
scene occurred when it appeared
that Davis had scored a goal, but
the shot was called back as it had
not been from inside the circle.
The frustration of both the Aggie
fans and coaches was visible after
the goal was disallowed.
The final goal of the night came
from the Cardinal's Lloyd, assist
ed by freshman midfielder Shan
non Herold, in the 68th minute off
a great penalty corner. After the
inbound by Burke, a fantastic mis
direction by the Cardinal left the
crowd and the Aggies stunned.
By the end of the game the Car
dinal had racked up not only five
goals but an impressive 21 shots
on goal, four of which came from
Dru, compared to the Aggies' two
shots. Stanford also led in penalty
corners 5-3 and had the only de
fensive save of the night.
Up next for the Cardinal is a
weekend trip to the state of Michi
gan, where it will face No. 8 Michi
gan (12-4, 4-1 Big Ten) on Friday
at 12 p.m. PST and Michigan State
(7-10, 1-4) on Sunday at 4 p.m.
PST.

The following week the Cardi
nal will compete in the NorPac
Tournament, hosted at Stanford's
Varsity Turf.
