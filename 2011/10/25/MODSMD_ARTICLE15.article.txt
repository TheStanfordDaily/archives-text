### JORDAN GUNNING 
The Stanford field hockey team's sen
iors goalkeeper Ale Moss and attackers
Stephanie Byrne, Katie Mitchell and
Devon Holman completed a perfect
NorPac season after Friday night's 5-0 vic
tory against UC-Davis. The Senior Night
shutout against the Aggies (3-10,1-3 Nor-
Pac) helped advance the No. 4 Cardinal's
record to 6-0 in NorPac conference play
and 13-2 overall.

The Cardinal came out swinging with
the first shot on goal in the fifth minute
made by junior defender Kelsey Lloyd.
The Aggies responded with two shots on
goal by Casey Wollbrinck and Cloey
LemMon in the ninth minute following a
penalty corner. Stanford stopped both
shots, the first by Moss and the second on
a defensive save by Lloyd. These would
be the Aggies' only shots on goal all
game.

In the 11th minute, junior defender
Becky Dru came up with the first goal of
the game and her 13th of the season off a
rather powerful shot following a penalty
corner.

The next 22 minutes of play were char
acterized by excellent handling by the
Cardinal, as the team drew seven fouls
and attempted three shots on goal. In the
same time period the Aggies only man
aged to draw three fouls, leading to one
penalty corner and no shots on goal. This
would set the tone for the rest of the
