# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Offense explodes in five wins 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a come-from-behind victory, a vir
tuoso defensive performance, a ton of goals
and then some more goals, the Stanford
men's water polo team provided just about
everything you could ask for this weekend,
going a perfect 5-0 as it knocked off confer
ence rival Pacific on Friday and swept
through the Santa Clara Invitational on
Saturday and Sunday.
Stanford (14-3, 3-1 MPSF) scored 76
goals over the three days, with every active
non-goalie player getting on the score sheet
at least once. Freshman utility Alex Bowen
led the way with 14 goals (including four hat
tricks), followed by senior driver Jacob
Smith with 11, redshirt sophomore two
meter Forrest Watkins with 10 and senior
utility Peter Sefton with 10 as well.

On Friday night Stanford beat No. 7 Pa
cific 8-6, overcoming yet another halftime
deficit. The other four games were consider
ably less competitive, as Stanford won each
game by double digits and never trailed in
any of the games. On Saturday the Cardinal
defeated No. 17 Bucknell 15-1 and then Har
vard 19-3. On Sunday the team won 18-5
over Brown and 16-3 over No. 18 Air Force.

The weekend started off on a high note, as
early goals by Smith and Watkins gave Stan
ford a 2-0 lead against Pacific. Things went
sour quickly for the Cardinal, though, as the
Tigers finished off the half on a 5-1 run to go
into halftime leading 5-3. An early second
quarter goal by Smith was the only one that
Stanford would score during that run.
Stanford has been making a habit of dig
ging itself a hole in the first half. This is the
third straight conference game in which the
team has been trailing by two goals at half
time. But this is also the third straight game
in which a strong third quarter has gotten
the Cardinal right back into the game.

Stanford took the third frame 4-1 behind
a pair of power play goals from Bowen and
an absolutely dominant defensive perform
ance. Pacific's goal in the third quarter was
its only one of the half, as Stanford shut the
