## CARD DOMINATES NEW PAC-12 TEAMS UTAH, COLORADO 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Now having scored three or more goals in
five consecutive games, the Stanford women's
soccer team bludgeoned Utah and Colorado by
the combined score of 8-1 this weekend behind
a pair of two-goal performances by senior for
ward Lindsay Taylor.
Improving to 16-0-1 with a perfect 8-0 Pac-12
record on the season, the No. 1 Cardinal can
clinch its third straight conference title with a
win at second-place Oregon State on Friday
night.

Taylor extended her Pac-12 scoring lead
with 14 goals on the year, just two short of her
career high of 16 set during her freshman sea
son. Each of her tallies on the weekend was as
sisted.
"The services that came in were really

great," Taylor said. "I'm really fortu
nate to have great teammates who
were able to get me the ball, so I was
open around a lot of shots."
Taylor got things off to a very
quick start against Utah (8-7-1, 4-3
Pac-12), a squad performing in the
top half of the conference after a
mediocre 2010 season, with a fourth
minute goal that came off feeds from
senior midfielder Teresa Noyola and
freshman forward Chioma Übogagu
a duo that leads Stanford in assists
with 10 and nine, respectively. Just 12
minutes later, Übogagu added a tally
of her own when junior midfielder
Mariah Nogueira found her behind
the defense for a left-footer to the far
post.

Meanwhile, sophomore goal
keeper Emily Oliver was sharp as al
ways in net, making two saves and
facing only three shots from the Utes
in the first half. Four minutes after
Taylor's second goal of the match, a
62nd-minute header off a feed from
Übogagu, Oliver was pulled in favor
of junior Lindsay Dickerson, who
made just her fourth appearance of
the year. Only 11 seconds later, the
Cardinal put things away for its back
up with a close-range finish by junior
midfielder Nina Watkins, her first of
the season as a non-starter and just
the second of her career.
Substitutes would again play a big
role for Stanford on Sunday against
Colorado; with temperatures reach
ing the low 80s, head coach Paul Rat
cliffe didn't force any of his players to
stay in for the whole 90 minutes
by contrast, the Buffaloes left four
starters in all game.
"What we've realized through
out this season is that we have depth
in this team,"Taylor said. "Even subs
are able to come onto the field and
make a difference, and they've done
that in every game, whether they're
coming in at forward, midfield or de
fense."
The Cardinal's starters had their
time to shine as well. When Col
orado goalie Kayla Millar seemed to
mishit a long pass, junior midfielder
Marjani Hing-Glover grabbed the
ball near midfield, deked around a
defender and curled one in to the far
post 10 minutes into the game. Just
three minutes later, an Übogagu
feed found Taylor who had been
barely stopped twice already, once
by the crossbar and once by Millar
on a point-blank attempt alone
on goal, and this time, Taylor buried
the shot for her third goal of the
weekend.
Stanford wouldn't get on the
board again in the first frame despite
dominating the shot count 16-2. But
only 49 seconds after subbing in
midway through the second half,
redshirt sophomore defender Annie
Case launched a perfect cross
through the box to find a waiting
Taylor at the back post for the se
nior's 14th of the season.
With the game out of reach, Rat

cliffe was able to bring in Dickerson
yet again between the goal posts.
Overcoming a slight misstep that led
to a 74th-minute penalty shot goal by
the Buffs both of the last two
scores allowed by the Cardinal have
come on penalties against a backup
goalkeeper Stanford kept work
ing hard, netting its fourth goal on a
scrum in the box when sophomore

forward Sydney Payne sent home a
rebound off the crossbar.

But the Cardinal will not have
long to dwell on the rude awakening
it sent to the new Pac-12 schools this
weekend with the showdown against
No. 23 Oregon State looming. Play
will begin at 7 p.m. Friday in Corval
lis, Ore., in the most significant test
for Stanford in its final three regular
season games.

in the first half. Four minutes after
Taylor's second goal of the match, a
62nd-minute header off a feed from
Übogagu, Oliver was pulled in favor
of junior Lindsay Dickerson, who
made just her fourth appearance of
the year. Only 11 seconds later, the
Cardinal put things away for its back
up with a close-range finish by junior
midfielder Nina Watkins, her first of
the season as a non-starter and just
the second of her career.
Substitutes would again play a big
role for Stanford on Sunday against
Colorado; with temperatures reach
ing the low 80s, head coach Paul Rat
cliffe didn't force any of his players to
stay in for the whole 90 minutes
by contrast, the Buffaloes left four
starters in all game.
"What we've realized through
out this season is that we have depth
in this team,"Taylor said. "Even subs
are able to come onto the field and
make a difference, and they've done
that in every game, whether they're
coming in at forward, midfield or de
fense."
The Cardinal's starters had their
time to shine as well. When Col
orado goalie Kayla Millar seemed to
mishit a long pass, junior midfielder
Marjani Hing-Glover grabbed the
ball near midfield, deked around a
defender and curled one in to the far
post 10 minutes into the game. Just
three minutes later, an Übogagu
feed found Taylor who had been
barely stopped twice already, once
by the crossbar and once by Millar
on a point-blank attempt alone
on goal, and this time, Taylor buried
the shot for her third goal of the
weekend.
Stanford wouldn't get on the
board again in the first frame despite
dominating the shot count 16-2. But
only 49 seconds after subbing in
midway through the second half,
redshirt sophomore defender Annie
Case launched a perfect cross
through the box to find a waiting
Taylor at the back post for the se
nior's 14th of the season.
With the game out of reach, Rat

cliffe was able to bring in Dickerson
yet again between the goal posts.
Overcoming a slight misstep that led
to a 74th-minute penalty shot goal by
the Buffs both of the last two
scores allowed by the Cardinal have
come on penalties against a backup
goalkeeper Stanford kept work
ing hard, netting its fourth goal on a
scrum in the box when sophomore

forward Sydney Payne sent home a
rebound off the crossbar.

But the Cardinal will not have
long to dwell on the rude awakening
it sent to the new Pac-12 schools this
weekend with the showdown against
No. 23 Oregon State looming. Play
will begin at 7 p.m. Friday in Corval
lis, Ore., in the most significant test
for Stanford in its final three regular
season games.
