## Cardinal's road woes continue First road goal not enough 
### TORSTEIN HOSET 
With fond memories of last weekend's
outing against Oregon State in mind, the
Stanford men's soccer team traveled to
the Pacific Northwest in hopes of improv
ing on its meager 1-3-1 Pac-12 record and
eyeing a chance to move up in the confer
ence standings with a good showing in re
matches against Washington and Oregon
State. But the Huskies showed no signs of
cooling down as they continued their re
cent hot streak with a 2-0 win over the
Cardinal on Friday night. Corvallis
proved to be a rough trip for Stanford, as
the Card couldn't close the deal and lost
in overtime.

STANFORD 0
OREGON STATE 1
10/23, Corvallis, Ore.

Sunday's game at Oregon State (5-8-2,
3-3-1 Pac-12) saw the Cardinal sympto
matically struggling to capitalize on its
scoring chances on the road the team
has scored just one goal through the first
seven away games of the season.
The match itself was a tight affair
neither side could break through and the
shot totals were fairly even at 13-10 in
favor of the home side. Stanford put the
hosts' goalie Steve Spangler to the test on
seven occasions without bagging a goal,
but the Beavers also looked dangerous
on the counterattack.
The decisive moment came less than
two minutes into overtime, when Oregon
State sophomore Josh von Allworden tal
lied what Stanford head coach Bret
Simon described as a "fluky goal."

But as much as the Cardinal was near
ly helpless to stop the golden goal from
von Allworden which came after a
long free kick was tipped away by goalie
Jason Dodson and fell straight to von All
worden's feet in front of goal Stanford
had its chances to slow the Huskies two
days earlier in Seattle.
The reunion with the Huskies (10-3-2,
5-2-0), who shut out the Cardinal last
weekend at Cagan Stadium, didn't start
out well.

Stanford came into the game with a
desire to rid itself of the 500-pound goril
la that had been riding the team's back
for the last couple of weeks the Cardi
nal hadn't scored on the road since a 3-2
defeat at the hands of California last No
vember, a stretch of six straight road
matches where Stanford was outscored
9-0.

And while the opening minutes saw
Washington holding much of the posses
sion, the Huskies were also unable to
threaten the Stanford back four. But after
11 minutes, a momentary lapse in concen
tration in the Cardinal defense allowed
Washington's Jamie Finch to swing in an
excellent cross that found an unmarked
Jake Hustedt in the box. Hustedt showed
good composure to control the ball be
fore poking it past Dodson for an early
lead.

Simon had laid specific plans to con
tain Finch and Hustedt, but had to con
cede that they got the better of his own
players on the first goal.
"Finch is one of the most dangerous
crossers in the conference. He played an
amazing ball," Simon said. "And we all
know about Hustedt's qualities from his
time at Cal Poly."
But the Cardinal responded promptly.
In the 20th minute, a Stanford free kick
