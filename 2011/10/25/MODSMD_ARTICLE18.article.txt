## Cardinal's road woes continue First road goal not enough 
### TORSTEIN HOSET 
With fond memories of last weekend's
outing against Oregon State in mind, the
Stanford men's soccer team traveled to
the Pacific Northwest in hopes of improv
ing on its meager 1-3-1 Pac-12 record and
eyeing a chance to move up in the confer
ence standings with a good showing in re
matches against Washington and Oregon
State. But the Huskies showed no signs of
cooling down as they continued their re
cent hot streak with a 2-0 win over the
Cardinal on Friday night. Corvallis
proved to be a rough trip for Stanford, as
the Card couldn't close the deal and lost
in overtime.

MEN'S SOCCER
STANFORD 0
OREGON STATE 1
10/23, Corvallis, Ore.

Sunday's game at Oregon State (5-8-2,
3-3-1 Pac-12) saw the Cardinal sympto
matically struggling to capitalize on its
scoring chances on the road the team
has scored just one goal through the first
seven away games of the season.
The match itself was a tight affair
neither side could break through and the
shot totals were fairly even at 13-10 in
favor of the home side. Stanford put the
hosts' goalie Steve Spangler to the test on
seven occasions without bagging a goal,
but the Beavers also looked dangerous
on the counterattack.
The decisive moment came less than
two minutes into overtime, when Oregon
State sophomore Josh von Allworden tal
lied what Stanford head coach Bret
Simon described as a "fluky goal."

But as much as the Cardinal was near
ly helpless to stop the golden goal from
von Allworden which came after a
long free kick was tipped away by goalie
Jason Dodson and fell straight to von All
worden's feet in front of goal Stanford
had its chances to slow the Huskies two
days earlier in Seattle.
The reunion with the Huskies (10-3-2,
5-2-0), who shut out the Cardinal last
weekend at Cagan Stadium, didn't start
out well.

Stanford came into the game with a
desire to rid itself of the 500-pound goril
la that had been riding the team's back
for the last couple of weeks the Cardi
nal hadn't scored on the road since a 3-2
defeat at the hands of California last No
vember, a stretch of six straight road
matches where Stanford was outscored
9-0.

And while the opening minutes saw
Washington holding much of the posses
sion, the Huskies were also unable to
threaten the Stanford back four. But after
11 minutes, a momentary lapse in concen
tration in the Cardinal defense allowed
Washington's Jamie Finch to swing in an
excellent cross that found an unmarked
Jake Hustedt in the box. Hustedt showed
good composure to control the ball be
fore poking it past Dodson for an early
lead.

Simon had laid specific plans to con
tain Finch and Hustedt, but had to con
cede that they got the better of his own
players on the first goal.
"Finch is one of the most dangerous
crossers in the conference. He played an
amazing ball," Simon said. "And we all
know about Hustedt's qualities from his
time at Cal Poly."
But the Cardinal responded promptly.
In the 20th minute, a Stanford free kick
was fired into the box, and the ball
bounced around before it found
the feet of redshirt senior Taylor
Amman. He kept his cool and slot
ted home his first goal of the season
for the equalizer.

The Huskies mounted an offen
sive charge after Stanford's goal,
but the pressure didn't amount to
anything until five minutes before
halftime, when Stanford was pun
ished by a ruthless counterattack.
Great combination play by substi
tute Abdul Aman and Brent
Richards set up Aman, who made
no mistakes on a quality finish that
gave Washington the lead.
After the break, the Cardinal
came out of the starting blocks
eager to prove its worth. Stanford
quickly took control of the game
and looked likely to score through
out the second half, outshooting its

opponents 5-2. The goal never
came though, and the Cardinal was
handed its second loss in as many
weeks by the Huskies, who have
now won their last five matches.
Despite this, Simon seemed happy
with his team's display.
"I thought we got stronger as
the game progressed," he said. "We
were creating good scoring oppor
tunities, but their goalkeeper made
a couple of key saves.
"We knew that it was highly un
likely to make the playoffs, so the
goal for this weekend and the up
coming games was to keep improv
ing and playing better soccer. I
think we did that," he said.
Stanford now has a bye week
before hosting Southern California
schools San Diego State and
UCLA this weekend. The Cardinal
will look to exact some revenge
and possibly play the spoiler, as
both visiting teams have serious
postseason aspirations.

Junior midfielder Dersu Abolfathi and the Stanford men's soccer team have
struggled all season on the road. The Cardinal finally scored its first goal
away from home, but Stanford still fell to both Washington and Oregon State.
