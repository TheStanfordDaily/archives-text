# Sports world is too enamored with injuries
## 
### Tom Taylor 
In the space of a week, the world of auto
racing has lost two stars: on Oct. 16 Indy-
Car driver Dan Wheldon lost his life in a
15-car accident at the Las Vegas Motor
Speedway, and seven days later MotoGP
rider Marco Simoncelli was killed in a crash at
the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. I
can't really go into much more detail than that,
simply because I haven't read the stories or
watched replays of the incidents. Not because I
haven't had the time, but because I'm not sure
that I want to.

Many of you probably weren't born or may
have been too young to remember when Ayrton
Senna died, but I unfortunately remember quite
clearly watching the 1994 San Marino Formula
1 Grand Prix live on TV. It is a weird feeling even
to think back to that weekend and the images
flickering across the screen when two F1 drivers

Senna and Roland Ratzenbergerâ€” lost
their lives. Literally watching the end of some
one's life isn't something a kid should have to
deal with. Even 17 years later, I don't think I'd
want to watch replays of that incident.
Many of the sports we watch can be incred
ibly violent. Crunching tackles are a core part
of both football and rugby, fighting is a
bizarrely accepted part of ice hockey and pret
ty much any auto-racing discipline is character
ized by the occasional big accident. Even rela
tively gentle sports like soccer aren't immune
however much people may criticize players
for feigning injury, they are not always faking.
Competitors in any sport are always ap
plauded for their commitment, even if that can
sometimes lead to serious injury for either
them or their opposition. Perhaps, though,
there is a difference here between auto sports

and the rest of them. In the same way many
people watch the Super Bowl for the advertise
ments, many are drawn to auto racing by the
big crashes. In fact, it doesn't really matter so
much if those incidents are during the actual
race or in practice; they will still make the high
light reel. Maybe it is that practices in other
sports don't get recorded or that the videos
aren't made public, but I'm not sure people
would care about them in the same way. And if
one of those incidents involved someone get
ting seriously injured or even dying, I think
most would find it very uncomfortable to
watch it.

On a personal level, I find it hard to watch
any serious sporting incidents. Not because I
have known anyone who has died in extreme
