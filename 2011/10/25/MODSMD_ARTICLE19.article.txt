# Sports world is too enamored with injuries
## 
### Tom Taylor 
In the space of a week, the world of auto
racing has lost two stars: on Oct. 16 Indy-
Car driver Dan Wheldon lost his life in a
15-car accident at the Las Vegas Motor
Speedway, and seven days later MotoGP
rider Marco Simoncelli was killed in a crash at
the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. I
can't really go into much more detail than that,
simply because I haven't read the stories or
watched replays of the incidents. Not because I
haven't had the time, but because I'm not sure
that I want to.

Many of you probably weren't born or may
have been too young to remember when Ayrton
Senna died, but I unfortunately remember quite
clearly watching the 1994 San Marino Formula
1 Grand Prix live on TV. It is a weird feeling even
to think back to that weekend and the images
flickering across the screen when two F1 drivers

Senna and Roland Ratzenbergerâ€” lost
their lives. Literally watching the end of some
one's life isn't something a kid should have to
deal with. Even 17 years later, I don't think I'd
want to watch replays of that incident.
Many of the sports we watch can be incred
ibly violent. Crunching tackles are a core part
of both football and rugby, fighting is a
bizarrely accepted part of ice hockey and pret
ty much any auto-racing discipline is character
ized by the occasional big accident. Even rela
tively gentle sports like soccer aren't immune
however much people may criticize players
for feigning injury, they are not always faking.
Competitors in any sport are always ap
plauded for their commitment, even if that can
sometimes lead to serious injury for either
them or their opposition. Perhaps, though,
there is a difference here between auto sports

and the rest of them. In the same way many
people watch the Super Bowl for the advertise
ments, many are drawn to auto racing by the
big crashes. In fact, it doesn't really matter so
much if those incidents are during the actual
race or in practice; they will still make the high
light reel. Maybe it is that practices in other
sports don't get recorded or that the videos
aren't made public, but I'm not sure people
would care about them in the same way. And if
one of those incidents involved someone get
ting seriously injured or even dying, I think
most would find it very uncomfortable to
watch it.

On a personal level, I find it hard to watch
any serious sporting incidents. Not because I
have known anyone who has died in extreme
circumstances, but because I know
what it feels like to deal with injury.
I won't bore you with the details,
but having had far too many opera
tions and spent far too much of my
life on crutches, I wince at seeing
anyone even so much as pull a mus
cle on TV.

Not that I'm a saint, though. I
can't preach too much because,
after all, I'm human. Everyone
looks occasionally, whether because
you want to know what everyone
else is looking at, because you suc
cumb to morbid fascination or be
cause you simply want a better un
derstanding of what is going on.
Watching the serious news with all
the grisly violence censored out
would give us a dangerously mis
leading view of the facts, but the
trick is in finding a balance between
gory and story.
I'm not sure, though, that we do
this very well. In Sunday's Rugby
World Cup Final, New Zealand fly
half Aaron Cruden hyper-extended
his knee in a tackle and needed to be
helped from the field as he clearly
could not even put weight on the in
jury. Most viewers probably didn't
quite realize exactly what had hap
pened live, so a first slow-motion re
play was probably justified. But the
second? The third? At some point
among the replays from various an
gles we stopped learning anything
new and began simply relishing the
awfulness of the injury.
The sensational always grabs the
headlines, and even more so in the
Twitter-inspired, rapid-fire rhythm
of modern life, where you don't get
15 minutes of fame you get 15
seconds. Only the most shocking
can break through.

Is there an answer to this? I'm
not sure. Perhaps, though, TV
broadcasters could resist the temp
tation to overplay the replays and
the slow-motion shots quite so
much and get back to the live action
and the interesting bits. Once we
know something was bad, and even
how bad it was, why dwell on it? I'd
rather learn about the whole of
Wheldon and Simoncelli's careers
and lives than how they ended.

Tom Taylor just wishes there were
slo-mo cameras around to capture
his many gruesome injuries. Get him
to relive those painfid memories at
torn. taylor@stanford. edu.
