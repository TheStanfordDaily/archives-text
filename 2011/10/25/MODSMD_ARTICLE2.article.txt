## CA Dream Act bill fails in GSC vote Senate unanimously passed legislation voicing support 
### EDWARD NGAI 
ASSU and GSC student government repre
sentatives remain divided over an undergradu
ate senate bill expressing support for the Cali
fornia Dream Act. The bill failed to pass the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) on Oct. 5
after coasting through the Undergraduate Sen
ate unanimously.

The bill, rejected by a majority of the GSC
over concerns about illegal immigrants' em
ployability, would have authorized ASSU Pres
ident Michael Cruz 'l2 to lobby for California
Governor Jerry Brown's passage of the Califor
nia Assembly Bill AB 131, otherwise known as
the Dream Act.

The act, signed into law by Brown on Oct. 8,
is part of a legislative package referred to as the
California Dream Act, which authorizes illegal
immigrant students who meet GPA require
ments, graduate from a California high school
and enter the U.S. before age 16 to apply for
state-funded financial aid.

"It's extremely important for undocumented
students because it allows them more open ac
cess to educational opportunities," said Jayashri
Srikantiah, professor of law and director of
Stanford's Immigrants' Rights Clinic. "It signals
that there's now statewide recognition that un
documented students should have equal access
to opportunities, and that the state itself has rec
ognized that need."

After a national version of the bill was reject
ed late last year in Washington, D.C., Califor
nia's passage of the controversial measure is a
vindication for proponents of access to higher
education for undocumented youth.
"It's going to be critical," Srikantiah said. "It
sends a signal that these students
are welcome, part of our communi
ties and ought to be attending Cali
fornia public universities as mem
bers of our state."

"It was a difficult vote," said
Manish Choudhary, a second-year
engineering graduate student and
public relations and communica
tions director for the GSC, where
the bill was defeated 2-4. "But when
you make a law, [illegal aliens]
should not get an advantage."
This advantage would be over
international students, who do not
have access to financial aid from
public funds.
"I can't really say much. I was
upset," said ASSU Senator and the
bill's co-author Brianna Pang 'l3.
"But they voted, and they have
every right to vote."
"At Stanford, I feel like [the Cal
ifornia Dream Act] is more of a
symbolic thing," she said. "With
most Stanford students, they get
private financial aid from Stanford
anyway. But the passage can also set
the tone for the overall national
conversation about the national
Dream Act."

The majority of the GSC, how
ever, cast aside symbolism to exam
ine the Senate bill from a practical
angle.

"People who are here illegally
will have access to state funds, and
people who are here legally will not
have access to the funds that
doesn't sound right," Choudhary
said. "And [students] will not be
able to find jobs because they do

not have the legal right to work."
"I felt like a lot of opinions on
undocumented immigrants were
uninformed," Pang said. "I feel like
a lot of GSC members didn't neces
sarily know that much about citi
zenship and the Dream Act itself."

Srikantiah echoed the Under
graduate Senate's vote.
"We have to take a step back
here and revisit the ... issue, which
is that the reality of our immigra
tion system is that there are tens of
millions of undocumented people

in this country, and many of those
are children who, as a practical mat
ter, are going to be spending their
lives in [the U.S.]," she said.

"We have to think about how we
treat members of our community
and [whether] we want to be en
couraging them to get higher edu
cation," she continued. "I think the
answer to that question has to be
yes."
