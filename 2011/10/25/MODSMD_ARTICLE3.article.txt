# City divided on Measure E
## Palo Alto residents to decide fate of Byxbee Park land in Nov. 8 vote 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
On Nov. 8, Palo Alto citizens are sched
uled to vote on Measure E, the Palo Alto
Green Energy and Compost Initiative. Mea
sure E would un-dedicate 10 of 127 acres in
Byxbee Park, currently home to the Palo
Alto Landfill, which will be closing in 2012.

As voters in Palo Alto have started to
send in their ballots, the controversial meas
ure has been receiving increased attention
from both sides of the debate. Most recently,

the Palo Alto Weekly endorsed the measure
while the Daily Post wrote in opposition to it.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford also en
dorsed the measure.

"I think policy-making is very often about
compromising and finding middle ground
about issues," said Palo Alto Mayor Sid Es
pinosa. "I'm a very strong supporter of com
posting. I think a regional approach does
make sense. There are other options that we
could consider. Before we even have that
conversation, I just have to say on the bot

torn line that I don't think we should un-ded
icate park land, period."
Espinosa responded to concerns that the
park itself does not have an elaborate plan
by emphasizing that it is not supposed to be
manicured land, but rather a natural pre
serve.

"You have to weigh the fact that once
parkland is gone in most communities it
doesn't come back," Espinosa continued.

Palo Alto residents will vote in Nov. 8 elections on Measure E, a controversial initiative to un-dedicate 10 acres of land in Byxbee Park. The
Palo Alto Weekly supports the measure while the Daily Post opposes it. Community environmentalists remain divided on the issue.
"Voting 'yes' on this measure isn't
guaranteeing that a compost facility
will be there. It's just guaranteeing
that it won't be parkland."
Meanwhile, proponents of Mea
sure E focus on the potential envi
ronmental benefits of an anaerobic
digestion operation and compost fa
cility on land that they believe will
be more useful as a waste manage
ment facility.

"It will never be natural because
the natural state of the site out there
was wetlands," said Peter Drek
meier, former mayor of Palo Alto.
"When you process [food and
sewage waste] together, you get
higher energy output than if you do
them separately."
Drekmeier clarified that biogas is
considered a biogenic greenhouse

gas rather than a fossil fuel because
it is already in the atmosphere and is
merely completing the natural car
bon cycle. He also noted that Palo
Alto should expect to see a lot of
precinct blocking and mailing to vot
ers in the next few weeks in favor of
Measure E.
"There's no technology. We're
just going to have the land set aside,"
said former city councilwoman
Emily Renzel. "The park has long
been planned and designed. The
park was supposed to be a natural
open space, so the architects de
signed it to have a somewhat natural
earth form."
Renzel said she believes that the
addition of a compost facility would
be met with practical difficulties in
removing a slice of the landfill for
construction. She, like Espinosa, be
lieves that in the same manner that
waste management needs to adjust
with the population, park space
needs to be appropriately protected
and increased.

"We view the installation of an
anaerobic digester to replace an old
incinerator, basically, as more bene
ficial than keeping those 10 acres out
of the 150 for parkland," said Will
Troppe 'l4, a member of Students
for a Sustainable Stanford.
According to the Palo Alto
Weekly, the Committee for Measure
E currently has $18,773 in its cam
paign chest, including $5OO and
$l,OOO contributed by downtown de
velopers Charles "Chop" Keenan
and Sam Webster, respectively. The
opponents of Measure E have re
portedly raised $11,231 as of Oct. 7,
including $lOO donated by Espinosa
and $4OO by Renzel.
"What's interesting is it's green
versus green," Espinosa said. "You
have environmentalists on both
sides. You have compost supporters
on both sides."
