# City divided on Measure E
## Palo Alto residents to decide fate of Byxbee Park land in Nov. 8 vote 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
On Nov. 8, Palo Alto citizens are sched
uled to vote on Measure E, the Palo Alto
Green Energy and Compost Initiative. Mea
sure E would un-dedicate 10 of 127 acres in
Byxbee Park, currently home to the Palo
Alto Landfill, which will be closing in 2012.

As voters in Palo Alto have started to
send in their ballots, the controversial meas
ure has been receiving increased attention
from both sides of the debate. Most recently,

the Palo Alto Weekly endorsed the measure
while the Daily Post wrote in opposition to it.
Students for a Sustainable Stanford also en
dorsed the measure.

"I think policy-making is very often about
compromising and finding middle ground
about issues," said Palo Alto Mayor Sid Es
pinosa. "I'm a very strong supporter of com
posting. I think a regional approach does
make sense. There are other options that we
could consider. Before we even have that
conversation, I just have to say on the bot

torn line that I don't think we should un-ded
icate park land, period."
Espinosa responded to concerns that the
park itself does not have an elaborate plan
by emphasizing that it is not supposed to be
manicured land, but rather a natural pre
serve.

"You have to weigh the fact that once
parkland is gone in most communities it
doesn't come back," Espinosa continued.
