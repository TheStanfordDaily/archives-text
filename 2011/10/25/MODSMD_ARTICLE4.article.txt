## EPA Academy faces critical transition Charter school still stable amid changes 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
East Palo Alto Academy High
School, the only remaining
branch of Stanford New Schools,
has seen relative stability this fall
after facing turmoil since spring
2010, when the school board de
nied the school's request for a
five-year charter renewal, instead
granting a two-year extension

through this year.
Stanford New Schools is a non
profit organization overseen by
the Stanford School of Education.
Founded in 2005, it strives to in
corporate "research-based prac
tices" through "innovative collab
oration with Stanford Universi
ty," as written in its mission state
ment.

East Palo Alto Academy High
School (EPAAHS) serves 250 to
300 students in grades 9-12 from
East Palo Alto, eastern Menlo
Park and Redwood City. Stanford
New Schools assumed manage

ment four years after the high
school opened. According to its
website, 85 percent of entering
freshmen who do not move away
or transfer graduate on time. Of
those seniors, 90 percent go on to
college.

"The school is definitely off to
a wonderful start this year, going
off last year," said EPAAHS prin
ciple Yetunde Reeves.
Reeves is part of the new lead
ership team that came in last year
after 2010. The turnover included
a new principle, vice principle and
CEO.

The shift to a new leadership
team was not the school's only
source of instability. After receiv
ing a new charter last year,
EPAAHS is currently adjusting to
a new dean of the Stanford School

of Education, Claude Steele. The
school will also need to acclimate
to a new location in East Palo Alto
next year, per the two-year exten
sion agreement.
Stanford New Schools operated
a middle and elementary school
until April 2010, when the
Ravenswood City School District
discontinued its charter for grades
K-4 and 6-8. The fifth grade operat
ed during the 2010-2011 school
year so that students could transi

tion to junior high beginning in
sixth grade, but it will not resume.
The decision to terminate the pro
gram was associated with the
schools' classification as "persist
ently low-achieving" by the state,
largely because of its K-8 test
scores.
Despite the high school's suc
cesses, the school board denied
Stanford's five-year charter renew
al request for the Academy in 2010.
While Stanford New Schools
had agreed to gradually terminate
its K-12 program, the organization
defended the high school and peti
tioned Sequoia Union High School
District for charter renewal.

On May 4 this year, the Sequoia

Union High School District Board
of Trustees unanimously approved
the charter petition. The high
school has now secured its charter
for the 2012-2013 academic year
and will have a new location on
Myrtle Street in East Palo Alto.
"It will be a new school," Reeves
said of the change. "We are really
looking at strengthening our early
college program. The new school
will definitely have more of a focus
on [that]."
As the school's situation be
comes more stable and predictable,
the faculty described the environ
ment as becoming less stressful.
"I think overall the culture has
changed," said EPAAHS Opera-

tions and Data Specialist Gabriela
Guerrero. "There are not as many
fights .. . [and] there have been
more student activities."

"I can't compare it to when I
wasn't here," Reeves said of her po
sition, going into her second year at
the school. "I can just talk about
what I see since I've been here [sic].
But I definitely feel like ... we are
strengthening the instructional
program, working on the climate
[and] preparing kids for college."
"Obviously ... we are just real
ly optimistic about our future," she
said.
