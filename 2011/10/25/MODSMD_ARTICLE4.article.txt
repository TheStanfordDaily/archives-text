## EPA Academy faces critical transition Charter school still stable amid changes 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
East Palo Alto Academy High
School, the only remaining
branch of Stanford New Schools,
has seen relative stability this fall
after facing turmoil since spring
2010, when the school board de
nied the school's request for a
five-year charter renewal, instead
granting a two-year extension

through this year.
Stanford New Schools is a non
profit organization overseen by
the Stanford School of Education.
Founded in 2005, it strives to in
corporate "research-based prac
tices" through "innovative collab
oration with Stanford Universi
ty," as written in its mission state
ment.

East Palo Alto Academy High
School (EPAAHS) serves 250 to
300 students in grades 9-12 from
East Palo Alto, eastern Menlo
Park and Redwood City. Stanford
New Schools assumed manage

ment four years after the high
school opened. According to its
website, 85 percent of entering
freshmen who do not move away
or transfer graduate on time. Of
those seniors, 90 percent go on to
college.

"The school is definitely off to
a wonderful start this year, going
off last year," said EPAAHS prin
ciple Yetunde Reeves.
Reeves is part of the new lead
ership team that came in last year
after 2010. The turnover included
a new principle, vice principle and
CEO.

The shift to a new leadership
team was not the school's only
source of instability. After receiv
ing a new charter last year,
EPAAHS is currently adjusting to
a new dean of the Stanford School
