## New contract between city and firefighters 
### MELODY WONG 
After 16 months of negotiations, the
Palo Alto City Council unanimously rat
ified a new contract with city firefighters
at last Monday's council meeting.
The city council and the International
Association of Fire Fighters Local 1319
struggled through tense negotiations and
binding-arbitration proceedings over the
past year and a half. The groups settled
on a three-year contract that would save
the city $l.l million for the current fiscal
year and reel in more than $1.4 million
annual savings for the future years.
This move brings the city a step closer
in its attempt to close the $4.3 million gap

The Palo Alto City Council ratified a new contract for city firefighters after 16 months of negotiations. The
agreement eliminated the minimum staffing condition of 29 on-duty firefighters in the firehouse at all times.
in the city's budget passed by the
city council in June, without any ob
vious reductions in services.

The new deal, ratified by the
firefighters union in September,
implemented a structural readjust
ment of firefighter benefits, includ
ing establishing a second pension
tier for new employees and requir
ing employees to contribute to their
own pensions and medical premi
ums. Rather than the city paying its
firefighters with shares to the Cali
fornia Public Employees Retire
ment System (CaIPERS), union
members will directly start with a
6.5 percent CaIPERS member con
tribution, which will increase to 9
percent the next year.
Stanford University pays for a
third of the Palo Alto firefighters'
payroll and a quarter of their costs
for fire engines and other capital
equipment.

One significant change through
the new firefighter contract is the
elimination of the mandatory mini
mum staffing condition. This con
tentious provision mandated that at
least 29 on-duty firefighters be
present at all times, a costly action
for the city.
The "mandatory staffing re
quirement prevented the city from
managing in an efficient way," said
Councilman Larry Klein.
The agreement revamped the
entire staffing section of the con
tract, stipulating a bare minimum of
at least one fire captain, one fire ap
paratus operator and one firefight
er for each engine, truck and rescue

company. Similarly, only two para
medics will be on staff in the fire de
partment.

The council's Policy & Services
Committee is expected to give a
more detailed report in November
on more ways to reduce staffing
costs and lower fire department
staffing levels.

Councilman Pat Burt stated that
these changes were "an important
step" and "necessary measures to
take as a city in order for a sustain
able future."

The deal, discussed extensively
by city officials, prevented possible
layoffs of police officers and the
closing of fire stations, a proposal
they have contemplated since May.
The new firefighter plan may close
the $4.3 million hole with the help
of a $2.1 million transfer of funds
from the city's budget stabilization
reserve.

The agreement required the
firefighters union to make conces
sions that most other union and
non-unionized labor groups of pro
fessionals and managers, including
the Service Employees Interna
tional Union and Local 521, have
made over the past two years. Since
the downturn of the economy, labor
group members have faced tumul
tuous negotiations over their bene
fit packages, including accepting
second pension tiers and required
contributions to medical payments.
Initially, the firefighters strug
gled to reach a compromise with
the city council when city officials
refused their $3.1 million proposal
in late June and declined their of
fers of mediation in late July.
The initial proposal included
$3.1 million in concessions that in
cluded a four percent wage de
crease for firefighters and engi
neers and a five percent decrease
for captains and fire inspectors, as
well as a 10 percent contribution to
their health insurance premiums
and adjustments to the pension for
mula for new employees.
However, the union presented
the proposal while the city council
contemplated altering the city's
procedure for settling labor dis
putes with public safety workers
and management, which under cur
rent law is through binding arbitra
tion.

This led to the controversial
Nov. 8 ballot Measure D, opposed
by the firefighter union, to overturn
the policy of binding arbitration.
