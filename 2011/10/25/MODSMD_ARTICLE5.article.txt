## New contract between city and firefighters 
### MELODY WONG 
After 16 months of negotiations, the
Palo Alto City Council unanimously rat
ified a new contract with city firefighters
at last Monday's council meeting.
The city council and the International
Association of Fire Fighters Local 1319
struggled through tense negotiations and
binding-arbitration proceedings over the
past year and a half. The groups settled
on a three-year contract that would save
the city $l.l million for the current fiscal
year and reel in more than $1.4 million
annual savings for the future years.
This move brings the city a step closer
in its attempt to close the $4.3 million gap
