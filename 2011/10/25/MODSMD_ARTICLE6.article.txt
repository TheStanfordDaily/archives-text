# STUDENT LIFE
## Public service careers draw graduates Service route remains popular across fields 
### SHELLEY XU 
Recent Stanford graduates are in
creasingly interested in pursuing
public service opportunities after
graduation, according to representa
tives of the Haas Center for Public
Service and the Career Develop
ment Center (CDC).
Jim Murray, the Haas Center
Postgraduate Public Service Pro
gram director, thinks that this trend
may be correlated with recent
changes in the world.
"I think this generation sees
themselves as a part of a much larger
global community," Murray said.
"You've been exposed to things like
global warming, inequities around
food distribution, healthcare, educa
tional inequities."
Murray added that the definition
of public service is broader than one
may think.
"Public service can be working for
a nonprofit organization, a philan
thropic foundation, a government
entity at the local, national or inter
national level," Murray said. "It can
be working for a for-profit organiza
tion that has a public service aspect
like social corporate responsibility."
Murray cited examples such as
for-profit groups that help with mak
ing housing for disaster victims, and
the Institute of Design at Stanford, or
d.school, an offshoot of the Gradu
ate School of Business that uses de
sign to help make extremely afford
able products for public service
goals.
The economy may also influence
a student's choice to go into public
service.
"When the market is really bad,
some of the options that they usually
might jump into like the business
world aren't there," Murray said. In
stead, students look to public service
opportunities such as AmeriCorps
and Teach for America.
"Some people enjoy working
with people," said CDC director
Lance Choy. "They enjoy helping.
Others find it very rewarding to
shape policy."
Olivia Hu 'l2 said she wants to
work in public service after gradua
tion because of the magnitude of her
potential impact.
"It's so important," she said. "It's
important because it's billions of
people."
Hu hopes to work in education
policy, especially for girls in the Mid
dle East.
For Lucia Constantine 'lO, spend
ing a year in AmeriCorps working at
a community garden to help in nutri
tion and food issues helped her ex
plore her interests. Constantine now
works in the Haas Center as the pub
lic service leadership and postgradu
ate programs coordinator.
"It was an opportunity for me to
explore the concepts that I had spent
four years learning about in a real
world setting," Constantine said.
At the same time, a career in pub
lic service can enhance skills.
"I gained some work experience
and some intangible skills that you
don't develop in school," Constan
tine added.
The experience may also help stu
dents in applying to and during grad-

uate school.
"It helps you decide what you
want to do with your graduate de
gree," Murray said. "I think it brings
a lot more experience and qualifica
tions, especially for business school,
[medical] school and law school, be
cause they're looking for mature
candidates."
However, many students cite fi
nancial concerns as a strong deter
rent against a public service career,
or at least a worrisome aspect.
"Financial things are weighing
heavily on my mind right now," said
Jaclyn Le 'l2. Le has decided to pur
sue public service after graduation
despite these concerns.
The Haas Center provides stu
dents with services including a career
database, summer fellowships and
an alumni-networking service. More
than 30 organizations will come to
recruit students at the center's Year
of Service Fair on Oct. 27.
Ultimately for Le, financial con
cerns are trumped by her wish to
help shape policy.
"I think it's ultimately that if pub
lic service is something you love to
do, there's ways to make it work," Le
said. "This is what I'm passionate
about. That's what's going to make
me happy."
