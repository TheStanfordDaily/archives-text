## Stanford researchers develop'super skin' 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
Stanford researchers have devel
oped a stretchable, skin-like sensor
as the latest accomplishment in asso
ciate professor of chemical engineer
ing Zhenan Bao's quest to create a
"super skin."
The transparent skin-like pres
sure sensor employs pioneering elas
tic that can stretch to twice its normal
length in any direction and return to
its normal length without suffering
any deformation. The sensor may
have far-reaching applications in the
fields of touch-sensitive computer
displays, robotics and prosthetic
limbs. A large variety of medical ap
plications may also be possible.
Darren Lipomi, a postdoctoral re
searcher, and Benjamin Tee and
Michael Vosgueritchian, both gradu
ate students in electrical engineering,
are the lead authors of the paper
published online by "Nature Nan
otechnology" on Oct. 23. Bao is a
coauthor.
The sensor can measure pressure
on it, ranging from a pinch to the
weight of an elephant, according to
Lipomi. The device uses a clear film
of single-walled carbon nanotubes
acting as tiny springs, which protect
the sensor from damage when
stretched.
Researchers created the carbon
"nanosprings" by spraying nan
otubes in a liquid suspension onto a
thin layer of silicone.
Stretching the silicone and re
turning it to its original shape forms
the nanotubes into tiny springs,
which can then detect pressure, while
limiting damage from future stretch
ing. Researchers "pre-stretched" the
silicone in both perpendicular direc
tions to lend the material the ability
to rebound when stretched from any
direction.
The nanostructures act as elec
trodes in measuring the force applied
to them, made possible by the fact
that the stretching to create the
springs does not alter the electrical
conductivity of the material.
The sensor itself consists of three
layers of silicone one layer of
standard, easily deformed silicone
surrounded by two layers of the nan
otube-coated silicone. The two nan
otube-coated layers sense the change
in electrical charge stored in the mid

die layer when force is exerted on the
device.
