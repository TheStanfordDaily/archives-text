## EDITORIAL Save some ire for Capitol Hill 
### 
We have commended the
Occupy Wall Street pro
testers for directing atten
tion to imprudent financial sector
risk-taking and economic inequali
ty. But more than highlighting prob
lems, we like protests that press for
solutions. For this, we suggest the
protesters add a new target: Capitol
Hill. For one thing, while the finan
cial firms that caused this crisis could
certainly improve their risk-man
agement practices, it is the govern
ment's responsibility to reform the
incentive system that failed so spec
tacularly. Obstinate lawmakers
blocking reform, not those who
work on Wall Street, are culpable for
future threats to economic stability.
Moreover, with millions of Ameri
cans looking for work in this reces
sion, it is Congress, not Wall Street,
refusing to enact sensible, politically
moderate policies that would help
address the nation's most urgent
problem.
Protesters have a variety of com
plaints, but it seems clear that the
unemployment crisis is a significant
source of their motivation. Fourteen
million Americans have been un
employed for an average of 40.8
weeks, nearly twice as long as the
previous post-World War II high. As
the 6.2 million who have been out of
work for more than six months
struggle to make ends meet, re
search indicates that their mental
and physical health deteriorates, as
will their prospects for future earn
ings and employment. Federal Re
serve Chairman Ben Bernanke has
called this situation a "national cri
sis" and urged politicians to act.
But politicians have failed to
take any action, emphatically reject
ing President Barack Obama's push
to combat unemployment with a se
ries of bipartisan initiatives outlined
in the American Jobs Act. The bill
would not completely fix the econo
my, but its impact would be real.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of
Moody's Analytics and former ad
viser to John McCain, estimates that
passing it would create 1.9 million
extra jobs next year, enough to cut
the unemployment rate by a full
percentage point.
Furthermore, the ideas in this
jobs bill ought to be uncontrover

sial. The central proposals include
tax cuts for small businesses and hir
ing veterans, which Republicans
have long supported, payroll tax
cuts supported by both parties sev
eral times in the past decade and in
frastructure investments co-spon
sored by Democrat John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Republican Kay
Bailey Hutchison of Texas. Experts
estimate that just maintaining the
condition of America's deteriorat
ing infrastructure will require $2.2
trillion. With over a million con-

struction workers are looking for
work and the cost of borrowing at
an all-time low, there is no better
time to fix our roads and bridges.
The American Jobs Act would have
done that, put money in the pockets
of consumers, stemmed the tide of
laid-off teachers and firefighters,
and much more if it had not stalled
in the United States Congress. Re
publicans, who unanimously killed
the bill, have presented no alterna
tive. Their so-called jobs plan con
tains arguably sensible long-run
policies, but according to independ
ent, nonpartisan analysts such as
Moody's and the Congressional
Budget Office will have no impact
on short-run employment.
Ostensibly, opponents of sup
porting job creation do so in defer
ence to the threat of long-run
deficits. But when they had their
chance to rectify America's fiscal ex
cesses, Congress refused to solve
that problem as well. When Presi
dent Obama offered Speaker
Boehner a plan to reduce future
deficits by $4 trillion over the next
decade through 83 percent spend
ing cuts and 17 percent revenue in
creases, his offer almost exactly mir
rored the original Republican pro
posal of 85 percent spending cuts
and 15 percent tax increases. That
would seem like a promising cir
cumstance for a resolution, but
when opposition to the President
manifested itself as opposition to
compromise on even the most fa
vorable terms, we ended up instead
with meager deficit reduction, a
haphazardly constructed "super
committee" and a downgrade of
America's credit rating. Econo-

mists, including conservative Re
publicans like Bernanke, have long
emphasized that reducing long-run
deficits can and should be coupled
with continuing to support a weak
economy in the near term. Instead,
our Congress produced the worst of
both worlds, damaging the recovery
now and doing nothing to improve
our financial health in the future.

Our list of complaints about
Congress could easily keep going. It
almost seems too hopeful to criticize
the utterly miserable failures to ad
dress long-run issues such as climate
change or education. If they can't

walk and chew gum at the same
time, we don't expect to see cart
wheels. But if the Occupy Wall
Street protesters care about jobs
and we believe that this concern has
provided fuel to their fire then
they ought to focus their anger at the
lawmakers who ignore this issue. At
best, congressional inaction is con
demning American workers to un
precedented levels of protracted
suffering. And at worst, if it allows
the current payroll tax cut and un
employment benefits to expire at
the end of the year, it could well drag
the economy back into recession.
Firms on Wall Street have created
major problems for America, but
have very little power to solve them.

called this situation a "national cri
sis" and urged politicians to act.
But politicians have failed to
take any action, emphatically reject
ing President Barack Obama's push
to combat unemployment with a se
ries of bipartisan initiatives outlined
in the American Jobs Act. The bill
would not completely fix the econo
my, but its impact would be real.
Mark Zandi, chief economist of
Moody's Analytics and former ad
viser to John McCain, estimates that
passing it would create 1.9 million
extra jobs next year, enough to cut
the unemployment rate by a full
percentage point.
Furthermore, the ideas in this
jobs bill ought to be uncontrover

sial. The central proposals include
tax cuts for small businesses and hir
ing veterans, which Republicans
have long supported, payroll tax
cuts supported by both parties sev
eral times in the past decade and in
frastructure investments co-spon
sored by Democrat John Kerry of
Massachusetts and Republican Kay
Bailey Hutchison of Texas. Experts
estimate that just maintaining the
condition of America's deteriorat
ing infrastructure will require $2.2
trillion. With over a million con-

struction workers are looking for
work and the cost of borrowing at
an all-time low, there is no better
time to fix our roads and bridges.
The American Jobs Act would have
done that, put money in the pockets
of consumers, stemmed the tide of
laid-off teachers and firefighters,
and much more if it had not stalled
in the United States Congress. Re
publicans, who unanimously killed
the bill, have presented no alterna
tive. Their so-called jobs plan con
tains arguably sensible long-run
policies, but according to independ
ent, nonpartisan analysts such as
Moody's and the Congressional
Budget Office will have no impact
on short-run employment.
Ostensibly, opponents of sup
porting job creation do so in defer
ence to the threat of long-run
deficits. But when they had their
chance to rectify America's fiscal ex
cesses, Congress refused to solve
that problem as well. When Presi
dent Obama offered Speaker
Boehner a plan to reduce future
deficits by $4 trillion over the next
decade through 83 percent spend
ing cuts and 17 percent revenue in
creases, his offer almost exactly mir
rored the original Republican pro
posal of 85 percent spending cuts
and 15 percent tax increases. That
would seem like a promising cir
cumstance for a resolution, but
when opposition to the President
manifested itself as opposition to
compromise on even the most fa
vorable terms, we ended up instead
with meager deficit reduction, a
haphazardly constructed "super
committee" and a downgrade of
America's credit rating. Econo-

mists, including conservative Re
publicans like Bernanke, have long
emphasized that reducing long-run
deficits can and should be coupled
with continuing to support a weak
economy in the near term. Instead,
our Congress produced the worst of
both worlds, damaging the recovery
now and doing nothing to improve
our financial health in the future.

Our list of complaints about
Congress could easily keep going. It
almost seems too hopeful to criticize
the utterly miserable failures to ad
dress long-run issues such as climate
change or education. If they can't

walk and chew gum at the same
time, we don't expect to see cart
wheels. But if the Occupy Wall
Street protesters care about jobs
and we believe that this concern has
provided fuel to their fire then
they ought to focus their anger at the
lawmakers who ignore this issue. At
best, congressional inaction is con
demning American workers to un
precedented levels of protracted
suffering. And at worst, if it allows
the current payroll tax cut and un
employment benefits to expire at
the end of the year, it could well drag
the economy back into recession.
Firms on Wall Street have created
major problems for America, but
have very little power to solve them.
The people hurting America now
are the ones on Capitol Hill.
We have commended the
Occupy Wall Street pro
testers for directing atten
tion to imprudent financial sector
risk-taking and economic inequali
ty. But more than highlighting prob
lems, we like protests that press for
solutions. For this, we suggest the
protesters add a new target: Capitol
Hill. For one thing, while the finan
cial firms that caused this crisis could
certainly improve their risk-man
agement practices, it is the govern
ment's responsibility to reform the
incentive system that failed so spec
tacularly. Obstinate lawmakers
blocking reform, not those who
work on Wall Street, are culpable for
future threats to economic stability.
Moreover, with millions of Ameri
cans looking for work in this reces
sion, it is Congress, not Wall Street,
refusing to enact sensible, politically
moderate policies that would help
address the nation's most urgent
problem.
Protesters have a variety of com
plaints, but it seems clear that the
unemployment crisis is a significant
source of their motivation. Fourteen
million Americans have been un
employed for an average of 40.8
weeks, nearly twice as long as the
previous post-World War II high. As
the 6.2 million who have been out of
work for more than six months
struggle to make ends meet, re
search indicates that their mental
and physical health deteriorates, as
will their prospects for future earn
ings and employment. Federal Re
serve Chairman Ben Bernanke has
called this situation a "national cri
sis" and urged politicians to act.
