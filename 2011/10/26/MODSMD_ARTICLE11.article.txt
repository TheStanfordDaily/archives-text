# OP-ED
## Cheer leaving 
### GLENN H.TRUITT, SLS '50 Stanford Law School 
It has been just over seven years
since I wrote my very first piece
for The Stanford Daily, an op-ed
entitled, "Cheerleaders deserve
spot on field," where I vigorously
argued for Stanford's club cheer
leading team to have equal claim to
sideline space in the interests of val
idating the football team's perform
ance with equally impressive side
line entertainment. In the interven
ing time, I also took on the continu
ously underwhelming Stanford
Band and Stanford fans (i.e. student
section), but after attending my first
cheer reunion, noted the surprising
ly skilled (or at least well-intended)
modern incarnations of these previ
ous abominations. However, after
watching three Stanford "cheer
leaders" abortively bungle a basic
level skill on a nationally-televised
game this past weekend, the time
has come to revoke that sideline li
cense and take Stanford Cheer off
the field once and for all.
Stanford is a world class institu
tion both academically and athleti
cally, and it advertises each with
equal vigor and aplomb. The name
of the University has become as
synonymous with excellence as it
has with a tireless work ethic, un
common effort and enduring
sportsmanship. But what I've seen
of Stanford Cheer in the past few

years, and culminating in the na
tionally televised embarrassment
from this weekend, embody pre
cisely none of those things, and
enough is enough. After 10 years of
competitive cheerleading, I can tell
you just how hard it is; how much ef
fort, practice and focus it takes and
the toughness required to continue
to give all of that in the face of so
many who tell you it's not a real
sport and that you're not a real ath
lete. I can also tell you that Stanford
Cheer isn't giving any real effort,
engaging in any real practice and
couldn't have less focus if they just
stood there watching the game.
While their skill level is deplorable,
it's nothing compared to their obvi
ous lack of training and effort.
Stanford proudly flies a Pac-12
flag, but can't come close to meeting
the Pac-12 standard for game day
entertainment. The cheer teams
from Oregon, Washington and Ari
zona State are nationally competi
tive. The squads from Washington
State and Oregon State acquit
themselves well, and UCTA always
seems to have a good-looking and
hard-working team on the field.
While USC doesn't field a coed
team, at least it has a band that can
march. In fact, I can't think of any of
