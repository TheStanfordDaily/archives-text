# JOBBERISH
## Parlez-vous anglais?

For those of you currently on
the (hot) prowl for jobs, I'm
sure you've heard of a little
slice of on-campus heaven called the
Career Development Center
(CDC). If you haven't, the CDC is a
magical place where all your worries
disappear and your post-Stanford
future is no longer a scary black hole
of worry and uncertainty. I had an
appointment in this fairytale land
last week, and I left a changed
woman. As someone who has liter
ally no idea what I want to do when
I grow up, this past month had been

an incredibly stressful time, and
those crazy consulting people didn't
make things any easier. But I've now
realized, thanks to the wonderful
people at the CDC, that it's okay to
not have some great life plan right
now. There will never be a better
time in our lives to do things like
travel and live abroad, and with the
economy as it is, there might not be
a worse time to enter the job mar
ket. What that means is that maybe
we shouldn't be searching tirelessly
for future careers, but instead for
short-term solutions. And as appeal

ing as that one-year, unpaid intern
ship may sound, we all agree a job
that pays would be even better. And
a job that pays and lets you travel
abroad? Well, that's a dream come
true, and it's also this week's topic:
the accent-reduction specialist.
If you want a job that's more ob
scure and unique than say, a media
tor, you might enjoy this (also, you
might be just a little bit hipster.) Ba
sically, an accent-reduction special
ist works with foreigners learning
English as a second language to
make their accents more like those
of native speakers. This means that,
as an accent-reduction specialist,
most of your time is spent abroad
although to be fair, a handful of ac
cent-reduction specialists work
with southerners in America to
make their accents more under
standable (no offense, southerners
I think your drawls are great).
Not only does this job let you
travel around and live in foreign
places, but it pays enough that you
don't have to go into debt to do it.
The average annual salary for an ac
cent-reduction specialist is $63,000,
and while you won't be eating off
gold plates, that's more than enough
to allow you to experience living
abroad without starving. So as ap
pealing as that old cliche of travel
ing around Europe eating only
bread and taking odd jobs to sur
