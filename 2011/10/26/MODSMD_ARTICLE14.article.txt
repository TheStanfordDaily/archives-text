# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Reevaluating undergraduate diversity 
### Jamie Solomon 
Stanford's viewbook states that
"we believe that a student body
that is both highly qualified and
diverse in terms of culture, socioeco
nomic status, race, ethnicity, back
ground, work and life experiences,
skills and interests is essential to the
educational process." Stanford's un
dergraduate student body is amaz
ingly diverse, showing that this state
ment is more than just words on a
website, and this diversity is enrich
ing to the education of Stanford stu
dents in both formal and informal
ways.

However, I want to question the
way our school defines diversity and
if we truly are as inclusive of all kinds
of diversity with regards to admis
sions as we say we are. Although I
think our Office of Undergraduate
Admission does a wonderful job in
admitting a wide range of students,
there are areas that should be exam
ined to see if they could be im
proved.

There are three statistics about
diversity that our Admissions Office
published on the website: race, finan
cial aid and first generation college
status. These clearly do not encom
pass all of the factors that an admis
sions officer uses to make decisions,
but through publicly declaring our
diversity solely through these few
categories we may be doing our
selves a disservice and limiting our
definition of diversity. Race becomes
the dominant measurement and way
to evaluate Stanford's diversity,
shortchanging those that bring other
experiences to our school. Many
elite schools have low representa
tion of those whose families are in
volved with the military, are farmers,

conservatives, students with children
and students older than 25. Addi
tionally, a Princeton study shows that
in elite college admissions, white stu
dents from poor backgrounds have a
disproportionately harder time get
ting accepted than whites with more
money or students of color with sim
ilar socioeconomic status levels,
meaning that college admissions
place a greater emphasis on racial di
versity than class, disadvantaging
certain students who don't increase
statistical diversity.
These published statistics use
standard racial categories, which can
obfuscate important distinctions
that enrich our student body. For ex
ample, in this classification system,
Middle Eastern students are consid
ered white, even though they are a
group that experiences strong dis
crimination in the United States.
Given current events, it is more im
portant than ever to have well-edu
cated Americans with Middle East
ern cultural knowledge and for stu
dents to have Middle Eastern class
mates so their cultural understand
ings are not just based on negative
media portrayals. Although we do
seem to have a healthy population of
students of Middle Eastern decent, it
is important that distinctions like
this do not get ignored because they
are not visible in the statistics we
publish.

Last but not least, these statistics
can be unintentionally misleading,
making a school appear to serve
populations it does not. A recent ar
ticle on the website for Applause
Africa highlighted the fact that,
among Ivy League schools, the racial
category of "Black" or "African-

American" is still being used as a
subtle way to exclude those who
come from a legacy of slavery in this
country. Almost half of the black stu
dent populations are recent African
immigrants, even though first- and
second-generation Africans immi
grants make up less than 1 percent of
America's population. This group is
disproportionately wealthy and
equally likely to attend and graduate
from college as Americans of other
races with similar socioeconomic
status profiles. The fact that they are
categorized in the same way as his
torically African-American groups
allows the universities to appear to
be serving those that have been his
torically excluded from higher edu
cation better than they are. Recent
African immigrants are not less valu
able than historically African-Amer
ican people in adding to a school's di
versity, but lumping the two cate
gories together makes admissions
statistics easy to misread and covers
up the fact that historically African-
American high school students are
still not being admitted to top uni
versities in a representative way. The
students for whom a system of in
creasing diversity was designed to
help are being shut out in favor of
more privileged students.
So, although I love both the di
versity at our school and that this is
something that Stanford values

highly, I still wonder if we are truly
admitting a student body that is "di
verse in terms of culture, socioeco
nomic status, race, ethnicity, back
ground, work and life experiences,
skills and interests." I suspect that
our allegiance to racial statistics
creates a system of buckets that di
minishes important distinctions
within categories. Although racial
diversity is key, touting only that
statistic publicly to demonstrate
our diversity shortchanges the
other areas that we purportedly
value, which in turn deprives our
students of valuable learning expe
riences while in college.
