## Ifs Tebow time in Denver 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
Just call him the Mile-High
Messiah. The Big Tebowski.
The Docile Apostle. Throw
whichever moniker you pre
fer on him, but Denver Bron
co quarterback Tim Tebow is serving
up dinner at tables across America
this week (in spirit, of course), and the
main entree is a healthy helping of
crow.

On Sunday, the 2007 Heisman Tro
phy winner got his first start of the sea
son and fourth of his young career
and led the Broncos to a stunning
18-15 comeback victory over the
Miami Dolphins in overtime.
Trailing by 15 points with just over
five minutes remaining in the fourth
quarter on the road (although it was
"Tim Tebow Day" at Sun Life Stadi
um),Tebow rallied the troops with an
80-yard touchdown drive.
But "Touchdown Jesus" was just
getting started.

With the help of the Dolphins'
Marion Moore, who couldn't help but
bobble the onside kick with God
pulling the strings from above, Tebow
got the ball, and a short field, with 2:43
to go.

Down by eight, Tebow sliced and
diced his way down the field, scram
bling around in the pocket and com
pleting passes like he was the next
coming of John Elway in Denver. Ex
cept after Tebow had finished running
for his two-point conversion to send
the game into overtime, and Matt
Prater split the uprights from 52 yards,
the boy who spends his summers help
ing orphans in the Philippines did in
his first four games what Elway took
15 years to accomplish rally from
at least 13 points down in the fourth
quarter. Twice.

Don't get me wrong, the Tebow
worshippers need to take a step back
and slow down with the signs (they
also might want to consider how much
they really want a man's sweaty pair of
pants) because they ought to be sup
porting the real hero of the game, Mr.
Anthony Sparano 111. I know he does
n't need me to tell him, but he really
shouldn't have gone for two when an
extra point would have worked just
fine.

And even though I'm no offensive
coordinator although I may be
calling plays soon enough at the annu
al Stanford D aily vs. Daily Californian
touch football showdown, the Ink
Bowl I don't think that running the
ball three straight times with a starting
tailback who was averaging 2.8 yards
per carry was the best option to get a
critical first down.
And of course, there is the fact that
Tebow was God-awful for the first 55
minutes of the game. You don't need
to be Jon Gruden to know that 4-14
for 40 yards without a third-down con
version in 10 attempts is bad. Really,
really bad.
Before Timmy got his groove back,
the Broncos were in danger of being
shut out for the first time in 20 years.
And a lot of it wosTebow's fault.
His mechanics were shaky at best,
he held on to the ball too long, he was
sacked seven times and plenty of his
throws were in danger of being unin
tentional intentional groundings. That
gives those who love to hate Tim's re
ligious antics and goody two-shoes act
(which, for the record, I don't think is
an act) plenty of fuel for the fire.
But until he starts to lose, let's give
him some props. Because I love clich
es, and Tebow fulfills about a million
of them, chief among them twinning
ugly. But who cares, because as soon as
Sparano decided he didn't want to
stay employed, and the Miami de
fense figured letting Tebow part their
secondary like the Red Sea was the
best way togetonSportsCenter,itwas
tTebow time.
There are plenty of noble cam
paigns going on around the NFL to
land our own savior, Mr. Luck, in the
Draft this spring. Seattle is doing its
damndest to lose out after somehow
losing track of who it was and knock
ing off the G-Men.
And Minnesota, Indianapolis and
St. Louis are all fighting hard to prove
they don't like winning either, (i will
give the Rams a pass, however, as they
already have their quarterback of the
future in Sam Bradford.)
But the Broncos have so many
other problems that quarterback is ac
tually not the highest priority on their
list. Plenty of people slammed

Tebow's "comeback" as irrelevant be
cause of how bad the Dolphins are,
combined with his terrible perform
ance for most of the game.
Perhaps they forget that Denver
is pretty damn bad. No offense, but
right now the Rocky Mountains
would be a much better defense than
anything Dennis Allen can put on
the field. And speaking of offense, it's
usually not a good sign when your
leading receiver averages fewer than
50 yards a game. Actually, that's a re
ally bad sign.
So perhaps the Broncos ought to

look to shore up their defensive and
offensive line, which is very much like
a sieve, and let the young man do his
scrambling, twisting, erratic-throw
thing. And when you need miracles
every Sunday on the field, I sure as
hell think there are worse characters
to be under center. (Umm, Michael
Vick and Ben Roethlisberger, any
one?)
So maybe the Broncos don't need
Luck. After all, they've got Tim
maayyyyy.
