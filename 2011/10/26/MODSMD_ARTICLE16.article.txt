He pulled off the greatest statistical
upset in college football history over
four years ago, became a significant
contributor to the turnaround of the
Stanford program and has already
spent a full season as a volunteer assistant for the
squad. But believe it or not, Tavita Pritchard still
has a lot to learn about football.
And he'll admit it as quickly as anybody.
That's because, despite having thrown for
2,865 yards and 15 touchdowns in 31 career ap
pearances wearing Cardinal, Pritchard has now
set his sights on defense.
"Right now I'm really just trying to be a
sponge and trying to be a student of the game,"
Pritchard said. "And it worked out staff-wise for
me to be able to be a defensive staff assistant, and
I jumped at the opportunity to be on this staff and
get to work with [Co-Defensive Coordinators]
Derek Mason and JasonTarver. It's a tremendous


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
opportunity for me to learn football
and defensive philosophy from
them."

"I'm just trying to take as much in
as I can, learn as much as I can, for
when I do coach down the road
be it on offense or defense I'll be
the best prepared that I can be," he
added.

Early returns indicate that
Pritchard is headed in the right di
rection.

"Well, we got lucky enough that
they were going to let us have Tavita,
number one, because he's excellent:
He has work ethic, he has intelli
gence and he's a Stanford guy so he's
got to be pretty smart," Tarver said.
"You tell him something, he gets it
done."

And as the Cardinal heads back
into the L. A. Coliseum this weekend
riding a two-game road winning
streak against USC, Stanford fans
will be remembering Oct. 6, 2007,
when Pritchard got something quite
memorable done.

Coming in as a 41-point under
dog against the No. 1 team in the
country and with then-backup
Pritchard making his first career
start in one of the largest stadiums in
college football, nobody was sur
prised when Stanford failed to score
an offensive touchdown in the first
three quarters. But the Cardinal
hung around behind a stifling defen
sive performance, and a 37-yard pass
to redshirt senior Mark Bradford to
the Trojan 1-yard line helped put
Stanford within just two points of
USC early in the fourth quarter.
After the Trojans added a touch
down and Stanford made a field goal
to make the score 23-17, an intercep
tion set the Cardinal up at the USC
45 with three minutes to play in the
half. Then the madness really began.
A pass-interference penalty moved
the ball up 15 yards. A botched half
back pass was salvaged by freshman
running back Jeremy Stewart, who
turned the play into a 4-yard gain. ("I
still give him a hard time for not
throwing me the ball," Pritchard said
of the current redshirt-senior.) A call
lost in translation between Pritchard
and head coach Jim Harbaugh on
fourth-and-20 turned into a tight
window pass for the first down on
a play chosen by Pritchard, no less.
And a perfect floater from the
then-sophomore found a leaping
Bradford in the end zone for the
game-winning touchdown, sending

the college football world into con
vulsions, ending the Trojans' title
hopes and reviving the spirits of the
downtrodden Stanford faithful.

All that, and Pritchard still does
n't own a "Biggest Upset Ever" t
shirt.

"I think somebody told me they
were going to give me one, but they
never followed through, so I've yet
to see that come to fruition," he
joked.

That doesn't mean Pritchard is
oblivious to the significance of "the
USC game," however.
"Absolutely, I'm very proud of
what my class and the classes above
and below me did," Pritchard said. "I
know that game really serves as a
marker, but it was just a manifesta
tion of a bigger change in this pro
gram ... Guys just saying, 'Hey, we
can be good at football. We can be
great at football here, if we just start
doing things right.'"
"So I'd say a lot of people look at
that game as a marker of this pro
gram righting the ship, but that's all it
really is: a marker," he added. "Be
cause the work is done out here on
the practice field, and in the build
ing."

And despite the historic win over
USC, Pritchard still had his work cut
out for him as a Stanford quarter
back. After sharing time with T.C.
Ostrander in 2007, Pritchard took
over the starting job the following
season and led the Cardinal within a
win of its first bowl game since 2001.
Even when his playing days seemed
to be shortened as a senior by the
emergence of one Andrew Luck,
Pritchard was called upon again on a
big stage when Luck broke his finger
before the Sun Bowl much like he
stepped in against USC after Os
trander had suffered a seizure less
than a week beforehand.
When the Cardinal fell short in a
tight 31-27 game, it looked as if
Pritchard's time on the Farm would
end on a losing note. But he had
something else in mind.
"I told [then-head coach Jim]
Harbaugh before the next season
that I wanted to get into coaching,
that I thought I owed it to myself to
at least try it out," Pritchard remem
bers. "And coach Harbaugh said,
'Great. Come on. I don't have any
staff positions open, but you can
come volunteer.' And I did every
thing from filling up coach Har
baugh's refrigerator with Diet Pepsi

to breaking down film."
Harbaugh moved on to coach the
San Francisco 49ers this season, but
Pritchard still has "fond memories"
of the man he cites as instrumental to
both his own development and the
Stanford program's.
And as the David Shaw era began
on the Farm, Pritchard reached a
turning point of his own. Taking up
his first-ever paid coaching position
on the defensive side of the ball, he
spent the offseason learning from
Tarver, Mason and perhaps just
as importantly the players.
"Now I'm starting to see the game
from the other side, how they actually
teach it and all the adjustments and
techniques they teach," Pritchard
said. "So it's a little bit of give-and
take. I'm able to relay some of my
knowledge as a quarterback to the
defensive backs, and at the same time,
I'm able to learn stuff I wasn't really
able to learn on the offensive side."

A long-time quarterback who
hasn't played defense since high
school coached by his father
David, the offensive coordinator at
Clover Park High in Washington, he
was inserted only to defend against
Hail Mary passes Pritchard was a
natural fit to work with the Cardinal
secondary.
"What's great is that you get to
know the ball through different
eyes," Tarver said. "Right now, he's
throwing deep balls to the DBs, but
he knows where the quarterback's
going to put it, so he's got knowledge
to teach them as to where the quar
terback's going to throw the ball. So
you see it from a different set, be
cause everybody comes into football
and sees it the way that they were
raised in it... it broadens your per
spective as a coach."

Who better to oversee
Pritchard's transition than Tarver?
He was a defensive back by training
who served in various defensive as
sistant roles at the college level from
1996-2000, worked on the 49ers' of
fensive staff for the four subsequent
seasons and then went back to the
defensive side of the ball, coaching
San Francisco's outside linebackers
between 2005 and 2010 before com
ing to Stanford this season.
And working with a Stanford
backfield that has its fair share of
players that started on offense,
Pritchard has run into some familiar
faces. Senior strong safety Delano
Howell took handoffs from

Pritchard in 2008 as a freshman run
ning back and caught nine passes for
94 yards that year.
"It didn't take him too long to
master the whole defense," Howell
said. "He puts time into it, he's very
passionate about everything he does
just like when he was a quarter
back ... He's put himself in a posi
tion where we can respect him, we
can look up to him; not only is he a
coach, but he's a friend as well."

Those sentiments are echoed em
phatically by Tarver.
"Tavita's doing great," he said.
"He's the best, he's already a great
coach and he's going to be whatever
he wants to be. He's that good."
But even though Pritchard seems
to have a knack for coaching, he's
not quite sure what he wants to do
next. He just hasn't had time to think
about it.

"Our goal is to play in the Rose
Bowl, and I can't see beyond that,"
Pritchard said. "The season, man, it is
a grind and it's a lot of fun hours up
in the office, but I can't see beyond
that. I'm coaching for now, I'm going
100 miles an hour and doing the best
I can, and we'll see when I come up
for air in the winter and in the spring.

We'll see what happens."
So this week, Pritchard has his
sights set back on USC (6-1,3-1 Pac
-12), which is unranked due to
NCAA sanctions but clearly one of
the top teams in the Pac-12. And
when No. 6 Stanford (7-0, 4-0) re
turns to the Coliseum for just the
second time since the Biggest Upset
Ever, it's bound to be favored over
the once-powerhouse Trojans for the
second consecutive year.
"We'll all look back on that game
with fond memories," Pritchard said
of that fateful night in 2007. "And I'm
great with that. I love being a part of
the Stanford community and being a
part of this football program, be
cause it's what we always wanted,
what you see now; us competing on a
national stage. It's what we all had
envisioned and we knew it wasn't
going to happen overnight. So if
that's a marker for the change in the
times here, great."
"And I'm proud to be a part of it,
for sure," he added. "However a
small part that I played, I'm very
proud of that."

Bowl, and I can't see beyond that,"
Pritchard said. "The season, man, it is
a grind and it's a lot of fun hours up
in the office, but I can't see beyond
that. I'm coaching for now, I'm going
100 miles an hour and doing the best
I can, and we'll see when I come up
for air in the winter and in the spring.

We'll see what happens."
So this week, Pritchard has his
sights set back on USC (6-1,3-1 Pac
-12), which is unranked due to
NCAA sanctions but clearly one of
the top teams in the Pac-12. And
when No. 6 Stanford (7-0, 4-0) re
turns to the Coliseum for just the
second time since the Biggest Upset
Ever, it's bound to be favored over
the once-powerhouse Trojans for the
second consecutive year.
"We'll all look back on that game
with fond memories," Pritchard said
of that fateful night in 2007. "And I'm
great with that. I love being a part of
the Stanford community and being a
part of this football program, be
cause it's what we always wanted,
what you see now; us competing on a
national stage. It's what we all had
envisioned and we knew it wasn't
going to happen overnight. So if
that's a marker for the change in the
times here, great."
"And I'm proud to be a part of it,
for sure," he added. "However a
small part that I played, I'm very
proud of that."

In 2007, former Stanford quarterback Tavita Pritchard (above) led the Card
to an unlikely upset over then-No. 1 USC in Los Angeles. Four years later,
he is back on the Stanford sideline, although this time as a defensive coach.
He pulled off the greatest statistical
upset in college football history over
four years ago, became a significant
contributor to the turnaround of the
Stanford program and has already
spent a full season as a volunteer assistant for the
squad. But believe it or not, Tavita Pritchard still
has a lot to learn about football.
And he'll admit it as quickly as anybody.
That's because, despite having thrown for
2,865 yards and 15 touchdowns in 31 career ap
pearances wearing Cardinal, Pritchard has now
set his sights on defense.
"Right now I'm really just trying to be a
sponge and trying to be a student of the game,"
Pritchard said. "And it worked out staff-wise for
me to be able to be a defensive staff assistant, and
I jumped at the opportunity to be on this staff and
get to work with [Co-Defensive Coordinators]
Derek Mason and JasonTarver. It's a tremendous


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
opportunity for me to learn football
and defensive philosophy from
them."

"I'm just trying to take as much in
as I can, learn as much as I can, for
when I do coach down the road
be it on offense or defense I'll be
the best prepared that I can be," he
added.

Early returns indicate that
Pritchard is headed in the right di
rection.

"Well, we got lucky enough that
they were going to let us have Tavita,
number one, because he's excellent:
He has work ethic, he has intelli
gence and he's a Stanford guy so he's
got to be pretty smart," Tarver said.
"You tell him something, he gets it
done."

And as the Cardinal heads back
into the L. A. Coliseum this weekend
riding a two-game road winning
streak against USC, Stanford fans
will be remembering Oct. 6, 2007,
when Pritchard got something quite
memorable done.

Coming in as a 41-point under
dog against the No. 1 team in the
country and with then-backup
Pritchard making his first career
start in one of the largest stadiums in
college football, nobody was sur
prised when Stanford failed to score
an offensive touchdown in the first
three quarters. But the Cardinal
hung around behind a stifling defen
sive performance, and a 37-yard pass
to redshirt senior Mark Bradford to
the Trojan 1-yard line helped put
Stanford within just two points of
USC early in the fourth quarter.
After the Trojans added a touch
down and Stanford made a field goal
to make the score 23-17, an intercep
tion set the Cardinal up at the USC
45 with three minutes to play in the
half. Then the madness really began.
A pass-interference penalty moved
the ball up 15 yards. A botched half
back pass was salvaged by freshman
running back Jeremy Stewart, who
turned the play into a 4-yard gain. ("I
still give him a hard time for not
throwing me the ball," Pritchard said
of the current redshirt-senior.) A call
lost in translation between Pritchard
and head coach Jim Harbaugh on
fourth-and-20 turned into a tight
window pass for the first down on
a play chosen by Pritchard, no less.
And a perfect floater from the
then-sophomore found a leaping
Bradford in the end zone for the
game-winning touchdown, sending

the college football world into con
vulsions, ending the Trojans' title
hopes and reviving the spirits of the
downtrodden Stanford faithful.

All that, and Pritchard still does
n't own a "Biggest Upset Ever" t
shirt.

"I think somebody told me they
were going to give me one, but they
never followed through, so I've yet
to see that come to fruition," he
joked.

That doesn't mean Pritchard is
oblivious to the significance of "the
USC game," however.
"Absolutely, I'm very proud of
what my class and the classes above
and below me did," Pritchard said. "I
know that game really serves as a
marker, but it was just a manifesta
tion of a bigger change in this pro
gram ... Guys just saying, 'Hey, we
can be good at football. We can be
great at football here, if we just start
doing things right.'"
"So I'd say a lot of people look at
that game as a marker of this pro
gram righting the ship, but that's all it
really is: a marker," he added. "Be
cause the work is done out here on
the practice field, and in the build
ing."

And despite the historic win over
USC, Pritchard still had his work cut
out for him as a Stanford quarter
back. After sharing time with T.C.
Ostrander in 2007, Pritchard took
over the starting job the following
season and led the Cardinal within a
win of its first bowl game since 2001.
Even when his playing days seemed
to be shortened as a senior by the
emergence of one Andrew Luck,
Pritchard was called upon again on a
big stage when Luck broke his finger
before the Sun Bowl much like he
stepped in against USC after Os
trander had suffered a seizure less
than a week beforehand.
When the Cardinal fell short in a
tight 31-27 game, it looked as if
Pritchard's time on the Farm would
end on a losing note. But he had
something else in mind.
"I told [then-head coach Jim]
Harbaugh before the next season
that I wanted to get into coaching,
that I thought I owed it to myself to
at least try it out," Pritchard remem
bers. "And coach Harbaugh said,
'Great. Come on. I don't have any
staff positions open, but you can
come volunteer.' And I did every
thing from filling up coach Har
baugh's refrigerator with Diet Pepsi

to breaking down film."
Harbaugh moved on to coach the
San Francisco 49ers this season, but
Pritchard still has "fond memories"
of the man he cites as instrumental to
both his own development and the
Stanford program's.
And as the David Shaw era began
on the Farm, Pritchard reached a
turning point of his own. Taking up
his first-ever paid coaching position
on the defensive side of the ball, he
spent the offseason learning from
Tarver, Mason and perhaps just
as importantly the players.
"Now I'm starting to see the game
from the other side, how they actually
teach it and all the adjustments and
techniques they teach," Pritchard
said. "So it's a little bit of give-and
take. I'm able to relay some of my
knowledge as a quarterback to the
defensive backs, and at the same time,
I'm able to learn stuff I wasn't really
able to learn on the offensive side."

A long-time quarterback who
hasn't played defense since high
school coached by his father
David, the offensive coordinator at
Clover Park High in Washington, he
was inserted only to defend against
Hail Mary passes Pritchard was a
natural fit to work with the Cardinal
secondary.
"What's great is that you get to
know the ball through different
eyes," Tarver said. "Right now, he's
throwing deep balls to the DBs, but
he knows where the quarterback's
going to put it, so he's got knowledge
to teach them as to where the quar
terback's going to throw the ball. So
you see it from a different set, be
cause everybody comes into football
and sees it the way that they were
raised in it... it broadens your per
spective as a coach."

Who better to oversee
Pritchard's transition than Tarver?
He was a defensive back by training
who served in various defensive as
sistant roles at the college level from
1996-2000, worked on the 49ers' of
fensive staff for the four subsequent
seasons and then went back to the
defensive side of the ball, coaching
San Francisco's outside linebackers
between 2005 and 2010 before com
ing to Stanford this season.
And working with a Stanford
backfield that has its fair share of
players that started on offense,
Pritchard has run into some familiar
faces. Senior strong safety Delano
Howell took handoffs from

Pritchard in 2008 as a freshman run
ning back and caught nine passes for
94 yards that year.
"It didn't take him too long to
master the whole defense," Howell
said. "He puts time into it, he's very
passionate about everything he does
just like when he was a quarter
back ... He's put himself in a posi
tion where we can respect him, we
can look up to him; not only is he a
coach, but he's a friend as well."

Those sentiments are echoed em
phatically by Tarver.
"Tavita's doing great," he said.
"He's the best, he's already a great
coach and he's going to be whatever
he wants to be. He's that good."
But even though Pritchard seems
to have a knack for coaching, he's
not quite sure what he wants to do
next. He just hasn't had time to think
about it.

"Our goal is to play in the Rose
Bowl, and I can't see beyond that,"
Pritchard said. "The season, man, it is
a grind and it's a lot of fun hours up
in the office, but I can't see beyond
that. I'm coaching for now, I'm going
100 miles an hour and doing the best
I can, and we'll see when I come up

going to put it, so he's got knowledge
to teach them as to where the quar
terback's going to throw the ball. So
you see it from a different set, be
cause everybody comes into football
and sees it the way that they were
raised in it... it broadens your per
spective as a coach."

Who better to oversee
Pritchard's transition than Tarver?
He was a defensive back by training
who served in various defensive as
sistant roles at the college level from
1996-2000, worked on the 49ers' of
fensive staff for the four subsequent
seasons and then went back to the
defensive side of the ball, coaching
San Francisco's outside linebackers
between 2005 and 2010 before com
ing to Stanford this season.
And working with a Stanford
backfield that has its fair share of
players that started on offense,
Pritchard has run into some familiar
faces. Senior strong safety Delano
Howell took handoffs from

Pritchard in 2008 as a freshman run
ning back and caught nine passes for
94 yards that year.
"It didn't take him too long to
master the whole defense," Howell
said. "He puts time into it, he's very
passionate about everything he does
just like when he was a quarter
back ... He's put himself in a posi
tion where we can respect him, we
can look up to him; not only is he a
coach, but he's a friend as well."

Those sentiments are echoed em
phatically by Tarver.
"Tavita's doing great," he said.
"He's the best, he's already a great
coach and he's going to be whatever
he wants to be. He's that good."
But even though Pritchard seems
to have a knack for coaching, he's
not quite sure what he wants to do
next. He just hasn't had time to think
about it.

"Our goal is to play in the Rose
Bowl, and I can't see beyond that,"
Pritchard said. "The season, man, it is
a grind and it's a lot of fun hours up
in the office, but I can't see beyond
that. I'm coaching for now, I'm going
100 miles an hour and doing the best
I can, and we'll see when I come up
for air in the winter and in the spring.

We'll see what happens."
So this week, Pritchard has his
sights set back on USC (6-1,3-1 Pac
-12), which is unranked due to
NCAA sanctions but clearly one of
the top teams in the Pac-12. And
when No. 6 Stanford (7-0, 4-0) re
turns to the Coliseum for just the
second time since the Biggest Upset
Ever, it's bound to be favored over
the once-powerhouse Trojans for the
second consecutive year.
"We'll all look back on that game
with fond memories," Pritchard said
of that fateful night in 2007. "And I'm
great with that. I love being a part of
the Stanford community and being a
part of this football program, be
cause it's what we always wanted,
what you see now; us competing on a
national stage. It's what we all had
envisioned and we knew it wasn't
going to happen overnight. So if
that's a marker for the change in the
times here, great."
"And I'm proud to be a part of it,
for sure," he added. "However a
small part that I played, I'm very
proud of that."

In 2007, former Stanford quarterback Tavita Pritchard (above) led the Card
to an unlikely upset over then-No. 1 USC in Los Angeles. Four years later,
he is back on the Stanford sideline, although this time as a defensive coach.
He pulled off the greatest statistical
upset in college football history over
four years ago, became a significant
contributor to the turnaround of the
Stanford program and has already
spent a full season as a volunteer assistant for the
squad. But believe it or not, Tavita Pritchard still
has a lot to learn about football.
And he'll admit it as quickly as anybody.
That's because, despite having thrown for
2,865 yards and 15 touchdowns in 31 career ap
pearances wearing Cardinal, Pritchard has now
set his sights on defense.
"Right now I'm really just trying to be a
sponge and trying to be a student of the game,"
Pritchard said. "And it worked out staff-wise for
me to be able to be a defensive staff assistant, and
I jumped at the opportunity to be on this staff and
get to work with [Co-Defensive Coordinators]
Derek Mason and JasonTarver. It's a tremendous


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
opportunity for me to learn football
and defensive philosophy from
them."

"I'm just trying to take as much in
as I can, learn as much as I can, for
when I do coach down the road
be it on offense or defense I'll be
the best prepared that I can be," he
added.

Early returns indicate that
Pritchard is headed in the right di
rection.

"Well, we got lucky enough that
they were going to let us have Tavita,
number one, because he's excellent:
He has work ethic, he has intelli
gence and he's a Stanford guy so he's
got to be pretty smart," Tarver said.
"You tell him something, he gets it
done."

And as the Cardinal heads back
into the L. A. Coliseum this weekend
riding a two-game road winning
streak against USC, Stanford fans
will be remembering Oct. 6, 2007,
when Pritchard got something quite
memorable done.

Coming in as a 41-point under
dog against the No. 1 team in the
country and with then-backup
Pritchard making his first career
start in one of the largest stadiums in
college football, nobody was sur
prised when Stanford failed to score
an offensive touchdown in the first
three quarters. But the Cardinal
hung around behind a stifling defen
sive performance, and a 37-yard pass
to redshirt senior Mark Bradford to
the Trojan 1-yard line helped put
Stanford within just two points of
USC early in the fourth quarter.
After the Trojans added a touch
down and Stanford made a field goal
to make the score 23-17, an intercep
tion set the Cardinal up at the USC
45 with three minutes to play in the
half. Then the madness really began.
A pass-interference penalty moved
the ball up 15 yards. A botched half
back pass was salvaged by freshman
running back Jeremy Stewart, who
turned the play into a 4-yard gain. ("I
still give him a hard time for not
throwing me the ball," Pritchard said
of the current redshirt-senior.) A call
lost in translation between Pritchard
and head coach Jim Harbaugh on
fourth-and-20 turned into a tight
window pass for the first down on
a play chosen by Pritchard, no less.
And a perfect floater from the
then-sophomore found a leaping
Bradford in the end zone for the
game-winning touchdown, sending

the college football world into con
vulsions, ending the Trojans' title
hopes and reviving the spirits of the
downtrodden Stanford faithful.

All that, and Pritchard still does
n't own a "Biggest Upset Ever" t
shirt.

"I think somebody told me they
were going to give me one, but they
never followed through, so I've yet
to see that come to fruition," he
joked.

That doesn't mean Pritchard is
oblivious to the significance of "the
USC game," however.
"Absolutely, I'm very proud of
what my class and the classes above
and below me did," Pritchard said. "I
know that game really serves as a
marker, but it was just a manifesta
tion of a bigger change in this pro
gram ... Guys just saying, 'Hey, we
can be good at football. We can be
great at football here, if we just start
doing things right.'"
"So I'd say a lot of people look at
that game as a marker of this pro
gram righting the ship, but that's all it
really is: a marker," he added. "Be
cause the work is done out here on
the practice field, and in the build
ing."

And despite the historic win over
USC, Pritchard still had his work cut
out for him as a Stanford quarter
back. After sharing time with T.C.
Ostrander in 2007, Pritchard took
over the starting job the following
season and led the Cardinal within a
win of its first bowl game since 2001.
Even when his playing days seemed
to be shortened as a senior by the
emergence of one Andrew Luck,
Pritchard was called upon again on a
big stage when Luck broke his finger
before the Sun Bowl much like he
stepped in against USC after Os
trander had suffered a seizure less
than a week beforehand.
When the Cardinal fell short in a
tight 31-27 game, it looked as if
Pritchard's time on the Farm would
end on a losing note. But he had
something else in mind.
"I told [then-head coach Jim]
Harbaugh before the next season
that I wanted to get into coaching,
that I thought I owed it to myself to
at least try it out," Pritchard remem
bers. "And coach Harbaugh said,
'Great. Come on. I don't have any
staff positions open, but you can
come volunteer.' And I did every
thing from filling up coach Har
baugh's refrigerator with Diet Pepsi

to breaking down film."
Harbaugh moved on to coach the
San Francisco 49ers this season, but
Pritchard still has "fond memories"
of the man he cites as instrumental to
both his own development and the
Stanford program's.
And as the David Shaw era began
on the Farm, Pritchard reached a
turning point of his own. Taking up
his first-ever paid coaching position
on the defensive side of the ball, he
spent the offseason learning from
Tarver, Mason and perhaps just
as importantly the players.
"Now I'm starting to see the game
from the other side, how they actually
teach it and all the adjustments and
techniques they teach," Pritchard
said. "So it's a little bit of give-and
take. I'm able to relay some of my
knowledge as a quarterback to the
defensive backs, and at the same time,
I'm able to learn stuff I wasn't really
able to learn on the offensive side."

A long-time quarterback who
hasn't played defense since high
school coached by his father
David, the offensive coordinator at
Clover Park High in Washington, he
was inserted only to defend against
Hail Mary passes Pritchard was a
natural fit to work with the Cardinal
secondary.
"What's great is that you get to
know the ball through different
eyes," Tarver said. "Right now, he's
throwing deep balls to the DBs, but
he knows where the quarterback's
going to put it, so he's got knowledge
to teach them as to where the quar
terback's going to throw the ball. So
you see it from a different set, be
cause everybody comes into football
and sees it the way that they were
raised in it... it broadens your per
spective as a coach."
