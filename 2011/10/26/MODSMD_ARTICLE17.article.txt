# CARD SETTLES FOR 7TH
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After two straight days of
team scores below 300, the No. 2
men's golf team found itself in
great position at the Isleworth
Collegiate Invitational in Win
dermere, Fla. The Card was in
fourth place just behind LSU and
North Florida and within shout
ing distance of No. 1 Texas.
While Stanford slipped up
down the stretch on day three, ul
timately settling for seventh
place in one of the more compet
itive fields this fall, there were
plenty of bright spots and reasons
to believe that this year's Card
might have a shot at the pro
gram's ninth NCAA Champi
onship.
Much of the optimism stems
from Stanford's newest fresh
man phenom, Patrick Rodgers.
Playing in just his third colle
giate tournament, the Avon, Ind.
native made his third-straight
top-10, shooting an even-par 216
over 54 holes to finish in fourth
place.
Texas has a pretty good fresh
man of its own in Jordan Spieth,
who finished 32nd at the PGA
Tour's HP Byron Nelson Cham
pionship in May. He ran away
from the field last weekend to
win by eight strokes.

That could mean that the bat
tle for a title could potentially
come down to how the two fresh
men handle the pressure of post
season golf. But if this week's re
sults were any indication, the play
further down the ladder will be
just as important to the team title.
Stanford's top three players
all finished in the top 10, quite an
accomplishment in a stacked
field. Rodgers was fourth, junior
Andrew Yun (218, two-over par)
finished in a tie for sixth and
sophomore Cameron Wilson tied
for 10th with a four-under 220.
But the drop-off to the Cardi
nal's fourth scorer was steep
senior David Chung shot three
consecutive 79s to finish in 59th
place at 21 over par. And junior
Steve Kearney had a final round
82 to drop him into a tie for 68th
at +26.
The Longhorns, who won the
tournament by a whopping 26
strokes over second-place LSU,
had the top two scorers in Spieth
and Dylan Frittelli, but also had
two players finish in 20th and
42nd place, signaling that there is
definitely a chance for other
teams to go toe-to-toe if they can
string together three solid
rounds.
Both Chung and Kearney
have plenty of experience
Chung was a First Team All-Pac

10 selection as a sophomore and
Kearney performed well last sea
son at both the Pac-10 Champi
onships and NCAA Central Re
gional.

The Cardinal will need solid
performances from both if it
wants to challenge Texas for the
title and hold off challenges from
No. 3 Oregon, No. 7 California
and No. 10 Washington in the
conference chase.

Yun, too, could have done
even better than his final position
indicated. A final-round 76 cost
the 2011 PING First Team Ail-
American, who slipped from a tie
for second with Rodgers before
the round into sixth place. A dou
ble bogey on the par-four 14th
slowed his late charge after he

bogeyed two of the first four
holes and played the front-nine in
three over par.
If he can channel the energy
that saw him make five birdies
without a bogey on the back-nine
in round one, as well as an eagle
on the par-5 seventh hole, the
Cardinal can be a very dangerous
beast on the course, especially if
Wilson can continue a stellar
sophomore campaign.

The fall season continues for
Stanford on Monday, as the team
will play at The Gifford Colle
giate Championship at Corde-
Valle, right down the road in San
Martin, Calif.
