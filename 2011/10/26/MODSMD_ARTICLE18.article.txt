# WOMEN'S GOLF
## Holston Hills proves to be tough test 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Hie women's golf team came out
strong at last weekend's Stanford In
tercollegiate, shooting an opening
round 282 to hang with several of the
favorites at two under par. With the
Cardinal ranked just No. 43 in
Golfweek's collegiate rankings, the
impressive showing was a pleasant
surprise to many. But a tough day of
competition in the second round
sank Stanford's title hopes, and the
Card finished the tournament in 14th
place in the 18-team competition.
This weekend, the Mercedes-
Benz SEC/Pac-12 Challenge was a
little like deja vu, and Stanford fin
ished 18th out of 23 teams.

Freshman Mariko Tumangan
came out firing at pins all over the
course, making four birdies over her
last seven holes to overcome some
early slip-ups and finishing the round
with a two-under-par 70. That left her
tied for fourth place, just two strokes
behind the co-leaders.

And junior Sally Watson who
won the Cougar Invitational in Stan
ford's first event of the season last
month had a very solid round of
even-par 72, which left her in a tie for
15th at the end of the first day.
But the rest of the team struggled
a bit at the Holston Hills Country
Club in Knoxville, Tenn. Junior
Kristina Wong and sophomore
Danielle Frasier shot matching 78's
although Frasier was competing
as an individual playing the back
nine in a combined nine over par.

Junior Marissa Mar and senior
Lila Barton also had their share of
troubles, with Mar shooting an 82
and Barton an 80. Mar unfortunately
ran into big-time trouble at the par-3
14th. The Sacramento native settled
for an 11 on the hole, taking a big
chunk out of the Card's day with
out that one hole, Stanford would
have been in third place.
Watson said that the whole group
couldn't quite ever get their game to
gether.

"I think as a team we struggled,"
she said. "I think we put too much
pressure on ourselves and just need
to trust in our ability and relax. We
are, however, gaining a lot of valuable
experience right now, which is going
to serve us well in the spring. We
know what we need to work on this
winter to be successful, and I fully be
lieve that come spring we are going
to be ready to compete with the best
in the country."
The teams up-and-down play con
tinued on day two, as Tumangan took
a triple-bogey halfway through her
round and couldn't quite bounce
back, shooting a 77. Watson also could
n't capitalize on her first-round suc
cess, carding a 78 that saw her bogey
four straight holes on the back nine.
"My putting was really good the
first and last day," Watson said, "but
unfortunately on the second day I
made a few mental errors and missed

four or five putts in a row from inside
seven feet. Had I just converted a few
of them my score would have been a
lot better."

Like many of her teammates, she
did indeed bounce back in the third
round, shooting a one-over 73 that
left her in 39th place. And save for a
lone double-bogey, Tumangan
showed why she has impressed
many, including her teammates, in
her short time on the Farm the
San Jose native shot a final-round 74
to tie for 30th overall.

"Mariko is doing a great job as a
freshman," Watson said. "She is play
ing great and doing a good job bal
ancing all of the traveling with school.
I believe she is going to be a key fac
tor in our team's success this year."

With Barton, Wong, Mar and
Frasier all finishing at least 14 over
par with Mar and Barton at +2l
and +29, respectively the whole
team is struggling with its consisten
cy on the course. If Stanford hopes to
compete for its first conference title
since 1999 this spring and it does
appear to have the talent necessary
to take a shot at favorite UCLA it
will need to find a solution to the in
consistencies.

The Cardinal will take another
crack at a tournament crown next
Tuesday and Wednesday at the Kent
Youel Invitational in Kapolei,
Hawaii.
