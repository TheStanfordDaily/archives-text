## Google co-founders support Stanford's NYC bid 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
Google co-founders Larry Page
M.S. '9B and Sergey Brin M.S. '95 pub
licly supported Stanford's bid for a
New York City (NYC) applied sci
ence campus on Tuesday in an online
video posted on a new University
tumblr site.
The announcement comes as
Stanford is preparing to submit its for
mal proposal to the New York City
Economic Development Corpora
tion (NYCEDC) committee on Fri
day, the deadline for universities to re
spond to Mayor Michael
Bloomberg's request for proposals to
create an applied-sciences center for
teaching and research.
"I think this is a pretty great oppor
tunity for both the city as well as for
Stanford University to broaden its
horizon," Brin said.
The video, titled "Stanford's Tradi
tion of Innovation," lasts three and a
half minutes, and does not mention the
NYC campus until the last 30 seconds.
During the rest of video, Page and Brin
discuss starting Google at Stanford
and the University's reputation for
being a launching ground for major
technology companies.
"I think Stanford is a really unique
place," Page said in the video. "Look
ing at Hewlett-Packard, Sun-Mi
crosystems, Cisco, Yahoo, Excite, it's re
ally bred an enormous number of very
important companies in the technolo

gy world. And I don't think it's an acci
dent. I think there's a culture of entre
preneurship at Stanford on a scale I
haven't seen elsewhere."

Brin then said while he "love[s]
New York," he feels "one of the things
that it is missing is this top-notch uni
versity-industry symbiosis."

"I don't think I've seen this same
kind of scale in research and commer
cialization, pretty much anywhere out
side of Stanford," he continued.
Last Tuesday, Cornell University
announced a partnership with Tech
nion-Israel Institute of Technology to
submit a dual proposal for a NYC ap
plied science campus, causing many in
the media to peg Cornell's bid as Stan
ford's top rival.
NYCEDC expects to announce a
decision by the end of the calendar
year.
