# Report critiques Union
## Working group set to examine student space 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
The ASSU and the Office of the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs (VPSA) are forming a work
ing group to review use of the Old Union complex
following a preliminary report that stated Old
Union is not serving the Stanford community to
its full potential.
The working group, which is still forming, will
include VPSA administrators, ASSU leadership
and interested students who will join through an
application process, according to ASSU Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3. The
group will spend fall quarter researching and
hopes to implement changes starting winter quar
ter, he said.
"We're not trying to make [the working group]
too big because we want to be effective and get
things done," student space researcher Aaron
Konigsberg 'l4 said.
Wellness Room repurposed
One space that has already been repurposed is
the Wellness Room. The first floor room in Old
Union, which used to boast relaxation and art re
sources, now matches any other student study
room in the complex, with standard Old Union
couches.
Konigsberg said Jeanette Smith-Laws, director
of operations and students unions, decided it
would be best to incorporate wellness into all as
pects of Old Union as opposed to dedicating a
room to the theme.

The Wellness Room was initially created by
ASSU Executives Johnny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan
Harris 'O9 in February 2009, with strong support
by former ASSU President Angelina Cardona
'll. Cardona was ASSU Mental Health Chair at
the time the space was created.
The Wellness Room faced criticism through
out its existence about its level of use and ability
to cater to the entire student body.

Student space report recommends website, pro
gramming
The student space report, which was commis
sioned by the ASSU and released to the student
body over the summer, was a condensed version
of a several hundred-page report that Konigsberg
wrote over three weeks. Konigsberg said he was

financially compensated for his
work.
The ASSU initially advertised
the student space position as includ
ing a $1,250 stipend and consisting
of 80 hours of work. Konigsberg said
the position ended up requiring
more work than expected
around 100 to 120 hours in total
and he was additionally compensat
ed for this time.
The report made four recommen
dations for the Old Union complex
which consists of Old Union, the
Nitery and the Clubhouse to es
tablish the Union as a hub of campus
life. The four recommendations are
to create a website unifying online
resources related to student life, bet
ter utilize the existing space, host
original programming to give Old
Union a "personality" and market
the Union to the student body.
The report included results of a
survey administered to Stanford stu
dents last year. According to the re
port, Old Union received a score of
5/5 in "Variety," 3/5 in "Usefulness,"
4/5 in "Availability," 3/5 in "Utiliza
tion," 2/5 in "Desirability," 1/5 in
"Online Presence" and 3/5 in "Com
munity Feel."
Konigsberg said the lowest score,
Online Presence, could be attributed
to the multitude of student-aimed
web pages, such as the activity calen
dar and the room reservation sys
tem. Web pages are also separate
among the ASSU, the CoFIo and the
Axe and Palm, which operate sepa
rately.

"If the Old Union is to be the cen
ter of campus life and activity, the
Old Union website has to support
this claim," Konigsberg wrote in the
report. "In its current state, there is
simply no way that the Old Union
can promote the type of events that
the Old Union will have to host if it
wants to be successful. There has to
be a redesign."
Konigsberg said he researched
student unions at other universities
while compiling the report, consider
ing at three main factors: personality
of each university, school location
and the average distance of dorms
from the student union. He said he
interviewed the directors of student
life or student unions at all of the
schools he researched.

"Each [of the universities' stu
dent unions] had a really unique fea
ture about it that made it great,"

Konigsberg said. "At Princeton, the
union is really specifically tailored to
the community and serves the com
munity well. The [University of]
Maryland student union was exem
plary at marketing to students."
The report also asked students
what first came to mind when they
thought of Old Union, Konigsberg
said. According to the report, 51 per
cent of responding students selected
"The Axe and Palm," 42 percent se
lected "A place to do group work," 3
percent selected "A quiet place to
study" and 4 percent selected "None
of the above."

When asked which changes would
make Old Union more appealing, 55
percent of respondents requested
more dining options, 46.9 percent
wanted more spaces to work individ
ually, 45.6 percent requested longer
hours, 35.7 percent of respondents
asked for more spaces to work with a
group, 35.4 percent desired a more re
laxed and lounge focused atmos
phere and 24.5 percent requested a
more upbeat and lively atmosphere.
"I'd like us to come up with a plan
for how we'd like each room in the
facilities to be used and make
changes that reflect that and come
up with programming that allows us
to make those changes," Macgregor-
Dennis said.

According to Konigsberg, one op
tion that would help Old Union bet
ter serve Stanford students as a cam

pus hub would be renovating the first
floor into a place where students
could interact with each other and
watch away football games, com
pared to one current use of the area
as a space to study.

While the second floor of Old
Union will likely remain as is, the
question of how to allocate the re
maining space to students and
whether or not to allow certain
groups to inhabit some rooms per
manentlyâ€” is up for discussion,
Konigsberg said.

"We have to strike that delicate
balance between giving resources to
everyone and honoring groups who
have shown that they do use the
space well," Konigsberg said.
Even with the prospect of a re
vamped space, Old Union faces the
challenge of drawing students to the
building, Konigsberg said. The stu
dent space report cited program
ming as a key component of reform
ing Old Union's image. There is cur
rently no formal system of events
programming at Old Union.
"[The programming] shouldn't
be events planned by old people for
young people," Konigsberg said. "It
should be events that I personally
would be excited to go to. [Old
Union] shouldn't be a building; it
should be a destination."
