# Report critiques Union
## Working group set to examine student space 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
The ASSU and the Office of the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs (VPSA) are forming a work
ing group to review use of the Old Union complex
following a preliminary report that stated Old
Union is not serving the Stanford community to
its full potential.
The working group, which is still forming, will
include VPSA administrators, ASSU leadership
and interested students who will join through an
application process, according to ASSU Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3. The
group will spend fall quarter researching and
hopes to implement changes starting winter quar
ter, he said.
"We're not trying to make [the working group]
too big because we want to be effective and get
things done," student space researcher Aaron
Konigsberg 'l4 said.
Wellness Room repurposed
One space that has already been repurposed is
the Wellness Room. The first floor room in Old
Union, which used to boast relaxation and art re
sources, now matches any other student study
room in the complex, with standard Old Union
couches.
Konigsberg said Jeanette Smith-Laws, director
of operations and students unions, decided it
would be best to incorporate wellness into all as
pects of Old Union as opposed to dedicating a
room to the theme.

The Wellness Room was initially created by
ASSU Executives Johnny Dorsey 'O9 and Fagan
Harris 'O9 in February 2009, with strong support
by former ASSU President Angelina Cardona
'll. Cardona was ASSU Mental Health Chair at
the time the space was created.
The Wellness Room faced criticism through
out its existence about its level of use and ability
to cater to the entire student body.
