### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
John McCarthy, professor emeritus
in computer science and founder of the
Stanford Artificial Intelligence Labo
ratory (SAIL), died on Monday in his
Stanford home, according to a Univer
sity statement. He was 84.
Whitfield Diffie, a researcher at
SAIL, told the New York Times that
"no one is more influential" than Mc-
Carthy in the field of artificial intelli
gence.
In fact, McCarthy has even been
credited for the first use of the term "ar
tificial intelligence" in print when it ap-

peared in a proposal he had written in
1956 for a summer research confer
ence while teaching mathematics at
Dartmouth.

From there, he would go on to be
come a leader in the area of computer
science moving to the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology (MIT) in
1958, creating the world's second-old
est computer programming language,
LISP, that same year and developing
garage collectors, away to automatical
ly remove superfluous lines of code
from a computer's random access
memory, in 1959.
While McCarthy briefly served as
an assistant professor at Stanford in
1953, he made the Farm his perma
nent home when he returned in 1962.
Two years later, he founded SAIL,
which was funded in part by the Pen
tagon. Scientists have yet to accom
plish the lab's initial goal to build a
functional artificial intelligence sys
tem in 10 years but the lab has
been responsible for advancements
in robotics, computer vision and nat
ural language.
McCarthy was recognized for his
contributions to computer science,
having been awarded the A.M. Turn
ing Award in 1971, the Kyoto Prize in
1988 and the National Medal of Sci
ence in 1990.
He retired from Stanford in 2001.
"He could be blunt, but John was al
ways kind and generous with his time,
especially with students. And he was
sharp until the end," Edward Feigen
baum, professor emeritus of computer
science, told the Stanford Report. "He
was always focused on the future. Al
ways inventing, inventing, inventing.
That was John."
