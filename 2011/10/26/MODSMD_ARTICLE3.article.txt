### ERIN INMAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Michael Posner, Assistant Secretary of State for
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, spoke Tues
day night at the Schwab Residential Center about
the Obama administration's approach to democra
cy and human rights.
Stanford in Government (SIG) and the Free
man Spogli Institute's Center on Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) co
sponsored the talk.
The Obama administration has a "principled
engagement" in the world, Posner said, implying
that human rights issues are incorporated into con
versations involving international interests.
"We are going to be there. We are going to en
gage," Posner said. "But we're going to ensure that
human rights are part of that equation."

On a macro level, the administration seeks to
engage with multilateral institutions such as the
United Nations (U.N.) Human Rights Council,
Posner said. On a micro level, it seeks to support de
velopment projects where human rights issues are
inherent.

Three common themes for development proj
ects include the need for economic empowerment,
political participation and building opportunities,
Posner said. He added that a human rights-orient
ed approach to development gives recipients a
stake in the projects, ensures transparency and pro
motes the strengthening of effective democratic
and rights-based institutions such as open courts
or the police system.
Posner cited Internet freedom as a necessity to
ensuring international human rights. The Internet
open, neutral and capable of traversing borders

serves as a platform for commerce, education,
innovation and political discussion, according to
Posner; it supports freedom of speech, association
and assembly.
Continuing to focus on civil society, Posner said
human rights organizations should be able to oper
ate outside of current constraints, including the
ability to organize or receive foreign funding.
According to Posner, it is important to target
civilians instead of governments because, as he said,
change does not come from the outside,
"Change occurs within societies when people
see their own destiny and power for change," Pos
ner said. "Tempting as it is to think that we [the
United States] can force change, what we really can
do is reinforce peoples best aspirations, amplify
their voices and support them."
While the United States may not force change, it
often inspires it, according to Posner.
"We are going to lead by example universal
standards apply to all, including ourselves," he said.
"The power of the idea of human rights and
democracy, the power of the United States' exam-

resonates around the world," he
added. "It's amazing and reassuring
how much people aspire to the kinds
of freedom and openness that we
take for granted."
Although Americans may take
domestic human rights for granted,
the U.S. government still has yet to
ratify these rights in an international
setting, Posner said. One such exam
ple is the U.N. Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Dis
crimination Against Women
(CEDAW), which was adopted by
the U.N. in 1979.

Posner said CEDAW is still a pri
ority of the administration, but lacks
Senate support for possible ratifica
tion.

"The administration is ready to
go," Posner said. "But we have work
to do in domestic politics [to get it
passed]."
SIG was eager to co-sponsor the
event, according to one of the organi
zation's members, Patrick Kennedy
'l3.

"Stanford students are well-con
nected with current events, so SIG
was eager to have representatives
from government who are fighting
political issues from the trenches, in
addition to our academic faculty,"
Kennedy said.
