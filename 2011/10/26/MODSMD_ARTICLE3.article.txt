Michael Posner, Assistant Secretary of State for
Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, spoke Tues
day night at the Schwab Residential Center about
the Obama administration's approach to democra
cy and human rights.
Stanford in Government (SIG) and the Free
man Spogli Institute's Center on Democracy, De
velopment and the Rule of Law (CDDRL) co
sponsored the talk.
The Obama administration has a "principled
engagement" in the world, Posner said, implying
that human rights issues are incorporated into con
versations involving international interests.
"We are going to be there. We are going to en
gage," Posner said. "But we're going to ensure that
human rights are part of that equation."

On a macro level, the administration seeks to
engage with multilateral institutions such as the
United Nations (U.N.) Human Rights Council,
Posner said. On a micro level, it seeks to support de
velopment projects where human rights issues are
inherent.

Three common themes for development proj

political participation and building opportunities,
Posner said. He added that a human rights-orient

stake in the projects, ensures transparency and pro
motes the strengthening of effective democratic
and rights-based institutions such as open courts
or the police system.
Posner cited Internet freedom as a necessity to
ensuring international human rights. The Internet
open, neutral and capable of traversing borders

serves as a platform for commerce, education,
innovation and political discussion, according to
Posner; it supports freedom of speech, association
and assembly.
Continuing to focus on civil society, Posner said
human rights organizations should be able to oper
ate outside of current constraints, including the
ability to organize or receive foreign funding.
According to Posner, it is important to target
civilians instead of governments because, as he said,
change does not come from the outside,
"Change occurs within societies when people
see their own destiny and power for change," Pos
ner said. "Tempting as it is to think that we [the
United States] can force change, what we really can
do is reinforce peoples best aspirations, amplify
their voices and support them."
While the United States may not force change, it
often inspires it, according to Posner.
"We are going to lead by example universal
standards apply to all, including ourselves," he said.
"The power of the idea of human rights and
democracy, the power of the United States' exam-
