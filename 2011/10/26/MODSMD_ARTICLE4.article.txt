## ASSU increases discretionary spending 
### JAMES LANCASTER 
The ASSU recently approved its
budget for the 2011-2012 academic year,
with major changes occurring in its ap
propriations for discretionary funding.
Presidential discretionary spending rose
by 31 percent and Graduate Student
Council (GSC) discretionary spending
swelled by 83 percent under the new
budget.
Drafted by the ASSU Executive team
and financial managers, this year's budg
et included a shift from line item appro
priations funding pre-appropriated
for specific ASSU initiatives to gener
al discretionary spending, which can be
spent on any ASSU project. ASSU Vice
President Stewart Macgregor-Den
nis 'l3 said that these changes were
implemented to allow the ASSU
greater flexibility in meeting the
needs of the student body.

"I think that the increase comes
from the realization that it's incred
ibly hard to predict the exact line
items that will be needed in the next
year," Macgregor-Dennis said.
"People realize that there needs to
be flexibility in the budget for
ASSU leadership teams to imple
ment their initiatives, and discre
tionary funding allows us that flexi
bility."

A number of line items from last
year's budget were consolidated
into general discretionary spending
in order to emphasize flexibility, ac
cording to GSC Chair Aaditya Sati
ja, a graduate student in electrical
engineering and energy resources
engineering. Satija said this shift
represents a more efficient and
strategic use of ASSU funding.
"We merged advertising, com
munications and public relations
line items into discretionary spend
ing, as these expenses can be diffi
cult to predict ahead of time," Sati
ja said. "With a greater flexibility in
the way we spend funds, we can en
sure that the budget meets the
evolving needs of the Stanford stu
dent body."
Responding to concerns about
the potential for misuse of unallo
cated funds, both Macgregor-Den
nis and Satija said that there are nu
merous safeguards to prevent inap
propriate spending.
"The key to addressing these
concerns is total transparency,"
Macgregor-Dennis said. "Sure,
we're obligated by the Constitution
to release our quarterly spending
reports, but we're going above and
beyond that to involve the student
body. Before we spend discre
tionary funds, we're telling you
about it, and after we spend it, we're

telling you about the value of that
money spent and whether it was a
good use."
Satija also noted the importance
of transparent spending, stressing
the value of ASSU financial analyt
ics and publicly available spending
reports.

"Our financial manager audits
ASSU spending, providing detailed
analysis of where funds went and
why they were spent," Satija said.
"This independent review is a pow
erful check on discretionary fund
ing because we get a detailed
breakdown of ASSU spending."
Macgregor-Dennis was also op
timistic about the potential of the
Division of Internal Review (DIR)
to ensure efficient spending and ad
dress student concerns. Unani
mously passed last Tuesday, the bill
establishing the DIR called for the
creation of an independent body to
evaluate spending on ASSU Exec
utive and Senate initiatives, in addi
tion to monitoring other groups
that receive ASSU funding.
"I think it's going to be unbeliev
ably effective," Macgregor-Dennis
said of the DIR. "It's clearly going to
be a great asset to the ASSU, as it
will allow us to understand which
initiatives add value and enable us to
quantify their impact."
According to Macgregor-Den
nis, the passage of the DIR, ASSU
financial auditing and open com
munication with the student body
are all key in ensuring the proper
spending of discretionary spending.
He said many of these initiatives
are directly aligned with the goals
of the 2011-2012 ASSU Executive
team.

"One of our primary objectives
this year is transparency," Macgre
gor-Dennis said. "We want students
actively involved in student govern
ment, and the budget is no excep
tion. We're optimistic about our
ability to have a big impact, and the
active review and evaluation of dis
cretionary funding allows us to bol
ster that goal."
