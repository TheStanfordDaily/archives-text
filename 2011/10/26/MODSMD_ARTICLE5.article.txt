## Applications to GSB dip 8.13 percent Decrease seen at other top business schools 
### SANDY HUANG 
Application numbers decreased
this year for most of the top business
schools in the country, including
Stanford's Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB), which saw its application
volume decrease by 8.13 percent dur
ing the most recent application cycle.

Peer schools such as the Universi
ty of Chicago Booth School of Busi
ness and Harvard Business School
also experienced drops in applica
tions, according to data presented by
Bloomberg Businessweek. The re
port found that Stanford experi
enced the largest drop among top 10
business schools.
"We're down from a kind of all
time high," said Derrick Bolton, as
sistant dean and director of MBA
Admissions at the Stanford GSB.
"The context is important."

Bolton said a look at the last 10
years reveals that, unlike undergrad
uate applications, business school ap
plications have historically gone
through cycles of growth and decline.
In 2002, the number of GSB applica
tions was 5,864. In 2005, the figure
dropped to 4,582.
The most competitive years for
those applying to the GSB were in
2009 and 2010 when applications
reached 7,536 and 7,204 respectively,
according to Bolton. Despite the
drop from last year, this year was still
the third most competitive year in
the past 10 the GSB received
6,618 applications.
"To me, there's kind of a national
ebb and flow to the admissions
cycle," Bolton said.
He said when applications to busi
ness school rise, admission rates con
currently decrease, often deterring
potential candidates from applying
the following year because they per
ceive minimal chance of success. Ac
cording to Bolton, the result is that
application numbers fall the next
time around, and admission rates
eventually go back up, encouraging
people to apply again.
Bolton said the GSB's highly se
lective admissions process also af
fects this cycle in application volume.
Last year, the GSB had an admit rate
of 6.8 percent well below that of
peer schools, partly due to the GSB's
small class size.

"Selectivity is a dual-edged sword
in that it gives you the luxury of se
lecting a class, but it does have the un
intended effect of scaring away some
highly talented applicants that
should be considering the program
that maybe get a little daunted by the
admissions rate," he said.
According to Bolton, there has
not been a strong correlation be
tween application numbers and the
current economic climate.
"You often hear people say, 'Oh
it's the economy,'" Bolton said. "I
don't believe this... People apply to
business school when the economy is
bad."

Bolton added that there were
better indicators to explain why ap
plication numbers fluctuate.
"Applications correlate better
with census data than with economic
data," he said.
Over the last few years, there
have been population decreases in
areas of the United States and
abroad where the GSB has typically
seen large numbers of applicants in
the past, according to Bolton.

Business schools do not like to
compare their numbers of applicants
to other kinds of professional
schools like medical and law schools,
Bolton said. He said business schools
should be judged separately since no
degree is required to enter the field

of business unlike medicine and
law.
According to Bolton, the recent
drop in applications does not con
cern the GSB.
"It's not a very important metric
in the grand scheme of things,"
Bolton said. "So when applications
are up, that's fine. When applications
are down, that's fine."
"My real concern is what's the
quality of the class," he said. "As long
as we have 396 really bright, really
energized, really thoughtful, really
committed students, then we feel
good."
He said that a success of an appli
cation cycle for the GSB does not
rely solely on what he called "fluctu
ating numbers" like application vol
ume.
"We don't define success based
on number of applications," Bolton
said. "We define success based on the
quality of the class, and then later, the
impact the students have once they
go out into the world."
