## Pay Pal founder Peter Thiel speaks to innovation at BASES kickoff 
### ISAAC GATENO 
Speaking Tuesday evening at The
Business Association of Stanford En
trepreneurial Students (BASES) kick
off event for this year, entrepreneur
and venture capitalist Peter Thiel B.A.
'B9 JD '92 compared video games to
pharmaceuticals and referred to the
higher education system as "the only
bubble that's left."

"If video games were held to the
same standards as drugs," the founder
of Pay Pal said, referring to the rigorous

clinical trials required for FDA ap
proval of pharmaceuticals, "we would
have no video games."
The theme of Monday evening's dis
cussion was, "Has innovation stalled?"
Thiel, an early angel investor in
Facebook, also spoke at last year's
BASES event once before, last year's
kickoff.
This time around, the organization
aimed to make the event more interac
tive, said BASES co-president Charles
Naut 'l2.
The student group structured
the talk as a debate and crowd
sourced the panel. In the weeks
leading up to the event, attendees
had the opportunity to post their
questions to Thiel online. From
those who submitted questions,
three panelists were selected to
meet TTiiel personally and join him
onstage for a debate moderated by
Naut.
The topics discussed by the
panel included the slowing pace of
innovation, the role of traditional
education and the fostering of inno
vation in the developing world.
Thiel is known for often presenting
controversial ideas relating to these
topics.

Thiel's comment on the educa
tion "bubble" was inspired his ob
servations of tuition prices spiraling
out of control and a pervasive social
pressure to funnel children through
the credentialing process of tradi
tional higher education.
When asked what he thought
education might look like after the
bubble breaks, he said that it will
"become less important. [People
will realize] maybe they didn't need
quite as much as they thought."
Thiel, a fervent libertarian, also

spoke about how the most regulat
ed industries aerospace, agricul
ture and pharmacology have
seen the least innovation, while the
unregulated Internet has been
booming.

Thiel left the audience with a
parting message: "Humans can
think about and affect the future."

He encouraged attendees to
stop thinking about where they will
be in the next six months to three
years. Instead, he encouraged the
audience to think 30 to 60 years
ahead and beyond.
Comparing this year's event to
last year's, Naut said audience
members were more familiar with
Thiel. They were "more used to his
ideas," he said.
Naut said the unconventionality
of Thiel's ideas led BASES to bring
the speaker back for a second
round.

With this event, the BASES cal
endar is officially under way for the
school year. Other BASES events
for the year will include the weekly
Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders
(ETL) speaker series, a collabora
tion with the Stanford Technology
Ventures Program (STVP) that has
in the past brought the likes of Jack
Dorsey and Aneesh Chopra to
campus and Y Combinator Startup
School, a one day seminar aimed at
encouraging potential founders.
