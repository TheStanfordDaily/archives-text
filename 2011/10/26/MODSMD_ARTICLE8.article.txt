## TREND Student Billboards 
### NICOLE KOFMAN 
Stanford's campus is a place
for many activities: learning,
socializing, partying and
advertising? Companies
ranging from small startups
to industry leaders employ student
brand ambassadors to promote their
brands on campus, whether this
means wearing their brand's t-shirt,
handing out free products or organiz
ing events on campus.
Ashley Lyle 'l3 is one of two
brand ambassadors for Victoria's Se
cret's sub-brand, PINK.
"What was very appealing to me
about PINK was that the brand was
n't only promoting clothes and lin
gerie, but it was promoting a
lifestyle," Lyle said. "Their marketing
efforts are all about getting people
excited about PINK and creating this
'PINK girl': Who is she? What does
she do? Where are the places that she
goes to?"
As a campus representative, one of
her main responsibilities is to wear the
free clothes that she receives around
campus. Lyle was flown to the Victo

ria's Secret headquarters for training
by the company.
"They gave us four or five outfits,
pretty expensive outfits. They were
just handing us stuff," Lyle said. "We
personally get a lot of stuff because of
course you want to be promoting
PINK all the time."
Lyle, however, isn't the only stu
dent who benefits from her PINK
ambassadorship at Stanford. Earlier
this year, she helped the sorority
Alpha Epsilon Phi work with Victo
ria's Secret PINK to put on a Zumba
event and raffle off PINK attire,
where she gave away pieces of eight
yoga outfits. Winners of the grand
prize received full yoga outfits. She
also gives away make up bags, pens
and fake tattoos to promote the
brand.
Pedro Gardete, marketing profes
sor at the Graduate School of Busi
ness (GSB), cited several reasons
why companies would like to target
universities like Stanford.
"Colleges have concentrations of
people of a certain demographic, so if
you want to target them ... you have
this campus [where] it's easy to do
that," he said. "If you're trying to

make some impact in the market, you
can get consumers to get used to your
brand early so that you can have fu
ture benefits."
Gardete noted that although
many students don't have personal
incomes, companies rely on the par
ents giving their college-age students
disposable income.
"We see the embodiment of the
brand in the person, and the person
shares a lot of the same characteris
tics as the rest of the students,"
Gardete said. "They're the same age,
at the same campus... so what the
person says about a brand will be
much more credible than if it were
coming from a stranger."
KianTorabian 'l3,brand ambassa
dor for startup car-sharing company
Wheelz, tries to lend his brand that
credibility, in return for gaining the
work experience.
When Torabian found out about
Wheelz, he contacted the company to
ask if they needed a brand ambassador,
which he committed in exchange for
guidance on designing websites and
learning the programming language.
