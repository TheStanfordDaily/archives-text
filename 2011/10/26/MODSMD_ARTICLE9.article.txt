# Philosophy of a prize-winning procrastinator
## PROFILE 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
Joining the elite company of the
mayor of Vilnius, Lithuania
(who rolled a tank over a
parked car in an attempt to
deter illegal parking) and a
group of doomsday forecasters (who
have all incorrectly predicted the end
of the world), professor emeritus of

philosophy John Perry was awarded
a 2011 Ig Nobel Prize.
"Well it's about as prestigious as a
Nobel Prize, but much rarer," Perry
joked. "It's just like the Nobel Prize
except the cash isn't quite as much
as a matter of fact, it's zero."

Perry won the award for an essay
published 15 years ago titled, "How
to Procrastinate and Still Get Things
Done." The essay explains how pro
crastinators can exploit their pro
crastinating tendencies, delaying

seemingly more important tasks by
doing less important ones, to make
themselves "effective human beings,
respected and admired for all that
they can accomplish and the good
use they make of time."
"For some reason the essay seems
to have been liked by a lot of people,
many of whom write me every week
and say it has helped them," Perry
said. "I didn't write it to help people,
I just wrote it to get through a dark
and depressing afternoon when I was

down about being a procrastinator ..
. so that's nice that people like it."
While the Ig Nobel Prize is Perry's
latest claim to fame, Perry is well
known in philosophy circles as an in
fluential, widely published author. He
has published over 100 books and arti
cles on topics ranging from philosophy
of language to philosophy of mind to
metaphysics. His work is so well re
spected that in 2007, other authors
