# Philosophy of a prize-winning procrastinator
## PROFILE 
### AUSTIN BLOCK 
Joining the elite company of the
mayor of Vilnius, Lithuania
(who rolled a tank over a
parked car in an attempt to
deter illegal parking) and a
group of doomsday forecasters (who
have all incorrectly predicted the end
of the world), professor emeritus of

philosophy John Perry was awarded
a 2011 Ig Nobel Prize.
"Well it's about as prestigious as a
Nobel Prize, but much rarer," Perry
joked. "It's just like the Nobel Prize
except the cash isn't quite as much
as a matter of fact, it's zero."

Perry won the award for an essay
published 15 years ago titled, "How
to Procrastinate and Still Get Things
Done." The essay explains how pro
crastinators can exploit their pro
crastinating tendencies, delaying

seemingly more important tasks by
doing less important ones, to make
themselves "effective human beings,
respected and admired for all that
they can accomplish and the good
use they make of time."
"For some reason the essay seems
to have been liked by a lot of people,
many of whom write me every week
and say it has helped them," Perry
said. "I didn't write it to help people,
I just wrote it to get through a dark
and depressing afternoon when I was

down about being a procrastinator ..
. so that's nice that people like it."
While the Ig Nobel Prize is Perry's
latest claim to fame, Perry is well
known in philosophy circles as an in
fluential, widely published author. He
has published over 100 books and arti
cles on topics ranging from philosophy
of language to philosophy of mind to
metaphysics. His work is so well re
spected that in 2007, other authors

published a compilation of essays
about his work.

In the introduction to the book,
"Situating Semantics: Essays on the
Philosophy of John Perry," the edi
tors praise Perry as one of the few
modern philosophers who has
bridged the gap between the mod
ern approach to philosophy, which
emphasizes highly specialized
study over "larger syntheses" of
ideas into a unified worldview, and
the broader approach to philoso
phy used by philosophers like Im
manuel Kant, John Locke and Mar
tin Heidegger.
After 37 years of teaching at
Stanford, Perry recently retired,
but he is still working on several
projects and plans to keep an office
at the Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information (CSLI). He
co-wrote a book about the philoso
phy of language, entitled "Critical
Pragmatics: An Inquiry into Refer
ence and Communication," which
was published in September. He is
now working on a book in which he
argues that freedom and determin
ism are compatible.
"If the laws of nature say if you
have a strong desire to do some
thing and can't see any reason not
to do it, you will probably do it.
Does that mean you didn't do it

freely? That's what the book will be
about," he said.
Additionally, Perry is preparing
the second edition of his book "Ref
erence and Reflexivity" for publica
tion and researching the properties
of questions with linguist Daniel
Flickinger Ph.D. 'BB. Fie plans to
teach weekly graduate seminars at
UC-Riverside in the winter and
spring and continues to co-host
"Philosophy Talk," a radio show in
which he and fellow philosophy pro
fessor Kenneth Taylor discuss a
wide array of philosophical issues.
"We've discussed free will, Con
fucius, Buddha, Plato, Descartes,
skepticism, the existence of God
everything," Perry said. "We're
working on a show . . . called
'Thinking Inside the Box' which is
to try to discover if there's anything
philosophically interesting on tele
vision ... so far we're looking at
House, Terra Nova ... that's a lot
of fun and we really appreciate
Stanford for supporting our en
deavor to do it."

As extensive as Perry's philo
sophical work is, his participation in
the Stanford community has gone
and continues to go beyond his pa
pers and books. Perry was a resi
dent fellow in the Wilbur dorm
Soto in the late 1980s and early 90s.

He served on a freshman education
committee in the late 1970s that
started the Western Cultures pro
gram, a precursor to the Introduc
tion to the Humanities (IHUM)
program. He encouraged senior re
search scholar Edward Zalta to
take on a project that became the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philoso
phy, and he continues to advise
graduate students. He has also
served as director of CSLI and
chair of the philosophy depart
ment.

"Probably people have told you
that Perry is really entertaining,
he's really funny ... but also on the
other side he's a really serious and
dedicated teacher and advisor,"
said Wes Holliday, a fifth year Ph.D.
student who took many of Perry's
classes and was his undergraduate
thesis advisee. "He'll read your
work in full, give really thoughtful
comments, be really supportive and
encouraging even if you're arguing
against his views."
Holliday also praised Perry for
the way his views on individual
philosophical subjects fit together
into a comprehensive general phi
losophy that complements the find
ings of science. He said "Situating
Semantics" explains the way
Perry's philosophy forms into a co

ordinated whole.
"[The book's essays] describe in
some broad way this idea that Perry
has talked about all these different
philosophical issues, but his views
fit together," Holliday said. "He's
trying to make sense of these con
cepts like consciousness, free will
[and] identity, in away that jives
with what science tells us."
Associate professor of philoso
phy R. Lanier Anderson called
Perry a leader in the philosophy de
partment, praising his "amazing tal
ent for bringing philosophical ways
of thinking to the wider public."
Despite his many contributions
to philosophy and to the Stanford
community, some know him only as
the humorous author of "Struc
tured Procrastination."
Does this bother Perry?

"No," he said. "It neither rankles
nor pleases me. It's just kind of in
triguing. Would I love for something
I wrote in philosophy to suddenly
become a cult item and make me in
credibly famous? Well, yes, that
would be sort of a blast, but it would
probably get old quick. But no, I
don't think it demeans my more seri
ous work. I have a sense of humor."
