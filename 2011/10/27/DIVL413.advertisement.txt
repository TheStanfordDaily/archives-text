*APR = Annual Percentage Rate. The rate is based on application's credit profile, model year of vehicle and term of the loan, payment method, and collateral
as applicable. 2.99% Annual Percentage Rate (0.008192 daily periodic rate) is a fixed rate, and reflects discount of 0.50% APR (0.001370 daily periodic rate) for
a monthly recurring direct deposit of at least $5OO to your SFCU checking account, 0.25% APR (0.000685 daily periodic rate) for automatic transfer of payment
using ACH, and 0.25% APR (0.000685 daily periodic rate) for service program discount, ie. Auto Sale October 29 - 30th 2011, or Premier Checking discount. Maxi
mum rate discount is 1.00%. You agree to the terms and condition of this program. Should you decide not to continue to maintain the service which qualifies
you for a special loan rate we may, at our option, change the rate charged on all loans pursuant to the loan agreement to the greater of the non-reduced rate in
effect when the loan was made or the non-reduced rate in effect on the date the qualifier service for each loan was terminated. When the rate increases in this
fashion, it has the effect of increasing the number of payments required to pay the balance in full. Applicants must have proof of income. All loans are subject to
credit approval. All rates and terms are subject to change without prior notice. Terms up to 84 months if financing $25,000 or more. Maximum loan term will be
based on year and miles on vehicle (contact loan officer for terms on a specific vehicle). Vehicles 10 years or newer with less than 80K miles.
