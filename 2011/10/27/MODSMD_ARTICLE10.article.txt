## DE-BUGGING TREES Keeping the California oak moth under control 
### ByADRIENNE VON SCHULTHESS 
Julie Day, a horticulturalist for
Stanford University, was walk
ing along a road on campus
with her lunch in hand when
she noticed that something was
not quite right about the foliage.
"I was walking past a group of
trees, and I went, 'Oh my god,'" Day
said. "I ran to the office, grabbed the
camera, took photographs, sent
emails and made phone calls. It was
high alert."
Day's reaction was in response to
the first outbreak of the California
oak moth, an insect native to coastal
California that feeds voraciously on
the California oak and other decidu
ous trees.

According to grounds supervisor
Max Pinedo, the outbreak took
place not only at Stanford, but also
in many parts of California.
So far this year, there have been
two spikes in the moth population,
one in April and May and then anoth
er in September. Each spike repre
sents a new generation of moth. The
previous generation mates and lays
eggs, leading to a new batch of cater
pillars that eventually turn into moths
themselves and continue the cycle.
"[Currently] we are entering the
third generation for the year," Day
said. "It is not as heavy as the first
and the second were because we've
already done some control."

According to Day, measures such
as daily monitoring will be taken to
keep the moth population in check.
With vigilance and a little luck,
Day hopes there will not be a fourth
outbreak.
According to human biology
professor Carol Boggs, predicting
whether an outbreak will happen
can be very difficult, especially since
there are so many factors at play.
"For moths and butterflies in
general, weather conditions are very
influential," Boggs said. "You can't
say we are going to have an explo
sion this year because it's been five
years since we've had an explosion."
A decrease in the number of nat
ural enemies could cause an out
break in population size, Boggs said.
In response to these outbreaks,
the University uses an integrated
pest management system a vari
ety of methods that track and com
bat the pest populations in away
that is designed to do minimal harm
to the environment.
Stanford tracks the populations
before outbreaks because timing is
crucial in controlling the moth pop
ulations. When the California oak
moth is a pupa, it has a hard shell that
is not easy to penetrate. During the
moth stage, the chemicals would
have to be sprayed into the air.
Therefore the abatement must be

done in the short window of time
during the caterpillar stage.
The University uses several dif
ferent control methods. Over the last
few years, staff have power-washed
trees, introduced natural predators
and used insecticides.
Last summer, the University used
an insecticide named Conserve, a
"turf and ornamental insect control,
a low toxicity type of chemical de
rived from natural sources," wrote
Pinedo in an email to The Daily.
The insecticide is diluted to six
ounces per 100 gallons of water be
fore it is used, he added.
Pinedo noted that all aspects of
the abatement program are targeted
around campus spots with high lev
els of walking traffic. The California
oak moth does not normally kill the
tree, but problems arise when the
tree is placed in an urban environ
ment.
"If the plants are stressed for
other reasons, like they are sur
rounded by asphalt or people are
biking over their roots, then defolia
tion can be more serious," Boggs
said.
Yet, the decision to control the
population is not always solely
based on the oak trees' ability to sur
vive.
According to Day, decisions re
garding abatement are made with
the public's comfort in mind, partic
ularly in high profile areas.
"[We want] to make sure that
everyone is comfortable on cam
pus," Day said.
In addition, the abatement pro
grams are used not only to protect
the trees, but to protect the campus's
overall aesthetic look, particularly
for visitors and prospective students.
"Sometimes people will be con
cerned about aesthetics," Boggs
said. "Stanford doesn't necessarily
want its oaks to look like something
has been tearing it to shreds. They
don't really want Tussock Moths
a moth that experienced a similar
rise in population in 2007 to be
dropping out of trees on top of
ProFros."
