## OP-ED A 						student's look at StanfordNYC 
### SHANE SAVITSKY 'l2 Managing Editor of Opinions 
I've always cheered for Stanford.
Consider me to be part of the
"Red Zone" of Stanford life in
general. I love this institution, so I've
always trusted its decisions in the
past whether academic, athletic
or administrative. Yet it is precisely
because I love Stanford that I find
myself cheering against it for the
first time in my academic career.
Yesterday, Stanford submitted its
proposal to the New York City Eco
nomic Development Corporation
to build StanfordNYC, a $2.5 billion
campus on Roosevelt Island in New
York City. Let me say that again:
$2.5 billion. That is more than dou
ble the initial estimate Stanford put
forth a few weeks ago. Stanford
wants to spend the equivalent of 15
percent of its endowment on a New
York campus designed to "become a
hub of technological innovation and
entrepreneurship in the United
States." I don't know if President
Hennessy has checked recently, but
we seem to already have that goal
firmly established in the 94305 ZIP
code.

Instead of spending billions of
dollars developing President Hen
nessy's dream New York real estate,
Stanford should be focusing that
enormous sum of money here on
campus. Why not use it to curb ever
ballooning tuition costs to make
Stanford more affordable for every
one? You know, this place was free
when Jane and Leland founded it
back in 1891. That $2.5 billion could
pay every undergraduate's tuition ..
.for over nine years. Why not attract
the best and the brightest to the
"hub of technological innovation
and entrepreneurship" that we al
ready have in Palo Alto by com
pletely paying for their education?
I'm sure that would do the trick.

But I understand; that's proba
bly too radical of a concept. So I'll
tone it down a bit: why don't we get
on par with our competitors and
become need-blind for interna
tional students? Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, MIT, Dartmouth and
Amherst all don't take financial
need into consideration when ad
mitting international students.
Stanford must do the same. That
would do far more to attract the
world's greatest minds than build
ing a new campus in New York
City. The administration cannot
call a need-blind policy for inter
nationals fiscally untenable when
it apparently has a few billion dol
lars at its fingertips. And why stop
there? You know that great finan
cial aid program that we rolled out
a few years ago in which families
making under $lOO,OOO would
have their tuition covered by fi
nancial aid? We'll always have an
inferiority complex when it comes
to the East Coast (an underlying
motivation for StanfordNYC?), so
why not bump that baseline to
$165,000 to match Harvard? Bet
ter yet, make it $200,000. As far as
I can tell, if we have billions of dol
lars to play around with, Stanford
has no excuse not to offer the best

financial aid in the nation.
Yet it's not just the financial as
pects of StanfordNYC that bother
me. The fact that it would be a cam
pus focused on engineering, tech
nology and entrepreneurship auto
matically precludes approximately
two-thirds of all Stanford students,
based on the University's 2010-2011
Common Data Set and Graduate
Student Profile, from ever utilizing
this new crown jewel fully. Even if
we're willing to accept this idea, then
what about the faculty? Are we hir
ing new professors? Are we going to
send some of our best professors
there? We shouldn't cause a brain
drain here on our home campus
solely to seed StanfordNYC with
reputable faculty.
Most importantly, this whole idea
seems likely to devalue the funda
mentals of a Stanford education.
StanfordNYC would be its own de
gree-granting institution. That
means that students could never set
foot on this campus and still get a
Stanford diploma. Furthermore,
during the proposal application
process, Stanford established a part
nership with the City College of New
York (CCNY) called
Stanford@CCNY, which, if Stan
ford's proposal is accepted, will
allow "highly qualified" students to
attain a master's degree from Stan
ford through joint CCNY-Stanford
8.A./M.S. and 8.5./ M.S. degree pro
grams. How can a university that val
ues its brand so much willingly allow
this to happen? Call me an overly
sentimental senior, but the Stanford
experience is here. It feels wrong to
me to allow people to call them
selves Stanford graduates without
spending a significant period of time
at this campus or without being ac
cepted exclusively to Stanford in the
first place. Maybe it's the way of the
future for example, NYU has a
campus in Abu Dhabi now but I
don't feel like this is a trend Stanford
should embrace just yet.
That brings me to my major
problem with this StanfordNYC ini
tiative: as students, we haven't had a
choice in the matter. It seems that
because President Hennessy and
the rest of the administration think
that StanfordNYC is a good idea, it's
been pushed down our collective
throats. Hennessy is more than will
ing to get glowing endorsements
from Larry Page, Sergey Brin and
Jerry Yang, but the voice of the stu
dent body has been ignored. Have
we ever been consulted? Have we
had an opportunity to raise any con
cerns to the administration? That
$2.5 billion for StanfordNYC osten
sibly contains some amount of our
tuition money or future donations
to this school.

President Hennessy, talk to us.
Maybe there are some benefits to
StanfordNYC that I'm missing, but
without a dialogue it simply doesn't
matter. Until then, for the first time
in my life, all I can say is: Go Cornell!
