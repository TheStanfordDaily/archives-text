# Do's AND Doo-Doo's
## I am America, but I need to not be 
### Chase Ishii 
Another Thursday, another
set of hot tips. DO: Love
America. DOO-DOO: Be
America.
A couple nights ago, my room
mate and I got into a 2 a.m. philo
sophical discussion/debate/passive
aggressive argument about whether
it was okay for America to be cul
turally isolated. We were talking
about how Americans are less
prone to discover and appreciate
music from other cultures. (This en
tire article will be written in gener
alizations, so if you are American
and are going to take offense, please
do so generally.) People halfway
across the world appreciate and em
ulate American songs, films and po
litical leaders, but most Americans
would fail a test of global culture.
We were trying to determine if this
global ignorance was a bad thing.
I was presenting arguments
about the social, economic, techno
logical, political, geographical and
pretty much every other "-ical" dif
ferences between the United States
and other countries. I was making
sure to acknowledge our influential
power and cultural independence.
(I think, sadly, I used the argument,
"It's like millions of people choos
ing to follow Brad Pitt on Twitter.
You can't expect him to follow all of
them back.")
Ultimately we ran circles around
the argument. He was presenting
well-prepared and reasonable argu
ments. In return, I was Stephen Col
bert-ing him to oblivion. Colbert
ing is my usual form of argumenta
tion, in which I make claims so pre
posterous that no one knows if I'm
intentionally being ridiculous for
satirical purposes or if I'm just a
plain idiot. And when I say no one
knows, I mean no one. Not even me.

We eventually settled on the
conclusion that most Americans
don't find value in exploring and
understanding other cultures be
cause America has been culturally
independent for the last 200-odd
years. We've either been a world
juggernaut, or we've been left
alone. Our music, film and sports in

dustries haven't needed a foreign
outlet to be sustainable.
European countries know the
importance of appreciating other
cultures because they've seen and
participated in the shifts in global
power and have been forced to
adapt and widen their understand
ing of art and cultural worth.
America has yet to depend on an
other country's culture. We've
grown into arrogant elitists of cul
tural convenience.
Here's an analogy. Say there's a
football team that has gone the last
two seasons undefeated. They've
dominated every team in the league
in every game. Now, it makes sense
that every other team is going to be
studying their strategy, trying to
pick up whatever is working. But is
the dominant team going to spend
its time trying to understand what
all the losing teams are doing?
Probably not. They will most likely
settle on what is working for them.
And is that a bad thing? Yes and
no. No in that it is not illegal-bad or
unethical-bad. The league is not
going to fine them for not branching
out. But yes, it is bad in that it is a
shame for the team. While they are
dominant having mastered their
specific style of play, they would be
unstoppable if they could master
other styles as well. It's a shame that
they've grown so complacent that
their pride doesn't allow them to be
even better and more diverse.
This team will never understand
the need to diversify and learn
other strategies until they lose.
Until they are no longer dominant,
independent and capable. Until
they are humbled.
It's the same thing with America.
Once China takes over the world
(because everyone keeps telling me
it will I hope it hasn't already
happened yet, because I still prefer
regular checkers to Chinese check
ers), you can bet more Americans
will be learning Chinese for busi
ness, which will trickle into our po
litical, educational and social lives.
We will understand the value of a
different culture out of necessity.

And it's the same for Stanford
students. For so many of us, we are
the America of our own lives.
Everything I know and value is be
cause it is convenient for me. I'm
not willing to take the time to learn
about someone else's culture or re
ligion or background or personal
history or whatever it is because I'm
doing just fine on my own. Now, is
this a bad thing? I'm not going to go
to jail for not appreciating a certain
culture. But it would be a shame to
be that wrapped up in myself.

I think we could all stand to be
humbled a bit, to find appreciation
and value in the people and things
that are not our own.

Chase would like to serve you a nice
slice of humble pie. (You know,
maybe after a nice dinner?) Email

up a time.

You can't expect him to follow all of
them back.")
Ultimately we ran circles around
the argument. He was presenting
well-prepared and reasonable argu
ments. In return, I was Stephen Col
bert-ing him to oblivion. Colbert
ing is my usual form of argumenta
tion, in which I make claims so pre
posterous that no one knows if I'm
intentionally being ridiculous for
satirical purposes or if I'm just a
plain idiot. And when I say no one
knows, I mean no one. Not even me.

We eventually settled on the
conclusion that most Americans
don't find value in exploring and
understanding other cultures be
cause America has been culturally
independent for the last 200-odd
years. We've either been a world
juggernaut, or we've been left
alone. Our music, film and sports in

dustries haven't needed a foreign
outlet to be sustainable.
European countries know the
importance of appreciating other
cultures because they've seen and
participated in the shifts in global
power and have been forced to
adapt and widen their understand
ing of art and cultural worth.
America has yet to depend on an
other country's culture. We've
grown into arrogant elitists of cul
tural convenience.
Here's an analogy. Say there's a
football team that has gone the last
two seasons undefeated. They've
dominated every team in the league
in every game. Now, it makes sense
that every other team is going to be
studying their strategy, trying to
pick up whatever is working. But is
the dominant team going to spend
its time trying to understand what
all the losing teams are doing?
Probably not. They will most likely
settle on what is working for them.
And is that a bad thing? Yes and
no. No in that it is not illegal-bad or
unethical-bad. The league is not
going to fine them for not branching
out. But yes, it is bad in that it is a
shame for the team. While they are
dominant having mastered their
specific style of play, they would be
unstoppable if they could master
other styles as well. It's a shame that
they've grown so complacent that
their pride doesn't allow them to be
even better and more diverse.
This team will never understand
the need to diversify and learn
other strategies until they lose.
Until they are no longer dominant,
independent and capable. Until
they are humbled.
It's the same thing with America.
Once China takes over the world
(because everyone keeps telling me
it will I hope it hasn't already
happened yet, because I still prefer
regular checkers to Chinese check
ers), you can bet more Americans
will be learning Chinese for busi
ness, which will trickle into our po
litical, educational and social lives.
We will understand the value of a
different culture out of necessity.

And it's the same for Stanford
students. For so many of us, we are
the America of our own lives.
Everything I know and value is be
cause it is convenient for me. I'm
not willing to take the time to learn
about someone else's culture or re
ligion or background or personal
history or whatever it is because I'm
doing just fine on my own. Now, is
this a bad thing? I'm not going to go
to jail for not appreciating a certain
culture. But it would be a shame to
be that wrapped up in myself.

I think we could all stand to be
humbled a bit, to find appreciation
and value in the people and things
that are not our own.

Chase would like to serve you a nice
slice of humble pie. (You know,
maybe after a nice dinner?) Email
him at ninjaish@stanford.edu to set
up a time.
