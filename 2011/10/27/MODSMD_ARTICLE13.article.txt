# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## (A chronicle) of cookies and cauliflower 
### Leslie Brian 
Is kale a(n): a) animal, b) veg
etable or c) mineral?

If you answered 'b,' you're cor
rect. But until I arrived in
Columbae last year, for all I
knew, kale could have been a
strange relative of the stork family
or maybe a kind of sedimentary
rock. Now, along with cauliflower
and quinoa, it's a staple of my diet.
I've come to love kale. My fa
vorite preparation? Saute it with
lots of garlic, then toss with soba
noodles, lemon juice, walnuts, tons
of parmesan cheese and now, this
is key fresh lemon zest! In my
mind, there are three things you can
never have enough of: garlic (two
cloves, really? Try more like 15),
lemon zest (already established)
and fresh herbs. I'm obsessed with
all three. In fact I don't think I've
ever cooked anything in my life
without one of them. When I'm
home, I drive my mom crazy zesting
lemon after lemon and hacking off
whole branches of rosemary. Maybe
it's a little neurotic that I absolutely
refuse to use pre-peeled garlic or
frozen basil cubes, but to me, those
little fresh additions provide a

straight-from-the-earth feel that
just makes me feel happier.
If you're wondering why I keep
rambling about kale and lemon zest,
I promise I have a point. But keep in
mind that this is coming from the girl
who literally stuck her nose into
every sack of cumin she encoun
tered in the markets of Istanbul, so
indulge me for a minute.
My point is less about the joys of
kale per se than it is about the
process through which I came to
love it that is, by making it my
own. I don't intend to make any
sweeping nutritional statement
about the health benefits of oregano
or how imbibing ginger tea three
times a day improves digestion. I'm
talking about something much more
basic and vastly more important: the
simple enjoyment of preparing food
and then eating it.
We eat six or seven times a day,
but the very fact that food is such an
ordinary, predictable part of our
lives means that we seldom pay it
much attention. As we scramble to
meet deadline after deadline, more
often than not, eating can become a
chore, something we do on the run
to fuel ourselves and move on with

our day. We wind up skipping break
fast, rushing through lunch, bolting
dinner and then overdoing it when
we finally get a chance to breathe.
It's an absolutely exhausted, vicious
cycle that leaves both body and soul

undernourished.
Granted.no one has the luxury of
tuning into the salty, crunchy, senso
ry experience of every pretzel. That
being said, why shouldn't we take a
little extra time to savor the morsels
we put in our mouths? American
culture stamps moral labels on
everything we eat, but honestly, the
best piece of nutrition advice I've
ever received is to just enjoy what
you're eating without the guilt. In
fact, the Japanese food pyramid in
cludes satisfaction and enjoyment as
one of the pillars of good nutrition.
"But, wait!" you may say. If I eat
whatever I want and enjoy it, I'll spin
out of control and eat junk food all
day long!
Oh, come now. Can you really
imagine eating chocolate cake and
ice cream every day for breakfast,
lunch and dinner? Neither can I.
Part of tuning in is also listening to
how certain foods and certain com
binations of food affect how your
body functions. If you want dessert,
go for it! Actually, savor it! When
you do, I have a sneaking suspicion
that gorging on an entire cheese
cake won't make you feel too hot.
And for that matter, when you real

ly listen, you might find yourself
craving broccoli or a salad, too!
By tuning into ourselves and the
actual experience of eating, we're
better able to give our bodies exact
ly what they need while enjoying the
food along the way. After all, our
bodies have literally evolved so that
they know what they need to thrive.
Our challenge is to listen to their
cues and respect their inner wisdom;
when we insist our head knows bet
ter and try to override our bodies'
cues, that's when we end up sabotag
ing ourselves.
So here's my nutrition tip of the
day: if you want to eat well, master
the art of listening to your body. Per
sonalize what you eat. Make it spe
cial to you and enjoy the experience.
You don't have to take it an ex
treme, but whether it's a particular
brand of peanut butter (hint: Justin's
honey almond butter to-go packs =
lifeblood) or adding a dash of nut
meg to your chai tea latte, that little
extra touch can put a smile on your
face!

it's a little neurotic that I absolutely
refuse to use pre-peeled garlic or
frozen basil cubes, but to me, those
little fresh additions provide a

straight-from-the-earth feel that
just makes me feel happier.
If you're wondering why I keep
rambling about kale and lemon zest,
I promise I have a point. But keep in
mind that this is coming from the girl
who literally stuck her nose into
every sack of cumin she encoun
tered in the markets of Istanbul, so
indulge me for a minute.
My point is less about the joys of
kale per se than it is about the
process through which I came to
love it that is, by making it my
own. I don't intend to make any
sweeping nutritional statement
about the health benefits of oregano
or how imbibing ginger tea three
times a day improves digestion. I'm
talking about something much more
basic and vastly more important: the
simple enjoyment of preparing food
and then eating it.
We eat six or seven times a day,
but the very fact that food is such an
ordinary, predictable part of our
lives means that we seldom pay it
much attention. As we scramble to
meet deadline after deadline, more
often than not, eating can become a
chore, something we do on the run
to fuel ourselves and move on with

our day. We wind up skipping break
fast, rushing through lunch, bolting
dinner and then overdoing it when
we finally get a chance to breathe.
It's an absolutely exhausted, vicious
cycle that leaves both body and soul

undernourished.
Granted.no one has the luxury of
tuning into the salty, crunchy, senso
ry experience of every pretzel. That
being said, why shouldn't we take a
little extra time to savor the morsels
we put in our mouths? American
culture stamps moral labels on
everything we eat, but honestly, the
best piece of nutrition advice I've
ever received is to just enjoy what
you're eating without the guilt. In
fact, the Japanese food pyramid in
cludes satisfaction and enjoyment as
one of the pillars of good nutrition.
"But, wait!" you may say. If I eat
whatever I want and enjoy it, I'll spin
out of control and eat junk food all
day long!
Oh, come now. Can you really
imagine eating chocolate cake and
ice cream every day for breakfast,
lunch and dinner? Neither can I.
Part of tuning in is also listening to
how certain foods and certain com
binations of food affect how your
body functions. If you want dessert,
go for it! Actually, savor it! When
you do, I have a sneaking suspicion
that gorging on an entire cheese
cake won't make you feel too hot.
And for that matter, when you real

ly listen, you might find yourself
craving broccoli or a salad, too!
By tuning into ourselves and the
actual experience of eating, we're
better able to give our bodies exact
ly what they need while enjoying the
food along the way. After all, our
bodies have literally evolved so that
they know what they need to thrive.
Our challenge is to listen to their
cues and respect their inner wisdom;
when we insist our head knows bet
ter and try to override our bodies'
cues, that's when we end up sabotag
ing ourselves.
So here's my nutrition tip of the
day: if you want to eat well, master
the art of listening to your body. Per
sonalize what you eat. Make it spe
cial to you and enjoy the experience.
You don't have to take it an ex
treme, but whether it's a particular
brand of peanut butter (hint: Justin's
honey almond butter to-go packs =
lifeblood) or adding a dash of nut
meg to your chai tea latte, that little
extra touch can put a smile on your
face!
