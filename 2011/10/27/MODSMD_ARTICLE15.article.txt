## TROJAN TEST Water polo seeks revenge in L.A. 
### DAVID PEREZ 
The Stanford men's water polo
team will face USC this Saturday
in a crucial Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation matchup. The

result will go a long way toward
determining whether or not Stan
ford will eventually secure an at
large bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment.
Saturday's game to be

played at USC's McDonald's
Swim Stadium will be the third
meeting between the two teams
this year. No. 3 Stanford (14-3,3-1
MPSF) took its first loss of the sea
son against USC at the NorCal In
vitational by a score of 12-5. But
the Cardinal returned the favor in

the two teams' next meeting, end
ing No. 2 USC's undefeated start
with a 6-4 win at the SoCal Tourna
ment.
The results have given the Car
dinal a sense of guarded confi
dence.
"We know we can beat them,
we just have to play our game and
play well. But we also remember
the first game too," said junior
driver Paul Rudolph.
USC currently sits alone atop
the MPSF standings with a perfect
4-0 conference record. Stanford is
right on the Trojans' heels, howev
er, sitting in a three-way tie with
California and UCLA for second
at 3-1. A win this weekend would
put Stanford in a four-way tie for
first place.
Even with first place in the con
ference at stake, this game holds
much more importance in terms of
its postseason implications. The win
ner of the MPSF Tournament re
ceives an automatic bid to the
NCAA Tournament, but an at-large
bid is also given out to the team with
the most impressive record. With
Stanford and USC currently ranked
in the top three, both teams are in
contention for that bid.
"This is our most important
game right now. This would be a
huge win right now, and we need
it," Rudolph said.
In order to get that win, the Car
dinal will need to repeat its defen
sive effort that held USC to only
four goals in their last meeting.
USC and Stanford boast the top
two defenses and two of the best
goalies in the MPSF. USC leads the
conference this year with only 71
goals against, an average of 4.73

goals against per game. Stanford is
right behind them, having allowed
91 goals this year (5.35 per game).

Both of those defenses are an
chored by experienced senior
goalies. Stanford's Brian Pingree is
the starter for the second year in a
row, and USC's Joel Dennerley
leads a team that returns every one
of its starters from last year's cham
pionship squad.
Among those returning from
USC's championship run is senior
driver Peter Kurzeka, who leads the
team with 26 goals on the season.
Kurzeka has scored in 13 of USC's
15 games and has scored multiple
goals in seven of those games.

Kurzeka and the rest of USC's
team beat Stanford in overtime in
last year's MPSF final, claiming the
automatic birth to the NCAA
Tournament. Stanford did not re
ceive the at-large bid and had to
stay at home as USC went on to
win the national title.
One Cardinal player absent
from the Farm for that loss was
freshman utility Alex Bowen.
Bowen, who will be relied on to try
and crack the USC defense, cur
rently leads Stanford with 39 goals.
That mark makes him the fourth
leading scorer in the MPSF and the
only freshman in the top 15 over
all.

Stanford and USC face off in a
top-tier showdown at 2:30 p.m. this
Saturday in Los Angeles.
