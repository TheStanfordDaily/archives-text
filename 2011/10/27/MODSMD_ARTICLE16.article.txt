# WOMEN'S TENNIS Q&A
## Gibbs reflects on first win, life off the court 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Sophomore Nicole Gibbs won her first individ
ual title as a collegian on Tuesday, knocking off
junior teammate Mallory Burdette at Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium to win the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association Northwest Regional Champi
onship. On Wednesday she sat down with The
Daily to discuss her win, the women's tennis team
and the balancing act that is college life.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was it like for
you to come out and win the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association Northwestern Regional Champi
onships women's singles title on Tuesday against
your teammate, Mallory Burdette?
Nicole Gibbs (NG): It was actually a really big
mental and tennis accomplishment for me, just be
cause I haven't won a tournament since 2007 by
some series of unfortunate events. I've played in

eight or nine finals in tournaments and hadn't
been able to convert on any of them. And while
playing a teammate is never fun... it is not as ful
filling when you have a teammate lose in the finals
on the same day as you win. It detracts a little bit
and obviously that's tough, but it takes away a bit
of the sense of celebration after the tourney be
cause you don't want to see your teammate lose.
But I'm definitely happy with the way my tennis is
going and happy to have broken through and won
finally.
TSD: Did you focus on anything in particular on
Tuesday? Was there any kind of key to your win?
NG: I played really great defense, I was staying in
points where my opponents had control, but I was
kind of just gritting it out running down balls
and playing really solid defense. I had a lot to im
prove offensively, and I'm ready to continue to de
velop before the spring season comes around. But
my defense was definitely a strength and is what

led me to the win.
TSD: Last year the team came so close to winning
a national championship against Florida. What
was it like to be a part of that and how does it mo
tivate you today?
NG: There is always a very different feeling in the
team events compared to individual matches. And
honestly, I put a lot more store in the results that
the team achieves; it's just more indicative of the
entire team effort, and it's more important to us
than the individual events. Last year we had a few
unfortunate things happen late in the year los
ing All-American Kristie Ahn to an injury really
hurt and with her out for the finals... given the
circumstances we competed unbelievably well,
came within a few points of winning the title. So
retrospectively, everyone was really proud of our
effort and seems to be motivated for next year.
