# WOMEN'S TENNIS Q&A
## Gibbs reflects on first win, life off the court 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Sophomore Nicole Gibbs won her first individ
ual title as a collegian on Tuesday, knocking off
junior teammate Mallory Burdette at Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium to win the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association Northwest Regional Champi
onship. On Wednesday she sat down with The
Daily to discuss her win, the women's tennis team
and the balancing act that is college life.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was it like for
you to come out and win the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association Northwestern Regional Champi
onships women's singles title on Tuesday against
your teammate, Mallory Burdette?
Nicole Gibbs (NG): It was actually a really big
mental and tennis accomplishment for me, just be
cause I haven't won a tournament since 2007 by
some series of unfortunate events. I've played in

eight or nine finals in tournaments and hadn't
been able to convert on any of them. And while
playing a teammate is never fun... it is not as ful
filling when you have a teammate lose in the finals
on the same day as you win. It detracts a little bit
and obviously that's tough, but it takes away a bit
of the sense of celebration after the tourney be
cause you don't want to see your teammate lose.
But I'm definitely happy with the way my tennis is
going and happy to have broken through and won
finally.
TSD: Did you focus on anything in particular on
Tuesday? Was there any kind of key to your win?
NG: I played really great defense, I was staying in
points where my opponents had control, but I was
kind of just gritting it out running down balls
and playing really solid defense. I had a lot to im
prove offensively, and I'm ready to continue to de
velop before the spring season comes around. But
my defense was definitely a strength and is what

led me to the win.
TSD: Last year the team came so close to winning
a national championship against Florida. What
was it like to be a part of that and how does it mo
tivate you today?
NG: There is always a very different feeling in the
team events compared to individual matches. And
honestly, I put a lot more store in the results that
the team achieves; it's just more indicative of the
entire team effort, and it's more important to us
than the individual events. Last year we had a few
unfortunate things happen late in the year los
ing All-American Kristie Ahn to an injury really
hurt and with her out for the finals... given the
circumstances we competed unbelievably well,
came within a few points of winning the title. So
retrospectively, everyone was really proud of our
effort and seems to be motivated for next year.
When you talk about Stanford
tennis, it's a program that literally
sees the distinction between a good
year and bad year as winning a cham
pionship or not. We aren't content.
And while we did the best we could
with what we had last year, we want
to really maximize our team's poten
tial this year and put ourselves in a
good position to win the title again.
TSD: What has been the biggest ad
justment to the college game?
NG: With pretty much every other
sport, the players at a collegiate level
are used to competing in team for
mat. In our sport, some players play
high school tennis, but it isn't widely
done. And the top players in the
country tend not to play. With the col
lege game, it's a very unique feeling,
competing for yourself but also for
the team. The matches have a differ
ent dynamic. When you're standing
on the sideline with this team, it's un
like any other team. You see what
they do day-in and day-out, and you
know they have prepared themselves
to the best of their ability for whatev
er day. When you do the best you can
and know they are doing the best that
they can, it's not too nerve-wracking
or hard to watch. When push comes
to shove, they'll come through, and I
definitely have that confidence in all
my teammates and look forward to
watching all of them play.
TSD: What do you really love doing
the most when you aren't on the
court?
NG: Well, to be honest, I really like
going out on the weekends and just
trying to maintain that sense of bal
ance. Even though college tennis and
academics are really rigorous, I try to
remind myself that this is supposed to
be fun. I've definitely made the most
of the campus nightlife. Outside of
that, I just love doing anything that's
athletic. We played powder-puff foot
ball with my sorority last week, so I
just love the active community here
at Stanford. It's a really healthy and
great place to be a student-athlete.
And on top of that, I love watching
NBA basketball. So I follow that
closely, and I used to be a Cleveland
Cavaliers fan, but that ship has kind
of sailed. Now I'm kind of a bandwag
on Celtics fan since I hate the Heat
and Lakers so much. And on campus,

I absolutely love going and support
ing other teams. My three favorites so
far this year have been women's vol
leyball, soccer and football. It's fun
going to their games and getting to
know the players. And I think it's
even more fun when my friends are
out there competing, and that's very
unique to college athletics.
TSD: As for you personally, why
Stanford? What brought you here?
NG: Well first of all, [tennis coach]
Lele [Forood] is great. She really
cares about all of her players, and
she runs a really good program. She
is so knowledgeable about the game
and just knows so much tennis, so
she influences the players in a very
good way. And what brought me
here was kind of just the legacy.
Only Stanford can claim such a
great number of championships
paired with how rigorous the aca
demics are. I always tell people that
I was a giant nerd, and when I was 10
I really wanted to go to Harvard.
But then I got good at tennis, and I
figured the Ivy League might not
allow me to maximize my potential.
So I asked my dad which school is
best at athletics and academics in
the country, and he told me that
Stanford was probably my best bet.
From age 12 until I committed to
come here, I was just head-over

heels with the school, and when I
visited I just knew this was the place
I wanted to be.

TSD: Okay, now I know this is all sub
jective, but what has been the tough
est class you've taken thus far on the
Farm?

NG: Well I'm in Math 42 right now,
and I'm really kind of struggling. But
I've taken a bunch of challenging
classes there was an advanced po
litical science class I took without
having taken an introductory politi
cal science classes, so that was pretty
tough. I'd say just that the math class
es are really getting to me, however,
and I'm not looking forward to Math
51 in the winter. I'm just hoping to get
through it without doing too much
damage to my GPA.

TSD: With your family having played
a lot of tennis, what was it like grow
ing up? Was there pressure from your
parents to keep playing?

NG: Well, tennis was pretty much
everything. My great-grandfather
played and passed it off to my grand
father, who passed it on to my dad.
And my dad has been gung-ho about
the whole lifestyle since I was one
year old. He had me hitting over two
trash cans since then and was kind of
obsessed. And actually I hated tennis
with a burning passion I have
some pretty horrifying memories of
not wanting to go out to the courts
and hit. But something clicked, and
then it wasn't about my dad asking
me to go play, it was something I
loved. That's really when I started to
take off, and ever since I've loved
competing, and I think it's showed in
the results.

TSD: You're only a sophomore, but
what are your personal aspirations in
the game of tennis?

NG: As far as this season is con
cerned, the central goal is just to win a
team championship, and for me I
want to do whatever I can to make
that happen or help make it happen.
Long term, I'm pretty dead set on
playing the pro tour. I want to see how
I can do when it's just about the tennis.
When I'm out of the collegiate
lifestyle, and I have a sole focus on im
proving and becoming the best I can
be, I want to give it a shot and see how
far I can go. I have a certain amount of
confidence that I can prepare myself
and be ready for the pro tennis tour.

athletic. We played powder-puff foot
ball with my sorority last week, so I
just love the active community here
at Stanford. It's a really healthy and
great place to be a student-athlete.
And on top of that, I love watching
NBA basketball. So I follow that
closely, and I used to be a Cleveland
Cavaliers fan, but that ship has kind
of sailed. Now I'm kind of a bandwag
on Celtics fan since I hate the Heat
and Lakers so much. And on campus,

I absolutely love going and support
ing other teams. My three favorites so
far this year have been women's vol
leyball, soccer and football. It's fun
going to their games and getting to
know the players. And I think it's
even more fun when my friends are
out there competing, and that's very
unique to college athletics.
TSD: As for you personally, why
Stanford? What brought you here?
NG: Well first of all, [tennis coach]
Lele [Forood] is great. She really
cares about all of her players, and
she runs a really good program. She
is so knowledgeable about the game
and just knows so much tennis, so
she influences the players in a very
good way. And what brought me
here was kind of just the legacy.
Only Stanford can claim such a
great number of championships
paired with how rigorous the aca
demics are. I always tell people that
I was a giant nerd, and when I was 10
I really wanted to go to Harvard.
But then I got good at tennis, and I
figured the Ivy League might not
allow me to maximize my potential.
So I asked my dad which school is
best at athletics and academics in
the country, and he told me that
Stanford was probably my best bet.
From age 12 until I committed to
come here, I was just head-over

heels with the school, and when I
visited I just knew this was the place
I wanted to be.

TSD: Okay, now I know this is all sub
jective, but what has been the tough
est class you've taken thus far on the
Farm?

NG: Well I'm in Math 42 right now,
and I'm really kind of struggling. But
I've taken a bunch of challenging
classes there was an advanced po
litical science class I took without
having taken an introductory politi
cal science classes, so that was pretty
tough. I'd say just that the math class
es are really getting to me, however,
and I'm not looking forward to Math
51 in the winter. I'm just hoping to get
through it without doing too much
damage to my GPA.

TSD: With your family having played
a lot of tennis, what was it like grow
ing up? Was there pressure from your
parents to keep playing?

NG: Well, tennis was pretty much
everything. My great-grandfather
played and passed it off to my grand
father, who passed it on to my dad.
And my dad has been gung-ho about
the whole lifestyle since I was one
year old. He had me hitting over two
trash cans since then and was kind of
obsessed. And actually I hated tennis
with a burning passion I have
some pretty horrifying memories of
not wanting to go out to the courts
and hit. But something clicked, and
then it wasn't about my dad asking
me to go play, it was something I
loved. That's really when I started to
take off, and ever since I've loved
competing, and I think it's showed in
the results.

TSD: You're only a sophomore, but
what are your personal aspirations in
the game of tennis?

NG: As far as this season is con
cerned, the central goal is just to win a
team championship, and for me I
want to do whatever I can to make
that happen or help make it happen.
Long term, I'm pretty dead set on
playing the pro tour. I want to see how
I can do when it's just about the tennis.
When I'm out of the collegiate
lifestyle, and I have a sole focus on im
proving and becoming the best I can
be, I want to give it a shot and see how
far I can go. I have a certain amount of
confidence that I can prepare myself
and be ready for the pro tennis tour.

Sophomore Nicole Gibbs (above)
won her first individual title as a member
of the Stanford tennis team on
Tuesday, capturing the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association Northwest Regional
Championship.
Sophomore Nicole Gibbs won her first individ
ual title as a collegian on Tuesday, knocking off
junior teammate Mallory Burdette at Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium to win the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association Northwest Regional Champi
onship. On Wednesday she sat down with The
Daily to discuss her win, the women's tennis team
and the balancing act that is college life.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): What was it like for
you to come out and win the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Association Northwestern Regional Champi
onships women's singles title on Tuesday against
your teammate, Mallory Burdette?
Nicole Gibbs (NG): It was actually a really big
mental and tennis accomplishment for me, just be
cause I haven't won a tournament since 2007 by
some series of unfortunate events. I've played in

eight or nine finals in tournaments and hadn't
been able to convert on any of them. And while
playing a teammate is never fun... it is not as ful
filling when you have a teammate lose in the finals
on the same day as you win. It detracts a little bit
and obviously that's tough, but it takes away a bit
of the sense of celebration after the tourney be
cause you don't want to see your teammate lose.
But I'm definitely happy with the way my tennis is
going and happy to have broken through and won
finally.
TSD: Did you focus on anything in particular on
Tuesday? Was there any kind of key to your win?
NG: I played really great defense, I was staying in
points where my opponents had control, but I was
kind of just gritting it out running down balls
and playing really solid defense. I had a lot to im
prove offensively, and I'm ready to continue to de
velop before the spring season comes around. But
my defense was definitely a strength and is what

led me to the win.
TSD: Last year the team came so close to winning
a national championship against Florida. What
was it like to be a part of that and how does it mo
tivate you today?
NG: There is always a very different feeling in the
team events compared to individual matches. And
honestly, I put a lot more store in the results that
the team achieves; it's just more indicative of the
entire team effort, and it's more important to us
than the individual events. Last year we had a few
unfortunate things happen late in the year los
ing All-American Kristie Ahn to an injury really
hurt and with her out for the finals... given the
circumstances we competed unbelievably well,
came within a few points of winning the title. So
retrospectively, everyone was really proud of our
effort and seems to be motivated for next year.
When you talk about Stanford
tennis, it's a program that literally
sees the distinction between a good
year and bad year as winning a cham
pionship or not. We aren't content.
And while we did the best we could
with what we had last year, we want
to really maximize our team's poten
tial this year and put ourselves in a
good position to win the title again.
TSD: What has been the biggest ad
justment to the college game?
NG: With pretty much every other
sport, the players at a collegiate level
are used to competing in team for
mat. In our sport, some players play
high school tennis, but it isn't widely
done. And the top players in the
country tend not to play. With the col
lege game, it's a very unique feeling,
competing for yourself but also for
the team. The matches have a differ
ent dynamic. When you're standing
on the sideline with this team, it's un
like any other team. You see what
they do day-in and day-out, and you
know they have prepared themselves
to the best of their ability for whatev
er day. When you do the best you can
and know they are doing the best that
they can, it's not too nerve-wracking
or hard to watch. When push comes
to shove, they'll come through, and I
definitely have that confidence in all
my teammates and look forward to
watching all of them play.
TSD: What do you really love doing
the most when you aren't on the
court?
NG: Well, to be honest, I really like
going out on the weekends and just
trying to maintain that sense of bal
ance. Even though college tennis and
academics are really rigorous, I try to
remind myself that this is supposed to
be fun. I've definitely made the most
of the campus nightlife. Outside of
that, I just love doing anything that's
athletic. We played powder-puff foot
ball with my sorority last week, so I
just love the active community here
at Stanford. It's a really healthy and
