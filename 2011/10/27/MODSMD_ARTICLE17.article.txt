# Cardinal looks for a little revenge
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ 
History doesn't always have to
repeat itself. This is the mantra that
the Stanford women's volleyball
team will take into this weekend's
matchups against the UCLA Bruins
and the USC Trojans, the teams that
handed the Card two of its three
losses on the season.

Stanford's trip down to Los An
geles earlier in the season was, in a
word, disastrous. The Cardinal
dropped both of its matches, losing
to UCLA in five sets (18-25,18-25,
25-23,29-27,9-15) and USC in three
(23-25,24-26,23-25). However, com
ing off eight straight wins and play
ing behind its home crowd at
Maples Pavilion, the Card has every
reason to believe that this weekend
will be different.

This weekend is an opportunity
for the Cardinal (16-3,10-3 Pac-12)
to gain ground in the Pac-12, as it
trails both first-place USC (17-3,12-
1) and third-place UCLA (21-2,11-
2) in the conference. There is a lot on
the line for Stanford, as a pair of vic
tories would drastically improve its
chances of winning the division.
The No. 4 USC Trojans roll into
town on Friday night for what ap
pears to be a compelling matchup.
The Trojans handled Colorado and
Utah this past weekend, winning
both matchups in straight sets. Their
only loss in conference play was to

UCLA, and they have arguably
been playing as well as anybody in
the country.
Leading the way for USC is sen
ior outside hitter Alex Jupiter.
Jupiter has been a force this year, an
choring the Trojan offense. She is
currently second in the Pac-12 in
points per set with 5.19, and her 4.31
kills per set leads the team. Jupiter
also leads all Pac-12 players with 0.5
aces per set.

Jupiter's stellar play would not
be possible without the help of
teammate Kendall Bateman,
though, as the senior setter has
played phenomenally well for USC
this year, averaging 11.77 assists per
set. Bateman was named to the All-
American team last year and has not
disappointed this season.
The task of neutralizing the USC
attack will rest mostly on the shoul
ders of sophomore middle blocker
Carly Wopat. Wopat is coming off of
her strongest performance of the
season in which she posted a career
high 18 kills. However, the Card did
not play its best volleyball last week
and will certainly have to return to
mid-season form in order to top the
Trojans.

Things don't get any easier for
Stanford after USC, as the No. 6
UCLA Bruins pose a difficult chal
lenge on Saturday night.

Freshman libera Kyle Gilbert (above) and the Stanford women's
volleyball team welcome two of the best teams in the country, USC and
UCLA, into Maples Pavilion for two critical Pac-12 games this weekend.
The Bruins are coming off of a
shaky four-set win against Colorado
and a dominating sweep of Utah in
which they posted their highest hit
ting percentage (.411) on the year.
The Bruins have been resilient this
year, demonstrating the impressive
ability to play their best volleyball
against the toughest opponents.
UCLA has beaten each of its fellow
top four teams, downing USC, Stan
ford and Cal.
The Bruin's balanced attack fea
tures junior Rachel Kidder and sen
ior Lainey Gera. Kidder leads

UCLA in points with 5.01 per set,
not far off Pac-12 leader Meagan
Ganzer's 5.40 pace. Lainey Gera
places third in the Pac-12 in digs
with 4.88 per set.
The Bruins also boast one of the
most experienced rosters in the Pac
-12, with five seniors on the team.
The Card can expect UCLA to
thrive under the pressure and play
one of their best matches of the
year. Stanford will certainly be
looking to emerge from the week
end with two wins and a spot atop
the conference standings.
The weekend series kicks off at 7
p.m. on Friday night at Maples
Pavilion.
