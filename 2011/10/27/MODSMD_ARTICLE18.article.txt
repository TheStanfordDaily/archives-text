# A 						quick field guide to SEC fans

### Jack Blanchat 
Can you hear them coming?
Sometimes they bark like
dogs, other times they
squeal like swine. Can you
smell them? High-priced
perfume mixed with cigarettes, bour
bon and Natural Light?

That's right, the SEC has caught wind
of the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal football
team and the SEC fans are getting
a little scared.

In the last couple of weeks, the Car
dinal has started to impress the nation
al media with an ever-expanding
streak of blowout wins. As you proba
bly know by know, Stanford has beat
en its last 10 opponents by 25 points or
more the first streak of its kind
since Franklin Roosevelt was presi
dent. Now the national media is paying
attention, saying that the Cardinal can
"hang with the SEC's best" and "may
well match up better with LSU or Al
abama than most teams."

Of course, the notion that Stanford
could challenge teams from the undis
puted best conference in college foot
ball ever known to man means that the
fans in the Southeast are going to do
everything they can to debunk this no
tion. If you look at one question in this
week's Sports Illustrated college foot
ball mailbag, you'll see that Todd from
Tuscaloosa says, "We cannot afford
angry fans from Indianapolis or Miami
descending upon our towns after An
drew Luck gets hurt in his first-ever
game against a real defense."
As much as I appreciate any jokes
about how bad the Dolphins and Colts
are, there's an interesting point to be
made here Stanford and the SEC
are essentially total strangers to one
another.

Stanford has only played five foot
ball games against SEC competition in
its history, and it hasn't played a squad
from the south since the 1978 Blue
bonnet Bowl, when head coach Bill
Walsh led the Cardinal to a 25-22 vic
tory over the Georgia Bulldogs.

So in these next few weeks, when all
eyes will be turned to the LSU-Alaba
ma showdown, it's probably for the
best that Stanford fans get familiar
with just who these crazy SEC fans are
and learn how to interact with them in
the case that the Cardinal does face off
with the Tigers or Tide down the road.
As an Arkansas native, I've gotten
to know these fans pretty well, and I
imagine that you're probably thinking
to yourselfj "Who are these people?
Why are they so obsessed with college
football? Can't we all just get along?
Do LSU fans really smell like corn
dogs?"

So here are a few critical things that
you should know about SEC fans:
I.They will argue about absolutely
anything. A great way to make an SEC
football fan upset is to say that the
SEC is not the best conference in col
lege football. It's not true, but back
your argument up by talking about the
2009 Sugar Bowl, when Utah domi
nated Alabama, 31-17. It's amusing to
watch fans bend over backwards to de
fend Bama getting trounced by saying
that they "didn't care about the game
anyway." Another good one is to sug
gest that Boise State would be able to
go undefeated playing an SEC sched
ule, but be prepared to get insulted if
you pursue either argument.
2. They love conspiracy, controver
sy and coup d'etats. Why do you think
Cam Newton's pay-for-play scandal
was such a big story? Even though
"everybody cheats," SEC fans will be
damned before they see a cheater play
for another school. Additionally, they
love to set unreal expectations for
their teams so that they can call for
their coach to be fired every year.
3. They come from all walks of life.
The tailgating scene around Stanford
is pretty much homogenous outside of
the students it's all old people
drinking red wine and chatting idly in
lawn chairs. In the SEC, it's people
doing anything and everything imagi
nable. Sure, there are people wearing
sleeveless shirts and jorts (or even no
shirt at all), but they'll be shoulder-to
shoulder with fraternity pledges wear
ing suits and middle-aged guys who
scream way too loud and wear coach
es' polo shirts.
4. If provoked, they can be terrify
ing. LSU fans are the scariest people I
have ever met in my life. They get scar
ify drunk, yell "Tiger Bait" at men,
women and children who support the
opposing team and make for the
wildest gameday atmospheres ever. If
you meet an LSU fan, try to befriend
him or her.
5. They all hate Tim Tebow (except
for Florida fans). See, even fans in Pac
-12 territory have something in com
mon with your neighbors to the South!
But seriously, everybody hates Tim
Tebow.
So there you go, Stanford fans, a
few things to think about as we come
down to the exciting second half of the
college football season, and a few

things to be prepared for if the Cardi
nal end up facing off against one of
those SEC teams teams with the
wildest, rowdiest, most unusual and in
teresting fan bases in America.

As a native of SEC territory, Jack
Blanchat knows a thing or two about
how to have a proper tailgate. See if
he'll teach you the Little Rock Bounce
at blanchat@stanford.edu or follow
him on Twitter @'jmblanchat.

Can you hear them coming?
Sometimes they bark like
dogs, other times they
squeal like swine. Can you
smell them? High-priced
perfume mixed with cigarettes, bour
bon and Natural Light?

That's right, the SEC has caught wind
of the No. 4 Stanford Cardinal football
team and the SEC fans are getting
a little scared.

In the last couple of weeks, the Car
dinal has started to impress the nation
al media with an ever-expanding
streak of blowout wins. As you proba
bly know by know, Stanford has beat
en its last 10 opponents by 25 points or
more the first streak of its kind
since Franklin Roosevelt was presi
dent. Now the national media is paying
attention, saying that the Cardinal can
"hang with the SEC's best" and "may
well match up better with LSU or Al
abama than most teams."

Of course, the notion that Stanford
could challenge teams from the undis
puted best conference in college foot
ball ever known to man means that the
fans in the Southeast are going to do
everything they can to debunk this no
tion. If you look at one question in this
week's Sports Illustrated college foot
ball mailbag, you'll see that Todd from
Tuscaloosa says, "We cannot afford
angry fans from Indianapolis or Miami
descending upon our towns after An
drew Luck gets hurt in his first-ever
game against a real defense."
As much as I appreciate any jokes
about how bad the Dolphins and Colts
are, there's an interesting point to be
made here Stanford and the SEC
are essentially total strangers to one
another.

Stanford has only played five foot
ball games against SEC competition in
its history, and it hasn't played a squad
from the south since the 1978 Blue
bonnet Bowl, when head coach Bill
Walsh led the Cardinal to a 25-22 vic
tory over the Georgia Bulldogs.

So in these next few weeks, when all
eyes will be turned to the LSU-Alaba
ma showdown, it's probably for the
best that Stanford fans get familiar
with just who these crazy SEC fans are
and learn how to interact with them in
the case that the Cardinal does face off
with the Tigers or Tide down the road.
As an Arkansas native, I've gotten
to know these fans pretty well, and I
imagine that you're probably thinking
to yourselfj "Who are these people?
Why are they so obsessed with college
football? Can't we all just get along?
Do LSU fans really smell like corn
dogs?"

So here are a few critical things that
you should know about SEC fans:
I.They will argue about absolutely
anything. A great way to make an SEC
football fan upset is to say that the
SEC is not the best conference in col
lege football. It's not true, but back
your argument up by talking about the
2009 Sugar Bowl, when Utah domi
nated Alabama, 31-17. It's amusing to
watch fans bend over backwards to de
fend Bama getting trounced by saying
that they "didn't care about the game
anyway." Another good one is to sug
gest that Boise State would be able to
go undefeated playing an SEC sched
ule, but be prepared to get insulted if
you pursue either argument.
2. They love conspiracy, controver
sy and coup d'etats. Why do you think
Cam Newton's pay-for-play scandal
was such a big story? Even though
"everybody cheats," SEC fans will be
damned before they see a cheater play
for another school. Additionally, they
love to set unreal expectations for
their teams so that they can call for
their coach to be fired every year.
3. They come from all walks of life.
The tailgating scene around Stanford
is pretty much homogenous outside of
the students it's all old people
drinking red wine and chatting idly in
lawn chairs. In the SEC, it's people
doing anything and everything imagi
nable. Sure, there are people wearing
sleeveless shirts and jorts (or even no
shirt at all), but they'll be shoulder-to
shoulder with fraternity pledges wear
ing suits and middle-aged guys who
scream way too loud and wear coach
es' polo shirts.
4. If provoked, they can be terrify
ing. LSU fans are the scariest people I
have ever met in my life. They get scar
ify drunk, yell "Tiger Bait" at men,
women and children who support the
opposing team and make for the
wildest gameday atmospheres ever. If
you meet an LSU fan, try to befriend
him or her.
5. They all hate Tim Tebow (except
for Florida fans). See, even fans in Pac
-12 territory have something in com
mon with your neighbors to the South!
But seriously, everybody hates Tim
Tebow.
So there you go, Stanford fans, a
few things to think about as we come
down to the exciting second half of the
college football season, and a few

things to be prepared for if the Cardi
nal end up facing off against one of
those SEC teams teams with the
wildest, rowdiest, most unusual and in
teresting fan bases in America.
