## Stanford programs score high in NCAA's annual Graduation Success Rate report 
### â€”Miles Bennett-Smith 
The NCAA released its annual
Graduation Success Rate report on
Tuesday, and only three Football
Bowl Subdivision programs (for
merly NCAA Div. I) scored higher
than Stanford's .653 (17-26) rating

and none of the Cardinal's 26
teams had graduation rates lower
than 80 percent.

Not to be confused with the
NCAA's Academic Progress Rate
which comes out annually in May,
the GSR was created in 2005 to bet
ter assess the academic success of stu
dent-athletes. It is calculated and re
ported individually for each NCAA
sponsored sport.
Nine men's programs received
perfect scores, including baseball,
fencing, golf, gymnastics, tennis,
track, volleyball and water polo. And
eight women's teams rowing, field
hockey, golf, gymnastics, swimming
and diving, softball, soccer and syn

chronized swimming also had
perfect ratings.
All in all, 22 Stanford programs
recorded scores at or above 90, with
the women's basketball program
earning a 93 that was the third-highest
score in the country. The football pro
gram received a GSR of 87, the top
mark in the Pac-12 and the seventh
best score among FBS institutions.
The Cardinal also led all FBS
schools with 11 total perfect scores in
the federal graduation rate analysis,
which does not account for students
who leave an institution while aca
demically eligible or midyear en
rollees. Only the Federal Graduation
Rates are calculated for both the stu
dent population at large as well as the
student-athlete population.
Both the measurements are based
upon classes from 2001-04 and show
the percentage of student-athletes
earning a degree within six years.
Stanford student-athletes have a
Federal Graduation four-class aver
age of 95 percent.
