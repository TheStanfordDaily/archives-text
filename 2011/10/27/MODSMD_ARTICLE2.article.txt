# Stanford submits NYC proposal
## University competes to build $2.5 billion NYC campus 
### BILLY GALLAGHER MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford University submitted its proposal
on Wednesday to build a $2.5 billion, 1.9 mil
lion square-foot graduate school of applied
t sciences and engineering in New York City.
If the New York City Economic Develop
ment Corporation (NYCEDC) selects Stan
ford's proposal, the city will grant the Univer
t> sity land on Roosevelt Island and $lOO million

to develop its campus over the next 30 years.
Once completed, "StanfordNYC" is ex
pected to be home to more than 200 faculty
members and 2,000 graduate students study
ing engineering, applied sciences, technology
and entrepreneurship. The University is com
mitting an initial $2OO million toward Stan
fordNYC to cover startup costs and an initial
endowment for research. If the proposal is se-

If Stanford's proposal is accepted, the City of New York will grant the University
land on Roosevelt Island and $100 million to develop the campus over 30 years.
lected, Stanford will begin a $1.5
billion, 10-year fundraising cam
paign to finance the new campus
and its endowment.

"StanfordNYC will bring Stan
ford's unparalleled track record in
research, innovation and entrepre
neurship to New York City, the
world's capital of finance, arts and
culture," President John Hennessy
wrote in the submission letter to
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg. "StanfordNYC has the
potential to help catapult New York
City into a leadership position in
technology, to enhance its entrepre
neurial endeavors and outcomes,
diversify its economic base, en
hance its talent pool and help our
nation maintain its global lead in
science and technology."
The school will have an empha
sis on transferring discoveries to the
marketplace, as it is expected to
serve as a catalyst for new jobs in
New York.

If StanfordNYC can produce
just 50 percent of the Stanford start
ups in Silicon Valley, over 100,000
new jobs could be created in the
first 20 to 30 years on Roosevelt Is
land, University officials said in a
press release Wednesday. They also
claimed that Silicon Valley venture
capitalists have indicated they
would follow Stanford to New
York.

A faculty committee designed
StanfordNYC's academic program,
which will focus heavily on pro
grams in engineering, computer sci
ence, entrepreneurship, graduate
business and technology manage
ment.

"We can create a community of
scholars in an entirely new environ
ment, generating the next wave of
ideas and breakthroughs," said Jim
Plummer, dean of Stanford's
School of Engineering, in the press
announcement. "Innovation hap
pens when you are challenged by
new problems and look at solutions
from new perspectives. Our faculty
is very excited about the possibili
ties of New York City."
Hennessy noted that he sees the
program expanding over the years
to the undergraduate population.
"Over time, we can also develop
programs for undergraduates in
New York," Hennessy said in a late
September joint interview with the
Stanford Report, Stanford maga

zine and The Daily. "1 can imagine a
program potentially larger than our
Washington, D.C. program or any
of our overseas programs where
students can spend a quarter or
more in the city. The cultural rich
ness of New York in the visual
arts, drama, music offers benefits
both to students and to the depart
ments here on campus."

This submission marks the be
ginning of the final stage of a year
long process. Bloomberg and the
NYCEDC launched Applied Sci
ences NYC last December with a
request for proposals (RFP).
Hennessy discussed the idea
with the Faculty Senate and led
Stanford in submitting a formal
"expression of interest" in March; a
New York campus was also the cen
ter of focus in April's Academic
Council meeting.
In July, Bloomberg requested
specific plans from the 27 institu
tions and others that met certain
criteria that responded to the
RFP. Since then, Stanford has been
working on its formal submission: a
600-page proposal that includes de
tailed academic, financial, design
and legal documents. The Board of
Trustees approved the proposal in a
meeting early this month.
Final proposals are due by Fri
day; after that point, NYC officials
will begin the process of review.
Stanford officials are expecting
to travel to New York City after
Thanksgiving to discuss the propos
al. The city plans to make a decision
by the end of the year.
However, there has been specu
lation that Bloomberg may end up
picking multiple winners. Columbia
University and New York Universi
ty have proposed increasing the size
and scope of their existing pro
grams in the city, while Carnegie
Mellon University is proposing a
school in Brooklyn. Since none of
these proposals involve Roosevelt
Island, there is the possibility that
the city could award Roosevelt Is
land to one group and a second site
to another group.
"I want a new player here," said
NYU President John Sexton to
Crains New York. "I've been en
couraging Stanford since February
to come into this. I'm delighted Cor
nell is in this. We have different
ideas that aren't in competition
with each other. They complement
each other."

One potential complication to
awarding multiple schools the $lOO
million and land grant is Bloomberg's
term, which expires in 2013.
Bloomberg's administration has

moved very quickly to select a school
in just one year to break ground while
Bloomberg is still in office. Accom
plishing this with two different
groups could prove difficult.
Many of the 27 institutions that
expressed interest have dropped
their bid for consideration; Pur
due, a public university, decided to
stop pursuing the applied sciences
campus in late September, citing
insufficient financial backing from
New York.
Cornell continues to be Stan
ford's main contender for the Roo
sevelt Island bid. The two universi
ties are widely considered to be the
favorites to be selected and have
been making similar moves since
the competition began.
Cornell reportedly hired a lob
byist and a public relations firm for
its pitch, and University President
David Skorton made a pitch in a
July 11 You Tube video. Stanford
has hired public relations firm
Edelman and political consulting
firm Tusk and most recently had
Google co-founders Larry Page
M.S. '9B and Sergey Brin M.S. '95
expressing their support for Stan

ford's bid on Stanford's newTumblr
site.

Most importantly, both schools
have gained partners in their bids
since the initial proposals. Earlier
this month, Cornell declared that it
would partner with The Technion
Israel Institute of Technology. A
week before Cornell announced
the partnership, Stanford declared
the creation of "Stanford@CCNY,"
a collaboration with the City Uni
versity of New York (CUNY) and
City College of New York
(CCNY). If Stanford's proposal is
accepted, Stanford@CCNY will
offer joint CCNY-Stanford
B. A./M.S. and 8.5./ M.S. degree pro
grams, giving City College students
a unique opportunity to pursue an
advanced degree at Stanford as un
dergraduates.

"One of the evaluation criteria
is community engagement and
community outreach," said Stan
ford spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
"Our partnership with CCNY is
going to help us get a jumpstart on a
campus there and give us an aca
demic location while we build a new
campus."

Lapin noted that the collabora
tion with CCNY is "not directly re
lated" to Stanford's proposal, not
ing that New York's criteria does
not require a partnership with any
in-city organization. Lapin said the
collaboration would allow Stanford
to have faculty and students in New
York in 2013, before the permanent
facilities would be completed on
Roosevelt Island.

Hennessy sees the proposed
campus as a great opportunity for
not only Stanford and New York,
but also the entire nation.
"We are an American universi
ty, founded to do things for the
people and this country," Hen
nessy said in his joint interview
with Stanford new sources. "That's
certainly embedded in the Found
ing Grant language. I'm convinced
that this country's leadership posi
tion in science and technology will
be jeopardized if we cannot grow
more major institutions and pro
duce more graduates in science and
technology."

their bid for consideration; Pur
due, a public university, decided to
stop pursuing the applied sciences
campus in late September, citing
insufficient financial backing from
New York.
Cornell continues to be Stan
ford's main contender for the Roo
sevelt Island bid. The two universi
ties are widely considered to be the
favorites to be selected and have
been making similar moves since
the competition began.
Cornell reportedly hired a lob
byist and a public relations firm for
its pitch, and University President
David Skorton made a pitch in a
July 11 You Tube video. Stanford
has hired public relations firm
Edelman and political consulting
firm Tusk and most recently had
Google co-founders Larry Page
M.S. '9B and Sergey Brin M.S. '95
expressing their support for Stan

ford's bid on Stanford's newTumblr
site.

Most importantly, both schools
have gained partners in their bids
since the initial proposals. Earlier
this month, Cornell declared that it
would partner with The Technion
Israel Institute of Technology. A
week before Cornell announced
the partnership, Stanford declared
the creation of "Stanford@CCNY,"
a collaboration with the City Uni
versity of New York (CUNY) and
City College of New York
(CCNY). If Stanford's proposal is
accepted, Stanford@CCNY will
offer joint CCNY-Stanford
B. A./M.S. and 8.5./ M.S. degree pro
grams, giving City College students
a unique opportunity to pursue an
advanced degree at Stanford as un
dergraduates.

"One of the evaluation criteria
is community engagement and
community outreach," said Stan
ford spokesperson Lisa Lapin.
"Our partnership with CCNY is
going to help us get a jumpstart on a
campus there and give us an aca
demic location while we build a new
campus."

Lapin noted that the collabora
tion with CCNY is "not directly re
lated" to Stanford's proposal, not
ing that New York's criteria does
not require a partnership with any
in-city organization. Lapin said the
collaboration would allow Stanford
to have faculty and students in New
York in 2013, before the permanent
facilities would be completed on
Roosevelt Island.

Hennessy sees the proposed
campus as a great opportunity for
not only Stanford and New York,
but also the entire nation.
"We are an American universi
ty, founded to do things for the
people and this country," Hen
nessy said in his joint interview
with Stanford new sources. "That's
certainly embedded in the Found
ing Grant language. I'm convinced
that this country's leadership posi
tion in science and technology will
be jeopardized if we cannot grow
more major institutions and pro
duce more graduates in science and
technology."

"StanfordNYC" is expected to be home to over 200 faculty members and 2,000 graduate students. The new
campus will offer graduate programs in engineering, applied sciences, technology and entrepreneurship.
Stanford University submitted its proposal
on Wednesday to build a $2.5 billion, 1.9 mil
lion square-foot graduate school of applied
t sciences and engineering in New York City.
If the New York City Economic Develop
ment Corporation (NYCEDC) selects Stan
ford's proposal, the city will grant the Univer
t> sity land on Roosevelt Island and $lOO million

to develop its campus over the next 30 years.
Once completed, "StanfordNYC" is ex
pected to be home to more than 200 faculty
members and 2,000 graduate students study
ing engineering, applied sciences, technology
and entrepreneurship. The University is com
mitting an initial $2OO million toward Stan
fordNYC to cover startup costs and an initial
endowment for research. If the proposal is se-

If Stanford's proposal is accepted, the City of New York will grant the University
land on Roosevelt Island and $100 million to develop the campus over 30 years.
lected, Stanford will begin a $1.5
billion, 10-year fundraising cam
paign to finance the new campus
and its endowment.

"StanfordNYC will bring Stan
ford's unparalleled track record in
research, innovation and entrepre
neurship to New York City, the
world's capital of finance, arts and
culture," President John Hennessy
wrote in the submission letter to
New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg. "StanfordNYC has the
potential to help catapult New York
City into a leadership position in
technology, to enhance its entrepre
neurial endeavors and outcomes,
diversify its economic base, en
hance its talent pool and help our
nation maintain its global lead in
science and technology."
The school will have an empha
sis on transferring discoveries to the
marketplace, as it is expected to
serve as a catalyst for new jobs in
New York.

If StanfordNYC can produce
just 50 percent of the Stanford start
ups in Silicon Valley, over 100,000
new jobs could be created in the
first 20 to 30 years on Roosevelt Is
land, University officials said in a
press release Wednesday. They also
claimed that Silicon Valley venture
capitalists have indicated they
would follow Stanford to New
York.

A faculty committee designed
StanfordNYC's academic program,
which will focus heavily on pro
grams in engineering, computer sci
ence, entrepreneurship, graduate
business and technology manage
ment.

"We can create a community of
scholars in an entirely new environ
ment, generating the next wave of
ideas and breakthroughs," said Jim
Plummer, dean of Stanford's
School of Engineering, in the press
announcement. "Innovation hap
pens when you are challenged by
new problems and look at solutions
from new perspectives. Our faculty
is very excited about the possibili
ties of New York City."
Hennessy noted that he sees the
program expanding over the years
to the undergraduate population.
"Over time, we can also develop
programs for undergraduates in
New York," Hennessy said in a late
September joint interview with the
Stanford Report, Stanford maga

zine and The Daily. "1 can imagine a
program potentially larger than our
Washington, D.C. program or any
of our overseas programs where
students can spend a quarter or
more in the city. The cultural rich
ness of New York in the visual
arts, drama, music offers benefits
both to students and to the depart
ments here on campus."

This submission marks the be
ginning of the final stage of a year
long process. Bloomberg and the
NYCEDC launched Applied Sci
ences NYC last December with a
request for proposals (RFP).
Hennessy discussed the idea
with the Faculty Senate and led
Stanford in submitting a formal
"expression of interest" in March; a
New York campus was also the cen
ter of focus in April's Academic
Council meeting.
In July, Bloomberg requested
specific plans from the 27 institu
tions and others that met certain
criteria that responded to the
RFP. Since then, Stanford has been
working on its formal submission: a
600-page proposal that includes de
tailed academic, financial, design
and legal documents. The Board of
Trustees approved the proposal in a
meeting early this month.
Final proposals are due by Fri
day; after that point, NYC officials
will begin the process of review.
Stanford officials are expecting
to travel to New York City after
Thanksgiving to discuss the propos
al. The city plans to make a decision
by the end of the year.
However, there has been specu
lation that Bloomberg may end up
picking multiple winners. Columbia
University and New York Universi
ty have proposed increasing the size
and scope of their existing pro
grams in the city, while Carnegie
Mellon University is proposing a
school in Brooklyn. Since none of
these proposals involve Roosevelt
Island, there is the possibility that
the city could award Roosevelt Is
land to one group and a second site
to another group.
"I want a new player here," said
NYU President John Sexton to
Crains New York. "I've been en
couraging Stanford since February
to come into this. I'm delighted Cor
nell is in this. We have different
ideas that aren't in competition
with each other. They complement
each other."

One potential complication to
awarding multiple schools the $lOO
million and land grant is Bloomberg's
term, which expires in 2013.
Bloomberg's administration has

moved very quickly to select a school
in just one year to break ground while
Bloomberg is still in office. Accom
plishing this with two different
groups could prove difficult.
Many of the 27 institutions that
expressed interest have dropped
their bid for consideration; Pur
due, a public university, decided to

insufficient financial backing from
