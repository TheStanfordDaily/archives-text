## Glaseroff to head new clinic in 2012 Stanford clinic will specialize in treating chronic diseases 
### ROBIN CHIN 
Stanford will soon be home to a brand new
clinic aiming to revolutionize primary health
care. Starting April 1, 2012, a comprehensive
team of medical professionals will open a clin
ic specializing in the care of chronic diseases.
Dr. Alan Glaseroff has relocated to Stan
ford to serve as the clinic's medical director.
His wife, Dr. Ann Lindsay will also work in the
new clinic.
The clinic aims to target chronic diseases
that are often poorly managed by traditional
methods of healthcare. These include illnesses
like diabetes, heart failure, asthma and hyper
tension. Stanford hopes to improve disease

management by closely monitoring patients
and offering unprecedented access to physi
cians.
"Our work force will emphasize that our
relationship with the patient is a continuous
one," Glaseroff said.
He added that the clinic will use unusual
methods to sustain relationships with patients

and track progress. These include home visits
by physicians, round-the-clock nurse avail
ability and advocates who accompany pa
tients on visits to outside specialists.
"We're advancing a much more coordinat
ed model of care," Glaseroff said.

The new clinic will target chronic diseases that are often poorly managed by traditional forms
of healthcare. These diseases include diabetes, heart failure, asthma and hypertension.
Glaseroff and Lindsay are
renowned for their work on the pri
mary care system in rural Hum
boldt County in Northern Califor
nia. Since 1983, they have been re
sponsible for managing their own
clinic and coordinating county
physicians under a single system.
Glaseroff and Lindsay implement
ed a chronic-care model, devel
oped in Seattle, aimed at improving
the health of patients with serious,
long-term illnesses. In Humboldt
County alone, the number of
deaths from diabetes has de
creased by 29 percent since 2003.
According to Glaseroff, the in
tervention aspect of his chronic
care model creates a win-win situa
tion. Patients with chronic illnesses
often need the most expensive
treatments. By aggressively treat
ing chronic disease, patient health
is improved and healthcare costs
go down.
"It's been said that 30 percent of
money spent on chronic illnesses
doesn't need to be spent if you do a
good job," Glaseroff said. He hopes
this model will empower the pri
mary care system to meet patient
needs while improving the state of
healthcare in America.
"This is what the country des
perately needs in terms of health
reform. We are providing a blue
print to inform the national health
discussion," he said.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the
Stanford School of Medicine,
hopes the clinic can help manage
costs and improve coordination
among service care providers.
"Individuals with chronic dis
eases have multiple medical condi
tions leading them to see multiple
care providers," Pizzo wrote in an
email to The Daily. "That can lead
to fragmentation, redundancy and
adverse effects."
Pizzo stated that a more com
prehensive effort on the primary
care side prevents unnecessary use
of specialty or emergency care.
Glaseroff is not alone in his
quest to reform primary care. Stan
ford School of Medicine's Clinical
Excellence Research Center
(CERC) has been heading re

search on how to improve health
care and promote reductions in
spending. The center develops and
tests healthcare system interven
tions. One of its projects includes
the assessment of telemedicine, a
method by which technology can
allow doctors to reach patients
from remote or distant locations.
Dr. Arnold Milstein is the direc
tor of the CERC and was responsi
ble for recruiting Glaseroff to di
rect the new clinic. Milstein's work
on the concept of an ambulatory, or
non-hospital based, intensive care
unit model will form the basis for
the clinic. This means that the staff
will be a team with different spe
cialties and will thus be able to
treat multiple aspects of patient
health.

Glaseroff hopes to take this
model and tailor it to the needs of
chronically ill patients by using the
methods he has successfully imple
mented in Humboldt. He empha
sized the need to treat the whole
patient, not just the disease. For in
stance, many patients with chronic
diseases such as diabetes or high
blood pressure also suffer from so
cial isolation, depression or hope
lessness. He said treating these is
sues of emotional wellness are just
as if not more important than
treating the disease.
"We're reducing isolation and
hopelessness so people feel em
powered to take control of their
lives," Glaseroff said.
The clinic will initially serve em
ployees of Stanford Hospital &
Clinics in a temporary location on
Welch Road. Eventually the clinic
will move to its permanent home in
the newly remodeled Hoover
Pavilion.
As the clinic becomes more es
tablished, Glaseroff hopes to see
expansion throughout Silicon Val
ley by working with preexisting
healthcare providers, such as Palo
Alto Medical Foundation or
Kaiser. He stressed the need to co
operate with systems already in
place.

"Patients' needs are what drive
our decisions, not what turf we
stand on or what organization we
work for," Glaseroff said. "We're
aiming for the perfect model that
can work in the real world."

His wife, Dr. Ann Lindsay will also work in the
new clinic.
The clinic aims to target chronic diseases
that are often poorly managed by traditional
methods of healthcare. These include illnesses
like diabetes, heart failure, asthma and hyper
tension. Stanford hopes to improve disease

management by closely monitoring patients
and offering unprecedented access to physi
cians.
"Our work force will emphasize that our
relationship with the patient is a continuous
one," Glaseroff said.
He added that the clinic will use unusual
methods to sustain relationships with patients

and track progress. These include home visits
by physicians, round-the-clock nurse avail
ability and advocates who accompany pa
tients on visits to outside specialists.
"We're advancing a much more coordinat
ed model of care," Glaseroff said.

The new clinic will target chronic diseases that are often poorly managed by traditional forms
of healthcare. These diseases include diabetes, heart failure, asthma and hypertension.
Glaseroff and Lindsay are
renowned for their work on the pri
mary care system in rural Hum
boldt County in Northern Califor
nia. Since 1983, they have been re
sponsible for managing their own
clinic and coordinating county
physicians under a single system.
Glaseroff and Lindsay implement
ed a chronic-care model, devel
oped in Seattle, aimed at improving
the health of patients with serious,
long-term illnesses. In Humboldt
County alone, the number of
deaths from diabetes has de
creased by 29 percent since 2003.
According to Glaseroff, the in
tervention aspect of his chronic
care model creates a win-win situa
tion. Patients with chronic illnesses
often need the most expensive
treatments. By aggressively treat
ing chronic disease, patient health
is improved and healthcare costs
go down.
"It's been said that 30 percent of
money spent on chronic illnesses
doesn't need to be spent if you do a
good job," Glaseroff said. He hopes
this model will empower the pri
mary care system to meet patient
needs while improving the state of
healthcare in America.
"This is what the country des
perately needs in terms of health
reform. We are providing a blue
print to inform the national health
discussion," he said.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the
Stanford School of Medicine,
hopes the clinic can help manage
costs and improve coordination
among service care providers.
"Individuals with chronic dis
eases have multiple medical condi
tions leading them to see multiple
care providers," Pizzo wrote in an
email to The Daily. "That can lead
to fragmentation, redundancy and
adverse effects."
Pizzo stated that a more com
prehensive effort on the primary
care side prevents unnecessary use
of specialty or emergency care.
Glaseroff is not alone in his
quest to reform primary care. Stan
ford School of Medicine's Clinical
Excellence Research Center
(CERC) has been heading re

search on how to improve health
care and promote reductions in
spending. The center develops and
tests healthcare system interven
tions. One of its projects includes
the assessment of telemedicine, a
method by which technology can
allow doctors to reach patients
from remote or distant locations.
Dr. Arnold Milstein is the direc
tor of the CERC and was responsi
ble for recruiting Glaseroff to di
rect the new clinic. Milstein's work
on the concept of an ambulatory, or
non-hospital based, intensive care
unit model will form the basis for
the clinic. This means that the staff
will be a team with different spe
cialties and will thus be able to
treat multiple aspects of patient
health.

Glaseroff hopes to take this
model and tailor it to the needs of
chronically ill patients by using the
methods he has successfully imple
mented in Humboldt. He empha
sized the need to treat the whole
patient, not just the disease. For in
stance, many patients with chronic
diseases such as diabetes or high
blood pressure also suffer from so
cial isolation, depression or hope
lessness. He said treating these is
sues of emotional wellness are just
as if not more important than
treating the disease.
"We're reducing isolation and
hopelessness so people feel em
powered to take control of their
lives," Glaseroff said.
The clinic will initially serve em
ployees of Stanford Hospital &
Clinics in a temporary location on
Welch Road. Eventually the clinic
will move to its permanent home in
the newly remodeled Hoover
Pavilion.
As the clinic becomes more es
tablished, Glaseroff hopes to see
expansion throughout Silicon Val
ley by working with preexisting
healthcare providers, such as Palo
Alto Medical Foundation or
Kaiser. He stressed the need to co
operate with systems already in
place.

"Patients' needs are what drive
our decisions, not what turf we
stand on or what organization we
work for," Glaseroff said. "We're
aiming for the perfect model that
can work in the real world."
