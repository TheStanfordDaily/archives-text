## Glaseroff to head new clinic in 2012 Stanford clinic will specialize in treating chronic diseases 
### ROBIN CHIN 
Stanford will soon be home to a brand new
clinic aiming to revolutionize primary health
care. Starting April 1, 2012, a comprehensive
team of medical professionals will open a clin
ic specializing in the care of chronic diseases.
Dr. Alan Glaseroff has relocated to Stan
ford to serve as the clinic's medical director.
His wife, Dr. Ann Lindsay will also work in the
new clinic.
The clinic aims to target chronic diseases
that are often poorly managed by traditional
methods of healthcare. These include illnesses
like diabetes, heart failure, asthma and hyper
tension. Stanford hopes to improve disease

management by closely monitoring patients
and offering unprecedented access to physi
cians.
"Our work force will emphasize that our
relationship with the patient is a continuous
one," Glaseroff said.
He added that the clinic will use unusual
methods to sustain relationships with patients

and track progress. These include home visits
by physicians, round-the-clock nurse avail
ability and advocates who accompany pa
tients on visits to outside specialists.
"We're advancing a much more coordinat
ed model of care," Glaseroff said.
