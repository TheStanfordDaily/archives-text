## Simple Enroll modifies class enrollment Students and administrators comment on new system 
### ANTHONY DING 
The 2011-2012 academic year marked the
beginning of a new enrollment system called
Simple Enroll.
The system became active on Aug. 1 for
pre-autumn quarter enrollment. The release
of Simple Enroll came as a response to stu
dent criticism of the old enrollment system,
which could be accessed through Axess
under the Student Center tab.

"We'd gotten a lot of input from students
on things they didn't like," said Director of
Student Information Systems Linda Regan,
which was needed in the old sys
tem," said David Huynh 'l4.
At the end of August, the facul
ty was contacted on the subject of
the new enrollment process.

sual relationship. We think [enroll
ment jumped] because the inter

Black said.
In cases such as the record-set
ting enrollment in CSIO6A, Black
believes that while Simple Enroll
may have shared some responsibili

who worked on Simple Enroll.
"They couldn't see their schedules.
It was difficult to see when they
had time conflicts and they had a
lot of issues with the previous sys
tem, so we launched [SimpleEn
roll] as an alternate."
"[Students] still have the capa
bilities to use the original; but this
gives them some better features,"
Regan added.
"I was a bit apprehensive about
using the new system, [but] Sim
ple Enroll is just a lot quicker and
easier to use," said Rashaad Kazi
'l2. "It's more intuitive."

"We wanted them to be aware
that a significant number had en
rolled by the end of August. I be
lieve that we had around 85 per
cent of undergraduates," said As
sociate Vice Provost for Student
Affairs and University Registrar
Tom Black, who also worked on
Simple Enroll. "We wanted them to
be aware that people were already
setting their schedules, and if they
were to change times or affect the
class in some way, they were affect
ing peoples' schedules."
The use of Simple Enroll corre
sponded with quicker enrollment
for the fall quarter. "We did see a
jump, but we don't really know
whether something else is going
on. At this point, it looks like a ca-

Associate professor Mehran
Sahami, who teaches the fall quar
ter CSIO6A course, had a similar
response.

"We've had tremendous en
rollment growth in the CS depart
ment in the past few years, so our
experience with enrollment has
more to do with the rising num
bers than with Simple Enroll," Sa
hami said.

"Simple Enroll is easier because
it solely requires the class title, as
opposed to the course number,

In terms of whether Simple E
nroll has affected his enrollment
and class planning, Sahami be-

lieves that it has not had as great of
an effect on the professors.
"From the standpoint of a
course instructor, I haven't seen
much of a change as a result of
Simple Enroll. This seems to be an
application targeted more for stu
dents," Sahami said.

Simple Enroll was developed
entirely within Stanford and was
spearheaded by Black, Regan and
Sameer Marella, the director of
People Soft & Middleware and In
tegration Services. Marella and a
team of programmers developed
the software.

According to Marella, new fea
tures in the future seem unlikely.

Students have some criticisms of
and suggestions for Simple Enroll.
"I only came to use Simple E
nroll when I knew what classes I
wanted to enroll in," Kazi said, ex
plaining that he uses Explore-
Courses and Courseßank to select
courses before enrollment.
"Courseßank is much more useful
for planning your four years."
"If Simple Enroll had the same
features [as Explore Courses and
Courseßank], I would just use
Simple Enroll," Kazi said.

"The first thing I noticed when
enrollment opened was that it was
extremely slow and I ended up just
enrolling in my Chemistry discus
sion section using the old enroll
ment process," said Jason Kung 'l5.
"It does not happen every quar
ter, but this quarter we did see a lot
more activity than we did previous
quarter. We are looking at taking
some steps to improve it," Marella
said.

"The problem always is you
don't know how many users come
in, and you can't size your infra
structure for 2,000 users all the
time; so expanding and contract
ing the infrastructure is the
biggest management challenge.
We're looking at making some
changes for the next quarter,"
Marella said.

Black said he expected the rush
to be slower for enrollment in the
winter quarter, which opens Oct.
30, due to the fact that it is required
for all freshmen and sophomores
to see their pre-major advisors be
fore enrolling in classes.
