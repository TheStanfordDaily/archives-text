### ANTHONY DING 
The 2011-2012 academic year marked the
beginning of a new enrollment system called
Simple Enroll.
The system became active on Aug. 1 for
pre-autumn quarter enrollment. The release
of Simple Enroll came as a response to stu

which could be accessed through Axess
under the Student Center tab.

"We'd gotten a lot of input from students
on things they didn't like," said Director of
Student Information Systems Linda Regan,
