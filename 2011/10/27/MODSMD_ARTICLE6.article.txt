## Faculty weigh in on Colonel Qaddafi's death Scholars discuss implications for Libya's democratic future 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Libya's National Transitional Council
(NTC) declared the liberation of Libya on
Oct. 23 following the Oct. 20 capture and
death of military dictator Colonel Muam
mar el-Qaddafi.

Qaddafi's death marks the end of Libya's
six-month civil war, which was preceded by
mass protests that started this February.
Hoover Institution professors and re
searchers recently weighed in on the impact
of Qaddafi's death and the challenging fu
ture of Libya.
Qaddafi's 42-year rule ended in August
when rebel fighters captured the Libyan
capital of Tripoli. Qaddafi's violent last mo
ments were captured in a cellphone video, in
which he is seen injured and being beaten by
rebel captors. He joins Egyptian and
Tunisian former presidents Hosni Mubarak
and Zein El Abidine Ben Ali in the ranks of
leaders which popular protests of the Arab
Spring have deposed.
Qaddafi's violent demise, notably differ
ent in nature from Ben Ali's exile in Saudi
Arabia and Mubarak's trial, marks an inaus
picious beginning for the new state, accord
ing to Hoover senior fellow Larry Diamond.

"There's a tremendous sense of relief and
obvious exhilaration in most of Libya to the
fact that [Qaddafi] is gone, definitively gone,
and not coming back," Diamond said, liken
ing the euphoria seen in Libya to Iraq at
Saddam Hussein's 2003 capture,
"People knew that a very thick line had
been drawn between the past and the fu
ture," he added. "At the same time it
would've been much better if he could've
been tried with due process so he would've
been made to account for the crimes of the
past."

His death also raised concerns that sup
porters would claim him as a martyr for a
righteous cause.
"It has released Libyans from the under
standable fear [Qaddafi] might find away to
get back into power, which will be terrifical
ly liberating," wrote Hoover Institution re
search fellow Kori Schake in an email to The
Daily.
The declaration of liberation
constitutes the first step of a long
transition to come in the North
African nation.

"Even if some people see the
death of Qaddafi as the end of an
era, which it is ... the more crucial
question is that it signals the begin
ning of an even more challenging
period in Libyan history," said Lina
Khatib, manager of the Program on
Arab Reform and Democracy at
the Center for Democracy, Devel
opment and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL).
The NTC, which has gained
recognition as the official represen
tative of the Libyan people by the
United Nations and 100 countries,
will govern with an interim constitu
tion. According to its August Con
stitutional Declaration, the council
will facilitate the country's transi
tion to a constitutional democracy
with an elected government. The
new regime however faces a pletho
ra of challenges, foremost of which
is the lack of infrastructure in Libya.
Qaddafi's rule silenced voices,
leading to an absence of political
parties and civil society, according
to Khatib. This makes it difficult for
the NTC to form a representative
government.

"One way around [the problem]
is to make use of the existing tribal

system in Libya by making sure that
the tribes have representation
somehow," Khatib said. "But it's
going to be a period of trial and
error."

The infrastructural challenges,
combined with demands to move to
elections quickly, create a fragile sit
uation.

"There are simultaneous pres
sures to hold elections and move to
a democratic government that has .
.. legitimacy via elections ... and
the [pressure of the] institutional
vacuum where trying to go to elec
tions, allowing parties to start to de
velop and campaign will take
time," said James Fearon, senior
fellow at Freeman Spogli Institute
(FSI).

NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdul
Jalil declared in a Sunday rally that
Libya will adopt Islamic Sharia as
the main source for its law, render
ing all laws that conflict with Sharia
legally ineffective. While Sharia
law can be and is interpreted mod
erately in many Muslim countries,
the step to change the law was
taken in advance of any democrat
ic process.

"In saying they [the Libyan peo
ple] wanted to be liberated from
tyranny, they were also saying that
they want democracy," Diamond
said. "But it's got to be carefully
crafted so that different groups can
coexist with one another and share
power and so that there is a viable
competitive process."

President Barack Obama
claimed in an interview with Jay

Leno on Tuesday of this week that
Qaddafi's death "sends a strong mes
sage around the world to dictators."
But according to Diamond, this
message is not necessarily comple
mentary to the demands of protes
tors against Bashar al-Assad in
Syria and Ali Abdullah Saleh in
Yemen. The manner of Qaddafi's
death may create obstacles in talks
for negotiated exits for other Arab
tyrants.

"This just has to reinforce
not only by the fact that Qaddafi
was captured but by the gruesome,
vengeful way that it happened
the instinct of virtually every Arab
autocrat to hang onto power until
the death because now they know
what could happen," Diamond
said, mentioning the "horrific" dis
play of Qaddafi's corpse.
Despite other Arab dictators
taking cues from Libya's revolu
tion, Libya may not find itself fol
lowing the same path as neighbors
such as Tunisia, where elections
have recently taken place, and
Egypt.
"Libya has a greater challenge
disarming and reintegrating militia
[and] a greater challenge unifying
disparate cities and tribal struc
tures," Schake said. "They also
have more money to splash around
once they get the oil industry back
on track, and the NTC looks to be
making very smart and unifying po
litical choices."

"It has released Libyans from the under
standable fear [Qaddafi] might find away to
get back into power, which will be terrifical
ly liberating," wrote Hoover Institution re
search fellow Kori Schake in an email to The
Daily.
The declaration of liberation
constitutes the first step of a long
transition to come in the North
African nation.

"Even if some people see the
death of Qaddafi as the end of an
era, which it is ... the more crucial
question is that it signals the begin
ning of an even more challenging
period in Libyan history," said Lina
Khatib, manager of the Program on
Arab Reform and Democracy at
the Center for Democracy, Devel
opment and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL).
The NTC, which has gained
recognition as the official represen
tative of the Libyan people by the
United Nations and 100 countries,
will govern with an interim constitu
tion. According to its August Con
stitutional Declaration, the council
will facilitate the country's transi
tion to a constitutional democracy
with an elected government. The
new regime however faces a pletho
ra of challenges, foremost of which
is the lack of infrastructure in Libya.
Qaddafi's rule silenced voices,
leading to an absence of political
parties and civil society, according
to Khatib. This makes it difficult for
the NTC to form a representative
government.

"One way around [the problem]
is to make use of the existing tribal

system in Libya by making sure that
the tribes have representation
somehow," Khatib said. "But it's
going to be a period of trial and
error."

The infrastructural challenges,
combined with demands to move to
elections quickly, create a fragile sit
uation.

"There are simultaneous pres
sures to hold elections and move to
a democratic government that has .
.. legitimacy via elections ... and
the [pressure of the] institutional
vacuum where trying to go to elec
tions, allowing parties to start to de
velop and campaign will take
time," said James Fearon, senior
fellow at Freeman Spogli Institute
(FSI).

NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdul
Jalil declared in a Sunday rally that
Libya will adopt Islamic Sharia as
the main source for its law, render
ing all laws that conflict with Sharia
legally ineffective. While Sharia
law can be and is interpreted mod
erately in many Muslim countries,
the step to change the law was
taken in advance of any democrat
ic process.

"In saying they [the Libyan peo
ple] wanted to be liberated from
tyranny, they were also saying that
they want democracy," Diamond
said. "But it's got to be carefully
crafted so that different groups can
coexist with one another and share
power and so that there is a viable
competitive process."

President Barack Obama
claimed in an interview with Jay

Leno on Tuesday of this week that
Qaddafi's death "sends a strong mes
sage around the world to dictators."
But according to Diamond, this
message is not necessarily comple
mentary to the demands of protes
tors against Bashar al-Assad in
Syria and Ali Abdullah Saleh in
Yemen. The manner of Qaddafi's
death may create obstacles in talks
for negotiated exits for other Arab
tyrants.

"This just has to reinforce
not only by the fact that Qaddafi
was captured but by the gruesome,
vengeful way that it happened
the instinct of virtually every Arab
autocrat to hang onto power until
the death because now they know
what could happen," Diamond
said, mentioning the "horrific" dis
play of Qaddafi's corpse.
Despite other Arab dictators
taking cues from Libya's revolu
tion, Libya may not find itself fol
lowing the same path as neighbors
such as Tunisia, where elections
have recently taken place, and
Egypt.
"Libya has a greater challenge
disarming and reintegrating militia
[and] a greater challenge unifying
disparate cities and tribal struc
tures," Schake said. "They also
have more money to splash around
once they get the oil industry back
on track, and the NTC looks to be
making very smart and unifying po
litical choices."

Libya's National Transitional Council
(NTC) declared the liberation of Libya on
Oct. 23 following the Oct. 20 capture and
death of military dictator Colonel Muam
mar el-Qaddafi.

Qaddafi's death marks the end of Libya's
six-month civil war, which was preceded by
mass protests that started this February.
Hoover Institution professors and re
searchers recently weighed in on the impact
of Qaddafi's death and the challenging fu
ture of Libya.
Qaddafi's 42-year rule ended in August
when rebel fighters captured the Libyan
capital of Tripoli. Qaddafi's violent last mo
ments were captured in a cellphone video, in
which he is seen injured and being beaten by
rebel captors. He joins Egyptian and
Tunisian former presidents Hosni Mubarak
and Zein El Abidine Ben Ali in the ranks of
leaders which popular protests of the Arab
Spring have deposed.
Qaddafi's violent demise, notably differ
ent in nature from Ben Ali's exile in Saudi
Arabia and Mubarak's trial, marks an inaus
picious beginning for the new state, accord
ing to Hoover senior fellow Larry Diamond.

"There's a tremendous sense of relief and
obvious exhilaration in most of Libya to the
fact that [Qaddafi] is gone, definitively gone,
and not coming back," Diamond said, liken
ing the euphoria seen in Libya to Iraq at
Saddam Hussein's 2003 capture,
"People knew that a very thick line had
been drawn between the past and the fu
ture," he added. "At the same time it
would've been much better if he could've
been tried with due process so he would've
been made to account for the crimes of the
past."

His death also raised concerns that sup
porters would claim him as a martyr for a
righteous cause.
"It has released Libyans from the under
standable fear [Qaddafi] might find away to
get back into power, which will be terrifical
ly liberating," wrote Hoover Institution re
