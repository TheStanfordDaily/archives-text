## Faculty weigh in on Colonel Qaddafi's death Scholars discuss implications for Libya's democratic future 
### MARWA FARAG DESK EDITOR 
Libya's National Transitional Council
(NTC) declared the liberation of Libya on
Oct. 23 following the Oct. 20 capture and
death of military dictator Colonel Muam
mar el-Qaddafi.

Qaddafi's death marks the end of Libya's
six-month civil war, which was preceded by
mass protests that started this February.
Hoover Institution professors and re
searchers recently weighed in on the impact
of Qaddafi's death and the challenging fu
ture of Libya.
Qaddafi's 42-year rule ended in August
when rebel fighters captured the Libyan
capital of Tripoli. Qaddafi's violent last mo
ments were captured in a cellphone video, in
which he is seen injured and being beaten by
rebel captors. He joins Egyptian and
Tunisian former presidents Hosni Mubarak
and Zein El Abidine Ben Ali in the ranks of
leaders which popular protests of the Arab
Spring have deposed.
Qaddafi's violent demise, notably differ
ent in nature from Ben Ali's exile in Saudi
Arabia and Mubarak's trial, marks an inaus
picious beginning for the new state, accord
ing to Hoover senior fellow Larry Diamond.

"There's a tremendous sense of relief and
obvious exhilaration in most of Libya to the
fact that [Qaddafi] is gone, definitively gone,
and not coming back," Diamond said, liken
ing the euphoria seen in Libya to Iraq at
Saddam Hussein's 2003 capture,
"People knew that a very thick line had
been drawn between the past and the fu
ture," he added. "At the same time it
would've been much better if he could've
been tried with due process so he would've
been made to account for the crimes of the
past."

His death also raised concerns that sup
porters would claim him as a martyr for a
righteous cause.
"It has released Libyans from the under
standable fear [Qaddafi] might find away to
get back into power, which will be terrifical
ly liberating," wrote Hoover Institution re
search fellow Kori Schake in an email to The
Daily.
