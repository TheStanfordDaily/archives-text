## Mittal and Mousseau discuss land acquisition 
### JUDITH PELPOLA 
Anuradha Mittal and Frederic
Mousseau of the Oakland Institute
spoke Wednesday evening about
farmland investment in the south
ern hemisphere at an event hosted
at the Black Community Services
Center.

Mittal and Mousseau are the
executive director and policy di
rector, respectively, at the Oak
land Institute, a local policy think
tank. Particular emphasis was
given to current "land grab" deals
in Ethiopia and other African
countries, which threaten to dis
place hundreds of thousands of
people.
Isabella Akker 'l3 began plan
ning the talk this past summer and
contacted the Oakland Institute for
their expertise. The event was
headed by the ASSU Food Cabinet
and co-sponsored by the Freeman
Spogli Institute (FSI).

"It's a matter of awareness,"
Akker said.

Akker added that many stu
dents from the University go on
into investment and hedge fund
management and should thus be
aware of "what investment in agri
culture can involve."

Large scale land acquisition in
volves countries with large popula
tions, such as China, South Korea
and India, buying productive farm
land in the southern hemisphere,
namely South America and Africa,
to farm their food.
The event started with a video
about the current situation of
African farmland, showing inter
views of local farmers who had
been told to dismantle their homes
and vacate the land. They were un
aware of the land grab deals until
an Oakland Institute report sur
faced in June,

The report found that the land
was rented out at 25 cents per acre
and that leases spanned up to 99
years. Comparable land prices in
Europe and America were in the
thousands of dollars per acre.
Mittal described the land grab
situation in Tanzania, where U.S. in
vestors, including Tom Harkin, an
lowa senator, bought large
amounts of land. Soil sampling and
other tests were done by lowa State
University.

After the Oakland Institute re
port in June, lowa State began in
vestigations into its role in facilitat

ing the land deal. Residents of the
bought land were refugees from
Burundi who lived on the land for
over 40 years. They were promised
citizenship in return for vacating
the land. Approximately 160,000
people were affected.

Similar land deals have oc
curred in Sudan, Zambia and pri
marily Ethiopia, where 13 million
people are now dependent on food
aid. The government of Ethiopia
plans on selling an additional seven
million hectares of land.

"Food goes in and food goes
out," Mittal said.
Mousseau spoke about the
"myth of development." During
the land acquisition process, in
vestors held community meetings
with the local farmers, promising
education, food and water. No offi
cial contracts were produced from
the meetings.
"You've all seen Avatar,"
Mousseau said. "That's what these
people are facing today."

Mousseau claimed that there is
greater potential in countries in
vesting in their lands rather than
selling them.
"We've seen the farmers' ability
to improve productivity," he said.

Mittal and Mousseau both
brought up University investment
in the land acquisitions of South
American and Africa. According
to Mittal and Mousseau, Harvard
made a recent large investment in
a land acquisition deal in Africa.
Harvard's finance club is meeting
in November to discuss the issue.
Other universities with investment
in land acquisition include Vander
bilt and Johns Hopkins.
Mittal also encouraged atten
dees to write letters to companies
like Agri Sol that are involved with
land acquisition. She stated thou
sands of letters have been sent to
the prime minister of Tanzania and
to U.S. senators regarding the Tan
zania land grab deal, including one
from the Sierra Club on behalf of
its members.
Both Mittal and Mousseau em
phasized the importance of student
involvement. Mittal particularly
stressed increasing awareness of
the deals and who exactly is in
volved.

"Keep shining the light," she
said.
