## PROFILE Truth in the margins 
### LINDA YU 
A decade after graduat
ing from Stanford,
Daniel Orozco '79
was at a crossroads -
sticking with a job he
was less than thrilled about or re
turning back to school to be
writer.
Orozco took a risk and chose
the latter, acknowledging to him
self that the decision, for better
or for worse, would be life-chang
ing.
"It was a last chance thing,"
Orozco said. "Eleven years after
graduating from Stanford, I was
working in an office, and I didn't
like my job or what I was doing. I
was a fairly unhappy person. But
for some reason, I found solace in
creating this story I was writing."
At age 32, Orozco began
working toward a master's de
gree at San Francisco State Uni
versity. Fie later received a Mas
ter of Fine Arts from the Univer
sity of Washington.
Since then, Orozco's work has
been published in multiple short
story anthologies and magazines,
including "The Best American
Short Stories," "The Pushcart
Prize Anthology" and Harper's
Magazine. His pieces were also
compiled and published in a col
lection titled "Orientation and
Other Stories" earlier this May.
"Orientation," the eponymous
work in which Orozco character
izes an office setting through
snapshots of the employees, is his
first published story.
Orozco's foray into writing,
however late in his life, is off to a

promising start.
On Oct. 25, Orozco along with
nine other writers, travelled to
New York City to receive the
2011 Whiting Writers' Awards.
The awards, valued at $50,000,
are a prestigious distinction for
emerging writers.
Orozco started off writing
short stories "because they were
short" and has primarily re
mained loyal to the genre.
"At first, I didn't think I had
enough story in me for a novel,"
he said. "But I now know short
stories are a hard, exacting, pre
cise, demanding and exhilarating
narrative form. They hold a mo
ment of life and experience in a
brief span, engaging that mo
ment in half an hour to 40 min
utes."
Within his stories, Orozco is
committed to highlighting topics
traditionally deemed uninterest
ing or insignificant.
"A lot of the stories for me are
about lives on the boundaries
and margins - they're about peo
ple who don't really seem to mat
ter," he said. "I want them to mat
ter in these stories."
While Orozco did not intend
to present a common thread
through his work, he has noticed
that many of them concern the
theme of loneliness.
"For me, it's a narrative chal
lenge to write about the simple
struggle of being alone," he said.
"I don't do people in relation
ships, like families or marriages."
Orozco also doesn't write au
tobiographically, but instead
lends his personality to his works by
creating characters that engage the
world in the ways he would.
"Writing is transformation, not
transcription," he said. "It's about
manufacturing an experience and
making it seem real. I have a sense
of a character, and I put that charac
ter into a situation that I may have
never been in. For example, in 'Only
Connect,' someone gets mugged, so
I had to imagine how I would react
to someone sticking a gun in my
belly."

Often, Orozco's creative process
stems from personal observations
or experiences, and he allows his
ideas to simmer in his mind. One
such example is the inspiration be
hind Orozco's "Officers Weep," a
story about a love affair told
through police blotters.

"I was on a train ride from Red
wood City to Stanford, and I was
reading a newspaper when the po
lice blotters caught my eye," he said.
"I took note of the fact that they tell
you what happened while telling
you nothing about what happened
and decided that I could do some
thing with that."
Another time, Orozco went to As
toria, Wash., and his negative impres
sions of the town became the seed for
a story within "Only Connect."
"I had gone to a wedding there,
and I had a terrible time I was in
the motel room for two days," he
said. "Usually, a bad time is what
gets a story going. I think there's a

basic rule of dramatic writing that is
always true only trouble is inter
esting, even if it's the smallest thing,
like a stuck photocopier at work.
You can't write about someone
having a great time because dra
matically, nothing happened on that
day."

Orozco's ability to sculpt stories
and convey characters' personas
has come from much time dedicat
ed toward improving his writing,
and he said there are times during
the writing process he finds very
difficult to work through.

"l'm a slow and fairly unhappy
writer," he said. "I don't like 80 per
cent of the writing process. It feels
like a struggle, working against pro
crastination and my own inability to
do the work. But, the 20 percent
that I love makes that 80 percent
worthwhile. When it's clicking,
there's nothing like it."
In addition to his writing career,
Orozco is also an assistant profes
sor at the University of Idaho,
where he teaches fiction writing.
"I want to be able to always un
derstand how writing works," he

said. "Teaching keeps me in that
mode. I like having to talk about it,
articulate it and engage people in it.
I think that's important."
Orozco is also working on finish
ing a novel, a writing project he
started years ago but never fin-

ished.
"I worked on a novel because
conventional wisdom is that short
stories don't sell," he said. "My next
obligation is to finish it."
