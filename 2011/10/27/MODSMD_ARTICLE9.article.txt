## PROFILE Truth in the margins 
### LINDA YU 
A decade after graduat
ing from Stanford,
Daniel Orozco '79
was at a crossroads -
sticking with a job he
was less than thrilled about or re
turning back to school to be
writer.
Orozco took a risk and chose
the latter, acknowledging to him
self that the decision, for better
or for worse, would be life-chang
ing.
"It was a last chance thing,"
Orozco said. "Eleven years after
graduating from Stanford, I was
working in an office, and I didn't
like my job or what I was doing. I
was a fairly unhappy person. But
for some reason, I found solace in
creating this story I was writing."
At age 32, Orozco began
working toward a master's de
gree at San Francisco State Uni
versity. Fie later received a Mas
ter of Fine Arts from the Univer
sity of Washington.
Since then, Orozco's work has
been published in multiple short
story anthologies and magazines,
including "The Best American
Short Stories," "The Pushcart
Prize Anthology" and Harper's
Magazine. His pieces were also
compiled and published in a col
lection titled "Orientation and
Other Stories" earlier this May.
"Orientation," the eponymous
work in which Orozco character
izes an office setting through
snapshots of the employees, is his
first published story.
Orozco's foray into writing,
however late in his life, is off to a

promising start.
On Oct. 25, Orozco along with
nine other writers, travelled to
New York City to receive the
2011 Whiting Writers' Awards.
The awards, valued at $50,000,
are a prestigious distinction for
emerging writers.
Orozco started off writing
short stories "because they were
short" and has primarily re
mained loyal to the genre.
"At first, I didn't think I had
enough story in me for a novel,"
he said. "But I now know short
stories are a hard, exacting, pre
cise, demanding and exhilarating
narrative form. They hold a mo
ment of life and experience in a
brief span, engaging that mo
ment in half an hour to 40 min
utes."
Within his stories, Orozco is
committed to highlighting topics
traditionally deemed uninterest
ing or insignificant.
"A lot of the stories for me are
about lives on the boundaries
and margins - they're about peo
ple who don't really seem to mat
ter," he said. "I want them to mat
ter in these stories."
While Orozco did not intend
to present a common thread
through his work, he has noticed
that many of them concern the
theme of loneliness.
"For me, it's a narrative chal
lenge to write about the simple
struggle of being alone," he said.
"I don't do people in relation
ships, like families or marriages."
Orozco also doesn't write au
tobiographically, but instead
