## Iranian rockers react to govt oppression 
### JAMIE KIM 
Members of the Iranian elec
tronic rock band The Casualty
Process, which gained international
notoriety from its previous project
"The Plastic Wave" for featuring a
female lead singer, spoke on cam
pus Thursday about being censored
and suppressed by Iranian religious
authorities.

Hosted by Atheists, Humanists
and Agnostics (AHA!) at the
Bechtel International Center as
sembly room, the band played an
hour-long concert before partici
pating in a question-and-answer
session.

In 2006, after Mahmoud Ah
madinejad took power in Iran, rock
music was banned and under
ground music studios were forced
to shut down. Saeid "Natch" Nad
jafi and Shayan Amini saw that
their garage band had reached a
dead end.

The next year, Nadjafi and
Amini planned an underground
rock concert for 200 people in
Tehran, Iran, where they lived. To
their surprise, 700 people mostly
uninvited showed up.

"We lost control," Amini said.
The Iranian authorities soon ar
rived, and about 200 people were
arrested; the others ran. Nadjafi
and Amini, as well as their female
lead singer, Maral Afsharian, were
imprisoned for 15 days and fined
the Iranian equivalent of $50,000.
"Unfortunately they labeled us
as Satanists," Amini said with a
smile, to the audience's laughter.
After being released from
prison, they wanted to continue
making music, but found few avail
able options.
"The only thing I had at the time
was my computer, so I thought it
would be a good time to make elec-
Tronic music," Nadjafi said. Thus,
The Plastic Wave was born.
The three bandmates rehearsed
in private because they were not au
thorized to perform in public, main
ly because of Afsharian's gender.
The songs were not in themselves
politically controversial, but in Iran,
where female vocalists are taboo,
the authorities still found more than
enough grounds for condemnation.
If anything, their notoriety back
home gave them an edge that made
them a more attractive band in the
United States. In 2009, The Plastic
Wave was invited to the renowned
South by Southwest (SXSW) music
festival in Austin, Texas, which at
tracts more than 30,000 attendees.
They were unable to attend howev
er because their applications for
U.S. travel visas were denied.

Nevertheless, another opportu
nity soon presented itself when

their music reached Austin Dacey,
who, through his foundation Im
possible Music, organized a concert
to introduce The Plastic Wave to a
Brooklyn audience. In March 2010,
a counterpart band performed The
Plastic Wave's music in a Brooklyn
theatre. From Iran, through Skype,
the band members watched an
American band perform their
songs. Afterward members of the
audience stormed an empty stage
to chat with them.

"It gave me a lot of energy,"
Nadjafi said.
Amini and Nadjafi spoke about
almost losing hope living in Iran.
"It seems you're trying for noth
ing," Nadjafi said. "All you can get is
negative energies from every
where. Me and Shayan have been
working together for 10 years...we
have wanted to quit more than 50
times."

Nadjafi and Amini also spoke
about the reception of non-tradi
tional music like their own by the
general population in Tehran.

"We have our audiences in
Iran," Nadjafi said. "I don't know

why, but if you listen to the kind of
music Iranians listen to, they are so
modern ... If you produce some
thing great, they find you easily. In
Iran, we have some great friends
and fans that are following us."
He added, "I think a great exam
ple is the concert. We planned for
200 people. 700 came. We didn't in
vite them."

The event made some audience
members appreciate their own
rights.

"I think it shows how fortunate
we are to have the First Amend
ment and the right to express our
selves," said Lewis Marshall, a grad
uate student in he Chemical Engi
neering department who attended
the event.

Amini said the group's next step
is to seek asylum, as the members'
visas will expire in three weeks. In
the meantime, they said they plan to
tour in several other cities in Cali
fornia, including Santa Barbara and
Los Angeles.
