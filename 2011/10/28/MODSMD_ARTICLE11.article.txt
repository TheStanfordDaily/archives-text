## Cyberwar begins to gain ground As technologies advance, nations must draft new boundaries 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
The Stuxnet virus that successfully crippled
Iran's nuclear weapons program in June 2010 was
a confirmation and demonstration of the increas
ing abilities and sophistication of cyberwarfare
tactics, according to University sources familiar
with the subject.

Eran Kahana, a fellow at the Stanford Center
for Computers and the Law, described the Stuxnet
attack as unique in its complexity. The virus is
"cleverer than anything we've ever seen," he said,
adding that the attack utilized "unprecedented
target acquisition."

Stuxnet targeted Siemens Industry, Inc. indus
trial equipment most commonly used in the urani
um enrichment processes.The virus used four pre
viously unknown flaws in the Windows operating
system to reprogram the equipment, and is con
sidered to have set back Iran's nuclear program by
five years. The virus' objective was so clearly de
fined to the point that it seems "very unlikely that
it was designed to do anything else," according to
Kahana.

Professor John Mitchell of the Computer Sci
ence Department said that Stuxnet marked a new
breed of viruses, as it was designed to attack phys
ical infrastructures rather than obtain information
from the target system, and because it showed the
extent to which complex systems such as Iran's
nuclear program are vulnerable to concerted,
determined and well-resourced attacks.

While the complexity of the virus would com
plicate attempts to replicate Stuxnet, Mitchell said
that the virus' reproduction and adaptation would
be "possible with only limited resources." In re
cent months, several examples of malicious soft
ware that shared coding and behavioral character
istics with Stuxnet have been uncovered.

Kahana noted that the complexity and objec
tive of the virus made it likely that Stuxnet's cre
ators had at least co-operated with nation-states
and that they may have been implementing
state policy. Western nations such as the United
States, United Kingdom and Israel currently pos
sess the most advanced cyberwarfare capabilities
with intelligence agencies in these countries
frequently collaborating on cyber tactics but
competing nations, such as China and Russia, have
been quick to invest heavily in the field.

Both China and Russia have been accused of
deploying cyberwarfare tactics against foreign
governments, with Russia allegedly launching a
2007 cyberattack on Estonia that crippled not only
government systems but also private entities, such
as banks and newspapers.

The Pentagon announced in May 2011 that cy
berattacks against the United States would be
considered acts of war, against which the United
States could retaliate fully. However, the U.S. gov
ernment is still formulating a comprehensive pol
icy towards cyberwarfare and has thus far publicly
focused on defensive measures. The existing poli
cy has "more to do with political views than [cur
rent] technologies," Mitchell said, who believes it
will inevitably be developed further.
Mitchell noted that the proliferation of cyber
warfare tactics might lead to widespread industri
al espionage initiated by private firms and nation
states alike, and the anonymity of cyberspace
might encourage states to leverage new resources
on behalf of domestic firms.

The recent discovery of a keylogger virus on
U.S. military drone control systems while ap
parently not an incident that endangers critical in
formation — demonstrates what some consider
to be underinvestment in cybersecurity by the
United States.

The virus records the communication between
drone pilots and troops on the ground; the servers
that control the drones, however, run disconnect
ed from the Internet, thus limiting the virus' abili
ty to disseminate any information it acquires. Mil
itary network specialists have not been able to re

move the virus, even after system-wide restarts
and memory erasure, which are likely caused by
self-regenerating measures programmed into the
virus and a lack of defensive mechanisms built
into the military systems.

The United States' vulnerability to cyberattack
remains to be seen, according to Mitchell. Even
with an advanced intelligence community seeking
to defeat cyberwarfare tactics, certain civilian sec
tors such as electricity and water supply net
works may be at particular risk of cyberattacks,
especially after the Stuxnet attack exposed vul
nerabilities that would allow malicious programs
to take control of physical equipment.
Complicating attempts to defend against cyber
attacks is the "evolving arms race" to find new
means of delivering viruses to target systems,
Mitchell said. While both the Stuxnet virus and the
keylogger virus found on drone networks were
likely introduced by flash drives, hackers continue
to find means of delivery designed to avoid de
fense mechanisms built into current systems.
Even as cybersabotage and cyberwarfare be
come more effective, governments struggle to de
fine to define acceptable cybertactics and targets.
"There are ongoing efforts to regulate cyber
warfare," Kahana said.

While cyberwarfare is likely to be more broad
ly utilized in the future, any such attacks suffer
from limitations of technology.
"Cyberwarfare doesn't directly kill people,"
Mitchell said. And thus, it may become more com-

Even if the United States pos
sesses the requisite capabilities to
mount a cyberattack, it may be un
willing to do so. Cyberattacks on the
Qaddafi regime as part of the
NATO intervention were rejected,
according to an Oct. 17 New York
Times story, on the ground that such
actions risked "breaking the glass
ceiling" on a new kind of warfare.
Additionally, the time required to
prepare such an attack and the risk
of disclosing America's cyberwar
fare capabilities may make such
forms of intervention unappealing.

Nevertheless, for cases such as
the Iranian nuclear program, cyber
warfare offers a "cleaner" option

one without the risk of collateral
damage for decision makers. Ka

as a model for future interventions,

tive of the virus made it likely that Stuxnet's cre
ators had at least co-operated with nation-states
and that they may have been implementing
state policy. Western nations such as the United
States, United Kingdom and Israel currently pos
sess the most advanced cyberwarfare capabilities
with intelligence agencies in these countries
frequently collaborating on cyber tactics but
competing nations, such as China and Russia, have
been quick to invest heavily in the field.

Both China and Russia have been accused of
deploying cyberwarfare tactics against foreign
governments, with Russia allegedly launching a
2007 cyberattack on Estonia that crippled not only
government systems but also private entities, such
as banks and newspapers.

The Pentagon announced in May 2011 that cy
berattacks against the United States would be
considered acts of war, against which the United
States could retaliate fully. However, the U.S. gov
ernment is still formulating a comprehensive pol
icy towards cyberwarfare and has thus far publicly
focused on defensive measures. The existing poli
cy has "more to do with political views than [cur
rent] technologies," Mitchell said, who believes it
will inevitably be developed further.
Mitchell noted that the proliferation of cyber
warfare tactics might lead to widespread industri
al espionage initiated by private firms and nation
states alike, and the anonymity of cyberspace
might encourage states to leverage new resources
on behalf of domestic firms.

The recent discovery of a keylogger virus on
U.S. military drone control systems while ap
parently not an incident that endangers critical in
formation — demonstrates what some consider
to be underinvestment in cybersecurity by the
United States.

The virus records the communication between
drone pilots and troops on the ground; the servers
that control the drones, however, run disconnect
ed from the Internet, thus limiting the virus' abili
ty to disseminate any information it acquires. Mil
itary network specialists have not been able to re

move the virus, even after system-wide restarts
and memory erasure, which are likely caused by
self-regenerating measures programmed into the
virus and a lack of defensive mechanisms built
into the military systems.

The United States' vulnerability to cyberattack
remains to be seen, according to Mitchell. Even
with an advanced intelligence community seeking
to defeat cyberwarfare tactics, certain civilian sec
tors such as electricity and water supply net
works may be at particular risk of cyberattacks,
especially after the Stuxnet attack exposed vul
nerabilities that would allow malicious programs
to take control of physical equipment.
Complicating attempts to defend against cyber
attacks is the "evolving arms race" to find new
means of delivering viruses to target systems,
Mitchell said. While both the Stuxnet virus and the
keylogger virus found on drone networks were
likely introduced by flash drives, hackers continue
to find means of delivery designed to avoid de
fense mechanisms built into current systems.
Even as cybersabotage and cyberwarfare be
come more effective, governments struggle to de
fine to define acceptable cybertactics and targets.
"There are ongoing efforts to regulate cyber
warfare," Kahana said.

While cyberwarfare is likely to be more broad
ly utilized in the future, any such attacks suffer
from limitations of technology.
"Cyberwarfare doesn't directly kill people,"
Mitchell said. And thus, it may become more com-

The Stuxnet virus that successfully crippled
Iran's nuclear weapons program in June 2010 was
a confirmation and demonstration of the increas
ing abilities and sophistication of cyberwarfare
tactics, according to University sources familiar
with the subject.

Eran Kahana, a fellow at the Stanford Center
for Computers and the Law, described the Stuxnet
attack as unique in its complexity. The virus is
"cleverer than anything we've ever seen," he said,
adding that the attack utilized "unprecedented
target acquisition."

Stuxnet targeted Siemens Industry, Inc. indus
trial equipment most commonly used in the urani
um enrichment processes.The virus used four pre
viously unknown flaws in the Windows operating
system to reprogram the equipment, and is con
sidered to have set back Iran's nuclear program by
five years. The virus' objective was so clearly de
fined to the point that it seems "very unlikely that
it was designed to do anything else," according to
Kahana.

Professor John Mitchell of the Computer Sci
ence Department said that Stuxnet marked a new
breed of viruses, as it was designed to attack phys
ical infrastructures rather than obtain information
from the target system, and because it showed the
extent to which complex systems such as Iran's
nuclear program are vulnerable to concerted,
determined and well-resourced attacks.

While the complexity of the virus would com
plicate attempts to replicate Stuxnet, Mitchell said
that the virus' reproduction and adaptation would
be "possible with only limited resources." In re
cent months, several examples of malicious soft
ware that shared coding and behavioral character
istics with Stuxnet have been uncovered.

Kahana noted that the complexity and objec
tive of the virus made it likely that Stuxnet's cre
ators had at least co-operated with nation-states
and that they may have been implementing
state policy. Western nations such as the United
States, United Kingdom and Israel currently pos
