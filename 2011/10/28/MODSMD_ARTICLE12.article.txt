### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Joe Mathews, a senior fellow at
the New America Foundation,
moderated a panel discussion on
the future of e-government in Cali
fornia Wednesday evening.
The event, called "Zocalo in
Palo Alto: Can Technology Save
California's Governments?," was
part of Zocalo Public Square's se
ries of public affairs fora which the
organization hosts nationwide. The
Stanford-based Bill Lane Center
for the American West and the New
America Foundation also helped
host the event.

Among the panelists was April
Manatt, a consultant and lead au

government work on electronic
communications entitled "Hear us

" Californians deserve and
should demand a basic level of
technology-driven service and en

Manatt and her co-authors wrote in
the report published this month.
The other panelists included
Dakin Sloss 'l2, executive director
of California Common Sense; Greg
Hermann, senior management ana
lyst for the Southern Californian

city of Carlsbad; Tim Bonnemann
with San Jose-based Intellitics; and
David B. Smith, executive director
of the National Conference on Citi

need for average people to be able
to easily communicate with their
elected leaders and suggested that
there is currently no way for this to
happen. His idea for more efficient
governance entails the use of online
technology to make budgetary and
other information available to resi
dents.

"My vision is that in 10 years
government in real-time will be
tracking everything it spends and
everything that it's bringing in, what
outcomes that's leading to and that
that will be streaming in real-time
onto servers that people outside of
government and inside of govern
ment can slice and dice it however
they want to see it," he said.
Manatt, who served as a legisla
tive assistant and held other posi
tions in California's government,
said that most people in govern
ment do want to use technology to
improve the way that local govern
ments deliver information and pro
vide services.

"Some people who've been in
government for decades upon
decades maybe don't have access to
