## Panel probes digital influence on Calif.govt 
### ANTHONY VASQUEZ 
Joe Mathews, a senior fellow at
the New America Foundation,
moderated a panel discussion on
the future of e-government in Cali
fornia Wednesday evening.
The event, called "Zocalo in
Palo Alto: Can Technology Save
California's Governments?," was
part of Zocalo Public Square's se
ries of public affairs fora which the
organization hosts nationwide. The
Stanford-based Bill Lane Center
for the American West and the New
America Foundation also helped
host the event.

Among the panelists was April
Manatt, a consultant and lead au
thor of a report on the status of local
government work on electronic
communications entitled "Hear us
Now?: A California Survey of Digi
tal Technology's Role in Civic En
gagement and Local Government."

" Californians deserve and
should demand a basic level of
technology-driven service and en
gagement, just as they do with ana
log government services as emer
gency response and sanitation,"
Manatt and her co-authors wrote in
the report published this month.
The other panelists included
Dakin Sloss 'l2, executive director
of California Common Sense; Greg
Hermann, senior management ana
lyst for the Southern Californian

city of Carlsbad; Tim Bonnemann
with San Jose-based Intellitics; and
David B. Smith, executive director
of the National Conference on Citi
zenship.
Sloss highlighted the increasing
need for average people to be able
to easily communicate with their
elected leaders and suggested that
there is currently no way for this to
happen. His idea for more efficient
governance entails the use of online
technology to make budgetary and
other information available to resi
dents.

"My vision is that in 10 years
government in real-time will be
tracking everything it spends and
everything that it's bringing in, what
outcomes that's leading to and that
that will be streaming in real-time
onto servers that people outside of
government and inside of govern
ment can slice and dice it however
they want to see it," he said.
Manatt, who served as a legisla
tive assistant and held other posi
tions in California's government,
said that most people in govern
ment do want to use technology to
improve the way that local govern
ments deliver information and pro
vide services.

"Some people who've been in
government for decades upon
decades maybe don't have access to
some of the cutting-edge technolo
gy," Manatt said.
Innovative ways that local gov
ernments are using technology to
serve their people include the abili
ty to schedule a jail visit by going to
the Santa Clara County website or
public kiosk. In another example,
people can appear in court or re
quest social services via a closed-cir
cuit camera in Nevada County in
the Sierra Nevada Mountains, a
place where roads in winter are
often treacherous. Residents in
Santa Clarita can go online to ask
police to check on a home while a
resident is away.

Audience members offered a
range of opinions on the event. Lis
Ebbesen, a member of a Danish city
council, attended the discussion,
along with a handful of other Dan
ish politicians visiting Stanford. She
commented that her country is
more developed when it comes to e
government.

"If you look at my municipality,
you can go on Facebook and com
ment on everything we're doing in
our municipality, or you could ask
the mayor 'Why is there a hole in the
road?' or 'Why is the kindergarten

closed?' and he will answer you di
rectly," she said.

Geoff McGhee, creative director
for media and communications for
the Lane Center for the American
West was also among the audience
members. He outlined the research
questions of a current project joint
ly ran by the New America Founda
tion and Lane Center for the Amer
ican West. The research will primari
ly focus on finding "small innova
tions that save money and make a
difference and make government
more accountable" at a grass-roots
level.

Thad Kousser, professor of polit
ical science at UC-San Diego and
director of the California Constitu
tional Reform Project at the Lane
Center for the American West, com
mented on the consequences of
overlooking certain groups as gov
ernments ramp up their use of on
line communications technology.
"What you don't want to do is
create a thing where only the people
with iPhones are participating in
democracy," he said. "What you
worry about is if you do this badly
and only reach a small segment of
people who speak one language and
can afford the top technology,
you're not going to get what you
want."
