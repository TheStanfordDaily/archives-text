## Fac Senate talks grad study, ResEd Meeting explores Ph.D. committee reqs 
### MARGARET RAWSON MANAGING EDITOR 
The Faculty Senate passed several
changes to dissertation requirements
proposed by the Committee on
Graduate Studies and discussed resi
dential education at its second meet
ing of the year Thursday.

Committee on Graduate Studies
The Committee on Graduate
Studies (C-GS) recommended new
language concerning the composition
of Ph.D. oral and dissertation com
mittees. Following the changes, dis
sertation reading committees will
consist of at least three but no more
than five members, all of whom will
be required to sign off on the disserta
tion.

Emeritus faculty will now be con
sidered in the same standing as cur
rent Academic Council faculty. If the
principal dissertation adviser is an
emeritus member of the Academic
Council, a co-advisor will not be re
quired until two years have passed
since the emeritus member's retire
ment.

Candidates in all departments, as
well as in interdisciplinary programs,
will have the option of including
Ph. D.-holding, non-Academic Coun
cil members on their reading commit
tees if Academic Council faculty hold
the majority.
Richard Roberts, history profes
sor and chair of the C-GS, described
this change as an opportunity to in
clude individuals with expertise in the
dissertation field, such as industry
representatives, as students continue
to show increased interest in applied
sciences and other applications of
their dissertation work.

Stephen Stedman, political sci
ence professor, raised a concern that
requiring non-Academic Council
members to hold a Ph.D. would con
tradict the goal of seeking out expert
ise from industry leaders.
"So rank is more important than
expertise?" Stedman asked.
"Would you keep Bill Gates off?"
asked biology professor Lucille
Shapiro.

Roberts responded that yes, while
students could petition for excep
tions, Gates, a college dropout, would
be excluded from serving on a disser
tation committee.

"I think it's part of our process to
have people of the higher rank evalu
ating you for that rank," he said.
Caroline Hoxby, professor of eco
nomics, raised a cautionary point that
some students may seek outside advi
sors who would lower the overall
standards for their work.

Following the changes, emeritus
members serving on oral exam com
mittees will not be considered non-
Academic Council members and one
or two non-Academic Council mem
bers will be permitted.
The Senate passed the Commit
tee's recommendations with one ab
stention and no opposition.
Residential Education
The Senate also heard a report by
Deborah Golder, associate vice
provost and dean of the Office of
Residential Education.
There is "no better way outside
the classroom to capture the entirety
of the student body," Golder said of
Stanford's residential education pro
gram, noting that almost all Stanford
students live on campus for all four
years of their undergraduate careers.
Golder reiterated Res Ed's goal
"to make a major research university
feel like a small liberal arts college,"
and updated the Senate on a three
year campaign to revamp the pro
gram.

Golder included statistics about
Stanford's unique program. The Uni
versity has 78 houses on campus, com
pared to the usual 10 or 12 at sister
universities, she said.
As part of the restructuring
process, Golder noted that 50 percent
of Residential Education profession
al staff members are new to their
roles.

Golder outlined the Residential
Fellow program for the Senate, but
also stressed that all faculty, even
those who cannot live in an under
graduate dorm as a Resident Fellow,
should consider how they can partici
pate in the effort to bridge the aca
demic and residential experiences of
undergraduates.
