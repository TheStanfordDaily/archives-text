## EDITORIAL Let Stanford grow 
### 
Stanford has an indispensable
role in the economic well
being of the mid-peninsula.
Stanford employs 9,823 staff mem
bers, 1,903 faculty members and
provides business for countless
contractors. Companies founded
by alumni Google, Sun Mi
crosystems, Hewlett-Packard and
VMware, to name a few provide
a huge chunk of non-Stanford pri
vate employment and create de
mand for myriad businesses to
serve their needs. Stanford also
provides many public goods for lit
tle or no charge, including but not
limited to a spectacular art muse
um, a state-of-the-art hospital, hik
ing trails and a fantastic football
team. Nevertheless, surrounding
communities invariably view Stan
ford's attempts to expand its facili
ties with extreme trepidation, ex
tracting large financial concessions
from the University and forbidding
the same types of development
that made their towns prosperous
and exciting places to live.
Development on Stanford's
8,180 acres of land is currently gov
erned by the General Use Permit
signed with Santa Clara County in
2000. The permit places numerous
restrictions on Stanford, among
them limits on the total amount of
academic space and student and
faculty housing, and stipulates
where such facilities can be located.
New buildings along El Camino
Real must comply with height and
setback requirements that are "at a
minimum, at least as stringent as
those of the City of Palo Alto" and
"can be more stringent." Addition
ally, the permit requires Stanford's
developments to result in no addi
tional net automobile trips, a condi
tion that is never taken seriously
except as a mechanism for sur
rounding cities to demand arbi
trary amounts of money.

munity members. Stanford, to its
credit, is enthusiastic about the trail
projects, one of which opened last
year, and the other of which awaits
a last-minute decision from San
Mateo County. At the very least,
local governments should have co
operated with Stanford in trail con
struction rather than repeatedly
obstructing the very projects in
tended to benefit them.

Stanford's largest current con
struction project, the $5 billion ex
pansion of Stanford University
Medical Center, took 97 public
hearings, almost four years of nego
tiation and the promise of $173 mil
lion in public benefits to win final
approval from Palo Alto. Much of
the money was provided to help
mitigate traffic generated by the
project, yet Stanford will also be
paying millions of dollars for unre
lated programs in addition to a $2.4
million "upfront payment." While
most cities would be overjoyed to
gain a world-class hospital and new
medical research facilities, local au
thorities apparently are not. If
Mayor Sid Espinosa truly wants to
follow through on his declaration
that the city looks "forward to a
new era of partnership and collab
orations with hospitals and the
University as a whole," perhaps the
city could look for ways to ease the
restrictions placed on Stanford by
the county under the General Use
Permit. Doing so would be sensible
and easy, but also, unfortunately,
completely out of the question.
Stanford predates its surround
ing neighborhoods, provides direct
and indirect employment for many
of their residents and offers numer
ous public goods. Many of the
country's most successful compa
nies have direct ties to the Univer
sity, some of which were founded
by its alumni, and surely the future
will see many more great ideas and
organizations emerge from the
Farm. A country with 9.1 percent
unemployment, stagnant wages,
torpid productivity growth and no
coherent plan to address its 21st
century energy concerns needs
more of the resources Stanford has
to offer, not fewer. As long as Stan
ford's growth is beholden to the
whims of change-averse neighbors,
we'll never know which seemingly
intractable problems could have
been solved.

One condition of the General
Use Permit that Stanford spend
millions of dollars to construct two
trails featured in Santa Clara
County's Countywide Trails Mas
ter Plan has recently come to
the fore. While there is certainly
much to love about a better local
trail network, such infrastructure
shouldn't be a payment extracted
from Stanford as compensation for
allowing Stanford to provide addi
tional jobs and residences for com-

struction rather than repeatedly
obstructing the very projects in
tended to benefit them.

Stanford's largest current con
struction project, the $5 billion ex
pansion of Stanford University
Medical Center, took 97 public
hearings, almost four years of nego
tiation and the promise of $173 mil
lion in public benefits to win final
approval from Palo Alto. Much of
the money was provided to help
mitigate traffic generated by the
project, yet Stanford will also be
paying millions of dollars for unre
lated programs in addition to a $2.4
million "upfront payment." While
most cities would be overjoyed to
gain a world-class hospital and new
medical research facilities, local au
thorities apparently are not. If
Mayor Sid Espinosa truly wants to
follow through on his declaration
that the city looks "forward to a
new era of partnership and collab
orations with hospitals and the
University as a whole," perhaps the
city could look for ways to ease the
restrictions placed on Stanford by
the county under the General Use
Permit. Doing so would be sensible
and easy, but also, unfortunately,
completely out of the question.
Stanford predates its surround
ing neighborhoods, provides direct
and indirect employment for many
of their residents and offers numer
ous public goods. Many of the
country's most successful compa
nies have direct ties to the Univer
sity, some of which were founded
by its alumni, and surely the future
will see many more great ideas and
organizations emerge from the
Farm. A country with 9.1 percent
unemployment, stagnant wages,
torpid productivity growth and no
coherent plan to address its 21st
century energy concerns needs
more of the resources Stanford has
to offer, not fewer. As long as Stan
ford's growth is beholden to the
whims of change-averse neighbors,
we'll never know which seemingly
intractable problems could have
been solved.

One condition of the General
Use Permit that Stanford spend
millions of dollars to construct two
trails featured in Santa Clara
County's Countywide Trails Mas
ter Plan has recently come to
the fore. While there is certainly
much to love about a better local
trail network, such infrastructure
shouldn't be a payment extracted
from Stanford as compensation for
allowing Stanford to provide addi
tional jobs and residences for com-
