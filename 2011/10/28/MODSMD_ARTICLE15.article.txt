# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Another student's look at StanfordNYC 
### 
Dear Editor,
I for one have been rooting for
Stanford from the onset in its pro
posal to build a campus in New
York City as I think it presents a
tremendous opportunity ("A stu
dent's look at StanfordNYC," Oct.
27). Why go to New York City when
things seem just fine here in sunny
Palo Alto? This country needs an
other center for innovation and that
is what Stanford does better than
any university in the world. It would
provide Stanford with new research
alignments in industries that don't
exist in the Bay Area and would
give students from the home cam
pus access to a whole network of
East Coast contacts and new alum
ni. Maybe we can even start chip
ping away at that East Coast bias
that never seems to allow Stanford
to climb above Harvard or Yale in
national rankings.
One of the primary concerns
about the proposed New York City
campus is the hefty price tag: $2.5
billion. However, the Stanford pro
posal only commits $2OO million ini
tially to get the University started
on solid financial footing and will
pay for the rest through a new
fundraising initiative. None of Stan
ford's home campus proposals or
generous financial aid are put in
jeopardy though this investment.
Why not spend more on improving

financial aid for undergraduates? If
you want to improve access to a
Stanford education for more of the
world's best and brightest, what bet
ter way than to provide more spots
for graduate students? Stanford-
NYC will likely pay for itself many
times over through an influx of new
donors, industry collaborations and
federal research grants that will
come from building a world class re
search university in New York City.
Some fear that allowing Stan
fordNYC to operate as its own de
gree-granting institution would
lead to a devaluation of the Stan
ford degree. President Hennessy
has made it expressly clear that he
expects the new campus to have the
same high standards when it comes
to admitting students as well as hir
ing faculty. We should not worry
about a brain drain on the home
campus. There is a certain group of
faculty, including some of the
brightest minds in the world, which
we can now recruit because living
on the East Coast or in a big city is
so important to them. And if we can
get the best students in the world to
come to Palo Alto (not exactly the
world's cultural hotbed), I'm pretty
sure we can convince them to come
to New York. Everyone already has
a unique Stanford experience, but
what the degree represents is a cer
tain standard of academic excel
lence. If they are taking the same
classes and tests as us, why can't we
be okay with just accepting that
their Stanford experience will be
different as well?

Should the student body or
alumni network have been includ
ed more in the decision making

process? Probably. But that doesn't
mean the idea is wrong. Stanford
has always been about taking risks
and changing the world. Stanford-
NYC is an opportunity to do just
that, which may not come again,
and we should not let it pass us by.
