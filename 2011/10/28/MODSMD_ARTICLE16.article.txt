## A 						new environmental curriculum 
### Holly Moeller 
On Tuesday, I spent two hours
straight in a meeting. Nor
mally, sitting still that long
would be torture that's why I'm
better at lab work than writing pa
pers, and why my research ADD has
produced about fifty half-finished
thesis chapters.
But this meeting was different.
We were assembled to talk about
undergraduate education: specifi
cally, how Stanford is remodeling its
biology lab courses. I was present on
the basis of my dubious authority as
one of last spring's ecology lab
teaching assistants.
As I flipped through slides de
picting the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, the plants and animals of
our study system, and the rat
tlesnake I'd once chased off a path,
I remembered how much fun it was
to watch students discover ecology
and learn how nature works. I re
membered the joy of teaching, the
moments of inspiration, sensations
that linger long past the discom
forts of dirty fingernails and sweaty
backs.

Teaching is simultaneously one
of the most rewarding and the most
challenging duties of a graduate stu
dent. At any moment, you could in
spire a student's career or illuminate
a light bulb of understanding. (Yes, it
really does sound that romantic,
until you're sitting through a desert
ed office hour or hearing snores
from the back corner of a class

room.)
The first hard lesson in teaching
usually has to do with time. You
learn to make tough cuts. Not all the
exam material fits into the review
session. The quarter doesn't have
enough weeks to cover all major
topics.

It's a problem that's mirrored at
the university level. Which classes
should be part of a general educa
tion requirement? Should we be
telling students what they need to
know, or just offering them what
they want to know? And what
knowledge is critical to a citizen of
this country? Of this planet?
As an ecologist, I have pretty
strong opinions. These days, whether
or not you agree with nine out of 10
scientists that humans are driving
climate change, you've undoubtedly
heard of global warming. But you
might not feel comfortable with the
scientific principles underlying the
greenhouse effect or know why
burning fossil fuels affects it. You
may have heard we're running out
of those fossil fuels, but don't know
why. And if someone asked where
today's food and water came from,
you might answer, "I don't know."
Well, you should.

The world is changing in ways
that will make our high-consump
tion lifestyles impossible in ways
that, quite frankly, could render our
species extinct. And you really
ought to know why.

Let me give Stanford and our
country's gradually shifting politi
cal attitudes some credit. You've
probably absorbed some knowl
edge of environmental issues
through osmosis. But out in the
"real world," you'll be buffeted by
op-eds, propaganda and media
snippets that either assume a fun
damental grasp of these issues or
leverage your ignorance. So you
should be taught, systematically, in
your first year of college, the funda
mental truths of how the world
works and how human activity
shapes these workings. And you
should learn some basic fact-check
ing skills or at least practice
being skeptical.
Still, only 30 percent of the U.S.
population will earn a bachelor's de
gree. And 100 percent of the U.S.
population should understand the
basics of environmental issues. We
must go deeper than the university
setting to rekindle that American
desire for knowledge, advancement
and science.

It could begin in elementary
school field trips to the zoo and
field trips to local nature reserves.
"Nature" isn't foreign; it's not limit
ed to giraffes in Africa. "Nature" is
just outside the city limits and
when we notice it there, we notice it
in our backyards, in our everyday
lives and finally, in ourselves.

Maybe then we'll show more
empathy as we turn to the next task,
understanding how we're exceed
ing the bounds of nature. High
schools used to make time for home
ec, something once considered criti
cal to the future of the American
household. Now, they need to make
time for enviro ec, critical to the fu
ture of the planet. Everyone needs
to know what an "ecological foot
print" is and how to use it to calcu
late their impact on food, water and
energy resources. Bill Rees and
Mathis Wackernagel wrote a bril
liant book on the matter 15 years
ago. It's high school-level reading,
and bridges humanities (what's our
responsibility to ourselves? to

Earth?), social sciences (why do dif
ferent cultures use resources differ
ently?), physical sciences (how
much and how fast?) and the arts
(how do we represent and commu
nicate these issues?). Something for
everyone in one practical package.
Then again, we live in a nation
with states that restrict the teaching
of evolution. We live in a culture
where it's okay to be afraid of math
(compare the stigma of illiteracy to
the jocular attitudes of the innumer
ate) and, occasionally, admirable to
be ignorant. For all that we do to re
vamp Stanford's lab courses, what's
the future of science in a place like
that?

More importantly, what's the fu
ture of the world?

On Tuesday, I spent two hours
straight in a meeting. Nor
mally, sitting still that long
would be torture that's why I'm
better at lab work than writing pa
pers, and why my research ADD has
produced about fifty half-finished
thesis chapters.
But this meeting was different.
We were assembled to talk about
undergraduate education: specifi
cally, how Stanford is remodeling its
biology lab courses. I was present on
the basis of my dubious authority as
one of last spring's ecology lab
teaching assistants.
As I flipped through slides de
picting the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, the plants and animals of
our study system, and the rat
tlesnake I'd once chased off a path,
I remembered how much fun it was
to watch students discover ecology
and learn how nature works. I re
membered the joy of teaching, the
moments of inspiration, sensations
that linger long past the discom
forts of dirty fingernails and sweaty
backs.

Teaching is simultaneously one
of the most rewarding and the most
challenging duties of a graduate stu
dent. At any moment, you could in
spire a student's career or illuminate
a light bulb of understanding. (Yes, it
really does sound that romantic,
until you're sitting through a desert
ed office hour or hearing snores
from the back corner of a class

room.)
The first hard lesson in teaching
usually has to do with time. You
learn to make tough cuts. Not all the
exam material fits into the review
session. The quarter doesn't have
enough weeks to cover all major
topics.

It's a problem that's mirrored at
the university level. Which classes
should be part of a general educa
tion requirement? Should we be
telling students what they need to
know, or just offering them what
they want to know? And what
knowledge is critical to a citizen of
this country? Of this planet?
As an ecologist, I have pretty
strong opinions. These days, whether
or not you agree with nine out of 10
scientists that humans are driving
climate change, you've undoubtedly
heard of global warming. But you
might not feel comfortable with the
scientific principles underlying the
greenhouse effect or know why
burning fossil fuels affects it. You
may have heard we're running out
of those fossil fuels, but don't know
why. And if someone asked where
today's food and water came from,
you might answer, "I don't know."
Well, you should.

The world is changing in ways
that will make our high-consump
tion lifestyles impossible in ways
that, quite frankly, could render our
species extinct. And you really
ought to know why.

Let me give Stanford and our
country's gradually shifting politi
cal attitudes some credit. You've
probably absorbed some knowl
edge of environmental issues
through osmosis. But out in the
"real world," you'll be buffeted by
op-eds, propaganda and media
snippets that either assume a fun
damental grasp of these issues or
leverage your ignorance. So you
should be taught, systematically, in
your first year of college, the funda
mental truths of how the world
works and how human activity
shapes these workings. And you
should learn some basic fact-check
ing skills or at least practice
being skeptical.
Still, only 30 percent of the U.S.
population will earn a bachelor's de
gree. And 100 percent of the U.S.
population should understand the
basics of environmental issues. We
must go deeper than the university
setting to rekindle that American
desire for knowledge, advancement
and science.

It could begin in elementary
school field trips to the zoo and
field trips to local nature reserves.
"Nature" isn't foreign; it's not limit
ed to giraffes in Africa. "Nature" is
just outside the city limits and
when we notice it there, we notice it
in our backyards, in our everyday
lives and finally, in ourselves.

Maybe then we'll show more
empathy as we turn to the next task,
understanding how we're exceed
ing the bounds of nature. High
schools used to make time for home
ec, something once considered criti
cal to the future of the American
household. Now, they need to make
time for enviro ec, critical to the fu
ture of the planet. Everyone needs
to know what an "ecological foot
