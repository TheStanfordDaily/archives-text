# THE 						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## Empty museums: an explanation 
### D.S. Nelson 
In the 60s, the question "what is
art?" was answered by a chorus
of "anything." Since then, our
culture has paid a high price. I gave
up going to see anything made after
1917 when I saw a toilet bowl in the
Whitney Museum. There was an
American Standard toilet in one of
America's most renowned modern
art museums. 1 was told it was a
thought piece. Personally, I thought
there was very little there. In Sep
tember, I decided to go back. I saw
vintage video games and machinery
made to do odd things. I had an N64.
I've already seen them in action.
I agree that all art and all beauty
are subjectively defined. It doesn't
seem possible to contest that. But
the common working definition of
art as anything that provokes
thought is the reason why no one re
ally cares about it anymore. Every
thing can provoke some thought.
Whether that thought is meaningful
is an entirely different question.
The wilder, more "daring" vari
eties of visual art we see in our lead
ing contemporary museums are
generally trite too obscure to
have any profound meaning. Often
it is simply too self-referential. It
can only be comprehended by a
small subset of people who have
studied it all their lives. Even then,
its ambition is limited and the work
uninteresting. Other works are too
expected. There is a battery of art,
especially performance art, which
just attempts to shock the viewer
with the risque. It doesn't challenge
him or her to think differently. It
does test the strength of the stom
ach, however. Pieces waver be
tween easily comprehensible or to
tally random. Saying it provides

food for thought doesn't redeem its
specialness I could ponder the
miracle of a mop without paying ad
mission.
So what do we have in contempo
rary visual art? Aesthetic appeal has
largely been done away with, save by
a few artists like Bridget Riley, Tom
Hunter and Gregory Crewdson.
Otherwise, there's little beauty or
entertainment to be had. Entertain
ment and visual art have been sepa
rate for some time. If it isn't amusing
on a basic level or beautiful to our
subjective minds, ho w can we engage
with it? The intellectual level is
rarely that rich. Defamiliarization is
the main way people try to get at it.
But rarely is the message more com
plex than a "dude, how weird are toi
lets, man?" It may have been inter
esting 50 years ago to look at a fork
outside of its normal habitat, but it
no longer achieves any goal. That
doesn't stop anyone from trying. I
find no means to appreciate this art.
I do not find the insight, the immer
sion or the catharsis other creative
works give me. I only see trivialities
and novelties.
There are obviously works that
break these trends. Hockney, Freud
and Richter are among those few
names that make astonishingly great
pieces, and I would suggest a quick
Googling to those who despair of
contemporary art. But I do feel as
though the culture of art and art crit
icism in America is intentionally in
accessible and, also intentionally,
seeks to move away from any meas
ure of understandable value. I appre
ciate an art that seeks to be intrinsi
cally powerful and entirely inexpli
cable, but not at the cost of all enjoy
ment. The desire to be inexplicable

and the will to be random have de
stroyed art. It makes art an exercise
in competitive randomness. Who can
be more esoteric? Who can boggle
the audience more? Art becomes a
contest of hipness that continues
well after the audience has left the
theater. Artists merely try to prove
their individuality with their work,
and the work becomes of little inter
est to anyone but their circle. This
makes audiences, already alienated
by obscurity, dislike the culture sur
rounding the artist, too.
But now it becomes necessary to
turn my eye to myself. As a dis
claimer, my assessment of what is
worthwhile is just as subjective as a
definition of art. However, I will say
my findings about contemporary
art's inaccessibility are commonly
shared. Have I merely become too
used to the Internet and TV to get at
the core of these different forms of
expression? I will say that art expe
rienced in person is totally different
than that on screen. Pictures of ar
chitectural feats have very different
effects than the buildings them
selves. The same holds true of paint
ing and other visual arts. Could it
not stand to reason that, because we
interact with art usually through a
screen rather than in person, the im
pact and general perception of art is
diminished? Or have I been made
of incapable of understanding
something invaluable? These are
valid questions that I cannot an
swer; but I'd still be really happy if
this were posted on Reddit.

does test the strength of the stom
ach, however. Pieces waver be
tween easily comprehensible or to
tally random. Saying it provides

food for thought doesn't redeem its
specialness I could ponder the
miracle of a mop without paying ad
mission.
So what do we have in contempo
rary visual art? Aesthetic appeal has
largely been done away with, save by
a few artists like Bridget Riley, Tom
Hunter and Gregory Crewdson.
Otherwise, there's little beauty or
entertainment to be had. Entertain
ment and visual art have been sepa
rate for some time. If it isn't amusing
on a basic level or beautiful to our
subjective minds, ho w can we engage
with it? The intellectual level is
rarely that rich. Defamiliarization is
the main way people try to get at it.
But rarely is the message more com
plex than a "dude, how weird are toi
lets, man?" It may have been inter
esting 50 years ago to look at a fork
outside of its normal habitat, but it
no longer achieves any goal. That
doesn't stop anyone from trying. I
find no means to appreciate this art.
I do not find the insight, the immer
sion or the catharsis other creative
works give me. I only see trivialities
and novelties.
There are obviously works that
break these trends. Hockney, Freud
and Richter are among those few
names that make astonishingly great
pieces, and I would suggest a quick
Googling to those who despair of
contemporary art. But I do feel as
though the culture of art and art crit
icism in America is intentionally in
accessible and, also intentionally,
seeks to move away from any meas
ure of understandable value. I appre
ciate an art that seeks to be intrinsi
cally powerful and entirely inexpli
cable, but not at the cost of all enjoy
ment. The desire to be inexplicable

and the will to be random have de
stroyed art. It makes art an exercise
in competitive randomness. Who can
be more esoteric? Who can boggle
the audience more? Art becomes a
contest of hipness that continues
well after the audience has left the
theater. Artists merely try to prove
their individuality with their work,
and the work becomes of little inter
est to anyone but their circle. This
makes audiences, already alienated
by obscurity, dislike the culture sur
rounding the artist, too.
But now it becomes necessary to
turn my eye to myself. As a dis
claimer, my assessment of what is
worthwhile is just as subjective as a
definition of art. However, I will say
my findings about contemporary
art's inaccessibility are commonly
shared. Have I merely become too
used to the Internet and TV to get at
the core of these different forms of
expression? I will say that art expe
rienced in person is totally different
than that on screen. Pictures of ar
chitectural feats have very different
effects than the buildings them
selves. The same holds true of paint
ing and other visual arts. Could it
not stand to reason that, because we
interact with art usually through a
screen rather than in person, the im
pact and general perception of art is
diminished? Or have I been made
of incapable of understanding
something invaluable? These are
valid questions that I cannot an
swer; but I'd still be really happy if
this were posted on Reddit.
