## FIELD OF DREAMS CARD AIMS FOR FIRST RANKED ROAD WIN 
### SARAH MAISEL 
A mere glance at the Stanford field hockey
team's record (13-2, 6-0 NorPac) shows just how
much the squad has accomplished. Not only did the
No. 9 Cardinal finish perfect in conference play
scoring 25 goals to a measly five against but it
also extended a year-long home winning streak that
dates back to Oct. 8,2010.
Yet this year's team has not yet beaten a ranked
opponent on the road. Sunday, against No. 7 Michi
gan (12-4,4-1), the Cardinal looks to do just that as
it heads three time zones away to finish the regular
season.

This two-game road trip, which begins Friday
against Michigan State, presents a chance for the
team to continue its momentum going into next
weekend's conference championship. The No. 1
seed Cardinal can clinch an NCAA Tournament
play-in game by winning the NorPac Champi
onship, a title Stanford has won the past four sea
sons.

Opening in East Lansing, the Cardinal hopes to
take advantage of a Michigan State team plagued
with offensive struggles. The Spartans have been
outscored 42-26 overall and failed to score in five
of its 10 losses. Both teams played Indiana, New
Hampshire, California and Northeastern this sea
son; Stanford went 3-1, while Michigan State
dropped all four.
But Sunday in Ann Arbor, Mich, will be an en
tirely different story, as the Cardinal tries to earn
its first-ever win against the Wolverines. The
teams have not met since 2008, when Stanford
fell 5-1.

After dropping its season opener against No. 2
North Carolina, Michigan bounced back in ex
traordinary fashion.The defense has held six teams
scoreless, including Michigan State in a game last
weekend during which the Spartans could not
manage a shot. And the Wolverines' dominance ex
tends to the other side of the field; Michigan has
outscored and outshot opponents 49-21 and 256-
135, respectively.
"I think it's important that we go to Michigan
having a tough mentality," said sophomore attacker
Hope Burke. "Playing on someone else's turf is al-

ways harder, but we are going to focus on matching
their intensity and taking care of the ball when we
have possession. Michigan's backfield has yet to be
tested, and I think that we are going to have success
by pressuring their defense and creating turnovers."
Since its 5-0 rout of UC-Davis last Friday, the
Cardinal has relentlessly prepared for the upcoming
road trip and will be ready to challenge Michigan.
"Going into the last two games our plan is to re
main confident and know that we have been work
ing just as hard if not harder than the teams
we are going up against," Burke said. "This week has
been about fine-tuning the little aspects of our game
that are going to make the difference at the end of
the season. We've been working on passing, corners
and structure. We've put in all of the hard work over
the past three months. Now it's time to put it all to
gether."

The importance of Sunday's game extends into

the postseason. If Stanford should lose in the Nor-
Pac Tournament, its hope for an automatic play-in
game would be crushed. But after only losing two
games to this point both of which were away and
against ranked teams Stanford could secure one
of eight at-large bids. A decisive win on the road
against a No. 7 team would soundly speak for the
Cardinal as a field hockey power deserving of a
tournament spot.

"When it gets close to postseason, it's not only
about skill but it's about willpower and which team
wants to win more," Burke said. "Our goal is to just
continue playing our game and prep for next week's
NorPac Championship."
The Cardinal takes on the Spartans today at 12
p.m. PST and the Wolverines on Sunday at 9 a.m.
PST.

Sophomore attacker Hope Burke (No. 3), second on the squad in points with 22, and her teammates can
earn some validation for a strong 2011 season with a quality win over No. 7 Michigan on Sunday. Though
the Cardinal went undefeated in conference play, it has yet to win on the road over a ranked team.
