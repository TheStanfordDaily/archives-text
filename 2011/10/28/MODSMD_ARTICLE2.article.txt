# PRIME TIME
## RIVALRY MEETS QB DUEL 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Who can remember the last time this hap
pened?

When was the last time Stanford went down
to Los Angeles to play USC and was actual
ly expected to win?

For the No. 4 Stanford football team, which
travels to play the No. 20 Trojans this Saturday
in its biggest game of the season so far, the bet
ter question is: "Who cares?"
"If you turn the ball over, if you don't con
trol the clock and you give a team big plays, any
given Saturday you could win or you could

lose," said Stanford head coach David Shaw.
"At the end of the day, we've got to find away
to end up with one more point than USC."
Even though the Cardinal (7-0,5-0 Pac-12)
is reluctant to get too excited, despite being fa
vored over upset-minded USC (6-1,3-1), the at
mosphere for Saturday's contest couldn't be
much bigger. The Trojans are riding a three
game win streak and ESPN's College Game-
Day is setting up out front of the Los Angeles
Coliseum for a nationally televised prime-time
matchup.

the center of an intense rivalry over the past several
years, with the Cardinal having won three of the last four
games in the series, including a 37-35 victory last season
on a 30-yard field goal that split the uprights as time ex
pired.

But even though things have gotten heated at times
between USC and Stanford especially in the infa
mous "What's your deal?" game two seasons ago at the
Coliseum quarterback Andrew Luck said the Cardi
nal won't change its proven method.
"I think USC's got a great rivalry with Stanford, but I
don't think you want to approach it too differently," Luck
said. "Obviously we've had some success in the past, so
why change that for just one game? You've got to go
every weekend and prove yourself again, and obviously
USC presents a huge challenge."

If Luck and the Cardinal want to avoid a letdown
under the lights, they'll most likely have to find away to
outduel the Trojans' proficient offensive combination of
junior quarterback Matt Barkley and sophomore wide
receiver Robert Woods, who combine to form one of the
most potent offensive threats in the nation.
Barkley, who is ranked just behind Luck as one of the
top quarterback prospects for next year's NFL Draft, has
stats that are essentially equal to his Northern California
counterpart, with 2,006 yards, 19 touchdowns and four in
terceptions through the air this season. Luck has fewer
yards (1,888), butmore touchdowns (20) and fewer inter
ceptions (3).
Shaw complimented Barkley's development over the
past several years when talking about the improved Tro
jan offense.
"He's always had a strong arm, he's always been able
to make every throw," Shaw said. "I mean, we're talking
about a guy that started as a true freshman, so we're also
talking about a guy who has made a lot of progression
since then. He's become one of the best quarterbacks in
the nation."

Luck said he was unsure of how to feel about facing
off against another top quarterback, even after Barkley
passed for 390 yards to Luck's 285 in last year's game.
"I don't know. I think he'll probably say the same
thing, you've got to worry more about the defense is
doing," he said. "You can't get caught up in what the
other offense is doing, because it'll take your offense out
of a rhythm."
Barkley's success is closely tied to the addition of
Woods to the Trojan offense, as the sophomore wideout
has caught 72 passes for 902 yards and nine touchdowns
this season, prompting Shaw to call him "about the best
route-running wide receiver I've seen in college football
in 10 years."
Woods also had a field day in last year's game on the
Farm, catching 12 passes for 224 yards and three touch
downs the most by any one receiver against Stanford
all season.

Woods' presence presents a major challenge to a
Stanford defense that will be missing strong safety De
lano Howell for the second game in a row. The injury
forces senior free safety Michael Thomas to switch over
to Howell's spot, and makes room for sophomore Devon
Carrington and freshman Jordan Richards in the defen
sive backfield.
Thomas said that both he and the newcomers ab
solutely had to do a better job of preventing the big play,
especially if the Cardinal defense hoped to corral Woods
this Saturday.
"Let's be real, it's out there [Woods] torched us
last year,"Thomas said."We'd like to think that we're not
the type of secondary that lets any type of receiver come

in and destroy us like that."
"Last week [against Washington] it was poor deci
sion-making by everybody on our defense, missed tack
les, not being physical at the point of attack," he contin
ued. "[Carrington and Richards] definitely settled down
in the second half, and we've already been communicat
ing better this week in practice."
On the other side of the football, Stanford will likely
be looking to exploit an athletic but inconsistent Trojan
defense that gave up back-to-back 40-point games
against Arizona and Arizona State before clamping
down to allow just 26 points in its last two matchups com
bined.
The Cardinal unleashed its most potent offensive per
formance last week against Washington, rushing for 446
yards on its way to 615 total yards, but the USC defense
only gives up 91 yards per game on the ground, a stat that
prompted several players and Shaw to call the Trojans
the best defense Stanford has faced all season.
A win against USC could go a long way towards im
proving the Cardinal's national reputation and BCS
rankings but Shaw said Stanford can't afford to think
about anything extraneous, especially after Wisconsin
and Oklahoma fell last weekend.
"Getting giddy or upset about the BCS in October is
a waste of time," Shaw said. "There's not enough time to
worry about Alabama or LSU or Oklahoma State ... if
we don't take care of business, it doesn't matter anyway."
And even though the Cardinal is favored, Thomas
boiled down the team's motivation to just one sentence:
"At the end of the day, that's still SC."
Saturday's contest between the Trojans and the Car
dinal kicks off at 5 p.m. The game will be televised nation
ally on ABC.

Junior Zach Ertz (above) and his fellow tight ends only
caught three passes for 30 yards last week against Washington.
But against an even stronger USC run defense,
chances are they'll be utilized heavily again this week.
