# PRIME TIME
## RIVALRY MEETS QB DUEL 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Who can remember the last time this hap
pened?

When was the last time Stanford went down
to Los Angeles to play USC and was actual
ly expected to win?

For the No. 4 Stanford football team, which
travels to play the No. 20 Trojans this Saturday
in its biggest game of the season so far, the bet
ter question is: "Who cares?"
"If you turn the ball over, if you don't con
trol the clock and you give a team big plays, any
given Saturday you could win or you could

lose," said Stanford head coach David Shaw.
"At the end of the day, we've got to find away
to end up with one more point than USC."
Even though the Cardinal (7-0,5-0 Pac-12)
is reluctant to get too excited, despite being fa
vored over upset-minded USC (6-1,3-1), the at
mosphere for Saturday's contest couldn't be
much bigger. The Trojans are riding a three
game win streak and ESPN's College Game-
Day is setting up out front of the Los Angeles
Coliseum for a nationally televised prime-time
matchup.
