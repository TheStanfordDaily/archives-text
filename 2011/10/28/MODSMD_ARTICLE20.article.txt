# Life after Luck
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
Here's a scenario: Stan
ford's star quarterback
leads the Cardinal to its
first conference title in
more than a decade,
takes home the Heisman Trophy, wins
the Rose Bowl in an upset, is named
MVP of the game and is selected first
overall in the NFL Draft after being
called the "best pro quarterback
prospect I've ever seen" by competing
college coaches And the next year, a
much-lesser-known quarterback takes
Stanford to another conference-top
ping season, another Rose Bowl and
another stunning win in Pasadena.
You're not hearing the naive over
optimism of a lifelong Stanford fan.
Heck, I'm not even referring to An
drew Luck or what the future might
hold for the Cardinal when he's not
around in 2012. Believe it or not, the
above scenario is a historical fact.

Going into the 1970 season, Stan
ford was 19 years removed from its last
conference title, but it had Jim Plunkett
not Luck on its side. Plunkett's
last hurrah was a 27-17 Rose Bowl win
over undefeated Ohio State just a
month after he had been awarded the
Heisman. At the time it seemed only
logical that, with the departure of its star
quarterback, Stanford would be a one
hit wonder, fade back into oblivion and
fail to do anything noteworthy on the
football field for quite some time.
Enter Don Bunce, a senior at the
time, who had watched from the side
lines for three years as Plunkett made a
name for himself Later the team doctor
from 1982-92, Bunce was a skilled ath
lete but was clearly a step below Plun
kett's elite talent and lacked much of a
future in professional football.
Bunce didn't put up god-like num
bers in 1971, completing just 54.5 per
cent of his passes while throwing for 13
touchdowns and 16 interceptions.
(Plunkett hadn't actually done much
better in 1970, completing 53.4 percent
for 18 scores and 18 picks.) But even
without his predecessor's big-name ap
peal, Bunce led Stanford to a second
straight 8-3 season and a Rose Bowl
matchup against an undefeated Big-10
champion: 11-0 Michigan. And thanks
to a perfect 5-5 drive late in the fourth
quarter, Bunce got the Indians —yes,
Indians a thriller of a win yet again,
edging the Wolverines 13-12.
That was 40 years ago. Stanford has
n't won a Rose Bowl since.

Any Stanford fan in his or her right
mind should be worried about what
will happen when Luck leaves. He's an
all-world talent, already took the Car
dinal to a BCS bowl victory and has a
great shot at repeating again this year.
And as he puts up solid performance
after solid performance, he's looking
more and more like a lock for the Heis
man and the No. 1 draft pick.
Yet when number 12 plays his last
game in Cardinal hopefully in a vic
tory either at the Rose Bowl or Nation
al Championship —you'd be out of
your mind to think that all hope is lost
for an extended stay at the top of the
Pac-12.

Sure, there will be heavy losses in
the form of offensive linemen
Jonathan Martin and David DeCastro
(should each of them opt to bypass
their respective fifth years of eligibili
ty), and stellar defensive end Matt
Masifilo, who is definitely playing in his
last season. The top of the Cardinal's
deep tight end and linebacker groups

will be skimmed off, with Coby Fleener
and Max Bergen also in year five and
Shayne Skov considering a pro career
after this season.
But every team has to deal with a re
hashed depth chart; not every team has
to deal with losing the best quarterback
prospect in a decade and a half
Don't forget, though, that it's been
done before... by Stanford.
Could sophomore Brett Notting
ham be the next Don Bunce? Only
time will tell,but so far, Nottingham has
impressed onlookers after stealing the
backup job in fall camp. Going 4-7 in
five games this year might not seem
like much. But when you average near
ly 20 yards per completion on the sea
son and throw a touchdown in your
first college appearance, it doesn't
sound half bad.
So is life after Luck going to be a lit
tle bit scary? Maybe. But is it uncharted
territory?
Absolutely not.

Joseph Bey da has been in the stands at
Stanford Stadium for every home
game since 1959. Well, 1998. It's a
streak that deserves some major props,
but if you want to let him know how
much time he has wasted (173 hours at
last count), drop him a line at
jbeyda@stanford. edu.

You'd be out
of your mind
to think all
hope is lost.
