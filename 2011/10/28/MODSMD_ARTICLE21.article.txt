# CONFERENCE CLINCHER
## BEAVERS NOW THE ONLY OBSTACLE REMAINING 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Like almost all of his contemporaries, women's soc
cer coach Paul Ratcliffe says he focuses on one game at
a time, no matter the situation. With his team just one
win away from clinching the first Pac-12 title in any
sport, tonight's road matchup with No. 21 Oregon State
might be one instance when Ratcliffe is true to his word.
Stanford (16-0-1, 8-0 Pac-12) is the country's top
team in every major poll and is also one of just three un
defeated teams, along with Oklahoma State and Pep
perdine. But the team will face a stiff test in its matchup
with the Beavers (12-4-1,6-2), which have won four out
of their last five matches and swept Washington and
then-No. 18 Washington State last weekend.
Just three games remain for both teams, and even a
draw would clinch at least a share of Stanford's third
conference title in a row. And since the Cardinal has
won its last 28 conference games, anything less than
three full points would be a surprise.
But Oregon State is playing very good soccer right
now, and Beavers forward Chelsea Buckland was
named Pac-12 Player of the Week and put on College-
Soccer36o.com's Primetime Performer Honor Roll last
week after scoring the game-winning goal against the
Cougars.

However, Stanford has traditionally owned Oregon
State both at home and in Corvallis the Cardinal is
17-1-0 all-time against the Beavers and won the last
meeting between the teams 2-0.

And Stanford's attack has been on top of its game of
late, with senior forward Lindsay Taylor scoring goals in
each of the last four matches. The two-time First Team
All-Pac-10 selection said that the credit for her recent
success deserves to go to offense's increased fluidity.
"I have to give credit to my teammates," she said,
"because they've given me such great balls to work
with. And I've been fortunate to get really good crosses
in the box. The offense is really starting to gel. We're
starting to make the right runs, the midfielders are real
ly getting in there, and the outside backs are moving
into the attack. Hopefully we can keep scoring."
Junior forward Marjani Hing-Glover and freshman
forward Chioma Übogabu have also played big roles in
Stanford's scoring spree. Hing-Glover has burst onto
the scene this season with five goals, more than dou
bling her career total. And Übogabu, who was very
highly recruited out of high school, looks to be a lock for
the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team with eight goals and
nine assists.

No matter what happens against Oregon State, Stan
ford will have to find away to stay motivated against
Oregon (8-7-2,3-4-1) on Sunday.The Ducks have strug
gled all season long, battling injuries and having to play
with a very young lineup, but they are unbeaten in their
last three games, knocking off the Cougars 1-0 last Sun
day.

After the weekend road trip, the Cardinal will return

home for the last game of the season on Saturday, Nov.
5 against rival California. After that, Stanford will have
to wait and see who it draws in the NCAA Tournament,
which begins Friday, Nov. 11.
Tonight's game in Corvallis will kick off at 7 p.m.,
with Sunday's match against the Ducks in Eugene slat
ed to start at 1 p.m.

Last weekend against Colorado, several feeds from senior
Camille Levin (above) led to dynamite chances in front
of the net. This week, Levin and the Cardinal can wrap up
their third consecutive Pac-12 title against Oregon State.
