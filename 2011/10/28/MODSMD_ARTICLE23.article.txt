## POP CULTURE COSTUMES

In between midterms, papers, p-sets and whatever else,
Intermission totally understands if you haven't gotten
around to putting your Halloween costume together yet.
That's why we're here with our handy-dandy list of pop
culture-inspired costumes. Hear that knocking? It's the
Zeitgeist embrace it! Three cheers for cultural relevancy!
Pregnant Beyonce
The "Single Ladies" diva was accused of faking her pregnancy
after a viral clip surfaced of her baby bump squishing weirdly
as she sat down on an Aussie TV show. You too can emulate
the "Bootylicious" baby mama with your own enormous,
bedazzled belly; hip-hop super baby not included.
Judy from "Saturday Night Live"
The demented sister from the "Lawrence Welk Show" skit is
still one of Intermission's favorites ("And I'm Judy!"). Just slap
on a freakishly tall prosthetic forehead, grab some tiny baby
doll hands and you're set. We'll give you extra credit if you
make it a duo and include Melissa McCarthy's recent
muscular, woodchuck-esque addition to the family (or
alternately, McCarthy's hilarious Hidden Valley lady).
An Angry Bird
The übiquitous mobile game is set to be turned into a
feature-length film, which is the natural next step for these
furious fowl and their plan for world domination. Regardless
of whether or not you still find their relentless persecution of
little green pigs entertaining, an Angry Birds costume gives
you a good excuse to literally hurl yourself at that cute kid
you've been eyeing in section.
Human Centipede
Make it a group effort and seize your chance to truly disgust
everyone you know ... just like the real movie!
Any character from "The Hunger Games"
Expect the film adaptation of the first novel in Suzanne
Collins' dystopian series to be blowing up everywhere on
March 23, 2012. While the series is already wildly popular, this
Halloween may be your last chance to take advantage of a
"Hunger Games" costume before Katniss and Co. suffer
cultural fatigue.
