It started with academics. He received a scholar
ship to St. John's University in New York and
graduated magna cum laude. The whole time
there was an idea brewing. He had a passion, a skill,
which he dreamed would one day make him big. A
few years after graduating, it did. Sound like a start
up story? It is, of sorts. It's the backstory of up-and
coming rapper Jermaine Cole, more commonly
known by his stage name, J. Cole.
After dropping his first official album, "Cole
World: The Sideline Story," in late September, Cole's
position in the rap world was solidified. The album
debuted at number one on the charts and quickly
added members to his already prominent fan base.

However, listeners may be unaware of Cole's
rather academic beginnings. He grew up in North
Carolina and became interested in hip-hop and rap
at an early age. At the age of 14, Cole started writing
his own rhymes and making his own beats on a
Roland TR-808 machine. He told stories through his
music and quickly realized he wanted to sculpt a
career out of his love for rap.
After graduating high school, Cole sought a col
lege where he could gain as much exposure to the
music industry as possible. He received an academic
scholarship to St. John's University, which he accept
ed because of the school's proximity to New York
City and the music industry moguls located there.
Cole graduated magna cum laude from St.
John's in 2007 with a degree in communications and
a minor in business. This somewhat unusual feat in
the hip-hop world allows Cole to proclaim on his
website that he took a "scholarly approach to the
game."
The same year he graduated, he dropped his
first mixtape, "The Come Up," which caused few
reverberations within the hip-hop community.
Experiencing a slow beginning to his career, Cole
was persistent in his attempts to make it big, sending
his mixtape to big-name hip-hop artists.

Luck struck when one such artist heard some
thing he liked on Cole's mixtape. In 2009, Brooklyn
based rapper and producer Jay-Z decided to sign
Cole as the first artist to his Roc Nation label. Cole
