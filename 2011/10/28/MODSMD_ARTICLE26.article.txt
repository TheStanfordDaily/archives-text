In Drake Doremus' "Like Crazy," Anton
Yelchin and Felicity Jones star as Jacob and
Anna, an American and a Brit respectively,
whose relationship becomes compromised
when Anna violates her student visa and is
banned from the United States. Tracking their
lives for the first few years after they initially
meet, the film explores how Jacob and Anna
grapple with being long-distance while also
trying to make it in the world as adults. Like a
bittersweet ode to 20-somethings, this is a
romantic drama that feels fresh, honest and
real.
Anna is a student in her final year at a Los
Angeles college when she decides to pluck up
the courage to ask out her cute TA, Jacob, via a
handwritten note left on his windshield. The
two share an endearingly awkward first date,
which quickly escalates to budding romance.
Before they know it graduation is upon them,
along with Anna's inevitable return to the UK.
But on the eve of her departure she decides to
stay, unwittingly instigating a legal mess that will
take many months, headaches and tears to
unravel. Barred from leaving LAX after a quick
trip home for a friend s wedding, Anna has no
choice but to go back.
At first the couple is optimistic, appealing
Anna's case and trying to stay in touch as much
as possible, but life simply gets in the way.
Their separation through time and space puts
a damper on the relationship that is only exac
erbated by the added challenges of adulthood;
as Jacob and Anna soon discover, living solo
and embarking on exciting new career paths
leaves time for little else. Jacob can only afford
to visit every so often, and while the chemistry
between them is always present, their lives
diverge once more during the interludes, when
other suitors drift in and out of the picture.

Unlike most
other romantic
fare, "Like
Crazy" never
tries to vilify
the other signifi-

cant others, which
for Jacob is his assistant Samantha (Jennifer
Lawrence), and for Anna her neighbor Simon
(Charlie Bewley). We never stop rooting for
Jacob and Anna, of course, but at the same
time Sam and Simon are too caring and gen
uine for us to resent. Jacob and Anna know it
too but perhaps, as they say, you simply never
forget your first love. At times it feels as though
Jacob isn't as fleshed out as his partner
while we see a lot of Anna's parents, we never
meet his but overall the story offers a bal
anced perspective on the relationship and its
future.
Yelchin and Jones are both rising stars
whose raw performances lend an organic qual
ity that is often missing from the typical studio
pictures vying for the same young audience.
Doremus lets the audience read into changes in
the characters, which tend to lie in subtle
details like a new writing desk or haircut as a
sign of a new promotion.
As much as "Like Crazy" is about love, it is
also about growing up and finding one's way in
life. Perhaps that's why it resonated so much
for me in a mere matter of months I will be
moving out, entering the job market and
becoming a real person. But unlike other films
I've seen, this didn't make me fear for the
future. Everything has away of sorting itself
out, it seems to suggest, so long as you don't
cross immigration.
