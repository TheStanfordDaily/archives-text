No band in the
world transforms
quite as much as
Coldplay.
The British group has
reimagined itself five times
now, the latest product of
which is its newest album,
"Mylo Xyloto." Yes, "Mylo

Xyloto." It means nothing, which
everyone should supposedly find compelling.
Lead singer Chris Martin gave some inane
explanation about xylophone toes as the inspi
ration for "Mylo Xyloto" (which, by the way, is
pronounced XY-luh-toe), which Martin
described to Billboard.com as a concept album
about "a kind of romance in an oppressive envi
ronment. It's sort of a love story."
The cover of the album might be more
telling. The chosen image is a swirl of hallu
cinogenic-looking graffiti. It's chaotic and a far
cry from the Delacroix painting chosen for
Coldplay's last album, "Viva La Vida or Death
and All His Friends." It's, in a word, mystifying.
In fact, "Mylo" moves in the opposite
direction of "Viva La Vida" in many ways.
Where the latter was grand, bombastic, political
and a little bit pompous, "Mylo" is modern,
quieter, romantic and a little bit Utopian.
Unfortunately, the end result is a somewhat dis
jointed collection of songs there's a common
theme, yes, but it's approached from north,
south, east and west. Fortunately, "Mylo" still
sounds good.
It seems Coldplay albums have become a
bit of a guessing game can we still find snip
pets of what the band used to sound like? The
answer is a relieved yes; "Paradise," for instance,
is by far the best song on "Mylo," mainly
because you can still discern natural instru
ments in the background. Of course, you also
hear a piano-driven melody and Martin's ado
lescent-sounding falsetto but that is, after all,
what made Coldplay so popular in the first
place. There's no need to fix what hasn't yet

broken after 15 years.
"Mylo" is often simple and contemplative,
a side of Coldplay that hasn't been seen in a
while but has brought some of their greatest
successes (think "The Scientist"). Both"U.F.O."
and "Us Against the World" are more decon
structed Coldplay songs featuring a gentle gui
tar strum, the rare tenor version of Chris
Martin's voice and idyllic lyrics that articulate
the heart of the album (" Through chaos as it
swirls/It's us against the world').
Coldplay borders on cliche in their
metaphors in "Mylo," but more often than not,
the songs are too over-produced to notice, and
in the right places, they're spot-on. The lyrics of
"Princess of China," for instance, would not be
out of place on a Taylor Swift album, but
Martin and Rihanna's voices, along with some
strong Eastern influences a combo that
shouldn't work but does anyway make for a
listenable song. Nonetheless, Coldplay very
rarely collaborates, and though Rihanna thank
fully fits the song style, such a big name duet
seems a little "charristic" instead of artistic.
The most telling, though, are the inter
ludes. The first, "Mylo Xyloto," seems a quick
transition from the pomp of "Viva La Vida";
"M.M.1.X." again, no one knows what it
means is a slow build of literally two chords
(uncertainty in the romance?); "A Hopeful
Transmission" sounds like an incarnation of tri
umph. In all, the original concept is portrayed
with just the right precision in just two minutes
of playtime; if only the songs followed suit,
"Mylo" might be perfect.
As its albums are released, Coldplay seems
to wander more little by little, and by take five,
Coldplay is split in half — a part of the group
has returned to square one, while the other half
is relishing the over-produced sounds that
began to develop by the "X&Y" era. Fortunately,
they're Coldplay, and for that reason, it eventu
ally makes sense.
