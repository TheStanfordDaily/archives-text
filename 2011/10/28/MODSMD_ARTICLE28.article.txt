It's fitting that after debuting her singing
chops to the mainstream consciousness in
"Elf" Zooey Deschanel is finally getting her
chance to take a stab at a Christmas album
with "A Very She & Him Christmas."
M. Ward, the Portland folkie who com
prises the Him in She & Him, sings much
more on this record than past ones, which is a
welcome change. But for the most part, it's still
very much the Zooey Deschanel show (kind
of like that sitcom she's got going on Fox). The
duo offers their adorable take on classics like
"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree," "Have
Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" and "Sleigh
Ride." Their "Rockin' Around the Christmas
Tree" is utterly charming, as is "Little Saint
Nick." The melancholy "Blue Christmas" pro
vides a tender showcase for Deschanel's sim
ple, winsome vocals. "Silver Bells" falters on the
dull and drab side of things, but one dud out
of a dozen songs is nothing to poo-poo about.
Naturally, they would be remiss not to
include "Baby, It's Cold Outside," the song
Deschanel first crooned in "Elf." Here, they
speed up the tune a bit and offer a bin gender

Although it's not even Halloween yet,
the annual slew of Christmas album
releases has already begun. Leading
the pack is Michael Buble, who released his
aptly titled Christmas album, "Christmas,"
this week.
Admittedly, it's a bit odd reviewing a
Christmas album while trying to figure out
what to wear to the Halloween party on

switch-up, with Deschanel tackling Dean
Martin's part as she tries to coax Ward out of
his fruitless attempts to leave. For authenticity's
sake, Deschanel's voice is even double-tracked
as it is in the original.

The She & Him Christmas collection is
exactly what you'd expect: a pleasing, nostalgic
little record to complement your "Christmas
with the Rat Pack" albums during the holiday
season or satiate your Christmas craving when
it kicks up mid-July. Christmas carol purists
can stick with ol' Dino and Frank, and for hip
sters, Sufjan Stevens' "Songs For Christmas"
still takes the cake when it comes to moody,
indie carols. As far as holiday records go, "A
Very She & Him Christmas" is firmly planted
somewhere in the middle a safe, harmless
compilation of ditties that can comfortably
settle in your Christmas playlist somewhere
between the Vince Guaraldi Trio and Susan
Boyle's next holiday album.

Friday night,
but a quick listen of the album will convince
you that it warrants a little more attention.
Buble, known for his jazz styling reminis
cent of Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Ray
Charles, has had remarkable success in the
genre, and this album promises to perform.
Since it's an unspoken crime against
Christmas music to not include the usual
suspects, Buble covers the bases with "Jingle
Bells," "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,"
"Feliz Navidad" and more. The "more" is
what

is interesting about this album.
Buble's styling jazzy, sultry and a bit
out of place for modern music slows down
songs, such as his cover of Mariah Carey's "All I
Want For Christmas Is You," so you can fully
appreciate just what this man is capable of
doing with his vocal chords. At certain points,
it sounds as though Buble is channeling Elvis,
especially when he hits those low notes in "I'll

Be Home For Christmas."
Several duets are featured on the album:
Shania Twain in "White Christmas," the
Puppini Sisters in "Jingle Bells" and Thalia in
"Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad." The duets are fine,
but not essential though the guest spots do
add something to the songs, the music
would've been fine with or without them.
Coming from someone who isn't typically

into Christmas music, I considered this album
pretty acceptable. It's the kind of Christmas
album you would buy if you were looking to
impress someone during the holidays. Play this
in the background of an intimate Christmas
gathering or date, and you've got yourself the
perfect atmosphere.

Bottom line: it's a little early to start think
ing about Christmas music, but if you're look

ing to impress someone special, enjoy jazz or
are a fan of Michael Buble, "Christmas" is
worth checking out.
