It's that time of year. Bust out your "Party with
Leland" tank, prep the candy corn and get
that rally gear ready: it's decorative gourd
season, also known as Halloweekend. Whether
you'll be spending All Hallows' Eve out by ol'
Jane and Leland, screaming in the stands of
USC's Coliseum or tucked away watching
"Rosemary's Baby," these music videos will help
you get in the m00d... for fear.
"No One Believes Me" by Kid Cudi
This paranoiac track, featured in this sum
mer's remake of the 'Bos classic "Fright Night",
burns slowly to Kid Cudi's incantations of
isolation and suspicion. Director Craig Gillespie
sprinkles a "Let the Right One In" vibe on this
clear homage to the zesty feature film as Cudi
saunters through the lonely suburbs flashing
fangs and stalking his prey.
"99 Problems" by Hugo
Another favorite from "Fright Night", this
bizarre blue-grass cover of Jay-Z's 'O4 hit spins
the gangster anthem into an eerie banjo strain.
Blood-spattered torture chambers bedecked with
drooping chains and red-lit iguanas set the stage
for grisly hooligans, Hugo and yes, even fighting
ladies of questionable moral standing a
problem? You decide.
"Helena Beat" by Foster the People
From the indie-pop people who brought us
summer's other favorite sublimely creepy hit
"Pumped Up Kicks", this song plays like a sequel,
only this time the kids have taken over in a post
apocalyptic free-for-all. Part "Mad Max", part
"Children of the Corn", the video shows a savage

band of children terrorizing the captive band
members.
"Monster" by Kanye West feat. Jay-Z,
Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross and Bon Iver
Every song from this album could probably
make it onto the list, but it's the perverted visuals
and stellar performances of this video that make
it the most memorable and creepiest track
of "MBDTF." West supplies the hook, and Jay-Z
and Rick Ross deliver ample verses about their
money-making monster statuses, but it's Minaj's
theatrical performance both in verse and in
video that takes "Monster" from visual expose
to cinematic delight.
"Thriller" by Michael Jackson
You read "spookiest music videos" and you
knew "Thriller" would make it on the list. But
before you go patting yourself on the back for
having "ESPN or something," remember that
this zombie-werewolf hybrid from the King of
Pop is a classic for good reason. At 13 minutes,
this movie within a movie realizes every
youngster's greatest fear that his or her beau
is actually a varsity jacket-sporting square by
day, red leather jacket-wearing freak by night.
Complete with a dancing zombie flash mob and
Michael's killer moves set to funky beats and a
ghoulish voice-over, "Thriller" guarantees to
grace spooky playlists and Halloween dance
parties for years to come.
