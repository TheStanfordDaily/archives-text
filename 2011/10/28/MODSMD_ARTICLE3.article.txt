NO. 20 USC [6-1,3-1 PAC-12)

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 52, USC 27: No Stanford fan
should ever feel safe making the trip to the Coliseum to
take on USC, and it has nothing to do with the stadium's
lack of security. The past two trips have resulted in the
"Biggest Upset Ever" and a Toby Gerhart clinic, but
while Matt Barkley is vastly overrated, the Trojans still
scare me with Robert Woods. That being said, no one in
the country can stop the Tunnel Workers Union and ex
pect Andrew Luck to shine under center against a sus
pect Trojan defense that gambles far too often. USC is
gaining confidence after knocking off Notre Dame, but
the Fighting Irish are quite honestly terrible, and I ex
pect Stanford to light up the scoreboard even if Woods
lights up the Cardinal secondary. Expect some fire
works, but Stanford sends the SC fans home early and
keeps its streak of 11 straight victories of 25 or more
points alive with three touchdowns in the third quarter.

JACK BLANCHAT
STANFORD 42, USC 21 : I don't see Stanford
dropping this game unless it gets caught up in the
intangibles the lights, the crowd and the atmosphere
will all be major distractions, but I think this Cardinal team
is too experienced and mature to let the big stage mess it
up. The Trojans (especially Robert Woods) will make the
Cardinal defense bleed a little bit, but Stanford's offense
is hitting on all cylinders right now, with Andrew Luck still
being Andrew Luck and the run game rolling. But the 25-
point blowout streak ends here, unfortunately.

JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 41, USC 24: Yet again, Stanford
faces its toughest test of the year. The last few times, it's
gone pretty well for the Cardinal, but USC is a different
animal. Matt Barkley and Robert Woods provide an
enormous challenge, as Stanford remembers all too
well from Woods' 224 yards and three touchdowns in
last year's matchup. Without Delano Howell, tackling will
be a major area of concern for the Cardinal. It could
come down to Stanford's pass rush (fourth in the nation
in sacks) versus USC's offensive line (fifth in the nation
in sacks allowed). Even if this is a stalemate, the
Cardinal offense has a clear advantage over the Trojan
defense, which relies far too heavily on turnovers. Last
year, Stanford was uncharacteristically minus-three in
turnover margin against USC, yet the Cardinal still won
the game. This time around, Stanford will take care of
the ball and take care of USC, 41 -24.
