## A 						visit from Lemony Snicket 
### â€“ sarah GUAN contact sarah: sguan@stanford. edu 
San Jose's not exactly the first place you
would think to head to for a book read
ing, especially given the plethora of liter
ary events happening right here on campus.

Daniel Handler, however, reading from his
2006 book "Adverbs" and introducing his
forthcoming novel, "Why We Broke Up," was
well worth the trip. He is better known as
Lemony Snicket, the narrator of the interna
tionally bestselling "A Series of Unfortunate
Events" and the darkly humorous voice for
which Snicket is known translates wonderfully
to Handler's other works, his stage presence
and his conversation.

Bookending the talk by reading passages
from the aforementioned books, Handler

began with an excerpt from a chapter of
"Adverbs" entitled "Immediately." The book is
comprised of 17 interconnected vignettes, each
featuring a different take on love as described
by its title adjective. In this particular story, the
protagonist breaks up with his girlfriend after
the reading of a will, gets into a cab and
promptly becomes infatuated with the increas
ingly nonplussed driver, whom he propositions

over coffee. Handler closed with a passage from
"Why We Broke Up," written as an extended

break-up letter from the protagonist Min to
her erstwhile boyfriend, Ed. It was chock-full of
awkward teenage disillusionment and the casu
al, mindless cruelty that's characteristic of

young adults everywhere, proof that Handler
can capture equally well the nuances of chil
dren, adults and everyone in between. One
could see the audience a good mix of col-

lege students, faculty and community members
alternately cringe and chuckle nervously as
particularly apt turns of phrase and exquisitely
unvarnished details struck a little too close to
home.

Both passages showcased Handler's
unique perspective on human interaction, as
filtered through a hilariously unreliable narra
tor and spiced with what he calls "volcanic
imagery." His vivid writing style is, by his own
estimation, influenced by having begun his
career as a poet.

"I studied poetry in college, and the
poems I wrote kept getting longer and longer"
he said. "So eventually, one of my professors
said to me, 'You know, there's actually a name
for what you're doing it's called prose, and
you might want to try it.'" He is a voracious
and omnivorous reader and retains a special
fondness for poetry; he keeps poems in his
wallet (partially, he admits, "because [he is]
married"). When pressed for a particular
favorite, he pulled out his wallet and read a
Robin Robertson poem entitled

"Hammersmith Winter." For all that Handler's
default voice is dry wit, his range extends
effortlessly to understated poignancy.
The body of the talk consisted of a ques
tion and answer session, well suited to the

small lecture hall that hosted the event.

Handler discussed everything from "A Series
of Unfortunate Events" to the inspiration for
his varied body of work and the writing life.
He fielded several questions about his appar
ent pessimism and the endless misfortunes
that happen to his characters. He explained
that, when writing the series, he "knew how it
would end, and some of the things that hap
pened in between, but I didn't really know
how I'd get there. So I carried around this list
of terrible things that could happen to [the
protagonists]."

"I'm not a pessimist, but interesting stories
are usually about bad things happening. So it's
fun to think about," he added.

When Handler chatted with Intermission
earlier this week, the author admitted he didn't
have a particularly unfortunate childhood; he
merely "has the kind of brain that imagines terri
ble things happening." It's even worse, he says,
now that he has a son; Handler admits to "brain
storming about all the ways he can get hurt."
"The house suddenly looks much more
dangerous: there are stairs, plugs, kitchen

knives it's like a bonus list of terrible things,"
he added.

Near the end of the event, Handler was
asked to impart a few words of wisdom to

young writers. His short answer was "carry a
notebook." In contemplating craft, however, he
returned to his first love, poetry.
"Poetry is good for the brain," he said,
"especially for writers. It's the details poets
work on sentences, and that's what novels are
made of." He is conscious of sound and of
rhythm.

"I read everything I write aloud," he said.
He admits that reading to oneself, and writ
ing, can "make you feel like a crazy person,
talking and thinking obsessively about some
thing that nobody else is thinking."
"It's not lonely," Handler continued, "but
it's odd."

he added.

Near the end of the event, Handler was
asked to impart a few words of wisdom to

young writers. His short answer was "carry a
notebook." In contemplating craft, however, he
returned to his first love, poetry.
"Poetry is good for the brain," he said,
"especially for writers. It's the details poets
work on sentences, and that's what novels are
made of." He is conscious of sound and of
rhythm.

"I read everything I write aloud," he said.
He admits that reading to oneself, and writ
ing, can "make you feel like a crazy person,
talking and thinking obsessively about some
thing that nobody else is thinking."
"It's not lonely," Handler continued, "but
it's odd."
