## PHO VI HOA: PERFECT FOR FLU SEASON (OR ANY SEASON) 
### — evie DANFORTH contact evie: erdanfor@stanford. edu 
Flu season is upon us. Eight peo
ple had hacking coughs in my
econ lecture on Monday. As a
precautionary measure, the girls in my
sorority house have scaled back on
grabbing big handfuls of leftover mac
aroni and cheese from the fridge with
their bare hands after nights out on
the Row. And I got an urgent, sniffy
phone call this morning from a friend
asking me to get her Zicam from the
store (aside: you've got to be really sick
to buy a homeopathic "medicine" that
the FDA has determined results in
permanent losses to the user's sense of
smell).
There's only one cool thing about
getting the flu in my book, and that's
the excuse to throw on sweatpants and
drive to Pho Via Hoa in Mountain
View for cheap, bucket-sized portions
of pho.
So what exactly is pho? Put sim
ply, it's a traditional Vietnamese noo
dle dish. Think chicken noodle soup,
but Asian and without the gross slimy
sheen the canned Campbell's stuff
always has all over the noodles. Pho
varies across different regions in

Vietnam, but it's basically a big bowl
of stock-based broth mixed in with
thin rice noodles and topped with
meat (usually beef, maybe chicken),
bean sprouts, chili peppers, cilantro,
raw onions, basil and lime. For the flu
afflicted, it's enough of a meal to keep
your feverish limbs from collapsing
under you, but still not too heavy.
Plus, it's sinus-clearing and (kind of)
has vegetables involved. In short, pho
is God's answer to sick days. We are all
deeply indebted to the people of
Vietnam for bringing it to the United
States.
But whether stricken by flu or not,
Pho Vi Hoa is one of my go-to places for
a number of reasons. The cavernous
space, lit by halogen and filled with poly
ester, bright green banquettes isn't exact
ly glamorous —or really ambient at all.
Still, it's nice enough to take both your
hardcore foodie friends and your lame
friends who don't think every meal
should be a dramatic reenactment of an
episode of "No Reservations with
Anthony Bourdain."
The service itself is friendly, fast
and efficient, which is another plus.

Most of my favorite
places to eat around
campus apparently
make hiring deci
sions based on who
can do the best Sue
Sylvester imperson
ation, so being able
to get really great,
cheap food without
having feel like
Rachel Barry wear
ing a grape-slushy-

stained argyle sweater after a particu
larly bad breakup with Finn (appar
ently "Glee" metaphors can extend
forever, even in a restaurant review)
is a major point in Pho Vi Hoa's
favor.
The pho itself is the best I've had
in the Bay Area. Fly-by-night pho
places often dish out vats of noodles in
broth that tastes like just hot water
or worse, like the stuff you find in Cup
of Noodles. At Pho Vi Hoa, the broth
is flavorful and complex; it sets the
perfect backdrop to the soup's ingredi
ents, which are all made with obvious
ly fresh, high-quality ingredients.

$6.85 for a small bowl and $7.85 for a
large (which is almost inappropriately
large, for the record) means you
almost can't afford not to eat at Pho Vi
Hoa.
And lest you get sick of pho, the
restaurant also has a great lineup of
other healthy Vietnamese options. I'm
especially partial to the creatively
named "C-03," which is a plate of per
fectly grilled chicken, steamed rice,
assorted vegetables, a truly excellent
dipping sauce (not sure what's in it,
just tastes good) and a small cup of
piping hot chicken broth. At only
$8.20, it's more than enough food for

one person. The fried egg rolls ($2.00)
and homemade lemonade ($2.75) are
also not to be missed.
Pho Vi Hoa is the real deal a
perfect option just 10 minutes from
campus for flu season and beyond.
