International Studies and School of Education will

vest time and tens of thousands of pupils exploited
by the government through forced labor in the
fields.

Art of Eating Healthy," a panel focused on Patricia

Peruvian gastronomy and Avis Richards and Israel
Bonequi's "Lunch," which explores America's junk
