## 'GREGORY' BORROWS TOO MUCH FROM THE GRIFFINS 
### â€” aaron BRODER contact aaron: abrader@stanford. edu 
Fox is clearly desperate for
a new animated sitcom to
fill its scheduling gaps.
Even Seth MacFarlane himself
admitted that "Family Guy"
should have ended a while ago.
At least, that's the only expla
nation I can come up with for

the new show "Allen Gregory," which is writ
ten by and stars "Superbad" funnyman
Jonah Hill. Despite an interesting concept,
the show seems to be relying on the star
power behind it instead of good writing or
funny jokes. Unfortunately, if it's going to
keep its coveted slot right after "The
Simpsons," it's going to have to do a whole
lot more.
The show's about Allen Gregory
DeLongpre, the world's "most pretentious"
seven-year old, who's forced to go to public
school when his dads start worrying about
their financial situation. The episode is a little
bit too focused on getting this story set up, to
the point where I feel like I don't know most
of the characters in the universe. Julie, his
adopted Cambodian sister who looks like
she'll be filling in for the role of the only sane
person, particularly suffers from this focus; I
can't really figure out what part she plays in
the family outside of occasionally making
snide comments. There's nothing wrong
with having a character like that; she just
needs to be more integrated into the cast.

It's very apparent that
"Family Guy," one of the behe
moths of Fox's Animation
Domination lineup, has heavily
influenced the show. Though the
creators were careful to distin
guish themselves from the
MacFarlane art style which

actually resulted in a pretty cool '6os-inspired
design you can easily see other places
where they modeled themselves after the
Griffin family. On a surface level, Allen
Gregory isn't that far off from Stewie (minus
the British accent and the maniacal plans),
and while not everyone hates Julie, her char
acter definitely seems to be an analogue to
Meg. But it's also had a much deeper influ
ence on the show, right down to its sense of
humor.
That's where "Allen Gregory" ends up
failing, which is pretty damning for a half
hour comedy. The writers seem to be aiming
for the same jokes as "Family Guy" (namely
ones that go too far for too long), but they
seem to have forgotten about the funny part.
The long "jokes" like Allen Gregory's minute
long fantasy about his 70 year-old principal,
or the implication that his dad aggressively
pursued his (formerly, and possibly currently
straight) partner until he gave in, just feel
uncomfortable. When the show goes on
these tangents, I'm not laughing; I'm just
waiting for it to move on to the next part.

Much of what I find fault in is the type
of thing that often shows up in pilots. At this
point in the show, the writers don't really
know what it's going to be about, and it's
inevitable that they'll look to other successful
shows as a guide. My advice to the writers is
to instead look to distinguishing "Allen
Gregory" more from the other shows in Fox's
animated comedy block. There's already so
much homogeneity there that something
new would be a welcome addition, and
they're more likely to succeed if they find
their own groove rather than being a poor
imitation of another show. Simply changing
up their art style isn't enough; they need to
change up their sense of humor.
