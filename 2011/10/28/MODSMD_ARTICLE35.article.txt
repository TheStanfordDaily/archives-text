# ADVICE
## ROXY SASS GETTHAT SLUTTY PUMPKIN 
### 
At Stanford, there are plenty of
opportunities to dress up in
costume, but Roxy still has a
special place in her heart for
Halloween. Maybe it's because the
holiday is all about chocolate and
immediate gratification, but there's
something about All Hallows' Eve
that really gets her going. Roxy has
big plans for the next few days, and
she's happy to share tips on how to
make the most out of your
Halloweekend... or just how to
make out the most.
Costume Contest
Roxy likes to think outside the box in
and out of the bedroom, and
Halloween is no exception. While
there's nothing wrong with your
standard slutty French maid or fire
fighter costume, Roxy tries to branch
out beyond her ordinary Friday
night apparel. Feeling political?
Incorporate the latest protests into
your outfit choice (Roxy definitely
wants to occupy your bed). Looking
to embrace Silicon Valley (or some
one in it)? Dress as your favorite
social network and let others poke
away, tweet at you or Link In.
Whatever your costume, Roxy sug
gests you plan ahead; if your cos
tume can't get off, no one will.
Mausoleum Party
Some might say that Mausoleum
Party blows, but Roxy doesn't see
that as a bad thing. Known to attract
more freshmen than upperclassmen,
Mausoleum is a great chance for
Roxy to try out her new cougar cos
tume, and she is ready to pounce. As

soon as Roxy finds her prey for the
evening, there are plenty of dark cor
ners to sneak off to. When heading
out to your own private afterparty,
Roxy suggests you avoid the cactus
garden... for obvious reasons.
If all-campus parties aren't your
thing, Roxy knows all kinds of ways
to find the Dr. F to your monster.
Roxy's heard that pumpkin might be
an aphrodisiac, and after a particu
larly involved two-person carving
session, you'll definitely have to clean
off. Jump in the shower together to
help get pumpkin off of those hard
to-reach places. While it might be
cliche, Roxy's also willing to use scary
movies to make her move. If this
week's showing of "Paranormal
Activity" goes as intended, Roxy
plans to be up to her normal activity
soon after. And for those of you sad
dened by your roommate's departure
to USC, Roxy suggests you make
good use of your room for the week
end. If you're looking for ideas,
Roxy's always happy to help.
Roxy knows plenty of tricks, and she's
confident they'll give you a treat. Ring
her doorbell by emailing
