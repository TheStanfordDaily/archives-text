# SUPER CROSS
## First Pac-12 titles up for grabs 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
While the football team continues to eat
up headlines almost as fast as its running
backs eat up yards, Stanford's first Pac-12
title in any sport could very well come from
the men's and women's cross country
teams, which will take to the course tomor
row morning in Litchfield Park, Ariz, for
the first-ever Pac-12 Championships.
Both teams are ranked in the top 10 na
tionally the men are No. 4 and women
No. 8 and swept the team titles at last
year's race. But although the men are slight
favorites over No. 6 Colorado heading into
the race, the women will face stiff chal
lenges from a very deep field. No. 2 Wash
ington, No. 5 Arizona, No. 10 California and
No. 11 Oregon are all expected to be factors
in the race, and this year the final results
could be even closer than last year's, when
four teams finished within six points of one
another.

The Cardinal women will once again
look to the leadership of two-time Ail-
American Kathy Kroeger. The junior from
Franklin, Tenn. finished second to Oregon
phenom Jordan Hasay who again is the
pre-race favorite at last year's race, and
has put together an impressive junior cam
paign with a win at the Stanford Invitation
al and a lOth-place finish at the Wisconsin

Adidas Invitational.
Kroeger paces the squad, but freshman
Aisling Cuffe has performed well in her
own right in her first year on the Farm, and
redshirt senior Stephanie Marcy has a his
tory of coming up clutch in big meets. Cuffe
finished second to Kroeger at the Stanford
Invitational this year and was a U.S. Junior
Champion in high school, while Marcy
placed fifth at last year's Pac-10 Champi
onship and is a three-time All-American.
In order to win the team's 15th confer
ence title, however, they will need help, pos
sibly in the form of sophomore Jessica Tonn
or freshman Molly McNamara. Tonn fin
ished eighth at last year's Pac-lOs and Mc-
Namara has shown flashes of brilliance
early in her college career with a top-10 fin
ish at the Stanford Invitational.

The men's side is not expected to be as
crowded, with the Buffaloes, Cardinal and
No. 20 UCLA the only teams inside the top
20. But Colorado is brimming with confi
dence after winning the NCAA Pre-Na
tional Invitational last weekend. Stanford
and several other top teams did not com
pete in the race, but led by senior Andy
Wacker, the Buffs could make some noise.

It will help that the Cardinal might have
the best one-two punch in the nation with
the senior duo of Chris Derrick and Jake
Riley. Derrick finished third behind Riley
and graduated senior Elliot Heath at last
year's Pac-lOs, but won the same race in
2009 and was sixth at last year's NCAA
Championships, one spot ahead of Riley.
