## RESEARCH HP and Lucile Packard test new dashboard Digital dashboards seek to improve care 
### LARA MITRA 
Hewlett-Packard and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital
teamed up to introduce electronic,
"patient-centered" dashboards in
the hospital on Stanford's campus,
hoping to replace hand-written
white boards and improve patient
care.

With just a few clicks, the digital
dashboards provide caregivers with
patient records, real-time updates
on a patient and a "checklist" of
what needs to be done, aimed at
minimizing human error and maxi
mizing efficiency. A system of
green, yellow and red lights indicate
the urgency of a potential medical
complication and aims to help doc
tors decide where to focus their at
tention.

Changes to patient care were
made in one-third of cases when the
digital dashboard was used instead
of a whiteboard, according to an HP
press release.

Each column on the dashboard
displays information about various
patient needs, such as when a cen
tral venous catheter must be re
placed or which sedatives should be
prescribed. The columns also pro
vide quick 'reminders' to caregivers
of things to do when visiting a pa
tient, such as turning the patient to
prevent ulcers.
The hospital has been involved
in various national quality and safe
ty initiatives in the past. In summer
2010, in collaboration with HP, a
group of doctors and other health
care providers from the hospital
gathered to discuss the possibility of
creating a technological device that
would provide "clinical decision
support."

They contemplated the idea of

an electronic dashboard system that
would present patient data in an or
ganized way, and researchers from
HP worked to gather the relevant
information from vast amounts of
patient data. They then channeled
this information into the electronic
dashboard, hoping to create a help
ful tool in medical decision-making.
Dr. Deborah Franzon, clinical
assistant professor of pediatrics at
the hospital, conducted a research
study in which she evaluated the ef
fects of installing the dashboards in
the pediatric intensive care unit
(PICU). For her work, Franzon re
ceived the Innovations in Patient
Care Award, a $25,000 internal
grant awarded to creative thinkers,
which, along with funding from HP,
helped enable implementation of
the dashboards.
"What I had envisioned when we
first started planning was that this
would be kind of like a jeopardy
board," Franzon said. "Where you
would see the visual red, yellow and
green colors and click on them to
receive more information."

The dashboard program was
launched in May 2011 in the hospi
tal's PICU. During the first month
of this pilot program, research nurs
es from HP and extra nurse practi
tioners were available to aid doc
tors and nurses navigate and make
use of the dashboard.

"We had a three month imple
mentation period where we collect
ed and audited data, tweaking little
pieces with the programmers to up
date, modify and add new features
to the dashboard," Franzon said.
The system is currently up and
running with real-time content.
Franzon believes that overall, nurs
es and staff have been excited about
using the dashboard, which was
specifically designed to be user
friendly and to require only limited
training.
"The system is not just for physi
cians, but is multidisciplinary in that
it engages all care providers at the
bedside to have a conversation,"
Franzon said.

Through this approach, the
healthcare providers hope to create
an integrated atmosphere to better
engage with their patients and staff
and save more lives. The hospital
plans to conduct a survey later this
month in which they will assess if
staff perception of communication
in the ICU has changed since the

implementation of the dashboard.
Though there have been no ef
forts yet to spread the electronic
dashboard model to other hospitals
around the country, Franzon said
she believes that this is a possibility.
Three other doctors from the Chil
dren's hospital, Dr. Natalie Pageler,
Dr. Jaap Suermondt and Dr. Chris
Longhurst, presented the dash
board to various health and infor
matics experts at the American
Medical Informatics Association's
(AMIA) 35th Annual Symposium
on Biomedical and Health Infor
matics in Washington, D.C. on Oct.
26.
