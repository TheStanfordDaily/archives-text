## Park set to replace Terman Engineering Center after ongoing demolition 
### KELSEY DAYTON 
The Frederick Emmons Ter
man Engineering Center, which
has housed Stanford's engineer
ing program since the 19705, is
currently being demolished. The
space is scheduled to become a
neighborhood park in time for
autumn quarter 2012.

The demolition of the Terman
building is part of SEQ2, the Uni
versity's 2005 master plan to re
design the science and engineer
ing quad. Terman's inclusion in
the project was as much practical
as aesthetic. The iconic building
features laminated wood beams
that protrude, and multiple
decades of exposure to the ele

ments have taken their toll. The
"advanced deterioration" of
these beams was a "major factor
in the University's decision to
raze the building," said project
manager Matthew Griffis.
A defining feature of the dem
olition and construction project is
the commitment to sustainability.
Stanford claims that 99 percent of
the materials will be salvaged and
recycled in various ways. For ex
ample, recycled materials cited by
the Sustainable Stanford pro
gram include the Terman roof
tiles, to be reused in the West
Campus Recreation Center and
Arrillaga Family Sports Center
projects; concrete pavers, to be
utilized in the Petersen-Mitchell

courtyard renovation; and exteri
or lighting fixtures, to be incorpo
rated in the new park.
The demolition stage of the
project will continue through the
winter and the grading stage will
take place in the spring, according
to Griffis.

"The park is anticipated to be
open by summer of next year,"
Griffis said.

Until then, the Stanford engi
neering quad will continue to fea
ture construction sites that can
sometimes impede sidewalks.
Brad Moylan 'l3 is excited
about the new changes.
