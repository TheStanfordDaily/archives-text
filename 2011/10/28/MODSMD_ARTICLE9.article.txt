## FAFSA proves difficult for LGBT groups 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
Students and University officials
have recently scrutinized the Free Ap
plication for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA) in response to an Oct. 17 New
York Times article about FAFSA's in
ability to accommodate students with
same-sex parents and students who are
no longer receiving financial support
from their parents.

Stanford Director of Financial Aid
Karen Cooper said that Stanford col
lects financial information via the Col
lege Scholarship Service (CSS) Profile,
which asks for "Parent 1" and "Parent
2" as opposed to "Mother" and "Fa
ther."
Although the FAFSA has become

more flexible over the years, it still does
not provide a clear way of marking
whether a student has same-sex parents.
This problem makes the process of ap
plying for financial aid especially diffi
cult for students with same-sex parents
due to the form's demand of a "Mother"
and "Father" category.
"The parents of these families are
very willing and want to participate in
their student's education," Cooper said.
"These families fought so hard to be a
family in the first place. They want to
support their children."

Another issue with the FAFSA aris
es when students declare themselves fi
nancially independent from their par
ents. Federally, a student is declared in
dependent once he or she reaches age

24, if he or she is an orphan, ward of
court, adopted, a veteran, has children
or is married.

At Stanford, however, the Financial
Aid Office assumes students under the
age of 25 have the support of their par
ents.

When applying for financial aid, the
office requires parental information, re
gardless of whether or not the parents
can help pay for their student's educa
tion. Without this information, Stanford
will not award financial aid.

Cooper said that obtaining the finan
cial profile of a student isn't just about
reporting the amount of money a family
can contribute in supporting their child,
