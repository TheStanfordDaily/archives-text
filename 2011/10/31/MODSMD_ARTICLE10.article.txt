## HALLOWEEN HAUNT 
### ANDREW DUONG 
As I stepped off the Marguerite bus onto the
gravel road, I saw two strands of orange lights
beckoning me toward the steps of the Stanford
Mausoleum.
As I made my way to the building, I spotted a gorilla
chasing a banana, black swans dancing and human-animals
crawling on the ground certainly not the sights one
often associates with a graveyard.
After traversing a sea of faux animals, celebrities and
monsters, I reached the venue. Cobwebs spread across the
facade, and red and orange lights illuminated the sphinxes
that flanked the Mausoleum. In the cool
night air, students huddled and y y
danced to the sounds of DJ \A V / . /

dreds of Stanford students donned their costumes last Fri
day to celebrate Halloween at this year's Mausoleum
Party. Through the years, the event has grown to be a Stan
ford tradition our unique spin on Halloween where
students gather in a remote area on campus to partake in a
festive night full of outrageous costumes, dancing and
music. But how did the party become a campus tradition?
The mausoleum was constructed in 1889 as a burial
ground for Leland Stanford and his family. For many years,
the mausoleum was solely a place of prayer and remem
brance. In the early to mid '7os, students began to hold par
ties near the mausoleum around Halloween, and by the
late 'Bos, the party became the campus-wide event that it is
today. Aside from a brief hiatus due to budget cuts from
2002 to 2005, Mausoleum Party has remained a Stanford
Halloween staple, organized by the junior class cabinet.
The junior class worked to en
% sure that the event ran smoothly,
i / I J from lighting and music to decora
\J U tions and refreshments.
T T W One of the more notable at
v \ J _ tractions was a flipbook station,
F f a pl ace where students could as-
I a sem ble their own booklet of pictures

to capture snapshots from the night.
"The highlight for me was the flipbook station," said Sa
guna Goel 'l5. "Our dorm had a really good time taking
pictures with each other, and the flipbook will help me re
member all of the fun I had at Mausoleum for years to
come."
In addition to those individuals who hammed it up in
front of the camera, most students had an enjoyable time at
the mausoleum reveling at other people's costumes.
"I had a lot of fun looking at other people's costumes,"
said Mary Chambers 'l5.
"Halloween weekend is one of my favorite weekends at
Stanford," said Beckie Yanovsky 'l3, a junior class presi
dent. "Students' ingenuity and creativity really come out in
their costume ideas. I've personally seen some of the most
ingenious costumes on campus my last two years."
Whether you were a witch or a wizard, a mouse or a
Teletubby or even dressed as nothing special at all, the con
sensus was that Mausoleum 2011
was a night to remember. *
