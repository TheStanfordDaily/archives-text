## Musical logician 
### STEPHANIE WANG 
Artists across disciplines often
claim that the inspiration to
create works simply struck
them, as suddenly and power
fully as a bolt of lightening.
Giancarlo Aquilanti D.M.A. '96 is
one artist who begs to differ. In fact, he
insists that one must work hard at his or
her craft to receive any measure of cre
ative success.
Aquilanti, a faculty member of 20
years in Stanford's Department of
Music, has the experience to comment
on the nature of musical inspiration. In
addition to being a fixture in the Stan
ford music scene as the conductor of the
Stanford Wind Ensemble, Aquilanti has
decades of experience in performing and
conducting music across the globe.
Aquilanti, who was born in Italy, became
interested in music at a very early age.
"Music is the only thing I can remem
ber," he said. "It goes back to when I was
a child . . . that's the only thing I always
wanted to do, and this is what I'm doing."
Aquilanti entered the Conservatory
of Music in Pesaro, Italy at the age of 15
and was classically trained in piano,
trumpet and composition. After com

pleting his studies there, he moved to the
United States and received a master's
degree in composition cum laude from
the California State University East Bay.
In 1996, Aquilanti received his Ph.D. in
composition from Stanford, where he is
now a senior lecturer in music theory
and composition.
According to Aquilanti, there is a sur
prisingly large amount of hard work and
logic behind creating music, despite the
popular belief that the arts are produced
through emotion and creativity.
"There is the misconception that the
arts are up in the air," Aquilanti said.
"Creativity needs to have a foundation,
a very logical one. If you don't have that
foundation, creativity on its own does
nothing. Sure there are examples of the
naive painter, but those are exceptions.
Most of us come from a very hard
trained system."
Aquilanti's own music, in away, pro
vides no exception to his belief in strong
compositional foundations. He adapts
traditional music to modern forms, mod
ifying it to fit his needs as a composer.
His musical range is diverse; his compo
sitions include music for orchestra,
string quartets, choirs and solo musi
cians.

As the director of the Stanford Wind
Ensemble, Aquilanti must use both logic
and adaptability to best harness the tal
ents of his students.
He suggested that the challenge with
conducting the Wind Ensemble is that
the majority of its members are not
music majors. He stressed that there
must be a level of commitment for the
ensemble to perform well, often at the
same level as professional musical
groups.
"There has to be some commitment.
.. so that there's no shame to take them
outside the Stanford wall and around the
world," Aquilanti said.
"[Aquilanti] treats us with a large
amount of equality and keeps classes
fun," said Lauren Sweet 'l4, a student
participating in the Wind Ensemble this
quarter. "He's very into the music and
very expressive. It helps the ensemble
play better, because we mirror the [in
tensity] that he sets out on the podium."
Aquilanti asserts that this "intensity"
stems from his commitment to his craft
as well as the efforts from his students
and colleagues at Stanford.
