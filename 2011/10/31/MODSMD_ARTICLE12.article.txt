## EDITORIAL The 						value of a liberal education 
### 
Students' anticipation of the
opening of winter quarter en
rollment this past weekend
undoubtedly prompted some stu
dents to express frustration over
Stanford's General Education Re
quirements (GERs). The non-
Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) students are required to
take three IHUM courses, two
PWR classes and classes that cover
five Disciplinary Breadth areas
(Humanities, Social Sciences,
Mathematics, Natural Sciences
and Applied Sciences and Engi
neering) and two of four Educa
tion for Citizenship requirements.
In practice, this amounts to around
eight to 10 courses outside of one's
major (the Foreign Language re
quirement, not technically a GER,
requires up to three additional
classes).
Although the GERs fall under
criticism, the theory underlying
their existence that values a lib
eral education, or an education in
volving study in all the major sub
fields is sound. Although a lib
eral education might once have
been valued for the purpose of ed
ucating the future elite in upper
class social norms, such as an un
derstanding of Greek, in the 21st
Century, a more practical justifica
tion is in order. There are at least
two such justifications. One is that,
in exposing all students to a wide
range of fields, requiring a liberal
education can help students find
new intellectual passions. Given
that many Stanford students ulti
mately major in something com
pletely different from what they
originally intended, this benefit
cannot be ignored. However, we
must also justify the liberal educa
tion for those students who are
completely certain of their major
and future career. A common
question asked by critiques of a
liberal education goes something
like this: why should an English
major, dead set on writing for a liv
ing, need to take classes in math,
science and engineering?
But the fact that college educa
tion is becoming increasingly spe
cialized further warrants liberal ed
ucation requirements. We are en
tering a workforce and society
where having knowledge in just
one field will not suffice. The Na
tional Academy of Engineering, for
instance, recognizes the importance
of a liberal education. In its 2004 re
port on the "Engineer of 2020," the
NAE stated that "learning discipli
nary technical subjects to the exclu
sion of a selection of humanities,
economics, political science, lan
guage and/or interdisciplinary tech
nical subjects is not in the best inter
est of producing engineers able to
communicate with the public, able
to engage in a global engineering
marketplace, or trained to be life
long learners." And in an increas
ingly technology-dependent world,
it is important that those majoring
in the humanities and social sci
ences have college-level exposure
to math, science and engineering if
their major does not already re
quire it.

ferings across many disciplines at
Stanford, the Study on Under
graduate Education at Stanford
found that students often fall
under the misguided impression
that their major represents the en
tirety of their relevant college edu
cation. High unit counts in certain
majors are likely somewhat re
sponsible for this trend, although
also at play is the fact that some
students may not take GERs seri
ously. In its extreme form, some
students see little to no value in
being required to take classes out
side their primary discipline.This is
a particularly shortsighted belief;
the concept of a liberal education,
for instance, is widely endorsed
among Stanford faculty and in the
professional world.
These students, however, are
not entirely to blame for negative
perspectives on the GER system;
the current requirements have
some serious flaws.Though well in
tentioned, the IHUM requirement
engrains many freshmen with a be
lief that future GERs are to be re
sented, not welcomed. Further
more, for those who want an easy
way out of the requirements,
Course√üank makes it simple to
find the approximately 7 percent
of Disciplinary Breadth classes
that reportedly have fewer than
five hours of work per week. Al
though it is impossible to expect all
students to challenge themselves
in fulfilling GERs, a University
that values its requirements
should not aid students who want
to shirk them. Accordingly, classes
that fulfill GER requirements
should have to pass a certain rigor.
They should also have to be rele
vant to Stanford's mission in pro
viding a practical liberal educa
tion. As it stands, the application of
which classes fulfill the breadth re
quirement and which do not is in
coherent. It is hard to understand
why History 257 C (LGBT History
in the United States) cannot fulfill
one of the five breadth GERs
while Music 21 (Elements of
Music I) can fulfill the Humanities
requirement. And, if the Universi
ty wants it students to appreciate
the value of its requirements, pro
fessors in GER-fulfilling classes
should be required to explain why
their class is relevant to non-ma
jors.

These are just some of the first
steps the University needs to take
if it wants every student to view the
GERs as a fundamental piece of
his or her Stanford education.
However, some of the onus is on
students as well. It is easy to com
plain about GERs given high
workloads, but that fact should not
prevent us from embracing the no
tion of a liberal education. It is easy
to complain about being forced to
take classes outside a field of inter
est, but let us remember that some
times requirements are there for
our own benefit. Yes, there are le
gitimate problems with the GER
system. But let us not allow the
University to confuse these criti
cisms with those of students who
simply do not value a liberal edu
cation.
