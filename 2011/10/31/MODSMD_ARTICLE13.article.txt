Engaging in
contemporary art

Dear Editor,
David Spencer Nelson's column
on why contemporary art turns him
off is a bracing and personal call to
all of us in arts practice and arts ed
ucation (The Mixed Messages of
Modernism: Empty museums: an
explanation, Oct. 28). Let's rise to
the challenges he articulates.
I hope that we can transform his
museum-going experiences, and
there are good reasons to think
there are possibilities unfolding
right here on the Stanford campus.
The Cantor Arts Center is the locus
of a truly dynamic curatorial view
which seeks to enliven and enlarge
the experience of the art in its
gallery spaces and grounds. If Nel
son gives art another chance, this is
what he might find there these days:
Acclaimed dancer Muriel Maffre is
leading an investigation of Dance &
the Visual Arts in the heart of the

Cantor Art Center's auditorium.
In conjunction with the Cantor's
"Rodin in America" exhibit, Maf
fre uses Rodin's sculptural investi
gation of the moving body as both a
link and a platform for exploring
the intersection of dance and con
temporary art, starting with
Rodin's fascination with the
human body, its plastic quality and
human resonances. She brings in
ternationally known Master
Choreographer Alonzo King of
LINES Ballet to the Cantor to hold
Open Rehearsals with Stanford
dancers, in full view of museumgo
ers. Nelson can circulate around the
edges of the auditorium space, pass
through quickly, or stay a while to
watch, draw and write as the re
hearsals unfold. If intrigued, he can
come often, on the remaining
Thursday nights, 6-8 p.m. Nov. 3,
Nov. 10 and Dec, 1. The interdisci
plinary investigation that Maffre,
King and student dancers are un
dertaking will culminate in an in
stallation/performance on Satur

day Dec. 3,2-4 p.m. in Roble Studio
38, free and open to the public.
Big picture, my hope is that stu
dents like Nelson will be drawn into
art experiences by such interdisci
plinary work work generated by
peers as well as work by masters,
work that resonates across forms,
work that shows a through-line be
tween older traditions and newer in
vestigations. Art should refresh our
senses such that we may perceive
the world differently for having ex
perienced it. Engagement, not es
cape, is the goal. I would be happy to
introduce Nelson and any other
Stanford student to these extraordi
nary professional and student artists
personally if it will jump-start their
museum-going habit again. Just
meet me at the Cantor Arts Center
auditorium this Thursday at 6 p.m.
Wear something red. I hope we have
a date.

Department of Drama
