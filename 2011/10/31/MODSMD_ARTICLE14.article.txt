## STUDENT LIFE ASSU offers subsidies for dorm USC trips despite University resistance 
### ILEANA NAJARRO 
The ASSU has offered to subsi
dize residence-financed trips to Sat
urday's football game at the Univer
sity of Southern California (USC)
last weekend. Students' whose trips,
which were individually organized,
or not officially financed by resi
dences, are not eligible for ASSU
sponsorship.
ASSU Senator Ben Laufer 'l2
wrote in an email to The Daily that
the ASSU's final decision not to di
rectly sponsor the game came about
after much deliberation with Nanci
Howe, director of Student Activities
and Leadership.
"We were told in an email that
'neither the University nor ASSU
should promote this trip as it implies
a level of endorsement that the Uni
versity is unwilling to make. You
should not use ASSU or the Univer
sity email lists to promote this trip,"'
Laufer told The Daily.
Laufer said that even when the
package program Fan Travel offered
to promote itself on behalf of the
University and ASSU without
any liability to the University or
ASSU the University turned
down the offer, leaving Fan Travel to
promote its packages on Facebook.
Fan Travel offered students a
range of packages including round
trip transportation, food, game tick
ets and accommodations.
Laufer said before the game that
the lack of University-sponsored

travel packages like those offered
by Fan Travel would negatively af
fect student attendance.
"I think a mass Fan Travel cara
van would have been spectacular,"
Laufer said. "Certainly the Univer
sity's decision has had a negative
impact on the total number of stu
dents going to the game because it
made it difficult for Fan Travel to ad
vertise to the student body."
According to Laufer, the Under

graduate Senate ultimately con
tributed $2,000 to sponsor tickets.
ASSU Vice President Stewart Mac
gregor-Dennis 'l3 confirmed to The
Daily that ASSU President Michael
Cruz 'l2 also gave $5OO from his
stipend toward subsidizing dorms
and other residences that individu
ally organized trips. The ASSU will
be offering a $lO rebate to the first
250 students with proof of purchase
of a ticket to the game, Laufer said.
Elijah Frazier 'l2, a residence as
sistant (RA) for Suites, collaborated
with staff from Mirrielees to subsi
dize transportation to and from the
game, the game ticket price and
hotel accommodations for the two
residences. Residents paid $3O and
non-residents paid $5O.

Frazier, who also serves on the
ASSU Community Board, said that
leaving coordination to residences
helped foster a greater sense of
dorm community. He added that it
provided residences the opportuni
ty to lower individual students'
costs.

Marcus Jamison 'l2, a
Crothers RA, said that while Uni

I think a mass
Fan Travel caravan
would have been
spectacular.
