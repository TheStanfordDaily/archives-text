## Biannual Splash! program attracts 1,500 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
Stanford's biannual Splash!
Program attracted more than 1,500
middle and high schoolers to cam
pus this weekend to attend a range
of about 300 Stanford student
taught classes, from "The Philoso
phy of Star Wars" to "How to Curl
Your Hair with a Straightener" to
even "Getting Free Money from
Safeway Using Coupons."
Although the majority of stu
dents come from the Bay Area, this
time around the program attracted
some from Southern California
and even Utah.
Instructors, meanwhile, are in
high demand. Splash! actively re
cruits undergraduates and gradu
ate students to "teach anything."
New classes this autumn included
"How to Make Balloon Animals"
and "The Lab Manual of Sherlock
Holmes."
"Splash! is a growing program,
but the main limiting factor is the
number of teachers that we have,"
said Benjamin Shank, a graduate
student in physics and one of
Splash!'s co-founders. "Splash!'s
enrollment is about the same as last
spring's. More students want to
take classes with every coming
Splash!, but the real pressure is in
recruiting more Stanford students
to teach classes. We need the peo
ple to make it happen."
Stanford students who did teach
were enthusiastic about their posi
tions.
"I love to teach and love the
challenge of trying to transmit an
idea what I'm seeing in my head
into someone's mind," said Gabriel
Erhlich 'l5, who taught "The
Physics of'lnception.'"
"Just because we have a bunch

of graduate students teaching does
n't mean it's all educational," said
Teresa Nguyen 'l4, the current
president of Splash!, who is teach
ing a class on sketching faces.
"There are a lot of hobby classes,
and they all express the passion in
the program."
Splash! is a general fees club, so
funding comes from the Graduate
Student Council and the Under
graduate Senate. Students general
ly pay $2O for a day of instruction,
but financial aid and transportation
are made available to some stu
dents.
Those attending the classes
cited Stanford's quality one of
Splash!'s primary appeals.
"I wanted to take classes that are
interesting to me," said Monique
Robinson, a senior from the Stan
ford New Schools East Palo Alto
High School, who was attending a
class on stem cells and research de
velopments.
Splash! has a high teacher and
student retention rate, with many
teachers coming back to teach the
same courses at the next Splash! or
to try teaching a completely new
subject.
"The main reason is because
teachers love doing it so much,"
Shank said.
David Jiang, a student at James
Logan High School, attended
Splash! for a second time.
"Here, I can learn about some
thing that is outside of my main in
terests, so I can get a taste of them,"
he said.
Splash also reaches out to under
served schools and areas. The pro
gram hopes to help students gain an
even greater desire to learn, and
many local high school advisors pro
mote the Splash! program.

Event organizers recalled teach
ers receiving emails from students
that attended their classes weeks
later, expressing the appreciation
and gratitude for inspiring them
and making them want to learn

more. A few even mentioned the
students' re-consideration of going
to college.
"It's a win-win situation,"
Nguyen said. "The students are
learning, and the teachers are re

warded, because the students that
come are here because they want to
be here."
