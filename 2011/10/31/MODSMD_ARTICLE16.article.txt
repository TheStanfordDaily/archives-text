## REVENGE SPLIT 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN 
Riding an eight-match winning
streak, the No. 5 Stanford women's
volleyball team headed home this
weekend for rematches with two of
the three teams that defeated the
Cardinal earlier this season. Stan
ford had mixed success, sweeping
No. 4 USC before being swept by
No. 6 UCLA.
The last time Stanford (17-4,11-
4 Pac-12) faced USC (18-4, 13-2),
the Cardinal was utterly outclassed,
failing to win a set for the only time
this year. Friday's match, however,
was another story. The Trojans left
Maples Pavilion with a straight-set
loss, and the Cardinal's winning
streak improved to nine.

The first set was a true back-and
forth affair, but the Cardinal de
fense was able to keep the potent
USC offense in check. Stanford
recorded six blocks in the first set
alone and finished with 13 overall.
On offense, junior outside hitter
Hayley Spelman led the way,
recording a team-high four kills to
go with two blocks.
The second set became the
Rachel Williams show, as the sopho
more superstar led the way with six
kills and seven digs as Stanford
cruised to a 25-14 victory. She would
finish with 14 kills and 13 digs for
her 12th double-double of the sea
son.
Following the 10-minute break,
however, Cardinal dominance did
not seem quite so secure. Led by
senior Alex Jupiter, who tallied six
kills in the set and a match-high 16
overall, USC jumped to an early
lead. Down 17-12, Stanford prompt
ly killed the USC rally with a furi
ous comeback. Junior setter Karissa
Cook led the charge as usual, with
15 assists and six digs in the last set
alone she had 41 and 12, respec
tively, for the match as well as
the game-winning block as the Car
dinal completed the straight-set vic
tory, 25-23.
Ultimately, the story of the
match was the ferocity of the Cardi
nal defense and the efficiency of the
offense. The Trojans entered with
the highest hitting percentage in the
Pac-12 (.284), but they were held to
just a .161 clip for the game. Stan

ford, however, hit .339 overall, led
by sophomore middle blocker
Carly Wopat's season-high .611
with 11 kills on 18 attempts.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
UCLA had just as much momen
tum coming into its Saturday show
down, as the Bruins had dismantled
No. 2 California the night before in
Berkeley. UCLA (20-3, 13-2) had
won its previous meeting with the
Cardinal and hoped to complete a
season sweep for the first time in 11
years.

Right off the bat, Stanford ap
peared to be in trouble, falling into a
12-7 hole. The Cardinal regrouped,
roaring back to hold a 24-21 advan
tage. However, despite holding
three set points, Stanford was un
able to close out the Bruins, and
UCLA rode three Cardinal errors
to a 26-24 first-set victory.

The second set was another close
affair. Stanford managed to take a
24-22 lead, but again wasted three
set points and fell 27-25. Williams
anchored the team with five kills in
the set. She would finish with 11
kills and 12 digs for her 13th double
double.

The third set, on the other hand,
was all UCLA. The Bruins held
Stanford to just a .056 hitting per
centage while hitting .448 them
selves to take a 25-10 victory in the
set. With that, the Bruins were able
to complete their season sweep of
the Cardinal and hand Stanford its
first home loss of the season.
The UCLA match was a stark
contrast to Stanford's hitting
prowess just 24 hours before. The
Cardinal committed 39 errors and
recorded its third-lowest hitting
percentage of the season, .140. Part
of this can be attributed to the
tremendous defense of the Bruins,
who made a number of unbeliev
able saves and recorded 57 digs,
compared with a well-below-aver
age 44 for the Cardinal.
Overall, it was a wild weekend
for Pac-12 women's volleyball. With
two wins, the Bruins moved up to a
tie for first place with USC. Cal lost
twice to fall back to a tie for third
with Stanford, which managed to
move up a spot in the standings de
spite Saturday's loss.
Next week, Stanford looks to
bounce back as it travels to face
Pac-12 newcomers Colorado and
Utah.

senior Alex Jupiter, who tallied six
kills in the set and a match-high 16
overall, USC jumped to an early
lead. Down 17-12, Stanford prompt
ly killed the USC rally with a furi
ous comeback. Junior setter Karissa
Cook led the charge as usual, with
15 assists and six digs in the last set
alone she had 41 and 12, respec
tively, for the match as well as
the game-winning block as the Car
dinal completed the straight-set vic
tory, 25-23.
Ultimately, the story of the
match was the ferocity of the Cardi
nal defense and the efficiency of the
offense. The Trojans entered with
the highest hitting percentage in the
Pac-12 (.284), but they were held to
just a .161 clip for the game. Stan

ford, however, hit .339 overall, led
by sophomore middle blocker
Carly Wopat's season-high .611
with 11 kills on 18 attempts.
Unfortunately for Stanford,
UCLA had just as much momen
tum coming into its Saturday show
down, as the Bruins had dismantled
No. 2 California the night before in
Berkeley. UCLA (20-3, 13-2) had
won its previous meeting with the
Cardinal and hoped to complete a
season sweep for the first time in 11
years.

Right off the bat, Stanford ap
peared to be in trouble, falling into a
12-7 hole. The Cardinal regrouped,
roaring back to hold a 24-21 advan
tage. However, despite holding
three set points, Stanford was un
able to close out the Bruins, and
UCLA rode three Cardinal errors
to a 26-24 first-set victory.

The second set was another close
affair. Stanford managed to take a
24-22 lead, but again wasted three
set points and fell 27-25. Williams
anchored the team with five kills in
the set. She would finish with 11
kills and 12 digs for her 13th double
double.

The third set, on the other hand,
was all UCLA. The Bruins held
Stanford to just a .056 hitting per
centage while hitting .448 them
selves to take a 25-10 victory in the
set. With that, the Bruins were able
to complete their season sweep of
the Cardinal and hand Stanford its
first home loss of the season.
The UCLA match was a stark
contrast to Stanford's hitting
prowess just 24 hours before. The
Cardinal committed 39 errors and
recorded its third-lowest hitting
percentage of the season, .140. Part
of this can be attributed to the
tremendous defense of the Bruins,
who made a number of unbeliev
able saves and recorded 57 digs,
compared with a well-below-aver
age 44 for the Cardinal.
Overall, it was a wild weekend
for Pac-12 women's volleyball. With
two wins, the Bruins moved up to a
tie for first place with USC. Cal lost
twice to fall back to a tie for third
with Stanford, which managed to
move up a spot in the standings de
spite Saturday's loss.
Next week, Stanford looks to
bounce back as it travels to face
Pac-12 newcomers Colorado and
Utah.
