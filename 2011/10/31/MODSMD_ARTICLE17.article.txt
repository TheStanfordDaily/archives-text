# CROSS COUNTRY
## Men, women edged by Buffs in Pac-12s 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
When senior All-Americans Chris Derrick
and Jake Riley crossed the finish line at the first
ever Pac-12 Cross Country Championships in
second and fourth place, respectively, it ap
peared as though the men's cross country team
was in control of the first-ever Pac-12 title in any
sport on Saturday (the women's soccer team has
clinched the conference title but not officially
won it).

When redshirt senior Brendan Gregg and
sophomore Erik Olson came through in 10th
and 12th places both ahead of Colorado's
fourth-place runner the course announcer
noted that it looked like No. 4 Stanford had all
but sealed up its third-straight conference title.
But you need five scores to count, and as run
ner after runner came by, the Cardinal was
nowhere to be found. Freshman Joe Rosa finally
crossed the line in 25th place to complete Stan
ford's scoring, but it was too little, too late. In a

Blocking was a key factor in the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team's
early success this weekend. The Cardinal notched six blocks in the first set of
a sweep of No. 4 USC, but Stanford then fell in straight sets to No. 6 UCLA.
finish that was even tighter on the
course than it was on paper, the
Buffaloes took the men's team title
with 46 points, seven better than
Stanford's total of 53.

The women's race, held just min
utes later, was almost as close as the
men's, and once again, the Cardinal
came up just short. No. 16 Colorado
put on its best showing of the year
and surprised a loaded field, slip
ping past No. 2 Washington by 23
points while Stanford finished in
third place, 25 points off the pace.
Junior Kathy Kroeger contin
ued to build on her success this sea
son with a second-place finish, cov
ering the 6-kilometer course in
19:40 and knocking off heavy pre
race favorite Jordan Hasay of Ore
gon, who finished third.
And similar to the men's race,
the Cardinal was right in the thick
of things after the first few runners.
Redshirt senior Stephanie Marcy
placed seventh in her final confer
ence meet, and sophomore Jessica
Tonn placed 11th with some sup
port from fans in her hometown of
Phoenix.

That put Stanford one point be
hind Colorado's top three runners,
and freshman Aisling Cuffe was
closing hard for the fourth spot that
would have put the pressure on the
Buffs to respond. But Cuffe pulled
up in the final straightaway and
might have lost seven or eight spots
including four to Washington
and Colorado runners strug
gling the final 30 yards to finish
24th.

From there, however, the gap to
Stanford's fifth runner was too
large, and although redshirt junior
Claire Durkin capped the scoring
with her 31st-place finish an im
pressive Stanford debut for the
2007 Gatorade Cross Country Ath
lete of the Year from Ohio who
chose not to run in her first three
years on the Farm and returned to
the Cardinal distance program this
fall the damage was done.

Head coach PattiSue Plumer
was pleased with the effort, despite
the end result.

"It was a really good race, partic
ularly up front," she told GoStan
ford.com. "We were so close to sec
ond, but I guess we just edged
Washington last year, so they re
turned the favor this year. It was
Colorado's day though; they ran
great today."
The Buffaloes record-setting
day left a bad taste in the mouths of
Stanford's runners, particularly on
the men's side.

Derrick, who went out with the
lead pack at a blistering pace, near
ly chased down Arizona's freshman
sensation Lawi Lalang over the
final kilometer of the race, and his
time of 22:45 is one of the top times
in the country this year. But the 10-
time All-American was disappoint
ed that the team couldn't seal the
deal down the stretch.
"It kind of sucks to not win as a
team," he said after the race, "It
looked like it was okay, it was going
to be close. [After the finish], I went
over to the Arizona State televi
sion, and when I came back over I
saw everyone with their heads
down, and I figured the worst had
happened."
One thing that really hurt the
Cardinal was the loss of Ben John
son during the race. The senior had
consistently been running as Stan
ford's No. 3, but he failed to finish
the race in hot conditions at the
Wigwam Golf Course, and in his
absence, none of the other team
members could quite close the gap.

Redshirt senior JT Sullivan fin
ished 29th, junior Miles Unterrein
er was 32nd and Riley Sullivan was
52nd, while Andrew Berberick also
did not complete the course.
"[The loss] has to be more moti
vating," Derrick said. "I don't think
it affects how badly we want to win
a national title, but maybe it affects
how we approach things."
Both Stanford teams will get an
other shot at redemption at the
NCAA West Regionals in two
weeks, where they could have a
home-course advantage with the
race to be held at the Stanford Golf
Course on Saturday, Nov. 12. The
NCAA Championships are loom
ing, as they are scheduled for Nov.
21 in Terre Haute, Ind.

"It was a really good race, partic
ularly up front," she told GoStan
ford.com. "We were so close to sec
ond, but I guess we just edged
Washington last year, so they re
turned the favor this year. It was
Colorado's day though; they ran
great today."
The Buffaloes record-setting
day left a bad taste in the mouths of
Stanford's runners, particularly on
the men's side.

Derrick, who went out with the
lead pack at a blistering pace, near
ly chased down Arizona's freshman
sensation Lawi Lalang over the
final kilometer of the race, and his
time of 22:45 is one of the top times
in the country this year. But the 10-
time All-American was disappoint
ed that the team couldn't seal the
deal down the stretch.
"It kind of sucks to not win as a
team," he said after the race, "It
looked like it was okay, it was going
to be close. [After the finish], I went
over to the Arizona State televi
sion, and when I came back over I
saw everyone with their heads
down, and I figured the worst had
happened."
One thing that really hurt the
Cardinal was the loss of Ben John
son during the race. The senior had
consistently been running as Stan
ford's No. 3, but he failed to finish
the race in hot conditions at the
Wigwam Golf Course, and in his
absence, none of the other team
members could quite close the gap.

Redshirt senior JT Sullivan fin
ished 29th, junior Miles Unterrein
er was 32nd and Riley Sullivan was
52nd, while Andrew Berberick also
did not complete the course.
"[The loss] has to be more moti
vating," Derrick said. "I don't think
it affects how badly we want to win
a national title, but maybe it affects
how we approach things."
Both Stanford teams will get an
other shot at redemption at the
NCAA West Regionals in two
weeks, where they could have a
home-course advantage with the
race to be held at the Stanford Golf
Course on Saturday, Nov. 12. The
NCAA Championships are loom
ing, as they are scheduled for Nov.
21 in Terre Haute, Ind.

When senior All-Americans Chris Derrick
and Jake Riley crossed the finish line at the first
ever Pac-12 Cross Country Championships in
second and fourth place, respectively, it ap
peared as though the men's cross country team
was in control of the first-ever Pac-12 title in any
sport on Saturday (the women's soccer team has
clinched the conference title but not officially
won it).

When redshirt senior Brendan Gregg and
sophomore Erik Olson came through in 10th
and 12th places both ahead of Colorado's
fourth-place runner the course announcer
noted that it looked like No. 4 Stanford had all
but sealed up its third-straight conference title.
But you need five scores to count, and as run
ner after runner came by, the Cardinal was
nowhere to be found. Freshman Joe Rosa finally
crossed the line in 25th place to complete Stan
ford's scoring, but it was too little, too late. In a


NICK SALAZAR/The Stanford Daily
Blocking was a key factor in the No. 5 Stanford women's volleyball team's
early success this weekend. The Cardinal notched six blocks in the first set of
a sweep of No. 4 USC, but Stanford then fell in straight sets to No. 6 UCLA.
finish that was even tighter on the
course than it was on paper, the
Buffaloes took the men's team title
with 46 points, seven better than
Stanford's total of 53.

The women's race, held just min
utes later, was almost as close as the
men's, and once again, the Cardinal
came up just short. No. 16 Colorado
put on its best showing of the year
and surprised a loaded field, slip
ping past No. 2 Washington by 23
points while Stanford finished in
third place, 25 points off the pace.
Junior Kathy Kroeger contin
ued to build on her success this sea
son with a second-place finish, cov
ering the 6-kilometer course in
19:40 and knocking off heavy pre
race favorite Jordan Hasay of Ore
gon, who finished third.
And similar to the men's race,
the Cardinal was right in the thick
of things after the first few runners.
Redshirt senior Stephanie Marcy
placed seventh in her final confer
ence meet, and sophomore Jessica
Tonn placed 11th with some sup
port from fans in her hometown of
Phoenix.

That put Stanford one point be
hind Colorado's top three runners,
and freshman Aisling Cuffe was
closing hard for the fourth spot that
would have put the pressure on the
Buffs to respond. But Cuffe pulled
up in the final straightaway and
might have lost seven or eight spots
including four to Washington
and Colorado runners strug
gling the final 30 yards to finish
24th.

From there, however, the gap to
Stanford's fifth runner was too
large, and although redshirt junior
Claire Durkin capped the scoring
with her 31st-place finish an im
pressive Stanford debut for the
2007 Gatorade Cross Country Ath
lete of the Year from Ohio who
chose not to run in her first three
years on the Farm and returned to
the Cardinal distance program this
fall the damage was done.

Head coach PattiSue Plumer
was pleased with the effort, despite
the end result.

"It was a really good race, partic
ularly up front," she told GoStan
ford.com. "We were so close to sec
