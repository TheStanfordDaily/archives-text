# USC game transcends statistics
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Saturday marked the zeroth
anniversary of one of the
most thrilling and memo
rable games in Stanford
football history. Stat on the
Back looks at how it all went down at
the Coliseum.
Number of the game: 0, as in the
number of statistics that can accurate
ly describe the madness that was Stan
ford vs. USC.
Let's be clear: I love stats. I mean,
really, I have an unhealthy obsession
with everything from third-down con
version rate to punt-return defense.
Every time I watch a game, I find
every random stat I can, and I have yet
to meet a person that cares half as
much about the stats I babble as I do.
That said, this game was less about
stats than any game I have ever seen.
This game was about intangibles and
grit, momentum and fight, hostile en
vironment and motivation and every
other term I usually ignore. In most
games, a play-by-play and box score
can tell you everything you need to
know, but in this one, you had to be
there. You had to be a part of that at
mosphere, and you had to see the
drama unfold to understand just what
took place.
Let's be clear on one thing: the fact
that Stanford very narrowly beat a
USC team that has somehow flown
under the radar should not diminish
anyone's view of the Cardinal.
For one thing, USC is a high-cal
iber team with NFL talent overflow
ing on both sides of the ball. There
could be three top-10 picks on the of
fense alone, as quarterback Matt
Barkley and left tackle Matt Kalil are
projected to enter the draft this year,
and wide receiver Robert Woods will
be among the nation's best prospects
when he is eligible.
Just as importantly, USC had as
much intangible benefit as I could
imagine in this game. While I usually
downplay the importance of things
like "motivation" (doesn't everyone
want to win every game?), I changed
my tune after seeing the Trojans. The
local radio before the game was abuzz
with the most anticipation fans had
had for any game in years. People
have talked about USC having noth
ing to play for, because the Trojans
cannot make the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game or a bowl game due to
NCAA sanctions.
Immediately upon entering the
Coliseum parking lot, it became ap
parent that this game really was
"USC's Super Bowl." ESPN's College
Game Day brought an even greater
media presence than usual to USC
football, throngs of fans filled the Col
iseum and the players were as riled up
as any team I've seen for a regular
season matchup.
After taking a second-half lead,
the Trojans did their best Georgia im
pression, acting as though each and
every player had just won the lottery
at the exact same time. With over 25

minutes to go in regulation, USC
players were jumping on benches,
huddling up and screaming along
with their tens of thousands of fans.

Call it what you will, but there was
little doubt that the Trojans were play
ing at their peak effort level all game
long. USC, with or without sanctions,
usually has the best talent on the field
no matter what team it plays, but the
issue can sometimes be effort. There
was no lack of energy from USC from
the first snap to the last, and that makes
USC nearly impossible to beat, espe
cially with the home crowd providing
such support. Add in huge momentum
boosts for the Trojans chief among
them being the pick-six by Nickel!
Robey in the waning minutes and it
would take a miraculous effort by the
Cardinal to pull out the victory.
And that's just what happened.
Now, don't get me wrong. Stanford
was far from perfect very far.
Penalties, bad play-calling, poor
throws, dropped passes, bad block
ing, missed tackles, bad special teams
play ... to say there was room for
improvement is an understatement.
But as the saying goes, big-time play
ers make big-time plays, and that's
just what the Cardinal did.
Looking forward, many people
question how Stanford can compete
with an even better opponent (Ore
gon) when the Cardinal struggled so
mightily with USC. The notion of a
transitive property for those of
you far removed from math class,
that is the idea that Oregon is way
better than USC and USC almost
beat Stanford so Oregon should
beat Stanford does not hold true
in the sports world.
Oregon is a very different team
with very different matchup prob
lems from the ones offered by USC.
The game will be played in a much
different atmosphere (Stanford Sta
dium) with different personnel
(such as Delano Howell, hopefully)
on a different week (12 days away
and counting). Previous results give
you an idea of what a team will do,
but they don't tell the whole story.
Sometimes there's more to a game
than the numbers.

Of course, numbers can still say a
whole lot, and this is Stat on the
Back, so let's take a look at the num
bers that mattered:

-6,4: Coming into the game, Stan
ford had not trailed a single time all

season and had not been tied at any
point after the first score. In this
game, there were six lead changes
and four ties, half of which came in
the overtimes. To say Stanford was
finally challenged is putting it
lightly.
11, 91: Known as a disciplined
team, the Cardinal was anything
but against the Trojans and their
crowd. Stanford committed 11
penalties for 91 yards after averag
ing roughly half those totals (five
penalties for 45 yards) the rest of
the season. Some penalties, such as
a pass interference call against
Robert Woods, were somewhat jus
tified. Others, like a pair of delay
of-game calls on Luck, a too-many
men-in-the huddle call and two off
sides penalties on nose tackle Ter
rence Stephens, were much sloppi
er. In a close game, these penalties
almost cost Stanford its undefeated
season.
145, 2: USC running back Curtis
McNeal looked like LaMichael
James as he gashed Stanford's pre
viously stout rush defense for 145
yards and two touchdowns, both ca
reer highs. McNeal came in as the
second-best running back on a
pass-centered offense, but when
Marc Tyler went down to injury,
McNeal stepped up in a big way (at
least until the final play of the
game). The Cardinal defense is still
ranked sixth in the country in rush
ing yards allowed, but the past few
weeks have exposed some glaring
weaknesses against the run.
2, 0: Many people thought this
game would come down to line
play, and Stanford had arguably the
nation's best lines on paper before
the game. Despite allowing just two
sacks all season, the Cardinal offen
sive line let USC double that total
with a pair of sacks of Luck among
several QB hurries. Meanwhile, the
much-praised Stanford pass rush
hardly got to Matt Barkley at all and
failed to record a sack. In fact, the
Cardinal registered just four tackles
for loss, only half its season average.
17: It was a good day for players
wearing No. 17. Linebacker AJ.
Tarpley starting in place of the in
jured Shayne Skov picked off
Barkley in the first half and later
forced a fumble. His biggest contri
bution of all, though, was falling on
McNeal's fumble in the end zone to
end the game.
The leading receiver in the game,
with 102 yards receiving, was ...
Griff Whalen? Yep, Luck's room
mate was his favorite target on big
third-down plays, and Whalen re

sponded with some great catches.
Meanwhile, Woods, possibly the best
receiver in the nation, finished with
89 receiving yards on nine catches
and didn't even lead his own team in
receiving. The Stanford defense had
many flaws, but it did hold Woods
down.

99: Stepfan Taylor was just a yard
away from notching his fifth 100-
yard rushing game in the past six
contests. Taylor carried the load for
Stanford, setting a season high with
23 carries, and his two touchdowns
were in the most crucial situations.
The first one tied the game with 38
seconds to play in regulation, and
the second one proved to be the
game-winner in triple overtime. Just
like nearly every other game, the
running game eventually overpow
ered the USC defense after a slow
start.

39: Thanks to Jordan Williamson
being a late scratch due to an undis
closed injury, Stanford had to rely on
its backup kicker, Eric Whitaker. He
responded by making all six of his
extra points and both his field goal
attempts, but kickoffs were another
story. Whitaker kicked off out of
bounds twice, and in all, half of
USC's 12 drives started at the Trojan
39 or better. That kind of field-posi
tion advantage is tough to over
come, and the Cardinal likely can't
afford a repeat of that performance.
93,607: The listed attendance of
93,607 means that the game was a
sellout, and I have no doubt that
there were at least 90,000 people in
attendance. Apart from the obvious
impact in terms of noise and mo
mentum, the sellout (the first at the
Coliseum since 2009) shows just
how important this game was to
USC.

3: The win was Stanford's third
straight in the Coliseum. The last
time the Cardinal won three straight
road games with USC? The 19305.
This really was a historic win.
16: It might have been the nar
rowest escape in years, but Stan
ford's winning streak is intact.

56-48: Just admire that score. It's
never going to get old.

Jacob Jaffe nearly fell off of his perch
atop the roof of the Los Angeles
Coliseum when Tarpley fell on the
loose ball in the end zone. Only di
vine intervention and Jaffe's tremen
dous core strength allowed him to
enjoy the Stanford victory in his own
bed and not a hospital. For more

Let's be clear: I love stats. I mean,
really, I have an unhealthy obsession
with everything from third-down con
version rate to punt-return defense.
Every time I watch a game, I find
every random stat I can, and I have yet
to meet a person that cares half as
much about the stats I babble as I do.
That said, this game was less about
stats than any game I have ever seen.
This game was about intangibles and
grit, momentum and fight, hostile en
vironment and motivation and every
other term I usually ignore. In most
games, a play-by-play and box score
can tell you everything you need to
know, but in this one, you had to be
there. You had to be a part of that at
mosphere, and you had to see the
drama unfold to understand just what
took place.
Let's be clear on one thing: the fact
that Stanford very narrowly beat a
USC team that has somehow flown
under the radar should not diminish
anyone's view of the Cardinal.
For one thing, USC is a high-cal
iber team with NFL talent overflow
ing on both sides of the ball. There
could be three top-10 picks on the of
fense alone, as quarterback Matt
Barkley and left tackle Matt Kalil are
projected to enter the draft this year,
and wide receiver Robert Woods will
be among the nation's best prospects
when he is eligible.
Just as importantly, USC had as
much intangible benefit as I could
imagine in this game. While I usually
downplay the importance of things
like "motivation" (doesn't everyone
want to win every game?), I changed
my tune after seeing the Trojans. The
local radio before the game was abuzz
with the most anticipation fans had
had for any game in years. People
have talked about USC having noth
ing to play for, because the Trojans
cannot make the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game or a bowl game due to
NCAA sanctions.
Immediately upon entering the
Coliseum parking lot, it became ap
parent that this game really was
"USC's Super Bowl." ESPN's College
Game Day brought an even greater
media presence than usual to USC
football, throngs of fans filled the Col
iseum and the players were as riled up
as any team I've seen for a regular
season matchup.
After taking a second-half lead,
the Trojans did their best Georgia im
pression, acting as though each and
every player had just won the lottery
at the exact same time. With over 25

minutes to go in regulation, USC
players were jumping on benches,
huddling up and screaming along
with their tens of thousands of fans.

Call it what you will, but there was
little doubt that the Trojans were play
ing at their peak effort level all game
long. USC, with or without sanctions,
usually has the best talent on the field
no matter what team it plays, but the
issue can sometimes be effort. There
was no lack of energy from USC from
the first snap to the last, and that makes
USC nearly impossible to beat, espe
cially with the home crowd providing
such support. Add in huge momentum
boosts for the Trojans chief among
them being the pick-six by Nickel!
Robey in the waning minutes and it
would take a miraculous effort by the
Cardinal to pull out the victory.
And that's just what happened.
Now, don't get me wrong. Stanford
was far from perfect very far.
Penalties, bad play-calling, poor
throws, dropped passes, bad block
ing, missed tackles, bad special teams
play ... to say there was room for
improvement is an understatement.
But as the saying goes, big-time play
ers make big-time plays, and that's
just what the Cardinal did.
Looking forward, many people
question how Stanford can compete
with an even better opponent (Ore
gon) when the Cardinal struggled so
mightily with USC. The notion of a
transitive property for those of
you far removed from math class,
that is the idea that Oregon is way
better than USC and USC almost
beat Stanford so Oregon should
beat Stanford does not hold true
in the sports world.
Oregon is a very different team
with very different matchup prob
lems from the ones offered by USC.
The game will be played in a much
different atmosphere (Stanford Sta
dium) with different personnel
(such as Delano Howell, hopefully)
on a different week (12 days away
and counting). Previous results give
you an idea of what a team will do,
but they don't tell the whole story.
Sometimes there's more to a game
than the numbers.

Of course, numbers can still say a
whole lot, and this is Stat on the
Back, so let's take a look at the num
bers that mattered:

-6,4: Coming into the game, Stan
ford had not trailed a single time all

season and had not been tied at any
point after the first score. In this
game, there were six lead changes
and four ties, half of which came in
the overtimes. To say Stanford was
finally challenged is putting it
lightly.
11, 91: Known as a disciplined
team, the Cardinal was anything
but against the Trojans and their
crowd. Stanford committed 11
penalties for 91 yards after averag
ing roughly half those totals (five
penalties for 45 yards) the rest of
the season. Some penalties, such as
a pass interference call against
Robert Woods, were somewhat jus
tified. Others, like a pair of delay
of-game calls on Luck, a too-many
men-in-the huddle call and two off
sides penalties on nose tackle Ter
rence Stephens, were much sloppi
er. In a close game, these penalties
almost cost Stanford its undefeated
season.
145, 2: USC running back Curtis
McNeal looked like LaMichael
James as he gashed Stanford's pre
viously stout rush defense for 145
yards and two touchdowns, both ca
reer highs. McNeal came in as the
second-best running back on a
pass-centered offense, but when
Marc Tyler went down to injury,
McNeal stepped up in a big way (at
least until the final play of the
game). The Cardinal defense is still
ranked sixth in the country in rush
ing yards allowed, but the past few
weeks have exposed some glaring
weaknesses against the run.
2, 0: Many people thought this
game would come down to line
play, and Stanford had arguably the
nation's best lines on paper before
the game. Despite allowing just two
sacks all season, the Cardinal offen
sive line let USC double that total
with a pair of sacks of Luck among
several QB hurries. Meanwhile, the
much-praised Stanford pass rush
hardly got to Matt Barkley at all and
failed to record a sack. In fact, the
Cardinal registered just four tackles
for loss, only half its season average.
17: It was a good day for players
wearing No. 17. Linebacker AJ.
Tarpley starting in place of the in
jured Shayne Skov picked off
Barkley in the first half and later
forced a fumble. His biggest contri
bution of all, though, was falling on
McNeal's fumble in the end zone to
end the game.
The leading receiver in the game,
with 102 yards receiving, was ...
Griff Whalen? Yep, Luck's room
mate was his favorite target on big
third-down plays, and Whalen re

sponded with some great catches.
Meanwhile, Woods, possibly the best
receiver in the nation, finished with
89 receiving yards on nine catches
and didn't even lead his own team in
receiving. The Stanford defense had
many flaws, but it did hold Woods
down.

99: Stepfan Taylor was just a yard
away from notching his fifth 100-
yard rushing game in the past six
contests. Taylor carried the load for
Stanford, setting a season high with
23 carries, and his two touchdowns
were in the most crucial situations.
The first one tied the game with 38
seconds to play in regulation, and
the second one proved to be the
game-winner in triple overtime. Just
like nearly every other game, the
running game eventually overpow
ered the USC defense after a slow
start.

39: Thanks to Jordan Williamson
being a late scratch due to an undis
closed injury, Stanford had to rely on
its backup kicker, Eric Whitaker. He
responded by making all six of his
extra points and both his field goal
attempts, but kickoffs were another
story. Whitaker kicked off out of
bounds twice, and in all, half of
USC's 12 drives started at the Trojan
39 or better. That kind of field-posi
tion advantage is tough to over
come, and the Cardinal likely can't
afford a repeat of that performance.
93,607: The listed attendance of
93,607 means that the game was a
sellout, and I have no doubt that
there were at least 90,000 people in
attendance. Apart from the obvious
impact in terms of noise and mo
mentum, the sellout (the first at the
Coliseum since 2009) shows just
how important this game was to
USC.

3: The win was Stanford's third
straight in the Coliseum. The last
time the Cardinal won three straight
road games with USC? The 19305.
This really was a historic win.
16: It might have been the nar
rowest escape in years, but Stan
ford's winning streak is intact.

56-48: Just admire that score. It's
never going to get old.

That said, this game was less about
stats than any game I have ever seen.
This game was about intangibles and
grit, momentum and fight, hostile en
vironment and motivation and every
other term I usually ignore. In most
games, a play-by-play and box score
can tell you everything you need to
know, but in this one, you had to be
there. You had to be a part of that at
mosphere, and you had to see the
drama unfold to understand just what
took place.
Let's be clear on one thing: the fact
that Stanford very narrowly beat a
USC team that has somehow flown
under the radar should not diminish
anyone's view of the Cardinal.
For one thing, USC is a high-cal
iber team with NFL talent overflow
ing on both sides of the ball. There
could be three top-10 picks on the of
fense alone, as quarterback Matt
Barkley and left tackle Matt Kalil are
projected to enter the draft this year,
and wide receiver Robert Woods will
be among the nation's best prospects
when he is eligible.
Just as importantly, USC had as
much intangible benefit as I could
imagine in this game. While I usually
downplay the importance of things
like "motivation" (doesn't everyone
want to win every game?), I changed
my tune after seeing the Trojans. The
local radio before the game was abuzz
with the most anticipation fans had
had for any game in years. People
have talked about USC having noth
ing to play for, because the Trojans
cannot make the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game or a bowl game due to
NCAA sanctions.
Immediately upon entering the
Coliseum parking lot, it became ap
parent that this game really was
"USC's Super Bowl." ESPN's College
Game Day brought an even greater
media presence than usual to USC
football, throngs of fans filled the Col
iseum and the players were as riled up
as any team I've seen for a regular
season matchup.
After taking a second-half lead,
the Trojans did their best Georgia im
pression, acting as though each and
every player had just won the lottery
at the exact same time. With over 25

minutes to go in regulation, USC
players were jumping on benches,
huddling up and screaming along
with their tens of thousands of fans.

Call it what you will, but there was
little doubt that the Trojans were play
ing at their peak effort level all game
long. USC, with or without sanctions,
usually has the best talent on the field
no matter what team it plays, but the
issue can sometimes be effort. There
was no lack of energy from USC from
the first snap to the last, and that makes
USC nearly impossible to beat, espe
cially with the home crowd providing
such support. Add in huge momentum
boosts for the Trojans chief among
them being the pick-six by Nickel!
Robey in the waning minutes and it
would take a miraculous effort by the
Cardinal to pull out the victory.
And that's just what happened.
Now, don't get me wrong. Stanford
was far from perfect very far.
Penalties, bad play-calling, poor
throws, dropped passes, bad block
ing, missed tackles, bad special teams
play ... to say there was room for
improvement is an understatement.
But as the saying goes, big-time play
ers make big-time plays, and that's
just what the Cardinal did.
Looking forward, many people
question how Stanford can compete
with an even better opponent (Ore
gon) when the Cardinal struggled so
mightily with USC. The notion of a
transitive property for those of
you far removed from math class,
that is the idea that Oregon is way
better than USC and USC almost
beat Stanford so Oregon should
beat Stanford does not hold true
in the sports world.
Oregon is a very different team
with very different matchup prob
lems from the ones offered by USC.
The game will be played in a much
different atmosphere (Stanford Sta
dium) with different personnel
(such as Delano Howell, hopefully)
on a different week (12 days away
and counting). Previous results give
you an idea of what a team will do,
but they don't tell the whole story.
Sometimes there's more to a game
than the numbers.

Of course, numbers can still say a
whole lot, and this is Stat on the
Back, so let's take a look at the num
bers that mattered:

-6,4: Coming into the game, Stan
ford had not trailed a single time all

season and had not been tied at any
point after the first score. In this
game, there were six lead changes
and four ties, half of which came in
the overtimes. To say Stanford was
finally challenged is putting it
lightly.
11, 91: Known as a disciplined
team, the Cardinal was anything
but against the Trojans and their
crowd. Stanford committed 11
penalties for 91 yards after averag
ing roughly half those totals (five
penalties for 45 yards) the rest of
the season. Some penalties, such as
a pass interference call against
Robert Woods, were somewhat jus
tified. Others, like a pair of delay
of-game calls on Luck, a too-many
men-in-the huddle call and two off
sides penalties on nose tackle Ter
rence Stephens, were much sloppi
er. In a close game, these penalties
almost cost Stanford its undefeated
season.
145, 2: USC running back Curtis
McNeal looked like LaMichael
James as he gashed Stanford's pre
viously stout rush defense for 145
yards and two touchdowns, both ca
reer highs. McNeal came in as the
second-best running back on a
pass-centered offense, but when
Marc Tyler went down to injury,
McNeal stepped up in a big way (at
least until the final play of the
game). The Cardinal defense is still
ranked sixth in the country in rush
ing yards allowed, but the past few
weeks have exposed some glaring
weaknesses against the run.
2, 0: Many people thought this
game would come down to line
play, and Stanford had arguably the
nation's best lines on paper before
the game. Despite allowing just two
sacks all season, the Cardinal offen
sive line let USC double that total
with a pair of sacks of Luck among
several QB hurries. Meanwhile, the
much-praised Stanford pass rush
hardly got to Matt Barkley at all and
failed to record a sack. In fact, the
Cardinal registered just four tackles
for loss, only half its season average.
17: It was a good day for players
wearing No. 17. Linebacker AJ.
Tarpley starting in place of the in
jured Shayne Skov picked off
Barkley in the first half and later
forced a fumble. His biggest contri
bution of all, though, was falling on
McNeal's fumble in the end zone to
end the game.
The leading receiver in the game,
with 102 yards receiving, was ...
Griff Whalen? Yep, Luck's room
mate was his favorite target on big
third-down plays, and Whalen re

sponded with some great catches.
Meanwhile, Woods, possibly the best
receiver in the nation, finished with
89 receiving yards on nine catches
and didn't even lead his own team in
receiving. The Stanford defense had
many flaws, but it did hold Woods
down.

99: Stepfan Taylor was just a yard
away from notching his fifth 100-
yard rushing game in the past six
contests. Taylor carried the load for
Stanford, setting a season high with
23 carries, and his two touchdowns
were in the most crucial situations.
The first one tied the game with 38
seconds to play in regulation, and
the second one proved to be the
game-winner in triple overtime. Just
like nearly every other game, the
running game eventually overpow
ered the USC defense after a slow
start.

39: Thanks to Jordan Williamson
being a late scratch due to an undis
closed injury, Stanford had to rely on
its backup kicker, Eric Whitaker. He
responded by making all six of his
extra points and both his field goal
attempts, but kickoffs were another
story. Whitaker kicked off out of
bounds twice, and in all, half of
USC's 12 drives started at the Trojan
39 or better. That kind of field-posi
tion advantage is tough to over
come, and the Cardinal likely can't
afford a repeat of that performance.
93,607: The listed attendance of
93,607 means that the game was a
sellout, and I have no doubt that
there were at least 90,000 people in
attendance. Apart from the obvious
impact in terms of noise and mo
mentum, the sellout (the first at the
Coliseum since 2009) shows just
how important this game was to
USC.

3: The win was Stanford's third
straight in the Coliseum. The last
time the Cardinal won three straight
road games with USC? The 19305.
This really was a historic win.
16: It might have been the nar
rowest escape in years, but Stan
ford's winning streak is intact.

56-48: Just admire that score. It's
never going to get old.

Jacob Jaffe nearly fell off of his perch
atop the roof of the Los Angeles
Coliseum when Tarpley fell on the
loose ball in the end zone. Only di
vine intervention and Jaffe's tremen
dous core strength allowed him to
enjoy the Stanford victory in his own
bed and not a hospital. For more
