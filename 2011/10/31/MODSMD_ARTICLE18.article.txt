# USC game transcends statistics
## 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Saturday marked the zeroth
anniversary of one of the
most thrilling and memo
rable games in Stanford
football history. Stat on the
Back looks at how it all went down at
the Coliseum.
Number of the game: 0, as in the
number of statistics that can accurate
ly describe the madness that was Stan
ford vs. USC.
Let's be clear: I love stats. I mean,
really, I have an unhealthy obsession
with everything from third-down con
version rate to punt-return defense.
Every time I watch a game, I find
every random stat I can, and I have yet
to meet a person that cares half as
much about the stats I babble as I do.
That said, this game was less about
stats than any game I have ever seen.
This game was about intangibles and
grit, momentum and fight, hostile en
vironment and motivation and every
other term I usually ignore. In most
games, a play-by-play and box score
can tell you everything you need to
know, but in this one, you had to be
there. You had to be a part of that at
mosphere, and you had to see the
drama unfold to understand just what
took place.
Let's be clear on one thing: the fact
that Stanford very narrowly beat a
USC team that has somehow flown
under the radar should not diminish
anyone's view of the Cardinal.
For one thing, USC is a high-cal
iber team with NFL talent overflow
ing on both sides of the ball. There
could be three top-10 picks on the of
fense alone, as quarterback Matt
Barkley and left tackle Matt Kalil are
projected to enter the draft this year,
and wide receiver Robert Woods will
be among the nation's best prospects
when he is eligible.
Just as importantly, USC had as
much intangible benefit as I could
imagine in this game. While I usually
downplay the importance of things
like "motivation" (doesn't everyone
want to win every game?), I changed
my tune after seeing the Trojans. The
local radio before the game was abuzz
with the most anticipation fans had
had for any game in years. People
have talked about USC having noth
ing to play for, because the Trojans
cannot make the Pac-12 Champi
onship Game or a bowl game due to
NCAA sanctions.
Immediately upon entering the
Coliseum parking lot, it became ap
parent that this game really was
"USC's Super Bowl." ESPN's College
Game Day brought an even greater
media presence than usual to USC
football, throngs of fans filled the Col
iseum and the players were as riled up
as any team I've seen for a regular
season matchup.
After taking a second-half lead,
the Trojans did their best Georgia im
pression, acting as though each and
every player had just won the lottery
at the exact same time. With over 25
