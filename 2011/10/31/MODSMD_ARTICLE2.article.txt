10/29, Los Angeles, Calif.

In the most dramatic game of the
2011 college football season, the Stan
ford football team rallied from a 10-
point deficit in the second half to force
extra football against the USC Trojans
before pulling off a 56-48 victory in
triple overtime.
The No. 4 Cardinal (8-0,6-0 Pac-12)
was pushed to the limit over and over
again on a wild night in Los Angeles, but
redshirt junior quarterback Andrew
Luck turned in the greatest perform
ance of his career when it mattered
most right after what could have
been the single worst moment in his
time with Stanford.
With 3:45 left in the fourth quarter
and the score tied at 27, the Cardinal got
the ball on its own 16-yard line, leaving
Luck in prime position to pull off the
fifth fourth-quarter comeback victory

of his career.
Facing a third down after a 7-yard
run by junior running back Stepfan
Taylor, Luck dropped back, looked
right and fired toward diving senior
wide receiver Chris Owusu, but Trojan
safety Nickell Robey pounced on the
pass and dashed into the end zone as
the sellout crowd of 93,607 let forth a
deafening roar at the superstar s sud
den misfortune.
"I was very disappointed in myself,"
Luck said after the game. "For a couple
seconds, I wanted to dig a hole and go
bury myself in it."
Now down 34-27, Luck would get
the ball back with a chance to redeem
himself with 3:03 to go a moment
that inspired resiliency, not dejection,
on the Stanford sideline.
"We always have faith in our of
fense," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "I never once doubted that
they would come back and score."
"We put the ball in our quarter
back s hands. We put it on his shoulders,
and [the] kid comes through," said head
coach David Shaw. "He was so upset,
and he was upset about it for about 45
seconds. Then he flushed it, and he
made the plays to help us come back
and win the game... He was not going
to let that play lose the game for us."
With the clock rapidly fading. Luck

and company charged 76 yards in 10
plays spurred by a vicious helmet
to-helmet hit on Owusu on a third
down incompletion before Taylor
barreled over the right side of the line
for a 2-yard touchdown with 38 seconds
left.
The Trojans then completed a trio of
passes to get close to field-goal range,
but wide receiver Robert Woods could
n't get out of bounds quickly enough on
the last play of regulation for USC to at
tempt a field goal, sending the game
into overtime. This time, the Cardinal's
feeling of resiliency turned into confi
dence.
"We looked at each other and said,
'We're going to do it. We're going to win
this game," said senior tackle Jonathan
Martin. "Overtime, we knew we were
going to win from the start. We knew
that we can fight through everything."
In overtime, Stanford took the ball
first and kept to the ground, running
seven straight times before senior Jere
my Stewart dove over the goal line for a
score. USC responded with a perfect
touchdown pass from quarterback
Matt Barkley to Woods to send the
game to another overtime period.
In double overtime, Barkley flipped
a pass to tight end Randall Telfer, who
broke through four Stanford defenders
before stretching across the plane to

rock the momentum back to USC.
Luck responded by returning to the air,
where he found redshirt sophomore
tight end LevineToilolo for an 11-yard
touchdown to extend the game one
more time.
On the second play of triple over
time, Taylor took a handoff and scam
pered untouched for his second touch
down of the night, which Luck then
capped by finding redshirt senior tight
end Coby Fleener wide open in the end
zone for a two-point conversion that
made it 56-48.
Barkley answered back with a 21-

yard pass to put USC on the doorstep
again, but Trojan running back Curtis
McNeal had the ball punched free from
his arms by junior defensive tackle Ter
rence Stephens immediately after tak
ing the handoff The football skipped
off McNeal into the end zone, where
Cardinal linebacker A.J. Tarpley
pounced on the ball.
This time, the Coliseum was silent
except, of course, for the Stanford
fans, located all the way on the other
side of the stadium, hundreds of yards
