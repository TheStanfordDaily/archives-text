10/29, Los Angeles, Calif.

In the most dramatic game of the
2011 college football season, the Stan
ford football team rallied from a 10-
point deficit in the second half to force
extra football against the USC Trojans
before pulling off a 56-48 victory in
triple overtime.
The No. 4 Cardinal (8-0,6-0 Pac-12)
was pushed to the limit over and over
again on a wild night in Los Angeles, but
redshirt junior quarterback Andrew
Luck turned in the greatest perform
ance of his career when it mattered
most right after what could have
been the single worst moment in his
time with Stanford.
With 3:45 left in the fourth quarter
and the score tied at 27, the Cardinal got
the ball on its own 16-yard line, leaving
Luck in prime position to pull off the
fifth fourth-quarter comeback victory

of his career.
Facing a third down after a 7-yard
run by junior running back Stepfan
Taylor, Luck dropped back, looked
right and fired toward diving senior
wide receiver Chris Owusu, but Trojan
safety Nickell Robey pounced on the
pass and dashed into the end zone as
the sellout crowd of 93,607 let forth a
deafening roar at the superstar s sud
den misfortune.
"I was very disappointed in myself,"
Luck said after the game. "For a couple
seconds, I wanted to dig a hole and go
bury myself in it."
Now down 34-27, Luck would get
the ball back with a chance to redeem
himself with 3:03 to go a moment
that inspired resiliency, not dejection,
on the Stanford sideline.
"We always have faith in our of
fense," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "I never once doubted that
they would come back and score."
"We put the ball in our quarter
back s hands. We put it on his shoulders,
and [the] kid comes through," said head
coach David Shaw. "He was so upset,
and he was upset about it for about 45
seconds. Then he flushed it, and he
made the plays to help us come back
and win the game... He was not going
to let that play lose the game for us."
With the clock rapidly fading. Luck

and company charged 76 yards in 10
plays spurred by a vicious helmet
to-helmet hit on Owusu on a third
down incompletion before Taylor
barreled over the right side of the line
for a 2-yard touchdown with 38 seconds
left.
The Trojans then completed a trio of
passes to get close to field-goal range,
but wide receiver Robert Woods could
n't get out of bounds quickly enough on
the last play of regulation for USC to at
tempt a field goal, sending the game
into overtime. This time, the Cardinal's
feeling of resiliency turned into confi
dence.
"We looked at each other and said,
'We're going to do it. We're going to win
this game," said senior tackle Jonathan
Martin. "Overtime, we knew we were
going to win from the start. We knew
that we can fight through everything."
In overtime, Stanford took the ball
first and kept to the ground, running
seven straight times before senior Jere
my Stewart dove over the goal line for a
score. USC responded with a perfect
touchdown pass from quarterback
Matt Barkley to Woods to send the
game to another overtime period.
In double overtime, Barkley flipped
a pass to tight end Randall Telfer, who
broke through four Stanford defenders
before stretching across the plane to

rock the momentum back to USC.
Luck responded by returning to the air,
where he found redshirt sophomore
tight end LevineToilolo for an 11-yard
touchdown to extend the game one
more time.
On the second play of triple over
time, Taylor took a handoff and scam
pered untouched for his second touch
down of the night, which Luck then
capped by finding redshirt senior tight
end Coby Fleener wide open in the end
zone for a two-point conversion that
made it 56-48.
Barkley answered back with a 21-

yard pass to put USC on the doorstep
again, but Trojan running back Curtis
McNeal had the ball punched free from
his arms by junior defensive tackle Ter
rence Stephens immediately after tak
ing the handoff The football skipped
off McNeal into the end zone, where
Cardinal linebacker A.J. Tarpley
pounced on the ball.
This time, the Coliseum was silent
except, of course, for the Stanford
fans, located all the way on the other
side of the stadium, hundreds of yards


WALLY SKALIJ/LOS ANGELES TIMES/MCT
Stanford sophomore linebacker A.J. Tarpley recovers the fumble of USC running back Curtis McNeal in the third overtime to finish off a back-and-forth 56-48 win at the Los Angeles Coliseum
on Saturday. Tarpley had a career day, as he also intercepted a pass in No. 4 Stanford's narrowest victory of the year.

away from where the drama finally
ended.
In a hoarse voice, Shaw praised his
team for standing tall when the Cardi
nal faced its toughest test of football in
almost an entire calendar year.
"We talked about fighting adversi
ty â€” I didn't know it would be this
much adversity but the kids fought
through, and I love them to death for
it," he said.
Shaw, who said on Tuesday that he
was running out of words to describe
his quarterback, found a new, peculiar
metaphor to describe Luck's role as
the heart and soul of Cardinal football.
"The thing you can't forget about
Andrew is that he is the most compet
itive guy on our team," he said. "So
when a bad play happens, he goes
completely down in the dumps. He's
so upset, furious, and then it's like
flushing a toilet. It's like it never hap

pened, and he moves on."
Luck finished the day 29-of-40 for
330 yards with three touchdowns and
the lone interception through the air,
and he added 36 yards and a touch
down on the ground. But the reason
for the hyperbole that will stick firmly
to this performance was not because
of the stats, but because Luck respond
ed when the nuclear clock for the Car
dinal was very close to striking mid
night several times. In fact, the Trojans'
stirring second half led to several sta
dium-wide announcements asking
fans to stay off the field at the end of
the game.
After a defensive struggle in the
first half left Stanford with a 10-6 lead,
the Trojans scored on their first two
drives of the second half with a pair of
long rushing touchdowns from Mc-
Neal to give USC a 20-10 lead.
And although Stanford had not
trailed to a single opponent yet this
season, the suddenly raucous atmos
phere failed to frazzle the Cardinal.
"We always talk about adversity as
an opportunity for greatness," said
junior defensive end Ben Gardner.

"So this was really our first opportuni
ty to show up mentally and show what
we're made of We got behind, but we
never lost faith."
Luck then led Stanford to touch
downs on its next two possessions in
the third quarter to take the lead back
at 24-20, passing his first major test of
the year and setting the table for his
fourth-quarter heroics.

And while the Cardinal can no
longer boast that it has beaten all com
ers by 25 or more points, Luck and
company escaped the upset to remain
undefeated and in the heart of the
hunt for the BCS National Champi
onship Game with four games left on
its schedule but that doesn't mean
that those presumptuous stadium
wide announcements didn't register.
"I heard it," Thomas said. "But
that's why you gotta keep playing."
Stanford will go on the road again
this weekend as it heads to Corvallis,
Ore., to tangle with Oregon State on
Saturday.

Stanford sophomore linebacker A.J. Tarpley recovers the fumble of USC running back Curtis McNeal in the third overtime to finish off a back-and-forth 56-48 win at the Los Angeles Coliseum
on Saturday. Tarpley had a career day, as he also intercepted a pass in No. 4 Stanford's narrowest victory of the year.

ended.
In a hoarse voice, Shaw praised his
team for standing tall when the Cardi
nal faced its toughest test of football in
almost an entire calendar year.
"We talked about fighting adversi
ty â€” I didn't know it would be this
much adversity but the kids fought
through, and I love them to death for
it," he said.
Shaw, who said on Tuesday that he
was running out of words to describe
his quarterback, found a new, peculiar
metaphor to describe Luck's role as
the heart and soul of Cardinal football.
"The thing you can't forget about
Andrew is that he is the most compet
itive guy on our team," he said. "So
when a bad play happens, he goes
completely down in the dumps. He's
so upset, furious, and then it's like
flushing a toilet. It's like it never hap

pened, and he moves on."
Luck finished the day 29-of-40 for
330 yards with three touchdowns and
the lone interception through the air,
and he added 36 yards and a touch
down on the ground. But the reason
for the hyperbole that will stick firmly
to this performance was not because
of the stats, but because Luck respond
ed when the nuclear clock for the Car
dinal was very close to striking mid
night several times. In fact, the Trojans'
stirring second half led to several sta
dium-wide announcements asking
fans to stay off the field at the end of
the game.
After a defensive struggle in the
first half left Stanford with a 10-6 lead,
the Trojans scored on their first two
drives of the second half with a pair of
long rushing touchdowns from Mc-
Neal to give USC a 20-10 lead.
And although Stanford had not
trailed to a single opponent yet this
season, the suddenly raucous atmos
phere failed to frazzle the Cardinal.
"We always talk about adversity as
an opportunity for greatness," said
junior defensive end Ben Gardner.

"So this was really our first opportuni
ty to show up mentally and show what
we're made of We got behind, but we
never lost faith."
Luck then led Stanford to touch
downs on its next two possessions in
the third quarter to take the lead back
at 24-20, passing his first major test of
the year and setting the table for his
fourth-quarter heroics.

And while the Cardinal can no
longer boast that it has beaten all com
ers by 25 or more points, Luck and
company escaped the upset to remain
undefeated and in the heart of the
hunt for the BCS National Champi
onship Game with four games left on
its schedule but that doesn't mean
that those presumptuous stadium
wide announcements didn't register.

10/29, Los Angeles, Calif.

In the most dramatic game of the
2011 college football season, the Stan
ford football team rallied from a 10-
point deficit in the second half to force
extra football against the USC Trojans
before pulling off a 56-48 victory in
triple overtime.
The No. 4 Cardinal (8-0,6-0 Pac-12)
was pushed to the limit over and over
again on a wild night in Los Angeles, but
redshirt junior quarterback Andrew
Luck turned in the greatest perform
ance of his career when it mattered
most right after what could have
been the single worst moment in his
time with Stanford.
With 3:45 left in the fourth quarter
and the score tied at 27, the Cardinal got
the ball on its own 16-yard line, leaving
Luck in prime position to pull off the
fifth fourth-quarter comeback victory

of his career.
Facing a third down after a 7-yard
run by junior running back Stepfan
Taylor, Luck dropped back, looked
right and fired toward diving senior
wide receiver Chris Owusu, but Trojan
safety Nickell Robey pounced on the
pass and dashed into the end zone as
the sellout crowd of 93,607 let forth a
deafening roar at the superstar s sud
den misfortune.
"I was very disappointed in myself,"
Luck said after the game. "For a couple
seconds, I wanted to dig a hole and go
bury myself in it."
Now down 34-27, Luck would get
the ball back with a chance to redeem
himself with 3:03 to go a moment
that inspired resiliency, not dejection,
on the Stanford sideline.
"We always have faith in our of
fense," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "I never once doubted that
they would come back and score."
"We put the ball in our quarter
back s hands. We put it on his shoulders,
and [the] kid comes through," said head
coach David Shaw. "He was so upset,
and he was upset about it for about 45
seconds. Then he flushed it, and he
made the plays to help us come back
and win the game... He was not going
to let that play lose the game for us."
With the clock rapidly fading. Luck

and company charged 76 yards in 10
plays spurred by a vicious helmet
to-helmet hit on Owusu on a third
down incompletion before Taylor
barreled over the right side of the line
for a 2-yard touchdown with 38 seconds
left.
The Trojans then completed a trio of
passes to get close to field-goal range,
but wide receiver Robert Woods could
n't get out of bounds quickly enough on
the last play of regulation for USC to at
tempt a field goal, sending the game
into overtime. This time, the Cardinal's
feeling of resiliency turned into confi
dence.
"We looked at each other and said,
'We're going to do it. We're going to win
this game," said senior tackle Jonathan
Martin. "Overtime, we knew we were
going to win from the start. We knew
that we can fight through everything."
In overtime, Stanford took the ball
first and kept to the ground, running
seven straight times before senior Jere
my Stewart dove over the goal line for a
score. USC responded with a perfect
touchdown pass from quarterback
Matt Barkley to Woods to send the
game to another overtime period.
In double overtime, Barkley flipped
a pass to tight end Randall Telfer, who
broke through four Stanford defenders
before stretching across the plane to

rock the momentum back to USC.
Luck responded by returning to the air,
where he found redshirt sophomore
tight end LevineToilolo for an 11-yard
touchdown to extend the game one
more time.
On the second play of triple over
time, Taylor took a handoff and scam
pered untouched for his second touch
down of the night, which Luck then
capped by finding redshirt senior tight
end Coby Fleener wide open in the end
zone for a two-point conversion that
made it 56-48.
Barkley answered back with a 21-

yard pass to put USC on the doorstep
again, but Trojan running back Curtis
McNeal had the ball punched free from
his arms by junior defensive tackle Ter
rence Stephens immediately after tak
ing the handoff The football skipped
off McNeal into the end zone, where
