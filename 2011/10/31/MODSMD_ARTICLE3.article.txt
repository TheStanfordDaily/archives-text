## Moore warns of 'seduction' by Wall Street Talk reflects on Occupy protests, student futures 
### CHRISTOPHER KREMER 
Emmy Award-winning documentary
filmmaker Michael Moore spoke Friday
night about students as a force for public
good, touching on the Occupy Wall Street
movement, college debt, American for
eign policy and his endeavors prior to his
filmmaking career.
The talk, organized by the Stanford
Speakers Bureau, took place in the new
Knight Management Center's CEMEX
Auditorium.

Moore began by addressing the Occu
py Wall Street protests, which he praised
for being an organic movement that
would help reshape the country's social
and economic landscape for the better.

"Until we get control of Wall Street,
we'll be saddled by problem after prob
lem," he said.
Event organizers also noted the rele
vance of the nationwide Occupy protests
to students at Stanford.

"The nation generally and the school
more specifically have definitely been
thinking about the Occupy movement
more recently," said Co-Director of the
Speakers Bureau Rahul Sastry 'l2. "And
I think there are few people who can
speak to the nation's anger better than
Michael Moore on this topic."

Moore contrasted the current state of
labor rights and the economy in America
to those of yesteryear, saying that he was
hopeful about the current generation.
"You probably don't know that your
generation has almost ended bigotry and
racism," Moore said. "The previous gen
eration set up a bad system."
However, he also expressed concern

that students at Stanford and other elite
universities are often drawn to high-pow
ered jobs that hurt American society.
Backstage, he said that it is understand
able that some Stanford students are mo
tivated by greed.
"They see nothing but dollars paving
the path in their futures," he said. "Why
would anyone want to give that up? The
seduction has already started to take
place just by being a student at Stanford.
You begin to believe that you're the cho
sen ones."

This was the attitude that Moore said
he hoped to address during his talk.
"It's kind of like missionary work," he
said. "I realize I'm talking to some of the
future people who are going to mess with
peoples' lives just so they can make a
buck. So if one or two tonight will go back
and think a little bit, that made it worth

coming here."
After the talk, students, some
dressed in their Halloween cos
tumes, lined up at the two micro
phones in the aisles to ask Moore
questions. Many of those present,
including ASSU Vice President
Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3,
were concerned about getting
their peers more politically aware
and active. Moore said in response
that students cannot be forced to

be more engaged.
Moore concluded his visit by
reading an excerpt from his newly
released book "Here Comes Trou
ble" and then hosting a book sign
ing.

The majority of the over-400-
person audience, comprised of un
dergraduates, graduate students
and community members, who
spoke to The Daily responded pos
itively to Moore's talk.

"I think that Michael Moore
and the way that he speaks his
mind so openly and without
hesitation is so inspiring. I want
ed to hear what he had to say," said
Casey Khademi 'l4, to whom

Moore pledged $5OO for equip
ment for her documentary on the
LGBT community.
"We're likely going to be those
students who are going into the
high-powered jobs," said Camil
Diaz 'l3. "But if we can be a group
of people who are very politically
conscious morally responsible
I think there's potential for
great change there."
Funding for the Moore's talk, as
well as other Stanford Speakers
Bureau events, comes from ASSU
special fees.
