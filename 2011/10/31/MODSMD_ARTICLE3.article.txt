## Moore warns of 'seduction' by Wall Street Talk reflects on Occupy protests, student futures 
### CHRISTOPHER KREMER 
Emmy Award-winning documentary
filmmaker Michael Moore spoke Friday
night about students as a force for public
good, touching on the Occupy Wall Street
movement, college debt, American for
eign policy and his endeavors prior to his
filmmaking career.
The talk, organized by the Stanford
Speakers Bureau, took place in the new
Knight Management Center's CEMEX
Auditorium.

Moore began by addressing the Occu
py Wall Street protests, which he praised
for being an organic movement that
would help reshape the country's social
and economic landscape for the better.

"Until we get control of Wall Street,
we'll be saddled by problem after prob
lem," he said.
Event organizers also noted the rele
vance of the nationwide Occupy protests
to students at Stanford.

"The nation generally and the school
more specifically have definitely been
thinking about the Occupy movement
more recently," said Co-Director of the
Speakers Bureau Rahul Sastry 'l2. "And
I think there are few people who can
speak to the nation's anger better than
Michael Moore on this topic."

Moore contrasted the current state of
labor rights and the economy in America
to those of yesteryear, saying that he was
hopeful about the current generation.
"You probably don't know that your
generation has almost ended bigotry and
racism," Moore said. "The previous gen
eration set up a bad system."
However, he also expressed concern

that students at Stanford and other elite
universities are often drawn to high-pow
ered jobs that hurt American society.
Backstage, he said that it is understand
able that some Stanford students are mo
tivated by greed.
"They see nothing but dollars paving
the path in their futures," he said. "Why
would anyone want to give that up? The
seduction has already started to take
place just by being a student at Stanford.
You begin to believe that you're the cho
sen ones."

This was the attitude that Moore said
he hoped to address during his talk.
"It's kind of like missionary work," he
said. "I realize I'm talking to some of the
future people who are going to mess with
peoples' lives just so they can make a
buck. So if one or two tonight will go back
and think a little bit, that made it worth
