## CS senior identifies bug in Adobe Flash Player 
### SARAH MOORE 
Stanford computer scientist
Feross Aboukhadijeh 'll recently
discovered a bug in the widely used
Adobe Flash Player that allowed
malicious websites access to a
Flash user's webcam and micro
phone.

According to Aboukhadijeh,
two weeks after initial attempts to
contact Adobe and inform it of the
bug, Aboukhadijeh had received
no responses. Unaware that the
Adobe employee he emailed was
on a period of leave, Aboukhadijeh
posted about his discovery on his
website feross.org onTues., Oct. 18.
Through Adobe Product Secu
rity Incident Response Team
(PSIRT) monitoring activities,
Adobe became aware of this post
and the problem and fixed the glitch
within two days of becoming aware
of the bug, Aboukhadijeh said.
Before the bug was fixed, these
attacks on Flash were possible be
cause the software has access to a
user's webcam and microphone. As
privacy settings can be changed on
line, an attacker could trick a Flash
user into changing his or her set
tings.

In a technique known as "click
jacking," the attacker could put the
settings in an invisible window and
place that window over a part of
the site, for example a game, where
the user would be making many
clicks and unknowingly changing
settings via the invisible window.
"So you play this game where
you click some buttons, and if you
do enough clicks, then you actually
changed your settings and allowed
whatever website did this attack to
access your webcam and do what
ever they want with it,"
Aboukhadijeh said.
There are many potential mali
cious uses for exploiting such bugs.
"Let's say you're a dissident in a
country with a repressive govern
ment and you're trying to browse
the Internet to share information
about what's going on in your coun
try," Aboukhadijeh said. "If you
land on some website and that web
site's been ordered by the govern
ment to install this attack code on
their site, and you think you're look
ing at this new site, but really you're
turning on this camera so then the

government can have pictures of
everyone who's browsing a particu
lar site. And who knows what would
happen to those people."
Both Aboukhadijeh and
Adobe's Senior Director of Product

Security & Privacy Brad Arkin inde
pendently said that they did not
have any evidence to suggest that
the bug had been exploited before it
was fixed. However, the potential
for an attacker to gather video and
audio without conscious user con
sent prompted Adobe to address
the issue once it came to the compa
ny's attention.
"The incident-response process
was immediately put into action,
and the affected product team was
notified," Arkin said in an email to
The Daily. "Proper triaging of the
vulnerability was performed, and
the issue was resolved with a change
to the Flash Player Settings Manag
er SWF file hosted on the Adobe
website."

Users do not need to update
Flash or take any other action for
this increased protection, as the
issue stemmed only from Adobe's
website and not the software.

Adobe had seen this problem
with Flash in 2008, which is what led
Aboukhadijeh to the discovery.
While taking CS 155 Computer and
Network Security last spring,
Aboukhadijeh learned about these
"clickjacking" bugs. This quarter,
while doing his own research, he
learned about the Flash problem
from two years previous and discov
ered that the glitch had indeed not
been fixed.

Adobe Flash Player is not the
only software with the potential for
this type of bug. Essentially, any soft
ware one installs on his or her com
puter carries this capability as plug
ins can have virtually complete ac
cess to one's computer.
"Any kind of software that you
use where you might want to share
or there's an ability to share stuff
with other people, then you have to
worry about whether the privacy
settings are what you want," said
professor of computer science Alex
Aiken. "There's an opportunity for
people to come in and try to confuse
you and fool you."
