## Stanford Challenge sets conclusion for Dec. 31 
### KATIE MURPHY 
The University recently con
firmed that the five-year Stanford
Challenge fundraising campaign
will officially end on Dec. 31, with a
final report and press release along
with comments from President
John Hennessy to be released in
February 2012, according to Uni
versity spokeswoman Lisa Lapin.
The purpose of the Challenge is
to address societal problems
through research initiatives funded
by the program.
"The Stanford Challenge is a set
of initiatives aimed at seeking solu
tions to difficult problems facing
the world and providing unparal
leled educational opportunities for
the next generation of global lead-

ers," said Rebecca Smith Vogel, as
sistant vice president in the Office
of Development, in an email to The

Daily.
The campaign set out with spe
cific goals in human health, envi
ronment and sustainability, inter
national initiative, multidiscipli
nary research, improving K-12 ed
ucation, engaging the arts and cre
ativity, reinventing graduate edu
cation and extending the renais
sance in undergraduate education.
"Because of the complexity of
the problems in these areas, it is not
enough to approach them from the
perspective of just one discipline,"
Vogel said. "So, the Stanford Chal
lenge has had at its core a reshap
ing of the way research and teach
ing happens, bringing in scholars
from various disciplines to work
together toward a common solu
tion."

The grand total goal at the out
set of the campaign was $4 billion
across these many categories. In
addition, the original campaign
goal for endowed scholarships
tripled to $3OO million in response
to the economic crisis and the en
hanced undergraduate financial
aid program.
The Stanford Challenge has
also funded many new facilities as
one of its central goals in order to
bring scholars together from vari
ous disciplines. The Knight Man
agement Center, the Li Ka Shing
Center for Learning and Knowl
edge, the Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell
Research Building, the Huang En
gineering Center, the Lorry I.
Lokey Stanford Daily Building,
which is a workspace for The
Daily's staff, the Munger Graduate

Residence, the Neukom Building
at the Stanford Law School, the
Yang and Yamazaki Environment
and Energy Building, the Gunn
SIEPR Building and the Bing
Concert Hall, set to open in Janu
ary 2013, were all built with partial
funding raised by the Stanford
Challenge.
The program has also raised re
sources for the University's gener
al fund.

"Giving like this provides a crit
ical source of flexible support that
can be used where it is most need
ed," Vogel said. "In recent years,
that's meant to help meet the need
for undergraduate financial aid."

She also stated that there are
not currently any plans for a simi
lar campaign in the future.
"Fundraising was just a means
to help accomplish this end," she
said.
