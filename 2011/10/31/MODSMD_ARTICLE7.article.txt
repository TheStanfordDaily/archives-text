# NEWS BRIEF
## Zumot sentenced to 33 years to life 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Ellora Israni 
Former owner of downtown Palo
Alto's "Da Hookah Spot" Paul
Zumot, 37, was sentenced Friday at 3
p.m. to 33 years to life for murdering
his girlfriend Jennifer Schipsi and
burning down their home.
Zumot's sentence includes eight
years for the arson and 25 years to
life for the murder, to be served con
secutively. He is eligible for parole. It
comes eight months after jurors con
victed him of first-degree murder
and aggravated arson.
Schipsi, 29, was strangled on Oct.
15, 2009. Her body was found
burned in the Addison Avenue
home she shared with Zumot. Dur
ing the sentencing, the victim's fa
ther, Jim Schipsi, delivered the vic
tim impact statement.

During Zumot's four-and-a-half
week trial, the prosecution relied
heavily on evidence of his physical
and mental abuse during their rela
tionship such as heated text mes
sage exchanges. Zumot explicitly

claimed during the sentencing that he
is innocent and was placed in a hold
ing cell after a 20-minute outburst.
"I believe it's quite apparent
what kind of monster we're dealing
with," Jim Schipsi said.
"You are the monster," Zumot
retorted.

He rejected Santa Clara Superior
Court Judge David Cena's invitation
to re-enter the courtroom after
Schipsi's aunt Dee Towner delivered
a statement. Many of the trial's at
tendees were Schipsi's family and
friends.

"I want you to spend the rest of
your pitiful life in a j ail far away from
here," Towner said in her statement.
Zumot attempted to postpone
his sentencing by telling Cena that
he fired his attorney Mark Geragos
last month for failing to prove his in
nocence. He requested that the
court appoint him a new attorney,
but Cena stated that Zumot had
time to hire a new attorney and re
jected his reasons as insufficient to
delay his sentencing.
"This day has been a long time
coming," Jim Schipsi said in his state
ment.
