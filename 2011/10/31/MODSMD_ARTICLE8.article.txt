## CISAC experts reflect on Iraq withdrawal 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN 
Stanford military experts inter
viewed by The Daily were not sur
prised by the announcement Presi
dent Obama delivered on Fri., Oct.
21 that the United States would
withdraw all troops from Iraq by
the end of the year. The announce
ment sets a final end date for almost
a decade of U.S. occupation in the
country.

"It's not a surprise," said Colonel
Joseph Felter, a senior research fel
low at Stanford's Center for Inter
national Security and Cooperation
(CISAC). "We've planned to leave
for quite some time."
Prior to joining CISAC, Felter
served in Iraq and Afghanistan and
was the leader of the International
Security and Assistance Force,
Counterinsurgency Advisory and
Assistance Team (CAAT) in
Afghanistan.
Felter is optimistic about how far
Iraq has come in the past few years.
"In many ways, [the announce
ment] is good news ... I served
there in the days when many people
would have been doubtful that we'd
come this far," Felter said. "I think
it's a tribute to a lot of hard work
and sacrifice. The American coali
tion with the Iraqis has gotten the
country back on its feet, and it can
fend for itself."

Colonel Charlie Miller, a visiting
fellow at CISAC representing the
U.S. Army, expressed similar views

on the President's proclamation.
"We are fulfilling the obligations
that were agreed upon between
Iraq and the Untied States during
the Bush administration," Miller
said. "We signed an agreement with
[the Iraqis] called the security
agreement, and it stipulated that all
U.S. forces would be out by the first
day of 2012."

Miller also served two tours in
Iraq and was Director for Iraq in
the White House before coming to
Stanford.

Miller and Felter both noted,
however, that many predicted an
extended U.S. presence in the coun
try.

"There had been an expectation
that perhaps there would be a con
tinued role for the United States to
provide training," Miller said. "The
[lraqis] have decided at this point in
time that they're not open to contin
uing the U.S. presence in that way."

"There will be arms sales be
tween the two countries," he contin
ued. "There's going to be coopera
tion on a variety of other fields such
as economics, diplomacy and cultur
al exchanges."

Felter added that several hun
dred American personnel would re
main on the ground in Iraq for mili
tary training purposes as part of the
Office of Defensive Cooperation.
This limited continued military
presence. Miller explained, is very
much the norm of U.S. interactions
with its allies in the region.

"Like every other country in the
Middle East that we are partners
with, we have military officers as
signed to the embassy," Miller said.
"They work with the ambassador,
and they handle our foreign mili
tary sales cases ... it'll be just like a
normal relationship with Saudi
Arabia and with Kuwait."

To both Felter and Miller,
Obama's decision is a reflection of a
more general trend of American
foreign policy in the region.

"I don't think we are interested
in maintaining large troop pres
ences anywhere, to include the Mid
dle East," Felter said. "That's pretty
consistent with our overall strategy.
We don't like to occupy countries
beyond where we think national in
terests are threatened."

The continued stability of Iraq,
however, remains a very real ques
tion.

"A lot of people worry about
Iran's influence in Iraq and might
try to cast this as a victory for Iran,
and I don't think that's a good way
to think about it," Miller said. "Iraq
is naturally going to have relations
with Iran because they are their
next-door neighbor, just like we do
with Mexico and Canada. There'll
be trade, there are religious ties,
there's tourism ... but in terms of.
.. [lraq being] subservient to Iran,
it's simply not the case."
