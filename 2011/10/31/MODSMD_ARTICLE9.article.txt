In "Applications to GSB dip
8.13 percent" (Oct. 27), The Daily
incorrectly reported a quote from
Derrick Bolton, which may have
misrepresented the fact that he
does not believe applications to

business schools increase based on
the state of the economy. Bolton
also said the trend in business
school application numbers is part
of "a natural ebb and flow," not

as The Daily originally reported
"a national ebb and flow." Bolton
said that law and medical schools
do not like to disclose application
volumes, not that business schools

do not like to compare their appli
cation volumes to law and medical
schools. The Daily incorrectly re
ported that last year the GSB expe
rienced an admit rate of 6.8 per
cent. The GSB actually had an
admit rate of 6.8 percent during the
2010 application intake, and a 7.0
percent admit rate during the 2011
intake.
