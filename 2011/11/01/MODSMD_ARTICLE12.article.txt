## PROFILE Hoover's untold treasures 
### ADRIENNE VON SCHULTHESS 
archivist for exhibits and outreach
at Hoover, took a box from these
shelves and lifted the worn blue box
top. Inside, I detected x-ray sheets.
As my eyes ran across the sheets, I
gasped as I saw the words, "Hitler's
X-rays."
Next to that box was a framed
sheet of paper. It was dated Aug. 9,
1945 and labeled "Special." After
taking a closer look, I understood
that this was the order for the nu
clear strike of Nagasaki, Japan. I
could hardly believe it. Arguably
two of the most important articles
from World War II sat before my

I stood there, mystified at what
lay before me. Stacks upon
stacks, boxes upon boxes of
archives lay underneath the
ground of the Hoover Institu
tion Archives, just waiting to be
read. Shelves packed with manila
boxes lined both sides of the long,
windowless room. A whooshing
sound came from pipes that ran
overhead.

As Susan Wyle, a lecturer in the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric
(PWR), said, there are "some really
creepy things to handle" in the
Hoover Archives.
The archives are open to re
searchers, students and the general
public. They mainly contain pri
mary sources on the subject of war,
revolution and peace in the 20th
and 21st centuries.

Richard Sousa, assistant director
at Hoover and director of the
Hoover Library and Archives, said
that the archives currently focus on

China since 1949, Russia and the
former Soviet Union and political
and ideological movements in the
United States.
"We like Hoover to be the go-to
place for one-stop shopping," Sousa
said. "We try to get as much as we
can in areas where we are strong."
As assistant director, Sousa
meets with the curators, who are in
charge of soliciting new materials,
and the director of the archives to
discuss the future and focus of the
institution.
"We have curators whose job it
is to get on the road and meet peo
ple and contact people to just kind
of make contacts and build a web of
information," Sousa said.
During his 20 years at the
archives, Sousa has ensured the in
stitution's focus on acquiring in
creasingly contemporary material.
He wants materials "that are rel
evant literally to yesterday," he said.
"We've become more relevant and
we really do think much more re
search is being generated and more
people are coming in."
Siekierski said that technology
has played a major role in this drive
to have current materials. The
Hoover Archives have seen an in
crease in demand, too, due to tech
nological improvements and
through their use of technology.
The archives started a Facebook
page to highlight "quirky things,"
not just the "traditional, blowing
dust-off materials," Sousa said.
It is this exclusivity and richness
in material that gives the Hoover
Archives their value and prestige.
"You can't find [a lot of what we

have] any place else," Sousa said.
Wyle understands this signifi
cance. She organizes tours of the
archives for her PWR class and
gives extra credit to students who
conduct research at the archives.
"My favorite thing is when I get
students who don't want to do a re
search paper and were dreading the
whole thing," Wyle said. "They get
hooked on actually seeing this won
derful material and seeing that they
are in fact holding history in their
hands, and it all gets very real to
them ... [they] actually want to
share what [they] found."
"The average undergraduate
might not find materials that are
relevant," Siekierski said. "But peo
ple come in through classes, and
that sticks with them in graduate
school or further on."
This excitement is not limited to
students. Wyle, for example, contin
ues to do research there. While con
ducting her research, she found an
unopened envelope and asked the
librarian if they could open it. In
side, she found beautiful silhouettes
from a starving German man, who
wanted Hoover to send money to
his family in return for his artwork.
"It had never even been
opened," Wyle said. "So it was just
particularly touching what hap
pened to this man. And no one ever
saw it and I was the first one to open
this envelope."
Wyle's treasure was only one of
the many in the Hoover Archives
and Library.
