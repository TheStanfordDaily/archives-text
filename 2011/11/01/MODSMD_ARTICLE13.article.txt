# PROFILE
## Stanford's own 'Seventeen' 
### ASIA CHIAO 
With an identity
shaped by sports
wear, Rainbow
Sandals and T
shirts bearing
the logos of tech startups, fashion
is rarely a hot topic on the Farm.
When Cordelia Sendax 'l3
first arrived at Stanford as a fresh
man, she recalled being vaguely
surprised by the University's ap
parent lack of interest in lifestyle.
"Back at home I was never re
ally interested in fashion at all,"
Sendax said. "It wasn't until I ar
rived here that I realized how
much I missed it."
It wasn't until the fall of her
sophomore year that an opportu
nity arose for Sendax to explore
that interest. An online publica
tion known as Fler Campus was
looking to start a branch at Stan
ford, and when an email was sent
around asking for students to lead
the initiative, Sendax and her
classmate Lauren Wilson 'l3, who
is also an editor at The Daily,
jumped at the opportunity.
Her Campus was founded by a
group of undergraduate entrepre
neurs from Harvard University.
Divided into sections covering
style, health, love, life and careers,
the website targets female college
students looking for lifestyle ad
vice and information that is rele
vant to them.
But unlike many other online
lifestyle magazines, Her Campus

features individualized branches
that specifically cater to 175 dif
ferent college campuses nation
wide. Students are able to petition
for their own page and set up their
own Her Campus site, filled with
articles written by the students
themselves.
"We decide what we want to
write about," Sendax said. "It still
feels very entrepreneurial, very
much our own thing. How we
brand our own branch is up to us
completely."
A visit to Stanford's Her Cam
pus page yields Palo Alto restau
rant reviews, down-lows on
Brazilian waxing and advice
columns about surviving Stanford
classes.
"We're probably most like
Glamour or Marie Claire, just in
the sense that we're more all
rounded than the average fashion
magazine," said Allison Otis 'l4,
the campus correspondent for
Stanford.
Students can find information
that is of interest and pertains to
them, including fashion tips, long
distance relationship advice and
resume help.
"It's very much tailored to be
relevant to the average teenager,"
said Wilson, the founding content
editor.

The Stanford branch only offi
cially launched this past February.
With a total staff of about 20 stu
dents, Stanford's branch of Her
Campus is still very much in its
early stages.

The team has faced several
challenges promoting the publica
tion on campus.
"The idea of being girly is not
very popular at Stanford," Wilson
said. "Whenever I wear a dress,
people always look at me funny
and ask where I'm going."
Otis agreed, describing
lifestyle as "an untapped outlet on
campus."
Her Campus also appeals to
students interested in entering the
publications industry. Working for
the online magazine not only pro
vides hands-on experience, but it
also gives students networking
opportunities.
"Her Campus is so well-situat
ed with all these other partners,"
Sendax said. "We get all these
emails about opportunities to in
tern at Vogue, Harper's Bazaar,
NBC, MTV ... so many possibili
ties just open up."
For some students at Stanford,
women's lifestyle magazines are
seen as trivial entertainment.
However, for a certain group of
writers, working for Her Campus
offers a fun way to tap into inter
ests that otherwise go unnoticed.
When asked about the role that
such publications play, Otis
laughed.
"A lot of people don't see the
value in such publications. But in
all honesty, writing for Her Cam
pus is just plain fun," she said.
