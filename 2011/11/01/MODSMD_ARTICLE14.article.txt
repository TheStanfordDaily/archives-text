# OPINIONS
## I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE All grown up 
### Camira Powell 
I've always felt that my youthful
appearance belies my true age of
25. I've been 25 years old since I
was at least 18, feeling on the
"growner" side of things for a while.
Back when "House" was just a game
in which kids pretended to be in a
faraway adult world, I always played
the mom or cool older sister. I found
it to be an indication of my innate
maturity despite being the youngest
of my friends (or of the fact that I
was bossy and enjoyed telling peo
ple what to do). Even in high school,
some of the best Friday nights in
volved fancy dinners with friends
before going salsa dancing at a place
where we were the youngest people
in the building (young meaning
under 60).
Being underage anywhere is a
hard life, but there's something
about D.C. that makes it extra
rough. Every night I dream about
my 21st birthday. Many of my peers
imagine going on a 24-hour bender
in Vegas, hitting up every neon-lit
club in sight. That would be
awesome, but it's not my style. Hon
estly, my fantasies are of a classy
lounge where I can sit and sip
leisurely in the company of like
minded intellectuals.
It's not as though I don't like to
have fun. I do. I love to function as
much as any college kid I'm
nowhere near an unsocial introvert
I just have grown-person sensi
bilities. At times, I have to push my
self to do the "college" thing to live
up to the expectations set forth in
great films like "Drumline" and
"Animal House," Yet if I'm given the
option of attending a pulsating, hot
box house party or a chill, unpreten
tious kickback, the kickback wins.
So what am I missing? If I've been
in my 20s for the last five years, what
happens when I actually turn 21?
When I'm 25, will I have a midlife cri
sis like a 40-year-old? When I'm 30,
does that mean I'll be an old maid
ready to throw in the towel?
I realize that all of these concerns
are irrelevant to anyone's life (in
cluding my own) and prime exam
ples of #firstworldproblems. How
ever, they do make me worry about
everyone else. There are a ton of ar
ticles saying that today's youth are
staying dependent longer, but on the
flipside, you have kids maturing
faster than ever. Why is my six-year
old cousin's schedule fuller than
mine? And it doesn't help that he
can teach me how to properly use
the new iPhone. A generation ago,
typical 25-year-olds would be mar
ried with kids, working at the same
company they would one day retire
from, but that's not so true anymore.
Now typical 25-year-olds are occu
pying somebody's couch because
they can't find a job if they're not in
school adding on higher-level de
grees with higher levels of debt, or

part of the handful of new (Stan
ford) graduates actually working.
It's a role reversal, like a Ben
jamin Button-esque transformation
on the inside. The older you get, the
younger you feel and vice-versa.
People are always saying how they
feel better in their 40s than they did
in their 20s, and maybe it's because
at 20, they felt like they were 50.

There's a difference between
being grown, mature and old all
of which are simply states of mind.
Old is all about experience, being
around long enough to reminisce
about the way things used to be. Ma
ture means you're established, ex
uding a sense of capability that
comes with being responsible and
reliable. Grown connotes the exis
tence of something that resembles
potential; it's the promise of that
next stage in life beyond rolling
around and being unsure of what
happens next (you may not know
the answers, but you're closer to
finding them.)
When they play their cards cor
rectly, grown folks do have the best
of both worlds. If they graduated in
'O-anything or below, they can't hit
up a party thrown by someone in the
class of 'l4. That's not a good look.
However, they can throw their own
soiree in the house they own (hope
fully in area without noise com
plaint worries) with age-appropri
ate peeps. Then, when they get tired
of jamming to old school Destiny's
Child, collegiate Kanye and classic
Missy, they can slow things down
with no shame because they've
already gone hard in the paint.
I realize there are some perils to
being all growed up and I'm mature
enough to admit that I'm not old
enough to handle them. So for now
I'll just work on embracing my
actual age until I'm actually 25.

There's a difference
between being
grown, mature
and old.

I've always felt that my youthful
appearance belies my true age of
25. I've been 25 years old since I
was at least 18, feeling on the
"growner" side of things for a while.
Back when "House" was just a game
in which kids pretended to be in a
faraway adult world, I always played
the mom or cool older sister. I found
it to be an indication of my innate
maturity despite being the youngest
of my friends (or of the fact that I
was bossy and enjoyed telling peo
ple what to do). Even in high school,
some of the best Friday nights in
volved fancy dinners with friends
before going salsa dancing at a place
where we were the youngest people
in the building (young meaning
under 60).
Being underage anywhere is a
hard life, but there's something
about D.C. that makes it extra
rough. Every night I dream about
my 21st birthday. Many of my peers
imagine going on a 24-hour bender
in Vegas, hitting up every neon-lit
club in sight. That would be
awesome, but it's not my style. Hon
estly, my fantasies are of a classy
lounge where I can sit and sip
leisurely in the company of like
minded intellectuals.
It's not as though I don't like to
have fun. I do. I love to function as
much as any college kid I'm
nowhere near an unsocial introvert
I just have grown-person sensi
bilities. At times, I have to push my
self to do the "college" thing to live
up to the expectations set forth in
great films like "Drumline" and
"Animal House," Yet if I'm given the
option of attending a pulsating, hot
box house party or a chill, unpreten
tious kickback, the kickback wins.
So what am I missing? If I've been
in my 20s for the last five years, what
happens when I actually turn 21?
When I'm 25, will I have a midlife cri
sis like a 40-year-old? When I'm 30,
does that mean I'll be an old maid
ready to throw in the towel?
I realize that all of these concerns
are irrelevant to anyone's life (in
cluding my own) and prime exam
ples of #firstworldproblems. How
ever, they do make me worry about
everyone else. There are a ton of ar
ticles saying that today's youth are
staying dependent longer, but on the
flipside, you have kids maturing
faster than ever. Why is my six-year
old cousin's schedule fuller than
mine? And it doesn't help that he
can teach me how to properly use
the new iPhone. A generation ago,
typical 25-year-olds would be mar
ried with kids, working at the same
company they would one day retire
from, but that's not so true anymore.
Now typical 25-year-olds are occu
pying somebody's couch because
they can't find a job if they're not in
school adding on higher-level de
grees with higher levels of debt, or

part of the handful of new (Stan
ford) graduates actually working.
It's a role reversal, like a Ben
jamin Button-esque transformation
on the inside. The older you get, the
younger you feel and vice-versa.
People are always saying how they
feel better in their 40s than they did
in their 20s, and maybe it's because
at 20, they felt like they were 50.

There's a difference between
being grown, mature and old all
of which are simply states of mind.
Old is all about experience, being
around long enough to reminisce
about the way things used to be. Ma
ture means you're established, ex
uding a sense of capability that
comes with being responsible and
reliable. Grown connotes the exis
tence of something that resembles
potential; it's the promise of that
next stage in life beyond rolling
around and being unsure of what
happens next (you may not know
the answers, but you're closer to
finding them.)
When they play their cards cor
rectly, grown folks do have the best
of both worlds. If they graduated in
'O-anything or below, they can't hit
up a party thrown by someone in the
class of 'l4. That's not a good look.
However, they can throw their own
soiree in the house they own (hope
fully in area without noise com
plaint worries) with age-appropri
ate peeps. Then, when they get tired
of jamming to old school Destiny's
Child, collegiate Kanye and classic
Missy, they can slow things down
with no shame because they've
already gone hard in the paint.
I realize there are some perils to
being all growed up and I'm mature
enough to admit that I'm not old
enough to handle them. So for now
I'll just work on embracing my
actual age until I'm actually 25.
