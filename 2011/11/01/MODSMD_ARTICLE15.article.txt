In defense of
Stanford Cheer

Dear Editor,
In response to Glenn Truitt's
Op-ed piece ("Cheer leaving," Oct,
26), I say it is ludicrous to suggest
Stanford cheerleaders should not
be allowed on the field.
I feel insulted that I have to
defend my team's good name after
an accident occurs. I will be the first
to admit that what happened dur
ing the Washington game was an
unfortunate mishap. However, in
light of Mr. Truitt's hyperbolic
criticism and serious misinterpreta
tions, I am impelled to respond to
his accusations.
Let me first clear the air. The
flier who fell on television did not
injure herself, and the girls below
her did everything to cradle her
safely. They have all been properly
trained to cradle stunts, and they
actually did prevent the athlete's
head from hitting the ground. I do
not wish to trivialize the issue of
safety in cheerleading, but the flier
in the video was not at risk. Mr. Tru
itt's inflammatory rhetoric is
unnecessary in this regard.
I also take offense to Mr. Truitt's
comments about the physicality
and ability of my team. Contrary to
Mr. Truitt's belief, since Stanford
Cheer became a staple of the side
line entertainment six years ago, we
have consistently improved our
technique and ability. We are dedi
cated and legitimate. The stunt that
fell on Saturday was the only stunt
that fell during that game. And al
though that happened to be the
stunt that was televised, it should in
no way reflect the talent of the
team. All teams, even Oregon, Ari
zona and Washington State, have

dropped stunts at games, and the
fact that we did so while on
television is unlucky, nothing more.
While it is true we go to an
amazing school that prides itself in
its students' prowess both academ
ically and athletically, we also pride
ourselves on our unparalleled de
votion to individuality, diversity
and acceptance. That is why one
would be hard pressed to find a
student who is upset over the fact
that Stanford does not have a "tra
ditional" marching band. Instead,
we have a band that is creative,
goofy and unique. We love them for
being unconventional. Mr. Truitt
wrote that Stanford students want
spirit groups that conform to those
of all other Pac-12 schools, which
simply is not Stanford's style.
I admit that we are not the most
talented of cheer teams in the Pac
-12. There, I said it. However, we are
indubitably the most multifarious
and well-rounded. My teammates
are diverse in terms of their race and
body type, not to mention their reli
gion, sexual orientation, socioeco
nomic status and academic inter
ests. I firmly believe that our team
plays a role in ending the stigma
against cheerleaders that they are
all skinny and perfectly spray
tanned. And, in a larger sense, I as
sert that we are combating norms
about beauty in general. Every one
of my teammates is gorgeous and
more importantly proud of the way
he or she looks, and we should be
promoting that ideology and not
saying that anyone looks out of
shape. By advocating tolerance and
diversity, I would say that my team is
a perfect representation of Stanford
and deserves a place on the field.
