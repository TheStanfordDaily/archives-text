# THE YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## The art of losing myself
### Nina Chung 
I won the same yearbook award
at the end of both middle school
and high school: The Most Like
ly to Brighten Your Day Award. I
don't even remember being partic
ularly surprised the second time.
Through those years and onward, I
also became accustomed to certain
related qualities that kept popping
up when people described me and
when I described myself. That
award was only part of a set of expe
riences that gradually convinced me
I had to be the one who would
brighten your day: the happy one,
the cute one, the constantly excited
one, the open one, the clever one. I
had to be laughing and smiling all
the time. I had to be jumpy, unpre
dictable and entertaining, ever the
immaculate extrovert. And I knew
this was how people saw me.
Wait, I'll be honest I didn't
just know it, I was constantly aware
. . . and burning myself out as I
played the identity game to a tee. It
was a new kind of selfishness, one
that has nothing to do with money
or material or sharing. But I can't
think of any word but "selfish" to
describe the self-obsession I fed as I
constantly strategized how best to
fulfill who I was expected to be.
I don't mean to be presumptu
ous, but I don't think I'm the only
one. Expectations surround us like
air unseen, unspoken and unbe
lievably heavy. There is, for exam
ple, the collective freshman concep
tion that not attending a frat party is
a social code violation. But not all
freshmen enjoy frat parties, and
that's a fact. Unfortunately, it takes

many of us a relatively long time to
realize that our entire social lives
for the next four years are actually
not affected by non-attendance.
Great news! Still, the expectation
exists, ready to trap students and
steal their weekends. And secretly
unwilling students will continue to
go, thinking that they need to be
"social," if that's how they choose to
define it.

The outside expectations by
which we judge ourselves are thus
often self-imposed. No doubt they
stress us out. Yet we tend to place
values on ourselves through our
success or failure in fulfilling them.
We have to become a household
name after graduating because
that's what our family thinks is suc
cess. We have to be environmental
ly sustainable because that's what a
good global citizen is. We have to be
constantly conversational because

otherwise we're being "antisocial"
(which has apparently become a
minor crime). Or we have to be the
funny/intellectual/organized/non
chalant/insightful one among our
friends, even if we've outgrown the
title and it's starting to get tiresome.
The truth is that none of these
things are bad in and of themselves;
it's just that none of them are very
good, either. No matter how much
security we feel inside these con
venient little shoeboxes, fitting in
side them doesn't make us any
more worthwhile as people or
friends or family members. I believe
that they're not inherently valuable.
Of course, though, it feels
unimaginably risky to step outside

those bounds. At least, that's how I
felt. I used to be afraid that some
one would catch a glimpse of me
when I wasn't bright and bouncy be
cause I was afraid they'd realize I
was boring. Then I would be lost to
myself, too ... and that scared me
more than anything. I suppose it
was just around two years ago that I
met someone who saw that side of
me . . . and was still completely
crazy about me. Seriously, it was
completely disorienting at first. I
mean, how often do we not have to
live up to a single thing and still get
to be loved? But I learned that it
was more than okay, really, not to
meet others' standards. And that
was liberation, pure and simple.
I was recently talking about that
exact relationship with another
friend of mine, who said this about
"knowing" me before I had chosen
into it: "Don't get me wrong, I totally
thought you were super nice and
bubbly and everything, but, like, I
wondered who you actually were."
And it was amazingly refreshing to
finally hear it out loud because I
knew it was true of so many people
I've met. It's ironic, the way we dis
tance other people the more we inch
closer to what they expect of us.
It's too much strategy and too
much effort. If we can just lose all of
that, it's easier to meet the one who
still finds us valuable without us
making a single move.

Curious? Cautious? Critical? Don't
think just email Nina at ninamc
