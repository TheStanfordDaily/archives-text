## CONFERENCE CHAMPS AGAIN Seniors step up to clinch Pac-12 title 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
The seniors on the Cardinal
women's soccer team may be com
ing off two consecutive conference
championships, but as they demon
strated definitively last weekend,
their motivation still hasn't faltered.
And in clinching its third conference
title in a row, Stanford (18-0-1,10-0-0
Pac-12) needed its seniors more than
ever to come through in the clutch to
secure wins at Oregon State and
Oregon.

For the second consecutive
weekend, the No. 1 Cardinal was
propelled to victory by a two-goal
performance by a senior not
once, but twice with forward
Lindsay Taylor and midfielder Tere
sa Noyola each accounting for a pair
of scoring strikes against the
Beavers (12-5-1, 6-3-0) and Ducks
(8-9-2, 3-6-1), respectively. Taylor's
third consecutive two-goal game on
Friday put her season tally at 16,
double her total from just three
weeks ago, while Noyola is now ap
proaching her second consecutive
10-goal season.
All this, just months after a pre
season injury to junior Courtney
Verloo seemed to shift the scoring
burden to Stanford's youth. But de
spite the impressive play of fresh
man forward Chioma Übogagu and
others, the upperclassmen have been
the ones picking up the slack as of
late.
The pressure was on against No.
19 Oregon State, the Cardinal's final
obstacle to a conference title for the
second season in a row. Last year, a

third-minute goal by senior forward
Christen Press her first of two
on the night set the tone for a
hard-fought 2-0 Stanford victory to
clinch the Pac-10. This time around
it was the Beavers who got off to a
quick start, however, and a fourth
minute goal by sophomore forward
Jenna Richardson put the Cardinal
behind for just the second time this
season.

It took until the second half for
Stanford to respond, when Taylor
netted one of her characteristic
top-shelf goals from the top of the
penalty area in the 55th minute.
Just 11 minutes later, she added an
other from 16 yards out to put the
Cardinal ahead.
Stanford's work wasn't done
yet, though, in a rough and rainy
match that allowed the Cardinal to
substitute only four players a far
cry from the droves of alternates
who had seen playing time in less
tense victories. Sophomore goal
keeper Emily Oliver was forced to
make four saves, including one off an
early strike from senior midfielder
Ashley Seal that would have put the
Beavers up 2-0.
Withstanding the pressure, Stan
ford was able to secure its third
straight Pac-12 (or Pac-10) title, be
coming just the second school in con
ference history to do so. (UCLA
held at least a share of the title for six
straight years, from 2003-08, until the
Cardinal broke the streak.)
That realization might have
slowed Stanford down a little bit on
Sunday in Eugene, and while the
Cardinal got out of town with a com
fortable 2-0 victory, head coach Paul
Ratcliffe noted after the game that
the energy level may have been lack
ing. He had strong basis for his opin
ion: Stanford's total of eight shots
was the smallest output of the sea
son, with the previous low (12) com
ing against a stingy UCLA defense.
Half of the Cardinal's shots came
from Noyola, who benefited from a
long pass from junior defender Alina
Garciamendez Noyola's team

mate on Mexico's World Cup team
last summer —to set up a wide
open shot in the 14th minute. Noy
ola's second tally came early in the
second half on a high feed from jun
ior midfielder Mariah Nogueira, and
the senior also took Stanford's only
other shot of the second frame in the
64th minute.

The Cardinal can't afford anoth
er lull if it wants to close the season
on a high note, with the rivalry
matchup against California set for
Saturday. The No. 22 Bears (12-5-2,
5-3-2) fell to Oregon State but
played much more impressive soc
cer against the Ducks than Stanford
did, benefiting from a hat trick by

sophomore midfielder Kaitlyn Fitz
patrick.

The Cardinal and Bears will
meet at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium at
7 p.m. on Saturday in the regular
season finale.

on the night set the tone for a
hard-fought 2-0 Stanford victory to
clinch the Pac-10. This time around
it was the Beavers who got off to a
quick start, however, and a fourth
minute goal by sophomore forward
Jenna Richardson put the Cardinal
behind for just the second time this
season.

It took until the second half for
Stanford to respond, when Taylor
netted one of her characteristic
top-shelf goals from the top of the
penalty area in the 55th minute.
Just 11 minutes later, she added an
other from 16 yards out to put the
Cardinal ahead.
Stanford's work wasn't done
yet, though, in a rough and rainy
match that allowed the Cardinal to
substitute only four players a far
cry from the droves of alternates
who had seen playing time in less
tense victories. Sophomore goal
keeper Emily Oliver was forced to
make four saves, including one off an
early strike from senior midfielder
Ashley Seal that would have put the
Beavers up 2-0.
Withstanding the pressure, Stan
ford was able to secure its third
straight Pac-12 (or Pac-10) title, be
coming just the second school in con
ference history to do so. (UCLA
held at least a share of the title for six
straight years, from 2003-08, until the
Cardinal broke the streak.)
That realization might have
slowed Stanford down a little bit on
Sunday in Eugene, and while the
Cardinal got out of town with a com
fortable 2-0 victory, head coach Paul
Ratcliffe noted after the game that
the energy level may have been lack
ing. He had strong basis for his opin
ion: Stanford's total of eight shots
was the smallest output of the sea
son, with the previous low (12) com
ing against a stingy UCLA defense.
Half of the Cardinal's shots came
from Noyola, who benefited from a
long pass from junior defender Alina
Garciamendez Noyola's team

mate on Mexico's World Cup team
last summer —to set up a wide
open shot in the 14th minute. Noy
ola's second tally came early in the
second half on a high feed from jun
ior midfielder Mariah Nogueira, and
the senior also took Stanford's only
other shot of the second frame in the
64th minute.

The Cardinal can't afford anoth
er lull if it wants to close the season
on a high note, with the rivalry
matchup against California set for
Saturday. The No. 22 Bears (12-5-2,
5-3-2) fell to Oregon State but
played much more impressive soc
cer against the Ducks than Stanford
did, benefiting from a hat trick by

sophomore midfielder Kaitlyn Fitz
patrick.

The Cardinal and Bears will
meet at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium at
7 p.m. on Saturday in the regular
season finale.
