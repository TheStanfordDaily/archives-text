Jetlag did not factor into the No.
9 Stanford field hockey team's
biggest test to date, as it hit the road
this weekend to blank both Michi
gan State and No. 7 Michigan in a
pair of 3-0 shutouts. Erasing any lin
gering doubts about the legitimacy
of Stanford's impressive record in a
weak conference, the wins increase
the likelihood of the team receiving
an at-large bid should the team fall
in the upcoming NorPac Tourna
ment.

Opening Friday afternoon in
East Lansing, the Cardinal (15-2,6-
0 NorPac) soundly defeated a
Michigan State team (7-11,1-4 Big
Ten) whose offensive struggles will
most likely end its streak of four
consecutive appearances in the
NCAA Tournament. Five-time
NorPac Rookie of the Week attack
er Alex McCawley scored the first
goal of the game off an assist from
sophomore attacker Courtney
Haldeman to close the first period.
After the break, sophomore attack
er Hope Burke scored her seventh
goal of the season after converting a

pass from senior attacker Stephanie
Byrne. In the final five minutes of
the game, freshman midfielder
Shannon Herold scored her first ca
reer goal to ensure Stanford's 3-0
win.

With uncharacteristically sloppy
play in the circle by the Card, the
Spartans won the advantage in cor
ners, 10-6. None of those penalties
were converted to the back of the
goal, though, and redshirt senior
goalkeeper Ale Moss made six
saves. Offensively, Stanford outshot
Michigan State 19-12.
On Sunday the Cardinal offense
showed up ready to earn its first
ever win against the Wolverines and
did so in impressive fashion. Al
though Michigan outshot Stanford
19-5, the team could not find the
back of the goal. Burke scored first
off an assist from junior defender
Becky Dru as the final seconds of
the first quarter wound down.
Herold scored the second goal, with
Dru assisting again. The final goal
came from Dru, whose efforts al
lowed the Card to snap Michigan's
streak of eight consecutive home
wins and ruin yet another team's
Senior Day.
Dru surpassed her career best of
13 single-season goals and leads the
team with 14; it was the 40th of her
career. Moss had her best game of

Junior defender Becky Dru set a new career high with her 14th goal of the
