Jetlag did not factor into the No.
9 Stanford field hockey team's
biggest test to date, as it hit the road
this weekend to blank both Michi
gan State and No. 7 Michigan in a
pair of 3-0 shutouts. Erasing any lin
gering doubts about the legitimacy
of Stanford's impressive record in a
weak conference, the wins increase
the likelihood of the team receiving
an at-large bid should the team fall
in the upcoming NorPac Tourna
ment.

Opening Friday afternoon in
East Lansing, the Cardinal (15-2,6-
0 NorPac) soundly defeated a
Michigan State team (7-11,1-4 Big
Ten) whose offensive struggles will
most likely end its streak of four
consecutive appearances in the
NCAA Tournament. Five-time
NorPac Rookie of the Week attack
er Alex McCawley scored the first
goal of the game off an assist from
sophomore attacker Courtney
Haldeman to close the first period.
After the break, sophomore attack
er Hope Burke scored her seventh
goal of the season after converting a

pass from senior attacker Stephanie
Byrne. In the final five minutes of
the game, freshman midfielder
Shannon Herold scored her first ca
reer goal to ensure Stanford's 3-0
win.

With uncharacteristically sloppy
play in the circle by the Card, the
Spartans won the advantage in cor
ners, 10-6. None of those penalties
were converted to the back of the
goal, though, and redshirt senior
goalkeeper Ale Moss made six
saves. Offensively, Stanford outshot
Michigan State 19-12.
On Sunday the Cardinal offense
showed up ready to earn its first
ever win against the Wolverines and
did so in impressive fashion. Al
though Michigan outshot Stanford
19-5, the team could not find the
back of the goal. Burke scored first
off an assist from junior defender
Becky Dru as the final seconds of
the first quarter wound down.
Herold scored the second goal, with
Dru assisting again. The final goal
came from Dru, whose efforts al
lowed the Card to snap Michigan's
streak of eight consecutive home
wins and ruin yet another team's
Senior Day.
Dru surpassed her career best of
13 single-season goals and leads the
team with 14; it was the 40th of her
career. Moss had her best game of

the shutout despite Michigan's 10
corners.
The road trip provided the Car

dinal with even more momentum as
the postseason creeps closer. After
failing against ranked opponents on
the road early in the season, Stan
ford proved it is capable of winning
big games and did not look like the
same team that lost 4-2 at Connecti
cut and 6-3 at New Hampshire.
Stanford's offense and defense
both executed perfectly to secure

the game and shut out the Wolver
ines for only the second time this
season. The first came in the season
opener against No. 2 North Caroli
na in a 5-0 rout.
The Cardinal now needs only
three more wins to break the record
of 17 set by the 2009 team. Given
Stanford's perfect NorPac record
and history in the tournament, it is a

milestone well within reach.
"Of course, we want to win the
NorPac championship to gain an
automatic bid to the NCAA play-in
game and make our season last as
long as we can, but so do all of the
other teams in our conference,"
Burke said. "As of now, I think we
have put ourselves in a very good
position to make it into the 16-team

NCAA championship bracket. It's
now up to us to execute and make
those goals come true."
