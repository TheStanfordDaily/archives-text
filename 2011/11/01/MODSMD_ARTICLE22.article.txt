# Enjoy the undefeated ride
## 
### Tom Taylor 
It's almost 1 a.m. on Sunday
morning in L.A., and I'm ex
hausted. I have no Internet con
nection to fact-check and no cof
fee to help make my words co
herent. In theory this shouldn't be the
ideal time to start writing my column,
but what else can I do? Sleep?

I am sure by the time you are read
ing this that you already know what
just happened, that the Stanford foot
ball team defeated USC in the closest
of all close games only a few short
hours ago, but that doesn't do justice to
the scenes replaying in my head. I just
witnessed first-hand and confront
ed by an overwhelming majority of op
posing fans the greatest game of
college football, and perhaps even of
any sport, I have ever seen. As if you
need any proof, the friend I traveled
down here with, a far more knowl
edgeable football fan than I, could do
nothing more than sit in stunned si
lence for a long, long time after the
fumble that gave the win to Stanford.
Supporting any team is a risk. Un
less you pick that lucky year when
your team goes undefeated all the way
to a national title, you are going to have
to deal with defeat. Traveling to an
away game steps it up a notch: if you
lose you can't just slink home in
anonymity. You'll have to deal with the
taunting of a few tens of thousands of
happy enemy fans and face a long, de
pressing trip home.
As this was my first college football
away game, I knew it was going to be
special the minute I walked into the In-
N-Out Burger halfway to L.A. to be
greeted by a restaurant packed with
Cal fans. As the lone customer sporting
Stanford gear, the crowd immediately
turned on me, chanting, "Take off that
red shirt." I was the center of attention.
It was awesome. Fast-forward one day
and I was sitting in one of the largest
stadiums I've had the fortune to visit, a
former Olympic venue, a vast bowl dug
into the Southern California dirt and
packed with USC fans. In the tiniest of
tiny corners, the Red Zone was hud
dled together, outnumbered and out
gunned by the voices of so many Tro
jans giving everything they had.
This was a game Stanford was just
not destined to win. The Cardinal fell
behind for the first time all season in
the third quarter and many times after
that. Coming back from a 10-point
deficit looked tough, and squaring the
game after conceding an interception

for a touchdown with just three min
utes left looked impossible. When
Stanford tied the game and USC wast
ed its chance at a last-gasp field goal,
letting the clock run down to zero, the
Cardinal faithful went crazy. Some
how there was still a chance of taking
the victory.

And win Stanford did. More than
any of those 25-point-or-more victo
ries, perhaps this game was the test and
proof of a real national championship
contender. The best teams not only
win when life is going well; they some
how find away to secure victory when
it's not.

Everyone I know, many Cardinal
fans among them, is looking for rea
sons to rule Stanford out of a possible
national title run, and there are
enough out there: a struggling defense,
the game against Oregon, a so-far un
beaten Oklahoma State, and even
Boise State's perennial demands to be
given that shot. In fact, I sometimes get
the feeling that because we are so sure
that disappointment is going to come
at some point, fans would rather get a
defeat over and done with instead of
stringing out their hopes.
But hopes and dreams are what
sports are all about. We have to re
member where we are: this is Stanford.
We shouldn't even be in this position;
everyone knows that. My aforemen
tioned friend even admitted before
the game that he had previously con
sidered going to USC instead of the
Farm because it would have been pret
ty cool to go to a football school. Even
to still be in the conversation this late
in the season is massive, and some
thing to be celebrated. But more than
that, this is the chance. There hasn't
been a new national champion since
Colorado in 1990, and the last time
Stanford had the top pick in the NFL
Draft was with John Elway in 1983. For
schools like this one, these things don't
come around again very often.
So maybe it's time to throw caution
to the wind. You might never again get
the opportunity to believe Stanford
has any shot at a national title, so in
dulge your fantasies while you can.
When the defeat comes it will be
crushing, but for a few short weeks
you'll be living the dream.
Maybe, just maybe, this could real
ly happen.
