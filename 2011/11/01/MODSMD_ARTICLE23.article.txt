## Football news and notes 
### â€” Jacob Jaffe 
Saturday was a busy day for Stan
ford football on the field, and Monday
was a busy day off it.
The Cardinal, fresh off its triple
overtime victory at USC, was named
the National Team of the Week by the
Football Writers Association of Amer
ica. It marks the third time Stanford
has ever received the honor each
time on the weekend of a Cardinal vic
tory at USC. The 2007 game was
termed the "Biggest Upset Ever"
when the 41-point underdog Cardinal
shocked No. 1 USC. In 2009, Stanford
set a Los Angeles Coliseum record
with 55 points in a rout of the Trojans,
known for the "What's your deal?"
moment between then-head coaches
Jim Harbaugh and Pete Carroll. On
Saturday, the Cardinal broke that scor
ing record in a 56-48 thriller to keep
the team undefeated.

Additionally, redshirt sophomore
kicker Eric Whitaker was named Pac
-12 Special Teams Player of the Week.
In his first career start, Whitaker made
both of his field goal attempts and all
six of his extra point attempts in a
game where every point mattered.
Filling in for an injured Jordan
Williamson, Whitaker straggled with

kickoffs, placing two out of bounds,but
he booted one deep in the final minute
of regulation to give USC a longer
field.

Stanford also released an injury up
date on redshirt sophomore tight end
Zach Ertz.The release announced that
Ertz has a "lower leg" injury and will
miss at least two weeks. Ertz sustained
the injury on the opening kickoff
against USC and stood on the sideline
on crutches with a brace on his leg for
the rest of the game.
After this Saturday's road game
against 2-6 Oregon State, the Cardinal
will return home for its most anticipat
ed game of the season, Nov. 12 against
Oregon. Stanford announced that the
Oregon contest, a rematch of the Car
dinal's lone loss in 2010, will take place
at 5 p.m. and be aired on ABC.
Although Ertz is expected to miss
this game, the status of other injured
Stanford players such as
Williamson, senior safety Delano
Howell, senior wide receiver Chris
Owusu and redshirt freshman tackle
Cameron Fleming remains un
known.

Stanford will take on Oregon State
in Corvallis, Ore., on Saturday at 12:30
p.m.
