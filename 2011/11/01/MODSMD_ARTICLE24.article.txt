# CARD CANT CATCH USC
## 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team was doomed by another
slow start this Saturday against No.
2 USC in Los Angeles. The final
score was 8-4, but after falling be
hind 3-0 in the first quarter and 5-1
at halftime, Stanford (14-4, 3-2
MPSF) was never really in the
game.

Falling behind early has become
a troubling trend for the Cardinal,
which had taken two-goal deficits
into halftime in each of its previous
three Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) games. In each of
those games, Stanford tied the score
in the second half, and the Cardinal
eventually went on to win two of
them.
USC (15-2, 5-0 MPSF) proved
too tough to come back on, though,
as the Trojans pounced early and did
not let the Cardinal back into the
game.

"We had opportunities to con
vert early, but we didn't, and we fell
into a hole," said senior utility Peter
Sefton.

Part of Stanford's inability to con
vert had to do with USC goalie Joel
Dennerly, who finished the day with
14 saves. He leads a USC defense
that tops the MPSF in total goals
against and goals against per game.
Freshman utility Alex Bowen
was the only Stanford player with
any real success against that de
fense. He finished the game with
three goals, while Sefton accounted
for the fourth. The four-goal output
was the lowest of the season for
Stanford.
Stanford was even with USC in
the second half, as each team scored
three goals, but that is little consola
tion for a team that wants to knock
off the defending champion Trojans.

Stanford now falls into fourth
place in the MPSF standings, while
USC will remain in first place with
an undefeated conference record.
Also ahead of Stanford in the stand
ings are No. 1 UCLA and No. 4 Cal
ifornia, each of which has one con
ference loss and three losses overall.

While USC seems to be running
away from the pack, there is not
much space between the next three
teams. In order to make the four
team NCAA Tournament and have
a chance at the national champi
onship, Stanford has to either win
the MPSF Tournament or receive
the one at-large bid.
"USC is clearly the favorite, but

if they win the MPSF Tournament,
the at-large bid is up for grabs,"
Sefton said.
Stanford has a chance to bolster
its resume when it plays Cal in its
regular season finale. The team can
also expect to face two of the top
four teams in the MPSF Tourna
ment.

None of the top four nationally
ranked teams (UCLA, USC, Stan
ford and California) has lost to a
team ranked fifth or worse. With
that in mind, Stanford knows it can
not lose any games against lower
ranked teams if it wants to have a
chance at the at-large bid.
"We just have to get re-focused
and ready for the last couple of
weeks of the season," Sefton said.
"We will get another chance against
all these guys in the MPSF Tourna
ment."
