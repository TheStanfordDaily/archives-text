# Flipside unveils fees Segway
## Controversial purchase debuts at 'Flipside Fridays' 
### MELODY WONG 
The Flipside debuted its controversial Segway in
White Plaza last Friday, bookending a campaign
marked by a series of debates last spring when the
group petitioned for about $7,000 of ASSU special
fees to fund the purchase.

The group said it plans to bring the Segway to
White Plaza each week to give students and readers a
chance to try it out, as part of a weekly event called
"Flipside Fridays."

The Flipside, a satirical weekly campus publica
tion, claims to have been partly serious but mainly
facetious in its request for special fees to purchase a
Segway. The group hoped to draw student voter atten
tion to the special fees budget proposals on the ballot
last spring, as well as flaws in the special fees process
as a whole.

According to Jeremy Keeshin 'l2, Flipside presi
dent, "The best message you can make as a joke is ac
tually doing the thing you're making fun of."
Each year, certain eligible student groups are allot
ted ASSU funding from general fees collected from
all students. Qualifying groups can petition for stu
dents to vote to grant them a special fee collected di
rectly from students each quarter.
Special fees petitions require the signatures of 10
to 15 percent of the student body and, if placed on the
ballot, approval by a majority of voters, which must
constitute at least 15 percent of eligible voters. The
Daily currently receives special fees.
Amid much controversy and debate, the Flipside's
budget proposal passed last April with 69 percent of
the vote, which roughly translated to 32 percent of the
undergraduate population as a whole, thereby meet
ing the ASSU requirements.
The Flipside proceeded with its purchase of a Seg
way, which the group said it currently uses for distri
bution purposes in addition to Friday entertainment.
Whether or not the Flipside's Segway campaign
and the ensuing debate have inspired changes to the
special fees process remains to be seen. ASSU Senate
Chair Rafael Vazquez 'l2 did not respond for com
ment in time for publication.
"Any reform of the system has to go through the
ASSU governing body, the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council," said current
ASSU Elections Commissioner and Flipside
managing editor Adam Adler 'l2.
An ASSU Commission on the Govern
ing Documents is "basically trying to re
structure everything," Adler added.
Not all students appreciated the humor
ous manner the Flipside employed to illus
trate its point. Some students voiced their
displeasure at what they deemed the Flip
side's wasteful spending. A few accused the
Flipside of exploiting the loopholes of the very
system it was trying to expose.
However, not everyone opposed the Flip
side's choice of method to reveal the flaws of the
current special fees system.
"The Flipside has exposed some problems with
the special fees system in that even when you're re
questing a Segway, you can still get approved by the stu
dent body. And it shows that the student body doesn't
really read what's in those proposals," said Adam Klein
'l3. "The Flipside operates through comedy. Like 'The
Daily Show with Jon Stewart,' they use comedy to ex
pose issues in the real world. In this case, the Stanford
world."
Whether or not the Flipside's statement was suc
cessful may be debatable. Despite the mixed re
sponses concerning the purchase, for the Flipside
staff, purchasing a Segway accomplished its desired
effect.
"A lot of people did start talking about it,"
Keeshin said. "You can read articles, you can read
opinions on both sides. But whether or not you agree,
the fact that we have it, it's pretty clear that we got peo
ple talking. And that's one of our main messages."
