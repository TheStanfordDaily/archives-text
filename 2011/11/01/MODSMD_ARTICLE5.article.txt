## Pay Scale ranks Stanford salaries ninth Average starting salary for graduates around $58,000 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
Stanford graduates ranked ninth for median
starting salary and 16th for median mid-career
salary in national university rankings released by
Pay Scale on Oct. 24.
Pay Scale, an online resource for employers

and potential employees, compiles global re
search about compensation. The company seeks
to enable workers to assess their potential salaries
with respect to their skills, education and experi
ence. The company, created in 2002, claims to hold
the largest collection of online compensation data
in the world.
"I thought Stanford did pretty well in the sur
vey," said Stanford Career Development Center
(CDC) Director Lance Choy in an email to The
Daily.
Choy said he is unsure what meaning to attrib

ute to the ranking and asked, "[Does this reflect]
something about the quality of the school? About
the impact the alumni have on society? About the
number of alumni who pursue public service op
portunities?"

Choy noted that this was the first attempt that
he had ever seen to compare the starting and mid
career salaries of alumni from different schools.
He said that Pay Scale, like all rating systems, has
problems specific to its methodology.
When the CDC conducted a sim
ilar survey of 2010-2011 graduates
across disciplines, with 303 recorded
respondents, its results were lower
than those predicted by Pay Scale's
ranges. The most dramatic discrep
ancy was between graduates holding
a bachelor's degree in biology.
Pay Scale's upper limit was $124,519
greater than that reported in the
Stanford survey.
Stanford reported an average
starting salary of $54,951 for stu
dents graduating with bachelor's de
grees in the humanities and sciences,
with $72,148 as the average starting
salary for students graduating with
bachelor's degrees in engineering.

Pay Scale's results for 2011 cal
culated the average Stanford grad
uate's starting salary at $58,200
across all disciplines. The Universi
ty ranked 16th, behind the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology,
the California Institute of Technol
ogy (Caltech) and Loma Linda
University, which placed in the top
three spots, respectively. The medi
an mid-career salary of Stanford
alumni is estimated at $112,000, in
ninth place behind Princeton Uni
versity, Caltech and Harvey Mudd
College.
"I suspect that Stanford has a lot
of alumni who have started compa
nies, sold them and moved on to
other things," Choy said in reference
to those graduates who are not rep
resented in these studies. "Are entre
preneurs likely to participate in this
survey? Does the survey measure
accumulated wealth, not just in
come?"

In examining the salaries of em
ployees, Payscale did not consider
stock compensation, retirement
benefits and other non-cash bene
fits. Pay Scale defined starting em
ployees as those who have five years,
or fewer than five years, of experi
ence and who hold no more than a
bachelor's degree. A mid-career em
ployee is a full-time worker with at
least 10 years of experience in a sin
gle field, also holding no more than a
bachelor's degree. Along with these
factors, Pay Scale must take into ac
count the fact that its data is self-re
ported by those who chose to take
the Pay Scale employee survey.
"In general, the main trend we've
seen in our college salary data is that
pay is going down over time," said
Katie Bardaro, lead research analyst
for Pay Scale, in an email to The
Daily. "Pay for the top 20 schools fell
2.8 percent from last year and over 5
percent from 2008 (the first report).
This same trend exists for Stanford,
but to a lesser degree."
Other sites, however, report sig
nificantly different statistics for
Stanford and its peers. Forbes
ranked schools based on alumni
salaries predicted by student aca
demic backgrounds in a 2010 study.
Stanford ranked third behind
Williams College and Dartmouth
College, despite Forbes's use of
Pay Scale to determine average
salaries.

"Our top three schools would top
any ranking based on alumni earn
ings, even without controlling for
background," Forbes posted on its

website.
A report from CNBC entitled
"Colleges That Bring the Flighest
Paycheck 2011" also ranked Stan
ford ninth, sporting the exact same
figures that Pay Scale collected.
While other rankings refer to
Pay Scale's data, Choy noted that the
numbers are just that numbers.
He asked, "Does this reflect happier,
more satisfied alumni?"
