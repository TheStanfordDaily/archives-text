## Pay Scale ranks Stanford salaries ninth Average starting salary for graduates around $58,000 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
Stanford graduates ranked ninth for median
starting salary and 16th for median mid-career
salary in national university rankings released by
Pay Scale on Oct. 24.
Pay Scale, an online resource for employers

and potential employees, compiles global re
search about compensation. The company seeks
to enable workers to assess their potential salaries
with respect to their skills, education and experi
ence. The company, created in 2002, claims to hold
the largest collection of online compensation data
in the world.
"I thought Stanford did pretty well in the sur
vey," said Stanford Career Development Center
(CDC) Director Lance Choy in an email to The
Daily.
Choy said he is unsure what meaning to attrib

ute to the ranking and asked, "[Does this reflect]
something about the quality of the school? About
the impact the alumni have on society? About the
number of alumni who pursue public service op
portunities?"

Choy noted that this was the first attempt that
he had ever seen to compare the starting and mid
career salaries of alumni from different schools.
He said that Pay Scale, like all rating systems, has
problems specific to its methodology.
