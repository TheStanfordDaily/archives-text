## Wells Fargo holds onto EPA housing 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
Amid community com
plaints and despite reports that
the transaction would happen
in mid to late October, Wells
Fargo has yet to sell its 1,800
East Palo Alto apartments to
Equity Residential.
The apartments, located in
the Woodland Park neighbor
hood, represent about 60 per
cent of the city's affordable
housing. Wells Fargo took own
ership of the property in Au
gust 2009 when the previous
owner. Page Mills, defaulted on
a $5O million loan.

When reports of discussions
between Wells Fargo and Equi
ty Residential (EQR), a Chica
go-based firm with over
120,000 apartments in its port
folio, emerged in August, the
transaction immediately be
came a hotbed of controversy
in East Palo Alto.

Still recovering from the
Page Mills default and eager to
keep housing prices low, much
of the East Palo Alto commu
nity has been fervently op
posed to a single landlord con
trolling all 1,800 properties,
particularly a large national
company that may intend to
raise prices.

Some residents fear a repeat
of the properties' history. Page
Mills, which bought the 1,800
apartments in 101 buildings in
2006, angered the community
by dramatically raising prices,
evicting over 400 families, re
sisting the city's rent-control
ordinance and initiating about
a dozen lawsuits against the
city.

City leadership is concerned
about the loss of affordable
housing that may result from
EQR's possession. Mayor Car-
Los Romero, U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo,
D-Palo Alto, and the East Palo Alto
City Council have all written letters
to Wells Fargo asking them to delay
the sale and ensure compliance with
city needs.

In a protest of over 100 people
on Aug. 22, many voiced their frus
tration that the apartments were
being aggregated rather than split
among multiple buyers. Such vast
ownership, particularly by a group
with deep pockets and national in
fluence, would give EQR leverage
over other housing in East Palo
Alto.

Others worry about EQR oppos
ing the city's rent-control policy.
Sam Zell, the company's chair, has a
history of challenging rent-control
laws; Zell was a key supporter of
Proposition 98, a California bill that
would have repealed rent control,
and has filed several lawsuits to re
peal rent-control ordinances in Cal
ifornia cities. At the August rally,
protesters chanted "Don't Sell to
Zell!"

"We ask that... the owner com
mit in writing to complying with the
Rent Stabilization and Just Cause
for Eviction Ordinance," said Carol
Lamont, the program manager for
EPA's rent stabilization program.
The rent-control policy pro
hibits landlords from raising the
rent on an occupied apartment
more than once annually and by
more than 80 percent of the rise in
consumer price index for rental
units in the area.

Rent-control legislation is very
important for East Palo Alto, a town
bounded by the richer communities
of Silicon Valley. The town has re-af
firmed rent control six times, most
recently in 2010 by 79.6 percent. A
loss or violation of rent control

could mean the displacement of
thousands of families who have
nowhere else to look.

"We're looking at investment op
portunity development opportu
nities relative to what acquisition
opportunities are in those individual
markets," David Neithercut, CEO
and president of EQR, said during
Equity Residential's 2011 Earnings
Call on Oct. 27, recorded and tran
scribed publicly.

When asked whether or not
EQR considered the portfolio pri
marily a development opportunity
or a "more B-quality asset," Neither
cut said EQR thinks about the port
folio as "workforce housing."
Workforce housing is generally
understood to connote affordable,
high-quality housing.

Neithercut said that EQR wants
"to add assets on the Peninsula" and
"if it can be done at the right price,
[the EPA purchase] will represent a
good opportunity to do so."

The city has asked that Wells
Fargo wait until the new registration
process, a result of the revised rent
control ordinance, has been com
pleted so that it can ensure that fu
ture rent increases are consistent
with city laws.

Earlier reports, including a re
sponse from Wells Fargo, claimed
that the sale would be concluded in
mid to late October, yet the apart
ments have not been sold. This may
indicate that Wells Fargo is heeding
the city's request to wait until the
registration process is complete.
"We're continuing to work on
[buying the East Palo Alto proper
ties]," Neithercut said. "And we do
have an expectation that we could
close on that this year, but nothing is
certain at the present time."
Elise Wilkinson, a Wells Fargo
media spokesperson, said that
"EQR is still conducting due dili
gence on the property."

of the East Palo Alto commu
nity has been fervently op
posed to a single landlord con
trolling all 1,800 properties,
particularly a large national
company that may intend to
raise prices.

Some residents fear a repeat
of the properties' history. Page
Mills, which bought the 1,800
apartments in 101 buildings in
2006, angered the community
by dramatically raising prices,
evicting over 400 families, re
sisting the city's rent-control
ordinance and initiating about
a dozen lawsuits against the
city.

City leadership is concerned
about the loss of affordable
housing that may result from
EQR's possession. Mayor Car-
Los Romero, U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo,
D-Palo Alto, and the East Palo Alto
City Council have all written letters
to Wells Fargo asking them to delay
the sale and ensure compliance with
city needs.

In a protest of over 100 people
on Aug. 22, many voiced their frus
tration that the apartments were
being aggregated rather than split
among multiple buyers. Such vast
ownership, particularly by a group
with deep pockets and national in
fluence, would give EQR leverage
over other housing in East Palo
Alto.

Others worry about EQR oppos
ing the city's rent-control policy.
Sam Zell, the company's chair, has a
history of challenging rent-control
laws; Zell was a key supporter of
Proposition 98, a California bill that
would have repealed rent control,
and has filed several lawsuits to re
peal rent-control ordinances in Cal
ifornia cities. At the August rally,
protesters chanted "Don't Sell to
Zell!"

"We ask that... the owner com
mit in writing to complying with the
Rent Stabilization and Just Cause
for Eviction Ordinance," said Carol
Lamont, the program manager for
EPA's rent stabilization program.
The rent-control policy pro
hibits landlords from raising the
rent on an occupied apartment
more than once annually and by
more than 80 percent of the rise in
consumer price index for rental
units in the area.

Rent-control legislation is very
important for East Palo Alto, a town
bounded by the richer communities
of Silicon Valley. The town has re-af
firmed rent control six times, most
recently in 2010 by 79.6 percent. A
loss or violation of rent control

could mean the displacement of
thousands of families who have
nowhere else to look.

"We're looking at investment op
portunity development opportu
nities relative to what acquisition
opportunities are in those individual
markets," David Neithercut, CEO
and president of EQR, said during
Equity Residential's 2011 Earnings
Call on Oct. 27, recorded and tran
scribed publicly.

When asked whether or not
EQR considered the portfolio pri
marily a development opportunity
or a "more B-quality asset," Neither
cut said EQR thinks about the port
folio as "workforce housing."
Workforce housing is generally
understood to connote affordable,
high-quality housing.

Neithercut said that EQR wants
"to add assets on the Peninsula" and
"if it can be done at the right price,
[the EPA purchase] will represent a
good opportunity to do so."

The city has asked that Wells
Fargo wait until the new registration
process, a result of the revised rent
control ordinance, has been com
pleted so that it can ensure that fu
ture rent increases are consistent
with city laws.

Earlier reports, including a re
sponse from Wells Fargo, claimed
that the sale would be concluded in
mid to late October, yet the apart
ments have not been sold. This may
indicate that Wells Fargo is heeding
the city's request to wait until the
registration process is complete.
"We're continuing to work on
[buying the East Palo Alto proper
ties]," Neithercut said. "And we do
have an expectation that we could
close on that this year, but nothing is
certain at the present time."
Elise Wilkinson, a Wells Fargo
media spokesperson, said that
"EQR is still conducting due dili
gence on the property."
