## EDITORIAL Public service as individuals' actions 
### 
Through numerous endeavors,
Stanford has provided a
haven for students' pursuit of
public service. The University en
courages student groups to serve
the community and houses the
Haas Center for Public Service, an
administrative center through
which students can join or create
student groups, obtain fellowships
and search for public service-relat
ed careers. In fact, the Haas Center
recently announced that Stanford
graduates are increasingly interest
ed in pursuing public service oppor
tunities.

wide swathe of pursuits, we may be
doing more harm than good.There is
simply too much heterogeneity with
in fields and industries to declare that
one type of career may be public
service while another may not.

First let us consider the notion
that careers in government must be
inherently categorized as aspects of
public service. This is certainly true
for many a campaigner, a grassroots
volunteer or a city mayor. Perhaps it
is true as well for a state senator, a

research analyst or the President of
the United States. But there are un
doubtedly dishonest, self-serving
politicians as well, those who rely
heavily on various donations and
sources of influence to place the
good of a narrow special interest
group over a greater good. As
countless editorials now maintain,
including a recent op-ed by Stan
ford lecturer David Crane, the
crony capitalism of politicians in
Washington, Sacramento and other
political capitals are just as much to
blame as those working in the de
cidedly non-public service sector.
Might public service then have a
place in for-profit organizations?
Yes, although the definition of pub
he service as including work in for
profit organizations that has a public
service aspect is in and of itself a tau
tology. Certainly some careers in for
profit organizations will have a
strong public service component, as
Jim Murray described when he pro
vided the example of working in cor
porate social responsibility. It so
happens that Morgan Stanley, Gold
man Sachs and most financial insti
tutions, currently lambasted to no
end, all have divisions that address
corporate social responsibility.
The inherent problem with
claiming that some careers relate to
public service while others do not
encompasses the tautological argu
ment in which some careers are
deemed public service because
they have public service aspects. We
do any career a disservice by as
suming that it is related to public
service by virtue of its general in
dustry or field. Rather, let us em
phasize that careers in certain areas
may be made to service the public
good by the actions of those who fill
the positions.

The definition of public service,
as stated by Jim Murray, program
director for postgraduate public
service at the Haas Center, is broad
er than the ideas traditionally asso
ciated with community service.
While the latter often bring to mind
volunteering in soup kitchens,
cleaning up public recreation areas
or constructing homes, a public
service career can, according to
Murray, be "working for a nonprof
it organization, a philanthropic
foundation, a government entity at
the local, national or international
level." In addition, a public service
related career can include "working
for a for-profit organization that has
a public service aspect."

At a time when the financial sec
tor is under attack for its pursuit of
ostensibly self-serving, greedy goals,
the notion of engaging in public serv
ice certainly sounds nobler. The Stop
the Brain Drain movement, begun in
part by Stanford students, aims to
promote public service and encour
ages young people to forego careers
in the financial services industry.
This dichotomy has gained trac
tion as the Occupy movements un
fold. On one side is Wall Street, a
category that has grown to encom
pass the finance, business and con
sulting industries, full of capitalists
who make up the "1 percent" of
American society. What is on the
other side? As far as career framing
goes, the other side seems to be the
amorphous category that is public
service.

It is valuable to recall that public
service is a broader category than
one may think. And by stamping the
broad label of public service onto a
