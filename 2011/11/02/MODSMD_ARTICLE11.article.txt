## Play that funky music 
### Amanda Ach 
r ■ ill is has been an amazing week.
And not just because of Hal
-L. loween or the USC game, al
though both of those were great. I'm
talking about something even better:
Glee is finally back. The TV show re
turned after a completely unneces
sary month-long hiatus, and with it, joy
and light have come back in to my life.
In celebration of this exciting event, I
wanted to dedicate this column exclu
sively to Glee. Unfortunately, this col
umn is about jobs and not TV, sol will
have to settle for discussing a career in
music instead. Now just to be fair, I'm
not a musician. When I was a child, I
was forced to take piano lessons, but I
hated the piano so much that I terror
ized my teacher until she quit. As a
third-grader, I was the drummer for a
Beatles cover band called the Blue
Bears, but we only played one show
for a select audience of parents and
babysitters. I could go on and on about
my musical failures a month of
fifth-grade chorus, an unsuccessful
stint in the San Francisco Opera
but that's really not the point. My non
musical background makes me an ex
ception on Stanford's campus, where
so many students are incredible musi
cians. But music doesn't have to be
just an after-school hobby there
are many options besides becoming a
rock star that will let those of you with
musical talent use those abilities to
build a successful and rewarding ca
reer. One such option is becoming a
music therapist, which is this week's
topic.

I had never heard of music thera
py until a few days ago, when a friend
suggested it to me (for a column topic,
not my personal use). As my friend
and the Internet taught me, a music
therapist functions somewhat like a
regular therapist, but uses music in
combination with traditional thera
peutic techniques to help people with
a variety of mental and physical
health issues. Music therapists are
more than just glorified versions of
Pandora Radio while playing

music for patients is a small part of the
job, most of the healing powers of
music therapy come from assisting
patients in creating music of their
own.

The applications of music therapy
are incredibly wide and varied; it can
be used to help those suffering from
terminal illness cope with their situa
tion, improve recovery rates among
stroke patients and perhaps most
impressively elevate adolescent
moods. New research shows that
music therapy can even be helpful
with memory recall in Alzheimer's
patients. By playing songs from differ
ent time periods in a patient's life, a
music therapist can actually trigger
memories from the patient's past.
Music therapists often hold de
grees in psychology and/or music, as
well as advanced degrees in music
therapy. Beyond the basic educational
requirements, music therapists must
also be certified through a national
board test. Last but not least, being a
talented musician helps. I know it al
most goes without saying, but as ap
pealing as this career sounds, those of
us who lack musical talent might want
to focus our job-searching efforts else
where.

Given the range of ways music
therapy can be used, there are numer
ous employment options for a music
therapist. Some choose to work in
hospitals, both general and psychi
atric, while others set up private prac
tices. Although most music therapists
choose to work in clinical settings,
there is a growing contingent focused
on research. Generally, this research
aims to better understand the rela
tionship between the human brain
and music and informs the way music
therapy is used in the clinical setting.
While this does require attending
medical school, it is a great option for
someone interested in psychology
and music but not so much in interact
ing with actual people.
Becoming a music therapist might
not be as glamorous as winning a

Grammy, but it is an incredibly re
warding way to use your musical tal
ents to help people and make Mr.
Schuester proud.

sicians? Amanda would love you to ser
