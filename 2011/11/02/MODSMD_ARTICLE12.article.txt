# ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES
## Working toward a better advising program 
### Jamie Solomon 
In freshman year, I did not have a
very positive experience with
our advising program. Neither
of my advisors a faculty member
(called a Pre-Major Advisor) and
an advisor attached to my residence
(my Academic Director) were
very helpful. My Pre-Major Advisor
was too busy to truly connect with
her students and incredibly un
knowledgeable about either our un
dergraduate curriculum or the ma
jors I was interested in. My Acade
mic Director didn't seem to care
about connecting with students, was
very impersonal and seemed almost
administrative.
Sophomore year, however, I
landed with the perfect advisor for
me: Kirsti Copeland, FloMo's for
mer AD. She's caring, knowledge
able, accessible and has really got
ten to know me to the point that she
can easily give me useful advice tai
lored to my interests. She also
makes sure to check in with me, so I
know she's concerned about how
well I'm doing. I don't have to make
the conscious decision to reach out
to her in order for her to help.
What made the difference be
tween my good advisor and the bad
ones? It really boils down to four
things: knowledge, commitment,
availability and the intangible per
sonal connection. As a freshman, I
needed someone who could answer
questions about PWR and which

Chem series I should take, and tell
me about the opportunities on cam
pus I might be interested in. If they
didn't know the answers, they need
ed to be able to point me to people
who could help me find them. They
also needed to be available to meet
with and reach out to me and care
about how I was navigating through
Stanford. If they are competent at
these other three, the last quality
that really makes a standout advisor
is someone with whom my person
ality clicks. The UAR can ensure
that its advisors possess the first
three qualities; the last one is only
solved by having a diversity of advi
sors and flexibility for students to
move between them.
What is the UAR doing to en
sure that more of its advisors have
these qualities so that fewer stu
dents are left on their own as I was
freshman year? A lot, actually.
There are a number of changes that
have taken place since I started at
Stanford. To address the issues of
availability and commitment, they
have tried to reduce the student-to

advisor ratio, allowing faculty mem
bers to spend more time on their
students. To address the issue of
knowledge, they have tried to split
the advising experience into two
parts. If a student has a question
about classes, majors or administra
tive issues they can go to their AD,
whose job it is to know all of this in
formation that pertains to a stu
dent's academic life. The pre-major
advisor, on the other hand, is in
tended to be a student's first facul
ty-student relationship and their
window into how the University
works.
Splitting advising up into these
two parts would have solved many
of my advising frustrations fresh
man year. Faculty no longer need to
learn all about the undergraduate
curriculum and can instead advise
using their areas of expertise and
ties to the University. Students are
not left on their own in terms of
their academics because they each
have an advisor whose full-time job
is to know curricular information.
To make this system work, it is im
portant that students understand
these two distinct roles so that they
are not frustrated when their facul
ty advisors lack information. More
over, students must begin a person
al relationship with both their ADs
and pre-major advisors at the be
ginning of the year. The UAR is
working on making both of these

happen.
Even with these changes, there
is one piece that I still see missing.
Even if a faculty member has com
mitted to being a pre-major advisor
and cares about their students, they
may not have the ability to spend
the time they need to on their ad
visees. Except for the few profes
sors who personally decide con
necting with students is their prior
ity, it can be very hard to get to
know a professor because they
have so many obligations as part of
their career. This is not necessarily
a problem the UAR can solve. Al
though they can only let the faculty
that are doing a good job continue
to advise, they still must provide an
advisor to every student. For the
pre-major advising program to
truly succeed for every student who
needs it, the UAR must create a
structure that works for the stu
dents and the University must
allow its faculty the time and ener
gy to breathe life into the structure.
I commend Stanford for working
on these issues to improve the stu
dent experience and I hope that
each year's students find more
knowledgeable, caring and won
derful advisors than the last.

move between them.
What is the UAR doing to en
sure that more of its advisors have
these qualities so that fewer stu
dents are left on their own as I was
freshman year? A lot, actually.
There are a number of changes that
have taken place since I started at
Stanford. To address the issues of
availability and commitment, they
have tried to reduce the student-to

advisor ratio, allowing faculty mem
bers to spend more time on their
students. To address the issue of
knowledge, they have tried to split
the advising experience into two
parts. If a student has a question
about classes, majors or administra
tive issues they can go to their AD,
whose job it is to know all of this in
formation that pertains to a stu
dent's academic life. The pre-major
advisor, on the other hand, is in
tended to be a student's first facul
ty-student relationship and their
window into how the University
works.
Splitting advising up into these
two parts would have solved many
of my advising frustrations fresh
man year. Faculty no longer need to
learn all about the undergraduate
curriculum and can instead advise
using their areas of expertise and
ties to the University. Students are
not left on their own in terms of
their academics because they each
have an advisor whose full-time job
is to know curricular information.
To make this system work, it is im
portant that students understand
these two distinct roles so that they
are not frustrated when their facul
ty advisors lack information. More
over, students must begin a person
al relationship with both their ADs
and pre-major advisors at the be
ginning of the year. The UAR is
working on making both of these

happen.
Even with these changes, there
is one piece that I still see missing.
Even if a faculty member has com
mitted to being a pre-major advisor
and cares about their students, they
may not have the ability to spend
the time they need to on their ad
visees. Except for the few profes
sors who personally decide con
necting with students is their prior
ity, it can be very hard to get to
know a professor because they
have so many obligations as part of
their career. This is not necessarily
a problem the UAR can solve. Al
though they can only let the faculty
that are doing a good job continue
to advise, they still must provide an
advisor to every student. For the
pre-major advising program to
truly succeed for every student who
needs it, the UAR must create a
structure that works for the stu
dents and the University must
allow its faculty the time and ener
gy to breathe life into the structure.
I commend Stanford for working
on these issues to improve the stu
dent experience and I hope that
each year's students find more
knowledgeable, caring and won
derful advisors than the last.

Jamie would love to know how the
advising experience has gone for you,
