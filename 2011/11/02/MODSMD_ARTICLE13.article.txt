## NEW LOOK, SAME SKILL Season opens tonight against UC-San Diego 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Every year, when wintertime brings the
damp skies that force everyone indoors, there
are a few familiar questions that float around
Maples Pavilion.
"Do you think we can beat UConn?"
"Think this is the year we finally win it all?"
But for the 2011-12 Stanford women's bas
ketball team, which tips off its season today
with an exhibition matchup against UC-San
Diego, there's likely to be a brand new ques
tion in the air: "Who is that?"
After years of iconic players passing the
torch along from Candice Wiggins to Jayne
Appel to Kayla Pedersen and Jeanette Pohlen
the No. 5 Cardinal has a new, younger look
this year.
With a class of six freshmen suiting up in
red and white this season, Stanford has only six
juniors and seniors on the team after five sen
iors were lost to graduation last year. Those
five included All-Americans and first-round
WNBA Draft picks Pederson and Pohlen,
who each averaged over 33 minutes and 12
points per game Pohlen was also named
the Pac-10's Player of the Year.
But despite the fresh infusion of talent and
loss of two of the iconic players in Stanford
women's basketball history, expectations are
still high for the team that has made it to four

consecutive Final Fours and captured 11 con
secutive Pac-10 conference titles.
The reasons for optimism begin with the
supremely talented sister duo of senior
Nnemkadi and sophomore Chiney Ogwu
mike, who Hall of Fame head coach Tara Van-
Derveer calls upon once again to provide the
team a dominant force.
Nnemkadi, who has already been named
an AP Preseason All-American for the second
time, averaged a team-high 17.5 points per
game last season and pulled down 7.6 re
bounds per game, trailing only Chiney, who
had exactly eight rebounds per game.
Nnemkadi, who piled up a laundry list of
accolades last year, will certainly once again be
on the short list for the Wade Trophy, awarded
to the best player in the nation at the end of
every year.
Chiney, last season's Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year, started all but one game last season
on her way to 11.7 points a game and will be
viewed as one of the centerpieces of the squad,
despite her youth, after shooting better than
57 percent from the floor last season.
Behind the terrific known quantities that
are the Ogwumike sisters, though, lies a talent
ed group of players that have all logged sub
stantial playing time off the bench in the past
and will be a critical factor in determining the
Cardinal's success this season.
Sophomore Toni Kokenis, who averaged
5.3 points per game last year, is expected to
step into Pohlen's role as the point guard and
maestro of the Cardinal offense after Kokenis

spent last season mostly coming off
the bench and either running the point
or playing alongside Pohlen.
Senior Lindy La Rocque is again
expected to start at shooting guard
after starting 29 games in that spot last
year, but both guards will likely be
challenged for playing time by fresh
man guard Amber Orrange, who was
the nation's No. 15 recruit this past sea
son and a McDonald's All-American.

Redshirt junior Sarah Boothe and
junior Joslyn Tinkle will help replace
Pedersen, as both averaged more than
five points a game last season and
played in more than 35 games, but
both are also more suited to play in
side the paint than Pedersen. Junior
Mikaela Ruef will also be called upon
to fill the gap, and a trio of dynamic
freshman forwards McDonald's
All American Bonnie Samuelson,
Taylor Greenfield and Erica Payne
will bring their 6-foot-3 frames to the
Cardinal offense as well.

The Cardinal completed an unde
feated conference season in the Pac
-10 last year for the second time in as
many years, and the early outlook for
the conference has Stanford once
again playing the role of heavy fa-
