## No. 6 Stanford to host NorPac Tournament 
### JORDAN GUNNING 
After a weekend that featured two solid wins
on the road in Michigan, the No. 6 Stanford
women's field hockey team is gearing up to host
the 2011 NorPac Conference Tournament this
week, starting Thursday and running through Sat
urday.
The top-seeded Cardinal's (15-2,6-0 NorPac)
excitement was palpable among the players with
this week's kick-off to a much anticipated post
season.
As the four-time defending champions of the

NorPac tourney with a perfect regular-season
conference record, it would be understandable if
the team felt some pressure heading into this
weekend. The Cardinal, however, seems unfazed.
"Heading into the NorPac tournament as
four-time defending champions is obviously an
honor, but it doesn't place any more pressure on
us," said sophomore attacker Hope Burke, "We
want to win another NorPac championship, but
instead of focusing on a number, we are focusing
on playing as a team and executing in the postsea
son."
This past weekend's wins against Michigan St.

and No. 7 Michigan also seemed to have helped
calm the Card before the start of the tourney.
"I feel like this weekend was a turning point
for us because we realized that we are capable of
going as far as we want to go as long as we play to
gether and stick to the game plan," Burke ex
plained. "These wins also re-energized the team
and sparked a new passion, and I am excited to
bring this new mentality to the games this week
end."
This "new mentality" will be key, as the win-
ners of the tournament will earn a
spot in a play-in game for the
NCAA Championship Tourna
ment. Burke said that this is of the
utmost importance to the team.
"Then we'll be one step closer to
returning to the NCAA Tourna
ment. Performing this weekend is
what we have been practicing for
the past three months. The time is
now."

Also up for grabs is a Stanford
Field Hockey single-season record
for most wins, which this season's
team is only three wins away from
obtaining. But as Burke revealed,
this record is not a main concern for
the team.
"It would be awesome to break
the single season record," she said.
"But that's not what's really in our
minds."

The Cardinal's first game of the
tournament, set for Thursday at 1:30
p.m., shouldn't be much of a chal
lenge as they take on the Moun
taineers of Appalachian State (2-16,
NorPac 1-5), a team that has been
outscored 23-77 by its opponents.
With the Card's precision handling
and fierce shooting average of 17.1
shots per game compared to the
Mountaineers' 8.7, the team should
n't need to rely on home field ad
vantage for the win.
The winner of this game will go
on to face the winner of the David
son College (10-7, 4-2 NorPac) vs.
UC-Davis (4-11, 2-4 NorPac)
matchup in the semifinals on Friday,
also at 1:30 p.m. The championship
game is set for Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
Stanford will take on Appalachi
an State in the first round of the
NorPac Championship on Thurs
day, Nov. 3, at 1:30 p.m. at the Varsi
ty Turf.
