# Head-to-head hits a no-brainer
## 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jncoby is my Homeboy 
If there is one thing you can al
ways count on, it's the innate
ability of human beings to do
stupid things. When football is
involved, go ahead and take that
stupidity to the next level.
On Saturday, in the midst of An
drew Luck's game-tying drive against
USC,Trojan safetyT.J. McDonald lit up
Stanford wide receiver Chris Owusu
after the senior wideout couldn't grab a
third-down pass. And by lit up, I mean
lit up.
Although McDonald arguably led
with his shoulder, he all but speared
Owusu from behind at full speed and
slammed into Owusu's helmet in a vi
olent collision that knocked him out of
the game.
The play was a big one for both
teams USC's defense was bending
but not breaking at that point and
thought it had produced a crucial
third-down stop when Stanford had to
score a touchdown to tie the score. But
the flags quickly came flying as Owusu
lay on the ground, the 15-yard penalty
extended the drive and Luck took full
advantage as the Cardinal sent the
game into overtime on Stepfan Tay
lor's 2-yard touchdown run.
USC coach Lane Kiffin was beside
himself with the penalty, criticizing the
work of the referees in hopes of draw
ing a fine of his own (which he did, to
the tune of $lO,OOO from the Pac-12).
And McDonald was further suspend
ed for the first half of the Trojans game
this week against Colorado.
An immediate question that I had
after Owusu went down, however, was
why is this poor guy such a magnet for
abuse? It doesn't matter that the injury
he suffered on the play had more to do
with his shoulder than his head, be
cause the highly touted receiver from
Oaks Christian High has had more
than his fair share of injuries during his
time at the Farm.
Three concussions, two devastating
knee injuries and a healthy helping of
nicks and bruises have combined to
put Owusu and his blazing speed on
the bench for 16 games over three and
a half years, and at 6-foot-2 and 200
pounds, Owusu isn't exactly a twig in
between the lines.
This leads me to the stupidity that
surrounds us, even here at Stanford. I
recently overheard a member of the
press core talking about McDonald's
hit, and criticizing Owusu and others
who have been taken out of games this
year with helmet-to-helmet hits for
being "weak."
I've never played football, besides
throwing the ball around with my fam
ily or dominating the "Ink Bowl" (see
last week's column for an explana
tion), but I'm pretty damn sure that no
one has any business calling elite, Divi
sion-! football players "weak" (and he
did not use that term, opting for a
much more vulgar variation).
This particular man justified then
weakness by leaning back and giving
the ol' "I played back when it was a
man's game. And let me tell you, we
didn't come out of the game for any lit
tle head injury." He elaborated on this
oh-so-sophisticated-philosophy by
telling me how Owusu's hit was clean,
and how the defender had every right
to launch himself into a wide receiver
in order to try and disrupt the play. He
criticized Owusu for not being able to
properly "defend himself" and
lamented the rule that penalizes hits
on defenseless receivers.
This got my blood really boiling.
The purpose of rules that protect
the quarterback from unnecessary
roughness and wide receivers from
getting blown up unfairly is to neutral
ize the unbelievable speed and
strength that has percolated from the
professional ranks to the college game
and now onto some high school fields.
With all of the studies about former
football players hit with debilitating in
juries as they age and the risks associ
ated with repeated blows to the head,
I don't understand how former foot
ball players who are lucky enough not
to suffer from dementia don't see how
important it is to protect those on the
field horn themselves.
Because the players certainly don't
want to stop hitting each other, and
they don't want to be seen as weak.
Owusu said on Tuesday that he doesn't
want to stop asking for the ball, and
Luck will certainly continue to find
one of the most explosive players in
college football.
And as long as football is played
with helmets and pads, violent hits will

continue. Owusu is one of several
players across the country testing spe
cialized mouth guards equipped with
wireless transmitters for a Stanford
study to record impact data on the
field. His crushing hit two weeks ago
at Washington State was the highest
recorded in the study so far, according
to Stanford coach David Shaw.

With incidents like that one, ad
justing the rules slightly, and I do
mean slightly plenty of hits go un
penalized and the pressing concern is
to avoid brutal shots to the head is
not a bad thing.

vorite. The only other Pac-12 squad
ranked in theTop-25 preseason poll is
No. 23 USC, which finished fourth in
the conference last season.

On the national stage, Stanford
once again plays a challenging non
conference schedule with a trip to visit
the No. 20 Texas Longhoms to start
the regular season on Nov. 11, as well
as a road trip to tangle to with No. 4
Connecticut, which will be without
three-time Wade Trophy winner
Maya Moore after the Huskies' super
star entered the WNBA as the num
ber-one overall pick this summer.
The Cardinal's highest-profile
home game will be against No. 3 Ten
nessee, a team that includes AP Pre
season All-American Shekinna
Striklen as well as Meighan Sim
mons, last year's SEC Freshman of
the year.
After falling just short of a na
tional title for the past four years, the
Cardinal will be taking a fresh ap
proach to the 2011-2012 season and
hoping that a little new flavor can fi
nally give it the edge it needs to
bring home its first national champi
onship since 1992.

Stanford kicks off its season
tonight at Maples Pavilion against
UC-San Diego.Tipoff is scheduled for
7 p.m.
