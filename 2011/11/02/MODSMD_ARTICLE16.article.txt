# WRESTLING HITS THE MATS
## 
### PALANI ESWARAN 
The 2011-2012 Cardinal wrestling
season got off to an exciting start last
Friday with its annual Cardinal vs.
White wrestle-offs at Burnham
Pavilion. In the first official event of
the season, the top two Stanford
wrestlers in each weight class went
head-to-head to compete for a spot
in the starting lineup.
Freshman Alex Manley and
sophomore Donovan Halpin were
the most thrilling pair of the night,
facing off for the starting spot at 141
pounds. Both Manley and Halpin
wrestled very well on top through
out the match, and heading into the
final thirty seconds, the score was
even at two. Manley fought hard
from the top position, but in the final
10 seconds Halpin broke away for
the escape and won by one point.
The other winning wrestlers
were freshman Evan Silver at the
125-pound weight class, junior Ryan
Mango at 133, redshirt junior
Timmy Boone at 149, both sopho
more Garrett Schaner and redshirt
freshman Matt Schneider at 157,
redshirt senior Nick Amuchastegui
at 174, sophomore Alan Yen at 197
and sophomore Dan Scherer at
heavyweight.

After the wrestle-offs head coach
Jason Borrelli was very optimistic

about his young squad.
"I was pretty encouraged by our
young guys," Borrelli said, now en
tering his fourth season as the Cardi
nal's head coach. "They wrestled
hard, stayed competitive. They were
fighting for position, scrapping. It
looks good for the future."
The Cardinal enters the year
ranked No. 14 in the country and is
coming off an incredibly successful
2010-11 season in which the squad
finished a program-best 11th at the
NCAA Tournament. The team also
returns two All-Americans

Amuchastegui and Mango.
Last season, Amuchastegui
placed second at the NCAA Cham
pionships, and he enters this year
ranked No. 1 in the 174-pound
weight class. Mango finished sixth at
the NCAAs last year and is ranked
No. 7 in the nation in the 133-pound
weight class.
"This year, first of all, I'm trying
to stay healthy," Mango said after a
dominating performance in his
match on Friday. "There's always
things we need to work on.There's a
lot of stuff we need to go into the
room on Monday and evaluate
going into our first dual at North
western next weekend."

Friday's wrestle-offs showed a
team that appears ready to make
some noise throughout the country.

With multiple top-ten wrestlers, the
Cardinal is setting high expectations
for its performance this season.
"We want to do the best national
ly we've ever done," Borrelli said.
"We'd like to focus on having an
NCAA champion. That would be
very big for the program."
These are no easy tasks. Stan
ford's best national performance
would mean a top-ten finish at the
NCAA Tournament and multiple
All-American wrestlers once again.
An NCAA champion is also within
the realm of possibility; the team has
two top-ten wrestlers and a plethora
of talented younger wrestlers the
incoming class is ranked No. 24 in
the country —to complement its
older veterans.

The team is extremely deep; al
most every match in the wrestle-offs
nearly went into the third period.
One match in particular the 174-
pound matchup between
Amuchastegui and redshirt junior
Spence Patrick— showed the true
character of the Cardinal wrestlers.
Although Amuchastegui won 10-2,
Patrick fought extremely hard,
showing determination and pride.
"We feel that Spence Patrick is as
good as anyone in the country. He
just happens to be behind Nick,"
Borrelli explained. "And for Nick to
come out, get focused and get past

the fact that he's wrestling a team
mate and score a lot of points is good
to see. I was very pleased."
One clear thing about the Cardi
nal wrestlers going into the season is
that they do the little things right.
Whether it's proper hand control on
top, being aware of riding time (the
wrestler's net time in the top posi
tion) or fighting for an extra inch of
position, this team handles the fine
points that often go overlooked but
can ultimately decide a match.
Stanford is already making
preparations for its upcoming match

against Northwestern. The Wildcats
have a nationally ranked team and
will likely prove to be a tough early
test for the Cardinal.
"The last month and a half has
been about getting ready for our
first true test," Borelli said. "We've
been watching film on them, and we
should be ready to go."
On Friday, Stanford will travel to
Chicago to face Northwestern in its
first dual meet of the season.
