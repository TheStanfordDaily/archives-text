# SSE opens two new stores
## AT&T retailer and an off-campus coffee shop emerge this year 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE), the financial branch of the
ASSU, started two new business ven
tures this academic year. SSE opened
Campus Mobile, an AT&T author
ized retailer, in Tresidder Memorial
Union on Sept. 7, and is preparing for
the public opening of Ground Up, an
off-campus coffee shop, next
Wednesday.
The two stores are opening as part
of an effort by SSE to open new rev
enue streams, according to SSE CEO
Neveen Mahmoud 'll. All profits
from the new stores will be returned
to the student body.
"You bring on two new revenue
streams that if we do things well
and correctly are profitable, and
you're getting new money for the stu
dent body," Mahmoud said.
Campus Mobile sells AT&T wire

less products and accessories and will
work its way toward selling tablets.
Mahmoud said the partnership with
AT&T is new territory for SSE be
cause it has never collaborated direct
ly with a corporation.
"What I'm seeing really immedi
ately is that it's taking the organiza
tion to a new level of professional
ism," she said. "This is the first time
we've engaged a corporate partner in
a long term relationship."
All Campus Mobile employees
had to complete online classes for
AT&T for more than 50 hours and
participate in a four-day training ses
sion with AT&T corporate officials.
Sales associate Keith Cross said that
employees were trained in transac
tions, use of the point-of-sale system
and customer service.
Foot traffic through the store,
which is located in between the Tree
house and Tresidder Fitness in the

previous SSE Student Store location,
varies with each week, according to
Campus Mobile General Manager
Victoria Asbury 'll. She said the re
tailer's busiest periods so far have
been during International Student
Orientation, New Student Orienta
tion and the release of the iPhone 4S.
"Lots of people were coming in
here [during NSO] getting family
plans," Cross said.
As part of a separate SSE venture,
Ground Up will serve Blue Bottle
coffee, Ike's sandwiches, local artisan
ice cream and other pastries.
The coffee shop, located off-cam
pus at the AOL building on Page Mill
Road, is not the first off-campus SSE
venture. SSE's startup accelerator,
StartX, also maintains offices in the
AOL building.
Ground Up plans to host a soft
opening Thursday when it will open
for building employees.

"They were looking to have great
coffee and great food in-house, and
they approached us to operate it,"
Mahmoud said. "That was an oppor
tunity for us to leverage an existing
corporate relationship [into] the food
services sector, which is a completely
new experience."
According to Mahmoud, before

starting a new venture, SSE research
es the demand for a proposed busi
ness through polling and focus
groups. SSE's Board of Directors also
plays a large role in vetting the ideas,
she said.
The group then compiles a busi
