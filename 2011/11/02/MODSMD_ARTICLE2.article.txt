# SSE opens two new stores
## AT&T retailer and an off-campus coffee shop emerge this year 
### ALICE PHILLIPS 
Stanford Student Enterprises
(SSE), the financial branch of the
ASSU, started two new business ven
tures this academic year. SSE opened
Campus Mobile, an AT&T author
ized retailer, in Tresidder Memorial
Union on Sept. 7, and is preparing for
the public opening of Ground Up, an
off-campus coffee shop, next
Wednesday.
The two stores are opening as part
of an effort by SSE to open new rev
enue streams, according to SSE CEO
Neveen Mahmoud 'll. All profits
from the new stores will be returned
to the student body.
"You bring on two new revenue
streams that if we do things well
and correctly are profitable, and
you're getting new money for the stu
dent body," Mahmoud said.
Campus Mobile sells AT&T wire

less products and accessories and will
work its way toward selling tablets.
Mahmoud said the partnership with
AT&T is new territory for SSE be
cause it has never collaborated direct
ly with a corporation.
"What I'm seeing really immedi
ately is that it's taking the organiza
tion to a new level of professional
ism," she said. "This is the first time
we've engaged a corporate partner in
a long term relationship."
All Campus Mobile employees
had to complete online classes for
AT&T for more than 50 hours and
participate in a four-day training ses
sion with AT&T corporate officials.
Sales associate Keith Cross said that
employees were trained in transac
tions, use of the point-of-sale system
and customer service.
Foot traffic through the store,
which is located in between the Tree
house and Tresidder Fitness in the

previous SSE Student Store location,
varies with each week, according to
Campus Mobile General Manager
Victoria Asbury 'll. She said the re
tailer's busiest periods so far have
been during International Student
Orientation, New Student Orienta
tion and the release of the iPhone 4S.
"Lots of people were coming in
here [during NSO] getting family
plans," Cross said.
As part of a separate SSE venture,
Ground Up will serve Blue Bottle
coffee, Ike's sandwiches, local artisan
ice cream and other pastries.
The coffee shop, located off-cam
pus at the AOL building on Page Mill
Road, is not the first off-campus SSE
venture. SSE's startup accelerator,
StartX, also maintains offices in the
AOL building.
Ground Up plans to host a soft
opening Thursday when it will open
for building employees.

"They were looking to have great
coffee and great food in-house, and
they approached us to operate it,"
Mahmoud said. "That was an oppor
tunity for us to leverage an existing
corporate relationship [into] the food
services sector, which is a completely
new experience."
According to Mahmoud, before

starting a new venture, SSE research
es the demand for a proposed busi
ness through polling and focus
groups. SSE's Board of Directors also
plays a large role in vetting the ideas,
she said.
The group then compiles a busi

Stanford Student Enterprises (SSE) opened Campus Mobile, an AT&T
authorized retailer, between Treehouse and Tresidder Fitness on Sept. 7. SSE
CEO Neveen Mahmoud said that the store hopes to increase its total
revenue and return all of its profit to the student body.
ness model to determine the prof
itability of the ventures and, if neces
sary, looks into where the business
would be located.
"Off the bat, because of the nature
of our model, Ground Up is going to
be almost instantly profitable," Mah
moud said. "With Campus Mobile,
because it's a much more complicat
ed business model, it will be prof
itable early. But the real profitability
with Campus Mobile is looking three
to five years down the line."
SSE's foray into the food and
phone services has required SSE to
expand its office by hiring two full
time managers both of whom are
recent Stanford graduates from the
Class of 2011.
Mahmoud said even though SSE
has hired graduates, current students
remain the center of the organiza
tion's mission.
"Although our mission was to give
an entrepreneurial experience to stu
dents, we thought it was really an ex
tension to give that experience to re
cent graduates," Mahmoud said.
Campus Mobile currently em
ploys three students and, by year's
end, aims to employ roughly 10, ac
cording to Mahmoud. Ground Up
will employ approximately five stu
dent baristas over the course of the
year.
"Students are capable of incredi
ble things," she said. "Eventually, we
could have students running these in
credibly complicated businesses just
as we have them running our banking
business or our [Stanford Student]
store. We're certainly looking for
ward to and expecting a time when
students can be running these ven
tures."

Asbury said she only just heard

about SSE before coming on board
as Campus Mobile's General Man
ager because she had previously
been focused on mentorship and non
profit ventures.
"This is a very good experience to
improve my managerial skills," As
bury said. "I am understanding fi
nances, making sure the dollars and
the cents add up and all make sense."
In the future, Mahmoud said that
SSE might branch off into business
es such as real estate to give students
an opportunity to own and manage
real estate and to help startups ob
tain physical spaces to start their
businesses.
