## Obama quickens loan change Policy may not affect many at Stanford 
### JOSEE SMITH 
A new federal policy change an
nounced by President Obama last
Tuesday, designed to help students
manage their college loan debts,
may not affect many students at
Stanford, according to Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
"This policy change will have a
medium impact on Stanford stu
dents," Cooper said. "In general, our
students don't have problems re
paying their loans."
Cooper said she spent this past
week in New York at the College
Board's National Forum, where she
and her colleagues from universities
around the country discussed the
role of education in the upcoming
election, and in particular, Obama's
recent announcement.
Obama used an executive order
to bypass Congress and ensure the
passage of the law this year instead
of 2014, when the legislation was
originally expected to go into effect.
The new measure attempts to
help Americans by offering a "Pay
as You Earn" proposal, which will
take effect in 2012. The "Pay as You
Earn" option caps monthly loan re
payments at 10 percent of a stu
dent's discretionary income
down from 15 percent.
Additionally, remaining student
loans would be forgiven after 20
years instead of 25 years.
According to a White House
press release, the policy could affect
about 1.6 million borrowers. The
statement also said that student
loans are currently the second high
est source of household indebted
ness for Americans.
"These measures are a reassur
ance to students," Cooper said. "It's
a good promise that taking out

loans won't get [the students] into
trouble."
According to Cooper, the federal
government determines the amount
of discretionary income by "collect
ing information from the students
about their annual income, about
their family situation and whether
they are supporting other people,
such as children, and then setting a
minimum poverty level."
She said that Stanford students
historically have not had problems
paying the minimum monthly re
payment.
"[Stanford] students are able to
find work after graduation and
therefore paying the minimum
monthly payment is not an issue,"
Cooper said.
"We have one of the lowest de
fault rates in the country," she
added, noting that Stanford's aver
age default rate is 0.8 percent, com
pared to the national average of 8.8
percent.
Only around 28 percent of Stan
ford undergraduates who graduated
last year had any debt, Cooper said,
with the average indebtedness at
$16,458 much lower than the na
tional average of about $24,000.
"The standard repayment period
for Stanford students is about 10
years," she said. "Few students will
be affected by these new measures
simply because it is uncommon for
Stanford students to take more than
20 years to repay their loans."
The White House said in a press
release that the changes would carry
no additional costs for taxpayers and
instead could save as much as $2 bil-

lion. Borrowers would be able to
consolidate a Direct Loan from the
federal government with one issued
under the Federal Family Education
Loan Program and would no longer
have to pay a subsidy to a lender,
which could save the government
money, the press release said.
The new policy has received crit
icism from Republican presidential
candidates, including former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep.
Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.
Obama stated last Wednesday that
the law would boost the economy
because debt-saddled borrowers
would be able to spend money on
expenses such as homes.
"The message doesn't really
change for our students," Cooper
said. "It's just one more option."
