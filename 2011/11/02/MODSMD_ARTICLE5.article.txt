## Trustees approve gym expansion Department of Athletics seeks to address football overcrowding 
### DANIELLE LUSSIER 
The Board of Trustees approved plans at its most re
cent meeting last month for a $l7 million expansion to
the Arrillaga Family Sports Center (AFSC).
This expansion will primarily address the current
overcrowding of the football team offices, while also
offering benefits to other athletic programs, according
to Ray Purpur, deputy athletic director.
Located in Arrillaga Plaza, between the AFSC and
Avery Aquatics Center, the new addition to the AFSC
will look similar to the existing building and "be adjoin
ing the current space," Purpur said.
According to Mark Bonino, a University project
manager, construction can be expected to begin by
mid-2012. Fie said funding will come from a mix of Uni
versity and donor funds. Currently, the lead donor on
the project is the Arrillaga family.

The 28,500 square foot addition "will support the
football program [with more] coach and team space,
lockers and showers, training and conditioning space,"
Bonino said.

In addition, strength and conditioning and sports
performance areas on the lower level of the AFSC will
be expanded and made available to all student-ath
letes, Purpur said.
"The expansion of Arrillaga allows for a much larg
er footprint in terms of strength and conditioning as
well as sports medicine, which are critical components
for the success of the athletic program," said Matt
Doyle, director of football operations.
According to Doyle, these expanded sports medi
cine areas will allow for more space for treatment and
include new hot tubs, cold tubs and rehabilitation
areas.
However, the planning and design of the new space
are still in the works, Bonino said.
"We're just beginning. We still have some ways to go
to get all of the necessary approvals and permits to
start construction," he said.
Purpur said that football is not
the only Stanford sport that will use
the new space and that all of the
athletic programs will have "differ
ent degrees of benefit from the new
building."
He noted that currently all
teams in the athletic department
must share meeting space in the
AFSC.
By creating new conference
rooms and meeting space exclu
sively for the football team, football
coaches and staff will no longer
have to take away film and erase
whiteboards after meetings, Purpur
said.
According to Bonino, some
space in the addition will also be
dedicated to the aquatics program.
Karsten Lutz 'l5, a member of
the men's crew team, said he is
looking forward to the new space.
"Any benefits from improved
athletic facilities could trickle down
to all the other athletic teams, not
just football," Lutz said.
Kristian Ipsen 'l5, a member of
the diving team, said he also antici
pates benefits from the expansion.
The expansion "has the poten
tial to give smaller teams, like div
ing, more opportunity to improve
and give them the same kind of sup
port that larger teams get," he said.
The overall growth of the foot
ball program has contributed to the
current overcrowding, Purpur said.
He said that when the football lock
er rooms were originally built in
1994, there were 85 student athletes
on the roster. Currently, the team
has grown to a roster of 105 players,
the maximum number permitted by
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA).
"We now have the smallest lock
er room in the Pac-12," Purpur said.
Expanding the locker room to
include study and lounge areas for
football players will "provide a lot
more meeting space for players,"
Doyle said.
Doyle said the expanded locker
room will also help to "separate the
lounging and the studying from the
actual smell of shoulder pads, hel
mets and grass."
As for the fate of the current foot
ball space in the AFSC, Purpur said
that the current football offices will
be converted into offices for other
Stanford sports. He said one long
term goal is for all head coaches to
have private offices, with shared of
fices for all assistant coaches.
The entire football staff was con
sulted for input on the design of the
new space, Purpur said.
For example, an entrance exclu
sively for the players is one contri
bution from the football staff,
Doyle said.
The expansion will "enhance the
operation and change the way we
do business in a positive way,"
Doyle added.
