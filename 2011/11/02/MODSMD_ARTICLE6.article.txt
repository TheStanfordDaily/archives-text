## Panel explores broadcasting future 
### EDWARD NGAI 
Broadcasting leaders explored current and fu
ture challenges for public broadcasting in a panel
discussion moderated Monday evening by Ger
hard Casper, president emeritus of Stanford Uni
versity. The event was titled, "Does Public Broad
casting Have A Future?"
"Public television works very differently in dif
ferent parts of the world," said James Fishkin, com
munication department chair and the organizer of
the event. "I feel a comparative discussion for
where public television works well and why, and
what it's accomplished, would be interesting."
According to Fishkin, one of the world's most
robust public broadcasting systems exists in the
state of Bavaria, Germany, where panelist Ulrich
Wilhelm serves as director-general of Bavarian
Broadcasting.
"[We must] take advantage of [public broad
casting's] strong point: quality," Wilhelm said. "Se
rious reporting, expertise, objectivity ... that's our
branding. This is the safeguard for the existence of
PBS and NPR in America, which cannot survive by
the law of the marketplace."
