## Panel explores broadcasting future 
### EDWARD NGAI 
Broadcasting leaders explored current and fu
ture challenges for public broadcasting in a panel
discussion moderated Monday evening by Ger
hard Casper, president emeritus of Stanford Uni
versity. The event was titled, "Does Public Broad
casting Have A Future?"
"Public television works very differently in dif
ferent parts of the world," said James Fishkin, com
munication department chair and the organizer of
the event. "I feel a comparative discussion for
where public television works well and why, and
what it's accomplished, would be interesting."
According to Fishkin, one of the world's most
robust public broadcasting systems exists in the
state of Bavaria, Germany, where panelist Ulrich
Wilhelm serves as director-general of Bavarian
Broadcasting.
"[We must] take advantage of [public broad
casting's] strong point: quality," Wilhelm said. "Se
rious reporting, expertise, objectivity ... that's our
branding. This is the safeguard for the existence of
PBS and NPR in America, which cannot survive by
the law of the marketplace."

Ulrich Wilhelm, director of Bavarian Broadcasting, discussed
the broadcasting system in Germany, which he
described as one of the most robust in the world.
MacNeil/Lehrer Productions and
its flagship show, PBS News Hour,
agreed, highlighting the difference
between public and commercial
networks.
"By and large, [commercial
broadcasters] have gone to the
marketplace. They've gone to the
lower common denominator,"
Werner said.
Communciation professor
Shanto Iyengar characterized com
mercial broadcasters differently.
"Commercial broadcasters con
sistently deliver soft news," he said.
"Basically, news about sex, sleaze
and scandal."
He added that a robust public
broadcast system has far-reaching
societal effects.
"Exposure to public broadcast
ing ... reduces the inequality in the
level of political knowledge," Iyen
gar said. "It democratizes the distri
bution of political knowledge,"
Despite this, public broadcast
ing is in the midst of uncertain
times, according to the speakers.
From 2008 to 2013, public
broadcasters anticipate a $5OO mil

lion dollar decline in funding, from
$1.7 billion to $1.2 billion, Werner
said, citing a statistic from the Cor
poration for Public Broadcasting.
But a drop in funding was only
one of several problems the panel
identified.

Tim Olson, vice president of
media and education at the San
Francisco-based public broadcast
er KQED noted a public informa
tion gap concerning taxpayer fund
ing of public broadcasters.
"The amount of federal funding is
greatly overestimated by the public,"
Olson said. "The median guess [in an
April CNN survey] was 5 percent of
the federal budget $l7B billion
dollars. The reality is that [public
broadcasters receive] l/100th of 1
percent of our national budget."
There remains a lot to be opti
mistic about in public broadcast
ing's future, Olson said.

"We're able to use the benefits
of the Internet," he said.
Olson quoted David Fanning,
head of the PBS program Front
line, who said "the technology has
finally caught up with our mission."
"We've always been about get
ting user participation. Now we
have the tools to do it."
