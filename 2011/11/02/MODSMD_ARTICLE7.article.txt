## Senate develops USC ticket reimbursement 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting Tuesday evening included discus
sion of the reimbursement program for
USC tickets, an event sponsored by the
ASSU called "Occupy What?" and Ground
Up, the coffee shop organized by the Stan
ford Student Enterprises (SSE), the finan
cial arm of the ASSU
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 detailed the
exact procedure for obtaining refunds from
the ASSU for tickets to the University of

Southern California (USC) football game.
By dropping off the ticket receipt at the
SSE offices on the first floor of Old Union
and signing a form saying they submitted
their receipt, students will be able to receive
a $lO refund per ticket by a check. Laufer
said he was not sure whether the amount
refunded to students would increase if
fewer students submit requests.
He also said he was not sure when
checks would be distributed.
Senator Daniel DeLong 'l3 introduced
a new pet-project designed to promote ad
vocacy by members of the ASSU on behalf

of students when dealing with University
officials. The program is designed to allow
students the ability to request the aid of
ASSU senators or executives when dealing
with University officials.
DeLong noted many ASSU members
have good working-relationships with Uni
versity officials, and even related personal
stories of how he has helped advocate on
behalf of students successfully.
ASSU Executive President Michael
Cruz 'l2 informed the Senate of an event,
sponsored by the ASSU Executive
branch called "Occupy What?"
The event, scheduled for Thurs
day, Nov. 3, at 8:00 p.m. in Old Union
200, will feature a roundtable dis
cussion by students, professors and
administrators on what Stanford's
role in the nationwide Occupy
movement should be.

Senators were encouraged to at
tend the grand opening of Ground
Up, a coffee shop owned by SSE,
scheduled for Nov. 9, at 395 Page Mill
Road in the AOL building. Accord
ing to its online menu, the shop will
feature Blue Bottle coffee as well as
sandwiches and dessert options.
Though no bills were presented
for voting at the meeting, a member
of the Stanford Baha'i Club was on
hand to inform the Senate about a
bill for next week in support of Ba
ha'is in Iran.
The bill would state ASSU Sen
ate support of equal education op
portunities for all members of Iran
ian society; it would also protest a
recent crackdown by the Iranian
government on Baha'is in Iran. Ba
ha'is are a group traditionally perse

cuted in Iran, and the Baha'i club
hopes that Stanford's rejection of
the tactics of the Iranian govern
ment will have an effect on the poli
cies within Iran.

Senators expressed support for
the bill. Senator Brianna Pang 'l3

suggested that the Senate co-sign
any letters written to President John
Hennessy requesting his action on
the issue.
