## PROFILE Boahen's brainchild 
### MADELINE SIDES 
When was the last time
your smartphone
outsmarted you?
Did it scan a barcode
on a billboard, re
mind you to do your laundry or rec
ognize a new song on the radio? Re
cent advances in technology make
it seem like our computers and
phones could quickly surpass our
brains' computing power, if they
haven't already. But Kwabena Boa
hen, associate professor of bioengi
neering, would quickly argue that
there are faults in that belief.
Boahen is the leader of the Neu
rogrid project in neuromorphic en
gineering at Stanford, where re
searchers are working to create a
computer system that works more
like the human brain efficiently
and with energy consciousness.
"There is a certain elegance that
I see in the brain that I want to be
able to capture," Boahen said.
A human brain generates infor
mation traffic 1,000 times greater
than the global Internet, yet it is
able to operate on 10 watts of
power. Current computers would
require about 10 megawatts of en
ergy to compute like our brains do,
according to Boahen.
"Right now, when we model the
brain with a computer it is very inef
ficient, and it takes a supercomput
er to carry out the computations,"
Boahen said. "With Neurogrid, we
are not trying to build a new kind of
supercomputer. We are creating a
machine that solves just one kind of
problem."
That problem is how to efficient
ly model and study the human
brain.

Neurogrid is a collection of sili
con chips with transistors that di
rectly simulate the electrical cur
rent flowing across a neuron's
membrane in the brain. The transis
tors are connected, modeling neu
ron interactions and networks. The
hardware is coupled with three lay
ers of software, allowing re
searchers to model different cells in

the brain and their electrical activi
ty. Just 16 small chips assembled on
a board can simulate 1 million neu
rons.

Boahen has been working at
Stanford since 2006, but his interest
in the intersection of computing
and neuroscience came from influ
ences far earlier in his life.

"I was one of those guys who was
always hacking stuff as a kid," Boa
hen said. "I got my first computer
when I was a teenager, more like a
glorified calculator really. But I did
n't want to take it apart, it was in
timidating."
He turned to the library to figure
out how computers work and came
to realize that they were actually
quite inefficient.
"I thought it was so ridiculous:
you start with ones and zeros and
you have to constantly go fetch
things from the memory," Boahen
said. "So I thought there had to be a
better way than all of that, but at the
time I didn't really know much
about how the brain worked."
When Boahen was an under
graduate in electrical engineering
at Johns Hopkins University, the
scientific world was interested in
neural networks, or how neurons in
the brain interact and communicate
signals. He found this area of neuro
science intriguing, and this interest
stayed with him through his studies
at the California Institute of Tech
nology and work at the University
of Pennsylvania to his position at
Stanford. He considers the devel
opment and implementation of
neuromorphic technologies to be
his true professional calling and
plans to dedicate his career to the
field.

Boahen and his team recently
received a Transformative Re
search Project award from the Na
tional Institutes of Health to re
search potential applications for
Neurogrid technologies. He be
lieves that neuromorphic engineer
ing could be useful in the healthcare
field, namely for improving the use

of artificial limbs. Boahen cited the
many survivors of foreign wars who
return home with serious injuries or
lost limbs as potential beneficiaries
of this technology.
With this grant, Boahen and his
team will work during the next five
years to develop a chip that receives
signals from the human brain and
transmits them to wirelessly control
a robotic prosthetic limb. The com
putation required for these tasks is
complex, and for such a chip to be
implanted into a patient's brain, it
must have extensive computing ca
pabilities in a small, energy-effi
cient package. This is where Neuro
grid technology comes into play
Boahen's theoretical developments
in neuromorphic devices would
allow patients to live more inde
pendently, giving them high-pow
ered technology in the most effi
cient form possible.
Boahen's research is inspira
tional to many at Stanford, and the
potential applications of his work
touch many disciplines.
"[The lab's work is] paving the
way for novel computation models
that might help us overcome the
memory bandwidth limitation
faced today in general purpose
computing," said second-year elec
trical engineering master's student
Swadesh Choudhary, who works in
Boahen's lab.

"He strives for perfection in
everything he does and motivates
his students to do the same,"
Choudhary added.
While his list of accomplish
ments is long even early in his ca
reer and the implications of his re
search are potentially life changing
for many, Boahen remains ground
ed in the spirit of pure scientific in
quiry.
"Me, I'm just curious, I like the
intellectual challenge," he said.
"Figuring out how stuff works ...
that's satisfying."

With this grant, Boahen and his
team will work during the next five
years to develop a chip that receives
signals from the human brain and
transmits them to wirelessly control
a robotic prosthetic limb. The com
putation required for these tasks is
complex, and for such a chip to be
implanted into a patient's brain, it
must have extensive computing ca
pabilities in a small, energy-effi

Boahen's theoretical developments
in neuromorphic devices would
allow patients to live more inde

Boahen's research is inspira

potential applications of his work
touch many disciplines.
"[The lab's work is] paving the
way for novel computation models

Swadesh Choudhary, who works in
Boahen's lab.

"He strives for perfection in
everything he does and motivates
his students to do the same,"
Choudhary added.

When was the last time
your smartphone
outsmarted you?
Did it scan a barcode
on a billboard, re
mind you to do your laundry or rec
ognize a new song on the radio? Re
cent advances in technology make
it seem like our computers and
phones could quickly surpass our
brains' computing power, if they
haven't already. But Kwabena Boa
hen, associate professor of bioengi
neering, would quickly argue that
there are faults in that belief.
Boahen is the leader of the Neu
rogrid project in neuromorphic en
gineering at Stanford, where re
searchers are working to create a
computer system that works more
like the human brain efficiently
and with energy consciousness.
"There is a certain elegance that
I see in the brain that I want to be
able to capture," Boahen said.
A human brain generates infor
mation traffic 1,000 times greater
than the global Internet, yet it is
able to operate on 10 watts of
power. Current computers would
require about 10 megawatts of en
ergy to compute like our brains do,
according to Boahen.
"Right now, when we model the
brain with a computer it is very inef
ficient, and it takes a supercomput
er to carry out the computations,"
Boahen said. "With Neurogrid, we
are not trying to build a new kind of
supercomputer. We are creating a
machine that solves just one kind of
problem."
That problem is how to efficient
ly model and study the human
brain.

Neurogrid is a collection of sili
con chips with transistors that di
rectly simulate the electrical cur
rent flowing across a neuron's
membrane in the brain. The transis
tors are connected, modeling neu
ron interactions and networks. The
hardware is coupled with three lay
ers of software, allowing re
searchers to model different cells in

the brain and their electrical activi
ty. Just 16 small chips assembled on
a board can simulate 1 million neu
rons.

Boahen has been working at
Stanford since 2006, but his interest
in the intersection of computing
and neuroscience came from influ
ences far earlier in his life.

"I was one of those guys who was
always hacking stuff as a kid," Boa
hen said. "I got my first computer
when I was a teenager, more like a
glorified calculator really. But I did
n't want to take it apart, it was in
timidating."
He turned to the library to figure
out how computers work and came
to realize that they were actually
quite inefficient.
"I thought it was so ridiculous:
you start with ones and zeros and
you have to constantly go fetch
things from the memory," Boahen
said. "So I thought there had to be a
better way than all of that, but at the
time I didn't really know much
about how the brain worked."
When Boahen was an under
graduate in electrical engineering
at Johns Hopkins University, the
scientific world was interested in
neural networks, or how neurons in
the brain interact and communicate
signals. He found this area of neuro
science intriguing, and this interest
stayed with him through his studies
at the California Institute of Tech
nology and work at the University
of Pennsylvania to his position at
Stanford. He considers the devel
opment and implementation of
neuromorphic technologies to be
his true professional calling and
plans to dedicate his career to the
field.

Boahen and his team recently
received a Transformative Re
search Project award from the Na
tional Institutes of Health to re
search potential applications for
Neurogrid technologies. He be
lieves that neuromorphic engineer
ing could be useful in the healthcare
field, namely for improving the use

of artificial limbs. Boahen cited the
many survivors of foreign wars who
return home with serious injuries or
lost limbs as potential beneficiaries
of this technology.
With this grant, Boahen and his
team will work during the next five
years to develop a chip that receives
signals from the human brain and
transmits them to wirelessly control
a robotic prosthetic limb. The com
putation required for these tasks is
