## Local teaching, global thinking 
### LESLIE NGUYEN-OKWU 
Sleepy students filled a lecture hall
on the first morning of a Global
Human Geography lecture, a popu
lar class taught by history lecturer
Martin Lewis. At the end of his class,
Lewis stopped to play the infamous "Miss
South Carolina answers a question"
You Tube video from the 2007 Miss Teen
USA beauty pageant. Suddenly, ears were at
attention as students watched a contestant
struggle to explain why she thought a fifth of
Americans couldn't locate the United States
on a world map.
"People out there in our nation don't
have maps," she responded.
A roar of laughter burst from the class
room.

Lewis had a different take. Unfortunate
ly, he said, the video's suggestion that Amer
ican society is largely unaware of interna
tional issues is far from funny.
But the Stanford Human Rights Educa
tion (SHRE) Initiative hopes to fill this gap
with a "fresh and surprising" approach to
human rights education.
Teaming up with community colleges, the
Stanford Program on International and
Cross-Cultural Education (SPICE), which
has partnered with the Program on Human
Rights, the School of Education and the Di
vision of International Comparative and
Area Studies (ICA), aims to create a human
rights curriculum and build a network of
support among educators.
"It's an outreach effort through Stanford
University by a coalition of departments,"
said Robert Wessling, associate director for
the Center for Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies, which is also partnering
with SPICE. "We're finding out that there
are so many different ways to include human
rights into a classroom and into so many dif
ferent kinds of disciplinary studies. So,
there's not really a one size-fits-all, like a
master curriculum of human rights."
Support for the initiative expanded when
40 community colleges attended a confer
ence called "Teaching Human Rights in a
Global Context" last summer. From there, a
team of eight fellows from Bay Area com
munity colleges were selected to develop the
curriculum, website and another conference
for the SHRE Initiative.

"We're not telling students how to feel
about what is going on in the world," said
Timothy Maxwell, an English professor at
the College of San Mateo and SHRE Fellow.
"We understand that in order for students to
authentically understand human rights and
their international violations, they have to
feel on some level what it means for some
one's human rights to be violated. They're
becoming agents of change and not just con
sumers of our message."
According to Maxwell, the use of tech
nology has resulted in less awareness among
students about international issues.
"Global awareness is far down the list of
priorities when you've got to check Face
book and Twitter, 10 text messages coming
in, videos to play and music to download,"

Maxwell said. "I think it's always been a
problem to get young people to be aware of
things that are so far away from their experi
ences, but increasingly, the real estate in
young people minds is being gobbled up by
things that may not matter as much."
The four-year SHRE Initiative curricu
lum will provide community college educa
tors with resources to integrate human
rights into their teaching.
"In the U.S. today, only about 8 percent of
people even know that there's a Universal
Declaration of Human Rights," said Jonas
Edman, a curriculum writer for SPICE.
" [The curriculum] is a framework for view
ing other countries and the United States.
It's a critical examination where students
have to reflect on what they believe
what's right, what's wrong and the gray areas
in between. It can provide a lens that is very
useful for understanding the world."
Maxwell praised Stanford's decision to
focus on community colleges, noting that it
allows the SHRE Initiative to reach a more
diverse population of students than if it were
only at Stanford.
"Community colleges serve a very large
cross section of our society," Maxwell said.
"A great number of students go through
community colleges, and I think it's also a
neglected part of our education system."
Helen Stacy, a senior fellow at the Free
man Spogli Institute for International Stud
ies (FSI) also played a large role in develop
ing the goals of the project. She argued that
it is important for Stanford to play a larger
role in the Bay Area educational communi
ty-

"We want Stanford to be a resource in
our own community," Stacy said. "We want
colleges in the Bay Area to benefit from the
presence of Stanford. We have so much ex
pertise and convening power, and we need
to share it."

As with many others involved in the
SHRE Initiative, Stacy believes that all stu
dents have the capacity to affect global
change.
"Human rights work is endlessly fascinat
ing, and to work with students is intensely re
warding because it's the students who are
curious, receptive and have the energy to
take an idea and then stand together with
other students to make change," Stacy said.
Through a human rights perspective,
Stacy wants students to become more
"aware and alive" as global citizens and en
courages students to work for "social
progress" and human rights reform.
"My goal is for every student to learn
about human rights so that they become
emissaries of human rights in their everyday
life," Stacy said. "Human dignity and empa
thy for others is something that we all have
responsibility for, and we each have differ
ent means at our disposal for meeting that
responsibility. I want to see human rights as
the platform for which we see the world."

Edman, a curriculum writer for SPICE.
" [The curriculum] is a framework for view
ing other countries and the United States.
It's a critical examination where students
have to reflect on what they believe
what's right, what's wrong and the gray areas
in between. It can provide a lens that is very
useful for understanding the world."
Maxwell praised Stanford's decision to
focus on community colleges, noting that it
allows the SHRE Initiative to reach a more
diverse population of students than if it were
only at Stanford.
"Community colleges serve a very large
cross section of our society," Maxwell said.
"A great number of students go through
community colleges, and I think it's also a
neglected part of our education system."
Helen Stacy, a senior fellow at the Free
man Spogli Institute for International Stud
ies (FSI) also played a large role in develop
ing the goals of the project. She argued that
it is important for Stanford to play a larger
role in the Bay Area educational communi
ty-

"We want Stanford to be a resource in
our own community," Stacy said. "We want
colleges in the Bay Area to benefit from the
presence of Stanford. We have so much ex
pertise and convening power, and we need
to share it."

As with many others involved in the
SHRE Initiative, Stacy believes that all stu
dents have the capacity to affect global
change.
"Human rights work is endlessly fascinat
ing, and to work with students is intensely re
warding because it's the students who are
curious, receptive and have the energy to
take an idea and then stand together with
other students to make change," Stacy said.
Through a human rights perspective,
Stacy wants students to become more
"aware and alive" as global citizens and en
courages students to work for "social
progress" and human rights reform.
"My goal is for every student to learn
about human rights so that they become
emissaries of human rights in their everyday
life," Stacy said. "Human dignity and empa
thy for others is something that we all have
responsibility for, and we each have differ
ent means at our disposal for meeting that
responsibility. I want to see human rights as
the platform for which we see the world."

Sleepy students filled a lecture hall
on the first morning of a Global
Human Geography lecture, a popu
lar class taught by history lecturer
Martin Lewis. At the end of his class,
Lewis stopped to play the infamous "Miss
South Carolina answers a question"
You Tube video from the 2007 Miss Teen
USA beauty pageant. Suddenly, ears were at
attention as students watched a contestant
struggle to explain why she thought a fifth of
Americans couldn't locate the United States
on a world map.
"People out there in our nation don't
have maps," she responded.
A roar of laughter burst from the class
room.

Lewis had a different take. Unfortunate
ly, he said, the video's suggestion that Amer
ican society is largely unaware of interna
tional issues is far from funny.
But the Stanford Human Rights Educa
tion (SHRE) Initiative hopes to fill this gap
with a "fresh and surprising" approach to
human rights education.
Teaming up with community colleges, the
Stanford Program on International and
Cross-Cultural Education (SPICE), which
has partnered with the Program on Human
Rights, the School of Education and the Di
vision of International Comparative and
Area Studies (ICA), aims to create a human
rights curriculum and build a network of
support among educators.
"It's an outreach effort through Stanford
University by a coalition of departments,"
said Robert Wessling, associate director for
the Center for Russian, East European and
Eurasian Studies, which is also partnering
with SPICE. "We're finding out that there
are so many different ways to include human
rights into a classroom and into so many dif
ferent kinds of disciplinary studies. So,
there's not really a one size-fits-all, like a
master curriculum of human rights."
Support for the initiative expanded when
40 community colleges attended a confer
ence called "Teaching Human Rights in a
Global Context" last summer. From there, a
team of eight fellows from Bay Area com
munity colleges were selected to develop the
curriculum, website and another conference
for the SHRE Initiative.

"We're not telling students how to feel
about what is going on in the world," said
Timothy Maxwell, an English professor at
the College of San Mateo and SHRE Fellow.
"We understand that in order for students to
authentically understand human rights and
their international violations, they have to
feel on some level what it means for some
one's human rights to be violated. They're
becoming agents of change and not just con
sumers of our message."
According to Maxwell, the use of tech
nology has resulted in less awareness among
students about international issues.
"Global awareness is far down the list of
priorities when you've got to check Face
book and Twitter, 10 text messages coming
in, videos to play and music to download,"

Maxwell said. "I think it's always been a
problem to get young people to be aware of
things that are so far away from their experi
ences, but increasingly, the real estate in
young people minds is being gobbled up by
things that may not matter as much."
The four-year SHRE Initiative curricu
lum will provide community college educa
tors with resources to integrate human
rights into their teaching.
"In the U.S. today, only about 8 percent of
people even know that there's a Universal
Declaration of Human Rights," said Jonas
Edman, a curriculum writer for SPICE.
" [The curriculum] is a framework for view
ing other countries and the United States.
It's a critical examination where students
have to reflect on what they believe
what's right, what's wrong and the gray areas
in between. It can provide a lens that is very
useful for understanding the world."
