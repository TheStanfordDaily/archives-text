## Bart Thompson: A bike-a-thon's benefits 
### LINDA YU 
"Weve got the information in the information age, but do we know
what life is like outside of our convenient Lexus cages?"

This line from Switchfoot's song,
"Gone," is one that resonates with
Bart Thompson 'l2. After witness
ing life beyond "Lexus cages" dur
ing a service trip to Guatemala in
2007, Thompson combined his passion for
service with his athletic talent by spearhead
ing two 335-mile bicycling campaigns
through Michigan. His efforts have raised
nearly $40,000, funds that have gone toward
providing food for children in Guatemala and
building schools in Haiti.
The summer before his senior year of high
school, Thompson travelled to Guatemala as
part of a school service trip, where he served
as a teaching assistant for a class of second
graders and helped improve the school facili
ties. The particular school he worked at was
located in close proximity to a garbage dump,

and Thompson was struck by the way this dic
tated the daily lifestyle.

"One of the walls of the school was also
part of the wall of a garbage dump,"Thompson
said. "People literally live, grow, work and die
in the dump."
He was also appalled by the degree of
poverty he witnessed.
"They took us to this woman's house, which
was literally a tin shack that housed her, her
daughter, her mother and her husband," he said.
"The temperature gets up in the hundreds, the
mother is old and sick and the woman herself
has cancer, but they still said that they were not
poor enough to qualify for a house."
"If that's not poor enough, then what is?"
he added.

Thompson left Guatemala inspired to pur
sue further service.

"I go back to the whole idea that how
much is given correlates with how much is ex
pected," he said. "You need to take the gifts
you were given, and ask yourself, 'What can I
do with them?"'

For Thompson, it was taking advantage of
his athletic ability. He was originally a recruit
ed rower, but was injured freshman year. He
ended up spending a lot of time training on
the spin bike and began cycling at the end of
that year. Around that time, he also learned
about a "Ride Against AIDS" fundraiser or
ganized by FACE AIDS and decided that he
wanted to do something similar.
Thompson approached International
Samaritan (IS), a Michigan-based nonprofit
he had previously worked with, and pitched
his project.
"IS gave me free rein to set it up," he said.
"They gave me the license to create it the way
I wanted to."

With the project underway, Thompson
then contacted a few of his friends from high
school some of whom had travelled to
Guatemala with him to see if they were in
terested in organizing the biking and finan
cial aspects of the ride.
The group, teamed up with IS, wrote let
ters asking for donations, publicizing the
"bike-a-thon" and finalizing the 335-mile
route from Ann Arbor to Harbor Springs.
Since IS was working on building 18 schools
in Haiti at the time, Thompson decided to di
rect the funds the race raised toward support
ing that cause.

"We did fundraising on our own, a donor
matched the amount we collected and we
ended up raising $20,000," he said. "This was
enough to build four schools."
Thompson followed last year's successes
with another bicycle campaign this year.
"It wasn't likely we were going to find an
other matching donor, so we wanted to work
toward smaller goals that would add up," he
said. "The IS told us they were starting a new
hunger and nutrition program in Guatemala,
so this year's bike-a-thon was publicized as
'Biking for Bowls."'
According to IS, $lOO is enough to provide
a year's worth of school lunch for a child. So
far, Thompson has collected approximately
$15,000.
IS Executive Director Oscar Dussan ap
plauded Thompson for his relentless spirit.
"Bart is the only one who year after year
has been successful," he said. "He's a leader
and he's very visible. So when he speaks, peo
ple will listen. He's also doing something for
someone who will really remember his ac
tions."

While Thompson has not returned to
Guatemala since his 2007 trip, he hopes that
his efforts will show that it is still possible and
essential to make an impact here at home.
"We have the responsibility to improve
the lives of others who are in situations where
they can't necessarily help themselves," he
said. "It's a part of humanity."

According to IS, $lOO is enough to provide
a year's worth of school lunch for a child. So
far, Thompson has collected approximately
$15,000.
IS Executive Director Oscar Dussan ap
plauded Thompson for his relentless spirit.
"Bart is the only one who year after year
has been successful," he said. "He's a leader
and he's very visible. So when he speaks, peo
ple will listen. He's also doing something for
someone who will really remember his ac
tions."

While Thompson has not returned to
Guatemala since his 2007 trip, he hopes that
his efforts will show that it is still possible and
essential to make an impact here at home.
"We have the responsibility to improve
the lives of others who are in situations where
they can't necessarily help themselves," he
said. "It's a part of humanity."
