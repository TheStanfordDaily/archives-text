## Do's AND Doo-Doo's Spoiler Alert: Everything turns out great 
### Chase Ishii 
Today's advice is especially
great because it gives you a
reason to procrastinate on
that midterm paper you've been
working on.

DO: Google "Fred Armisen
Commencement Speech."
DOO-DOO: Not watch the
video that comes up.

I recently watched a commence
ment speech delivered by Fred
Armisen at Oregon Episcopal
High School this past June. Fred
Armisen is a comedian known for
his roles on "Saturday Night Live"
and "Portlandia" and is famous for
being the most ethnically ambigu
ous person of all time. (Seriously,
he's played everyone from Presi
dent Obama to Steve Jobs to Sad
dam Hussein to Nooni the Swedish
husband of Nuni to a giggly Japan
ese schoolgirl to the glasses kid
from Glee.)

If you've ever given a speech in
public, you understand the difficult
necessity of presenting virtuous
substance in an entertaining and
thought-provoking manner. Too
much funny, and no one knows what
you're trying to say. Too much seri
ous, and no one cares what you're
trying to say. (My high school grad
uation speech fell into the former,
littered with short-people jokes and
an extended reading and analysis of
the song "I'm On A Boat" by The
Lonely Island, feat. T-Pain.)
Armisen did a great job capti
vating the audience with advice
and well-placed humor, but still
managed to carry a bold thesis with
his speech. "My message to you is
this: no matter what happens,
everything turns out great. I prom
ise you. It all turns out great." I
wondered how responsible it was
to tell high school seniors that.
Sure, it sounds comforting and en
couraging and gives that warm,
happy millions-of-fireflies-let
loose-in-your-chest sort of feeling,
but does it really help prepare
them for real life? And most im
portantly, is it true?

It almost seems arrogant and
self-absorbed. Oh sure, the success
ful comedian who made it to the big
times is assuring me that everything
will work out great. (It bugged me
the way it bugs me when incredible
singers assure people that "anyone
can sing.") But then Armisen con
tinued on with a brief history of his
life. He got rejected from NYU's
film school and ended up going to a
small visual arts school, which
changed the way he perceived art.
He dropped out of that school to
play drums in a band that watched
so many other bands get their big
break while he was stuck playing
empty clubs.
As a diversion to his struggling
music career and seemingly unat
tainable dreams, he began doing
stand-up comedy . . . and it all
turned out great.
I think I agree with Armisen. No
matter what happens, everything
turns out great. It is true if we allow
it to be true. But I think it requires
a shift in philosophy. So often we
are concerned with where we are
going in life and less concerned
with whom we are becoming. (I
don't know if it's who or whom in
that last sentence, but the green
squiggly on the screen went away
with "whom.")

There's something commend-

able about desiring a specific goal
and achieving it through dedica
tion and perseverance. But we do
ourselves a disservice if we are not
open and willing to changing and
re-evaluating what would be con
sidered a worthy outcome for our
lives. Tunnel vision that strips the
definition of "great" down to one
specific situation or scenario is
doomed to failure from the start.

I dream of becoming a brilliant
screenwriter, but the fact of the
matter is that it may not happen
for reasons beyond my control. No
matter how talented or persistent
I am and no matter how many
dues I pay, the reality of the enter
tainment industry is that I may
never get a break. But even if I
can't be a screenwriter in Holly
wood, I'll always be something to
someone somewhere. Maybe a
husband or a father or a neighbor
or a son whatever the case,
there will always be a reality in
front of me that deserves my at
tention and appreciation.
What would happen if instead
of answering "a screenwriter," I
completed the statement: "In 10
years, it would be great if I could be

..." with character attributes? It
would be great if I could be gener
ous. Or patient. Appreciative.
Loyal. Forgiving. Encouraging.
Loving. Joyful. (Taller.) These are
all things that I can control: I can
actively and intentionally take
steps towards becoming them
every day (except the taller part.
There's nothing I can do about that
... according to 50,000,000 Google
search results.)

Things never go according to
plan. Your future will never be per
fect. But if you concern yourself
less with what you'll be in the fu
ture and more with how you'll be in
the future, then no matter what
happens, I promise you, everything
will turn out great.

But seriously, Chase really wants to
get taller. Email him with tips at

his roles on "Saturday Night Live"
and "Portlandia" and is famous for
being the most ethnically ambigu
ous person of all time. (Seriously,
he's played everyone from Presi
dent Obama to Steve Jobs to Sad
dam Hussein to Nooni the Swedish
husband of Nuni to a giggly Japan
ese schoolgirl to the glasses kid
from Glee.)

If you've ever given a speech in
public, you understand the difficult
necessity of presenting virtuous
substance in an entertaining and
thought-provoking manner. Too
much funny, and no one knows what
you're trying to say. Too much seri
ous, and no one cares what you're
trying to say. (My high school grad
uation speech fell into the former,
littered with short-people jokes and
an extended reading and analysis of
the song "I'm On A Boat" by The
Lonely Island, feat. T-Pain.)
Armisen did a great job capti
vating the audience with advice
and well-placed humor, but still
managed to carry a bold thesis with
his speech. "My message to you is
this: no matter what happens,
everything turns out great. I prom
ise you. It all turns out great." I
wondered how responsible it was
to tell high school seniors that.
Sure, it sounds comforting and en
couraging and gives that warm,
happy millions-of-fireflies-let
loose-in-your-chest sort of feeling,
but does it really help prepare
them for real life? And most im
portantly, is it true?

It almost seems arrogant and
self-absorbed. Oh sure, the success
ful comedian who made it to the big
times is assuring me that everything
will work out great. (It bugged me
the way it bugs me when incredible
singers assure people that "anyone
can sing.") But then Armisen con
tinued on with a brief history of his
life. He got rejected from NYU's
film school and ended up going to a
small visual arts school, which
changed the way he perceived art.
He dropped out of that school to
play drums in a band that watched
so many other bands get their big
break while he was stuck playing
empty clubs.
As a diversion to his struggling
music career and seemingly unat
tainable dreams, he began doing
stand-up comedy . . . and it all
turned out great.
I think I agree with Armisen. No
matter what happens, everything
turns out great. It is true if we allow
it to be true. But I think it requires
a shift in philosophy. So often we
are concerned with where we are
going in life and less concerned
with whom we are becoming. (I
don't know if it's who or whom in
that last sentence, but the green
squiggly on the screen went away
with "whom.")

There's something commend-

able about desiring a specific goal
and achieving it through dedica
tion and perseverance. But we do
ourselves a disservice if we are not
open and willing to changing and
re-evaluating what would be con
sidered a worthy outcome for our
lives. Tunnel vision that strips the
definition of "great" down to one
specific situation or scenario is
doomed to failure from the start.

I dream of becoming a brilliant
screenwriter, but the fact of the
matter is that it may not happen
for reasons beyond my control. No
matter how talented or persistent
I am and no matter how many
dues I pay, the reality of the enter
tainment industry is that I may
never get a break. But even if I
can't be a screenwriter in Holly
wood, I'll always be something to
someone somewhere. Maybe a
husband or a father or a neighbor
or a son whatever the case,
there will always be a reality in
front of me that deserves my at
tention and appreciation.
What would happen if instead
of answering "a screenwriter," I
completed the statement: "In 10
years, it would be great if I could be

..." with character attributes? It
would be great if I could be gener
ous. Or patient. Appreciative.
Loyal. Forgiving. Encouraging.
Loving. Joyful. (Taller.) These are
all things that I can control: I can
actively and intentionally take
steps towards becoming them
every day (except the taller part.
There's nothing I can do about that
... according to 50,000,000 Google
search results.)

Things never go according to
plan. Your future will never be per
fect. But if you concern yourself
less with what you'll be in the fu
ture and more with how you'll be in
the future, then no matter what
happens, I promise you, everything
will turn out great.

But seriously, Chase really wants to
get taller. Email him with tips at
