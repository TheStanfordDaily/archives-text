# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## The 						tricks and treats of Halloween 
### Leslie Brian 
Forget midterms. For the past
month, my Halloween costume
has been the major source of
stress in my life.

When I first arrived at Stanford, it
had been four years since I had actu
ally dressed up for Halloween I
had given up costumes along with
trick-or-treating as a high school
freshman. Boy, was I in for a shock!
Unlike the carefree days of child
hood when I relished dressing up as
a picnic table or as the Y2K bug, I
was suddenly confronted by the
quintessential female dilemma be
tween a costume that says, "I'm hot
but have no self-respect" versus "I'm
clever but sadly unattractive." As
Lindsay Lohan quipped of her fe
male peers, on Halloween, "the
hardcore girls just wear lingerie and
some form of animal ears." In an
ideal world, we'd have that perfect
intersection of clever enough to be
spunky and stand out, but still cute
and pretty. But it's such a fine line to
walk, and one that expends a huge
amount of mental energy.
I had to adapt quickly. Living on a
campus that is undeniably obsessed
with costumes means that I've been
to more themed parties than I can
count. At one point during sopho
more year, I was probably in costume
more evenings than not! So, Hal
loween costumes aren't exactly un
charted territory for students who dig
through their rally boxes for Band
Run, special dinners and progressives

on an almost daily basis. (In fact, I'm
pretty much convinced that one of
the secret requirements for all Stan
ford admits is a latent passion for
dressing up in crazy costumes.)

Costumes should be and are!
fun. It's our own obsession with
looking good and hooking up that has
superimposed all this stress on dress
ing up. Yes, Halloween does give us
carte blanche to be as slutty or as ir
reverent as we want, but that's not the
main reason behind its appeal.
Clear away all the partying and
sexuality around costumes, and what
we're left with is the pure essence of
childhood. Most all of us had "dress
up boxes" of costume jewelry and
fake fur! And I'm pretty sure that rif
fling through your family scrapbook
will ultimately produce a picture of
your one-year-old swaddled in a
pumpkin costume whose contours
matched your chubby cheeks. On
Halloween night, I distinctly remem
ber the unbridled ecstasy of being al
lowed to stay out late that almost ri
valed my anticipation of Christmas
Eve. And don't even get me started
on the massive candy swap the next
day at school! It was like Wall Street
had suddenly invaded the lunch
room! (As I recall, demand ran high
for Snickers and Reese's while
Mounds always got sidelined.)

Those are the memories that Hal
loween conjures up for me. But it rep
resents something far greater.
Putting on a Halloween costume is
like catching a glimpse of your child
hood self. It harkens back to the illus
trious "golden era of childhood,"
when things were actually a lot sim
pler than they are now.

The comfort we can derive from
childhood memories is unbelievably
powerful. Although some people
have more than others, it's pretty rare
to find a person completely devoid of
a single, cheesy, happy-go-lucky child
hood memory; we all have something
to draw upon for comfort. Whether
it's a favorite childhood book that
you've read too many times to count
(for me, anything by Roald Dahl) or
watching your favorite Disney movie
and belting out every song lyric, we
channel our childhoods in so many
different ways. There are times when
I come home for winter break and sit
down to an eight-hour marathon of
playing Age of Empires on my old
desktop computer. Whenever I see
someone doing a jigsaw puzzle, I liter
ally cannot contain my joy. And no

matter what, tree-climbing will al
ways remain one of my favorite activ
ities of all time.

There's a reason why adults re
turn to the things they loved as part
of their childhood. That kid who was
always digging in the sandbox might
end up as a famous archaeologist,
and the sports you loved as a child
are often the ones you'll enjoy
throughout your life. When you re
connect with what you loved as a
child, you're actually more able to
enjoy life as an adult!

So whether it's keeping a stuffed
animal you've had since you were two
on your bed or playing a favorite fam
ily board game or turning your pas
sion for creepy critters into a career,
find away to channel your childhood
into your life. When you do recall
those happiest of memories, you set
tle into your healthiest mentality.
Getting in touch with your childhood
self doesn't mean you're immature,
it's a part of identifying your true self!
Even though my next Halloween
won't be on the Farm, I don't doubt
that the underlying tensions will stay
the same. And while it's hard to avoid
playing into the roles that our cos
tumes typecast for us, I always think
about my four-year-old self.
Would she really want me to wear
that?
That's what I thought.
