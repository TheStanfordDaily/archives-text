## BACK ON THE COURT 
### CAROLINE CASELLI DESK EDITOR 
Last fall, in the wake of Landry Fields' depar
ture to the NBA, the Cardinal debuted a new-look
squad that featured six scholarship freshmen (and
another walk-on who saw ample action) but no
seniors. Slated to pick ninth in the then-Pac-10,
outside expectations were low for the young
bunch with many expecting last season to serve as
a major rebuilding year.
Twelve months later, the same team minus
would-be senior Jeremy Green, who left Stanford
last spring to enter the NBA draft returns to
Maples Pavilion with an added year of maturity,
team chemistry and international experience
thanks to a team trip to Spain and hopes of taking

the newly created Pac-12 by storm.
"We are very excited about this season," said
head coach Johnny Dawkins at the Pac-12 Media
Day on Oct. 28. "Our kids, they have done a great
job this preseason of working hard to get better. I
thought it started last spring, it continued through
the summer and through our trip to Spain, in
which our team got closer."
"We grew a lot from that experience, and we're
just very excited about starting this upcoming sea
son," he added.
Though Green's absence leaves some uncer
tainty— he was the team's leading scorer with
16.7 points per game and named to All-Pac-10
First Team sophomores Anthony Brown and
Dwight Powell are expected to step into the pri
mary scoring roles. Indeed, much of the Card's
success will depend upon how much the seven
man sophomore class improved over the break,
particularly the two Pac-10 All-Freshman Team
selections.

Brown was one of 12 collegiate players named
to the USA Basketball Ul9 World Championship
Team over the summer and traveled to Latvia to
play amongst the international elite. Finishing his
freshman season as the Card's third-leading scor
er with 8.7 points per game (Powell was next best
with 8.1 points per game), and second-best from
behind the three-point arc, Brown will be a pri
mary scoring option from the wing.
Powell, a versatile 6-9 forward who can score
from the perimeter and can hold his own down
low, had several brilliant offensive and defensive
games last season, but will have to perform more
consistently this season.
Additionally, the Cardinal now boasts four sen
iors Jarre tt Mann, Josh Owens, Jack Trotter and
Andrew Zimmermann who will share the cap
tain duties this season.
"We have very good leadership, probably the
best leadership that we've had since I've been
there," Dawkins said. "And I'm really proud of
what these young men have done in the senior
class to make sure that we're all on the same page
and all understand the culture that we want to
have at Stanford."
One source of this leadership is sure to be the
team's most veteran player, Owens, who redshirt
ed in his third year at the Farm and will likely be
the team's starting center once again. Stanford's
second-leading scorer last year with 11.8 points
per game, he was Stanford's most dominant low
post presence, leading in both rebounds (201 total,
6.5 rebounds per game) and blocks (29 total, 0.9
per game).

Both Zimmermann and Trotter as well as
sophomore Stefan Nastic, who sat out for the bulk
of last season with a foot injury are expected to
assist Owens in the paint off the bench.
Mann, the only player aside from Green and
Owens who started in all 31 games last season, will
likely play off the ball in the shooting guard posi
tion, a more natural fit for the 6-4 senior who has
fallen into point guard duties over the past two
seasons.

Mann has established himself as a fierce de
fender with strong court vision he led last year's
team with 30 steals and 130 assists though he
may be called upon to shoot more than he has in
previous seasons.

However, amongst the sea of veterans, one un
familiar face on the sideline is expected to con
tribute right away. Highly touted freshman Chas
son Randle, a 6-1 point guard who was named the
Gatorade Illinois Basketball Player of the Year as
a senior, made an instant impact on the team's trip
to Spain in September, when he led the team in
scoring in multiple games and was praised by the
foreign teams' coaches.
"When I first saw Chasson, I thought he was a
winner," Dawkins said. "His team, of course, won
the state last season so he comes from a winning
culture. His team was terrific, and he led them."
"I also saw a young man who was very versatile
in his play, whether it's being able to knock down
a shot from outside, whether it was taking the ball
to the basket and creating shots for himself or his
teammates, he had that innate ability to make that
play," he added. "A very unselfish player, just only
out there looking to make his teammates better,
but at the same time he has the ability to attack
and create on his own as well."

Randle will also have support from sophomore
Aaron Bright, a player that Dawkins referred to as
"our most improved player that is returning."
Bright, a streaky three-point shooter last season,
was second in assists, with an average of two per
game.

Altogether, the Cardinal will be looking to im
prove on last year's seventh-place finish in confer
ence, with No. 16 Arizona, No. 17 UCLA and No.
24 Cal headlining the Pac-12 class this season. In a
preseason coaches' poll, Stanford was picked to
finish sixth in the conference.

The Cardinal will open its season this Saturday,
Nov. sth in Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m. in an exhibi
tion game against Ryerson.

mary scoring option from the wing.
Powell, a versatile 6-9 forward who can score
from the perimeter and can hold his own down
low, had several brilliant offensive and defensive
games last season, but will have to perform more
consistently this season.
Additionally, the Cardinal now boasts four sen
iors Jarre tt Mann, Josh Owens, Jack Trotter and
Andrew Zimmermann who will share the cap
tain duties this season.
"We have very good leadership, probably the
best leadership that we've had since I've been
there," Dawkins said. "And I'm really proud of
what these young men have done in the senior
class to make sure that we're all on the same page
and all understand the culture that we want to
have at Stanford."
One source of this leadership is sure to be the
team's most veteran player, Owens, who redshirt
ed in his third year at the Farm and will likely be
the team's starting center once again. Stanford's
second-leading scorer last year with 11.8 points
per game, he was Stanford's most dominant low
post presence, leading in both rebounds (201 total,
6.5 rebounds per game) and blocks (29 total, 0.9
per game).

Both Zimmermann and Trotter as well as
sophomore Stefan Nastic, who sat out for the bulk
of last season with a foot injury are expected to
assist Owens in the paint off the bench.
Mann, the only player aside from Green and
Owens who started in all 31 games last season, will
likely play off the ball in the shooting guard posi
tion, a more natural fit for the 6-4 senior who has
fallen into point guard duties over the past two
seasons.

Mann has established himself as a fierce de
fender with strong court vision he led last year's
team with 30 steals and 130 assists though he
may be called upon to shoot more than he has in
previous seasons.

However, amongst the sea of veterans, one un
familiar face on the sideline is expected to con
tribute right away. Highly touted freshman Chas
son Randle, a 6-1 point guard who was named the
Gatorade Illinois Basketball Player of the Year as
a senior, made an instant impact on the team's trip
to Spain in September, when he led the team in
scoring in multiple games and was praised by the
foreign teams' coaches.
"When I first saw Chasson, I thought he was a
winner," Dawkins said. "His team, of course, won
the state last season so he comes from a winning
culture. His team was terrific, and he led them."
"I also saw a young man who was very versatile
in his play, whether it's being able to knock down
a shot from outside, whether it was taking the ball
to the basket and creating shots for himself or his
teammates, he had that innate ability to make that
play," he added. "A very unselfish player, just only
out there looking to make his teammates better,
but at the same time he has the ability to attack
and create on his own as well."

Randle will also have support from sophomore
Aaron Bright, a player that Dawkins referred to as
"our most improved player that is returning."
Bright, a streaky three-point shooter last season,
was second in assists, with an average of two per
game.

Altogether, the Cardinal will be looking to im
prove on last year's seventh-place finish in confer
ence, with No. 16 Arizona, No. 17 UCLA and No.
24 Cal headlining the Pac-12 class this season. In a
preseason coaches' poll, Stanford was picked to
finish sixth in the conference.

The Cardinal will open its season this Saturday,
Nov. sth in Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m. in an exhibi
tion game against Ryerson.

Redshirt senior Josh Owens (above) and the
men's basketball team are hoping to take the
Pac- 12 by surprise this year after finishing tied for
seventh in the conference last season.
Last fall, in the wake of Landry Fields' depar
ture to the NBA, the Cardinal debuted a new-look
squad that featured six scholarship freshmen (and
another walk-on who saw ample action) but no
seniors. Slated to pick ninth in the then-Pac-10,
outside expectations were low for the young
bunch with many expecting last season to serve as
a major rebuilding year.
Twelve months later, the same team minus
would-be senior Jeremy Green, who left Stanford
last spring to enter the NBA draft returns to
Maples Pavilion with an added year of maturity,
team chemistry and international experience
thanks to a team trip to Spain and hopes of taking

the newly created Pac-12 by storm.
"We are very excited about this season," said
head coach Johnny Dawkins at the Pac-12 Media
Day on Oct. 28. "Our kids, they have done a great
job this preseason of working hard to get better. I
thought it started last spring, it continued through
the summer and through our trip to Spain, in
which our team got closer."
"We grew a lot from that experience, and we're
just very excited about starting this upcoming sea
son," he added.
Though Green's absence leaves some uncer
tainty— he was the team's leading scorer with
16.7 points per game and named to All-Pac-10
First Team sophomores Anthony Brown and
Dwight Powell are expected to step into the pri
mary scoring roles. Indeed, much of the Card's
success will depend upon how much the seven
man sophomore class improved over the break,
particularly the two Pac-10 All-Freshman Team
selections.

Brown was one of 12 collegiate players named
to the USA Basketball Ul9 World Championship
Team over the summer and traveled to Latvia to
play amongst the international elite. Finishing his
freshman season as the Card's third-leading scor
er with 8.7 points per game (Powell was next best
with 8.1 points per game), and second-best from
behind the three-point arc, Brown will be a pri
mary scoring option from the wing.
Powell, a versatile 6-9 forward who can score
from the perimeter and can hold his own down
low, had several brilliant offensive and defensive
games last season, but will have to perform more
consistently this season.
Additionally, the Cardinal now boasts four sen
iors Jarre tt Mann, Josh Owens, Jack Trotter and
