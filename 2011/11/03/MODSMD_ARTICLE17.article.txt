# TIME TO BOUNCE BACK
## Women's volleyball tries to rally after loss to UCLA 
### ANDERS MIKKELSEN 
Following a tough loss at the hands of No. 1 UCLA,
Stanford faces another challenge on the road against new
Pac-12 members Colorado and Utah. The Cardinal's last
meetings with each of the two teams went exceptionally
well, as Stanford picked up straight-set victories against
both squads, but repeating the sweep might be slightly
more difficult away from home.
No. 3 Stanford (17-4,11-4 Pac-12) hopes to prove that its
performance Saturday night was nothing but a momentary
blip in an otherwise terrific season and use the weekend se
ries to make up even more ground in the Pac-12 standings.
It currently sits two games back from top teams UCLA and
USC with just seven games to go.
The last showdown the Cardinal had with Colorado (5-
18,0-15) resulted in a dominant victory in which Stanford
hit .387 and won 25-14,25-15,25-15.The Buffaloes have lost
15 straight games but are looking to make Stanford's first
trip to their home court a tough one for the Cardinal. Last
Friday, they almost completed a memorable comeback
against Oregon State, winning the third and fourth sets be
fore falling in the fifth.
If Colorado is able to pull off an incredible upset, it will
most likely be due to the play of junior outside hitter Kerra
Schroeder and sophomore libero Megan Beckwith. In
their last matchup with Stanford, Schroeder led Colorado
with 13 kills. Shutting her down will be the main concern for
the Cardinal defense. Beckwith will also be a huge factor in
the game, as she is one of the top defensive players in the
Pac-12, averaging 4.25 digs per set.
Utah (9-15,4-11) is also not an opponent to be taken
lightly. Last weekend, the Utes managed to pull off a 3-2
upset victory on the road over the Oregon Ducks and will
be gunning for Stanford come Saturday.
The Utes have one of the strongest net defenses in the
game, as both sophomore middle blocker Erin Redd and
senior middle blocker Danielle Killpack rank in the top 10
in the Pac-12 in blocks per set. This dynamic duo will be
looking to shut down the Cardinal attackers. They will es
pecially be targeting sophomore outside hitter Rachel
Williams, who recorded 16 kills against the Utes in their last
meeting.
Coach John Dunning stated that the keys to both
matchups will be "playing relentless defense and serving
tough," a mantra that Stanford has certainly followed so far
this year. In their last matchup with Utah, they held the
Utes to a .126 hitting percentage (while hitting .333 them

selves) and recorded six service aces, including five by jun
ior setter Karissa Cook alone.
It will certainly be an interesting weekend in women's
volleyball, as Colorado and Utah attempt to make an im
pressive statement and prove they belong in the Pac-12,
while Stanford hopes to regain some momentum and fin
ish the season strong.
The series kicks off in Colorado at 5 p.m. Thursday
night.
