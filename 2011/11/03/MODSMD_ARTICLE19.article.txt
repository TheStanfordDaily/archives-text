# Simms is wrong about Luck
## 
### Jack Blanchat 
Bynow,l'msure you've heard
every good thing there is to
hear about Andrew Luck.
After all, his visage is con
stantly stamped all over
ESPN and the cover of this paper.

But there are still some folks out
there who aren't sold on the Luck's abil
ities as a quarterback, and count CBS
sports NFL analyst Phil Simms among
the skeptics.
On Tuesday, Simms went on Sirius
NFL Radio to talk about all the hype
surrounding Luck, and he shared a few
eyebrow-raising opinions.
' 'I think the hype is a little too much,''
Simms said."lfeelbadfor [Luck] in that
respect. I mean, what's he going to do to
match what they say he can do? There's
a lot to him. I think his best quality, by far,
is he's big and strong and he's going to be
able to move and run in the NFL.
There's no question."
Here, I see what Phil's trying to say.
Because Luck constantly impresses
with not only his physical but also his
mental attributes, it's easy to fall deeply
in love with the way he plays football.
But perhaps it's not fair to him to hype
him up so much.
But then Simms went right ahead
and jumped the shark.
"But the one thing I don't see, I just
don't see big-time NFL throws," Simms
continued. "I don't care what anybody
says. I've watched a lot of him. He never
takes it and rips it in there. And you can
say what you want, but man, you've got
to be able to crease that ball every once
inawhile... There's not a lot of rotation
on the ball, and there's not a tremen
dous amount of power."
(Imagine the sound of a record
screeching to a halt.)
Uh.what?
I think anyone who has watched
Luck's highlight tape has seen a few
passes that would suggest he can make
"big-time NFL throws," unless Phil is
referring to some sort of secret metric
that only he, Todd McShay and Mel
Kiper, Jr. understand.
But Phil, like anybody who watches
football, knows that arm strength isn't
everything. He continued on, saying,
"Not that you need to have that power
arm. I'm not saying you've got to have
that exclusively, but man, it sure helps
when you can do that because there's
four or five plays a game it is about arm
strength."
Okay, sure. In fact, I don't necessar
ily disagree with Simms to a certain
point. I think it's true that Luck's arm is
not as strong as NFL stars like Jeff
George, Jay Cutler, Matt Stafford,
Ryan Mallett or JaMarcus Russell. But
while Luck's arm might not be "John-
Elway-with-a-Nerf-Vortex-football"
strong, it's certainly strong enough to
make "big-time NFL throws."
Observe him throwing a perfect 62-
yard bomb against USC last week on a
reverse pass to Ty Montgomery or
throwing a ball 50 yards in the air while
falling down against Arizona State last
year, and you'll see exactly what I
mean. Additionally, I think a lot of his
arm strength is masked by the fact that
he doesn't throw many passes further
than 30 yards because of the run
heavy, West-Coast offense he leads so
well.
And while Luck's arm is plenty
strong, I also think the fact that he might
not have an absurdly powerful arm is
actually a good thing.
On the NFL level,some of the great
est quarterbacks in history have had
howitzers for arms. Dan Marino, John
Elway and Brett Favre all could throw it
so hard that they would break receivers'
fingers with their passes. But all three of
them were also prone to relying on their
potent arm strength too often â€”a fact
that is particularly true in Favre's case.
Guys who have those incredibly
strong arms often think they can zip a
ball into every window (most of the

time, it's because they can), but the ef
fects of that can be disastrous Favre's
arm strength is exactly the reason why
he's the NFL's all-time record-holder
for both touchdowns and interceptions.
For every touchdown pass that he rifled
past a middle linebacker and a defen
sive back into a 6-inch window for a
scoring strike, he also threw a missile
that hit a defender right between the
numbers on his jersey for an easy pick.
Conversely, Luck knows his own
strength so well that he doesn't try to
wing passes late over the middle into
double coverage. Instead, he'll check
down to a tight end or running back or
even (gasp!) anticipate whom the open
receiver will be based on his superb abil
ity to read a defense before the ball is
snapped.
So don't get too upset at Phil, Stan
ford fans and Luck supporters his
criticisms are about as valid as, "You
bob for apples in the toilet... and you
like it!"
But just because Andrew Luck's
right arm might not be borrowed from
Superman doesn't mean he won't be
successful at the next level. After all,
some quarterbacks with less-than-stel
lar arms have led their teams to multiple
Super Bowl victories quarterbacks
like Phil Simms.
And I have a feeling that, unlike
Simms, Luck's name won't be booed on
draft day.

Something about Jack Blanchat's
sunny disposition and effervescent
smile makes Clemsonfans' blood boil.
When Phil Simms gets a hold of this
column, Jack will also be seeking pro
tection from the boys at Morehead
State. To suggest a new identity for Jack,
