# Simms is wrong about Luck

### Jack Blanchat 
Bynow,l'msure you've heard
every good thing there is to
hear about Andrew Luck.
After all, his visage is con
stantly stamped all over
ESPN and the cover of this paper.

But there are still some folks out
there who aren't sold on the Luck's abil
ities as a quarterback, and count CBS
sports NFL analyst Phil Simms among
the skeptics.
On Tuesday, Simms went on Sirius
NFL Radio to talk about all the hype
surrounding Luck, and he shared a few
eyebrow-raising opinions.
' 'I think the hype is a little too much,''
Simms said."lfeelbadfor [Luck] in that
respect. I mean, what's he going to do to
match what they say he can do? There's
a lot to him. I think his best quality, by far,
is he's big and strong and he's going to be
able to move and run in the NFL.
There's no question."
Here, I see what Phil's trying to say.
Because Luck constantly impresses
with not only his physical but also his
mental attributes, it's easy to fall deeply
in love with the way he plays football.
But perhaps it's not fair to him to hype
him up so much.
But then Simms went right ahead
and jumped the shark.
"But the one thing I don't see, I just
don't see big-time NFL throws," Simms
continued. "I don't care what anybody
says. I've watched a lot of him. He never
takes it and rips it in there. And you can
say what you want, but man, you've got
to be able to crease that ball every once
inawhile... There's not a lot of rotation
on the ball, and there's not a tremen
dous amount of power."
(Imagine the sound of a record
screeching to a halt.)
