## CS team develops RAMcloud Researchers improve value data storage 
### ILEANA NAJARRO 
A team led by John Ousterhout,
professor of computer science, re
cently completed a vital stage in the
development of RAMCloud, a key
value data storage system that will
improve performance levels of cur
rent storage technology tenfold
and open up possibilities for future
networking sites and web applica
tions.

RAMCloud builds upon exist
ing large data storage systems, like
those used by Google and Face
book, and aims to enable users to
store and recover more data at
lower latency speeds. According to
Ryan Stutsman, a computer science
graduate student working on the
project, this type of technology is a
relatively new experimentation.
"Using RAM for this kind of ap
proach is only recently becoming
practical as the size of RAM has
been scaling up over the years and
it's now able to hold large data
sets," Stutsman said.
Ousterhout came up with the
initial idea for the project in early
2009, after looking at how network
ing and search engine sites were
storing memory and data. With the
help of Mendel Rosenblum, associ
ate professor of computer science
and electrical engineering, the idea
grew into the current project, which
is based on both professors' inter
est in exploring a low latent storage
system.
"We made the decision that, if
we were to do a company, we might
have to do something different. But
as research we would try to build
something that would be fast and
have the lowest latency possible
and start from there," Rosenblum
said. "That led to the idea that we
would put everything in memory
and call it RAMCloud."

The project's planning stage
lasted for nine months, until late
fall of 2009 when up to 10 students
and numerous faculty began direct
ly contributing to coding and or-
