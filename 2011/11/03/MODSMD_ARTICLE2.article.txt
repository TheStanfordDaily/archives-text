## CS team develops RAMcloud Researchers improve value data storage 
### ILEANA NAJARRO 
A team led by John Ousterhout,
professor of computer science, re
cently completed a vital stage in the
development of RAMCloud, a key
value data storage system that will
improve performance levels of cur
rent storage technology tenfold
and open up possibilities for future
networking sites and web applica
tions.

RAMCloud builds upon exist
ing large data storage systems, like
those used by Google and Face
book, and aims to enable users to
store and recover more data at
lower latency speeds. According to
Ryan Stutsman, a computer science
graduate student working on the
project, this type of technology is a
relatively new experimentation.
"Using RAM for this kind of ap
proach is only recently becoming
practical as the size of RAM has
been scaling up over the years and
it's now able to hold large data
sets," Stutsman said.
Ousterhout came up with the
initial idea for the project in early
2009, after looking at how network
ing and search engine sites were
storing memory and data. With the
help of Mendel Rosenblum, associ
ate professor of computer science
and electrical engineering, the idea
grew into the current project, which
is based on both professors' inter
est in exploring a low latent storage
system.
"We made the decision that, if
we were to do a company, we might
have to do something different. But
as research we would try to build
something that would be fast and
have the lowest latency possible
and start from there," Rosenblum
said. "That led to the idea that we
would put everything in memory
and call it RAMCloud."

The project's planning stage
lasted for nine months, until late
fall of 2009 when up to 10 students
and numerous faculty began direct
ly contributing to coding and or-
ganization. Stutsman indicated that
while the program is far from being
finished, a basic form exists.
"The RAMCloud software has
basically been able to service basic
operations and has been usable in a
testing way for about a year and a
half now," Stutsman said. "As far as
storing real data in it and support
ing a legitimate web application,
we just put in place one of the most
important pieces to head in that di
rection . . . we've developed a
crash recovery system."
The crash recovery system al
lows notes that have crashed to

quickly "reconstitute the memory
that was part of that crash host," ac
cording to Stutsman. He indicated
that in establishing this system, the
team has overcome one of its most
significant obstacles.
According to Stutsman, the
major challenge in using RAM for
the storage system is the volatile
nature of RAM itself. Whenever a
machine crashes or power is lost,
software based on RAM loses all
the data stored in it. With the re
cently completed crash recovery
system, however, the project re
solved this challenge.
The RAMCloud's magnetic disk
foundation surpasses the cost issue
associated with RAM technology.
While traditional data center stor
age systems solely use magnetic
disks, the RAMCloud software can

offer the durability and cheap price
of disks with greater performance
levels and lower latencies of RAM.
This combination makes the RAM-
Cloud even more accessible to
users for large networks.
David Erickson, a graduate stu
dent in computer science involved
in the initial exploration of the proj
ect, said that the Ram Cloud's suc
cess would play an impacting role in
modern technology.
"If RAMCloud excels and can
meet its goal, then dispatch steps
could potentially be much quicker
for just about everything in the In
ternet," Erikson said.
The overall goal for the project is
to allow for the creation of new ap
plications, without the creation
process being hindered by slow net
work speeds or limited space.

Stutsman said he believes technolo
gy is entering a new era in which
large data center storage systems
will require the speed and efficien
cy that RAMCloud aims to provide.
Stutsman said the next stage in
the process will involve polishing
additional features that would
make this goal all the more attain
able.

"We think this project can sling
shot applications into the next level
of data intensity," Stutsman said.
"We think that there will a lot of in
teresting applications that can get
at their data and access data and
basically provide more features
and a more interesting experience
to users in general."
