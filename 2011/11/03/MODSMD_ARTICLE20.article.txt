# TOP- 10 TEST
## Water polo faces two ranked MPSF foes 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Stanford men's water polo team will
return to Southern California this weekend
for a pair of top-10 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) matchups. The Cardinal
will face Long Beach State at noon on Satur
day and UC-Irvine at noon on Sunday.
Stanford (14-4,3-2 MPSF) is coming off of
a tough 8-4 loss to USC this past weekend,
putting a damper on the momentum the Car
dinal had been building in its conference sea
son. With a win, Stanford would have moved
into a tie for first place in the MPSF, but in
stead dropped to third with the loss.
That loss was a setback for the Stanford
team, which is hoping to be in the running for
an at-large bid to the NCAA Championships.
It could also receive a bid to the four-team
playoff by winning the MPSF Tournament.
"We pretty much need to win out now. It
makes these games more important," said
junior driver Paul Rudolph.
Although neither No. 9 Long Beach State
(14-6,1-3 MPSF) nor No. 8 UC-Irvine (13-9,
1-4 MPSF) have had very much success in
conference this season, they could pose some
problems for the Cardinal.
UC-Irvine leads the MPSF in total goals
with 266 and is third in the league with 12.09

goals per game. It also boasts the confer
ence's second leading scorer in sophomore
driver Mitch Wise, who has scored 59 goals
on the season.
The mass of goals has not led to a mass of
wins though, as the Anteaters are also second
in the MPSF in total goals against, having al
lowed 176 on the season. Those goals are split
up between junior starting goalie Jimmy
Friedrich, who is making 9.16 saves per game
over 9.5 games, and freshman Michael Bailey,
who is leading the MPSF with 10.53 saves per
game over 7.5 games.
Stanford should not have trouble scoring
goals against the fast-paced UC-Irvine
teams, but the Cardinal's second-ranked de
fense will be the key to making sure the game
does not turn into a shootout. Long Beach
State, on the other hand, will pose a much dif
ferent challenge.
"Long Beach has a slow pace. We need to
play our [faster] style, we can't let them dic
tate the tempo of the game," said Rudolph.
A good barometer for which team is more
likely to have success dictating their pace will
be when these two Stanford opponents face
off this Thursday at Long Beach State's
Anteater Pool. The two teams are currently
seventh and eighth in the nine-team confer
ence, so their matchup will determine who
will stay out of the conference cellar.
Stanford will be hoping that these games can
help the team reach its peak performance level
as it enters the final three weeks of the confer
ence season and prepares for the playoffs.
"We know our system it's just fine tun

ing the little things," said Rudolph.
Getting offensive balance will be one key
for the Cardinal, which has relied heavily on
freshman utility Alex Bowen for goals, as
well as senior driver Jacob Smith. Bowen is
third in the MPSF with 42 goals, and Smith is
fifteenth with 29.
Another key for Stanford has been get
ting scoring from other players outside of its
top scorers. In its two MPSF losses against
UCLA and USC, nobody outside of the top
four scorers found the net. That includes the
8-4 loss to USC, in which Bowen accounted
for three of the four goals.
The Cardinal has been able to make up for

some poor offensive outputs though because
of its stingy defense. The team is second in the
MPSF in goals allowed per game. That de
fense is led by senior goalie Brian Pingree,
who is also second in the conference in goals
allowed per game. He has not done it alone,
though, as he has been the beneficiary of a
defense that is allowing very few shots. Pin
gree is 11th in the MPSF in saves per game, at
6.55.

Stanford will face off against Long Beach
State on Saturday, and then play UC-Irvine on
Sunday at 12 p.m.
