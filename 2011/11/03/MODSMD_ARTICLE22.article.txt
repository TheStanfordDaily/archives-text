# NOLAN MAKES BIG WAVES
## 
### GEORGE CHEN 
Picture a high school quarterback star
who's touted to be not only the best
high school quarterback in the coun
try, but also better than the best quar
terback in college football. Yes, this
may seem close to impossible, but what if, just
what if, there were a high school quarterback
who is better than Andrew Luck?

As absurd as that scenario might sound, it
might be the best way to describe how good
freshman David Nolan is in the pool. And
there's plenty of statistical evidence to back it
up.

At the Pennsylvania state championships
last March, Nolan put on the greatest perform
ance in high school swimming history. Nolan
obliterated three individual high school nation
al records in the 200 individual medley, 100
freestyle and 100 backstroke. On top of that,
Nolan led his Hershey, Pa., high school team to
a new national mark in the 200 freestyle relay. To
put things into perspective, one state record at
the meet is usually an impressive accomplish
ment in high school swimming.

Nolan broke a total of six state records and
four national records, including relays, within a
span of two days. He finished his high school ca
reer with a total of 13 state titles.

In his signature event, the 200 individual
medley, Nolan lowered the national high school
record, which he set the previous year, by over
two seconds a ridiculous drop considering
that a tenth of a second is a sizeable margin at
the elite levels.

But the most stunning fact about his per-

formance is that his time of 1:41.39 in the 200IM
would've won NCAAs by almost two tenths of
a second. In any sport, a high school senior per
forming better than the top collegiate level is
phenomenal. In swimming, it's almost unheard
of.
Nolan garnered numerous accolades, includ
ing being named the Male High School Swim
mer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine,
based on the otherworldly swims that solidified
his permanent impact on high school swim
ming,
Fast-forward eight months, and Nolan is now
in the pool for the Cardinal, racking up 12,000 to
13,000 yards a day in training with his team
mates. Given the grueling hours, it's not always
easy to balance time between academics and
swimming.
"The transition's been difficult, especially
with the academics. High school was easy; col
lege is hard," Nolan said. "I thought practices
back in Hershey were tough, but practices here
out-do them by a mile. Sometimes it's hard to
wake myself up for practice in the morning and
then later go to class tired. It gets difficult for a
couple days each week, but it usually works
out."
Just because this transitioning period has
posed some challenges doesn't mean that Nolan
hasn't adjusted well.
"I don't think he's missed a beat. As far as I
can tell, there haven't been any setbacks in his
transitioning," said men's head coach Skip Ken
ney, a 20-time Pac-10 Coach of the Year, six-time
NCAA Coach of the Year and three-time
Olympic Coach.
One of the factors in this smooth transition is

that the freshmen on the team are so closely
knit.

"Talent-wise, this freshman class is one of the
best we've had," Kenney said. "But in my time
here at Stanford, I've never seen a freshman
class that's bonded as well this early in the sea
son as this group has. Their self-image is quite
strong."

Nolan also credits the upperclassmen for
helping him settle in and feel more comfortable.

"[The upperclassmen] have taught us every
thing they know about the team aspect," he said.
"They've gotten so far in teaching us how to act
around coaches and how to act towards each
other. They've also kept us motivated in the
pool."
In a sport that sometimes struggles to receive
recognition outside of the Olympics, Nolan has
gained a huge amount of attention in the swim
ming world and beyond even landing in na
tional spotlight with an article in ESPN Rise.
Fairly or unfairly, comparisons of him to
younger versions of Olympic stars Michael
Phelps and Ryan Lochte have already been
made. Despite such a high profile for a swim
mer, Nolan is humble and focused on his team's
success.
"I just want to have a good time with my
team, sharing the great meets and the great
practices with them," Nolan said.
"David's completely team-oriented," Ken
ney echoed. "We had a team meeting the other
day, and one of the things David suggested was
for the freshmen to have more meals together.
Just an outstanding team guy."
You would think that in his 33rd year as the
men's head coach at Stanford and after devel

oping numerous Olympic medalists, Kenney
has already seen it all. He has arguably as much
experience in training elite swimmers as any
other coach in the world. But Nolan might be
one of those few exceptions.

"I'm used to seeing his speed now, but the
first couple times I saw him swim backstroke in
practice, I was surprised at how fast he was
going," Kenney said. "All of David's strokes are
technically sound and that's one of the reasons
why he's so fast. This diversity allows me to
move him around and put him in different
events because our team has the depth. He'll
definitely have a full plate at NCAAs."
Kenney has a system for categorizing the
elite swimmers he has trained.

"There are two types of elite swimmers," he
said. "One type trains extremely hard during
practice and races well at meet. The other type
trains hard, too, but doesn't over-train. These
swimmers train smart and are more 'meet swim
mers' than 'practice swimmers.' The bigger the
meet, the bigger they show up. Most of the elite
swimmers that I've coached are the second type,
and David's definitely in that category. He's an
outstanding racer, without a doubt."

Nolan also claims that racing is his favorite
part about the sport.

"I like swimming collegiately. College swim
ming is definitely tougher competition, but I
enjoy it. High school swimming was fun, but this
is more serious and more of a team effort, which
makes it a lot more interesting."
Many college coaches might feel an enor
mous amount of pressure when given the re
sponsibility to coach a rare talent like Nolan, but
not Kenney. He isn't doing anything differently
because his methods have worked in the past
developing 72 NCAA Champions certainly
proves that.

There is an enormous sense of trust between
the coach and his swimmers and that relation
ship is no different between Kenney and Nolan.
"There's no pressure at all in coaching. The
attitude here is so great. Right now, I just want
David to get adjusted to college," Kenney said.
"We're laying out the base, and I want to keep
him fresh. He and I will start talking more about
season goals during early winter quarter."
Nolan agrees that he's swimming under a di
verse training regimen.

"I move around different stroke and dis
tance lanes, depending on the day. Right now,
we're mainly working on stroke technique and
aerobic base. I think I've improved in those two
areas since coming here," he said.
Last year, the Stanford men's team beat Cal
at the Pac-10 Championships but ultimately fin
ished behind the Golden Bears at the NCAAs.
The addition of Nolan and the talented fresh
man class, along with key returning veterans,
could make revenge likely this year.
The Cardinal swimmers seem to possess a
sense of confidence not arrogance about
the rematch. And a little of that extra confi
dence comes from their coach.

"I know we're going to beat Cal," Kenney
said. "There's no doubt in my mind."

there's plenty of statistical evidence to back it
up.

At the Pennsylvania state championships
last March, Nolan put on the greatest perform
ance in high school swimming history. Nolan
obliterated three individual high school nation
al records in the 200 individual medley, 100
freestyle and 100 backstroke. On top of that,
Nolan led his Hershey, Pa., high school team to
a new national mark in the 200 freestyle relay. To
put things into perspective, one state record at
the meet is usually an impressive accomplish
ment in high school swimming.

Nolan broke a total of six state records and
four national records, including relays, within a
span of two days. He finished his high school ca
reer with a total of 13 state titles.

In his signature event, the 200 individual
medley, Nolan lowered the national high school
record, which he set the previous year, by over
two seconds a ridiculous drop considering
that a tenth of a second is a sizeable margin at
the elite levels.

But the most stunning fact about his per-

formance is that his time of 1:41.39 in the 200IM
would've won NCAAs by almost two tenths of
a second. In any sport, a high school senior per
forming better than the top collegiate level is
phenomenal. In swimming, it's almost unheard
of.
Nolan garnered numerous accolades, includ
ing being named the Male High School Swim
mer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine,
based on the otherworldly swims that solidified
his permanent impact on high school swim
ming,
Fast-forward eight months, and Nolan is now
in the pool for the Cardinal, racking up 12,000 to
13,000 yards a day in training with his team
mates. Given the grueling hours, it's not always
easy to balance time between academics and
swimming.
"The transition's been difficult, especially
with the academics. High school was easy; col
lege is hard," Nolan said. "I thought practices
back in Hershey were tough, but practices here
out-do them by a mile. Sometimes it's hard to
wake myself up for practice in the morning and
then later go to class tired. It gets difficult for a
couple days each week, but it usually works
out."
Just because this transitioning period has
posed some challenges doesn't mean that Nolan
hasn't adjusted well.
"I don't think he's missed a beat. As far as I
can tell, there haven't been any setbacks in his
transitioning," said men's head coach Skip Ken
ney, a 20-time Pac-10 Coach of the Year, six-time
NCAA Coach of the Year and three-time
Olympic Coach.
One of the factors in this smooth transition is

that the freshmen on the team are so closely
knit.

"Talent-wise, this freshman class is one of the
best we've had," Kenney said. "But in my time
here at Stanford, I've never seen a freshman
class that's bonded as well this early in the sea
son as this group has. Their self-image is quite
strong."

Nolan also credits the upperclassmen for
helping him settle in and feel more comfortable.

"[The upperclassmen] have taught us every
thing they know about the team aspect," he said.
"They've gotten so far in teaching us how to act
around coaches and how to act towards each
other. They've also kept us motivated in the
pool."
In a sport that sometimes struggles to receive
recognition outside of the Olympics, Nolan has
gained a huge amount of attention in the swim
ming world and beyond even landing in na
tional spotlight with an article in ESPN Rise.
Fairly or unfairly, comparisons of him to
younger versions of Olympic stars Michael
Phelps and Ryan Lochte have already been
made. Despite such a high profile for a swim
mer, Nolan is humble and focused on his team's
success.
"I just want to have a good time with my
team, sharing the great meets and the great
practices with them," Nolan said.
"David's completely team-oriented," Ken
ney echoed. "We had a team meeting the other
day, and one of the things David suggested was
for the freshmen to have more meals together.
Just an outstanding team guy."
You would think that in his 33rd year as the
men's head coach at Stanford and after devel

oping numerous Olympic medalists, Kenney
has already seen it all. He has arguably as much
experience in training elite swimmers as any
other coach in the world. But Nolan might be
one of those few exceptions.

"I'm used to seeing his speed now, but the
first couple times I saw him swim backstroke in
practice, I was surprised at how fast he was
going," Kenney said. "All of David's strokes are
technically sound and that's one of the reasons
why he's so fast. This diversity allows me to
move him around and put him in different
events because our team has the depth. He'll
definitely have a full plate at NCAAs."
Kenney has a system for categorizing the
elite swimmers he has trained.

"There are two types of elite swimmers," he
said. "One type trains extremely hard during
practice and races well at meet. The other type
trains hard, too, but doesn't over-train. These
swimmers train smart and are more 'meet swim
mers' than 'practice swimmers.' The bigger the
meet, the bigger they show up. Most of the elite
swimmers that I've coached are the second type,
and David's definitely in that category. He's an
outstanding racer, without a doubt."

Nolan also claims that racing is his favorite
part about the sport.

"I like swimming collegiately. College swim
ming is definitely tougher competition, but I
enjoy it. High school swimming was fun, but this
is more serious and more of a team effort, which
makes it a lot more interesting."
Many college coaches might feel an enor
mous amount of pressure when given the re
sponsibility to coach a rare talent like Nolan, but
not Kenney. He isn't doing anything differently
because his methods have worked in the past
developing 72 NCAA Champions certainly
proves that.

There is an enormous sense of trust between
the coach and his swimmers and that relation
ship is no different between Kenney and Nolan.
"There's no pressure at all in coaching. The
attitude here is so great. Right now, I just want
David to get adjusted to college," Kenney said.
"We're laying out the base, and I want to keep
him fresh. He and I will start talking more about
season goals during early winter quarter."
Nolan agrees that he's swimming under a di
verse training regimen.

"I move around different stroke and dis
tance lanes, depending on the day. Right now,
we're mainly working on stroke technique and
aerobic base. I think I've improved in those two
areas since coming here," he said.
Last year, the Stanford men's team beat Cal
at the Pac-10 Championships but ultimately fin
ished behind the Golden Bears at the NCAAs.
The addition of Nolan and the talented fresh
man class, along with key returning veterans,
could make revenge likely this year.
The Cardinal swimmers seem to possess a
sense of confidence not arrogance about
the rematch. And a little of that extra confi
dence comes from their coach.

"I know we're going to beat Cal," Kenney
said. "There's no doubt in my mind."
