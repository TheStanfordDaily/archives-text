# IR reconsiders honors structure
## Department battles low participation, shifts to attract prospective students earlier 
### NATASHA WEASER 
While international relations is the third
largest major in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, its honors program has experi
enced a decline in student enrollment in re
cent years.

According to Ipshita Sengupta, student
services administrator of the program in in
ternational relations, over 300 students are
currently declared as international relations
majors, but only seven or eight of those stu
dents are in the honors program. A few years
ago, approximately 20 to 25 students partici
pated in the honors program annually.
"International relations is a major that

has a lot of breadth, [and] the honors pro
gram gives students the opportunity to con
centrate on depth," Sengupta said.
Thesis topics have typically ranged from
issues in international education to human
rights to international political economy.
Admission to the honors program re
quires prospective applicants to have a min
imum GPA of 3.5 and a strong thesis propos
al that is approved by a faculty member in
the international relations (IR) department.
Erica Gould, the new director of the IR
honors program, attributed this declining
trend to the popularity of alternative under
graduate honors research programs. These
programs include the Center for Democracy,

Development and the Rule of Law
(CDDRL) and Center for International Se
curity and Cooperation (CISAC) honors
programs, which have a more specific focus
in research topics than the traditional inter
national relations honors track.

Starting this year, the IR department is
looking to revamp its honors program to at
tract more prospective students. One of the
major changes to be implemented is the pro
motion of a better research environment.
"Research is at the core of the honors ex
perience," Gould said.

Previously, the honors program had no in
dependent research funding. In
stead, students who needed fi
nancing for their projects had to
apply through Undergraduate
Research and Advising (UAR).
Gould hopes that in the next year,
the department will form its own
pool of grant money for honors
students to utilize.

The department also hopes to
enroll students in the honors pro
gram at an earlier stage of their
undergraduate careers, which has
proved to be a challenge. Tradi
tionally, students applied for the
honors program in the fall quar
ter of their junior year and were
notified of acceptance in the
spring quarter of the same year.
Starting this year, the IR major
declaration forms will have an
added section asking students to
state if they are interested in pur
suing the honors track. Sengupta
said that interested students will
be sent more information and ma
terials on seminars and applica
tion procedures. This may help
students enter the program earlier
and have a longer timeline to com
plete their thesis research and
writing.

"If students start in their jun
ior year spring quarter, they can
become stressed and over
whelmed, especially when the job
hunting starts in the summer and
senior year," Sengupta said.
Furthermore, Gould noted
that discussing the honors pro
gram earlier allows the depart
ment to reach students before

they go abroad, which is a re
quirement for all IR majors. Stu
dents could therefore integrate
their overseas experience into
their honors theses, which is high
ly encouraged.
Another major change to take
place is the creation of a commu
nity within the group of IR hon
ors students. Ideas include faculty
luncheons for professors and
honors students to connect and
discuss research, as well as priori
ty for honors students in certain
classes.
"The idea is to have honors
students feel like they are part of
a cohort of students rather than
simply having the task of writing
a thesis paper," Gould said.
Judith Goldstein, current in
terim director of the internation
al relations program, along with
former director Kenneth Schultz
and future director Michael
Tomz, were each instrumental in
the brainstorming process of
these changes. Gould emphasized
that the proposed changes are
still in a tentative and preliminary
stage, as many other ideas and
possibilities are in line for the fu
ture.

A department meeting to dis
cuss potential changes on Mon
day, Oct. 24, was attended by
mostly juniors and faculty. Ac
cording to Gould, the new ideas
for the program received positive
feedback from students.

"We want this to be a change
embraced by students," Gould
said. "Our goal is to make the
honors program an enriching and
holistic experience for them."
