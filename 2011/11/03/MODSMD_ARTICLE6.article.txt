## SRC to partner with Zurich care 
### JUDITH PELPOLA 
Zurich Healthcare has entered
into a new relationship with Stan
ford Hospital and Clinics Risk
Consulting (SRC). Zurich cus
tomers now have access to various
services, including consulting and
enterprise risk management, of
fered by SRC at a discounted rate.
"Offering clients access to
Stanford services at a special rate
is something others are not
doing," said Susan Salpeter, vice
president for healthcare risk man
agement services at Zurich.
A leading insurance provider
for nearly 20 years, Zurich per
forms consulting and risk man
agement for hospitals, medical
groups and other healthcare
clients. One of the services Zurich
offers to its clientele involves
Zurich consultants going to hospi
tals, analyzing particular depart
ments and determining areas of
risk. Zurich is currently one of the
largest hospital malpractice insur
ance companies in the country.
The relationship between
Zurich and SRC allows Zurich
customers to have access to SRC
services not offered by Zurich it
self. The new partnership will
allow SRC to expand beyond its
current group of clients.
The services offered by SRC to

Zurich customers include identi
fying risks and strategizing on
managing those risks. Specific
services include Process for Early
Assessment and Resolution of
Loss (PEARL), which is a con
sulting service dealing with com
pensation and remedial proce
dures, and Decision Analysis Re
serve Targeting (DART), which
involves quantifying risks to aid in
financial and management deci
sion-making. Another service,

Safe Patient Handling, involves
cost-benefit analysis used to pro
vide safer environments for pa
tients and caregivers.
Talks of a potential relation
ship between SRC and Zurich
began six months ago when
Zurich officials began meeting
with Jeff Driver, chief risk officer
of the Stanford Medical Center
and executive vice president of

Negotiations between Zurich Healthcare and SRC lasted six months.
Zurich customers can now use SRC's various services, including consulting
and enterprise risk management, offered at a discounted rate.
