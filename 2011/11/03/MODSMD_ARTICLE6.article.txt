liability insurance claims. Current
ly, Zurich has over 200,000 claims
in its database, data that if studied
and analyzed, would prove useful
in future decision-making.

primarily with administrators in im
proving safety practices.
"Together, we're able to offer
the best in risk management be
tween two great organizations," he
said.
