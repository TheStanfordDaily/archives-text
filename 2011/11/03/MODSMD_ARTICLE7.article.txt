## Pastor offers generation gap analysis Pastor explores census data developments 
### MARY HARRISON 
Students, faculty and community
members gathered in Lane Hall
Wednesday to hear Manuel Pastor
discuss dramatic demographic
changes in the 2010 census data and
what these numbers mean given the
current economic climate.

Pastor, a professor of geography
and American studies and ethnicity
at the University of Southern Cali
fornia (USC), was selected to speak
at Stanford by current seniors in the
Urban Studies program for the pro
gram's sixth annual lecture.
"The first thing to know about
this new census data is that it shows
some pretty dramatic demographic
change," Pastor said.
He then proceeded to outline
several surprising statistics from the
2010 census data.

The first demographic change
that Pastor talked about was that al
though the growth rates of Asian
Pacific Islander and Hispanic popu
lations, 42.7 percent and 43 percent
respectively, are very high, they
have actually decreased since the
2000 census.
"The majority of new [popula
tion] growth is not driven by immi
gration, but by second and third
generation immigrant births," Pas
tor said.
The presentation largely focused
on the changing nature of ethnic de
mographics in the United States.
"We, as a country, by the year
2042, will become majority-minori
ty," Pastor said, meaning that by
that year there will be no majority
ethnicity.
Pastor noted that the national
demographic changes currently oc
curring mirror changes that have al
ready happened in the state of Cali
fornia. He added that California has
already dealt with political tensions
resulting from these demographic
shifts tensions that are likely to
occur at a national level soon.
Another key demographic shift
that Pastor addressed was not based
on ethnicity, but on age. Pastor out
lined the concerns posed by this
change.
"Demographers are not worried
about the browning of America,"
Pastor said. "Demographers are
worried about the graying of Amer
ica."

Pastor added that there is a gen
eration gap between an older Cau
casian population and a younger
Latino population. This gap has
widened since 1975. The median
age for Caucasians is 41, and the
median for Latinos is 27.
"This gap has consequences,"
Pastor said.
Pastor indicated that states with
the largest age gaps also have the
lowest spending on infrastructure
for the future and also spend less on
education. He speculated that this
could be the result of a disconnect
between the older generation of
Caucasians and the younger Latino
generation.
Finally, Pastor discussed how the
disconnect between generations,
combined with extreme income in
equality, may have led to the cur
rent recession. He noted that the
years when the top 1 percent of
earners' income peaked, 1928 and
2008, coincided with two of the
biggest economic crises in Ameri
can history. Pastor said he believes
equality is the key to economic
growth.
"Now we're not talking Soviet
style equality here ... but metro
politan areas that are more equi
table show more [economic]
growth over time," Pastor said.
After the presentation, Pastor
said he thought it was important for
Stanford students to be aware of
these new demographic trends,
since the implications of these
trends will dictate how society
moves forward in the future.
Jamie Querubin 'll attended
the presentation with a group of
other recent college graduates

working as interns in San Francisco
City Hall.
"We are going to be working in
a different climate for local govern
ment," Querubin said. "Professor
Pastor painted a really accurate pic
ture of what municipalities will
look like in the next 20 or 30 years."
Keith Knapp 'll also said he en
joyed the presentation, remarking
that the "difference in age is a kind
of diversity people don't usually
talk about."
Also in the audience was John
Mollenkopf, founding director of
the Urban Studies program. Mol
lenkopf said he was pleased to see
how the program has thrived since
its founding in 1972.
The talk was hosted by the
Urban Studies Department and
was sponsored by the American
Studies Department, the Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity, the Center for the Study
of Poverty and Inequality and the
Department of Sociology.
