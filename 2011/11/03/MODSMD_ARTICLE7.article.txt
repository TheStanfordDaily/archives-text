## Pastor offers generation gap analysis Pastor explores census data developments 
### MARY HARRISON 
Students, faculty and community
members gathered in Lane Hall
Wednesday to hear Manuel Pastor
discuss dramatic demographic
changes in the 2010 census data and
what these numbers mean given the
current economic climate.

Pastor, a professor of geography
and American studies and ethnicity
at the University of Southern Cali
fornia (USC), was selected to speak
at Stanford by current seniors in the
Urban Studies program for the pro
gram's sixth annual lecture.
"The first thing to know about
this new census data is that it shows
some pretty dramatic demographic
change," Pastor said.
He then proceeded to outline
several surprising statistics from the
2010 census data.

The first demographic change
that Pastor talked about was that al
though the growth rates of Asian
Pacific Islander and Hispanic popu

respectively, are very high, they
have actually decreased since the
2000 census.
"The majority of new [popula
tion] growth is not driven by immi
gration, but by second and third
generation immigrant births," Pas
tor said.
The presentation largely focused
on the changing nature of ethnic de
mographics in the United States.
"We, as a country, by the year
2042, will become majority-minori
ty," Pastor said, meaning that by
that year there will be no majority
ethnicity.
Pastor noted that the national
demographic changes currently oc
curring mirror changes that have al
ready happened in the state of Cali
fornia. He added that California has
already dealt with political tensions
resulting from these demographic
shifts tensions that are likely to
occur at a national level soon.
Another key demographic shift
that Pastor addressed was not based
on ethnicity, but on age. Pastor out
lined the concerns posed by this
change.
"Demographers are not worried
about the browning of America,"
Pastor said. "Demographers are
worried about the graying of Amer
ica."

Pastor added that there is a gen
eration gap between an older Cau
