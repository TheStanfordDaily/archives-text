## Stanford finishes fourth in PAC- 12 Fitness Challenge 
### SARAH TAYLOR 
Stanford finished fourth this year in the PAC
-12 Fitness Challenge, which ended on Sunday.
The UCLA Bruins trampled the competition this
year with 424,271 total points. The Cardinal came
in behind the Washington State Cougars and the
USC Trojans with 136,818 points.
The PAC-12 Fitness Challenge aims to en
courage physical activity among conference
members through a contest in which participants
log their exercise minutes over the course of a
week, which this year took place from Monday
Oct. 24 to Sunday Oct. 30. The challenge is open
to all students, faculty and staff at PAC-12 univer
sities and the winning university receives $5,000
for its recreation department. The winner also
earns the title of "fittest" school in the PAC-12.
At Stanford, the program is promoted
through BeWell, a University-run health organi
zation that aims to "encourage individuals to
adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors
and to improve their health, well-being and qual
ity of life," according to its website.
"BeWell gets the word out through our mail
ing lists," said Eric Stein, senior associate athletic
director. "We also had it listed in the Stanford
Report, in the ad section there. For students, we
had it all over the fitness center."
Last week, students could log their minutes
while still at the gym at computer tables set up at
the Arrillaga fitness center. Participants needed
a valid university email address in order to regis
ter.
Every year, BeWell works to encourage nutri
tion and fitness on the Stanford campus. The fit
ness contest is another effort to encourage Stan
ford students and faculty to be active and
healthy.
"The main goal is to activate the population in
activities of fitness and wellness," Stein said.

In an effort to reach more people, the contest
made the switch this year to Facebook as the
method for users to enter their minutes. In previ
ous years, the contest has operated through its
own website. While this move increased the con
venience of logging minutes for many students, it
also limited contest participation to Facebook
users.

The contest counted the number of "likes" on
the official Facebook page along with fitness
minutes to determine the total number of points
for each school. A "like" gained one point and
each fitness minute logged earned another point.
There was also the opportunity for participants
to earn badge points for particular athletic activ
ities like stretching and strength training.
This year the challenge resulted in 1.7 million
logged fitness minutes in total and 18,640 likes on
Facebook. Stanford contributed 929 likes and
130,060 fitness minutes.
Despite the success, many students remained
unaware that the fitness challenge was taking
place.
"I really had no idea the PACI2 Fitness Chal
lenge was happening this year," said Daniel
Wong 'l3. "I had heard about it as a freshman,
but didn't hear about it this year."

Historically, Stanford is a force to be reck
oned with in the competition. Since the contest's
beginning in 2007, Stanford has won three of the
past four years, just barely coming in second last
year to Arizona State University.
The contest has evolved over the years. It ini
tially was judged based off the size of the school,
ensuring that the large schools did not have an
unfair advantage over the smaller ones like Stan
ford. However, in 2009, the challenge became
non-weighted after Stanford easily swept the
competition the first two years.
"The reason it was changed is because Stan
ford was winning it every year," Stein said.
This year, the front-runners had significantly
larger student populations than Stanford. UCLA
boasts a population of 37,000 students compared
to Stanford's combined total of approximately
15,000 graduate students and undergraduates.
Another factor that hindered Stanford's suc
cess this year was decreased participation from
faculty as a result of the new format.
"We did hear from some staff that just don't
use Facebook ... and were unable to participate
this year," Stein said.
Another big change this year was the addition
of the two new PAC-12 schools, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and the University of Utah,
to the challenge. They finished sixth and ninth,
respectively, in point totals.
The PAC-12 athletic directors will be meeting
this week at their regional conference. They will
discuss the success of the challenge this year and
the effects of the new Facebook format on partic
ipation.
"Ideally, we'd like to have a dual system next
year where you can use our webpage as well as a
Facebook page," Stein said.
