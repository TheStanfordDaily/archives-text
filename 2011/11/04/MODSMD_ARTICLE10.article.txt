## Sun exposure affects vitamin D levels in light-skinned people more, study finds 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Brendan O'Byrne 
Avoiding sun exposure may result in a vitamin
D deficiency for light-skinned people, according to
a study published by Stanford researchers on
Thursday.

Interestingly, applying sunscreen did not affect
test participants' vitamin D levels, though re
searchers speculate this was a result of poor or
sparse application.

Though sun exposure increases the risk of skin
cancer, this study adds to the debate over how to

best balance avoiding excess sun exposure and
maintaining healthy amounts of vitamin D.
"It's not as simple as telling everyone to wear
sunscreen," said dermatologist Eleni Linos, M.D.
Ph.D. in a press release. "We may instead need to
begin tailoring our recommendations to the skin
tones and lifestyles of individual patients."
Vitamin D production is triggered by the ab
sorption of ultraviolet rays in sunlight, and a lack of
the vitamin has been linked to weak bones, rickets
and possibly cancer. Experts predict that 30 to 40
percent of people in the United States are vitamin
D deficient, according to the University statement.
The research surveyed data from self-reported
tendencies, such as how often a person enters the
sun and how often they wear sunscreen. The study
found that while sun exposure did not affect vitamin
D levels in African-American or
Hispanic respondents, Caucasians
who received less sunlight had sig
nificantly lower vitamin D levels.
The study found that Cau
casians who stayed in the shade
and wore long sleeves were twice
as likely to be vitamin D deficient
as those who did not, causing
Linos to emphasize the impor
tance of vitamin D supplementa
tion.
One interesting finding was that
sunscreen use, which blocks UV

rays and thus should decrease vita
min D production, had no effect on
the users' vitamin D levels.

"This finding was both interest
ing and surprising," Linos said in the
same press statement. "People are
probably not applying it often or
thickly enough."
"Often, people use sunscreen
when they anticipate getting a lot of
sun exposure, unlike others who
spend time in the shade in order to
avoid the sun," Linos said.
The study was funded by a
Damon Runyon Clinical Investiga
tor Award, the National Institutes of
Health and the Department of Der
matology.
