## Entrepreneurship class set for winter 
### ALLY ARRIETA 
"The Startup Workshop: Entrepreneurship
through the Lens of Venture Capital" is a course
which will be featured for the first time this win
ter quarter. The course, which is currently accept
ing applications, will bring in 10 prominent in
vestors from Silicon Valley to serve as guest lec
turers and is currently offered through the De
partment of Management Science and Engineer
ing and the School of Engineering.
Ernestine Fu 'l3 spearheaded the course,
working with faculty to design the curriculum and
inviting business leaders to participate. Forbes
Magazine featured Fu, an associate at San Fran
cisco venture capital firm Alsop Louie Partners,
on one of its August covers.

"I have realized that there are several startup
essentials that are often never discussed at
school," Fu said. "I personally discovered this un

told story when I began working at the venture
capital firm Alsop Louie Partners in March of this
past year. Not every student is provided with the
opportunity to work at a venture capital firm or
startup while attending school, and I want to
share the invaluable lessons I have acquired with
other students."

Seeing that there was no class at Stanford to
give students the opportunity to learn about the
cycle of a startup, Fu met with Bill Coleman, a
partner at Alsop Louie Partners, David Hornik, a
partner at August Capital and Tom Kosnik, a pro
fessor in School of Engineering, to organize the
course. James Plummer, dean of the School of En
gineering, also played an important role in de
signing the course and will be leading the first
class.

"This course proceeds through the stages of
growth and challenges experienced
by startups," Fu said. "Although
there is no set formula for building
a successful company, basic princi
ples and general patterns are mani
fested in the most successful start
ups."

The course will give a small
group of 20 students an inside look
at customer value equations, board
management, market strategy,
company culture and hyper
growth. Among the venture capi
talists volunteering as guest lectur
ers are Bill Draper, one of the West
Coast's first venture capitalists;
Ann Winblad, one of the first fe
male venture capitalists in Silicon
Valley; David Sze '93, an investor of
Facebook, Digg, Oodle, Linkedln
and Pandora and Floward Harten
baum, the founding investor of
Skype.
In addition, experienced entrepre
neurs such as Mark Leslie, the
founding CEO of Veritas Software
and Evan Williams, creator of two
of the Internet's top 10 websites,
Blogger.com and Twitter.com, will
be sharing their insights with stu
dents.

"We want them to be able to in
teract with each other and the ex
perienced folks who are there,"
said Coleman, a member of the
teaching team. "So they can get a
better understanding of how a
team addresses the challenges that
they will face whether they decide
to become entrepreneurs or start
small businesses."
To make this material available
to other students and budding en
trepreneurs, Stanford Technology
Venture Program's ECorner and
Stanford's iTunes channel will fea
ture the series online. Organiza
tions like Silicon Valley Bank and
Cooley LLP have also stepped in to
support the course.
"A lot of really great ideas for
companies are coming out of un
dergraduates now, and this will give
them a great basis of understand
ing and contact," Coleman said. "If
you think about it, with only 20 stu
dents, they will be able to really in
teract with the best and most expe
rienced leaders in the valley."

More than 100 students have al
ready applied for the course.
