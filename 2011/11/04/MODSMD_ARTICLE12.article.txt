## EDITORIAL A 						better approach to away game subsidies 
### 
The ASSU recently an
nounced that it is offering
$lO checks to the first 250
Stanford students who submit
tickets from Stanford's football
game at USC last Saturday. This
policy, publicly hinted at in an Oct.
18 post on a Senator's Facebook
page but otherwise not widely ad
vertised until after the game, is ad
vertised as away to "help defray
the cost of the ticket" from the
game. Though many students
drove to Los Angeles to attend the
thrilling triple-overtime game, the
premise of these subsidies and
their execution is questionable.
The justification for gestures
like the USC game subsidy tends
to rest on ASSU support for
building student community in
the form of attendance at and par
ticipation in University sporting
events. Students are able to cele
brate school spirit, lend moral
support to the competing team
and have a generally enjoyable
time. Given that football games
are popular outings, as evidenced
by massive student demand for
tickets, the ASSU's promotion of
attendance at football games is
understandable.
If the combined cost of ticket
and transportation to a football
game is to be subsidized, there are
certainly better ways to go about
it. Presumably, the goal of such
ticket subsidies is to encourage
students to attend the event with
out having to worry about any fi
nancial hurdles. However, what is
in effect a surprise subsidy handed
out after a game defeats this pur
pose completely. Students only
qualify for the subsidy ex post if
they had already decided to attend
the game. Essentially, the subsidy
only benefitted those students

who already possessed the finan
cial resources necessary to finance
the costs of the ticket and travel to
Los Angeles.
If the goal of these ticket subsi
dies is to level the playing field for
students choosing to attend a
game based upon the cost of doing
so, then only ticket subsidies well
publicized before the game make
sense. Indeed, such subsidies are
typically available through dormi
tory and house funds. Staff mem
bers may elect to draw subsidies
from these pools and, as in the case
of the Crothers Memorial dormi
tory, coordinate transportation to
the site of the game as well as pur
chase residents' tickets for a small
er fee.

Of course, dormitory funds are
not always used according to the
wishes of residents. While every
student is required to contribute
towards dormitory funds, the deci
sions to devote funds to one activ
ity over another can never be
made by complete consensus.
Thus students who have no desire
to go to football games might pay
for their fellow residents' ticket
subsidies.

Accordingly, we acknowledge
the advantage of direct ticket sub
sidies for students, but not for their
residences. The ASSU needs to do
a better job of publicizing such ef
forts before games, not after, when
some students may have already
chosen not to attend a game be
cause of its high cost. We suggest
the ASSU award individual ticket
subsidies, to be used at any Stan
ford sporting event, before these
events have taken place. This ap
proach would better serve the
ASSU's goal of encouraging ath
letic attendance and do so in away
that is fair to fans of every sport.
