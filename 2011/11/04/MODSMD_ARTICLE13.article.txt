# THE
						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## Grand old problem in the GOP 
### D.S. Nelson 
The field of Republican candi
dates for president makes
many intellectual conserva
tives uncomfortable. Of the four
Republican frontrunners, three are
either woefully underqualified or
proposing unrealistic policies and
radically weighty social goals.
Texas Governor Rick Perry is a
radical of extremely marginal sub
stance, so much so that he is trying
to avoid presidential debates. (He
said, "I'm a doer, not a talker," in a
recent campaign ad. Incidentally
talking is part of the whole presi
dent gig.) Minnesota Congress
woman Michele Bachmann ap
pears to be far more of a personal
ity than a politician and is obvious
ly pandering, just like Perry, to the
electorate with simple, folksy rhet
oric without intellectual backing.
Former businessman Herman Cain
is attempting to play off running a
pizza company as valid experien
tial credentials for the highest of
fice in our nation. It's very difficult
to imagine any of these people
could be elected after the scrutiny
of a national campaign, even if the
opposition were much weaker than
the dynamic Obama. It's even
harder to think about a realistic
scenario where any of the three
could pilot the United States
through the economic and diplo
matic complexities of the upcom
ing 'los with any more subtlety
than a sledgehammer. Though that
seems a widely known fact, they
are still very popular. I cannot help
but ask why.
The widespread lack of confi
dence in these three, who have at
one time or another sped to the
front of the polls, reflects a lack of

belief in the conservative media and
electorate. The tactics that are ap
pealing to journalists and voters are
the cheapest kind. Talk about small
town Main Street and vague cliches
of patriotism are swaying hearts
and minds instead of promises and
policies. The talk is of frustration
and the battle to take back Wash
ington, not what doing so would
achieve. Perhaps this was born out
of a desire to be more accessible, but
it has come to the point where sub
stance is gradually being eliminat
ed. The contest of proving who is
most truly American has reached a
point where any serious display of
intellectual vigor is a serious image
problem. But it has become stylish
to be a joke, at least to discerning
eyes, and electorally unadvisable to
be a serious candidate.

A real question: How can one
be an intellectual conservative in
America? Even outside of the
presidential race, most prominent
Republicans become so by advo
cating policies very few people
here at Stanford would endorse
(think Peter King). There is no vi
able third-party option and there
seems to be no realistic way to stop
this simplifying trend, considering
what appeals to the electorate. If I
am to believe that all of this rheto
ric will be transformed into reason
after candidates are elected, I still
have a problem. I cannot be con
vinced that it is wise to entrust
someone with so much power who
is so suggestible or, alternatively, so
manipulative of his or her con
stituency. Either motivation seems
unsuitable of POTUS.

The problem isn't localized to
the Republican Party. Last year's

campaign was won in large part by a
one-word platform: "change." That
is not to say Obama's campaign was
baseless, but it appealed to voters
on a basic level. It lured voters with
the aesthetic of progress, but not
progress itself.
I have a great deal of respect for
the one Republican campaign that I
feel, in my limited interaction with
news media, continues to press its
cause on substantive levels: that of
former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney. Romney talks in con
crete terms about changing the way
America's entitlement systems
work a highly unpopular topic.
When confronted by folksiness in
debates, he is insistently boring. The
truth is, policy questions should
have boring responses. Yet every
candidate insists on couching every
thing in the nondescript terminolo
gy of folksiness. They're either at
tempting to be very appealing, or so
accessible that the line between
communication and entertainment
is blurred.

I, personally, would prefer a
shamelessly boring campaign of
very expected haircuts, so long as
that lack of vibrancy allowed the
important specificities to shine
through. Our politics are far too su
perficial. We need something better
if we are going to actually improve
our country. We have an electorate
that is continually impassioned but
ignorant of the substance of issues
something we cannot afford in
the 21st century. I hope there is
some way the cycle can be broken.
