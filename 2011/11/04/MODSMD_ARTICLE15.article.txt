## Gifts of the islands 
### Holly Moeller 
I met Makana in August 2005, where
an old lava flow meets the ocean in
a series of ledges and tide pools on
Kauai, one of the Hawaiian Islands.
He was a "local" of about my age who
got his name (Hawaiian for "gift")
from the old volcano that formed the
backdrop of our introduction. He was

n't in college, but had a good job as a
caddy at an upscale golf course, where
Bill Clinton had tipped one of his bud
dies well the day before. In the after
noons, he and his friends came to this
spot still called "The Queen's
Bath" decades after the days of
Hawaii's royal rulers to "talk story"
and swap tales with an endless stream
of tourists.They smile and joke, even as
we talk about local crises in health
care, drug abuse and housing prices
driven so high by outside demand that
local sons and daughters don't know
how they'll afford a place to live.
As we chatted, one young man
abruptly dove off a 20-foot cliff into
the turquoise water below. He swam
rapidly across the cove in pursuit of
an enormous green sea turtle per
haps 5 feet in length which glided
just out of his reach for several me
ters before turning gracefully on a
flipper and rapidly outdistancing
him. Giving up on the chase, he
climbed out of the water and back up
to the ledge with a smile on his face.
He'd been playing this game with
that particular turtle for several
years, he explained.
"One day, I will catch him, but for
now the old man likes to joke with
me." His friends only laughed.
I saw the process repeated several
times that day. The turtle was never
caught, and I had little fear for it. Else
where, green sea turtles (which are
listed as an endangered species) are
crowded, chased, encircled and petted
by dozens of eager snorkellers. I was
no less guilty, having pursued more
than my fair share as a child. There
was something different about how
these young men saw that turtle,
though. It was a companion, perhaps a
friend, another living, feeling being
with whom they shared an increasing
ly fragile world.
Hawaii is a state under siege.
About 70 million years ago, a hot
spot at the ocean's floor began to
build the islands one by one. They
broke the surface as active volcanoes,
spewing ash and lava to create a plat
form of bare rock for the first seeds of
life. These seeds were few and far be
tween: They had to survive a 2,500-
mile trip from the closest continent
across an unforgiving Pacific Ocean
and then carve a niche for themselves
on the most unforgiving of surfaces.
As millennia went by, soil formed
and lush tropical rainforests, swamps
and coral reefs emerged.
Isolated from the mainland, the
few species that arrived could evolve
and diversify into dozens of new

forms, unhindered by the predators
or competitors they'd left behind on
their continental homes. A thousand
"ancestral colonists" gave rise to
thousands of plants and insects, a
striking diversity of birds (including
an array of honeycreepers that rival
Darwin's finches) and one lone mam
mal: the Hawaiian bat. Most of these
species (including 89 percent of the
native plants) are endemic (found
only in Hawaii) and some are con
fined to a single island. Even the
slightest damage to their miniscule
habitats could mean extinction.

Threats, of course, abound. There
are the usual suspects: habitat loss to
agriculture, industry and the latest re
sort, damage from overuse, death by
over-hunting. Perhaps the most sig
nificant problem today, however, is
species invasion. Transported to
Hawaii from all over the planet, these
foreigners take advantage of shel
tered and defenseless natives to
thrive within weakened ecosystems.
The very icons of the islands co
conut palms, pineapple, sugar cane,
pigs roasted at luaus, flowers for leis
are all introduced. Tropical forests
have been uprooted by wild boars,
the eggs of native birds have been de
voured by rats and mongoose, and
countless tourists have been
swarmed by newly introduced mos
quitoes.

Today, while we may understand
the risk of invasion far better, we are
more likely than ever to invite it. Our
globalized world has created numer
ous vectors for transplantation: ships
and airplanes bear cargo and hitchhik
ers between previously unconnected
areas. Yet living without the trappings
of modern life seems unthinkable:
who can turn down papayas in De
cember, or cheap Halloween cos
tumes manufactured overseas?

But maybe Makana, his friends,
and their laughter at the edge of the
sea hold a deeper lesson for all of us.
There are some things more impor
tant than globalization, efficiency
and dollars. There are the things we
respect, the lifestyles we love and a
world we can't afford to lose. The sil
houette of a sea turtle, the sweet song
of a honeycreeper the gifts of the
islands.

of tourists.They smile and joke, even as
we talk about local crises in health
care, drug abuse and housing prices
driven so high by outside demand that
local sons and daughters don't know
how they'll afford a place to live.
As we chatted, one young man
abruptly dove off a 20-foot cliff into
the turquoise water below. He swam
rapidly across the cove in pursuit of
an enormous green sea turtle per
haps 5 feet in length which glided
just out of his reach for several me
ters before turning gracefully on a
flipper and rapidly outdistancing
him. Giving up on the chase, he
climbed out of the water and back up
to the ledge with a smile on his face.
He'd been playing this game with
that particular turtle for several
years, he explained.
"One day, I will catch him, but for
now the old man likes to joke with
me." His friends only laughed.
I saw the process repeated several
times that day. The turtle was never
caught, and I had little fear for it. Else
where, green sea turtles (which are
listed as an endangered species) are
crowded, chased, encircled and petted
by dozens of eager snorkellers. I was
no less guilty, having pursued more
than my fair share as a child. There
was something different about how
these young men saw that turtle,
though. It was a companion, perhaps a
friend, another living, feeling being
with whom they shared an increasing
ly fragile world.
Hawaii is a state under siege.
About 70 million years ago, a hot
spot at the ocean's floor began to
build the islands one by one. They
broke the surface as active volcanoes,
spewing ash and lava to create a plat
form of bare rock for the first seeds of
life. These seeds were few and far be
tween: They had to survive a 2,500-
mile trip from the closest continent
across an unforgiving Pacific Ocean
and then carve a niche for themselves
on the most unforgiving of surfaces.
As millennia went by, soil formed
and lush tropical rainforests, swamps
and coral reefs emerged.
Isolated from the mainland, the
few species that arrived could evolve
and diversify into dozens of new

forms, unhindered by the predators
or competitors they'd left behind on
their continental homes. A thousand
"ancestral colonists" gave rise to
thousands of plants and insects, a
striking diversity of birds (including
an array of honeycreepers that rival
Darwin's finches) and one lone mam
mal: the Hawaiian bat. Most of these
species (including 89 percent of the
native plants) are endemic (found
only in Hawaii) and some are con
fined to a single island. Even the
slightest damage to their miniscule
habitats could mean extinction.

Threats, of course, abound. There
are the usual suspects: habitat loss to
agriculture, industry and the latest re
sort, damage from overuse, death by
over-hunting. Perhaps the most sig
nificant problem today, however, is
species invasion. Transported to
Hawaii from all over the planet, these
foreigners take advantage of shel
tered and defenseless natives to
thrive within weakened ecosystems.
The very icons of the islands co
conut palms, pineapple, sugar cane,
pigs roasted at luaus, flowers for leis
are all introduced. Tropical forests
have been uprooted by wild boars,
the eggs of native birds have been de
voured by rats and mongoose, and
countless tourists have been
swarmed by newly introduced mos
quitoes.

Today, while we may understand
the risk of invasion far better, we are
more likely than ever to invite it. Our
globalized world has created numer
ous vectors for transplantation: ships
and airplanes bear cargo and hitchhik
ers between previously unconnected
areas. Yet living without the trappings
of modern life seems unthinkable:
who can turn down papayas in De
cember, or cheap Halloween cos
tumes manufactured overseas?

But maybe Makana, his friends,
and their laughter at the edge of the
sea hold a deeper lesson for all of us.
There are some things more impor
tant than globalization, efficiency
and dollars. There are the things we
respect, the lifestyles we love and a
world we can't afford to lose. The sil
houette of a sea turtle, the sweet song
of a honeycreeper the gifts of the
islands.
