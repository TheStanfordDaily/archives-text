The men and women's golf teams both fin
ished up their fall seasons this week, with the
women placing third at the Rainbow Wahine In
vitational on Wednesday while the men came
home in sixth place at the Gifford Collegiate
Golf Championship earlier in the day.
There were plenty of bright spots for the

Cardinal on both squads freshman Patrick
Rodgers solidified his spot as the team's No. 1
with his fourth consecutive top-10 finish at the
Gifford, while Sally Watson and Krishna Wong
both were in the hunt in Hawaii and finished in
the top-10.
But there were just as many issues of consis
tency for Stanford.
Coming into the Gifford, held right down the
road at CordeValle Golf Club in San Martin,

Calif., the men's team was ranked third in the
country behind No. 2 Oregon and No. 1 Texas.
But the Card struggled from the outset, turning
in a first-round 371 that left the team in eighth
place, a whopping 26 strokes behind USC for
the lead.

Coach Conrad Ray attributed some of that
deficit to the disadvantage the Cardinal had in
starting play on the back nine holes of the
course, which Ray said were tougher to ease
into.

"Conditions were pretty tough all week, the
rough was thick and the greens were fast," he
said. "And we didn't have our best stuff. Playing
six guys and counting five scores, we battled that
fourth and fifth spot a little bit and the fifth
score all week was a little bit high. But hats off
to USC for taking command."
The Trojans came out firing at pins from the
first tee, shooting a first-round 345 led by senior
Steve Lim's 66. But even with their low scores,
they faced some serious competition from
UCLA and sophomore star Patrick Cantlay.
Last year's Division I Player of the Year and a
First Team All-American shot a first-round 63
to pace the field.

From there, it was pretty much a two-man
(and two-team) race with Lim and Cantlay out
pacing Oregon's Eugene Wong slightly. Lim
proved to be slightly more consistent, taking the
title after three rounds in the 60s.

Rodgers and sophomore Cameron Wilson,
who shot a final-round 69 to tie for 13th at the
Gifford, have both played very well in the fall.
And junior Andrew Yun has been right up there
with Rodgers in several events, needing to finish
with better closing rounds to move up the
leaderboard.

But as Ray pointed out, the team has yet to
find a solid back-end to the lineup, and while it
has not been due to poor play by any one play
er, the cumulative effort hasn't been quite up to
the level Ray expects from one of the favorites
to win the Pac-12 title.

"The team results have been kind of a mixed
bag," Ray said. "The win [in September at the
Fighting Illini Invitational] in Chicago was one
of more impressive victories I've had as a coach
here. Now, obviously the last couple weeks have
been a little off-par, and we want more contri
bution from the fourth and fifth spots. But that's
the beauty of team golf we just need a couple
of guys to step up."

The women's team faces many of the same
problems, although signs of improvement were
everywhere in Hawaii. Stanford finished at 19-
over par, 34 strokes behind UCLA, but juniors
Krishna Wong and Sally Watson finished in the
top seven and the Cardinal did not even have
the services of freshman Mariko Tumangan,
who has emerged as one of the top players on
the team.

If Watson, who won the first tournament of
the season at the Washington State Cougar Cup,
Wong and Tumangan can continue to perform
at a high level, Stanford will have a chance to
compete for the conference crown. But it won't
be easy the No. 1 Bruins women's team is
even more formidable than its male counter
part and features four players inside the top 15
individually.

But both Stanford teams will have to wait to
make their moves on the course, as the Cardinal
takes a break from competition until tourna
ment play for both squads resumes in February.
