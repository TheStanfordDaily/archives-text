# RAMPED UP SENIOR NIGHT
## Rivalry game 'bittersweet' 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDTIOR 
After an early-season draw at
Maryland, little has gone wrong for
the No. 1 Stanford women's soccer
team, which has recorded 16 straight
wins, posted a cumulative score of
49-6 and won a third consecutive
conference title since that scoreless
tie back in late August. But despite
being in prime position for yet an
other run deep into the NCAA Tour
nament, the Cardinal (18-0-1,10-0-0
Pac-12) still has one more item on its
agenda this weekend: the annual ri
valry matchup with No. 23 Califor
nia.

The Bears (12-5-2, 5-3-2) would
love to play spoiler on Senior Night
at Cagan Stadium and hand the sen
ior class of midfielder Teresa Noyola,
forward Lindsay Taylor, defender
Camille Levin and midfielder Kristy
Zurmuhlen just their second regular
season loss in four years on the Farm.
Cal can also move up from fifth to
fourth in the Pac-12 standings with a
win and a Washington State loss to
close the season.

To best the Bears, Stanford can't
be content with what it's already ac
complished this season, a trap the

Cardinal seemed to be falling into at
Oregon last Sunday after clinching
the Pac-12 just two days beforehand.
But after expressing disappointment
in the energy level after a 2-0 win
over the Ducks, head coach Paul
Ratcliffe has noticed a marked im
provement this week.

"Practice has been excellent,"
Ratcliffe said. "The team's training
hard and they're doing well."
On paper, the squad shouldn't
have much trouble beating Cal if the
Cardinal is at its best. Stanford's top
five scorers Taylor (16 goals),
Noyola (8), freshman forward
Chioma Ãœbogagu (8), junior forward
Marjani Hing-Glover (6) and sopho
more forward Sydney Payne (5)
have netted more goals combined
than Cal (41) this season, and Cardi
nal goalkeepers have allowed half as
many tallies as the Bears have.
Of course, the rivalry factor can
always make a difference, but Stan
ford is approaching this showdown
as business as usual.

"It's always fun getting up for a ri
valry game," Hing-Glover said. "It's
great when you can have good com
petition and stuff, but I don't think
we're going to do anything different
ly. It'll be another great game in front
of a great crowd, and we're looking
forward to it."

After facing Cal, the Cardinal will
have about a week to prepare for its
