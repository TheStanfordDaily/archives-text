# Time for Pac-12 hockey
## 
### Joseph Beyda 
As someone who's lived
in the Bay Area for his
whole life, I recognize
that there are certain
things that we just
aren't supposed to know about out
here. Snow plows? I thought those
were only in movies. Ski goggles
and mummy bags? I'll rent them
out if I ever spend a weekend in
Yosemite.

But ice hockey? Well,you'd be sur
prised.

We do actually know a thing or two
about the sport, even though it's never
feasible here in its original, outdoor
state. Thanks to several expansion at
tempts (some of them failed), "The
Great One's" trade to the LA Kings
and the rapid emergence of youth
hockey on the West Coast, hockey has
become much more of a mainstay in
California than you might expect. We
have more NHL teams out here
(Sharks, Ducks and Kings) than any
other state or province and as
many as all of Eastern Canada, for
that matter.

But the NCAA is another matter.
Ignoring Alaska and Alaska-Anchor
age (for obvious reasons), the west
ernmost school with a Division I
men's ice hockey team is the Univer
sity of Denver. And when a quarter of
the teams in the NHL representing
16 combined Stanley Cup Final ap
pearances are located west of the
Mile-High City, that doesn't make
much sense.

Even for an athletics powerhouse
like Stanford, travel logistics would
make it nearly impossible to sponta
neously start a varsity hockey team.
So what would it take for a significant
portion of the Pac-12 to start playing
hockey?
Less than you might think.

Though college hockey has tradi
tionally only flourished in the Mid
west and on the East Coast, West
Coast interest in the sport should not
be downplayed. Six Pac-12 schools
(the four California universities, Ari
zona State and Colorado) are located
within 50 miles of an NHL arena. And
don't get me wrong I'm talking to
you, cross-country runners and
golfers but as one of the four major
American sports, hockey is much
more student-fan accessible than
some of the sports that are common
out west.

Then comes the money issue.
Club teams such as Stanford's have
to travel several miles to reach a
practice facility, which is annoying to
players but makes it downright im
possible for much of a fan base to de
velop. On-campus facilities are a
practical necessity.

At least from Stanford's perspec
tive, the cost of building a hockey
arena shouldn't be all too discourag
ing. College hockey facilities are gen
erally modest, often holding fewer
than 5,000 spectators, and new arenas
of that size can carry about a $3O mil
lion price tag. By comparison, Stan
ford shelled out $26 million to reno
vate Maples Pavilion seven years ago
while still maintaining significant
parts of the original structure. And
money doesn't even seem to be much
of a barrier for cash-strapped public
schools; the upcoming renovations to
Husky Stadium will cost the Universi
ty of Washington an estimated $250
million.

Even once a facility is built, critics
may point to the high operating costs
of maintaining an ice surface, which
requires large amounts of water as
well as and electricity for constant
cooling. Annual utilities costs can
easily reach the low six figures for
small hockey rinks as well as larger
ones.

But this still pales in comparison to
the operating costs of college facilities
in other sports. One Olympic-sized
swimming pool can demand $250,000
a year to maintain. Avery Aquatic
Center has two such pools to support
a pair swimming teams and a synchro
squad; one ice rink could plausibly be
enough for both a men's and a
women's hockey team.

When it comes to revenue, college
hockey brings in more in ticket sales
than you might expect. While a 2010
NCAA report showed that men's bas
ketball and football are usually the
only sports to make money at the col
lege level, it also uncovered that men's
ice hockey teams lose an average of
$356,000 a year. That's quite a large
sum, but still $250,000 cheaper than
baseball a sport of comparable
popularity and even greater promi
nence to the American market
where Stanford teams have made a
name for themselves nationally over
the years.
With several club teams already
in existence amongst Pac-12
schools, building college hockey on
the West Coast shouldn't be written
off so easily. It would take some
time for Stanford to rise to the
prominence we all take for granted,
but the same can be said for any
other sport which has been pro
posed for adoption time and time

again. (Apologies to Wyndam
Makowsky, but men's lacrosse loses
$459,000 a year, on average.) While
the Frozen Four isn't in sight for the
time being, Pac-12 teams would still
get exposure through the confer
ence's new media network.
And since the NCAA is at least 20
years behind the curve in terms of
bringing hockey out west, why not go
for it? It's shot in the dark, but maybe
it'll be a shot on goal.

Joseph Beyda can't skate to save his
life. I'm serious. As a young child he
nearly died when he crashed into the
limbo stick during an event at his
local ice rink. To give him some skat
ing tips (i.e. don't do it), email him at
