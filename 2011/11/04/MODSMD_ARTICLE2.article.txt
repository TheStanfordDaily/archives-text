# NO TIME FOR REST
## CARD ROLLS ON AFTER TAXING WIN OVER USC 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Last week, the Stanford football
team emerged victorious from the
most dramatic, nerve-wracking
game of the college football sea
son.
Next week, the No. 4 Cardinal
will welcome No. 8 Oregon to the
Farm for a game that will likely de
cide who wins the Pac-12 North Di
vision.
This week, Stanford (8-0, 6-0
Pac-12) takes on lowly Oregon
State (2-6, 2-3). But when you're
deep in the hunt for the national
championship, nobody wearing
cardinal and white is going to over
look the Beavers.
They just consider it the eye of
the hurricane.
"We know there's an elephant
in the room. You can't just say,
'Don't worry about the rest of the
games,"' said sophomore line
backer AJ Tarpley. "We know that
[Oregon] is a big game if we can
win this game, and so we treat it
like every other game. The only
way that game will mean some
thing next week is if we take care of
business this week, so the only
thing on our mind this week is Ore
gon State."
Of course, overlooking anyone
at this point would be unwise for
the Cardinal, but the Beavers have
a unique history of defeating high
ly ranked conference opponents in
the last few years. Oregon State has
pulled off three major upsets that
changed the national title picture
in the last five years by beating No.
3 USC, 33-31 in 2006, No. 2 Cal in
Berkeley in 2007 and then No. 1
USC, 27-21 in 2008.
In addition to all the history of
big-time upsets, quarterback An
drew Luck recalled the Cardinal's

last trip to Corvallis in 2009, a 38-28
Beaver victory, when talking about
the challenges of playing in Reser
Stadium.
"Definitely no fond memories.
They're a very well coached, tough
team, and coupled with a great at-

NOTES ! Stanford will have to play without
one of its three talented tight ends, junior
Zach Ertz, as it hopes to come out strong
after a draining effort at USC last weekend.
The Cardinal faces a struggling Beavers
squad that is coming off a disappointing
27-8 loss at the hands of Utah.
