# NO TIME FOR REST
## CARD ROLLS ON AFTER TAXING WIN OVER USC 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Last week, the Stanford football
team emerged victorious from the
most dramatic, nerve-wracking
game of the college football sea
son.
Next week, the No. 4 Cardinal
will welcome No. 8 Oregon to the
Farm for a game that will likely de
cide who wins the Pac-12 North Di
vision.
This week, Stanford (8-0, 6-0
Pac-12) takes on lowly Oregon
State (2-6, 2-3). But when you're
deep in the hunt for the national
championship, nobody wearing
cardinal and white is going to over
look the Beavers.
They just consider it the eye of
the hurricane.
"We know there's an elephant
in the room. You can't just say,
'Don't worry about the rest of the
games,"' said sophomore line
backer AJ Tarpley. "We know that
[Oregon] is a big game if we can
win this game, and so we treat it
like every other game. The only
way that game will mean some
thing next week is if we take care of
business this week, so the only
thing on our mind this week is Ore
gon State."
Of course, overlooking anyone
at this point would be unwise for
the Cardinal, but the Beavers have
a unique history of defeating high
ly ranked conference opponents in
the last few years. Oregon State has
pulled off three major upsets that
changed the national title picture
in the last five years by beating No.
3 USC, 33-31 in 2006, No. 2 Cal in
Berkeley in 2007 and then No. 1
USC, 27-21 in 2008.
In addition to all the history of
big-time upsets, quarterback An
drew Luck recalled the Cardinal's

last trip to Corvallis in 2009, a 38-28
Beaver victory, when talking about
the challenges of playing in Reser
Stadium.
"Definitely no fond memories.
They're a very well coached, tough
team, and coupled with a great at-

NOTES ! Stanford will have to play without
one of its three talented tight ends, junior
Zach Ertz, as it hopes to come out strong
after a draining effort at USC last weekend.
The Cardinal faces a struggling Beavers
squad that is coming off a disappointing
27-8 loss at the hands of Utah.


mosphere, it's always tough to go
into Corvallis," Luck said. "They
put the beatdown on us last time
we were up there, so we're expect
ing a fight."
Another added challenge for
the Cardinal will be dealing with
the fatigue associated with the
overtime win last week in Los An
geles, as well as the emotional
highs that come after a big victory.
"It's onto the next play, onto the
next game, we've got to take it day
by day in order to achieve our
goals," said senior linebacker
Chase Thomas. "Last game was
real draining emotionally and
physically, so we had an easy prac
tice Monday to get everyone's bod
ies feeling good and I feel like
we're doing a good job about that."
Between the lines, the biggest
task for Stanford this week will fall
to the defense, which was fried for
a season-high 48 points against the
Trojans. The Cardinal's primary
focus is on stopping the big plays
that nearly cost it dearly last week,
an issue that was triggered by the
defense failing to sack the oppos
ing quarterback for the first time
all season.

"[USC] had a good scheme for
us, a bunch of three-step drops, and
it's hard to get pressure when they
do three-step or slide protection or
cut block," Thomas said. "What it
comes down to is doing better on
first and second down so we can get
into those third-and-longer situa
tions with longer pass drops where
it's harder to protect for a longer
time. We've got to play better on first
and second down defense to unleash
some of those play calls that we have
called up for this team."
The task of stopping the Beaver
offense should be a little less com
plicated than stopping the Trojan
offense last weekend, especially
because Oregon State like most
teams in the country doesn't
boast a quarterback of Matt
Barkley's caliber. Instead, the
Beavers have redshirt freshman
Sean Mannion, who has subpar
numbers despite throwing more
than 40 passes per game.
Mannion is more than capable
of drafting an excellent perform
ance he threw four touchdowns
to only one interception in a 44-21
win over Washington State but
he's also capable of disaster, as evi

denced by his one-touchdown,
four-interception game against
Arizona State in a 35-20 loss.

Thomas said Mannion's youth,
in contrast to Barkley's experi
ence, made the team "feel a little
more confident" that it can bounce
back after last week.

"We knew Barkley last week;
he's a talented quarterback, and
[Mannion] is a good player too,"
Thomas said. "But when you watch
the film, you can tell he still makes
some of those young-guy mistakes,
so we've got to take advantage of
those mistakes when they're pres
ent."

On the offensive side of the ball,
the Cardinal will have to deal with
the loss of redshirt sophomore
tight end Zach Ertz, who injured
his knee on the opening kickoff last
week. The absence of Ertz, who has
308 yards receiving and three
touchdowns this season, affects

more than a quarter of the play
book, head coach David Shaw ex
plained, especially because it ham
pers the Cardinal from using three
tight ends at one time.
Offensive coordinator Pep
Hamilton wasn't concerned that
the loss of Ertz would stunt the na

tion's third-highest scoring of
fense.
"We played the entire game
[against USC] without Zach Ertz,
and our guys did an amazing job of
adjusting with our personnel
groupings," Hamilton said. "I'm
confident that [junior tight end]

Levine Toilolo, [senior tight end
Coby Fleener and [junior fullback
Ryan Hewitt can cover the slack."
Hamilton also pointed out that
the Cardinal has played without
one of its triumvirate of tight ends
in several games this season al
ready.

"We'll make whatever adjust
ments we have to make; that's the
nature of football," he said. "Fleen
er went out against Arizona, and
Levine went out against Colorado,
so we now had to adjust, we'll make
whatever adjustments are neces
sary for us to have an opportunity
to win."

In addition to the loss of Ertz,
the Cardinal will also be without
sophomore offensive tackle
Cameron Fleming, who was in
jured against USC, as well as senior
safety Delano Howell, who will
likely be out of the lineup for the
third week in a row with a hand in
jury. Senior wide receiver Chris
Owusu, who sustained a massive
hit to the head last week on the
Cardinal's final drive in regulation,
will play.
Now that it is caught deep in the
swirl of the national title hunt, the
Cardinal knows it can't afford a let
down in Corvallis, especially when
the drama could ratchet up consid
erably next week.
Shaw said that's exactly the way
he wants it to be.

"We've talked all year about
building," he said. "You win a big
game, they only get bigger. You
can't win a big game and stop play
ing. I think our guys understand
that."

The Cardinal may have to rely more on its running game this weekend in light of an injury to junior tight end Zach
Ertz (left). Third on the team in receptions, Ertz went out on the opening kickoff against USC and sent shockwaves
through the Stanford playbook, but after a week of adjustments the Cardinal looks to pick up where it left off.

Sophomore linebacker AJ Tarpley (center) had a breakout game against USC, recording nine tackles and falling
on the game-winning fumble in triple-overtime. His role has expanded dramatically on a battered Stanford defense.
