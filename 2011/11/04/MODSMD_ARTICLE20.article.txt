THINGS THAT OUTLASTED KIM
KARDASHIAN'S MARRIAGE
To nobody's surprise, Kim Kardashian's fairytale marriage to
NBA player Kris Humphries ended abruptly when she filed
for divorce on Monday after just 72 days of wedded bliss.
Usually, Intermission doesn't work well with numbers, but
counting is something that we can do, which leads us to
our five favorite things that have fared better than the
Kardashian-Humphries union.
Kris and Kim's engagement
Length: 85 days. First spotted together in December 2010,
the duo quickly got engaged roughly six months later when
Humphries popped the question with a 20.5 carat ring worth
a reported $2 million.

One season of "Keeping Up with the
Kardashians"
Length: The latest one, season six, lasted 134 days.
Hopefully Humphries will still be able to make appearances in
season seven when it premieres next July, if only because his
first name fits in so well with the rest of the gang.
Courtney Stodden and Doug
Hutchison's marriage
Length: 168 days and counting. America's most disturbing
marriage is still going strong. If you love train wrecks or are
simply bored, Intermission highly recommends subscribing to
Stodden's absolutely ridiculous Twitter feed.
NBA lockout
Length: 126 days and counting. Intermission only has
rudimentary understanding of sports, but from what we
understand, poor Kris Humphries has not only been ousted
from his marriage but his day job, too.
Autumn quarter at Stanford
Length: 88 days. In less time than you spent sweating and
slaving over p-sets and exams, Kim Kardashian married a hot
NBA player, raked in buttloads of money then promptly filed
for divorce, extending her spotlight for an additional 15

minutes. It really puts that
college degree into perspective.
