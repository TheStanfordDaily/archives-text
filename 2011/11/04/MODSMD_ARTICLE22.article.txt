## 'Race' provokes but falls at the finish line

The premise of David Mamet's new play,
"Race," is that a group of underdog lawyers
one black lawyer (Chris Buder), one white
lawyer (Anthony Fusco) and one young, black, female
lawyer-in-training (Susan Heyward) get
approached, ostensibly because of the colors of their
skin, by a white man (Kevin O'Rourke) accused of rap
ing a black woman and end up taking on his case. Fifty

years ago in "To Kill a Mockingbird," a black man
accused of raping a white woman is necessarily found
guilty by virtue of the color of his skin. Fast-forward to
present day in "Race" and the rules have been reversed:
the white man must be found guilty because of his
inherent racial privilege. It's not exactly an advance
ment in eliminating racism.
Part of what makes the play provocative is that we
are never quite sure whether what we are witnessing is
racism, sexism or not even prejudice at all, but with a
play called "Race" we are looking for racism every
where. At one point, the young lawyer-in-training is
asked by the white lawyer to wear, in court, the
sequined dress that the accuser was supposedly wear
ing at the time of the rape, to be part of a demonstra
tion. She is offended. But should she be? Is it a racist
request because they need a Wudwoman to wear the
dress to prove a point? Or is it a sexist one because she's
the only woman in the firm, and so she must be used
for her sex rather than her wits? Or is it ageism,

because she is the ingenue? Or is it perfectly harmless?
She is a member of the firm, so it is her job to partici
pate in helping with the case. Mamet balances all of
these issues well, making us constantly question
motives and consider if our obsession with eliminating
racism today may actually be creating racism.
The play does bear Mamefs trademarks. It is a
heightened reality where all the characters are
equipped with great wit and epigrams to deliver. One
of the best exchanges occurs when the white lawyer
