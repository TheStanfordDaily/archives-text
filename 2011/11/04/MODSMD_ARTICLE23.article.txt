# BOOK
## 'Office' star muses on work, life and playing Ben Affleck 
### â€“ lauren WILSON contact lauren: lhwilson@stanford. edu 
Mindy Kaling is funny. Really, really
funny. To use a long, highly specific
metaphor, she's that one friend you
catch up with over lunch one day but wind up

sitting back and letting her
dominate the entire conver
sation. However, you're
completely fine with it
because you know she's not
an insufferable egotist, but
simply infinitely better at
telling stories than you
could ever hope to be. It's
that exact persona that
comes across in her endear
ing memoir "Is Everyone
Hanging Out Without Me?
(And Other Concerns)"
and makes it such a fun
and engaging read.
In it, Kaling chronicles
her life from chubby Indian

girl with a tendency for asexual haircuts and
Cosby sweaters, to her years as a big fish at
Dartmouth College, her days as a broke, starv
ing, 20-something New Yorker and to her envi
able life as an executive producer/writer/actress
on NBC's "The Office." Similar to published
works by Chelsea Handler, Tina Fey and Laurie
Notaro, the book is broken down into short,
individual anecdotes and essays, although
Kaling's are structured in chronological order to
bring us up to speed on her thought processes
from those dorky, asexual years to the present.
Like everyone else, Kaling anticipates com
parisons to Handler and Fey, but quickly distin
guishes her own voice and perspective. She's
certainly as weird and goofy as Fey, but as the
pink-dominated cover suggests, she's much
girlier. And she immediately eschews any simi
larities to Handler with essays entitled
"Someone Explain One-Night Stands to Me"
and "'Hooking Up' is Confusing," which she

chalks up to a wholesome, traditional upbring
ing by her Indian parents and the inherent
nerdiness that has kept her on the straight and
narrow since childhood.
"Best Friend Rights and Responsibilities"
will likely turn into one of those viral memes
that are constantly blasted to you by chain let
ter-happy aunts and grandmas. And though
Kaling's witticisms may appear to be directed
solely at women, men would benefit by taking
tips from her entirely accurate "Guys Need to
Do Almost Nothing to Be Great" (essentials:
well-fitting peacoat, dark-wash, straight-leg
jeans, a signature drink and great non-drug
store-bought cologne).

For "Office" fans, Kaling
dedicates a whole section to her
career, from her breakthrough
playing Ben Affleck in an off
off-Broadway show to a list of
differences between herself and
Kelly Kapoor (Kapoor would
fake a rape for attention, Kaling
would not. Both would fake
their own death to catch a serial
killer.)
Kaling's prose is breezy and
conversational and her intelli
gence and self-awareness are
readily apparent. It's tempting
to consider Kaling's memoir as
the latest entry from a pan
theon of established and rising

TV female comedy writers like Fey, Handler,
Kristen Wiig, Liz Meriwether and Whitney
Cummings, but Kaling adamantly refuses to do
so. In her closing chapter, she write directly
about why she won't delve into exploring
whether or not women are funny because "by
commenting on that in any real way, it would
be tacit approval of it as a legitimate debate,
which it isn't." Everyone's been jabbering about
the wild success of "Bridesmaids" and the glut
of new female-centric sitcoms, but Kaling has a
point. "Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"
is funny simply because Kaling is hilarious, not
because of her race or gender. Her success story
is an encouraging one, proving that hard work
(and not just looks) can take you far within the
entertainment industry.
