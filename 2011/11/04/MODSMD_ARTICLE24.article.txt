When it was first announced
that Neil Gaiman and his
musician wife, Amanda

Palmer, would be per
forming in a string of
small theaters on the
West Coast, the San
Francisco event sold out
so quickly that they
decided to put on a sec
ond show, which took
place on Wednesday
evening. It was, appropri
ately, Day of the Dead
themed.
The set list consisted
of a mix of poetry and
prose by Gaiman, music
by Palmer, group acts (in

which Gaiman sang) with their opening
band, The Jane Austen Argument and a ques
tion-and-answer session that saw Gaiman and
Palmer field audience questions from submit
ted cue cards. It was not quite a reading and
not quite a rock concert, but it was spellbind
ing, and the audience cheered in spades.
Palmer played a wide range of touching,
inspiring and laughter-inducing songs,
including her well-known "Ukulele
Anthem," a defiantly cheerful piece that had
recendy been adopted, she explained, as an
unofficial theme song of the "Occupy"
movement. (She has performed the song at
"Occupy Wall Street," "Occupy Boston" and
most recently, "Occupy San Francisco.") She
also performed the bittersweet ballad "Dear
Old House That I Grew Up In," a love song
to her childhood home, inspired by the news
that her parents were planning to sell their
house. Her other pieces included more con
ventional love songs though none of her
music is what one might call conventional
a number from the musical "Cabaret," in
which Palmer performed with the American
Repertory Theater last autumn, and the
now-famous "Gaga Palmer Madonna," origi
nally a song composed for the blogosphere
detailing her views on women in contempo
rary music.

Gaiman's set list
included several
poems, such as one

he'd written as a
present for Palmer, a beautiful
list that read like Elizabeth
Barrett Browning's "How do I
love thee," updated for the 21st
century. The cornerstone of his
performance, however, was a
piece entitled "Forbidden Brides
of the Faceless Slaves in the
Secret House of the Night of
Dread Desire," a short story
from his anthology "Fragile
Things." He described it as a col
laboration with his 20-some
thing-year-old self, a story that
he had written, gotten indiffer-

ent reactions to and shelved early in his career,
only to come back to it several decades later
and decide that it was worth polishing up for
publication. (He also insisted that he'd short
ened the title; the original was even longer.)
It was, Gaiman said, a sort of reflection on
the place of fantasy and science-fiction in the
literary world, and an admonition to write
what you love, rather than what you are told
you should write.
They sat down briefly to answer ques
tions from the audience, written out on a
stack of neon-colored cue cards. Many of the
questions revolved around the nature of
their relationship (they wed in January), in
response to which they told some humorous
anecdotes and dispensed pithy, accurate
advice, such as "get good at fighting," to the
great amusement of the audience. Their wit
and good-natured ribbing kept the conversa
tion cozy throughout, as though they were
speaking to friends as opposed to a theater. It
was a refreshing change from the rock con
certs Palmer usually plays and the massive
crowds Gaiman's readings usually draw, and
a good time was had by all.
