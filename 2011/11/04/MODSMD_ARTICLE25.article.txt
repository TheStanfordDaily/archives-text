"LOVE ON TOP," Beyonce Knowles
Despite the raunchiness suggested by its title,
"Love On Top" is an

upbeat throwback
to the love songs of
the 'Bos in the style
of Stevie Wonder,
Michael Jackson
and Paula Abdul.
This video has no

gimmicks or optical stunts; it's just Beyonce
doing what Beyonce does best: singing, dancing
and changing wardrobes. With a handful of
male back-up dancers, she shuffles through
moves that would make the Temptations proud
and Janelle Monae jealous. Don't worry that
little black leotard is there from start to finish.
Though it may not have quite the bedazzling
cache of that one video others, most notably
Kanye West, have deemed "one of the best videos
of all time," "Love On Top" has a refreshing inno
cence that is sure to stick. □
"LONELY BOY," The Black Keys
"Lonely Boy" is the first single off The
Black Keys' seventh album "El Camino," set to
hit stands Dec. 6, and the video is just that: a
lonely boy. He's more of a man, but he sure is
lonely and must have spent hours perfecting his
dance moves to rival Carlton Banks [from
"Fresh Prince"], Beyonce and even that Flea
Market Montgomery guy. The song itself res
onates rough and raw in true Black Keys fash
ion, and if their sound isn't enough to entice
you, this part-dancing, part-miming man will
ensure you can't pull your eyes away from the
screen. It's like a glorious train wreck. Or a really
good dancer at a club. Q
"SOMEBODY THAT I USED TO KNOW,"
Gotye feat. Kimbra
The visual rendition of this Belgian-
Australian troubadour's frank post-breakup rant
is simple in form and bewitching in spirit. Stop
motion animates the blank background and
Gotye's naked body to infuse a feeling of deep
thought and meaningful abstraction to the mun-

Dane lyrics. I could probably discuss how the
artistry attempts to emulate Kandinsky's Bauhaus
pieces, or how it embodies Schwitters' "Merzbau,"
but the truth is the video is just fun to look at,
and Gotye and Kimbra's voices captivate the lis
tener in spite of somewhat trite and brassy lyrics.

"SEXY AND I KNOW IT," LMFAO
LMFAO's latest release from "Sorry For Party
Rocking" is still pending fratstar status, but the
lame and animal print video is sure to usher this
track into crowded dance floors and stuck-in
your-head success. The simple declaration of self
confidence in the song lends itself to a suspense
ful plot of battling boy bands (literally and figura
tively) who duke it out on the streets and
speakeasies of Los Angeles. Think "Grease," "The
Outsiders," "West-Side Story," but with boom
boxes and studs. Though LMFAO leave little to
the imagination, I'll leave the video to your future
viewing pleasure. With guest appearances from
Ron Jeremy and Wilmer Valderrama (Fez!), you
will not want to miss "I'm Sexy And I Know It."
This is one (literally) ballsy music video. Q
"WE FOUND LOVE," Rihanna feat. Calvin
Harris
The sweet electro-house stylings of Scottish
singer-songwriter-DJ Calvin Harris inject
Rihanna's reliable vocals with a frenetic energy
yet untapped by the Barbadian pop princess.
"We Found Love" plays like an episode of
"Skins" complete with an epigram from English
model Agyness Deyn, a dangerous liaison with
boxer and model Dudley O'Shaughnessy and a
whole lot of pills. The video has met criticism
from all angles including an eviction from the
original set for one of Rihanna's signature moves
scantily clad prancing in an open field (see
"Only Girl In The World") and comparisons
between O'Shaughnessy and Chris Brown, insin
uating the song and video's autobiographical con
notations. Yet, Rihanna and director Melina
Matsoukas remain adamant that the video's mes
sage is related to drug addiction and toxic rela
tionships. Q
