Florence
Welch
has huge
shoes to fill
with her sopho
more effort

"Ceremonials," fol-

lowing her successful debut
album, "Lungs." As a fan of Florence +
the Machine, I crossed my fingers that
her second album would be as good, if
not better, than the first.

The album is like a jungle safari
with deep, resonant drumbeats, soulful
choir accompaniments, the dark, rich
ebb and flow of Welch's voice and the
uniqueness that makes Florence + the
Machine = alternative brilliance. From
the first song, it's clear that this isn't the
Florence + the Machine from "Lungs."
The sound and lyrics have matured.
Welch has said in recent interviews that

most of the songs on "Lungs" were writ
ten when she was in her late teens,

whereas the music written for
"Ceremonials" was written after the
release of "Lungs."
The album straddles the boundary
between mellow and upbeat, sometimes
alternating between the two in the mid
dle of a song; for those who are not
familiar with the Welch's stylings, this
might be a difficult characteristic to
overlook. During the first listen of

o
the album, I found a few songs that
didn't sit well with me not
because I didn't like the music, but
because I wasn't exactly sure what I
was listening to. "Remain Nameless"
perhaps the most disturbing
song on this album, maintains a
very soft, unassuming techno beat
with the vocals as the primary focus,
emphasizing vague anonymity, con
fusion and sadness.

In addition to the two singles
that have been released from this
album "What the Water Gave
Me" and "Shake It Out" there are
a few other songs that are likely to
be favorites. "No Light, No Light,"
with its loud drumming booms and
crescendos from Welch and her
choral backup, made me feel like I
needed to be standing on the bow of

an 18th century ship sailing the open
seas with wind blowing through my

hair. "Never Let Me Go," one of the qui
eter tracks on the album, is reminiscent
of a hug with its soothing trances.

"Leave My Body" is a very interesting
interpretation of the afterlife and the
process of leaving a bodily form to
become a spiritual form.
Coming from the perspective of a
squealing fan girl, this album nails it. It's
Florence + the Machine demonstrating
growth from the successful "Lungs." For
those of you who may not be fans of
Florence + the Machine, this album is
worth checking out especially if

you've heard of her, but haven't actually
listened to any of her work. She's
evolved quite a bit on this record, and if
this pattern keeps up, there's no telling
what her third album will bring.
