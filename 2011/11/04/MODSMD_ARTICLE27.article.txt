## JOHN CHO ON SEX, DRUGS AND CINEMATIC POST-RACISM 
### â€“ eliana CARMONA contact eliana: carmona@stanford. edu 
The "Harold and Kumar" franchise is
known for its ability to push the limits
of what is socially acceptable, eagerly
casting aside conventions and nonchalantly
touching upon the most controversial of topics.
The most obvious (and perhaps least con
troversial in this particular setting) is its premise
as a stoner movie; by creating a charismatic duo
whose friendship is built around the happy
herb, the franchise inherently approves the use
of technically still-illegal drugs.
"Weed's fine," John Cho (Harold) said

vaguely.
Of his audience, he is less cagey.
"I love being affectionate with stoners,
they're the most affectionate people on the
planet," he said. "They're huggers."
Of course, the series doesn't stop with illicit
drugs. The latest movie, "A Very Harold and
Kumar Christmas," features a whole slew of
"edgy" concepts, including but not limited to
sexual assault, murder and a series of scenes
involving a toddler getting hooked on a whole
slew of exciting substances, among them pot,
cocaine and ecstasy
"To be fair, the child is a degenerate," Cho
joked.

Frequently, the franchise will take things
beyond what even the rudest and raunchiest of
moviegoers might consider normal. Hearken
back to the moment in "Harold and Kumar Go
to White Castle" when the dynamic duo is

trapped in a bathroom stall between two attrac
tive young ladies who are quite deafeningly
voiding their bowels. Who could forget that
extraordinarily long, shockingly realistic sex
scene between Kumar and a large, anthropo
morphic bag of weed? And if it's nudity you
want, the latest movie goes all out, shocking
viewers with an up-close-and-personal view of
poor Harold's flaccid penis, frozen to a tele
phone booth and shrunken by fear and pain,
not to mention the cold.

Cho was very frank about the little lifelike
appendage (a prosthetic), declaring that he
"obviously would've preferred a boa constric
tor" and explaining that, no, it was not actually
modeled after the real thing.
Does he have any misgivings about the
scene?
"Uh... yes," he said. "That was the part I
was most worried about my mother seeing."
But it's not enough to slow his stride.
The franchise deals with some of its more
controversial material with a surprisingly
respectable philosophy. Racial humor is a trade
mark of the series. The writers hold a sort of
post-racial attitude, seeing race as a factor that
can be acknowledged or mocked like any other
physical attribute, rather than the hot-button
topic that many make it out to be.

"The writers assume and the movies
assume that you're not a racist, and that we all
think it's silly," he said. "Race is a part of life, and
it comes in and out of focus, and it comes to

prominence and recedes, and that's how we
treat race in these movies." Cho's opinions seem
to hold true in regard to the series' treatment of
race after all, the films are populated by well
balanced characters that acknowledge race
without being defined by it.
The films stand on less steady ground on
the feminist front. Not a single one of the

movies features a fleshed-out female character,
instead displaying male-envisioned fantasies of
wildly attractive, violently sexual and infinitely
one-dimensional women. These cardboard

cutouts are placed in all kinds of delightful situ
ations: the latest movie even features a graphic
scene of sexual assault, in which Neil Patrick
Harris pretends to be gay in order to get a girl
naked, straddles her and jerks off on her under
the premise of "giving a massage."

When confronted about the movie's
unabashed misogyny, though, Cho balks.
"I'm not aware [of any feminist backlash].
.. I feel like there's a lot of female fans out
there," he said. The movie's misogynistic trans
gressions are not as forgivable as its lesser
offenses, mostly because the misogyny is a good
deal more consistent.

At the end of the day, though, the movies
avoid being totally perverse by maintaining tan
gibly good intentions.
"The key to doing Harold and Kumar
movies," Cho explained, "is you make it earnest.
Primarily what we do is make Harold and
Kumar's relationship and friendship believable,
and we don't actually work on being that
funny."

Of the latest film, he explains that it's "a

perversion of Christmas movies, but it's also
very traditional, and it affirms family values,
and it's about love between the two guys, and
it's about love between their significant others,
and at its heart... the movie has a rather child
like innocence about it."

Cho makes a good point. The movies are
funny, but their over-the-top gags and occasion
ally offensive stereotyping would grow abrasive
if it weren't grounded by the entirely believable
platonic love story running in the background.
For the most part, Harold and Kumar's harm
less good intentions manage to erase the dam
age done by the rest of the script. All they need
are a few convincingly human female charac
ters, and the franchise will have found the per
fect recipe for non-offensive shock humor.
Until they do, though, all of John Cho's and the
writers' lovely good intentions won't be enough
to wash away their somewhat appalling treat
ment of women.

to wash away their somewhat appalling treat
ment of women.

The "Harold and Kumar" franchise is
known for its ability to push the limits
of what is socially acceptable, eagerly
casting aside conventions and nonchalantly
touching upon the most controversial of topics.
The most obvious (and perhaps least con
troversial in this particular setting) is its premise
as a stoner movie; by creating a charismatic duo
whose friendship is built around the happy
herb, the franchise inherently approves the use
of technically still-illegal drugs.
"Weed's fine," John Cho (Harold) said

vaguely.
Of his audience, he is less cagey.
"I love being affectionate with stoners,
they're the most affectionate people on the
planet," he said. "They're huggers."
Of course, the series doesn't stop with illicit
drugs. The latest movie, "A Very Harold and
Kumar Christmas," features a whole slew of
"edgy" concepts, including but not limited to
sexual assault, murder and a series of scenes
involving a toddler getting hooked on a whole
slew of exciting substances, among them pot,
cocaine and ecstasy
"To be fair, the child is a degenerate," Cho
joked.

Frequently, the franchise will take things
beyond what even the rudest and raunchiest of
moviegoers might consider normal. Hearken
back to the moment in "Harold and Kumar Go
to White Castle" when the dynamic duo is

trapped in a bathroom stall between two attrac
tive young ladies who are quite deafeningly
voiding their bowels. Who could forget that
extraordinarily long, shockingly realistic sex
scene between Kumar and a large, anthropo
morphic bag of weed? And if it's nudity you
want, the latest movie goes all out, shocking
viewers with an up-close-and-personal view of
poor Harold's flaccid penis, frozen to a tele
phone booth and shrunken by fear and pain,
not to mention the cold.

Cho was very frank about the little lifelike
appendage (a prosthetic), declaring that he
"obviously would've preferred a boa constric
tor" and explaining that, no, it was not actually
modeled after the real thing.
Does he have any misgivings about the
scene?
"Uh... yes," he said. "That was the part I
was most worried about my mother seeing."
But it's not enough to slow his stride.
The franchise deals with some of its more
controversial material with a surprisingly
respectable philosophy. Racial humor is a trade
mark of the series. The writers hold a sort of
post-racial attitude, seeing race as a factor that
can be acknowledged or mocked like any other
physical attribute, rather than the hot-button
topic that many make it out to be.

"The writers assume and the movies
assume that you're not a racist, and that we all
think it's silly," he said. "Race is a part of life, and
it comes in and out of focus, and it comes to

prominence and recedes, and that's how we
treat race in these movies." Cho's opinions seem
to hold true in regard to the series' treatment of
race after all, the films are populated by well
balanced characters that acknowledge race
without being defined by it.
The films stand on less steady ground on
the feminist front. Not a single one of the

movies features a fleshed-out female character,
instead displaying male-envisioned fantasies of
wildly attractive, violently sexual and infinitely
one-dimensional women. These cardboard

cutouts are placed in all kinds of delightful situ
ations: the latest movie even features a graphic
scene of sexual assault, in which Neil Patrick
Harris pretends to be gay in order to get a girl
naked, straddles her and jerks off on her under
the premise of "giving a massage."

When confronted about the movie's
unabashed misogyny, though, Cho balks.
"I'm not aware [of any feminist backlash].
.. I feel like there's a lot of female fans out
there," he said. The movie's misogynistic trans
gressions are not as forgivable as its lesser
offenses, mostly because the misogyny is a good
deal more consistent.

At the end of the day, though, the movies
avoid being totally perverse by maintaining tan
gibly good intentions.
"The key to doing Harold and Kumar
movies," Cho explained, "is you make it earnest.
Primarily what we do is make Harold and
Kumar's relationship and friendship believable,
and we don't actually work on being that
funny."

Of the latest film, he explains that it's "a

perversion of Christmas movies, but it's also
very traditional, and it affirms family values,
and it's about love between the two guys, and
it's about love between their significant others,
and at its heart... the movie has a rather child
like innocence about it."

Cho makes a good point. The movies are
funny, but their over-the-top gags and occasion
ally offensive stereotyping would grow abrasive
if it weren't grounded by the entirely believable
platonic love story running in the background.
For the most part, Harold and Kumar's harm
less good intentions manage to erase the dam
age done by the rest of the script. All they need
are a few convincingly human female charac
ters, and the franchise will have found the per
fect recipe for non-offensive shock humor.
Until they do, though, all of John Cho's and the
writers' lovely good intentions won't be enough
to wash away their somewhat appalling treat
ment of women.
