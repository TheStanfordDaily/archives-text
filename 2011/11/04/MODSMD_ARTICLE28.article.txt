cc f | he Rum Diary," based
on the Hunter S.
-L Thompson novel, stars

Johnny Depp as an American writer
whose self-imposed exile to Puerto
Rico in 1960 falls short of his Utopi
an dreams when he gets caught in
the crossfire between the island's

local natives and greedy expatriates.
Directed by Bruce Robinson, not
even the lush Caribbean scenery or
Hollywood heavyweights can quite
make up for a story as vapid as the
corrupt ruling class that Depp's char
acter ultimately tries to take down.
Paul Kemp (Depp) is a failed
novelist with a drinking problem
when he arrives in San Juan to begin
writing for the English-language San
Juan Star, a daily newspaper staffed
with misfits and, unbeknownst to
Kemp, on the verge of financial col
lapse. After an ill-fated first meeting,
the Star's high-strung editor relegates
Kemp to writing horoscopes, a

mindless task that grants the writer
more free time to indulge in what

the island has to offer - namely, as
the title suggests, rum. Teaming up
with photographer Bob Sala
(Michael Rispoli) and religious cor
respondent Moburg (Giovanni
Ribisi), Kemp embarks on a

debauched series of misadventures
that include cockfighting, spitting
fire at a cop and, subsequently, get
ting thrown in jail.

But between bouts of drunken
tomfoolery, a chance encounter with
real estate-mogul Hal Sanderson
(Aaron Echkart) threatens to con
strict Kemp's carefree lifestyle.

Against Sala's advice, Kemp agrees to
do some spin work on behalf of
Sanderson's latest project, which he
soon realizes will have serious reper
cussions for the local population and
environment. Extracting himself
from Sanderson's web of influence
proves difficult, however, especially as
Kemp has fallen head-over-heels for
Sanderson's femme fatale girlfriend
Chenault (Amber Heard).
While the cast features a well-

balanced mix of A-listers and up
and-comers, the film's weak writing
fails to provide them with anything
substantial. From the outset, Depp
plays the mumbling, bumbling
schmuck well, but in such away that
makes his sudden transformation
into a "serious writer" in the final act
implausible. With the exception of
Ribisi, who steals every scene he's in
as the supremely sloppy and barely

functioning alcoholic Moburg, we
are left with a collection of bland

characters capable of delivering the
occasional one-liner but overall lack-

ing in depth.
"The Rum Diary" plays like a
series of missed opportunities, not
just in regard to the talent involved
but also within the context of the

story. Set in mid-20th century Puerto
Rico, it barely scratches the surface

on the racial tensions, political
unrest, corporate greed and corrup
tion that were rampant on the island,
opting instead to focus on the glitz
and glamour of the elite. Thus, for a
story purportedly centered on indul
gence, it feels oddly restrained, which
is unfortunate given Thompson's
personal life and his legacy as a
writer.
Undeniably stylish but ultimate
ly just plain silly, "The Rum Diary" is
not unlike a night of heavy drinking
aimless and, in the big scheme of
things, doomed to fade to the recess
es of memory almost as soon as it
passes.
