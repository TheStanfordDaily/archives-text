There comes a time in every woman's life (at
least the ones born in the '9os) when she
can no longer live with the blind celebrity
worship of Justin Timberlake and finally admit
that he has the acting ability of a lawn chair
albeit a sexy, flexible one. Surprisingly, for me, it
wasn't during his supporting performance in
"The Social Network" or even during that farce of
a romantic comedy with Mila "Raccoon Face"
Kunis. My rite of passage happened after watching
his latest movie, "In Time," a science fiction film
set in a world where the problem of overpopula
tion is solved by allotting time as currency. While
human beings in this alternate world stop aging at
25, they only have another year left to live

unless they work for additional time or were born
in temporal wealth. Justin Timberlake stars as the
underprivileged protagonist, Will Salas, hell-bent
on destroying the system while winning the heart
of the heiress Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) who
is ironically born to benefit the system.
For those experiencing "Inception" with
drawals, "In Time" might seem like a remedy to
those epic psychological drama blues, but it's not.
If you're experiencing "romantic comedy with

actors with no
comedic tim
ing" with- j
drawals, then I
I do suggest
you pay $lO to

watch a mediocre

script with elementary dialogue as interpreted by
middle school talent.
However, I do give writer-director Andrew
Niccol, the same talent who wrote "Gattaca" and
"The Truman Show," some credit for his tantaliz
ing rumination on the concept of remaining for
ever young. His film had every potential to be an
intelligent dialogue on capitalism and its relation
ship with biological advances, but its interpreta

tion onscreen was too Hollywood, as if the value
of entertainment exceeded the need for character
development or motivation. The characters were
based on caricatures of a Hollywood cliche in an
alternative universe, and to make matters worse, a
young cast with little chemistry played the charac
ters. However, the performance of Cillian Murphy
as the antagonizing Timekeeper was on par with
his acting in "Inception." Murphy provided
momentary relief between Justin Timberlake's
poorly delivered lines and the gratuitous display
of Amanda Seyfried's hoisted breasts.
Despite what seems like an unfavorable
review, I would recommend this movie for those
interested in an entertaining and unintentional
action-comedy based on a promising, but unful
filling sci-fi concept. I laughed ... when I wasn't
supposed to. I cried... over the Chipotle burrito
that I couldn't buy because I spent the money on
a movie ticket. Overall, the film "In Time" could
potentially change your life, like it changed mine.
Now, I know that even I am equipped to write a
million-dollar Hollywood screenplay, starring red
carpet studs like Justin Timberlake and potentially
Channing Tatum, because I iz able to read and
write English good.
