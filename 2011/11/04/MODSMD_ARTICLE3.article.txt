## Stanford GSB recieves $100 million gift Endowment to fund institute seeking to alleviate poverty 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Graduate School of Business
(GSB) has received a $lOO million dollar gift
and a promise of $5O million dollars in match
ing funds if others donate to start a new initia
tive aimed at alleviating global poverty.

The Stanford Institute for Innovation in De
veloping Economies (SIIDE), pronounced and
known informally as "SEED," was funded by a
gift from Robert "Bob" King '6O and his wife,
Dorothy "Dottie" King.
The institute will have three main areas of
focus: research the major problems facing the
developing world and creating solutions; edu
cating both Stanford students and local busi
ness leaders in developing countries about in
business skills and problem solving and provid
ing on-the-ground support to entrepreneurs in
developing countries through advice, training
and technical support. SEED is set to host its
first research forum in March 2012.

Bob and Dottie King have host
ed Stanford international students
for more than 50 years, an experi
ence they say inspired this gift. Xi
angmin Cui '97 was one such inter
national student. Cui introduced
Mr. King, a Silicon Valley angel in
vestor, to his friend Eric Xu. With
the help of a seed investment from
King, Xu went on to co-found the
Chinese search engine "Baidu,"
which now posts revenue upwards
of $1 billion and is the sixth most vis
ited site on the Internet.

Another student who stayed
with the Kings, Zimbabwe native
Andreata Muforo 'O9, invited fellow
Stanford students who took part in a
global study trip to Africa for dinner
at the King's house.

"We heard how those first-hand
experiences compelled some of the
MBAs to return for internships in
Africa," said Dorothy King in a
press release. "We saw the direct
connection between the learning ex
perience and the motivation to
make change."

"This initiative is an enormous
opportunity for Stanford students,
faculty and on-the-ground entrepre
neurs to collaborate on the design
and incubation of new enterprises
and solutions," said Garth Saloner,
dean of the GSB, in a press release.
Hau Lee, a GSB professor who
will serve as the director of the insti
tute, hopes that the program will
help foster that attitude and provide
away for Stanford students to en
gage in business that also promotes
social good.
"[SEED] will help create train
ing, materials, curriculum and de
signs to educate aspiring entrepre
neurs in these developing coun
tries," Lee said in an interview with
The Daily.
Through supporting and inter
acting with entrepreneurs in devel
oping countries, Lee hopes that stu
dents matriculate with a desire to
make money in ways that promote
public good.
While SEED'S resources will pri
marily be available to students at the
GSB, it will also be available to Ph.D.
students in any department, as well as
graduate students in various depart
ments. The institute will seek to fund
and support student projects de
signed to improve the developing
world, and will encourage graduate

students in different departments to
take advantage of SEED's resources.

This multi-school interaction is
one of the reasons Lee says this ini
tiative rivals similar programs at sis
ter institutions. With SEED's "huge,
significant" endowment, Lee said
that other schools within Stanford,
such as the School of Medicine and
the Graduate School of Engineer
ing, would be enthusiastic about
partnering with the GSB on proj
ects.

SEED will not directly fund any
foreign businesses and will not oper
ate as a venture capital firm, but in
stead will fund student trips and

projects that seek to improve eco
nomic conditions in developing
countries.
"Students who have the heart
will not be limited by capacity or be
cause the course requires funding,"
Lee said. The program will also
allow students to go abroad and get
first-hand experience tackling prob
lems in the developing world.
With faculty support, undergrad
uates will be able to take advantage
of these resources by applying for
funding or support for student-cre
ated projects. However, Lee said
that SEED would not replace any
undergraduate department's re

quirements or responsibilities.
In addition to Lee, who will serve
as the overall director of the pro
gram and the head of the research
arm, Jesper Sprensen, a professor
and director of the Center for Social
Innovation at the GSB, will lead the
education and dissemination por
tions of the institute. Jim Patell and
Bill Meehan, both professors at the
GSB, will head up the on-the
ground activity and help provide
support to startups and NGOs in de
veloping countries.
