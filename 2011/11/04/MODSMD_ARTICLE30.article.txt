## 'Bones': Bringing up baby 
### â€” aaron BRODER contact aaron: abroder@stanford. edu 
I can't help but feel like last year's "Bones"
finale wasn't the game changer I thought it
was going to be. I mean, it could have been; it
should have been. I thought their choice to
resolve Booth and Bones' sexual tension off
screen and only let us see the aftermath was a
brilliant one, since that integral moment is often
so poorly handled it cheapens entire relationship.
Adding the baby was a risky move they have a
tendency to derail TV shows but it definitely
made the reveal more dramatic. Resolving an arc
that had been integral to the show's chemistry,
however, left one question on every "Bones" fan's
mind: will this ruin everything?
So I'll start off with the good news: I've
seen the first two episodes of the season, and so
far, Booth and Bones' relationship hasn't ruined
the show. But it hasn't really pushed the show
forward, either. The couple hasn't spent any of

the gap between seasons getting over the prob
lems that all "will they, won't they" couples tend
to go through during the first months of their
relationships. In this case, the relationship has

actually sent Bones a few steps backward social
ly. Both of the first two episodes have subplots
that basically boil down to her being insensitive
about how Booth feels. While some of the deci
sions seem in character, as I watched how many
missteps she made in the "The Hot Dog in the
Competition," the second episode of the season,
I couldn't help but feel that she's grown past this.
Sure, she's still awkward and misunderstands a
lot of nuance in day-to-day interaction, but her
evolution since the beginning of the show is a
major part of why they were finally able to get
together in the first place.
And even with a baby between them, it
doesn't really seem like Booth and Bones' rela
tionship has changed at all, at least beyond the
superficial. That's always the way it is with proce
dural isn't it? No matter how dramatic the
events around the characters are, you never see as
dramatic a change in the characters themselves.
This problem is systemic; it's not just limited to
the starring duo. You wouldn't know that
Hodgins and Angela had a baby in last season's

finale if they didn't occa
sionally throw in an extra

scene featuring their son to remind you about it.
That's why I was so impressed by their decision to
kill off the intern, Nigel-Murray, last season. No
matter how much I liked the character, the fact
that the writers actually changed the structure of
their show (though admittedly the interns are a
little interchangeable) blew me away. I was slightly
less impressed when I found out it only happened
because the actor was off to Syfy's "Alphas," but
the definitiveness with which they ended his
tenure was still fairly bold. It's unlikely we'll ever
see as bold a decision with the starring cast.
Maybe I expected a little bit too much
from "Bones." The episodes are as entertaining
as they've always been, and saying that the rela
tionships haven't changed isn't really a bad
thing; after all, isn't that what brings us back

every week? If you've always enjoyed "Bones,"
then as far as I can tell, you will continue enjoy
ing it into the future. I'm just a little upset with
how the writers are misusing this opportunity.

They have a chance to really see how this rela
tionship and this baby would change who
Booth and, in particular, Bones as people. Of
course, there are still a few episodes until the
baby's born and who knows what will happen
after that. In the meantime, last season's "game
changer" was anything but.
