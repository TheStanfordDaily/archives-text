# A 						FAIRYTALE SHOWDOWN

After a tumultuous fall for several new fall
dramas (soapy series "Revenge" has
found ratings success while the much
hyped "Playboy Club" is already cancelled, and
"Pan Am's performance has been turbulent) two
networks are rolling the dice on series based on
fairytales. The shows, "Once Upon A Time" and
"Grimm," use similar source material in very dif
ferent ways and with mixed results.
"Once Upon A Time" creates a multifaceted
and complex fantasy world —which is expected
considering Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis,
who wrote "Lost," are penning the script. The
story switches back and forth from an actual
fairytale world to the small town of Storybrooke,
Maine, where the fairytale characters live but are
in the dark about their true identities.

This all threatens to change when 10-year
old Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) tracks down his
birth mother Emma Swan (played by Jennifer
Morrison from "House"). Armed with a thick
book of fairytales, he knows the truth about the
town's inhabitants, and begs Emma to help him.
As we find out in simultaneous flashbacks,

Emma is in fact the daughter of Snow White
and Prince Charming and is the "chosen one"
the town has been waiting for.
Awash with love stories and soap-opera sto-

rylines, "Once Upon A Time" gets bogged down
in the complicated mythology and jarring
switches from fantasy world to real life. However,
Morrison is compelling as Emma, a self-pro
fessed loner, and Lana Parrilla (as the evil queen
and mayor of Storybrooke) is quietly menacing.
As the series begins to delve into individual fairy
tales over the next few weeks, it could either get
more interesting and addictive or complicated
and difficult. Depending on how the next
episodes turn out, it could become one of the
best new dramas of the fall.

"Grimm," on the other hand, is a much
more straightforward adaptation of a fairytale.
Instead of using actual fairytale characters, it
draws on some elements of fairytales to build a
new mythology. David Giuntoli stars as Nick
Burnhardt, a police officer who discovers that
he's a Grimm, someone chosen to hunt the
supernatural forces in the world.

"Grimm" is essentially a crime procedural
with elements of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and
"Supernatural" thrown in. The tone is dark, and
despite a few efforts at buddy comedy between
Burnhardt and his partner Hank Griffin (Russell
Homsby), the show remains quite serious
and therefore somewhat hard to take seriously.
In the pilot episode, refer
ences to fairytale classic "Litde

Red Riding Hood" are every-

where little girls in red hoodies, preyed on
by werewolf-like monsters called 'blutbadden,'
waiting to be saved by the cops. In this sense,
"Grimm" embraces old-school fairytale gender
roles, where the innocent girls wait to be saved
by the heroes, while "Once Upon A Time" fea
tures a more varied cast of heroes and villains,
both male and female.

Still, for fans of crime shows, "Grimm"
could grow into an enjoyable series that takes
the best of crime procedural while employing
its own creative mythology. But before that
happens, it will have to overcome its rather dull
hero and tired gender roles.
