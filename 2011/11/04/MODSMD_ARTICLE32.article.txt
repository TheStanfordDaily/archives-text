# ADVICE
## ROXY SASS DON'T HOOK UP HERE 
### 
Roxy is all about acting on
instinct, and when the urge
strikes, you might just have
to pull that cutie into the closet for a
quickie. She's found, though, that
one rule applies to hookups as well
as real estate: location, location, loca
tion. After collecting enough
research to write a good-sized thesis
(unfortunately, the Psychology
Department nixed her proposal),
Roxy's proud to present her guide to
keeping it in your pants.
Lake Lag
While Roxy's gotten her share of
sweet, Suites lovin', West Campus is
host to Roxy's number-one site to
not have sex: Lake Lag. Roxy defi
nitely understands the temptation
for a roll in the hay on the way back
from the Row, but they don't call it a
"roll in the should-be-a-lake-but
isn't" for a reason. Nothing ruins a
moment more than realizing there's
an endangered salamander trying to
get in on the action. And though
Roxy wouldn't deny certain exhibi
tionist tendencies, the possibility that
her audience might include a hungry
mountain lion is enough to keep her
clothes on Roxy likes her men to
be animals in bed, but she doesn't
want any actual animals involved.
MemChu
Roxy's no Virgin Mary, but even
she knows MemChu is a no-boning
zone. If you're not planning to "make
room for Jesus," Roxy suggests you
get a room elsewhere. Check out
other dark corners of the Quad if
you're looking for a Full Moon
throwback.
Old Union
Roxy was always an advocate of
demonstrating how to use the
Wellness Room to its fullest poten-

tial. And what better way to de-stress
than to undress? But now that there
are no longer beanbag chairs and
body paint at Roxy's disposal, Old
Union is a little too ... fluorescent to
get Roxy in the mood. For those of
you trying to "knock helmets" with
grad students, so to speak, Old
Union is a good place to start, but
Roxy recommends you bring the
party back to EV where the scent of
Axe and Palm burgers isn't quite as
strong.
The Claw
Though Roxy enjoys getting wet,
this fountain's seen too much action,
even for her. And there's also the risk
of a dangerous accident on the spikes
of the claw Roxy prefers her pene
tration to involve men, not metal.
Late Nite
Roxy loves to put on a show, but
hoards of drunk frosh watching her
get her groove on turns that sizzle
into stale pretty quickly.
Your room isn't on Roxy's list for a rea
son. Invite her over to "knock helmets"
