# PLAYING SPOILER
## Postseason no longer a reality 
### TORSTEIN HOSET 
Coming off a bye week after a somewhat
disappointing road trip to the Pacific North
west, the Cardinal looks to wrap up its home
season in style as it hosts San Diego State

and UCLA at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium this
weekend. Pac-12 leader and No. 8 UCLA
(12-4-1,7-0-0 Pac-12) comes to Stanford on
Sunday with a perfect conference record,
needing only one point to clinch the confer
ence title, while No. 20 San Diego State (10-
4-2,4-3-0), which went down 3-0 at home to
second-placed Washington last weekend,
needs a win on Friday to remain in con
tention for an NCAA Tournament berth.

The Cardinal's very marginal postseason

aspirations were put to a definite rest two
weekends ago as it came up short and failed
to make chances pay off against Oregon
State and Washington. But while pessimists
might say that there's nothing left to play
for and that the season is effectively over,
head coach Bret Simon still finds motiva
tion going into the closing stages of the sea
son.

"I think it's two-fold: We really want to
reward the seniors and make sure that they
have an opportunity to finish off strong and
leave with an impression that they've
helped the program along," Simon said. "In
addition to that, we're always looking to the
future. We want to give the younger guys
confidence going forward and make them
realize that they can beat stronger teams."

Junior defender Hunter Gorskie under
lined that the team's pride and self-respect
is paramount in building locker room spirit
going into the weekend's games.
"We play for pride, for the fans," he said.
"We want to put on a good performance for
them. The attitude of the guys is that there's
always something left to play for."
When asked if the possibility of sabotag
ing their visitors' postseason chances adds
incentive for the players, Gorskie's eyes lit
up.

"It definitely does. We have a good
record against them at home, and we want
to keep it that way," Gorskie said, referring
to Stanford's impressive four-game winning
streak at home against the Bruins. The Car
dinal also beat the Aztecs at Cagan Stadium
last season in a 1-0 thriller.

this year, the squad still hopes to play an entertaining set of matches this weekend.
