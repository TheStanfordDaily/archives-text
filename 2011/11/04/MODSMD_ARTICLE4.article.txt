# PLAYING SPOILER
## Postseason no longer a reality 
### TORSTEIN HOSET 
Coming off a bye week after a somewhat
disappointing road trip to the Pacific North
west, the Cardinal looks to wrap up its home
season in style as it hosts San Diego State

and UCLA at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium this
weekend. Pac-12 leader and No. 8 UCLA
(12-4-1,7-0-0 Pac-12) comes to Stanford on
Sunday with a perfect conference record,
needing only one point to clinch the confer
ence title, while No. 20 San Diego State (10-
4-2,4-3-0), which went down 3-0 at home to
second-placed Washington last weekend,
needs a win on Friday to remain in con
tention for an NCAA Tournament berth.

The Cardinal's very marginal postseason

aspirations were put to a definite rest two
weekends ago as it came up short and failed
to make chances pay off against Oregon
State and Washington. But while pessimists
might say that there's nothing left to play
for and that the season is effectively over,
head coach Bret Simon still finds motiva
tion going into the closing stages of the sea
son.

"I think it's two-fold: We really want to
reward the seniors and make sure that they
have an opportunity to finish off strong and
leave with an impression that they've
helped the program along," Simon said. "In
addition to that, we're always looking to the
future. We want to give the younger guys
confidence going forward and make them
realize that they can beat stronger teams."

Junior defender Hunter Gorskie under
lined that the team's pride and self-respect
is paramount in building locker room spirit
going into the weekend's games.
"We play for pride, for the fans," he said.
"We want to put on a good performance for
them. The attitude of the guys is that there's
always something left to play for."
When asked if the possibility of sabotag
ing their visitors' postseason chances adds
incentive for the players, Gorskie's eyes lit
up.

"It definitely does. We have a good
record against them at home, and we want
to keep it that way," Gorskie said, referring
to Stanford's impressive four-game winning
streak at home against the Bruins. The Car
dinal also beat the Aztecs at Cagan Stadium
last season in a 1-0 thriller.

Junior defender Hunter Gorskie said that despite the Cardinal's inability to make the postseason
this year, the squad still hopes to play an entertaining set of matches this weekend.
come its scoring struggles, which
have been all too apparent for most
of the season the total count
shows just 13 goals in 15 games
by taking a more attacking ap
proach this weekend. Simon has
shown stoic faith in his team's abil
ity to score all season, maintaining
that his team is creating chances
and playing better and better with

each game, but even the patience of
a saint must come to an end.

"Typically, I give my teams a
lot of freedom," he said. "This
team has had a little less success
with that, so we've played a little
bit more controlled, but we seem
to be developing. The guys are
playing better and better, so
they'll get more opportunities to
make decisions of their own and
maybe play a style that's more at
tractive."

With little to lose, it seems like
Simon will be fielding a more offen
sive lineup than has been the case

earlier in the season. He empha
sizes the importance of his midfield
men being on top form, asserting
their instrumental role in the offen
sive game, but also eyes the possi
bility of others getting more attack
ing roles.
"[Sophomore midfielder] J.J.
Koval and [junior midfielder]
Dersu Abdolfathi have had a very
good couple of weeks, and they're
going to be main stage in our mid
field," Simon said.
"When they play well, the pos
session game works way more ef
fectively ... We've been putting

more attacking players on the field
at the same time in the last two or
three games, and we're giving our
outside backs more freedom to go
forward, so theoretically we should
have a very offensive-minded team
on the field."

The Cardinal was swept in two
tight road games in Southern Cali
fornia in the beginning of October.
Gorskie consolidates Simon's as
sertion that the team will take a dif
ferent approach to these games
than was the case on the road. When
asked whether he thinks the fact
that the pressure is off allows for

more room to experiment with the
playing style, he reacted affirma
tively.

"Yeah, definitely, I would say so.
Last time around we had the mind
set that we were going to play com
pact and look for the counterat
tack," Gorskie said. "This time it
will be different."

Friday's game against the Aztecs
kicks off at 7 p.m., while Stanford
will look to upset the Bruins on
Sunday at 1 p.m.

to make chances pay off against Oregon
State and Washington. But while pessimists
might say that there's nothing left to play
for and that the season is effectively over,
head coach Bret Simon still finds motiva
tion going into the closing stages of the sea
son.

"I think it's two-fold: We really want to
reward the seniors and make sure that they
have an opportunity to finish off strong and
leave with an impression that they've
helped the program along," Simon said. "In
addition to that, we're always looking to the
future. We want to give the younger guys
confidence going forward and make them
realize that they can beat stronger teams."

Junior defender Hunter Gorskie under
lined that the team's pride and self-respect
is paramount in building locker room spirit
going into the weekend's games.
"We play for pride, for the fans," he said.
"We want to put on a good performance for
them. The attitude of the guys is that there's
always something left to play for."
When asked if the possibility of sabotag
ing their visitors' postseason chances adds
incentive for the players, Gorskie's eyes lit
up.

"It definitely does. We have a good
record against them at home, and we want
to keep it that way," Gorskie said, referring
to Stanford's impressive four-game winning
streak at home against the Bruins. The Car
dinal also beat the Aztecs at Cagan Stadium
last season in a 1-0 thriller.

The Cardinal will be looking to over


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Junior defender Hunter Gorskie said that despite the Cardinal's inability to make the postseason
this year, the squad still hopes to play an entertaining set of matches this weekend.
come its scoring struggles, which
have been all too apparent for most
of the season the total count
shows just 13 goals in 15 games
by taking a more attacking ap
proach this weekend. Simon has
shown stoic faith in his team's abil
ity to score all season, maintaining
that his team is creating chances
and playing better and better with

each game, but even the patience of
a saint must come to an end.

"Typically, I give my teams a
lot of freedom," he said. "This
team has had a little less success
with that, so we've played a little
bit more controlled, but we seem
to be developing. The guys are
playing better and better, so
they'll get more opportunities to
make decisions of their own and
maybe play a style that's more at
tractive."

With little to lose, it seems like
Simon will be fielding a more offen
sive lineup than has been the case

earlier in the season. He empha
sizes the importance of his midfield
men being on top form, asserting
their instrumental role in the offen
sive game, but also eyes the possi
bility of others getting more attack
ing roles.
"[Sophomore midfielder] J.J.
Koval and [junior midfielder]
Dersu Abdolfathi have had a very
good couple of weeks, and they're
going to be main stage in our mid
field," Simon said.
"When they play well, the pos
session game works way more ef
fectively ... We've been putting

more attacking players on the field
at the same time in the last two or
three games, and we're giving our
outside backs more freedom to go
forward, so theoretically we should
have a very offensive-minded team
on the field."

The Cardinal was swept in two
tight road games in Southern Cali
fornia in the beginning of October.
Gorskie consolidates Simon's as
sertion that the team will take a dif
ferent approach to these games
than was the case on the road. When
asked whether he thinks the fact
that the pressure is off allows for

more room to experiment with the
playing style, he reacted affirma
tively.

"Yeah, definitely, I would say so.
Last time around we had the mind
set that we were going to play com
pact and look for the counterat
tack," Gorskie said. "This time it
will be different."

Friday's game against the Aztecs
kicks off at 7 p.m., while Stanford
will look to upset the Bruins on
Sunday at 1 p.m.
