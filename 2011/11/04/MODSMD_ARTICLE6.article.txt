### MARSHALL WATKINS 
The spread of the "Occupy" move
ment to the West Coast which includ

on protesters in Oakland last Tuesday
has involved both Stanford students and
law enforcement officers from the Palo
Alto Police Department (PD) and the
Stanford Department of Public Safety.

Stanford sheriffs and Palo Alto PD
officers were dispatched to Oakland last
Tuesday in response to a "mutual aid" re

Clara County Sheriffs Office, which
asked police departments within the
county for spare personnel. Oakland PD
had requested assistance with crowd

the altercations.

Palo Alto PD does not arm officers
with rubber bullets, but officers deployed
