## STUDENT LIFE Occupy movement at Stanford Cops, students and faculty all involved in movement 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
The spread of the "Occupy" move
ment to the West Coast which includ
ed a heavily publicized police crackdown
on protesters in Oakland last Tuesday
has involved both Stanford students and
law enforcement officers from the Palo
Alto Police Department (PD) and the
Stanford Department of Public Safety.

Stanford Police in Oakland
Stanford sheriffs and Palo Alto PD
officers were dispatched to Oakland last
Tuesday in response to a "mutual aid" re
quest from Oakland PD to the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office, which
asked police departments within the
county for spare personnel. Oakland PD
had requested assistance with crowd
control in response to growing protests.
Police attempts to evict protesters
from their camp in an Oakland city plaza
on Tuesday, Oct. 25 resulted in sustained
confrontations with the use of riot gear
and less-than-lethal ammunition. Ac
cording to city officials, 85 arrests were
made and at least one protester. Marine
veteran Scott Olsen, was critically in
jured.

William Larson, spokesman for the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
(DPS), said that five sheriffs a ser
geant and four deputies were dis
patched to the incident.

Palo Alto PD sent 10 officers trained
in crowd control and tactics, two lieu
tenants and a staffed Mobile Emergency
Operations Center (MEOC), according
to Sgt. Kara Apple of the Palo Alto PD.
The city chief of police authorized the
deployment from Palo Alto.
Approximately 100 officers were dis
patched from Santa Clara County as a
whole on the Oct. 25. At no point since
then have Palo Alto PD officers been
dispatched again to Bay Area "Occupy"
protests, Apple said.

Protesters at Occupy Oakland threw
"rocks, bottles and other objects" at Palo
Alto PD officers, according to Apple,
and Oakland PD reported officers being
physically assaulted by protesters. No of
ficers from Palo Alto PD were injured in
the altercations.

Palo Alto PD does not arm officers
with rubber bullets, but officers deployed
"pepper ball" ammunition less-than
lethal rounds loaded with pepper spray
against protesters. Apple said that
"officers deployed CS gas under Oak
land PD direction after coming under
projectile fire" from protesters as well.
Apple added that the CS gas canisters
were administered "correctly" without
malfunction and had been thrown
into areas away from protesters and
flammable objects. Palo Alto PD CS
gas canisters are manually deployed
and designed to burn internally, emit
ting smoke without any explosion.

Students protest
On Thursday, Oct. 27, several Stan
ford students attended the Occupy
San Francisco protests in anticipation
of a rumored police raid on the pro
testers' campsite. Matt Walter 'l4 said
that he saw at least four other under
graduates, in addition to a few recent
alumni, in attendance at the event.

This was the second time Walter
had visited the Occupy San Francisco
campsite.

"The country is headed for a
change in wealth distribution and
corporate responsibility," Walter said.
He noted that the protests offered
a "once in a generation opportunity
to participate."

While the first time he had attend
ed the protests had been the result of
a friend's encouragement, Walter ex
pressed his interest in going back to a
Bay Area Occupy protest in the fu
ture.

Walter described a "carnival-like
atmosphere" at the Occupy camp
sites, with bands playing throughout
the night in the midst of 40 to 50 tents.
However, he added that there was
also "a lot of sitting around and wait
ing."

Despite the general discontent
with the status quo among the pro
testers, he noted a "good amount of
thrill seekers" embracing the occa
sion to protest. Nevertheless, Walter

said that part of the power of the
movement was its diversity.
"The range of demographics
[among the protesters] was amaz
ing," Walter said.
Tensions rose sharply at the camp
site on Thursday night as reports and
photographs of police staging in riot
gear trickled through the camp.
Protest organizers had separated
those who would be willing to risk po
lice arrest from those who would not.
Walter said that "it was clear what
measures people would take" in the
event of a police raid.
A large contingent of the protes
tors was "absolutely" ready to contest
possession of the campsite with riot
police, according to Walter.

"We had our masks on and vine
gar to combat tear gas," he said.
However the police decided not
to raid the camp that night, which was
the same night that several mayoral
candidates and city supervisors visit
ed the campsite.

Stanford's role in the Occupy
movement

The ASSU sponsored an open
forum on Thursday night to discuss
Stanford's role in the Occupy move
ment.This roundtable occurred in the
wake of a walkout staged by Harvard
economics students in solidarity with
the Occupy Wall Street movement.
The meeting, which occurred on
Thursday night and had about 40
people in attendance, consisted of un
dergraduates, graduates and faculty
members. Approximately half of the
assembled group had attended at
least one Occupy protest, with many
having protested during the Occupy
Oakland's takeover of the city port
on Nov. 2.

The group discussed future events
at which the group could protest and
develop the Occupy Stanford move

ment. Motivations for the Stanford
protestors varied significantly, with
individuals expressing their discon
tent with wealth inequality, corrup
tion in government and business, so
cial issues, government spending pri
orities and incidents such as the
Oakland PD crackdowns that en
danger "people's right to be safe in
their own city from those who pur
port to protect them." Members high
lighted the need to highlight social is
sues in the communities surrounding

the "Stanford bubble" and make the
Stanford community aware of ongo
ing injustices.

The group also sought to explore
how the University fit into the de
bate, noting the need to tailor the Oc
cupy movement's message and meth
ods to a Stanford community more
closely linked to the "1 percent" than
other locations targeted by Occupy
protests.They also sought to establish
a set of objectives for the Occupy
Stanford movement unique to the

University's situation.
While the Occupy movement
only arrived on campus with the
walkout staged on Nov. 2, group
members expressed their apprecia
tion for a movement that offered an
umbrella and practical template for
addressing global issues and which,
for them, "has already touched Stan
ford in a very real way."

Stanford's role in the Occupy
movement

The ASSU sponsored an open
forum on Thursday night to discuss
Stanford's role in the Occupy move
ment.This roundtable occurred in the
wake of a walkout staged by Harvard
economics students in solidarity with
the Occupy Wall Street movement.
The meeting, which occurred on
Thursday night and had about 40
people in attendance, consisted of un
dergraduates, graduates and faculty
members. Approximately half of the
assembled group had attended at
least one Occupy protest, with many
having protested during the Occupy
Oakland's takeover of the city port
on Nov. 2.

The group discussed future events
at which the group could protest and
develop the Occupy Stanford move

ment. Motivations for the Stanford
protestors varied significantly, with
individuals expressing their discon
tent with wealth inequality, corrup
tion in government and business, so
cial issues, government spending pri
orities and incidents such as the
Oakland PD crackdowns that en
danger "people's right to be safe in
their own city from those who pur
port to protect them." Members high
lighted the need to highlight social is
sues in the communities surrounding

the "Stanford bubble" and make the
Stanford community aware of ongo
ing injustices.

The group also sought to explore
how the University fit into the de
bate, noting the need to tailor the Oc
cupy movement's message and meth
ods to a Stanford community more
closely linked to the "1 percent" than
other locations targeted by Occupy
protests.They also sought to establish
a set of objectives for the Occupy
Stanford movement unique to the

University's situation.
While the Occupy movement
only arrived on campus with the
walkout staged on Nov. 2, group
members expressed their apprecia
tion for a movement that offered an
umbrella and practical template for
addressing global issues and which,
for them, "has already touched Stan
ford in a very real way."

Paramedics tended to the injuries of an Occupy Oakland protester who was struck by a car at the intersection of
11th Street and Broadway during a demonstration on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2011, in Oakland, Calif. Stanford students
and police officers have attended many of the Occupy movements in the Bay Area.
The spread of the "Occupy" move
ment to the West Coast which includ
ed a heavily publicized police crackdown
on protesters in Oakland last Tuesday
has involved both Stanford students and
law enforcement officers from the Palo
Alto Police Department (PD) and the
Stanford Department of Public Safety.

Stanford Police in Oakland
Stanford sheriffs and Palo Alto PD
officers were dispatched to Oakland last
Tuesday in response to a "mutual aid" re
quest from Oakland PD to the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Office, which
asked police departments within the
county for spare personnel. Oakland PD
had requested assistance with crowd
control in response to growing protests.
Police attempts to evict protesters
from their camp in an Oakland city plaza
on Tuesday, Oct. 25 resulted in sustained
confrontations with the use of riot gear
and less-than-lethal ammunition. Ac
cording to city officials, 85 arrests were
made and at least one protester. Marine
veteran Scott Olsen, was critically in
jured.

William Larson, spokesman for the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
(DPS), said that five sheriffs a ser
geant and four deputies were dis
patched to the incident.

Palo Alto PD sent 10 officers trained
in crowd control and tactics, two lieu
tenants and a staffed Mobile Emergency
Operations Center (MEOC), according
to Sgt. Kara Apple of the Palo Alto PD.
The city chief of police authorized the
deployment from Palo Alto.
Approximately 100 officers were dis
patched from Santa Clara County as a
whole on the Oct. 25. At no point since
then have Palo Alto PD officers been
dispatched again to Bay Area "Occupy"
protests, Apple said.

Protesters at Occupy Oakland threw
"rocks, bottles and other objects" at Palo
Alto PD officers, according to Apple,
and Oakland PD reported officers being
physically assaulted by protesters. No of
ficers from Palo Alto PD were injured in
the altercations.

Palo Alto PD does not arm officers
with rubber bullets, but officers deployed
"pepper ball" ammunition less-than
lethal rounds loaded with pepper spray
against protesters. Apple said that
"officers deployed CS gas under Oak
land PD direction after coming under
projectile fire" from protesters as well.
Apple added that the CS gas canisters
were administered "correctly" without
malfunction and had been thrown
into areas away from protesters and
flammable objects. Palo Alto PD CS
gas canisters are manually deployed
and designed to burn internally, emit
ting smoke without any explosion.

Students protest
On Thursday, Oct. 27, several Stan
ford students attended the Occupy
San Francisco protests in anticipation
of a rumored police raid on the pro
testers' campsite. Matt Walter 'l4 said
that he saw at least four other under
graduates, in addition to a few recent
alumni, in attendance at the event.

This was the second time Walter
had visited the Occupy San Francisco
campsite.

"The country is headed for a
change in wealth distribution and
corporate responsibility," Walter said.
He noted that the protests offered
a "once in a generation opportunity
to participate."

While the first time he had attend
ed the protests had been the result of
a friend's encouragement, Walter ex
pressed his interest in going back to a
Bay Area Occupy protest in the fu
ture.

Walter described a "carnival-like
atmosphere" at the Occupy camp
sites, with bands playing throughout
the night in the midst of 40 to 50 tents.
However, he added that there was
also "a lot of sitting around and wait
ing."

Despite the general discontent
with the status quo among the pro
testers, he noted a "good amount of
thrill seekers" embracing the occa
sion to protest. Nevertheless, Walter

said that part of the power of the
movement was its diversity.
"The range of demographics
[among the protesters] was amaz
ing," Walter said.
Tensions rose sharply at the camp
site on Thursday night as reports and
photographs of police staging in riot
gear trickled through the camp.
Protest organizers had separated
those who would be willing to risk po
lice arrest from those who would not.
Walter said that "it was clear what
measures people would take" in the
event of a police raid.
A large contingent of the protes
tors was "absolutely" ready to contest
possession of the campsite with riot
police, according to Walter.

"We had our masks on and vine
gar to combat tear gas," he said.
However the police decided not
to raid the camp that night, which was
the same night that several mayoral
candidates and city supervisors visit
ed the campsite.
