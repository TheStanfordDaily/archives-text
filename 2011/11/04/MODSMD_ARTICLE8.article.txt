## Panel analyzes Muslims in entertainment 
### KURT CHIRBAS DESK EDITOR 
While Hollywood has backed away from
some of the more negative depictions of Islam in
recent years, the industry has not replaced these
stereotypical Muslim characters with more ac
curate portrayals, according to Camille Alick,
program director of Muslims on Screen and
Television (MOST).

"So the flat terrorist that you would've seen
10 years ago, they've stepped back," Alick said.
"In fact, there was a research study done recent
ly that said most of [the terrorists] being depict
ed now are white, home-grown terrorists, but we
still need more authentic and diverse depictions
[of Muslims]."

This comment was made Thursday at a panel
discussion about how Islam is represented in
wide range of media platforms, including film,
television and print journalism. The event was
the first in a series called "We the People: Islam
and U.S. Politics" which the Abbasi Program in
Islamic Studies is hosting throughout the 2011-
2012 academic year. The American Studies Pro
ject also co-sponsored the night's talk.

Vincent Barletta, the event's moderator and
a professor of Iberian and Latin American cul
tures, said the series was especially important
given that 2012 will be an election year. He said
he hoped the series would give the audience in
formation and a chance for reflection before

they voted next November.
Michael Wolfe, co-founder of Unity Produc
tions Foundations, said that the "misleading and
sometimes inflammatory stories" about Islam
are primarily being generated by a "small num
ber of anti-Muslim muckrakers financed by
large entities behind the scenes."
He said Internet bloggers and AM radio
broadcasters will often create negative Muslim
stories that are then picked up by major cable
news stations. He cited the recent Koran burning
in Florida and the debate over a mosque near
Ground Zero as two stories started by bloggers
that did not merit attention by the national press.
"I think it's about defeating [President]
Barack Obama by implicating him in something
that is 'un-American,'" Wolfe said, referring to
the fact that many online bloggers have claimed
Obama is a Muslim despite the fact Obama has
publicly stated he is a member of the United
Church of Christ. "And if you can link Islam to
something that is un-American, then you got
your argument right there."
Wolfe said that he did see hope for more ac
curate Muslim depictions, especially in televi
sion.
"There was no Daily Show in the 19505," he
said. "There was no Colbert Report. There was
no PBS either."
As a result of these shows, he said Americans
have developed "pretty good crap detectors."
Alick agreed, showing clips from CBS's The

Good Wife, one of the shows she said had been
making advancements in representing Muslims.
According to Alick, television had a great capac
ity to change people's perception of the world.
"Everyone knows this is fiction. This is not re
ality," she said. "But these shows get 20 million
viewers a week, and they watch television and
believe what they see, even if it's a fictional
story."

She said a lot of work is currently focused on
getting positive depictions of Muslims in video
games, noting that it is a $4O billion a year indus
try. According to Alick, there's very little diversi
ty of any kind in video games because they are
primarily both consumed and designed by "35-
year-old white males."
Wolfe said he is currently collaborating with
Umair Khan who previously developed a
game for Facebook called Secret√üuilders on
a medieval adventure game that takes place dur
ing a Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.
He said Facebook and other mobile plat
forms are helping to level the playing field.
Joel Brinkley, professor in communication
who has reported extensively abroad, spoke
about the portrayals of Muslims in print journal
ism. He said journalists are told never to impose
their own values on other cultures when they are
reporting, but that this can often become compli
cated.
"There's an aphorism we use to
describe what we do as journalists:
We don't write about the planes that
don't crash," he said. "We write
about the things that are unusual."
"As much as we try not to judge
other countries based on our own
values, what's news to me is always
going to be different between what
is news to the people in the country
I cover," Brinkley said.
Wolfe, however, commented that

this often means that only negative
stories are told about Muslims in the
news.

"What you are describing is a
neurological fact: Neurologists reck
on that it takes 14 positive impres
sions to wipe out one negative im
pression," Wolf said. "If, as Brinkley
says, we are involved, in print jour
nalism and journalism in general, in
not writing about the planes that fly
but only writing about the one that
went down ... then from my point
of view, entertainment can be a kind
of counterbalance to that."
