## Technology not the only key to edu reform, says Kim Content and empowering students critical to success

Paul Kim, assistant dean and chief
technology officer at the School of Edu
cation, emphasized that technology is
not a complete solution to improving
education in developing countries in a
filled Wallenberg Theater on Thursday
evening.

The event was part of the Liberation
Technology series put on by the Center
for Democracy, Development and the
Rule of Law. Kim's presentation focused
on the significant number of under-edu
cated children in the world, noting that
more than 67 million children are out of
school and many more are going to
schools of very poor quality. Kim dis
cussed how to best utilize technology to
improve global education.
"A lot of people think delivery and
display means learning," Kim said. "And
that's a huge problem."

Kim was recently part of a panel that
evaluated the effectiveness of the distri
bution of more than 450,000 laptops in
Uruguay. The panel found that only 25
percent of the students brought their
laptops to school, a figure Kim blames
on a lack of engagement.
"Many of these projects focus on unit
cost. They talk about how many units
have been deployed ... We need to focus
on new areas, to find away to cause and

support self-initiated learning."
"Innovation and technology will not
be centered around a piece of technolo
gy," Kim said, suggesting instead that
educational reformers should focus on
content and promoting self-initiated
learning.

This point was particularly resonant
given Stanford's connection with Silicon
Valley. Kim was sure to make it clear
that technology is only part of the solu
tion, and educational reform must be
comprehensive.

Many of the programs that have had
success bypassed teachers entirely,
going straight to children and giving
them mobile learning devices.
"I tell them aliens gave me the de
vices, and I don't know anything about
these devices. So don't ask me any ques
tions," Kim said. This tactic drastically
decreased the learning curve, and stu
dents figured out the devices much
more quickly than teacher-training pro
grams.

This tactic also helped avoid prob
lems like a lack of power or electricity.
By hooking up these devices to cheap
bicycles, Kim managed to create an "80-
dollar moving school," with a 20-minute
bike ride fully charging the mobile de
vice.

Despite these efforts however, some
areas simply don't have the resources to
fund things like science experiments.
"Ninety percent of children today
will not have experiments in their class
rooms," Kim said. To try to solve this
problem, Kim helped developed a Re-
