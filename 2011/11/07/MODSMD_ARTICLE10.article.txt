## PROFILE Blurring racial boundaries 
### STEPHANIE WANG 
Is the woman in the picture "white,"
"black," "Asian/Pacific Islander,"
"Hispanic" or "Other?" A click of the
mouse suggests that the answer may
not be so clear.

Assistant professor of sociology Aliya
Saperstein recently published research on
the effect of an individual's socioeconomic
status on his or her perception of race. In
this study, recently featured in The New
York Times, participants were asked to play
a computer game in which they were
shown pictures of morphed faces of differ
ent races. According to Saperstein's re
search, people wearing suits were more
likely to be considered "white" as opposed
to people who were wearing janitorial
clothing. Her research suggests that race is
not as objective or discrete as one may
think, and factors such as what type of
clothing someone is wearing can influence
one's perception of race.
Saperstein's interest in studying race
has roots in her undergraduate and gradu
ate-level education. She received a bache
lor's degree in sociology from the Universi
ty of Washington and a Ph.D. in sociology
and demography from UC-Berkeley.
"I've always been interested in the so
cial construction of race," Saperstein said.
"It's an idea that has been floating around
in a lot of disciplines for a long time but
doesn't seem to filter into the way people
do their research or the way they think
about race in their everyday lives."
"A lot of what I've been interested in is
finding ways to empirically test some of the
ideas about how race is socially construct
ed," she added.
Her research is largely focused on racial
fluidity, boundaries, stereotypes and hierar
chies as well as the measurement of race in
surveys and studies.
According to Saperstein, as interracial

families have become more common, it has
grown progressively harder to identify
someone's racial identity.
Saperstein collaborated with Jonathan
Freeman and Matthias Scheutz, both from
Tufts University, Andrew Penner from UC-
Irvine and psychology professor Nalini
Ambady on this research. The technology
used in the study was first employed by
Ambady's lab in a similar project created
to assess how individuals categorize gen
der.
"When people categorize others, it's a
dynamic process," Ambady said. "It's not a
static process. We're always updating infor
mation."
By challenging the assumption that a
person's race is definitive, Saperstein sheds
a different light on the problem of discrim
ination.
"Most of the evils of racism and discrim
ination [exist] precisely because we think
it's easy to define it and therefore attach be
havior to those people," she said. "If it's less
easy to define, in some ways that may actu
ally make it better."
By viewing race as a gradient rather
than separating different races into distinct
categories, Saperstein and her colleagues
found a basis for studying how people's
perception of race can be skewed by cer
tain factors, in this case, clothing. She hopes
that this new understanding of race will
make it more difficult for racial stereotypes
and boundaries to exist in society, even in
that of her daily life as a Stanford professor.
When asked for a photo to accompany
this article, Saperstein asked, "Should I be
wearing a suit or janitorial clothing?"
Does it matter? Her research suggests
that it might.
