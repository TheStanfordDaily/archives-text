## Alums' borderless book community 
### AMRITARAO 
Despite its reputa
tion as a tech-ori
ented campus
filled with stu
dents who would
rather program computers
than study the arts, Stanford
has found ways to incorporate
the humanities into its wider vi
sion of a well-rounded educa
tion. From the Three Books
program to required courses in
the Introduction to the Hu
manities and the Program in
Writing and Rhetoric, litera
ture is integral to the under
graduate experience. And for
some, participation in the hu
manities at Stanford doesn't
have to end after graduation.
The Stanford Book Salon is
an online community com
posed of alumni, families and
other Stanford community
members who come together
to read and discuss a different
book each month.
The Salon began in 2002
under the direction of the late
Diane Middlebrook, a poet
and former feminist studies
professor at Stanford. In the
program's early days, she host
ed every forum herself. But
with its rapid growth in popu
larity, the program soon ex
panded to bring in faculty hosts
to choose books that are close
to their hearts.
The current Salon runs
seven months per year, hosting
discussions in an online forum
about that month's literature
of choice. The book is an
nounced on the first day of
each month, accompanied by
an audio interview with the
host, typically a Stanford pro

fessor, who introduces the
book and highlights key
themes and passages.
The online discussion starts
with responses to this interview
and journeys through sets of
questions posed by the faculty
host at intervals throughout
the month. Occasionally, the
Salon also organizes a live
event, such as the on-campus

discussion session held recent
ly with medicine professor
Abraham Verghese, Septem
ber's host for his own novel,
"Cutting For Stone."
"We're trying to give [alum
ni] that classroom experience
they had back at Stanford,"
said May-Ling Gonzales, sen
ior manager of alumni educa
tion and coordinator for the
Book Salon.
Stanford alums have been
highly receptive to the pro
gram, and the Salon has grown
to include over 4,000 sub
scribers, 1,300 of whom have
contributed to the daily discus

sion posts. Still, the Salon al
lows for varying levels of com
mitment for those alumni
whose other obligations pre
vent them from fully engaging
with the group. Some members
participate actively in discus
sions, others just glance over
the monthly updates and a few
even use the recommendations
for future reading lists.

"Wherever, however they
want to participate, we'll meet
them there," Gonzales said.
According to Gonzales, the
Salon's strength lies in its abili
ty to bridge the gap between
alumni and current faculty by
allowing them to continue the
intellectual experience of read
ing together in a space that pro
motes inquiry.
"If you can't [meet] in per
son, then doing it online can be
just as good," said assistant pro
fessor of French and Italian
Marisa Galvez Ph.D. 'O7, who
