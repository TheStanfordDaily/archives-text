## EDITORIAL Frederick Terman and his legacy 
### 
As the demolition crews
begin their work on the
Frederick Emmons Ter
man Engineering Center, the for
mer home of the School of Engi
neering, we should take a moment
to reflect on the efforts of the for
mer Provost to create much of
what we appreciate about Stanford
today.

depths of the Cold War. This invest
ment in "techie" academics built on
an already strong foundation to
give Stanford its present legacy of
well-rounded academic expertise.

The demolition of Terman is in
many ways an indication of the
tremendous success this set of ac
tions had. The buildings of the new
Science and Engineering Quad
bear the names of founders of Sili
con Valley giants like Nvidia and
Yahoo!. While these firms offer
products and services that Freder
ick Terman could only have
dreamed of, their presence, innova
tion and involvement with Stan
ford are clearly in line with what he
envisioned for the area.

Frederick Emmons Terman was
an electrical engineering professor
who, in the 1920s and 19305, men
tored many students, including
David Packard and William
Hewlett. In encouraging them and
his other students to commercial
ize what they had developed, he set
an important precedent. Specifical
ly, he saw the need for research to
expand beyond the lab and reach
the boardrooms, factories and
homes of this country. The creation
of companies like Hewlett-
Packard spread new technologies
and products and spurred further
advances.

Looking at the next 50 years, we
must ask what new visionary ap
proaches Stanford will adopt. The
New York satellite campus could
become an example of this, taking
some of Terman's tried recipe for
success to the Big Apple. The re
cent expansion of the Graduate
School of Business, including an
unprecedented $l5O million to es
tablish an institute to support inno
vations to serve developing coun
tries, may be another. A third ex
ample may well be in the area of
sustainability and environmental
science as witnessed by the cre
ation of a park on the site of Ter
man and the salvaging or recycling
of 99 percent of the building's ma
terials. Whatever the case, there is
no doubt that in order to live up to
Terman's tremendous legacy, we
must keep Stanford at the cutting
edge and continue to ensure that
the school remains a magnet and
incubator for a strong variety of tal
ent and creativity.

In the 19505, as Dean of Engi
neering and later Provost, Terman
worked with William Shockley to
expand upon this idea by establish
ing what is now Stanford Research
Park.Tempting technology firms to
what was then the largely undevel
oped South Bay unleashed innova
tion in what became known as "Sil
icon Valley" as the firms took ad
vantage of proximity to one anoth
er and to Stanford's pool of talent.
This was only one side of the equa
tion, however. Terman also over
saw an expansion of Stanford's sci
ence, math and engineering de
partments in order to better take
advantage of these firms' presence
as well as to win grants from the
Department of Defense during the
