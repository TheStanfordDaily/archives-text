# FRESHMAN '15
## Your dorm is where the heart is 
### Bianca Chavez 
I'm adding "dorm living" to the long
list of things I pink-puffy-heart love
(it'll go right under glitter, reality
television and baking).
For one, it's never boring. Ever.
Even at 2 a.m. on a Wednesday, you'll
find people rolling summersaults
down the hallways. It's like having a
giant sleepover every night of the
week complete with pillow fights,
giggling and plenty of junk food.
(Holla, freshman '15!)
Living in a dorm is like instantly
becoming part of a network more
supportive than Victoria Secret's
Bio Fit bra. Whether you're looking
for someone to edit your IHUM
paper (1,900 words on John Locke?
Ew, gross.) or just an amigo to watch
"Boy Meets World" with (I see you,
Cory Matthews!), it's always super
easy to find a buddy just walk
down the hall and look for the first
open door.

But what's the real difference be
tween your dormmates and all your
other friends? They see you when
your life isn't a bucket of rainbows
and unicorns and '9os sitcoms. When
the midterm you studied so hard for
turns out to be a complete Fail Mary
and you're ready to fling yourself off
Hoover Tower, they're the ones who
talk you off the ledge. When you're
clinging to your recycle bin after
eight consecutive shots of Smirnoff
Watermelon, they're standing right
behind you holding your hair. And
the next morning, they'll happily re

mind you of all the ridiculous things
you said/did. (Remember that time
you tried to do the "Coyote Ugly"
bar dance on the tables at Kappa
Alpha? Or that time you hooked up
with a guy who you thought looked
like Brad Pitt but actually resembled
Regis Philbin? They do.)
But living in such a supportive
community isn't always like eating a
cake full of puppies and smiles; it also
comes with responsibilities. It's about
taking care of each other even
when it's inconvenient, annoying
and/or disgusting. When you're stum
bling down the Row and you see one
of your hallmates slumped over in a
bush, you are ethically obligated to
make sure they aren't, you know, in
mortal peril.
When your neighbor walks into
your room at 7 p.m., pukes violently
into your recycling bin, flops down on
your bed and starts drinking your
Diet Coke, you may momentarily
feel like throwing his drunken ass
back into the hallway, but you know
deep inside that you never could. In
stead, you stop working on your
PoliSci paper (no big deal, you still
have like five hours left to write the
entire thing), and sit with him for the
next two hours as he blathers
incoherently, drinks soda, curses at
strangers passing by and sings Disney
songs. Even though you have every
right to be really fucking annoyed at
the kid, you're not because you
two share a special bond as

dormmates.
And at the end of the day, loving
people when they're at their least
loveable moments is part of what it
means to be part of a community.
Even when they're being argumenta
tive, unruly or just plain obnoxious.
Even when they're passed out in a
rosebush. Even when you're covered
in their puke.

Know a good way to rid a room of
that dreaded vomit smell? For the
love of God, please email Bianca at
blchavez@stanford.edu. (But really,
it's becoming slightly unbearable.)

Its always super
easy to find abuddy
—just walk down
the hall.
