# I Do CHOOSE TO RUN
## Protest and paradox 
### Miles Unterreiner 
The fact that I'm still writing
about the Occupy movement
and more importantly, that
you're still taking the time to read
another column about it would
seem to indicate some level of cam
pus support for the populist up
welling that has captured headlines
around the globe. But you'd never
know it based on the rather lacklus
ter showing of Occupy Stanford, the
movement's arm on the Farm. In
fact, were you to visit White Plaza
during one of OS's poorly attended
sit-ins, walk-outs or stand-ups, you
might not even realize Occupy Stan
ford existed at all.

Occupy Stanford's lukewarm re
ception on campus is not a micro
cosm of the movement's larger
faults and foibles or a harbinger of
the imminent implosion of the liber
al project. But it does illuminate
and powerfully so the maze of
contradictions, paradoxes, schisms
and hidden undercurrents that lies
unseen at the heart of Stanford life.
Paradox number one: Stanford
students are, almost by definition,
those for whom The System has
worked beautifully, even as we are
constantly told to work against it.
Fight The Man, we hear we who
got here by doing precisely the op
posite, and doing it well.
Gone for good are the '7os. Here
to stay are David Brooks' Organiza
tion Kids: hardworking, optimistic,
lovers of order and progress, believ
ers in the system that got us where
we are and that promises to get us
where we hope to go. One of Stan
ford's representatives at Occupy
Palo Alto said it best: "Honestly, I
should probably be studying." We
rage against the machine, even as its
cogs are being forged, its gears oiled,
its nuts and bolts tightened in class
rooms and lecture halls all around
us. We vociferously deny the morali
ty of hoop-jumping, and then, as one
of the greatest professors at this
school has astutely pointed out,
excel at jumping right through them.
We can see this wrenching cogni
tive dissonance at the soul of the Oc-

cupy Stanford movement itself.
Consider the widely advertised
General Assembly of last Wednes
day. A few students showed up duti
fully at a prescribed time â€”ll a.m.,
to be exact and calmly discussed
the Occupy movement before filing
respectfully away at 2. It was so
though uninten
tionally, Stanford: protest within or
dered boundaries, moral outrage
within reason, furiously working
against the system by working po
litely within a system more week
eight IHUM lecture than Zuccotti
Park, and similarly attended. No
weeklong sit-ins here: there are
problem sets to be done, after all.
Paradox number two is the para
dox of class. Despite all signs and
posters to the contrary, we are not, in
fact, the 99 percent. We are the 1 per
cent. We are a school largely
(though thankfully not entirely)
composed of the sons of lawyers and
doctors, the daughters of engineers
and executives, the scions of success
and the progeny of privilege,
Neiman Marxists trying desperately
to identify with the proletariat. As
Yale professor William Deresiewicz

put it in "The Disadvantages of an
Elite Education," too many Stan
ford students have been put in the
"paradoxical position of wanting to
advocate on behalf of the working
class while being unable to hold a
simple conversation with anyone in
it."
We are therefore torn, both so
cially and spatially; our geography
mirrors our collective psychology.
Campus sits conveniently near both
East Palo Alto and Facebook head
quarters. On University Avenue,
Maseratis idle, rumbling, next to the
homeless. The Haas Center's not far
from the Business School. We are a
student body and faculty with an
anti-capitalist ethos situated at the
geographical heart of entrepreneur
ial capitalism, sitting in a university
built by a railroad baron and sus
tained by donations from the rich.

Our advisers tell us to think out
side the box; our exams command us
to fill in the box. Our student gov
ernment trumpets entrepreneurial
ism; half of us love it, and half of us
hate it.

We take life seriously too seri
ously, sometimes but we can also
be spectacularly, gloriously, deeply
irreverent. We halfheartedly "like"
Occupy Stanford on Facebook be
fore gleefully sharing the "I am the 2
percent" milk photo and promptly
forgetting all about it or scheming to
hold an "Occupy Lag" protest to de
mand that the cinnamon rolls be
brought back for weekend brunch
(I'm in if you are).

So who should we blame, or
praise, for the failure of Occupy
Stanford? To quote a great man as 1
write this November the sth: "Truth
be told, if you're looking for the
guilty, you need only look into a mir
ror."

If I may ask what an equally
great man once called a very per
sonal question: what do you see in
that mirror?

No week-long
sit-ins here:
there are
problem sets to be
done, after all.
