## Ugly win sets up epic showdown 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
Despite another poor first
half, Stanford cruised to
another road win, beat
ing Oregon State 38-13.
Here's Stat on the
Back's take on the final regular-sea
son road game of the season.
Number of the game: 9-0

What it means: The Cardinal did
n't win any football beauty pageants
on Saturday, but after nine games,
Stanford is still undefeated. And that's
all that matters.

Why it matters: Stanford had noth
ing to gain and everything to lose on
Saturday, and the team showed it for
the first 40 minutes of the game. At the
end of the day, though, the Cardinal
got things together in the final third of
the game for an easy victory over an
outmatched team.

Every game is important and no
opponent can be taken lightly, but the
truth is that Stanford just needed to
get through this week without an epic
collapse in order to remain undefeat
ed with Oregon coming to town. And
that's just what the Cardinal did.
Other notable numbers:

81: Besides staying undefeated, the
biggest story of the game was yet an
other scary head injury for Chris
Owusu. Seeing No. 81 crumpled on
the ground with trainers around him
seems to be a weekly occurrence
these days, and Saturday's injury may
have been the worst of them all.
Owusu appeared to be completely
unconscious as he lay motionless for
quite some time. Whenever an ambu
lance needs to be brought on the field,
you know things are serious (unless
you are an Oregon State fan, of
course, but we'll get to that momen
tarily).
Luckily, Owusu was able to give a
thumbs-up while being loaded into
the ambulance, and he was able to join
his team after the game in the locker
room with full use of his extremities.
Head coach David Shaw said Owusu
will be all right and that the team will
be cautious with him, but with three
concussions in the last 13 months and
numerous other tough hits in that
same time span, Owusu likely will
miss another chunk of time. With this
being his senior year and with the na
ture of concussions being so delicate, it
is possible that we've seen the last of
Chris Owusu on a football field. How
ever, recovery from concussions is ex
tremely unpredictable, so his future
remains to be seen.

Seeing Owusu down made me
(and any viewer with an ounce of em
pathy) sad, but seeing the response of
Oregon State fans made me mad. It
was homecoming weekend, and the
fans were fired up to play a top-five
team, but that doesn't excuse the loud
chorus of boos raining down on Reser
Stadium while Owusu lay motionless.
I know the fans were disputing the
penalty call, but the fact is that if a
player is as seriously injured as Owusu
appeared to be, you throw away all
thoughts of penalties for a few min
utes until you are sure he is all right.
That's Fandom 101.

Instead, according to Chase
Thomas, the fans were doing more
than just booing. "The fans were kind
of rude about it and making fun of
him," Thomas said. "That lit a fire.
They were yelling things that should
n't be said when someone is hurt on
the ground like that. We took it per
sonally."
There's no place for that kind of
behavior, and I can only hope the ma
jority of Beaver fans acted with more
class.

1: Saying "Stanford has three of the
best tight ends in the country on the
field, all at the same time!" has a nice
ring to it. Saying "Stanford has three
of the best tight ends in the country,
and only one can play!" is a little less
satisfying. With Zach Ertz sidelined
due to a knee injury, it appeared to be
time for just the Dos Amigos of Coby
Fleener and LevineToilolo. However,
on Stanford's first scoring play of the
game,Toilolo took a knock to his head
and had to miss the rest of the game.
Without him, Stanford was forced to
use its fullbacks more to cope with
having just one deadly tight end on the
field, flie bad news is that Ertz is ex
pected to miss at least one more game,
but on the bright side.Toilolo did not
get a concussion and is expected to
play on Saturday.
0: Speaking of the first scoring play
of the game, it came in the second
quarter. This was the first time in 28

games that Stanford was held score
less in the first quarter. The last team
that stopped the Cardinal from scor
ing in the first frame? Oregon State, of
course, in Stanford's last trip to Cor
vallis two years ago.
300: For the second time in three
weeks, the Stanford running game ex
ploded with 300 rushing yards. Yes, it
was against a bad team. But there
aren't many teams in the nation that
can put up 300, whether or not they
have a great quarterback. That's just
what makes Stanford so dangerous:
one week after Luck threw for 330,
the Cardinal ran for 300.
48: Stanford racked up those 300
rushing yards on 48 carries. To put this
into perspective, Oregon State ran
just 47 offensive plays and gained just
285 total yards. Who needs a passing
game?
76: Cardinal fans would have liked
to see that passing game in the first
half, when Luck threw for just 76
yards. He completed just 11 of 19
passes and threw one of the worst in
terceptions he's thrown in his three
years at Stanford. The passing game

was completely out of sync, which is
why the run game was so crucial. In
the second half, Luck turned it on,
completing nine of his 11 attempts for
130 yards, two touchdowns and no in
terceptions.

4: Despite Alabama's home loss to
LSU, the Crimson Tide remained
ahead of Stanford in the latest BCS
standings, keeping the Cardinal at No.
4. Before you go burning down the
BCS headquarters (hint: there's no
such place), fear not. Stanford is in the
same position as last week. If the Car
dinal finishes undefeated and Okla
homa State loses, Stanford will vault
over Alabama into the all-important
No. 2 spot.
17: An ugly win, yes, but the victo
ry over Oregon State was the Cardi
nal's 17th straight. Next up: the
biggest test of all, the Oregon Ducks.
