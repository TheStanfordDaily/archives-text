# STILL UNBEATEN

It wasn't pretty. It wasn't easy.
And it sure wasn't perfect. But
thanks to an effective second half
that allowed the team to pull away
from Oregon State, the Cardinal
kept its record unblemished and its
national title hopes intact with a 38-
13 win.

The No. 4 Cardinal (9-0,7-0 Pac
-12) came out flat on a cold, rainy day
in Corvallis, Ore., struggling to find
its offensive rhythm in the first half
before eventually pulling away
from the Beavers (2-7, 2-4) in the
third quarter.
At the end of the day, redshirt

junior quarterback Andrew Luck
passed for another three touch
downs, and the Cardinal ended up
with 507 total yards of offense
300 of them on the ground but
some offensive struggles left the
Beavers still within shouting dis
tance early in the second half.
Luck and the offense sputtered
on their first two drives in the first
quarter, with Luck tossing a sloppy
interception on the second drive.
But the Beavers failed to capitalize
on Luck's early struggles with two
failed drives of their own, and the
sluggish start led to a 0-0 tie after the
first quarter, the only time this year
the Cardinal has failed to score in
the first quarter.

Things began to heat up offen
sively — and emotionally —in the
second quarter, as senior running
back Jeremy Ste wart plunged into the
end zone on the first play of the quar
ter to give the Cardinal a 7-0 lead.
After a three-and-out by the
Beavers, Luck and company convert
ed four third downs on the next series
before a 17-yard fade to the end zone
fell right into the hands of senior
wideout Griff Whalen to make the
score 14-0 in Stanford's favor.

After Oregon State scored on its
next drive to make it 14-7, Luck
flipped a pass out to senior receiver
Chris Owusu, who took a direct hel
met-to-helmet hit from cornerback
Jordan Poyer, collapsing Owusu to
the ground in a heap.
The concussion-inducing hit
would lead to Owusu being carted
off the field in an ambulance the
third time this season the senior has
taken a brutal shot to his hea, but
the first that he was unable to walk
off under his own power. Owusu
was taken to the hospital but main
tained a full range of motion and
was able to return home with the

Redshirt senior defensive end Matt Masifilo (No. 98) and sophomore safety Devon Carrington (No. 5) helped the Stanford defense hold Oregon State
to just 285 total yards in the Cardinal's 38-13 win. Meanwhile, the offense struggled in the first half before pulling away with the game's final 21 points.
