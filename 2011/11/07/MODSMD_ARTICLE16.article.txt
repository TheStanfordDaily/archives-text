# STILL UNBEATEN

### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
It wasn't pretty. It wasn't easy.
And it sure wasn't perfect. But
thanks to an effective second half
that allowed the team to pull away
from Oregon State, the Cardinal
kept its record unblemished and its
national title hopes intact with a 38-
13 win.

The No. 4 Cardinal (9-0,7-0 Pac
-12) came out flat on a cold, rainy day
in Corvallis, Ore., struggling to find
its offensive rhythm in the first half
before eventually pulling away
from the Beavers (2-7, 2-4) in the
third quarter.
At the end of the day, redshirt

junior quarterback Andrew Luck
passed for another three touch
downs, and the Cardinal ended up
with 507 total yards of offense
300 of them on the ground but
some offensive struggles left the
Beavers still within shouting dis
tance early in the second half.
Luck and the offense sputtered
on their first two drives in the first
quarter, with Luck tossing a sloppy
interception on the second drive.
But the Beavers failed to capitalize
on Luck's early struggles with two
failed drives of their own, and the
sluggish start led to a 0-0 tie after the
first quarter, the only time this year
the Cardinal has failed to score in
the first quarter.

Things began to heat up offen
sively — and emotionally —in the
second quarter, as senior running
back Jeremy Ste wart plunged into the
end zone on the first play of the quar
ter to give the Cardinal a 7-0 lead.
After a three-and-out by the
Beavers, Luck and company convert
ed four third downs on the next series
before a 17-yard fade to the end zone
fell right into the hands of senior
wideout Griff Whalen to make the
score 14-0 in Stanford's favor.

After Oregon State scored on its
next drive to make it 14-7, Luck
flipped a pass out to senior receiver
Chris Owusu, who took a direct hel
met-to-helmet hit from cornerback
Jordan Poyer, collapsing Owusu to
the ground in a heap.
The concussion-inducing hit
would lead to Owusu being carted
off the field in an ambulance the
third time this season the senior has
taken a brutal shot to his hea, but
the first that he was unable to walk
off under his own power. Owusu
was taken to the hospital but main
tained a full range of motion and
was able to return home with the

STANFORD 38
OREGON STATE 13

SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt senior defensive end Matt Masifilo (No. 98) and sophomore safety Devon Carrington (No. 5) helped the Stanford defense hold Oregon State
to just 285 total yards in the Cardinal's 38-13 win. Meanwhile, the offense struggled in the first half before pulling away with the game's final 21 points.
team later.
The Cardinal was able to shake
off the scary moment and drive
down for a field goal to make the
score 17-7 at half, but the Beavers
came out of the locker room firing,
engineering a quick scoring drive
that made it 17-13 and set the Cardi
nal on upset alert for the second
time in as many weeks.
After trading punts, the Stan
ford offense finally found its
groove, scoring on its next two
possessions with a pair of Luck
touchdown passes to junior run
ning back Stepfan Taylor and red
shirt senior tight end Coby Fleen
er. At 31-13, Stanford had finally
squashed the Beavers' upset at
tempt, and junior running back
Tyler Gaffney added another
touchdown midway through the
fourth quarter to round out the
final margin of victory.
At the end of the day, Heisman
frontrunner Luck would finish the
day 20-for-30 through the air, toss
ing three touchdowns against one
interception to give him 71 career
passing touchdowns, just one be
hind Steve Stenstrom for second
all-time in Stanford history and six
behind John Elway's record 77
touchdown passes.

Luck's continued excellence
didn't overshadow a strong defen
sive effort, though, as the Cardinal
defenders blocked both a field goal
and an extra point, sacked quarter
back Sean Mannion three times
and held the Beavers to less than

300 yards of total offense.
Even though the victory was
somewhat unspectacular, the win
might have come at a very high
price for the Cardinal, as the loss of
Owusu was coupled with an injury
to redshirt freshman tight end
Levine Toilolo, who did not return
to action after suffering a blow to
the head in the second quarter.
Altogether, it means that the list
of injured players continues to
grow ever larger for the Cardinal,
which was already missing starters
at five positions before the contest
with the Beavers.
Stanford will now have a week
to get healthy and prepared for its
colossal showdown this weekend
against the No. 7 Oregon Ducks.
After suffering an early loss to No.
1 LSU, the Ducks have reeled off
eight straight wins and set the stage
for Saturday's contest to decide the
de facto Pac-12 champion.

In a contest that has been antic
ipated since the schedule was re
leased this spring, the Ducks will
bring the nation's fifth-best offense
into Palo Alto hoping to upset the
Cardinal and once again derail Stan
ford's national-title hopes. In 2010,
the Ducks were the only team to
knock off the Cardinal with a 52-31
win in Eugene. Since that time,
though, Stanford has held onto the
nation's longest win streak, which it
extended to 17 games with the win
over the Beavers.
The Cardinal returns to action
this Saturday at home, welcoming
ESPN's College Game Day and the
Oregon Ducks to town for a top-10
clash. Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m.
