# SENIORS COME UP BIG
## UNDEFEATED ONCE AGAIN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Closing out a near-perfect sea
son on Saturday, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's soccer team added
another piece of history to its
repertoire by becoming just the
second school to ever go unde
feated in the regular season three
years in a row.

Following the lead of North
Carolina, which accomplished the
feat twice between 1986 and 1993,
the Cardinal (19-0-1, 11-0-0 Pac
-12) knocked off No. 23 California
2-0 on Senior Night and undoubt
edly secured yet another No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament.
The outgoing seniors have en
tered the tourney with a top seed
each of their four years on the

Farm.
In the driving rain, Stanford
would get strong contributions
from all four seniors, three of
whom made it onto the score
sheet.
"It was great," said senior mid
fielder Kristy Zurmuhlen. "I
mean, just playing against Cal and
just being a part of this team has
just been so amazing all four
years, and I really think the team
this year is really special. I could
n't have asked for a better night.
Regardless of the rain, it was awe
