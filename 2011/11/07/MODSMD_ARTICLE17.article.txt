# SENIORS COME UP BIG
## UNDEFEATED ONCE AGAIN 
### JOSEPH BEYDA DESK EDITOR 
Closing out a near-perfect sea
son on Saturday, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's soccer team added
another piece of history to its
repertoire by becoming just the
second school to ever go unde
feated in the regular season three
years in a row.

Following the lead of North
Carolina, which accomplished the
feat twice between 1986 and 1993,
the Cardinal (19-0-1, 11-0-0 Pac
-12) knocked off No. 23 California
2-0 on Senior Night and undoubt
edly secured yet another No. 1
seed in the NCAA Tournament.
The outgoing seniors have en
tered the tourney with a top seed
each of their four years on the

Farm.
In the driving rain, Stanford
would get strong contributions
from all four seniors, three of
whom made it onto the score
sheet.
"It was great," said senior mid
fielder Kristy Zurmuhlen. "I
mean, just playing against Cal and
just being a part of this team has
just been so amazing all four
years, and I really think the team
this year is really special. I could
n't have asked for a better night.
Regardless of the rain, it was awe

Senior midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen scored the final goal in the No. 1 Stanford women's soccer team's third-consecutive
undefeated regularseason. The Cardinal capped its year with a 2-0 win over Cal on Senior Night.
some."
Stanford took a while to settle in
against Cal (12-6-2,5-4-2) in a phys
ical, slippery game, but the Cardinal
players weren't going to let the rain
get to them.
"I think that we've taught our
selves that no matter what the con
ditions, we're just going to go out
and play our hardest, and we try to
look at the upside of things," Zur
muhlen said. "I don't think it affects
us at all. If anything, we plan cele
brations and things around it."
Stanford would be doing quite a
bit of celebrating in the 20th
minute. Drawing a free kick from
30 yards out when she tripped over
a Golden Bear defender, senior for
ward Lindsay Taylor drilled a see
ing-eye shot off the crossbar,
straight down and in to put the Car
dinal ahead at 19:19. It was a career
best 17th goal of the season for Tay
lor, the reigning Soccer America
National Player of the Week and
the Pac-12's leading scorer.
Just 40 seconds later, senior de
fender Camille Levin found Zur
muhlen at the low left side of the
box, and the midfielder put it home
to extend Stanford's lead.
The Cardinal took control of the
action, and several speedy plays by
freshman forward Chioma Übo
gagu fell just short of great scoring
chances. A shot by Cal freshman
midfielder Taylor Comeau just
missed off the crossbar early in the
second half, and neither team
would come very close to scoring
again. The tallies by Taylor and Zur
muhlen would be enough for Stan
ford in a 2-0 win.
"I'm so happy to see two of the
seniors score goals, and Cami and
[senior midfielder Teresa] Noyola
were fantastic too, so it was great to
see all four seniors have a fantastic
game in their last game," said head

coach Paul Ratcliffe.
It was hardly the only fantastic
game that the seniors have played
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, where
the quartet has never lost a match.
And it wasn't a completely domi
nant performance either, but rather
a back-and-forth, gutsy battle
against a determined Cal team.
In other words, it was a fitting
end to a season that saw the Cardi
nal lose standout junior Courtney
Verloo to injury, fail to score in an
early-season draw against a strong
Maryland squad and squeak by the
Washington schools in a trying mid
season road trip but persevere,
nonetheless.

"Record-wise, we probably
couldn't have done too much bet
ter," Zurmuhlen said, "but we're all
kind of perfectionists, and we all
know we have things to work on. So
going into the playoffs, we definite
ly want to nitpick and try to fix
those things. We're excited, and
we're ready to go."

The NCAA Tournament selec
tion show airs at 1:30 p.m. today,
and the Cardinal will likely host the
first round of postseason play on
Friday. Then the Stanford women
will have to put their noses to the
grindstone yet again as they hope to
reach the goal that has barely elud
ed them for two years running: a
College Cup title.

Stanford took a while to settle in
against Cal (12-6-2,5-4-2) in a phys
ical, slippery game, but the Cardinal
players weren't going to let the rain
get to them.
"I think that we've taught our
selves that no matter what the con
ditions, we're just going to go out
and play our hardest, and we try to
look at the upside of things," Zur
muhlen said. "I don't think it affects
us at all. If anything, we plan cele
brations and things around it."
Stanford would be doing quite a
bit of celebrating in the 20th
minute. Drawing a free kick from
30 yards out when she tripped over
a Golden Bear defender, senior for
ward Lindsay Taylor drilled a see
ing-eye shot off the crossbar,
straight down and in to put the Car
dinal ahead at 19:19. It was a career
best 17th goal of the season for Tay
lor, the reigning Soccer America
National Player of the Week and
the Pac-12's leading scorer.
Just 40 seconds later, senior de
fender Camille Levin found Zur
muhlen at the low left side of the
box, and the midfielder put it home
to extend Stanford's lead.
The Cardinal took control of the
action, and several speedy plays by
freshman forward Chioma Übo
gagu fell just short of great scoring
chances. A shot by Cal freshman
midfielder Taylor Comeau just
missed off the crossbar early in the
second half, and neither team
would come very close to scoring
again. The tallies by Taylor and Zur
muhlen would be enough for Stan
ford in a 2-0 win.
"I'm so happy to see two of the
seniors score goals, and Cami and
[senior midfielder Teresa] Noyola
were fantastic too, so it was great to
see all four seniors have a fantastic
game in their last game," said head

coach Paul Ratcliffe.
It was hardly the only fantastic
game that the seniors have played
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, where
the quartet has never lost a match.
And it wasn't a completely domi
nant performance either, but rather
a back-and-forth, gutsy battle
against a determined Cal team.
In other words, it was a fitting
end to a season that saw the Cardi
nal lose standout junior Courtney
Verloo to injury, fail to score in an
early-season draw against a strong
Maryland squad and squeak by the
Washington schools in a trying mid
season road trip but persevere,
nonetheless.

"Record-wise, we probably
couldn't have done too much bet
ter," Zurmuhlen said, "but we're all
kind of perfectionists, and we all
know we have things to work on. So
going into the playoffs, we definite
ly want to nitpick and try to fix
those things. We're excited, and
we're ready to go."

The NCAA Tournament selec
tion show airs at 1:30 p.m. today,
and the Cardinal will likely host the
first round of postseason play on
Friday. Then the Stanford women
will have to put their noses to the
grindstone yet again as they hope to
reach the goal that has barely elud
ed them for two years running: a
College Cup title.
