## Cal upsets Stanford in NorPac final 
### JORDAN GUNNING 
The No. 6 Stanford field hockey
team can no longer lay claim to the
NorPac title after this weekend's
disappointing loss to its cross-bay
rival, No. 16 California (16-3, 4-2
NorPac), in the NorPac Tourna
ment final.
As the four-time defending
champ of the NorPac Tournament,
the Cardinal (17-3,6-0) was expect
ed to sweep this weekend and win
the NCAA Play-In game slot, but
things did not go as planned.

The weekend started off well
enough as the Card easily defeated
Appalachian State (2-18, 1-5) on
Thursday with a 7-0 win.
The match was characterized by
total Cardinal domination. The
Card only allowed five Moun
taineer shots the entire match com
pared to 30 of its own, and managed
to gain 12 penalty corners while
granting the Mountaineers just
four.

The seven goals of the game
came from five different Cardinal
players: redshirt sophomore de
fender Colleen Ryan, redshirt jun
ior attacker Katie Mitchell, junior
defender Becky Dru, redshirt soph
omore attacker Emily Henriksson
and redshirt junior attacker Devon
Holman, who earned a hat trick.

With the textbook win on Thurs
day, the Cardinal headed into Fri
day's match against Davidson (8-7-
3,3-2-2) with an expectation to win
the semifinal. Though the team per
formed well, winning 6-2, Friday's
game showed some signs that the
Card's command of the NorPac

FIELD HOCKEY
CALIFORNIA 1
STANFORD 0
11/5, Varsity Turf
Tournament was slipping.
In the first minute of play,
Davidson's Christine Rua scored to
put the Wildcats up 1-0. Not since
the Card's 6-3 loss to New Hamp
shire on Oct. 9 had the Cardinal al
lowed its opponent to score first. It
was just the fourth time this season
that this occurred.
The Cardinal then answered
with a goal by Dru and assists from
sophomore attacker Hope Burke
and senior attacker Stephanie
Byrne. The goal was scored off one
of the Card's eight penalty corners
for the day.
The Card scored again in the
13th minute with an unassisted goal
from Henriksson. But then Rua an
swered with her second goal of the
match scored off a penalty corner.

In the minutes that followed, the
Cardinal appeared to struggle as it
failed to capitalize on Davidson's

sloppy play in the circle that result
ed in four penalty corners in four
minutes.

As the first half closed out, the
Card was able to correct its mis
takes and score three goals, one by
freshman attacker Alex McCawley
and two by Byrne, with assists from
McCawley and sophomore attack
er Courtney Haldeman.
In the second half, McCawley
scored twice more, assisted by Hol
man and Haldeman, but the Cardi
nal was unable to score off its last
eight shots. This inability to score on
set-pieces and sloppy shooting
would follow the Cardinal into the
final.

On Saturday the Cardinal head
ed into the final against its rival,
Cal. Again, Stanford was expected
to win, as it had already beaten the
Golden Bears twice in the regular
season and had home-field advan
tage. But those factors just weren't
enough for the Cardinal.
The only goal scored during the
match was in the fifth minute by
Cal's Erin Magill off a penalty cor
ner.

The rest of the game was a disap
pointing show for both teams on of
fense. During the match, three
green cards and two yellow cards
were handed out, with Cal receiving
the two yellows and two of the
greens.

The Card's play really broke
down as it just couldn't convert any
scoring opportunities into goals. In
the 67th minute, redshirt senior
goalkeeper Ale Moss was pulled in
order to attempt a final offensive
push, but nothing resulted from this
strategic change-up.
In the opposing goal, Cal keeper
Maddie Hand had an impressive
day, racking up nine saves in the
win.

With the loss to Cal, the fate of
the Cardinal's postseason is up in
the air. Stanford is now vying for an
at-large spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment and will learn its postseason
fate when the NCAA selection
committee makes its final picks
Tuesday night.

Golden Bears twice in the regular
season and had home-field advan
tage. But those factors just weren't
enough for the Cardinal.
The only goal scored during the
match was in the fifth minute by
Cal's Erin Magill off a penalty cor
ner.

The rest of the game was a disap
pointing show for both teams on of
fense. During the match, three
green cards and two yellow cards
were handed out, with Cal receiving
the two yellows and two of the
greens.

The Card's play really broke
down as it just couldn't convert any
scoring opportunities into goals. In
the 67th minute, redshirt senior
goalkeeper Ale Moss was pulled in
order to attempt a final offensive
push, but nothing resulted from this
strategic change-up.
In the opposing goal, Cal keeper
Maddie Hand had an impressive
day, racking up nine saves in the
win.

With the loss to Cal, the fate of
the Cardinal's postseason is up in
the air. Stanford is now vying for an
at-large spot in the NCAA Tourna
ment and will learn its postseason
fate when the NCAA selection
committee makes its final picks
Tuesday night.

Redshirt junior attacker Katie Mitchell scored in the No. 6 Stanford field hockey team's NorPac Tournament rout of
Appalachian State on Thursday. The Cardinal fell to Cal in the final, though, and must now await its NCAA fate.
