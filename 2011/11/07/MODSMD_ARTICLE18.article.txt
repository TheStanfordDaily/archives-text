## Cal upsets Stanford in NorPac final 
### JORDAN GUNNING 
The No. 6 Stanford field hockey
team can no longer lay claim to the
NorPac title after this weekend's
disappointing loss to its cross-bay
rival, No. 16 California (16-3, 4-2
NorPac), in the NorPac Tourna

Appalachian State (2-18, 1-5) on
Thursday with a 7-0 win.

pared to 30 of its own, and managed
to gain 12 penalty corners while
granting the Mountaineers just
four.

came from five different Cardinal
players: redshirt sophomore de
fender Colleen Ryan, redshirt jun

defender Becky Dru, redshirt soph
omore attacker Emily Henriksson
and redshirt junior attacker Devon
Holman, who earned a hat trick.

With the textbook win on Thurs
day, the Cardinal headed into Fri
day's match against Davidson (8-7-
3,3-2-2) with an expectation to win
the semifinal. Though the team per

game showed some signs that the
