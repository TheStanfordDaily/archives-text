## Stanford basketball sweeps weekend exhibitions 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
The Stanford men's and women's basketball teams
rolled to big exhibition victories over the weekend at
Maples Pavilion, with sophomore forward Dwight Powell
scoring 16 points to lead the men's team to a 100-47 victory
over Ryerson and freshman forward Bonnie Samuelson
scoring 17 as the women's team rolled to a 100-54 win over
Vanguard.
Powell led four players in double figures on the men's
side, and there were plenty of encouraging signs a year after
the Cardinal finished eighth in the Pac-10 with a 15-16 over
all record.
Redshirt freshman center Stefan Nastic scored 11 points
in 10 minutes off the bench, a good sign after he missed the
majority of last season with a foot injury. Redshirt senior
Josh Owens looked good early, scoring 10 points and grab
bing eight rebounds in 23 minutes of play.
Stanford was all over the Rams from the opening tip-off,
running out to a 25-8 lead after 10 minutes and substituting
liberally throughout. Cardinal fans got their first look at
freshman guard Chasson Randle, one of the top recruits in
the country and the only scholarship player in this year's re
cruiting class.
Randle who started alongside sophomore guard
Aaron Bright, senior forward Andrew Zimmermann, Pow
ell and Owens finished with seven points and three as
sists in his college debut, but he is expected to play a major
role in the Cardinal's offensive attack.
If the exhibition proved anything, it was that Stanford's
offense doesn't lack for depth at the guard and small for
ward positions. Senior guard Jarrett Mann, a two-year
starter in the backcourt, junior Gabe Harris, sophomore
Josh Huestis and sophomore Anthony Brown all played
well on Saturday, which could be a big bonus for head coach
Johnny Dawkins.
From the looks of it, the women's team is also spoiled
with talent, but in a different position. With returning All-
Pac-10 sisters in senior Nnemkadi and sophomore Chiney
Owgumike, as well as juniors Joslyn Tinkle and Sarah
Boothe, freshmen Taylor Greenfield and Samuelson, head
coach Tara VanDerveer might have trouble picking just
three forwards to start when the No. 5 Cardinal opens the
regular season on Friday at Texas.
Stanford used a 27-4 run to put the game out of reach of
the Lions after just over seven minutes, and the starting
lineup of both Ogwumike sisters plus Greenfield, freshman
guard Amber Orrange and senior guard Lindy La Rocque
combined for 44 points with 22 boards in just 83 minutes of
play, and Orrange chipped in six assists despite not scoring.
The team's field-goal percentage did take a somewhat
noticeable hit from the first exhibition game last week
against UC-San Diego, when the Card shot 57.5 percent
Stanford finished Saturday's win a tick under 45 percent
from the field.
The real tests for the Cardinal will come early and often
five of its first six games are against teams that made it
into last year's NCAA Tournament starting with the No.
21 Longhorns on Friday from Austin, Texas.
Dawkins and the men's team will also open the regular
season on Friday, hosting Central Arkansas at Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m.
