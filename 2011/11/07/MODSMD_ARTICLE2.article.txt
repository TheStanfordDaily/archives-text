# STUDENT LIFE
## CDC data shows salary, job trends 
### ELLORA ISRANI EDWARD NGAI 
Data collected by the Career Development Center
(CDC) showed that students earning bachelor's degrees in
2011 from the School of Humanities and Sciences received
an average starting salary of $54,951, while School of Engi
neering graduates received $72,148 on average.
Salaries on the survey which includes responses
from about 30 percent of graduates, according to CDC Di
rector Lance Choy ranged from $3,000 to $165,000 for
humanities and sciences grads and from $15,000 to
$120,000 for engineering students.
The survey also collected statistics on job-search time
frames for students graduating between 2006 and 2009.
About 70 percent of bachelors students in 2009 were able
to find a job within four months of searching, compared to
about 80 percent in 2006. Meanwhile, the percentage of stu
dents needing 10 or more months to find a job rose from 3
to 9 percent.
Choy cited market demand and the recruiting process
itself as the main determinants of job-search success.
"Some majors seem to be more popular, more in de
mand right now," he said, citing computer science as an ex
ample.
"But something you have to be careful about is the na
ture of employer recruiting," he continued. "Some employ-
ers are very structured in their pro
gramming. They know they're going
to hire X number of students. They'll
come in, do their hiring in the fall.
Other employers, for example, civil
engineering companies, they do just
in-time hiring when they get a proj
ect."

He showcased the financial and
consulting sectors, whose highly
structured recruiting programs
mean some economics and manage
ment science and engineering stu
dents tend to find jobs early. Howev
er, he did see that the recruiting
process depends as much on the stu
dents as it does on the job market.

"Just remember in terms of who
gets jobs the easiest, it really depends
on what they're pursuing," he said.
According to Bev Principal, stu
dent affairs officer at the CDC, com
panies hiring the most Stanford
grads this year were Google, Teach
for America, McKinsey & Company
and Bain & Company.
Choy also estimated that 30 to 35
percent of Stanford students who
earn bachelor's degrees pursue grad
uate degrees, which he called a
"much higher rate" than those at
peer institutions.

Senior Associate Dean for Stu
dent Affairs in Engineering and pro
fessor of electrical engineering Brad
Osgood also cited the co-term pro
gram as a "popular" option.
Career centers at peer institu
tions also collected data on their
graduates. Harvard, Yale, Princeton
and UC-Berkeley had 21,19,20 and
23 percent of bachelors students in
tending on attending graduate
school, respectively.

Those schools also collected data
on the number of students who in
tended to pursue employment after
graduation, with the numbers at 62,
75, 72 and 56 percent respectively.
Harvard's data was collected for the
class of 2011, Princeton's and UC-
Berkeley's for the class of 2010 and
Yale's for the class of 2010 one year
after graduation.
Princeton and UC-Berkeley also
published response rates at 98 and 39
percent.

As for Stanford students, both
Choy and Osgood said that most
Stanford students tend to stay in the
area after graduation.
"For engineering students, I think
one of the things that brought them
to Stanford is Silicon Valley," Os
good said.
Choy named the Bay Area as the
"biggest employer" of Stanford stu
dents, followed by southern Califor
nia, New York, Boston, Chicago and
Washington, D.C.
Across graduates and industries,
Choy noted that 2011 was a compar
atively better year for college grads
than those in the recent past.
"In a short-term trend, the mar
ket's rebounding," he said. "There's
more hiring in a lot of areas that were
depressed. All the areas are re
bounding and doing much better
than two years ago. Last year, there
was a strong surge in the number of
job postings in all areas.This year it's
looking fairly decent."
