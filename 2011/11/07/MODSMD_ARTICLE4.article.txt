## Study examines engineering gender gap 
### SARAH MOORE 
A lack of confidence exhibited by
some women is the main contributor
to the gender gap between the num
ber of males and females studying
engineering and following engineer
ing careers, according to a study pub
lished in the October issue of the
American Sociological Review.
The study also found that women
who begin their freshman year of
college with the intent of majoring in

engineering are much more likely
than their male peers to change ca
reer plans away from this field.
The research team for this study
was awarded a grant by the National
Science Foundation to study gender
issues within engineering education.
Researchers conducted the study by
surveying students at the Franklin
W. Olin College of Engineering,
Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, Smith College and University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, follow

ing students through their four years
of college.

"We hypothesized that as a result
of small biases, people tend to think
that men are more competent engi
neers," said postdoctoral fellow in
sociology and co-researcher Erin
Cech. "Women would actually de
velop less confidence in their ability
to be an engineer when they were
finished [with college] and have less
confidence that engineering was the
right profession for them."
Results indicated that a self
evaluation of competence was not
typically a reason for individuals of
either gender to leave the field.
Researchers also discovered that
men are deterred from a career path
in engineering because of the inten
tion of starting a family. This deci
sion to have children did not seem
to have as great an effect on the di
rection of women's studies or ca
reers.
"The family-plans effects for
men and not for women were a sur
prise," said co-researcher Brian Ru
bineau. "The others were consistent
with hypotheses."
Others find the study's conclu
sion interesting because they are
not reflected in the engineering
community with which they inter
act.
Alyson Yamada 'l3 is president
of Stanford's chapter of the Society
of Women Engineers and is study
ing biomechanical engineering. Ya
mada has found in her own interac
tions that females at Stanford do
not leave the engineering field for
competence or confidence reasons
but rather because another field
better relates to their interests.
"There have been times when
I've been on group projects for my
own classes when I've been the only

girl on the team, but that wasn't the
majority of teams in the class," she
said. "It's not a deterring factor in an
engineering class because I'm one
of two women in the class."
Yamada does acknowledge the
gap between men and women in
this area of study. She agreed with
Cech and others that something
must be done to address the divide.
The Society of Women Engineers is
actively working toward this end
through outreach programs for stu
dents at the elementary, middle and
high school levels and specifically
targeting girls as it works to gener
ate a general interest in the sciences.
"Our goal in doing that is to get
students from a young age to get re
ally excited about science, technolo
gy, engineering and math skills," Ya
mada said. "In order to have a better
distribution of men to women, cre
ating an interest in engineering
early on is key."
Cech suggested addressing con
fidence at the college level to im
prove female-retention statistics in
the field.
"It would be helpful to bring in
people from the workforce and
have them talk about insecurities
that come with graduating with a
degree and then going out into the
workforce and having to be a prac
ticing engineer," Cech said. "This
would allow students to see that
any kind of lack of confidence is not
a fault of their own but rather is just
how the profession works."
