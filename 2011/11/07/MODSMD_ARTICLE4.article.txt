## Study examines engineering gender gap 
### SARAH MOORE 
A lack of confidence exhibited by
some women is the main contributor
to the gender gap between the num
ber of males and females studying
engineering and following engineer
ing careers, according to a study pub
lished in the October issue of the
American Sociological Review.
The study also found that women
who begin their freshman year of
college with the intent of majoring in

engineering are much more likely
than their male peers to change ca
reer plans away from this field.
The research team for this study
was awarded a grant by the National
Science Foundation to study gender
issues within engineering education.
Researchers conducted the study by
surveying students at the Franklin
W. Olin College of Engineering,
Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy, Smith College and University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, follow

ing students through their four years
of college.

"We hypothesized that as a result
of small biases, people tend to think
that men are more competent engi
neers," said postdoctoral fellow in
sociology and co-researcher Erin
Cech. "Women would actually de
velop less confidence in their ability
to be an engineer when they were
finished [with college] and have less
