The Bing Overseas Studies
Program (BOSP) received a simi
lar number of applications for
spring quarter this year as for
spring quarter last year, adminis
trators recently announced.
A total of 292 students applied
to BOSP programs in eight coun
tries on four continents. The appli
cations were more evenly spread
across all programs, according to
an email to The Daily from Lee
Dukes, student relations coordina
tor for the Bing Overseas Studies
Program.
Before this year, BOSP appli
cation numbers had steadily in
creased by between 6 and 9 per
cent each year. The program ex
pects that soon 50 percent of all
undergraduates will study abroad.
Programs with the highest
number of applicants included
Berlin with 54, Oxford with 52 and
Paris with 42. Santiago, on the
other hand, received only 15.
According to Dukes, Bing
looks for students who are
"unique applicants" and have in
teresting personal stories or rea
sons for wanting to study abroad.
For programs that are not in
English, Dukes said BOSP prefers
that, "students take as much lan
guage here at Stanford [as] they
can before they go on the pro
gram, that way they get to take ad
vantage of more opportunities
while they are abroad like local
university classes, research and in
ternships."
Cheryl Miyake 'l3 was accept
ed into the Beijing program for

spring 2012. Miyake has spent the
past two summers in Beijing doing
research at Peking University.
"I really like China, both cul
turally and socially," Miyake said.
She said her prior knowledge
of China made her excited about
the prospect of going back and ex
ploring the country further.
"Traveling to a place you've al
ready been to is totally different
when you go with a new group of
people," Miyake said.
A full year of Chinese language
study at Stanford is required to
apply to Beijing in the spring.
Miyake said she is currently at an
intermediate conversational level
in Mandarin, but she hopes to im
prove her language skills during
her time in Beijing. She was plan
ning on staying in Beijing for the
rest of the summer to do research.
Miyake also applied for the
Stanford in Washington program.
The applications were due last
Monday, and the results have not
yet been released.
Marcus Leaks 'l3 also plans to
participate in BOSP this spring in
Cape Town, South Africa.
"The biggest selling point [of
Cape Town] was definitely the
service-based-learning aspect of
the program," Leaks said.
Leaks has been involved in
many service activities during his
time at Stanford, including Alter
native Spring Break.
"I learn a lot more about myself
and about the world from doing
service than I do from sitting in a
lecture hall," Leaks said.
