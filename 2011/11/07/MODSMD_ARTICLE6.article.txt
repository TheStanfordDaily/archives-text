## OpenSim simulates human movement with robotics 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Stanford researchers have devel
oped an open-source, human-in
spired robotics technology that sim
ulates human movement and can be
scaled to match individual body
sizes, ages and genders.
The technology, known as Open-
Sim, is now on display at the Leonar
do Technology Museum in Salt Lake
City, Utah.
Open Sim simulates muscle mo
tion in a similar way to popular ani
mations of people in movies or in
video games. Its muscular-skeletal
simulations differ from other virtual
worlds as they are based on interdis
ciplinary developments in math,
physics, anatomy and physiology.
Because the software requires ex
tensive knowledge of these fields, it
is targeted toward biomechanical
scientists, clinicians and other devel
opers.
Professor of orthopedic surgery
Scott Delp developed Open Sim in
2007. He said his long-term goal is to
create simulation tools that could be
applied to address important clinical
problems.
Delp developed the project as

part of SimTK, an online host for
software from the National Institute
of Health's Center for Biomedical
Computation at Stanford (Sim-
Bios), which allotted money to fund
the Open Sim project.
According to Delp, one of the re
searchers' objectives was to "help
biomedical researchers understand
biological form and function as they
create novel drugs, synthetic tissues,
medical devices and surgical inter
ventions."
Scientists have already used the
tool to benefit patients. For example,
researchers used Open Sim to esti
mate how knee and hip joints are
loaded during everyday movements.
"This helped us understand how
osteoarthritis [abnormal and accel
erated degeneration of the cartilage
in the joint] develops and determine
better ways to prevent it," wrote
Open Sim product manager Jennifer
Hicks in an email to The Daily.
Delp and his associates created
Open Sim to act as a middleman be
tween the large quantities of data,
biomechanical simulation and later
medical application.

Researchers who developed the Open Sim technology to model movement
are showcasing their progress at the Leonardo Technology Museum.
He said the project aims "to pro
vide a platform on which the biome
chanics community can build tools
that help uncover the principles that
govern human movement and de
sign better treatments for individu
als with physical disabilities."
"We can then make predictions
and compare these predictions to re
ality," Hicks added.
Although Open Sim allows re
searchers to share data more freely,
Hicks warned against calling it open
source.

"We plan to become truly open
source by the definitions of the
Open Source Initiative in the com
ing months," she said. "Since the
software is free, it is also great to use
in teaching and workshops since stu
dents don't have to pay for using the
software."
