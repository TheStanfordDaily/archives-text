## OpenSim simulates human movement with robotics 
### ALEXIS GARDUNO 
Stanford researchers have devel
oped an open-source, human-in
spired robotics technology that sim
ulates human movement and can be
scaled to match individual body
sizes, ages and genders.
The technology, known as Open-
Sim, is now on display at the Leonar
do Technology Museum in Salt Lake
City, Utah.
Open Sim simulates muscle mo
tion in a similar way to popular ani
mations of people in movies or in
video games. Its muscular-skeletal
simulations differ from other virtual
worlds as they are based on interdis
ciplinary developments in math,
physics, anatomy and physiology.
Because the software requires ex
tensive knowledge of these fields, it
is targeted toward biomechanical
scientists, clinicians and other devel
opers.
Professor of orthopedic surgery
Scott Delp developed Open Sim in
2007. He said his long-term goal is to
create simulation tools that could be
applied to address important clinical
problems.
Delp developed the project as

part of SimTK, an online host for
software from the National Institute
of Health's Center for Biomedical
Computation at Stanford (Sim-
Bios), which allotted money to fund
the Open Sim project.
According to Delp, one of the re
searchers' objectives was to "help
biomedical researchers understand
biological form and function as they
create novel drugs, synthetic tissues,
medical devices and surgical inter
ventions."
Scientists have already used the
tool to benefit patients. For example,
researchers used Open Sim to esti
mate how knee and hip joints are
loaded during everyday movements.
"This helped us understand how
osteoarthritis [abnormal and accel
erated degeneration of the cartilage
in the joint] develops and determine
better ways to prevent it," wrote
Open Sim product manager Jennifer
Hicks in an email to The Daily.
Delp and his associates created
Open Sim to act as a middleman be
tween the large quantities of data,
biomechanical simulation and later
medical application.
