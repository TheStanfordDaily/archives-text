## Tech giants wield influence at Stanford 
### TAYLOR GROSSMAN 
Public scrutiny over a report confirming that Google
Inc. spent $5.4 million on lobbying in Washington D.C. in
the first three quarters of 2011 has raised awareness
among students and faculty about the influence that
Google and other high-tech companies wield at Stanford.
Stanford and Google have had a close relationship
since the co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin
formed the company as graduate students. Google do
nates $1 million per year to the Computer Science De
partment alone, according to CS professor Eric Roberts.
Google's predecessor, Back√üub, was launched on
Stanford servers before it became too large to support.
The company's business plan was also developed at Stan
ford.
"Stanford faculty members were very active in men
toring the founders," Roberts said.
Roberts served as a mentor to Marissa Mayer B.S. '97
M.S. '99, current Google vice president of location and
local services.
"For my role, it was really getting someone like Maris
sa, who had never imagined doing something like com
puter science, moving in that direction," he said.
According to a recent interview with Google CEO
Eric Schmidt in The Washington Post, Google's preferred
method of influence is "to lobby based on ideas."
However, according to Roberts, Stanford and Google
continue to have close ties, both official and organic.
"Google has continued, through the founders, to have
a relationship with Stanford," he said. "Stanford owns
some of the intellectual property. The patents on search
and the like generate royalties for Stanford as well, and
that's been helpful."

"Google has given a large grant. They endowed the
Rajeev Motwani Chair in Rajeev's memory," he added.
Google's annual $1 million donation is not directed
toward particular projects but is a gift to be used at the de
partment's discretion.
Yahoo! Co-founder Jerry Yang and his wife,Akiko Ya
mazaki, funded the Science and Engineering Quad's
Y2E2 building dedicated to the environment and energy.
According to the project's manager Maggie Burnett, the
duo visited the site during construction but did not con
tribute to its direct design
ASSU Vice President Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3
noted that Google and other companies do not common
ly fund specific initiatives or projects through the ASSU.
However, its financial branch, Stanford Student Enter
prises (SSE), does include the startup accelerator StartX,
which has multiple corporate sponsors.
Roberts further noted that several of his colleagues
have gone to work for Google recently on an interim or
