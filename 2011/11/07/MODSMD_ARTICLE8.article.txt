## David Sedaris shares stories, perspective 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
Grammy Award-nominated co
median David Sedaris read from his
works in a campus talk which pro
fessor of English Tobias Wolff intro
duced as "emphatically not well-be
haved, emphatically incorrect."
The Creative Writing Program
hosted the event Sunday evening in
Memorial Auditorium.

Sedaris, who has sold more than
7 million copies of his books world
wide, touched on topics ranging
from personal childhood stories to
jokes he has heard on tour, drawing
laughter from the crowd. He began
with a story about an airport.
"[Airports] are a forum to allow
us to be our true selves," he said.
"Not just hateful, but gloriously so.
Whether it is close-minded conser
vatives complaining about the kids

these days or the true way flight at
tendants fart on airplanes hint,
they call it crop-dusting there is
always raw humanity at airports,
and it's not always pretty."
Sedaris spoke candidly about
traditionally sensitive topics, mak
ing fun of family members' weight
in order to divert attention from
what he described as his poor swim
ming ability. He offered no apology
for it, instead emphasizing its ease.
"Buck teeth, failing grades, it was
like shooting fish in a barrel," he
said.
He also delved freely into his re
lationship with his father through a
story published in "The New York
er" in which he portrays his father as
incapable of offering praise or ap
proval. Sedaris recalled calling to
tell his father his book was number
one on The New York Times Best
Sellers List.
"It's not number one on the Wall
Street Journal list," his father said.
"My dad was like the Marine
Corps," Sedaris said. "Except in
stead of tearing you down and put
ting you back together, he just did
the first part and called it a day."
The live performance also of
fered unscripted insights into
Sedaris' stories after he read them,
including information not present
in the print edition.
For example, Sedaris mentioned
a childhood acquaintance named
Greg Sakas, who was a contender
for his father's attention and an ob
ject of Sedaris's intense dislike.
When Sedaris' story was set to pub
lish in "The New Yorker," however,
the publication's fact-checking de
partment discovered that Sakas was
now selling sex toys in rural North
Carolina.

"I won," Sedaris said. "That's
mean."

Sedaris ended his talk by recom
mending Peter Hessler's book
"River Town: Two Years on the
Yangtze." He said it lifted the veil on
what life in rural China is really like.
After Sedaris read a short passage
from the book, he encouraged audi
ence members to explore the book
on their own.

"I would buy this book before I
bought anything I've written,"
Sedaris said. "It's much better."
