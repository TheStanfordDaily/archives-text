# Campus culture counted in the rings of E1 Palo Alto

### PEPITO ESCARCE 
Between the Band's syn
chronized instrumental
swing and the Dollies'
dance routine at a foot
ball game, the Tree
stands out. It looks like a toy
Christmas tree, but has two eyes
and a toothy grin attached to its
leaves. Its trunk jumps and twirls
as Michael Samuels 'l2, the man
inside, rocks out to tunes.

The Band's Tree, a relatively re
cent invention, is famous for its ap
pearance, irreverence and status as
Stanford's unofficial mascot and as
an icon of Stanford culture. How
ever, the source of this mascot goes
back to the 18th century and a 110-
foot redwood named El Palo Alto.
The redwood is located a little
over four blocks northwest of the
Palo Alto Caltrain station in El
Palo Alto Park, which was built in
1971. It is so tall that an observer
standing on the ground next to the
tree cannot see its top.

Despite its size, the redwood is
not as prominent as one might ex
pect. Many trees surround the
walkway around El Palo Alto
Park. However, a plaque on a boul
der next to the tree indicates its
significance. The historical society
Native Sons of the Golden West
designated this plaque to com
memorate the founding of the City
of Palo Alto. The plaque reads,
"Under this Giant Redwood, the
Palo Alto, November 6 to 11,1769,
camped Portola and his band on
the expedition that discovered San
Francisco Bay."
Gaspar de Portola was the first
European explorer to discover the
San Francisco Bay. El Palo Alto
served as a reference point to his
base camp because it could be seen
from miles away.
"To the Spaniards, it was a clear
landmark because all the other
trees in the area were much small
er oaks," said Steve Staiger, a Palo
Alto historian.
As the site of their base camp,
they named the tree "El Palo
Alto," Spanish for

"the tall tree." The region became
known as Palo Alto, where the
Stanford family would eventually
settle on a farm.
After Leland Stanford Jr. died
in 1884, his parents dedicated the
rest of the decade to planning and
building Stanford University on
their farm. When the campus host
ed its first students in 1891, six fam
ilies lived in Palo Alto. That quick
ly changed. Palo Alto became a
college town for the University, at
tracting campus workers, profes
sors and investors from San Fran
cisco. The Stanfords embedded a
rendition of El Palo Alto in the
Stanford crest, making it a symbol
for the University. Stanford and El
Palo Alto Park, then, serve to com
memorate California's oldest liv
ing landmark, according to a 1999
Palo Alto city manager's report.
Addressing traditions regard
ing the tree, "It depends who you
ask," Staiger said. "A lot of people
don't know the tree even exists."

In the past, students "held a
yearly class contest to see who
could place the class flag at the top
of the tree," the city manager's re
port stated. However, in 1909, be
cause a student became stuck in
the tree, this annual tradition
ended and the tree lost a signifi
cant part of its role in Stanford cul
ture until the Band's mascot
emerged.
The Tree, inspired by El Palo
Alto, debuted in a 1975 halftime
show. The Tree gained popularity
and made several appearances in
other field shows. Eventually, it be
came a regular, and the Band
adopted the Tree as its official mas
cot. It should not be confused,
though, with Stanford University's
official mascot, Cardinal. But why
are they different?
In 1930, the Indians became the
University's mas

cot, a mascot ultimately deemed
offensive. In 1972, 55 Native
American students and staff mem
bers petitioned to have it removed.
The University complied, but
needed to find a new mascot. In
1978, students voted for the Rob
ber Barons as the new mascot, but
the Department of Athletics re
jected the idea. Finally, in 1981, the
University permanently estab
lished Cardinal as its mascot.

Although the Tree is an unoffi
cial mascot, it is inextricably tied to
campus and Band culture.

"We think the idea of a mascot
is absurd," said Band manager Ben
"Ditto" Lasley 'll. "You can't see
them, they can't talk, you can't
even know who it is at a lot of
schools. The Tree makes a mockery
of everyone who takes themselves
so seriously. It's an extension of the
spirit of the Band."
The Band and the Tree pride
themselves on their spirit of irrev
erence, and media sources lavish
attention on the Tree. Last year,
"Page 2" on ESPN.com rated the
Tree the worst major college mas
cot.

Preforming at Band Run, Fos
ter Field, Maples Pavilion and on
College Game Day, among other
things, the Tree is perpetually busy.

"Athletic events are about half
of what I do," Samuels said. "Any
time I'm not doing something else,
I'm doing something for Tree. It's
going by so quickly. It's taken over
my life, in a good way."

Samuels will remain the Stan
ford Tree until the end of winter
quarter. Then he will pass his lega
cy on to the next Tree, which will be
chosen during Stanford's annual
Tree Week.

The boisterous, iconic mascot
found on campus starkly contrasts
with the stoic landmark that in
spired it. As the campus continues
to evolve, El Palo Alto will contin
ue to stand, marking the years that
pass ring by ring.

in 1884, his parents dedicated the
rest of the decade to planning and
building Stanford University on
their farm. When the campus host
ed its first students in 1891, six fam
ilies lived in Palo Alto. That quick
ly changed. Palo Alto became a
college town for the University, at
tracting campus workers, profes
sors and investors from San Fran
cisco. The Stanfords embedded a
rendition of El Palo Alto in the
Stanford crest, making it a symbol
for the University. Stanford and El
Palo Alto Park, then, serve to com
memorate California's oldest liv
ing landmark, according to a 1999
Palo Alto city manager's report.
Addressing traditions regard
ing the tree, "It depends who you
ask," Staiger said. "A lot of people
don't know the tree even exists."

In the past, students "held a
yearly class contest to see who
could place the class flag at the top
of the tree," the city manager's re
port stated. However, in 1909, be
cause a student became stuck in
the tree, this annual tradition
ended and the tree lost a signifi
cant part of its role in Stanford cul
ture until the Band's mascot
emerged.
The Tree, inspired by El Palo
Alto, debuted in a 1975 halftime
show. The Tree gained popularity
and made several appearances in
other field shows. Eventually, it be
came a regular, and the Band
adopted the Tree as its official mas
cot. It should not be confused,
though, with Stanford University's
official mascot, Cardinal. But why
are they different?
In 1930, the Indians became the
University's mas

cot, a mascot ultimately deemed
offensive. In 1972, 55 Native
American students and staff mem
bers petitioned to have it removed.
The University complied, but
needed to find a new mascot. In
1978, students voted for the Rob
ber Barons as the new mascot, but
the Department of Athletics re
jected the idea. Finally, in 1981, the
University permanently estab
lished Cardinal as its mascot.

Although the Tree is an unoffi
cial mascot, it is inextricably tied to
campus and Band culture.

"We think the idea of a mascot
is absurd," said Band manager Ben
"Ditto" Lasley 'll. "You can't see
them, they can't talk, you can't
even know who it is at a lot of
schools. The Tree makes a mockery
of everyone who takes themselves
so seriously. It's an extension of the
spirit of the Band."
The Band and the Tree pride
themselves on their spirit of irrev
erence, and media sources lavish
attention on the Tree. Last year,
"Page 2" on ESPN.com rated the
Tree the worst major college mas
cot.

Preforming at Band Run, Fos
ter Field, Maples Pavilion and on
College Game Day, among other
things, the Tree is perpetually busy.

"Athletic events are about half
of what I do," Samuels said. "Any
time I'm not doing something else,
I'm doing something for Tree. It's
going by so quickly. It's taken over
my life, in a good way."

Samuels will remain the Stan
ford Tree until the end of winter
quarter. Then he will pass his lega
cy on to the next Tree, which will be
chosen during Stanford's annual
Tree Week.

The boisterous, iconic mascot
found on campus starkly contrasts
with the stoic landmark that in
spired it. As the campus continues
to evolve, El Palo Alto will contin
ue to stand, marking the years that
pass ring by ring.

Between the Band's syn
chronized instrumental
swing and the Dollies'
dance routine at a foot
ball game, the Tree
stands out. It looks like a toy
Christmas tree, but has two eyes
and a toothy grin attached to its
leaves. Its trunk jumps and twirls
as Michael Samuels 'l2, the man
inside, rocks out to tunes.

The Band's Tree, a relatively re
cent invention, is famous for its ap
pearance, irreverence and status as
Stanford's unofficial mascot and as
an icon of Stanford culture. How
ever, the source of this mascot goes
back to the 18th century and a 110-
foot redwood named El Palo Alto.
The redwood is located a little
over four blocks northwest of the
Palo Alto Caltrain station in El
Palo Alto Park, which was built in
1971. It is so tall that an observer
standing on the ground next to the
tree cannot see its top.

Despite its size, the redwood is
not as prominent as one might ex
pect. Many trees surround the
walkway around El Palo Alto
Park. However, a plaque on a boul
der next to the tree indicates its
significance. The historical society
Native Sons of the Golden West
designated this plaque to com
memorate the founding of the City
of Palo Alto. The plaque reads,
"Under this Giant Redwood, the
Palo Alto, November 6 to 11,1769,
camped Portola and his band on
the expedition that discovered San
Francisco Bay."
Gaspar de Portola was the first
European explorer to discover the
San Francisco Bay. El Palo Alto
served as a reference point to his
base camp because it could be seen
from miles away.
"To the Spaniards, it was a clear
landmark because all the other
trees in the area were much small
er oaks," said Steve Staiger, a Palo
Alto historian.
As the site of their base camp,
they named the tree "El Palo
Alto," Spanish for

"the tall tree." The region became
known as Palo Alto, where the
Stanford family would eventually
settle on a farm.
