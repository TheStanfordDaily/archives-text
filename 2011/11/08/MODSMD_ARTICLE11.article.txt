## I'M DONE WITH MY LIFE The
						art of waiting 
### Camira Powell 
The saying goes, "Patience is a
virtue," and for the most part,
I have considered myself an
exemplar of that. I'm not in a hurry
to become an adult (though I feel
like an old lady at times), I can stand
waiting for the return of "True
Blood" and I rarely feel the need to
rush anywhere (much to the chagrin
of anyone I'm meeting).
Yet that theory has been
checked, starting with my first day
at Howard when I moved into "The
Towers." Every day it gets tested
when I have to wait for my Internet
to work again after it cuts out for the
thousandth time, or I'm sitting in a
classroom waiting the mandatory
20 minutes for my professor to show
up. Coming from Stanford, a place
where students have panic attacks if
it takes more than .03 seconds for a
webpage to load, I couldn't under
stand how anyone at Howard re
mained so calm when dealing with
these situations. While I was going
crazy, they were just fine, unruffled
by the slowness of the system.
Eventually, I realized that the
issue didn't just stem from my lack
of patience. Yes, I wasn't as patient
as I liked to believe, but the real
problem was that I had been wait
ing the wrong way my entire life.
I found this out unintentionally
when my friend announced that she
wanted to perform at an open mic
night. The place would be packed
on a Friday night, so we wanted to
get things done in advance. We at
tempted to buy tickets beforehand,
but we discovered they wouldn't be
sold until that night. So we got in
line well before show started at 11
p.m., waiting close to an hour to
make sure we received tickets.
Once inside, we waited for the show
to start. When the show started, we
waited for the show to get good.
When the show was good, we wait
ed for my friend to perform. How
ever, they told her she would have
to wait until next month to perform
because the set list was full.
Although my impatient self felt
that night was a waste of time,
something valuable actually hap
pened. Back when we were stuck in
the liminal space between outside
and in, we met another pair of peo
ple in the same situation. My friend
and I had arrived with a purpose,
but this pair barely knew what they
had gotten themselves into. They
had just left their play rehearsal and
joined the line hoping that whatev
er was on the other side of the wait
would be worth it. So as we commis
erated over our prolonged fate, we
got to know the people behind us,
who were more entertaining than
many of the performers showcased.
History has repeatedly shown
that waiting long enough is great

motivation to get something done
(Civil Rights Movement, Arab
Spring and more). I understood
why by the end of the night. We
were all tired of waiting, so my
friend decided to have her own im
promptu open mic, new friends in
cluded. I stood in the cold listening
to her sing on the street like it was
a spotlighted stage in front of a
packed theater. It was amazing.
Our new friends then joined her
on the street corner stage, belting
out a rendition of "Impossible"
from Rodgers and Hammerstein's
"Cinderella" that would have
made a pre-crack Whitney Hous
ton proud.
The songs sounded so sweet not
only because the singers were tal
ented, but also because of the antic
ipation built up through the wait.
Waiting can make highs higher and
the lows even worse. Think of the
last time you waited for something
an album release, an answer to a
difficult question, a (worthwhile)
Facebook notification and what
it felt like to finally get it. Anticipat
ing the result can lead to unmet ex
pectations, which sucks. But that's
what waiting is: the expectation that
the end result is worth your time.
When waiting, most of us curse
time if it stands between us and
what we want. It's ingrained in our
DNA to not like waiting, to wish we
were moving forward, not stagnat
ing in the same place. Waiting is not
an option, but a requirement of life.
We wait for things to come, to pass,
to happen, anything that matters.
I'm still perfecting the art of wait
ing, but I do know that if the wrong
way to wait is focusing on what
you're not doing yet, then the right
must be figuring out what can be
done in the meantime.
