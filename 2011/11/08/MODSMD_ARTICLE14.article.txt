# THE 						YOUNG ADULT SECTION
## People and fear 
### Nina Chung 
I think people are afraid of peo
ple. It sounds weird only because
we don't typically diagnose it as
fear. But if we take some of our
greatest ones bad first impres
sions, feeling out of place, being
judged it all comes down to this
strange, unacknowledged fear of
other people. Perhaps with all the
unknowns in this universe and be
yond, the ones inside ourselves are
the scariest.

Starting in freshman year of high
school, as I stood with chatty team
mates in tennis skirts on the courts,
I used to feel completely trapped in
my own head. You know the feeling.

It's a unique combination of being
lost for words, conscious of correct
laughter cues, aware of how in
volved you are in the conversation
and stressed that the others are
creeped out that you might not be.
In this situation, you don't want to
say anything wrong. So you think
about everything before you say it.
And, as we all know, doing that can
make anything sound weird. Ulti
mately, I never felt effortless or
comfortable amid these girls and
their conversation (or gossip and
complaints, more accurately). I
spent about two years of practices
and matches in private fits, thinking
I was toeing a thin line between "in
sider" and "outsider." I then quit,
joined broadcast journalism (which
rocked my remaining high school
career) and realized I had legiti
mately very little in common with
most of my former teammates. I had
been so self-conscious, so afraid of
my social status with those girls.
Why?

For most people, that situation
has become so normal that it's
taken for granted. Imagine sitting at
lunch with a group of people. And
no matter how beautiful it is out
side, how great the food is, how
friendly the people are (and even
more so if they're not), we somehow
become acutely sensitive to the mo
ment. Suddenly, everything we
would normally have said outright
demands a second guess. Will they
get this joke? Does this comment
fit? When should I say it? Now? Too
late? Do I laugh now? Maybe I'll
agree to everything. Is it weird I'm
wearing this jacket when it's this
nice out... Oh my goodness.
For me, this kind of hesitancy in
speech is a major alarm that some
unnaturalness is going on. Internal
head-games, my friend they're
unbelievably exhausting. And even
in some of my closest friends, I can
almost literally see thoughts mari
nating or speeches being mentally
perfected for so long that they
never get said. Then, with emotions
bottled up, people either blow up at
someone or resort to passive-ag
gressiveness— two reactions that
are frustratingly hard to engage
with. The biggest irony is that when
we lose ourselves in over-analysis of
our image, we also lose the opportu
nity to talk for real. And at that
point, what they think of us will be
an artificial idea anyway.

Of all the fears that sink to the
pits of our stomachs and tie knots
there, our fear of other people
might be the most powerful one. It
pervades the simplest, most every-

day moments especially the
fleeting ones that seem the least im
portant. There's definitely an es
cape route, though, in making this
fear useful. After all, the fear tells us
exactly who we're defining as im
portant and how much we're glori
fying them. If we decide that we're
paying our worry and time to some
one who deserves our precious en
ergy, fine. (For example, if we get a
bloody nose in a shark-infested
ocean, fear for our lives with respect
to a man-eating fish is logical.) But
if we realize we're putting another
person and his or her random opin
ions on a pedestal, we might also re
alize how ridiculous it actually is.
At this school, so many of us pur
sue lofty standards and achieve
unimaginable accomplishments in
research, government policies and
public service ... and it's amazing.
Yet when it comes down to our most
basic relations with our peers, we
still fall victim to this fear of seem
ing weird. Or wrong. Or offensive.
Or whatever.
I choose to believe in a few
things that truly deserve fear, re
spect and deference. However, how
we're considered by another human
person is seriously not one of them.
The thought strikes so much more
fear into people than it has the legit
imate authority to. People are peo
ple: imperfect, completely unique,
keepers of stories that can't be read
on faces. So why are we so afraid of
seeming otherwise?
It's okay. Just do it. Just say it.
Especially when hesitation hits.

What will Nina think if you email her
in response? It doesn't matter. (For
the record, she would really love to
hear that you read the column at all.)

complaints, more accurately). I
spent about two years of practices
and matches in private fits, thinking
I was toeing a thin line between "in
sider" and "outsider." I then quit,
joined broadcast journalism (which
rocked my remaining high school
career) and realized I had legiti
mately very little in common with
most of my former teammates. I had
been so self-conscious, so afraid of
my social status with those girls.
Why?

For most people, that situation
has become so normal that it's
taken for granted. Imagine sitting at
lunch with a group of people. And
no matter how beautiful it is out
side, how great the food is, how
friendly the people are (and even
more so if they're not), we somehow
become acutely sensitive to the mo
ment. Suddenly, everything we
would normally have said outright
demands a second guess. Will they
get this joke? Does this comment
fit? When should I say it? Now? Too
late? Do I laugh now? Maybe I'll
agree to everything. Is it weird I'm
wearing this jacket when it's this
nice out... Oh my goodness.
For me, this kind of hesitancy in
speech is a major alarm that some
unnaturalness is going on. Internal
head-games, my friend they're
unbelievably exhausting. And even
in some of my closest friends, I can
almost literally see thoughts mari
nating or speeches being mentally
perfected for so long that they
never get said. Then, with emotions
bottled up, people either blow up at
someone or resort to passive-ag
gressiveness— two reactions that
are frustratingly hard to engage
with. The biggest irony is that when
we lose ourselves in over-analysis of
our image, we also lose the opportu
nity to talk for real. And at that
point, what they think of us will be
an artificial idea anyway.

Of all the fears that sink to the
pits of our stomachs and tie knots
there, our fear of other people
might be the most powerful one. It
pervades the simplest, most every-

day moments especially the
fleeting ones that seem the least im
portant. There's definitely an es
cape route, though, in making this
fear useful. After all, the fear tells us
exactly who we're defining as im
portant and how much we're glori
fying them. If we decide that we're
paying our worry and time to some
one who deserves our precious en
ergy, fine. (For example, if we get a
bloody nose in a shark-infested
ocean, fear for our lives with respect
to a man-eating fish is logical.) But
if we realize we're putting another
person and his or her random opin
ions on a pedestal, we might also re
alize how ridiculous it actually is.
At this school, so many of us pur
sue lofty standards and achieve
unimaginable accomplishments in
research, government policies and
public service ... and it's amazing.
Yet when it comes down to our most
basic relations with our peers, we
still fall victim to this fear of seem
ing weird. Or wrong. Or offensive.
Or whatever.
I choose to believe in a few
things that truly deserve fear, re
spect and deference. However, how
we're considered by another human
person is seriously not one of them.
The thought strikes so much more
fear into people than it has the legit
imate authority to. People are peo
ple: imperfect, completely unique,
keepers of stories that can't be read
on faces. So why are we so afraid of
seeming otherwise?
It's okay. Just do it. Just say it.
Especially when hesitation hits.
