## POOR FINISH Card loses 3-0 on Senior Day 
### TORSTEIN HOSET 
Sunday's game against
UCLA saw a good number of
people showing up on the crisp
autumn afternoon to watch the
Stanford men's soccer team's
last home contest of the season.
With Senior Day as a perfect
backdrop for what promised to
be a cracking game, the Cardi
nal seniors were eager to lead
their team to its fifth consecu
tive home win against UCLA
in their final outing at Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium. However, the
Cardinal was outmatched,
falling 3-0 to the Bruins.

Stanford was coming off a
very convincing performance
against San Diego State on Fri
day and had all the confidence
and momentum in the world
going into the tough matchup
against the Bruins. The fresh
men had their coming out party
on Friday; now it was time for
the seniors to shine.

From the very start, howev
er, a very impressive-looking
UCLA team took control of
the game and never looked
back. The first half saw Stan
ford struggling to keep up with
the Bruins' tempo on the ball.
After an uneventful first 13
minutes, the Bruins struck as
Stanford's defense was caught
out of position. A through-ball

found an unmarked Victor
Chavez, who had the time and
space to place a cool finish past
sophomore goalie Drew
Hutchins.

Less than a minute later, dis
aster struck again as a low-driv
en cross from Bruin midfielder
Eder Arreola hit senior right
back Adoni Levine, who put
the ball into his own net and
gave the visitors a two-goal
lead. At that point, head coach
Bret Simon knew it would be
difficult to get back into the
game.

"We dug ourselves too big
of a hole early in the game,"
Simon said. "Against an experi
enced opponent like UCLA,
you just can't do that."
The Bruin powerhouse kept
churning out chance after
chance, showcasing their domi
nance and making clear to
everyone why they're ranked
No. 8 in the nation.

Stanford looked dangerous
on a few occasions after the
goals, but the Cardinal failed to
pick up where it left off against
San Diego State.
After the break, Stanford
looked more aggressive, creat
ing a few opportunities in the
opening minutes but failing to
convert pressure into goals.
After 57 minutes, the game was
put beyond all doubt, as Bruin
defender Shawn Singh scored a
somewhat special goal from 30
yards out, bending an intended
cross into the far upper corner.

Minutes later, Stanford sen
ior midfielder Taylor Amman
got a great scoring chance on
the right side after a good Car
dinal attack, but the shot and
subsequent rebound fizzled out
and amounted to nothing. In

the end, UCLA could bag a
comfortable three-point victo
ry the team's first at Cagan
Stadium since 2005 thereby
manifesting its position as the
best team in the conference and
extending its perfect confer
ence record to 9-0. After the
game, Simon was sad to see the
seniors going out with such a
bad loss.

"I am disappointed for
them; we really wanted to send
them off in a better manner," he
said. "It's a team that we've
beaten the last several years
here at home, and their starting
11 was virtually the same as a
year ago. Sadly, they happen to
be playing very well this time of
year."

Friday's game against San
Diego State was quite a differ
ent story. The Aztecs came to
Stanford looking for a win to
give them a chance to climb
back into contention for the
NCAA Tournament. They will
surely be disappointed after
surprisingly being sent home
with nothing but a metaphori
cal kick in the groin from the
Cardinal, as Stanford won 4-1.

"We went up against a very
good team with many talented
players," Simon said. "I'm very
happy with our display today."

An enthusiastic Stanford
team took a good quarter of an
hour to settle down and start
chipping away at the Aztec de
fense, but once the Cardinal
train started rolling, it seemed
unstoppable.

Freshman forward Jimmy Callinan was part of a potent freshman attack in Friday's 4-1 win
over San Diego State. The Cardinal couldn't get anything going on Sunday in a 3-0 loss.
low free kick that snuck in by the
right post. It took the Aztecs only
four minutes to respond, as junior
forward Ata Ozbay ripped an
amazing shot from 35 yards out to
beat Flutchins high.
The Cardinal didn't let up, an
swering promptly as senior mid
fielder Garrett Gunther was re
warded with a penalty kick after
taking the ball past four opponents
before being brought down. He
slotted it home to put Stanford
back in the lead after 20 minutes.

If Sunday was Senior Day, then
Friday was Freshman Night: Stan

ford's impressive trio of freshman
forwards Felipe Noguerol,
Jimmy Callinan and Zach Batteer
were in the game together in the
first half, impacting the action im
mediately. Noguerol scored his first
goal of the season on a rebound
from a Batteer cross only three
minutes after being subbed in, and
Callinan occasionally dominated in
the midfield for the Cardinal.
Simon didn't seem at all surprised
at his young pupils' impact.
"They've been coming along
very well," he said. "They've been
training hard and have come close
to making a big difference in nu
merous games this season. Today is
just the first game where they all
pulled together and helped carry
the team. I'm very happy for
them."

In the second half, the Cardinal
clung on to its lead fiercely, retain
ing the upper hand in the game and
putting more shots on goal than the
Aztecs. The freshmen kept up their
good performances, and five min
utes before full-time a good attack
orchestrated by Callinan set up
Noguerol for a shot which was de
flected by the goalkeeper. Senior
midfielder Dersu Abolfathi was
first to sniff out the rebound and
scored his third goal of the season,
effectively wrapping up the win for
the Cardinal.
Stanford now travels across the
Bay to face California in its last
game of the season. The game kicks
off at 2 p.m. on Friday in Berkeley.
