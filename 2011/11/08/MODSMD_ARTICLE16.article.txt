## Stanford softball sweeps pair of weekend doubleheaders to complete fall season 
### â€“ Miles Bennett-Smith 
The Stanford Softball team
played a very rude host to the San
Francisco State and Santa Clara
squads this weekend, sending both
teams home disappointed after
sweeping back-to-back double
headers on Saturday and Sunday.
Saturday saw the Cardinal's of
fense explode against the Gators
in a pair of routs, as Stanford won
by scores of 15-2 and 16-1. The
runs came from up and down the
lineup, but the strong performanc
es by the Cardinal in the circle
were perhaps more important.
Junior Teagan Gerhart and
freshman Nyree White both were
very sharp in their appearances,
each pitching a game on Saturday
and splitting duties in both games
on Sunday against Santa Clara.
The Broncos put up a little
more resistance but were still
overmatched by a potent Stanford
team that returns most of its start
ing lineup as well as its ace, Ger
hart. The Cardinal beat Santa
Clara 8-0 and 6-0 on Sunday, and
White allowed just two hits as sen
ior infielder Jenna Becerra hit a
home run and senior catcher/out
fielder Maya Burns hit a three-run
double as part of a six-run fourth
inning.

With the fall schedule complete,
the Cardinal will have to wait until
Feb. 10 to return to action as it kicks
off the 2012 season at the Kajikawa
Classic in Tempe, Ariz., against Cal
State-Northridge.
