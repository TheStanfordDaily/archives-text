## 
### 
As was widely expected, the No.
1 Cardinal was awarded the top
overall seed for the NCAA
Women's Soccer Tournament on
Monday and will host Montana in
the first round on Friday.
The Grizzlies (6-11-4) surprised
Weber State in the Big Sky confer
ence finals to earn a berth in the
tournament for the first time in 11
years under first-year head coach
Mark Plakorus.

They will face a tough test
against Stanford (19-0-1), which is
playing in its 14th consecutive
NCAA Tournament and has played
in three consecutive College Cups,
losing two straight years in the na
tional championship game.

As the host of the Stanford Re
gional, the Cardinal would take on
the winner of Texas and South Car-
olina in the second round if it can
defeat Montana. In order to reach
the College Cup, however, Stanford
has to get past some very formida
ble opponents No. 2 seed Okla
homa State, defending champion
Notre Dame and Maryland all po
tentially stand in the Cardinal's

path.The Fighting Irish knocked off
Stanford last year in the final, and
the Terrapins were responsible for
the only blemish on coach Paul
Ratcliffe's record this season, a 0-0
tie on Aug. 26.
The 30th Women's College Cup
will be hosted by Kennesaw State in
Kennesaw, Ga. The semifinals will
