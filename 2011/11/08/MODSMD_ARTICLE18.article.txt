The No. 4 Stanford men's
water polo team maintained its
fourth-place spot in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
standings with two conference
wins this weekend. The Cardinal
defeated Long Beach State 11-3
on Saturday and UC-Irvine 14-7
on Sunday.

Sunday's game was a pre
dictably high-scoring affair, as No.
6 UC-Irvine is third in the MPSF
in goals scored but has allowed the
second-most goals of any confer
ence team.

Early on, Irvine (14-10, 2-5
MPSF) looked like it would be a
tough test. The Anteaters scored
the first two goals of the game be
fore a pair of goals by redshirt
sophomore 2-meter Forrest
Watkins tied the score at 2-2. A big
second period put Stanford (16-4,
5-2) ahead, though, as it scored
five goals in the frame to take a 7-
4 halftime lead.
Stanford's second-ranked de

fense took over in the second half,
turning the game into the team's
second rout of the weekend. A 5-0
run in the second half put the Car
dinal ahead 12-5, and the game
was out of reach by then. Redshirt
senior goalie Brian Pingree led
the defense with 11 saves against
the shot-happy Irvine team.
"We did a pretty good job of
shot-blocking on the outside,
which made it easier for Pingree,"
Watkins said.
Senior driver Jacob Smith led
the team with three goals. Red
shirt senior driver Ryan Kent,
junior driver Paul Rudolph, red
shirt sophomore driver Austin
Trinkle and Watkins followed
with two goals apiece. Freshman
utility Alex Bowen, redshirt soph
omore driver lan Gamble and
redshirt junior driver Travis Noll
added one goal each.
On Saturday the Cardinal took
care of No. 7 Long Beach State in a
game that was close for much of
the first three quarters. Although
the final score was a gaping 11-3,
Stanford led just 4-2 at halftime.
Goals by Watkins, Noll and Smith
jump-started Stanford to a 3-0
lead, but a couple of second-quar
ter goals and an early third-quar
ter goal brought the 49ers within
one at 4-3.

Yet again, though, a dominant
defensive effort helped Stanford
pull away significantly in the sec
ond half. The Cardinal went on a
7-0 run to end the game, shutting
out Long Beach State for the last
15:16 of the contest.

Pingree had to make only five
saves because of the strong defen
sive play by the position players.
Watkins attributed a lot of that to
Long Beach State's style of play.
"They were working the set a
lot harder, so we got more rejec
tions and steals," Watkins said.
The three goals by Long Beach
State are the fewest Stanford has
allowed against any MPSF oppo
nent.
Bowen led the way with a hat
trick, while Rudolph, senior utili
ty Peter Sefton and Watkins had
two goals apiece. Noll and Smith
each added a goal.
Stanford hosts two games
against non-conference oppo
nents next weekend, No. 14 Santa
Clara on Saturday and No. 12 UC-
Davis on Sunday. A second week
end in a row with Saturday and
Sunday games should help the
team prepare for the MPSF Tour
nament.
