# All you need is some dedication

### Tom Taylor 
If there is one thing that is guar
anteed when I devote my col
umn to football, it is that I will
get email abuse for daring to
tarnish this hallowed game with
my foreign ideas. True to form, I re
ceived the short yet delightfully gram
matically flawed message "You'reani
diot" in response to last week's
thoughts on my experience of Stan
ford at USC.
Happily, I also got a few more sup
portive comments, ranging from sim
ple appreciation to convincing argu
ments for why Stanford will beat Ore
gon on Saturday, but the consistent
complaints raise a question. When can
I cease being an outsider and call my
self a bona fide football fan?
Now before we get any further, I
should stress something which my
haters don't seem to recognize that
this is an opinion column and not a
journalistically unbiased and well-re -
searched article. That's why I get to
write about anything, and it means
while you might disagree with me,
that's just your opinion. I don't write
this as a journalist; I write it as a gener
al sports fan, and when it comes to col
lege football, yes, as one of you.
I cannot claim that I have, or ever
will have, the sort of all-encompassing
football knowledge that comes from
growing up living and breathing the
sport. As a consequence of my nation
ality, it can also never take first place in
my sports passions. The first entire
game I ever watched was in my mid
20s, and even that was done with a
healthy dose of suspicion about what
seemed to me to be just rugby with
pads on. But fast-forward a few years
and I spent last Saturday glued to the
TV first watching Stanford against
Oregon State, then flipping back and
forth between the top-of-the-rank
ings clash between LSU and Alabama
and the crucial for Stanford's na
tional title aspirations Kansas
State vs. Oklahoma State game.
My awareness of football history
and statistics is full of gaping holes,
and hardly a game goes by without
confusion over at least one of the reg
ulations though some much more
qualified individuals might deserve
that same accusation but my inter
est has been caught enough that I
dragged myself down to LA for the
USC game. The Stanford football
team is no longer "it" to me; it is "we,"
and I certainly feel like a fan.
I didn't start life following domes
tic soccer closely, but I remember
watching my local team, Reading
F.C., play and lose a crucial game in
1995 that could have elevated it to the
English Premier League. Somehow,
that game and the ensuing slide that
soon after relegated the team further
down the league system were a trig
ger, and somewhere in the interven
ing years I crossed the line between
interest and devotion. I now carry my
Reading F.C. membership card as one
of my principle forms of ID, right next
to the team's season fixture list that
acts as light reading whenever I get
bored.

And I've now found myself doing
the same with Stanford; next to my
university ID card sits the football
game schedule.
The Cardinal is occupying both
my Saturday free time and my mid
week conversations. With any interest
naturally comes some sort of opinion
if you like something, you'll proba
bly have a reason why and if it mat

ters to you, it's hard to say your view
doesn't count. I'm aware of my limita
tions, but I like to think the best way to
learn from the more qualified fans is
not just to sit back and accept whatev
er they tell me. Instead, it is to ask
questions, both incisive and basic
because if you don't know the answer
there is no such thing as a dumb ques
tion â€” and sometimes to challenge
their point of view from an outsider's
perspective. In fact, sometimes you
simply can't see the wood through the
trees; the views and thoughts of the
Americans I've met over here have
certainly had a positive impact on
how I think about soccer.

When it comes to being a fan,
nothing qualifies you more than the
simple act of pledging allegiance to
your team. Though it helps, you don't
need an all-encompassing knowledge
of the sport, and you don't even need
to have attended the college in ques
tion or lived near the stadium. You
just need to have found some connec
tion that binds you to the rest of us.
This is My House now.

Tom Taylor bleeds Cardinal red, and
he'll make sure you do too if you
challenge his fandom. Find out just
