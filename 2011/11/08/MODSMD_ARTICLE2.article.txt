# Palo Alto goes to the polls
## City votes today on Measures D and E, binding arbitration and compost facility 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
Palo Alto citizens will vote
today not on national, state or
local officials, but on two commu
nity issues that have inspired sim
ilar amounts of political debate.
Measures D and E will take cen
ter stage on the Palo Alto ballot,
after a recent decision by the
local legislature to move city
council elections to even num
bered years to save money.
Measure D would repeal the
use of a third-party arbitrator to
settle disputes between public
safety workers and management.
Measure E would un-dedicate 10

of Byxbee Park's 127 acres, with
the hopes of building a compost
facility on the land to process
sewage and food waste.
The debate surrounding Mea
sure D is centered on the city's
ability to control matters such as
pensions and benefits for work
ers. While an arbitrator has his
torically been used to ensure ap
propriate treatment of the city's
public safety workers, particular
ly firemen, proponents of Mea
sure D argue that this value will
still be upheld without reaching
out to a third party.

Palo Alto voters will take to the polls today to decide on Measures D and E. Absentee ballot numbers, with 8,000
submitted before the weekend, suggest strong voterturnout, according to former Palo Alto mayor Peter Drekmeier.
"My opinion is that we absolute
ly need Measure D that city
council needs to be able to control
the costs," said Councilman Greg
Scharff. "Measure D is absolutely
vital to the community ... It would
create a more harmonious relation
ship between the fire department
and the city."
Scharff said he believes that
binding arbitration in the city char
ter causes more harm than good,
and that Palo Alto would benefit
greatly if Measure D passes. He es
timated the total funding tally of
Measure D supporters at $20,000,
compared to an estimated $70,000
to $BO,OOO funded by opponents of
the measure.
The "No on D" committee writes
on its website that the city council
should "reform binding arbitration
rather than repeal it."
The issue of binding arbitration
has the potential to influence Stan
ford's funds as well, some of which
are allocated to payroll and equip
ment costs for firefighters.
The debate over Measure E has
been equally lively.
"Measure E provides a great op
portunity," said former Palo Alto
mayor Peter Drekmeier. "It doesn't
commit the city to building a facility.
It doesn't determine what technolo
gy would be used. But it allows us to
take the next step, which is a thor
ough study of the different possibil
ities."
Drekmeier explained that wet
anaerobic digestion has the poten
tial to save billions of dollars, gener

ate renewable energy and reduce
greenhouse gases. The Palo Alto
Green Energy and Compost Initia
tive has spent the past few days dis
tributing a flyer to voters, clarifying
benefits of Measure E. Proponents
of Measure E have raised just under
$30,000, according to Drekmeier.
"It's premature to take parkland
when you don't know what's going
to go on it," said former city council
woman Emily Renzel. "You don't
go and un-dedicate parkland for fu
ture studies ... We don't know the
impacts of it. We don't know the
costs of it. We don't know the feasi
bility of it."
Every voter household in Palo
Alto has received a flyer warning of
the potential difficulties of Measure
E, according to Renzel. She report
ed that the Committee for No on
Measure E raised just over $17,000,
none of which was donated by de
velopers.

With these two issues on the
ballot, even without city council
elections, Palo Alto might still see
a large voter turnout. Out of the
71 percent of voting citizens who
arrange for absentee ballots,
8,000 were reported to have
turned in their ballots before the
weekend, according to Drekmeier
and Renzel.

"There are only two items on the
ballot, Measure D and Measure E,
and if people feel interested
enough in one or both of those is
sues, they'll vote. Otherwise, it will
be a lower voter turnout," Drek
meier said. "But the absentee, the
vote-by-mail turnout, has really
been quite high, so that suggests
that there is interest."
