# Palo Alto goes to the polls
## City votes today on Measures D and E, binding arbitration and compost facility 
### JORDAN SHAPIRO 
Palo Alto citizens will vote
today not on national, state or
local officials, but on two commu
nity issues that have inspired sim
ilar amounts of political debate.
Measures D and E will take cen
ter stage on the Palo Alto ballot,
after a recent decision by the
local legislature to move city
council elections to even num
bered years to save money.
Measure D would repeal the
use of a third-party arbitrator to
settle disputes between public
safety workers and management.
Measure E would un-dedicate 10

of Byxbee Park's 127 acres, with
the hopes of building a compost
facility on the land to process
sewage and food waste.
The debate surrounding Mea
sure D is centered on the city's
ability to control matters such as
pensions and benefits for work
ers. While an arbitrator has his
torically been used to ensure ap
propriate treatment of the city's
public safety workers, particular
ly firemen, proponents of Mea
sure D argue that this value will
still be upheld without reaching
out to a third party.
