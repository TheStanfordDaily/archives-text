# QUICK RESPONSE
## Card follows home loss with easy wins 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There's nothing like a couple of
bounce-back wins to ease the pain
of a home loss. After a promising
weekend ended with a disappoint
ing defeat to UCLA, the Stanford
women's volleyball team traveled
east to take its anger out on Col
orado and Utah.

Up first for the No. 3 Cardinal
(19-4, 13-4 Pac-12) were the Buf
faloes (5-20, 0-17) on Thursday in
Colorado. Early on, the Card
looked more like the team that had
lost to UCLA rather than the one
that had won nine straight matches
beforehand. Colorado jumped out
to a quick 10-5 lead, prompting
Stanford head coach John Dun
ning to take a timeout. Still, attack
ing errors held the Card back as it
kept an overachieving Colorado
team in the game. Stanford man
aged to claw its way back, tying the
game at 23 points apiece. A pair of
blocks by junior outside hitter
Hayley Spelman and sophomore

outside hitter Rachel Williams
gave the Card the first set 25-23
and a much-needed breath of
fresh air.

Following the close first set,
Stanford let its guard down in the
second, playing uncharacteristical
ly poor volleyball for a top-five
team. Maybe it was the high alti
tude (5,345 feet), but Stanford did
not look like a national champi
onship contender in that set. Col
orado outlasted the Card in a close
affair that featured 10 ties, winning
25-22.

Dropping a set to the last-place
Buffs may have been a wakeup
call, as Stanford was a completely
different team for the rest of the
weekend. The Cardinal went on to
dismantle Colorado, winning the
third set 25-21. The offensive at
tack smothered the Buffs in the
fourth as well, taking the match
with an easy 25-15 win.
Leading the way for the Cardi
nal was the sophomore duo of
Williams and middle blocker Carly
Wopat. The pair combined for 27
kills and 10 blocks, which is nothing
new, as Williams leads the team in
kills and Wopat leads the team in
blocks. Colorado, like most of
Stanford's opponents this year, was
simply overwhelmed by the domi
nant frontcourt.
Stanford carried its momentum
from Boulder into its match
against the Utes (9-17, 4-13) on
Saturday. After trailing early, the
Cardinal took a 5-4 lead behind
three Utah errors. It didn't look
back, holding on to the lead for the
remainder of the first set. Sopho

more outside hitter Sam Wopat
clinched the set with a kill, giving
Stanford a 25-18 first-set victory.
It was the same story for Stan
ford in the second set, as a Utah
service error broke a 4-4 tie. The
Cardinal did not relinquish this
lead, going on to win the second set
25-22 behind Williams' seven kills.
Stanford headed into the third
set with its sights set on a sweep.
This looked all but sealed with an
18-14 lead, until Utah managed to
score three points in a row, forcing
Stanford to call a timeout. Whatev
er was said in that huddle clearly
had quite the effect, as Stanford
proceeded to bury the Utes, allow
ing them only one more point in a
25-18 third-set victory.

Junior setter Karissa Cook
came up big once again, posting 36
of Stanford's 44 total assists. She
also led the team in digs with 14.
Wopat and Williams once again led
a balanced offensive attack, but
they received a lot of help from
redshirt freshman outside hitter
Lydia Bai. The trio had 12,10 and
nine kills respectively, managing to
keep the Utes on their heels.
Currently tied for fourth in the
Pac-12 with rival California, Stan
ford needs to continue looking for
ward. The Card is currently two
games out of first place with five
matches remaining in the regular
season. With the season winding
down, Stanford hits the road again
this weekend to take on Washing
ton and Washington State.
