# NEWS BRIEF
## Stanford, Palo Alto pipeline includes salvaged pipe 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
(PG&E) documents have shown
that a gas transmission line running
through Stanford's campus and Palo
Alto contains at least 22 feet of sal
vaged pipe dating back to 1947.

The announcement touched a
nerve following the Sept. 2011 San

A Jan. 1,1957, construction draw
ing indicated that Line 132, the same
pipeline as the San Bruno incident,
was relocated along Page Mill Road
between Junipero Serra Boulevard
and El Camino Real. Transmission
pipe was salvaged from the reloca
tion, but its next use remains unclear,
along with whether salvaged pipe
was reconditioned before use in sev
eral cases.

The documents suggest that most
salvaged and reused pipe was used
on Lines 131 and 132, near Morgan
Hill and San Bruno. The Morgan Hill
pipe, however, was taken out of com
mission in 1970, and its pipe was sal-
