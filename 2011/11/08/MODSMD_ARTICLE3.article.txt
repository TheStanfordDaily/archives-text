# NEWS BRIEF
## Stanford, Palo Alto pipeline includes salvaged pipe 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Margaret Rawson 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
(PG&E) documents have shown
that a gas transmission line running
through Stanford's campus and Palo
Alto contains at least 22 feet of sal
vaged pipe dating back to 1947.

The announcement touched a
nerve following the Sept. 2011 San
Bruno incident that killed eight peo
ple when a 30-inch-diameter natural
gas pipeline on Line 132 owned by
PG&E exploded out of the ground
in flames.

California Public Utilities Com
mission (CPUC) lawyers accused
PG&E in an Oct. 19 filing of know
ing about faulty seams dating back to
1948 and practicing reckless use of
salvaged, reused pipe.

In an Oct. 20 response to CPUC's
filing, PG&E confirmed that the 22
feet of salvaged pipe does date back
to 1947. The company said it would
be hydro-testing this section of pipe
this year.

The exact amount of reused and
salvaged pipe is difficult to deter
mine based on the series of docu
ments recording the company's ren
ovations over the past half-century.
A Jan. 1,1957, construction draw
ing indicated that Line 132, the same
pipeline as the San Bruno incident,
was relocated along Page Mill Road
between Junipero Serra Boulevard
and El Camino Real. Transmission
pipe was salvaged from the reloca
tion, but its next use remains unclear,
along with whether salvaged pipe
was reconditioned before use in sev
eral cases.

The documents suggest that most
salvaged and reused pipe was used
on Lines 131 and 132, near Morgan
Hill and San Bruno. The Morgan Hill
pipe, however, was taken out of com
mission in 1970, and its pipe was sal-
vaged and reused in Milpitas.
On Friday, PG&E announced
that it found a leak during hydro
testing of pipe near Palo Alto. The
company did not clarify whether the
leak is located in the reused section

of the pipeline.
On Sunday, a pipeline in Wood
side, Calif., burst while PG&E was
conducting hydro-testing in the re
gion. The section of pipe that rup
tured was on Line 132. No injuries
were reported, while one vehicle
was damaged by the spray of dirt
and rocks resulting from the rup
ture.
