## Med School unveils CAP Network Professional networking site fosters research collaboration 
### SHELLEY XU 
Stanford's School of Medicine expanded its
social networking this fall and launched the
Community Academic Profiles Network (CAP
Network), a private, internal social-networking
service designed specifically for the medical

community at Stanford, including students, fac
ulty and staff members.
The recent launch of CAP Network has inte
grated the already running profile system, Com
munity Academic Profiles, with a social net
working platform.
According to Michael Halaas, chief technol
ogy officer at the Information Resources &
Technology (IRT) Web and Systems Engineer
ing Department, CAP Network includes pro
files with everything from an individual's photo
and contact information to a listing of his or her

publications and work experience. On a more
interactive level, CAP Network users can post
statuses and form groups.

"The reason why we're in this experiment is
because we look at the world around us and we
see how social network technologies are chang
ing," said Henry Lowe, senior associate dean for
IRT. "And we see huge potential in an academ
ic setting for enhancing collaboration and com
munication across the community."
One unique feature of CAP Net
work is what is called "similarity
matching," in which the network
analyzes the publications of one
member and produces the top 10
people on CAP Network with simi
lar publications in order to facilitate
collaboration on anything from re
search projects to presentations.
Additionally, users can form private
groups to upload documents and
share images and websites.
The ultimate goal, according to
administrators, is for CAP Network
to foster more collaboration.

"This is a platform that allows for
very rapid, very transparent collabo
rating," Halaas said. "The hope is
that it provides collaboration in new
ways ... and through that we fur
ther our science and patient care."
The initial response to CAP Net
work's launch has been mostly pos
itive. According to Lowe, there are
now 10,000 profiles on the network.
Following this trend, the main

objective for the foreseeable future
will be to raise awareness of the net
work, according to Halaas.
"We intentionally wanted to get
something in a reasonably fast
framework, get it out in the commu
nity and then hear what the com
munity wants and go from there,"
Halaas said.
Lowe noted certain expectations
for use of the network.
"We anticipate lots of things that
happen on email now will happen on
this platform," he said.
For now, CAP Network includes
only Stanford community members,
with the recent addition of staff mem
bers. But expansion is a possibility,
Lowe said.
"Our goal is to incrementally ex
pand the community that participates
in CAP," Lowe said. He added that he
likes to see more of the larger Univer
sity community collaborating.
The network has many possibili
ties for expanded use, including in
creased ties with Stanford Hospital &
Clinics. Though the hospital has al
ready used the profile portion of
CAP to help find doctors, the net
work may lead to increased use.
"We're definitely looking at

adapting and integrating it," said
Chris Furmanski, director of market
ing technology and innovation at the
hospital.
Creating CAP Network was a
process that took many months, ac
cording to Halaas and Lowe. The
team behind the network partnered
with salesforce.com for much of the
technology and integrated tightly
with CAP itself for many of the social

networking features.
Flammering out privacy agree
ments also took time, according to
Halaas.

"We've gone to extensive lengths
to ensure security and privacy," Ha
laas said. "Every user has control over
where their information goes. We
spent a great deal of time. We have
very rigorous agreements that it re
mains entirely in our control and that

it meets all the security standards that
are required."
Regardless of what form the net
work takes in the future, it has already
made an impact. "I've been pilot
ing it in my department for about six
months, and now I couldn't live with
out it," Halaas said.
