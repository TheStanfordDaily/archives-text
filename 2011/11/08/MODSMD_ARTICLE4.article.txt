## Med School unveils CAP Network Professional networking site fosters research collaboration 
### SHELLEY XU 
Stanford's School of Medicine expanded its
social networking this fall and launched the
Community Academic Profiles Network (CAP
Network), a private, internal social-networking
service designed specifically for the medical

community at Stanford, including students, fac
ulty and staff members.
The recent launch of CAP Network has inte
grated the already running profile system, Com
munity Academic Profiles, with a social net
working platform.
According to Michael Halaas, chief technol
ogy officer at the Information Resources &
Technology (IRT) Web and Systems Engineer
ing Department, CAP Network includes pro
files with everything from an individual's photo
and contact information to a listing of his or her

publications and work experience. On a more
interactive level, CAP Network users can post
statuses and form groups.

"The reason why we're in this experiment is
because we look at the world around us and we
see how social network technologies are chang
ing," said Henry Lowe, senior associate dean for
IRT. "And we see huge potential in an academ
ic setting for enhancing collaboration and com
munication across the community."
