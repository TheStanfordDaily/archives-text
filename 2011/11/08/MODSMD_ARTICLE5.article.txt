## Breakthrough in cancer research Relative's breast cancer gene may not put women at higher risk 
### MELODY WONG 
According to a recent Stanford study, simply
being a close relative of a woman with a genetic mu
tation of the BRCA gene does not place a woman at
a higher risk for getting breast cancer.
This new research, published last Monday in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology, contradicts the findings
of a 2007 study that claimed otherwise, suggesting
women with a family history of the BRCAI or
BRCA2 mutation were more likely to develop breast
cancer than the average woman, even if they tested
negative for the mutation.

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer
among females in the United States, with roughly
230,000 new diagnoses of invasive breast cancer each
year, according to the American Cancer Society.
Men, on the other hand, have a one in 1,000 risk of de

According to BreastCancer.org, while predicted
deaths caused by breast cancer have declined since
1999 by 2 percent, this trend has only been seen in
