## Breakthrough in cancer research Relative's breast cancer gene may not put women at higher risk 
### MELODY WONG 
According to a recent Stanford study, simply
being a close relative of a woman with a genetic mu
tation of the BRCA gene does not place a woman at
a higher risk for getting breast cancer.
This new research, published last Monday in the
Journal of Clinical Oncology, contradicts the findings
of a 2007 study that claimed otherwise, suggesting
women with a family history of the BRCAI or
BRCA2 mutation were more likely to develop breast
cancer than the average woman, even if they tested
negative for the mutation.

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer
among females in the United States, with roughly
230,000 new diagnoses of invasive breast cancer each
year, according to the American Cancer Society.
Men, on the other hand, have a one in 1,000 risk of de
veloping breast cancer over the course of a lifetime.
According to BreastCancer.org, while predicted
deaths caused by breast cancer have declined since
1999 by 2 percent, this trend has only been seen in
women over the age of 50. On aver
age, 40,000 women die from breast
cancer each year.
The average woman in the Unit
ed States has a 12 percent chance of
developing invasive breast cancer in
her lifetime, meaning one in every
eight women in the United States
will be affected by breast cancer, ac
cording to BreastCancer.org. While
about five to 10 percent of breast
cancer cases are genetic, most of
these are caused by abnormalities in
the BRCA genes. Women with these
mutations have up to an 80 percent
increased chance of developing
breast cancer, and as such, must take
necessary precautions. Several op
tions involve intensive annual
screenings at an earlier age, taking
the drug tamoxifen to prevent
breast cancer or even undergoing a
double mastectomy to diminish the
risk before cancer can develop.
However, most women discover
the mutation after they have been
diagnosed with cancer.
Close female relatives may choose
to test for the mutation if someone
in their family has tested positive.
The 2007 study, published in the
Journal of Medical Genetics, pro
posed that women who did not have
the mutation but whose mother or
sister did had up to a five-fold high
er risk of developing breast cancer.
As expected, these findings caused
some anxiety among oncologists
and patients.
As a result, the recent discovery
brings great comfort to women from

high-risk families. "These findings
put a lot of concerns to rest," said Dr.
Allison Kurian, assistant professor
of medicine in oncology and health
research and policy at Stanford
Medical Center and author of the
study.

Kurian studies breast cancer
risks and prevention at the Stanford
Medical Center.

Shortly after the publication of
the unsettling 2007 paper, Kurian
and her team put together an exper
iment to challenge the claims.
They studied more than 3,000
families with the BRCAI or
BRCA2 mutations from the United
States, Canada and Australia and
compared breast cancer rates be
tween a control group of non-carri
ers of the BRCA mutation who had
a first-degree relative with breast
cancer and carriers of the mutated
gene with first-degree relatives with
breast cancer.

From this data, the study con
cluded that "if a woman tests nega
tive for a BRCA mutation in her
family, she does not have a signifi
cantly elevated risk of developing
breast cancer."

While both studies compared the
risk of developing breast cancer in
families with a history of the BCRA
mutation, the study released in 2007
analyzed 277 British families with
the BRCA mutation.

Kurian said she believed that the
discrepancy between the two studies
could be attributed to the fact that
women in the first study were
screened more often for breast can
cer, and as such, more cases were
found.
