## Journalist talks climate, politics 
### JULIA ENTHOVEN 
In a presentation titled "Climate Change
and the 2012 Election: The New Wedge Issue?"
Washington Post journalist Juliet Eilperin re
marked Monday that she used to believe that
the environment held little political weight.
"I actually think this is a really interesting
moment," she said, "It is a moment that is chal
lenging a position I've held for a long time,
which is that the environment doesn't play a
role in elections."

Eilperin spoke Monday to an audience of
around 50 about the intersection of environ
mentalism and politics in a forum hosted by the
Woods Institute for the Environment in the
Hartley Conference Center. She particularly
touched on climate change denial by current
Republican presidential candidates.
As an author, journalist and academic,
Eilperin has become an expert in environmen
tal policy. During her first year as a journalist
for The Washington Post, she pro
duced over 200 articles, becoming
the newspaper's most prolific writer.
In the spring of 2005, she became the
youngest ever McGraw professor at
Princeton, her alma mater, and con
tinued to report on presidential cam
paigns and primaries.
She fondly remembered her ex
periences while reporting on the en
vironment, including scuba diving
with sharks, trekking in the Arctic
and crawling through caves in pur
suit of rare insects.

In particular, Eilperin stressed
the importance of the 2012 election
for environmental politics.
Discussing differences between
the 2011 primaries and the 2008 pres
idential election, Eilperin said that
most of the current Republican can
didates have denied the connection
between human action and climate
change, while the candidates from
both sides of the 2008 campaign ac
cepted mainstream scientific con
sensus.

"Because John McCain became
the nominee," Eilperin said, "[cli
mate change] really was not an issue
in the general election ... Both
major candidates endorsed manda
tory regulations, including deep cuts
in greenhouse gases by 2050."
Eilperin cited quotes showing
that candidates Michele Bachmann,
Rick Perry, Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich
and Herman Cain have all openly
dismissed the existence of climate
change or the connection between
human action and global climate
change. Even Mitt Romney, who has

before said "the world is getting
warmer... [and] I believe humans
contribute to that," recently reversed
his opinion to "we don't know what
is causing climate change on this
planet," Eilperin noted.

"Half the freshman class in the
Republican party [is] on record
denying the connection between
human activity and climate change,"
Eilperin said. "Among conservative
Republicans ... skepticism is rising.
Seventy-five percent of staunch con
servatives say there is no solid evi
dence that climate change is even oc
curring."
Eilperin discussed how environ
mental policy has gained consider
able weight, but its impact is difficult
to predict.
"This has the potential to become
a wedge issue," she said. "What is so
interesting is whether it will be a
wedge issue for the left or a wedge
issue for a right."
Eilperin said that this represents
a significant change from the past.

"I have never seen an election
where I felt like the environmental
issue was a huge wedge issue for vot
ers," she said.
Eilperin said she believes that the
advantage lies with the left.
"If you contrast [the GOP's opin
ion] with the general electorate, at
least if you look at straight polls, they
show... support for someone who
addresses global warming," she said.
"For Democrats and independ
ents, you have more to gain by adver
tising this idea that you would ad
dress climate change," Eilperin said.
"It is significantly more of an asset
than a liability for a presidential can
didate."
