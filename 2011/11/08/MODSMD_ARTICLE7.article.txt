## San Mateo postpones Alpine Trail decision once again

ford's offer twice before, and the debate
about whether the offer should be accepted

"It's a really complex, long-standing,
three-party issue, and it has been going on for
a long time," Groom said. "Supervisors have
come and gone in both San Mateo County
and Santa Clara County, so there have been
different ideas and different perspectives."
The three additional options that Stan
ford will prepare to look into are ending the
trail at Piers Lane, where there is already an
existing and damaged trail; having the trail
cross over Alpine Road and hug the other
side, then cross back over at the end of
Weekend Acres; and building a trail cross-
