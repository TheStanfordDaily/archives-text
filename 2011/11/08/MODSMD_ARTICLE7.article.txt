## San Mateo postpones Alpine Trail decision once again 
### ILEANA NAJARRO 
San Mateo County supervisors voted 4-1
last Tuesday to postpone the decision of
whether to accept Stanford's proposal to re
pair a portion of the Alpine Trail, opting in
stead to ask Stanford to consider three addi
tional alternatives and conduct an environ
mental review before the next board meeting
on Dec. 13.

If the San Mateo County Board of Super
visors does not accept Stanford's $10.4 mil
lion offer toward renovation of the trail by
Dec. 31, then the money will to go to Santa
Clara County for recreational facilities.
San Mateo Board Supervisor Carole
Groom said the topic will not be discussed
further until Dec. 13 because Stanford must
prepare to assess the three alternatives pro
posed at last week's meeting, which would
bring the total number of alternatives stud

ied by the University in its proposal to six.
San Mateo County has declined Stan
ford's offer twice before, and the debate
about whether the offer should be accepted
and how the funds would be used dates back
to 2006.
"It's a really complex, long-standing,
three-party issue, and it has been going on for
a long time," Groom said. "Supervisors have
come and gone in both San Mateo County
and Santa Clara County, so there have been
different ideas and different perspectives."
The three additional options that Stan
ford will prepare to look into are ending the
trail at Piers Lane, where there is already an
existing and damaged trail; having the trail
cross over Alpine Road and hug the other
side, then cross back over at the end of
Weekend Acres; and building a trail cross-

ing over Alpine Road, which
would go over the hill and then
cross back, according to medical
school professor Dr. RJ. Utz, who
attended the meeting. Supervisor
David Pine proposed the three ad
ditional alternatives.

If the offer is accepted and the
position of the trail falls within un
incorporated San Mateo County
land and other plots designated in
the original agreement between
Santa Clara County and Stanford,
the University will fund the re
views. If, however, the land chosen
is different from the original agree
ment, San Mateo County will pay
for the environmental review and
outside expert analysis, giving the
county full control of the study.
Larry Horton, Stanford senior
associate vice president and direc
tor of government and community
relations, said that Stanford will be
preparing as well as it can until the
next board meeting, since the exact
locations of the new options have
not yet been identified.
"We would have to agree on al

ternative wording that would be
satisfactory to both parties," Hor
ton said.

Utz said that if the county were
likely to get an extension on the
final decision, these additional
three propositions would have to
change.
Strongly voiced positions by
community residents on both sides
directly affected by the current trail
have contributed to drawing out
the debate.

"This is not one where you can
make a decision and make every
body happy," Horton said.

The communities of Ledara and
Portola Valley support the decision
to accept the offer, while residents
of Stanford Weekend Acres repre
sent the opposition.
Chris Rubin, a resident of Stan
ford Weekend Acres, said that not
all of his community is actually in
opposition.

"I think there's a select few
members from Stanford Weekend
Acres who are extremely vocal in
their opinions against the trail, and
I think that the Board of Supervi
sors is trying to accommodate those
people," Rubin said. "But unfortu
nately I'm not convinced that it's
necessarily representative of the
majority of people it would bene

ht."
Both sides use safety as a major
consideration in defending their
position. For Stanford Weekend
Acres residents like Sarah Dißoise,
much of the concern is related to
entry and exit into the community.

"I understand there are issues
about safety on the ingress and
egress from Weekend Acres onto
Alpine Road, and that is a busy
road and those are legitimate con
cerns," Dißoise said. "I think that's
part of why the trail is so unsafe
today."

Both Rubin and Dißoise said
that even the overall current condi
tion of the trail needs attention. Ac
cording to Dißoise, the trail is bare
ly navigable on foot, forcing walk
ers to stick close to bushes and put
ting them at risk of on-coming traf
fic. For Rubin, who bikes to work
every day, the trail's current state
poses a great risk, as the trail is even
less suitable for bikes.
"I think it would be a wonderful
resource for the whole community
if we could have a continuous trail
that went from Menlo Park all the
way into Portola Valley and it
was safe," Dißoise said.

cross back, according to medical
school professor Dr. RJ. Utz, who
attended the meeting. Supervisor
David Pine proposed the three ad
ditional alternatives.

If the offer is accepted and the
position of the trail falls within un
incorporated San Mateo County
land and other plots designated in
the original agreement between
Santa Clara County and Stanford,
the University will fund the re
views. If, however, the land chosen
is different from the original agree
ment, San Mateo County will pay
for the environmental review and
outside expert analysis, giving the
county full control of the study.
Larry Horton, Stanford senior
associate vice president and direc
tor of government and community
relations, said that Stanford will be
preparing as well as it can until the
next board meeting, since the exact
locations of the new options have
not yet been identified.
"We would have to agree on al

ternative wording that would be
satisfactory to both parties," Hor
ton said.

Utz said that if the county were
likely to get an extension on the
final decision, these additional
three propositions would have to
change.
Strongly voiced positions by
community residents on both sides
directly affected by the current trail
have contributed to drawing out
the debate.

"This is not one where you can
make a decision and make every
body happy," Horton said.

The communities of Ledara and
Portola Valley support the decision
to accept the offer, while residents
of Stanford Weekend Acres repre
sent the opposition.
Chris Rubin, a resident of Stan
ford Weekend Acres, said that not
all of his community is actually in
opposition.

"I think there's a select few
members from Stanford Weekend
Acres who are extremely vocal in
their opinions against the trail, and
I think that the Board of Supervi
sors is trying to accommodate those
people," Rubin said. "But unfortu
nately I'm not convinced that it's
necessarily representative of the
majority of people it would bene

ht."
Both sides use safety as a major
consideration in defending their
position. For Stanford Weekend
Acres residents like Sarah Dißoise,
much of the concern is related to
entry and exit into the community.

"I understand there are issues
about safety on the ingress and
egress from Weekend Acres onto
Alpine Road, and that is a busy
road and those are legitimate con
cerns," Dißoise said. "I think that's
part of why the trail is so unsafe
today."

Both Rubin and Dißoise said
that even the overall current condi
tion of the trail needs attention. Ac
cording to Dißoise, the trail is bare
ly navigable on foot, forcing walk
ers to stick close to bushes and put
ting them at risk of on-coming traf
fic. For Rubin, who bikes to work
every day, the trail's current state
poses a great risk, as the trail is even
less suitable for bikes.
"I think it would be a wonderful
resource for the whole community
if we could have a continuous trail
that went from Menlo Park all the
way into Portola Valley and it
was safe," Dißoise said.
