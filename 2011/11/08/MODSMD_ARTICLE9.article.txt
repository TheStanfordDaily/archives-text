## Harvesting the Farm 
### LANAHO 
When it comes to
trees, Stanford
takes the cake. Its
tree community is
vast, from the icon
ic palms along Palm Drive to the il
lustrious unofficial mascot. But
Stanford also has dozens of edible
fruit trees tucked away in nearly
every corner of the Farm.
According to retired chief
groundskeeper Herb Fong, many of
these fruit trees on campus were in
tended for human consumption.
Fong spent 36 years planting, de
signing and maintaining the Stan
ford landscape. His long-term goal
during his time at Stanford included
planting as many trees and plants as
possible, including fruit trees, to
maintain Stanford's farm experi
ence. Fong chose trees that were
self-sustaining and wouldn't re
quire extensive maintenance.
"There are a good deal of stu
dents who come from the East
Coast or other parts of the world
that have never seen an orange tree
or an avocado tree or some of the
more exotic fruits and vegetables
that we have on campus," Fong said.
"It's kind of fun to provide an op
portunity for people to experience
those things."
Even before Fong arrived on
campus, several fruit trees were al
ready here. Leland Stanford want-

Ed to plant trees from all over the
world, and Jane Stanford desired
the campus to host biblical plants.
Born from their wishes were a vari
ety of trees across campus.
Pomegranate trees grow in Gov
ernor's Corner and in the islands of
the Inner Quad. Stanford's Avoca
do Courtyard is by Building 120.
These trees, tested by both time and
squirrels, have stood for over 100
years, even after being threatened
by construction in 1979. Citrus
Courtyard, located in the History
Corner, houses tangerine, kumquat,
blood orange and lemon trees. The
exotic fare includes a Buddha's
hand citrus tree, which has a yellow
fruit with bumpy tendrils. A straw
berry tree, bearing yellow ball
shaped fruits that turn red when
ripe, is at the Escondido Road cul
de-sac across from Meyer Library.
A pineapple guava bush grows be
hind Stern near the Munger Gradu
ate Residences. That plant is used
for hedging but provides ripe fruit
in the fall.

Other exotic plants on the Farm
include Japanese fuyu and hachiya
persimmons near Rains Houses
and behind the bookstore, respec
tively, pomelo in the entry court
yard of Toyon Hall and tangerines
by Florence Moore Hall.

Although they're supposed to
be low-maintenance trees, they
still need attention. So who takes
care of them? This is where Stan
ford Glean comes into play. Glean
is a service organization on cam
pus that harvests the fruit. Caitlin
Brown 'l2 and Susannah Poole
'll, inspired after taking environ
mental earth system science pro
fessor Page Chamberlain's intro

ductory seminar "Food & Com
munity," founded the group. The
picked fruit is donated to different
free food stands in the Bay Area.
Glean also finds and catalogues
the locations of the different fruit
trees using a user-edited Google
Map. The current co-presidents,
Tim Huang '14 and Jovel Queirolo
'14, continue the founders' mis
sion.

The group hosts two gleaning
trips every week, one on Thursday
mornings at 10 a.m. for seminar stu
dents, and one on Friday afternoons
at 4:15 p.m. open to everyone. Part
of their philosophy is to share the

fruit with everyone through their
work with free food stands and with
their on-campus harvesting trips.
"When you take the time to pick
your own fruit, it tastes better. It
tastes richer," Huang said.
From apple trees to pineapple
guava bushes, the Stanfords and
groundskeepers provided this cam
pus with a host of different edible
trees. Whether students are hungry,
charitable or just want a new taste
of campus, the University's many
trees are here to pick.
