Hamid & Christina Moghadam Program in
IRANIAN STUDIES
BAH RAM BEYZAIE is one of the most
talented, internationally acclaimed artists, scholars
and public intellectuals of his generation in Iran.
He has written more than thirty-five plays, and
fifty screenplays. Though a film-maker for over
forty years, and recognized as one of the masters
of Iran's much-celebrated new-wave of cinema, he
has been allowed to make only ten feature films
and four short films.
But Beyzaie is not just an artist but also a scholar.
His pioneering work on the history of Iranian
theater remains, some forty-years after its publica
tion, the most authoritative source on the subject.
His many monographs and essays have delved into
a comparative study of Iranian, Indian, Chinese and
Japanese performing art traditions. He has played
a critical role in the study of religious passion plays
in Iran and what they can offer modern theater.
He has just finished work on a lengthy manuscript
on the origins of AThousand and One Nights
story. He offers an altogether new interpretation
of the Indo-lranian origins of these remarkable
stories.
Beyzaie was born in Tehran, in December 1938. His
was a family of erudite poets and literary scholars,
and it did not take him long to realize that his was
to be a life in arts and aesthetics. He had a vora
cious appetite to read, learn and create. Myriad
discursive genres and performing arts became
the smithy for his unique alchemy of words and
images, history and myth, the mundane and the
sublime. His unique talents as an artist and his
singular accomplishments as a scholar eventually
combined to make him the Chair of the Dramatic
Arts Department at Tehran University, where he
helped train at least two generation of artists. Af
ter the Islamic Revolution in 1979, he was forced
to resign from the university. His unbending dedi
cation to his art and to the dignity of artists and
scholars, his unwillingness to allow ideological or
political forces deform his ideas and art, his defiant
desire to always speak truth to power have made
of him a maverick. His direction of his own play,
Marg Yazgerd (Death of Yazgard) remains today,
almost three decades later, one of the most memo
rable and acclaimed theatric performances of the
time. A film version of the play has also won much
acclaim.
Western audiences were first introduced to
Beyzaie's talents when two of his plays were per
formed at the Festival du Theater des Nations, in
Paris in 1963. Since then, many of his plays have
been performed in theaters around the world and
several of his films have won acclaim at important
film festivals. His works have been translated into
English, French, German, Portuguese, Turkish,
Kurdish and Arabic.
He is currently the Daryabari Visiting Professor of
Persian Letters at Stanford University. He lives in
Palo Alto with his wife, Mojdeh Shamsai, herself an
acclaimed actress, and their son Niassan.
