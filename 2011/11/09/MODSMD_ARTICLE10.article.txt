## Joe Paterno deserves to stay at PSU 
### Miles Bennett-Smith Jacoby is my Homeboy 
My dad is, without ques
tion, the smartest man I
know. And as the tidal
wave of scandal has
begun to break over
Penn State's football program, I want
ed to know how something of this mag
nitude could have been hidden so well
for so long. Naturally, I turned to him.
But for the first time, my dad was at
a loss for words. You see, he is a proud
Penn State alumnus and grew up just an
hour south of campus. Recently, he was
trying to put into perspective how im
pressive legendary coach Joe Paterno's
career wins record truly is.

JoePa took over as head coach of
the Nittany Lions in 1966. Yes, 1966. If I
remember correctly, that was when
"Batman" first premiered on televi
sion. And when Willy Mays signed the
richest contract in baseball history, for
$130,000 a year.
That was 44 years ago, when my dad
was about to turn 12. And since then, he
has won 409 games, an average of more
than seven games a year. Every. Single.
Year.

And all at the same place: the little
town of Happy Valley, Penn. Now that's
a streak unlike any other. Joe DiMag
gio may have hit in 56-straight games,
but he'd have to keep hitting for anoth
er 658 months to equal the time Pater
no has devoted to building a program
that is firmly cemented among the elite
in college football.
There are several great coaches in
the game today. From Boise State's
Chris Petersen to former Florida head
coach Urban Meyer, to LSU's Les

Miles or Alabama's Nick Saban. They
form the elite in the coaching ranks
today, and yet the closest of the bunch
to Patemo is Saban, with 142 wins.
Not too shabby; only 267 more to
go. If Saban can average 10 wins a year,
he could reach JoePa in 26 more years,
or the year2o3B, when Saban is a robust
86 years old. And that's //he can win 10
games a year, which is not exactly real
istic.
Miles would have to win 310 more,
putting him in the ballpark at age 90.
Meyer might be the big hope, since he
has just 340 wins to go before he reach
es the top. And in 34 years, he'll only be
81. But we saw him bum out at Florida
long before the wins stopped piling up
and the grumblings from alumni and
boosters grew louder and louder.
The record pales in comparison to
Joe Pa's legacy as a human being, how
ever. Fie and his wife Sue have long
been dedicated philanthropists and an
chors of the Penn State community.
While programs like USC and Alaba
ma and Auburn and Ohio State were
rocked time and again by allegations of
improper benefits and malfeasance by
athletes, JoePa had the reputation of
knowing how to win the right way.
He was revered around the country
as a demigod, particularly as he grew
older and people loved the little of ball
coach trudging around town with his
khaki pants rolled up at the cuff and his
trademark glasses.

And that's what makes Joe Pa's fall
from grace all the more tragic, because
for those of you who don't know, Pater
no is on the ropes at Penn State be
cause one of his former assistants, Jerry
Sundesky, is accused of molesting sev
eral young boys. And many think Pa
terno did not do enough to satisfy his
moral obligation to stand up and put a
stop to the abuse.
Never did my dad ever imagine he
would see the day when JoePa was
forced out of Happy Valley because of
an issue with his moral compass.
Maybe because the team was strug
gling to score, or because "Linebacker
U" was more like "Linebacker Who?"

I believe that Patemo ought to stay,
because he means that much to the
team and the university that he should
be the one to sort things out and unify
everything in the midst of this disaster.
And until all the facts come out, it
seems very unfair to blame him for
what he did not do when plenty of
other people had to have known what
he knew. (Incidentally, no one is ques
tioning Paterno's legal grounds be
cause he did report the alleged incident
to his bosses when he found about
them.)
But it will be sad to see the day when
JoePa is no longer roaming the side
lines, inspiring students and making
people like my dad remember why col
lege football was once the pinnacle of
athletic achievement.
Give'em hell, Joe.

putting him in the ballpark at age 90.
Meyer might be the big hope, since he
has just 340 wins to go before he reach
es the top. And in 34 years, he'll only be
81. But we saw him bum out at Florida
long before the wins stopped piling up
and the grumblings from alumni and
boosters grew louder and louder.
The record pales in comparison to
Joe Pa's legacy as a human being, how
ever. Fie and his wife Sue have long
been dedicated philanthropists and an
chors of the Penn State community.
While programs like USC and Alaba
ma and Auburn and Ohio State were
rocked time and again by allegations of
improper benefits and malfeasance by
athletes, JoePa had the reputation of
knowing how to win the right way.
He was revered around the country
as a demigod, particularly as he grew
older and people loved the little of ball
coach trudging around town with his
khaki pants rolled up at the cuff and his
trademark glasses.

And that's what makes Joe Pa's fall
from grace all the more tragic, because
for those of you who don't know, Pater
no is on the ropes at Penn State be
cause one of his former assistants, Jerry
Sundesky, is accused of molesting sev
eral young boys. And many think Pa
terno did not do enough to satisfy his
moral obligation to stand up and put a
stop to the abuse.
Never did my dad ever imagine he
would see the day when JoePa was
forced out of Happy Valley because of
an issue with his moral compass.
Maybe because the team was strug
gling to score, or because "Linebacker
U" was more like "Linebacker Who?"

I believe that Patemo ought to stay,
because he means that much to the
team and the university that he should
be the one to sort things out and unify
everything in the midst of this disaster.
And until all the facts come out, it
seems very unfair to blame him for
what he did not do when plenty of
other people had to have known what
he knew. (Incidentally, no one is ques
tioning Paterno's legal grounds be
cause he did report the alleged incident
to his bosses when he found about
them.)
But it will be sad to see the day when
JoePa is no longer roaming the side
lines, inspiring students and making
people like my dad remember why col
lege football was once the pinnacle of
athletic achievement.
Give'em hell, Joe.
