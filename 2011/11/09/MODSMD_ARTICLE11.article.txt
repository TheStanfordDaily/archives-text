# UNSUNG HERO
## 
### JORDAN BLOCH 
Nobody knew Terrence
Stephens was responsi
ble for the fumble, in
cluding Terrence
Stephens.
As the players celebrated their
thrilling triple-overtime victory over
USC on Oct. 29, the post-game pun
dits went to work. They praised quar
terback Andrew Luck for putting on
a Heisman-worthy performance,
pulling his head out of the sand after
a costly interception to engineer a
touchdown drive that forced over
time. They praised backup kicker
Eric Whitaker for nailing two field
goals and six extra points in his sea
son debut. And they praised line
backer A .J. Tarpley for his intercep
tion, forced fumble and, of course,
fumble recovery at the game's con
clusion.

But someone was left out of the
spotlight. A Cardinal player was re
sponsible for stripping the ball out of
USC running back Curtis McNeal's
hands. What about the hero who
made the play that essentially saved
the Cardinal's perfect season?
According to Stephens, the play
happened so quickly he had no idea
that hero was him. But he could've
cared less to find out.

As soon as Tarpley fell on the
loose ball in the end zone, Stephens
sprinted toward midfield with his
hands in the air, hugging every line
man, wideout and coach in sight. He
never once wondered whether the
celebration was due to his play.
It actually took a You Tube video,
two hours after the game, for
Stephens to find out officially. As the
team headed toward the airport,
Stephens received a video of the final
play of the game from his mom, a clip
that had already received multiple
page views.

At that moment, most players
would've jumped out of their bus seat

in personal exhilaration, immediate
ly sharing the news and showing the
video to surrounding teammates.
But that's not Terrence Stephens.
He doesn't care about personal glory.
He'd rather play the role of the
unsung hero.
"A win is a win, no matter how it
happens. Coach Mason and Coach
Tarver always say that it doesn't mat
ter how we win, it's that we put the
'W on the board," Stephens said.
"We just knew there was going to be
some way that we were going to do it,
and I'm honestly just glad that it hap
pened to be that way."
Stephens is one of those players
who radiates humility and selfless

ness, to the point where you know
he's not just being cliche. He deflect
ed every question about his play in
the USC game, responding with
some thought about the team in
stead.

"My play couldn't have happened
if a linebacker didn't stay in the hole,
or even the series before, if someone
didn't step up in the second overtime,
or if the offense didn't step up to the
plate and keep us in the game," he
said. "I think a lot of people will focus
on that one final play and that's great.
But at the end of the day, if our of
fense and defense didn't step up and
make plays, we wouldn't have been in
that position."

Stephens may not be the defen
sive player featured first on College
Game Day or called over for inter
views following victories. But he is a
team player through thick and thin.
And that's what being a member
of the Stanford Cardinal defense is all
about.

Stephens grew up in Gaithers
burg, Md., with no siblings and one
parent, his mother, Tracey Stephens.
According to Stephens, his mother
was his role model, the woman who
sowed the seeds of hard work, deter
mination and teamwork into his core.
"From a young age, my mom was
