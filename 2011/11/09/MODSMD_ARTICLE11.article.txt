# UNSUNG HERO
## 
### JORDAN BLOCH 
Nobody knew Terrence
Stephens was responsi
ble for the fumble, in
cluding Terrence
Stephens.
As the players celebrated their
thrilling triple-overtime victory over
USC on Oct. 29, the post-game pun
dits went to work. They praised quar
terback Andrew Luck for putting on
a Heisman-worthy performance,
pulling his head out of the sand after
a costly interception to engineer a
touchdown drive that forced over
time. They praised backup kicker
Eric Whitaker for nailing two field
goals and six extra points in his sea
son debut. And they praised line
backer A .J. Tarpley for his intercep
tion, forced fumble and, of course,
fumble recovery at the game's con
clusion.

But someone was left out of the
spotlight. A Cardinal player was re
sponsible for stripping the ball out of
USC running back Curtis McNeal's
hands. What about the hero who
made the play that essentially saved
the Cardinal's perfect season?
According to Stephens, the play
happened so quickly he had no idea
that hero was him. But he could've
cared less to find out.

As soon as Tarpley fell on the
loose ball in the end zone, Stephens
sprinted toward midfield with his
hands in the air, hugging every line
man, wideout and coach in sight. He
never once wondered whether the
celebration was due to his play.
It actually took a You Tube video,
two hours after the game, for
Stephens to find out officially. As the
team headed toward the airport,
Stephens received a video of the final
play of the game from his mom, a clip
that had already received multiple
page views.

At that moment, most players
would've jumped out of their bus seat

in personal exhilaration, immediate
ly sharing the news and showing the
video to surrounding teammates.
But that's not Terrence Stephens.
He doesn't care about personal glory.
He'd rather play the role of the
unsung hero.
"A win is a win, no matter how it
happens. Coach Mason and Coach
Tarver always say that it doesn't mat
ter how we win, it's that we put the
'W on the board," Stephens said.
"We just knew there was going to be
some way that we were going to do it,
and I'm honestly just glad that it hap
pened to be that way."
Stephens is one of those players
who radiates humility and selfless

ness, to the point where you know
he's not just being cliche. He deflect
ed every question about his play in
the USC game, responding with
some thought about the team in
stead.

"My play couldn't have happened
if a linebacker didn't stay in the hole,
or even the series before, if someone
didn't step up in the second overtime,
or if the offense didn't step up to the
plate and keep us in the game," he
said. "I think a lot of people will focus
on that one final play and that's great.
But at the end of the day, if our of
fense and defense didn't step up and
make plays, we wouldn't have been in
that position."

Stephens may not be the defen
sive player featured first on College
Game Day or called over for inter
views following victories. But he is a
team player through thick and thin.
And that's what being a member
of the Stanford Cardinal defense is all
about.

Stephens grew up in Gaithers
burg, Md., with no siblings and one
parent, his mother, Tracey Stephens.
According to Stephens, his mother
was his role model, the woman who
sowed the seeds of hard work, deter
mination and teamwork into his core.
"From a young age, my mom was


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
the one who taught me how to really
work and how to never give up on the
things I believed in," Stephens said.
Embracing his mother's words of
wisdom, Stephens shined as a football
player and student. A graduate of
Quince Orchard High School,
Stephens was listed as the 19th-best
defensive tackle in the nation by
Scout.com and 41st-best defensive
lineman by Super Prep Magazine. He
was very social among his classmates
and stood out as a singer, known for
his Motown and R&B vocals around
campus. He even tried out for Ameri
can Idol when the show came to
Philadelphia.

But when the time came to select a
football scholarship offer, the hot re
cruiting commodity shifted off the
beaten track. Instead of accepting of
fers from the likes of Nebraska and
Maryland, Stephens accepted the
offer from Stanford, a program just
two years removed from a 1-11 sea
son. With the help of fellow high
school senior football standout
Shayne Skov, Stephens recruited the
nation's top players to follow suit,
helping the Cardinal achieve a top-25
recruiting class, one the Mercury
News characterized in 2009 as "Stan

ford's best in years."
Stephens' high school friends and
the other players called him "the
Mayor" for his recruiting efforts. But
unlike politicians, Stephens wasn't
reaching out to other players for his
own personal gain.
Stanford football, underlined by a
winning culture and team-first men
tality, had potential to thrive as a pro
gram. Stephens felt the program just
needed the pieces to do so.
"I had hopes that we could be
come what we are today," he said. "I
had this feeling. And when you bring
in the right guys and you bring them
into the right place at the right time,
you can feel that."
But it wasn't always smooth sailing
for the Mayor. As other highly touted
recruits got starting time on the field,
Stephens spent his first year behind
stud defensive tackle Sione Fua, now
a member of the Carolina Panthers.
Stephens played a reserve role in six
of 12 games his freshman season and
12 of 13 his sophomore season.
For most football players, going
from the national high school stage to
reserve duty would be tough to swal
low.

Stephens wouldn't have had it any
other way.
"You kind of have to stay in your
lane, earn respect from your team
mates as a team player," Stephens
said. "And in my opinion, that's the
way it should work. [l] had to show
people what [I was] preaching."
For the first two years, Stephens
did everything he could, both during
practice and behind the scenes, to
earn that respect. He pushed himself
to the limit on the field. He spent time
performing service work for the com
munity off it. Finally, after waiting his
turn for two years, Stephens notched
his first start against San Jose State on
Sept. 3.

He couldn't have entered into
more of a high-pressure environment.
Going into the 2011-12 season,
Stanford was an intriguing entity.
Columnists for ESPN suggested that

the Cardinal was overhyped, that the
team was all Andrew Luck, that with
five departing starters, including Fua,
Stanford wouldn't be able to compete
for a national championship.
Stephens said the team channeled
the preseason criticism as fuel for mo
tivation. But nothing fueled the de
fense's fire more than Skov's injury on
Sept. 17.

"When he went down [against Ari
zona], it hurt because I know how
much he wanted to invest in this sea
son, how much he had already invest
ed in this season," Stephens said. "At
that moment, everybody just had to
refocus and reevaluate themselves as
players and as people and realize that
we needed to step up our game for
him."

With the heart and soul of the Car
dinal defense out for the season,
doubters popped their heads out of
the sand. According to the general
consensus among reporters and ana
lysts, Stanford's chances at a national
title now looked grim.
Yet Skov's torn ACL inspired the
defensive players to develop a new
mantra, one that they discuss before
the start of every practice, football
game and key play.
Who cares?

"Who cares where they get the
ball, who cares how many points they
have on the board, who cares what we
have to do to get them off the field,"
Stephens said. "We just have to do it."
Thanks to Stephens' unsung hero
ics, they haven't stopped doing it yet.

mates as a team player," Stephens
said. "And in my opinion, that's the
way it should work. [l] had to show
people what [I was] preaching."
For the first two years, Stephens
did everything he could, both during
practice and behind the scenes, to
earn that respect. He pushed himself
to the limit on the field. He spent time
performing service work for the com
munity off it. Finally, after waiting his
turn for two years, Stephens notched
his first start against San Jose State on
Sept. 3.

He couldn't have entered into
more of a high-pressure environment.
Going into the 2011-12 season,
Stanford was an intriguing entity.
Columnists for ESPN suggested that

the Cardinal was overhyped, that the
team was all Andrew Luck, that with
five departing starters, including Fua,
Stanford wouldn't be able to compete
for a national championship.
Stephens said the team channeled
the preseason criticism as fuel for mo
tivation. But nothing fueled the de
fense's fire more than Skov's injury on
Sept. 17.

"When he went down [against Ari
zona], it hurt because I know how
much he wanted to invest in this sea
son, how much he had already invest
ed in this season," Stephens said. "At
that moment, everybody just had to
refocus and reevaluate themselves as
players and as people and realize that
we needed to step up our game for
him."

With the heart and soul of the Car

Nobody knew Terrence
Stephens was responsi
ble for the fumble, in
cluding Terrence
Stephens.
As the players celebrated their
thrilling triple-overtime victory over
USC on Oct. 29, the post-game pun
dits went to work. They praised quar
terback Andrew Luck for putting on
a Heisman-worthy performance,
pulling his head out of the sand after
a costly interception to engineer a
touchdown drive that forced over
time. They praised backup kicker
Eric Whitaker for nailing two field
goals and six extra points in his sea
son debut. And they praised line
backer A .J. Tarpley for his intercep
tion, forced fumble and, of course,
fumble recovery at the game's con
clusion.

But someone was left out of the
spotlight. A Cardinal player was re
sponsible for stripping the ball out of
USC running back Curtis McNeal's
hands. What about the hero who
made the play that essentially saved
the Cardinal's perfect season?
According to Stephens, the play
happened so quickly he had no idea
that hero was him. But he could've
cared less to find out.

As soon as Tarpley fell on the
loose ball in the end zone, Stephens
sprinted toward midfield with his
hands in the air, hugging every line
man, wideout and coach in sight. He
never once wondered whether the
celebration was due to his play.
It actually took a You Tube video,
two hours after the game, for
Stephens to find out officially. As the
team headed toward the airport,
Stephens received a video of the final
play of the game from his mom, a clip
that had already received multiple
page views.

At that moment, most players
would've jumped out of their bus seat

in personal exhilaration, immediate
ly sharing the news and showing the
video to surrounding teammates.
But that's not Terrence Stephens.
He doesn't care about personal glory.
He'd rather play the role of the
unsung hero.
"A win is a win, no matter how it
happens. Coach Mason and Coach
Tarver always say that it doesn't mat
ter how we win, it's that we put the
'W on the board," Stephens said.
"We just knew there was going to be
some way that we were going to do it,
and I'm honestly just glad that it hap
pened to be that way."
Stephens is one of those players
who radiates humility and selfless

ness, to the point where you know
he's not just being cliche. He deflect
ed every question about his play in
the USC game, responding with
some thought about the team in
stead.

"My play couldn't have happened
if a linebacker didn't stay in the hole,
or even the series before, if someone
didn't step up in the second overtime,
or if the offense didn't step up to the
plate and keep us in the game," he
said. "I think a lot of people will focus
on that one final play and that's great.
But at the end of the day, if our of
fense and defense didn't step up and
make plays, we wouldn't have been in
that position."

Stephens may not be the defen
sive player featured first on College
Game Day or called over for inter
views following victories. But he is a
team player through thick and thin.
And that's what being a member
of the Stanford Cardinal defense is all
about.

Stephens grew up in Gaithers
burg, Md., with no siblings and one
parent, his mother, Tracey Stephens.
According to Stephens, his mother
was his role model, the woman who
sowed the seeds of hard work, deter
mination and teamwork into his core.
"From a young age, my mom was


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
the one who taught me how to really
work and how to never give up on the
things I believed in," Stephens said.
Embracing his mother's words of
wisdom, Stephens shined as a football
player and student. A graduate of
Quince Orchard High School,
Stephens was listed as the 19th-best
defensive tackle in the nation by
Scout.com and 41st-best defensive
lineman by Super Prep Magazine. He
was very social among his classmates
and stood out as a singer, known for
his Motown and R&B vocals around
campus. He even tried out for Ameri
can Idol when the show came to
Philadelphia.

But when the time came to select a
football scholarship offer, the hot re
cruiting commodity shifted off the
beaten track. Instead of accepting of
fers from the likes of Nebraska and
Maryland, Stephens accepted the
offer from Stanford, a program just
two years removed from a 1-11 sea
son. With the help of fellow high
school senior football standout
Shayne Skov, Stephens recruited the
nation's top players to follow suit,
helping the Cardinal achieve a top-25
recruiting class, one the Mercury
News characterized in 2009 as "Stan

ford's best in years."
Stephens' high school friends and
the other players called him "the
Mayor" for his recruiting efforts. But
unlike politicians, Stephens wasn't
reaching out to other players for his
own personal gain.
Stanford football, underlined by a
winning culture and team-first men
tality, had potential to thrive as a pro
gram. Stephens felt the program just
needed the pieces to do so.
"I had hopes that we could be
come what we are today," he said. "I
had this feeling. And when you bring
in the right guys and you bring them
into the right place at the right time,
you can feel that."
But it wasn't always smooth sailing
for the Mayor. As other highly touted
recruits got starting time on the field,
Stephens spent his first year behind
stud defensive tackle Sione Fua, now
a member of the Carolina Panthers.
Stephens played a reserve role in six
of 12 games his freshman season and
12 of 13 his sophomore season.
For most football players, going
from the national high school stage to
reserve duty would be tough to swal
low.

Stephens wouldn't have had it any
other way.
"You kind of have to stay in your
lane, earn respect from your team
mates as a team player," Stephens
said. "And in my opinion, that's the
way it should work. [l] had to show
people what [I was] preaching."
