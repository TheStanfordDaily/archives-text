# Q&A
## Catching up with 'Tree's Company' Fleener, Toilolo and Ertz sit down with TSD 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The tight end trio comprised of
redshirt senior Coby Fleener and
redshirt sophomores Levine Toilo
lo and Zach Ertz has played a large
role in the football team's offensive
success. The Stanford Daily sat
down with the players dubbed
"Tree's Company" to discuss all
things tight end.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): From
your perspective, what has been the
biggest difference for you guys this
year as a tight end corps?
Coby Fleener (CF): I guess we've
all gotten the opportunity to help
the team, and we've taken advan
tage of that. Whether it's in the run
game as blockers or the pass game
as receivers, I think we relish the
opportunity to do whatever we can
to help us win.
Levine Toilolo (LT): I think the
biggest thing is focusing on prepa
ration. As a unit and as a team, we
take pride in taking everything this
season one step at a time. Making
sure we are focusing on the details
and keying in on the little things.
Having the group of tight ends that
we have, we are able to push each
other to get better.
Zach Ertz (ZE): Personally, I think
the key to the success this year is
that the coaches are putting us all in
situations to be successful. That has
definitely played a key role in the
success we have had.
TSD: You guys obviously have
slightly different skill sets, so what
unique qualities do you think you
each bring to the table?
CF: When you look at Levine or
Zach, they both can stretch the
field or block, and so it is really a
matchup problem for defenses
when you put guys like that out
there. Whether it's Levine going

long one play and Zach's blocking,
or vice versa, it makes us very diffi
cult to cover. And when all three of
us are out there, it makes it that
much more difficult.
LT: For me a big thing has been
consistency. Whether that's block
ing or when Andrew comes my way
with the ball, I focus on being some
one the team can really count on.
Just trying to be running the ball my
way and getting a key block, or
coming down with a key catch.
TSD: What is the best and worst
thing about being so tall?
CF: Um, traveling, I guess, is not
necessarily ideal. Definitely the
small legroom in the car or on a
plane isn't fun. And the best, I don't
know, maybe being able to see over
crowds, [laughing] I'm not really
sure.
LT: Not really being able to fit in
the dorm beds, but I was able to get
my own queen-size [bed], so that's
actually pretty nice.
ZE: Best thing is that it's allowed
me to play tight end with Coby and
Levine. The worst is how hard it is
to find nice clothes that fit me.
TSD: Coby, as the elder spokesman
of the bunch, what role have you
taken in mentoring these young
guns?

CF: [Laughter] Well, I try to pass
along anything that I've learned, es
pecially that's going to help them
and ultimately help the team. So if
that's a tidbit of knowledge about
how to do a certain play or a certain
technique, I'll pass that along. And
before I go I want to make sure I let
them know all the things that have
helped me in my career so they can
use them.

TSD: All three of you guys could
have found opportunities to play
basketball at the next level; what
made you pick football?

LT : Football is j ust something that I
loved growing up. A lot of my fami
ly played football, and that's what
pulled me away from playing bas
ketball. We love playing basketball,
but the biggest thing for me was
being with my family.

CF: I didn't play basketball well
enough apparently. Ultimately I
think it comes down to a numbers
game. There are a lot more scholar
ships available for football than
there are for basketball, and while
the athleticism was there, my skills
weren't quite up to par in basket
ball as they were in football.
And Stanford University sells
itself, really. The combination of ac

ademics and athletics is second to
none. At the time I was being re
cruited, there was no coach really
in place, but based on Stanford's
academic record and them playing
in an awesome conference, I knew
I wanted to come here regardless.

ZE: Going into my sophomore
year of high school I kind of want
ed to focus on the two sports and
just let it see where it might take
me. Then after my junior year I
started getting recruited and real
ized that my future was in football,
and I was thrilled. Stanford was
one the first schools to look at me
and I loved the coaching staff then
and I decided to just focus on foot
ball and play at Stanford.

TSD: What are the challenges to
playing in an offense that uses
three tight ends and rotates you
around so often?

LT: Honestly I don't know if I'd call
it a challenge. I think it's just some
thing that makes us better as a unit.
It's difficult to make sure you know
the different roles, but it's really
more fun than challenging.

ZE: I don't think there really are
too many challenges because we all
play so much and are on the field so
often at the same time that it works
out well. Also, with the three of us
rotating, we are always fresh and
ready to play at a very high level.

TSD: Stanford football as a brand
has grown a lot in recent years. Are
you guys getting some more looks
or street cred on campus?

CF: [laughter] Not really, simple
routine that doesn't take me out
too many times. Go between points
A, B and maybe C, don't see too
many people. But it's funny when
other guys on the team with long
hair get asked if they are Coby.

The tight end trio comprised of
redshirt senior Coby Fleener and
redshirt sophomores Levine Toilo
lo and Zach Ertz has played a large
role in the football team's offensive
success. The Stanford Daily sat
down with the players dubbed
"Tree's Company" to discuss all
things tight end.
The Stanford Daily (TSD): From
your perspective, what has been the
biggest difference for you guys this
year as a tight end corps?
Coby Fleener (CF): I guess we've
all gotten the opportunity to help
the team, and we've taken advan
tage of that. Whether it's in the run
game as blockers or the pass game
as receivers, I think we relish the
opportunity to do whatever we can
to help us win.
Levine Toilolo (LT): I think the
biggest thing is focusing on prepa
ration. As a unit and as a team, we
take pride in taking everything this
season one step at a time. Making
sure we are focusing on the details
and keying in on the little things.
Having the group of tight ends that
we have, we are able to push each
other to get better.
Zach Ertz (ZE): Personally, I think
the key to the success this year is
that the coaches are putting us all in
situations to be successful. That has
definitely played a key role in the
success we have had.
TSD: You guys obviously have
slightly different skill sets, so what
unique qualities do you think you
each bring to the table?
CF: When you look at Levine or
Zach, they both can stretch the
field or block, and so it is really a
matchup problem for defenses
when you put guys like that out
there. Whether it's Levine going

long one play and Zach's blocking,
or vice versa, it makes us very diffi
cult to cover. And when all three of
us are out there, it makes it that
much more difficult.
LT: For me a big thing has been
consistency. Whether that's block
ing or when Andrew comes my way
with the ball, I focus on being some
one the team can really count on.
Just trying to be running the ball my
way and getting a key block, or
coming down with a key catch.
TSD: What is the best and worst
thing about being so tall?
CF: Um, traveling, I guess, is not
necessarily ideal. Definitely the
small legroom in the car or on a
plane isn't fun. And the best, I don't
know, maybe being able to see over
crowds, [laughing] I'm not really
sure.
LT: Not really being able to fit in
the dorm beds, but I was able to get
my own queen-size [bed], so that's
actually pretty nice.
ZE: Best thing is that it's allowed
me to play tight end with Coby and
Levine. The worst is how hard it is
to find nice clothes that fit me.
TSD: Coby, as the elder spokesman
of the bunch, what role have you
taken in mentoring these young
guns?

CF: [Laughter] Well, I try to pass
along anything that I've learned, es
pecially that's going to help them
and ultimately help the team. So if
that's a tidbit of knowledge about
how to do a certain play or a certain
technique, I'll pass that along. And
before I go I want to make sure I let
them know all the things that have
helped me in my career so they can
use them.

TSD: All three of you guys could
have found opportunities to play
basketball at the next level; what
made you pick football?

LT : Football is j ust something that I
loved growing up. A lot of my fami
ly played football, and that's what
pulled me away from playing bas
ketball. We love playing basketball,
but the biggest thing for me was
being with my family.

CF: I didn't play basketball well
enough apparently. Ultimately I
think it comes down to a numbers
game. There are a lot more scholar
ships available for football than
there are for basketball, and while
the athleticism was there, my skills
weren't quite up to par in basket
ball as they were in football.
And Stanford University sells
itself, really. The combination of ac

ademics and athletics is second to
none. At the time I was being re
cruited, there was no coach really
in place, but based on Stanford's
academic record and them playing
in an awesome conference, I knew
I wanted to come here regardless.

ZE: Going into my sophomore
year of high school I kind of want
ed to focus on the two sports and
just let it see where it might take
me. Then after my junior year I
started getting recruited and real
ized that my future was in football,
and I was thrilled. Stanford was
one the first schools to look at me
and I loved the coaching staff then
and I decided to just focus on foot
ball and play at Stanford.

TSD: What are the challenges to
playing in an offense that uses
three tight ends and rotates you
around so often?

LT: Honestly I don't know if I'd call
it a challenge. I think it's just some
thing that makes us better as a unit.
It's difficult to make sure you know
the different roles, but it's really
more fun than challenging.

ZE: I don't think there really are
too many challenges because we all
play so much and are on the field so
often at the same time that it works
out well. Also, with the three of us
rotating, we are always fresh and
ready to play at a very high level.

TSD: Stanford football as a brand
has grown a lot in recent years. Are
you guys getting some more looks
or street cred on campus?

CF: [laughter] Not really, simple
routine that doesn't take me out
too many times. Go between points
A, B and maybe C, don't see too
many people. But it's funny when
other guys on the team with long
hair get asked if they are Coby.
