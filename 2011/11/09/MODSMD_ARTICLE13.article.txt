## EDITORIAL Faculty input and the NYC decision 
### 
Upon the conclusion of the
presentations of President
John Hennessy and Profes
sor Bernd Girod on October 13 to
the Faculty Senate on the proposed
New York City applied sciences
and engineering campus, there
were at least 15 faculty comments
almost entirely from professors
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences regarding the pro
posed campus. One professor wor
ried that this new campus might
harm efforts to sell Stanford as a
university committed equally to
both liberal arts and STEM fields.
Another professor expressed con
cern that this campus, which will be
housed almost entirely by graduate
students, might fundamentally shift
Stanford's balance between under
graduate and graduate studies.
And one professor noted that if
this project were to fail, for whatev
er reason, Stanford's prestige
would suffer across the board.
While some of these concerns
may not be valid, they illustrate
that faculty members from all disci
plines believe they have a stake in
this process. Since it is not practical
to have every professor consulted
in all major University decisions, a
Faculty Senate was formed in 1968
with "the power and responsibility
for the academic administration of
the University." The Faculty Senate
is also charged with formulating
specific policies "on all matters re
lated to teaching and research,"
which it does through the use of 11
standing committees. Policies de
veloped by these committees "do
not take effect until approved" by
the Faculty Senate.
The standing committee that
seems most relevant to the New
York City proposal is the Planning
and Policy Board, which in 2000
was created to be a "keeper of the
faculty's vision for the Universi
ty." However, the Planning and
Policy Board did not report to the
Senate before the University sub
mitted its proposal. Nor were any
actions of this committee men
tioned in President Hennessey's
presentation. Instead, the only
committee referred to was a facul
ty advisory committee that is not
one of the 11 standing committees.
This advisory committee consist
ed of engineers, entrepreneurs
and business faculty appointed by
School of Engineering Dean Jim
Plummer and is charged with for
mulating the specifics of the pro
posal. It did not undertake the
question of whether the NYC
campus was worth pursuing, nor
was it in a position to do so given
its narrow composition.
One wonders why the model of
University governance demon
strated during the ROTC approval

process was not followed here. In
the ROTC process, an ad-hoc com
mittee â€” consisting of a diverse
group of students, faculty and ad
ministrators was first created to
examine whether an ROTC pro
gram should return to Stanford.
After the Faculty Senate voted in
favor of this committee's recom
mendation to bring an ROTC pro
gram to campus, the President still
had to invite the U.S. Military to
campus and a subsequent commit
tee still had to work out the details
of the program.
But the NYC campus process
seems to be operating in reverse.
First, a committee was established
to contribute to a 600-page report
detailing the proposed campus.
President Hennessy then submit
ted this proposal to New York City.
However, it seems that the ques
tion of whether Stanford should
pursue this idea has yet to be ap
propriately examined. Faculty
members were surveyed on
whether they supported the idea,
but those surveyed were exclusive
ly in the fields that would be a part
of the new campus. To be fair. Pres
ident Hennessy noted in the pres
entation that this process "is mov
ing much faster than would be ideal
in an academic planning cycle."
However, given that a 600-page
proposal was developed in the
three months after Mayor Michael
Bloomberg issued his formal re
quest, it is hard to believe that an
other committee could not have
worked concurrently in that time
frame to evaluate whether Stan
ford should pursue this campus.
One could argue that the Plan
ning and Policy Board can wait
until after Mayor Bloomberg has
made his final selection to report to
the Faculty Senate. But by that
time, the prospect of a New York
Campus will likely have gathered
irreversible momentum; negotia
tions with the city, for instance, are
planned to commence before a
winner is even announced. Should
Stanford be approved, it would be
hard to imagine the Planning and
Policy Board, or any other commit
tee, opposing the development of
the proposed campus, especially
considering the strong ties Presi
dent Hennessy has with this partic
ular project and the more than $1
million and innumerable hours al
ready spent in preparation. Should
Stanford be selected, it will likely
be too late for a proper examina
tion of whether Stanford should
have pursued the project. While we
lean towards support of the idea of
an applied sciences and engineer
ing campus in New York City, it is
reasonable to question the decision
making process that produced the
application.
