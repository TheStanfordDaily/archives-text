## Where the wild things were 
### Amanda Ach 
This past weekend, I took a trip
to the Monterey Bay Aquari
um. If you haven't been, I
highly recommend you visit before
you graduate it's an incredible
place. We saw adorable otters,
played with the interactive exhibits
(which were definitely intended for
children but I found to be a lot of
fun) and most importantly, watched
a video about seahorse sex, in which
they delicately refer to it as "danc
ing." Needless to say, it was a great
day. But as much fun as the aquari
um is, it is also a very informative
place I not only learned about
seahorses and their sex lives, but
was also reminded of how our de
structive lifestyles are ruining
ecosystems and endangering the
lives of many marine animals. Un
fortunately, the way the message
was presented was somewhat
flawed to raise awareness about
the ecological impacts of various
foods, the museum put out plates of
shrimp cocktails and sashimi. Of
course, this just made me hungry,
and after leaving the museum
and I'm really ashamed to admit
this I went to a restaurant and
ordered myself a shrimp cocktail.
Oops. Fortunately, there is a silver
lining to this story. My guilt has
compelled me to dedicate this
week's column to the poor, deli
cious shrimp and all the other en
dangered animals by recommend
ing that you pursue a career as a
wildlife rehabilitator.

In the past, wildlife rehabilita
tion was considered a hobby, with
people mostly helping out in their
free time. However, as environmen
tal concerns grow and more wild an
imals are pushed out of their natu
ral habitats by human activity, the
need for wildlife rehabilitators has
grown. In fact, it is now a full-time
job at which someone can make a
living albeit, not a great living,

but one that will support habits such
as eating and living under a roof.
The job of a wildlife rehabilitator
is to understand the animal in its
natural environment, including its
eating habits and typical daily
schedule, and recreate this environ
ment as closely as possible. This al
lows the animal to stay wild while
you care for it, so that when it has
recovered, it can successfully return
to its natural habitat.

While this may sound like a
heartbreaking movie plot, it's really
quite a fun and exciting lifestyle.
Not only will you be helping to save
the Earth's wildlife, but you will be
getting paid to play with adorable
little animals, which is kind of amaz
ing. You'll also spend most of your
days outside and have a great deal
of flexibility in where you want to
live and what type of animals you
want to help. Birds are the most
common types of animals for a
wildlife rehabilitator to work with,
so if you're like me and suffer from
ornithophobia (fear of birds), con
sider yourself warned.

Those best-suited for a career as
a wildlife rehabilitator aside
from not having animal-related
phobias will have a degree in bi
ology, ecology or some related field.
Beyond this degree, most organiza
tions will require some sort of certi
fication, although these require
ments vary depending on the em
ployer. In the end, though, the
biggest requirement is really your
dedication to doing this with your
life. Those of you who love animals,
the environment and helping others
will probably do well in this job if
you're just in it for the money,
maybe look elsewhere.
Bleeding hearts/wildlife rehabil
itators are employed by a variety of
different organizations, including
government agencies, non-profit
environmental and animal rights

groups and zoos. You will have the
opportunity to work with biologists
on their research related to these
animals and their ecosystems, in
cluding installing tracking devices
in a humane way. The job also in
volves basic medical work, so while
most wildlife rehabilitators are not
veterinarians, many dabble in ani
mal first-aid (yes, it's a real thing.)
As a wildlife rehabilitator, you
will get to work with animals and
protect them in a hands-on way. By
returning these animals to the wild
fully healed, you will also be restor
ing the ecosystems to which they
belong and strengthening the envi
ronment as a whole. It's a truly great
thing to do with your life, and on a
more selfish note, hopefully you can
undo some of the damage I did
when I ate that shrimp cocktail.
