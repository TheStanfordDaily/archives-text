## Ethics in the major 
### BRIANNA PANG '13 
The national Occupy Wall
Street movement is a reactive
movement. Stemming from
the financial crisis, Occupy has
started conversations about eco
nomic inequality only after the eco
nomic downturn. There is little con
versation about what changes need
to be made in our society's culture
in order for us to prevent a future
crisis that is why I propose the
addition of an Ethics in the Major
requirement.
An Ethics in the Major require
ment would require students to
think about the nuanced ethical is
sues in pursuing their fields and de
sired careers. For example, for tech
nical majors who are interested in
startups what are the ethics be
hind startups? Is entrepreneurship
always a good option, or is it better
to simply join an established com
pany? Or, for those who will be in
management positions in business
is it always better to increase
profit? Should you outsource labor
for cheaper workers in order to
drive profit margins? Or, for those
interested in pursuing public serv
ice what is ethical and effective
service? Thinking through these is
sues will equip students to handle
the questions that will inevitably
come up in their careers.
Currently, we have the "Educa
tion for Citizenship Ethical Rea
soning" requirement to address the
question of ethics. However, we are
only required to choose two out of
four areas of "Education for Citi
zenship." When faced with the deci

sion of taking courses in American
Culture, Ethical Reasoning, Gender
or Global Communication, most
students often opt for the most con
venient option rather than consid
ering the lessons that they need to
learn to become productive citi
zens. The Ethical Reasoning re
quirement exists already, so why
can't we make this actually relevant
for the sectors we are interested in
going into?
Ethics in the Major would also
require individual departments to
look into the complex ethical issues
of their disciplines. How do we
maintain social responsibility as fu
ture innovators, engineers, journal
ists, public servants, etc.? The Ethics
in Society program already address
es these concerns, but this needs to
become a more widespread conver
sation tailored to individual disci
plines. I respect departments that
already infuse the conversation of
ethics into their curriculum, but
these efforts need to be institution
alized.

For majors that don't necessarily
lead students on a linear path to a
certain career, students should be
able to pick which classes to take to
fulfill their Ethics in the Major re
quirement. Instead of forcing stu
dents to take an in-department
Ethics in the Major course, students
can also take an interdisciplinary
class for example, students inter
ested in finance but are majoring in
History can then take an MS&E fi
nancial engineering track ethics
class and vice versa. The point is to

mandate students to take at least
one ethics class related to their in
terests and proposed fields so they
can consider real world ethical
questions.
What do all the people indicted
for causing the economic downturn
have in common? They all, at one
point, went to college. Stanford, as
do other educational institutions,
needs to educate the next genera
tion of movers and shakers to be so
cially responsible in their fields.
Through the education of our fu
ture leaders, we can be proactive in
preventing another crisis as a result
of a series of unethical decisions. We
should not be deterring students
from pursuing investment banking
or careers in the financial industry
since some students are genuine
ly interested in financial markets
but instead, we should be making
sure that they do not make the same
mistakes.
We need to look at how we had
educated students to think that it
was OK to make decisions that
would lead to an economic collapse.
We need to look at how society's
culture promoted the creation of
Wall Street. Most importantly, we
need to find ways to educate the
next generation to become socially
responsible citizens.
It is time for us to let go of divid
ing ourselves into percentages it
doesn't matter who is in the 1 per
cent, the 99 percent or 53 percent.
We need to engage the 100 percent.
