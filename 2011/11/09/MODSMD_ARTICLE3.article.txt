## SUMC decreases liability premiums 
### ROBIN CHIN 
A recent report by the Institute for Healthcare Im
provement (IHI) showed that a new approach to han
dling preventable medical errors has reduced liability
premiums at Stanford hospitals by $3.2 million per
year.
Stanford's program involves the identification and
disclosure of adverse events, a movement intended to
prevent litigation and improve patient relations, ac
cording to Jeffrey Driver, chief risk officer for Stanford
University Medical Center.
Stanford University Medical Indemnity and Trust
Insurance (SUMIT) launched the Process for Early
Assessment and Resolution of Loss, or PEARL pro
gram, in 2007. Under the new initiative, insurance
providers worked with nurses and physicians at SUMC
to identify any adverse events and investigate medical
outcomes.
If an event is deemed to have been avoidable, Stan
ford approaches the affected patient and discloses the
details of the event. An apology is offered, and com
pensation may be negotiated.
Driver said that the program avoids high expenses
associated with settling medical liability claims in
court.
"Our focus was on the patient," Driver said. "To see
if we can't resolve this in a quicker way that doesn't in
volve litigation."
Without a disclosure program, Driver said it takes
much longer for an adverse event to be identified by a
patient. He said the time it takes for a patient to attain
a lawyer and file a claim can take up to a year after the
actual event.
He added that once the legal process is initiated,
legal expenses soar and can become staggering if the

claim is not resolved quickly.
"In the PEARL program, we rely on physicians and
nurses to report an event," Driver said. "That allows
SUMIT to look into these as soon as they happen
when the event is still fresh in everyone's mind."
Under PEARL, events are investigated and inter
views are conducted within 90 days of occurrence, un
less legal action has already been taken. All negotia
tions occur amongst the parties involved, allowing hos
pitals to avoid expenses associated with court-settled
cases.
SUMIT has evaluated the success of the program
over the past four years, and recently released those re
sults to the IHI, Driver said. In addition to the $3.2 mil
lion savings on premiums, the report showed that Stan
ford has seen a 36 percent decrease in liability claims.
Driver said the new process creates a win-win situ
ation for both parties: hospitals and patients circum
vent legal fees, and promptly achieved resolution can
avoid the emotional suffering often brought on by long
court battles.
Patients seem to be much happier with the pro
gram, according to Driver, and initial testimony has
been positive.
"Patients really are able to heal after one of these
events much quicker," he said.
This seems to have been the case with Leilani
Schweitzer and her son Gabriel, who was treated at Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital six years ago. Gabriel
died of complications from hydrocephalus, or "water in
the brain," because of what Schweitzer described as a
"perfect storm of things going wrong."
"Stanford was very open about what happened,"
Schweitzer said. "They explained everything to me.
They understood how 1 felt."
Schweitzer said she found out
much more about hydrocephalus
after her son died. She said that she
might have been able to help her son
more had she been equipped with
this knowledge beforehand.
"[Stanford] saw that there was a
need for better communication
around hydrocephalus," she said.
"They helped me take steps to start a
nonprofit."
Stanford helped to fund a non
profit Schweitzer founded, a website
called Gabriel's Life. The site pro
vides informative resources and a so
cial network for patients and families

dealing with hydrocephalus.
Stanford works to ensure that pa
tients are fairly compensated at
amounts comparable to what might
be awarded in court-based settle
ments, according to Driver. Cases
may still go into litigation if a patient
does not accept the privately negoti
ated compensation.

Driver noted that Stanford is not
the first to implement such a pro
gram. Other private institutions, such
as the University of Michigan and
the University of Illinois, have also
begun disclosing adverse events.
Despite initial successes, health
care providers are nervous about the
movement towards non-court reso
lution, Driver said. Many are reluc
tant to implement such policies, wor
rying that admittance of medical
error makes providers vulnerable to
prosecution in courts.

According to Driver, California's
benevolent gesture statutes, or
"apology laws," make it easier for
Stanford physicians to offer apolo
gies to patients without excessive
fear of litigation.
Despite initial concern, Driver
said he sees a push towards more dis
closure programs. Federally funded
demonstrations of successful imple
mentations are currently underway
in programs across the nation, he
added.
Schweitzer said the disclosure
program is not merely financially
practical, but also emotionally heal
ing for patients and families.
"It's a very powerful way of taking
something that is so immensely bad
and making it good," Schweitzer said.

over the past four years, and recently released those re
sults to the IHI, Driver said. In addition to the $3.2 mil
lion savings on premiums, the report showed that Stan
ford has seen a 36 percent decrease in liability claims.
Driver said the new process creates a win-win situ
ation for both parties: hospitals and patients circum
vent legal fees, and promptly achieved resolution can
avoid the emotional suffering often brought on by long
court battles.
Patients seem to be much happier with the pro
gram, according to Driver, and initial testimony has
been positive.
"Patients really are able to heal after one of these
events much quicker," he said.
This seems to have been the case with Leilani
Schweitzer and her son Gabriel, who was treated at Lu
cile Packard Children's Hospital six years ago. Gabriel
died of complications from hydrocephalus, or "water in
the brain," because of what Schweitzer described as a
"perfect storm of things going wrong."
"Stanford was very open about what happened,"
Schweitzer said. "They explained everything to me.
They understood how 1 felt."
Schweitzer said she found out
much more about hydrocephalus
after her son died. She said that she
might have been able to help her son
more had she been equipped with
this knowledge beforehand.
"[Stanford] saw that there was a
need for better communication
around hydrocephalus," she said.
"They helped me take steps to start a
nonprofit."
Stanford helped to fund a non
profit Schweitzer founded, a website
called Gabriel's Life. The site pro
vides informative resources and a so
cial network for patients and families

dealing with hydrocephalus.
Stanford works to ensure that pa
tients are fairly compensated at
amounts comparable to what might
be awarded in court-based settle
ments, according to Driver. Cases
may still go into litigation if a patient
does not accept the privately negoti
ated compensation.

Driver noted that Stanford is not
the first to implement such a pro
gram. Other private institutions, such
as the University of Michigan and
the University of Illinois, have also
begun disclosing adverse events.
Despite initial successes, health
care providers are nervous about the
movement towards non-court reso
lution, Driver said. Many are reluc
tant to implement such policies, wor
rying that admittance of medical
error makes providers vulnerable to
prosecution in courts.

According to Driver, California's
benevolent gesture statutes, or
"apology laws," make it easier for
Stanford physicians to offer apolo
gies to patients without excessive
fear of litigation.
Despite initial concern, Driver
said he sees a push towards more dis
closure programs. Federally funded
demonstrations of successful imple
mentations are currently underway
in programs across the nation, he
added.
Schweitzer said the disclosure
program is not merely financially
practical, but also emotionally heal
ing for patients and families.
"It's a very powerful way of taking
something that is so immensely bad
and making it good," Schweitzer said.
