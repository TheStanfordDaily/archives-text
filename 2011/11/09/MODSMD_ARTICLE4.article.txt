# OrgSync replaces MyGroups
## SAL changes system to manage student groups, introduces new application called OrgSync 
### AUSTIN LEWIS 
Next week Stanford is switching
applications for the management of
the more than 650 student groups and
organizations on campus, moving
from a system called MyGroups to a
different system, titled OrgSync.
Student Activities and Leadership
(SAL) sent emails last week to inform
student club and organization leaders
about training sessions for the new
site, which will be held this Wednes
day and Thursday at Tresidder Union
and the Black Community Service
Center, respectively. The new system
will officially go live for student use
next Wednesday.
As of last Friday, more than 200
different groups and clubs indicated
that they will be represented in these
sessions, according to SAL assistant
director Troy Steinmetz.
MyGroups, the creation of a Stan
ford alumnus, was designed specifi
cally for the University and was im
plemented for campus use in 2003. It
was initially intended to serve as a
record of all registered groups and
their current leaders. The University
introduced a later version of the sys
tem in 2005, which included financing,
event planning and approval for the
student groups and organizations.
For the past four years, SAL has
considered finding a different method
of student group organization and
management, Steinmetz said. The
first MyGroups program was con
structed using an older computer lan
guage, which limited the University in
adopting certain updates.

Steinmetz added that student
members were also not updating the
site frequently enough to provide the
most up-to-date information for
other students searching through My-
Groups.
"It's served us well, certainly at the
time, and it gets done the job that it
needs to get done. But students and
staff have had increasing demand for
system," Steinmetz said. "We couldn't
really afford to pay for development
to continually keep MyGroups up."
Last year, a team including Stein
metz and Seth Snyder, assistant dean
of student life and advisor to the Stan
ford Band, began to talk to students

and assess what students needed from
group management systems at Stan
ford.

When they had compiled their in
formation, they began looking at pos
sible replacements for MyGroups,
Steinmetz said. After comparing mul
tiple systems, they settled on three
possible candidates. Of those three fi
nalists, the team chose OrgSync.
"OrgSync had a better design, was
more intuitive and what we liked was
that their development timeline was
faster," Steinmetz said.
OrgSync is used in more than 200
college campuses to manage student
clubs and organizations. Its website
advertises itself as "an online commu
nity management system that central
izes campus involvement... stream
lines communication and helps to
build a stronger campus community."
Through OrgSync, clubs and or
ganizations will be able to manage full
rosters and calendars, store files and
create polls, discussion groups, wiki
pages and to-do lists. Club members
can also manage their external web
site from OrgSync, further centraliz
ing the management of student or
ganizations into one area, according
to Steinmetz.

Steinmetz mentioned that the sys
tem uses Amazon web services, which
are also used by startups in the Silicon
Valley, as a backend. He said that stu
dents will be able to search for clubs
and on-campus organizations more
effectively than with the earlier sys
tem.

The new system also has appeal for
the advisors of the organizations on
campus. "For me as an advisor, I had
a hard time knowing from past expe
rience what they had gone through as
a group, " Snyder said. "MyGroups
was more a basic database and more
of a record of what had happened
and much less interactive than what
we needed it to be. As an advisor, I
think OrgSync holds a lot of possibili
ties."

Student testing of OrgSync includ
ed the SAL student staff as well as a
few groups and organizations.
"MyGroups was not the best sys
tem," said Theta Delta Chi president
