## Banks outlines racial marriage gap 
### CATHERINE ZAW 
Law professor Richard Banks
said that twice as many African-
American women graduate with a
college degree as African-Ameri
can men during his talk Tuesday
afternoon discussing his recently
published book, "Is Marriage for
White People?"

He said his book looked at the
declining rate of marriage among
African Americans as opposed to
other races, the increasing dispari
ty in socioeconomic statuses be
tween married couples and the
minimal likelihood for black
women to marry outside of her
own race. According to Banks, less
than ten percent of black women
marry outside of her race.
"One part of my book is quali
tative sociology studies and cen
sus data, and the other part is
made up of in-depth interviews,
making the reading personally en
tertaining, engaging and informa
tive at the same time," Banks said.

He said his book started as
purely an academic project an
effort to see how big socioeco
nomic changes influence individu
als. According to Banks, he went
through legal, sociological and
economic archives to conduct re

search, and was inspired by a Stan
ford alumna to further pursue his
studies when she stated that his re
search related to her life very
much.
"One in ten black men is in
prison as we speak," Banks said.
"Black women have the smallest
pool of potential partners within
their race, yet black women are
also the least likely to marry out
side of their race, while women of
other minorities, like Asian and
Latinas, are three times as likely to
do so."

This is the major question
Banks addresses in his book, and
his book discusses possible rea
sons for this disparity in statistics.
"I'm trying to unpack all the
different things that keep black
women segregated even as other
groups are becoming increasingly
integrated," he said. "It's a conver
sation about things that we don't
usually talk about."

"African-American women
want black babies because they
want to uphold the black race," he
continued. "Because they have
fear of their community and fami
lies not being accepting, and be
cause the women don't want to be
confused as nannies of their dif
ferent colored babies."

Banks said, however, that by
not excluding individuals who are
of a different race, African-Amer
ican women would have more op
tions and, as a result, better
matched relationships in terms of
socioeconomic statuses and
shared educational experiences
making their marriages more
stable and more empowering.
"Rather than having the men
be the 'dealmakers' and the
women be the 'dealtakers' of a re
lationship, women can achieve re
lationships with men that are
more to their liking," he said. "This
is the ultimate paradox. Some
people see it as an abandonment
of the race, but really the best
thing individual women can do is
to open themselves to those out
side of their race."

One of the underlying criti
cisms of Banks's book is that it is
not pro-feminist, but rather pro
marriage. Banks said that this
view probably extends from mar
riage having a bed reputation,
since marriage is historically as
disadvantaging the lives of
women.

However, he said his book is
"feminist because it is about en
abling more black women to pur
sue a relationship that they want."

"This is a book that connects
the experiences of African Ameri
cans to all other Americans,"
Banks said. "Though these might
be more pronounced in the black
community, these experiences are
universal, and reflect the changes
we see around us every day."
