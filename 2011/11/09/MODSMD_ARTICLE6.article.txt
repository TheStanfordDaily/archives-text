## Senate talks NYC campus bid outreach ASSU gives update on Executive programs 
### BRENDAN O'BYRNE DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
discussed the proposed New York City
campus and was updated on several
ASSU Executive programs at its meet
ing on Tuesday evening.
The meeting, which was also attend
ed by freshman members of the Leader
ship Development Program (LDP), had
only one action item on the agenda. The
bill, a resolution showing support of the
persecuted Baha'i intellectuals within
Iran, was passed unanimously.
Personal reports from the ASSU Ex
ecutive followed, with Michael Cruz 'l2
and Stewart Macgregor-Dennis 'l3 up
dating the Senate on the progress of the
Governing Documents Commis
sion and the Division of Internal
Review (DIR).
The DIR, which was heavily de
bated and delayed in the Senate
because of a confidentiality clause
that some senators said conflicted
with the ASSU's open-information
policy, is still facing issues with con
fidentiality, according to Cruz.
"Unfortunately there isn't as
much work going on in the DIR as
we hoped," Cruz said. "They're
working out confidentiality is
sues."
In addition to the DIR, the
Community Action Board has also
faced delays. After being asked by
Senator Daniel DeLong 'l3 about
the board, Cruz said they had been
on hiatus for the past week and will

resume work next Monday.
A report from DeLong on be
half of the Advocacy Committee
detailed plans for the One-on-One
Advocacy Program, which would
help the ASSU assist students in
problems with University officials.
DeLong noted that this was not
a mediation service, but rather a
way for members of the ASSU to
help students resolve issues. The
Senate discussed several technical
issues in getting the project to
work, but DeLong said he hopes to
hand out business cards to Sena
tors and their LDP mentees next
Tuesday at the Senate meeting.
Brianna Pang 'l3 brought at
tention to the fact that four ASSU
solicitor generals (SG) from last
year had asked the Senate to cover
their personal stipends of $5OO.
Pang said the SGs had been
promised this amount, but their
stipends had been budgeted at
$l5O. Senators objected to paying
the bill through the current Senate,

and no consensus was reached as
to how the ASSU would handle the
SGs' request.
The conversation then turned
to the proposed Stanford New
York City campus. DeLong ex
pressed concerns he had received
from students about the initiative,
mainly the University's lack of stu
dent engagement around the issue.
"I think it's somewhat discon
certing that we have to push the ad
ministration to reach out to us and
educate us about the projects
they're doing to change the Univer
sity," DeLong said.
Senator Ben Laufer 'l2 recom
mended inviting a couple members
of the project to the next Senate
meeting to debrief the Senate and
provide a synopsis of what the proj
ect will include.

Nanci Howe, dean of Student
Activities and Leadership (SAL),
also discussed a new web platform
for student groups to use. The plat
form, called "OrgSync," would

allow student groups to make their
own webpage to help advertise and
organize their activities. Howe said
she hopes OrgSync will also eventu
ally be used to keep track of student
group finances.
USC ticket reimbursements are
still open to students who apply. 180

students have applied for a reim
bursement as of Tuesday. The Sen
ate still plans to refund the cost of
250 tickets, offering a reimburse
ment of $lO per ticket.
