Stanford students can browse through
Explore Courses and be overwhelmed
by the sheer quantity of classes avail
able to them. A small group, however,
find the selection lacking in some way.
Perhaps there is a course they wish were offered
but isn't. Perhaps there is simply a subject they
care deeply about and wish to share with others.
In either case, that's where student initiated
courses (SICs) come into play.
The SIC program allows students to plan, or
ganize and teach their own one- or two-unit
course on any subject of their choosing.
"The whole purpose of the program is to
allow students to teach a course that's not found
anywhere else on campus," said Samir Siddhan
ti 'l2 M.S. 'l2, president of the SIC program.
"That's probably the number one requirement,
that the course can't be found in any other de
partment."
There are six courses offered this quarter, in
cluding "Beginner Ceramics," "Sport and Dis
ability" and "Neil Gaiman: International Man
of Mystery."
"It presents an opportunity for students who
are very passionate about certain fields or a cer
tain area of expertise to spread their knowledge
with other students," Siddhanti said.
Any student is welcome to apply to teach a
SIC, although he or she must be willing to invest
a significant effort in the application process, the
preparation and the teaching itself.
"If an applicant fulfills all their requirements,
they should be able to teach a course," Siddhan
ti said. "We're not trying to be limiting in any
factor except that they fulfill the necessary re
quirements which are substantive,"
In order to be considered for a teaching po

sition, students must fill out the application
found on the SIC website. In addition, they must
have a faculty sponsor who is willing to write a
letter on their behalf.

"It's important that students [who] are in
terested in doing this are in good academic
standing before they apply," Siddhanti said.
After they apply, the students must attend
two workshops to prepare them for the expe
rience; one focused on leading discussions, the
other on building a syllabus.
"Creating a working syllabus and having
something that is prepared each week is im
portant," said Lena Schoemaker 'l2, co-in
structor of the "Sport and Disability" course
this quarter.

"It makes it more beneficial to narrow
down your focus of what you want to talk
about each week, and how that contributes to
the overall class," she added.
SICs have proven very popular among stu
dents. Susannah Poland 'l2, former president
of the Stanford Ceramics Club, wrote the ap
plication for the "Beginner Ceramics" course,
which ran for the first time last spring. The
class was a success, receiving 50 applications
for its 10 spots.
While the interest in "Sport and Disability"
was not overwhelming when it was first of
fered, also last spring, Schoemaker felt that
students who enrolled benefited from the
class.

"They really enjoyed it because it was
something different than what they were used
to," she said. "It was a safe space that they
could ask questions they weren't so sure
about."
Siddhanti sees no reason why the program
would be met with anything but positive re
sponses.
"It's for the students," he said. "All of our

money that we have goes directly back to the
students. I think it's a useful service for the
University. It's something that all the teachers
seem to enjoy, and obviously students sign up
voluntarily."
Nonetheless, the SIC program still sees
room for improvement. This year, it wants to
establish a system in which students offer
feedback on the classes they have taken. That
way, classes that are repeated from quarter to
quarter, or from year to year, can make neces
sary changes for the future.
Additionally, Siddhanti has attempted to
make it easier for prospective teachers or stu
dents to find information on the program by
centralizing information on a new website.

"It's ... a one-stop shop for any applica
tion questions, what courses are being taught,
stuff like that," he said.
A significant distinguishing factor between
SICs and regular classes is the fact that the stu
dents are being taught by their peers, which can
lead to a laid-back, discussion-based atmos
phere.
"A lot of times you don't even know what
the students are going to be interested in,"
Schoemaker said. "They might be interested in
a different direction than what you were plan
ning on, but allowing for that digression...
that's okay."
