## LEARNING FOR LIFE Staff training assistance program allows employees to take adult education classes 
### ARUSHIJAIN 
Learning can often be diminished into a
collection of numbers: 180,55,125, five,
one translating into 180 units for
graduation and between 55 and 125 for
a major. And so the list goes on. While
it is not always the case, checking classes off a list
can be the lackluster and ultimate prerequisite
for a job after graduation. But for employees en
rolled in the Continuing Studies Program (CSP)
and Staff Training Assistance Program (STAP),
learning is never reduced to a numerical necessi
ty-

CSP, Stanford's adult education program,
was founded in 1988 to provide opportunities to
the surrounding communities and access to the
intellectual life on campus. Adult education pro
grams at other universities encouraged faculty
and community members to reach out.

"It was an embarrassment that Stanford, as
great as it was, didn't extend itself in liberal arts in
an organized way to the adult community," said
Marsh McCall, classics professor emeritus and
founding dean of CSP
The program began with a four- to six-page cat
alogue offering six courses per term for nearly 200
students, but the catalogue has more than quadru
pled in length since then. It now offers more than
35 courses per term with 12,000 enrollments this
year, according to McCall.
Dan Colman, associate dean and director of
CSP, said courses encourage personal enrichment
and allow people to leam what they have never
had the opportunity to learn in the past.
"It is important that faculty members know
how to talk to a broader audience," Colman said.
Their audience consists of students who

come from a variety of professional back
grounds and interests. Sixty-five percent of them
have advanced degrees.
Among these students are many employees.
In the last year and a half, 10 percent of overall
enrollments in CSP have been STAP-eligible
employees, and 20 percent consist of people with
a Stanford affiliation, including part-time em
ployees or alumni.
Patti Smilovitz, manager of Stanford's
Human Resources Data Services, said the STAP
program was established in 1973 to encourage
regular staff members to use education and train
ing to promote learning and personal growth.
Any University employee who works 50 percent
time or more is eligible to receive a yearly grant of
$BOO toward continuing their education. Faculty,
students, temporary employees, retirees or other
non-staff University affiliates are not eligible. The
STAP program is one of three educational assis
tance programs provided by Stanford's Human
Resources department.
"It's wonderful for employees," said CSP
assistant director Elana Hornstein. "STAP
funds are virtual dollars. It enhances a career
and nourishes the life of the mind when you
have a job sitting in front of the computer
eight hours a day but can then delve into sub
jects you don't have time to read at home."
According to the Human Resources' website,
employees will be reimbursed if the course, sem
inar, or workshop is directly related to perform
ance of their current job at Stanford or if it is part
of a planned career development effort. These
can include courses in the Health Improvement
Program and Information Technology (IT). CSP
courses, however, were not always included as
part of STAP.
In the first two years of CSP's establishment,

McCall and his colleagues proposed including
CSP in STAP-eligible courses.
"Here is a terrific opportunity for our Uni
versity to make a huge statement about what this
University believes to be the proper and full def
inition of professional training," McCall said.
"Why should STAP be restricted to a narrow
and professional sense?"
For two years, they met with Human Re
sources to persuade them to allow STAP eligible
employees to allocate their funds towards CSP
courses.

"With a few shining exceptions, we met one
narrow-minded, petty bureaucrat after anoth
er," McCall said. "We are at Stanford University.
What kind of statement is that to our employees
that your training and improvement is limited to
computer courses?"
After several meetings, the eligibility for
STAP funds was changed and qualifying cours
es were extended to include liberal education as
well as personal and professional development.
"I bet only 5 percent of those that use STAP
funds have any memory that there was a time
they couldn't use their funds to sit with other
adults in a serious educational context with
some Stanford teacher and get the experience
that all Stanford students were getting in the
daytime," McCall said.
Maggie Diamond, a full-time employee in
the Office of Development, is a testament to this.
She has used STAP almost every year, once to
attend a conference with a writing workshop for
fundraisers and later to enroll in several writing
classes in the CSP.

"Part of the reason why I wanted to work for
Stanford [was] its atmosphere that really values
learning and is a great opportunity to either
study something in more depth or study a new

topic," Diamond said.
STAP administrative associate Judy Ray has
used STAP for workshops in information tech
nology courses, software application and com
munications to enhance her job and to earn de
grees. She now helps improve the program for
other employees.
"It is still trying to grow," Ray said. "Some
employees don't have information about STAP,
and when they do get information, it is at the end
of year and too late to use it."
Another problem the program faces is that
STAP's popularity wanes with employees who
stay at Stanford longer, according to Smilovitz.
In the next year, Human Resources Informa
tion Systems is planning to study the use of the
three educational assistance programs to find
out what percent of employees are using the
money.
"If we find that utilization is low, we need to
take a look at it and make sure employees know
about it," Smilovitz said.
Smilovitz and Ray are working to expand
awareness of STAP with the hope that more em
ployees will seek out the benefits the program
has to offer.
"Employees who would not have otherwise
taken certain classes or would not have spent
their own money can now enhance their job
skills and develop themselves," Smilovitz said.
Diamond agreed, citing the importance of
being in an atmosphere with a mix of people
from different backgrounds, levels of experience
and interests.

"It's good that Stanford invests in its employ
ees' development," Diamond said. "A world
class university should have a world-class staff."
