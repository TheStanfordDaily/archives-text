# Palo Alto voters pass Measures D,E
## 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF â€“ Kurt Chirbas 
A provision, which allowed fire
fighters and the police to use outside
arbitrators in the settlement of con
tractual disputes, came full circle
Tuesday night when Palo Alto voters
approved Measure D with a 67.28
percent majority and repealed bind
ing arbitration.
In 1978, voters added the provi
sion to the City Charter, giving arbi
trators the ability to make binding
rulings when the two parties reached
impasses on pay and benefit dis
putes. The move was attributed at
the time as away of counterbalanc
ing the fact that the city's firefighters
and police officers do not have the
right to strike.
However, with the passage of
Measure D, Palo Alto has now re
pealed the provision following a
statewide trend. Vallejo voters also
repealed binding arbitration in its
June elections, and San Luis Obispo
voters in August.
The San Jose Mercury News
called the measure "a test of the
clout of public unions in a Democra
tic stronghold."

Yoriko Kishimoto, a former
mayor of Palo Alto and a Measure D
supporter, told the Peninsula Press
in an interview posted on You Tube
earlier in the week that the measure
comes after years of growth in the
funds delegated toward areas like
the fire department, which as a re
sult, has "crowdfed] out other servic
es."

She said that Service Efforts and
Accomplishment (SEA) reporting
has shown that funds dedicated to
ward fire safety have grown by 31
percent over the past five years,
while funds for community service
have remained unchanged.
Tony Spitaleri, president of the
Professional Firefighter's Union,

opposed the measure and called it a
"power grab" in an interview with
Peninsula Press that was also posted
on You Tube. He said that firefight
ers would no longer be able to "push
back" during negotiations over their
contract, which will expire in three
years.

"I think it's another way of hav
ing control of your workforce and
having them have little or no say in
what happens to them," he said.
Spitaleri expressed disappoint
ment that the measure passed Tues
day night.
"We're going to end up with
nothing resolved," he said to the
Peninsula Press. "A group of people
treated like second class citizens."

Palo Alto voters also passed
Measure E, which would un-dedi
cate 10 of Byxbee Park's 127 acres in
hopes of building a compost facility,
with a 64.38 percent majority.
"Support for Measure E allows
further research of the waste-to-en
ergy facility options," said Mary
Alice Thornton, the president of the
League of Women Voters of Palo
Alto, to the Peninsula Press.
