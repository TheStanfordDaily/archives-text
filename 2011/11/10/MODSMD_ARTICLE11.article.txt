## PROFILE Spreading the butterfly's wings Center for Buddhist Studies works to expand presence on campus 
### ALYA NAQVI 
Buddhism is one of the
most practiced religions
in the world. It is not
merely a series of medita
tive exercises but a com
plex philosophy entrenched in the
cultural traditions of East Asian
peoples. The University, through
the Ho Center for Buddhist Studies
at Stanford (HCBSS), is dedicating
time and resources to an area of
study, which in the past, has not
been emphasized academically on

campus.
"Buddhism is often not well un
derstood in the United States," said
religious studies professor Paul
Harrison. "Just under half of Amer
icans, according to a recent survey
done last year, do not know that the
Dalai Lama is Buddhist, which is a
surprising finding."
As a student, Harrison grew in
terested in Buddhist Studies and
Buddhist literature in particular
after majoring in Chinese and
Japanese. He is now the co-director
of the HCBSS, which contributes to

the Buddhist Studies Program and
is dedicated to raising public inter
est and awareness of different as
pects of Buddhism. A unit of the Di
vision of International, Compara
tive and Area Studies, it is closely af
filiated with the Department of Re
ligious Studies, the Tibetan Studies
Initiative and the Buddhist Com
munity at Stanford.
According to HCBSS associate
director Irene Lin, part of the pur
pose of its founding in 1997 was that
the field of Buddhist Studies and
humanities in general did not have

many resources. Formerly called
the Stanford Center for Buddhist
Studies until 2008, the Center was
renamed when it received an en
dowment, as well a graduate fellow
ship and a visiting professorship,
from the HCBSS.
The HCBSS is dedicated to pro
moting the academic study and
public understanding of the Bud
dhist tradition. It conducts a num
ber of research projects and semi
nars and brings research fellows to
the campus. According to Lin, appli
cants from around the world are ac
cepted depending on how closely
their research projects correlate
with existing studies. The rigor of
the application process ensures ap
plicants will be able to contribute to
and learn from the Center.
Carl Bielefeldt, co-director of
HCBSS and chair of the Religious
Studies Department, is involved in
the Soto Zen Text Project, which
works at translating the materials
used for the practice of Soto Zen, a
sect of Zen in Japanese Buddhism.
Harrison, too, is working on re
search on the study of Buddhist lit
erature.
"At present, that study is under
going a kind of boom period be
cause of the discovery of large num
bers of new Buddhist manuscripts
in Pakistan and Afghanistan," Har
rison said. "There is also material
coming out of the People's Repub
lic of China, which was previously
held in Tibet."
Harrison added that the Bud
dhist manuscript project will con
tribute to a better understanding of
the Buddhist tradition from both
the perspectives of the Buddhist
scholar and practitioner, which are
becoming more integrated, he said.
According to Harrison, many schol
ars are also practitioners who have
an insider's perspective on the tra
dition. At the same time, he said,
practitioners who read research
benefit from new analyses and
translations of the texts.
"It's not as if the two worlds are
entirely separate," he said.
Harrison added that the Center
holds events that expose students to
the practitioner's perspective.
"I think [students] should have
some appreciation of what Bud
dhism is like as a living tradition,"
he said. "It's not just something

that's dead and pinned to the wall
like a butterfly."
According to Bielefeldt in an
email to The Daily, despite current
research efforts, the Center lacks
multi-disciplinary perspectives in
cluding history, literature, art and
anthropology because of the fact
that the faculty works within the
Religious Studies department. Fur
thermore, the coverage of Bud
dhism in the Religious Studies de
partment does not extend much be
yond India, China and Japan.
"[Coverage is] as broad as we
can make it given that we only have
two faculty members at present,"
Harrison said. "But we try and com
pensate for that by inviting people
who can give our students and inter
ested members of the public a dif
ferent perspective."
According to Bielefeldt, these
weaknesses are also compensated
through library facilities and re
search funding. HCBSS holds re
search seminars, workshops, confer
ences and lectures for scholars.
Each quarter, the Center brings a
speaker to talk about different
practices.

Around one-third of all the
events are directed specifically to
wards the public, all or most of
which are free, with no registration
required, Lin said, and the theme of
the event varies according to de
mand. For instance, there have been
a series of events related to Bud
dhist art and Tibetan Buddhism.
According to Lin, the events have
attracted a considerable amount of
campus interest, with about 100 to
300 attendees at each event.
What makes Buddhist Studies so
relevant today? Lin emphasized
"Engaged Buddhism," which exam
ines the different ways Buddhism
can be applied in society, from so
cial work to healing to working at
corporations. Harrison stressed the
importance of studying and keeping
religions alive in an age she said is
becoming increasingly secular.
"It's important to know the reli
gious traditions that have affected
people's lives," Harrison said. "That
is no less important these days than
it has ever been, if not more impor
tant."

that's dead and pinned to the wall
like a butterfly."
According to Bielefeldt in an
email to The Daily, despite current
research efforts, the Center lacks
multi-disciplinary perspectives in
cluding history, literature, art and
anthropology because of the fact
that the faculty works within the
Religious Studies department. Fur
thermore, the coverage of Bud
dhism in the Religious Studies de
partment does not extend much be
yond India, China and Japan.
"[Coverage is] as broad as we
can make it given that we only have
two faculty members at present,"
Harrison said. "But we try and com
pensate for that by inviting people
who can give our students and inter
ested members of the public a dif
ferent perspective."
According to Bielefeldt, these
weaknesses are also compensated
through library facilities and re
search funding. HCBSS holds re
search seminars, workshops, confer
ences and lectures for scholars.
Each quarter, the Center brings a
speaker to talk about different
practices.

Around one-third of all the
events are directed specifically to
wards the public, all or most of
which are free, with no registration
required, Lin said, and the theme of
the event varies according to de
mand. For instance, there have been
a series of events related to Bud
dhist art and Tibetan Buddhism.
According to Lin, the events have
attracted a considerable amount of
campus interest, with about 100 to
300 attendees at each event.
What makes Buddhist Studies so
relevant today? Lin emphasized
"Engaged Buddhism," which exam
ines the different ways Buddhism
can be applied in society, from so
cial work to healing to working at
corporations. Harrison stressed the
importance of studying and keeping
religions alive in an age she said is
becoming increasingly secular.
"It's important to know the reli
gious traditions that have affected
people's lives," Harrison said. "That
is no less important these days than
it has ever been, if not more impor
tant."

Buddhism is one of the
most practiced religions
in the world. It is not
merely a series of medita
tive exercises but a com
plex philosophy entrenched in the
cultural traditions of East Asian
peoples. The University, through
the Ho Center for Buddhist Studies
at Stanford (HCBSS), is dedicating
time and resources to an area of
study, which in the past, has not
been emphasized academically on

campus.
"Buddhism is often not well un
derstood in the United States," said
religious studies professor Paul
Harrison. "Just under half of Amer
icans, according to a recent survey
done last year, do not know that the
Dalai Lama is Buddhist, which is a
surprising finding."
As a student, Harrison grew in
terested in Buddhist Studies and
Buddhist literature in particular
after majoring in Chinese and
Japanese. He is now the co-director
of the HCBSS, which contributes to

the Buddhist Studies Program and
is dedicated to raising public inter
est and awareness of different as
pects of Buddhism. A unit of the Di
vision of International, Compara
tive and Area Studies, it is closely af
filiated with the Department of Re
ligious Studies, the Tibetan Studies
Initiative and the Buddhist Com
munity at Stanford.
According to HCBSS associate
director Irene Lin, part of the pur
pose of its founding in 1997 was that
the field of Buddhist Studies and
humanities in general did not have

many resources. Formerly called
the Stanford Center for Buddhist
Studies until 2008, the Center was
renamed when it received an en
dowment, as well a graduate fellow
ship and a visiting professorship,
from the HCBSS.
The HCBSS is dedicated to pro
moting the academic study and
public understanding of the Bud
dhist tradition. It conducts a num
ber of research projects and semi
nars and brings research fellows to
the campus. According to Lin, appli
cants from around the world are ac
cepted depending on how closely
their research projects correlate
with existing studies. The rigor of
the application process ensures ap
plicants will be able to contribute to
and learn from the Center.
Carl Bielefeldt, co-director of
HCBSS and chair of the Religious
Studies Department, is involved in
the Soto Zen Text Project, which
works at translating the materials
used for the practice of Soto Zen, a
sect of Zen in Japanese Buddhism.
Harrison, too, is working on re
search on the study of Buddhist lit
erature.
"At present, that study is under
going a kind of boom period be
cause of the discovery of large num
bers of new Buddhist manuscripts
in Pakistan and Afghanistan," Har
rison said. "There is also material
coming out of the People's Repub
lic of China, which was previously
held in Tibet."
Harrison added that the Bud
dhist manuscript project will con
tribute to a better understanding of
the Buddhist tradition from both
the perspectives of the Buddhist
scholar and practitioner, which are
becoming more integrated, he said.
According to Harrison, many schol
ars are also practitioners who have
an insider's perspective on the tra
dition. At the same time, he said,
practitioners who read research
benefit from new analyses and
translations of the texts.
"It's not as if the two worlds are
entirely separate," he said.
Harrison added that the Center
holds events that expose students to
the practitioner's perspective.
"I think [students] should have
some appreciation of what Bud
dhism is like as a living tradition,"
he said. "It's not just something

that's dead and pinned to the wall
like a butterfly."
According to Bielefeldt in an
