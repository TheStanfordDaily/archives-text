If you try to reach Daniel
Haarburger 'l4 on his cell
phone and he doesn't auto
matically relegate your call to
voicemail, his reply will in
variably be a businesslike, "Hi. This

is Daniel."
This professional response is not
the result of a lack of social where
withal, but is rather the upshot of
the fact that he receives business
calls on a regular basis. While the
rest of the student body has been
enjoying The Dish at Arrillaga and
bemoaning the onset of rain season,
this Boulder, Colo, native and soon
to be product design major has been

and will be for the rest of fall
quarter in his home state, attend
ing meetings with potential in
vestors and courting large retailers
interested in his most recent brain
child the WlNGStand.

The WlNGStand is an injection
molded clip made from recycled
plastic, which allows one to attach
most portable devices to an Apple
wireless keyboard. It garnered
recognition from WIRED and a
host of other technology review
websites and received $58,869 in
seed money from 1,485 backers
far exceeding the original target of
$9,600.

The WlNGStand isn't Haar
burger's first project.
"I've always been kind of a
builder," Haarburger said in a
phone interview with The Daily.
"Creating things has always made
me happy."
Haarburger received a first
scroll saw at the age of eight, and in
subsequent years he took to simply
"making stuff." However, as he got
older, his love for physical creations
coupled with entrepreneurial drive.
The result was the birth of Mundi
Treeworks in his junior year of high
school, a woodworking company
that uses excess lumber and hard
wood salvaged from large manufac
turers to make cabinets, guitars and

artisan cutting boards sold to cus
tomers throughout Colorado.
His most recent projects have
run the gamut from refugee tents to
bike mounts and an online library
subscription to ebooks and editori
als. He is also pursuing Mobile
Change, a system that would utilize
cell phones to create a direct link
between debtors and loan providers
and the Buetos Backpack, a back
packing bag for adventure travel
ling.
However, many of those projects
were put on hold after the advent of
the WlNGStand, which, ironically,
started out as a side project.
"I had received an iPad for
Christmas, and I wanted a bit more
functionality considering that I was

n't really using it at all. So I created
the WlNGStand as something for
personal use," Haarburger said. "It
turns out that it was a product peo
ple actually wanted."
The enterprise quickly snow
balled as Haarburger received re
quests from personal acquaintances
for the innovative product, which
led him to believe that it could be a
success in a very specific and little
exploited niche in the accessory
market. The closest competition
was a few less-ergonomic keyboard
docks. Using Kickstarter, a funding
platform for creative projects and
the help of a couple close friends
and advisors, Haarburger created
the WlNGStand.

"It was very easy to execute," he
said. "The other projects that I was
working on required a lot of upfront
capital... the WlNGstand project
only needed a few thousand dollars
in seed money."
Today, an injection molding
company based in Olney, 111. is
churning out WlNGStands to sup
ply mounting orders, and Haar
burger is looking to take advantage
of the holidays to generate the pro
ceeds with which he plans to build a
brand and fund future products.
