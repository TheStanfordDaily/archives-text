## ON THE MARGINS, BETWEEN THE LINES Being depressed at Stanford 
### Jamie Solomon 
According to the National
College Depression Part
nership, approximately one
in eight students will suffer from de
pression during college. I am one of
them. Although dealing with this has
been the most difficult thing I've
ever had to do, Stanford has been an
amazing community to be a part of
during this struggle. Once I recog
nized my depression and sought
help, I found both Stanford students
and teachers to be incredibly sup
portive, as well as an abundance of
institutional support from the
school. I want to share the resources
that I've used both to commend
Stanford for its supportive environ
ment and to share with other stu
dents that may be floundering how
I've made my way through school.
My biggest ally in this journey
has been the Office of Accessible
Education. The staff allows people
with mental illnesses (and other dis
abilities) to sign up with their office
to request academic accommoda
tions. The fact that Stanford has an
office that helps students with de
pression navigate through the aca
demic difficulties they face speaks
volumes about how seriously Stan
ford takes mental health problems. I
have signed up with this office, re
quested accommodations from my
professors (permission to resched
ule tests, turn in work late and
arrange incompletes) and taken a
reduced load (which unfortunately
affects financial aid and scholarship
money), all of which have helped me
to complete schoolwork and classes
that I otherwise could not have.

When I have discussed my de
pression with professors (a good
thing to do before issues arise), they
have all been incredibly caring.
Most of them have told me that they
or someone close to them has also
dealt with depression, so they un
derstand how hard it is. They have
generally been willing to do what
they can to help me by granting me
accommodations. I've been pointed
towards Stanford's resources
(Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS), OAE, the Bridge)
again and again and professors
check in to make sure that I am get
ting the help I need.
I have only visited CAPS on a
few occasions, so I cannot speak to
the quality of the counseling, but I
have never had trouble getting an
appointment. They also have both
psychiatrists and psychologists so
students have access to both therapy
and medicine (if needed).
When I've had trouble getting
work done and finishing incom
pletes, my academic director and the
academic coaches through Adina
Glickman's office have helped me
figure out how I was going to tackle
my work, which reduced my stress

and lightened my depression when I
felt I could not get my schoolwork
done.
Because I ended up taking so
many incompletes, I was placed on
academic probation. Although that
may sound scary, it's just away for
the University to identify students
that are having trouble and to get
them the help they need. I had to
meet with my advisor and talk with
her about how to get back on track,
including options such as taking
time off. For my needs, we decided
that I should reduce my load to
eight units a quarter, spend time
working on my incompletes, and
continue checking in. Often stu
dents who don't reach out can dis
appear in the masses, but I think it's
great that Stanford has some mech
anisms to find students who are re
ally having trouble to help turn
things around.
Because I'm fairly open about it,
I've told a really wide range of stu
dents that I suffer from depression,
many of whom I'm not that close to.
My candidness has sparked many
conversations in which people who
don't often talk about it have shared
their experiences of depression.
Often it comes as a relief to other
students to be able to talk about
these things in the open. It always
surprises and encourages me to find
out how many other people are hav
ing similar difficulties; I'm currently
taking an extra quarter to finish off
my last three incompletes, some
thing I was loath to do, but through
talking about it I've discovered just
how common this is and that I'm re
ally not alone. I've found amazing
support here by owning my depres
sion, talking to my friends, being up
front and asking for help from teach
ers and taking advantage of the re
sources Stanford has for people with
mental health issues. I have never ex
perienced any social stigma associat
ed with mental illness here or been
treated like anything less than a fully
capable person.
So, despite all of the discussions
about the Stanford duck syndrome
and how difficult it can be to meas
ure up in our culture of achievement,
this is a place that's there for you if
you do find yourself having trouble.
If you are depressed, Stanford's got
your back medically, academically
and socially. All you have to do is ask
for help.

students have access to both therapy
and medicine (if needed).
When I've had trouble getting
work done and finishing incom
pletes, my academic director and the
academic coaches through Adina
Glickman's office have helped me
figure out how I was going to tackle
my work, which reduced my stress

and lightened my depression when I
felt I could not get my schoolwork
done.
Because I ended up taking so
many incompletes, I was placed on
academic probation. Although that
may sound scary, it's just away for
the University to identify students
that are having trouble and to get
them the help they need. I had to
meet with my advisor and talk with
her about how to get back on track,
including options such as taking
time off. For my needs, we decided
that I should reduce my load to
eight units a quarter, spend time
working on my incompletes, and
continue checking in. Often stu
dents who don't reach out can dis
appear in the masses, but I think it's
great that Stanford has some mech
anisms to find students who are re
ally having trouble to help turn
things around.
Because I'm fairly open about it,
I've told a really wide range of stu
dents that I suffer from depression,
many of whom I'm not that close to.
My candidness has sparked many
conversations in which people who
don't often talk about it have shared
their experiences of depression.
Often it comes as a relief to other
students to be able to talk about
these things in the open. It always
surprises and encourages me to find
out how many other people are hav
ing similar difficulties; I'm currently
taking an extra quarter to finish off
my last three incompletes, some
thing I was loath to do, but through
talking about it I've discovered just
how common this is and that I'm re
ally not alone. I've found amazing
support here by owning my depres
sion, talking to my friends, being up
front and asking for help from teach
ers and taking advantage of the re
sources Stanford has for people with
mental health issues. I have never ex
perienced any social stigma associat
ed with mental illness here or been
treated like anything less than a fully
capable person.
So, despite all of the discussions
about the Stanford duck syndrome
and how difficult it can be to meas
ure up in our culture of achievement,
this is a place that's there for you if
you do find yourself having trouble.
If you are depressed, Stanford's got
your back medically, academically
and socially. All you have to do is ask
for help.
