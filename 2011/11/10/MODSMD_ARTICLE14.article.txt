# DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
## Hi Ho, Hi Ho, it's off to work we go 
### Leslie Brian 
I live in a co-op. You may have
heard of them. They're those "re
ally grimy, dirty houses on cam
pus where people don't shower and
grow excessively long body hair."
Or at least, that's what they are to
those who have been too frightened
by the prospect of dirt to actually
walk inside.

But here's where I separate fact
from fiction. Yes, I've never had to
wait in line for one of five showers
in Columbae (interpret as you will),
but no, we are not Neanderthals,
more related to apes than humans.
In fact, I'm going to make a bold
statement. After having spent a
year in a freshman dorm followed
by a housed sorority, Columbae is
by far the cleanest of the three.
No, really. I'm dead serious.
Okay, maybe it's all psychological,
but hear me out.

For those of you completely un
familiar with the co-op lifestyle, let
me break it down. Life in a co-op
means no cleaning staff and no chef.
Through a system of weekly and bi
weekly jobs, we do all of our own
chores. It doesn't really matter what
individual job you sign up for
whether it's scrubbing the wood
block after lunch or tidying the
common area or cooking dinner;
taken all together, the job system
ensures that daily life in the house
runs smoothly.

As someone who never did her
own laundry growing up, I had the
sudden realization in college that
dirty clothes would well stay
dirty if I didn't wash them myself.
Living in a co-op has taught me the
same lesson about cooking and
cleaning. Plates that aren't washed
stay unwashed. Common areas that
collect clutter stay cluttered. And
toilets that don't get scrubbed ...
let me just say that they get really
gross.

How long does it really take to
wash out your cereal bowl in the
morning before running off to
class? Not long enough to make you
significantly later, but just long
enough to justify leaving it for
someone else. And once the first
dirty dish is left in the sink, forget
trying to stave off the tide of dirty
dishes that will follow in its foot
steps. Unfortunately, that's the
reigning mentality in most houses:
creating a mess entitles you to be
queath cleaning it to someone else.
Most people clean their own rooms
when necessary, but when it comes
to the kitchen or the lounge, the
tragedy of the commons is hard at
play. And why wouldn't it be, when
messes magically disappear
overnight with the arrival of the
cleaning staff in the morning?
There's no way to prevent mess
es or clutter. After all, we're college
students! We're bound to raid the
pantries at all hours and scatter
crumbs all over the floor, drop our
books in the computer cluster and
then forget about them or amass
upwards of 20 cups in our rooms.
That part will never change. It's how
you deal with the mess that makes
all the difference.

Things are far from perfect in co
ops. I'll be the first to admit that
neat freaks might want to reconsid
er pre-assigning to Columbae. But
from everything I've seen, people in
co-ops take more pride in their liv
ing space than most anywhere else.
Maybe we don't clean up our mess
es as well as a maid might, but in
general, co-op residents have
learned to take ownership of the in
dividual impact they can have on
the community. It's the job system
that kick-starts this incredible com
munity buy-in. Instead of hating
cleaning up, people learn to love the
sound of "Hobart!" as a sign to flock

to the kitchen and help unload dish
es and silverware. Weekly cleaners
blast music and sing as they wash
pots. Dinner cook crews have life
chats while chopping carrots. Ideal
ly, the system creates a community
of individuals who wash their dishes
not because they have to, but be
cause they truly care about respect
ing not only their own living space,
but that of all other 50 residents.

You'd think people would free
ride, but somehow, they generally
don't. Shirking your weekly job
makes you look bad in front of all
your peers. Furthermore, as much as
the time commitment is hard, the
satisfaction makes up for it. Whenev
er you make a positive impact on the
house, you feel a sense of connection
to your community. These small ac
tions on the part of individuals on
behalf of the whole are what makes
co-ops not just survive, but thrive.
Last Tuesday, I spent approxi
mately six hours baking English
muffins for the house. And while I
cursed my life flipping 250 individ
ual balls of dough over a hot griddle
at 1 a.m., there was nothing like the
feeling of satisfaction after I had
pulled the last batch out of the oven.
Knowing that you that you defied
the laws of physics and made this
chaotic universe a little less chaotic
(take that, Newton's second law!) is,
in a word, awesome.
