Today's tip is guaranteed to
make you cooler. Or maybe
make you a hipster. Probably
both.
DO: Listen to Childish Gambino
DOO-DOO: Do The Cha-Cha
Slide
I'm usually not into rap, but I've
been spinning the new Childish
Gambino album all week. (When I
say I'm not into rap, I mean I don't
know how to listen to it. I know
you're supposed to make an angry
face, bob your head and drop some
"uh's" and "mmh's" here and there,
but I still look like an Orange Coun
ty Asian Kid Trying To Be A White
Kid Trying To Be A Black Kid while
doing it.)
Childish Gambino is the rap
moniker of actor-comedian Don
ald Glover, most famous for play
ing Troy on NBC's Community
and writing for NBC's 30 Rock.
(Ya, that's right. Pop culture
columns two weeks in a row. You
can stop reading now, Grandma.
Sorry about it.) I would highly rec
ommend Glover's commercial
debut album, CAMP, to anyone
that enjoys music and isn't easily
offended by offensive language,
suggestive lyrics, racist and homo
phobic slurs, or tracks that will
make you poke your roommate
while he's sleeping and say, "Yo,
these beats iz tiiiiight!" (In
Glover's defense, most of the
derogatory titles are satirically di
rected toward himself.)
Thematically, the album is about
searching for identity. Glover, a
black rapper, dishes about the diffi

culties of not belonging; being "too
white" for the black community, but
still not being white. He raps, "No
live shows, cause I can't find spon
sors/ For the only black kid at a Suf
jan concert."Furthermore,he refers
to himself as "the only white rapper
who's allowed to say the n-word."

There's also the element of
Glover being a crossover act. While
he's been releasing music for the
last three years, he fears people
view his music as a secondary gim
mick to compliment his primary
role as a comedian. (As for come
dian, he has a hilarious bit about
how he had to change his Twitter
name from @DonGlover because
people kept calling him "Dong
Lover.") He wants to be respected
as a musician, and not as a gim
mick, saying "I used to get more
laughs when I got laughed at/ Oh
you got a mixtape? 'That's fantas
tic.'"

And I can relate with the funda
mental question of identity, the dif
ficulty in negotiating "How People
Perceive Me" against "How I Want
To Be Perceived" against "Who I
Actually Am." More often than
not, how I want to be perceived by
others is a direct response to my
fear of how others perceive me,
and neither honestly depicts who I
am.

I don't own Stanford clothes. No
sweatshirts, no shirts, no nothing.
(And not just because it's
#NoShirtNovember.) Pre-admis
sion to Stanford, I remember see
ing students from elite colleges
strutting around in their school

paraphernalia acting like snobby,
elitist . (It's a mad-

lib. Feel free to write in your best,
nastiest derogatory word in the
comments section online. Winner
gets a prize!)

So I don't wear Stanford clothes
for fear people will think I'm a
snobby, elitist [insert same word].
Is it illogical? Probably. Does the
logic fall apart even more once I'm
on campus surrounded by thou
sands of (mostly) humble and
kind-hearted people? Definitely.
It's dangerous to allow your
fears and desires dictate who you
are. If you place your identity in
being successful, you'll hold onto
success like it's your life (because
in away it is now.) You may start
only seeing people as obstacles to
reaching your goal or as stepping
stones to boost you higher. It works
for anything. If you place your
identity in beauty or good looks,
you'll start doing everything to
keep it (until you're a plastic
Botox'd vegetable owned by Ar
mani.) Worse, you start valuing
others for how they fit into your
shallow scale of worth.

I have a deep desire to be cre
ative and rebellious to be an in
dividual which is not bad in it
self. But when I refuse to do the
Cha-Cha Slide dance when the
song comes on because "I'm an in

dividual" and don't want to dance
like everyone else, then it becomes
prideful and stupid. (However, I
also think it's a brainwashing tool
by the government to make hu
mans accustomed to taking orders
from robots.)
Donald Glover raps about how
he can get any girl he wants (like
every other rapper ever does). But
he gets really vulnerable when he

admits that after whatever sexual
conquest with whatever girl, he
never gets what he really wants.The
problem with rooting our identity in
our fears or our desires is that both
eventually fracture and fall away.
And then who is left?
