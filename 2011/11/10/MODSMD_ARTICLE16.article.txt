## Slow your roll a bit, BCS haters 
### Jack Blanchat 
It's that time of year again: the last
few weeks of the college football
regular season, when the daily
whining and moaning about the
BCS's inequities reaches a fever
pitch.
For the second year in a row, Stan
ford fans have had the good fortune of
being active participants in this conver
sation. (Isn't it much more fun to com
plain about the BCS when your team is
actually in the hunt for one?)
But this week, after Stanford pol
ished off Oregon State to extend its
record to 9-0 and Alabama fell to LSU
in overtime, the Crimson Tide still
stayed ahead of the Cardinal in the lat
est BCS standings Stanford sat at num
ber four, Alabama dropped from two to
three.
This of course, provoked some vitri
olic reaction from the Cardinal faithful,
who maintained that it was unjust for
Bama to keep its high ranking despite
losing a 9-6 snooze-fest at home.
A fantastic example of this outrage
can be found in Wednesday's San Fran
cisco Chronicle, where columnist Bruce
Jenkins calls out the BCS for giving
Stanford "absolutely no respect." Clear
ly, Jenkins says the BCS has a pro-SEC
bias that is conspiring to keep Stanford
out of the title game and rig an Alaba
ma-LSU rematch in New Orleans on
Jan. 9.
I don't encourage you to go and read
the whole column it appears to have
been written while he was under the in
fluence of bath salts â€”but let's look at a
few choice quotes:
First: "You can't get robbed if there's
no money in the safe, but the burglars
are circling Stanford's football program.
They're wearing BCS sweatshirts and
singing fight songs from the Southeast
em Conference."
Next: "In other words, go ahead,
West Coast teams, run up an impressive
record in a conference rich in talent.
We'll continue to be bribed sorry, in
fluenced by the SEC people."
And finally:"lt's possible that if Stan
ford beats Oregon, it could jump ahead
of Alabama because the Cardinal's
schedule will have gained some teeth."
An epic takedown, right? Feel your
blood boiling? Ready to storm the
warehouse where the BCS Uluminati
conspire create the rankings?
Not so fast, my fellow Stanford fans.
Don't fall into groupthink with Jenkins
Let me assure you: There is absolutely
no reason at all to get upset about one
week of injustice in the BCS.
While I agree that Bama should
have fallen beneath the teams that re
mained undefeated (except for Boise
State), the bottom line, no matter what
happens this Saturday, is that this week's
BCS standings won't matter anyway.
If Stanford loses, it will fall well be
hind Alabama (and the one-loss Ducks)
in the BCS standings. If Stanford wins, it
will easily leapfrog the Tide. It's not just
"possible," as Jenkins suggests. If the
Cardinal pulls off its biggest win of the
season, it will, without a doubt, pass the
Tide.
Second, suggesting that prejudice
prevents a West Coast team from sur
passing an SEC team is simply not true.
Look a little further down the BCS
standings, and you'll notice that Oregon,
after an unimpressive win over Wash
ington, leapfrogged Arkansas, which
beat No. 9 South Carolina by 16 points
on Saturday. Looks like the work of pro-
SEC conspirators to me, Shaggy.
So ease off those online message
boards and step back for a minute, Stan
ford fans. Remember, there's no need to
be upset. If your favorite team takes
care of business this weekend, all it will
need to do to assure itself a shot at a na
tional championship is to win out and
have Oklahoma State fall on its face.
But don't take the Chicken Little ap
proach to things just because Alabama
is still microscopically ahead in the
standings with four weeks of football
left to be played.
Instead, keep in mind the words of
Stanford head coach David Shaw.
"The BCS ranking has absolutely no
bearing on what happens on Satur
days," he said on Tuesday. "It only mat
ters when all the regular-season and
conference-championship games are
over, because that's when you decide
what bowl games you go to. Up until
then, it's a TV show."
Wise words for every Stanford fan
myself included to keep in mind
as this season winds to its dramatic close.
