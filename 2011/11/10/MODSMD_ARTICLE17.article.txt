# MAKING THE CALLS
## Shaw, Hamilton, Bloomgren craft nation's third-best offense 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Over the last several years,much has
been made of the Oregon Ducks' in
novative, electric offense. Unique
formations, placards with weird pic
tures, a breakneck pace and lopsided
point totals more befitting a basketball score
board have made the Ducks' offense the fascina
tion of fans and the media.
But take a look at the Pac-12 statistics, and
you'll see that the Ducks' offense is looking up at
one squad: the Stanford Cardinal.

Oregon averages 46 points per game, the fifth
most in the nation. Stanford checks in at 48.2
points per game, third-best in the country and
its offense couldn't be any more different from
the Ducks.
Three tight ends, seven offensive linemen, few
spread formations. The highest time of possession
in the conference. No funny pictures. No need for
You Tube videos that explain the offense. Just re
sults.
So how does one of the nation's most potent
offenses come together without the flashy style
and weird formations the Ducks have made so
popular?
The answer lies somewhere among the brains
of Stanford head coach David Shaw, offensive co

ordinator Pep Hamilton and run-game coordina
tor Mike Bloomgren the trio of NFL-tested
play-callers who work together to craft the Cardi
nal's offensive plan.
Shaw, the Cardinal's first-year head coach,
hand selected Bloomgren and Hamilton to work
with when he was creating his offensive staff last
year, promoting Hamilton from his position as
wide receiver coach and pulling Bloomgren from
the New York Jets' staff. Together, the three bring
21 years of NFL coaching experience and three
inimitable but compatible viewpoints to the table.
"We don't exist in three different worlds, the
head coach, the pass game guy and the run game
