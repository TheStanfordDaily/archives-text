# MAKING THE CALLS
## Shaw, Hamilton, Bloomgren craft nation's third-best offense 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
Over the last several years,much has
been made of the Oregon Ducks' in
novative, electric offense. Unique
formations, placards with weird pic
tures, a breakneck pace and lopsided
point totals more befitting a basketball score
board have made the Ducks' offense the fascina
tion of fans and the media.
But take a look at the Pac-12 statistics, and
you'll see that the Ducks' offense is looking up at
one squad: the Stanford Cardinal.

Oregon averages 46 points per game, the fifth
most in the nation. Stanford checks in at 48.2
points per game, third-best in the country and
its offense couldn't be any more different from
the Ducks.
Three tight ends, seven offensive linemen, few
spread formations. The highest time of possession
in the conference. No funny pictures. No need for
You Tube videos that explain the offense. Just re
sults.
So how does one of the nation's most potent
offenses come together without the flashy style
and weird formations the Ducks have made so
popular?
The answer lies somewhere among the brains
of Stanford head coach David Shaw, offensive co

ordinator Pep Hamilton and run-game coordina
tor Mike Bloomgren the trio of NFL-tested
play-callers who work together to craft the Cardi
nal's offensive plan.
Shaw, the Cardinal's first-year head coach,
hand selected Bloomgren and Hamilton to work
with when he was creating his offensive staff last
year, promoting Hamilton from his position as
wide receiver coach and pulling Bloomgren from
the New York Jets' staff. Together, the three bring
21 years of NFL coaching experience and three
inimitable but compatible viewpoints to the table.
"We don't exist in three different worlds, the
head coach, the pass game guy and the run game


MICHAEL LIU/The Stanford Daily
guy," Shaw says. "But I think the
biggest thing is, we've got outstand
ing communication. We, by the end
of the week, we make it all fit, so that
there's not separate parts of our of
fense. It all fits together."
Bloomgren, on the other hand.

praises his boss for creating an envi
ronment that allows the offense to be
successful.
"We all work together very well,
and I think that's unique because
I've been places where that wasn't
the case," he says. "I think that all
starts with Coach Shaw. He's so easy
to work for and so good, he has great
knowledge of the running game as
well as the passing game, he'll
bounce ideas off of both of us and we
get together on a Monday night, and
we kind of throw it all in a pot and
see what's worth looking at."
Together, they've spawned a Car
dinal offense that is powerful, bal
anced and efficient averaging
over 500 yards of offense a game and
in the top 25 nationally in both pass
ing and rushing yards per game. Ad
ditionally, under the tutelage of
Hamilton, the team's red zone guru,
Stanford has scored every single
time it has been to the red zone this
season a perfect 52-for-52 the
only team in college football to do so
this year.

The offense they've created di
rectly reflects each coach's experi
ence at the pro level, Bloomgren
says, and gives them a chance to suc
ceed because teams are unprepared
to handle a team that uses a NFL
style offense.
"People are preparing for the
spread more and more these days
and building their defenses around
it," he says. "So when we have the
opportunity to bring them into our
phone booth and put seven linemen
out there and say, now you have to
fight us right here, we've done okay
with that."

Shaw also highlighted how his
own time going against top-tier de
fenses prepared him to create his
own offense.

"I spent four years at the Balti
more Ravens playing against, for a
year, a [Dolphins defensive coordi

nator] Mike Nolan defense, and then
for three years, a [Jets head coach]
Rex Ryan defense. It was hard," he
says. "Every single day, you better
have multiple answers, you better
have protection issues, and I'm talk
ing about the offseason â€” you're
just trying to get through a spring
practice against Rex, because every
single play is a blitz ... So you learn
how to diagnose your own offense
against the worst possible looks."
On game day, the coaches' collab
orative effort all goes into a game
plan that could contain up to 300
plays, according to senior wide re
ceiver Griff Whalen. Shaw and
Bloomgren patrol the sidelines
while Hamilton takes a bird's-eye
view from the coaches' box to give
himself a more complete perspec
tive.

"I'll tell you that's one big differ
ence for me, being in college ball as
opposed to the NFL, you don't have
those pictures in between series,"
Hamilton says. "You have Polaroids
in the NFL so you can get a better
idea of what they're doing and how
we need to adjust, but we don't have
that luxury in the NFL, so I have a
better vantage point in the box."
Bloomgren also says that his ex
perience in the NFL has made it
hard for him on the sidelines at
times.

"You get so spoiled by [the Po
laroids] in the NFL in confirming
what you think you saw," he says.
"Down at USC in the first half, they
didn't have the jumbotron replaying
plays, and I felt so lost, because that's
what I've leaned on all year. If I miss
something or think I saw something
and I need to confirm it, I just get my
eyes on the j umbotron after we make
the next call."

Each play call goes to quarter
back Andrew Luck directly from
Shaw, who Hamilton says has "the ul
timate veto power" for any sugges

tion, although he doesn't exercise
that authority very often.
"He trusts in our preparation as a
staff and the plays that make the [of
fensive] menu," Hamilton says.
Together, the three play-callers
have the ability to suggest a new plan
of attack at any time, even when it
might fall under another coaches'
point of expertise.
"Red zone in particular is one of
the many areas that I take charge of,"
Hamilton says. "But we all have
input as to what schemes we use
down in the red zone, it's not just my
ideas or my brainchild."
Bloomgren does take a little cred
it for himself when it comes to one set
of plays in particular that are new in
the Stanford playbook this year.
"I had the opportunity to do our
whole Wildcat package [with the
New York Jets]," he says. "We called
it the Seminole package in New
York, and that was kind of my baby
there."

So while the Stanford offense
might not have many of the unusual
bells and whistles of the Ducks' mul
tifaceted attack, Shaw says that the
team's success is a testament to the
quality of his coaches.
"I give those guys a lot of credit
being able to come back and put it all
together, so that, number one, it
makes sense for our players," Shaw
says. "Because we can go up there
and try to be gurus and geniuses and
confuse the heck out of our guys, but
we make it accessible to them to help
them play fast and do things, hopeful
ly, that make sense."
In the end, the results are all that
really matters, right?

The Cardinal and Ducks will
match up their high-powered offens
es on Saturday at 5 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium.

you'll see that the Ducks' offense is looking up at
one squad: the Stanford Cardinal.

Oregon averages 46 points per game, the fifth
most in the nation. Stanford checks in at 48.2
points per game, third-best in the country and
its offense couldn't be any more different from
the Ducks.
Three tight ends, seven offensive linemen, few
spread formations. The highest time of possession
in the conference. No funny pictures. No need for
You Tube videos that explain the offense. Just re
sults.
So how does one of the nation's most potent
offenses come together without the flashy style
and weird formations the Ducks have made so
popular?
The answer lies somewhere among the brains
of Stanford head coach David Shaw, offensive co

ordinator Pep Hamilton and run-game coordina
tor Mike Bloomgren the trio of NFL-tested
play-callers who work together to craft the Cardi
nal's offensive plan.
Shaw, the Cardinal's first-year head coach,
hand selected Bloomgren and Hamilton to work
with when he was creating his offensive staff last
year, promoting Hamilton from his position as
wide receiver coach and pulling Bloomgren from
the New York Jets' staff. Together, the three bring
21 years of NFL coaching experience and three
inimitable but compatible viewpoints to the table.
"We don't exist in three different worlds, the
head coach, the pass game guy and the run game


MICHAEL LIU/The Stanford Daily
guy," Shaw says. "But I think the
biggest thing is, we've got outstand
ing communication. We, by the end
of the week, we make it all fit, so that
there's not separate parts of our of
fense. It all fits together."
Bloomgren, on the other hand.

praises his boss for creating an envi
ronment that allows the offense to be
successful.
"We all work together very well,
and I think that's unique because
I've been places where that wasn't
the case," he says. "I think that all
starts with Coach Shaw. He's so easy
to work for and so good, he has great
knowledge of the running game as
well as the passing game, he'll
bounce ideas off of both of us and we
get together on a Monday night, and
we kind of throw it all in a pot and
see what's worth looking at."
Together, they've spawned a Car
dinal offense that is powerful, bal
anced and efficient averaging
over 500 yards of offense a game and
in the top 25 nationally in both pass
ing and rushing yards per game. Ad
ditionally, under the tutelage of
Hamilton, the team's red zone guru,
Stanford has scored every single
time it has been to the red zone this
season a perfect 52-for-52 the
only team in college football to do so
this year.

The offense they've created di
rectly reflects each coach's experi
ence at the pro level, Bloomgren
says, and gives them a chance to suc
ceed because teams are unprepared
to handle a team that uses a NFL
style offense.
"People are preparing for the
spread more and more these days
and building their defenses around
it," he says. "So when we have the
opportunity to bring them into our
phone booth and put seven linemen
out there and say, now you have to
fight us right here, we've done okay
with that."

Shaw also highlighted how his
own time going against top-tier de
fenses prepared him to create his
own offense.

"I spent four years at the Balti
more Ravens playing against, for a
year, a [Dolphins defensive coordi

nator] Mike Nolan defense, and then
for three years, a [Jets head coach]
Rex Ryan defense. It was hard," he
says. "Every single day, you better
have multiple answers, you better
have protection issues, and I'm talk
ing about the offseason â€” you're
just trying to get through a spring
practice against Rex, because every
single play is a blitz ... So you learn
how to diagnose your own offense
against the worst possible looks."
On game day, the coaches' collab
orative effort all goes into a game
plan that could contain up to 300
plays, according to senior wide re
ceiver Griff Whalen. Shaw and
Bloomgren patrol the sidelines
while Hamilton takes a bird's-eye
view from the coaches' box to give
himself a more complete perspec
tive.

"I'll tell you that's one big differ
ence for me, being in college ball as
opposed to the NFL, you don't have
those pictures in between series,"
Hamilton says. "You have Polaroids
in the NFL so you can get a better
idea of what they're doing and how
we need to adjust, but we don't have
that luxury in the NFL, so I have a
better vantage point in the box."
Bloomgren also says that his ex
perience in the NFL has made it
hard for him on the sidelines at
times.

"You get so spoiled by [the Po
laroids] in the NFL in confirming
what you think you saw," he says.
"Down at USC in the first half, they
didn't have the jumbotron replaying
plays, and I felt so lost, because that's
what I've leaned on all year. If I miss
something or think I saw something
and I need to confirm it, I just get my
eyes on the j umbotron after we make
the next call."

Each play call goes to quarter
back Andrew Luck directly from
Shaw, who Hamilton says has "the ul
timate veto power" for any sugges

tion, although he doesn't exercise
that authority very often.
"He trusts in our preparation as a
staff and the plays that make the [of
fensive] menu," Hamilton says.
Together, the three play-callers
have the ability to suggest a new plan
of attack at any time, even when it
might fall under another coaches'
point of expertise.
"Red zone in particular is one of
the many areas that I take charge of,"
Hamilton says. "But we all have
input as to what schemes we use
down in the red zone, it's not just my
ideas or my brainchild."
Bloomgren does take a little cred
it for himself when it comes to one set
of plays in particular that are new in
the Stanford playbook this year.
"I had the opportunity to do our
whole Wildcat package [with the
New York Jets]," he says. "We called
it the Seminole package in New
York, and that was kind of my baby
there."

So while the Stanford offense
might not have many of the unusual
bells and whistles of the Ducks' mul
tifaceted attack, Shaw says that the
team's success is a testament to the
quality of his coaches.
"I give those guys a lot of credit
being able to come back and put it all
together, so that, number one, it
makes sense for our players," Shaw
says. "Because we can go up there
and try to be gurus and geniuses and
confuse the heck out of our guys, but
we make it accessible to them to help
them play fast and do things, hopeful
ly, that make sense."
In the end, the results are all that
really matters, right?

The Cardinal and Ducks will
match up their high-powered offens
es on Saturday at 5 p.m. in Stanford
Stadium.
