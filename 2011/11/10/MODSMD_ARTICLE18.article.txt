## Matchup with Oregon sends ticket prices up 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Supporters of college football's
Bowl Championship Series often
argue that while the ranking system
has its flaws, it makes every
matchup more exciting by turning
them all into playoff games.
Last weekend's LSU-Alabama
clash may have been the Super
Bowl of the college season
100,000-plus screaming fans made
Tuscaloosa seem more like Lolla
palooza. But this week, the spotlight
is fixated on the Farm, and the
matchup between No. 4 Stanford
and No. 6 Oregon is the hottest tick

et around.
Prices for the game have spiked
in the last three weeks, jumping
from an average price of $174 per
ticket all the way to a peak of $420
per ticket this week. All told, there
has been a 300-percent price in
crease for sales through secondary
ticketing sites since September.
Will Flaherty is the Director of
Communications at Seat Geek.com,
a sporting event and concert ticket
search engine that promotes its
"data-driven ticket search," allow
ing users to look at prices from over
50 secondary ticket sites like Stub-
Hub, e√üay and RazorGatos.
Flaherty noticed some remark

able trends when he examined the
data for Saturday's game, particu
larly considering the enormous
spike in demand in the immediate
lead-up to game day.
"If you had bought tickets to this
game in August, or even early Sep
tember, you could have gotten in for

$lOO dollars no problem," he said.
"Now you're seeing prices that are
putting it right in the rarefied air
that usually is reserved only for the
fiercest rivalry games and things
like LSU-Alabama."
