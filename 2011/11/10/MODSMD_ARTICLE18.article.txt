## Matchup with Oregon sends ticket prices up 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
Supporters of college football's
Bowl Championship Series often
argue that while the ranking system
has its flaws, it makes every
matchup more exciting by turning
them all into playoff games.
Last weekend's LSU-Alabama
clash may have been the Super
Bowl of the college season
100,000-plus screaming fans made
Tuscaloosa seem more like Lolla
palooza. But this week, the spotlight
is fixated on the Farm, and the
matchup between No. 4 Stanford
and No. 6 Oregon is the hottest tick

et around.
Prices for the game have spiked
in the last three weeks, jumping
from an average price of $174 per
ticket all the way to a peak of $420
per ticket this week. All told, there
has been a 300-percent price in
crease for sales through secondary
ticketing sites since September.
Will Flaherty is the Director of
Communications at Seat Geek.com,
a sporting event and concert ticket
search engine that promotes its
"data-driven ticket search," allow
ing users to look at prices from over
50 secondary ticket sites like Stub-
Hub, eßay and RazorGatos.
Flaherty noticed some remark

able trends when he examined the
data for Saturday's game, particu
larly considering the enormous
spike in demand in the immediate
lead-up to game day.
"If you had bought tickets to this
game in August, or even early Sep
tember, you could have gotten in for

$lOO dollars no problem," he said.
"Now you're seeing prices that are
putting it right in the rarefied air
that usually is reserved only for the
fiercest rivalry games and things
like LSU-Alabama."

The game has cornered the sec
ondary ticket market in terms of
price, with weekly averages mirror
ing those of USC and Notre Dame's
annual meeting, the Iron Bowl be
tween Alabama and Auburn, and
last year's LSU-Bama brawl in
Baton Rouge.
With ESPN's College Game Day
making its first-ever trip to Palo Alto
to cover the game, both teams
ranked in the top six, compelling fig
ures on both sides of the ball in An
drew Luck and LaMichael James, as
well as national championship im
plications, it comes as little surprise
that prices have jumped up.

But few at Stanford are used to
seeing the glass ceiling shattered in
such a manner, from players on the
football team to older students that
remember the half-empty stadiums
of four and five years ago.
"It's great to see [demand for
tickets so high]," said junior running
back Stepfan Taylor. "I didn't know
how much tickets were selling for,
but that's amazing and really a testa
ment to the players that we have and
what we came and have fought to
gether for.
"We want the crowds coming to
the games, I guess high-priced tick
ets means people are coming to see
us," he said.

Also remarkable were the man
ner and speed with which the prices
moved. On Monday, the average
ticket price was up to $3Bl dollars,
peaking on Tuesday morning at
around $420 per ticket.

Ticket volume the number of
tickets actually sold was two
times greater on Saturday night than
it was a day earlier, according to Fla
herty, as both the Ducks and Cardi
nal won their respective games to set
up the showdown.
"People have had this date cir
cled on calendars for months," Fla
herty said, "Maybe even since the
second that Andrew Luck declared
he'd come back for his senior year.
Pac-12 fans everywhere knew that
was probably the game of the season
in the conference, and now it's get
ting recognition around the coun
try."

And while LSU-Alabama still
ended up with much higher prices
overall the cheapest tickets dur
ing the final week of buildup to that
game were selling for a little under
$4OO dollars a pop it will still cost

you upwards of $2OO to get in the
door on Saturday night.
That price spiked dramatically, as
you could still find a few tickets for
under $lOO dollars on Sunday and
even Monday evening. But by Tues
day at noon, General Admission
tickets were up to $125, and five
hours later they'd risen to $l6O. On
Wednesday afternoon, the cheapest
tickets on Seat Geek were going for
$225 tickets that had a face value
of about $3O dollars.
David Vargas, Stanford's director
of football marketing, said that al
though this game is clearly a once
in-a-decade event, the numbers
can't be ignored.
"The secondary market is not a
fad," he said, "It's a reality. When
people are buying tickets at $320 it
says that there is enough appetite
and discretionary income to afford
those prices. From our marketing
perspective, that isn't our objective,
to raise costs. We want a full house
and a great experience, and we will
get that Saturday."
When compared to many of the
traditional football powerhouses,
Stanford does not have a very large
alumni base to draw support from,
and what alumni it does have are
more dispersed geographically,
making for a tough environment.

But Stanford Stadium has a ca
pacity of 50,000 fans, half as many as
can cram into Bryant-Denny Stadi
um at Alabama, and demand has
certainly exceeded supply for what
is going to be just the eighth sellout
in the five years since the University
renovated the old Stanford Stadi
um, knocking out 35,000 seats in the
process.

"We are building the brand of
Stanford Football and have invested
in marketing to extend our reach
and our awareness geographically
more than ever," Vargas added.
"That being said, there is nothing
like a successful team. Winning is the
best deal in the sports world."
As of Wednesday night, the most
expensive tickets for the game were
listed for just over $l,lOO dollars on
Stub Hub, with several tickets al
ready sold in the $7OO-dollar range,
according to Seat Geek.
"It's just awesome," said junior
fullback Ryan Hewitt. "You want to
play in front of a sellout crowd and
you want to play in front of a home
crowd that's there supporting you.
When they turnout and it's a big
game like this, that's all you can real
ly ask for."

is going to be just the eighth sellout
in the five years since the University
renovated the old Stanford Stadi
um, knocking out 35,000 seats in the
process.

"We are building the brand of
Stanford Football and have invested
in marketing to extend our reach
and our awareness geographically
more than ever," Vargas added.
"That being said, there is nothing
like a successful team. Winning is the
best deal in the sports world."
As of Wednesday night, the most
expensive tickets for the game were
listed for just over $l,lOO dollars on
Stub Hub, with several tickets al
ready sold in the $7OO-dollar range,
according to Seat Geek.
"It's just awesome," said junior
fullback Ryan Hewitt. "You want to
play in front of a sellout crowd and
you want to play in front of a home
crowd that's there supporting you.
When they turnout and it's a big
game like this, that's all you can real
ly ask for."

Supporters of college football's
Bowl Championship Series often
argue that while the ranking system
has its flaws, it makes every
matchup more exciting by turning
them all into playoff games.
Last weekend's LSU-Alabama
clash may have been the Super
Bowl of the college season
100,000-plus screaming fans made
Tuscaloosa seem more like Lolla
palooza. But this week, the spotlight
is fixated on the Farm, and the
matchup between No. 4 Stanford
and No. 6 Oregon is the hottest tick

et around.
Prices for the game have spiked
in the last three weeks, jumping
from an average price of $174 per
ticket all the way to a peak of $420
per ticket this week. All told, there
has been a 300-percent price in
crease for sales through secondary
ticketing sites since September.
Will Flaherty is the Director of
Communications at Seat Geek.com,
a sporting event and concert ticket
search engine that promotes its
"data-driven ticket search," allow
ing users to look at prices from over
50 secondary ticket sites like Stub-
Hub, eßay and RazorGatos.
Flaherty noticed some remark

able trends when he examined the
data for Saturday's game, particu
larly considering the enormous
spike in demand in the immediate
lead-up to game day.
"If you had bought tickets to this
game in August, or even early Sep
tember, you could have gotten in for

$lOO dollars no problem," he said.
"Now you're seeing prices that are
putting it right in the rarefied air
that usually is reserved only for the
fiercest rivalry games and things
like LSU-Alabama."

The game has cornered the sec
ondary ticket market in terms of
price, with weekly averages mirror
ing those of USC and Notre Dame's
annual meeting, the Iron Bowl be
tween Alabama and Auburn, and
last year's LSU-Bama brawl in
Baton Rouge.
With ESPN's College Game Day
making its first-ever trip to Palo Alto
to cover the game, both teams
ranked in the top six, compelling fig
ures on both sides of the ball in An
drew Luck and LaMichael James, as
well as national championship im
plications, it comes as little surprise
that prices have jumped up.

But few at Stanford are used to
seeing the glass ceiling shattered in
such a manner, from players on the
football team to older students that
remember the half-empty stadiums
of four and five years ago.
"It's great to see [demand for
tickets so high]," said junior running
back Stepfan Taylor. "I didn't know
how much tickets were selling for,
but that's amazing and really a testa
ment to the players that we have and
what we came and have fought to
gether for.
"We want the crowds coming to
the games, I guess high-priced tick
ets means people are coming to see
us," he said.

Also remarkable were the man
ner and speed with which the prices
moved. On Monday, the average
ticket price was up to $3Bl dollars,
peaking on Tuesday morning at
around $420 per ticket.

Ticket volume the number of
tickets actually sold was two
times greater on Saturday night than
it was a day earlier, according to Fla
herty, as both the Ducks and Cardi
nal won their respective games to set
up the showdown.
"People have had this date cir
cled on calendars for months," Fla
herty said, "Maybe even since the
second that Andrew Luck declared
he'd come back for his senior year.
Pac-12 fans everywhere knew that
was probably the game of the season
in the conference, and now it's get
ting recognition around the coun
try."

And while LSU-Alabama still
ended up with much higher prices
overall the cheapest tickets dur
ing the final week of buildup to that
game were selling for a little under
$4OO dollars a pop it will still cost

you upwards of $2OO to get in the
door on Saturday night.
That price spiked dramatically, as
you could still find a few tickets for
under $lOO dollars on Sunday and
even Monday evening. But by Tues
day at noon, General Admission
tickets were up to $125, and five
hours later they'd risen to $l6O. On
Wednesday afternoon, the cheapest
tickets on Seat Geek were going for
$225 tickets that had a face value
of about $3O dollars.
David Vargas, Stanford's director
of football marketing, said that al
though this game is clearly a once
in-a-decade event, the numbers
can't be ignored.
"The secondary market is not a
fad," he said, "It's a reality. When
people are buying tickets at $320 it
says that there is enough appetite
and discretionary income to afford
those prices. From our marketing
perspective, that isn't our objective,
to raise costs. We want a full house
and a great experience, and we will
get that Saturday."
When compared to many of the
traditional football powerhouses,
Stanford does not have a very large
alumni base to draw support from,
and what alumni it does have are
more dispersed geographically,
making for a tough environment.

But Stanford Stadium has a ca
pacity of 50,000 fans, half as many as
can cram into Bryant-Denny Stadi
um at Alabama, and demand has
certainly exceeded supply for what
is going to be just the eighth sellout
in the five years since the University
renovated the old Stanford Stadi
um, knocking out 35,000 seats in the
process.
