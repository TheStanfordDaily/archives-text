# PRIDE ON THE LINE IN FINALE

### ISABEL SOSA 
Standing in the last two spots of
the Pac-12, the Cardinal and the
Golden Bears can hardly boast
about their 2011 seasons. Friday af
ternoon, however, the annual Stan
ford-California matchup is bound
to bring out Herculean performanc
es from these long-standing rivals.
Since 2007, the Bears (3-8-5,0-6-
3 Pac-12) have gone undefeated
against the Cardinal (5-10-2,2-6-1),
but after six straight losses against
their Bay Area rival, Stanford final
ly earned a draw at home earlier
this year, in October.
But unlike a month ago, when
the teams came to the field with al
most identical records on Saturday
each had suffered conference
losses to UCLA and San Diego
State the Cardinal will arrive at
Drake Field just slightly ahead of
the Bears.
As returning champions of last
year's Pac-12 conference, UC-
Berkeley has what can only be de
scribed as a very disappointing sea
son this year. The Bears currently sit
in last place in the conference and
have yet to win a single game in Pac
-12 play. The loss of six of their play
ers to the MLS paired with the addi
tion of 10 new freshmen to the ros
ter has taken its toll. However, Stan
ford coach Bret Simon is careful not
to underestimate the Bears.
"The Cal midfield is very strong,
and they have a lot of strong players
in general, they're just young and
haven't found away to win some of
the games they should've, or
could've, won," Simon said.
In fact, he believes that his team
will challenge a different Cal on Fri
day than the one they faced before.
"They have gradually improved
over the course of the season,"
Simon said. "We think they are a
pretty good team even though their
record hasn't been what it normally
might be."
As the Bears' leading scorer and
the author of the header that went
past Stanford's Jason Dodson in the
teams' last encounter, junior John
Fitzpatrick is definitely figure to
watch out for.

"John Fitzpatrick has scored on
us the last couple of games we've

played and he is a strong forward,"
says Simon, "But I don't know that
there's one player we will focus on."
The Cardinal has produced
slightly more favorable outcomes
since it last met Cal. It has amassed
five conference wins, the last of

which was an impressive 4-1 victory
against San Diego State. Even so,
Stanford is only one spot above
Berkeley in conference standing
and has had its share of missed scor
ing opportunities over the season.
Simon, however, doesn't see
conference standings as key for the
upcoming match.
"I don't think that the game will
be impacted by team records.
Games between us and Cal are well
played games, very competitive, and
both teams will want to win very
badly," he said.
In fact, despite the absence of
post-season intrigue, he has high ex
pectations for Friday.
"I think it's going to be a great
game."
The match against Cal is sched
uled to kick off 2 p.m. at Edwards
Stadium in Berkeley.
