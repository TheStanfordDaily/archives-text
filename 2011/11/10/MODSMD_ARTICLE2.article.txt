# Rabushka plays key role in Republican flat tax
## 
### JOSH HOYT STAFF WRITER 
Before Texas Governor Rick
Perry announced that a flat-rate tax
plan would be part of his platform
in his bid for the Republican presi
dential nomination, his campaign
consulted Hoover fellow Alvin
Rabushka.
Rabushka, along with Hoover
fellow Robert E. Hall, popularized
the flat tax idea in the early 1980s,
first in an article in the Wall Street
Journal and later in several books.
While the flat tax has been popular
internationally, having been adopt
ed in Russia and most of Eastern

Europe, it was not a national topic
of debate until Herman Cain began
receiving attention for his 9-9-9 tax
plan.

"Herman Cain made this idea
hot," Rabushka said. "When Cain
didn't go away and because Perry
started to slip. Perry jumped on
board with the flat tax."
While Rabushka said he is excit
ed that Cain reignited the discus
sion and does see the 9-9-9 plan as a
version of the flat tax, he is careful
to distinguish the 9-9-9 plan from
his own vision.

The 9-9-9 plan, as described by
Herman Cain on his blog, is a 9 per
cent tax on business, a 9 percent in

dividual income tax and a 9 percent
national sales tax. On Oct. 21, in a
speech in Detroit, Mich., Cain mod
ified the tax to include an exemp
tion from income tax for house
holds below the poverty level.
In areas of economic hardship
which are given tax exemptions,
such as businesses outside of oppor
tunity zones, Rabushka pointed out
that the business tax exempts busi
ness investments, but does not ex
empt labor expenses. He described
the business tax as essentially "a 9
percent tax on labor."
"In effect what you've got is
labor paying a 9 percent tax, labor
again paying 9 percent on income

above a poverty threshold, and then
again paying 9 percent as con
sumers," Rabushka said.
While Rabushka acknowledged
the 9-9-9 plan as a "simpler, cleaner
system," he believes the plan dis
proportionately taxes labor be
cause of its emphasis on capital in
vestment and saving. Rabushka also
pointed out that some of the addi
tional taxes on labor would be bal
anced out by getting rid of existing
taxes, notably the social security
tax. Rabushka suspects that if Cain
remains in the race, his tax plan will
receive further challenges and will
probably need further tweaks.
"I have read several reputable

analyses of the Cain tax and it
seems that advanced models are
saying that it will lower revenue and
increase the deficit, and that was be
fore he added in a poverty line ex
ception," Rabushka said. "I would
guess he will have to raise it to the
12-12-12 plan or something in that
range."

Rabushka was less able to evalu
ate Perry's tax plan, despite having
direct conversations with Sean
Davis, an economic policy advisor
for the Perry campaign. One of the
major stumbling blocks to evaluat
ing Perry's plan is the choice the
