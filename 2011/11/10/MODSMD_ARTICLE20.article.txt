# NORTHWEST TEST AHEAD
## 
### MIKE SCHWARTZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the Stanford women's vol
leyball team excels at home, its task
this week will be to prove that it can
win on the road with a trip to Wash
ington and Washington State. The
Card cruised to victory at Maples
Pavilion when the teams last met,
dominating both teams in three-set
efforts.
This weekend, the Cardinal

women will be looking to prove that it
was more than the home crowed that
propelled them to victory earlier in
the season. With the season winding
down, No. 3 Stanford (19-4,13-4 Pac
-12) needs to put its stamp on the Pac
-12, and there is no better way to do
that than by beating the No. 11 Wash
ington Huskies (18-6,10-6) and the
Washington State Cougars (12-14,4-
12) on the road.
First up for the Card is Washing
ton, and the Huskies are only two

and-a-half games behind Stanford in
the Pac-12 standings, making this
game a must win if the Card hopes to
get back into the race for the confer
ence title (UCLA and USC are cur
rently tied for the top slot.) Washing
ton boasts an impressive 11-1 record
at home, proving that it plays its best
volleyball in Seattle. However, it's
coming off of two embarrassing
straight-set losses to USC and
UCLA, and will surely be looking to
right the ship with a win against the
Cardinal.
Stanford's offense will have to be
on top of its game, as Washington has
the Pac-12 and arguably the country's
best defense. This is due in large part
to the pair of seniors up front, Bianca
Rowland and Laruen Barfield. Row
land is first in the Pac-12 in blocks per
set at 1.57. Barfield is not far behind at
third, averaging 1.46 blocks per set.
Sophomore libero Jenna Orlandini
also poses a threat on defense, as she
is currently sixth in the Pac-12 in digs,
averaging 4.38 per set.
On Saturday, Stanford will take on
Washington State in what looks to be
a favorable matchup for the Card.
What looked like a promising season
for the Cougars has turned out to be
very disappointing, as they are ninth
in the Pac-12 with just five games re
maining.

The one bright spot for the
Cougars this year has been senior
sensation Megan Ganzer.The outside
hitter leads the Pac-12 in both kills
and points, averaging 5.32 points per
set and 4.79 kills per set. In her last
match against UCLA, Ganzer posted
a double-double with 10 kills and 11
digs, leading the team in both cate
gories.

The question will be whether
Washington State can stop Stanford's
dynamic sophomore duo of outside
hitter Rachel Williams and middle
blocker Carly Wopat. The pair has
been nearly unstoppable for the past
few weeks, smothering their oppo
nents both offensively and defensive
ly. Wopat is second in the Pac-12 in
blocks per set at 1.57, while Williams
comes in at fifth in kills, averaging 4.3
per set.

If Stanford is to make a run at first
place in the Pac-12, coming out of
Washington with two wins is essen
tial. Currently two games behind the
Bruins and Trojans with five games
remaining, the title is not yet out of
reach for the Cardinal.

Stanford takes on Washington in
Seattle at 7 p.m. on Friday and finish
es the weekend against the Cougars
in Pullman at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday.
