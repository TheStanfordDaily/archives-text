# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Quick breather from tough MPSF 
### DAVID PEREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's water
polo will take a break from its con
ference schedule this weekend as it
hosts No. 14 Santa Clara and No. 12
UC-Davis at Avery Aquatic Center.
With only two weeks until the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) tournament, the Cardinal
(15-4, 4-2 MPSF) is looking to
round into shape for a postseason
push. Senior utility Peter Sefton
talked about how this weekend's
games will help prepare the team
for the stretch run.

"As always, we are working on
defense, and you can always work
on that no matter who you are play
ing," Sefton said.
While Stanford has pointed to
defense all year as its key to success,
it could also benefit from some of
fensive improvement. The defense
has been stellar throughout the sea
son, allowing only 5.45 goals per
game. That mark is second-best in
the MPSF, behind only top-seeded
use.

The offense, on the other hand, is
eighth in the league in goals per
game, and the lack of offensive out
put seems to be the difference be-

tween Stanford and the top three
teams. No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 USC and
No. 3 Cal are all in the top three in
offensive production, as well as the
top four in defense.

Stanford has been held to four
and six goals in its two MPSF losses,
and even in its wins the offensive
output has been less than incredi
ble. Only twice this year has the
team surpassed the double-digit
scoring mark against conference
opponents. Encouragingly, those
two double-digit scoring outputs

came in the Cardinal's last two
games.
This weekend's games against
teams outside of the MPSF give the
Cardinal a brief respite from what is
one of the country's dominant con
ferences. The nine teams in the
MPSF also make up the top nine na
tionally ranked teams.
The Cardinal also hosts an alum
ni game that should give Stanford a
chance to loosen up before it heads
into the crucial regular season fi
nale against No. 3 California.
"It will be fun playing with all the
older guys, a lot of people usually
come back," Sefton said.
The game against Cal will help
determine seeding in the MPSF
Tournament, which is crucial to
Stanford's chances of making it into
the NCAA Championship. Stan
ford is currently fourth in the MPSF
while Cal is second, but a Stanford
win would give both teams two total
losses, with Stanford owning the
head-to-head tiebreaker.

The start time for the matchup
against Cal, the annual "Big
Splash," will be announced on Mon
day.
