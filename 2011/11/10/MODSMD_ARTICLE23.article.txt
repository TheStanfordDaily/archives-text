# Cardinal swimmers test skills against Cal in scrimmage
## 
### â€“ George Chen 
After almost three weeks of un
interrupted training, the men's
swim team traveled to Cal for a
scrimmage-like meet against rival
California on Wednesday. If ever
there was a "friendly competition"
between Stanford and the Golden
Bears, this meet might have been it.
Far from what one would call a
conventional dual meet, the day
consisted of six tri-distance cate
gories of events, including butter
fly, backstroke, breaststroke, indi
vidual medley, short distance
freestyle and long distance
freestyle.
Cardinal swimmers won three
of the six tri-distance categories.
Distance standout senior Chad La

Tourette won the 500 and 1000
freestyle to claim the overall tri
distance title. In the 1000 freestyle,
La Tourette showed his continued
dominance in endurance events
with a comfortable seven-second
victory over the rest of the field.
Likewise, veteran Bobby Bol
der won the 100 and 200 butterfly
for the overall butterfly title. Bol
der finished third in the 50 fly, but
the defending 200-meter butterfly
national champion took control in
the longer events.
Not to be outdone, freshman
David Nolan swept the 100, 200,
and 400 individual medleys to grab
the tri-medley win. Nolan was the
only swimmer, other than Cal's
Tom Shields, to win all his events.
Cal was impressive in the back
stroke events, with Shields and
Mathias Gydesen going one-two in
the overall category.
While this scrimmage may not
have been considered one of the
bigger competitions this season, it
certainly gave the Cardinal swim
mers a chance for some short-rest
racing and a crucial preview of Cal,
the defending NCAA Champion.
Stanford will see the Golden
Bears at least three more times
down the road this season their
next reunion will be in mid-Febru
ary in a conference dual meet. The
Pac-12 Championships will follow
suit in late February. And if the two
teams still don't get enough of each
other by then, they'll duke it out at
the NCAAs in March.
