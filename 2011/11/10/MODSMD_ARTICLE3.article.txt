## Faculty assess 'Occupy' protests Professors weigh in on future of Occupy Wall St. movement 
### ANTHONY DING 
In spite of the ripple effect created by the
Occupy Wall Street movement, several Stan
ford professors indicate that they believe the
movement, while noteworthy, will not last.
The movement began on Sept. 17 and within
days, spread throughout the nation. On Nov. 8,
Stanford students showed up as part of the Oc
cupy Stanford movement to protest a Gold
man-Sachs recruiting event on campus.
Despite all the momentum in the movement,
history professor David Kennedy '63 said he be
lieves the movement will die down.
"Call me cynical, but I believe it will peter
out as the weather turns less benign," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy, however, said that Occupy Wall
Street represents legitimate concerns.
"I think the problems are real enough, espe
cially mounting income and wealth inequality,"
he said.
The emergence of the Occupy movement is

not surprising. Kennedy noted that the emer
gence of the Tea Party, in response to the reces
sion, seemed lopsided. He expected another
movement would arise to counter the conserva
tive lean.

John Taylor, economics professor and senior
fellow at the Hoover Institute, said that the rise
of both the Tea Party and the Occupy move
ment can be attributed to similar causes.

"Actually I think the same frustrations with
government policy are what got the Tea Party
movement going, though the manifestations are
quite different, and of course that has already
had a huge impact," Taylor wrote in an email to
The Daily.

In terms of the historical context, Kennedy
noted that while the Occupy movement is not
one-of-a-kind, the movement differs from past
forms of social protest.

"Examples that come to mind are the bonus
marchers in the 1930s and the anti-Vietnam War
movement, but all those had specific, concrete
policy objectives," Kennedy said.
Susan Olzak, a professor of sociology,
echoed Kennedy, saying that national news re
ports were misleading in emphasizing the lack
of any distinct organization or leadership body
as compared to past social protest movements,

such as the Civil Rights movement.
She added that while there may not have
been a distinct organization that arose from the
Occupy movement, the movement can, to some
degree, be broken down into the organizations
which largely create it.

"Observers of local movement activity in
Oakland and San Francisco suggest that there is
a substantial presence of organized labor
unions, local community organizations and
grassroots activist associations," Olzak said.
Though riots and violence that have oc
curred since the Occupy movement began,
Kennedy said these acts of violence do not ap
pear to provide any significant benefit to the
movement.
