## Faculty assess 'Occupy' protests Professors weigh in on future of Occupy Wall St. movement 
### ANTHONY DING 
In spite of the ripple effect created by the
Occupy Wall Street movement, several Stan
ford professors indicate that they believe the
movement, while noteworthy, will not last.
The movement began on Sept. 17 and within
days, spread throughout the nation. On Nov. 8,
Stanford students showed up as part of the Oc
cupy Stanford movement to protest a Gold
man-Sachs recruiting event on campus.
Despite all the momentum in the movement,
history professor David Kennedy '63 said he be
lieves the movement will die down.
"Call me cynical, but I believe it will peter
out as the weather turns less benign," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy, however, said that Occupy Wall
Street represents legitimate concerns.
"I think the problems are real enough, espe
cially mounting income and wealth inequality,"
he said.
The emergence of the Occupy movement is

not surprising. Kennedy noted that the emer
gence of the Tea Party, in response to the reces
sion, seemed lopsided. He expected another
movement would arise to counter the conserva
tive lean.

John Taylor, economics professor and senior
fellow at the Hoover Institute, said that the rise
of both the Tea Party and the Occupy move
ment can be attributed to similar causes.

"Actually I think the same frustrations with
government policy are what got the Tea Party
movement going, though the manifestations are
quite different, and of course that has already
had a huge impact," Taylor wrote in an email to
The Daily.

In terms of the historical context, Kennedy
noted that while the Occupy movement is not
one-of-a-kind, the movement differs from past
forms of social protest.

"Examples that come to mind are the bonus
marchers in the 1930s and the anti-Vietnam War
movement, but all those had specific, concrete
policy objectives," Kennedy said.
Susan Olzak, a professor of sociology,
echoed Kennedy, saying that national news re
ports were misleading in emphasizing the lack
of any distinct organization or leadership body
as compared to past social protest movements,

such as the Civil Rights movement.
She added that while there may not have
been a distinct organization that arose from the
Occupy movement, the movement can, to some
degree, be broken down into the organizations
which largely create it.

"Observers of local movement activity in
Oakland and San Francisco suggest that there is
a substantial presence of organized labor
unions, local community organizations and
grassroots activist associations," Olzak said.
Though riots and violence that have oc
curred since the Occupy movement began,
Kennedy said these acts of violence do not ap
pear to provide any significant benefit to the
movement.

"The Civil Rights movement
was doctrinally nonviolent, and
shrewdly capitalized on the several
instance of police violence visited
upon civil rights demonstrators,"
Kennedy said. "I don't see anything
that sophisticated happening here."
Kennedy said he is also wary of
the comparison some organizers of
the Occupy movement make be
tween Occupy and the Arab Spring,
a series of recent revolutions that
spread through the Middle East
and North Africa.
"We have yet to see what season
will follow the Arab Spring," he
said.
While it is impossible to predict
what impact the movement will
have on future events, Kennedy,
Taylor and Olzak independently
agreed that the movement has the
potential to sway the 2012 presi
dential elections.

"Regarding the 2012 elections, I
think both Democrats and Repub

licans should be aware of this prob
lem and should address it," Taylor
said.

Kennedy offered insight on the
movement's impact on President
Barack Obama.

"If it signals disaffection with
Obama by a significant part of his
base, then it will spell trouble for
him in the election," Kennedy said.
Although the movement's de
mands have yet to be resolved,
Kennedy and Taylor offered sug
gestions for the movement in gen
eral.

According to Kennedy, taxing
the top 1 percent would not provide
sufficient revenue to change the
United States' economic landscape.
He noted, however, that "as politi
cal theater, and as away to mobilize
broad popular sentiment, maybe
the focus on the top 1 percent will
work."

"Part of the answer is to remove
the 'too big to fail' problem in
which the government protects the
politically powerful at the expense
of everyone else," Taylor said.
