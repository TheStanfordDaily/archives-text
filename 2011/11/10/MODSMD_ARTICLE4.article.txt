## Study seeks depression prevention Bias training helps depression-prone girls 
### CHRIS KREMER 
According to a recent psychology
study, it may be possible to prevent
depression in some adolescent girls
at-risk for the disease through atten
tional bias training, which trains indi
viduals with certain biases toward
specific stimuli to remove themselves
from their biases.

Lan Gotlib, psychology professor,
recently found that attentional bias
training could help prevent depres
sion in girls ages 10 to 14, who have al
ready demonstrated signs of elevated
emotional stress. The research fo
cused on girls whose mothers were di
agnosed with depression.

"We know about half of them are
going to experience some kind of a
depressive episode within the next 10
years," Gotlib said. "What we have
been finding is that [the girls whose
mothers have depression] are more
biologically reactive to stress in the
environment than girls without a
family history."
In his first experiment, Gotlib
used real-time neural feedback train
ing. The eight subjects simultaneously
looked at images provoking negative
emotional stimuli as well as an MRI
image of their brains, depicting their
response to the negative images.
When the subjects were shown the
