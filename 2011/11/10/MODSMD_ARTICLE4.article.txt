## Study seeks depression prevention Bias training helps depression-prone girls 
### CHRIS KREMER 
According to a recent psychology
study, it may be possible to prevent
depression in some adolescent girls
at-risk for the disease through atten
tional bias training, which trains indi
viduals with certain biases toward
specific stimuli to remove themselves
from their biases.

Lan Gotlib, psychology professor,
recently found that attentional bias
training could help prevent depres
sion in girls ages 10 to 14, who have al
ready demonstrated signs of elevated
emotional stress. The research fo
cused on girls whose mothers were di
agnosed with depression.

"We know about half of them are
going to experience some kind of a
depressive episode within the next 10
years," Gotlib said. "What we have
been finding is that [the girls whose
mothers have depression] are more
biologically reactive to stress in the
environment than girls without a
family history."
In his first experiment, Gotlib
used real-time neural feedback train
ing. The eight subjects simultaneously
looked at images provoking negative
emotional stimuli as well as an MRI
image of their brains, depicting their
response to the negative images.
When the subjects were shown the
images, researchers instructed them
to think positive thoughts to dimin
ish their negative response.
"We're trying to teach the girls a
skill that will make them less biolog
ically reactive to stress with the hope
that it [will] reduce the likelihood
that they will have a depressive
episode," Gotlib said.
The control group was shown the
same negatively stimulating images,
but each subject in this group was
shown an MRI image of a brain
other than her own. This process
contrasted the initial part of the ex
periment, in which girls were able to
observe the impact their thoughts
were having on their brains in real
time. The experiment indicated that
the experimental group was much
better able to reduce stress caused
by the negative pictures.
For the second experiment, eight

subjects were presented with two im
ages of faces on a screen, one of them
neutral and the other either sad or
happy.The subjects were instructed to
click on a dot, which replaced the
more positive of the two faces. For the
control group of the second experi
ment, the dot replaced one of the two
faces at random. The eight subjects in
the experimental group showed
fewer signs of stress after practicing
the dot exercise once a day for a week.
"One of the things we know
about depressed people is that they
cannot stop from processing nega
tive information," Gotlib said. "I
think one of the things we are doing
here is immediately making them
look away [or] 'disattend' from neg
ative stimuli."

Gotlib said that such training had
rarely been used for treating depres
sion and is almost never used with
children, whose risk of developing
the condition is growing. Fie believes
the stress-reducing techniques in the
study can be taught to other children
who are at risk for depression. Fie
also stated his research may help de

velop drugs to treat depression.
Gotlib's research may in the future
be expanded using real-time neural
feedback in deep brain stimulation.
During this process, an electrode is
implanted in the brain and sends elec
trical pulses to a particular structure.
"So if we can identify where in
the brain that should be, then that
should be another possibility,"
Gotlib said.

Colin MacLeod, a professor of
psychology at the University of
Western Australia, has done re
search on attentional bias training
and sees great potential for the ap
plications of the Gotlib's results.
"One reason that he's really cut
ting edge is that he is looking not at
people who already have problems
and trying to fix them up, but he's
looking at the children who we know
are vulnerable but who do not show
symptoms and use these technolo
gies that prevent rather than repair
dysfunctions," MacLeod said.
