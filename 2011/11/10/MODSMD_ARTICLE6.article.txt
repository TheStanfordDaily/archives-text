## OAPE offers alternative social scene Cardinal Nights events well-attended 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
The Cardinal Nights initiative,
an effort by the new Office of Alco
hol Policy and Education (OAPE)
to offer alcohol-free programming
for students, has gradually become
increasingly relevant in the campus
social scene, according to students
and University officials.
Cardinal Night events, which
have included a viewing party of the
USC-Stanford football game and a
FLiCKS screening of "Elarry Potter
and the Deathly Elallows: Part 2,"
have consistently attracted hun
dreds of attendees. According to
OAPE Assistant Director & Com
munity Engagement Coordinator
Angelina Cardona 'll, the viewing
party was the best-attended event,
with more than 1,000 students turn
ing up.

Attendance at Cardinal Night
has risen since the start of the quar
ter. Upcoming Cardinal Nights in
clude "Stanford's Got Talent" and
"Big Game Party," jointly hosted by
West Campus dorm staff. The
OAPE has sought to market Cardi
nal Nights to students largely
through email, social networking,
student leadership and word-of
mouth, Cardona said.
"Before planning Cardinal
Nights, I researched what events
students wanted to have on campus
through focus groups, a survey, as
well as through informal input,"
Cardona wrote in an email to The
Daily.

Cardona said that the Cardinal
Nights initiative stemmed from the
recommendations of an Alcohol
Study Group, consisting of staff, fac
ulty and students, that supported
expanded options for socializing on
weekends without the pressure to
consume alcohol.
"The intent was to offer alterna
tives that complement the existing
social scene [on campus]," said
Ralph Castro, associate dean of
student affairs and director of
OAPE.
Castro noted that Cardinal
Nights is only one aspect of
OAPE's efforts. He highlighted
OAPE's outreach education initia
tives, which are aimed at increasing
student awareness of alcohol issues.

"The goal is to encourage stu
dents to think critically about alco
hol and to target high risk drink

ing," he said.
Castro said that the office is con
tinuing to develop relationships
with other student groups.
"Cardinal Nights has several
ways for [the] community to en
gage with the program, including a
grant application that any student
or student group/dorm/house can
fill out to co-host a Cardinal
Night," Cardona said.
Castro noted that the short du
ration of the Cardinal Nights initia
tive means any judgment on its ef
fectiveness may be premature.
Nevertheless, both he and Cardona
have received positive feedback
from students. Surveys are circulat
ed during events and in an effort to
improve future programming.
"We are open and willing to try

many different types of events to
see what events are most enjoyed
by students," Cardona said.
While Cardinal Nights is intend
ed to provide alcohol-free experi
ences accessible to all Stanford stu
dents, staff and students alike
noted that freshmen have been the
primary event participants. Castro
indicated that while the events
have received positive feedback
from some upperclassmen and
their student leadership, many up
perclassmen remain ambivalent
about the initiative.

"The programming is pushed to
wards freshmen, and upperclass
men can feel that," said Sarah
Bolmer 'l3.

Nevertheless, focusing on the
freshman class may prove to be

more effective in changing the
class' social dynamic and avoiding
ingrained habits retained by upper
classmen, who may be more hesi
tant to try the new alcohol-free ini
tiative. Cardona wrote that many of
the upperclassmen surveyed com
mented that the existence of such a
program in their first year at Stan
ford "would have made the transi
tion to college 'a lot easier."'
While between one quarter and
one third of Stanford students re
frain from drinking at the Universi
ty, students highlighted the need to
emphasize that the initiative is
there for both drinkers and non
drinkers.
"While the initiative is some
thing the campus has needed, there
is the perception that the events are

exclusively for non-drinkers," said
Paige Romer'l2.

Bolmer added that the initia
tive's programs "are more effective
when they build on communities
that already exist on campus."
Nevertheless, students ex
pressed cautious approval of the
initiative's intent, even if the impact
thus far has been limited. Students
praised the OAPE for establishing
a far more coherent alcohol policy
than in past years.

"There's a lot of room for im
provement, but it has created a
more balanced social scene that will
develop in the future," said Stefan
Norgaard 'l5.

drinkers.
"While the initiative is some
thing the campus has needed, there
is the perception that the events are

exclusively for non-drinkers," said
Paige Romer'l2.

Bolmer added that the initia
tive's programs "are more effective
when they build on communities
that already exist on campus."
Nevertheless, students ex
pressed cautious approval of the
initiative's intent, even if the impact
thus far has been limited. Students
praised the OAPE for establishing
a far more coherent alcohol policy
than in past years.

"There's a lot of room for im
provement, but it has created a
more balanced social scene that will
develop in the future," said Stefan
Norgaard 'l5.
