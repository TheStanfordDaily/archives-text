## OAPE offers alternative social scene Cardinal Nights events well-attended 
### MARSHALL WATKINS 
The Cardinal Nights initiative,
an effort by the new Office of Alco
hol Policy and Education (OAPE)
to offer alcohol-free programming
for students, has gradually become
increasingly relevant in the campus
social scene, according to students
and University officials.
Cardinal Night events, which
have included a viewing party of the
USC-Stanford football game and a
FLiCKS screening of "Elarry Potter
and the Deathly Elallows: Part 2,"
have consistently attracted hun
dreds of attendees. According to
OAPE Assistant Director & Com
munity Engagement Coordinator
Angelina Cardona 'll, the viewing
party was the best-attended event,
with more than 1,000 students turn
ing up.

Attendance at Cardinal Night
has risen since the start of the quar
ter. Upcoming Cardinal Nights in
clude "Stanford's Got Talent" and
"Big Game Party," jointly hosted by
West Campus dorm staff. The
OAPE has sought to market Cardi
nal Nights to students largely
through email, social networking,
student leadership and word-of
mouth, Cardona said.
"Before planning Cardinal
Nights, I researched what events
students wanted to have on campus
through focus groups, a survey, as
well as through informal input,"
Cardona wrote in an email to The
Daily.

Cardona said that the Cardinal
Nights initiative stemmed from the
recommendations of an Alcohol
Study Group, consisting of staff, fac
ulty and students, that supported
expanded options for socializing on
weekends without the pressure to
consume alcohol.
