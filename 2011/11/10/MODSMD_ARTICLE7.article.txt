# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Zoglin has hope for Tunisia's democratic future 
### HASSAN KARAOUNI 
Undergraduate and graduate
students alike gathered on
Wednesday evening to kick off the
official meeting of the Arab Stud
ies Table, a new interdisciplinary
forum that aims to "be an opportu
nity to present research, debate is
sues on the Arab world and engage
with outside speakers visiting Stan
ford."

At the first meeting in Encina
Hall, they weighed in on the origin,
process and aftermath of demo

cratic elections in Tunisia.
Katie Zoglin, a Harvard Law
School graduate and former Stan
ford professor, chaired the event,
which began with a brief discussion
about Tunisia's Jasmine Revolu
tion. The revolution bloomed from
the self-immolation of a Tunisian
flower vendor and, in the months
that followed, Tunisians utilized
Facebook, Twitter and other social
media to swiftly upheave the gov
ernment of Tunisian President
Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.
Zoglin, who observed the

Tunisian electoral process as an
elections monitor for the Carter
Center, cited the Tunisian revolu
tion as the residue of "long-term
grievances that had been long ig
nored."

But the blithe atmosphere of a
successful, liberating revolution
was short-lived. According to
Zoglin, although Tunisians initially
found unity in revolution, they still
encountered difficulties in estab
lishing a new government. In the
political vacuum created by the
end of President Ben Ali's 23-year

regime, over 100 political parties
vied for popular support in Tunisia.

On Oct. 23, Tunisians overcame
political divisiveness to cultivate a
much more peaceable product of
the Arab Spring: national, demo
cratic elections. Instructional vot
ing posters, the location of polls in
readily accessible domestic areas
such as schools and government
funding of political parties all con
tributed to a remarkable 70 per
cent voter turnout.
"[Tunisians] know that other
countries look to them as an exam
ple, and ... are very cognizant of
[their] role [as leaders of the Arab
Spring]," Zoglin said.
In spite of the recent elections,
participants of the Arab Study
Table pointed out a number of key
problems with the electoral
process.
First, Tunisian elections faltered
in the wake of poorly implemented
voter registration. While organiz
ing elections, Tunisian officials did
not effectively advertise voter reg
istration opportunities. Likewise, a
number of uniformed Tunisians
were unable to register and the
provisional government eventually
responded by allowing any citizen
to vote in his or her hometown
upon displaying a national identifi
cation card.
Second, the large number of po
litical parties stifled voters and en
couraged Tunisians to base their
votes on familiarity with parties
rather than an understanding of
them. In opposition to government
campaign regulations, many parties
bought votes and advertised in
mosques, a term Zoglin referred to

as "electioneering."
"The weaknesses were all to be
expected in the first round," Zoglin
said.
When the final votes were
polled, the self-proclaimed Islamist
moderate party Al-Nahda, emerged
with 41 percent of the popular vote.
Members of the table zeroed in on
this result as potentially harmful to
the legitimacy of Tunisia.
As opposed to the predominate
ly male-dominated governments of
many Arab nations, Tunisia is dis
tinguished by an unshakeable pro
tection of women's rights.
"In Tunisia, there's a lot of
women in top ranks where a lot of
power is," Zoglin said.
Some participants expressed
concern that Al- Nahda could cor
rupt Tunisia's precedence of gender
equality. In defense of Al-Nahda
and Tunisia's prospects, Zoglin
countered that Al-Nahda officially
declared to maintain women's
rights and that Tunisians strongly
support equality.
Although Zoglin admitted that
reason for concern remains, her
hopes reflected her greater opti
mism regarding Tunisia's future.
"It has a lot of challenges ahead,
but I have a lot of hope for Tunisia,"
Zoglin said.
