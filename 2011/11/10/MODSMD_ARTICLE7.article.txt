## Zoglin has hope for Tunisia's democratic future 
### HASSAN KARAOUNI 
Undergraduate and graduate
students alike gathered on
Wednesday evening to kick off the
official meeting of the Arab Stud
ies Table, a new interdisciplinary
forum that aims to "be an opportu
nity to present research, debate is
sues on the Arab world and engage
with outside speakers visiting Stan
ford."

At the first meeting in Encina
Hall, they weighed in on the origin,
process and aftermath of demo

cratic elections in Tunisia.
Katie Zoglin, a Harvard Law
School graduate and former Stan
ford professor, chaired the event,
which began with a brief discussion
about Tunisia's Jasmine Revolu
tion. The revolution bloomed from
the self-immolation of a Tunisian
flower vendor and, in the months
that followed, Tunisians utilized
Facebook, Twitter and other social
media to swiftly upheave the gov
ernment of Tunisian President
Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali.
Zoglin, who observed the

Tunisian electoral process as an
elections monitor for the Carter
Center, cited the Tunisian revolu
tion as the residue of "long-term
grievances that had been long ig
nored."

But the blithe atmosphere of a
successful, liberating revolution
was short-lived. According to
Zoglin, although Tunisians initially
found unity in revolution, they still
encountered difficulties in estab
lishing a new government. In the
political vacuum created by the
end of President Ben Ali's 23-year

regime, over 100 political parties
vied for popular support in Tunisia.

On Oct. 23, Tunisians overcame
political divisiveness to cultivate a
much more peaceable product of
the Arab Spring: national, demo
cratic elections. Instructional vot
ing posters, the location of polls in
readily accessible domestic areas
such as schools and government
funding of political parties all con
tributed to a remarkable 70 per
cent voter turnout.
