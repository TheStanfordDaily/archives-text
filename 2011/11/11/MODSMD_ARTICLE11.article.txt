## EDITORIAL Alpine Trail debate an embarrassment 
### 
Elevenyearsago,when many of
this year's freshmen were
learning to read, Stanford
committed itself to building a $l9 mil
lion pair of trails in the foothills south
of campus as a condition of its Gener
al Use Permit with Santa Clara Coun
ty. One of the trails, which winds
through the hills between Page Mill
Road and Arastradero Road, was
opened last spring to much fanfare.
Meanwhile, the second trail, more of
a renovation than a new construction,
has for five years been mired in polit
ical gridlock. A recent vote by the San
Mateo County Board of Supervisors
to temporarily deny Stanford's $10.4
million offer to rebuild the portion of
Alpine Trail in question until a final
decision is made in December has ex
tended the fiasco further.
Alpine Trail descends the north
face of the Santa Cruz Mountains be
fore meeting Alpine Road in Portola
Valley and paralleling it all the way to
Sand Hill Road. Immediately before
reaching Stanford, the trail passes
through Stanford Weekend Acres, a
residential community and part of
San Mateo County. Stanford's offer
to San Mateo County would revamp
the lower portion of the trail running
under Interstate 280 and through
Stanford Weekend Acres.
Stanford's reasons for suggesting
improvements to this route are
straightforward. The current trail dis
appears in some places, suffers from
uneven pavement and bad intersec
tion design, and on many stretches is
only wide enough for one person to
move comfortably. Near Interstate
280, the trail is threatened by erosion
from a nearby creek. As the only car
free right of way in the area running
North to South, it is a vital connection
for communities and a popular recre
ational route. The condition of this
stretch contrasts starkly to the por
tion of the trail to the South recently
repaved by Portola Valley with $2.8
million from Stanford. Proponents of
the trail also argue that its deteriorat

ing condition will eventually force
San Mateo County to address the
problem, and that doing so now with
Stanford's money would be a win for
taxpayers.
Most of the opposition to the trail
comes from a subset of homeowners
in Stanford Weekend Acres. Opposi
tion to the trail ranges from under
standable concerns like the possibili
ty of slower traffic on Alpine Road
during construction, to the rather as
tonishing argument that the addi
tional accidents that could occur if
the trail's safety improvements are
successful in encouraging walking
and cycling, are a deal breaker. If
these concerns are indeed more ur
gent to San Mateo County Supervi
sors than repairing the trail, the
County should have done everyone
involved a favor and declined Stan
ford's offer years ago. If the supervi
sors want the trail, then they should
stop the games and accept the offer,
as San Mateo County's very own As
sistant Manager argued in an Octo
ber 4th Staff Report. Since Stanford's
offer will expire at the end of the
year, San Mateo County must make
its final decision soon or else forfeit
the money entirely.
San Mateo County's reluctance
to allow construction of away for
pedestrians and cyclists to safely ac
cess several of its communities at no
or very little cost to its residents
seems masochistic from the perspec
tive of the Editorial Board. Santa
Clara County will be happy to have
the $10.4 million should San Mateo
County refuse the offer.That said, the
five years of vacillation and red tape
that San Mateo County has prof
fered in exchange for free money is a
baffling waste of time and bureau
cratic energy. If Stanford should ever
find itself signing another agreement
to build trails in exchange for devel
opment permission, the routes
should be agreed upon in advance or
at the very least not dependent on
the whim of a third party.
