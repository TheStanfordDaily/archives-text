# THE
						MIXED MESSAGES OF MODERNISM
## Caused to act 
### D.S. Nelson 
Over the last two centuries, sci
ence has progressed to the
point where, if something
can't be explained, we have faith
that it is simply a matter of time until
it is. Science has made us healthier
and more secure. It has given us
ground-shaking new media. We
often forget that there was a time
when the best possible means of un
derstanding distant happenings was
either an engraving or word of
mouth. Now we can now transport
actual sensory information across
tremendous distances instanta
neously. Science has made us, more
than ever before, in control and in
the know. It has been an empower
ing force; no longer do we need to
cower in fear of inexplicable misfor
tunes.

We now have a readily explain
able world. Not much of what we
know has taken anything irretriev
able out of human life. Perhaps with
the gain of so many explanations,
we have lost much of the mystery of
the inexplicable. But primarily, sci
ence has liberated us from the un
known and given us a comfortable
security: an empowerment, to be
sure. The two disciplines, however,
have taken from us this sense of em
powerment and replaced it with res
ignation. Sociology and psychology
have taken from us something of
immediate gravity: the ownership
and understanding of self. No
longer can we decide. We can only
be caused.
A science of man has been con
structed such that our emotions and
motivations well from places inac
cessible to us. Whether we seek to
explain by means of neural connec
tions or subconscious happenings,
neither affords the holder any spe
cial access to him or her inner self.
We are forced to believe that a psy
chologist can better access us than

we can. And even then, it is not from
within ourselves that many of our
actions stem, but from the webs of
influences sociologists seek to dis
cover. Our performance on tests can
be reduced or enhanced by the
threat of stereotype. We are incredi
bly suggestible, whether we know it
or not.

Worse still, as we have come to
understand man better, we have re
linquished our access to the heights
of goodness and achievement. Our
acts of altruism can now be under
stood to be as selfish as taking the
last slice of pizza. Our successes and
failures can both be written off as in
stitutional rather than individual
outputs.

Our individuality, too, seems at
risk. Prone to fits of passion and de
pression, Goethe? You may be bipo
lar. Ever eager to fight, Achilles?
Maybe your testosterone is elevated
a pituitary tumor, perhaps? His
psychiatrist may well tell him he's
sublimating a desire for his father's
love into a quest to prove himself.
Either way, we cannot say the desire
to battle was truly his. It did not orig
inate in his conscious mind; he has
not chosen it. He is not really free to
decide. His unique traits, from his
friendliness to his aggression, aren't
his own but his subconscious',his so
ciety's, his hormones' and his neu
rons' connections. His characteris
tics arise from predetermined caus
es. He cannot simply be strong or
friendly, but must be caused to be so.
He is hardly more responsible for
his actions than he is responsible for
his autonomic heartbeat.
It is a triumph of science that we
can say we believe in a universally
caused" universe, that there are no
actions without causes. However, it
is also a terrible thing, as now we hu
mans are also caused, and our ac
tions originate in those causes and

not in ourselves. The role of the con
scious mind has been minimized and
the meaningful actions of our lives
have been removed from its control.
It seems obvious to say that there is
nothing about human action that ex
empts it from the laws of science, but
its implications are less immediate.
When we truly consider the pitfalls
of a causally governed world, we re
alize that the essential truths that in
form our everyday thinking are
wrong. Free will, in the sense that we
can make decisions independent of
causes, may be fundamentally illuso
ry. Agency may be mythical.
This realization doesn't make it
any less useful for us to consider our
lives as primarily subject to our own
agency. People who believe they
own their lives are far more likely to
succeed in them. Stanford-ites will
know, but outside of our very driven
realm, that way of thinking has be
come rare. In politics as well, we re
sist ever believing in the free exer
cise of agency on the part of our
population. Every failure and suc
cess has a social cause, so much so
that the responsibility of people is
diminished to nothing. So, I say, have
the courage to shape your own life,
own it and own your actions. Own
your characteristics and shortcom
ings, bad and good alike. While we
may be caused, we have no way of
knowing what those causes are, nor
the destined outcome. The existence
of such causes alone does not justify
relinquishing the drive to make
one's life as good as it can be.
