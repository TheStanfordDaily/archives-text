# SEEING GREEN
## The 						"away" team 
### Holly Moeller 
It's going to be a big day tomorrow
when the Oregon football team
comes to town. This year, we meet
the team that handed us our only loss
last season but on our own turf.
And although Stanford has played
(mostly) with convincing dominance
this season (and Oregon's already
picked up one loss), we'll take all the
home-field advantage we can get.
Sports fans everywhere under
stand the merits of playing at home:
you know the quirks of the stadium,
are acclimated to the local weather
and have a fan base that screams at
your opponent and shuts up when
you're on offense. It's the classic
recipe for success.
But if you're the rare team that
plays best on the road, you might just
shake up the league.
That's what happens in nature,
when some species transported far
from home by human activity
launch ecosystem-rattling invasions
of local plant and animal communi
ties. Invasive species can change land
scapes, clog waterways, squeeze out
locals and even poison wildlife. And
unlike a visiting sports team, which
catches an outbound bus after even
the most disheartening trouncing, in
vasive species come to stay.

What makes these alien invaders
so successful? First, they have to trav
el well and carve out a foothold wher
ever they land. Once established, they
might be faster-growing than their
local equivalents. Or their usual pred
ators might be absent in the new envi
ronment. The factors differ for every
species and in each locale mak
ing invasions hard to predict.
One thing we do know for sure,

though: Invasive species are a grow
ing, global problem.
Every year, the United States
alone spends about $9 billion trying to
control aquatic invaders (to say noth
ing of kudzu, iceplant, Eucalyptus and
other terrestrial troublemakers). San
Francisco Bay alone hosts more than
250 non-native species, making it one
of the most invaded spots on the plan
et.
In fact, the first report of marine in
vaders on the West Coast was logged
in the Bay in 1853, someone stum
bled upon an Atlantic barnacle look
ing happy as a clam. Since then, swim
mer's itch, Asian crabs and a host of
other species have arrived. On aver
age, a new species arrives about once
every 14 weeks. Prior to 1961, the inva
sion rate was only about one species
per year.
Why here?
Global commerce is a major fac
tor. In 2008, Jennifer Molnar and col
leagues at The Nature Conservancy
published a key study on aquatic in
vaders, finding that cargo volume
was the best predictor of invasion.
Nearly 70 percent of the species in
their study could hitchhike on some
kind of shipping vessel.
There are a number of ways for
aquatic organisms which usually
travel during their tiny, free-swim
ming larval stages —to hitchhike.
They can tuck themselves in and
among barnacles and algae growing
on the ship's hull, or they can hang
out in the ship's ballast tanks, which
are onboard chambers pumped full
of water to add mass to a ship in
heavy seas. Commercial ships travel
long distances and fast. Most
coastal marine creatures can only
drift for a few weeks before they
need to find a piece of real estate to
settle down. That's generally not
enough time to drift across an ocean
basin. But get sucked into a ballast
tank in Shanghai on a Monday, and
you could get pumped out in Oak
land by Friday of next week.
Under pressure from conserva-

tion organizations, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency is
expected to release new guidelines
for the Vessel General Permit (re
quired for all commercial opera
tions) by the end of this month.These
guidelines will toughen limits on the
"living pollution" that ships dis
charge when they flush tanks in our
coastal waters. These guidelines
come with costs: equipping a fleet
with filtration systems, chlorine treat
ments or UV lights may kill off po
tential invaders, but it could also kill
off business.
That's why people perk up when
they hear University of Michigan
Professor Michael Parsons talk
about the "ballast-free ship." Instead
of static ballast tanks, his design uses
a flow-through pipe system of ad
justable capacity. As the ship moves
forward, the surrounding water flows
through the system, continually
flushing out eggs, larvae and the odd
jellyfish that might've tried to tag
along. According to Parsons, who
spoke last week at Hopkins Marine
Station in Monterey, such ships
would be cheaper to operate than
vessels retrofitted with other inva
sion-control measures, but they
would need to be built from scratch.
Though the ballast-free concept
was patented in 2004, it will probably
take a firm kick from the EPA before
we see fleets cruising under the
Golden Gate. That is, if Republican
led legislative efforts don't under
mine the regulations first. Mean
while, California is preparing to im
plement restrictions that are 1,000-
times more stringent by January 2012.
Because here, we know how to root,
root, root for the home team.
