# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## You have to come to College GameDay 
### 
Dear Editor,
Friends, ESPN College Game Day is
here, and this assuredly means ...
something. For those of you who
don't know, ESPN College Game-
Day is the premier show on basic
cable exclusively dedicated to col
lege football coverage. Every week,
producers pick the biggest game in
the country and do their show from
that campus. This week, they picked
us, which, obviously, is a great
honor. So you're excited, right?
Ready to rally and support Stanford
on national television? OK, just
show up to the Oval at 6 a.m. Wait,
where do you go?
OK. It's true. Maybe Game Day
plays out better on the East Coast
where it's three hours later, and
people actually start tailgating at 7
a.m. But, if you've ever watched the
show, sometimes you'll see a long
shot of the studio as they cut to
commercial, and it becomes clear
that the College Game Day horde
backdrop is not part of a tailgating
madness but actually just between
three and 5,000 people crammed
into a pen, holding up signs of vary
ing degrees of wittiness.
You, I imagine, think of yourself
as a fan of this football team. Here's
the thing: being a fan really isn't
about you. As anyone who possibly
developed hypertension while
watching the USC game two weeks
ago can tell you, it is not really a fun
experience. You think sports are

here for your entertainment? No,
your job as a fan is to a) support
your team no matter what, and b)
show that support publicly whenev
er you get the chance. So when
America's Worldwide Monolithic
Leader in Sportstainment Cover
age is in your backyard to show off
the enthusiasm of your fanbase,
show up. ESPN has already said
that "there's talk that the crowd Sat
urday for ESPN's College Game-
Day may actually set a record low
for attendance, what with the early
morning start and apathetic nature
toward football of the Stanford stu
dents." Are you guys going to sit idly
by whilst ESPN quaffs that Hater
ade?
Besides, College Game Day does
not require very much of a commit
ment. The show is only a few hours
long. Just pull a coding and/or party
ing all-nighter and stumble over to
the Oval at around 6 a.m. or so. But
at least make the effort.
So far the stadium has been full
and lively, which is awesome to see,
but sometimes, more is required.
This Saturday is a metric on the
upper limit of enthusiasm of Stan
ford football fans. If we ever have
what it takes to make it as the mag
ical unicorn of big time college foot
ball programs, then we have to have
a respectable showing on Saturday
morning. But seriously, we do not
want to embarrass ourselves Satur
day morning like we did last year at
the Arizona game. So please. What
ever you do, just go to College
Game Day at 6 a.m. It's important.
