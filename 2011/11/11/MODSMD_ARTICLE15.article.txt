## Even match on paper 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
With a top-10 team
coming to town. Col
lege Game Day at
the Farm for the first
time ever and na
tional title hopes hanging in the bal
ance, Saturday's clash with Oregon is
much more than just a normal football
game. If LSU-Alabama was the
"Game of the Century," then Oregon-
Stanford looks to be the "Game of the
Century: Watchable Edition," or at
least the "Game of the Century: Now
with Offense!"
In any case, the Pac-12 Game of the
Year necessitates a special edition of
Stat on the Back. Here's a statistical
preview of what could be the most sig
nificant regular season game in Stan
ford sports history.
Number of the game: 2
What it means: This game truly is a
showdown of the top two teams in the
Pac-12. Of the four major statistical cat
egories on each side of the ball rush
ing, passing efficiency, total yards and
points the Pac-12 leader for each is
either Stanford or Oregon. The two
teams rank 1-2 in the Pac-12 in scoring
offense, rushing offense, total offense,
passing efficiency, sacks allowed and
sacks.
Why it matters: At seemingly every
angle you look at this game, this is a bat
tle of juggernauts. Even more than just
being good teams, though, these two
squads appear perfectly designed to
exploit the other team's weaknesses.
Consider: Oregon's biggest
strength on offense is its speed on the
edge, which is Stanford's biggest weak
ness.The Cardinal's biggest strength on
offense is its power up the middle,
which is Oregon's biggest weakness.
Stanford likes to churn up clock, as it
leads the conference in time of posses
sion, which is exactly where the Duck
defense is susceptible. Oregon has a
quick-strike attack, ranking last in the
nation in time of possession, and these
quick strikes are exactly what have
caused the Cardinal defense major
problems.
Oregon hasn't lost a conference
game since it last played on the Farm, a
span of 18 Pac-12 games. Stanford has
n't lost any game since it last played at
Autzen Stadium, a span of 17 games.
Each team is the other's kryptonite and
the other's antithesis. Fiery Chip Kelly
against calm David Shaw. Cliff Harris's
suspensions against Andrew Luck's
saintliness. Public against private.
Green against red. About the only
thing these two teams have in common
is Phil Knight.
Other notable numbers:
406: Saturday will be the 406 th day
since Stanford last played Oregon. It
will also be the 406 th day since Stan
ford lost a game. Many things have
changed in those 406 days (incoming
freshmen, outgoing seniors, new
coaches, suspensions, injuries, etc.), and
how much things have changed will de-
