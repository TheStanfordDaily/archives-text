## Even match on paper 
### Jacob Jaffe Stat on the Back 
With a top-10 team
coming to town. Col
lege Game Day at
the Farm for the first
time ever and na
tional title hopes hanging in the bal
ance, Saturday's clash with Oregon is
much more than just a normal football
game. If LSU-Alabama was the
"Game of the Century," then Oregon-
Stanford looks to be the "Game of the
Century: Watchable Edition," or at
least the "Game of the Century: Now
with Offense!"
In any case, the Pac-12 Game of the
Year necessitates a special edition of
Stat on the Back. Here's a statistical
preview of what could be the most sig
nificant regular season game in Stan
ford sports history.
Number of the game: 2
What it means: This game truly is a
showdown of the top two teams in the
Pac-12. Of the four major statistical cat
egories on each side of the ball rush
ing, passing efficiency, total yards and
points the Pac-12 leader for each is
either Stanford or Oregon. The two
teams rank 1-2 in the Pac-12 in scoring
offense, rushing offense, total offense,
passing efficiency, sacks allowed and
sacks.
Why it matters: At seemingly every
angle you look at this game, this is a bat
tle of juggernauts. Even more than just
being good teams, though, these two
squads appear perfectly designed to
exploit the other team's weaknesses.
Consider: Oregon's biggest
strength on offense is its speed on the
edge, which is Stanford's biggest weak
ness.The Cardinal's biggest strength on
offense is its power up the middle,
which is Oregon's biggest weakness.
Stanford likes to churn up clock, as it
leads the conference in time of posses
sion, which is exactly where the Duck
defense is susceptible. Oregon has a
quick-strike attack, ranking last in the
nation in time of possession, and these
quick strikes are exactly what have
caused the Cardinal defense major
problems.
Oregon hasn't lost a conference
game since it last played on the Farm, a
span of 18 Pac-12 games. Stanford has
n't lost any game since it last played at
Autzen Stadium, a span of 17 games.
Each team is the other's kryptonite and
the other's antithesis. Fiery Chip Kelly
against calm David Shaw. Cliff Harris's
suspensions against Andrew Luck's
saintliness. Public against private.
Green against red. About the only
thing these two teams have in common
is Phil Knight.
Other notable numbers:
406: Saturday will be the 406 th day
since Stanford last played Oregon. It
will also be the 406 th day since Stan
ford lost a game. Many things have
changed in those 406 days (incoming
freshmen, outgoing seniors, new
coaches, suspensions, injuries, etc.), and
how much things have changed will de-

cide who wins this game.
21-2: One of the main things that
has changed over this time span is the
location of the game. The Autzen
crowd made Stanford's life miserable
last year, but the Cardinal will welcome
the Ducks to the Bay Area this year.
And for the Cardinal, Stanford Stadi
um has provided quite the home-field
advantage. Stanford is 21-2 in its last 23
contests on the Farm, including a cur
rent streak of 11 straight wins.
190.4: Luck is the complete pack
age (I'm talking to you, Phil Simms)
and has very few flaws. But Luck at
home is just flat-out unfair. In the past
two seasons, Luck has a 190.4 passer
rating in home games, and unsurpris
ingly the Cardinal is 11-0 in those
games. In those 11 contests, Luck has
thrown 30 touchdowns compared to
just two interceptions (one of which
was a perfectly thrown pass that sen
ior wide receiver Chris Owusu

dropped into an opponent's arms.) If
you want a comparison, Aaron
Rodgers' absurd season in the NFL
this year would net him an NCAA
passer rating of 183.
110.1: On the other hand, Oregon
quarterback Darron Thomas has not
enjoyed the road nearly as much as
Eugene. Thomas has a passer rating of
110.1 on the road compared to 209.9
at home this season, and his yards per
attempt on the road (5.15) is less than
half his home split (11.67).
117: Last year, the Oregon running
game torched Stanford's defense, but
it was the dual-threat nature of
Thomas that made the biggest differ
ence. Thomas ran for 117 yards in that
game on 15 carries. In 2011, he's run
for just 114 yards all year and he's car
ried the ball 26 times. In fact, the
Ducks have been taking the ball out
of his hands much more this year. In
last year's game, 44 plays were either
throws or passes for Thomas, and he
had 355 total yards.This year, only one
game has had more than 30 plays for
him, and he has only had over 252
total yards once.
257: The same can be said for star

running back LaMichael James, who
had 31 carries for 257 rushing yards in
last year's matchup. James has not run
the ball 31 times in a game yet this
year, and he has eclipsed 257 rushing
yards once.
This is not to say that Oregon's of
fense is sagging. The Ducks just have
more weapons this year. Junior run
ning back Kenjon Barner has already
surpassed last season's output with 601
yards and eight touchdowns on the
ground. True freshman De' Anthony
Thomas has instantly become a major
weapon for the Ducks, racking up 731
total yards and 11 touchdowns while
leading the team in receiving yards.
With weapons all around, James said
that this year's team is even faster than
last year's, which could spell doom for
the Cardinal defense.
17: Both squads rank in the top 10 in
giving the ball away, as the two teams
have only committed 17 turnovers
combined. Both are below average in
forcing turnovers, though, and in a
game as closely contested as this one
should be, one turnover could make
the difference.
57: One factor that could neutralize

Stanford's home-field advantage is in
juries. The Cardinal looks to be without
both Owusu and junior tight end Zach
Ertz, which is a loss of 57 combined
catches on the season, or over a quarter
of the passing game. Owusu is Stan
ford's best deep threat and Ertz is Stan
ford's top third-down receiver.Their ab
sence could be crucial. In other injury
news, it looks like senior strong safety
Delano Howell and junior tight end
Levine Toilolo will play, which will be a
significant boost on both sides of the
ball. Sophomore kicker Jordan
Williamson and sophomore offensive
lineman Cameron Fleming are both
questionable heading into the game. On
the other hand, Oregon appears to be
healthy at the right time, as both Darron
Thomas and James were back to their
old selves last week against Washington

after recovering from injuries.
1: Whichever team comes away
with the win on Saturday night will also
win the first ever Pac-12 North crown
(technically, if Oregon wins, it will need
one more win to clinch the title, but
there's no way the Ducks will lose at
home to Oregon State) and a trip to the
Pac-12 Championship Game. The win
ner of this game will be a big favorite
over either Arizona State or UCLA in
that game, so in essence, the winner of
the Game of the Year will likely play in
the Rose Bowl at worst.
