The butt of many a joke, football
placekickers are among the most un
derappreciated players on the ros
ter, right alongside long snappers
and holders. When things go well,
they usually aren't noticed. But when a game
winning kick sails wide or a missed extra point
costs a team the game, the kicker is going to be
the one wearing a bag over his head on campus.
It's hard out there for a kicker.
But it's even harder when you're the backup
kicker, and you have to step in with the expec
tation of perfection all around you. For Eric
Whitaker, so far, so good.
The junior from San Diego headed into the
season in a fierce competition with redshirt
freshman Jordan Williamson for Stanford's

starting kicking job. When Williamson emerged
on top and quickly started cemented his place
on the team with 11 field goals made in 12 at
tempts, it got even tougher for Whitaker, who
said the hardest part was just not being able to
contribute as much as he wanted to the team.
As the younger brother of one of the best
Cardinal kickers in recent years Nate
Whitaker 'l3 Eric got to see firsthand the
trials and tribulations of the kicking game. But
as Eric put it, there was nothing better for him
than to have the chance to follow in his broth
er's footsteps.
"Having Nate be there for me helped me a
lot," Eric said. "Nate was the person who
taught me the most and who really supported
me throughout everything. I couldn't tell you
how much it meant to have him here at Stan
ford, to continue teaching me, to continue
coaching me and just be my main source of sup

port. He and I are best friends, and I think I re
ally even started kicking because of him in high
school."
So after Eric lost the job in the summer, he
continued to work and continued to try and im
prove his game as well as those around him.
Despite transitioning for a time to play wide re
ceiver, Eric said it has almost always been eas
ier working with other people on their flaws
than it has been to find his own.
"To be honest, I think I help other kickers
better than I help myself," Eric said. "I mean, I
think I can coach better than I can fix my own
problems. Maybe 1 developed that from Nate,
but I just like being able to help the other guy
become as good as he can be."
It is one of the qualities that special teams
coordinator Brian Polian saw and appreciated
