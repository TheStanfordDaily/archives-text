# RESULTS BASED INDUSTRY

The butt of many a joke, football
placekickers are among the most un
derappreciated players on the ros
ter, right alongside long snappers
and holders. When things go well,
they usually aren't noticed. But when a game
winning kick sails wide or a missed extra point
costs a team the game, the kicker is going to be
the one wearing a bag over his head on campus.
It's hard out there for a kicker.
But it's even harder when you're the backup
kicker, and you have to step in with the expec
tation of perfection all around you. For Eric
Whitaker, so far, so good.
The junior from San Diego headed into the
season in a fierce competition with redshirt
freshman Jordan Williamson for Stanford's

starting kicking job. When Williamson emerged
on top and quickly started cemented his place
on the team with 11 field goals made in 12 at
tempts, it got even tougher for Whitaker, who
said the hardest part was just not being able to
contribute as much as he wanted to the team.
As the younger brother of one of the best
Cardinal kickers in recent years Nate
Whitaker 'l3 Eric got to see firsthand the
trials and tribulations of the kicking game. But
as Eric put it, there was nothing better for him
than to have the chance to follow in his broth
er's footsteps.
"Having Nate be there for me helped me a
lot," Eric said. "Nate was the person who
taught me the most and who really supported
me throughout everything. I couldn't tell you
how much it meant to have him here at Stan
ford, to continue teaching me, to continue
coaching me and just be my main source of sup

port. He and I are best friends, and I think I re
ally even started kicking because of him in high
school."
So after Eric lost the job in the summer, he
continued to work and continued to try and im
prove his game as well as those around him.
Despite transitioning for a time to play wide re
ceiver, Eric said it has almost always been eas
ier working with other people on their flaws
than it has been to find his own.
"To be honest, I think I help other kickers
better than I help myself," Eric said. "I mean, I
think I can coach better than I can fix my own
problems. Maybe 1 developed that from Nate,
but I just like being able to help the other guy
become as good as he can be."
It is one of the qualities that special teams
coordinator Brian Polian saw and appreciated

in Eric, because it would soon be
come extremely important for the
team's success.
Two weeks ago, just before the
No. 4 Cardinal was set to take on
USC on the road and on national
television, Williamson went down
with a leg injury and would not be
able to kick.
When Whitaker realized he was
going to have to step up, there were
some initial doubts.
"I won't lie at first I was a lit

tie nervous," he said. "It'd been
awhile since I'd actually kicked, es
pecially since I had recently been
playing a little receiver. But I just
thought, now is my time to shine,
and it was a great opportunity for
me. I knew I had to go out there,
relax and just make the most of it."
In his first collegiate game han
dling full kicking responsibilities,
Whitaker made two field goals and
all six extra points, including two in
overtime when there was zero room
for error.
"When the lights have been on,
he's done a nice job," Polian said.
"And I give him a lot of credit. It's
not easy to be the No. 2 guy through
the first two-thirds of the football

season and then right before the
biggest game of the season, have to
come on and do it all. But it's hard
to argue with the results."
"We have not kicked off the way
I'd like to," Polian added. "But no
body's a harsher critic on Eric than
Eric is. And [after he lost the job to
Williamson] Eric was a great team
mate, and he was really mature. He
kept himself in shape, because you
never know. And unfortunately for
us, 'you never know' popped up."
With Williamson still day-to-day,
Whitaker stands a good chance of
getting the call tomorrow night
against the Ducks. The hype and
build-up to the game, as well as the
national title implications on both

sides, will certainly heap even more
pressure on Stanford and the
kicking game in particular.
Whitaker says that can't become
part of the equation when he takes
the field with a national television
audience and holding its breath.
"One thing that's really tough is
that 85 percent of the kicking game
is all mentality," he said. "Of course
I'm nervous. But my job is to get
over that and just produce. Like
coach says, it's a results game, and if
I let the nerves get in the way it's
going to cost my team, and I can't
let that happen."
