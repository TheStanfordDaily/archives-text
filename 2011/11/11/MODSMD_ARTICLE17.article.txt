# GAMEDAY ON THE FARM
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
When ESPN's College
Game Day program set up shop
last October at the University
of Missouri for the Tigers'
showdown against then-No. 1
Oklahoma (a remarkable game
as upsets go), an estimated
18,000 fans showed up to watch
Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and
the boys do their thing live and
in person.
The attendance set an unof
ficial Game Day record, and the
scene was absolutely electric as
the students packed in like sar
dines and plenty of Sooner fans
made the trek from Norman to
get a look at what has become a
mainstay of Saturdays in the
fall.
Now in its 25th season,

Game Day is making its first
ever trip to the Farm on Satur
day, and with current under
graduate enrollment hovering
around 7,000 students, the
show's producers probably
ought not to worry about the lo
gistical problems of cramming
tens of thousands of screaming
fans into the Oval which is
where the show's set will be lo
cated on Saturday morning.
But while the stereotypes
that have surrounded Stanford
football fans for years and
painted them as fair-weather
and apathetic are certainly
swirling, Saturday presents a
unique opportunity in many of
the students' and players' eyes
to show that just like the Cardi
nal, fans on campus can surprise
you.
Damian McGlothin 'l5 said

he doesn't think that the previ
ous years of weak attendance
and general disinterest in the
football program mean any
thing at this point.
"Many people around my
dorm are itching with anticipa
tion, and the casual talk that
once covered anything from
school to music is now solely
centered around the game on
Saturday," McGlothin said.
"People are hyping it up to be a
defining moment for them as a
Stanford student. This is the
biggest football game that has
been played at Stanford in a
very long time.
"The prejudice that Stan
ford doesn't care about college
football is floating throughout
sports media," he continued,
"and I think we as students feel
the need to rise to the occasion
and show everyone that we are
in fact passionate football fans
on the Farm."
The producers of the show
and some of the analysts cer
tainly hope McGlothin isn't in
the minority, and that students
and fans will brave the cold and
dark to be in the Oval when the
show's first segment kicks off at
6 a.m. on Saturday morning.
"People always ask what's
the best place we've ever been,"
said Game Day producer Tom
Engle, "and I always tell them
someplace we've never been.
We've never been to Palo Alto,
and expectations are obviously
very high for the show. Our tal
ent really feeds off the energy of
the crowd.
"We've been places where peo
ple are camping out at 10 p.m.
the night before, and we also an
ticipate some really creative
and intelligent signs going to a
place like Stanford," he said.
The program has expanded
dramatically since it first aired
as a 30-minute college football
report in 1987 with Tim Brando,
Beano Cook and Corso, taking
on a new life when in 1993 it
started visiting schools around
the country each Saturday and
filming the show live in front of
the fans.
"I think the show's become a
