# GAMEDAY ON THE FARM
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
When ESPN's College
Game Day program set up shop
last October at the University
of Missouri for the Tigers'
showdown against then-No. 1
Oklahoma (a remarkable game
as upsets go), an estimated
18,000 fans showed up to watch
Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and
the boys do their thing live and
in person.
The attendance set an unof
ficial Game Day record, and the
scene was absolutely electric as
the students packed in like sar
dines and plenty of Sooner fans
made the trek from Norman to
get a look at what has become a
mainstay of Saturdays in the
fall.
Now in its 25th season,

Game Day is making its first
ever trip to the Farm on Satur
day, and with current under
graduate enrollment hovering
around 7,000 students, the
show's producers probably
ought not to worry about the lo
gistical problems of cramming
tens of thousands of screaming
fans into the Oval which is
where the show's set will be lo
cated on Saturday morning.
But while the stereotypes
that have surrounded Stanford
football fans for years and
painted them as fair-weather
and apathetic are certainly
swirling, Saturday presents a
unique opportunity in many of
the students' and players' eyes
to show that just like the Cardi
nal, fans on campus can surprise
you.
Damian McGlothin 'l5 said

he doesn't think that the previ
ous years of weak attendance
and general disinterest in the
football program mean any
thing at this point.
"Many people around my
dorm are itching with anticipa
tion, and the casual talk that
once covered anything from
school to music is now solely
centered around the game on
Saturday," McGlothin said.
"People are hyping it up to be a
defining moment for them as a
Stanford student. This is the
biggest football game that has
been played at Stanford in a
very long time.
"The prejudice that Stan
ford doesn't care about college
football is floating throughout
sports media," he continued,
"and I think we as students feel
the need to rise to the occasion
and show everyone that we are
in fact passionate football fans
on the Farm."
The producers of the show
and some of the analysts cer
tainly hope McGlothin isn't in
the minority, and that students
and fans will brave the cold and
dark to be in the Oval when the
show's first segment kicks off at
6 a.m. on Saturday morning.
"People always ask what's
the best place we've ever been,"
said Game Day producer Tom
Engle, "and I always tell them
someplace we've never been.
We've never been to Palo Alto,
and expectations are obviously
very high for the show. Our tal
ent really feeds off the energy of
the crowd.
"We've been places where peo
ple are camping out at 10 p.m.
the night before, and we also an
ticipate some really creative
and intelligent signs going to a
place like Stanford," he said.
The program has expanded
dramatically since it first aired
as a 30-minute college football
report in 1987 with Tim Brando,
Beano Cook and Corso, taking
on a new life when in 1993 it
started visiting schools around
the country each Saturday and
filming the show live in front of
the fans.

phenomenon amongst college cam
puses," Engle said. "When we come
to town, it's almost like a concert,
and the whole production is taking
on a life of its own."
Stanford players admitted that
despite some of their best efforts, it
is impossible to ignore how much
hoopla is surrounding the matchup
with Oregon, and having a brand
like Game Day descend on campus
makes the game all the more special
to them.
"You know it helps, when it's a
home game and you know that the
crowd's going to be into it, and
Game Day's here," said junior full

back Ryan Hewitt. "Those are obvi
ously all external factors that you
don't really think about a lot as a
player, but in the back of your mind
it excites you. It gives you a little
extra juice, I think, when you know
the stadium's going to be rocking,
and people are really excited about
the game."
David Pollack, one of the show's
analysts, noted how the presence of
so much hype can be dangerous for
players, something he knows all too
well after playing linebacker for the
University of Georgia and the
Cincinnati Bengals.
"You have to manage your emo
tions," he said. "It's important that
you don't get too jacked up. I re
member I used to jump around the
hotel room all day when we had a
night game, but as you get older you
get more accustomed to it. Oregon

has been on a national stage plenty
of times in the last year with the
BCS title game and opening this
season against LSU. And Stanford
had its big moment winning the Or
ange Bowl, so I expect both teams
to be able to overcome the chal
lenge."
But before the game is played,
Stanford will have to overcome its
own hurdle and prove that the cul
ture in the stands which many
students interviewed for this article
remember being consistently half
empty as recently as 2008 is
changing alongside the brand of
Stanford football.
Redshirt junior quarterback An
drew Luck has spent almost two
years in the national spotlight, and
the Heisman Trophy candidate said
it's an interesting perspective to see
how a program can evolve in just a

few seasons.
Luck acknowledged the sizeable
group of students who traveled to
USC for the matchup two weeks
ago which was also featured on
Game Day and despite eschew
ing iPhones, Facebook and their ac
companying portals to the fan cul
ture, he said it's clear that things are
starting to feel a little different.
"It's fun to be part of a culture
change," Luck said.
And those with a little more ex
perience on campus say this game
and this atmosphere present a big
chance for Stanford to make a
name for itself on the football
scene.
"I've been involved with the
Stanford community since 1985,
and once upon a time Stanford fans
were fair-weather fans," said fresh
man dean Julie Lythcott-Haims.

"That's changing. I can feel it
changing."
"And I don't think there are any
students more proud of their uni
versity than Stanford students. We
love with this place. Game Day is an
opportunity provided by ESPN
and our football team for us to
show the entire nation how ab
solutely in love with Stanford we
are," she added.
ESPN College Game Day Built
by The Home Depot will begin al
lowing students onto the set at 4
a.m. Saturday morning. The show
will air at 6 a.m. on ESPNU, contin
uing on ESPN from 7 a.m. until 9
a.m. The matchup between No. 3
Stanford and No. 6 Oregon will kick
off at 5 p.m. from Stanford Stadium.

phenomenon amongst college cam
puses," Engle said. "When we come
to town, it's almost like a concert,
and the whole production is taking
on a life of its own."
Stanford players admitted that
despite some of their best efforts, it
is impossible to ignore how much
hoopla is surrounding the matchup
with Oregon, and having a brand
like Game Day descend on campus
makes the game all the more special
to them.
"You know it helps, when it's a
home game and you know that the
crowd's going to be into it, and
Game Day's here," said junior full

back Ryan Hewitt. "Those are obvi
ously all external factors that you
don't really think about a lot as a
player, but in the back of your mind
it excites you. It gives you a little
extra juice, I think, when you know
the stadium's going to be rocking,
and people are really excited about
the game."
David Pollack, one of the show's
analysts, noted how the presence of
so much hype can be dangerous for
players, something he knows all too
well after playing linebacker for the
University of Georgia and the
Cincinnati Bengals.
"You have to manage your emo
tions," he said. "It's important that
you don't get too jacked up. I re
member I used to jump around the
hotel room all day when we had a
night game, but as you get older you
get more accustomed to it. Oregon

has been on a national stage plenty
of times in the last year with the
BCS title game and opening this
season against LSU. And Stanford
had its big moment winning the Or
ange Bowl, so I expect both teams
to be able to overcome the chal
lenge."
But before the game is played,
Stanford will have to overcome its
own hurdle and prove that the cul
ture in the stands which many
students interviewed for this article
remember being consistently half
empty as recently as 2008 is
changing alongside the brand of
Stanford football.
Redshirt junior quarterback An
drew Luck has spent almost two
years in the national spotlight, and
the Heisman Trophy candidate said
it's an interesting perspective to see
how a program can evolve in just a

few seasons.
Luck acknowledged the sizeable
group of students who traveled to
USC for the matchup two weeks
ago which was also featured on
Game Day and despite eschew
ing iPhones, Facebook and their ac
companying portals to the fan cul
ture, he said it's clear that things are
starting to feel a little different.
"It's fun to be part of a culture
change," Luck said.
And those with a little more ex
perience on campus say this game
and this atmosphere present a big
chance for Stanford to make a
name for itself on the football
scene.
"I've been involved with the
Stanford community since 1985,
and once upon a time Stanford fans
were fair-weather fans," said fresh
man dean Julie Lythcott-Haims.

"That's changing. I can feel it
changing."
"And I don't think there are any
students more proud of their uni
versity than Stanford students. We
love with this place. Game Day is an
opportunity provided by ESPN
and our football team for us to
show the entire nation how ab
solutely in love with Stanford we
are," she added.
ESPN College Game Day Built
by The Home Depot will begin al
lowing students onto the set at 4
a.m. Saturday morning. The show
will air at 6 a.m. on ESPNU, contin
uing on ESPN from 7 a.m. until 9

Stanford and No. 6 Oregon will kick
off at 5 p.m. from Stanford Stadium.

The Oval might usually seem pretty mellow, but that is not what Stanford students are hoping for tomorrow morning as they plan to convey a rambunctious message on national television.
When ESPN's College
Game Day program set up shop
last October at the University
of Missouri for the Tigers'
showdown against then-No. 1
Oklahoma (a remarkable game
as upsets go), an estimated
18,000 fans showed up to watch
Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and
the boys do their thing live and
in person.
The attendance set an unof
ficial Game Day record, and the
scene was absolutely electric as
the students packed in like sar
dines and plenty of Sooner fans
made the trek from Norman to
get a look at what has become a
mainstay of Saturdays in the
fall.
Now in its 25th season,

Game Day is making its first
ever trip to the Farm on Satur
day, and with current under
graduate enrollment hovering
around 7,000 students, the
show's producers probably
ought not to worry about the lo
gistical problems of cramming
tens of thousands of screaming
fans into the Oval which is
where the show's set will be lo
cated on Saturday morning.
But while the stereotypes
that have surrounded Stanford
football fans for years and
painted them as fair-weather
and apathetic are certainly
swirling, Saturday presents a
unique opportunity in many of
the students' and players' eyes
to show that just like the Cardi
nal, fans on campus can surprise
you.
Damian McGlothin 'l5 said

he doesn't think that the previ
ous years of weak attendance
and general disinterest in the
football program mean any
thing at this point.
"Many people around my
dorm are itching with anticipa
tion, and the casual talk that
once covered anything from
school to music is now solely
centered around the game on
Saturday," McGlothin said.
"People are hyping it up to be a
defining moment for them as a
Stanford student. This is the
biggest football game that has
been played at Stanford in a
very long time.
"The prejudice that Stan
ford doesn't care about college
football is floating throughout
sports media," he continued,
"and I think we as students feel
the need to rise to the occasion
and show everyone that we are
in fact passionate football fans
on the Farm."
The producers of the show
and some of the analysts cer
tainly hope McGlothin isn't in
the minority, and that students
and fans will brave the cold and
dark to be in the Oval when the
show's first segment kicks off at
6 a.m. on Saturday morning.
"People always ask what's
the best place we've ever been,"
said Game Day producer Tom
Engle, "and I always tell them
someplace we've never been.
We've never been to Palo Alto,
and expectations are obviously
very high for the show. Our tal
ent really feeds off the energy of
the crowd.
"We've been places where peo
ple are camping out at 10 p.m.
the night before, and we also an
ticipate some really creative
and intelligent signs going to a
place like Stanford," he said.
The program has expanded
dramatically since it first aired
as a 30-minute college football
report in 1987 with Tim Brando,
Beano Cook and Corso, taking
on a new life when in 1993 it
started visiting schools around
the country each Saturday and
filming the show live in front of
the fans.

had its big moment winning the Or
ange Bowl, so I expect both teams
to be able to overcome the chal
lenge."
But before the game is played,
Stanford will have to overcome its
own hurdle and prove that the cul
ture in the stands which many
students interviewed for this article
remember being consistently half
empty as recently as 2008 is
changing alongside the brand of
Stanford football.
Redshirt junior quarterback An
drew Luck has spent almost two
years in the national spotlight, and
the Heisman Trophy candidate said
it's an interesting perspective to see
how a program can evolve in just a

few seasons.
Luck acknowledged the sizeable
group of students who traveled to
USC for the matchup two weeks
ago which was also featured on
Game Day and despite eschew
ing iPhones, Facebook and their ac
companying portals to the fan cul
ture, he said it's clear that things are
starting to feel a little different.
"It's fun to be part of a culture
change," Luck said.
And those with a little more ex
perience on campus say this game
and this atmosphere present a big
chance for Stanford to make a
name for itself on the football
scene.
"I've been involved with the
Stanford community since 1985,
and once upon a time Stanford fans
were fair-weather fans," said fresh
man dean Julie Lythcott-Haims.

"That's changing. I can feel it
changing."
"And I don't think there are any
students more proud of their uni
versity than Stanford students. We
love with this place. Game Day is an
opportunity provided by ESPN
and our football team for us to
show the entire nation how ab
solutely in love with Stanford we
are," she added.
ESPN College Game Day Built
by The Home Depot will begin al
lowing students onto the set at 4
a.m. Saturday morning. The show
will air at 6 a.m. on ESPNU, contin
uing on ESPN from 7 a.m. until 9
a.m. The matchup between No. 3
Stanford and No. 6 Oregon will kick
off at 5 p.m. from Stanford Stadium.

The Oval might usually seem pretty mellow, but that is not what Stanford students are hoping for tomorrow morning as they plan to convey a rambunctious message on national television.
