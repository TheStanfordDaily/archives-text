NO. 4 STANFORD (9-0,7-0 PAC-12)

MILES BENNETT-SMITH
STANFORD 42, OREGON 31 : if there is
anything that can stop Stanford's power run
game, it isn't Oregon. As fast and athletic as the
Ducks are on offense and they are lightning
quick I think that Stanford will wear their de
fense down with several long drives in the third
quarter. While many are predicting scores in the
50's, I think that the Cardinal will hold the ball as
long as it can, slowing the tempo and further
holding back the Ducks'speed. The return of De
lano Howell gives Stanford the tackling mean
streak it has been missing since he and Shane
Skov left the field, and I think that Oregon hits on
a few homerun plays, but the Cardinal limits the
damage and keeps its title hopes alive.
JACOB JAFFE
STANFORD 51, OREGON 42: THIS
game is incredibly tough to call. Both teams are
built perfectly to exploit the other's weakness,
and each is nearly unstoppable at its own game.
Stanford comes in with more significant injury
concerns, as the Cardinal will be without Skov,
Owusu and Ertz. Williamson and Fleming are
also questionable, and Toilolo and Howell will
play coming off injuries of their own. This will be
a huge hurdle for the Cardinal to climb, but not
nearly as big as the speed of the Ducks. Oregon
can make plays in space better than any other
team in the country, and Stanford will struggle to
bring any Duck ball-carrier down past the line of
scrimmage. In the end, I see it coming down to
someone stepping up to make a big play, and I
think Andrew Luck in front of his home crowd will
do just enough to replicate 2009's scoreline and
keep the Cardinal undefeated.
JACK BLANCHAT
STANFORD 51, OREGON 48:
I like the Cardinal in this one because it has yet
to play its best football this season, and I think it
will rise to the occasion with a spectacular per
formance on all sides of the ball. Of course, the
Ducks are going to score a ton of points, but
anybody who watched Andrew Luck dig deep
and rip that victory against USC right out of the
jaws of defeat knows better than to bet against
him in a big game like this one. I think Stanford
will get a big play on special teams that gives it
an early edge. Then the Card rides Luck's able
right arm to a big win that preserves the unde
feated season.
