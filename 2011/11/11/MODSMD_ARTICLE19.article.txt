# POSTSEASON NOVELTY
## CARD VIES FOR TOURNEY WIN 
### SARAH MAISEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the sting from last week
end's heartbreaking 1-0 loss to Cal
ifornia in the NorPac Champi
onship may not have subsided yet,
the No. 10 Stanford (17-3, 6-0 Nor-
Pac) field hockey team can look
ahead to the postseason after earn
ing its first ever at-large bid to the
NCAA Tournament. Receiving the
seventh seed, the Cardinal will
begin play this weekend at host Old
Dominion in Norfolk, Va. against
tenth-seeded Duke (13-7, 2-3
ACC).
The bid caps what has been an
incredible season for Stanford.
Until the NorPac Championship,
the team had not lost at home since
Sept. 19,2010. While some may rush
to point out the Cardinal's relative
ly weak conference schedule, Stan
ford regularly blew conference op
ponents out by three or more goals.
Seven of the 17 wins were shutouts,
including four consecutive games
until Stanford's 7-2 win over David
son in the NorPac semifinals. The
biggest win of the season came
against Michigan, the eventual Big
Ten Tournament runner-up, show
ing that the Card's success is not just
a product of geography.
Although Duke holds the weak
er record and lower seed, the Blue
Devils proved this season that they
can hold their own against some of
the nation's strongest programs.
The ACC is arguably the sport's
most competitive conference. ACC
teams have been to the tournament
championship 33 times, and at least
one conference team has played in
the final since 1992. The past nine
champions and runner-ups have all
been from the ACC, shutting out
even Big East powerhouses like
Connecticut and Syracuse.

Duke played at its best against
the country's top teams and is com
ing off a loss in the ACC Champi
onship against No. 1 North Caroli
na. Duke is 2-3 against top-five op
ponents, and two of those losses
came in double overtime. They also
beat then-No. 1 Old Dominion,
handing the Lady Monarchs their
first of only two losses.
Against weaker teams, however,
Duke has often played down to
their opponents. Even in games
where the Blue Devils dominated
possession and offensive attack, the
game-winning goals were often not
scored until the final minute. Duke
only narrowly defeated much weak
er teams like Longwood, Boston
University and Wake Forest by just
one goal each. Seven of their games
have gone on past regulation, which
is impressive against teams like Old
Dominion and North Carolina but
questionable in losses against un
ranked Indiana and Virginia. While
the loss in Bloomington was only
the second game of the year, Vir
ginia's upset finished regular season
play and came in penalty strokes
after Duke could not convert in two
overtimes.
Given the success and rank of
Stanford, it is likely that Duke will
show up hungry and ready to play.
Goalkeeper Ale Moss and the rest
of the Cardinal defense must stop
sophomore Emmie Le Marchand,
who leads the Blue Devils with 16
goals and is tied with senior Rhian
Jones for seven assists. Jones and
fellow senior Tara Jennings both
have over 50 shots for the season, so
Stanford must be prepared for
Duke's explosive offense. On the
other side of the field, the Cardinal
must attack early and often against
Blue Devil redshirt senior goal
keeper Samantha Nelson, who
boasts a .711 save percentage and a
goals-against-average of 1.26. After
failing to score against Cal, the Car
dinal offense should be anxious to

avenge its last loss and win its first
ever NCAA Tournament game.
If Stanford had won the NorPac
Championship as most expected, it
would have earned a play-in game to
get to the NCAA Tournament. But
with the unexpected loss, the Cardi
nal got a week of rest and drew a
lower-ranked opponent. Yet play-in
victors generally have the lowest
seeds of the tournament, thus must
immediately play the top. Califor
nia, this year's conference champi
on, is already out after it lost its play
in game to Richmond. If the Golden

Bears had won, they would be on
track to play Syracuse, the tourna
ment's No. 3 seed. Earning an at
large bid seems to have put the Car
dinal in better position to secure its
first-ever NCAA Tournament win.
Should Stanford do so, it will
face the winner of the No. 2-No. 15
matchup between Old Dominion
and Ohio State. Last weekend may
not have ended the way the Cardi
nal was accustomed to, but after so
many years of losing in the first
round of the tournament, maybe
the change in conventional wisdom
is just what this team needed.
Stanford will face Duke tomor
row at 11 a.m. in Norfolk.
