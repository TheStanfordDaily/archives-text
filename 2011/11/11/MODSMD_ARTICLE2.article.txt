# SHOW TIME
## TITLE HOPES ON THE LINE 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
When the sun rises on a duck hunt, you can
only see the shadows. Their wings hum, barely
audible in the cold. But you know the birds are
there, circling you, waiting.
It's been the same way for the Stanford foot
ball team this entire season everywhere it
goes, it can hear the sounds and see the shad
ows. The Oregon Ducks have been circling all
season long.
Now, the No. 4 Cardinal (9-0,7-0 Pac-12) fi
nally gets its chance to knock off the No. 6
Ducks (8-1,6-0) on Saturday in a game that will
likely decide the Pac-12 championship and de
termine which squad will remain in the hunt for
a national title.
Stanford will welcome the eyes of the na
tional media and the focus of ESPN's College
Game Day on Saturday, as the matchup with
Oregon was expected to be an important show
down even before the season started. The two
squads now get their chance to embrace the
season-long hype.
"We've been keeping this under wraps the
whole season, but this is what we've been
preparing for," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "I'll just say, we've had this game cir
cled since the last time we played them."
"We absolutely can admit that," said offen
sive line coach Mike Bloomgren. "Since I came
in here, I heard a lot of talk about Oregon...
This is why you do this. Whether you're a play
er or a coach, you live for games like this."
And if being in the hunt for a BCS title did
n't provide enough motivation, Stanford's last
loss before starting its current 17-game win
streak was a 52-31 defeat at the hands of Ore
gon last season.
After opening up a 21-3 lead in the first
quarter last year, the Cardinal fell victim to the

Ducks' speed and two costly second-half
turnovers that allowed Oregon to run away
with the victory by scoring 28 unanswered
points something that provides no extra mo
tivation this time around to redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck.
"I try to put it out of my memory for the
most part," Luck said. "It was last year, maybe
some guys use it for revenge, but last year has
no bearing on this year."
If Stanford hopes to keep its current win

streak alive, it must first slow down the electric
Oregon offense, which averages 46 points per
game thanks to rapid scoring drives that give
the Ducks the lowest average time of posses
sion in the Pac-f 2.
Sophomore linebacker Jarek Lancaster said
the key to stopping the Ducks' attack is hem
ming in running backs LaMichael James,
De' Anthony Thomas and Kenjon Barner.
Redshirt junior James leads the nation in
rushing yards per game with over 151 per con

test, and freshman Thomas has scored 12 touch
downs this season, the most for any true fresh
man. Together, the three running backs spear
head an offense that averages over 510 yards a
game 298 of them on the ground.
"They have two speeds: fast and really, really
fast," Lancaster said. "We've got to cage them
in. We've got to set the edges and force every
thing inside. That's where the teeth of our de-

fense is. If we keep them caged, we'll
do really well. We just can't let them
out."

Lancaster did acknowledge that
stopping the Quack Attack was
easier said than done.
"It's pretty tough ... well, it's
really tough. I'm not gonna sugar
coat that one," he said. "There is no
freelancing on these guys, because
they will burn you."
Senior safety Delano Howell
will return to action this weekend
after missing the last three games
with a hand injury. Howell will play
with a cast on his injured right hand
similar to the one he wore last sea
son when he injured the same
hand.
While countering the Oregon
offense on the defensive side of the
ball will be an exceptional chal
lenge for the llth-ranked Stanford
defense, the offense will look to
continue performing at its already
authoritative pace,
Stanford is the only team in the
Pac-12 to average more points per
game than the Ducks, tallying 48.2
points per contest in a fashion that
strongly contrasts with the Ducks'
(the Cardinal offense leads the
conference in time of possession.)
Head coach David Shaw said
the trick to countering the Ducks'
offense will lie in maximizing the
Cardinal scoring output on every
offensive possession.
"Against this team, it's time of
possession plus touchdowns," he
said. "You can hold the ball for a
while and kick field goals and lose
by 28 points ... If you're kicking
field goals and they are scoring
touchdowns, you don't have a
chance regardless of what the time
of possession is."
But perhaps the most important
matchup for the offense will be keep
ing Luck upright and in position to
pick apart the Oregon defense.

The Ducks lead the conference
with 29 sacks this season the
sixth-most in the country but
the Stanford offensive line has only
allowed four sacks all year, tied for
the best mark in the country.
Bloomgren said the Ducks'
swarming defense reminded him of
his days as a coach with the NFL's
New York Jets.
"They're very similar to an NFL
team," Bloomgren said. "They list
themselves as a 4-3 team, but
they're a [Patriots head coach] Bill
Belichick 3-4 scheme, and they're
very different than anything we've
played. It feels like preparing for
New England."
And while the Cardinal defense
returns one of its most important
players this weekend, the offense
will be hampered by the loss of two
of its biggest contributors.
For the second week in a row,
junior tight end Zach Ertz will be
sidelined with a knee injury, and
senior wide receiver Chris Owusu
will be out after sustaining a con
cussion last weekend. The two have
combined for 57 catches, 684 yards
and five touchdowns so far this
year. Freshman Ty Montgomery
will start at receiver in Owusu's
stead.
Despite the injuries, the Ducks'
speed and the national spotlight,
Shaw says his team is fully aware
that those circling shadows are now
plain to see. The only question that
remains is if the Cardinal can
knock them out of the air or if
these Ducks are fast enough to es
cape unscathed.
"It's not about being nervous,"
Shaw said. "It's about saying, hey,
you know what, we've played well
this year, but in this game we've got
to play better than we've played all
year. That's just a fact."
Stanford and Oregon clash for
Pac-12 supremacy this Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. Kickoff is
scheduled for 5 p.m., with national
television coverage on ABC.

will return to action this weekend
after missing the last three games
with a hand injury. Howell will play
with a cast on his injured right hand
similar to the one he wore last sea
son when he injured the same
hand.
While countering the Oregon
offense on the defensive side of the
ball will be an exceptional chal
lenge for the llth-ranked Stanford
defense, the offense will look to
continue performing at its already
authoritative pace,
Stanford is the only team in the
Pac-12 to average more points per
game than the Ducks, tallying 48.2
points per contest in a fashion that
strongly contrasts with the Ducks'
(the Cardinal offense leads the
conference in time of possession.)
Head coach David Shaw said
the trick to countering the Ducks'
offense will lie in maximizing the
Cardinal scoring output on every
offensive possession.
"Against this team, it's time of
possession plus touchdowns," he
said. "You can hold the ball for a
while and kick field goals and lose
by 28 points ... If you're kicking
field goals and they are scoring
touchdowns, you don't have a
chance regardless of what the time
of possession is."
But perhaps the most important
matchup for the offense will be keep
ing Luck upright and in position to
pick apart the Oregon defense.

The Ducks lead the conference
with 29 sacks this season the
sixth-most in the country but
the Stanford offensive line has only
allowed four sacks all year, tied for
the best mark in the country.
Bloomgren said the Ducks'
swarming defense reminded him of
his days as a coach with the NFL's
New York Jets.
"They're very similar to an NFL
team," Bloomgren said. "They list
themselves as a 4-3 team, but
they're a [Patriots head coach] Bill
Belichick 3-4 scheme, and they're
very different than anything we've
played. It feels like preparing for
New England."
And while the Cardinal defense
returns one of its most important
players this weekend, the offense
will be hampered by the loss of two
of its biggest contributors.
For the second week in a row,
junior tight end Zach Ertz will be
sidelined with a knee injury, and
senior wide receiver Chris Owusu
will be out after sustaining a con
cussion last weekend. The two have
combined for 57 catches, 684 yards
and five touchdowns so far this
year. Freshman Ty Montgomery
will start at receiver in Owusu's
stead.
Despite the injuries, the Ducks'
speed and the national spotlight,
Shaw says his team is fully aware
that those circling shadows are now
plain to see. The only question that
remains is if the Cardinal can
knock them out of the air or if
these Ducks are fast enough to es
cape unscathed.
"It's not about being nervous,"
Shaw said. "It's about saying, hey,
you know what, we've played well
this year, but in this game we've got
to play better than we've played all
year. That's just a fact."
Stanford and Oregon clash for
Pac-12 supremacy this Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. Kickoff is
scheduled for 5 p.m., with national
television coverage on ABC.

When the sun rises on a duck hunt, you can
only see the shadows. Their wings hum, barely
audible in the cold. But you know the birds are
there, circling you, waiting.
It's been the same way for the Stanford foot
ball team this entire season everywhere it
goes, it can hear the sounds and see the shad
ows. The Oregon Ducks have been circling all
season long.
Now, the No. 4 Cardinal (9-0,7-0 Pac-12) fi
nally gets its chance to knock off the No. 6
Ducks (8-1,6-0) on Saturday in a game that will
likely decide the Pac-12 championship and de
termine which squad will remain in the hunt for
a national title.
Stanford will welcome the eyes of the na
tional media and the focus of ESPN's College
Game Day on Saturday, as the matchup with
Oregon was expected to be an important show
down even before the season started. The two
squads now get their chance to embrace the
season-long hype.
"We've been keeping this under wraps the
whole season, but this is what we've been
preparing for," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "I'll just say, we've had this game cir
cled since the last time we played them."
"We absolutely can admit that," said offen
sive line coach Mike Bloomgren. "Since I came
in here, I heard a lot of talk about Oregon...
This is why you do this. Whether you're a play
er or a coach, you live for games like this."
And if being in the hunt for a BCS title did
n't provide enough motivation, Stanford's last
loss before starting its current 17-game win
streak was a 52-31 defeat at the hands of Ore
gon last season.
After opening up a 21-3 lead in the first
quarter last year, the Cardinal fell victim to the

Ducks' speed and two costly second-half
turnovers that allowed Oregon to run away
with the victory by scoring 28 unanswered
points something that provides no extra mo
tivation this time around to redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck.
"I try to put it out of my memory for the
most part," Luck said. "It was last year, maybe
some guys use it for revenge, but last year has
no bearing on this year."
If Stanford hopes to keep its current win

streak alive, it must first slow down the electric
Oregon offense, which averages 46 points per
game thanks to rapid scoring drives that give
the Ducks the lowest average time of posses
sion in the Pac-f 2.
Sophomore linebacker Jarek Lancaster said
the key to stopping the Ducks' attack is hem
ming in running backs LaMichael James,
De' Anthony Thomas and Kenjon Barner.
Redshirt junior James leads the nation in
rushing yards per game with over 151 per con

test, and freshman Thomas has scored 12 touch
downs this season, the most for any true fresh
man. Together, the three running backs spear
head an offense that averages over 510 yards a
game 298 of them on the ground.
"They have two speeds: fast and really, really
fast," Lancaster said. "We've got to cage them
in. We've got to set the edges and force every
thing inside. That's where the teeth of our de-

fense is. If we keep them caged, we'll
do really well. We just can't let them
out."

Lancaster did acknowledge that
stopping the Quack Attack was
easier said than done.
"It's pretty tough ... well, it's
really tough. I'm not gonna sugar
coat that one," he said. "There is no
freelancing on these guys, because
they will burn you."
