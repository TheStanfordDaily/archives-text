## TITLE HOPES ON THE LINE 
### JACK BLANCHAT DESK EDITOR 
When the sun rises on a duck hunt, you can
only see the shadows. Their wings hum, barely
audible in the cold. But you know the birds are
there, circling you, waiting.
It's been the same way for the Stanford foot
ball team this entire season everywhere it
goes, it can hear the sounds and see the shad
ows. The Oregon Ducks have been circling all
season long.
Now, the No. 4 Cardinal (9-0,7-0 Pac-12) fi
nally gets its chance to knock off the No. 6
Ducks (8-1,6-0) on Saturday in a game that will
likely decide the Pac-12 championship and de
termine which squad will remain in the hunt for
a national title.
Stanford will welcome the eyes of the na
tional media and the focus of ESPN's College
Game Day on Saturday, as the matchup with
Oregon was expected to be an important show
down even before the season started. The two
squads now get their chance to embrace the
season-long hype.
"We've been keeping this under wraps the
whole season, but this is what we've been
preparing for," said senior safety Michael
Thomas. "I'll just say, we've had this game cir
cled since the last time we played them."
"We absolutely can admit that," said offen
sive line coach Mike Bloomgren. "Since I came
in here, I heard a lot of talk about Oregon...
This is why you do this. Whether you're a play
er or a coach, you live for games like this."
And if being in the hunt for a BCS title did
n't provide enough motivation, Stanford's last
loss before starting its current 17-game win
streak was a 52-31 defeat at the hands of Ore
gon last season.
After opening up a 21-3 lead in the first
quarter last year, the Cardinal fell victim to the

Ducks' speed and two costly second-half
turnovers that allowed Oregon to run away
with the victory by scoring 28 unanswered
points something that provides no extra mo
tivation this time around to redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck.
"I try to put it out of my memory for the
most part," Luck said. "It was last year, maybe
some guys use it for revenge, but last year has
no bearing on this year."
If Stanford hopes to keep its current win

streak alive, it must first slow down the electric
Oregon offense, which averages 46 points per
game thanks to rapid scoring drives that give
the Ducks the lowest average time of posses
sion in the Pac-f 2.
Sophomore linebacker Jarek Lancaster said
the key to stopping the Ducks' attack is hem
ming in running backs LaMichael James,
De' Anthony Thomas and Kenjon Barner.
Redshirt junior James leads the nation in
rushing yards per game with over 151 per con

test, and freshman Thomas has scored 12 touch
downs this season, the most for any true fresh
man. Together, the three running backs spear
head an offense that averages over 510 yards a
game 298 of them on the ground.
"They have two speeds: fast and really, really
fast," Lancaster said. "We've got to cage them
in. We've got to set the edges and force every
thing inside. That's where the teeth of our de-
