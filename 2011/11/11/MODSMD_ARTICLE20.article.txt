# RUN AT TITLE STARTS NOW
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
It's hard to imagine, but there
was once a time when Stanford's
women's soccer team did not play
in the NCAA Tournament. In 1997,
despite going 10-6-1, the Cardinal
failed to make the postseason and
was forced to sit on the sidelines
while Anson Dorrance and North
Carolina won its 14th NCAA title.
Tonight, No. 1 Stanford (19-0-1)
will open its playoff run against the
University of Montana, a 14th
straight NCAA Tournament ap
pearance for the Card that comes
on the heels of a third consecutive
undefeated regular season.

And it's getting to be old hat.
"It's business as usual," said
head coach Paul Ratcliffe. "We're
excited for the challenge, and we
want to prove that we're the best
team in the country."
The Pac-12 champion Cardinal
was awarded the No. 1 overall seed
for the tournament and will host
the Grizzlies (6-11-4), the upset
minded champions of the Big Sky
Conference Tournament.
Montana, however, could be in
for a rude awakening against Stan
ford, which has won its last five
opening matches and been to the
NCAA College Cup semifinals the
last three years, losing to North
Carolina and Notre Dame in the

championship the past two sea
sons.

While Ratcliffe cautioned
against overlooking any opponent,
the Grizzlies are the only sub-.500
squad in the 64-team field, having
defeated Weber State on penalty
kicks in the Big Sky Championship
after finishing fourth in conference
play. They have scored more than
two goals in a game just twice this
season and haven't won a game in
regulation since a 1-0 victory over
Northern Arizona on October 21.

Even so, Montana is a program
on the rise under first-year head
coach Mark Plakorus, and the play
ers remained undaunted in inter
views. All-Big Sky defender Lau
ren Costa said she respects Stan
ford and its vaunted lineup, but is
not in the least bit intimidated at
being an underdog.
"Stanford is obviously a very
good program, and they deserve to
be a No. 1 seed," Costa told The
Missoulian on Monday. "But I'm
excited to show them what Mon
tana is all about, [to show them]
that the Big Sky Conference is a re
ally good conference and to make a
name for ourselves."
Ratcliffe agreed that no one can
feel safe when one loss sends a
team home for good, no matter
what seed it is.
"Once you get to the playoffs
everyone has a target on them," he
told GoStanford.com. "Everyone
feels the pressure in the playoffs.
It's how you perform on the day,
and how competitive you are on
the day."
But Stanford definitely has a se
rious edge heading into the game
on paper. Apart from junior for
ward Erin Craig, who leads the
Grizzlies with 10 goals, and sopho
more India Watne, Montana has
little offensive firepower, which
will make it tough to score against
a Cardinal defense that has al
lowed just eight goals all season.

Camille Levin, Teresa Noyola,
Lindsay Taylor and Kristy Zur

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal's quest for an
NCAA title begins against the Big Sky
champ, Montana. Stanford went
undefeated the last two seasons before
falling in the NCAA final each time.


SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
Freshman forward sensation Chioma Ubogagu wasn't with the team when
it dropped consecutive College Cup Finals over the past two years, but the
near-titles have become an inspiration for the Cardinal all season long.
Stanford will have to take care of Montana tonight before another run.
