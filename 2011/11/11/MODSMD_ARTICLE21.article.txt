# CROSS COUNTRY
## Card hopes to bounce back 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
After coming up just short at
the Pac-12 Championships two
weeks ago, both the men's and
women's cross country teams will
be looking to pick up the pace
and qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships tomorrow morning
when they host the 2011 NCAA
West Regional at the Stanford
Golf Course.
The top two teams in each race
the men's 10K run will start at
10 a.m. with the women's 6K to
follow at 11:15 qualify auto
matically for the NCAA Champi
onships, as do the top four indi
viduals from non-qualifying
teams.
The stakes are high, but as
women's head coach PattiSue
Plumer was quick to point out,
this weekend's event is a tough
race to master from a tactical
standpoint.
"I think that it's easy to over
look Regionals and not take them
seriously enough," she said. "And
then physically you might be fine,
but emotionally you kind of set
yourself up for not as good a meet
at Nationals."
It is unlikely that either Stan
ford team would fail to make it to
the national meet, with 13 at
large bids going to teams around
the country based on a season
long points system from the
NCAA. The men's squad is No. 6
in the country in the rankings, and
the women are No. 8; only a disas
trous run tomorrow could keep
the Cardinal from running in
Terre Haute, Ind. at the NCAA
Championships on Nov. 21.
More important for both
teams will be to rebound from
somewhat disappointing results
at the Pac-12 Championships. On
the men's side, top-four finishes
from seniors Chris Derrick and
Jake Riley had Stanford in seri
ous contention for the team's
third-straight conference title.

But conference newcomer
Colorado stepped in and
snatched away the win. The Car
dinal led through four runners
but couldn't close the deal, and
the No. 4 Buffaloes snuck
through the opening with a
stronger fifth runner for a seven
point victory.
Derrick, a 10-time All-Ameri
can in his career, was visibly upset

after the race despite finishing
second and talked about the men
tal challenges that the team faces
after what was a very good run
from the top four.
"We had a pretty good talk
after the race about refocusing
ourselves, and we're living up to
the kind of team we want to be,"
Derrick said. "It was mostly dis
appointing because we thought
that we beat ourselves in some re
spect. Obviously Colorado is a
very good team and ran a very
good race, but we did not run the
race that we are capable of, which
is always disappointing."
Colorado competes in the
Mountain Regional, and will not
be in the race tomorrow, leaving
Stanford as the favorite. But No. 8
Portland will push the Cardinal,
as will defending champion No.
17 Oregon and No. 21 UCLA.
And it might be tough for Der
rick and Riley not to push them
selves too hard as they compete
for the individual title with fresh
man sensation Lawi Lelang of
Arizona and defending champion
Trevor Dunbar of Portland.
Stanford easily has the most
depth of any of those schools,
with up to 14 runners notching
times of 24:20 or faster for 8,000
meters. But as head coach Jason
Dunn noted, that depth doesn't
matter if the Cardinal can't get
find a fifth runner that can move
up in the field.
"I tell the guys, depth is great,
but what's most important is for
us to figure out how to get five
guys across that finish line before
anybody else," Dunn said. "They
don't score it through 15 runners
if they did we'd be the best
team in the country without ques
tion. It's just a matter of that
depth pushing everybody in front
of them."

The women's race might be
even tighter, however. With one of
the deepest fields in the country
thanks to six ranked teams, Stan
ford will be hard-pressed to snag
one of the automatic bids. No. 6
Washington is the very slight fa
vorite after edging the Cardinal by
a mere two points for second place
behind Colorado at the Pac-12
Championships. But No. 11 Ore
gon— featuring the always-dan
gerous junior Jordan Hasay, win
ner of the Western Regional last
year — is looking to assert itself
before Nationals, along with No. 16
Arizona and No. 26 California.
Junior Kathy Kroeger, who was
the Pac-12 runner-up and finished
fifth last year at this event, said that
the team must remain focused and
not let up during the race.

"I think the biggest challenge is
to not be distracted by being at
home with the big Oregon football
game and all its excitement," she
said. "We have to realize we can't
get too comfortable and remem
ber that this is a big deal and we
have to really bring it just like we
would anywhere else."
At the Pac-12 Championships,
Stanford got big contributions
from Kroeger, senior Stephanie
Marcy and Jessica Tonn. But fresh
man Aisling Cuffe also ran inside

the top 25, finishing 24th in 20:44
despite nearly collapsing 35 meters
from the finish and wobbling
across the line while at least half a
dozen runners passed her.
After suffering through very
hot conditions at the Pac-12
Championships in Arizona, Stan
ford will have the advantage of
running in cooler weather tomor
row on its home course.
