# Eject the headhunters

### Joseph Beyda 
If you've been following NFL
football for a long time, the last
few years have probably been a
real eye-opener when it comes
to the dangers of helmet-to
helmet hits.
If you've been following Stanford
football for a long time, that eye
opener came 11 years ago.
And as a seven-year-old watching
just his third season of Cardinal foot
ball and still hyped up over that excit
ing (albeit unsuccessful) trip to
Pasadena just months before, I had
no idea that on Oct. 28,2000,1 would
watch someone's life shortened first
hand.
I can't say that I remember the
helmet-to-helmet hit that left Wash
ington senior strong safety and NFL
prospect Curtis Williams paralyzed
and led to his death just two years
later. I can't say I remember the rest
of the game, which Stanford lost in
dramatic fashion. From that day, my
only lasting memory is the ambulance
that raced onto the field and carted
Williams away after nearly 15 min
utes on the turf.
So when another ambulance
raced onto the field last Saturday
this time to take off senior Cardinal
wide receiver Chris Owusu, who had
just been knocked out of a game by a
hit to the head for the third time this
season let's just say I had a few
flashbacks.
It's all too easy to say that Owusu
dipped his head at the last second,
that there was nothing junior corner
back Jordan Poyer could've done,
that there shouldn't have been a
penalty call, that Oregon State was
robbed of a touchdown on the ensu
ing fumble. Beaver head coach Mike
Riley felt that way. Fans in Reser Sta
dium felt that way.
That makes just as much sense as
rear-ending someone, checking to
make sure they're all right and upon
noticing that their neck is broken,
asking them, "Can we exchange in
surance cards?"
But I'm not here to cry over spilt
milk. Whether you found the penalty
call or the fans' ensuing boos more
controversial as Owusu was lying on
the field, we need to reconsider how
we penalize helmet-to-helmet hits.
I don't care what Poyer was think
ing, whether he was aiming high or
what he could've done to prevent the
concussion. Hits like that shouldn't
just draw flags; they should require
ejections. Yes, even when the guilty
party is just trying to make a clean
tackle.
It sounds like heresy, but bear with
me for a second. Before team sports
became a professional affair, we had
pick-up games, which went by the
same mantra: If a player gets a scrape,
or breaks his glasses 0r... anything,
really, then someone on the other
team has to sit out, no matter how it
happened. Fast-forward to the mod
em-day college football roster, which
can list a hundred players and still
travel three-deep for road games.
In this setting, an eye for an eye re
ally does not make the whole world
blind.

The same thinking should
apply regardless of intent, like in
hockey, where high-sticking
penalties are almost always a re
sult of carelessness but are called
nonetheless. The NHL is a step
ahead of both college and pro
football because it recognizes
that, at the end of the day, losing a
tooth or an eye, for that matter
just plain sucks, whether it was
intentional or not. (And yes, I real
ly am writing about hockey for the
second straight week. Must be a
Daily record.)
Defensive coordinators and
players alike will argue that
they've been taught to tackle ag
gressively and that significant pun
ishments will scare defenders out

of making big plays. But does that
really matter, when defenders on
both sidelines will have to pull up
from that earthshattering hit?
Worst case scenario, teams will av
erage a touchdown or two more
per game. It wouldn't be the first
time that college sports became
higher-scoring, and I'm not sure
that change in that direction would
be for the worse; before there was
a shot-clock or a three-point arc,
basketball could bore you to tears.
Simply put, it's time to take hel
met-to-helmet hits seriously. It's
not as radical as it sounds. If an of
fensive playmaker goes down, a
defensive playmaker should have
to leave with him. In the grand
scheme of things, if it can help re
duce dangerous injuries, then sit
ting out a game isn't that big a deal.
Curtis Williams had to sit out a
lifetime.

Joseph Bey da has never experienced
a helmet-to-helmet collusion, but it's
on his to-do list. If you'd like to sug
gest how he can safely navigate the
feeling of impact at 16 G's. send him

we penalize helmet-to-helmet hits.
I don't care what Poyer was think
ing, whether he was aiming high or
what he could've done to prevent the
concussion. Hits like that shouldn't
just draw flags; they should require
ejections. Yes, even when the guilty
party is just trying to make a clean
tackle.
It sounds like heresy, but bear with
me for a second. Before team sports
became a professional affair, we had
pick-up games, which went by the
same mantra: If a player gets a scrape,
or breaks his glasses 0r... anything,
really, then someone on the other
team has to sit out, no matter how it
happened. Fast-forward to the mod
em-day college football roster, which
can list a hundred players and still
travel three-deep for road games.
In this setting, an eye for an eye re
ally does not make the whole world
blind.

The same thinking should
apply regardless of intent, like in
hockey, where high-sticking
penalties are almost always a re
sult of carelessness but are called
nonetheless. The NHL is a step
ahead of both college and pro
football because it recognizes
that, at the end of the day, losing a
tooth or an eye, for that matter
just plain sucks, whether it was
intentional or not. (And yes, I real
ly am writing about hockey for the
second straight week. Must be a
Daily record.)
Defensive coordinators and
players alike will argue that
they've been taught to tackle ag
gressively and that significant pun
ishments will scare defenders out

of making big plays. But does that
really matter, when defenders on
both sidelines will have to pull up
from that earthshattering hit?
Worst case scenario, teams will av
erage a touchdown or two more
per game. It wouldn't be the first
time that college sports became
higher-scoring, and I'm not sure
that change in that direction would
be for the worse; before there was
a shot-clock or a three-point arc,
basketball could bore you to tears.
Simply put, it's time to take hel
met-to-helmet hits seriously. It's
not as radical as it sounds. If an of
fensive playmaker goes down, a
defensive playmaker should have
to leave with him. In the grand
scheme of things, if it can help re
duce dangerous injuries, then sit
ting out a game isn't that big a deal.
Curtis Williams had to sit out a
lifetime.
