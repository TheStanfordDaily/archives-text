# YOUTH LOOKS TO CARVE OUT ROLE
## 
### MILES BENNETT-SMITH MANAGING EDITOR 
The NBA lockout may still be dragging on,
but college basketball is here, and the men's
team takes to the hardwood for its season
opener tonight at Maples Pavilion. The Cardi
nal will take on Central Arkansas, looking to
get off to a fast start this season after finishing
last year at the bottom half of the conference.
Led by redshirt senior captain Josh Owens,
who averaged a team-high 6.5 rebounds per
game on top of 11.6 points per game last sea
son, Stanford returns all but one player from
last season's squad that went 15-16. But that
one player is Jeremy Green, who averaged a
team-high 16.7 points per game along with 88
three-pointers Green elected to declare for
the NBA Draft and leave school after his jun
ior season.
In Green's place, however, is freshman
guard Chasson Randle, who will get a chance
to start from day one. One of the most highly
touted combo guards in the country as a senior
from Rock Island High School, Randle shined
during Stanford's six-game preseason trip
through Spain in September, averaging 11
points per game and flashing good speed and
aggression.
Head coach Johnny Dawkins is hopeful
that Randle can gel in a starting lineup that
could be in flux for the first several weeks of
the season. While last season was often a strug
gle without any seniors on the roster, it al
lowed a very deep class of freshmen to see
playing time early and often.
Forward Dwight Powell and guard Antho
ny Brown earned Pac-10 All-Freshman Team
honors with each averaging over eight points
and three rebounds a game. At 6-foot-9, Pow

ell creates plenty of matchup problems for op
posing defenses with his long frame and quick
feet, while Brown shot 35 percent from behind
the arc as a 6-foot-6 guard/forward. Both will
have to take a more active role in the offense
with Green's departure, though Brown's time
playing on USA Basketball's Ul9 World
Championship team will perhaps give him an
added shot of confidence.
It remains to be seen whether the Cardinal
will be able to rebound from the past few dis
appointing seasons, and questions abound
about Stanford's interior defense and offense.
The return of redshirt freshman center
Stephan Nastic, who missed all but five games
last year with a foot injury, ought to be a boost
for the team, as it could allow Owens to play as
a power forward instead of as an undersized
center and bump Powell to the wing.
Against Central Arkansas, however, it will
be important for the Cardinal to test the wa
ters and see how it looks in game action. The
Bears had a disastrous season last year, finish
ing 5-24 overall and 1-15 in conference play,
but have revamped their roster with eight
newcomers. Coached by former NBA player
Corliss Williamson, the Bears probably won't
be the caliber of opponent Stanford will face
day-in and day-out in the Pac-12, but cannot
be overlooked.
Picked to finish sixth in the conference by
the media, the Cardinal does have a little bit of
history on its side for the game tonight
Stanford is 78-18 in season openers and has
won 21 of its last 23.
The first-ever meeting between the two teams
will tip off at 7 p.m. from Maples Pavilion.

Senior guard Jarrett Mann was a defensive standout for Stanford last year, but he and his
teammates will have to improve their offensive output for a top-half Pac-12 finish.
