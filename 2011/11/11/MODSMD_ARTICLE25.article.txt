# No lone star for Card
## DEEP SQUAD BEGINS SEASON AT TEXAS 
### TOM TAYLOR STAFF WRITER 
After sweeping its opposition at home in two pre
season exhibition games, the Stanford women's bas
ketball team travels to Austin tonight to tip-off the reg
ular season. The No. 5 Cardinal will face the No. 24
Longhorns in a rematch of last year's game at Maples,
in which Stanford held out against a resurgence by the
opposition to win 93-78.
Outside of the NCAA Tournament, the Card has
not lost a game since last December, but it is hard to ig
nore the defeat to Texas A&M in the semifinals last
year that doomed it to return yet again empty-handed
from the Final Four. Luckily, though, it faces a different
brand of Texan school tonight, and against the Long
horns the recent record looks to be in Stanford's favor.
The Cardinal leads the current series 4-2, and the four
wins come from the last four meetings. A season-open
ing road game against ranked opposition, however, is
no simple matter, and Texas can take comfort from an
undefeated home opener record (4-0) under head
coach Gail Goestenkors.
The two biggest names in the Cardinal ranks the
Ogwumike sisters, forwards senior Nnemkadi and
sophomore Chiney, both named to the Wooden Award
preseason list may still be there, but after graduat
ing five seniors last year and welcoming six freshmen
to the team, it is perhaps more of an unknown quanti
ty than in recent seasons. This could work in its favor,
but an equally tough away game at such an early point
might highlight the lack of experience within the
squad.
But while the Longhorns have fewer freshmen, the
team is also a relatively young one with a large number
of sophomores and fewer upperclassmen than the
Card. The few seniors, though, look like they should
provide good continuity for the program. Of those re
turning, senior guards Yvonne Anderson and Ashleigh
Fontenette were the highest scorers last season with
11.8 and 11.7 points per game respectively, while sen
ior post Ashley Gayle posted an impressive 241 re
bounds and 117 blocks, a statistic marred slightly by
her 105 personal fouls and the four games she fouled
out of.
For their part, Nnemkadi posted the highest scoring
average of any Cardinal player last year with 17.5
points, and Chiney made 11.7, though she also fouled
out of four games. A basketball team, however, is more
than just two forwards, and players like senior guard
Lindy La Rocque will need to step up into the vacuum

left by the departing WNBA first-round picks forward
Kayla Pedersen and guard Jeanette Pohlen. On the
basis of two exhibition contests the signs are good
with five players not named Ogwumike (including La
Rocque) already having put up double-digits in a game
but tonight will be a sterner test.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer's Cardinal hasn't not
lost at home since Nov. 2007 against the USA na
tional team but road games have been a tougher
proposition. Perhaps the good news may be that four
players freshmen guards Alex Green and Amber
Orrange together with the Ogwumike sisters are
from Texas, making this a home game in its own right.
