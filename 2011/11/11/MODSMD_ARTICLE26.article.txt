### 
Senior left tackle Jonathan Mar
tin and redshirt freshman kicker
Jordan Williamson have received
national recognition in recent
weeks as they continue to aid the
No. 4 Cardinal in its bid for an ap
pearance in the BCS National
Championship.
Martin was named one of four fi
nalists for the Rotary Lombardi
Award, given to the best lineman in
college football in honor of leg
endary football coach Vince Lom
bardi. The only finalist on the offen
sive side of the ball, Martin has pro
tected the blindside of star quarter
back Andrew Luck for three years
and is a mainstay on an offensive
line that is tied for first in the coun
try in sacks allowed, with just four.
Williamson, meanwhile, is one of
20 semi-finalists for the Lou Groza
Collegiate Place-Kicker Award.

After working his way into the
starting spot during fall camp,
Williamson is 11-for-12 this year on
field goals and has missed only two
of his 43 extra-point attempts.
Though currently sidelined with a
leg injury, the Austin native is the
heir apparent to graduated senior
Nate Whitaker, himself a former
Lou Groza semifinalist.
The nominees will be voted on
by all Division I head coaches, along
with national, regional and local
football writers who will select the
three finalists, and the winner will
be announced in December at the
Home Depot ESPNU College
Football Awards Show.
