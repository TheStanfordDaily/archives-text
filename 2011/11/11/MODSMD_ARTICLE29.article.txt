## CELEBRITY WISHES 
### 
In case you haven't been paying attention, today's date is
Nov. 11, 2011 or, in other words, 11-11-11. It's a super day
for wishes, and Intermission hopes you take advantage of
it. (Need a pick-up line tonight? "Hey, it's 11-11-11 and
you're all I'm wishing for, baby." You're welcome.) As certi
fied pop-culture connoisseurs, Intermission feels like we
really know these celebrities and their personalities. Thus,
we've taken the liberty of compiling an exclusive list of
what they are most likely wishing for on this fine day.
Justin Bieber
Bieber is crossing his fingers and hoping that the paternity
test he'll take when he returns to the United States comes up
negative. But realistically, if he doesn't get the result he wants,
he can always just sic his army of manic Beliebers on his
alleged baby-mama, Mariah Yeater. If you're going down,
might as well take her down with you, right? (Didn't that
already happen? Ay-yo!)
Kris Jenner
Jenner is wishing for something else to come along and keep
her and her family (but, let's be real, mostly her) in the spot
light and in a hurry because the news about Kim's
divorce will only keep them in the spotlight for so long. Those
damn tabloid hounds insatiable!
Dr. Conrad Murray
Murray wishes that he had had a better alibi when it came to
the Michael Jackson trial.
Herman Cain
The Republican presidential candidate wishes that no more
women would come forward with sexual assault allegations.
On a side note, he's also probably wishing Haagen-Dazs
would start making some limited-edition black walnut ice
cream again so he could console himself with a bowl.
George Papandreou
Man, everything in Greece kind of sucks right now, so almost
anything he could get would be great. At least it's not really
his problem anymore, as ol' Pappy resigned as prime minister
this week.
