# NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS
## 
### — Patrick Malee, The Daily Emerald — Jack Blanchat, The Stanford Daily 
With one of the biggest football
games in Stanford history upon us,
we asked Patrick Malee of Oregon's
The Daily Emerald and Jack Blan
chat of The Daily to tell us what
might happen if their worst fears are
realized on Saturday night.

Why Stanford will win
My feelings about this game
have swung in so many different di
rections that I'm starting to get
dizzy. On one hand, Stanford is
banged up, missing its best defen
sive player (junior linebacker
Shayne Skov) and most explosive
receiver (senior wide receiver Chris
Owusu). With junior Oregon run
ning back LaMichael James nearing
a full recovery from his elbow dislo
cation against California and junior
quarterback Darron Thomas inch
ing closer to his old self, the Ducks
are near full strength. Oregon has
speed to burn, along with a defense
that has shown flashes of domi
nance, and there's no reason to
think it can't pull the upset on Sat
urday.
I think about all of this, but then
I remember one thing: Stanford still

has Andrew Luck.
Maybe I'm buying a bit too much
into the hype. Oregon, after all, han
dled the presumptive number one
NFL draft pick just fine last season
in a 52-31 victory at Autzen Stadi
um. He's not completely immune to
mistakes (as the USC game two
weeks ago attests), and even a bril
liant performance might not be
enough to keep up with Oregon's
explosive offensive attack.
But there's something about this
season this "last hurrah" cam
paign for Luck that gives me a
bad feeling about Saturday. Some
times, particularly in college foot
ball, a team just seems to have des
tiny on its side. Last year it was Ore
gon, which seemed to avoid every
injury, saw every key piece fall into
place and came out ahead in every
close game (as the Cardinal knows
very well).
It's hard to explain, and practi
cally impossible to quantify. But
how else do you explain USC's
Curtis McNeal fumbling at the
goal line in triple overtime? How

NOTES : Stanford's national title hopes will
face their greatest obstacle in this long
awaited showdown between two top-10
teams. Last year's winner, Oregon, ended
up going to the BCS Championship
Game; Stanford's fate could very well be
the same if it can pull out a victory.



SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
If Stanford wants to survive this much-anticipated showdown with the Ducks,
it will need a stellar performance from its best player, redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck, who was shaky in last year's loss.
