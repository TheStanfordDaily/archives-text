# NIGHTMARE SCENARIOS
## 
### — Patrick Malee, The Daily Emerald — Jack Blanchat, The Stanford Daily 
With one of the biggest football
games in Stanford history upon us,
we asked Patrick Malee of Oregon's
The Daily Emerald and Jack Blan
chat of The Daily to tell us what
might happen if their worst fears are
realized on Saturday night.

Why Stanford will win
My feelings about this game
have swung in so many different di
rections that I'm starting to get
dizzy. On one hand, Stanford is
banged up, missing its best defen
sive player (junior linebacker
Shayne Skov) and most explosive
receiver (senior wide receiver Chris
Owusu). With junior Oregon run
ning back LaMichael James nearing
a full recovery from his elbow dislo
cation against California and junior
quarterback Darron Thomas inch
ing closer to his old self, the Ducks
are near full strength. Oregon has
speed to burn, along with a defense
that has shown flashes of domi
nance, and there's no reason to
think it can't pull the upset on Sat
urday.
I think about all of this, but then
I remember one thing: Stanford still

has Andrew Luck.
Maybe I'm buying a bit too much
into the hype. Oregon, after all, han
dled the presumptive number one
NFL draft pick just fine last season
in a 52-31 victory at Autzen Stadi
um. He's not completely immune to
mistakes (as the USC game two
weeks ago attests), and even a bril
liant performance might not be
enough to keep up with Oregon's
explosive offensive attack.
But there's something about this
season this "last hurrah" cam
paign for Luck that gives me a
bad feeling about Saturday. Some
times, particularly in college foot
ball, a team just seems to have des
tiny on its side. Last year it was Ore
gon, which seemed to avoid every
injury, saw every key piece fall into
place and came out ahead in every
close game (as the Cardinal knows
very well).
It's hard to explain, and practi
cally impossible to quantify. But
how else do you explain USC's
Curtis McNeal fumbling at the
goal line in triple overtime? How

NOTES : Stanford's national title hopes will
face their greatest obstacle in this long
awaited showdown between two top-10
teams. Last year's winner, Oregon, ended
up going to the BCS Championship
Game; Stanford's fate could very well be
the same if it can pull out a victory.



SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
If Stanford wants to survive this much-anticipated showdown with the Ducks,
it will need a stellar performance from its best player, redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck, who was shaky in last year's loss.
else do you explain a 17-game win
ning steak, or the very fact that Luck
returned in the first place? It just feels
like an LSU-Stanford showdown in
New Orleans is waiting to happen.
Of course, there are plenty of fac
tual reasons to pick Stanford in this
game. Like, you know, that the Cardi
nal leads the Pac-12 in both scoring
offense (48.2 points per game) and
defense (a mere 16.6 points per
game). It's also a fact that Oregon's
secondary has been inconsistent at
best this season, and Luck could very
well pick them apart on Saturday.
Were it not for a number of costly
drops, the Washington game last
weekend could have been a lot closer
for the Ducks. The receivers were
open.
It's easy to forget, more than a
year later, that Stanford opened up a
21-3 lead against Oregon in 2010.
That could absolutely happen again
this time in Palo Alto, and it would be
a tall order for Oregon to repeat that
epic second-half comeback. If the
Ducks get off to another slow start, it
might be too late to overcome this
year's team of destiny.
I hope I'm wrong.

Why Oregon will win
First, let me start by saying this is
the hardest thing I have ever written.
Sorry, Cardinal. I wish I knew how to
quit you.
The Ducks will win this game be
cause of one thing and one thing only:

BIG PLAYS.The Webfoots are going
to roll up more offense that you can
fathom. Future Heisman winners
James and freshman running back
De' Anthony Thomas are going to
burn through the Cardinal defense so
hard it will leave senior safety
Michael Thomas and company with
hot tire tracks on their backs.
The Ducks have rolled up 46 plays
of 25 yards or more this season, and
everybody knows that Stanford loves
to give up the big play. Observe
Washington's Chris Polk going for
more than 100 yards on two touch
down runs, or USC's Curtis McNeal
sprint down the left sideline for two
scores of his own, and you'll know
that the Duck run attack is gonna get
theirs in this game. And by get theirs,
I'm talking 400-plus yards rushing.
Even Stanford fans who know
that Stanford holds teams to less than
100 yards on the ground this year
don't trust the ability of their defense
to hold it together against the F-l
speed of the Ducks.
What's more, the Oregon defense
is going to put Luck on his back so
often, he's gonna need a new jersey
by halftime. The nasty Duck D has
the nation's sixth-most sacks, and
anybody who watched the game last
year remembers just how many times
Luck got clobbered.
Lastly, the Ducks have this one in
the bag because the only thing qui
eter than a Stanford library is Stan
ford Stadium. When Oregon got
down early in the game last year,
Autzen responded by making the
second half hell on earth for the out
matched Trees, bearing down on
Luck and company with all the vigor
of 60,000 voices. There's absolutely
no way that happens this Saturday, as
the wine-and-cheese crowd that
shows up to Cardinal games is more
likely to have a jolly good time joking
about the Republican presidential
candidates than making noise in sup
port of their football team.
In the end, it means that three
things will be up in flames at the end
of Saturday's slugfest Andrew
Luck's Heisman campaign, the Car
dinal's perfect season and a big, fat
victory cigar in Chip Kelly's mouth.
Can I go home and wash the vomit
out of my mouth now?

the hardest thing I have ever written.
Sorry, Cardinal. I wish I knew how to
quit you.
The Ducks will win this game be
cause of one thing and one thing only:

BIG PLAYS.The Webfoots are going
to roll up more offense that you can
fathom. Future Heisman winners
James and freshman running back
De' Anthony Thomas are going to
burn through the Cardinal defense so
hard it will leave senior safety
Michael Thomas and company with
hot tire tracks on their backs.
The Ducks have rolled up 46 plays
of 25 yards or more this season, and
everybody knows that Stanford loves
to give up the big play. Observe
Washington's Chris Polk going for
more than 100 yards on two touch
down runs, or USC's Curtis McNeal
sprint down the left sideline for two
scores of his own, and you'll know
that the Duck run attack is gonna get
theirs in this game. And by get theirs,
I'm talking 400-plus yards rushing.
Even Stanford fans who know
that Stanford holds teams to less than
100 yards on the ground this year
don't trust the ability of their defense
to hold it together against the F-l
speed of the Ducks.
What's more, the Oregon defense
is going to put Luck on his back so
often, he's gonna need a new jersey
by halftime. The nasty Duck D has
the nation's sixth-most sacks, and
anybody who watched the game last
year remembers just how many times
Luck got clobbered.
Lastly, the Ducks have this one in
the bag because the only thing qui
eter than a Stanford library is Stan
ford Stadium. When Oregon got
down early in the game last year,
Autzen responded by making the
second half hell on earth for the out
matched Trees, bearing down on
Luck and company with all the vigor
of 60,000 voices. There's absolutely
no way that happens this Saturday, as
the wine-and-cheese crowd that
shows up to Cardinal games is more
likely to have a jolly good time joking
about the Republican presidential
candidates than making noise in sup
port of their football team.
In the end, it means that three
things will be up in flames at the end
of Saturday's slugfest Andrew
Luck's Heisman campaign, the Car
dinal's perfect season and a big, fat
victory cigar in Chip Kelly's mouth.
Can I go home and wash the vomit
out of my mouth now?
With one of the biggest football
games in Stanford history upon us,
we asked Patrick Malee of Oregon's
The Daily Emerald and Jack Blan
chat of The Daily to tell us what
might happen if their worst fears are
realized on Saturday night.

Why Stanford will win
My feelings about this game
have swung in so many different di
rections that I'm starting to get
dizzy. On one hand, Stanford is
banged up, missing its best defen
sive player (junior linebacker
Shayne Skov) and most explosive
receiver (senior wide receiver Chris
Owusu). With junior Oregon run
ning back LaMichael James nearing
a full recovery from his elbow dislo
cation against California and junior
quarterback Darron Thomas inch
ing closer to his old self, the Ducks
are near full strength. Oregon has
speed to burn, along with a defense
that has shown flashes of domi
nance, and there's no reason to
think it can't pull the upset on Sat
urday.
I think about all of this, but then
I remember one thing: Stanford still

has Andrew Luck.
Maybe I'm buying a bit too much
into the hype. Oregon, after all, han
dled the presumptive number one
NFL draft pick just fine last season
in a 52-31 victory at Autzen Stadi
um. He's not completely immune to
mistakes (as the USC game two
weeks ago attests), and even a bril
liant performance might not be
enough to keep up with Oregon's
explosive offensive attack.
But there's something about this
season this "last hurrah" cam
paign for Luck that gives me a
bad feeling about Saturday. Some
times, particularly in college foot
ball, a team just seems to have des
tiny on its side. Last year it was Ore
gon, which seemed to avoid every
injury, saw every key piece fall into
place and came out ahead in every
close game (as the Cardinal knows
very well).
It's hard to explain, and practi
cally impossible to quantify. But
how else do you explain USC's
Curtis McNeal fumbling at the
goal line in triple overtime? How

NOTES : Stanford's national title hopes will
face their greatest obstacle in this long
awaited showdown between two top-10
teams. Last year's winner, Oregon, ended
up going to the BCS Championship
Game; Stanford's fate could very well be
the same if it can pull out a victory.



SIMON WARBY/The Stanford Daily
If Stanford wants to survive this much-anticipated showdown with the Ducks,
it will need a stellar performance from its best player, redshirt junior
quarterback Andrew Luck, who was shaky in last year's loss.
else do you explain a 17-game win
ning steak, or the very fact that Luck
returned in the first place? It just feels
like an LSU-Stanford showdown in
New Orleans is waiting to happen.
Of course, there are plenty of fac
tual reasons to pick Stanford in this
game. Like, you know, that the Cardi
nal leads the Pac-12 in both scoring
offense (48.2 points per game) and
defense (a mere 16.6 points per
game). It's also a fact that Oregon's
secondary has been inconsistent at
best this season, and Luck could very
well pick them apart on Saturday.
Were it not for a number of costly
drops, the Washington game last
weekend could have been a lot closer
for the Ducks. The receivers were
open.
It's easy to forget, more than a
year later, that Stanford opened up a
21-3 lead against Oregon in 2010.
That could absolutely happen again
this time in Palo Alto, and it would be
a tall order for Oregon to repeat that
epic second-half comeback. If the
Ducks get off to another slow start, it
might be too late to overcome this
year's team of destiny.
I hope I'm wrong.
