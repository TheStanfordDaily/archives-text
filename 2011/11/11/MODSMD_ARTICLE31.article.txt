The stage: a cozy ballroom with lavish decor,
adorned with ornaments and gold-lined fig
urines that would seem more fitting for an
orchestra or opera hall, had the hall not been cov
ered with a hardwood floor that gave a hint to its
original purpose. The Regency Ballroom was the
perfect setting for the triumphant return of the
band Jack's Mannequin, who played there Monday
to promote their newest album "People and
Things."
An LA-based trio, Lady Danville, kicked off the
night with their single "Better Side," followed by a
stunningly arranged cover of MGMT's "Kids."
Anchored by their catchy piano melodies, the band
incorporated the unusual cajon drum (an instru-

Peruvian origins),
enhancing the intensely personal performances that
they gave. This later served as a contrast to the huge
sound and powerful vocals of the second opening
act, Stars4s, that embodied the sound of British
rockers like Coldplay and U2, prepping the audi
ence for the real treat they had been waiting for.
When Jack's Mannequin finally took the stage,
the audience gave a rousing cheer. The band
launched into one of their newest songs, "Release
Me," an appropriate tune that perfectly captured the
feelings of everyone in the hall. With frontman

Andrew MacMahon literally jump
ing out of his seat, fans rocked to
the marching beats of the piano
and staccato clicks of the guitar and
drum sounds that resonated
with the emotions and images
evoked by the music, giving fans a

rare opportunity to sense the racing
heart of Jack's Mannequin's music.
Audience members watched
with glee as MacMahon seemingly
transformed into a force of nature,
dancing about the stage as soon as
the music began rolling, sweeping
listeners along as they were taken
on a visual and auditory voyage
through the concert. The band
played fan favorites such as

"Holiday From Real," "The Mixed
Tape" and "Dark Blue," in addition
to new singles such as "My Racing
Thoughts," "Television" and "Amy,
I." Ranging in style from alternately
contemplative acoustic songs to
fierce, edgy renditions that defined
much of the band's original style,
Jack's Mannequin captured the full
emotional spectrum throughout
the concert, leaving the audience

more than satisfied as they walked
out, the lyrics " This song for a long
goodbye/I'm coming back to my girl
by July" ringing in their ears as the
band continued on their musical
voyage across the country.
