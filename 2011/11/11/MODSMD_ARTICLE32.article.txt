# DRUNKEN MAYHEM
## 'GAIETIES' UNDERGOES CHANGES, NUDITY REMAINS

Amidst the celebration of Stanford's
spot near the top of the BCS rankings,
the anticipation of our upcoming
game with Oregon and impending foray with
those foes across the Bay, few students have
stopped to consider that all of the Farm's glo
riousness is owed to the death of one beloved
son. The 26 cast members and 27 staff of

Ram's Head's annual production of
"Gaieties" have been doing just that.
This past Tuesday evening in the rehears-

al space of Roble Gym, a buoyant cast and
buzzing staff met for a final rehearsal of this
year's production of the 100-year-strong
show, "Gaieties 2011: Leland Junior Must
Die." Students bedecked in lame and animal
prints rehearsed sashays while others turned
back handsprings.
"You guys, you're gonna rock this shit,"
exclaimed director Brendon Martin 'l3, more
in awe than in direction as he stood amongst
a huddled company of seasoned returners
and "Gaieties" newcomers.

The lOOth-anniversary rendition oi
one of Stanford's longest-standing tra
ditions trails the controversial showing

of "Gaieties 2010: The Last
Temptation of Cal." The biblically
themed production was anything
but heavenly, and its over-the-top
lampooning of sensitive groups

and topics incited much criticism includ-

ing a walkout of 36 Ujamaa residents
frustrated by the disturbing and divi
sive stereotype-driven humor.
In an attempt to accommodate
the various sub-groups alienated by
last year's performance, Ram's Head
created an advisory board with the

hope to represent those communi
ties during the editing process, an

effort co-head writer Harry Spitzer 'l2 thinks
makes for a better script.
"We established this because there was so
much negative feedback over some of the

content of the show," Spitzer said.
"[The "Gaieties" advisory board]
throughout the process would give us

feedback, tell us what kind of jokes
they thought would be offensive and it
kind of forced us to veer away from
crude and potentially offensive and
stereotype-based humor to more char
acter-based, situational-based humor,"
Spitzer continued. "I actually think it
ultimately benefited the script a lot,
because we were forced to be more
clever in order to be funny."
The script,

helmed by
Spitzer
and Sara

Grossman 'l2 along with eight other writers,
certainly delivers. The historically driven plot
spans three epochs and involves members of
the original Stanford family, the 1911 cre
ation of "Gaieties" and the present day.
Martin laces the intricate script over dynamic
blocking, lending a cinematic quality to
interwoven scenes that jump-cut and con
verge in a cohesive story. At times an

action-thriller, at others a biting satire
of the life and times on the Farm,
"Leland lunior Must Die" incorpo-

rates strictly Stanford humor
that sets out to entertain all
kfrom the freshest of 'lss to
the wizened alums of yes
teryear.

"People are going
to be very surprised
at the changes that
\ we've made,"

promises
"Gaieties"

I producer
Nora Martin
'l2. "Since it's

our 100 th anniversary ... we really
wanted to make sure we brought the
tradition back to what it's meant to
be, which is supposed to be: a huge
rally event before Big Game. It's
what unites the whole cam-
pus."
