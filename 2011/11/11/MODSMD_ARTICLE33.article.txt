How many high-end frozen yogurt stores can one town sus
tain before it reaches critical mass and the entire commu
nity is consumed by fire and brimstone, a la Sodom and
Gomorrah? Over the past few years, our charming town of Palo
Alto has been actively engaged in trying to answer that question. At
this point, I wouldn't be surprised if a frozen yogurt store opened in
the bathroom of an existing frozen yogurt store.
Confused about the sheer number of choices but value your
spare time too much to try them all? Don't worry. I've done it for
you.
Yogurtland:
The good: Yogurtland has an abundance of flavor and topping
options. Ever wanted pistachio fro-yo? Check Need moon fruit and
cheesecake chunks on top of that? Check How about seven sauces or
a sketchy mix of all 16 flavor options? I'm not a math major, but I am
fairly sure that the number of permutations of flavors and toppings
available at Yogurtland is enough to please just about anyone.
