# frozen yogurt
## DEATH MATCH

The bad: Why is Yogurtland so cheap? I
guess this one kind of qualifies as a "plus" for
Yogurtland, but it is a little unnerving when they
only charge you $2.50 for literally a bucket-sized
serving of frozen yogurt. They've got to be cutting
corners somewhere...
Yogurt Stop
Remember in the '9os when frozen yogurt
was an icky last resort at an airport terminal ™
rather than the über-trendy refuge of Atherton
soccer moms on weird probiotic crash diets?

Yogurt Stop harkens back to those early days of frozen yogurt,
when it was an underground, nerdy-cool dessert alternative. So it's
kind of like the Death Cab for Cutie of the frozen yogurt world. I

like to get the cookies and cream variety topped with
M&Ms ironically, of course.
Fraiche
Fraiche is kind of the grande dame of the Palo Alto frozen

M yogurt scene. It's been on the scene sort of long, as far as trendy
J yogurt shops go since 2007. And having grown beyond its
I original outpost in downtown Palo Alto to locations on campus
/ at Tresidder and on San Francisco's trendy Filmore Street, Fraiche
I has established a strong brand presence across the Bay Area as the
leading purveyor of artisanal frozen yogurt.

The hype is in many ways justi
fied. Fraiche s founders, Patama Roj
and Jessica Gilmartin, are Palo Alto
natives who take pains to make batch
es of yogurt from scratch and on-site
in the original Palo Alto store. The
result is yogurt at its most fundamen
tal: crisp, tart, and not too fussy. Add
on any of the ridiculously nice top
pings (fresh fruit, Valrhona chocolate,
etc.) and you have the ultimate in

yuppie snacking.
Added bonus, as if you needed
one: Mark Zuckerberg is a fan. "Like."
Pinkberry:
Remember those Atherton soccer
moms on probiotic crash diets? Yeah,
they are fueled by nothing but
Pinkberry. You deserve better. That is,
unless you're really into salted caramel
flavored frozen yogurt, Pinkberry s
one redeeming quality.

Culture:
I actually might be the only
human being who goes to Culture.
Literally. I have never heard of anyone
else going here. It opened my fresh
man year and is mysteriously still in
business now that I am a senior. Are
the owners just using it as the front for
an organized crime syndicate?
Regardless, this place is actually
really excellent. With a little bit less

creamy consistency than Fraiche, the
yogurt at Culture feels lighter and
packs in more tartness. Add on some
of their fresh, interesting topping
choices (nectarines!) and you get the
most underrated frozen yogurt in the
Palo Alto area.
