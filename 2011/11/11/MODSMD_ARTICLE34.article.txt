# frozen yogurt
## DEATH MATCH

The bad: Why is Yogurtland so cheap? I
guess this one kind of qualifies as a "plus" for
Yogurtland, but it is a little unnerving when they
only charge you $2.50 for literally a bucket-sized
serving of frozen yogurt. They've got to be cutting
corners somewhere...
Yogurt Stop
Remember in the '9os when frozen yogurt
was an icky last resort at an airport terminal ™
rather than the über-trendy refuge of Atherton
soccer moms on weird probiotic crash diets?

Yogurt Stop harkens back to those early days of frozen yogurt,
when it was an underground, nerdy-cool dessert alternative. So it's
kind of like the Death Cab for Cutie of the frozen yogurt world. I

like to get the cookies and cream variety topped with
M&Ms ironically, of course.
Fraiche
Fraiche is kind of the grande dame of the Palo Alto frozen

M yogurt scene. It's been on the scene sort of long, as far as trendy
J yogurt shops go since 2007. And having grown beyond its
I original outpost in downtown Palo Alto to locations on campus
/ at Tresidder and on San Francisco's trendy Filmore Street, Fraiche
I has established a strong brand presence across the Bay Area as the
leading purveyor of artisanal frozen yogurt.
