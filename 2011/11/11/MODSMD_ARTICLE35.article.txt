The auteur is a dying breed. Mass
audiences ravaged Terrence Malick's
"The Tree of Life." Though admit
tedly flawed, it was one of the more complex
pieces of American cinema in recent memo
ry; we seem unwilling to accept American
films as anything more than populist enter
tainment. In this sense, we're lucky to have
someone like David Lynch. Though his films
can be flawed pieces of cinema, Lynch is one
of the few working directors with a distinct
voice. His films often contain quirks, idiosyn
crasies and visual flourishes that are unmis
takably Lynchian.
One of Lynch's most salient characteris
tics is his ear for music. His use of, say, Chris
Isaak's "Wicked Game" in "Wild at Heart"
(1990) was a large part of why that song has
become something of a pop culture mainstay.
More importantly, though, Lynch possesses

an ability to convey
nuanced psychologi
cal states through
these interludes.
There hasn't been a
point in his career
when Lynch's music
has seemed unneces
sarily stylized while
lacking some sort of

greater depth.
Sadly, this can't be applied to his latest
effort. "Crazy Clown Time," his first solo
album, shows Lynch at his most ostentatious
and self-obsessed. Compared to the rest of
Lynch's oeuvre, "Clown" is hardly illuminat
ing. It lacks any new insight into how his
mind works as an artist. The album holds no
surprises; it's what we've come to expect of
Lynch. A number of the tracks "Movin'
On," "She Rise Up," the title track itself —
present worlds that are surrealistic, moody
and abstract. In short, they are unnavigable.
Lynch uses cryptic lyrics and numb
instrumentals as alienating devices, as if
he holds contempt for the audience. He
often chooses to mask his voice through
odd, grotesque distortion, whispering his
way through narratives to evoke psycho
logical distress.

But his songs are no longer seductive.
What should be wondrous and perplexing
instead has a distancing effect. There are
acute instances during which Lynch's works
carry some charge. The album's opening
track, "Pinky's Dream," features the vocals of
Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O, and it's perhaps
Lynch's best her vocals convey a sense of
anguish and thrill, and it's wondrous. "Good
Day Today" has the trappings of an electro
synth, New Order beat that, in truth, masks a
morbid subtext. In these, Lynch fulfills what
it seems he sought to do with this work to
create self-contained, somewhat cinematic
narratives through music.

Because American cinema won't enjoy a
talent like his for quite some time, Lynch
should be applauded for seeking to stretch
across different media. It is meticulous work.
For this, he deserves credit. But he seems to
have nothing new to offer to this medium;
the album is an instance of David Lynch
gracing music with his presence rather than
signifying a sense of artistic progression. His
work shows little in the way of maturity,
quite the opposite of what we should expect
of a veteran artist.
