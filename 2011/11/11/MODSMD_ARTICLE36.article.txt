## Poreotics brings sweet moves to Stanford

It all started with a fire. Well, it wasn't exactly
a fire, although the heat of an inferno
would have been nice as a group of at least
100 stood expectantly outside of Paul Brest Hall
in the brisk autumn night. They were waiting
for the final part of IDX (Identity Xpression), a
two-day event jointly hosted by Lambda Phi
Epsilon and the Residential Arts Program
intended to promote awareness of and engen
der an appreciation for the diversity on the
Stanford campus. As the hopeful spectators
stood cold, this goal was likely not on anybody's
minds; their awareness of cultural diversity was
replaced by a groan-inducing joke that prolifer
ated through the crowd: "I guess the Poreotics
were too hot to handle."
Luckily for everyone, the rest of the night
was not nearly as tragic as that quip quite

the contrary, in fact: organizers had to turn
some people away from the "jam-packed"
venue (presumably because they did not want
to tempt the fire gods). After everyone had set
tled in, Poreotics kicked off the proceedings
with their mechanically smooth brand of
dance-art. Amazing displays of creativity com
bined with flourishes of humor—their finale
was an extended number set to a calypso ver
sion of "Baby Got Back" proved they
deserved MTVs title of America's Best Dance
Crew.
After Poreotics cleared the stage, a parade
of Stanford students showcased their talents in
10 minute-long sets. First up was Raagapella,
who performed two trademark arrangements
that emphasized their diverse influences in both
Asian and Western popular music. Next, the
hip-hop dance group DvB exploded onto the
stage; they surprised the audience with a num
ber set to an unaltered version of

Oneßepublic's "Secrets." After that group
cleared, two poets read two very different
poems, both with the theme of "queer libera
tion": one a passionate invective against Nicki
Minaj's recanting of her bisexuality, one a call to
arms for all queers with a voice. Snaps gave way
to applause for these two as Alliance took the
stage; their unique blend of dance styles provid
ing a fitting end to the night.
Organizers were emphatic that they hoped
to continue the IDX tradition in the future, and
judging by their success, they likely will be able
to. Perhaps next year's event can focus on situa
tional comedy. That would bring people
together, even if the show were too hot to han
dle.
