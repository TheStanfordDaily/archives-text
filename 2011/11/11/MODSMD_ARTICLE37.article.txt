I stunning visuals and solid perform-
from Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte
Gainsbourg as two sisters grappling with
each'other as well as their impending doom, Lars von
Trier's "Melancholia" falls flat, unable to maintain the
story's momentum for its lengthy, two-hour-plus run.
The film takes place in the days leading up to
Earth's collision with the fictional planet of
Melancholia. Its opening montage essentially clues
you in to everything you need to know; not only
will the world end to the swell of a beautifully epic
score, but everything will look eerily gorgeous as it
does. Exaggerated slow motion sequences resem
bling outtakes from a high-fashion photo shoot
emphasize the sisters' distinct sensibilities, showing
how Justine (Dunst) reacts with detached accept
ance and Claire (Gainsbourg) with alarmed panic.

Divided into two parts, the first
chronicles Justine's wedding reception,
an overblown affair organized by Claire.
The party seems ill-fated from the start,
when the bride and groom's limo comi
cally struggles to navigate the winding
road to Claire and her husband John's
(Refer Sutherland) palatial estate. The
newlyweds arrive two hours late, and
the subsequent confrontation between
Justine and Claire is only an indication
of the sparks soon to fly amongst the
other guests, which include the sisters'
divorced and now hostile parents,

played by Charlotte
Rampling and John
Hurt. As the evening
wears on, Justine's
facade as the blushing

bride begins to crumble,
revealing an emotionally unstable
young woman whose frequent disap
pearances from her own party begin to
take their toll on her new husband.
Part two takes place days after the
wedding, during which Justine, now
single, has suffered a breakdown
requiring her to move in with Claire's

family. Claire, however, has
become fixated upon
Melancholia's approach, and
grows increasingly distressed
as it looms ever larger in the

night sky. John, an amateur
astronomer, assures her that the planet
will merely pass them by but, well, you
know how it ends. And whereas the
tragicomedy of the wedding reception
is lively and engaging, the second half
of the film begins to drag under the
weight of its own gravity.
With that said, what makes the film

still enjoyable are its incredible art direc
tion and cinematography. Shot partly on
location at Sweden's breathtaking
Tjoloholm Castle, the isolating backdrop
heightens the drama, particularly as

Melancholia comes closer and Claire
realizes that she has nowhere to hide in
her personal oasis. The rich color palette
shifts from the green hues of the castle
grounds, which serve as Justine's refuge
in the first part, to the more bluish radi
ance of the approaching planet
Perhaps if the sisters were more
fully fleshed out, the audience would be

more compelled to stay with them until
the end. (Justine's personal melancho
lia, for example, is never fully explained.
Dunst has arguably never been better,
but even a great performance cannot
compensate for insufficient writing).

Thus the final act is more of a tedious
slog to an inevitable conclusion. While
there is no doubt that von Trier s film is
a sumptuous visual feast, it might just
leave some viewers cold.
